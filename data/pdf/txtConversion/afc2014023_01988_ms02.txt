Introduction 
Wirt Bellue 
00:41 
Bellue born six blocks from his current residence. (Wirt 
Bellue and his wife live behind his restaurant and welding 
fabrication shop.) Some 46 years in the same location.  
One of the few original residents of the area. Most of the 
old time residents have moved elsewhere. Now largely an 
African American sector of town. “Lot of the old, you know, 
Baton Rouge people were here.” Formerly on a main north-
south artery. Freeway altered the traffic flow in the 60s or 
70s. Many businesses moved to a different part of town.

01:58 
Bellue got interested in welding in high school. Small local 
oil company hired “a bunch of us local school boys.” Bellue 
put with old master welder as welder’s helper. “I kind of, 
you know, fell in love with him...I really idolized him. He 
could weld and do all of these things.” Bellue ended up 
working with him for years. Not one time did he allow 
Bellue to even as much strike an arch. Very protective of 
his work. Job entailed welding pipelines for the oil 
company, building trailers. “Fun stuff, you know.” 
 
03:30 
Not one for school. After high school at age 21 hired on 
with Baton Rouge Police Force. Dealt with ongoing racial 
issues. Over time with wife and kids became very insecure 
working as a police officer. Went and bought $125 welding 
machine. Welded in shed he built behind his house. Never 
happier. Couldn’t wait to get off work. Called on family 
members to show him proper way to weld. Neighbors’  
misguided petition about Bellue running a commercial 
business put him to looking elsewhere. Decided to rent 
space in old time welding shop--the location where he 
remains to this day--for $37.00 per month and go into 
business part-time.   
 
07:31 
Bellue described how he got started. Hung sign out front 
stating minimum charge $2.00. Customers would bring in 
projects like an old lawnmower to have a wheel tacked on. 
Black customers wanted Bellue to make smokers for them. 
Cut (oil) barrels in half to make a pit for smoking garfish 
and “wild meats and what have you.” Experience got Bellue 
interested in smoking his pork loins. Continued taking on 
welding projects he felt comfortable doing and safely doing. 
 
09:40 
Started building BBQ pits using recycled oil barrels. Using 
a recycled car wheel as the foundation piece, Bellue 
designed a butane cooker. “We probably pioneered the 
actual outdoor cooker business.” Sold thousands of them. 
 
10:07 
Bellue talked about his perfectionism. “If I engage into 
anything, you know, it’s got to be right or I’m not going to 
fool with it.” Sister and brother are the same way. 
 
 
3 
10:29 
Demand for his BBQ units with butane cooker was 
constant. Bellue described the design of the butane cooker 
in detail. “Of course, most of the things we built 40 years 
ago are still around.” Went on to describe his design of jigs 
that enable him to piece his projects together with great 
precision. Each unit fabricated has the same exact 
dimensions. “Everything would be exactly the same.” Went 
on to build custom trailers for years. Same approach using 
jigs to ensure all the trailers had perfectly square 
dimensions from one unit to the next. In terms of projects 
Bellue sees it in his mind and then goes and puts it 
together. Does not sketch concepts out beforehand. 
 
12:52 
Built jig for the burners. Actually ended up building several 
different types of burners. On the trailers early on designed 
several for use as a dog and luggage carriers. Recreating  
a trailer today using the same jigs, when completed, the 
trailer will be an exact duplicate of the original built some 
40 years ago with the same perfectly squared corners. All 
welded units. Use of jigs cut labor costs down. 
 
14:45 
With new system Bellue had to hire help. Talked about one 
of his “hardest workers” who could weld as many as 70 
butane cooking units a day.  
 
15:22 
Welding business a part-time endeavor as Bellue remained 
with the Baton Rouge Police Force. Eventually motorcycle 
accident puts him on Workmen’s Comp. for a time. During 
his down time Bellue begins to cook more (boudin, etc.). “I 
had to have something to do” although he still had the 
welding shop a few steps from his house. His employees in 
welding shop would send customers back to Bellue’s house 
to sample his hog head cheese, sausage, (Cajun) boudin. 
Word got out. People started coming to his door. 
 
16:52 
A friend who ran a grocery store with a small kitchen asked 
Bellue “to make some stuff for him.” Turned out customers 
loved Bellue’s cooking. Developed hot tamale that 
customers loved. Then learned a lesson when he tried to 
cut corners by using a low cost corn meal. Totally distorted 
the product. “Make the very best product you can make 
and if you have to adjust the price a little bit, adjust the 
price.” 
 
 
4 
18:33 
Wirt decided to build a “facility” to prepare food for a small 
number of grocery stores. The facility is the present day 
Bellue’s Fine Cajun Cuisine. Issues with Federal meat 
inspectors. Made it almost impossible to operate. “Before 
you could fire a pot up a Federal inspector would be here.” 
 
22:11  
Approach to food business mirrored his approach to the  
welding business. Every process was examined to see  
how it could be made more efficient with consistency. 
Given that most of the food products had to prepare were 
in 1000 pound batches, Bellue engineered and patented an 
immense cooker with multiple uses. Once Bellue figured 
out what worked, just like the welding jigs, he was able to 
go back and recreate. “We’re basically [now] not cooking 
food so much as processing it.” Now able to cook 800 
pounds of white beans in his patented cooker.  
 
23:22 
Bellue talked about how he formulates every ingredient 
once it meets his approval. All seasonings, for example,  
are formulated to the exact degree in grams. With Bellue’s 
patented cooker the operator is able to control revolutions 
per minute (power is supplied by an electric motor), pull 
vacuums, build pressures, chill. Come back in ten years, 
white beans will taste exactly the same. “I have totally 
addressed every avenue, every crack and crevice in this 
operation.” Bellue, now 70, has been refining his restaurant 
operation for decades. 
 
25:13 
During past Holiday Seasons, Bellue has run 100s of 
1000s of pounds of food through the operation. Not one 
complaint from customers. Seldom a complaint at all about 
the food quality. Reflects Bellue’s years of tweaking his 
operation “trying to get all this stuff perfected.” 
 
25:58 
Tremendous asset to have a large welding shop next door. 
If an item is needed for the restaurant operation, it can be 
fabricated next door. “I have designed and built so many 
different things, you know, that has made the operation 
almost trouble free.” 
 
26:52 
Reminisced about his successful attempt at preparing 
fudge as a young boy. Enjoyed the “attaboy’s” and still 
does today. Never cuts corners in his ingredients. “It’s not 
as much about the money as seeing you satisfied and 
giving you what your paying for.” When he was a kid the 
family made sausage. Bellue still does to this day.  
  
 
5 
29:23 
It was just a love and a knack for fooling with it that inspired 
Bellue’s attachment to cooking. Cajun hot tamale one of his 
biggest challenges. “Must have thrown 1000’s of pounds of 
meat and meal away trying to perfect that.” 
 
30:20 
Talked at length about his approach to smoking meats. 
Patterns his technique on old-time smoking techniques like 
those used in Germany. Trick is to slow cook the meat to 
retain the flavor. Now uses pecan wood to smoke their 
hams. On average remove 15 to 20% of water on meat 
products. “Make the best damn product you can possibly 
make. People are going to come for it.” 
 
35:58 
Spoke about frustrations of keeping his product line fresh in 
the grocery stores. Eventually stopped altogether. Bellue 
could control the process at his restaurant, but could not 
control it in the grocery chains. Not worth the hassle, much 
less the loss of his reputation for quality products. 
 
39:31 
Elaborated on the process. Makes large batches of food. 
Immediately seals it into a vacuum bag. Then immediately 
goes to the freezer. No worries about rotation of the food or 
customers getting sick. 
 
36:49 
Difficulty of finding help in a small business. “You are so 
hyped up about your product, but you have to extend your 
service or your product through other people.” Opened 
another store in high rent area, but decided to close it given 
the hassles of finding reliable help. 
 
43:15 
End of first segment.

Note: Background noise from fans increased substantially 
as the interview moved to the food preparation area.

00:00 
Bellue described his patented “Bellue’s Pressurized Rotary 
Cooker.” One has to see it to believe it. Six foot long 
cylinder; 24” in diameter. Many uses: dry tumble 500 to 700 
hundred pounds of meat to work in seasonings and break 
up the protein; cook 1000 pound bags of assorted 
products; 800,000 BTU’’s. ”One hell of a cooking machine.” 
Dry mixer, wet mixer, browner, vacuum tumbler, pressure 
cooker. Also can be configured with an injector to inject 
turkeys with seasonings in 4 seconds flat before they are 
cooked. 
 
05:38 
Described the meaning of the term “pulling vacuum.” When 
pulling vacuum in the tumbler, it is sucking in, making all 
the seasonings penetrate the meat better. 
 
06:59 
Bellue designed and fabricated a more efficient grill for use 
under large cooking pots. “My mind never quits. I never try 
to quit making something the best that it can be. I want it to 
be the best that it can be.” Replaced smaller rods with solid 
1” bar stock. Heavier rods under the pots don’t bend with 
the heat. Also, when the rod(s) get cherry red they help 
radiate the heat far better than the smaller dimensioned 
rods. 
 
08:00 
Bellue designed and fabricated a tumbler to dust shrimp 
with flour. 
 
08:87 
Designed and fabricated grill to toast large numbers of po’ 
boy buns using a solid 3/4” plate that rotates. “This is how 
my mind works. I’m trying to get something that will do 
massive volumes of bread, you know, and get them all the 
same.” The unit he came up with grills 40 po’ boy buns at a 
time. “There again, there’s something here when I do it. I 
get a kick out of how well this thing works every time.” 
Unlike a conventional grill, regardless of where one 
touches the grill, the heat is the same.

11:04 
Bellue spoke again about the precise formulations he has 
devised for each menu item. Referenced his cookbook;  
basically a catalogue of recipes that lays out procedure for 
preparing each menu item. Proportions are listed in grams. 
All laid out for the next owner of the business. To lend 
example, Bellue read the recipe for preparing white beans 
in the “BPRC” (Bellue’s Pressurized Rotary Cooker). “I 
mean it’s pretty simple. You know I think anybody could 
formulate this thing up and carry on.” Over time, thanks to 
caring help, transitioned from recipes written on scraps of 
paper stored in a cardboard box, to today’s reference 
cookbook with all of Bellue’s “formulations” clearly laid out 
on each page. 
 
13:06 
All food items at Bellue’s are freeze dried after cooking. 
Bellue designed and fabricated the serving table located in 
the front kitchen area. Holds 200 gallons of water at a 
constant 187 degrees, 24 hours a day. Frozen food in bags 
is put in the 200 gallon hot bath to warm, then served. It 
matters not who is serving. The process throughout from 
cooking, to vacuum packing, to serving out front is always 
the same. “That gives us good quality control across the 
counter. Everything we pass across the counter is always 
the same.” 
 
14:00 
Wirt is now designing a mechanism that will actually rock 
the BPRC (Bellue’s Pressurized Rotary Cooker) while it is 
in use. That task is currently done manually. 
 
14:38 
End of second segment.

Note: The interview continued outside as we walked next 
door to Bellue’s welding/fabrication shop. The background 
noise is from the freeway that runs next to Bellue’s 
property. 
 
00:00 
Bellue described his custom made “glider” (porch swing) 
made from 1/8” plate. At his Mississippi weekend home, 
Bellue designed a similar model mounted on a 60 foot 
monorail with an electric motor. “I ride off of the porch and 
look at the sky and go back and forth.” 
 
 
8 
01:00 
“When I do something I really go to the extremes.” Bellue 
talked about his custom jigs for building trailers. Use of his 
custom jigs ensures every trailer will be exactly the same in 
dimension. 
 
 
Note: The interview moved inside Bellue’s welding and 
fabrication shop.  
 
02:07 
Bellue described the design features of his “old wheel 
cooker thing.”  
 
03:31 
Bellue spoke about the advantages of his custom jigs. “But 
to sit there and think about doing something like this and 
building it, every burner, and every BBQ pit, and every 
trailer is (he trails off). Of course you’ve eliminated all your 
guess work. Anybody could build it now and they all the 
same.” The projects mentioned here, “[are] history now” as 
Bellue takes on other design challenges. 
 
03:55 
End of third segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110353 
 
 
Note: The interview continued outside with freeway noise  
in the background. 
 
00:00 
Bellue’s projects “a lot of hard work.” Not uncommon for 
him to see the sun come up after working throughout the 
night on a project. Would get down at times if he couldn’t 
figure something out. Sometimes worked two to three days 
straight without even taking a nap. Constantly pushed 
himself. Now that he has problem solved so much, Bellue’s 
time spent--“especially the food business”--is more 
enjoyable than ever. 
 
00:37 
Bellue always strives for perfection. All the details matter to 
him. None of the particulars are unimportant. Raised as 
kids to do things right. It all goes back to Bellue’s time as a 
child looking after grandmother’s yard. 
 
 
9 
01:12 
Elaborates on yet another current side project. Bellue 
mounted three vintage bells and a steam whistle on top of 
his commercial sign overlooking the freeway. One hundred 
forty pounds of air pressure drives the steam whistle. Also 
configured wind chimes from 16 recycled oxygen cylinder 
bottles cut to various lengths and fitted with dingers. Once 
the wind chimes are painted up, they will be suspended 
from the sign which stands 47 feet in the air. “They have a 
really good chime to them.” 
 
04:29 
Bellue described another ongoing project, an oversize  
sifter mounted on wheels designed to extract sand from 
gravel. “I don’t give up. I’ve been working on this thing for 
five or six years.” 
 
09:27 
“And listen, it doesn’t make any difference what that thing 
does inside here to me by me thinking all these years about 
it and see it work. Money can’t buy that, you know.” 
 
09:37 
End of fourth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110354 
 
 
Note: Interview continued outside at the back of the 
restaurant. 
 
00:00 
Bellue pointed out one of his custom rotisseries mounted 
on a trailer. “I take two wild hogs and put in there. I got ’em 
on a rotisserie. Oh, man, some of the best eatin’ you’ve 
ever…” According to Bellue, it’s a mistake to position the 
heat source at one end of a BBQ pit laid out on the 
horizontal. Bellue’s cookers are laid out vertically to 
optimize the heat source. “Heat don’t run sideways. Do you 
understand? Heat rises.” With the heat source positioned  
at the bottom of the unit, as the heat works it way to the  
top it radiates out. 
 
00:53 
Bellue talked about his custom designed smokehouse 
located behind his restaurant. Inside the 16 foot 
smokehouse, meat to be smoked can be elevated inside 
the unit using a pulley system. Routine is to build a pecan 
wood fire mixed at times with oak. “This is the old-fashion 
way that they did it” with a slow fire around 90 to 100 
degrees. “And that heat just goes around. You come back 
here the next morning and that’s the prettiest damn thing 
you ever seen in your life.”  
 
 
10 
02:34 
“But it’s been a lot of fun. I’ve come a long way.” 
 
02:56 
End of fifth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS 110355 
 
 
Note: Interview continued inside the restaurant in the food 
preparation area. 
 
00:00 
“We can’t hardly find any help to do anything. The thing is, 
to do the volume of food that we do, most people they’d 
have 20 people working.” Bellue’s core food prep crew 
numbers three people. Bellue has designed the system so 
it is almost labor free. A friend downtown has 15-20 people 
working for him at his restaurant. “People doing nothing” 
with many complaints. 
 
00:53 
Bellue talked about employee theft issues. 
 
00:58 
End of sixth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS 110356 
 
 
Note: Interview concluded inside the restaurant in the food 
preparation area. 
 
00:00 
Bellue at one time sought out master smokehouse cooks. 
One was from Magnolia, Mississippi. Contrary to the 
practice of most old-timers who smoke their meat only 
when it was cold, this cook smoked his meat in the middle 
of the summer. His secret? “Son, if you use fresh meat, 
you’ll never have a problem.” His practice was to smoke 
meat butchered the day before. He also shared this: “Son, 
you’re first loss is always going to be your cheapest loss? 
 
03:44 
Bellue spoke to the folly of continuing on when you know at 
heart the food is not up to standard, and in the end it must 
be thrown out. “That’s the greatest thing anybody taught 
me. Everything else I’ve been pretty much self-taught. Not 
that I can’t be taught something. But all this stuff is my 
original.” 
 
 
11 
04:27 
Old-timers told Bellue some of the worst whippings they 
ever had was when they let the smokehouse flair. “This is 
not a heat thing. This is what they [the old timers] call a 
‘cold smoke’ that the old-fashion method is.” 
 
05:35 
End of interview.
