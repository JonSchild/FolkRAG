I: 
All right. Great. Let’s get started. So, once again I do want to say thank you, S, for opening your home 
to us, for the work that you do, and for agreeing to be part of this interview. We’re really interested in hearing 
your story as a personal care worker. I know you’ve been doing this work for quite some time. So, let’s start 
right there. We would like to hear more about your story and start at the beginning. You know, how did you get 
into this kind of work, and when, and why? And what inspired you to do this kind of work? 
P: 
Okay. So, yes, I’ve been doing this kind of work for a little over 20 years. I can go back to high school 
where I [63.18] had some difficulties with school and had no ambition to go to college. So, I was trying to think 
of work I could do that wouldn’t require a diploma. And then I heard about direct care, and I thought that would 
probably be a really good fit for me because I enjoy meeting new people. I love helping people and assisting 
them with their needs, which I’ve done since I was real young. So, I thought that might be a really nice place 
for me to look.  So, I started applying for different agencies in our town here, and did get hired in to one of 
them, and it was nice because I walked in, I didn’t need a diploma or, you know, and I didn’t have to have 
certain experience. They just hired me right in, and gave me a, you know, all the forms, but then they— 
I: 
You’re doing fine. 
P: 
They sent me out without training to a home, and I was comfortable with that. I wasn’t worried about it 
until I got to the home. The first person I was sent to was a high-school student who lived with a parent, who 
the parent was gone, and I was to come in and help her get into a Hoyer lift. I had never seen a Hoyer lift 
before. I had never used a Hoyer lift before. I didn’t know what it was for, and this girl isn’t able to walk, so she 
said I needed to help her get in, so she could go use the bathroom. We worked for probably 2 hours trying to 
get her out of bed and in a Hoyer lift until I told her I needed to get some backup help. It took another hour for 
somebody to come out, so all that time she was unable to use the bathroom, and I had a lot of concerns after 
that shift because I was realizing I needed more training than they were offering. So, I was called out to my 
second job, again, I hadn’t had any training, and it was a gentleman that had Parkinson’s, and he was unable 
to get himself out of bed, and he needed somebody to lift him up. He was probably about 6’ 3” and 180 
pounds, and he was dead weight. There’s no way I could have lifted him by myself, but the caregiver hadn’t 
shown up, so they needed somebody there to see if they could help out. So, again, the client was very upset. 
Upset with me, upset with the agency, upset that I didn’t have the training. His wife was upset, and I eventually, 
again, had to call somebody else and wait for them to come [60.0] and then leave. So, I had some experiences 
like that at the beginning that were very concerning, and they didn’t have training for me, so I eventually cut 
down my hours and started looking for other work because I didn’t want to go to any homes unless I had more 
experience and I knew what I was walking into. So, that’s kinda how I got started [59.32]. 
I: 
So, after some rather negative experiences like that right at the very beginning, what motivated you to 
stick with it and find other ways to provide personal care and help older people? 
P: 
Well, I think I talked to so many people who needed assistance in their home. They wanted to be at 
home. They didn’t want to be in a facility, and they would try to work with me and teach me how to be a 
caregiver for them. And kind of avoid certain tasks or things that I wasn’t able to do, or I wasn’t trained to do. 
And then for that they would try to get somebody else in to help them, but it was hard to find work without that 
training. And the wages were very low, and so I eventually did go back to school and decided to become a 
certified medical assistant so that I could get consistent work and more experience. So, I did that for a while, 
but I still did home health care on the side. 
I: 
So, talk a little bit about the work that you tried to get as a personal care worker. Did you go to other 
agencies, did you try to go out on your own and recruit your own clients? 
P: 
Yeah. I went out on my own. I didn’t go with an agency.  
I: 
So how did you do that? How did you find clients?

P: 
Oh, word-of-mouth usually from one client to another [57.56], would talk to their friends or family—
family members and they trusted me by that time, and I was dependable, and a hard worker. 
I2: 
If you were giving someone else advice about how to do that kind of freelance work, what would you tell 
them—what story would tell them about, or what would be the tipping point of being able to get clients? 
P: 
I’m not sure what you mean? 
I2: 
So, when you’re looking for work yourself, you’re basically marketing for yourself. 
P: 
Mmm hmm 
I2: 
And of course, word-of-mouth is strong. So, whenever we think back to different experiences, different 
periods in our life, one helpful way to get a glimpse of that for the outside world, because you have all these 
memories, but we’re trying to, you know, get little cross-sections. Maybe if you could tell us about a memorable 
time that was a tipping point that worked or a time when something didn’t work during that phase. Maybe 
there’s nothing, but. 
P: 
[Pause] I think the tipping point for me of not being able to stay with it was the income, and the 
insecurity of work, trying to do this on my own. I could find work, but it was sparse. It wasn’t full time, and I just 
couldn’t afford to do that. That’s when I decided I needed more structured income [56.14]. 
I: 
You mentioned the med-tech. That provided a consistent income. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Whereas the personal care did not. 
P: 
Right. And even when I’m with an agency, the work is sporadic. It’s, you know, you might have 10 
hours this week and 30 the next, or 2 the next. You just couldn’t depend on it, and there was no—there was 
nothing to back you. There was no—you weren’t paid salary. You were paid hourly, so there just wasn’t any 
backup, and I just couldn’t feel like I could do that. 
I: 
So, to give people a sense of what it takes to be an independently employed personal care worker, you 
have to recruit the clients, but then you also have to negotiate with them the hours, the pay rate. How do you 
do that? How do you talk to somebody about how much to charge and what they can afford and the schedule? 
P: 
It can be difficult. I think for me, I was comfortable with telling people I would work on a sliding [scale] 
for them, and I did have a lot of people come to me and tell me they needed somebody to come into their 
home just a couple hours a week. This was when I was working as a medical assistant, and they needed 
somebody to come in. They didn’t want an agency to come in because of all their requirements, and the cost 
for an agency was so expensive. And they wanted to be at home and [54.35] be independent, but they just 
needed 2 or 4 hours a week, somebody to come in. So, I kept hearing that over and over, and that’s when I 
eventually went out on my own again, and decided I’ve got to do this and be out there. But I think you just have 
to be comfortable with going into a home, and chatting, meeting somebody you’ve never met. Usually, like I 
said, my referrals came from somebody I already knew, so that gave us something in common. And then, you 
just—you talk about—you try to find out what needs they have and to see if you can provide those needs. And 
if you can’t provide them, then it’s a good time to talk about it right then and see if there’s anyway to be helpful. 
And same with the wages, you know, I would usually tell them that I start at this rate, and we can evaluate that. 
We can increase or decease that depending on your income, and most people would work with me on it. And 
some people didn’t have any more, so you might get paid really low for [laughs], you know, one client, and then 
a little higher for another, and it usually worked out pretty good.

I: 
You mentioned having the med-tech job as well as going out on your own, and I know that’s typical of a 
lot of personal care workers that they have to have more than one job just to make ends meet. 
P: 
Right. Yeah. 
I: 
And it sounds like that was true for you. 
P: 
Yes. I was doing both. I’d work home care on the weekends, and a fulltime job during the week. 
I: 
And you’re doing that now as I understand it as well. You’re working doing some personal care work 
with a few clients, and then you also have a second job or a third job maybe even. 
P: 
Well, I have about four employers. I work with Peckham Industries with clients that have disabilities, 
and then I do home care for a couple different agencies, so I can find enough work. 
I: 
Okay. Are you able to piece things together? 
P: 
Yeah. I am, but physically it’s hard to—home care work can be challenging if you have any kind of 
physical limitations. 
I: 
Can you expand on that a little bit? Do you have—what’s difficult about home care? 
P: 
Well, there’s a lot of transferring for people. Most people that need somebody to come in either have 
difficulty walking or are unable to walk, so there is a lot of lifting of people. And that is one of my areas that’s 
hard for me to provide, so there are jobs I do turn down because of that. And I end up doing a little more 
companionship work. There’s a lot of other things I can do too, like bathing. I can help with bathing, cleaning, 
cooking meals, medicine reminders, scheduling appointments and going with clients to appointments. So, 
there are a lot of other things I can do, but if anybody comes up with a disability there isn’t any protection for 
you, and there’s no, you know, you just are unable to do that kind of work [50.50]. 
I: 
You said you’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I’m aging. I know you’re aging, so your physical 
capabilities probably changed over time. 
P: 
They have. 
I: 
Have you experienced any injuries over the course of that 20 years or has your own aging made it 
more difficult for you take certain clients than others? 
P: 
Well, I think one concern I had was I never had like any instruction or training on how to lift people, and 
how to—I never had a back brace or anything that might have helped my back and me being safe. But… I 
forgot what I was going to say. I’m sorry.  
I: 
That’s okay. Change over time. It’s all right. Let me ask a related question, and maybe that will help jog 
your memory, but you said at the very beginning you were not offered any training. Certainly not in how to use 
a Hoyer or transfer somebody or lift somebody. Have you had other training over the 20 years? Were you able 
to go through training? Do you want to be off for a moment? Okay. 
I2: 
Perfect. 
I: 
Then I’ll take a sip of tea. 
P: 
Sorry. See I don’t know if I should bring up my training with like BTBQ? 
I: 
Oh, yeah. Sure. Why not? Maybe it was a horrible experience for you, in which case maybe you 
shouldn’t [laughing].

P: 
No, but I didn’t know if I should bring this into it. 
I: 
Yeah. It’s okay.  
I2: 
Well, let’s do a psychological exercise. So, you know this is like—there’s this foreign object here, and 
there’s a mic, and this isn’t your space, and you are the queen of this space. So, there’s this online form called 
Readit, and Readit is basically a—I don’t know if you’ve used that, but it’s just like a form where you can ask a 
question and then people answer from all over the world. 
P: 
Oh. 
I2: 
It’s a huge universe on the Internet called Readit, and on Readit there’s this thing called ELI5, and 
someone will—let’s say you’re talking about architecture and I don’t know anything about architecture, and I 
can be like ELI5 gothic architecture, and then ELI5 stands for Explain it like I’m 5. 
P: 
Mmm. 
I2: 
And we are—that’s how I want you to think about us. Like, you’re the expert. We’re trying to glean 
information from you. You are in control of this situation 100%. You can always stop this, end this, we will 
leave. Like, you are in control. We are observing, so when it starts to feel like oh, I’m being listened to, I may 
say something wrong, you know, when talking to someone who’s 5, it doesn’t matter. You know, like, and that’s 
how this is. This is story time. I don’t mean to speak for you— 
I: 
Oh, no, no. That’s right. I’m glad you brought that up. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Yeah. So, this is all edited. You can cut it. You don’t have to say things right because that kind of 
hesitation—because we want to get to you, and that kind of guardedness is going to, you know, interrupt that. 
P: 
Right. That’s true. 
I2: 
That’s it. So, like the way your shoulders relaxed now, the way you’re looking at me, the smile, like, this 
is gold. 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I2: 
And right, now, everything is turned off by the way, but if I could just get that it would be incredible. 
P: 
I’ll try to relax. 
I2: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
So, we’re fine. 
I2: 
I think you are. You are relaxed. 
P: 
No, I am a little tense. I’m worried about what I’m saying. 
I2: 
Yeah. No, you don’t have that—and, you know, you don’t have to be at all because it’s a very safe 
space, very safe space where you’re in control. This gives me a good opportunity to [46.53] to quickly change 
my cards. 
I: 
Okay. So, does that help? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Thank you.

I: 
Yeah. That’s great. That was excellent, K. Thanks. Yeah, so we’re fine, and you’re telling us a story. It’s 
story time. I have my milk and cookies over there. 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
I’m gonna get my little blankie [laughing]. Just so I don’t fall asleep. Oh, yeah, that’s still going because 
I can edit that out too. 
P: 
Okay.  
I: 
You know, and do we have final editing rights? 
I2: 
Elaborate more on that question. 
I: 
So, let’s say she previews the final product and there’s pieces of it that she absolutely hates. 
I2: 
Yeah, so with original consent that you read, you have rights to this throughout, and we can make it so 
that we look through it together before anything gets released. Having said that, this, today’s thing is for our 
learning purposes and our workshopping purposes, so yeah. This can go as far or as little as you would like. 
Am I right about that? 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Yeah. So, yes, you can talk about BTBQ. That’d be fine. 
P: 
Okay. So, we can really lead into that. I think that’s where we left off wasn’t it. 
I: 
I think the important thing—this isn’t going to be a commercial for BTBQ, but it is what you took. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And it is different than most training classes in that it was—it’s comprehensive, you know, it kind of 
covered—tried to cover at least the basics. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
All of the basics [45.15], not just handwashing or transferring, but you know, all of the—and I think one 
of the things we do eventually want to use this for is to promote that kind of training and say this is important 
because it is important. And it’s really not—it’s not just about the safety of the client, it’s about your safety. 
P: 
Right. And I should talk about that a little more too. 
I: 
Okay. Yeah, you started to get into that. 
P: 
And then I got— 
I: 
You didn’t get training on good body mechanics for example, and you have had some injuries, right? 
Maybe they weren’t client related. They weren’t client related, right? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But they interfered with your ability to provide care. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Right. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I mean that’s one of the things about this work, and you got injured—your hand, of all things, you know. 
If you get an injury it’s like a pianist—a concert pianist, they injure their hand - what are they gonna do? That’s 
their life’s work. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Right. 
P: 
So, I couldn’t— 
I: 
I mean I could probably keep functioning without a hand, but a pianist might not be able to [laughing], 
so. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
One-handed, pianist. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
[Laughs] 
P: 
And you can’t when you’re doing this kind of work. 
I: 
Right. 
P: 
You have to have two hands, really [44.0]. 
I: 
And do you have health insurance, S? Are you comfortable getting into any of that? 
P: 
Well, I don’t know if I should because I’m on disability right now. 
I: 
Oh. Okay. 
P: 
I could say I’m on Medicaid. 
I: 
So, I don’t want us to talk about anything that’s going to jeopardize that. Is there anything that would 
jeopardize that? No. Okay. 
P: 
Mmp mmm. I don’t think so. 
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
So, what we did already we can do—for today we can do three or four more blocks that thick, but keep 
in mind I recorded some when we were just sitting down and all that stuff, so yeah. 
I: 
Well, I have a question though because we’re fast losing light. 
I2: 
Yes. 
P: 
Oh. 
I2: 
Well, we have two—we have some time. Yeah. Absolutely. I don’t want one clip of the video to be 
drastically different than the second, so I think that we have sunlight until like 5, and right now it’s 3:45. So, we 
have an hour. Also, just a kind of point for us, is that we have to maintain—there is like a real thing that is 
camera fatigue. Being in front of that is just—even if you’re totally 100% relaxed it’s still like really exhausting. 
I: 
Sure. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17

I2: 
So, as we work forward, I think that’s something we’ll have to figure out 
I: 
Well, so typically these interviews last about 45 minutes. 
I2: 
Okay, yeah. 
I: 
To an hour. 
I2: 
Okay. Yeah. 
I: 
If S was like an old—if I was interviewing an older person it would be 45 minutes max, but since she’s 
younger, you know, I think last time we went about an hour. 
P: 
I think so. 
I: 
And we don’t like to go more than that. 
I2: 
Sounds good. Technical aside, one thing I want to do is have it so that—this is in our list, and I won’t be 
changing cards like this during an actual. 
I: 
And advice for me? Am I doing okay? 
I2: 
Yeah. That’s so good, and you’re doing actually great. I just want you to do worse. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
Mess up some. 
P: 
Mess up. 
I2: 
Yeah. You’re doing too good [group laughter]. 
P: 
Oh, when I said I forgot what I was going to say. 
I2: 
Oh, that’s fine. Again, this is not a test. We want to capture you, so whoever you are is what we’re 
looking for. 
I: 
Yeah. And S’s a beautiful person, so we can— 
P: 
Well, I’m just grateful to be able to voice some concerns. 
I: 
Yeah. It’d be kind of the voice for a lot of PCAs, too, so. 
I2: 
Sorry about this reach. 
P: 
Yeah. That’s neat. 
I: 
Yeah. That’s cool. 
I2: 
[Laughing] we’ll have a stand, or we’ll have lights depending on what happens. 
I: 
Well, how do we do that? You gotta prop. 
P: 
Here. 
I2: 
No, no. You should be comfortable. Are you comfortable? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Okay. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17

I: 
Does that work? 
I2: 
That works perfectly. Ah, that works really well. 
I: 
Okay. Are we about ready to get going again? 
I2: 
Yup. I’m just gonna focus on you, and so is that where you’re gonna sit? Where are you going to sit? 
I: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
Cool [laughing]. You’re welcome to do whatever. Just if you come too far forward or back, then it comes 
out of focus, so I just want to make sure that you maintain your position. 
I: 
Are we on? 
I2: 
We are about to be on in a second. 
P: 
What are you starting with? See I feel like I’m jumping around. 
I: 
No, you’re not. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
You’re doing fine. 
P: 
Okay.  
I: 
You’re actually answering the questions, so if there’s any jumping, it’s me. All right. Here we go. So, we 
left off with you telling—at the beginning you started to talk about several clients that through an agency where 
you were called upon to do some things that were really outside of your skill level. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And then you alluded to the fact that, you know, it’s dangerous. Not just for the client. I know you were 
concerned about the client, but it’s dangerous for you as well. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Do you want to speak a little bit about that? 
P: 
Yeah. You know, I was working on my own to—and there wasn’t any insurance coverage that I could 
purchase to help protect me. There was no compensation for if you get injured while you’re working. I did have 
that while I was with the company, but [39.]. 
I: 
But not when you were self-employed you don’t. 
P: 
Not when you’re self-employed. 
I: 
It’s unaffordable. 
P: 
It just isn’t there. 
I: 
You also started to mention training. You didn’t have any in the beginning, but I think you said you had 
some over the course of the 20 years. Was there training that helped you so that you could perform the tasks 
in a way that were safer for the client, but also for yourself? 
P: 
There was, so I did have a medical assistant training, which taught me a lot about caring for people, but 
not the hands-on type of thing, and then I was introduced to a BTBQ training that was available. And I was able 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
8
to go through that program, and it was wonderful. That’s what I needed the 15 years before that because it 
took me through so many different aspects of being a home care provider, and taught me how to do it, and 
taught me how to be safe, how to keep the client safe and for myself to be safe [37.46], and how to do things 
correctly. So, I really wished I had had that training when I first started, and then I would have probably stayed 
with that work fulltime if I felt more confident about that. 
I: 
So, what were the most important things about that training? The skills that you got that really helped 
you on the job, what kinds of things did that cover? 
P: 
Well, it was very condensed. It was—we covered all about bathing, and, you want to know different 
areas of training? 
I: 
Right. So, there was a lot of hands-on discussion, and there was also a lot of open-book discussion 
with other home health aides and teachers, but I learned a lot about for instance the lifting that was a concern. 
I learned how to lift. I learned how to do things like different ways to provide bathing experiences. Let me think. 
Well, over the course of 20 years, you’ve probably heard a lot of stories from—I know you’ve known other 
personal care workers, and I hope have shared experiences with each other, and were—I’m sure you’ve heard 
stories about people not being trained, and clients being at risk, and— 
P: 
Right.  
I: 
--or personal care workers getting injured. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. I have heard different stories, and then people are afraid to bring it to the attention of 
anyone because there’s no— 
I: 
Why would that be? 
P: 
--you don’t know who to talk to, you don’t know who to—you can talk with the family, you know [35.27], 
but if the family has realized that something’s happened, they’re probably gonna let you go right away too. 
Even though—I mean they might think you’ve had the training. I think a lot of people go into different homes 
where they haven’t had the training, but they haven’t told anybody, and they just try to get through it. I’ve heard 
that a lot especially at some of the facilities that they’re expected to do a lot of things that they’re not qualified 
for. But they need the job, so they try to do the best they can, you know. 
I: 
So, I’ve been calling your work personal care work and you a personal care assistant or aide. What do 
the clients call you?  
P: 
They usually call me a helper, or they call me by my first name. 
I: 
What do you call yourself? When somebody asks you what kind of work do you do, how do you 
describe it, and what’s the label you attach to it? 
P: 
I tell people that I’m a direct care worker, and I work out of their home. 
I: 
And that feels good to you? 
P: 
Yeah. That feels good to me. 
I: 
Because there’s so much language around direct care work or personal care work that seems to 
devalue the workers— 
P: 
Right. I have used personal care aide, too, because I think more people know that term, but yeah, 
there’s a lot of—I feel devalued in my work [33.58]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17

I: 
Can you expand on that a little bit? What makes you feel—what kinds of things make you feel 
devalued? 
P: 
Well, people will say, “Oh, you’re just an aide.” You know, I don’t think they understand what our work 
entails, and how hard it really is, and what it takes to be a good caregiver. 
I2: 
Can you tell us about one person you were caring for, and something that ties to that that pops up in 
your memory? Like one day you went to take care of someone, and this is a conversation you had with one of 
their family members or does a story come to mind that are just prominent in your mind? Positive or negative 
or whatever? Like we’re sitting here and we’re like, hey, tell us—we’re 5 and tell us [group laughter]—no, I’m 
just kidding. 
I: 
Tell us a story that would be interesting. 
I2: 
Tell us about your job, yeah, yeah. I mean I hear you in all these things, but sometimes because you 
have memories you are intuiting a lot of things and we want to get to those things. 
P: 
I think with family mostly I hear that. 
I2: 
Okay. 
P: 
I hear, “Well, you’re just an aide. You’re just a—you can do better. You can, you know—” 
I2: 
Your own family? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Okay. 
P: 
You can go out there and get an education and [32.32]. 
I2: 
So, this is happening to you from your people who are your advocates, but there must be another 
balancing side that’s the other side that is giving you that emotional reward. Can you tell us about that a little 
bit—that is keeping things balanced? 
P: 
Oh, from the people that I work with? 
I2: 
Sure. Yeah. 
P: 
Well, I think I’m very appreciated by family—the family really will let you know how much they 
appreciate your work, and the clients do to. The clients share their value with you, so that helps balance things 
out, and I know how important it is. I know having some strange person come into your home and want to help 
you with a bath that you’ve never met before is difficult for the client and for me. So, you have to really go in 
there with an open and comfortable perception of how it will go. I think just by talking with people in general 
and we talk about—people are talking about their careers, and you mention that you’re a home-care aide, 
there’s usually—it’s usually more of a tone of voice or remark that they might make about, “Oh,” [laughs]. 
I2: 
Do people ask you sometimes what that is, and if so, what do you—how do you respond? 
P: 
They do ask me what it is [30.57], and I respond by explaining some of the things that I do, and also 
about the personal traits that it takes to be able to provide this kind of work, and that it’s not for everyone. 
I: 
What kind of personality traits does it take?

P: 
I think a person needs to be very understanding, patient, willing to step in and do things that, you know, 
that they need done, that you’re qualified to do but that it’s not comfortable. Like maybe some of the toileting 
responsibilities and things like that. 
I2: 
Can you tell us a story about one time your patience was really tested? 
P: 
By--? 
I2: 
In your line of work. 
I: 
By client or by a family member. 
P: 
That was tested? 
I: 
Yeah. Your patience was tested. 
I2: 
Where you had to really kind of calm yourself down or when you reached a limit. 
P: 
Mmm. I think working with clients that have dementia is something that I find very hard mentally, and of 
course, you’re working hard physically, too, but it’s a lot different. It takes a lot more control, a lot more 
patience to talk with people that are forgetful, and you know, they might repeat things 20 times in 15 minutes, 
and you have to keep trying to find out ways to bring them out of the direction that they’re headed in their 
thought process [28.59]. It’s really challenging, so I think, yeah, I think dementia is probably one of the hardest 
jobs that I’ve ever had. 
I: 
What do you find most rewarding about being a personal care worker? And I think to K’s point, you 
know, there’s some negatives involved, and you don’t always get the support that you feel it deserves, but 
there’s something keeping you in there, right, and keeping you doing it? 
P: 
Yeah. I think it’s just such an important job, and I think there’s so many people that need assistance in 
the home. Well, of course, they need it in facilities too, but personal—you know, I’m talking about mostly 
working from home. People want their independence, and they wat to know that they can trust people, and I 
get so much feedback from my clients and their family that keep me in this line of work. It’s so important. I think 
a lot of people don’t understand what’s entailed with this type of work, and so it’s really devalued. 
I: 
What do you say to people who call it low-skilled work? What do you say? 
P: 
Well, I— 
I: 
Or what do you want to say? 
P: 
I want to say we’re highly skilled in a different area, you know— 
I: 
Like if you could say anything you wanted to people who think of this as low-skilled work, what would 
you say? 
P: 
I think you should try it [laughing] for—come over and try it for a couple weeks [laughs] and see how 
you do. It’s very difficult at times, and if you don’t have the right personality [27.10], it’s gonna be even harder 
for you. And there are a lot of people taking care of family members now that don’t have any training. There 
needs to be some training out there for us, so that we can continue doing this work, and more people can get 
involved. Even the younger generation, but they really do need to have the training first, I think. I don’t know 
what else I would say to someone except you won’t know until you experience it. You really need to experience 
it to understand. I can go through a list of things that I help people with, and sometimes that’s enough for 
somebody to say, [laughing] that’s not for me. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17

I: 
So, could you do that for us? You know, take a typical session with a client or a typical day, and you 
know, what are the kinds of things that you do for them? If you could walk us through a typical session that’d 
be great. 
P: 
So, yeah, I’ve been working with a lady who’s 98. She’s very unstable. She’s not in a wheelchair, but 
uses a walker. So, a typical day would be I would come in and help her get out of bed. We’d walk to the 
bathroom, and I’d help her with all her toileting. I’m not saying that word right today [25.44]. And that means 
everything, you know, cleaning up, wiping, changing their pants when they need it done, brushing their teeth, 
combing their hair. Anything else they might need in the bathroom, and then when we would come out we 
would walk out, and I would fix breakfast. I would help her eat. I would help her figure, you know, what she 
wants to eat. She doesn’t talk a lot, so it’s hard to communicate. We use a lot of pictures and different things to 
help us communicate, make sure she has her medicine. Then we’d do exercises after breakfast. We do 
walking. We do physical therapy, and you know, there’s a lot of therapy work too because people need to talk, 
and they might be very upset about things, and you really need to be a good listener, and to let them voice how 
they’re feeling about things, and how things are going, and what’s going on with her family and all the 
dynamics that go on in a family that can be positive and negative. You have to be able to want to hear those 
things and help them work through it. So, we would do that. I would help her clean her hearing aids. We’d 
brush her hair at the table. We’d floss her teeth at the table. I’d clean her ears if she needed it. What else? 
Then she would usually rest, and I would clean house. She would rest for an hour, and then I’d make lunch, 
and then we’d go through that whole process [laughing] again of getting her up and ready for lunch. So, yeah, 
the day would keep going like that. Anything she needed, I tried to be available to do. 
I: 
Whenever you take on a client as a self-employed caregiver, do you have to negotiate all of that sort 
of—like the job description, if you will. This is what I can do for you. This is what I’m not going to do for you 
[laughs]. 
P: 
Yeah. I think you do. But I also think there’s a lot of things that come up that you didn’t think about that 
you’re there by yourself with a client, and you have to decide can I do this or not, and if not, what am I gonna 
do [laughs]. So, I think there are things that the family doesn’t even know to talk about until you’re there for a 
while and you get to know each other. You know, like pet care. I mean, you know, I mean that’s just—you just 
can’t avoid some things that come up, and so you do things that are not on your list of tasks just to be helpful. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation where you’ve been asked to do something that you felt really 
uncomfortable with or it felt like it was crossing a line or crossing a boundary? 
P: 
There has, but I think I need to think about that for a minute and see if I can remember. 
I: 
I mean one of the things about—while you’re thinking about that—one of the things about being in a 
private home versus a nursing home where there’s other staff around to help if needed, if there’s an 
emergency, you can’t yell for the RN or push the call button. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation like that where there’s been kind of an emergency, and you know, 
there’s not back up help? What do you do? 
P: 
Yeah. Well, I try to establish a plan when I start working in the home [21.58], and I try to make sure I 
know exactly how the family wants me to follow up on emergencies, and I have that written down so that 
everybody can see it and any other aides that come in the house can see it. But, yeah, I had an incident the 
other day where I had to do the Heimlich on [laughs] this other client of mine, and she wasn’t feeling very 
secure afterwards, so I didn’t know if there was still something wrong. So, I did, I ended up calling the family, 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
12
but yeah, it’s concerning. If somebody falls in a bathtub or—you have to know what to do or what not to do, 
and usually it’s calling 911, and that’s very costly. 
I: 
You’ve had times like that where you’ve had to call 911? 
P: 
I’ve had—mmm hmm. 
I: 
Does one come to mind? Any particular story? 
P: 
Yes. I was walking a gentleman into his home in the winter. He uses a walker, and it was at night, and 
we had gone out for dinner, and going up the little steps he slipped and fell, and he was really complaining 
about his hip hurting, and I was too afraid to get him up. So, I did, I called 911 right away. 
I: 
And what happened? 
P: 
They took him in, and he was just bruised, but he could have broken his hip. He was elder, and I didn’t 
want to take the chance of trying to lift him up and get him in the house [20.25], so I covered him up with 
blankets and waited for them to come. You know, I tried to keep him warm, but waited for 911 to come help 
out. It’s scary. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation where you didn’t feel safe? Like going into a home where you didn’t 
really know what to expect or there are family members there that you hadn’t met before or, you know, a client 
maybe, particularly with dementia, maybe had behaviors that— 
P: 
I think dementia comes to mind. A lot of people will not want to open their door for you because they 
don’t know who you are. They don’t remember from yesterday that you were there, and you don’t look familiar. 
And then there are—when you get into the home, there’s so much paranoia about what are you doing here? 
You know, a lot of people think you might rob them, you might hurt them. They don’t really understand why 
you’re there because even if you talk to them about it, it doesn’t make sense. It should be a family member, 
somebody that they know. So, I’ve been very concerned with people with dementia. It’s very unpredictable, 
and people do get paranoid, and so they hide things, and they lose it. They can’t remember where they hid 
them, and then they accuse you, as the caregiver, of interfering and taking their things. So, then you’ve got that 
on your hands, you know, between the family and the client and— 
I: 
How do you handle that? 
P: 
[Laughing] it’s challenging. It’s really challenging. I think you have to go back to and talk about exactly 
what happened that day and what did they have in their hand, and what room did they go into, and they came 
out without the item in their hand, and you know, so you just have to trust that the family’s gonna believe you, I 
guess. You have to prove your trustworthiness right away to the family and to the client, and hope that if 
something does happen they’ll be more understanding to try to understand the story, you know. 
I: 
I’m gonna shift gears just a little bit, so why don’t we take a minute. 
I2: 
Perfect. 
I: 
You’re doing great, S. 
I2: 
That was a really good one. 
I: 
Is that gonna be a problem with that background noise? 
I2: 
So, this is mostly directly at her [17.38]. So, we’re getting some [inaudible], but it’s not a huge problem. 
I: 
Is there a way to cut that out? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
13
I2: 
Not a 100% no matter what, no matter what. 
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Like even if we had the lavaliers on both of you, you’re going to be the primary [inaudible], but some 
[inaudible] noise is gonna get picked up including the AC coming on or—but that’s okay. 
I: 
Okay. All right. 
I2: 
I’m excited for you to hear the sound quality because it’s great. 
I: 
Oh, good. So, what do you have time for, like one more block? 
I2: 
Let’s do that. Yeah. That’s perfect. 
I: 
Okay. Because these last questions are more about the bigger picture, you know, the political picture, 
context, social context. 
I2: 
Nice. How are you doing? 
I: 
Fine. We’re actually getting through most of the questions. Are we on? 
I2: 
Nope. 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I2: 
Okay. I am ready. 
I: 
Okay. Let’s shift gears just a little bit. You’ve done a great job of painting a picture for us, kind of a 
typical day in what a job as a PCA [15.27] might entail. Some of the challenges, but also some of the rewards, 
so I’m gonna switch just a little bit and look at the bigger picture. If there was anything you could change about 
your job as a PCA, what would it be? 
P: 
Well, the first thing I would I change is higher wagers, and I can’t afford to work even fulltime as a PCA 
right now. I would like to have some kind of retirement benefit. Some kind of benefits—health benefits, and you 
know, and I’d like more recognition. I’d like people to understand how important this job is, and I’ve been 
talking about this for 20 years. This job is so important, and people need to know that. People need to learn 
that, and I don’t really know how to get the word to people through our legislators or I don’t know how to do it. I 
don’t know who makes the changes in our rules, but, you know, I do, but I don’t know all the steps. But it needs 
to be recognized as an important job. I know many, many, many people—there are so many people in the age 
bracket that need this assistance, and we don’t have enough people to do that. 
I: 
And with the boomers coming along—they want to stay in their home. 
P: 
They want to be in their home, and they want to be independent, and we need to find a way to make 
this work [13.48]. 
I: 
Do you have any ideas on how to do that? Ideas about what would make it workable, doable? More 
wages, higher wages. 
P: 
Well, higher wages are very important, and to feel that you’re valued [13.32] in what you’re doing is 
another really important part of it. I think training is a necessity. I think we—I don’t think training should be 
mandatory, but I think there should be options. And, now, for me when I started this training or this work 20 
years ago, I didn’t have any money. I couldn’t have gone to a CNA training, so if there had been some kind of 
training like the one I went through—the BTBQ—I thought if there was a way that we could pay it back, you 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
14
know, we could have them pay for the training for us to go through the training, and then be able to pay it back, 
like a loan. 
I: 
So, how to make it affordable for the— 
P: 
How to make it affordable for— 
I: 
--for the worker. 
P: 
Right. And then to have some certification, you know, you’ve gone through the program. There should 
be some benefits of going through the program, and the training. Whether you get moved up in your position, if 
you’re at a facility, if your wages improve, they go up because you have had this extra training, and you have 
put that extra time in. That’s very important, and it’s going to be so much better for everybody—the clients, the 
families, people that are working with them, if everybody has some kind of training [12.04]. Yeah. 
I: 
So, those are some of the key changes that you think would improve— 
P: 
I do. 
I: 
--the situation. Do you anticipate leaving this work ever? 
P: 
I anticipate cutting down on the work. I think I have my own physical limitations right now. I’ve had an 
auto accident. I had another accident with my wrist where I was unable to work for a year and a half in home 
health because of that. So, yeah, I think I’m always gonna be in home health helping out, but it will be not 
fulltime. I’m just not able to do that.  
I: 
It sounds like you might also choose your clients a little differently where you might be doing more 
companion work. 
P: 
More companion work. 
I: 
Versus the hands-on, transferring, and things like that. 
P: 
Right. And I’m working with people now, too, where I can—they are transferred to an appointment 
through a Spectran process, and I meet them at appointments, and I go in with them, and I take notes, and I 
help them get undressed or whatever they might need while they’re at the appointment. And then I make sure 
they get back on the bus, you know, so I’m more of a companion at appointments, and that’s real important 
too. A lot of people don’t have family or friends to come with them to appointments, and they might not know 
how to get to their doctor’s office, and how to navigate all those things. 
I: 
And I’m guessing that, you know, people will so, “Oh, you’re just a companion,” but that being a 
companion actually has it’s own set of skills. If you’re going to doctor’s appointments with people, and helping 
them negotiate, you know, the medication orders and the— 
P: 
I know. All those decisions [10.11]. 
I: 
All the doctor-speak, and. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. So, that really should have some training too, you know. 
I: 
Are there certain supports that you feel you or other personal care workers might need? Is some of the 
tasks that you’re talking about—well, for example, some of them require a car—that you have a car, and gas. 
P: 
Right. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
15
I: 
And gas money, and if wages are a problem, then it must be difficult to get some of those, you know, to 
have some of the resources you need in order to be successful at your job. 
P: 
Yes. I do believe that. 
I: 
So, are there resources that would make this job easier for you or make you more successful in it? 
P: 
I think the training, like I said, is really important. I think I would like to see some social groups for 
caregivers in the area, so that you can get together and discuss with other caregivers, you know, what they’re 
going through, and what they’ve learned, and how they handle certain situations. I’d like to see some more—it 
would be nice to have some mental health instruction even if that was included—it was included with the 
BTBQ. We did touch on that. I’d like to see that expanded [8.39]. 
I: 
So more [inaudible] information about dementia— 
P: 
All those different mental health issues that you don’t a lot of times know what you’re walking into in a 
home. 
I: 
You mentioned support, like a support group or discussion group, do you have friends or colleagues 
that do this kind of work that you can share tips with, or hey, this is happening. How did you handle it? 
P: 
I never have. 
I: 
No? 
P: 
I never have. Uh-uh. 
I: 
Are there any associations or groups like that that you are aware of? 
P: 
Not that I’m aware of [laughs]. I don’t think there are—I’ve never heard of a group. 
I: 
So, it’s difficult not to have somebody to bounce ideas off. 
P: 
It is, especially when you’re not getting any training. You’re just trying to understand and learn on your 
own as you go. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. If you did leave this field, what kind of work would you do? 
P: 
Well, I’m not real sure yet. I really love the companionship work, so I’m hoping that I can stick with that. 
Another area that I’ve realized that is challenging for people is there’s a lot of people in our community that 
don’t speak a lot of English, and they have, you know, that barrier [7.17]. So, I’m going to take Spanish. I’m 
learning Spanish, so I can be more bi-lingual, and help people. You know, assist people that don’t speak a lot 
of English. 
I: 
One of the reasons I ask that question, and what I’m hearing from you—I often hear people say, “Well, 
direct care workers can’t make it because of the low wages. And they see signs at McDonald’s for $15 an hour, 
and so, you know, why wouldn’t they just go work at McDonalds?” But what I’m hearing from you is that you’re 
not going to go get a job at McDonalds. That doesn’t appeal to you.  
P: 
No. 
I: 
That you feel drawn to this field in particular—the helping field. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You’re not gonna go to McDonald’s just because you can make twice as much money. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
16
P: 
Exactly. 
I: 
Is that true? 
P: 
That’s very true. I guess I think a lot—selfishly I kind of think about myself too. I think, how would I want 
this to happen if this was me that needed the assistance [6.13]? How would I want somebody to treat me? And 
I just know there’s a lot of abuse out there and different things, and I think we just need good training. We need 
more people. I don’t think I’d change—in some way I’m gonna be involved with home care. If it’s not doing all 
the physical lifting and hands on, even if I’m just a companionship, I think I’ll continue with that if I can afford it, 
you know. If the wages do improve, and I can find the work. 
I: 
You mentioned that you want to get a message out to the legislators, the powers that be, and let’s say 
the Governor was sitting right here or a legislator who— 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
--had the power to make some decisions about home care, what would you say to them? Anything 
goes. You’re permitted to say whatever you want to this person. 
P: 
Okay. Well, I would probably start by saying that I’m glad that you’re here that I can voice my opinion, 
finally, and tell you how important this work is, and that I hope that you will listen to stories and what’s really 
going on with home health in our country, and how much we need it, and there are changes that need to be 
done. And we can’t wait. You know, the changes need to be done now.  We need to attract more people [4.31] 
into this field, and we need good people. We need people that have experience, that have training that have 
the personality to do this kind of work—men and women of all ages could be helpful in this line of work. So, I’m 
not sure what I would say [laughing] except if there’s a way that I can be involved in the legislation, you know, 
changing awareness in our communities, and getting the word out to different legislators, how important it is, 
then I think, you know, I’d be more than happy to do that. Get a group of people together that could actually 
talk with others and explain to them how they feel, and how important this work is. I think that’s probably how I 
would address the conversation. 
I: 
I think we have to find a way for you to speak from the heart and to sort of touch their hearts as well. 
P: 
Yeah. Right. 
I: 
And how about advice for us and this project. As we go around and talk to other personal care workers, 
what do you think are the key points that we should be asking about, that we should be trying to elevate so that 
other people can hear what you’re trying to say? 
P: 
Well, I would like to know—I think I’d like to know more about if people feel qualified for the work that 
they’re doing? Are they doing a lot of work that they haven’t been trained to do? Are they—and how do they 
manage that? I’d like to know why they’re interested in the kind of work, I think, and how do they personally 
handle it mentally? You know, how do they handle all the things that come up on a daily basis with so many 
different people and so many different conditions? How do they deal with that? And do they get help from other 
people? 
I: 
That’s great advice, and it makes me want to ask maybe just one more question because you said that 
you were interested in a support group or a community of PCAs who could talk to each other, and that is 
something that we hope will come out of this. The establishment of, you know, forming a group like that.  
P: 
Uh-huh. Okay. 
I: 
And if you had a group like that, how would you use it? What would you want to get out of it? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Susan Fierro. Lansing. 11.29.17
17
P: 
I think we can learn a lot from each other, and I think knowing that we have support and that we have 
people to listen and bounce ideas back and forth and come up with new strategies. Some things work for 
others that don’t work for certain people, and I think we could learn a lot from each other if we met on a regular 
basis and got to know one another and felt safe [1.19]. That’d be very helpful. 
I: 
I said that was my last question, but I lied. I do have one more. Is there anything else that we haven’t 
covered that you would like to share with us, any—a story that comes to mind, that illustrates everything we’ve 
been talking about or any final thoughts? 
P: 
Right off hand [laughing] I can’t think of anything. 
I: 
No? That’s okay. 
P: 
I’m not sure. 
I: 
I think we’ll have a chance to talk again. We had talked about the possibility of maybe meeting one of 
your clients. 
P: 
Okay. That would be nice. 
I: 
Because it would be so wonderful and helpful to see this whole experience from their point of view as 
well, so I hope that we can make that happen. 
P: 
Good. 
I: 
In the meantime, K, do you have anything else? 
I2: 
No. I’m good. Thank you so much. I know this takes a lot of effort, so. 
P: 
Thank you. Thank you for being here and thank you for being interested. 
I: 
Very much so. 
P: 
And wanting to hear people’s stories. 
I: 
Well, thank you for being willing to share it. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
So, I think we’ll bring the interview to a close, and then, K, you wanted to do some still photos, right?

Yup. 
I: 
Okay. Great.
