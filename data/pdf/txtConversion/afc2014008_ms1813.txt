Mr. Macauley has returned and has agreed that since internegatives of BUCK DANCER
 
and BRIGHT STAR SHINING IN GLORY exist, we will agree to distribute them and to
 
publish one announcement describing both films.
 
Our distribution agreement is enclosed.  While I am on vacation you will have at
 
least until November 1 to work out the details.
 Please complete it in pencil rough
 
draft form and do not sign it; return it to me and I will prepare and send you the
 
final version for signature.
 
Meanwhile, I see no reason why you should not announce that the films will be
 
distributed by the
 
University of California Extension Media Center
 
Berkeley, CA 94720
 
for rental, sale, and preview-before-purchase, but I think it would be best if you
 
made it clear that inquiries can be sent to us now although the films will not be
 
available until "later."  As you know, it can take weeks to complete distribution
 
arrangements and more weeks to obtain a satisfactory answer print from a new lab.
 
I
'm sorry it won't be possible for us to publish something for you by the AAA date.
 
The prints of the films that we screened in February 1970 were 11 minutes and 6
 
minutes.
 If you think it important to announce prices, they will be priced at $6
 
per minute.  The 11 minute one would sell for $65 and rent for $7; the 6 minute one
 
would sell for $35 and rent for $7.
 If you wanted to distribute them as an
 
inseparable package on one reel, they would become a 17 minute film selling for $100
 
and renting for $9.  Perhaps we need not mention prices just yet.
 
I
'm so glad we will be able to handle these films for you!
 
Cordially,
 
EXTENSION MEDIA CENTER

you remember?  Your main objection at the time was that they had said that the
 
could not get out a brochure on the films.
 I al so  told them there was a possib l
il
 
(since fallen through) that I could show the f
liris a

Anyway,  they responded as pci
 
vinced;  they have done,  it seems to me, a very unaggressive job of marketing Pizz:
 
(which, by now, I want to re-edit and they don't); however,  it also seems to m
e
 
very depressing that you and I and Alan have the only copies of those beautiful
 
films.

 It would have been fun to see you, and Joan

Dear Bess:
 
I had kkH  Tom Brandon up yesterday.  He's the retired and liberal
 
owner of Brandon Films.
 He liked the Sea Island and Buck Dancer films
 
and took them off to study and decide which company to sell them to.
 
He feels sure that they will sell.  H 1
 He'll let
 i ow.
 
I have a great young film researcher stu ying footage in L.A. for me
 
and would like her to look through the outs of the Sea Island material
 
for some continuous dance sequences.  She'll call you and please do
 
that, if possible.  Though it's not worth killing yourself over, however.

I talked to j6 w man
 who expressed interest in the Sea Island chorus,
 
___
 It's'our bad luck that he's in collaboration with Willie
 
Ruff S
 of Yale  and is going to consider now whether he can still go
 
on with it, letting me know
 on Tuesday.  Life is horribly hectic
 
with this film business and I don't have nearly enough time for research.
 
Otherwise I
'm healthy.
 
The news from Houston i
s that Margaret i
s very happy in tie hospital and
 
John is very happy to be away from Houston.
 I think they have been needing
 
a vacation from each other.

Dear led
 
As I said I would during our breakfast together a month ago,
 
the media Center people to see if they were still interested in
 
Buck Dancer and Bright Star.
 I am enclosing a xerox of their rep
.
 
What do you think?  They have a huge catalogue of various educati
i
 
films including twenty or thirty anthropological ones, and they S 0
 
to set up displays of their wares at most of the big meetingss but
 
they dè not seem to resemble balls of fire when confronted with t
i
 
job of actually peddling films.
 They have done reasonably well w
 
Pizza Pizza, but I
'll bet I have sold more copies than they have.
 
dowever, they are respectable, honest and are not likely to go b * - 
rupt, I shouldn't think, even with the present governor's budge
 
)
low-and-solid is their style.
 
If you think this is the best route to go,  I
'll get in touch wit -
what's-his-name and see if he can send theta the original stuffs  .
L
 
don't understand about that internegatives business, but no doubt
 
he and you will.  On the other hand, if you think you have a hottr r
 
connection with the firm you mentioned in New York, let's do that
 
all means.
 The main thing, from my point of view, is to get the fi
l
l,
 
by any means possible.
 For one thing, I
lia showing both of
 
them this November by special invitation before the American Music
 
logical Association and the Society for Ethnological Music in the
 
serried ranks assembled for a joint national meeting at Chapel k
it';.
 
It would be nice to be able to cav then thit hot-h fit'ns are SVRI
L
 
through a distribution firm.
 
Let me know what you think aii

I got a phone call from Counts he really does seem to be coining bac
 
to VSC.  His father died, bytthe Way, after a tong illness.  A long
 
letter also from Joans she is planning to take a sabbatical year-aft'r
 
next in Africat as usual, she is full of ideas and gisin.
 I find, o
r
 
looking around me, that I am a living example of the Peter Principi:;
 
since I am a pretty fair teacher and writer and enjoy both,  I am beinp
 
inexorably pushed out of both activities and into more and more admin-
istrative paper-diddling, at which I am both inefficient and neuroti-
cally indecisive so that everything takes me twice as long as it shou'
 
The only thing to do,  I have decided, is to change m
ay images  I intend
 
to start smoking cigars and drinking heavily before and during facult
 
meetings and telling everybody what I really think.

)ear Ted:
 
finally reached Noel Korn this morning;  he is almost as hard to
 
track down as I am.
 He said,  among other things,  that he had gotten
 
i letter from Al Sans asking him to turn over Pedlar of Poesy,
 
orcerer and College to to Stan Salter of CFI and had done so.
 I
 
hope this doesn't mess things up for you;  he seemed to feel that even
 
f you wanted them to go to Pyramid Films, Salter would cooperate.
 
rop me a line if you want me to take care of this for you;  I promise
 
o be more prompt next time.
 
oel also wants a note from you and another from Alan authorizing him
 
o turn over the Sea Island film stuff to me,  so I am enclosing one
 
r your signature.
 If you don't like it, write another; my feelings
 
ill not be hurt in the least.
 Noel also advised me strongly to have
 
oe more go with the College Foundation and see if I can persuade
 
them to set up a special fund for black scholarships or the like into
 
which royalty moneys from Pizza can go.
 This would relieve me from
 
the necessity of dealing with Media Center at all, and perhaps I could
 
eventually persuade Pyramid or Contemporary (Noel's
uggestion) to
 
handle it.
 The Media Center people are so un-aggres
ve.
 Did you write
 
me that Pyramid had turned down the Sea Island stuff?\(

Since you are a man for great stories, I pass along the latest from
 
Naomi,  currently in Kathmandu on a resupplying trip:
 
On a political science theme, nothing has radically changed
 
since the death of his beloved majesty, King Makendra,  except
 
that the black market money changers were all thrown in jail
 
to allow the new King the opportunity of choosing and making his
 
own deals with the new black market money changers, and the local
 
paper (a palace mouthpiece) now has every page filled with messages
 
of condolence for the sudden demise of King M. and felicitations
 
for the new King.
 John and I are considering sending ours in;  each
 
person gets a headline and their own story.
 Just to set the record
 
straight for those of you on the outside who are subject to the
 
palace censorship -
-
 on the 9th day after the death, a Brahmin
 
did eat part of the deceased King's brain (as prescribed by reli-
gious protocol)  and was stoned out of town as he rode off on the
 
elephant he was given as payment.
 After this was announced,  the
 
palace quickly denied it but it is true.
 Apparently the Brahmin
 
and his family lose their caste forever,  so it is not the most
 
sought-after privilege,  but he is compensated with an elephant,
 
the King's crown and a vast sum of rupees.
 The new King looks
 
more like Peter Sellers than his father did, and word has it that
 
they had to set up a special course for visiting monarchs at
 
Harvard to get him through...
 
Shades of the Golden Bough; how that marvellous old compendium of mis-
information does hold up,  to be sure...
 My very best always  to you and
 
Addie,
 
Love,

I apologize for not wiswertug your re u sL car
 i
r,
 u  
died just before Christmas, and I
'm afraid I neglected a
 
things during the subsequent months.
 
I
'm also sorry to tell you that none of the materials you as Kea uoL
 
are immediately available, though I hope they all will be in the nea
 
future.  There are two films which might be of interest to you
 
)
ancer which shows a Mississippi cane f
 if player, Ed Young, accomnpar
 
by hand -clapping by the Georgia Sea I
sland Singers, and Bright Star
  
Shining In Glory, a film of the religious music and shouts of the
 
Sea I
slanders.
 Both are unavailable for general distribution, s
i
 
there are only two copies in existence; but I have just arrange
 
their distribution through the Media Cent e, University Etunsic
.
 
i
iversity of California, Berkeley, California.
 When the master
 
t
:ives have been sent to the Media Center people and they have m
n
 
prints for circulation (a process which will take several n
orth-
,
',
 
afraid), you can write Donna Lee Smith at the above a
 
will send you all the information on renting the filmr
 
o film Yonder Comes Day which you mention was made u
 
otage from the other two films and titled simply for our storage
 
invenience.
 I suppose Forrestine Paulay must have seen it on a '
 
to our campus but, since there is only one copy and
 
anyway, it is not available for general distributio
 
Now for the book you asked about.
 Itle title is St 
ays, Songs and Stories from the Afro-American Heritage; it was r
 
thorod by Bessie Jones and myself.
 The publishers are Harper a
t
 
w, and they tell I
nc it will be out in April or May at a cost, I
'
 
raid,of ten dollars.
 I hope it's worth it; it does contain a g
 
al of information of interest to a dancer.
 I also hope, when y
 
c it, you'll write me what you think.
 It's i
