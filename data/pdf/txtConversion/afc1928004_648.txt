THE BLACKBIRD. 
EDWARD HARRIGAN in the Great Irish Drama, entitled 
`• THE BLACKBIRD ." 
"I‘ was on one summer's morning 
For soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
beauteous maiden 
A—making a 
sad moan. 
My thoughts they did deceive me, 
Reflection did grieve me, 
And I 
am overburden'd 
With sad, sad misery. 
But if death should ever blind me, 
As true love now inclines me, 
My blackbird 
seek out. 
Wherever he may be. 
Once on a 
time in England 
My blackbird did flourish; 
He was the bonniest flower 
That e'er in it did spring. 
But oh, that cruel fortune 
Has proven so uncertain, 
That caused the bitter' parting 
Between both you and me. 
His blessed name I 
will advance, 
In Spain, Portugal or France, 
And seek out my blackbird 
Wherever he may be. 
I'm sobbing and sighing 
With sad lamentation, 
All because my blackbird 
Most royal he has flown. 
It is not the wildest ocean 
Can frighten me with danger, 
Although life is a 
pilgrim, 
I 
wander all forlorn. 
But ye'll find more friendship 
From them that is a 
stranger, 
My blessings on my blackbird 
Wherever he has gotie.

JOHN COPE, 
OR THE BATTLE OF PRESTON. 
As sung in the Great Irish Drama, entitled " THE BLACKBIRD.'' 
The blair in trumpet sounded far, 
And horsemen rode weel graithed for war, 
While Sir John Cope marched fru Dunbar 
Upon a 
misty morning. 
Prince Charlie wi' his Highland host. 
Lay west" ard on the Lothian coast; 
But Johnnie bragged wi' mony a 
boast 
He'd rout them ere neist morning! 
Lang ere the cock proclaimed it day, 
The Prince's men stood in array, 
And, though impatient for the fray, 
Bent low the knee Hutt morning, 
When row-dow roll'd the English drum, 
The Highland bagpipe gied a 
bum, 
And told the mountain clans had come, 
Grim death and danger scorning. 
Ilk hand was firm—ilk heart was true; 
A shot! and down their guns they threw; 
Then forth their dree claymores they drew, 
Upon that fearfu' morning. 
The English raised a 
loud huzza, 
But durstna bide the brunt ava: 
They wavered—turned—syne ran awa'; 
Like sheep at shepherd's warning. 
Past—fast their foot and horsemen flew, 
And caps were mixed wi' bonnets blue. 
And dirks were wet—but no wi' dew 
Upon that dreadfu' morning. 
Few stay'd, save ae devoted band— 
To bide the blow frae Highland brand, 
That swept around—and heart and hand 
Lopp'd, on that bluidy morning. 
What sad mishaps that few befell! 
When faint had grown the battle's yell 
Still Gardiner fought—and fighting fell, 
Upon that awesome morning. 
Nae braggart—but a 
sedge'. he. 
Wha' scorn'd wi coward loons to flee; 
Sae fell aneath the wuld-thorn tree, 
Upon that fatal morning!

Mr 
sweetheart's a 
sly little fairy, 
Her age it is just seventeen, 
Her parents think that she's too airy, 
But a 
sweeter girl never was seen. 
At night she steals out from the cottage, 
Her mother cries after her " Kate," 
She answers, " Dear ma, I'm not going far, 
I'm just going down to the gate!" 
CaOnns. 
I'm just going down to the gate, dear ma, 
Just down to the old garden gate, 
The moon is so bright and it's such a 
nice :Light, 
I'll just go as far as the gate. 
Of course at the gate I 
am waiting, 
And sweet are the words that we say, 
While inside the old folks are debating, 
As to whether they'll move first of May. 
Sometimes they call gently for Katie; 
She answers, " Dear ma, ' tis not late, 
There's no sign of storm, and the night is so warm, 
I 
love to stand here by the gate!" 
I'm just going down, etc. 
They say she's too young to be married, 
But with them we do not agree; 
Love's message to Katie I 
carried, 
And a 
kiss was the answer for me! 
We'll wander alone in the moonlight, 
Much longer I'm sure we can't wait; 
Some night, by and by, to the preacher's we'll fly, 
When Katie comes down to the gate! 
I'm just going down, etc.

IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEILL, with great success. 
Don't .
L
-tall me weak minded, perchance I 
should sing,1 
Of the dearest old spot upon the earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth. 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers -would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list and 
give you an Irishman's toast.' 
Cuonus. 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill. 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
Here's to the land, etc. 
" 
THE WOLF AT THE _ DOOR." 
Recitbd by THOS. H. and LOTTIE W INNETT. 
Hark! how the merciless cold winds blow! 
" 
Mamma, come look at the beautiful snow; 
See how the streets are all mantled in white, 
I'm u 
looking for papa—he'll come home all right. 
Oh! why are you looking so lonely and sad? 
I 
know papa drinks, but can't I 
make you glad? 
Come! kiss me, mamma, and don't weep any more." 
"Hush! come to my anus, there's a wolf at the 
door." 
" 
Mamma, don't cry; let me kneel at your feet 
We are hungry and cold and have nothing to eat. 
Look up, and be cheerful, in God put your trust, 
if papa is a 
drunkard God will not blame us. 
Why do you tremble so? 
Wipe off that tear; 
The fire is out, but we've nothing to fear. 
Let's lay down together and sleep on the floor." 
"No! no! there's no sleep while the wolf is at the 
door." 
" 
Oh, mammal God bless you! cheer up all you can, 
Some day I may be a 
good son and a 
man 
To bring to your sorrowful heart hope and joy. 
If papa's a 
drunkard, just think I'm your boy. 
Though he may desert us there's one left us' still 
Who'll never forsake us—no! God. never will." 
"Hush, child! there's your father, don't say a 
word 
more. 
Great God! can't he see there's a 
wolf at the door?" 
Aye! staggering drunk at that hour so late, 
The father stood reeling in snow at the gate; 
His barefooted boy, dressed so poorly and thin, 
'Went out in the snow and led — papa" in. 
But just as he entered he fell on the floor 
And there went forth a 
howl from the wolf at the 
door. 
The emblem of death to the door knob was tied, 
A husband—a 
father— a 
drunkard had died.

THE WARNING OF THE SPIDER. 
Sung with great success by J. W. GIBBONS, in all the principal 
theatres. 
I'm not a 
very nervous man, or easily deceived, 
But had I 
not heard this myself, I 
would not have 
believed 
That it was true, but DOW I 
do, for I 
am satisfied, 
With what I heard the very night on which my 
father died. 
CHORUS. 
Tick, tick, tick, was distinctly heard by all, 
Tick, tick, tick, I 
heard inside the wall, 
I 
thought ' twas only fancy, but now I'm satisfied, 
With what I heard the very night on which my 
father died. 
The day that dad was taken sick, the bird it ceased to 
sing, 
But gently sat upon its per 
s ead beneath its 
wing; 
The cat it wandered from the 
use, the parrot 
ceased to squall, 
But still I 
heard the ticking of the spider in the 
wall. 
Tick, tick, tick, etc. 
At first I 
thought it was the clock, and stopped it

D THE LAMB. 
THE WOLF AN 
By BOBBY Nirwcome. 
rder in the court! 
Witness, take the stand; 
Do you solemnly swear? 
Hold up your right hand. 
Kiss the book—that will do. 
Now, tell the court 
Why this man, your husband, before me is brought,* 
Your Honor, you see I'm tired and weak, 
So much so that really I 
scarcely can speak; 
I'm sorry that Tim was arrested last night, 
But you see he is foolish and often gets tight. 
A 
good husband, your honor, sure I 
don't wish to tell— 
This bruise on my cheek? Why, your honor, 
fell! 
Have I 
children? 
Ah, bless them, they've both pass-
ed away; 
Did they die of bunger? 
Sure I'd rather not say." 
Last night Tim n 
was tipsy, sure that was too bad, 
And he beat and he kicked me, but then he was mad, 
'Twas the neighbors who had him arrested, not me; 
He won't do it again, so let him go free. 
And turning her eyes to the brute in the pen, 
She said: " Tim, you won't, darling, ever strike me 
again? 
But his eyes glared fiercely, a 
broad oath he swore, 
With a 
bound he had reached her, struck her down 
to the floor! 
"Bring him here!" thundered Justice, 
"I regret I've not the power to send you for life—to 
the very last hour; 
see that she's cared for. 
Take him quickly from 
here, 
lie's fined fifty dollars, and sentenced one y 
gar!"

THE WIDOW'S MESSAGE TO HER SON. 
By ELLEN FORRESTER, and recited by C. 
P. 
HYLAND. 
Remember, Dennis, all I 
bade you say, 
Tell hint we're well and happy, thank the Lord; 
But of all our troubles since he went away, 
You'll mind, avick, and never say a 
word. 
Of cares and troubles sure we've had our share, 
The finest summer isn't always fair. 
Tell him the spotted heifer calved in May, 
She died, poor thing, but that you needn't mind, 
Nor how the constant rain destroyed the hay; 
But tell hint God to us was ever kind, 
And when the fever spread the country o'er 
His mercy kept the sickness from our door. 
Be sure you tell hint how the neighbors came 
And cut the corn and stored it in the barn; 
'Twould be as well to in mtion them by name— 
Pat Murphy, Ned McCabe, and James AloCara, 
And big Tint Dilly, from behind the hill; 
But say, agra, oh, say, I 
missed him still. 
They came with ready hands our toil to share, 
'Twas then I 
missed hint most—my own right hand. 
I 
felt, although kind hearts were round me there, 
The kindest heart beat in a 
foreign land. 
Strong hand, brave heart, oh, severed far from me ., 
By many a 
weary league at shore and sea. 
And tell him she was with us--he'll know who-
Ma,vourneen, hasn't she the winsome eyes? 
The darkest, deepest, brightest, bonniest blue 
I 
ever saw except in summer skies; 
And such black hair, it is the blackest hair 
That ever rippled over neck so fair. 
Tell him old Pincher fretted many a 
day, 
And moped, poor dog, ' twas well he didn't diai 
Crouched by the roadside he watched the way, 
And sniffed the travelers as they passed him by; 4 
Hail, rain, or sunshine, sure ' twas all the same, 
He listened for the foot that never came. 
Ten him the house is lonesome like and cold, 
The tire itself seems robbed of half its life; , 
But maybe 'tis my eyes are growing old, 
And things look dim before my failing sight; 
For all that, tell him 'twas myself that spun 
The shirts you bring him, and stitched them, ever, 
one. 
Give him my blessing morning. noon, and night, 
Tell him my prayers are offered for his good, 
That be may keep his Maker still in sight, 
And firmly stand, as his brave father stood, 
True to his name, his country, and his God, 
Faithful at home and steadfast still abroad.

WHERE THE SHAMROCK GROWS. 
As sung by DAISY REMLNGTON. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit-for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But 
throw back that villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
Cnonus. 
Pat may be foolish, and very often wrong. 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity, as everybody knows. 
But there never was a coward where the shamrock 
grows. 
Tho' oppressed and insulted for hundred's of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they- cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we held dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. 
Pat may be foolish, 
to.

Lingers in that beauteous vale.

"Oh, what a

They're jealous, ev 'ry one, 
They know she's queen when she is seen, 
They're stars but she's the sun. • 
She's to be mine, her form's divine, 
As all the world can see, 
Her loveliness and her tight dress 
Have quite enchanted me.

WILLIAms. 
Sister of Charity, gentle and dutiful, 
Loving as seraphim, tender, and mild, 
In humblenes s 
strong, and in purity beautiful, 
In spirit heroic, in manners a 
child. 
Ever thy love like an angel reposes, 
With hovering wings o'er the sufferer here, 
Till the arrows of death are half-hidden in roses, 
And hope- speaking prophecy smiles on the bier. 
When life, like a 
vapor is slowly retiring, 
As clouds in the dawning to heav'n uprolled, 
Thy prayer, like a 
herald, precedes him expiring, 
And the cross on thy bosom his last looks behold: 
And oh! as the Spouse to the words of love list,eis. 
What hundredfold blessings descend on thee th—F---
Thus the flower-absorbed dew in the bright iris 
glist ens, 
And returns to the lilies more richly again. 
Sister of Charity, child of the holiest, 
Oh, for thy living soul, ardent as pure— 
Mother of orphans and friend of the lowliest— 
Stay of the wretched, the guilty, the poor; 
The embrace of the Godhead so plainly enfolth, thee, 
Sanctity's halo so shrines thee around, 
Daring the eye that unshrinking beholds thee. 
Nor droops in thy presence abashed to the ground. 
Dim is the fire of the sunniest blushes. 
Burning the breast of the maidenly rose 
To the exquisite bloom that thy pale beauty flushes: 
When the incense ascends and the sanctuary glows

THE SISTER OF CHARITY. 
(Concluded.) 
And the music, that seems heaven's language, is 
pealing— 
Adoration has bowed him in silence and sighs, 
And limn, intermingled with angels, is feeling 
The passionless rapture that comes from the skies. 
Oh, that this heart, whose unspeakable treasure 
Of love hath been wasted so vainly on clay, 
Like thine, unallured by the phantom of pleasure, 
Could rend every earthly affection away. 
And yet, in thy presence, the billows subsiding 
Obey the strong effort of reason and will, 
And my soul, in her pristine tranquility gliding 
Is calm as when God bid the ocean be still. 
Thy soothing, how gentle! thy pity, how tender! 
Choir music thy voice is—thy step angel grace. 
And thy union with deity shrines in a 
splendor 
Subdued, but unearthly, thy spiritual face. 
When the frail chains are broken, a captive that 
bound thee 
Afar from thy home is the prison of clay. 
Bride of the Lamb, and earth's shadows around 
thee 
Disperse hi the blaze of eternity's day. 
Still mindful, as now, of the sufferer's story, 
Arresting the thunders of wrath ere they roll, 
intervene, as a 
cloud between us and his glory, 
And shield from his lightnings the shuddering soul. 
As mild as the moonbeam in autumn descending, 
That lightning, extinguished by mercy, shall fall, 
While he hears with the wail of a penitent blending 
Thy prayer, Holy Daughter of Vincent de Paul. 
SONG FOR THE SHAMROCK BOYS. 
Sung by CRONIN and SULLIVAN. 
AIR—" The Weariag of the Green." 
Again returns the welcome day so dear to Erin's 
heart— 
A day that wakens lofty thoughts, bids holy mem'ries 
start; 
As smiles our country through her tears, we, too, 
though far away, 
Will join our hearts and hopes -with hers upon St. 
Patrick's Day. 
Our land—alas! no nation now—we cannot call oux 
own; 
Of all the glories of the past her faith remains alone: 
But, strong in that, with earnest hearts to Freedom's 
God we'll pray 
To heal her wounds and right her wrongs upon St. 
Patrick's Day. 
Oh! may our homeless, exiled race, though drifted 
far apart, 
To-day united, only know one aim, one soul, one 
heart.: 
One earnest wish to rise in might and rend the chains 
away 
That bind our country's free-born limbs this bright 
St. Patrick's day. 
The grand old days when Patrick dwelt upon our 
native soil, 
The days when Irish homes enjoyed the fruits of 
Irish toil; 
The relics of a 
glorious past, sublime amid decay, 
Show what we were, and yet may be, upon St. Pat-
rick's Day. 
Prove to the world ' tis falsely said you never can 
unite; 
Drown not the shamrock, drown yolir feuds, and join 
for Ireland's right; 
Together naught can crush you down, and soon no 
tyrant's sway 
Shall blight our land or blast her homes upon St, 
Patrick's Day.

Written land sang with great succcss by H ENRY CARNZYt at 
Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
There's a 
day that comes but once a 
year—the 17th of March, 
And upon it every Irishman is drinking , 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they play! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking. 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock in our button holes adorning ; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamreck don't be scorning; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky; 
He's a 
coin or two to spen,i, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night he goes to bed feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning; 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " Beclad," he cries, 
It's St. Patrick's day in the morning " 
Then shout hurrah, eve. 
And when parade begins, och, it's murther for our shins, 
Such hustling and bustling and sqoeezing;

So there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the band and pipes are blow in' to the chine of _ 64

PATRICK SHEEHAN. 
By CHARLES J. 
KIcsnam. 
gy name is Patrick Sheehan, 
My years are thirty-four, 
Tipperary is my native place, 
Not far from Galtymore; 
I 
came of honest parents— 
But now they're lying low— 
And many a 
pleasant day I 
spent 
in the Glen of Aherlow. 
My father died, I 
closed his eyes 
Outside our cabin- door— 
The landlord and the sheriff tors 
Were there the day before—. 
And then my loving mother, 
And sisters three also, 
Were forced to go with broken hearts 
From the Glen of Alierlow. 
For three long months, in search of work, 
I 
wandered far and near; 
I 
went then to the poor-house 
For to see my mother dear; 
The news I 
heard nigh broke my heart, 
But still, in all my woe, 
I 
blessed the friends who made their graves 
In the Glen of Aherlow. 
Bereft of home, and kith, and kin— 
With plenty all around— 
I 
starved within my cabin, 
And slept upon the ground; 
But cruel as my lot was, 
I 
ne'er did hardship know, 
Till I 
joined the English Army, 
Far away from Aherlow. 
"Rise up there," says the Corporal, 
"You lazy Hirish hound; 
Why don't you hear, you sleepy dog. 
The call • to arms' sound?"

PATRICK SHEEHAN. 
(Concluded.) 
Alas, I 
had been dreaming 
Of days long, long ago, 
I 
woke before Sebastopol, 
And not in Aherlow. 
I 
groped to find my musket— 
How dark I 
thought the night. 
0 blessed God, it was not dark, 
It was the broad daylight! 
And when I 
found that I 
was blind, 
- 
My tears began to flow, 
I 
longed for even a 
pauper's grave 
In the Glen of Aherlow. 
0 
blessed Virgin Mary, 
Mine is a 
mournful tale, 
A poor blind prisoner here I 
am, 
In Dublin's dreary jail; 
Struck blind within the trenches, 
Where I 
never feared the foe; 
And now 
never see again 
My own sweet Aherlow! 
A poor neglected in 
I 
wandered through the street. 
My nine months' pension being cut, 
I 
beg from all I 
meet: 
As I 
joined my eountry's tyrants, 
My face I'll never show 
Among the kind old neighbors, 
In the Glen of Aherlow. 
Thew Irish youths-----dear conntrymen— 
Tal.ze le7.ed or what I 
say, 
I.'or if you join the English ranis 
You'll surely rue the day; 
And whenever you are tempted 
A 
soldiering to go,

WHEN I

Tender and bare as a

Out to the door shure I 
looked with a 
steady face, 
Who but Pat 3Iurrhy, the piper, came by; 
Sari Paddy there's few plays the music can you play, 
Says I 
don't know for I 
never did try, 
And he told me had a 
fiue charm, 
To make the pips pretti y 
speak ; 
And he put the bag under his arm, 
And yelled out with a 
beautiful squeak. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
whack fal de dal, de dal da, 
Oh how he handles the grow', 
And such beautiful music be blew, 
It would have melted the hcart of a 
stone. 
Full five years I 
followed him, nothing could sunder us., 
Till he one morning had taken 6. sup, 
lie slipped from the bridge to the river just under us, 
And went to the bottom just like a 
blind pup, 
I 
roared out, I 
bawled out, I 
heartily calls 1 
out, 
Oh Paddy, my friend, don't you mean to come up. 
He was dead as a 
nail on the door, 
Poor Pad3y was placed on the ahelf, 
So I 
took up the pipes on the shore, 
And now I 
set up for myself. 
With a 
whaelt fal de dal, &c.

Saint Patrick was a 
gentlemen, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the Seventeenth of March, 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A bran new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly mad. 
The left foot first then lightly tread, 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain and snow, 
We'd face the devil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin-go-bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation. 
Stars and stripes and shamrock bright arrayed, 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration, 
We march stiff as starch, 
the Patrick's day parade.

PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
he'd break each lady's heart; 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen, 
Are always warm and dry ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the devil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a

And though I'm not a

MY DARLING COUNTY CLARE. 
Sang with unbounded applause by Mr. J. P. SULLIVAN. 
Farewell, my lovely Erin, I 
must bid thee now fare-
well, 
The grief I 
feel at parting thee no other tongue can 
tell; 
No land shall win my heart from thee, though poor 
thou art and bare, 
For thee I'll pray when far away, my darling County 
Clare. 
No more I'll see thy verdant hills, and skies of azure 
blue, 
The wild birds screaming o'er the lake or hear the 
wolf-dogs hoo; 
The trees which oft I've sat beneath are leafless now 
and bare, 
Since I must leave my native home, my darling 
County Clare. 
The nian seas, why do we grieve, when we are paid 
for going? 
But payment ne'er could ease the hearts of dying 
parents' moans; 
The workhouse and a 
pauper's grave, they both shall 
shortly share; 
Since I must leave my native home, my darling 
County Clare. 
My parents grieve in silence and my loving wife does 
cry, 
My little children scream aloud, saying " Father, tell 
us why 
Are you going to leave us here behind? We are hun-
gry, cold and bare? 
Oh, father, stay, don't go away, from your darling 
County Clare!" 
Farewell, green land, the sails are set and waving in 
the wind, 
My heart is fraught with maddenikg thoughts at 
leaving thee behind; 
But I 
must seek employment, for famine now does 
stare, 
With ghastly looks on the manly forms of my rela-
tives in Clare.

MACKENNA'S DREAM-. 
One night of late I 
chanced to stray, 
When all the Green in slumber lay, 
The moon sunk in the deep; 
I 
sat upon a 
ruined mound, 
And while the wild wind whistled round, 
Lull'd me fast asleep. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw that hero true, 
Who did the Danish force subdue; 
lits sabre bright, with wrath he drew, 
These words he said to me: 
" 
The Harp, with rapture, yet shall Qound, 
My children's chains shall be unbound, 
And they shall gather safe around 
The blooming laurel tree." 
I 
thought brave Sarsfield drew up nigh, 
And to my question made reply; 
" 
For Erin's cause I'll live and die 
As thousands did before. 
My sword again on A 
ughrim's plain 
Old Erin's rights shall well maintain, 
Through millions in the battle slain 
And thousands in their gore," 
I 
thought Saint Ruth stood on the ground, 
And said, " I'll be your monarch crowned, 
Encompassed by the French around 
All marching to the field ;" 
He raised a 
Cross, and thus did say, 
" 
Brave boys, we'll show them gallant play; 
Let no man dare disgrace the day, 
We'll die before we yield." 
The brave O'Byrne he was there, 
From Ballymanus, bright and fair, 
Brought Wicklow, Carlow, and Kildare, 
To march at his command: 
45 
MACK 
ENNA'S DREAM. 
(Continued.) 
Westmeath and Cavan too did join, 
The county Louth men crossed the Boyne. 
f•-' lane, Trim, and Navan too did join 
With Dublin to a 
man. 
O'Reilly, on the hill of Screene, 
He drew his sword both bright and keen, 
And swore by all his eyes had seen, 
He would avenge the fall 
Of Erin's sons and daughters brave, 
Who nobly filled a 
martyr's grave. 
And die, rather than live a 
slave, 
And stilt for vengeance call. 
Then Father Murphy came to say, 
" 
Behold, may lord, I'm 
here to-day, 
With eighteen thousand pikemen gay, 
From Wexford's hills and caves: 
Our country's fate, it sure depends 
On us, and on our gallant friends, 
And heaven will their cause defend, 
Who ne'er were willing slaves." 
I 
thought the band played " Patrick's Day,' 
To marshal all in grand array; 
With cap and feather, white and gay 
They marched in warlike glow. 
With drums and trumpets loud and shrill, 
And cannon upon every hill, 
And pikemen, who, with valor thrill 
To strike the fatal blow. 
When all at once appeared in sight 
An army clad in armor bright, 
Both i 
front, and rear, and left, and right, 
Marched Paddies evermore.

MACKENNA'S DREAM. 
,,Concluded) 
The chieftains pitched their camps with skill, 
Determined tyrants' blood to spill, 
Beneath us ran a. mountain rill, 
As rapid as the None. 
A Frenchman, brave, rose up and said 
"Let Erin's sons be not dismayed, 
To glory I'll the vanguard lead, 
To honor and renown. 
Come, bravely draw your swords with me, 
And let each tyrant bigot see 
Dear Erin's daughters must be free 
Before the sun goes down." 
Along the line they raised a 
shout, 
Crying, " Quick march, right about;" 
With bayonets fixed they all marched out 
To face the deadly foe. 
The enemy were noways shy 
With thundering cannon planted nigh; 
Now thousands in death struggle lie, 
And streams of crimson flow. 
The enemy made such a 
square 
As drove our calvary to despair 
Who were nigh routed, rank and rear, 
But yet not forced to yield. 
The Wexford boys that ne'er were slack, 
Caine, with the brave Tips at their back, 
With Longford joined, who in a 
crack 
Soon sent them off the field. 
They gave three cheers for liberty, 
As the enemy all broken flee, 
I 
looked arOUTI I. but cold not see 
One foeinan on the plain, 
Except the men who wounded lay: 
When I 
awoke 'twas break of day— 
So ends MacKenna's dream.

MY 'HEART'S IN OLD IRELAND 
Am—Rock Me to Sleep, Mother. 
Exiled from Erin, I 
left her fair shore, 
Sadly and lonely I 
roamed the world o'er, 
All that was dear to me in my loved home, 
Memory brings back as daily I 
roam, 
Friends in strange countri ,s 
I 
oftimes have met, 
Who, knowing my sorrows, would have me forget. 
Or bidding me hope, for the dawning was nigh, 
When my brave brethren would sound the war-cry. 
CHORUS. 
Erin, dear Erin, 1 
long for the day, 
AA hen thy brave sons cast their bondage away. 
But should I never that happy day see, 
My heart's still in Ireland, where'er I 
may be. 
Years have gone by since thy fetters were wrou.ght. 
Prayers and entreaties were counted as nought; 
Helpless thou knelt before England in dust, 
Hoping the tyrant at least might be just. 
Vain were thy pleadings, and useless thy tears. 
England has answered with scoffs and with jeers. 
Then sad indignation each bosom did fill, 
And in deep humility bowed to God's will. 
Erin, dear Erin, eta. 
England, thou pitiless tyrant. take heed, 
Nations before us found friends in their need, 
Know, that oppression engenders detp hate, 
Deal with us justly before ' tis too late ; 
Ireland's aroused, and her s,als are awake, 
Soon to its centre thy kingdom shall shake— 
My country forever, in fetters or free, 
My heart is still with her where'er I 
may be. 
Erin, dear Erin, etc.

As down by Banna's banks I 
strayed, 
One evening in May, 
The little birds, in blithest notes, 
Made vocal ev'ry spray; 
They sung their little notes of love, 
They sung them o'er and o'er, 
Ah! Gra ma chree ma colleen oge, 
Ma Molly Astore. 
The daisy pied, and all the sweets 
The dawn of nature yields— 
The primrose pale, and vi'let blue,

On yonder yellow hill; 
Or lowed for me the numerous herds

My kine and fleecy store.

THE MONARCH THAT DIED OF THE DROUTH. 
.z,ung by CRONV: and SULLIVAN. 
Oh, one night I 
lay dreaming, asleep in my bed, 
When a 
tale of Sam Lover's came into my head, 
About a 
king and a 
castle, old Ireland's joys, 
On the banks of the Shannon near Clon McAnoise; 
Some parts stuck together like mortar and brick, 
Delaying the hands of old Time and old sick; 
Like other historians I'll stick to the truth 
And I'll sing of the monarch that died of the drouth. 
The name of the monarch was O'Shaughan Moore, 
He'd sport with the rich and be friend of the poor: 
For drinking and sporting he'd brave dangers and 
perils, 
And a 
rale divil's clip was he after the girls. 
He'd astonish the neighbors whene'er he would dance, 
Though he never took lessons from 
London or 
Prance; 
He prayed he might die the same death in his youth. 
If he'd ever let any poor divil die with Lunger or 
drouth. 
One night the king came home as drunk as Kishogue—. 
The stretchers in those days weren't in vogue; 
A 
poor begging bouchal on the road he o'ertook, 
Who asked the king for assistance because he was 
stook. 
His majesty swore an unmerciful oath 
That he couldn't buy buttons for a 
fairy's waistcoat; 
'Phe beggar-marx prayed and cursed under his tooth, 
Ah, I 
am dying of hunger, may you die with the 
drouth. 
5 
THE MONARCH THAT 
E 
D 
OF ' I'll E DROUTH. 
(Concluded.) 
His majesty got in an immovable state, 
He arrived, unescorted, at, 
his castle gate; 
He was shoveled to bed by his chambermaid, Ruth, 
And about four in the morning he awoke with the 
drouth. 
The blue divils stirred him up when the morning 
was gray, 
lie asked for a 
drink and she left him his tay; 
His head, it being light, he ne'er minded the jug 
Until it was empty and dry as his mug. 
The chamber resounded with the -jugs smashed clink, 
" 
Oh, meila murther, is there no one to give rue a 
- drink?" 
But' still no one came his miseries to soothe, 
So he jumped out of bed, raging mad with the ei;:outh. 
Of the twenty-step staircase he took only one jump,. 
He never cried crack till he came to the pump; 
His mouth being a 
furnace, like a 
kiln that's on fire, 
If the damn pump drank salt water it couldn't be. 
dryer. 
The gates being opened 'twas out they all flew 
When the corpse of the beggar-man came to their 
view; 
Of hunger he died and the king's time was nigh 
For when they went to the Shannon the river was 
dry; 
Both stories he heard, water still was his cry, 
Till the water in torrents ran down from each eye; 
He let a 
inurtherin' screech that was heard at. May-
nouth, 
It blew the roof off the castle and he died with the 
drouth.

THE MINSTREL BOY. 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
in the r 
inks of death you'll find him, 
-His father's sword he has girded on, 
And his wild harp slung behind him. 
" 
Land of song I" said the warrior bard, 
"Tho' all the world betrays thee. 
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee." 
The minstrel fell ! but the foemen's chain 
Could not bring his proud soul mider ; 
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again, 
For he tore its cords asunder ; 
And said, " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery ! 
'Thy songs were made for the pure and free, 
They shall never sound in .iiavery." 
THE HARP. 
The harp that once through Tara's balls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now bangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that sold were fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days— 
So glory's ihriil is o'er ; 
And hearts that once I 
eat high for praise, 
Now feel th-tt pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright, 
The harp of Tara swells ; 
The chord, alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes, 
The only throb she gives, 
Is when some heart indignant breaks, 
To show that still she lives.

The wind and the waves in fierse conflict arose, 
With tumult the heavens were rife ; 
All ferment and roar was the Bay of Tremore, 
And the strand seemed to shake with the strife. 
Neptune's artillery boomed long the shore, 
1, cavern, ' gainst rock and o'er shallow, 
The blast snatched the spray and whirled it away, 
Right inland oer cottage and fallow. 
Hopelessly battling with wind and with wave, 
A 
vessel appears in the bay ; 
God help her! for now from her stern to her bow, 
She's doomed, the inhabitants say. 
A_ French ship from Cadiz deep, laden with wine, 
The storm fiend he shows her no quarter; 
In each timber she creaks she strains and she leaks, 
And her cargo is now wine and water. 
Two days and two nights and another day yet, 
She tacks to regain the clear offin ; 
But foul wind and tide her efforts deride, 
And each. tack is a 
nail in her coffin. 
Nearer and nearer the sandbank she drove, 
'Tiil she struck on the treacherous shoal, 
lasts went by the board, and sea o'er her poured, 
t, 
And a 
cry burst from each stricken soul. 
For miles all aroand the intelligence flies, 
That a 
ship in the bay is ashore. 
And the people in flocks, crowd the shore and the rocks, 
To helplessly gaze by the score. 
With work and with watching, exhausted her crew, 
Are lashed to the stump of her mat ; 
Their cries to the shore are drowned in the roar, 
Of the wave and shriek or the biast.

As dripping Tim stood on the strand ; • 
'Twas splendidly doLe, old Ireland's son, 
I'm proud of you; give us your hand. 
Tell us the way we can serve you, lad ; 
Come, what can I 
do for you, Connor ? 
Och, sure, Tim replied, all I 
did was to ride ; 
Remember the mare, plaze your honor. 
What T 
did, sure, I 
did in the easiest way, 
But jist comfortably sitting upon her ; 
Site did all the work, whilst I 
sat like a 
Turk, 
So remember the mare, plaze your honor! 
But Fame values valor wherever •tis found; 
The btlp of the brave light upon her 
Though Tim couldn't write, she made him a 
knight--
A Knight of the Legion of Honor.

THE LITTLE OLD DUDDEEN:

ky DAVE BEAHAM. 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN 
Sung by HARRIGAN & HART. 
Timm's a 
bit of clay on a 
little stim, 
That's sweet enough to ate, 
Whin filled up wid tobacco 
'Twould put a 
man to slape. 
'Twas introduced in Ireland 
In the days of Brian Borhue, 
I'd rather lose my life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey- dew. 
Some call it Cavendish, 
Or any name you'd -wish, 
And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green. 
When from my work I 
tire, 
I 
set down by the fire, 
An' I 
watch the smoke roll up and curl, 
From ray little ould Duddeen. 
CHORUS. 
My duddeen you are so sweet to me, 
I 
love to see your smoke go up 
Whin I 
get through my tea: 
My duddeen, yc,u are in the family., 
I'd surely die if I 
found out 
You were stole away from me. 
II ye studied history, 
Ye'll read where William Pittn, 
nought the state of Pinnsylvania 
From the wild red Injin men,

THE LITTLE OLD DUDDEEN. 
Continued. 
He never used a 
sword or gun 
When he met them face to face, 
But they all sit down continted, 
And they smoked the pipe of peace. 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a 
sluinber, 
A stupor, or a 
dream. 
Ye might say it's not ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little ould Duddeen. 
My Daddeen, ‘eta. 
A Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puff3, and frets; 
The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
Wid one end to his nose, 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland; 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back; 
They've that bit of clay so black • 
It's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little ould Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, eta

A 
Recitation, presented to DeLt. BARNEY FAGAN by MI ED. 
J. BUCKLRY, 31,4 
delivered by him with immense 
success. 
Don't push me abritt, man! don't you see the mail is not yet 
distributed, 
Wait for your turn? 
Why, confound you ; you are breaking my ribs 'gainst the rail, 
Stand back; or I'll give you the thrashing you earn. 
If you plaze, sur, I 
heard from a 
friend in the mine 
That a 
letter was here for one Dennis McFay, 
And I'd like for to get it if it's only z 
line, 
If it comes from the wife, for she's so far away. 
I'd like for to know, for it's long since I 
had a 
scratch of k 
pin, 
And I 
am out of my head, 
Diva a 
word have I 
heard for a 
year, good or bad 
So how can I 
tell if she's living or dead. 
I 
am anxious to get it, for it's late in the day, 
And the mine where I 
woik is from here good three mile, 
If I'm not there at one, sure they'll send me away; 
Alt, you don't have to work, sir, and that's why yov. 
Well, my good man, since that is the case, 
1.11 ask for your letter, let me see, what 5s the name ? 
Dennis McFay, sir, and I 
came from a 
place called Larah, 
The letter must be from the same. 
A 
letter from Dennis McFay, if you please, 
Much obliged, the post- mark says, Larah, zoth of May, 
Now, my friend, I 
hope your mind is at ease, 
Here is the letter yon asked for; I 
bid you good day. 
If ynu plaze, stir, don't leave me awhile, 
Sure my mind is not at ease till the letter is read, 
I'm not much of a 
scholar, divil a 
word can I 
read, 
So how can I 
tell whether she's living or dead. 
Whut, yon can't read your letter! 
how does that come, were you never at school? 
Oh, yes, sir! many's the good chance I 
had, 
But I 
threw them away Like an innocent fool.

As I

KATHLEEN MAVOUTINEEN. 
As sung by JENYIE M ORGAN. 
Kathleen Mavourneen! the gray dawn is breaking. 
The horn of the hunter is heard on the bill, 
The lark from her light wing the bright dew is shak-
ing, 
'tiothleen Mavourneen, what, slumbering still? 
Ah! hast though forgotten how soon we must sever? 
Oh! hast thou forgotten this day we must part? 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
Oh! why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart? 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen? 
Kathleen Mavourneen! awake from thy slumbers, 
The blue mountains glow in tbe sun's golden light, 
Ah! where is the spell that once hung on my num-
bers? 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of the night, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night. 
Mavourneen, Mavourneen, my sad tears are falling, 
To think that from Erin and thee I 
must part, 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart,. 
It may be for years and it may be forever, 
'Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourneen?
