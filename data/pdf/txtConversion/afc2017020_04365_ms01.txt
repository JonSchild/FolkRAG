*NOTE: “Warren” is a pseudonym that the interviewee has selected. Warren uses they/them pronouns. The 
interview has been “scrubbed” in two places to remove identifying remarks that accidentally cropped up in the 
course of the interview. The interviewer and Warren have known each other most of their lives.
SOUND QUALITY NOTE: The interview took place, by interviewee’s choice, outside at the North 
Market, on a particularly windy day. Despite wind-socks, the recording does peak out at a few signiﬁcant 
moments due to the wind. Many other people are also present on the porch, many of them also engaged in 
discussion; and some of them on cell phones. There are also some children shrieking.

intentional community; love of working outdoors; recalling Warren’s father’s early 
admonishment about never working in an oﬃce; discussion of how their personal cooking

have that labor of love … I think it makes you feel more connected to your food.”
●
00:16:50 -- Discusses plan to continue farming, but going to art school for a year in 
Philadelphia; and transition into on-farm education (including cooking classes): participating 
in growing food, knowing where your food comes from, teaching “positivity around food” 
and countering cultural negativity around food, especially for kids whose families were living 
oﬀ the food stamp/EBT/SNAP program. Warren describes their work in food access and 
developing programming and grants to help pay for CSA shares for food-insecure families, 
etc. -- in the Hudson Valley of New York. Discovery of “wild foods” and medicinal plants 
used in foods during tenure in upstate New York
00:19:50 -- Transition to Part-Time/Seasonal Back-of-House Kitchen Work: 
Dishwashing & Baking 
●
Warren describes moving back to Columbus after contracting Lyme Disease in the Hudson 
Valley, and wanted to come home to help her mother; but this decision also meant leaving 
behind job opportunities, networks, etc., in the Hudson Valley. Warren was able to ﬁnd alot 
of farm jobs, “but that was seasonal … and you don’t get paid alot”; and she still hasn’t been 
able to ﬁnd full-time work in farming.
●
00:21:00 -- Accepted a position with a friend who started a café, doing dishwashing work; 
“Oh, well, I’m kinda desperate … and I know this is way under my skill level, and way under 
what I should be getting paid for my experience, but it’s also a whole new experience … so 
why not try it. And maybe it’ll get my foot in the door in some way.” Warren discusses 
ﬂexibility of the work, pros/cons of working for a friend as an employer, and the excitement 
of being a part of the launch of a new business. Warren describes leaving the position after 
learning that someone else who started the same position after them actually got paid more; 
brought this up to the owner and eventually made a decision to leave. Started as a 
dishwasher at a new coﬀeeshop/bakery.
●
00:22:40 -- Warren discusses interviewing at her current coﬀeeshop/bakery (also as a 
dishwasher); and the extremely positive culture of the establishment. “I really love it there … 
people are super nice.” Warren also discusses the diﬃculty and hard work of being a 
dishwasher; and speaks about the constraints they imagine the owners are under, in terms of 
being able to pay everyone higher wages. Warren describes watching the business growing, 
and then getting a manager -- they themselves were oﬀered the position of dish manager, but 
rejected it. Discussions of the “complications” of learning to work with a new dish manager.
●
00:24:26 -- Side conversation on how Warren balances working in a kitchen with part-time/
seasonal farm work around Central Ohio farms; and their organic landscaping business; and 
discusses her appreciation for the ﬂexibility of her coﬀeeshop, which allows Warren to drop 
down their hours during the summer, and step up hours during the (farm) oﬀ-season.
●
00:25:39 -- Warren describes cross-training into bakery work by ﬁnishing her work “so fast” 
that Warren had time to visit with the bakers and front-of-house staﬀ and learn some of their 
jobs. Warren describes layout of the back-of-house, the kitchen and the “dish-tank” room. 
Warren also describes friends at work, and learning how to make stuﬀ in the bakery during 
closing shifts; realizing that baking is “like farming, or like art.” 
●
00:27:00 -- Warren describes the French pastries that their coﬀeeshop/bakery produces -- 
“fancy stuﬀ”, turns, etc. Warren describes working with the head kitchen manager, who 
develops all these recipes herself; and Warren’s pleasure in being a perfectionist and making 
all of these pastries. Warren also discusses being a vegan and not being able to eat any of the 
pastries they make. Warren also discusses the overall bakery team -- twelve bakers across two 
establishments; and Warren shares their joy in being able to make pastries look pretty; and 
their sense of workers’ loyalty to the company and people being there “to help each other 
out”.
00:29:40 -- Back-of-House Kitchen Culture in the Bakery 
●
00:29:50 -- Warren discusses music, jokes and “goofy” culture in the bakery; but also, 
maintaining boundaries in the workplace -- for example: not listening to murder podcasts in 
the kitchen; Warren praises their current kitchen because it’s a place where people feel like 
they can speak up about what they do/don’t want to discuss or listen to in the shared 
kitchen; discusses small-ness of the bakery space: “it’s REAL small.” Discusses respect and 
mutual love; “but -- it’s a bakery. There are mostly female-identifying-individuals who are 
bakers. And I feel like that … carries a way of talking or relating … like, if there’s a delivery 
person who might have said something questionable to us …. I’ve deﬁnitely heard of very 
crude, and very masculine-driven kitchens … of course, I’m talking about stereotypes, of 
talking about sex … but we are mostly young, liberal people, and we mostly kind of joke 
around and do our work.”
●
00:33:16 -- Social interactions with fellow kitchen/front-of-house workers outside of work; 
Warren identiﬁes this as a main reason they continue working their. Discusses good/”best” 
friends from work; a “really friendly, really laid-back” culture. Discussion of recreational 
sports teams (softball, bowling league) organized by the owners; discusses “growing pains” of 
the company as the business is getting bigger -- maybe things like this won’t continue. 
Warren shares about holiday parties, etc.; and seeing the owners put some of the proﬁt back 
into building a culture for the workers. “I know I’m not always going to work in a kitchen” -- 
Warren isn’t super afraid about things changes; she understands how the growth of the 
company could be exciting to some people (beneﬁts, upward mobility) and sad for others 
(loss of intimacy).
●
00:36:00 -- Warren discusses how kitchen work ﬁts into most of the staﬀ’s life -- for some 
people, it’s a career; for others, this supports other ways of life; Warren notes that the owners 
don’t just hire “French bakers,” but hard-working people who do lots of things with their life
●
00:36:50 -- Discussion of the “hipness” of the coﬀee shop and unoﬃcial dress code (black 
pants/blue jeans and black shirt; and a head covering) -- “very laid back; we don’t want to 
make anything … it’s just to identify us, to customers; there’s no real restriction. It can be 
black anything, really. Obviously … no tank-tops, or … shorts, working in a kitchen.” Warren 
discusses how tattoos/piercings are “typical” for a coﬀeeshop; “alot of alternative-looking 
individuals, who might have piercings and tattoos … feel comfortable working here.”
●
00:38:30 -- Warren discusses the coﬀee shop “shift” culture as something that particularly 
accommodates musicians, etc. 
●
00:38:50 -- “I don’t personally feel like it’s hip … but a city/town will make their own 
stereotype of it … People might just put that on there.”
00:39:00 -- The Space of the Bakery // Culture of the Coffee Shop 
●
Working in a “ﬁshbowl” -- bakery is surrounded by windows, and patrons can watch; Warren 
enjoys that people are interested, “makes people feel more connected to the food,” and 
thinks being watched makes Warren make better food; and encourages people to pay a bit 
more for the food
●
Warren describes the impact of the open kitchen on the “experience” of that location
●
High turn-over in customers and owners’ decision not to provide wi-ﬁ; “detrimental to our 
customers, and to us, to just have people sitting there all day. I know the owners did that to 
keep the foot-traﬃc coming and going more; but also to keep people engaged with each 
other …”
00:42:34 -- Wages! Negotiations/Ceilings; and Job Security 
●
00:43:00 -- Warren discusses wage culture at their bakery; Warren isn’t certain of other 
people’s wages; gets paid (starting out) more than minimum wage; and back-of-house gets a 
percentage of tips; got bumped up tp $12/hour as a starting baker; Warren hopes pay is 
diﬀerentiated based on training (if someone went to pastry school, etc.)
●
Warren feels these wages are “pretty good,” given cost of living in Columbus; and feels that 
wages are acceptable if a staﬀ member works full-time, over a weekend, and gets overtime; 
with tips, Warren thinks bakery wages would be maybe $14-15/hour. 
●
“Other people have diﬀerent relationships to money; I kind of know my bottom line, and 
I’m like … eh, it’s OK. It’s ﬁne. Other people have diﬀerent relationships to money, which is 
why they go work at Nationwide [insurance company].”
●
00:45:50 -- “I would rather do what I would like to do than get paid alot.” Warren discusses 
choosing to farm and work in a bakery -- neither of which are particularly well-paid jobs; and 
her faith that she’s going to move on to another kind of better-compensated/ or self-
generated work; “I don’t really want to be a professional baker. It’s just not where my main 
interests lie.”
●
00:46:40  --Warren reﬂects that though they take pride in the product they create, it’s just 
not necessarily the thing she is passionate about doing; her farming and landscaping work is 
more her career path -- and she is seeking out a more professional/salaried relationship to 
food/farm/activism work now that she is 30
00:48:30 -- “Day in the Life” of a Bakery Shift; Getting it Right 
●
Warren describes the mid-shift as the “Princess Shift” (don’t have to open, don’t have to 
close)
●
Warren discusses the complicated tipping shift in the kitchen; openers get more money -- a 
folder is passed around and separated by front-of-house (they get the most), bakers, 
dishwashers, “sandwich people”
●
Working from 8-4; this shift doesn’t do “roll-out” (croissant dough); conversations with the 
opener; process of “baking oﬀ” (00:52:40)
●
00:54:20 -- working with other bakers with diﬀerent skills and styles; Warren discusses a co-
worker who made a “really ugly icing”; and having to deal with putting that on a pastry; doing 
quality control; consequences of making something bad in the kitchen; culture of everyone 
in the kitchen writing their names on the part of the pastry they prepare (dough, assembly, 
icing, preparing for bake-oﬀ”) -- “There are lots of steps, and we are accountable for each 
step.” No consequences, Warren says, for mistakes; but continued mistakes without remorse 
or interest in learning, is probably grounds for getting ﬁred -- “If you keep messing up, and 
you don’t care if you were messing up …”.  Warren also discusses being a perfectionist in the 
kitchen, and the care that is required; especially because Warren is vegan and can’t taste-test 
the recipes themselves.
●
1:00:15 -- as the company grows, recipes change; importance of getting that communicated 
down through the chain, and getting it into the recipe book, when the owners or managers 
want that change to happen; non-disclosure and company recipes -vs.- learning the 
techniques and replicating those (intentionally or not) in home baking -- e.g., learning how to 
fold biscuits from work in the job; improvisation and seeking more eﬃcient/innovative ways 
to do the work 
●
01:04:25 -- Taking pride in work // taking pride in cooking, and sharing what Warren makes; 
taking time to make additional stuﬀ (“biscuit babies”) at work; and how to ﬁgure out whether 
it’s an appropriate time
●
01:07:22 -- upward mobility for co-workers // refusing upward mobility in her own kitchen 
position (not accepting the dish manager position and keeping the part-time dish position); 
not wanting additional responsibility and keeping the ﬂexibility “to farm, and do things that 
make me feel really connected to my soul”; being hired by the owners, and the company, to 
do landscaping -- “They’re just really great people … they really do love their employees.” 
Warren discusses anticipated changes in the culture, in terms of employee-owner 
relationships, as the business grows.
01:10:00 -- Changes in Columbus Food Culture, Since the 1990’s 
●
Warren discusses not remembering going up to any independently-owned restaurants until 
high school; reﬂecting with Jess on visiting The Coﬀee Table coﬀee shop in the Short North 
in the early-2000’s
●
Warren discusses the aesthetics of their current café -- transplanting a New York City-esque 
coﬀee-shop vibe; “interesting-looking, sleek” -- “a really curated space; an intimate feel”
●
“I don’t know if food culture in Columbus has changed in a way that the culture hasn’t 
changed.”
●
Warren discusses the multi-cultural food scene in Columbus and small, family-run 
restaurants and establishments; being happy to support food businesses like this, “... where I 
feel like the owners really directly beneﬁt, rather than investors; but I also understand that 
the café where I’m working with, they’re doing really well; so why not make more shops?” 
Warren also discusses job creation as beloved small businesses scale-up. “I feel like, in 
Columbus, there are alot of restaurants that are investor-supported … and I don’t like them 
as much.”
●
01:14:00 -- Warren expresses desire for more people to buy local food and support more local 
farmers; “That’s something I always advocate for: trying to get restaurants to buy locally, or 
think about it locally … and just try to plant that seed … it’s just worth mentioning. Maybe 
some people are more willing to jump on it.” Warren discusses how, at their ﬁrst café, they 
worked hard to connect the owner to local farmers and local produce; and the owner still 
buys produce from local farmers to this day.
01:16:00 -- The Invisibilization of Kitchen Workers? // Wages, Again // Dishwashing 
Culture 
●
Warren responds to a question about the invisibilization of kitchen workers under Columbus 
celebrity chef culture; Warren feels like “open kitchens” and small businesses, like the cafés 
where they have worked, do promote kitchen workers and make them recognizable. “But, 
like I said, if I wanted to be a baker … I’d probably do it myself.”
●
Discussion of contention over pay and wages in back-of-house culture; diﬃculty of dish-
washing work and negotiating for/advocating for raises in dishwashing; Warren didn’t receive 
a raise, but felt like their manager spoke up for them and expressed concerns about the 
diﬃculty of the job. Warren now tries to encourage other dishwashers to speak up for what 
they want and need. Discussion of how management views Warren’s advocacy and passion 
for clear and frank workplace communication. Warren expresses understanding about how 
diﬃcult it may be for owners to respond to workers more, as the business has been growing; 
“I didn’t feel like I wasn’t heard. I was given an answer. And when you’re given an answer, you 
can agree with it or disagree with it. You can accept it, or not. I had decided, I’m not going 
to work here more, because I’m not getting paid enough …” [on leaving dishwashing to 
become a baker.]
01:20:25 -- Kitchen Work Futures for Columbus // Speaking Up on the Job 
●
Warren speaks on the importance of respect, compensation, and workplace cultures where 
kitchen employees feel valued; “I feel that way … I feel like there are alot of options. I feel 
like alot of responsibility is on the people who can be responsible and can speak out … my 
personality is, if I want something, I’m going to ask for it; and if I don’t get it, I’m going to 
change my trajectory to get it.” 
●
Warren discusses work to empower and give advice to other employees on how to achieve 
what they want in the workplace; “Of course there are people who can’t speak up … and 
there need to be people to encourage those people.” Discussion of unoﬃcial organizing in 
the workplace. “It’s a responsibility for everyone involved to know your own worth.”
●
“Kitchen cultures have alot of that … alot of camaraderie. You’re in stressful situations and 
having to deal with alot of … especially, with customers. That, in particular, is very diﬃcult, 
which is why I would never work with customers …”
●
Warren discusses relationship between front-of-house and back-of-house at their coﬀeeshop; 
Warren has lots of positive things to say about the dynamic and how the two teams get 
along; “We know they have to work with alot of customers! We feel like we are in our safe 
space; but we know that is the choice we make, as the bakers there … if you didn’t want to 
work with customers, you’re not going to work in front-of-house.” Warren discusses open 
applications and movement between front-of-house and back-of-house. (01:26:00)
●
“I would hate to be rich and have everything given to me. I, personally, love the personality 
I’ve gotten from having diﬃculties in my life. I know it didn’t have to work out this way -- it 
could’ve worked out another way; but I feel really proud of myself, by the gumption I’ve 
shown in my work and in my life.” 
01:27:29 -- Concluding Slate, Thanks & Goodbyes
