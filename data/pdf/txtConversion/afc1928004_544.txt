HEEHAN with great success in their laughable 
production, entitled " MRS. DRISCOLL'S PARTY." 
We're going to have a 
party, 
Down at Concordia Hall; 
We'll have lots of fun and dancing, 
For we give a 
darling ball. 
When the band begins their musio, 
The Micks will never stop, 
'Till they show their great ability 
At Mrs. Driscoll's Hop. 
Cr.cmus. 
With winging and tinging, 
Without fear of any cop; 
We'll do the pivoter 
Down st Mrs: Driscoll's hop. 
You can easily imagine 
When you look upon us here, 
That we're gentlemen of nobility, 
And hail from County Clare. 
The lady now in question's, 
/Cot broke at all at all, 
But SO very near to busted, 
That we're giving her this balL 
With winging and singing, ete.

Just give me your kind condescension, 
I'm glad for to see ye's all well, 
And now if ye's all pay attention, 
My troubles to ye I 
will tell. 
There's a 
gang that lives over in Jarsey, 
Th -)7 say I 
looks like a 
baboon, 
The,i':.I Icy for me coming from labor 
Then they'll paralyze Michael Muldoon. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think that I'm giving ye taffy, 
Or gas to blow up a 
balloon, 
This gang they have near drove me crazy, 
That's just what they did for Muldoon. 
Last week with the gang I 
went sailing, 
To visit the Isle of Bellevue, 
When be heavens they set me to bailing, 
Till my trousers were wet through and through. 
Then a 
gale struck the boat in the centre, 
And they made me ascend the jiboon, 
Then they overhauled me with the painter, 
That's just what they did for Muldoon. 
Don't think, etc. 
Last Saturday night at a 
raffle, 
I 
was lucky enough for to win, 
But my good luck they all tried to baffle, 
By making me pay for their gin. 
When they found all I 
had was a 
dollar, 
They flung me all over the room. 
Of me coat all they left was the collar, 
And that's what they did for Muldoon.

And can dance like the thvll all the while.

To-day sure we had a fine parade, we marched fiY0

The Marshal looked so gallant, beneath his grand

He mashed the darlings right and left, as they viewed 
the grand parade.

Forward, march away, we made a

All sons of Erin, alt bold Irishmen, 
We looked so great and grand behind O'Brien's band, 
Sure we are the ladies' pets on Patrick's Day. 
With stately tread we all marked. time, and everyone

Good-evening to ye's one and all, we're glad for to 
see ye's well, 
We thought on ye we'd make a call, our history for 
to tell; 
We landed here from Ireland, two Celts of high de-

Such men as us yell seldom find, Pat Lynch and Con 
Magee. 
CHORUS. 
For the girls remark as we go past, they say we are 
They can't resist this darling pair, from the Limerick 
side of the Rhine. 
We walk the streets with stately tread, like Dukes 
and Lords of fame, 
And if we make the ladies sigh, sure we're not at all 
to blame, 
We wear fine clothes as you can see, no common 
stock we know, 
We're recognized as man of means wherever we may 
go. 
For the girls, etc. 
We sometimes condescend to go to a 
party or a 
ball, 
Although exertion suits us not, we sometimes make a 
call, 
On all the solid men of town, and the big bugs of the 
land, 
Our company they always seek, for our style it is 
great and grand. 
For the girls, etc. 
We never pay no heed to what the hoodlums may cry 
out, 
But still if they persist in gab, for a policeman we'll 
shout, 
And then we'll give them in his charge, we've done 
so many a 
time, 
We'll teach them not to guy this pair from the Lim-
erick side of the Rhine.

THE HEALTHY GANG. 
;Written by JIM J. 
NELSON, and sung with great success by 
JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Now if yes listen for awhile, a 
song I'll sing to you, 
And every word I 
utter now, believe me it is true; 
At a 
party where I 
went last night, a 
healthy gang I 
saw, 
The first salute they gave me was assasinate the chaw. 
A 
bruiser from the bloody Eigth wae singing " Sweet 
Aleen," 
And then he asked the gang to see his grave would 
be kept green; 
And then he did a 
song and dance he called " Sweet 
Kitty Ann," 
And it paralyzed the members of that tough and 
healthy gang. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, such a 
crowd I 
never saw, on that my oath Ill 
take, 
They played casino, pedro, dice and ev'ry kind of fake, 
They said I 
was a 
tarrier. they said I 
shoveled sand, 
I'm sick and sore since first I saw that tough and 
healthy gang. 
They asked me up to sing a 
song, when I 
graciously 
declined, 
When Denny Flynn, the fighting man, he struck me 
from behind; 
Says he if you don't sing a 
song I'll show ye who I 
am, 
So I 
got up and vocalized " Muldoon the Solid Man." 
I 
tried to get Pat Rooney's walk, but hardly stepped 
a 
yard, 
When something hit me in the neck, and it struck me 
mighty hard, 
I 
stopped the music right away, I 
then did kick and 
roar, 
I 
said, be Heavens, come what may, I 
will not sing 
no more. 
Oh, such a 
crowd, etc. 
THE HEALTHY GAZTG. 
(Concluded.) 
I 
waltzed around the room to where the gang of row-
dy's sat, 
I 
said I'd give them fifty cents to tell me who done 
that: 
Says I 
just let him face me now, if he is in the gang, 
And I'll make him rue the welt he gave O'Malley's 
cousin Dan. 
I 
struck a 
fighting attitude, and gave an angry scowl, 
I 
thought to scare them by my style, but they set up 
a 
howl; 
One fellow hit me in the ribs which nearly broke his 
hand, 
Oh, I'll ne'er forget when first I 
met that tough and 
healthy gang. 
Oh, such a 
crowd, etc.

LET Erin remember the days of old

Ere the Em'rald gem of the western world, 
Was set in the crown of a

STRIKE Wffli..E 1.E_L TWYN TS HOT. 
Words mid music by DAN Driscoll,. 
My subject I 
take from a 
maxim well known, 
From which all a 
lesson can learn, 
To waste not a 
chance one may have to do right, 
Nor let opportunities turn; 
Although there are ninny in this world to-day 
Who wealthy might be, were it not 
That each chance they'd receive they always would fall 
To strike while the iron was hot. 
Cuonus. 
So, boys, don't forget it, and heed what I 
say, 
No matter whate'er be your lot. 
Make hay while tile sun shines, you'll find it will pay, 
4  
And strike while the iron is hot. 
We'll say tihm.e's a 
young man in love with a 
girl, 
He frequently calls at her home; 
He swears that I 
le worships the ground that she treads 
-Wherever, perchance, she may roam; 
He's bashful, p..?rhaps, and he fails to propose, 
Lets chances slip out of his hold; 
At last he discovers, although it's too late, 
That he's letting the iron grow cold. 
You've heard of those men who are now dead and gone, 
Jim Fisk, A. T. Stewart, Bill Tweed, 
And Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, and more, 
Though mention them hardly I 
need. 
, 
As boys they began at the foot of the steps, 
; And gradually higher they got; 
They ascended from poverty to great wealth, 
, For they struck while the iron was hot. 
again, there's Napoleon and Frederick the Great, 
And, most of all, George Washington, 
-Vho conquered great nations, and showed to the 
It 
world 
What true, noble courage had done. 
3y strong perseverance and knowledge combined, 
They scattered the foe like a 
shot; 
7,Zhey proved themselves heroes, and simply because 
\ 
They struck while the ixea was hot.

DAY WE LEFT TELE OLD DART. 
Written by JOHN SnEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN 8: JONES fa 
their original Irish Comedy Farce, en-titled " The Day 
We Left the Old Dart." 
k dear old Ireland we were born, 
It's many years ago; 
And raised up in sweet Monahan, 
It's the place where we're from, oh. 
We came over in the ship called Dreadauttglit, 
Frora friends we had to part ; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
We are poor old Irish greenhorns, 
It was hard for us to part; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
The morning the ship left Liverpool dock, 
Our poor mother did say, 
" 
God bless ye, me darling children, 
For you're going to America; 
You are going across the ocean," 
We thought of it on the spot, 
We often sit down and curse the day, 
'When we left the Old Dart. 
We are poor, etc.

Sitting in the parlor all the while;

Such curious things you hear:

To the piano she lightly treads.

OUR STAGE-STRUCK DAUGHTER. 
Written by Joitx SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN & JONES 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat MclIonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson whit her lays low ; 
Ten thousand dollars is the salary she door Agar, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
Cnonrs. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
Whit play-acting she is crazy ; 
Her mother wanted her to be a 
s
eervant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the ballet or can-can; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man, 
As a 
slack-wire dancer she 13 great, 
She plays the villain's part; 
In the character o! Juliet, 
She broke poor Romeo's heart. 
She has her mother's heart, eta.

There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal; 
The ash box inTector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold w.,tch and chain and a

I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It was only this morning he spilt me a

To fresco the alley and whitewash the yard, 
Bad luck to the sucker, if T 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

ATHLONE. 
Original by Mukruv & MORTON. 
Here we are an Irish pair, 
As you can plainly see ; 
We took a 
skip aboard the ship, 
And came across the sea. 
Bridget Welsh an Irish girl, 
And her sister Maggie, sweet, 
Came over here a 
year a(ro 
And this is where they will meet.

And soon we'll see their smiles agait, 
Like the blush of rosy morn, 
We'll take them hack with us again, 
When ,the bloom is on the corn. 
We know that they will sinr e with jilyb 
NVIien they see the two INiahons, 
And th:y will greet the I 
rih boys, 
Just came litre from Athlone. 
We parted from the folks at home, 
The day we sided away ; 
We left behind our kindred, kind, 
Came to America. 
I'm sure you'd laugh if you could sew 
The didoes on the ship ; 
'We danced and sung front early morn, 
We'd sorrels's-not a 
bit. 
Ciro-rms. 
For we could see two pair of eyes, 
Of laughing Irish blue ; 
And knew that we'd he welcomed by 
Two Irish colleens true. 
And this day week we're going back, 
Across the sea of foam ; 
It won't be long before we'll be 
In a 
p:ace they call Athlone.

We've shoveled coal since early morn, 
Now for our boarding-house we're bent; 
One dollar a

Troth that's divilish easy spent. 
In a

That's filed from top to bottom with Coal, 
It's there every morning we do flock, 
And shovel all day down in the hole.

Shoveling coal now that's our business, 
Every night it's home we stroll, 
We're full of fun, and sometimes whiskey, 
Hurrah for the lads that shovel the coal.

So all con.14 work throughout the land ; 
How many poor men now are starving, 
While the rich in luxury lives so grand. 
If we were rulers of the United States, 
We'd take a

We'd make all old rich rascals work, 
And give their place to the laboring man.

CASEY'S AWFUL ORUI3. 
COMIC IRISH SONG. 
Written by ITArtey 8: Joux Iartyrzt. 
I 
used to live in Karlem at a 
sailor's boarding-house, 
My clothes they wouldn't fit, my form was a 
disgrace, 
I 
stopped with Michael Casey, he was a 
dandy Mick, 
But the grub upon his table, would surely make you 
sick. 
There was old rheumatic butter, there was acrobatic 
cheese, 
There was India rubber beefsteak and dislocated peas; 
The butter turned a 
flip- flap, and fell into a 
tub, 
And the boarders all fell senseless from Casey's awful 
grub. 
Murphy got the horrors from eating ginger bread, 
Miss Maloney got the Jim jams, and stood upon her 
head; 
Muldoon he got the night mare, and danced around 
the floor, 
The cheese got on its dignity, and skipped right out 
the door. 
There was s•dt enough on the table to do a straight 
jig up :_ere 
The coffee was • easumpted, man too weak to appear, 
The soup was 4: 
eiti 
and dished out of a 
tub, 
And the boarde- ..

f; the heart disease from Casey's 
awful gr 
Friday being 'at day, the bill of fare was changed, 
They had bladder soup and pickles, oyster [sauce and 
brains, 
Boston beans and crackers, sour krout stuffed with 
snuff, 
Sere:fries and sausages all mixed up in a 
duff. 
I 
didn't spend my week out, but a 
friend of mine \elan 
did, 
Died very suddenly, they surrounded Casey's crib; 
The coroner was sent for, and when he looked at the 
dead man's lung. 
Said it surely wasn't suicide, but Casey's avr.f.td grub.

DECENT IRISH IVORIMTGAIAN. 
Written Composed and Sung by PETE CONNOR, 
I'm going to tell my troubles to the public hero to-
night, 
And when I 
finish you'll admit that I am speaking 
right; 
Scanethings that are the custom have got me pn771ed 
quite. 
I 
have no peace of mind since they began. 
If a 
man was born in Ireland they say lie isn't fly, 
He's a 
cully or a 
terrier, a 
bummer or a 
guy, 
ALd that's the kind of nick-names that the boys now-
a-days apply 
Tc etrery decent Irish workingman, 
CHORUS. 
Th-s 
boys and girls lately now are making it a 
rule 
'Et, use slang words and sayings that they never learn-
ed at school, 
ALI by such queer oppressions they attempt to make 
a 
fool 
Of every decent Irish workingman. 
They call a 
man a 
inucker, an old rooster or a 
gill, 
A. nick, a 
Turk, a 
beat, a 
bloke a 
rooster or a 
pill, 
MA when they meet upon the street, 
eir tongues are never still. 
To driv, us crazy seems to be their plan, 
TLere is neither rhyme or common sense, I'm sure you 
will agree, 
Bt.t let them say just what they like, it's all the same 
to me, 
For I'm a 
decent Irish workingman. 
My son says I'm a 
dizzy gawk and a 
little off my nut, 
TLat my mouth's the biggest part of me, and 1 
ought 
to keep it shut; 
I've lost my shingle off my roof, and more times I'm a 
gut, 
And now he's learning little Mary Ann. 
Fr she says that I am cranky too, and off of my cat-
bace, 
That the latest map of Ireland is growing on my face; 
To tell the truth my honest friends, I 
get no ease or 
peace, though Km a 
decent Irish workingman_

HOME RULE. 
As sung by JOHNN.Y' ROACH. 
Composed by MARY Laturzza. 
It's many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a-beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me, I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of MuUngar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for 
this very right 
My countryman are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our county from oppression long ago; 
Henry Grattan is his name and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving 
now 
To win our Legislator back again,

Oh! we landed in this country, 
At the time of the great big draft ; 
We walked the town in search of work,

Faix, we did seek for " graft." 
We met a 
sergeant on the street, 
He treated us to lager beer, 
And enlisted us next morn, boys, 
In the Irish Volunteers.

We felt so gay, as we march'd away, 
With thoughts of old Erin's Isle, 
Our guns shone bright, in the clear sunlight, 
Oh, the captain he did smile ; 
In suits of blue, we marched two by two, 
The girls gave hearty cheers, 
For ould Erin's boys, brave soldiel boys, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
They dress'd us up in soldier clothes 
And faith drill'd us three times a 
day ; 
Received orders from headquarters, 
To the war we marched away. 
To fight the red-skin Indians, 
And the " nagur " fusileers ; 
The knapsacks were shot off our backs, 
%. In the Irish Volunteers. 
They threw us in a 
baqgage car. 
And shippd us to New York City; 
The neighbors gathered in and said, 
It's a 
shame and a 
pity. 
They covered us with bread and soap, 
From our tc,s clean to our ears; 
We resigned our post of honor,

THE IRISH. 
Words by It obt. Turney. 
In,—Tare a 
,
Efeen. 
They tell me that the Irish are a 
poor degraded race, 
With every crime that human kind can sully and de-
base, 
That superstition, drunkeness, and every kind of 
shame, 
Like slimy serpents coil around the hated Irish name. 
Then tell sue who was Wellington, a 
recreant son ' tis 
true, 
Who forced Napoleon's star to set on bloody Water-
loo 
Tell me who was Edmund Burke, whose genius sub-
lime 
Shall shine with undimmed splendor through the 
countless years of time. 
Who were Goldsmith, 
Sheridan, and Moore whose 
genius flung 
A 
charm of witching sweetness round the stubborn 
Saxon tongue, 
And who was great O'Connell, too, Ireland's greatest 
son, 
Who, Phillips says, was Webster, Clay and Everett, all 
in one. 
And who was Balfe—irrirnortal Balfe—whose musio 
on the ear 
Falls sweetly as the heavenly notes so oft in dreams 
we hear, 
And who was Grattan—he who speaks in such a 
God-
like strain, 
That men exclaimed " Demosthenes in Grattan lives 
again." 
Then tell me not the Irish are a 
poor degraded race, 
We fling the slander back into each coward slander-
er's face; 
Tho' vilified and trampled down through centuries 04 
wrong, 
Old Erin ever was and is the home of wit and son& 
JOHANNA LOUISE McGUIRE. 
Written by JOHN KERNELL and sung by CHARLES A. Durce.a. 
There is a 
girl of high degree, 
On whom I 
am awfully struck. 
She dances in the ballet, 
While her father drives a 
truck; 
Her mother peddles lemonade, 
Her brother he slings hash, 
Yet the neighbors say, most every day, 
That Jonanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
If a 
girl that you all would admire,' 
She has a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though you never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you allow 
That Johanna McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all would admire; 
She's awfully gay on Patrick's Day, 
Is Johanna Louisa ,McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor, 
Up an alley down near the south cove, 
Her furniture is very antique, 
A 
table, three chairs, and stove. 
I, one evening, at her window sat, 
As her invited guest, 
From the alley below, 
Some young devil did throw 
A 
quid of Jackson's Best.

Bounteous nature loves all lands, beauty wanders ev'ry

Footprints leaves on many strands; but her home is 
surely there ! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest in that Eden of the

Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'd shrine, may suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, such God's wonders 
floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, mountains Tore and 
Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, though the monks are 
now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man there would fain prolong 
life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, with such bright and 
varied tints. 
Every rock that you pass by, verdure broiders or be-
splints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, every morn Spring's 
natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, smiling winter's 
frown away, 
Angels often pausing there, doubt if Eden were more

We met in Ireland's shady groves. 
But long I 
could not linger; 
I 
placed a 
kiss on her sweet lips, 
A 
ring upon her finger. 
A 
parting smile she sweetly gave 
Disclosing pearls 'mid roses ; 
Both ring and kiss are in the grave 
'Where she in peace reposes. 
Tho' time has changed my locks of gold, 
And brought me changes many, 
My heart recalls with mem'nes old 
Sweet Kathleen of Kilkenny— 
The sweet brunette, with eyes of jet— 
Dear Kathleen of Kilkenny. 
Her form was lithe, her lips like asw— 
Her face of classic beauty— 
Her soul shone through her eyes so true, 
And made my love a 
duty. 
No other name did I 
e'er learn, 
It was as sweet as any, 
But deep into my heart did burn 
Sweet Kathleen of Kilkenny. 
I 
ne-er shall see her as of old, 
But ' mid the angels many 
I 
know she wears a 
crown of gold, 
Sweet Kathleen of Kilkenny— 
That sweet brunette, with eyes of jet,

STYLES OF THE DAY. 
Copyright Secured 1880. 
Written by JACK EDWIN. Respectfully dedicated to JAS. M. 
Mintrar. 
I know you would all like to hear something sweet, 
Well now, I'll describe all the styles that I 
meet; 
The first on the list is the ladies " Chapeau," 
A 
hat I 
am towld that is now all the go. 
It's a 
round little di-doe just two fingers tall, 
With a 
bandage of ribbon called spotted Bengal; 
On the side there's a 
cuckoo, who if looked at would 
say: 
Cuckoo—ta-ta, it's the style of the day. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the daisies and darlings you meet on the street, 
I'll sit down and swear they're to 'tony to eat; 
Believe me, dear friends, I 
mean all what I 
say, 
Sure they'd rather waltz out with the styles of the 
day. 
Cleopatra my daughter, wears a 
dress called a "Kilt," 
Which looks to me like an old box plaited quilt; 
She has a 
strap and a 
bag which is tied to her side, 
And her hair tied in platters just two inches wide. 
On her heels she has clappers, made of pig iron brass, 
So the Charleys can hear her whenever they pass; 
When at home I 
make game of her, to me she will say: 
Never mind, Hercules, its the style of the day. 
Oh, the daisies, etc. 
Now the style of the gents are quite funny to me, 
And I 
can't help but laugh at some chaps that I 
seta; 
They have a 
new coat called the " Revarsabill," 
'Which is cut with a 
hanuner, and it's made of Chin-
Chill. 
The wear a 
new collar called the Rassle and Fall, 
And when it gets dirty, just rub it, that's all, 
My son he wears „samples he gets on Broadway, 
Where of course you will see all the styles of the day. 
- Oh, the daisies, etc.

From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan', 
Wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's. a 
few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in, 
A brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Johannes in his 'mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc. 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore." ) 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciscu, 
Another on of it you'll seldom meet 
like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a

They declaim, with admiration, 
Ain't they darlings dressed in blue.

THE NIGHT THAT JOHN McCARTITT FlOOKED 
HIS WATCH. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT and sung by JOHN KERNELL. 
It was on a 
winter evening in the merry month of 
June, 
The gang all congregated in a 
lager bier saloon; 
They were going on a jamboree, the reason I'll tell 
S0011, 
And McCarthy payed for drinks for every one; 
lie was working in a 
dollar store at fifty cents a 
day, 
But one line night he got so tight, he gave himselt 
away; 
The boss did then discharge him, and he didn't get his 
pay, 
And that's the reason why he had to hock his watch. 
But such a 
night and such a 
fight I 
never saw before, 
The gang got full of beer and rum and through the 
street did roar; 
McNulty got so paralyzed he tumbled through the 
floor, 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
O'Brien came home staving, and unto his wife says 
he, 
"Do you go get a 
quart of beer, and bring it home to 
me;" 
She says, " I'll take your wages, or you'll very quickly 
see 
Yourself lie sprawling on the floor." 
He put up his hands to .t
-rike her, when she hit him 
such a 
whack 
Right underneath his seventh rib, that you could hear 
it crack; 
He fell down the cellar and he nearly broke his back, 
On the night that John McCarthy hocked his watch. 
But such a 
night, etc.

As sung with great success by TONY PASTOtt. 
Down to the Crystal Palace in the early part of June, 
I 
took my young girl, Julia, dressed in a 
new costume 
Which caused a 
great sensation, for we had not gone 
very far, 
When some fellows they to me did say I'll have your 
Julia. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said I 
can't spare her, I only brought 
her out this morning, and the moment they heard me 
say this, they all commenced to shout—

Oh, Julia! oh, Julia! you really look very peculiar. 
I 
don't know why, but really I should like to get 
married to-day. 
Now being fond of Julia, I 
felt annoyed, you're sure, 
Then asked her if she knew the men and if they'd met 
before ? 
She said I 
don't know what they mean, and asked me 
to explain, 
When they laughed aloud, and then the crowd all 
shouted out again; 
Oh, Julia, etc. 
I 
said there must be something wrong, the fellows can't 
be right, 
And as they still kept up the noise, I 
challenged them 
to fight;

And as I 
fought with one or two, the others said ta, ta,

PADDY THE PIPER, 
Sang by JOHN DALY at TONY PA6TOR'13 Opera Haase. 
WHEN I 
was a 
boy in my father's mud edifice 
Tender and bare as a 
pig in a 
sty; 
Out to the door shure I 
looked with a 
steady face, 
Who but Pat Murphy, the piper, came by; 
Says Paddy there's few plays the music can you play, 
Says I 
don't know for I 
never did try, 
And he told me had a 
fine charm, 
To make the pipes prettily speak ; 
And he put the bag under his arm, 
And yelled out with a 
beautiful squeak. 
CFIORIIS. 
With a 
whack fal de dal, de dal da, 
Oh how he handles the grone, 
And such beautiful music he blew, 
It would have melted the heart of a 
stone. 
Full five years I 
followed him, nothing could sunder us, 
Till he one morning had taken a 
sup, 
He slipped from the bridge to the river just under us, 
And went to the bottom just like a 
blind pup, 
I 
roared out, I 
bawled out, I 
heartily called out, 
Oh Paddy, my friend, don't you mean to come up. 
He was dead as a 
nail on the door, 
Poor Paddy was placed on the shelf, 
So I 
took up the pipes on the shore, 
And now I 
set up for myself.

All the sweet faces at Limerick race%) 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt, 
The sowl would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies toy 
Nimble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey !

Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney, 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen ; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary. 
A

By the powers, hr. 'Heed Paddy Carey I 
Tight, and sonnd--2trong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright—

big blackguard, 
And Terrence is his name; 
He wears a

And he calls it a " super," and a " slang," 
Oh ! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CHORES. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning, 
And he'll give the door the divil's own bang, 
Oh! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home last .Thursday night, 
Sure I 
talked to him very Dice; 
When he said old man! you're getting to fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on ice 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh I 
her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
He'll come rolling home, etc. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner, 
From morning until night; 
And if the policeman says " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite, 
He went to the market only yesterday, 
And there be stole a 
big ham; 
And he got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang !" 
He'll come rolling home, eta.

THERE'S sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried. 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
While singing on the roof. 
CHORUS. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together; 
We play the concertina, likewise a 
sweet banjo, 
The Murphy's and O'Neil's come up to seethe weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms, 
There's Rosy Dunn and- Reilly's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance 
With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Fynn, • 
"It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight on a 
summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Now that's the place to spend the night 
And feel the pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And till the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night 
As happy as can be,
