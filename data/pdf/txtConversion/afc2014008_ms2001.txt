Dear Mr. Masuyama,
 
I am sorry it has taken me so long to respond to your letters.  I have not
 
worked on anything connected with the lullaby problem for the last several
 
years, and it has been difficult for me to focus my attention
, on your questions.
 
They are extremely hard, for one thing.  Any of them is worth
, a dissertation
 
in itself.  I haven't known really how to respond in just a letter.
 
Concerning the relationship between communicative acts and the general
 
communicative style of a society, I believe I said in my article that my
 
overall position on this matter had been strongly influenced by the word of
 
my brother. Alan Lomax, and his colleagues in the Cantometrics Project coming
 
out of Columbia University.  He has written extensively on this general
 
hypothesis  I shall try to enclose at least some bibliography.  I do not
 
think, however, that you will find any single  "study" of the kind
, that I
 
think you are asking about.  My brother's work has been to try to sketch in
 
the large world-size picture of communicative styles' I am sure there have
 
been articles stemming out of his work, but I do not have the references
 
available.  Overall, his is a very general and widespread notion that many
 
people have tackled from many angles -
-
 many of the socio-linguists and such
 
people as Edward Hall take this general stance, for example, though they move
 
off in different directions.
 
Concerning your data base, I am not a psychologist nor a trained student of
 
behavior, so I do not know how large a base of observed behavior you need in
 
order to generalize.  The article that I used in my paper which reported on
 
Japanese and American mother and infant behavior ought to give you an idea of
 
that dimension.
 
As for your final question, I used every single source I could find on the
 
lullaby, combing the libraries at UCLA and the University of California
 
Berkeley.  There may have been materials published since, of course, but I
 
was startled that the topic had received so little attention.  I really don't
 
know anything about lullabies I didn't put in that paper -
-
 and it was a
 
tentative paper suggesting some further research possibilities.
 I don't
 
really feel qualified to advise you on how to organize your research overall.
 
It does seem to me that there is one angle that you are especially qualified
 
to pursue that might he productive, and that is the lexical content of
 
Japanese lullabies.  That was the element missing 1n my paper.  I could compare
 
and discuss the texts of American lullabies and the behavioral context in
 
2
 
which the songs were sung- but in the Japanese data I had only the description
 
of the mother's and infant's behavior.  Perhaps you could focus at least a
 
good part of your study on textual analysis of Japanese lullabies! I have
 
the notion there may be many more Japanese than American lullabies, and the
 
analysis would therefore have to be much more extensive.
 
My final bit of advice is that I believe you are setting yourself too big
 
a canvas anyway.  I am not clear at what stage you are in your studies, but
 
I would try tackling the big problem in a series of smaller bites rather
 
than the large definitive work you seem to have planned.  Please forgive
 
me if I am being presumptious here; I am not your professor and do not totally
 
understand just what you are working towards anyway.  In any case, I do wish
 
you well and hope that some of the above notions will be helpful.
 
Cordially,

R
ef.:
 Just about one year and half have passed since
 
you gave me a response for my letter. Because it was
 
rather long time ago, I am afraid that you have already
 
forgotten what my letter was all about.
 
Over two years have passed since I decided t
o
 
write about lullabies i
n my thesis project. I have been
 
working on it almost by myself. But i
ribrder t
o make my
 
t
hesis rather i
nteresting and significant, I really need
 
a proper help f
or r
ay project. Since my project has adopt-
e
d
, your idea, I would like you t
o tell me whether or
 
not I
 an on a right track or not. I really wish t
o see
 
you and have your oral instruction, but I do not have
 
enough money t
o t
ravel, so could you possibly give me
 
your comment after reading the enclosure ?
 
As I mentioned already, I an anxious to make
 
this thesis significant. Furthermore, I am seriously
 
thinking seeking for Ph. D
, in folklore. Because of my
 
intention, I really would like t
o start aiming r
ay goal
 
with this thesis. Please do tell me what you feel on
 
this introduction of the thesis, I will send you addi-
t
ional information gradually.
 
I
 am looking f
orward t
o receiving your reply
 
as soon as possible. I will close this letter with my
 
new mailing address because I soon take off to the Umatilla
 
Indian Reservation, Oregon for my thesis project.
 
Thank you.

Ref.  Petition for a Tribal C

hesis Project, e
ntitled
 
The Origin of Lullabies: Cross-cultural C
omparative Study among
  
t
he Native American, t
he W
hite American, and t
he Japanese. "
 
I am truly pleased t
o have an opportunity t
o write to you
 
on t
his special occasion. I am Erick Masuyama and have been work-
ing on my Master's t
hesis project, entitled "  The Origin of Lullabies:
 
Cross-cultural C
omparative Study among the Native American, t
he W
hite
 
American, and t
he Japanese. "  The r
eason why I am writing t
o you i
s
 
that I would l
ike you t
o offer mw a s
pecial understanding that po-
ssibly c
onfer a significant credit on W
arm Springs Indians as well a
s
 
on myself.
 
In considering accademic studies poured into e
specially
 
Native American population, numerous studies and researches on
 
Indian &znces, music, l
anguages, and customs on r
eservations
 
across t
he U
.S., have been done for years. W
arm Springs Indian
 
Reservation was not an exception. Due t
o its preservation of
 
Indian culture, Warm Springs Reservation has been attracting
 
many a scholar and r
esearcher throughout t
he nation. I consequent-
l
y face l
ots of chances t
o h
ear people on this reservation saying
 
that there i
s even no piece of information l
eft t
o be discovered
 
for my t
hesis project, showing t
heir t
edious attitude t
owards r
e-
s
earches. T
he r
eason, however, why I c
an anxious t
o  obtain tribal
 
clearance for ny project i
s primarily because my r
esearch not only
 
is completely different from t
hose which have b
een done for l
ast
 
s
everal d
ecades of t
his century, but also has never been done  by
 
anybody else but me.
 
Briefly talking of what I have been actually l
ooking for,
 
I have been attracted b
y t
he d
ynamics of unconsciously inherited
 
h
eritage of Native Americans and its relationship with t
he origin
 
of l
ullabies a
s t
he t
arget of my project. W
hat I meant by t
hat i
s
 
that ,  on t
he first place, t
he way of nursing babies verbally app-
ears t
o have been handed down unconsciously from mother t
o daughter
 
g
eneration after generation d
espite of t
he fact t
hat  the U
.S.
 
government integrational policy t
o American Indians brought about
 
the half-loss on Indian l
anguages. It i
s interesting t
o mention
 
t
hat I evidently observed a 6 year o
ld C
olville Indian girl pre-
c
isely imitate her mother and t
alk t
o h
er baby brother in the same
 
way a
s h
er mother does. I felt t
hat I saw t
he dynamics just in front
 
of me. And most of all, not only t
he C
olville girl, but also most
 
Indians carry the heritage not in t
heir Indian l
anguages, but in
 
English out of which Indian h
eritages have never grown. Moreover,
 
providing a deta
 l
ied information on the oral h
eritage, Indian.E app-
raoch t
heir babies by cooing (
 includes calming and smoothing babies
 
by making noises vocally ) a
s well a
s t
alking t
o t
heir babies.
 
Then, h
ow i
s t
he Indian heritage related t
o t
he origin of
 
l
ullabies ? In order t
o solve t
his question, l
et me introduce you
 
one l
ullaby collected by myself on t
he Yakima Indian Reservation.
 
(
 SEE THE LAST PAGE OF THIS LETTER )
 Focusing on t
he structure of
 
t
he l
ullaby, we are easily able t
o be aware of t
he fact that the
 
l
ullaby i
s e
ssentially c
onstituted with words and s
ound. As a ma-
t
ter of fact, about 8
0% of l
ullabies I have collected from t
he
 
North American Indians d
isclose t
he t
endency. W
hat I would l
ike
 
t
o emphasize h
ere i
s you might be able t
o guess, t
hat t
he way of
 
t
alking t
o babies must have caused s
ignificant influence on t
he pro-
c
ess of t
he creation of l
ullabies away back in t
he past. According
 
t
o Dr. Hawes, a comir
tunicative style of a society may dominate a
 
communicative act of t
he society. Thus, I am sure t
hct I can prove
 
my h
ypothesis b
y not only observing verbal interaction between
 
caretaker (
 mother, father, grandparent, babysitter, etc. ) and
 
h
er (
his) baby, but also eventually gaining enough data that Na-
t
ive Americans v
erbally take care of their babied by cooing a
s
 
well as t
alking. In fact, thanks t
o t
he Yakima Indian Nation, t
he
 
C
olville Indian Tribes, and Portland Urban Indian Council, I have
 
been making a progress on my project. Furthermore, Umatilla Indians
 
are willing t
o cooperate me in near future.
 
Besides, I will emploY
the same investigation on t
he r
elation-
ship between W
hite American and Japanese maternal care and their
 
l
ullabies so as my project positively identify t
he influence of ma-
t
ernal care t
o the origin of l
ullabies if I c
an able t
o obtain de-
s
irable data from my investigation. Also, at the sa
me t
ime, my pro-
ject d
eals with international and national e
lements of l
ullabies on
 
t
he stage of t
he evolution of l
ullabies t
hrough  which we can po-
s
sibly s
ee s
imilarities and differences among these different e
thenic
 
groups.
 
Lastly, explaining what I would l
ike t
o do on your reservation,
 
I d
o wish t
o f
ind eight (
8) volunteers with t
heir 2
-8 months old
 
babies, t
o v
isit t
heir homes, and t
o watch the v
erbal interaction
 
between t
he volunteers and their babies for three h
ours, focusing
 
on t
he way of talking t
o babies.
 
As I have mentioned already, I will never forget the co-
operation by M
.C.H. program of the Yakima Indian Nation and Port-
l
and Urban Indian Council, and W
.I.C. program of the Colville In-
dian Tribes. If your generous acceptance allows me to execute my
 
study on this r
eservation, your name will be ascribed forever on
 
my mind as well as on my thesis. Please l
et me have a tribal per-
mission and work with Ms. Kathleen Moses who is a specialist on
 
this particular area. Your early attention will be appreciated.

To whom it may concern:
 
I thank you very much for paying much attention for my poster. No matter
 
how much time and effort I put into my thesis, it never be concluded with-
o
t
 
out you and your baby as the indispens$ble cooperator for my project. By
 
your request, I will explain a bit more fully my interest in lullabies.
 
As a child, I was devotedly engaged in musical activities and had many
 
opportunities to sing old lullabies which had been carried down from ge-
neration to generation up to the present in rural portions of Japan. Every
 
time I sang them, they reminded me of some infantile memories of mine,
 
such as my mother's smell, her face, and a mole on her neck, which were
 
obscurely retained at the bottom of my mind as a legacy of my infancy. I
 
felt as though I had been back to my infanthood, and enjoyed these reen-
counters with my past through lullabies whenever I sang them in a concert.
 
The motivation which let as decide to investigate my treasures from a
 
scientific pâ¢int of view was dependent not only upon my desire to know more
 
about my treasures from a new standpoint, but also largely upon an acquaint-
ance with the professor, Dr. Manabe, in my university in Japan. What I learn-
ed rom him was how to understand and treat folk literature as a folk-cultural
 
representative of the people's voice.
 
While I was studying my treasures with
 
the professor, I felt like researching
 
something by myself. Since travel is
 
now relatively easy, we can study culture
 
comparatively. I therefore decide to focus
 
upon the great migration carried out by
 
American Indiana, The more I read books
 
and reports discussed on the Asiastic
 
origin of American Indians and found some
 
similarities between Asian people and
 
Indians scientifically, the deeper my in-
terest in this Indian migration from the
 
Old World to the New World became.
 
/
 
/  ,
 
My research led me to consider if I might even find similarities by doing
 
a cross-cultural analysis of Japanese and Indian lullabies. And ultimately,
 
my ambitious mind to investigate similarities with my treasures let me fly
 
to this continent.
 
In addition to the researches into orientals (
 specifically the Japanese )
 
and American Indians, I would like to include white Americans in my thesis,
 
both becuase they are origianlly immigrants from an Old World like Indians
 
from their native place, and because my comparative and contrastive thesis,
 
dealing with the occidental and oriental culture, will exploit a new angle
 
for a further investigation to the domain of folklore if I get a success on
 
my project.
 
At this point, my readers must be curious about the contents of my thesis,
 
I suppose. To meet your demand, I will portray what I am trying to explore
 
in my project, titled "  The Origin of Lullabies: Cross-cultural Comparative
 
Study among the Japanese, the White American, and American Indians. 1
1 
As the origin of the word, "lullaby,"
 
indicates (
 it derives from the Swedish
 
word, "lulla," which means "sing to
 
sleep" )
, a lullaby is literally one
 
of the methods to put a baby sleep.
 
Frankly, it is originated for its
 
purpose. In fact, to fulfill this func-
tion, great numbers of lullabies in the
 
three nations employ the repetition of
 
the word, "sleep," and they also try to
 
bestow all-rightness by using the terms
 
like "  Go to sleep. Mother is here. You
 
are safe. Everything is all right. 1
1 
Another common theme of lullabies are
 
promises and bribes for good behavior.
 
In a Japanese lullaby, bribes, toy drums
 
and papier-m
h  dogs are rewards if a
 
baby will fall asleep without giving trouble to his mother. And 2 white
 
American lullaby, "  Baby Bunting, "  tries to put a bab% to sleep, promising
 
a rabbit skin, like the following:
 
Bye, baby bunting
 
Daddy's gone a-hunting
 
Gone to get a rabbit skin
 
To wrap the baby bunting.
 
On the contrary, threats, like "  If you don't go to sleep,a bogy who likes
 
eating a baby is going to come here, "  also creates a theme of lullabies.
 
As well as these themes above, lullabies often illustrates maternal ad-
miration, enumerating baby's personal beauties and charms, comparing him
 
to flowers, stars, princes and jewels.
 affection toward her baby
 
who is the apple of her eye and the most precious treasure in the world
 
let her compose this kind If lullabies.
 
With the classification of themes of lullabies above, I would like to app-
roach the origin of lullabies by concentrating upon their themes and analyze
 
the contents of lullabies through thematic study. And not only the thematic
 
study, but also I would like to focus upon their folkloristic functions -in
 
this portion of my thesis because a lullaby is one of the folkloristic re-
presentatives which reflect the people's voice, and therefore it presents the
 
functions of folklore. Here, I will employ the theory, "  Four Functions of
 
Folklore, "  by William H. Bascom, and investigate lullabies with it.
 
Following the presentation of the substantial origin of lullabies, I will
 
explore lullabies from a different viewpoint at the next chapter. As the
 
proverb says,
 So many conutries, and so many customs. "  I have noticed
 
many differences from my countries both in custom and culture. An awareness
 
of an arrangement of ideas in the speech of American people, as one of the
 
differences from us, amazed me and let me change my way of speaking in English
 
into a more id
.eomatic pattern. As for a basic feature of English speech,
 
people tend to begin with a statement of the central idea of a speech and
 
provide a series of subdivisions of the central idea. This straightforward-
ness of the development of English speech subconsciously reflects itself in
 
an English writing. In writing, a central idea appears in a topic sentence. In
 
other sentences of a paragraph, following the topic sentence, all  inds of
 
information are supplied for the purpose of developing the topic sent f
lce
 
and also for preparing for the addition of other ideas in later paragraphs.
 
From the above discussion on the relationship between the English speech
 
pattern (
 or thought pattern )
 and its writing, we can conclude that a
 
communicative act to some degree fits the overall communicative style of a
 
society.
 
Here, one question arises. The question is that as far as lullabies are a
 
mean to express our ideas to other people, so-called a communicative act,
 
should they suit the communicative style, specifically the style of talk-
ing of caretakers (
 mother, father, grandfather, nurse, etc. )
 who are the
 
composers and cherishers of lullabies ? It is upon this point that I do need
 
cooperation from you and your baby. To protect you from having a subconscious
 
knowledge about detailed research and my expectations and prospects for the re-
sult of my observation, which apparently dominates my observation. (
 Of
 
course, I am sure to tell them to you as soon as my observation is over. )
 
What I can say about my observation is that only I would like to watch your
 
behavior toward your baby for exactly -
 hours, with emphasizing upon the
 
way of your talking.
 
When we have this kind of observation, we do have not to forget some ob-
stacles, preventing us from having an acceptable observation, such as ob-
servee's nervousness which keep him from doing a natural behavior, because
 
of the eyes of an observer; and rewards. As to the rewards for your cooperation.
 
honestly, I do not have a desirable situation to make a payment to you right
 
now. I can not help asking you to be a llunteer. Or the only thing that I
 
can do for the payment is a late payment. Since I can work as much as possible
 
after I go back to Japan, I am sure
 
to send you 00dollarB (
 $3/hr
 )
 as soon as I can. About this p
 
swear upon the Bible as a christian.

Introduction
 
Th e revival of folk traditions that had already been set on
 
rails leading them into extinction, has been palying an interesting role
 
in Japanese soceity for the last decade. Perhaps mainly because of our retro-
spection on what is about to be lost and recede away from our mind, the
 
prevention of these M
 half-lost traditions has been rapidly taking place
 
in M g order to hand them down to the next generation. In addition, our
 
tedium and rebellion against the quickly-advancing soceity in which we
 
had tried to catch up with  Western nations by adopting their civilization
 
and leaving our own traditions InUm
M behind definitely accelÃ©!ated the
 
revivalistic movement. No matter what let us re-consider the importance
 
of the folk traditions, our awareness of the responsibility for carrying
 
these folk traditions down, generation after generation has, however,
 
resulted in folk traditions bargained from closets and displayed in front
 
of us through the mass-media. The nature of these folk traditions has been
 
somewhat distorted and misinterpreted, and at the same time they have
 
MR been after all utilized Od in the hands of commercialization and
 
treated as pieces of merchandise. Folk lullabies of are not an exception.
 
Along with this revivalistic movement, folk -
_
-
 lullabies have been highly
 
evaluated due 1 not only to their musical but also isplicational qualities.
 
To be honest with you, I being against this movement fully contaminated
 
by the commercialism, an completely satisfied with the evaluation of the
 
lullabies. And yet m
y mmmi worry is that both the evaluation and folk
 
lullabies thesselces will vanish when the revivalistic movement comes to
 
the end.
 
My motivation in this thesis has nver  been an extension of the
 
movement , and yet my worry towards the movement  definitely has con-
tributed to my exploration of folk lullabies. Here in this thesis, I
 _ J-
would like t
o dedicate my study to people addicted to this boom]ike
 
movement in order both to let them be aware of what folk lullabies have
 
actually been contributed for u, and ultimately to
 -
 enhance the
 
evaluation of the lullabies before their possible and perpetual dis-
appearance with the end of the movemet happens. Furthermore, I will under-
take this accademic study for the sake of folk lullabies, whose real meanings
 
tends to be forgotten by the overwhelming revivalistic movement wiped off
 
our soceity, and that enchant me as if I were a boatman captured by Lorelei's
 
facinating melody, wandering around in the pest memories of my childhood
 
which are obscurely retained at the bottom of my mind as a legacy of my
 
Infancy.
 
The Problem.
 
In considering the origin of lullabies, we initially ought to
 
trace them back to the O n discussion of their main branch, inclusively
 
called
 music.
 
For centuries, the origin of music has been one of the most
 
controversial problems of enthusiastic scholars. As a matter of fact,
 
numerous scholars locate the moment of the birth of music wi
 p&-
historic human beings. These theories have created marvelous sensations
 
in ON the domain of the study of music. None of them, however, has
 
decisive potential of W  effectiveness to be determined as the most
 
reliable theory of the origin of music. For essentially, we are not able
 
to observe what actually happened to the origin of music in a pre-
historic time. Seeing is undoubtedly believing. Being evidently
 
different from chemists' whose approaches inevitably depend upon the whole
 
process of every single reaction of chemicals taking place  in the
 
sight of the chemists from the beginning to the end to invent new
 
existence  that they have never encountered on this a  planet, the in-
vestigation those who are engaged in is rather demanded to deduce hidden
 
factors of certain existence without actually or possibly witnessing
 
them, and yet with establishing hypothesis backing up by all sorts of
 
related evidences in order to i
dentify the factors that we have never
 
confronted.
 
To settle up the discussion of the origin of music, many a
 
question has been asked and answered throughtout centuries. As one of the
 
pursurers, Ralph Vaughan Williams starts up his discussion on the origin
 
of music in
 National Music
 with an essential questionz Why do we want
 
(
need) music ?
 
Why then do we want music ?  Hubert Parry in his
 
Art of Music
 writes, "
 It is the intensity of the
 
pleasure or interest the artist feels in what is
 
actually present to his imagination that drives him
 
to utterance. "  1)
 
Providing a few -
-
 -
 -
 supplementals for his statement, we should
 
picture to ourselves the pre-historic era when people had no know-
ledgeof what people today think perfectly simple, such as light follcws
 
darkness as the day the night; summer follows winter as the seasons come
 
and go; and thunder follows lightening as as they are just natural
 
happenings. Because of their ignorance of these natural phenomenon, they
 
beleived that trees, sun, I rain, animals, birds, fire, and everything else
 
were dwelt in by good and bad gods. This is the origin of dynamism and
 
animism. In order to please these gods, pre-historic men expressed their
 
adoration and awe to the gods simply with hand-clapping, foot-stamping,
 
by swaying their bodies to and fro, by shouting, shrieking, crying, and
 
sobbing, and by using language and repeating the same word over and over
 
again, 2)  These were the only means, at least they beleived, by which
 
they talked to the gods. Besides these queer grunts and yells that we
 
might be able to call singing, is also man's first attempt to express
 
his feelings for joy, sorrow, pain, rage, fear, and all sorts of human
 
emotions in rhythm and melody. Thus music could be looked upon as one of
 
'e most satisfying ways and necessities to show our emotions. The presen-
tation of our emotions in music is relatively regarded as the function
 
of music,
 
Likewise "
 The instinct of utterance, "
 -
i
ubert Parry remarks,
 
makes it a necessity to find terms which will be understood by other
 
beings.
 3
)  The u
tterance i
tself, as the next step of the invention of
 
music, calls for the
 IJ,. i
ridispensible interaction '
between a
 
composer and a listener which enhances the value of music from the stage
 
of self-exclamation to one of the measures to carry = W our thoughts and
 
emotions to other people.
 
But then how was music, that is now defined as a medium to convey
 
our emotions to others, propagated from a composer of music to others ?
 
Thanks to the brilliant invention of a musical note, we are able to preserve
 
any music for centuries without losing even a single note of music. Be-
fore the invention however, the preservation of music Abodmom4p relied
 
fully upon oral transmission. Suppose you happened to be in a musical
 
vwmb n contest as one of the judges and listened t
o contestants singing
 
a conpulsive song over and over again, you probably would be able to re-
alize  that each contestant showed slight differences in what we call
 
"
 interpretation I
I  according to their various temperments. But these
 
differences will never be broad since we are always able to refer back On
 
to the printed copy. And yet what would happen if there was no printed copy ?
 
Suppose there were three people whom I call a
,b, and c learning one
 
certain song, not from a printed copy, but from the individual performers
 
of the other three singers; A, B
, and C -
 that is to say, a learned from A
,
 
b from B
, and c
,C, and these learners performed the song to one another
 
after they were able to sing it. .
 Naturally they would add their
 
own predilections and would be astonished at a very wide margin of
 
differences among their renderings.
 
As another example, let us describe one of the army exercises,
 
called "
 messages, "
 in which soldiers are lined up in a row and their
 
officer gives a verbal message to the first soldier who passes it on to
 
the second, and so on to the end of the row; the last soldier of the
 
row has to report to the officer the message as he has just received it.
 
)
esptte of the fact that each soldier must have tried to be as accurate
 
as possible, the message quite often turned out at the end to be liffeTert
 
from what it passed at the beginning.
 
Now, then, this is exactly what happens in the oral trans -
mission of music. Moreover, different from these soldiers whose duty is
 
not to stop and reason why, but to pass on whatever they heard even if te
 
message passed on might be already nonsense by the time it reaches the middle
 
of the line, the oral
 F  transmitters of music are absolutely
 
liberated from the necessity for accuracy; that is to say, they are allowed
 
not to pass on what they  on't care about. One man invented a tune an
 d As o
 
sang it to his neighbors and children. On the process of the pro-
pagation of the tune to his generation or even to the next after his
 
t
i-P tune IS  unavoidably forced to face some changes in its qual.ty not
 
only becauS  of the trars itteTS' indIfference to the precise transc r
;t 
of tna tun', but also becalse consequentl
 .
 `0 '

'
iig t c
c
 
the a
 -
 tirg melody of t
 t
 
of the indifference, and visa versa.  (
 aiew melody possibly utilizes
 
the extant words of the tune )
 W
e can easily imagine what is to
 
happen to the tune af
t m after three or foru genarations go by. However,
 
this ought not to '
cc considered as a process of corruption and dis-
in egrat5of
l of music, but as a process of its groth and evolution.
 
Let me present  the last example. Harry Jackson sings a song to
 
two other men, 'vid -Albert and James Thompson. David Cilbert is a
 
real artist and not only transmittS the song precisely from Harry Jackson,
 
but also sees possibilities in the tune so as to add some touches to it,
 
giving it an added beauty. James Thompson, on the other hand, forgets every
 
part of the tune, and has to make it up the best as he can. Now what will
 
'
-
'appen to these versions ? David  1l ert's will l
ive c
-enerati )n afte
 
generation while T
ames Thompson's version will die with him. As y
ou
 
see, the transmission of oral music i
s a real process of natural se-
lection and survival of the fittest.
 
As music moved from a primitive staFe of self-expression to a
 
communicative- act, it provided a division of labor in which the composer
 
had a rsoorisib f
lity t
o compose and represent music, and a listener was
 
o-'
li ed to listen to it. I
n this primary stage, the composer had a do-
minant role in this interaction and was allowed t
o present whatever
 
he composed, and it was simply received by his list.ners.  owever, the AF
 
closer the correlation grew. the more these listners enthusiastically
 
occupied a pre-dominant part in this correlation, demanding all that
 
they were anxious to listen t
o in music. Music automatically had t
o  e
 
liberated from the composer's monopoly.
 
Music has now been categorized by i
ts musical divices and
 
termed such as classical, folk, pop, opera, jazz, rock music, etc,
 
implyin  how many different kinds of music have been proposed t
o satisfy
 
the demands of whole populations throughout centuries. Despite the di-
versity of race, religion, culture, custom, nationality, and soceity,
 
music has always been the reprsentative of people, by people, and for
 
people, and will be.

So far I have been stating that music is undoubtedly inter-
national through the two stages of the development of music in the pre-

rrobably, most of the readers except the ones being good at t
 
r
r
lan language, are not quite able t
o figure out my intention on the passage
 
written in the unfamiliar language. Actually, it is the whole story of
 
the diffusion of language (
 The Tower of Bahie )
 borrowed from  "
 Die
 
Pabel.
 J

o understand his music unless he is good at music. Nusic, es-
pecially vocal music, can not be understood by anybody if he i
s not
 
capable enough to comprehend the language by which music is perform -6.
 
c
2
'viously, my statement can be criticized by music-lovers, i
nsistir
1  thai
 
music be always international whatever language we use. As a matter of
 
fact, numerous singers and musical groups travel from their owr coun-
tries to foreign lands with their music and are warmly welcomed. This
 
supposedly indicates that music, due to its i
nternational acceptance,
 
*
 has nothing to do with misunderstanding and mis-communication
 
among people on this planet caused by, what we biblically call, the
 
diffusion of language, but rather works t
o re-unite people on earth.
 
And yet, let i
nc give you a different type of example. 5ecause of the
 
reed for a universal language along with the rapid progress in po-
litical and economic relationships of all nations, artificial lan-
guages such as Esperanto were relatively inventedj however, they
 
have penerated less into the world than we had expected. For these
 
languages  wholly failed to carry t
he cultural and social inheritance
 
that has been supporting our languagesource. Languages are not i
nter-
national, and neither is music which is clearly defined as one of the
 
communicative acts in our soceity.
 
As I dISCUSSed  in the previous paragraphs, music is obvious-
ly international in the early stages of its origin, not only because
 
music is the emotional expression of human beif
l s, but also because it
 
i
s always the reflection of our human voice no matter by what kinds
 
of people music is owned. And yey, the diversity of our languages both *
 
brings about communicative problems among us, and at the same time, coulc
 
not help making music national at the last stage of the development of
 
music.
 
Nevertheless I appeared t
o waste plenty of pages for the
 
diversion, the discussion of the origin of music, this rather p
ro-
longed diversion eventually conferred on me a precious opportunIty t
o
 
open up and develop my discussion of the origin of lullattes; moreover,
 
to illustrate the more precise process of the
 growth an  d-
velopment of music by exploring one of the small divisions of music, term-
lullaby. "
 The following questions ought t
o be consequently raised
 
for my exploration of the origin of lullabiess Why do we need lullabies ?
,
 
What is the exact process of the invention and making of lullabies ?
,
 
and lastly, How far are lullabies i
nternational ? I will make efforts to
 
remove the vail off the origin of lullabies in the followir
iE chapters
 
by answering the questions cited above.
 
Hypothesis
 
A lullaby is defined as one of the branches of music possibly
 
presenting A
W both international and national factors, same as music
 
itself shown already, when growing and evolving from its primitive
 
stage to the advanced.
 
Statement of the Problem
 
As presented in the previous
 r
 segment, my i
nvesti-
ation will he proceeded along with the following questions*
 
1) Why do we need lullabies ?
 
2) What i
s the exact process of the i
nvention and
 
making of lullabies ?
 
)
 How far are lullabies inteenational ?
 
I
n &dition, the inevitability of cross-cultural comparative
 
study in this thesis project ought to be announced in this segment simply
 
b& ause the project itself deals with international and national factors
 
of lullabies. The problem of this study is thus stated Ik as a cross-
cultural U
 comparative study among t
he Japanese, the
 
Am ,!
.- oan, and the Native American, focusing upon similarities and
 
di ' r,nces among these three independent ethnic groups, as revealed
 
t su
 the development of lullabies,
 
Justification and Purpose of the Study
 
Despite the fact that this is supposed4 t
o turn out t
o be a
i.
 
accaderuic study on literature, even few
 1 piece of fragmental infor-
mation i
s provided to the subject matter, as far as the i
ntroduction of
 
the thesis goes up until to this segment. Against the anticipatior t
'
ra -,
 
we always have as being about t
o take a deep look at theses on literature,
 
this study is never a representation of either the anti-Semitism founc
 
i
n Shakespeare's "
 Merchant of Venice,
 the keen study of Christianit;
 
and human love in Milton's "
 Paradise Lost, w the alienation between th
 
advanced technological society, because of the industrial revolution, an
 
human psycho which was not able t
o catch up with  the society any lon e
 
in the Victorian Age, or anything e
lse in terms of literatur',  ut ti
 
t
hesis is more concerned with the s
tudy of lullabies (
 as mentioned al-
ready  )
 that oriEinated and was transmitted generation after generatior
 
by the unknown, and that therefor*, belongs to
 folk literature.
 
F
or centuries, folk literature buried deep underneath t
he fame
 
of
 fine '
 literature (
 from now on, fine literature i
s i
n use to avoid
 
a confusion with folk literature )
 has not been paid much attention by
 
literary scholars. Shakespear has always been a king of kings, a
d-
mired by the masters of literature. Scholars and students hurried to wai
 
upon him. So have they also upon Wordsworth, Dickens, Hemingway, Steinbeck,
 
and other writers, enchanting these scholars and students with their works
 
up t
o the present time. Meanwhile folk literature was squeezed out from
 
the domain of literature. And yet, fine literature is not the monoply of
 
scholars and students at school, but Â£ i
t has penetrated into our society,
 
and i
s supported by people throughout centuries. Besides, it has always
 
been an encouraging and influential stepping-stone to produce greater
 
works in the future generation. Can folk literature do for us as much
 
as f
ine 0 literature does ,
 ?  Furthermore, is it possible for me to
 
utilize lullabies belonging to folk literature,  for a thesis on lit-
erature ? And if yes, what is the purpose of a study that deals witY lu-
ila Ucs as literature ?
 
T
,  Aiphonso Smith, a head of the Department of
 
E
nglish in the
 
U
.S. Naval Accademy, once tw brings out six potential natures of lit-
erature in his work, "
 What can literature do for me ?
 According to
 
hj5,  fine literature can 1) give us an outlet, 2) keep before us the
 
vision of ideal, 3
) give us a better knowledge of human nature, L
i
.) re-
store the past to us, 5
) show us the glory of the commonplace, and
 )
 
lastly give us the mastery of out own language. I
, being '
back to the first
 
question regarding these natures of fine literature, can not help but in-
s
1st bW that folk literature can do for us as much as fine literature does.
 
F
ine literature not only expresses what we have already felt and
 
been dimly coming up to, but also expresses it with beauty, force, and
 
completeness so that we definitely know ourselves better, as the IM O MW
 -
,
rut'-.
 
Fine literature, Smith declares, "
 has been in behalf, not of professioral
 
writers and speakers, but of those who feel the need of a spokesman all
 
k'=Ll;
, because they lack the ability t
'ernselves to voice their
 
own feelings.
 5
)  ;
 
Smith gives us these two questions
 Did we never have an experience
 
like it ? and Did we never kill ot strike or hurt on innocent thing and
 
feel mean and lonly for UC it ? by exploring the poem, "
 Ancient Mariner,
 
by C
oleridge which goes asi
 
"There is a man who, by an act of cruelty done to a
 
harmless bird, came t
o feel himself outcast. He had
 
cut all the cards of sympathy that bound him to the
 
living things about him -
 to man and bird and beast.
 
we was so miserable that it was a small matter to him
 
whether he lived or died. At last his sympathy with
 
living things came back to him because, almost with-
out knowing it, he found himself rejoicing in the joy
 
of the water-snakes that played around the ship. Every-
thing is restored now as it was, and the law of love
 
is so burned into his soul that as long as he lives,
 
he must buttonhole others and tell them his experience.
 
H6
 )
 
Smith concludes that "
 if so, we have lived "
 The Acient Mariner
 
without knowing it. The truth, represented here is obviously not a fact
 
that we have been unknowingly or knowingly taught as a fact from the
 
outside, but the poem is an outlet through which our thoughts and feel-
ings flow, and which deepen as they flow.
 
But the truth held gloriously by fine literature is never its
 
own provision. I n Let's pick out proverbs, one of the representatives
 
of folk literature, and thik through their function.
 
Do you know why Lincoln's Cettysberg speech is literature while
 
1
'ward Everette's delivered on the same occasion ? Everette states,
 
I should flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the
 
occasion i
n two hours as you (
 Lincoln
 )
 did in two minutes. "
 7)
 
Let's picture the scene. There were men, woman, and children in the
 
audience who had lost their husbands, wives, sons, and fathers on the
 
very battlefield where they now stood. It was obviously a holy place to
 
them. Definitely, Everette did not speak for the audience, but simply
 
th them, while Lincoln spoke for those who needed a spokesman, being
 
able t
o put their glorious and yet vexed emotions into fitting words
 
that filled up every heart.
 
Proverbs do the sa
ne. Proverbs, Archer Tayler, a  erinan
 
scholar and comparative folklorist, defines as follows:
 
A proverb is a terse didactic statement that
 
is current in tradition â¢, .  Most of the common-
ly used proverbs are metaphors drawn from daily
 
life or the observation of nature or are terse
 
summaries of experience.
 8)
 
Proverbs not only help us transform our half-formed thoughts, emotions,
 
and desires on our iind into _
_
_
_
 brief sentences. But also they lead
 
them out into harmony and completeness with ap stylistic devices such
 
as contrast (
 /
 Better late than never /
 )
; alliteration
 (
 /
 Live and
 
learn /
 )
; rime
 (
 /
 man proposes,  od disposes /
 )
; and repitition (
 /
 
Live and let live /
 )
 
After introducing us to Tennyson's
 
'
Joyage
 and
 ?udyard K
ipling's "
 To The True romance, "
 Smith explains
 
the vision of the i
deal that fine literature treats as follows?
 
9
9
 The poems cited treat the i
deal directly. It is
 
their theme. They attempt to define and expound it.
 
Put every masterpiece of literature, whatever its
 
theme, is rooted in an i
deal, reflects an i
deal, and
 
thus illustrates an i
deal. It must be remembered that
 
the i
deal grows out of the real. The real is never a
 
perfect pyramid: it is truncated. The top is miss-
ing. We vaguely feel the lack, but the poet visualizes
 
the complete whole and then tells what he sees.
 9
)
 
F
ine literature, thus deals with the lack we constantly feel in the real,
 
fills up the lack with its theme, and ultimately represents the i
deal
 
of completeness. But this second nature is by no means the monoply of
 
fine literature. A look at the fable, another form of folk literature
 
will illustrate this.
 
Fables, although their themes are already well-known by us,
 
chiefly inculcate a moral lesson for human e beings and satarize the
 
conduct of human beings. Obviously, they, like f
ine literature, pic-
ture an ideal, especially moral i
deals in a metaphorical way. I M Let's
 
take a look at Aesop Fables, "
 The I = North Wind and the Sun.
 
"
 Between the North Wind and the Sun, they say, a con-
test of this sort arose, to wit, which of the two would
 
strip the goatskin from a rustic plodding on his
 
way, The North Wind first began to blow in such wise
 
as when he blows AWW from Thrace, thinking by sheer
 
force to rob the wearer of his cloak. And yet no
 
more  on that account did he, the man, relax his
 
hold; instead he shivered, drew the borders of his
 
garment tight about him every way, and rested with
 
his back against a spur of rock. Then the Sun peep-
ed forth, welcome at first, bringing the man relief
 
from the cold, raw wind. Next, changing, he turned
 
the heat on more, and suddenly the rustic felt too
 
hot and of his own accord threw off the cloak, and
 
so was stripped.
 
Thus was the North Wind beaten in the contest. And
 
the fable sayss "
 Cultivate gentleness, my son; you
 
will get results oftener by persuasion than by the
 
use of force. "
 10)
 
The theme of the fable eventually ends up with the proverbial phrase,
 
simply teaching us a moral lesson. The theme of the fable truly applies
 
to our life. Looking back our human history, we have often declared
 
wars and lost millions of innocent people after all because W  we
 
were stupid enough to solve problems b
y the use of force. We all know the
 
difficulty of behaving like Mahatma Gandhi. The theme of the fable
 
actually visualizes this moral ideal that human beings have been con-
stantly trying to accomplish for centuries. This ideal, without any
 
doubt, grows out of the real whose top is missing. Likewise fine litera-
ture, folk literature play an role to give us a vision of ideal.
 
The third mature of fine P literature is explained by Smith
 
as follow.,
 
We are thinking not of the men who wrote these
 
great epics, dramas, novels, and short stories,
 
but of the men and women who move through their
 
pages, who give them interest and immortality, and
 
who are themselves more alive than their creators.
 
A study of these men and women, we hold, will
 
greatly widen and deepen your knowledge of human
 
nature.
 11)
 
This statement can not help reminding me of two historical master-
pieces,
 Madame Bovery "
 written by Gustane Flaubert, and Leo Tolstoy's
 
Anna Karenina. "
 What they are actually dealing with is an unsparing
 
dipiction of both  *ma's and Anna's gradual corruption, renouncing re-
spectable marriage and fine 
status for a passionate involvement which
 
offeres a definitr and yet momentary taste of freedom. Besides, these
 
novels, concerning the third nature of fine literature, savagely brings
 
about the ironic study of human shallowness and stupidity eventually causing
 
these heroines -
 social destructions in terms of adultery.
 
Here, these authors are genius and capable enough to create characters
 
and let them struggle in the bosom of human nature throughout their works.
 
However, the ones who actually struggle against the human nature are neither
 
Flaubert nor Tolstoy, but obviously both Ehma and Anna, now simply not
 
being one of the tools for these authors to make their novels interesting,
 
but being subtly a human individual whos* life is automatically applied
 
to ourselves. The destruction that falls to Emma and Anna possibly and
 
probably happens to us anytime. The human nature appearing in these novels
 
is perhaps human shallowness and stupidity consequently leading Emma and
 
Anna into destructionj however, what they implicitly dedicate themselves
 
to inform us is the freakish irresponsibility of human nature which is
 
well-explained in one of the comments on Shakespeare's "
 Midsummer Night's
 
Dream "
 as follows*
 
As far as the story of the lovers is concerned, the
 
introduction of the supernatural e
lement does not bring
 
about anything aW& which would have been impossible
 
mi or improbable without it. The magical love i
n
 
idleness really does nothing more than represent sy-
mbolically the familiar workings of actual love
 
in i
dleness in the human heart. B
oys i
n love change
 
their minds just so, or almost just so, without any
 
whisper of the fairies to guide them â¢..  The my-
stery, so to call it, the inexplicability which is
 
bound up with the central idea of the play, is the
 
existence of that freakish irresponsib
le element
 
of human nature out of which, to the eye of the comic
 
spirit, the ethical and emotional vagaries of lovers
 
take their rise. "  12)
 
The study of Mana
, and Anna unquestionably widens and deepens our
 
knowledge of human nature. So does a study of characters in fine litera-
ture generally. Smith continues his discussion on the importance of the
 
study
 
The knowledge that we get from everyday experience
 
may be good as far as it goes, but it does not go far
 
enough. It is neither broad enough nor deep enough.
 
To make it broader and deeper we must go to the
 
great laboratory of character creation that the masters
 
have fitted up and made accessible t
o us in litera-
ture. "  13)
 
The great laboratory of character creation found in fine litera-
ture found in fine literature is also co-owned by folk literature; further-
more, its laboratory might be such more facilitated than fine literatures.
 
Stith Thompson, i
mmmms a folklore scholar famous for his
 Tales of the
 
North American Indians,  "  once categorized all folktales scattered all
 
over the world Ak by their motifs in his voluminous work, "  Motif-
Index of  Folk-Literature. N  It is amazing to state that 25.000 different
 
motifs are discovered and record ed by GI
M
Thompson, and even more than
 
20.000 motifs are left over after deducting motifs concerning non-human
 
incidents such as gods, animals, fairies, ogres, etc. Now thinking of
 
how many numbers of characters apparently determined
 those motifs
 
Thompson represents, we ought to be aware of the immensity of the labora-
tory of character that folk literature proclaims.
 
As with the three natures discussed previously, the fourth
 
naturem W of fine literature  is easily recognized in folk literature.
 
The orator of the past appears t
o be an historian; however, Smith brings
 
out a claer distinction between the past as history and the past i
n
 
literature:
 
"
 The historian may galvanize the past, but the poet
 
vitalizes it.
 14)
 
Moreover, he obviously tells us  the benefit of t
re nan  tna  f
ire 1
i
a-
ture treats as fo L W E ;
 
We often speak of the irrevacable past, but to (
 fine
 
literature, there is no irrevocable past. Literature can not
 
only recall the past, but can make of it an ever-
lasting present. H  15)
 
When James Clavellvs "
 Shogun "
 was televized by NBC in America, f8  of
 
the whole population watched this historical saga.  Its success can be
 
attributed to the disclosure of the un-known Japanese feudalistic society
 
instantly attracting people's curiosity, and at the same time, its close-
ness to facts actually taking place hundreds of years ago, and yet being
 
seen in front of us at present of time, passing through the thick wall
 
of time. This is exactly what Smith talked about concerning the past that
 
fine literature Is dealing with. Fine literature has marvelous ability
 
to re-inspire life to the past so that it seems alive and present.
 
In folk literature, folk legends have played the same role to
 
visualize the past in front of us. Legends, according to "
 Standard Dic-
tionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend, "
 '
 have since come to
 
be used for a narrative supposedly based on fact, with an intermixture
 
of traditional materials, V OK told about a person, place, or incident.
 16)
 
There are plenty of legends always found about historical pre-dominant
 
people, places, and incidents which fine literature is good at frequent-
ly dealing with as its subject matter; however, in addition to the pre-
dominant, legends are focusing upon the un-known in history. Since being
 
fond of riding a bicycle *wwmmw
.
 I
, whenr'er my situation allows me,
 
take off to a long bicycle journey. One thing that I always pay such
 
attention to while on my journey is a landmark posted at historical sites
 
by local historians, informing us of legends about what happened on that
 
very site in the past. A person, or an incident which was engaged in the
 
site, or the site itself might h
ave decorated one of the pages of a local
 
history. Or it might not have due to the fact that it was too unknown
 
to be recorded even in a local history. But no matter whether it do-
minates a local history or not, legends ascribed on * the landmark let
 
us vividly picture faces of heroes and heroines who were confronting
 
something in a very moment of their lives, the scene of a certain in-
cident, or the glorious moment of the place, even though there is now
 
nothing left but a landmark on the site.
 
Once I
, being proud that I
 W was the best student in history at
 
school, was asked a very may question by one of my friendes Who built
 
the Great Wall of China ? As it was as e
asy as ABC, I indignantly answer-
ed, "
 Ch'in Shih Huang Ti built it, you dummy. "
 Because I was expect-
ing his positive response, I was astonished by his reply,
 Nop, un-
known brick masons built the Great 1K Wall .  "
 It is impossible to con-
jecture how many people left their names in our history, and it is even
 
half-nonsense t
o think how many people have ever lived and passed away
 
on earth. However, as far as An the fourth nature of
 literature
 
goes, folk literature restores this past to us overwhelmingly better
 
than fine literature does.
 
As for the fifth nature of fine literature, Smith makes a
 
statement on the glory of the commonplace that fine literature is
 
able to show us as follows:
 
it (
 the appreciation of poetry )
 is the most
 
effective and the most accessible of all the
 
means whereby a man may vitalize his thinking
 
about the common, elemental things of life.  And *
 
to do this, to feel the greatress and the wd
 
ltionehips of everyday things, is t
o receive a
 
now access of power and happiness. "
 Genius, "
 
said Professor James Frederick Ferrier, "
 is no-
thing else than the power of seeing wonders in
 
common things. "
 17)
 
Fe,e, in order to prove that the contribution of folk litera-
ture i
s e
quivalent t
o that of fine literature, let me introduce t
o yo'
 
one poem from each fine and folk literature and make a close com-
parison of them.
 
Flaubert once advised Goethe: "
 Look at a tree until it
 
appears to you just as it app.ras to every one else, then look at it
 
till you se' what no man h
as ever seen before.
 
"
 18) I M The poets,
 
citing the following poems that I as about to introduce, definitely
 
follow F
laubart's advice.
 
Percy  .
 Shelley, one of the pre-dominant poets i
n the - 
omantic Period (
 1798 -
 1832 )
 describes a skylark in â¢'
 To Skylark."
 
Hail to thee, blithe Spiriti
 
Bird thou never wert - 
That from Heaven,or near it,
 
Pourst thy full heart
 
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
 
Higher still and higher
 
From the earth thou springet
 
Like a cloud of fire;
 
The blue deep thou wingst,
 
And singing still dost sore, and soring ever singest.
 
In the golden lightning
 
Of the sunken Sun - 
O
'er which clouds are brightning,
 
Thou dost float and run;
 
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
 
The place purple even
 
Melts around thy flight,
 
Like a star of Heaven
 
In the broad day-light
 
Thou art unseen, -
 but yet I hear thy shrill delight.
 
Keen as are the arrows
 
Of that silver sphere,
 
Whose intense lamp narrows
 
In the white dawn clear
 
Until we hardly see -
 we feel that it i
s there.
 
All the earth and air
 
J
 With thy voice is loud,
 
As when Night is bare
 
From one lonely cloud
 
The moon rains out her beams
 and Heaven is overflowed."19)
 
Although we are unable to identify when and who originated
 
the next song, we ought to take a look at the chant handed down by
 
Papago India n
s from Southern Arizona, and compare it to Shelley's poem.
 
A black-headed eagle

Flapped its wings.
 
A white-headed eagle
 
On alow rock
 
Descended,

When he alights

Toward me it is walking;
 
Its down feathers blow in the freeze,
 
A hawk is running,
 
Toward me it is running;
 
Its down feathers ruffle in the wind,
 
,
gle, my older brother,
 
Like a bow, in every direction,
 
Your long feathers are bent.
 
Hawk, my younger brother,
 
Like arrows, in every direction,

I was drunk,

 20)
 
I did not 1,ring them out t
o simply judge which one is superior or
 
inferior t
o the other despite the fact that not only I but also you ar e
 
if
to able t
o analyze these poems technically and point out many a place
 
to be either granted or criticized. However, the reason why I brought
 
then out is to understand the ability of folk literature which possibly
 
contributes the fifth nature to us just as fine literature does. Whether
 
or not, fine literature overwhelms folk literature on the scale of quality
 
according to the fifth nature of literature,
, 
.

here, should admitt that folk literature as already seen above
, , is able
 
to carry out the fifth nature.
 
When we reach to th

literature is not able to excecute this last responsibility. u

One re
of folk literature amonr children is the potential a
that It holds for child-
ren tending to live in a fantastic world. Besides, folk literature is
 
usually written in a plain language so as to be understood by all. In
 
this way,  folk literature becomes one of the measures to learn the lan-
guage of our own in our early childhood.
 
The contribution of folk literature can be also seen in nur-
son for the popularit ly
 
r
.

 and Dori s Young

Mot her
 
Much of the appeal of Mother Goose i
s i
n the
 
varied language patterni the rhythm and rhyme of
 
the versesi the alliteration of many lines such as;
 
Wee Willie Winkle runs through the town, "  or
 
Deedle deedle dumpling my son John.
 Children love
 
the sound of the words for they are experimenting
 
with language in this period of their dev.lopeaer%t.
 
The greatest growth in language developement is a-
chieved between ages of approximately eighteen months
 
and six years. The child learns now words every-
day; he likes to try them out, to chant them in his
 
play. Mother Goose rhymes help satisf  this pre-
occupation with language pattern 
s
."21)
 
Moreover, the employment of nursery rhymes at school, marvelously
 
bringing out the prompt growth on the language activity of children, was
 
reported by Stanley J. Zehm, am assistant professor in the department
 
of e
ducation at Washington State University a few years ago. He intro-
duced a revised nursery rhyme to his sixth A
W graders and encouraged
 
them to revise the nursery rhymes that they know by themselves. Through
 
this revision of nursery rhymes, Zehm found out the following objectives
 
that nursery rhymes helped him achieve: 22)
 
1) Link the study of language and literature more
 
closely.
 
2) Provide an opportunity for lively production of oral
 
and written language.
 
3
) Provide a context for genuine vocabulary buildin .
 
L)  Promote thp meaningful use of dictionary and
 
thesaurus.
 
Just like the castle on the sand, if the fundamental of
 
our conprehensive ability on our own language is not steady enough, we
 
are not able to keep up the ability of ours to the mastery of our
 
language, or even
 able to catch up with it. Therefore, although Folk
 
literature fails to carry out the sixth nature of fine literature, it
 
definitely contributes  as preparation for fine literature.
 
In conclusion of the discussion towards the first question whe-
ther folk literature can do for us as such as fine literature does, I
 
rather emphasise on the subtle ability of f.lk literature to contribute
 
itself for us as such as fine literature does throughout the whole
 
explanation of the dedication of folk literature for us in the rather
 
long previous asgient. Furthermore, this prolonged expalriatior, I
 
am pretty sure that, -
 well-proves the eligibility to employ
 
lullabies belonging to folk literature for the thesis or
. literature.
 
Ultimately, let me discuss the purpose of the study, deal-
ing with lullabies as l
iterature in the rest of the pages of this seg-
ment
 
Thanks to public education, we are now able to enjoy read-
ing great works by gifted literary masters; however, when Dickens
 
brought out his "  Old Curiosity Shop," spending time reading litera-
ture was exclusively monopolized by the upper and middle class people,
 
while the lower-class was victimized by the Industrial Revolution as
 
one of the gears to promote the revolution. As clearly i
llustrated i
n
 
The Old Curiosity Shop,
 L
ittle Nell's once beloved pastoral t
own
 
is now i
r
tdustialized and, as a historical fact, women and childran were
 
forced to work with severe hard-labor. One of history books tells us
 
the severeness of the labor likes
 
The working conditions for children in the coal
 
mines were even worse than in the mills. Boys and
 
girls too were sent down them at the age of five.
 
N
ot till 18142 did Parliament prohibit all female
 
labor =
W  underground and limit the recruit-
ment of lads working in the pits. It now seems i
n-
credible that the age fixed for permissible boy-
labor in the mines was ten. A C
ommission of Inquiry
 
had reported in 181
4
.2 that the children had been
 
chained, belted, and
 harnessed like
 
dogs "  to pull the trucks of coal.
 
Another form of child-slavery was the apprenticing
 
of workhouse children t
o master chimney-sweeps at
 
the age of six or seven, a fate narrowly escaped b
y
 
Oliver Twist. Being so small these little wretches
 
could squirm their way  up narrow chemneys. Often
 
they were terrified and were then forced on by
 
the lightning of a fire underneath them. Measures
 
were passed in 181
1
.0 and 1861
4 intended t
o make this
 
kind of appenticeship illegal, but there was such
 
evasion and the abominable system was not complete-
ly stopped until 1871
1."23)
 
Under the circumstances, the literate education had almost no
 
chance t
o be applied to the lower-class people. As a matter of fact,
 
the illiteracy rate in !gland in 1799-1804 only decr
sed t
o 46
 
from the 491 reported in 1754-62
 despite the fact that !gland was one
 
of the most literate countries at the beginning of the 18th century.
 
About this incident, Carlo N
. Cipolla gives a clear and convincing
 
reason as follows:
 
On theother hand, by offering increased a opp-
ortunit ies for the employment of children, the
 
Industrial Revolution raised the opportunity cost
 
of e
ducation and therefore affected negatively the
 
-
 -
 -
-
 consumption demand for it. The con-
sequence of all this was that in England, until
 
the middle of the nineteenth century, while the  
economy expanded, popular education stagnated, The
 
proportion of wealth available to be devoted to
 
e
ducation must have declined throughout the period.
 
Accrued wealth was used to employ more children
 
in the factories rather than keep them i
n the
 
schools, "
 24)
 
c
treme poverty barred the working class and peasants from
 
even e
lementary education before the 18th century, but songs and pro-
verbs were the major sources of instruction. In addition, because of
 
the absence of literary masters who were even curious enough t
o help
 
them speal< for them until Dickens emerged to rescue them with his works,
 
one of the ways that these people had of expressing their g opinions
 
and complaints was in singing songs called lampoons whose purpose was
 
just the same as our modern cartoons, t
o poke fun at political I&
MMIt-
abuses. Ever today, the songs are remembered although their true mean-
ings have been forgotten in the mists of many years.
 
In order t
o let you
 be aware of the legacy of one of the
 
lampoons that still exists in our days, I introduce one of the popular
 
nursery rhymes which still amuses little.
 
Little Jack Hom er
 
Sat in the corner
 
Mating a Christmaspie;
 
He put in his thumb,
 
And pulled out a plum,
 
And said, What a good boy am I
 
This nursery jingle traces back its origin to the time of Henry VIII,
 
In spite of the loveliness that the rhyme creates in itself, this song
 
about Little Jack Hom er was originally sung to ridicule a pompous an
 
crafty man, Hom er by name. Jack Hom er was, in history, steward t
o
 
ichard Whiting, last of the abbots of Glaston bury. The story goes
 
that at the time of the Dissolution, Jack Hom er was sent to London by
 
the abbot perhaps hoping to appease Henry VIII with a present, that is
 
a Christmas pie in the rhyme, in which the title deeds of twelve manors
 
were hidden. '
 Eating a Chrim t
sasp e  He put in his thumb and pulled out
 
a plum, "
 obviously indicates the fact that on his journey, he opened the
 
pie and extracted one of the deeds for himself. According to an old tale,
 
he told the abbot that the King had given bi
n the deed to the Manor of
 
Mells.
 And said, What a good boy an I "
 is an evident ridicule to his
 
infamous deed. 25)
 
Let me here once again, emphasize onthe claer difference between
 
Lincoln's speech at r
Tettysburg and Everett's on the same occasion. Lin-
coin sympathetically and yet gloriously talked for them with vast care
 
and understanding of them while Everett did not, but simply talked to I
 
them. The difference of attitudes between Lincoln and Everett con-
sequently deprived literature from the meanongless for the people at
 
Gettysburg. Without mentioning, every writer appeared in the domain of
 
literature has been talking for us through his work. And V W yet, had
 
Shakespeare ever talked for the ordinary people being forced to endure
 
poverty in J
I
M his days ? N
o, he had not. Neither did anybody w e
i
.
 
literature was strictly p
ossessed in the hands of the royal and wealthy.
 
Songs I
lke lampoons and other folk literature were the only closest
 
friend for the poor, and t
o exploit such folk literature is perhaps
 
the only way to know what folk literature has been talking to them.
 
For uncountable years, we have been dedicating ourselves i
nto
 
the study on Shakespeare's works and other's. Professors have lectured
 
on thee. Students have written about thee on their theses and dissertations.
 
Numerous critics emerged and have debated on them â¢ And many a book has
 
been published to provide us information on thee. Furthermore, the same
 
thing will be surely taken place in future. I
, 00 too, admitt t
he great-
ness of fine literature. However, it is of necessity for us t
o admitt
 
rthe fact that only a few people who ever lived on earth in human his-
tory was able to spend time on reading fine literature, while the rest
 
was not. For the rest, folk literature has been the literature that al-
ways talked for them. And yet, despite the importance folk literature i
n
 
the domain of literatur", such has never been investigated in history.
 
I
, in this thesis, am anxious to take a deep look at lullabies and find
 
out messages that lullabies have been bringing out for us. And hope-
fully, this study will accelerate our accademic interest in lullabies
 
and eucourage us to execute further works in the near future.
 
Looking back to the time when I was asked who built the 'reat
 
Wa l
l of China by my friend, I an still able to picture the pride on his
 
face and disappointment on mine even though it happened to me over a
 
decade ago. Disappointed as I was, I have been thankful for being f
ooled
 
by him not only because the question tossed out by his eventually let
 
me change my vast interest in history of the superior and well-
known t
o of the un-known, b
ut also luckily, I was able t
o discover t
h
 
way to get acquainted with the un-known$ through folk literature. And â¢
 
most of all, I would not be able t
o be engaged in this thesis project,
 
if my fria h had not asked me the question, WHO BUILT THE 'NEAT WALL
 
OF CPINA ?
 
The Procedure of the Study and the Method of Analysis
 
This study is proceeded according with the problems already
 
stated previously. Furthermore, each problem is t
o be discussed in
 
different chapters and entitled such as
 
Chapter 2
s The Functional Origin of Lullabies.
 
Chapter 3
1 The F
olkloristic Origin of Lullabies.
 
Chapter 4: The Structural Origin of Lullabies.
 
As far as  the method of analysis i
s concerned, the pro'dems a
re
 
to be dealt with i
n quite different ways in each chapter.
 
I
n order to solve the first problem, why do we need lullabies
 
a questionnaire (
 S
 APPENDIX I )
 was handed out t
o the Japanese, t
he
 
W'
-Ite American, and the Native American populations. In addition, the pro-
'
rlern is also analyzed by the investigation on the lullabies collected
 
from these ethnic groups.
 
I
n the following chapter, the second problem is discuss e
d by
 
the theory,
 F
our Function of Folklore

. P.  Bascom so as t
o know
 
the e
xact process the the invention of lullabies.
 
After all, this study is concluded by asking the question, how
 
far -
 lullabies international ? I
n chapter 4
, I op attempt t
o
 
illustrate the J& moment when lullabies lose t
heir international e
lement
 
on the ultimate stage of the origin of lullabies. According to Dr. Bess
 
Lomax Hawes,  '
 as far as a song is one of the communicative acts, i
t f
its
 
to som  degree the overall communicative style of the society.
 
Applying this statement to lullabies, one of the communicative acts, we
 
are able to hypothesize that they fit to some degree the overall commu-
nicative style of the society,especially in this case, the communicative
 
style of talking by
 u wow caregivers (
 mother, father, grand-
parent, babysitter, etc.  )
 to their babies. To prove this hypothesis, I
 
ohservrd the verbal care provided by caregivers to their -
 babies
 
among these three different groups people and viewed the relationship
 
between the verbal care and the lullabies.
