VC: This is Thursday the 21st of March, at Phyllis and Kevin Acres’ home dining table, and thanks again 
for letting us do this. One of the things we wanted to talk to you about is how you break up the tasks 
and what the tasks are season by season. Let’s start with the spring? 
KA: In the spring, the first thing we do is wait for the soil conditions to be right, and dry, and we start 
spreading the nine months’ supply of manure. We wait until the soil is dry so we can incorporate it in so 
the soil can utilize it. Last year, which was unusual, we started at March 23rd. Typically, it’s more like the 
middle of April. We try to put the corn in the ground sometime around the first week of May. Here in 
the North Country you get two weeks in the early spring that you can accomplish your work and you 
may have to wait a month with all the rain and everything else. The first two weeks of May and the end 
of April are really critical to get that corn in. For us the corn crop is crucial, it’s probably two thirds of the 
forage needs of our cows and it’s the energy source for the cattle, so it’s very important. Not only that, 
but an acre of land here in the North Country will yield two thirds as much dry matter on a forage basis 
as hay. It’s where you get your quantities. 
VC: Remind me the number of acres you plant of corn. 
KA: We’ll plant 300 acres of corn and about 300 acres of hay. Typically we’ll rotate about 100 acres a 
year. This year we’ll be seeding down a hundred acres, but a hundred acres of grassland from last year 
will be put into corn. Last year about the 20th of May, before Memorial Day, we actually took our first 
crop of hay off. 
VC: That’s early, right? 
KA: It’s early, but we were switching away from alfalfas to a more natural grass. So we were planting 
100% fescues and actually this year, we’ve done this for 4 years, and actually this year we are adding a 
little bit of alfalfa. Alfalfa will give a little additional protein that the grasses may lack. Grasses are 
actually more winter hardy and more natural to this area and alfalfa is not. Actually the cows like the 
grasses better and it is better for them from a health standpoint, also. 
(0:02:57) 
VC: When you say grasses, do you mean things like timothy? 
2 
 
KA: Timothy in the past has been promoted for 50 years. We are moving towards the fescues, because 
the fescues are higher yielding and they are better quality, their winter hardiness is longer lasting and 
actually they are a very good use of manure, the same with reeds canary. The problem with reeds 
canary is reeds canary heads out very quickly, and once it heads out you lose your quality as far as you 
energy and protein in the grass. Fescue gives you a little bit more harvest opportunity, no much, but just 
a little bit, so it’s actually more complimentary. When we get that corn crop in we are immediately 
transistioning into cutting out hay. Actually, if the weather hasn’t permitted it, we’ll actually stop our 
corn planting and start the hay crop. We hate to do that because we have to switch things all around, 
but that is typically what we do. Your first cut of hay leeches two thirds of your hay crop generally, little 
bit different with grasses, but still the largest quantity, so you can really make or break you as far as the 
quality. If you miss that quality on the first cut, then you are kind of behind the ball all the way through 
the rest of the harvest. Because it is your largest quantity wise, tonnage wise, you want to get it right. 
Cows milk better off of first cut than second cut and third and fourth. 
(0:04:28) 
VC: Old timers used to talk about grassy cheese, they thought they could detect the difference in the 
taste of the cheese, what do you think about that? 
KA: I don’t know about the cheese, but I do know that when we used to pasture our cows, that first 
week that our cows went on pasture, you could taste the grass in the milk it was an excessive change in 
cows milking on stored feed verses fresh grass. Actually, we found it kind of repulsive until you get used 
to it. Our dairy has been confined; we haven’t been doing any pasture ever since I started farming, since 
the early 80s. 
(0:05:26) 
VC: So moving into hay season? 
KA: So we move into hay season and we’ll usually take at least 3 cuts. We always take 3 cuts and then 
the 4th cut depending on what the weather is like and how much yield is there. With the fescue what 
we’ve been doing is actually taking it after the corn harvest, in late September. Typically it’s a 30-day 
harvest window, 28 to 30 days and that 4th cut could be as much as 45 days or whatever. May 20th was 
our first cut, so 30 days later, June, July and August so your last one, we stretch it out. Typically you have 
drier conditions at that time and you don’t have the growth. The nice thing with the fescue is, in the fall, 
it actually puts on really pretty good growth. It reacts well to the cool conditions and you have a little bit 
of dew and it still continues to grow and you don’t really lose any quality at that time because it doesn’t 
have the heat, so it’s not growing rapidly and then heading out. The harvest of the corn, we usually time 
it with the second Saturday of September is the Chicken Barbeque. We usually participate in that, so we 
usually start the next day. It usually takes us anywhere from 5 to 10 days to harvest the 300 acres. 
(0:06:59) 
VC: Do you do all the harvest and haying with just your usual work crew or do you have to hire others? 
3 
 
KA: The two guys that work out in the barns and stuff, they’re there, myself, we do hire a person part 
time to run the self-propelled harvester and actually that same individual. Phyllis actually doesn’t do the 
harvester, she does the raking, she merges all the hay. 
PA: And I help pick stones in the spring. 
KA: She drives the equipment for picking stones. It’s a team effort, it’s a family effort. During the harvest 
we’ll hire maybe 1 or 2 individuals to drive a tractor. Bob Day used to work for my father and he’s kind 
of semi-retired, but he does a good job as far as taking care of the equipment, so we put him in the 
harvester. He drives the chopper and we bring it to the bunks and pack it and cover it and all that stuff. 
Typically after the corn is harvested and the fourth cut is harvested we’ll go back to spreading manure 
again. But also if we have quantities of manure in the summer time we’ll top dress the hay fields after 
we remove the hay. 
VC: What does that mean? 
KA: Top dress mean put maybe 3000 gallons, depending on the soil sample and the crop plan that we 
have, we’ll put after the 1st cut or the 2nd cut, we’ll put manure on some of the fields. We don’t have 
enough manure to cover them all, so we do have to buy some liquid nitrogen and apply that. With the 
liquid nitrogen, particularly with grass, you can really boost your yields, but you can also boost your 
quantities because the grass uptakes your nitrogen and converts it to protein. Particularly in early 
spring, sometimes as soon as the grass starts greening up and the grass starts growing we’ll apply the 
nitrogen. I have a contractor that does all my spraying of herbicides for the corn that applies nitrogen 
also. 
(0:09:13) 
VC: So picking stones is in the spring? 
PA: In the spring, after the manure is out they work the manure in. 
KA: After you put your manure down then you either chisel plow it down or work it with something else 
that doesn’t always bring up stones to the surface. So we pick those with skid steers that have a 5 foot, 
it looks like a bucket but has tines on it, which are very strong, and you can pick the stone up as you are 
driving along. Phyllis will drive the tractor and what we call the stone buggy and we’ll have skid steer on 
each side of the buggy and we can pick in a swath of about 75 feet. You get to the end of field, turn 
around and come back. It used to be character building when we were young; you picked by hand and 
threw it into an old Am with a bucket on the front. 
(0:10:22) 
VC: They also used to think the stones grew, right? 
KA: Well the stones have babies, they still have babies and you have to harvest then when they get big 
enough, there is no doubt about it. We have a very stony farm that we have effectively been lowering 
4 
 
the elevation over the years, and it’s getting much better because of the equipment. Actually chisel 
plowing digs deep and brings them up. The first year that we had the chisel plow it brought up a lot of 
stones. It’s great because it digs deep and really works your soil and provides drainage and a place for 
your nutrients and seeds to grow. 
(0:11:12) 
VC: Since you don’t pasture your animals you never have to worry about fences, right? 
KA: Once in a while somebody leaves a gate open and it’s kind of a rodeo and the best thing is to let 
them settle down and herd them back. Eventually they’ll actually return but you have to watch that they 
don’t get into the manure pits and stuff. 
VC: But you don’t literally have fences to repair every spring and that kind of thing? 
KA: No. 
PA: You have to keep the trees out of the fields. 
KA: We’ll do hedgerow—typically what we do is as we’re seeding down a field we’ll cut wood as the 
trees grow into, where if you were in a pasture situation you had a fence in the middle and your cows 
went into those hedgerows and ate whatever was there, plus they went there for shade in the 
summertime, so they didn’t grow. So now it’s not uncommon to see a hedgerow go from 4 feet to 40 
feet wide.  
(0:12:15) 
VC: So after September when you said the last of the corn is in, then the rest of the year? 
KA: We’ll apply the final manure, and then we’ll work that in the ground. But there’s everyday tasks; the 
cows really need to have their feet trimmed twice a year in a confinement system, sometimes 3. So 
there is that process. I do quite a bit of it. Every time we dry a cow off, give her rest before her next 
lactation, we trim her feet and they’re actually vaccinated at that same time. What we vaccinate for are 
respiratory diseases, and we actually give them a shot of a E Coli vaccine, which actually protects the 
udder from E coli mastitis, an infection of the udder, the mammary system. I also give it a shot of this 
product called Scour Guard and that actually goes to the unborn calf. So when the calf is born it has 
some immunity to Scours or E coli disease which is fairly common around the farm. 
VC: Is this fairly new? 
KA: No, it’s been around. Scour Guard, that product and several others do the same thing, they’ve been 
around for probably 10 or 15 years. 
(0:13:34) 
VC: Do you do most of this yourself or do you have a veterinarian that comes? 
5 
 
KA: We have a veterinarian that comes every 6 weeks and what our vet does is our sterility and fertility 
checks. We’ll check and see if cows are pregnant. Some cows may have cystic ovaries, which means 
they’re not going to cycle and you’ll have to treat them with a shot, GNRH to get the cyst to go away. It 
seemed to be years ago in the mid-80s there was more of it. They don’t really have much of that now 
and I don’t know why that’s not happening, but that’s a good thing. If I have a difficult calving I’ll call 
them for that, but I’m pretty much a low maintenance herd and that is how I try to keep things simple. I 
do much of the work myself. I treat any of the sick cows or whatever. Of course if you’re doing a good 
job, nutritionally it’s a little bit of science to feed the dry cows. Not to get too much potassium, that can 
cause metabolic disease. So if you are doing a good job on your dry cows, or what they call the transition 
cows as they get ready to quit milking for 3 weeks and then for  3 weeks they’re still not milking, it’s 
about a 6 t0 8 week period, as they start preparing for the new baby. There are a lot of changes in the 
cow that are taking place, so it’s really critical to have the minerals right and make sure they’re eating. 
After they give birth, or freshen, that 14 day period is the critical point. So if you can get then through 
that 14 days after they calve, then you pretty much are good to go. The problems that you may have, is 
you may have mastitis. You can eliminate a lot of mastitis by 3 times a day milking, and that for us has 
worked very well. They still get infections, they still get stepped on teats by themselves or by another 
animal, teat injuries and stuff like that, but other than that, the main problems are, you know lameness 
is a big issue, and then getting cows to breed back. They are milking very hard, giving 90 to 120 pounds a 
day in that 60 to 90 days of their lactation, and then to basically have to replenish their energy, it’s 
nature doing its job, until they are ready to become fertile again. 
(0:16:15) 
VC: These days, how many times will a cow be pregnant? 
KA: Ideally, you’d want them to have a calf the same time every year. That would be the ideal, a 12 
month lactation, which would be 305 days of actual milking and a 60 day rest period. Industry wide it’s 
probably closer to 13, 14 months. A large part of that is cows have been bred for the last 30 to 40 years 
through artificial insemination, bred for production. What we are seeing now, is they’re milking so hard 
that they actually go into a negative energy balance, and so they are milking so hard that reproductively 
they aren’t cycling. Until they basically retain that energy balance and start putting weight back on, 
that’s when they’ll start becoming fertile again. Most voluntary waiting periods are around 70 days of 
lactation. It’s not unusual for cows to be out there 120, 130, 150 days before they actually are bred 
back, depending on how hard they milk. Part of the design of this, part of the problem, is the industry 
has bred for a certain type of animal, kind of like this genetically superior from a production stand point. 
And I think they’ve neglected the traits for fertility and also for legs. So now it is reverting to that. So an 
AI stud or business that’s promoting these kinds of bulls based on certain cow families are promoting 
animals where they have data on the daughters. The daughters are lasting 6 months longer than the 
typical herd mate or feet scores and stuff like this. It is really very highly technical. You can design your 
program around that if you want maybe less milk but better fertility, if it’s more important to you to 
have cows that breed back every 12, 13 months, I will tell you this, when I first started out and was 
buying my animals off the farm, you would get all kind of records on the cows and everybody would 
spend the big money on the high production cow, and I would look at the mother of say this bred heifer 
6 
 
that I was buying and I would look and see what day she freshened on for all of her 4 or 5 lactations. If it 
was in the year ’07 she freshened in December and she freshened in December ’06 and ’05, I know she 
milked well, tested well as far as butterfat and protein, but she also was very fertile. So typically, 
hopefully, she would pass that on to her daughter. I always looked at that stuff which means I never had 
to pay really top dollar because I didn’t want that 30 or 35,000 pound milk because that could be done 
by artificial means or enhancements, but the breeding back is different. 
(0:19:44) 
VC: So a cow you would have, how long . . . 
PA: . . .  you’re wondering how long she would stay on the farm and how many babies she’d have. 
KA: I would say 3 lactations, which sounds severe, but the reality is the daughter is so genetically 
superior. You don’t have in a commercial dairy, you don’t have 10 and 15 year old cows. It’s typically, 
possibly in a tie stall where you’re bring them feed and everything else, but the reality is, genetically, the 
daughter is superior, and that daughter, her daughter, is going to be genetically superior to her. So the 
rate of growth is almost 3 to 500 pounds milk per year per lactation. Like I said before, they have been 
remiss in their breeding. So you may get a really high production cow, but she may never breed back. Or 
if she breeds back so late that she ends up putting on all kinds of conditions and becomes overweight 
and not profitable to you. 
(0:20:55) 
VC: So most of your cows aren’t any older than 6 or 7 years. 
KA: Yeah, probably. 
VC: Then they go to slaughter? 
KA: Yup, the golden arches, basically hamburger. One thing I didn’t know until a couple of years ago was 
that 60% of your meat that you get in a restaurant is actually dairy beef; so the cuts are really actually 
pretty good. But primarily a lot of these dairy cows are going for hamburger. Particularly here in the 
northeast, Taylor, which is owned by Cargill, has a contract with McDonalds. I have to watch; I was 
telling somebody my cows go to the good old Golden Arches and this person said, “Where are the 
Golden Arches?” It’s McDonalds sorry. They are thinking, “Where’s this palace?” 
(0:21:43) 
VC: So what’s your winter activity? 
KA: Well the winter activity, as our mutual friend Scott Goldie asked me he said, “Kevin, you have all 
your harvesting done.” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “What do you do in the winter time.” I said, “Well, we’re 
on half days, we only work 12 hours a day.” And it’s virtually true. Sorry, but it is. I get up at 4:30 and 
typically it’s 5:30, 6:00 before I come in the house. Maintaining a herd of 800 animals requires a lot of 
upkeep. The feeding process is, I can feed the 800 head in about 2 ½ hours. We don’t have the capacity 
7 
 
in one barn, so they require another feeding in the afternoon. As they’re milking the cows, as they leave 
on part of the barn, we’re cleaning the barns, trimming feet, a lot of management as far as reading. I 
spend a considerable amount of time just reading different information, looking up stuff on the internet, 
talking with equipment suppliers, getting prices. There is quite a bit of calling on a weekly basis as to 
who’s the best price in town for soybean or canola or cornmeal. We keep pretty busy. 
VC: I’m not questioning that you do. 
KA: No, but I will tell you this, it’s a lot easier now than when I was younger, for sure. 
(0:23:16) 
VC: So you have plenty of work for your men? 
KA: Yeah. Everybody’s getting right around 60 hours a week. We’re actually short one individual right 
now, but they like the 60 hours a week on the money part of it. Most of our work, the concentration of 
our work is done between 4:30 or 3:30 in the morning ‘til about 1:00 in the afternoon. So the afternoon 
is usually free for doing repairs and like I said there is plenty of that; gates to fix and stalls to fix. You try 
to keep your operation simple. I used to practically live in the barn; I don’t do that anymore. When we 
were young . . . 
VC: Younger. 
KA: Younger. In our 20s and 30s, and I realize now I spent a lot of time in the barn because it was only 
myself and a 100-some cows. 
(0:24:22) 
VC: What are you major facilities? 
KA: We have one main milking barn, which was the original barn, which was built in ‘81, and that was 
128 stalls with a double six milking parlor, so there’s 6 machines on one side and 6 on the other. That 
barn itself, we had a fire in ‘92, built it back as it was, but we’ve added additional stalls, so now it’s 180 
stalls in one direction and it’s a double 8 parlor. And then we’ve made another extension on that for 
what they call the holding area, where the cows all kind of, you gather them up as a group so you 
prepare them for the milking as they come into the milking center. 
VC: It used to be a barn yard? 
PA: The old function of a barn yard. 
KA: And then we built an extension onto that. What I call is a special needs barn, which is where all the 
fresh cows go. They have their own little space, they have their own little water, they have sand free 
stalls, it’s like they are on the beach, and it’s bigger stalls. They need that to recover from giving birth to 
a 100 pound calf, and 10 or 15 gallons of fluid, so all of a sudden from day 1, in 14 days they will be 
giving 75 to 85 pounds of milk. So it’s quite a transition from zero; give this birth and there you go. It’s 
8 
 
set up with the additional fans for cooling, the comfort of the stalls, and plus they have their own area 
so they aren’t waiting in that holding area for say an hour, or an hour and half. They come in; there is 35 
in there today. In no time at all, in a half an hour or less they’ll be milked and right back on feed. You 
don’t want your fresh cows to be standing around waiting to be milked or waiting to eat. That has really 
made a difference; we have a separate facility for what we call our yearlings; that goes from anywhere 
from 2 months up to 1 year in age. They are broken up to 7 different groups based on age and sizing and 
stuff. 
(0:27:12) 
VC: That’s because of different feeding? 
KA: Different feeds and not only that, but after calves are born they go into hutches and they’re there 
for 8 weeks and then they are put in groups of 10. Ten seems to be the right number size-wise. You 
don’t want too big; it could be less. We put them in even groups because they say they pick out a buddy, 
they have a best friend, so you don’t want an odd number in there because that’s the odd guy out. It’s 
kind of like having 3 kids. You minimize the stress and as they grow up in groups of 10 until the 4th 
change and then they go into a group of 25 or 26, there is actually 29 stalls in there. Then they get into a 
group of 35 and then into another group of 35. They just transition and keep shifting and move up the 
barn. What really makes them move is the next ones coming in. And then there’s another barn has the 
breeding age group and then the bred heifers and then the dry cows and then a bed of pack for the dry 
cows to give birth on. Then they go into this facility over here, this special needs barn. So there’s four 
different barns. 
(0:28:28) 
VC: What about crop storage? 
KA: The crop storage, we have concrete bunkers; they call them trench silos versus the uprights. The 
uprights do a great job of fermenting your feed, but the equipment to put the feed into them, the 
wagons and stuff is fairly slow compared to putting in with trucks. And not only that, the silo unloaders 
were expensive to operate and slow. For the tonnages that you need to feed, like on a large large farm, 
say like the Fisher Farm, they are feeding 100 tons a day; well a silo only holds 700 tons. In a week they 
would empty out and their facility would empty a 20 by 70. Your unloader would not be able to handle 
that kind of stress, not on a daily basis, not a ton a day. Your motors would be burning up. When we 
made the transition we went from 35 electric motors down to 5. 
(0:29:37) 
VC: The hay is stored the same way? 
KA: The same way. I don’t have any dry hay storage, so any dry hay that we need, we do purchase that, 
but the haylage itself is stored in a bunker; you put it in layers of 5 to 6 inches, pack it with heavy 
tractors with a dozer blade on front to get the air out of it and compress it down. 
9 
 
VC: What about the big bales? 
KA: We buy big round bales because that’s a way I can buy dry hay. I don’t have any round balers or 
anything like that. Typically they should really be stored inside because if you get spoilage in the first 4 
inches, that is really half your bale. It doesn’t look like it, but it’s half your bale. 
(0:30:22) 
VC: What about the wrapping? 
KA: Well the wrapping—all the round bale technology has really been a result of 2 things: the 
technology, and the lack of high school kids willing to put up dry hay anymore. The third thing would be 
width of round bale system, doing wet haylage, you don’t have to wait for that dry, dry weather. 
Typically farmers used to wait to make their first cut years ago in July, or just before the Gouverneur Fair 
in August; you get the haying done and then you can celebrate at the fair. They only cut once. The 
weather was usually great, so you had a week or 10 days of dry weather you could do all your haying. Of 
course you probably only did 100 acres at that time. It gives the speed of it for the guy with 50 to 100 
cows, the cows like that, stored like that, it’s very high quality feed, it keeps the air out and everything, 
but the carbon footprint of all that plastic is significant.  
VC: They even used to worry about getting rid of the twine. 
KA: Yeah, because it’s plastic. There are places that take it. Cooperative Extension has a machine, a bale 
press, but they are taking it and then they’re trucking it all the way out to California and making it into 
little paving bricks and shipping it back to us; I would think that would be a larger carbon footprint. 
(0:32:02) 
VC: Do you have a separate facility for machine storage? 
KA: Not at this time. I do have a heated shop that we put up in 2009 with radiant heat, and that’s great 
for equipment you have to start everyday and to work on stuff. It has good lighting and is set for 60 
degrees and we heat it with an outside wood boiler. It was very expensive, but well worth the money at 
my age, for comfort. Before we used to plug our stuff in at 20 below zero and hope that it would start. 
(0:32:38) 
VC: You said your barn was built in 1981? 
KA: 1981.  
VC: So it must’ve replaced an older--? 
PA: It replaced an older barn 
KA: The original barn, it was a hip roof barn that was the original one when my parents came over in 
1981 from Canada. It was a stanchion barn that my father had renovated into a free stall because he 
10 
 
was the first one to put in a milking parlor in St. Lawrence County in I think it was 1962. And it was 
stanchions, that was one of our first jobs, when we were 5 and 6, was when the cows came out of the 
milking parlor we would lock them back up in their stanchions. Eventually we converted that to a free 
stall. Which free stalls were very new in the late 60s and early 70s. 
VC: That barn must have had a hay loft? 
KA: Yup, it had a hay loft and stuff.  
VC: Silos as well? 
KA: Yup. When I had the fire actually in 1992, I had 4 silos. 
VC: Glass lined or the old fashion ones? 
KA: We didn’t have the Harvesters; we had the concrete ones, much less expensive. My father actually 
sold the silo loaders, the Pats, which was a high quality name back in the 70s for gutter cleaners, silo 
loaders or conveyor systems, any feeding systems. 
(0:34:09) 
VC: At some point in the earlier interview, you said the farm continued to grow, that you had to grow. 
Did you feel forced to make that change? 
KA: Well, the milk business, I don’t remember what the context was when I said that, but the milk 
business is a volume business. The margins are slim, your equipment is so expensive now, and to give 
you an idea, the forage harvester, the first one I bought was $210,000, the next one when I traded those 
10 years later was $300,000. It’s probably now about $380,000 for the same machine. So if you have 100 
cows that is $3,800 debt per cow, where if you have 380 cows, you have $1000. And the same tool for a 
1000 cows would be $380 worth of debt, even though you’d wear it out quicker. But the technology is a 
major driver and it always has been. You go back when they basically said everybody has to put in bulk 
tanks back in the 50s. So much class B milk, which was going for cheese, some people made the 
transition, some people: okay, I’m done. You’re not going to take my 5 cans a day, you’re not going to 
take my 12 cans a day, I’m going to go to town and work for Alcoa. 
(0:34:42) 
VC: A lot of people quit farming at that point? 
KA: In the 50s I think was the transition to bulk tanks and stuff. They would still take them because I 
remember when we would run the tank over here, we still had cans there that would sit there in the 
cooler. 
PA: We had cans when I was little. 
VC: You lived in Heuvelton, Phyllis? 
11 
 
PA: Yes. 
VC: Your milk would have gone to--? 
PA: We took it to Heuvelton, a plant right in Heuvelton. 
VC: To McCadam? 
PA: No, I don’t know what the name of it was, it sits right as you go into town, you take the first street to 
the right there. 
KA: That was McCadams? 
PA: I don’t know what it is called. 
VC: There’ve been more than one plant there. 
KA: So I think the technology is a huge driver. You had these greater efficiencies so you produce more 
milk and it drives your price down. So as you drive your price down, you lose a layer of farmers. And so 
then that cycle keeps repeating itself, people, young people or whatever make that decision to get out 
of business or are forced out of business because it’s not profitable for them anymore. So in hindsight 
now, in my 30s, I wish we had gone ahead and went to 500 cows back then and made that transition, 
but things work out the way they do for a reason. For us, at 350 cows going through the milking parlor 
today; we’re very efficient with basically myself and 4 men full time. We have our part timers and Phyllis 
does all the accounting and all the book work and keeping up with the taxation, and that’s another 
thing, the regulations and federal tax code, to keep on top of that is pretty much a full time. 
PA: I don’t know, it would be true with any business, it’s the employee stuff. 
(0:37:56) 
VC: Ag and Markets, do they come around? 
KA: Ag and Markets? You have your regular milk inspector for your co-op itself. They do annual checks, 
they are actually semi-annual checks and then there’s always a state inspector or federal inspector and 
your farm maybe picked. When the tank is weighted by the county or recalibrated and if your floor has 
shifted, I think that is every 10 years. 
(0:38:27) 
VC: Does the county still have a man, used to be called the Sealer of Weights and Measures? 
KA: Yeas, there’s 2 individuals and they do the stores for price checking, unit pricing, they calibrate the 
gas stations, they got a load, quite a bit of a job for them. 
VC: They would come to farms as well? 
12 
 
KA: They would come if there was a problem I think. Like ours was a new tank and I want to say, I can’t 
remember exactly, maybe the late 90s, so they’ve been here once to recalibrate it, nothing had 
changed; a few pounds here and there, but nothing significant. 
(0:39:12) 
VC: A different kind of question, for each of you, what is your favorite kind of job on the farm? 
KA: What if she doesn’t have one? [laughter] 
VC: There is room for that question also, but I was going to start with that. 
KA: I am interested just to hear this one myself. Should I leave? 
PA: I’m not sure I have a favorite part of the job.  
VC: Farm related or house relate? Quilting I would say for you. 
PA: I don’t know, the only thing I guess I was happy with as far as my farm life would be raising my 
family, but as far as the farm itself, I don’t love it you know, I don’t love it. [laughter] 
VC: Among those things, do you have a least favorite job? 
PA: I always say the least favorite job on the farm is throwing the bunker tires, when we put the tires on 
the tarp. I don’t know how much they weigh, 25 pounds apiece. 
VC: Hundreds of them. 
PA: 6 or 8 hours straight doing that. 
KA: She’s great help with that because she usually puts the other guys to shame and she has 2 artificial 
knees, and when you see your employees standing around and your wife with her artificial knees and 
their faces are red and ready to pass out and she’s putting them to shame, you can use that against 
them. 
VC: I would think Hispanic guys particularly would be upset with that. 
KA: She is not going to out throw them. 
PA: I think what Kevin’s father always told them was that farming was a good life, and it has been a good 
life, but there’s a lot easier ways to make a living. I think that is very true. We’ve had a good life, but 
there were a lot easier ways we could have made a living. 
KA: Phyllis is a certified math teacher, she’s tenured. I went to school for Phys Ed, so I could have been 
teaching Phys Ed. If you could imagine 2 teachers with all these breaks, it would be foreign to us with 
the summers off. 
KA: So that’s your least favorite. 
13 
 
PA: I don’t really have a favorite. 
(0:41:31) 
KA: My favorite job, I guess the thing that keeps me going about this, I’m a stubborn person, but really 
what I like is building; I like to see the growth. Even though I’ve been doing this all my life and been in 
charge basically since 1983, I still try and figure out how to save a step everyday; that’s no exaggeration. 
It’s not to be lazy, it’s just to be more efficient, so that’s what kind of drives me, and making systems 
work and trying to keep it simple to get the most out of it. With, not like a lazy effort, but with the most 
efficient effort. There’s been good years and bad years. We would not have the equity that we have 
today by being teachers. I don’t think our children would be who they are today without their farm 
experiences. 
(0:42:31) 
VC: Explain that. 
PA: It did allow me to stay home with the children. 
KA: I think what they have had to do is, they have had to work hard. 
PA: They certainly had their chores to do. 
KA: I think everything else is easier from there. I am kind of getting emotional about it. They’d be 
different kids. I think they would be more attached to the social media and not really have a good basis 
in life. Certainly you can do it, we know plenty of people, but I think they are in a select minority, having 
grown up on a farm. 
VC: Besides developing a general work ethic, do you think they picked up any particular skills growing up 
on a farm? 
KA: I think, myself personally, I think they probably have seen the struggles, the difficulty; getting them 
out of bed at night at 10:30 or 11:00 at night to pull a calf or stuff like that. 
PA: I think that makes them more adaptable, that’s what I always thought about myself growing up on a 
farm. I can adapt to living in a city and taking the subway and all that, but what you don’t know is that I 
hunted muskrats when I was a kid and I know how to do fish and make a garden. Those are skills you 
kind of learn but you can still do all that city stuff easily. 
KA: You’re like a chameleon, and besides that, my father’s business, growing up with that, dealing with 
people stopping in during supper time, the phone ringing, going out and waiting on people for parts and 
stuff and they’re upset because they need parts and their cows aren’t fed and they had a rough day. So 
you develop unique social skills, too, I think, and I am handier than most farmers because of those 
experiences. Not just the social part, but the stuff I had to repair. It’s an interesting skill set. 
(0:44:56) 
14 
 
VC: Did we talk about 4-H before? 
PA: That’s how Kevin and I met. 
VC: Were your kids involved in 4-H, too? 
PA: They did for a short time, when they were younger. There was a club, the club dissolved, and they 
went independent for years when they were younger. 
KA: More things going on, more sports, more after school activities, where before, 4-H when we were 
growing up, was the thing for farm kids. Not so much the FFA, there were kids active in the FFA, but I 
don’t really remember the 4-H kids being active in FFA. Maybe it was just different for our family. 
(0:45:38) 
VC: Kevin, you were on the school board for quite a long time? 
KA: 22 years. 
VC: Obviously you’ve now gone into legislature. 
KA: Did the BOCES for 6 years also. 
VC: Do you think there was any connection between you wanting to do that and you being a farmer? Do 
you think it was to your benefit to do those things or simply to do service? 
KA: Well, I’ve never been accused for not having an opinion. I don’t know, my mother was a 4-H leader 
and there was like 80 kids and ran a good program. All the kids had to do demonstrations, which is a 
tough thing to do, get kids from age 9 to 16 to get up front and speak. In our club, the Chipman Club, 
which was a dynasty, and she really put that on. So my mother’s influence on that and she is very 
political, she is very liberal. 
VC: Just like her son. 
KA: I don’t know which one. 
PA: Not this one. 
KA: I think my father, he was a very well known man because he dealt with all farmers; he sold fertilizer, 
he sold seed, he sold milk, he sold equipment, he sold gutter cleaners and silo loaders, basically anything 
you needed other than a tractor or he didn’t sell choppers. I think because of that, it made it a little 
easier because both of my parents were quite well known. Not because they tried to be well known or 
stand out or anything like that, just because who they were; they worked really hard all the time. 
PA: I was going to say I think it’s more personality why Kevin’s involved, it’s a personal trait; it wouldn’t 
be something I would do. 
VC: Would not be? 
15 
 
PA: No. That’s why we’re a good pair. 
(0:47:50) 
VC: It does strike me, the John Greenwoods get involved in politics, and it may have to do with the 
agricultural interest. 
KA: It is that. I mean, I am actually a director on the Farm Bureau; back in 1985 I was actually Vice 
President and was on the School Board at the same time. Having those two tasks and running a farm 
virtually by myself, I didn’t have any help at that time, not that I recall; it was a challenge. 
PA: Just a good woman behind him. 
KA: A good woman behind him. I always have had a quest for knowledge. I like learning and learning 
about new things and it continues today. 
(0:48:51) 
VC: You said before that it takes a special person to work with cows. 
KA: Yeah it does, you know, cows are a big; you can’t pick them up and move them, you can’t 
communicate with them and say, “I would like you to turn left right here at the end of this thing and 
please cooperate, don’t kick the machine off, what I am doing is good for you.” There’s a special thing 
about them, you have to know how they operate, they’re really truly wonderful animals; they’re totally 
exasperating, also, but for the conditions that they--what they do. Drop that 100 pound calf like I spoke 
about earlier and all these fluids and in 2 weeks time be providing you with 80 pounds of milk, and then 
do it again next year. They’re really resilient, they can really handle the hot weather, they don’t like the 
hot weather, but they survive the hot weather. They can handle the cold weather; they do lose 
production and stuff. They’re really are kind of amazing animals. The old Hoard’s Dairyman used to be 
mother of the earth type thing. So it takes a special personality, the people that are quiet around cows 
and know how they function, those are the best ones. It doesn’t always match my personality that’s for 
sure. 
(0:50:31) 
VC: Do cows have personalities? 
KA: Oh, yeah, certain individuals. We used to have one as a kid we’d call Killer Kowalski. We as teenage 
boys could not milk her. If we had a hard time milking her she would just thrash that machine, but my 
father could handle her fine. I don’t know whether he had threatened to kill her or what, within an inch 
of her life or what. So she was around for 3 or 4 years. Jerseys have a particular personality that doesn’t 
match up with mine because they don’t do what Holsteins do. Holsteins figure it out; Jerseys figure it 
out and then they unhook the gate on you. [Laughter] They try to show you that they are smarter than 
you. The nature of the dairy business is, you can’t be a person that gives up easy, because this’ll beat 
you in a hurry; this is really a tough job, there’s no doubt about it. To make a living at it, I think it was 
16 
 
much easier, every generation has their struggles, but it’s different now. It’s different now because 
we’re talking about a world market, and then we’re talking about other sources that are competing for 
our corn and soy for ethanol and stuff like that, so the margins are much slimmer. The requirements 
from government are much more, there’re much more regulations, property taxes and all that, and the 
world’s much faster, much, much faster. And the technology’s evolving so fast that I’m not attempting 
to keep up with it as far as my operation, you know, we’re not going to go to a driverless tractor. You 
have guidance systems now in tractor where it’s hands-off steering. All you do is you turn at the end of 
the row and stuff. That’s here; that’s here in St. Lawrence County. It’s straight rows, no wavering, just 
efficiency so you don’t have any overlap on your tillage systems. It used to be you’d drive and you’d 
head for the oak tree down at the end of the thing, and turn around at the end, and you may be 
overlapping by 2 feet. Well if you only have an 18 foot disc you are losing a lot of productivity, whereas 
the new technology will have you within an inch without you steering. Matter of fact, they don’t want 
you to steer the machine, it’s all satellite. It has an expense component to it. It has a monthly fee, and 
the whole startup to it. The benefit of that is going to be tremendous for productivity and efficiency, 
much lower carbon footprint. I don’t know if I said the last time, in ‘62, there was 24 million cows, now 
there’s 9 million. The 9 million today are producing 3 times what the 24 million did. 
VC: I don’t remember those exact numbers, but that is an amazing statistic. 
KA: So you have, in the last 20 years, gone from 166,000 farms down to 55,000 farms. In 1950 you have 
3.6 million farms in the United States. 
(0:53:48) 
VC: So that’s breeding in that part? 
KA: No, it’s not. Those numbers are talking about all farms, not just dairy, but it’s primarily dairy and 
crops, but it’s all across ag. Less manure, less water usage; you take 75% of the land east of the 
Mississippi, it has returned to forest and woods, here in St Lawrence County, 85%. You drive around, all 
the vacant fields all growing back in. 
VC: It’s another reason why we see deer everywhere. Growing up I never saw deer. 
KA: We have an abundance of wildlife here now. It’s a virtual haven because they have all these places 
plus they have ready food supplies. I am feeding 800 head, but I am probably feeding 800 deer, also. 
That’s an exaggeration, but there’s plenty. 
(0:54:54) 
VC: Has your relationship with your animals changed over the years? 
KA: Well, my actual relationship is probably not what the consumer would like to hear; nobody has a 
first name, they are actually units of production. When I was smaller I had favorites, no doubt about it. 
When I was basically living in the barn and had 100 cows, I had favorite cows, but they were very 
productive cows, they were my favorite. For me, and that doesn’t go for all dairy farmers, but for me, 
17 
 
they are not necessarily impersonal, but they are units of production. I think that’s kind of the main 
attack against commercial farmers, but I don’t think so because I think that the care that is provided 
would be just the same, but I don’t have the time to have a personal relation like a man with his horse 
pulling a plow type thing; that’s the economics of it. But ass far as the care of the animal: they eat 
before I eat, they sleep before I sleep, they drink before I sleep, so that doesn’t change. I probably 
actually as good or better care now then when I had 100 cows. 
(0:56:30) 
VC: When I was at the Gilbert’s farm, each cow was getting their own personal feed mixture, I mean it’s 
impersonal, but each one is getting special treatment, which is a change from before. 
KA: Yup. Before, how you had that was that cows were in a stanchion barn and the farmers went down, 
this one got a little scoop and this one got 2 scoops, based on their production. And if you had a favorite, 
she may have been dry, but you’d give her a little scoop anyway, or half a scoop and she may have 
gotten fat and died on him of milk fever. 
(0:57:20) 
VC: The most challenging aspect of farming? 
KA: It’s an everyday thing. I find the labor very challenging; it’s hard to find…I was much happier by 
myself even though I had all the work, and I think that’s just my personality. The labor is very difficult, 
my Hispanics are excellent, but still one of them has issues; people are people. The economics. The 
economics is a tough thing. And we do really well, but in order to do really well in the future, or for the 
next generation, we have to continue to grow. You have to get to a size—like I’m actually at a terrible 
size, because I don’t have any middle management between myself and my crew. 
VC: Like a herdsperson? 
KA: Like a herdsperson. And that’s what, if we’re going to stay in this business, for my sanity, that’s what 
we need to do and to progress… older facilities, too. That’s the continued growth, and I know, and if you 
don’t continue to grow, lead or follow, you need to get out. 
[Phone rings; discussion, KA on phone] 
KA: Poor Lewis, he has such a great smile, too. 
VC: Oh, really. 
PA: You know Jim’s not here. 
KA: Yeah, he’s got a doctor’s appointment. 
VC: Is he going to lose, oh, he’s lost his teeth. 
18 
 
KA: Oh, they are gone, they’re pulled out, so in 2 weeks we’ll go back and put a plate in for him. I felt so 
bad. [Lewis had been kicked by a cow and lost his teeth.] We were talking about the economics. 
(0:59:47) 
VC: The challenging aspects of farming, and for you Phyllis? 
PA: I would probably say it’s the economics, the swing in the prices, they go up and down and it’s real 
hard. Some years are tighter than other years. 
KA: We’re at that stage where we’re at like 83% equity. I don’t feel the stress, but I think Phyllis does. If 
we were teachers and had to buy a washer and dryer she would be stressed. 
PA: I understand we have equity and that’s all good, but still I don’t like that. 
KA: It’s the economics, but the thing is. you know you are doing a pretty decent job and putting a lot of 
effort into it and everything, but it is going to require more, so how much can you give? How much are 
you willing to sacrifice? I’m 55 and Phyllis is 54, how much longer are you going to do it? 
(1:00:46) 
VC: Do you have a long term plan or any plans to grow? 
KA: We’re actually going to be meeting with a big picture guy in April. Because I’m 55 and none of the 3 
boys are interested and we really don’t have an individual that’s working for us now that is capable of 
managing a farm that we would get our money back out of. We’re at a place where we’re actually 
contemplating a new construction project: a new dry cow facility. We would convert the present dry 
cow facility to milk 60 cows. So it would cost roughly $170 or $180,000 to put up this new barn. And so 
we actually had met with our credit officer, which we do on an annual basis. We usually do it in January, 
but he was late this year. We actually met last week and talked about what plans were and stuff like 
that. We asked him, “What would you do, would you just milk it out at my age?” He goes, “Yeah.” So I 
said maybe we need to meet with this guy who works for Farm Credit and go over our numbers, what 
the farm is worth, what our equity is, what would happen if we sold out, how much money would we 
have left over, which would be substantial that we could retire under certain event, or do we do this and 
just make more work for myself. Or do we build this and try to bring a young person in. We’re in a 
unique spot that there are good farms all around us, so we really don’t need to find somebody to take it 
over because it could be dispersed and fit into one of the neighboring operations, would be quite handy 
for them. So I don’t have that pressure, but back in the 80s and stuff when you had hard times, “Who is 
going to have the money to buy this type thing?” I don’t have that pressure anymore. The land is worth 
so much more than what it was, just nationwide, farmland is a good investment. So we’re supposed to 
be meeting sometime in April. We haven’t set the exact date yet, but I think that’s what we are going to 
go. Phyllis would like to get out; she really would like to get out. 
PA: It’s just a day to day thing; chasing calves because they got out . . . 
19 
 
(1:03:29) 
VC: Do you want to continue to live in the country or move into town? 
KA: We have a home on the river in Waddington, so we live there in the summer time. It’s a beautiful 
place and the river is just fantastic.  
VC: So it could be a retirement home. 
KA: Well the taxes are terrible, they are like $300 a week, and I think $300 a week’s a lot. So, you could 
retire there for a while, but I don’t think you want to do it for 40 years. 
VC: You could hook up with one of those smugglers down river and be fine. 
KA: I could, but that should be short term. I can do well in the country, but don’t think I could do well in 
prison. That’s where we would move, and it’s an 8/10ths of an acre lot, it’s a beautiful home, we have 
nice neighbors. 
VC: 8/10ths of an acre? 
KA: 8/10ths of an acre. 
VC: We just bought a 1/3 of an acre, ‘cause we lived out in the country on almost an acre, and we’re 
going to build in town. Can you imagine that at my age? We want to build a one storey house with 
everything on one floor. 
KA: Do you know where Clark Point is in Waddington? 
VC: Oh yes. 
KA: That’s where it is, right behind Rollout Trust, the beautiful beach area there. We built that in ‘99, 
which those were good dairy years, ’99 and 2000; 2001 was not so good. 
(1:05:14) 
VC: How do you see the role of the dairy farm in the broader community? 
KA: Well, people don’t realize here in our community, so much as it used to be, we’ll say in St. Lawrence 
County. People don’t realize the role that agriculture plays in the county, how much money it actually 
circulates, I mean they talk about Alcoa and the others, GM and Reynolds, but GM and Reynolds are 
gone. I think Alcoa’s got less than a thousand people, and you can easily find 1000 people in St. 
Lawrence County. I always like when the newspaper does the Progress Report and they’ll have 
businesses listed down to 4 employees, and there is not a farm listed. There’s a farm near Ogdensburg 
that has 90 employees; Fisher has 40. 
VC: What farm has 90? 
20 
 
KA: Cruickshank’s, Woodcrest on 28. There are some big operations and they are generating millions of 
dollars, they are generating millions monthly, these large farms, and that all gets rolled back into the 
community: the feed businesses, the truck drivers, the milk haulers, the mechanics that fix the truck. 
People don’t really realize the domino effect of that dollar, that agricultural dollar. 
PA: And the employee’s paycheck is going back to the community. 
KA: I don’t think it is appreciated. I have to keep reminding my legislature peers on a continual basis of 
what agriculture’s impact is. The other impact as far as the challenge we’re under right now, is scrutiny 
from the consumer. People, the media has presented or some organization like Humane Society or PETA 
makes these allegations, threats, they get a video of some place where an employee, not the owner, but 
an employee whacks somebody over the head in frustration or mistreats an animal because it’s fun and 
he wants to show somebody, and everybody gets a black eye. Spinach gets back in California; all of a 
sudden somebody dies from spinach. They blame the dairy farm up the road and it turns out to be wild 
hogs, feral hogs, but the damage is done type thing. So we have to do a job, like we’re not busy enough, 
we have to do a job of actually convincing consumers. [To Phyllis: Do you have that Maple View thing?] 
So farmers are starting to organize and be proactive and getting their message out there. We have a 
thing called Day on the Farm that the general public is invited. We put information out in the schools to 
get the children to come to a modern farm, so I’m talking about a thousand cows. [Showing a pamphlet 
put out by a nearby farm]: This is an example where the Fishers have put out because people really 
don’t know what’s going on at your place. And they think this and they think that and we need to show 
them that, hey, we’re just like you, we’re regular people, we have families, we care for one another. 
(1:08:59) 
VC: So this is about image building in a way? 
PA: We look big, but we’re still family farms and people don’t realize it. 
KA: I don’t know if that answers your question. 
VC: It does, really. It’s just a different kind of impact now, it used to be all these little farms, 20 or 30 
head and then eventually 60 or 70 head. 
KA: Kind of anonymous, like you knew these people and you knew their kids and stuff, and now kind of 
like in our society right now, if you’re successful, it’s like you didn’t earn it, you didn’t build it type thing. 
So people are very suspicious of large farms that are successful people. Especially, you know, John takes 
a lot of heat. 
(1:09:52) 
VC: Do you think agritourism has any kind of future? 
KA: I think so. We’re probably a little far away from a population base to exploit that, but there’s 
definitely examples of farms that do it quite well, that are close to say, Saratoga or outside of New York 
21 
 
City, the Hudson Valley. There’s plenty of apple orchards and stuff. It’s a tough thing for a dairy farm to 
do, just because of the nature of the business. There’s safety issues is a big thing, but it’s being done. 
There are actually quite a few people, especially young woman that involved in agriculture that are 
having careers in production agriculture that are on YouTube and stuff and through Facebook or Twitter 
or whatever do a daily report and are trying to get the message out there. If you look at the Superbowl, 
the commercials are always a big thing. One of the most popular commercials was the commercial 
about farmers. What was the speaker, Harvey, “That’s the way it is,” what was his name? 
VC: Not Paul Harvey. 
KA: Yes, Paul Harvey, it’s a Paul Harvey thing from the 70s or 80s. So on the 8th day God created a farmer 
type thing. Everybody talked about it. 
(1:11:25) 
VC: What is so interesting about today is where everything is so big and  you’re so removed from their 
food, there’s an interested in “Buy Local” and a fascination with things like artisans breads and cheeses. 
KA: I don’t have a problem with that, I think it’s great; the problem is that individuals, not all individuals, 
but some individuals who are trying to lead the movement are poisoning people with the idea that “this 
is clean, this is real food” and giving us a black eye. So I refer to sustainable farming as subsistence 
farming, 3rd world farming, or modern tea farming, or you could also call it “farming, food for the few.” 
‘Cause if they really want to promote what they have, which some individuals do, like with any 
organization, you’re going to starve people. Even Al Gore knows that local food is fine for the local 
population, but you are not going to feed the world, you are going to starve. If you talk to somebody in 
Africa that is fine, but if you want to talk about GMO foods and this, this and this, and you can have your 
discussion, but can we eat first? 
(1:12:55) 
VC: The thing about artisan foods is that they are very expensive. 
KA: I listen to the guy on NPR. 
VC: You go in there and it’s fabulous, you see things you have never seen before, but it’s expensive, 
expensive and the average family could not afford that anyway. 
KA: I’ll tell you the problem. You think about here, St. Lawrence County, you don’t have to go very far 
and you can smell manure, you are surrounded by farms, right? You go into your hair cutter and they ask 
you what you do for a living and you say, “Well I am a farmer.” “Well you don’t smell like it” and I say, “I 
shower” and they say, “Some don’t.” At Midtown Haircutters, the owner of the business, you know, “I 
wish I could buy; I can’t afford that organic milk because it’s $8 a gallon” and I go, “Why are you buying 
it?” “Well, that other stuff has drugs in it or some type of pus.” And I go, “No it doesn’t.” And so I go 
through the duration of my haircut, and you go and look on their shelf and there’s Consumer Reports. 
Well, Consumer Reports is owned by Consumer Union. Well, Consumer Union is one of the huge 
22 
 
advocates against commercial farming. So here you take these people who are cutting your hair for $8 a 
head, you’re paying $8,they aren’t getting $8 and they’re thinking that they’re poisoning their kids with 
this drug-laden pussy stuff because they are so convinced by the media that organic is the only way to 
go. That’s what I have a problem with; they’re drinking my milk right now. 
(1:14:53) 
VC: That’ good. Are there farms around here that you particularly admire? 
KA: Yeah. We know what we do here, we know our deficiencies, we are certainly—we do farm different 
than many people actually. Mine is the keep it simple approach and like I said earlier, I try to get the 
maximum out of the least effort. And it’s not the least effort in being lazy, I certainly work and I work 
very hard. My 800 head, I have 4 employees and myself. You are not going to find that anyplace else in 
St. Lawrence County anyway. Who I particularly admire is John Greenwood. John Greenwood started 
with zero. He came up here to Canton Tech, didn’t have job, didn’t have any money to stay anywhere. 
And went to a woman’s house, knocked on her door who advertised for students and asked if he could 
stay there. He said, “I don’t have any money, but I’m going to get a job.” She took him in, she trusted 
him. He started out as an employee on the farm where he is now, self made, self made all the way, 
started out with zero and has built a 2000 acre plus operation and he is one of the sharpest guys, one of 
the most intelligent people that I know, regardless of his politics, Varick, and he operates very 
efficiently, he is very efficient. There are plenty of good farmers left, the Gilberts are excellent farmers. 
The Stauffers are excellent farmers. There’s a million ways to farm; those are just some of the good 
examples. The McKnights farm quite well I believe. [Kevin has named the largest farms in St. Lawrence 
County—we conducted interviews for this project with both the Gilberts and the Stauffers.] I don’t have 
any idea about anybody’s financial sheet. John and I talk quite often because we’re both on the Farm 
Bureau, we’re both active in politics and I know what he has done. Not many people know his story. So, 
he actually came out of a socialist community, much like the Hutterites. And John being the independent 
soul that he is, at age 13 or 14, he wasn’t adapting to the socialization of his community, which they had 
a morning meal together; lunch was at their home and an evening meal. It was a community of 150 or 
200 people. So they sent him out to Wisconsin to the grandparents to straighten him out; figured that 
the hard work of a dairy farm would straighten him out. He loved it; it backfired. He has left his 
community. His parents are still living there, he has sisters there, he has a brother that’s left the 
community, but other than that he is in total isolation all on his own, not too many people know that. 
(1:18:20) 
VC: What are you general thoughts about the use of migrant workers and immigrants? 
KA: We would like to use a local supply, but the problem is the local supply that is available for farm 
work now are on drugs, unwilling to work, and lazy work habits, certainly not all of them, but the vast 
majority of the people that are willing to do the farm work. The stigma of the farm work is that it could 
be hot, long, dirty and cold. All of those are true from time to time, but there is still a great deal of 
satisfaction in something about being outside. My guys can take the afternoon off and go hunting, they 
do, or they need to do something else if the work is done. Granted they’re doing the 60 hours, it’s 
23 
 
spread out. It’s not the hard physical work, the manual is gone. This is driving the skid steer. The hard 
part is actually milking the cows and it’s truly a supply and a demand. That is, as the people, say for 
example, the big change here, the first change, was in the early 80s when Fort Drum became Fort Drum, 
Camp Drum became Fort Drum and all the construction. The top of your dairy employees went to 
construction jobs in Fort Drum and never came back. When they came back they were in construction 
working for themselves or whatever. The next change was the prison facilities. And you know I can’t 
blame these people, good money, benefits, and everything else. What you’re left with know is kind of 
the bottom of the barrel, almost unemployable. We’ve had good people here, but between their 
girlfriends, car trouble and drug problems, 2 out of the 3, you can deal with one, but if you had all 3, 
they were gone. 
(1:20:20) 
VC: Drugs or alcohol? 
KA: Mainly drugs. 
PA: Alcohol problems, because they would drink and wouldn’t come in the morning. 
KA: Family relations. If you had girlfriend and car trouble, they were gone. Being an around the clock 
enterprise, you need dependable help, and so robots. 
(1:20:50) 
VC: How would you change immigrant policy if you had the chance to do it? 
KA: It’s really simple. It’s really simple. At our embassy in Mexico, Guatemala or whatever, you would 
have a sign up, come in, fingerprint them, do background checks, and say I have 300 jobs in New York 
State on dairy farms, who would like to go? Here you are, you have a 3 year visa, and it can be you have 
to be criminal free and maintain status and pay taxes, everything else, and then re-up it or whatever, 
then a path to citizenship if you want it. I don’t know what the process is now. 
(1:21:35) 
VC: Two or three years like a probationary thing? 
KA: Like a work visa. They have the H2A program, but it’s primarily for vegetable farms; you come in and 
you work. The guys that I know who have it, it’s heavy duty documentation, it is very burdensome. All 
these guys want to do is work and provide income to send some money home so their family can live. 
There are no jobs there. Guatemala has the highest murder per capita rate going right now, so they have 
real problems there; there’s no opportunities there at all. Both of the gentleman that work for us, both 
of their fathers are dead; one died of alcohol and the other didn’t ask me, so I don’t know if he got killed 
or not. Their mothers are living, their sisters are there, they’re sending money home. You’re not going to 
like this Varick, but what it is our safety net system here. . . 
VC: No, I don’t disagree with you. 
24 
 
KA: . . . has provided a meaningless living, but a way. It’s not that these individuals are unintelligent; it 
provides them an easy living. It’s a poor quality living, but they can rig it, free heat, cell phone, 60 
minutes, money coming in, food stamps, and that safety net doesn’t provide any area for dignity. 
(1:23:09) 
VC: My problem with the safety net, and I agree with you, there are lots of problems with it, is that in 
order to help the people who truly need the help, it allows for other people who don’t need the help. 
How you can individualize in our democratic society, I just don’t know how you can do that. 
KA: Well how you do it, is how it used to be done. You had a neighbor that needed some help, and you 
provided the help, or the township did something for them. 
PA: Or the church. 
KA: Or the church, or whatever. Now you have this anonymous federal government or state government 
or county government. Did you know we’re paying for bypass surgeries? Did you know that? Did you 
know we’re paying to reverse having your tubes tied? All that stuff. And the cell phone, what is the cell 
phone for? You are supposed to be using it call to work to see if you can reach you for your 
appointments, so it’s all that, and we’re running out of money. What is being squeezed is our highest 
rate of Medicaid, is actually our elderly because they can’t afford to stay in their homes. 
(1:24:38) 
VC: Are you religious, and if so does that play any role in your choice for being on a farm? 
KA: I won’t speak for Phyllis, but I think Phyllis believes in God. I am fairly agnostic. I kind of believe for 
myself that things work out for a reason and if you are a good individual, that things will take care of 
itself. I am certainly rough on some irresponsible employees and I’m probably rough on Phyllis because 
of my employees and the nature of the stress of the job; I am definitely far from perfect. But I don’t 
steal from anybody, I don’t cheat anybody, and that is kind of my thing and I work hard. 
VC: Does that sound like an odd question? 
PA: I guess, because I do believe in God and feel that I am somewhat religious, I don’t go to church all 
the time, and I have my own reasons for not doing that, too, but I don’t know if it has anything to do 
with my life on the farm. 
(1:25:58) 
VC: The reason I said that is because a lot of people have gone into farming because of their religion. 
[Varick pauses the recording. End of track one.] 
(0:00:00) 
KA: One thing I wanted to tell you, I must’ve bee out of the room when you mentioned to Phyllis that 
you were surprised that most farmers had 2 and 4 year college degrees. I would tell you this: that the 
25 
 
farmers that I meet and are running successful operations are the smartest people that I know. And I’ve 
run across some pretty intelligent people in other walks of life, but to do this job and to accomplish it, 
you’re highly intelligent and it’s going to get tougher yet. 
(0:00:36) 
VC: When I said that I didn’t mean that…but I found that fascinating having grown up. 
KA: Well, it never used to be that way. If you look at the old timers-- and I want to say, did you ever 
know Jim Fife? 
VC: Oh yeah. 
KA: Jim Fife graduated from Canton Tech, and Jim probably graduated in the 40s maybe? Say the 50s 
because his son David graduated in the 70s. It’d be rare in those days. Jim Fisher went to St. Lawrence, 
not an ag school, came home to farm. Jim Fife went to ag school, and others around this area, so they 
had to be really the cream of the crop to go to college, or their fathers and mothers thought it was 
important that they had that experience. But nobody’s going to make it now; well you could make it 
with a 2 year degree and a strong back. 
VC: But look what is happening to 2 year degrees, they’re disappearing. I was on the faculty for Canton 
College for 32 years and most of the time I was there it was 2 year programs, but I think Joe Kennedy 
and others were seeing that this wasn’t going…[discussion of 2 year vs. 4 year programs] 
(0:02:56) 
VC: I had a brother-in-law[…] whose father used to work on farms and observed farms a lot, and he 
always said that the reason farmers went out of business was because they were not good business 
men. 
KA: That’s very true. Well, I think what they thought was, and definitely the margins were easier, 
although at the time they didn’t think the margins were, but they were, between cheaper feed and the 
cost of replacement and your actual milk price which looked like a pittance then, was actually pretty 
good money. The $13 that I started out with in 1983 would be $34 or $35 today. And pickup trucks were 
$6 or $8000 and now they are $38000. So it’s kind of reversed. Even though it was tougher physically, 
tougher to do, more back—if you had a good back you could be successful with your work because the 
margins were there. Now you have to be pretty smart and it really doesn’t matter how hard you work 
because if you’re losing money and you keep working at it you’re going to go out. That aspect of it is just 
much more sophisticated, much more complex. Back then I think people had time to get together and 
do things. Of course you didn’t have as much TV or any TV, so I think your community events, your social 
events, your church events, those were the things. People got together and played cards and did that 
kind of thing and conversation and meeting the neighbors was a big thing. 
(0:04:45) 
26 
 
VC: The grange. In your father’s day was the grange there? 
KA: Yes, it was there in Madrid. I think it is gone there now. It had its hay day. So Farm Bureau had kind 
of taken its place in more of a political side of things, hardly at all social. 
(0:05:04) 
VC: Phyllis, what was women’s role on farm growing up? 
PA: My mother did not work outside of the house. She took care of the younger children, there were 6 
of us.  Us kids always had our jobs we did on the farm, we helped feed cows, he helped feed calves, 
throw down hay from the hay mow, clean the tank, clean the machines. 
(0:05:42) 
VC: Did you keep other animals, too? 
PA: We had pigs, chickens, a big garden. 
VC: Do you do any of that now? 
KA: No, we don’t do any of that now. We had a big garden, we had pigs, and we had chickens. My 
mother used the chickens to pave this driveway; that and when the Farmer’s Market opened up in 
Canton she would go every Wednesday with virtually a hundred loaves of bread, and tea rings. And did 
that for 2 summers. She raised $5,000 for the driveway. She wanted, she was tired of the mud coming in 
the house. She was a determined woman, you know. That was her mission and that is what she did. I 
know, my father had the money, he could have put that driveway in, but he was perfectly content with 
her baking. She’d be up late at night and stuff would still be warm when she showed up in Canton. 
PA: I’m not sure there was more time, I think there was just a stronger labor force and more kids. 
KA: Definitely the kids. 
PA: My father’s day was still long, up at 4 and went to bed at 8, it was definitely still a long day, but we 
kind of did the garden…. 
KA: Maybe we are just romanticizing about the past. 
PA: I think that’s how things happened, we had gardens, we had chickens and pigs, but there was 6 kids 
to be doing some part of that and still mowing the lawn. 
(0:07:23) 
VC: What is your take on the Amish and their impact, if any at all, coming into our communities? 
KA: We’re far enough away from it. I think if you were in DePeyster and trying to run a commercial farm 
other there, they have taken up a lot of the land. I think it’s fine what they’re doing; it definitely has an 
27 
 
impact as far as school taxes and property taxes on the local community, but they’re not requiring any 
services.  
VC: You say an impact because they are paying taxes. 
KA: Well, they are paying, but they would be a reduced assessment for sure, no electricity or whatever, 
but like is said, they aren’t tearing up the road with heavy equipment or anything like that. They 
obviously came here because there was an opportunity, land was available and when they came here 
and got themselves established, that land was abandoned. There was an opportunity for people with 40 
to 50 cows to sell out to the Amish. There wasn’t any stigma, they were kind of a novelty, but now I 
think in those communities it’s more head to head. Some of the people we know, there is a general 
disdain for each other, which I didn’t know existed. But I think they came here and saw an opening as far 
as these abandoned farms. Now the farms are bigger and they need that land, so they’re actually 
competing with the Amish. The Amish have gas wells, they have the capital, or the bishop has the capital 
or whatever. 
PA: It’s like any people in a neighborhood; there’s differences in personalities and difference in how they 
are. They could be Amish and can also have difference in how they are, so I think they get along 
differently with neighbors just depending on that. There’s good neighbors and not so good neighbors. 
KA: Phyllis’s mother rented to the Amish. Phyllis’ mother’s place will be for sale and the Amish have 
been renting 60 acres of it, or more. They’re actually having a family meeting this weekend to decide 
what they’re doing. 
PA: Probably 30 years, it’s been 30 years since my father passed away. 
(0:09:56) 
VC: Have they been tilling the land? 
PA: Pasturing cows and taking hay. 
KA: It’s a revert to the 50s without electricity, that is all it is, same thing. Kids are pulling the teats on 25 
cows, not the father, the kids. 
(0:10:20) 
VC: Can you think of anything we haven’t touched upon or that you would like to add? 
KA: The challenges are the economics of it here in St. Lawrence County. We do have some advantages 
with the land, we have water. I think the challenge is going to be with the consumer and the non-farm 
public, because the nonfarm public is 2 and 3 generations removed. So increasingly we have people in 
Albany and Washington telling us we need to be doing certain things that really have no idea which 
they’re actually requesting. They may think they have good intentions and it’s really hurting farms and 
hurting family farms and they’re actually fostering larger concentration--faster than what it’s been in the 
past. To comply with, we are at the point right now, Phyllis is sick of it, it changes so often, maybe we 
28 
 
need to be contracting with someone else to do that work. Environmentally, much more stringent 
requirements; I have to keep a record of the weather before the day spread, the day I spread, and the 
day after I spread, and the rainfall, the amount of rainfall; all good intentions, but it has a burden. So, 
there’s parts of it that are good, but the problem is getting the message out that we are really, really 
excellent stewards of the land. That we’re drinking the water, we’re eating off this land, we’re providing 
a really open space for the community. You like the open space, but maybe don’t like the smell, well you 
need to figure out that comes with the open space type thing. You may want to get around our wide 
equipment going down the road and you may be frustrated. So I think we as farmers are going to be and 
need to be more proactive about who we are and what we stand for and how we have mutual interests 
and stuff. That’s an ongoing challenge, so that’s an additional burden in addition to running the farm 
and that’s difficult enough. We never encouraged our 3 kids to come back to the farm, we knew how 
hard it was to make it work and we’re smart enough to know how tough it’s going to be in the future, 
but at the same time, there’s wonderful opportunities in agriculture with this growing population and 
with the technology, so I think there is a real future in it, a real future, for somebody who is prepared for 
that challenge. 
(0:13:18) 
VC: Would it shock you if one of your 3 boys decided to come back? 
PA: Oh yes, it would definitely shock us I think. 
KA: Yes, it would definitely shock us. We would probably actually discourage them. I am just about at 
the end of my career, and that’s about the last thing I want to do is stick around another 20 to make 
sure they get it going. They don’t have the background that I had. They milked cows, they picked stones, 
they drove a little bit of equipment, but it is totally different. I grew up in it, I was immersed in it, and it’s 
not like I had to learn that, you know, you’re going to freeze your fingers and stuff’s going to break in 
the winter time and water’s going to freeze and you need to know how to fix this or maintain this or be 
cognizant of what this animal might do in this type of situation; run you over or whatever or deliver a 
calf. All that stuff they don’t have, so it would be almost like bringing somebody from the city in, almost, 
other than they know what it takes to do it. They’re sharp, they could definitely do it, but they’re sharp 
enough to know they don’t want to do it, too. 
PA: They have other options. 
KA: They have other options. And it’s easy, it was easy because I was definitely not coming back to the 
farm; that was the last thing I wanted to do. Certainly today there are farmers that are disappointed that 
their kids aren’t coming back; we never had that, this is a first generation farm when my father was 
here, I guess I’m the second generation, so I don’t have 6 or 7 generations behind me, I don’t feel any 
peer pressure to hang onto this place. 
(0:15:13) 
VC: Like the Fisher family might. 
29 
 
KA: The Fisher family might. And also we’ve had a lot of tragedies here at our place. A lot of family stuff 
go on and just different things; it hasn’t been a piece of heaven all the way though. Phyllis and I and our 
boys, we have had a very nice life, but my family, we’ve gone through a lot with 10 kids. 
VC: I can’t thank you enough, this is very great. You have been very forthcoming. 
KA: Well, I’m glad you are doing it, stuff like this is gone if you don’t do it. 
VC: That is one of the things I am pleased with, is the Library of Congress program that they call the 
American Folk Life Center, it was a competitive thing, and Hannah put together a good proposal..I’ll turn 
this off now [end of recording].
