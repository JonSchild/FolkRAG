John BrownOh I love the summers flowers and the briars and the [bowers?],And I love a woman's
voice low and sweet, John Brown.But I hate their false pretence, and their lack of common sense,That
turns their good to evil by complaint[;?] [JOhn?] Brown.For it [?] [stirs?] my heart to hate when I close
my garden gate,And view the world all over and about, John Brown.
