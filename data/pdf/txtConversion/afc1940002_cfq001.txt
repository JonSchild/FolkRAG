New Mexican Spanish Feasts
83 New Mexican Spanish Feasts
JUAN B. RAEL
Popular Spanish traditions and customs which up to 1910 enjoyed undisputed sway
among New Mexicans 1 have been losing ground rapidly during the last three decades.
This is not true of all, but it is true of many of the most colorful, especially those of a
religious character. Some of these customs have disappeared with dizzying rapidity.
Many a custom dating back to the Spanish Colonial period and even to the Middle Ages
has disappeared almost completely in the brief period of a decade. On the other hand,
there are certain practices which, though seemingly an anachronism in the changing life
environment of New Mexicans, are so deeply rooted in the lives of the people and have so
great an appeal to the popular fancy that they continue to be as popular as ever.
1 This article has reference to the customs in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado
and, particularly, in the New Mexican village of Arroyo Hondo, and many of the things
stated here do not necessarily apply to other parts of New Mexico.
Among the traditions and customs that are on the verge of disappearing is a feast dating
back to the 13th century that is particularly interesting because of the manner in which it
has evolved. This feast is usually known as  La Percíngula,  but it is also called   the two
forms are New Mexican variants of the Spanish  Porciúncula  (from Italian).
Porciúncula,  Italian diminutive form of  porción,  was the name given to a small portion of
the land in the neighborhood of Assisi, Italy, which the monks of St. Benedict gave to St.
Francis. It was also the name given to the little chapel in ruins on that piece of land, the
place where St. Francis experienced his religious vocation. It was in this chapel, which the
saint restored from a dilapidated state to a habitable dwelling, that he received revelations
and supernatural grace from God. For this reason he always spoke of it with the greatest

of reverence, advising his followers never to abandon it and declaring that whosoever
should pray in it with fervor would be heard.
The name  Porciúncula  was also given to the plenary indulgence that could be gained
by visiting this sanctuary on August 2d. This grace, 84 according to tradition, was granted
to St. Francis by Christ in 1221. Shortly afterward it was recognized canonically by Pope
Honorius III, who set August 2d of each year as the date on which the visit to the temple
should be made. Later, the time was extended so that the visit could be made at any time
between the afternoon of August 1st and sunset of the following day. The indulgence could
be gained at first only in the  Porciúncula,  but in 1480 Pope Sixtus IV extended it to all
the churches of the First and Second Orders of St. Francis, and in 1622 Pope Gregory
XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the Capuchins. The act of devotion
that was to be performed consisted of confession, the receiving of Holy Communion, and
the visitation of one of the churches designated. Later in the same century the privilege
was extended not only to all the churches of the Third Order, but also to all churches with
which the Franciscans were connected in any way, including non-Franciscan churches
in which the Third Order held its meetings. 2 It must have been through this channel that
the observance of the feast was brought to New Mexico by the early Spanish settlers, for
the  penitentes  or flagellant brothers, the sponsors of the feast in New Mexico, appear to
be an outgrowth of the Third Order of St. Francis. The strange thing about the existence
of the feast in New Mexico is that it is not general. In fact, I know of only one place where
it is observed either in southern Colorado or in New Mexico, and that is in the little town
of Arroyo Hondo, about eighty miles north of Santa Fe and about forty miles south of the
Colorado—New Mexico boundary.

The feast is observed under the auspices of the flagellant brothers, who take full charge
of all the ceremonies, though anyone may partake in it. Formerly, according to one of
my informers, the preparations were in the hands of some kind of lay sisters—apparently
female members of the flagellant organization, but my informer was vague about them. At
present, the preparations are under the direct care of several  mayordomos  or sponsors
selected from among the  Penitente  brotherhood.
In the village of Arroyo Hondo a double observance of the feast is held. In this place there
are two plazas, both of which are hemmed in by flat-roofed adobe houses, as is usual
in most New Mexican villages. The two plazas are about a mile apart from each other
and each has its own  morada,  or chapter house. Since their origin, there has always
been 85 a certain amount of rivalry between the two branches, and on religious feast days
each one celebrates the particular feast independently of the other. With regard to  La
Porciúncula,  this was not always the case. Previous to 1902, the feast was observed only
in the place where the main church is situated, and under the auspices of the  morada 
near the church; but in that year the double celebration of the feast came into being.
The feast is observed on the eve of August 2d and the ceremonies consist of a  velorio 
or wake. The wake begins after it grows dark. Prayers are recited and  alabados  3 
luminarias  or bonfires, which were lighted just as the procession started.
3 There are some two hundred alabados  in circulation. Some of them are really traditional
religious ballads. The alabados  are found in manuscript form, though some of them exist
also in oral tradition. The alabados  are usually sung with musical accompaniment, and
there are different melodies for most of them. With the exception of a few, which come
from church hymnbooks, the majority of these melodies have never been published. The
present writer has made recordings thus far of some sixty, and he and Dean J. L. Kittle
of the Adams State Teachers College, Alamosa, Colorado, are now preparing them for
publication.

Shortly before the church procession began, another procession from the  morada, 
a quarter of a mile away, got under way. In this procession, only the members of
the flagellant brotherhood took part. In it there were usually eight or ten barefooted 
penitentes,  naked above the waist. The only clothing they wore was a pair of homemade
drawers, and a handkerchief with which they covered their faces. These flagellants
scourged themselves, as the procession progressed, with disciplines made from the
palmlike leaves of the  amole  or soap plant. Seldom did they ever carry the  maderos, 
or heavy wooden crosses, used in their other religious ceremonies. The flagellants were
accompanied by other members of the fraternity dressed in their usual street clothes. The
accompanying brothers sang an  alabado,  or a member of the organization played an 
alabado  melody on a homemade flute. This group joined the end of the main procession,
which advanced slowly around the church. During the procession, the rosary was recited
out loud by the faithful, a leader reciting the first part of the “Our Father” and the “Hail
Mary” and the rest of the people reciting the second part. Before the beginning of each
decade, the appropriate mystery was sung, during which the procession stopped. When
the 86 singing of the mystery ended, the recitation of the rosary continued and the
procession advanced slowly. The progress of the procession around the church was timed
so that the recitation of the rosary should end just as the head of the procession reached
the main entrance to the church once more. The people entered the church and the
flagellant brothers returned to the  morada  in the same manner in which they had come.
Thereafter, the singing of  alabados  continued throughout the night. Toward midnight,
dinner was served in a neighboring house. The dinner was prepared under the direction of
the sponsors and at the expense of all the members of the fraternity. Everybody, whether
a member of the community or a stranger, was invited to partake of the repast.
morada.  The self-flagellation went on in the church as well as during the procession. As
to what took place in the  morada,  no one knows, for only the members of the society
are permitted to enter on such occasions and they keep absolute secrecy about their

indoor ceremonies. At the wake the singing of  alabados  went on till dawn, at which time
everybody went home.
I have spoken to many of the old folk who have been taking part in this solemnity for
years and have tried to learn from them about its origin, history, and meaning, but with
scarcely any results. Even the name of the feast,  percíngula  or  precíngula,  is of no
special significance to the people, and naturally they know nothing about the indulgence
granted to those who observed the feast in the manner prescribed by the Church. 87
Of course, in a village such as Arroyo Hondo, which has almost always been without a
priest, the fulfillment of the prescribed requirements was practically impossible. It was only
natural, then, for the people to substitute some other form of devotion. The reason for the
lack of information on the part of the people is that no written records were kept and that
the members of the brotherhood, independent of the Church as they have nearly always
been in New Mexico, did not have the clergy to remind them from time to time about the
meaning and nature of the solemnity. The practice was carried down from generation to
generation as a mere routine till sight was lost of the original purpose of the feast.
There are other feasts and practices that are suffering the same fate as  La Porciúncula. 
The custom of performing a religious folk play at the Christmas holidays, for example,
is dying out. In former days, either of two dramas was performed:  Los Pastores,  which
deals with the Nativity, or  El Niño Perdido,  which deals with the finding of Our Lord in
the Temple. The latter play is no longer performed at all, but the former still enjoys a high
degree of popularity. The reason for this is that  Los Pastores,  many of whose characters
are shepherds, has a stronger human appeal than  El Niño Perdido,  and reflects to
an appreciable degree the lives of many of the people in that region. Furthermore,
incorporated in this play are certain songs with melodies that have always appealed to the
popular fancy, so much so that nearly everyone knows them by heart. This naturally keeps
the interest in the play alive.

Another feast that used to be observed by the performance of a religious folk play was
that of the Epiphany, on January 6th. The play acted was  Los Reyes Magos,  the Magi.
Compared to the two dramas previously mentioned, this one seems to have been the
least popular, and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, it has not been performed in
southern Colorado or northern New Mexico during the last thirty years.
As for the Lenten Friday devotions and the Holy Week solemnities, they continue to
be observed, but in a form much modified over that of thirty years ago. The public
processions in which the  penitentes  appeared, scouring themselves or carrying heavy
crosses, have been suppressed in nearly all New Mexican villages, and all the other
ceremonies are observed in a much smaller scale than formerly. For the modification of
these ceremonies, and for that matter those pertaining to  La Porciúncula  also, there
are several reasons. The  penitentes  are rapidly decreasing in numbers, and as a
consequence all the ceremonies of the organization have declined in popularity among
the inhabitants of the different villages. 88 Furthermore, many of the people who attend
these feasts now are not drawn to them out of devotion, as formerly, but out of curiosity,
and they often act disrespectfully and sometimes even cause disturbances. The members
of the organization, sensing this disrespectful if not hostile attitude, have withdrawn more
and more from before the public eye. The suppression of many of the ceremonies is also
due to the unwelcome presence of outsiders who, eager for excitement, have not only
intruded upon the privacy of the organization, but often have gone so far as to interrupt its
ceremonies.
Other feast days that are still observed, besides those already mentioned, are those of St.
Anthony, St. John, St. James, and St. Ann.
On the feast days of St. Anthony and St. John, which occur respectively on June 13th
and June 24th, it is customary to have a procession across the cultivated fields. In these
processions the image of the saint as well as that of the Lord or the Virgin are carried
by the faithful, and prayers are said in order that the people may be blessed with good

crops. The procession lasts nearly all day, and in the evening, sometimes, there is a wake
in honor of the saint. The wake may take place in a chapel or in the home of one of the
faithful.
Of more importance than the feast days of St. Anthony and St. John, as far as their
popularity is concerned, though of less religious significance, are the feasts of St. James
and St. Ann, which occur on July 25th and 26th, respectively. Formerly, an outdoor game
known as  correr gallo,
Aside from the feasts above mentioned, most of which are observed in nearly all New
Mexican villages, every town has its own patron saint, whose feast day it generally
commemorates in its own way, often with games and dancing, but nearly always with a
wake.

Among the nonreligious feasts, those pertaining to weddings are particularly interesting.
The typical New Mexican wedding ceremonies usually extend over two days: the day
preceding the wedding, known as  el día del prendorio,  and the wedding day, referred to
as  el día del casorio.

but also among the very poor.

Entrega de novios,  and is so named because the bride and bridegroom are returned
once more to their parents and placed under their guidance. When all the guests have
crowded around the bride and bridegroom, a singer begins to sing a wedding song to the
newlyweds, informing them of the significance of their new state of life. 5

lines) in honor of that person. The person serenaded invites the serenaders into his house
and gives them refreshments. The crowd then moves on to another house, sometimes
walking long distances from farmhouse to farmhouse. This serenading, which begins at
midnight, often continues till about eight in the morning.
