D: 
Let's me just say on tape that this is Wednesday, July 26, 1989, and this 
is Doug DeNatale and David Taylor talking with John Royal and his mother. 
Mrs. Royal, what's your name? 
A: 
Albina. 
D: 
Albina. 
A-L-B-I-N-A? 
J: 
Yeah. 
A: 
Yes, you got it right. 
D: 
As you know, I talked with your son yesterday quite a bit about the story 
of your husband coming here from Colorado here to San Pedro and organizing the 
union of longshoremen [several words unclear here due to noise produced by  
overhead fan] coal strikes in Colorado. 
So, I wanted to talk to you in 
particular about that. 
A: 
Well, you ask me and if I can remember I will tell you. 
D: 
O.K. 
A: 
He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado, on the 4th of July in 1913. 
D: 
And you were, you were, ah, were you born in Colorado? 
A: 
Yes. 
D: 
And how did your family happen to come there? 
A: 
My parents came over here in the eighteen hundreds. 
I don't know just 
what year, but they came over from Italy in the eighteen hundreds. 
And I was 
born in Colorado. 
J: 
Your dad came first. 
A: 
Yes, my father came first and he settled in Syracuse, New York, and lived 
there for seven years. 
Then he went back and married my mother and stayed 
z 
there, I guess, for a couple years and came over here. 
Then he came out to 
Colorado to find an uncle of mine. 
He promised his parents that he would find 
him. 
He came to this country and never wrote to them. 
So they asked my 
father if he'd find him, and he did. 
And he, otherwise he would have settled 
back in New York. 
He carne west to find my uncle. 
And he found him. 
D: 
How did he know that he was in Colorado? 
A: 
I don't know. 
I guess just an instinct. 
J: 
A lot of the Italians at that time came west to work in the coal mines, 
you know. 
And that was what he, he finally went to Newcastle, (A: 
Mm-hmm.) 
and that's where him and grandma settled down. 
A: 
That's, they, so did Uncle Tom (J: 
Yeah.) 
they all settled there. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
T: 
What region of Italy were your parents from? 
A: 
They were from the Abruzzis, (T: 
Mm-Hmm.) Province of the Abruzzi? 
(T: 
Mm-Hmm.) 
And the name of the town is [sounds like: 
Arc-uh-lay-tuh]. 
(T: 
Mm-Hmm.) 
It's [one or two words unclear] from Rome. 
T: 
Yeah. 
Were there people in Colorado where you lived from who were from 
Abruzzi as well? 
A: 
Yeah, there were a lot of them. 
They were from different parts of Italy, 
but there was a lot of them there. 
Now, my husband, he comes from northern 
part of Italy. 
He's Tuscani. 
(T: 
Mm-Hmm.) 
He comes from northern part of 
Italy. 
D: 
So, at the time when you were born your father was working in the coal 
mines? 
A: 
Yes, mmhmm. 
D: 
And where in Colorado were you living? 
A: 
In Newcastle, Colorado. 
(D: 
Newcastle.) 
That was a great, in the early 
days, that was before I was born, there were 24 saloons and 18 dance halls. 
[laughs) 
T: 
How many people lived there? 
A: 
Oh, I really don't know to tell you, 
(T: 
Yeah.) 
But it was quite a nice 
place to live at that time. 
(T: 
Mmhmm.) 
J: 
It's still there. 
It's 18 miles this side of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, 
where you turn off to go to Aspen. 
Yeah. 
It's a wide spot in the road now, 
but. 
(T: 
Yeah.) 
A: 
It's just a little ghost town now. 
T: 
What was the town like, if you can remember some of your earliest memories 
3 
of the place? 
A: 
It was a nice little, what I call an old fashioned town. 
We had the 
boardwalk and just had one main street. 
(T: 
Mmhmm.) 
And ah, you go along 
that way and grocery stores and saloons and the schools, everything was on 
that one street. 
D: 
There were how many saloons and dance halls there at one time? 
A: 
There were 24 saloons, I think, and 18 dance halls in that town. 
D: 
How, how many were left by your time? 
A: 
Oh, not too many, cause I was the last, youngest of the family. 
I 
remember one saloon. 
It was still standing there when I was a little girl. 
Cause, ah, you know, women weren't allowed in saloons. 
And ah we used to go 
out in back and buy beer in a pail for my dad [laughs]. 
D: 
Did they, was there any expression for that? 
Did they call that practice 
anything? 
A:. 
No, they just send, sent us to buy beer. 
We knew the saloon keeper. 
D: 
I'm just curious because in Lowell, Massachusetts, where I've done some 
work (J: 
Uh-huh.) 
they would do the same thing and they called it "rushing 
the growler." 
J: 
I'll be darned. 
[several people laugh] 
I never heard that. 
A: 
I didn't either. 
J: 
Well, I guess, if you drink enough beer or that jungle juice you're going 
to growl [several people laugh], so maybe that's why. 
A: 
Then my dad he also used to make wine out of dry raisins. 
We didn't have 
the fresh grapes, but he'd use raisins. 
He made good wine. 
D: 
And, and he would buy that, get that from a store? 
A: 
Hmm, they'd, they'd order the raisins. 
D: 
So, he would order it special? 
A: 
Mm-Hmm. 
D: 
Where, do you remember where it got that from? 
A: 
Gosh, no, I have no idea. 
D: 
Is it something that he would order directly or through a store? 
A: 
I guess he must have got it through the store, I think. 
J: 
If I remember him talking about it, he used to say that he used to wait a 
I 
long time to get them wooden cases of raisins. 
(A: 
Yeah.) 
I want to say 
they probably came from California to Denver and then on down to Newcastle, 
but I'm not sure. 
A: 
Now, he always made his own wine, but it was with raisins. 
But it was 
good wine. 
D: 
Was there any special name for that wine that was made from raisins? 
A: 
No, just called it "raisin wine." 
(J: Yeah.) 
D: 
Was there an Italian name for that? 
A: 
Ah, how would they say? 
I can't, don't remember too [one or two words 
unclear]. 
D: 
Now, were, were there, there must have been a fair number of Italians. 
A: 
I think the majority was Italian. 
And there were a lot of Russians there, 
but they were farmers. 
(D: 
Huh.) 
I can remember the, when they'd haul, they 
were in the sugar beet business. 
I remember the Russian women bringing big 
loads of sugar beets into town. 
And they'd load the freight cars, you know, 
ship 'em out. 
A lot of Russians. 
D: 
Was there much mingled between the Italians and the Russians? 
A: 
No, when I, as I can remember the Italians worked in the coal mine, the 
Russians did the farming. 
D: 
So, it was pretty separate? 
A: 
Ah-huh. 
good. 
But there wasn't ever any trouble. 
The all seemed to get along 
D: 
Now was this, was Newcastle a company town? 
A: 
well, what'd you call it? 
J: 
Well, it wasn't a company town in the sense that they paid their miners, I 
guess, with script like they did in the early days down around ah [sounds  
like: 
Man-ak-wuh], and Trinidad and that. 
A: 
They used to call the mines then the C, F 
J: 
C-F and I. 
(A: 
C, F and I.) 
But most of the people that worked for the 
mines, you know, they would depend on the mine and the mine, I guess the mine 
company probably owns a lot of the stores too, uh? 
(A: 
I think they did.) 
So, I guess, in a way you could say probably it was a company town. 
D: 
What did you do for amusement when you were a child? 
A: 
Oh, when I was a child, well, I had three brothers. 
In the winter time we 
had all kinds of amusement. 
They'd go ice skating and build big bobsleds and 
we'd, we'd go way up on top of a mountain [one or two words unclear] to the 
-5-
top.  
[laughs] 
Then we'd pull it all the way back. 
We used to have a lot of 
fun with the snow. 
Summertime they'd go fishing, go swimming in the creeks. 
We had a lot of creeks. 
J: 
Yeah, tell 'em how hard the family worked and your mother being, cooking 
and washing clothes and cooking for the bachelor miners and all that. 
A: 
Oh, that was in Mount Harris. 
J: 
Oh, is that in Mount Harris? 
A: 
Yeah, this is where my parents moved. 
They went to another coal mining 
town and my mother took over the boarding house. 
She had 33 boarders. 
She 
used to get up at 3 o'clock in the morning and cook three meals a day for 
them. 
God, she worked hard. 
And they were just barely breaking even. 
And so 
my dad got all the boarders one evening this one evening and told 'em, he said 
"We're going to have to raise the board bill," he said, "because," he said, 
"we're not making it." 
And they, they all agreed. 
He showed them the figures 
and everything. 
And they were nice about it. 
They raised each one three 
dollars. 
But mom did a lot of home cooking, she was a wonderful cook. 
D: 
Were the boarders, were they all Italian? 
A: 
Most of them, the majority of them were Italian. 
I can't remember any 
other nationality except Italian. 
J: 
I remember dad telling me down in the southern mine fields they had a lot 
of Yugoslays, like Doctor [sounds like: 
Yawk-a-vitch's] father and 
A: 
Yeah, he comes from ah, oh, what's the 
J: 
Over by Bear River, down in southern 
A: 
At Gunnison. 
J: 
By Gunnison. 
But I remember dad telling me that there was quite a few 
Yugoslays in ah 
A: 
Not, not in Newcastle. 
J: 
No, in southern mine fields. 
Yeah. 
A: 
Maybe down there, but not in Newcastle. 
D: 
Now, where were you living when you and your husband met? 
A: 
In ah Mount Harris. 
My father had taken up a homestead. 
How far, about 
ten miles out of town? 
J: 
About three, four miles out of town, out of this little mining town called 
Mount Harris, that's 18 miles from Steamboat Springs. 
A: 
And ah, he bought, picked up this homestead and that's where we lived. 
Built a house and did some farming. 
D: 
What kinds of crops did he raise? 
A: 
Potatoes. 
You should see the potato crop he used to get. 
Well, this is 
after I'm married. 
My husband and I one year planted one sack of potatoes we 
harvested one hundred sack out of one sack. 
That was a great crop that time. 
And when we lived in Mount Harris, our summers were only three months long. 
You'd be surprised at what you could raise in three months. 
We used to raise 
cabbage that weighed 26 pounds a head. 
Huge, big cabbage. 
And in that short 
a time it was [one word unclear], it was pure. 
D: 
Were those being raised to be shipped out of the area? 
A: 
No, we just sold them to the coal, the people worked in the coal mines. 
It was nice those three months. 
It was surprising what you could raise. And 
we ah, we got some chickens, we got some ducks, and we got some pigs and we 
[two or three words unclear]. 
J: 
But, in addition to working the homestead, he worked in the mines (A: 
Yeah.) when the mines were open. 
A: 
Yeah, he worked in the mines and then. 
Dad worked every day. 
And when he 
was home he 
D: 
He split, he split back and forth. 
A: 
Ah-huh. 
But it was a nice life. 
It was hard work but it was a nice clear 
life. 
D: 
So, when he was involved with the Ludlow Massacre and all that, that was, 
that was 
A: 
That was before I knew him. 
D: 
Did he talk much about that? 
A: 
Oh, yes. 
He took me back there to show it to me after we married. 
Took a 
trip down there. 
That's how we got the pictures of the monument. 
D: 
Can you remember any of the specific things he, he would tell you about 
that? 
A: 
Oh, yes, he, he told us about when they were striking. 
See all of the 
union men moved out, they had to move out of the camp because it was a company 
camp. 
And they moved into what was just nothing but sagebrush and put up 
camps, I mean tents. 
And the militia, they sent the militia out there and 
they killed women, children and all. 
Set fire to the tents. 
It was terrible, 
they ah tell it. 
D: 
How did your, how did your husband manage to get away? 
A: 
Ah, I don't know. 
He managed to get away. 
He was by himself, he didn't 
have no family, you know. 
But it was awful. 
D: 
Did he actually witness the shooting. 
A: 
Yes. 
I think he was in it. 
He said it was terrible what they did. 
He 
could never forget it. 
That's why after we married several years later he 
wanted to take me over there and show it to me, and that's how come we got the 
pictures. 
I got several pictures but I can't find what I did with them. 
J: 
Yeah, then, then, I think pop and a lot of miners took to the hills then. 
A: 
Yeah, they did, they ah, they had to run away. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
You know, 
cause they were shooting 'em. 
They set fire to all the tents. 
They killed a 
lot of children and women. 
That was awful what they did. 
J: 
I think that lasted 18 months, if I'm not mistaken. 
A: 
He had ah, he had no shoes and he used to take the gunny sacks, 
'em, you know what they are, wrap his feet with gunny sacks. 
Well, 
were on strike, they couldn't buy anything. 
And I guess they lived 
game, whatever they could get. 
And they had some hard times. 
That 
think, in 19, just right after he came from Italy. 
J: 
14, I think. 
I told you yesterday I thought it was 17, but I 
in 1914. 
He'd been here about a year I guess when ah. 
we'd call 
see, they 
on wild 
was, I 
think it 
D: 
He was just a, just a young kid. 
A: 
He was 17 when he came here. 
J: 
Yeah, 1913 and 14. 
A: 
In Italy he worked in the marble quarries. 
D: 
Yeah, John was saying yesterday 
A: 
He also took me back there and showed me the marble quarries where he 
worked. 
Interesting. 
D: 
Ah, how did he come to Mount Harris? 
was 
A: 
He happened to have one brother that lived in Pueblo, Colorado, and he 
worked in the steel mill. 
So, when he came from Italy my husband, that's 
where he went, to his brother. 
And, ah, he didn't seem to like working in the 
steel mill, and he heard about the coal mines, so he jumped freight trains and 
went to coal camps. 
That's how he travelled. 
D: 
So, then, he went to Mount Harris after, after the massacre? 
A: 
Yes, yes. 
D: 
How did he, how did he decide on Mount Harris? 
How did that work? 
A: 
Well, the people tell, you know, there was a different coal mines, 
different places. 
And he'd [one word unclear], they'd jump the freight trains 
and they'd go. 
F 
J: 
They'd find out if a mine was opening up and were going to do hiring that 
there. 
Whether it was in Helper, Utah, or down in New Mexico, or. 
And they'd 
hop a freight in those days and go to wherever that area was and look for 
work. 
A: 
When they got hungry they'd jump off of the train. 
He had a partner and 
they'd go fishing, catch fish and they'd cook, cook it. 
They'd start a fire. 
[J: 
laughs] 
They'd eat a lot of wild game: 
rabbits, you know, wild 
chickens. 
He said they'd always take salt with 'em. 
[John and Albina laugh] 
Oh, he, I don't know, he seemed to enjoy that type of life, but it was a rough 
life. 
D: 
Well, now, how did you and he first meet? 
Do you remember your first 
meeting? 
A: 
He was one of my mother's boarders. 
(D: 
Uh-huh.) 
I met him when I 
was 
twelve years old. 
See, ah, I was living in Newcastle, Colorado, with a 
brother of mine and his wife, going to school. 
My parents were in Mount 
Harris. 
Then, mother needed help in the boarding house so she sent for my 
sister and my, and her husband, and my brother and his wife. 
And I, I have to 
got with them. 
And then we went over there to help cook. 
And at that time I 
even got to ride the stagecoach from, let me see if I can remember the name, 
from Walcott, Walcott, I can't remember the name of the other one now. 
J: 
Well, was that up behind Walcott, up behind Steamboat Springs? 
A: 
Yes. 
We 
J: 
Well, you mean the name of the town? 
A: 
One was Walcott and I can't remember the name of the other one. 
It's 
terrible when you forget. 
J: 
Yeah. 
Well, that was, you didn't come into Hayden or Craig that way? 
You 
didn't come in by Hayden. 
A: 
No, no, we went to Mount Harris. 
J: 
Yeah, but I mean, you came in from Steamboat Springs side? 
A: 
Yeah. 
J: 
Yeah. 
A: 
I [several words unclear]. 
J: 
Well. 
So, you got to ride the stagecoach, huh? 
A: 
Yeah. 
[Doug and David laugh] 
That was another experience. 
D: 
Yeah. 
So, ah, let's see. 
So your husband first came in and he was a 
boarder. 
Did he, did he start the farm before you got married or? 
A: 
No, no, he, he ah, he stayed there, oh, I don't know, he stayed quite a 
while mining coal. 
Then, he, he felt like he wanted to leave again. 
This was 
when he was my boarder with my mother. 
He left and ah he went travelling. 
He 
joined the, a circus. 
D: 
Really? 
A: 
Was it the Barnum and Bailey Circus? 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
As a wrestler. 
(D: 
Really?) 
(T: 
laughs) 
Anybody could stay up with him ten minutes would win 
so much money, you know. 
He travelled with the circus for three years (D: 
I'll be darned.) 
wrestling. 
D: 
So, he just hooked up with them when they, when they came through town? 
A: 
[noise obscures several words] and he'd quit again, and that's when he 
came back to Colorado, to the coal mines. 
T: 
How big a man was he? 
Perhaps you, you told Doug this, but how tall was 
he and how much did he weigh? 
A: 
'Bout six-two, he weighed two hundred and eleven. 
(T: 
Mmhmm.) 
J: 
But he was as hard as a rock. 
A: 
He wasn't, he wasn't fat, you know. 
He was just a 
J: 
He was just raw muscle from them years of hard work, you know. 
A: 
And he had the biggest feet and the biggest hands I ever saw. 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
J: 
That's an interesting story about how he became a rassler in the circus, 
ah. 
When he was a young man, ah, he would go to the YMCA and he liked to, you 
know, work out at the YMCA and out there. 
And, ah, they went to this circus 
that came to this mining camp and they had a professional rassler there that 
was challenging all comers. 
You know, you come in the ring and if you stay 
ten minutes you win a hundred bucks or whatever. 
And, ah, my dad was much 
larger than most of the Italian miners, and they were all kidding him, you 
know: 
"Jumbo, why don't you go in the ring with this guy" and that. 
And my 
dad he was bashful and didn't want to. 
And they kept egging him on, so 
finally he went in the ring with the guy and I guess the guy ah started to get 
pretty dirty with him and he got mad and what he did, he picked him up and 
slammed him down and broke a collarbone and broke all his ribs and a few 
things like that and put the guy out of commission. 
(T: 
Huh.) 
So, the next 
day the guy that owned the circus got an interpreter and they come down to the 
coal mines and they were looking for my old man and he thought they were 
coming with the sheriff to put him in jail and he run and hid in the mine 
because he, he thought they were coming to get him because he, he hurt the 
rassler 
And the guy told him, "No," he said, "we want you to take his place 
'til he gets out of the hospital." 
And my dad said, "Well, I never rassled." 
[two or three words unclear] "No," he said, "you're doing fine," you know. 
(T: 
laughs) 
So, then, my uncles and other old miners told him, "You know you 
can be famous, you know, you travel all over the United States. 
You'll make 
lots of money." 
And, you know. 
And they talked him into it and ah he spent 
three years ah travelling, ah, I guess, all over the country, ah, rassling 
with the circus. 
And, he made me laugh, he said that's where he learned all 
/0 
of his bad habits. 
Learned to smoke and drink and all that kind of stuff. 
But he said his trainer used to stop him from smoking. 
And he said he'd get 
some kids to try to sneak him a cigarette, you know, and he'd give 'em money 
to try to sneak him cigarettes. 
But, he was what, three years Ma? 
He ah 
A: 
Yeah, he was with the circus three years. 
J: 
I think he told that one guy in three years, some big wrestling guy, I 
think, stayed with him. 
But, other than that. 
And then he came up, he came 
back to Mount Harris, wasn't it? 
A: 
Yeah, and went back to the mines. 
J: 
Yeah, went back to the mines. 
D: 
So, did he come back to, to the mines or did he come back for you? 
A: 
I don't know. 
That's when we got together, after he come back. 
[laughs] 
He probably had it in the back of his mind. 
He sent me a card and a picture 
when, when he went away. 
One of these place, you know, where you dress up. 
He dressed up like a cowboy and got a picture taken for me. 
J: 
Oh, I remember that picture, yeah. 
With the chaps, (A: 
Ah-huh.) 
and the 
cowboy hat and the neckerchief, yeah, yeah. 
A: 
He sent me one of those pictures. 
T: 
Did he have a stage name as a wrestler? 
A: 
No, they just called him "Jumbo." 
J: 
I, I, I don't know. 
But, he said, when they come down to the mine the 
next day to get him he got scared, he was, went and hid, he thought they were 
going to put him in jail 'cause he injured the rassler in the circus and he 
said, no, that they just wanted him to take the guy's place until he got out 
of the hospital [laughs]. 
D: 
That's a great story. 
A: 
He done, he done just about anything you could think of. 
D: 
Sounds like he didn't have any fear at all. 
A: 
He didn't. 
D: 
From the time he was a kid hanging from the ropes 
J: 
Yeah, in the marble quarry. 
A: 
Yeah, he worked in a marble quarry. 
That's why he came to America. 
His 
dad went to see up there where he was working and you have to swing from one 
mount [?] to another, you know, on a rope. 
And, he said, his father saw him 
do that and he fainted. 
And his father got, and he told him, he said, "God, 
before you kill yourself," he said, "you go back to America." 
He said, "I'll 
iI 
pay your fare." 
D: 
What did his father do? 
A: 
He was a mason. 
Is that what you call 'em? 
J: 
Stone mason, yeah. 
A: 
Stone mason. 
J: 
And he had some land up there. 
He had, ah, some timber on it and some 
trees up there I guess. 
A: 
Yeah, see, in, ah, they had a lot of land, but they don't all have it in 
one piece. 
Maybe a few acres here and you travel a few miles and they got 
another little piece of land. 
It's strange how they have land back there. 
It's not all in one place. 
D: 
Well, now, so you, you, when he came back, when your husband came back 
from the circus that it when you first going with him? 
A: 
Ah-huh. 
D: 
And how long was it before you 
A: 
Oh, he asked me to marry him, I told him he had to wait 'til I was 
eighteen. 
That would have been three more years. 
We went together eight 
months and that was [three or four words unclear]. 
J: 
You were, what? 
Sixteen? 
A: 
Fifteen. 
(J: 
Fifteen.) 
Fifteen. 
[J: 
laughs] 
D: 
What did your parents think of that? 
A: 
Oh, my dad didn't, my dad didn't approve of it. 
But he was a fair, honest 
person, my dad was. 
He got a hold of me and he said, "Now, look," 
he said, 
"you don't even know how to boil water." 
[several laugh] 
He even told him 
that. 
He said, "she's just a kid," he said, "she doesn't even know how to 
boil water." 
And ah, and he told me, he said that, "I won't stop you," he 
said, "if you want to get married," he said, "I'm not going to stop you. 
But," he said, "I'm telling you you're making a mistake." 
He said, "You're 
too young." 
But, ah 
D: 
Well, seems like the marriage held together pretty good. 
[Doug and David 
laugh] 
A: 
We were together sixty-four years. 
J: 
Yeah, that's a little bit of time. 
D: 
Now, so your, did your family speak Italian in the home? 
(A: 
Mmhmm.) 
And all the food that your mother cooked and all 
/L 
A: 
Yes. 
And she also raised a big garden and never bought any vegetables at 
all. 
D: 
Where did she get the ingredients she used for cooking? 
A: 
We had those, we had those stores, grocery stores. 
Do you mean at the 
boarding house or at home? 
D: 
[one or two words unclear] 
A: 
Well, ah, we had grocery stores. 
D: 
Oh, ah, I'm sorry 
J: 
Well, down in, well, you had what? 
One or two stores there in Mount 
Harris? 
Most of the stuff was home-grown, wasn't it Ma? 
D: 
Where did she get the pasta and the 
A: 
Oh, they stored [?] it from Denver. 
(D: 
Really?) 
Uh-huh. 
Put in a big 
order and ship it from Denver. 
[A: 
coughs] 
J: 
That was the flour, wasn't it? 
A: 
And the macaroni. 
Used to buy macaroni in twenty-five pound boxes. 
J: 
Ah, 'cause I know you, she used to, and you used to make home-made 
A: 
Yeah, my mother used to make her own bread. 
She used to knead a hundred 
pounds of flour at a time. 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
My dad built her an outdoor oven. 
Did 
you ever see one of them? 
J: 
Out in the back yards. 
T: 
What did you call those? 
A: 
An Italian forno. 
(T: 
Ah-huh.) 
J: 
Italian furnace, yeah, yeah. 
A: 
And, ah, he built a beautiful oven. 
And ah then he built her also a big 
box thing to knead her bread in 'cause she didn't have nothing big enough. 
D: 
What did he make the oven, what did he build the oven out of? 
A: 
Out of bricks. 
D: 
Out of bricks? 
(A: 
Ah-huh.) 
Out of brick? 
But what kind of a shape was 
it? 
A: 
Ah, just, like one of these Indian huts. 
It was round. 
J: 
Yeah, it was, you know, round on top. 
/3 
A: 
And, ah, my mother got to be a good expert at it. 
She built a fire out of 
wood. 
And she knew just how long to keep that fire going. 
Then she'd rake 
the hot, she used to put wood in there, not coal. 
She'd rake all the hot 
coals out and then she'd wash it with a mop. 
And she'd put her hand in there 
and she could tell if it was the right temperature, just by putting her hand 
in. 
And then she'd, she'd knead this bread and she'd make it into big loaves. 
Small loaves, but they'd raise. 
Big, round loaves. 
And then she'd, she had 
a, dad made her a big paddle, and she used to put the loaf of bread on there 
and push it right back in the oven. 
She baked the nicest bread. 
T: 
So, the oven was heated inside? 
A: 
Uh-huh. 
And the way she'd test it, she'd put her hand in it and she knew 
whether it was just the right temperature or not. 
T: 
So, were you saying all the coals were removed? 
A: 
Yes, she'd rake them all out and then she'd wash it with a mop. 
She used 
to have a mop. 
She'd wash all the (J: 
The floor.) 
the floor with it. 
J: 
I guess that, just the, just the heat from the bricks which would 
A: 
And then she'd bake just the nicest bread. 
You could smell it. 
Smelled 
so good [three or four words unclear]. 
D: 
Was she unusual in having an outdoor oven like that? 
Did the other 
Italian families built ovens build ovens similar to that or 
A: 
Some of them, but I think my mother had the nicest one. 
(D: 
Ah-huh.) 
I 
don't remember too many of them. 
They used to cook them in a stove. 
D: 
Was that something that, that, that, you, did your father build that when 
you were living in Newcastle, or was that when she had the boarding house? 
A: 
No, that's in Newcastle. 
They owned their own home. 
D: 
What did she do when she had the boarding house? 
A: 
Oh, she, they bought bread then. 
She didn't have time to bake it. 
She 
had to cook three meals a day. 
Thirty-three boarders. 
D: 
What about, what about other ah ingredients that she would use for food, 
like, like the herbs. 
Did she have an herb garden, or spices like that? 
A: 
Yes, she always had her herb garden, always. 
Yes, she always. 
And she 
used to make her own tomato paste. 
Now, this is something I don't think you'd 
ever hear. 
She used to make all tomato paste and Dad used to build a platform, 
up on some high stills. 
And she'd spread it all out on that and dry it in the 
sun. 
D: 
So she'd would make 
A: 
She'd cook her tomatoes, you know, strain them and cook them until a 
certain degree and go out and spread them on this board and dry it in the sun. 
/4 
And then every once in a while she'd go out there and turn it. 
And then when 
it was about, and then when it was about ready she'd put a layer of that, 
she'd get a big crock. 
She'd put a layer of that paste in there and a layer 
of sweet basil leaves and olive oil. 
And she'd do that 'tit she filled the 
crock. 
D: 
And then she'd be set through the year? 
A: 
Uh-huh, and we'd use that for making our spaghetti sauce. 
D: 
I bet that was good. 
A: 
Oh, they worked hard in those days. 
Yeah, she did all her own cooking. 
D: 
So, then you were fifteen years old when you got married? 
A: 
See, girls were scarce. 
There weren't many girls around then. 
D: 
And, and, how did you learn to cook then, if you, if you didn't even know 
how to boil water when you got married? 
(J: 
[laughs]) 
A: 
Oh, my mother, she used to, I used to get mad at her. 
This is terrible. 
I had to, first of all, you know, we lived with her and my brother. 
And ah 
she used to get up and set lunches for my brother, 'cause he worked in the 
coal mines. 
My mother'd get me out of bed five-thirty in the morning to watch 
my [two or three words unclear) lunch so I'd learn how to set a lunch. 
She 
made me cook when I was home. 
She taught me how to cook. 
D: 
So, then, after you got married he began homesteading. 
(A: 
Mm-hmm.) 
And 
John was telling me yesterday that, that, that you had trouble with the Klu 
Klux Klan? 
A: 
Oh, yeah, they were bad back then in Colorado at the time. 
They burnt a 
cross up there, nearby. 
Yeah, they were pretty bad at that time. 
They had in 
it for the Catholics, you know, and the Italians. 
I don't know, maybe all 
foreigners, I don't know. 
But there there were mostly Italians. 
D: 
Was that, how soon was that after he began homesteading that that took 
place? 
A: 
Oh, I don't know, maybe two, three years. 
D: 
Did you have any warning that it was going to happen? 
A: 
No. 
D: 
Just came out of the blue? 
A: 
No, no, they finally got, got rid of them, the Klu Klux Klan. 
D: 
That must have been real scary. 
A: 
It's no fun. 
J: 
I guess some of them guys, I guess including the old man from what the 
stories I've heard. 
They, everybody had rifles. 
They lived on deer meat and 
buckskin and elk and that. 
And so, ah, they'd go out and shoot at them, you 
know. 
And I guess they, I guess the word was out they was going to drive 
everybody out of Wolf Creek, Colorado. 
They were going to drive all the 
foreigners out, all the Italians, all the Catholics. 
And purify the land, I 
guess, you know. 
And, so, a lot of these guys they, they'd just wouldn't 
move, they'd shoot at them, you know. 
So, I guess they started to back off a 
little. 
T: 
So, was anyone actually hurt during this period? 
A: 
No, no there wasn't, not that I can recall. 
J: 
Pop told me, though, he said that he knew who most of them were. 
Because, 
he said that even though they wore a white sheet and they tried to hide 
themselves, but, he said, most of them were like the business guys down in 
Mount Harris. 
A: 
One I think was the postmaster. 
J: 
Yeah, he said they were all like the business people in town (A: 
In 
town.) 
and he said, and ah they had their secret meetings and that. 
But Pop 
said he knew who they all were. 
A: 
Yeah, one of them I think was the postmaster. 
D: 
That must have been really, I mean, there, there, these were people they 
would then have dealings with. 
A: 
Yeah, the people you'd deal with in town. 
D: 
How did they treat you when 
A: 
Oh, they'd treat us fine when we went to the, you know. 
And one, I think 
his name was Dahl [sp?], he was the manager of the company store. 
(J: 
Uh-
huh.) 
See, the stores at that time were all owned by the company. 
There was 
no place else you could shop. 
You had to go first to shop there. 
And I think 
he was another one. 
For some reason they didn't like Catholics and Italians. 
J: 
Well, as it turned out, history shows that they didn't anybody. 
[laughs] 
D: 
Well, how did you feel as a young wife having to face all this? 
A: 
I was scared. 
So, I was always kind of scared. 
But he'd always tell me 
that, not to be afraid. 
He said I 
was scared of my own shadow. 
[laughs] 
D: 
How long did that go on? 
A: 
Not, not too long. 
They tried it a couple of times but they ran them out. 
The people didn't, you know, they didn't scare so easy. 
D: 
Well, when you say "they ran them out" who, who 
/6 
A: 
Well, people that lived in the community. 
D: 
Like? 
A: 
The farmers and, they ran them out. 
They didn't stick around. 
D: 
So, about what year would that have been? 
A: 
Well, let's see, we married in 1920. 
Could have been '23, 
'24. 
D: 
Now when was it, what, what year was it when you left Colorado? 
A: 
We, we came out here in 1928. 
D: 
So you were there, you had the homestead there for 
A: 
About nine years I think. 
I think that's what it was. 
D: 
What, what was it that made you finally decide to get out? 
A: 
Well, the mines all shut down, see. 
They started using oil. 
They shut 
down all the coal mines. 
And all those thousands of people left out of work. 
'Cause that's, that's what they all did: 
worked in the coals mines. 
And 
everybody lost jobs. 
And we didn't know what to do. 
I remember he wanted to 
go to Detroit to work for Ford Motor Company. 
Mm-hmm, he said "go back 
there." 
He said, "I'm sure I'll find work." 
D: 
Did he, was there, did he have any family connections or anything in 
Detroit? 
A: 
No, he ah, I tell you he took, he went, he wasn't afraid of nothing. 
And 
I told him I didn't want to go to Detroit because remember my father said when 
he 
[IAW-DD-R003 ends at this point and interview continues on IAW-DD-R004] 
[While the tape is being changed, Mrs. Royal begins to talk about moving to 
San Pedro, California.] 
A: 
I had a niece staying with me and she had boy friend. 
And she was going 
to Banning [sp?] High School in Wilmington and she met a boy friend and they 
became friends. 
And he used to come here to see her and he told my husband, 
he says, "You want to go longshoring?" 
We had no idea what longshoring was. 
That was something new to us. 
He said, "I longshore on weekends so I can go 
to school during the week." 
He said, "So, you be ready," he said, "I'll come 
and get you Saturday morning and I'll show you how to longshore." 
They used 
to go down on the docks and they'd walk on the docks where the ships were. 
And if they needed men they'd hire them right off the dock. 
That's where they 
got their work. 
Wasn't that something? 
(D: 
Yeah.) 
Yeah, they used to walk 
along where the ships were and if they needed men, and you looked like a good. 
They'd look at your hands so see if you had callouses. 
That something? 
And 
he had these great, big rough hands. 
So, he got hired and he began working. 
They called it "extra." 
You know, whenever they needed extra help. 
And ah 
then he got on steady. 
They liked the way he worked. 
He was a good worker. 
/7 
D: 
What was the difference between being extra and being steady? 
A: 
Oh, steady people got to go. 
They had regular hours. 
But that was, that 
was afterwards. 
When he started longshoring they didn't have regular hours. 
They worked the men from sixteen to twenty-four hours a day without sending 
them home. 
Talk about slavery. 
And I'll never forget, it used to rain, you 
know, pour rain. 
They'd always have to have their rain gear with them and 
they'd make them work in that rain. 
They couldn't come home until they 
finished that ship. 
That's before they organized. 
They talk bad about the 
unions but I'll tell you, there's nothing better. 
And ah finally they got 
tired of it. 
They worked all, they had to work 'til they finished that ship. 
So they decided to strike and they did and they won. 
D: 
Who, who started, who, was there any one in particular that 
A: 
Well, Harry Bridges was the leader. 
D: 
He was up out of San Francisco? 
A: 
He was in San Francisco, but I guess he'd tell them what to do. 
and they, 
the men all down here. 
Now, my husband was Italian, they got him to go talk 
•t•e Italian to all the Italian longshoremen and tell them not to go to work. 
/ And then they got a Slav to tell all the Slays, you know, not to go to work. 
I don't know how they got them to stay out but a lot of them still wanted to 
go to work because they said they had kids to feed. 
Well, we had four. 
My 
husband would tell them, "I got four home." 
He said, "You're not going to 
starve for a couple of weeks." 
No, God, they had a terrible strike here in 
'33 and '34. 
D: 
So, was your husband one of the first people that Bridges contacted when 
he came here? 
How did that work? 
A: 
Ah, he was one of the first ones, I think, to get, yes. 
D: 
Did Bridges call a meeting or anything like that? 
A: 
Yes, they had meetings. 
And then my husband got a few of the other 
Italians, you know. 
He'd talk to them. 
And the Slays got their men. 
And 
they finally decided to quit working. 
But it was sure hard to hold them 
though. 
They wanted to work so bad. 
And they told them, they said, "Well, if 
you just hold out so many more days, we've got it." 
And, ah, they listened to 
them and they did. 
They won. 
They won regular hours. 
See, they fought for 
eight hours a day and for better conditions, better wages. 
And they won. 
And 
they got the waterfront on wonderful conditions. 
They got good wages, good 
hours, everything. 
But the young generation is running everything right down. 
They're just ruining it. 
Ah, they don't care. 
Well, they, you know what they. 
do? 
They work a couple of hours and they take off and go, go out and drink or 
go dancing and then then come back and go to work again. 
They're ruining 
everything the old timers done for them, they're ruining it. 
You can explain 
to them what the, you know, when Dad fought during the strike how to get good 
conditions. 
J: 
Oh, yeah. 
Well, they fought for a ten hour day, then an eight hour day. 
18 
And I was telling Doug the other day, yesterday, that when I was a kid you'd 
give me a lunch to bring to Dad over in the ships across the bay. 
Take the 
ferry over there and find what ship he was working on and bring him something 
to eat because in those days when you were hired off the docks you worked 
until the cargo was off and the ship was loaded and if you couldn't hold up 
you never got picked the next morning off the dock. 
And if you had to go to 
the bathroom or the toilet and you you were gone a minute too long, I mean, 
they'd tell you you were fired, you know. 
(A: 
Oh, they, they treated) 
But, 
ah, it took them years and years to get conditions for the men ah not only 
working conditions, hours and decent pay and. 
Important thing, I guess, well 
both of them, pay and working conditions, 'cause they worked like animals. 
But ah then over the years they got ah good conditions, good pension plan, 
welfare plan, benefits and things of that nature. 
Paid vacations and certain 
holidays. 
And ah it worked out real good. 
And ah I thin what Mom was talking 
about was when I came back in the room was that ah when the war came on I 
guess there was a manpower shortage and a lot of people migrated from the 
south up here to work in the shipyard, you know. 
And ah a lot of them came 
over, came into the longshoremen's union because of the fact that a lot of the 
guys were in the services. 
And a lot of the longshoremen went into the 
CeeBees and into the Army Crops of Engineers and things of that nature. 
And 
at that time I think that ah the employers were getting like for every dollar 
they spent for wages they was getting like a dollar ten cents, I don't know 
what it was, from the, ah, it wasn't, it wasn't a war manpowers commission, 
but it was something. 
So, at that time and, I guess, the same took place in 
the shipyards in that the bosses or the companies didn't really care whether 
the guys worked hard or sloughed off because, see, they were getting paid some 
assistance in subsidy, I guess, from the government. 
So, a practice set in 
and ah so when the war ended it was difficult to break this practice where a 
guys would ah you know, work a while and go goof off and that. 
And they've 
been trying to break it since and ah I think the only thing that stopped them 
from doing away with that practice and ah is in 1948 ah Harry Bridges 
negotiated what they call an automation and mechanization agreement with the 
Pacific Coast Maritime Association where they ah went into containers and went 
into ah heavy cranes and all automated work. 
And there was a big division 
within the ranks of the union at that time because a lot of them felt they 
were going to lose all their work and, and things of that nature. 
But the way 
he worked it out was ah that ah, it would be, I guess, by natural attrition, 
it wouldn't be no lay-off, you know. 
And as it turned out ah the cargo 
capacity, the handling of cargo increased, oh, I don't know, six, seven 
hundred per cent. 
For example, you take a steamer, a freighter that would go 
from here to the Hawaiian Islands. 
It'd come in from Hawaiian Islands loaded 
up and it's take five days and nights to unload her with five gangs and one 
gang in each hatch. 
That's during the day. 
Then the night gangs. 
Five days 
and nights to unload her and then reload her and send her back to sea. 
And 
then with automation and mechanization, with the huge cranes and these huge 
containers and that, they'll take that same freighter today and they'll turn 
that around probably in 36 to 40 hours time. 
So, ah, the work force, ah 
required work hours really came down, but in the trade-offs they got better 
conditions and ah they got certain incentives and compensation for it. 
But I 
think the reason why the Pacific Maritime Association has tolerated it all 
these years is because they, they was making so god damned much money on this 
tremendous influx of the handling of the cargo and that there that they sort 
of, I guess, closed their eyes to the practice. 
And ah they're clamping down 
now more and more each year. 
They're really clamping down and they're really 
/5 
putting the heat on the guys and they're trying to get them to toe the mark 
because ah, it was getting, you know, pretty much out of hand. 
A: 
Too bad he's not here to tell them about the strike. 
[laughs] 
J: 
Yeah, I was telling them about it. 
A: 
They had that big. 
Did you tell them about the strike? 
J: 
Little bit about it yesterday. 
D: 
Yeah, but I'd like to here what you've got to tell about it. 
A: 
Yeah, they put up a big, they called it the bull pen. 
Big circus tent, I 
guess, over on Terminal Island. 
To house all the strikers. 
And, the 
longshoreman, they didn't know how to do to get over there, you know. 
But, 
ah, they got, they got some cars, not street cars 
J: 
That was in Wilmington, one forty-five, where they had the bull pen. 
A: 
Was that were it was? 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
A: 
I thought it was Terminal Island. 
J: 
Well, they had scabs living in, in a camp on Terminal Island, too, but the 
bull pen they raided was in one forty-five in Wilmington there, right, right 
D: 
So, the bull pen was where the scabs were? 
J. 
Yeah. 
A: 
Mm-hmm. 
And they had Chinese cooks for them and everything. 
But the 
longshoremen finally got ahold of the tent and set fire to it. 
And they 
raided all that, and that was a regular war. 
There was men killed then. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
And 
D: 
Could you tell us. 
John was mentioning that there was at least one 
meeting that was held in the wine cellar in your house. 
Is that right? 
A: 
I don't remember. 
J: 
When I come from Burton Hill that afternoon and I went down the cellar it 
was the day, the night they hit the bull pen. 
A: 
He always had several men here, you know. 
And they'd go down there and 
talk and I, I didn't [two words unclear], but I guess that's what they did. 
D: 
That was sort of to keep, keep, keep out of sight when they made the 
plans? 
A: 
Well, I'll tell you, they really had a battle. 
They. 
Five o'clock that 
next morning, we were living down on Mesa Street, policeman came to my house, 
our house, and he knocked on the front door. 
And I didn't know what, well, my 
z• 
husband was out all night. 
Well, I'll tell you because it's over with now. 
And, he said, "Anyone comes to get me, tell them I was here all night." 
So, I 
said, "okay." 
And, sure enough, they came five in the morning. 
And they 
said, "Where's your husband?" 
And, I said, "In bed." 
He was in bed. 
They 
said, "Was he all night?" 
And, I said, "Yes, he was." 
[laughs] 
They sent, 
there were three policemen, one at each door. 
I told them, "He's not a 
murderer." 
I said, "What are you doing?" 
I got mad. 
They put a 
We had 
three doors, one out, and they put a policeman at each door. 
And, ah, he 
said, "Open the door and let me in." 
I said, "Well, wait until I get myself a 
robe," you know, I got up in my gown. 
I said, "Let me get me a robe." 
And I 
let him in and he went in and grabbed my husband and jerked him out of bed, 
took him to jail and for 72 hours we had no idea where he was. 
I didn't know 
what they did with him or where he was or anything. 
They had taken him off to 
Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles. 
But I didn't know. 
They I sat with the 
kids scared to death, didn't know what they did with him. 
It was awful. 
T: 
So, how did you find out finally after 72 hours? 
A: 
Well, after 72 hours they couldn't get nothing on him, see, they couldn't 
prove nothing, had to turn him loose. 
So, he came home. 
But that was a scary 
experience. 
D: 
What did, what did he tell you about his experiences when they brought him 
to the jail. 
A: 
You know what he said they did to him up there to make him talk? 
They 
used sand bags, you know, to beat him. 
To make him confess. 
So they won't 
bruise their bodies. 
They used sand bags. 
And they beat them with sand bags. 
J: 
I guess like a black jack filled with sand, see. 
A: 
But it didn't bruise them. 
That's, that's what they used on them. 
And 
they couldn't prove nothing on him. 
So they had to let him go after 72 hours. 
D: 
What do you remember, ah, the wives of the strikers? 
(A: 
The what?) 
You 
and the other wives of the strikers. 
What were you doing while the strike was 
going on? 
A: 
Staying home. 
Taking care of the kids. 
D: 
Did you have any contact with the other wives? 
A: 
Not very much. 
Well, mostly all of us stayed close to home, most of us. 
They had the kids. 
You know, we were all scared. 
D: 
[one or two words unclear] the, the union supply [three or four words 
unclear] 
A: 
They did for a while. 
Yes, supplied with us with food. 
And they also had 
what they called. 
What did they call the kitchen? 
J: 
The soup kitchens. 
ZI 
A: 
Yeah, the soup kitchen, ah-huh. 
Yeah, and they gave us food. 
J: 
A lot of that, the stores at that time were mainly mom-and-poppa stores, 
neighborhood, you know. 
And they knew everybody and they were poor people, 
too. 
And as much as they could they extended credit to these strikers, I 
guess, until they (A: 
Yes.). 
Some made it, some went broke, but ah, but 
happy to say that when the strike was over they paid back all these people 
every dime of it, you know. 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
But ah, a little bit, they got credit 
from some of the people and then, too, they got a lot of donations. 
I mean 
the truck farmers would give them vegetables. 
The fishermen would give them 
fish. 
And like I told then, one guy, Erickson, had a fish boat and that, and 
these guys would go on his fish boat. 
A: 
And they went on Catalina. 
J: 
Went to ah, to Santa Rosa Island and ah, they, ah, they would kill 30, 25 
or 30 head of sheep, or goats, you know, and skin them and put them on the 
fish hatch and bring them back. 
And then at night time, down at the old First 
Street ferry where the car ferry was. 
Remember pop had that '26 Chrysler with 
that big wooden trailer? 
(A: 
Yeah. 
[laughs]) 
And, when the ferry stopped 
running at midnight, then ah he'd back that trailer down there and then they'd 
put the goat and sheep carcasses in the trailer and then they'd put a 
tarpaulin over it and then they'd take it up to the soup kitchen on 7th Street 
there by the A-1 Grocery Store there, now where the roller skating rink came 
later. 
(A: 
Ah-huh.) 
And ah at that time there was longshoremen and seamen 
in the strike. 
So, the single men, they would eat in the soup kitchens, then 
they'd go do their picket duty, you know. 
And the married men they'd do 
picket duty but ah, and ah whatever else they had to do. 
And ah and then 
they'd give them some vegetables and a fish or piece of meat and stuff like 
that to bring home to their families, you know to help out. 
But, ah, but, ah, 
I remember they, ah, had a lot of sympathy in the community and a lot of 
support. 
And, ah, and one thing they prided themselves on when that strike 
was over and I guess the union saw, too, that everybody that extended credit 
to them they, they paid them, paid them back when it was all over. 
Which was 
the right thing to do, you know. 
Yeah. 
A: 
Well, there was no fun. 
They said it was just like the war that they held 
in France. 
During World War Two was it? 
Or first world war. 
When they were 
fighting the scabs. 
J: 
Oh, well what happened, see, they, ah, they had what they call the red 
cars, street cars. 
They took them down, but they used to come down at the 
foot of 5th Street there in San Pedro on the waterfront. 
And they would go to 
L.A. and go all over. 
Well, what happened, the employers would load up them 
red cars with scabs up in L.A. and they'd recruit people from all over. Some 
knew that there was a strike, some didn't. 
And they'd say, "You want to go to 
work?" 
And they'd put them in these red cars and they'd bring them down from 
L.A. and they'd ah put them in these bull pens. 
House them there and feed 
them, and then under escort they'd take them to the ship and they'd work the 
ship. 
And in the night they'd bring them back and, and escorted them there. 
Kept guards around with search lights to protect them. 
And then my dad and 
these guys would go out by Domingus [sp?] and that and they'd intercept these 
red cars, street cars coming down the tracks and they'd stone them and ah stop 
them and they'd beat hell out of the scabs and stuff like that to discourage 
them from hauling them in. 
And then this one night they decided that ah they, 
they  had to really do something, so they got together and they planned it. 
And they raided the bull pen at midnight. 
And ah they had a big fence around 
it and ah while they were tearing the fence down there was a young kid that 
lived across the alley from us, Dickie Parker. 
(A: 
Yeah.) 
I think he was 
only 16 or 17 and he was just starting in on the waterfront. 
So, my dad said 
that they were pulling these boards off this fence, trying to make a hole to 
go through and he said "Dick Parker fell down" and he thought he was overcome 
by tear gas. 
So he went over to pick him up but, you know, and help him up 
'cause he was just a kid. 
And he said he was having a hard time with pulling 
the boards off. 
So the old man said he went over and he was jerking the 
boards off to beat hell and then kid went down and he thought it was tear gas. 
And when he got to him he said the kid had been shot. 
(A: 
Detective shot 
him.) 
And he swore that Detective Hackie [sp?] ah was the one that shot him, 
you know. 
But they got inside there and they beat the holy hell out of the 
scabs. 
They set the tents on fire and they threw some of the Chinese cooks on 
top of the grills and they threw some in the bay and they cut the power lines 
and the firemen come with the fire hoses and they chopped the fire hoses. 
(A: 
They chopped the fire hoses.) 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
And ah and then when it was over 
they scattered and went home. 
And the five o'clock that next morning, well, 
it was still morning, that's when he come to the house. 
They had two or three 
big touring cars and they come around the house and surrounded it. 
They drove 
the old man out. 
But ah there was, there was cases at that time where ah when 
they was trying to organize the union that ah, you know, when Harry Bridges 
would come down from San Francisco to hold speeches. 
I can remember dad 
taking me with him. 
I was about 11 years old. 
They wouldn't, nobody would 
give them, rent them a hall to have meetings so they'd have meetings in an 
open field down there like by the old Salvation Home, Army Hotel there on 4th 
and Beacon, 5th and Beacon, them old sand hills there. 
And ah they'd pick up 
guys that were, they thought were [one word unclear] leaders and they put them 
in the touring cars and say they were taking them to jail. 
And I remember one 
time I was down there when Bridges was speaking. 
They had built a wooden 
platform. 
And I was there with my dad and all these striking longshoremen was 
off in the field when Bridges was talking. 
And ah a couple touring cars 
pulled up ah with these detectives in it and they got out and they went 
through the crowd and got up on the platform and they told Bridges and a 
couple of the speakers up there to come with them. 
And so the longshoremen I 
guess were going to rush them and these guys, you know, come out and they had, 
I think it was Thompson submachine guns. 
So they took them to jail and ah I 
guess the next day or two days later they released Harry Bridges and some of 
the guys. 
But one guy ah they never released him. 
They couldn't find him. 
And a week later they found him dead in a oil sump over here in the Domingus 
Hills between here and Long Beach. 
And the police contended that ah that they 
had nothing to do with it. 
That they, they had taken him to jail and kept him 
overnight and released him. 
But ah everybody thought at that time and still 
felt that, that actually they had probably killed him and dumped him, you 
know. 
But they would go around town and they ah, they would do everything 
they could to discourage ah the strikers and harass them and ah, and they were. 
pretty brutal about it, you know. 
A: 
Well, they were for a long time. 
They'd always, always, time they'd try 
to see my husband they'd always try some not to give him a ticket. 
J: 
Yeah. 
23 
D: 
Was it the Italian community that was, how, what was the bread-down as far 
as the longshoremen went? 
Was it mostly Italian? 
Was it, was there Yugoslays 
A: 
Oh, there was a lot of Slays 
J: 
Oh, well, there was a big mixture. 
You had guys that ah, a lot of the 
longshoremen then and to this day they're son are. 
They were, the biggest 
majority of them were seamen at one time. 
And the got tried going to sea and 
they start working on the beach. 
And you had a mix ethnic mixed-up. 
You had 
Finns, you had Russians, you had ah Norwegians, Swedes, Italians, ah, ah, a 
big conglomeration, you know. 
And ah, and so, ah, it wasn't, ah, there was in 
this port, I guess, well even in San Francisco, I guess it was probably a lot 
of Italians by, by virtue of the fact that there was a lot of them that lived 
in the community, you know. 
But I know that ah that my dad ah was more or 
less like ah in charge of ah taking care of the Italian longshoremen 
(A: 
Yeah.) to make sure that they held the line and, and didn't break the rules 
and things 
A: 
And they got a Slav to go talk to the Slays. 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
D: 
So, was the, were the longshoremen, were they, were they more ethnically 
diverse than say the fishermen were? 
J: 
Oh, I would, I would think so because ah, you know, the fish industry 
before World War Two had three ethnic groups primarily. 
You had ah Japanese-
Americans, the Yugoslays, and the Italians. 
The longshore industry ah guys 
who had went to sea and decided to get married and stay on the beach whatever, 
ah the seaman came from, you know, all over the world. 
And you had all sorts 
of ethnic groups. 
They was a lot of Finns, a lot of Scandinavians, you know, 
and some Russians and ah and, and other ethnic groups. 
And then, with the 
mixture of those who were already on the beach like the Italians. 
Ah, there 
wasn't many Yugoslays that were in the longshoremen early on, then later on 
when fishing got tough, a lot of them gave up fishing and started going on 
over into the longshoremen's union, you know. 
D: 
What about the church? 
Where did, where did the church come in on all 
this? 
Were they opposed to it? 
Did they help? 
A: 
I don't think they done much of anything. 
D: 
They just sort of stood to the side a lot? 
J: 
In the early days that, in that time I, maybe they played a hand in there, 
but I don't remember all that much about it. 
I know that the Catholic Church 
got pretty heavily involved ah in the fish industry, ah, you know, ah. 
A: 
Yeah, but not the longshoremen's union. 
J: 
No, not the longshore. 
But I know in the fish industry ah they, every 
time they wanted to build a new Catholic school or a church or something they, 
they, they'd ask and would literally demand that ah that the fishermen donate 
ah certain percentage of their catches to the church to raise money to build 
zy 
the church. 
And I had a hell of a fight with ah Monsignor Gallagher, no (A: 
Scott.) Monsignor Scott at that time because ah he wanted ah, I had just 
gotten elected the head of the union and he sent Father Rucker [sp?] down to 
me and he wanted me to sign a contract that ah, ah, he, he was getting an 
awful lot of donations and big money from the canners. 
And ah, and then he 
wanted ah boat owners and the fishermen and, and, the Italians were much more 
religious than the Slays were. 
The Slays let the women go to church but the 
Italians they went to church with their wives and kids. 
And then he wanted ah 
the boat owner and the working fisherman to donate a certain percentage of 
their catches to the church, too. 
And ah a lot of guys didn't like it. 
And I 
objected to it and he wanted me to sign a contract and ah, ah, and I refused 
to do it. 
So, he got mad as hell at me and we had, we had a parting of the 
ways and we had some bitter words and it went on for years. 
But ah, but ah 
they ah, he was a, now I don't say he spoke for the whole Catholic Church, but 
he was very clever and very ingenious and ah he played, he played the ethnic 
groups pretty good, one against the other. 
(A: 
And wasn't he ) And he would 
openly try to embarrass them in church on Sunday, you know. 
Ah and that used 
to get me mad, you know. 
But, here, you, you, you're a fisherman and you own 
homes and you own property and that, you know, and drive nice cars and all 
ti:at other old shit, but, he said, you can't support your church. 
Well, they 
wire supporting the church. 
But he wanted to have the richest church, I 
guess, in ah, in ah California. 
A: 
Well, they call Mary Star of the Sea the rich man's church. 
J: 
Yeah, but ah, but anyhow, ah, he did go on to build the new Mary Star of 
the Sea Church over there on 7th Street. 
I don't know if you've been there or 
not. 
It's got a, you know, the Mother mary's holding the fish boat. 
And I 
guess that Starkist Tuna, Don Locker [sp?], must have sent him to Rome about 
twelve times to pick out the marble and the gold ornaments and stuff like 
that. 
But ah, I got ah, I got crossways with him over the fact that ah the, 
the, wanted to put a contract that, you know, that ah the fishermen were going 
to give a certain percentage of their catches or their earnings to the church. 
And I told him, well, you know, I thought it should be on a volunteer basis. 
I mean if the guys want to, everybody's different. 
Everybody can afford more 
than the other guy or whatever, you know. 
Ah, but anyhow ah, they, they did 
ah, they did get the, little bit involved at that time with the, the ah the 
fish industry. 
And I suspect that then they still do although it's not so 
much. 
When we had the two unions. 
We had the Italian union and the Yugoslav 
union. 
And ah the Italians being more Catholic minded, I guess, than the 
Slays, and the canneries donating money to the church [clears throat], I think 
the church played a pretty heavy hand in, in pushing the Italian fishermen who 
were here as well as the ones that was coming over into the AFL-CIO union at 
that time. 
And as I told you yesterday, I felt then and up until lately that 
there's nothing left but it was always a company union in my book, you know. 
Because ah, ah it was ah, any gains that were made and any fights that was 
done and any strikes by the fishermen was always done by the union I represent. 
now, which was ironically predominately Yugoslavians. 
But ah, I felt very 
strong that the church played a, a not only behind the scenes but sometimes 
rather openly, ah, a heavy role in, in choosing sides. 
And ah and, you know, 
it's, it's strange, you know, the fishermen, they're working on a boat and at 
that time the boat [one or two words unclear] heavily mortgaged to the cannery 
that helped finance the boat, or co-signed with the bank or whatever. 
And he 
had to deliver his fish to the cannery and the cannery pretty much dictated 
2-1-
what they were going to pay for the fish and whether it was a fair price or 
not. 
And, like I told you, they stole on the weights until we put a union man 
on the scales and found out that the boats were being clipped for 15 to 25 
percent per load. 
So, the fishermen were caught in a hell of a bind 'cause ah 
here they worked on a boat that the, the owner of their boat or the owners 
were captivated victims by the canner and then on top of that ah, they, they 
had the fear of losing their jobs and at the same time you had the church 
maybe crowding on they're backs saying, you know, "If you don't ah, you're 
going to go to hell if you don't ah, you know, ah, cough up and ah. 
And it, 
it ah, I think it, you know, they'll naturally deny that today, but I think at 
that time there was, not so much anymore, but at that time there was, I think, 
quite a bit of evidence that the church was fairly involved there. 
And I 
think there was a selfish reason to it at that time because the canners and 
their wisdom of conquer and divide, I think used the church to a fare-the-
well by giving them huge donations and contributions to look like the good 
boys, you know. 
And then the church ah, I guess, tried to help them out in 
turn by telling the guys: 
"You should cooperate with the canners." 
D: 
Now, the church used to be down closer to the waterfront? 
J: 
Yeah, 9th, it was down on 9th and Center Street. 
D: 
Was it a matter, was it a case where they had out-grown that church? 
J: 
Ah, yeah, I guess, in a way. 
Not really, they had the old Holy Trinity 
Church over here where we went. 
Over here by Barton Hill School, now it's 
called St. Peter and Paul. 
But I think it probably was getting close to being 
out-grown and that. 
But ah I think there was still probably ah several years 
of ah use there. 
But ah Monsignor Scott, you know, wanted to build a new 
church and then also build a new Catholic elementary school and a Catholic 
high school and on and on and on, you know. 
A: 
They tore down that old church and it was a nice church. 
J: 
Yeah. 
D: 
Was there, how did the community feel about that? 
J: 
Ah, I think that ah, ah, the [telephone rings] the Catholics that went to 
that church down there, I think they felt real bad because they had a certain 
attachment to it. 
You know, ah, I remember when I 
was a kid, before we, I 
went over here at Holy Trinity, you used to go over there for your catechism 
lessons and so many kids were baptized in that church and then they made their 
communion there. 
[Mrs. Royal talks on telephone in background] And a lot of 
them got married there and their kids were baptized there. 
And to them that 
was the, that was a sacred place and it was the church. 
And then when they 
start talking about tearing it down, which they eventually did, I think ah 
just a hell of a lot of their parishioners were very unhappy about it and ah 
felt real bad about it, you know. 
And ah the new church is a beautiful 
church, you know, it's a, it's like a Taj Mahal compared to old Mary Star of 
the Sea. 
But ah, but, yeah, they ah, they, a lot of them felt real bad. 
They 
felt like they was destroying ah a way of life or something, you know. 
Yeah. 
T: 
How come nothing's been built on that lot? 
Z( 
J: 
I don't know. 
The church, ah, that, that thing has been vacant all these 
years and you see a bunch of wreaked cars and that there (T: 
Yeah.). 
I don't 
know why the church is holding onto that land. 
I don't know if they figure 
that, I don't know. 
People, a lot of people have wondered about that, you 
know. 
D: 
It still owns the land? 
(J: 
Huh?) 
The church still owns that? 
J: 
Yeah, to the best of my knowledge. 
And it's been vacant all these years, 
you know. 
A: 
And then what they done to our parish down here. 
We used to have Holy 
Trinity where we attended. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
Well, they built a new 
church up here now and they took the name of this church and gave it to the 
new church. 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
And so now this one they call St. Peter's Chapel. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
(D: 
Oh.) 
It used to be Holy Trinity. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
I don't like 
what they did. 
J: 
But this one's still ah, still there. 
It hasn't been tore down. 
A: 
No, it's still there. 
J: 
Yeah. 
D: 
I meant, I meant to ask you this yesterday, John, when we were talking 
about how the canneries financed the boats. 
How did that, when the canneries 
started going out of business, how, obviously they're not still financing 
people's boats. 
Well, what kind of transition was 
J: 
Well, they got out of financing boats some years ago, ah, you know, ah. 
What they did, ah, they probably in some cases co-signed ah at the bank, you 
know, for ah a boat owner or a group of guys that wanted to buy or build a 
boat. 
But about the time they started to make this ah exodus overseas to 
American Samoa, Puerto Rico, ah, Guam, and Thailand and Philippines and all 
over, ah, they had pretty well gotten out of ah, out of ah having money 
invested in boats. 
It, it's a long story. 
At one time they wanted to make 
sure that they got their share of tuna and sardines and other stuff, so they 
invested in a lot of boats so that them boats would be obligated to deliver to 
them. 
And that way they could ah have a continuous source of raw product to 
compete with the other canners. 
And then when they started getting, after 
World War Two, when they started getting an influx of cheap tuna from Japan, 
ah, freighters, refrigerated freighters would carry it, would come in from 
Japan loaded with frozen tuna and then they'd ah have to pay the longshoremen 
to unload them and it cost quite a bit of money for each day's demurrage 
[sp?], and that there. 
So they held the local boats up for the, the boats 
went off of Mexico and caught tuna. 
They'd keep them tied to the dock for 
four, five, six, seven, eight weeks at a time with refrigeration system going 
while they were unloading Jap tuna off the freighters. 
So then they wised up 
and they said, "Well, what the hell are we doing? 
We got our money tied up in 
these boats and these boats are just floating refrigeration plants. 
We don't 
need it. 
We'll buy Japanese tuna." 
So then they started to sell their 
interests in these boats out to the, the fishermen. 
And then, then they, they 
turned out that the boat owners then turned out to be ah owners of the boats 
22 
without any financial investment, involvement by the canners. 
And then ah 
when things got a little slow and then the Mediterranean countries opened up 
and that, that saved us for a great number of years because then the Japanese 
found that they ah found big markets in Italy where, Italy and Yugoslavia 
where they canned the tuna and shipped it up into Yugoslavia and Germany and 
places like that. 
So, ah, then it, then, then the Japanese started raising 
the price of tuna to the American buyers and ah then they got back into ah 
putting some of the money back into the boats again so they'd have the boats. 
But by the time that they made the big exodus, and the big move they were 
pretty much out of it. 
And the boats they did have money in ah they weren't 
[four or five words unclear] a lot of them boats were sold to, like South 
Korea, to Venezuela, to countries like that, see. 
So, ah, towards the end 
there some of them boats, you know, were worth millions of dollars. 
And, like 
I told you yesterday, a new tuna boat today that, being launched in San Diego 
or up in Tacoma, fifteen million bucks. 
But they carry fifteen hundred tons 
and they can stay at sea for six months at a whack and travel the whole oceans 
of the world. 
But a lot of guys took a beating, ah, see they, a lot of the 
guys they, they went into the big boats ah with ah assistance and commitments 
from the canners. 
When they pulled the rug on them, ah, a lot of these guys 
ah didn't have enough years in it to, to pull it off. 
And a lot of them took 
a very bad beating. 
T: 
Did they ever have the big super seiners here like they do in San Diego? 
J: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had them here, but, we at one time there was three 
hundred and fifteen tuna boats in San Diego and there was about a hundred and 
some boats here in San Pedro. 
But ah the seining started in San Pedro. 
In 
San Diego they were pole and line fishermen. 
They stand in a rack and they 
jack-pole the tuna aboard. 
One pole, two pole, three pole, four pole fish, 
you know. 
They'd chum them with live bait. 
And then in '57, ah, they ah 
found that ah the big boats were making two trips a year where the purse 
seiners were making five trips a year. 
So, they decided that they'd better 
change over. 
And they started hiring ah Yugoslav and Italian fishermen from 
San Pedro to come down to San Diego and teach them, the Portuguese and 
Italians down there, how to fish tuna with purse seine nets and that. 
And the 
guys here thought it was going to take them years and years to learn. 
Well, 
hell, in a couple of year's time the Portuguese and the Italians in San Diego 
adapted to purse seining real rapidly. 
As I was telling Doug yesterday, there 
were a lot of, timing was very important. 
A lot of things happened that made 
it better. 
They went from, ah, from ah cotton nets to nylon net. 
And the 
invention of the power block. 
And we went from ice boats to spray and brine 
system refrigeration. 
And ah from purse rope to purse cable. 
And ah, and so, 
ah, once that they learned the system they no longer needed the Yugoslays and 
the Italians from Pedro. 
[END OF IAW-DD-0004, INTERVIEW CONTINUED ON IAW-DD-0005] 
[sound of ceiling fan] 
T: 
I'm interested in hearing a little bit about how gear has changed here. 
I 
think you mentioned to Doug the other day about ah the use of the lampara 
here. 
J: 
Yeah. 
Z 1? 
T: 
What was that net like? 
Can you describe it? 
J: 
Well, ah, actually it ah the lampara. 
The Italians brought it over from 
the Mediterranean, you know. 
And it, it, it's a net that ah, that had like 
two long wings on it and a big bag. 
It had a throat and a bag. 
Like the 
wings were long and narrow and then it, where you got to the throat it 
thickened up and went deeper and deeper. 
And then at the end you had a big 
long bag. 
And they would set it around a school of fish and they would 
retrieve it from both ends. 
And then as the fish kept going towards the 
stern, the throat would come up underneath and then they'd get trapped in the 
bag back there. 
And when they got them up close enough, then they'd brail 
them up by hand. 
Then later they went on to what they called a half-ring. 
They put rings on the bottom with a rope in it and they'd, when they set 
around they'd close the net up on the bottom like a purse seiner, but it was a 
half-lampara half-ring. 
Then they went to full purse seiners and you've seen, 
I guess, seen demonstrations of how the purse seine works, the way they have 
these rings on the bottom of the nets and they have cable that goes through 
it. 
And after they circle a school of fish then the winches retrieve the, the 
steel cable from both ends under the, through the davits on the winches. 
And 
here you got the corks maybe as big as a football field around and they close 
it up in the bottom and then when all the rings are pulled together then they 
retrieve them up over the side of the boat and on the deck. 
And now the fish 
are trapped. 
Then they start retrieving and then ah, from one end until they 
get it, the fish up along side. 
And they bring them up. 
So, you had ah, you 
had the lampara net and you had, as far as net fishing was concerned, then the 
half-ring, and the purse seiner. 
D: 
[exact words are unclear, but Doug asks John is he can close the door in 
order to cut down on traffic noise] 
J: 
Alright. 
T: 
Well, the lampara was a obvious borrowing from, from the Mediterranean. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
Were there other aspects of fishing or crew structure or gear 
that seems to come directly from, from the old world? 
J: 
Well, I guess as far as the sardine and the anchovy fisheries and that 
there with the lampara nets, that's about the biggest thing, I guess, that 
they brought over with them. 
But as far as tuna was concerned, and they still 
do it to this day in the Mediterranean and Italy, they, they catch tuna 
primarily with traps. 
I don't know if you've seen pictures of that or 
documentaries. 
T: 
What were they like? 
Or what are they like? 
J: 
They build huge ah traps out of tuna net. 
And they wait for the, the, the . 
bluefin tuna to come in, I guess, through Gibraltar and in the Mediterranean. 
They wait all year and then when the season is. 
And then the tuna swim into 
these huge traps and they close them up. 
And then they got them trapped and 
then they start to close in on them and then they, ah, harpoon them or gaff 
them out of the, out of these traps. 
I mean, and they're, they're, I guess 
some of them are probably a mile long, you know. 
Big, huge traps made out of 
net. 
2-y 
T: 
Do they have leaders that go to the shore? 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
T: 
Is it, ah, square shaped with a bottom on it? 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
T: 
Was that anything that was ever used here? 
J: 
Ah, not, I think that ah they done a little bit in salmon fishing up 
north. 
They ah, they done, ah, I think, they, they that, they did some of 
that, but not, not all that much. 
T: 
Was there ever any type of cast netting here? 
J: 
Ah, well, no. 
You got, you had gill netting, you know, and you, you had 
the trammel or tramia [sp? 
pronounced: 
tram-EYE-uh] net, gill nets, drift 
nets. 
Ah, you know, things of that nature. 
But ah when you say cast netting, 
such as used in the islands and places like that? 
T: 
Shore, shore casting. 
J: 
Yeah. 
No, ah, I don't, it might have been, but I don't recall. 
Ah, if it 
was around I don't recall it, you know. 
A: 
When we first came here the fishermens were making good money weren't 
they? 
Course you were just a kid. 
J: 
Yeah. 
Well, I mean 
A: 
But the fish industry was good. 
J: 
Well, the prices were awful cheap, but they made it on volume, you know. 
T: 
Was there ever any trawling for bottom fish? 
(J: 
Ah.) 
Longline 
trawling? 
J: 
Yeah, they got, well, that's mainly up the coast. 
There's not so, there's 
some down here now, but ah not, not, not that much of it. 
But you go up 
around Santa Barbara and Ventura and up around Morro Bay and from there north, 
ah, you'll find ah mid-water trawlers, bottom trawlers, draggers, and ah there 
was even some guys up there that are, you know, doing that for shrimp. 
And, 
ah, but all of your petrali [sp?] sole and all of your bottom fishing, most of 
them guys, there's very few if any, I don't know of any draggers down here at 
all. 
Ah, the, the one thing you have done here, you, well, you have some 
longliners but you have the albacore trolleys. 
You know, that with the 
outriggers that troll for albacore in the summer months. 
But most of your 
midwater and your bottom trawlers ah and ah, and ah draggers and that were, 
there's a few around Ventura, Santa Barbara, and up around Morro Bay and Avila 
[sp?] and further north. 
And then up off of Oregon and Washington there's ah, 
ah an awful lot of it, you know. 
Q 
T: 
Now, in addition to the purse seiners and the gill netters out of San 
Pedro, are there any other types of gear that, that people use to fish out of 
here? 
J: 
Well, yes, they, you got, you know, the lobster fishermen and the pot 
fishermen, whether it be lobster or crab. 
And they went for ah what they call 
sable fish, you know, the, the, it's, I'm trying to think of the other name of 
it. 
And they, they would set these traps on the bottom. 
And ah that lasted 
for a couple of years. 
And then, I guess, they had to go to pretty deep 
depths for it and then it, it sort of petered out, I guess, it, the, the 
resource wasn't as heavy. 
They're still doing quite a bit of it up north 
though. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
But you have your abalone divers. 
You have the, the 
sea urchin divers, you know, that ah, for the export it to ah Taiwan and to 
Korea, Japan. 
So you have abalone divers and ah the sea urchin guys and ah 
and ah and ah the crab and lobster pot fishermen. 
Then you have your 
swordfishermen. 
Some use gill nets now. 
Where in the old days we used to run 
out on a plank with a harpoon and hand harpoon them, you know. 
And ah, I did 
that too, but ah, but ah, there's, then there are ah. 
But in the old days 
they had little one-man, one-lung, double-end Monterey boats that they brought 
over from the Mediterranean. 
That ah, them little one-lungers, they had a lot 
of them in Monterey and Frisco. 
Ah, they would come into markets every 
morning and they, they'd go out here in the channel and around the islands and 
they'd fish bottom fish. 
They'd have the baskets with lines in them and 
they'd coil them in the basket and every so far would be a leader and a hook. 
And they'd put a bait on it and they'd coil them in there. 
And then they'd go 
out and they'd fish the bottom by hand and they'd get two or three boxes of 
bottom fish and they'd come down to the markets and they'd sell them at the 
markets and wash the boat down and go home about three in the afternoon and 
eat and go to sleep and get up early in the morning and do it all over again, 
you know. 
But we don't have much, much of that anymore. 
T: 
What were those types of boats called? 
J: 
Well, they were, they were Monterey boats is what they, the style what 
they. 
They were double-enders. 
And they called them Montereys. 
But ah, but 
ah, they ah, we'd used to call them the market fleet. 
They fished daily for 
the fresh fish markets. 
And they'd catch sculpin, and they'd catch ah chili 
peppers and rock cod and ah, and ah, mainly bottom fish, you know. 
And they'd 
get some sea bass, some halibut. 
But a lot of that today has been replaced by 
gill nesters, you know. 
But the gill netters, I think, are on their way out. 
They've been fighting them for years and years. 
And I think gill netting has 
become a thing of the past. 
(T: 
Yeah.) 
Yeah. 
T: 
Someone told me, I think it might have been in San Francisco, or in 
Monterey, that at one time, and maybe still, there were conflicts between 
northern Italian fishermen and southern Italians fishermen that led to kind of 
an unofficial boundary of inshore and offshore reserved for [two or three  
words obscured as microphone is moved). 
Did you hear anything about that? 
J: 
Well, I don't know about inshore and offshore, but there used to be ah bad 
blood between ah the San Pedro fishermen and the Monterey and San Francisco 
fishermen. 
Ah, you know, in the sardine days. 
And I went through some of 
that and it got pretty bad. 
I mean guys would, you know, ah, wouldn't 
hesitate to come out with a shotgun, you know. 
31 
T: 
What was that all about? 
J: 
Well, what, what had happened is that ah, ah, they had canneries in 
Monterey and in San Francisco and Moss Landing and ah the season used to open 
up two months earlier up there than down here. 
So, when the sardine season 
opened up there the boats used to come out of Oregon and Washington and boats 
down here would go up there. 
And they'd fish up there. 
And these guys 
objected to it, you know. 
Yet, in turn, when the season was closed up there 
they'd come down here and fish. 
But they finally learned how to get along, 
but in the old days it got pretty bad where they'd sabotage each other's gear 
and steal their skiffs, or sink their skiffs and try to ram each other's nets 
and stuff like that. 
And there was some bad blood and bad feelings, and, and 
then I remember too, like ah, if we had strike down here. 
One year we had a 
strike for three months. 
We were, the price of fish they wanted to pay was, I 
think twenty-seven fifty a ton and we wanted thirty-two fifty. 
So, the 
canners brought a lot of boats from Monterey down here to scab on us. 
And ah, 
we, we had a hell of a fight, boy. 
And we, ah, they had the police down here 
and we had the harbor bottled up over in Long Beach and Wilmington, Terminal 
Island and Pedro. 
And I think it lasted three months. 
And they even put the 
docks down there under martial law. 
A lot of people didn't know it for three 
days. 
They barricaded everything down there and they limited the number of 
guys they could have on the picket lines and we had a real donnybrook. 
But, 
see, the canners would go get them guys and bring them down here and, and, and 
they'd fish for cheaper price because their season was over, see. 
(T: 
Mm-
hmm, mm-hmm.) 
And we had some real donnybrooks. 
(T: 
Hmm.) 
But, ah, but, 
ah, yeah, there was friction at that time, ah, that, that's one place where 
there was friction and, and bad blood and bad feelings. 
But that pretty well 
is dissipated. 
The other place where there was friction is between the bait 
boats and the purse seiners. 
Down in ah off the Mexican coast, you know. 
Ah, 
they both fished different methods and ah, and ah they had some ah, some ah 
hard feelings and some ah run-ins between bait boats and fishermen until the 
bait boats in '57 started to converting over to purse seiners, you know. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
But ah. 
T: 
They were fishing in the same territory? 
J: 
Yeah, well, but, ah, you know, if would be like ah, hell, we were fishing 
outside of [name of place unclear] Mexico, we, Mexico. 
We must have been two 
hundred miles offshore and we were following them big porpoise herds looking 
for tuna. 
And like we was working a school of tuna all day there, circling 
them, you know, you got to find out where they're heading, whether they sound, 
and, you know, you go around them with a boat. 
Around and around. 
And if 
they keep going straight, or when they hit your wake if they turn to the left 
or to the left or port or starboard, they sound, or they reverse themselves. 
And we was working just about all day and, finally, we were getting ready to 
let go the net and set on them and over the horizon come a bait boat out of 
San Diego, over there. 
About two thousand scoops [?] of anchovies in their 
tanks. 
And they pulled right up alongside of us and they opened up the 
floodgates in the tank and let a lot of anchovies out and ah just as we let go 
of the net. 
And the school of tuna went under our net and when over and they 
started jack-poling them aboard. 
So, when we got the net aboard we ah, we 
were mad as hell. 
I, I wanted to put about two hundred rounds of ammunition 
in their waterline and the skipper stopped me. 
But ah what they, what we did 
3i 
do, we used to carry big cases of, big bottles of Seven-Up and Coke and stuff 
in the pilot house, 'cause we didn't have any room down below. 
So we'd make 
runs at them and ah we'd throw these big bottles of Seven-Up and they'd hit 
their tank and explode and we'd chase them out of the racks. 
And ah but, not, 
nobody really got hurt. 
But, I 
mean, ah, there was bad feelings, you know, 
and. 
And then there was cases where purse seiners had wars with purse seiners 
over a school of fish, you know. 
One guy, he's, he, he retired and now he 
just passed away, Barney Marinkovich [sp?]. 
Ah, one of the San Diego purse 
seiners ah corked him, as they say. 
He was on a set, on a big school of tuna 
and this San Diego boat [several words unclear) come inside him and corked 
him. 
So, he didn't say nothing. 
He picked up his net and then when he got 
his net aboard and he picked up his skiff and then he dropped both of his 
anchors down about ten feet in the water and he went full speed and went 
through their god damn net. 
And then he wasn't satisfied, he backed up and 
turned around and went through it three or four times and put them out of 
commission. 
So, they took him to court in San Diego and ah, and it didn't 
turn out all that bad. 
I think he had to pay eighteen thousand dollars or 
something like that. 
But, he said it was worth it, he said, "Next time," he 
said, "I'll sink them," you know. 
But, ah, I don't think that particular boat 
and that skipper ever did that again ,to anybody, you know. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
But 
in the old days there was actually cases of shooting, you know. 
But ah, not 
so much anymore. 
But, there, there was, there was wars over gear conflict. 
But I ah, I never heard so much about this inshore offshore war. 
(T: 
Yeah.) 
North and south there was, you know, ah. 
T: 
Within California fishing towns you mean? 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
Yeah, 
J: 
Yeah, mainly over the sardines at that time. 
Now, there's a lot of 
problems on the whole coast from here to Alaska because ah, like in the salmon 
fishery and that where you have different seasons and they have different 
quotas. 
Guys want to migrate from one, one area of the coast to the other and 
ah and they have problems there. 
So now they're restricting the areas and 
they're restricting the number of vessels and, and quotas for each given area. 
And then they have to license boats now to stop ah, you know, ah, a lot of 
this, this problems they were having where. 
Well, for example, if, if ah all 
the salmon was congregating to go up the mouth of the Columbia, up the Klamath 
River, and if the whole coast went there and fished outside the Klamath River, 
well, hell, there was nothing left to go up the river, you know. 
But ah, over 
the years there's been some ah, some problems, you know. 
T: 
How long have fishermen from here been going to Alaska? 
J: 
Oh, ever since I can remember. 
(T: 
Really?) 
Yeah, ah, the, the, the 
Italian fishermen ah, ah, in San Francisco and Monterey ah, where they go 
every year ah after the sardine season was over and ah, and same way down 
here. 
But ah, I guess, the Scandinavians, Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes that 
lives in Seattle and lived ah and a lot of them lived in Alaska, too. 
But 
those guys went up there for years and years. 
But I know back in nineteen 
fifty, in the early fifties I had a chance to go to Alaska with ah, with some 
of the, the Scandinavian guys I knew that ah I fished with, when it came down 
from Seattle, down here. 
But Alaska was still a territory at that time. 
And 
at that time the salmon boats, there was a six week season and they made big 
money, but they had to use sail. 
There was no power. 
And everything was by 
hand. 
And then the tides up there changed so rapidly [two words unclear). 
33 
And guys would make big money in those days, but small boats and sail and no 
power and they'd drown six, eight, ten guys a season. 
So, ah, and I was 
always going to go but then it'd seem like I'd go to Mexico for tuna, but I 
always regretted the fact that I didn't go but a couple of seasons up there. 
But ah, but ah, right here in Pedro, ah, in fact some of them are just coming 
back now. 
Ah, we got guys like Nino, on ah, Nino Palma on the Restituta 
[sp?), he ties up his boat every year and him and his whole crew go up there 
and fish s.almon. 
And the same way with a lot of other guys. 
And out of 
Monterey, San Francisco. 
And some years they do good and they make a whole 
year's wages, and other years they don't make beans, you know. 
T: 
But it's exclusively the salmon fishery? 
J: 
Yeah, (T: 
Yeah.) yeah. 
T: 
Tell me, about. 
I've got just one, one or two other questions. 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
Ah, tell me about the, the role of the, of the fish companies that are 
down in the harbor. 
How they've functioned in the local fishing industry over 
the years. 
J: 
Well, there's not that much left, you know. 
You've got one mackerel 
cannery left that the boat owners bought, and we had a heavy hand in that. 
Then you got the one tuna cannery left in the United States. 
But, ah, but, 
ah, in the early days when they got started, according to the old timers, I 
guess, ah, a lot of times they'd bring their loads of fish into the cannery 
and they wouldn't get paid for it because they had to wait until the fish was 
canned and then eventually sold and that. 
And there was a lot of trust on 
both sides at that time. 
And then, and then the canners got bigger and 
powerful and very well off and then, ah, they became ah like the padrone 
They became the banker, the godfather. 
They ah, they ah, thought, these guys 
thought they were doing a lot of favors. 
They would ah, if a guy had to go 
into the shipyard, make arrangements to go into the shipyard, they would make 
arrangements for the repairs. 
They'd make arrangements for doing all of his 
book work. 
They'd pay all of his bills and nobody knew for years and years 
just how bad they were getting cheated, you know, until we got into the act on 
a lot of things. 
But ah, but ah, the, the canners, the processors, they were, 
they were the big guns, and ah they just about dominated ah everything 
including the price of fish, the weights, ah, just about the whole ball of 
wax. 
And that went on for years and years, and then finally it started to 
break up a little bit. 
But now everything is gone, you know. 
T: 
Yeah. 
What about the small, mostly family-run ah fish markets that are 
down by the boat harbor now? 
(J: 
Uh-huh.) 
What role do they play? 
J: 
Well, they ah, they ah played a very important role over the years in so 
far as the small ah small boats, the mosquito fleet, the small little boats 
that would go out every day or for two days at a time and come in and sell 
their fish to the fresh fish markets. 
They do buy fish, like when the tuna 
boats come back. 
And a lot of times if they, the tuna boats they'll take and, 
they won't take one tank of tuna, they won't put salt in it, and they'll just 
freeze it that way. 
And bring it in and they sell it to the markets who in 
turn sell it to the Japanese restaurants for sashimi and sushi and stuff like 
that. 
And it commands a much higher price than the tuna that goes to the 
cannery, you know. 
But it has to be in excellent shape and no cracks and no 
_?r 
splits in it. 
And it has to be round and not smashed and that. 
But ah, they 
ah, they have played a, I guess, a major role in the, in the fisheries for 
years and years and years. 
But anyone can tell you they call them the forty 
thieves. 
(T: 
I've heard that a few times.) 
Yeah, and ah, and down there, 
and they still get away with murder, you know, but they ah. 
But, you know, I 
have to laugh, you know, some of these Sicilians and ah, and not picking on 
that particular part of the ethnic group, but they got a god damned philosophy 
they brought with them from the old country, and I can't get it out of their 
god damn stupid heads that, you know, half a loaf is better than no loaf. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
And I tell them, "This is nineteen eighty-eight, eighty-nine. 
The 
hell with this half a loaf baloney, you know, I 
mean, if you're entitled to a 
loaf of bread, it's your loaf of bread." 
(T: 
Yeah.) 
It's not like the 
padrone system, but a lot of these guys, you know, they've been. 
I think half 
the time some of these guys don't feel happy unless they're getting cheated. 
[laughs] 
It's a hell of a thing to say. 
But ah, the markets they played a 
big role too because a lot of times they helped finance these guys and ah, and 
ah a lot of times ah they took fish ah, if it was illegal fish of course the 
boat owner had to practically give it away to them. 
And ah they done a lot of 
little favors for certain boat owners and fishermen like that there. 
but they 
got well compensated for it. 
Ah, I don't think anybody made more money than 
the forty thieves have in the last forty years. 
They just, they, they got a 
license to make money, you know. 
[laughs] 
D: 
Has the government been done there sometimes? 
Because we've gotten some 
funny reactions from some of them. 
J: 
They've tried, they've tried. 
In fact, ah, ah, the state department here 
ah not more than five years ago crashed on Sam DeLuca and the State Fish 
Market down there because he was selling lobster and shrimp and the better 
exotic seafoods to the Defense Department and they said he was selling them 
more ice and water than he was fish. 
And, ah, and there was a big scandal at 
that time. 
But some of them guys been in and out of trouble with the 
government. 
Nobody ever got really nailed badly. 
Pay a fine, they slap them 
on the hand or something. 
And ah, and ah, but ah, they ah, they service a 
necessary purpose, but by the same token ah, and I try to talk to the guys all. 
the time, some of these guys I just don't know. 
Like they say, well, the guy 
says "I owe him a favor." 
Yeah. 
Okay, so you did that 'cause you owed him a 
favor, okay. 
Next time, so what is it now? 
Well, you know. 
Well, how long 
do you owe the guy a favor? 
Are you going to spend the rest of your god damn 
life repaying that favor? 
You know. 
It seems to me, once you've paid that 
debt, that's it. 
You're home free. 
But ah there ah, there's something about 
it, you can't ah, you can't find in the rule books anywhere. 
But there is a, 
I guess it's a combination if you want to say loyalty and fear. 
(T: 
Mm-
hmm.) 
And ah, and I think a lot of it is a throw-back to ah, ah I guess, in 
the old days, in the old country. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
Where, you know, the 
padrone, you now. 
And I know guys here today where the old man, when they 
came over, and the kids come to me and tell me, you know, "Jeez, and you know 
this ain't right." 
And the old man tells them, and the kids tell me, you 
know, and the kids are grown men like you guys, and they said the old man 
says, "Hey, shut up. 
You got a wife, you got three kids, uh? 
Don't make 
noise, uh. 
You're feeding your family aren't ya? 
Now, shut up, don't make no 
noise. 
Don't rock the boat." 
And a lot of these guys now they're, they're 
educated and they don't like to see some of the practice so, you know. 
And 
ah, but ah, it ah, I, I just, I tried very hard over the years and we broke a 
3s 
lot of those barriers down. 
And we brought a lot of things together. 
And ah 
we got them their first welfare plan. 
And we got them their first pension 
plan. 
And we got a lot of things ah, you know, that they never had before. 
And we got them some fairly decent working conditions and, and ah honest 
wages. 
Ah, course we have to watch it. 
Sometimes they'll sneak in and we 
don't know about it and they'll unload without us being around to police the 
scales. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
But ah there's always angles, you know. 
But ah, you 
know it's, it's the nature of their market operators and the canners too to a 
point, but more so the forty thieves. 
It's their nature. 
They're not happy 
if they, if they're not ah stealing fish from you one way or another, you 
know. 
If it's only one god damn fish they got to, I don't think they sleep 
unless they feel that they got something from you, you know. 
(T: 
Mm-hmm.) 
And, and, some of them don't need it, I'll tell you, you know, and, you know 
But ah, but ah, they got a, they got a deal going down there that just, it's 
hard to break, you know. 
And ah, and you see it all the time. 
You see that 
it used to be real bad up in Frisco and then Monterey, too, you know. 
In San 
Diego the same way, you know. 
But it was funny, ah, it seemed to me that ah, 
ah the square heads, the Norwegians, the Swedes, and them guys. 
They were 
more militant. Then the Yugoslays were, I think, the next militant. 
The 
paisans were, I'm sorry to say, weren't as militant as the rest of them. 
And 
ah they took more and gave more than ah than the rest of them would. 
You get 
ah, you get a paisan who ah, who, who gets, gets his neck bent, gets tough and 
gets militant. 
He'll make up for about ten of the others. 
But, but there's a 
lot they're, they're, I guess they're lovers. 
I don't know. 
[laughs] 
But 
ah, ah, a lot of the stuff these guys put up with, practices down here, you 
know, up in Seattle and ah, and ah Tacoma and then ah, and Oregon and some of 
these places. 
A lot of them guys up there, they wouldn't tolerate some of 
this stuff, you know. 
They just wouldn't. 
D: 
It sounds like your father had pretty much of a conversion experience in 
Colorado. 
And he was one of those guys that make up for the ten of them. 
J: 
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah, I guess so, yeah. 
D: 
Well, did he, did ah, did he get frustrated with the, with the paisans? 
J: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Because, see, they hadn't went through ah when he 
landed here and they got involved in that big ah longshore strike, '33 and 
'34. 
Most of these guys hadn't been through a big strike like that. 
(A: 
Yeah.) 
And he got a taste of it as a kid in the marble quarries (A: 
And the 
coal mines.) 
and then he got it in the coal mines and then he just come out 
of all that stuff with that Ludlow Massacre and the big mine strikes there 
when he come out here. 
And then he got in with Harry Bridges and they started 
to put the longshoremen's union together. 
And they tried, I guess, oh, on a 
half a dozen occasions, in ah, I guess in the early ah nineteen hundreds and 
then in '21, 
'23, 
'27, they had big strikes. 
They always lost that. 
And, ah, 
so, ah, a strike wasn't new to him and he had some experience with it. 
And 
ah, and he had to run around and ah kick a few butts and put some backbone 
into a lot of these guys who otherwise weren't going to stand up, you know. 
D: 
How, how, what about the fact that, that, that most of the Italian 
community here was from Sicily and Ischia and your father was from northern 
Italy? 
(J: 
Yeah.) 
Did that, did that ah get in the way at all? 
3< 
J: 
Well, the, the ah influx at that time, I don't think it ah, you know, the 
Sicilian and the, and the Ischitans, I think that ah, and maybe I'm wrong, but 
there was more of a mixture of the Italian ethnic groups at that time. 
I 
think it was after World War Two we got the heaviest influx of the, of the 
guys from Sicily and Ischia. 
But ah, no, I don't 
A: 
They were mostly fishermens too, I think. 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
And most of them, you know, they fished sardines here, you 
know, ah, you know, in the islands there and. 
But ah, but ah, the old man 
never did go fishing. 
He made one trip and that, he didn't like it. 
But ah, 
you know, I guess, ah, 
D: 
So, the Italians that he was dealing with for the longshoremen, they 
tended to be more of a mix in terms of where they were from in Italy? 
J: 
I would ah, I would say so. 
Like, I don't think there was as many 
Sicilians ah, you know, around at that time. 
And ah it became like, you know, 
Julio Benedetti, you know, and them guys, and Lavorinis [sp?], they weren't 
Sicilian, were they Ma? 
A: 
No, they're ah, they're Veronese, they come from Verona. 
J: 
From Verona, from Verona, yeah. 
So, ah, you know, we can name all kinds 
of the families, you know, but ah. 
Yeah, I guess there was some Sicilians, 
but, like the Donantonis [sp?]. 
None of them were Sicilian, I guess, or 
Ischitans. 
A: 
I don't know what the Donantonis were, I really don't. 
J: 
Yeah, yeah. 
But ah, but ah, I think. 
Oh, go ahead, I'm sorry. 
A: 
Yeah, Eddie Donantoni's Sicilian. 
J: 
Eddie Donantoni was Sicilian? 
(A: 
Mm-hmm.) 
Well, could be. 
But ah, I 
guess that ah the ones from the southern part of Italy, I guess they were, I 
guess, on the beach. 
They were fishermen, I guess. 
And I guess they 
gravitated to fishing here where others, whether they be farmers, stonemasons 
or, or, or sheepherders up in the mountains, or whatever, I guess they 
gravitated to, or winemakers, wine growers, you know. 
But ah, but ah, now I 
don't know, and I don't profess to be an authority on it, I mean as to what 
the ethnic make-up was at that time, but I want to say that the, that the 
biggest influx, I think, ah, of the Sicilians and the Ischitans that came into 
the fish industry here in San Pedro, there was always some, I guess, but they 
were just a handful. 
And then, ah, they, I guess it was after World War Two 
when they, you know, when they brought a lot of them over, you know, cousins 
and nephews and stuff like that, see. 
D: 
That's interesting because we ah, we were trying to find out whether there 
were any, whether there was any bocce [several words unclear]. 
(J: 
Yeah, 
yeah.) 
And ah we came upon a group of three men who were the last members of 
the Veronese Bocce Club (J:: Uh-huh, uh-huh.) 
that has a court down off the, 
off of Gaffey. 
a7 
J: 
My dad played there 'til he died. 
Every Sunday. 
T: 
Mira Flores? 
J: 
Yeah, up on Mira Flores, yeah. 
Yeah, he helped, he helped make that bocce 
court and ah 
A: 
He was a good bocce player. 
J: 
Yeah, every Sunday he had to go down there and play bocce. 
And he'd come 
home with half a dozen bottles of beer he won and he'd be happy, you know. 
And then down of 10th and ah Grand, what used to be Pal's Cafe, ah, Pepe's old 
man, and ah, he was a Spaniard, but he a bocce court alongside the, his bar, 
called Pal's Cafe. 
And there was a lot of paisans lived on 8th, and 9th, and 
10th, and 11th, and 12th Street there. 
And they'd go over there and drink 
beer and wine and ah homemade moonshine with Pepe's old man. 
And they'd all 
play bocce out there alongside, you know. 
And then down on 13th and Center 
there used to be a bocce in one of the lots down there. 
They had some bocce 
alleys. 
But ah the last one, I guess, was the one out here on Mira Flores and 
ah, and there was a family that owned that whole canyon up there, the name was 
Riggero [sp?]. 
Ah, we knew them real well and we rented a house from them, 
the house, the house we lived in down on Mesa Street when they had the big 
strike. 
Old Lady Riggero owned it. 
And she had a dairy up there at one time. 
And ah, and so, ah, her son Ambrose and I'm trying to think of the other. 
But 
Dad knew them good and, and they let them build his bocce alley up there, you 
know. 
And they'd go down there and he'd manicure it and level it and tap it 
down and pack it. 
And ah, but every Sunday, huh? 
Pop, ah (A: 
Yeah, every 
Sunday he had to go.) if he was doing yard work or whatever he was doing he'd 
get, come in and shower and get all cleaned up and then he go down there and 
play bocce all afternoon with them guys, you know. 
And ah, it, it, he really 
enjoyed it a lot. 
A: 
Well, he lived a full life. 
He wasn't a man to lay around, you know, just 
sit and watch T.V. 
He wasn't that kind. 
Had to be doing something all the 
time. 
J: 
But it's interesting that you mentioned bocce. 
I went up to an 
installation dinner for the D.B.'s, up in Santa Barbara here some months ago. 
And the place where we had the restaurant, naturally was owned by one of the 
members of the D.B.'s, and ah we went out in back while they were barbecuing, 
I guess, a hundred chickens and a bunch of other stuff. 
And everybody was 
walking around drinking and B-S-ing, and I noticed they had, they had three or 
four nice bocce alleys there, but, and I asked them, I said, "Hey, who plays 
bocce here?" 
And, Christ, they had weeds that big growing up in the bocce 
alley. 
And the guy said, "Aw, nobody plays no more, you know." 
But at one 
time you could see that it was a hell of a nice bocce set up. 
But, when you 
see big weeds growing up in the middle of the bocce alley that means that, you. 
know, nobody's using it, you know. 
Because they used to keep them things 
manicured, you know, and keep it level and, boy, I mean, it. 
But when I 
was a 
kid there was ah, well, up until a few years ago, there was quite a few of 
them. 
But ah, then ah the Sons of Italy had one, I think down on 3rd Street. 
Now, I don't know if they still have one or not. 
I'm not sure because every 
empty lot nowadays has been built up with apartments or condos or something, 
you know. 
I think the last one is the one you're talking about out here on 
Mira Flores. 
T: 
Yeah. 
Well, they got us to play. 
We played last night. 
J: 
Oh, yeah? 
T: 
Yeah. 
D: 
Yeah. 
J: 
Well, good. 
T: 
Mister, ah, Pasquale D'Ambrose, there, who lives in town. 
The other two 
guys, ah, one guy lives in Torrance and the other guy lives in L.A., I guess. 
Ah, Frank, ah, Pontelli. 
Do you know him? 
J: 
Pontelli? 
T: 
Pontelli. 
J: 
Pontelli. 
It's too bad we didn't talk about this before you went down 
there because I know they would have remember Dad, 'cause Dad was down every 
Sunday. 
T: 
We're going to go back again. 
[laughs] 
We had a good time. 
J: 
Well, you ask, you know, you ask them if they remember the old man. 
And 
I'm sure they do. 
A: 
They called him Riale. 
T: 
Uh-huh. 
J: 
Riale, yeah. 
A: 
Some called him Jumbo, but mostly the Italians would call him Riale. 
J: 
But he ah, he just, boy, he loved to play bocce. 
I used to get a kick out 
of them when I was watching. 
Especially when they'd lob them through the air, 
you know, and that, and. 
Yeah. 
A: 
Most of the men he played with are all gone, too. 
J: 
I had to laugh at Dad's funeral. 
Mom, she says to me, she says, you know, 
ah, "Gee whiz," she says, "You know I feel bad." 
I said, "Why?" 
"Well," she 
said, "I don't see any of your Dad's friends, all of his old life-long 
friends. 
You know, they're not here." 
I told her: 
"Ma, they're all gone. 
The old man buried most of them, he out-lived most of them." 
I said, "That's 
why you don't see them here." 
[laughs] 
T: 
Yeah, yeah. 
A: 
He lived to be eighty-eight. 
And most of them [one word unclear] at 
seventy-eight. 
He lived to be eighty-eight. 
3y 
D: 
Well, he certainly, certainly did lead a life that I guess not many 
[several words unclear]. 
A: 
Well, he had a full life, I'll tell you. 
It's too bad they didn't get 
someone to write a book about his life. 
J: 
Well, we may do it yet. 
I often thought if I ever did write a book on 
that I often thought that I'd call it "Jumbo." 
I thought that I'd write a 
book like that and give it to this, I meet him down at Tranie's [sp?], 
Stallone, he'd probably make a hell of a movie out of a book like that. 
He 
made that movie "F.I.S.T." (T: 
Oh, yeah.) 
down here at Trainie's REstaurant, 
you know. 
(D: 
Oh, really.) 
They had the old Department of Water Power 
Building down on 7th Street and it was empty and then they put ah the name of 
the truck company up there, and they were shooting the movie there for weeks. 
And then every day he and his gang would be in Trainie's Restaurant, you know, 
ah eating [one word unclear] and linguine and clams and drinking [one word 
unclear], and we got to know him pretty good. 
D: 
I saw him in Philadelphia when they were doing one of the "Rocky" films. 
J: 
Uh-Huh. 
So, one day I was coming from Hawaii or Washington, D.C., I 
forget which now, and I was at the airport in L.A. 
And I was getting ready to 
go down the escalators. 
And here he;s coming. 
He had about six or eight 
bodyguards, all big black guys, you know. 
And I walked over to him and I 
said, "Hey, Rocky." 
And right away all these guys [makes whoosh sound]. 
And 
I'll tell you. 
"Oh, hold it." 
I said, "Hey," I said, "Hey, I just wanted to 
say hello to the paisan." 
I said, "I used to sit with you down at Trainie's 
when you was making the." 
"Oh, yeah," he said, "how's Jimmy, how's Louie, 
how is." 
"Fine." 
Okay, all these guys backed off, you know. 
Course I guess 
he's got to be careful 'cause you don't know who in the hell is going to walk 
up or something, you know. 
But ah, they made an awful lot of movies. 
They 
still do in this harbor. 
Tremendous amount of movies over the years 
Yeah, I 
often thought if I ever wrote a book about the old man that ah, that ah, that 
this Stallone might be the kind of a guy who would grab a story like that and 
could probably, you know, run with it, you know. 
[laughs] 
D: 
Well, I've run out of questions. 
T: 
Me too, me too. 
We really appreciate your time tonight. 
We know its been 
[several words unclear]. 
J: 
Okay, well, ah, you're leaving, you're leaving when? 
D: 
Monday. 
J: 
Monday. 
And you're going to be around? 
T: 
To the fifth of August, yeah. 
J: 
To the fifth. 
Well, ah, I'll be, you know in the office next week and if 
ah if you want to stop by, if, if any loose ends, or anything you think about, 
you want to stop by the office. 
(T: 
Okay.) 
Ah, I don't think I'll be going 
to San Diego. 
I may have to make a trip out to Hawaii the following week, 
but, but so, if, if you think of some last minute stuff, or you want to come 
by the office, or call or something. 
T: 
Okay, we appreciate that. 
D: 
Oh, one thing I did think of. 
Ah, I didn't make a picture downstairs of 
the, the old photographs on the wall just because that's a little bit more 
difficult [tape runs out at this point]
