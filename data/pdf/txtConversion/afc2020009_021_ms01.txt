JIMMY AMSPACHER, Boat Building & Miscellaneous Repair 
 
Katy Clune  00:00 
All right, it is June 4, 2021. KC and JG here in Marshallberg, North Carolina. And we're talking with—
and I'll have you introduce your full name, and tell us a little bit about what you do for a living? 
 
Jimmy Ampsacher  00:15 
James William Amspacher. Raised here. And do very little, but everything. 
 
KC  00:24 
So tell us why Karen thought we should talk to you, if we're doing a project on repair.  
 
JA  00:30 
[Sighs] Well, most things that can't be repaired, or are already tore up, finally one are way back here. 
And most time I can fix it. So I just, that's basically about it.  
 
JA  00:49 
And I fixed her shoes were 5200 [3m Marine Adhesive/Sealant] and she's still wearing them and just 
little odds and ends. It's, I don't know, if I can do it, just— 
 
Julia Gartrell  01:01 
What's 5200? 
 
JA  01:03 
5200? See that tube right there? That is an elastomer polymer that you use in boatbuilding. It's a glue. 
And when you get it on, it don't come off. So she had a little pair of pointed black shoes and she liked 
them, said, "I can't find no more," I said, "Let me have them." So I got some black, I went around it, 
fixed, I said, "Don't touch it for seven days." And she's still wearing them. That's been about four years 
ago. So it works. I don't believe in throwing anything away. It can be fixed.  
 
KC  01:40 
Do you have a storage area? 
 
JA  01:43 
You're in it! Oh, God. 
 
KC  01:45 
This is nothing.  
 
JA  01:46 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 2 - 
Oh, you don't know. The other end over here and then upstairs. And I do have a couple storage buildings 
I keep other things in. 
 
KC  01:57 
I might have to ask, get Annie [the dog, who has been panting audibly] to settle outside.  
 
JA  02:01 
That's fine. You can hear her? 
 
[laughing, work together to help Annie the dog into the main house 2:02-4:14]  
 
KC  04:14 
Tell us what your parents did. 
 
JA  04:17 
My daddy—[clears throat]. My daddy was a full blooded German. And until he married—I'll give you a 
little history of the family, too—he married my mother, the bloodline had never been broken. It was 
Amish, German, Dutch.  
 
JA  04:35 
And they came over here in 1642. And Daddy, when he got out of the army, he got out of the Amish 
faith. I should maybe, I don't care. They don't care. And he joined ministry [mic adjustment sounds] and 
that's what he did. He preached.  
 
KC  05:01 
Where did your family settle in 16—? 
 
JA  05:04 
York, Pennsylvania. Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. I guess I'm kin to everything up there. In a 
roundabout way, you know, through the book, to the ordinate[?]. But I can go up there now, I can say a 
few things, and I get that look. And they will, they'll go back and I can say, "Well, I came from the 
Scholes [spelling?] and Yoders [spelling?] and all this kind of stuff. "Oh, yeah., Merle? Edward? Yeah. 
Okay." 
 
JA  05:36 
So, anyway, I don't push that too much, because that gets titch-touchy up there. Mama? Her side of the 
family came from the banks. Hatteras. They died out probably in the 20s and 30s. They moved inland—
Mama was born inland. And she taught school for 43 years. Special ed. I was her number one pupil. 
[laughing] Oh, yeah, boy. So that's that was basically the family.

JG  06:08 
How'd your dad make it down here?  
 
JA  06:10 
How did? Mama. Mama worked for the CIA, which was back in those days was called the OSS. And 
she was in cryptography. Daddy, when he got back, he was when he was an engineer with patent in the 
Third Army. And when he got back, you know, I ain't got to tell you what happened, but anyway, 
they—she was working in Washington, he was guarding the president. And that was what we was 
assigned to do. And here I am. Just, you know, one of them war time lover things I guess, you know, 
who knows. But they didn't know each other until after the war. So that's the way it worked. They could 
have been totally different than what they were. 
 
KC  06:58 
Can you start—Where did you go to college around here? 
 
JA  07:02 
NC State. 
 
KC  07:04 
Okay, what do you study at NC State? 
 
JA  07:06 
Design.  
 
KC  07:08 
And you started out as a boat builder? 
 
JA  07:11 
No. They had a class called product design. I wanted to go in and be a mechanical engineer, but that was 
too easy. And I shouldn't say that, but it was. The mechanical side, I have absolutely, I didn't have any 
patience with it, let's put it that way. And I was more into development and things that I thought of, 
instead of what somebody else thought. So I talked to the _______, I got accepted, and I stayed in there. 
Glad I did.  
 
KC  07:48 
Have you always worked for yourself? 
 
JA  07:50 
No, I worked for the government for 31 years, in the engineering department. And I was on the OV-10, 
not the OV-10, but the Osprey V-22 [military planes]. I was on the design team for that.

JA  08:06 
The vertical takeoff lift helicopter type rig, and the tails rotate? I was on that. I was on a Harrier 
program, I was on the T-45 program, and a lot of other little things. 
 
KC  08:06 
What is that? 
 
JA  08:22 
I was into—I like robotics, but I like it but I don't. For repeatability. That's one thing. But I'm not into 
repeatability. I like individualists, but the—it was fun. And my boss turned me loose. And anybody 
knew anything that wanted anything. Or wanted something done, it seemed like I was always there to 
take up the slack. I developed a lot of things at the base. Dynamic balance systems for H-53 rotors and 
stuff. Yeah, just things that had been having problems with ever since the design came out. So we cured 
some problems and we created some. That's the way it works.  
 
KC  09:08 
Where was the base? 
 
JA  09:09 
Cherry Point. [Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, Havelock, NC] 
 
KC  09:12 
And you retired from—? 
 
JA  09:13 
Yep.  
 
KC  09:14 
Gotcha. What have you been up to since you've retired?  
 
JA  09:17 
Oh, Jesus, I need to go—I feel—Lord have mercy. I've worked, I work more now than I did then. That 
was fun. This is work out here. But you know that's that's all I've ever done. I can't sit still.  
 
JG  09:35 
What are some examples of what you might do in a week?  
 
JA  09:38 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 5 - 
In a week? More than most people will do in a month. I'm up at 4:30. I've been building, finishing the 
inside of my daughter's house. We had it contracted to frame up, some other stuff and then I took it once 
they got it done, I took it and finished it. So that's been every waking minute over there. Plus, in the 
meantime, I've been raising—I just lowered this house. [gestures to home nextdoor] I've had this house 
raised and all new floor joist put under that. And you name it. I just put a transmission in my 
lawnmower, rebuilding another lawn mower, getting ready to build a greenhouse. I mean, it is 16 hours 
a day. That's just the way I am. Can't stop. 
 
KC  10:33 
We're like that as a kid too? 
 
JA  10:35 
Uh, lord no. I worked. If you grew up down here, you had to work. There was no such thing as laying in 
there pushing buttons like these kids do today. I worked at it, Village Fish House, $5 a week. And that 
could be two hours, or it could be 60 hours. $5 a week.  $5 a week. I worked at Clayton Fish House in 
what time I had off of Billy's. If one fish house had boats coming in, I'd go work with that.  
 
JA  11:09 
But Mr. Clayton found out that I was, I was more mechanically inclined, than I was at shoving fish 
boxes around. And so did Billy [at the other fish house], that they would put me doing things, you know, 
on the boats. Actually fixing things. Now I'm at 12, 13 years old. And that's all I've ever done is fix 
things. Create stuff, make it work. And make it last you know. Or try to make it last. They can tear up 
anything down here. But that's—we didn't have anything to do nothing with, so we had to do with what 
we had. And sometimes it won't the right way, but it worked. That's just the way it worked. 
 
JG  11:52 
Can you think of an example of a strange way you maybe fixed something in the past? 
 
JA  11:57 
Oh, God. Yeah. Everything I do is strange. We went to a funeral. This is probably the strangest of all. 
We went to a funeral. Karen's uncle—I think it was her uncle. And I took her and her mother up. New 
Jersey. And, I don't—I think the funeral actually was in a bar. Because they quit playing pool and turned 
the jukebox off and had a funeral. It might have been in another room, but it was in that building where 
that bar was. I do know that.  
 
JA  12:40 
Well. There we were all pretty and dressed up. Went out, they loaded him in a hearse. It got maybe 100 
feet from the building and quit. In the road. So I had to put a fuel pump—I had to go find out what was 
wrong with it. I was dressed up, so I pulled my clothes off. I had a t-shirt on, I took my shirt off, my 
dress shirt.  
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 6 - 
 
JA  13:11 
And I went under that hood of that car in the middle of the road and found out that the fuel pump wasn't 
working. I left there and went to an auto store that was about a block away, bought a fuel pump, come 
back, put it on the hearse, still sitting in the middle of the road, with the procession behind it, and put 
that on there and got them running, and then we went to the graveyard. It's always something like that.  
 
JA  13:39 
I go—Smith Island? Some of my best friends live up there. They're like us. They grew up not having the 
ability to run down to a good hardware store. If you've found a piece of metal, you could cut something 
out of it and use it and that's what you did. And it's gotten to the point that when I get on the boat Larry 
hands me a list. He's the one that runs the Jason II [boat] back and forth." So this is what you got for 
next week and I got another list for the week after." That's fixing refrigerators, putting on roofs, fixing 
floors. [clears throat] It could be anything. Putting in a commode, fixing a bathroom. Fixing an old car, 
fixing a golf cart. Mending a net. It's always something. 
 
KC  14:29 
What can't you fix?  
 
JA  14:32 
Hmm, what can't I fix? I haven't gotten there yet.  
 
JG  14:40 
Do you sew?  
 
JA  14:40 
I have. 
 
JG  14:44 
Nothing to hold you back.  
 
KC  14:46 
How do you figure out what to charge people? 
 
JA  14:48 
Most time I don't. I usually have. I usually have a set fee. You know, I hear—and most time if they'll 
feed me, I'm good. But a lot of people don't want to accept that. And today's prices and the way things 
are and all that, you know, I say, "Okay, I'll take $15 hour and that's it." And they'll come in there and 
they always give you more and then when I walk out I always put it in under the table somewhere so 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 7 - 
they don't know it. And then they cuss me out when I get back. But anyway, I don't do it for the money. 
I don't need the money. I just I don't. I don't have a whole lot. But I what I've got's mine. So. 
 
KC  15:31 
So why do you do it?  
 
JA  15:32 
Because I want to. I mean. I'm 75 years old. And while I see Miss Lucille come out and her heater didn't 
work last night, and it was 22 degrees, and they stand around look at, "Well, it could be this, maybe it 
could be that?" Well let's go find out. So I go fix it. And if I need parts, I'll call the boat, and they'll bring 
it over on the boat. I'll fix it. So she's got heat. I don't care. And then there'll be a nice, great big coconut 
cake there in a couple of days, which is well worth. Well. Well worth it. [laughter] The old way is better 
than all this money business. Yeah. It's always been that way. 
 
KC  16:17 
Do you have siblings? 
 
JA  16:18 
Mmm hmm. I have a boy, Casey [spelling?], he's 36 years old. And I have a daughter who is 45, almost 
45, and I've got one that's 33. And the two girls are a lot like me, and Casey is not anything like me. He's 
like his mama. 
 
KC  16:41 
He was working at the Whitney, right?  
 
JA  16:43 
Yep. I hope he still is! [Laughs] 
 
KC  16:48 
How did, when did—Tell us about your history building boats. Help us understand that. 
 
JA  16:54 
[Sighs] Well, you have to understand the area that we're in. I'm not the only person that can do these 
things. As you run up on Kenny. Kenny is one of my good friends [referring to Kenneth Styron Sr, 
diesel boat engine mechanic, interview in this collection] and Toby. Toby and I grew up together 
[referring to Toby O'Neal, auto bodywork shop owner, interview in this collection]. So did you 
understand him? 
 
JG  17:20 
We did all right.  
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 8 - 
 
JA  17:21 
You had a translator? He get's excited. 
 
KC  17:25 
Honestly, [crosstalk] she wasn't really translating. There was some stuff, where he was laughing and I 
didn't know why [laughs]—  
 
JA  17:31 
Oh, yeah. 
 
KC  17:32 
But I'd say we, I probably understood 75%. So pretty good.  
 
JA  17:37 
You've done well.  
 
KC  17:40 
It helps, you know honestly, I can hear you much better with this so, [pointing to headphones connected 
to mic and audio recorder].  
 
JG  17:45 
I did alright.  
 
JA  17:46 
So now what would you have done if if him and I would have been talking? You'd have got about 30%. 
[laughter] That's alright, I understand. 'Cause the day that Conch [spelling?] died, which is a cousin, we 
all went to Ocracoke for the funeral. And we stood on the back of the ferry and all those people on the 
back of ferry, they just stood there and looked at us like, "What are you two talking about?" And we 
were making fun of them and they didn't even know it! But that's all right. [laughter] 
 
JA  18:17 
Going back to your subject. When you came home and your boat was rotten, you didn't ask anybody to 
go do it. Because the people did not have the money to go hire somebody. Some did, some didn't. But, 
while I was getting—growing up, I don't ever remember my daddy making over $10,000 a year. And 
that's you know, a worked like a dog too. But if you needed a boat you would go to the store and order 
the lumber, order the nails, and they bring it, drop it in your yard.  
 
JA  19:02 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 9 - 
And you went out there and built a boat like you want. And that's how you made your living. You built 
your own boat. Some people couldn't build their own boat, but I would say, in the community that we 
were raised in, Atlantic—and Harkers Island, same way, Marshallberg, Tusk, Williston, the whole 
crowd, Davis, Smyrna, every—Cedar Island, better not leave them out, and Sealevel. Anybody could do 
anything. If you wanted a house, you went and built it.  
 
JA  19:33 
If you wanted to put plumbing in it, you went and drove the well, you put plumbing in it. There was 
always somebody there to help you. It was easy to ask for help, 'course most time people would come by 
and help you, but they wouldn't go there and do it. Because in the middle of the night, if it broke, you 
wouldn't go wake him up. So when the pump quit, you better know how to go out there and fix it. So 
that's the way out that worked.  
 
JA  20:01 
And as far as boat building? Everybody was building boats around me and it's always [pauses]. . . Its a 
fascination that how—to watch the water come off of the hull or suck back in on the tumblehome, or 
whatever, to watch it. To see different designers, if you go out on different boats, you see what they've 
done to the bottom of the boat. And you can tell about the wave pattern who's got the faster bottom, or 
what's the less drag, you know. 
 
JA  20:34 
And then my mind gets off out there somewhere in outer space. And I I worked with Henry Fulcher 
[spelling?]. And—[forgetting name], old age is a bad thing. Henry Fulcher and my neighbor. . 
.[stammers] Alvin Harris. And Alvin would get me up by—When I was a boy, he was a master 
woodworker. Alvin was. And he would get me and say, "Hold the board," And he—that's the way I 
started. Holding board.  
 
JA  21:15 
And I took it from there. And while I went and . .  got a little bit of sense, education, and then went to 
work for the government, I was still dealing with hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. So I came home 
one day, I was so disgusted. And I bought that little, Karen bought me that little bandsaw. [motions to 
saw behind him] 
 
JA  21:42 
And I, I've had that thing for probably 33 or 34 years. And I've cut out a many a model boat, many big 
boat on it. And I just started getting back in it and developping myself. And hopefully, they have taken it 
to a different level than everybody else. I look at it a little bit different.  
 
JA  22:02 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 10 - 
But I don't try to deviate from the old rules and the old principles. Because when you start doing that, 
you start asking for trouble. I mean, they sailed for what? Since who knows whe. They're still trying to 
figure that out. They've been sailing. So to be sure, they know a whole lot more than I did. And you 
don't change the basic rules and laws, you just modify them. 
 
KC  22:32 
What do you bring to your designs? [pause] When you say you try to— 
 
JA  22:39 
Oh, I know what you're talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. I bring accuracy and 
precision. And hopefully, hopefully, a more efficient boat.. 
 
JG  22:58 
Do you build the model boats to sort of brainstorm for larger boats? 
 
JA  23:06 
The model boats—so when I was growing up, I keep going to that, but that's the only way I can say it. 
When I was growing up, the harbor, there was 60 or 70 boats in the harbor. Now there is none, hardly. 
Four or five boats. There were boats everywhere when I was a kid, 30-, 20-foot up to 65-foot. And 
nobody remembers them. So my goal has been—and I'm still working on it, I don't know if I'll live long 
enough, I hope I do. But I'd like about 25 or 30 boats that I'm going to build myself that are exact 
replicas of those boats.  
 
JA  23:47 
So that one of these days they'll say, "Well, that's that's the boat that my great, great, great granddaddy 
worked on. Because they might have a picture of it. But my boat has got to be perfect with that picture. I 
have that, I don't want to say 'ability' because that sounds bad—I have that desire to make it that way. 
And if it's not, I'll not finish it. I'll beat it all the patients. If it doesn't look right, I'll not finish it. 
 
KC  24:21 
What other information do you use when you're recreating historical boats like that? Like do you just 
have photos or old hull—? 
 
JA  24:30 
Mmm hmm. Sometimes. But that's that's a thing of the past. Oh, let me, sit right there [goes and gets 
print out of a small black and white photo of a boat.] Okay, that's a picture of "the Pet." There's only two 
or three pictures of that boat. And I built that boat last year for a gentleman whose wife, that was her 
uncle [man in boat in photo]. 
 
KC  25:06 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 11 - 
Was that a mailboat? 
 
JA  25:07 
That is the mailboat. That's the "Pet." And I went back, and I asked some of the older people in the 
community about this and about that, and while I got through with it, I don't have, I don't have the 
picture of the boat that I completed. But she broke down and started crying. And I had some people 
come in here that when they walked in—My biggest reward and joy is when I have the boat up there and 
it's not even painted. And they walk in, they say, well, that's the "Pet." So I got it. 
 
KC  25:45 
And it's good to be doing that while there are still people who remember them. 
 
JA  25:49 
Well, that's the whole thing. That's the whole thing. I don't know what will happen to them. And I have 
one good friend, that I have built probably 25 boats for, and he enjoys that perspective of it. The old 
way. Because he knew the old way too. And it's joyful when you see that somebody walk, [mimics 
surprise] "Ah, that's the Aleta" Yeah. That's right.  
 
JG  26:17 
Do you consider yourself a historian? 
 
JA  26:19 
Nah. I'm just crazy. [audio blows out as KC switches mic cover, breeze picked up with light rainfall] 
 
JA  26:32 
Couldn't be too bright 'cause your daddy kept calling him son. [laughs] You have to learn to learn the 
vernacularisms around here. Cause you can get cut real quick.  
 
JG  26:48 
We heard a few from Karen.  
 
JA  26:49 
Oh, yeah, I don't doubt that a bit. Now I've got a book up there, I'll show it to you when we get through 
this. There's the, at the top of that [pointing to photo on cupboard]. That is the Albatross. I think that's 
III. And that's the Harry Michael to the right. That Harry Michael was built in 1952 in Morehead City. 
That is—they're just leaving Morehead City. That's where the high-rise bridge is at. Harry Brickhouse 
[spelling] is the captain on her. Captain Harry is on the back of her and Clay's Daddy, Big Clay, and 
Harry Michaels on her. And I got that model in the house.  
 
JA  27:39 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 12 - 
And it looks just like her. 
 
JG  27:41 
Is there a particular scale you work at? 
 
JA  27:43 
Just whatever your whatever turns me on. I'm having trouble with the fingers. And I like to work at 
three-quarter scale. That seems to be a workable thing. But sometimes on a 60-foot boat three quarters is 
not, you know, you still got to scale it down. I make my own scales. I make all of my own parts. I do it 
all. So. 
 
KC  28:08 
Where are your boats? 
 
JA  28:10 
They are all over the United States. 
 
KC  28:12 
Are they in private collections? In museums? And are some of them on the water?  
 
JA  28:18 
Yep.  
 
KC  28:19 
Cool.  
 
JA  28:20 
Yep.  
 
KC  28:21 
Tell me about using live oak for boat building.  
 
JA  28:26 
Why would you want to? 
 
KC  28:27 
I heard that people did that. Because it's a real sturdy wood and then sometimes the curve can be useful.  
 
JA  28:37 
Did you hear that down here?  
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 13 - 
 
KC  28:38 
No.  
 
JA  28:40 
You heard that up north.  
 
KC  28:42 
I heard about it from someone who lived in I think upstate New York. Yeah. So is it complete BS? 
[laughs] 
 
JA  28:50 
Yes, no—Okay, there's different types of boats. Okay, the salinated [?] water around here is different 
than it is in New York. With the gulfstream, its cool. They have a tendency to build boats out of oak and 
heavier, denser woods than we do, for the very simple reason is that it lasts a long time and it's good. So 
you've got to steam it or you've got the full-cut frames. You got to have a piece of wood 24 inches to cut 
one frame out to get the round, or shape, or whatever you want to call it. And it's hard. And all those old 
sailing ships that were probably, all up on the Nantucket, all the way back up in Massachusetts, and all 
them places. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that they use a lot of white oak and it's a good wood. 
 
JA  29:48 
But see, when they plank the boat, they don't, they use a different type wood than what   use. We use 
Juniper. Its a swamp wood. See, you got look at location. In New York they could go, they didn't have 
to—They were on the mainland all the time. There was something there. Down East? There weren't 
nothing here. Nothing.  
 
JA  30:11 
When you have to sail from Atlantic to Beaufort to buy lard and flour, because there's no bridge, you're 
in nowhere. So you use what you can. White cedar is what we use, we call it juniper. Some of the boats 
have been around almost 100 years. And some of the woods been replaced, some of it hasn't. But we use 
what they call hard pine—longleaf pine—and juniper. They work, they work for us. But we're not 
building 150-foot boats. 
 
KC  30:50 
Well, thank you, 'cause I won't go spreading false information anymore. [laughs] 
 
JA  30:53 
No, it's a, I think I think a lot of that—I read some stuff one time about the way they built (the English) 
built their boats. And I believe they didn't—I don't know what they call it, they call it something else 
over there—But their wood was basically similar to that, they had to cut the frames. And if you ever go 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 14 - 
on an old sailing ship, you'll notice you'll have a quarter frame, and then another quarter frame, and a 
quarter frame.  
 
JA  31:26 
And what they do, they sister them together to make one frame. The frames on them are 12, 14 inches. 
Well. You can't get a piece of wood that wide to cut the whole thing. So you cut a little piece here, a 
little piece here, and then you put a butt block, and then you just fill it in, so you got to frame that wide. 
Them old boats are heavy. Putting that wood in there was heavy too. But yeah, that's the way they did it. 
 
KC  31:51 
And you said you teach at Carteret Community College? 
 
JA  31:55 
Right. 
 
KC  31:56 
What do you teach?  
 
JA  31:57 
Boat building.  
 
KC  31:58 
That's right. How do people—you know, coming up, in their 20s, younger—around this area? How do 
you learn the skills to take care of your own belongings? 
 
JA  32:16 
To be self-sufficient, in other words? You don't. The family structure is not there. Everybody is 
destroyed with this [mimes pointing at a smartphone], getting in a car and going here to get that, dialing 
up Amazon, and on your doorstep the next day, instead of going out there and actually trying to do 
something.  
 
JA  32:44 
And it's happened over a period of time. I mean, it's not something that just happened overnight, but it's 
just . . . When they put the road in about '32, I think, when it, when they put the road Down East. That 
was—It wasn't bad, even me, in the '50s and '60s. And it was still, we didn't go to town but once a 
month. And we bought what we needed and come home.  
 
JA  33:11 
And, but now, you can get in a car and go to Lowe's, and get what you want. No big deal. Everything is 
too easy. And then what you get is junk, you shouldn't—I hate to put any more money in a Chinese

pocket. If I can help it, I ain't gonna do it. But that's just the way it is. 'Cause everything I've got from 
them I've had to go back and rework it. It's just the way it is.  
 
JG  33:41 
Who takes your classes? 
 
JA  33:43 
I have a lot of veterans who are PTSD people. Some aren't, some are. And they use it as therapy. And 
I've had younger students. And you actually get a degree, it's a degree program. And we're trying to, I try 
to stay out of the teaching side or the administrative side because I don't want nothing to do with that.  
 
JA  34:15 
The world is changing so fast that they're losing contact and continuity. What really works. I mean, 
I've—I am a [clears throat] space nut.  
 
JG  34:39 
Outer space? 
 
JA  34:39 
Oh Lord, yeah. I'd go in a heartbeat. Shh, good lord, I want to go. I want to go. And, about UFOs and all 
that kind of stuff? Oh, they're just starting to admit that there are things happening.  
 
JA  35:02 
Well, how about that. You know, I don't think those people—Egypt, and the Aztecs, and Incas and 
Hindus and Hebrews, and what other -news—drew little people on, tanks on their back and masks, just 
to be drawing. Just like the people in Australia. It's a [stammers], I think we were put here as a science 
experiment for somebody else. That's my thinking. Some people think I'm crazy, but that's it. We came 
from nothing. And where are we going? So, maybe we'll get there someday.  
 
JG  35:47 
So your class, is the group building one boat collectively, or does everyone build their own boat? 
 
JA  35:55 
It's not got to the point where we can, we can do that. They are building one boat collectively. They 
build, they build—They design their own boat and then they collectively pick the boat that we want to 
build.  
 
JA  36:11 
We have factors that weigh into the design process, "Which one you think's going to take—this that or 
the other?" And we build that boat. 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 16 - 
 
JG  36:25 
So it usually a certain type, like a rowboat? 
 
JA  36:29 
Its real simple. Yeah. Got to start simple.  
 
KC  36:37 
Tell us about how, the storms, hurricanes, have affected the kind of repair you work on. Like even house 
raising? Seems like since flooding and water is coming higher, that much of your work as must be about 
preventing, or fixing, after floods. 
 
JA  37:12 
You can look at that two ways. They had just as bad storms back then as they've had—I mean, they had 
some whoppers back there in '30 and—they had some lulus [spelling?]. And, I mean, they didn't go raise 
their house. But they didn't live in a $500,000 home either, with all this paraphernalia. 
 
JA  37:35 
I'm skeptical of sea rise. I know there's pylons that my best friend I put down in 1960 to tie our skiff too, 
they're still there. Can still see 'em. I think what's happening is we're getting erosion from underneath. 
And that's what's killing all the pine trees. Emerging, salt water penetration coming up.  
 
JA  38:01 
'Cause I noticed when you go down on the _____ stretch, those trees didn't look like that. That was 
pretty back—when you get on, that going into James Paul's curve [?]. It was. But now they're all rotten. 
And you look all down the woods out here. Salt didn't burnt them—Salt did burn them up. But from 
which end, I don't know.  
 
JA  38:22 
I have problems with people building right in the ocean. That shows somebody who's not got a whole lot 
of sense. And the houses? That house there was built in 1875. I just added on to it. And one of the 
biggest factors is—They never had problems. Well, they had problems but they didn't have it to the 
magnitude that they've got them now.  
 
JA  38:51 
They used to keep the ditches clean. They used to have the prisoners that worked—the convicts, 
working in regional prison camps. And they used to go around, they'd dig the ditches out. Nobody had 
water standing in the yard. Now everybody's covered up the ditches. Where's the water going to go? 
 
KC  39:11 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 17 - 
Also, probably all the paved— 
 
JA  39:14 
Paving ain't got a thing to do with it. All down the front of that road out there used to be a ditch. Every, 
right down there, granny had a ditch there, there was a ditch right through here, every lot was ditched to 
a main artery. Well, they blocked all the main arteries up because nobody's cleaned them out. There's 
nowhere for the water to run. So it's got to sit where it's at. And, you know, there's a there's something to 
everything, and I don't know what it is, but it's just the way I see it. 
 
JA  39:44 
If they would—and then they get back in and say, "Well, oh." The EP—who is it, environmental people 
won't let them open up [?] the ditches due to the pollution. Well, hey, guess what? You're emptying your 
septic tanks over there in Beaufort? 75,000 gallons a month—or a day. All the raw sewage goes into 
Taylor Creek. So yeah, unless they've changed that, that's what it used to be.  
 
JG  40:20 
Have you ever fixed a pier?  
 
JA  40:21 
Yeah. Oh yeah.  
 
JG  40:23 
Can you describe that?  
 
JA  40:25 
Well, yes, nothing to it. You just go out there, take the old, tear out the old, and put the new in.  
 
JG  40:30 
But how do they put the pilings in? 
 
JA  40:32 
You wash them down.  
 
JG  40:34 
What does that mean?  
 
JA  40:35 
What you got, a little motor, and it's just like a, a little pump, little water pump. And you take, and put it 
on a 30-, 40-foot piece of hose. And then you take another piece of pipe and stick in that, hold the piling 
up, and hold it right there, and it will go right down into the ground. 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 18 - 
 
JG  40:52 
You just make a little tunnel of air? 
 
JA  40:55 
No, the water washes the sand out. So you're—it's just like your water hose. If you take your water hose, 
and you go out there in the down the dirt and hold it, t's gonna dig a hole, right? [JG agrees] Okay, same 
thing. 
 
JA  41:06 
You stand your piling up, you take that piece of pipe and you get it right up next to where you want to 
go and you just turn the water pressure up and it'll just get ______ right on down.  
 
JG  41:17 
And that self heals? 
 
JA  41:19 
That's right. As it moves, the sands fine, it tightens itself right up. 
 
KC  41:25 
No scuba gear? [laughter] 
 
JA  41:27 
No! 
 
JA  41:29 
What are you gonna scuba dive in four foot of water for?  
 
JA  41:29 
Might come up with a broken neck doing that. No, I'm pretty sure—well, that's the way they do it. Now 
a lot of people, these big companies that do it, these big pilings, you could do it that way, you could 
wash anything down, but some of them have these pile drivers. I know you've seen where they drive 
them, and they ____ them and boom, boom, beat them in. That's fine. I mean, whatever way turns them 
on. But the simplest way, for a simple person, to go build a dock, is to go out there and do that. And you 
can pull it up the same way. 
 
KC  41:33 
I'm kind of teasing. [laughter] 
 
JG  42:09 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 19 - 
Oh, that's really clever. So it sounds like Florence really tore y'all up. What sort of repairs were you busy 
with after that hurricane came through? 
 
JA  42:23 
I put in two new air conditioners, all the ductwork under, new roof. All appliances. I lost about $60,000 
worth of stuff out here. It was just—it was bad. September 17, 2003, you see that mark? [pointing to his 
workshop wall, where about a foot and a half above the floor is a mark indicating the high water line.] It 
was about just to the top of that 17 in this garage.  
 
JA  42:43 
Everybody's for thereself. I mean, if somebody down road needed help I go help them, but as soon as 
they got where they were at, you know, they could help themselves, you got your own problems.  
 
JG  42:49 
How does the town handle it? 
 
JA  42:51 
What town? 
 
JG  42:52 
Well, the community.  
 
JA  43:08 
And there was nobody rushing down here. We did have those—uh, I hope Karen don't listen to this. But 
anyway, when Ocracoke had that, what was it, year before last? [crosstalk] Dorian, yeah.  
 
JA  43:28 
A good friend of mine over there, Jimmy, he used to cut—he went to East Carolina, he didn't stay there 
longer than about a week or two, that was enough, but anyway, he would— 
 
JA  43:47 
There was only one ferry going to Ocracoke. So he would thumb—we didn't have a car—so he would 
thumb from Greenville to Atlantic. And he'd get there, 10, 11 o'clock at night. And he would open the 
window to the house and come in my bedroom—I had bunk beds. He'd sleep in one, I'd sleep in the 
other.  
 
JA  44:09 
Next morning, Mama'd feed him, get him up, everything, he'd go get on the ferry and leave. He called 
me and told me he was said he was in there [?] with his wife Linda. And he saw it coming. Coming off 
the reef. He said it was a wall, about six or seven foot, and it just came and destroyed it. 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 20 - 
 
JA  44:28 
Now there's nothing you can do about that. But one of the biggest things that—and I don't know how to 
phrase this—but I guess everybody thinks that we're not self sufficient or can't help ourselves? I mean, 
we've only been doing this since day one.  
 
KC  44:39 
Who is "we"? 
 
JA  44:44 
There's a lot of people. So we had this influx of people come down to try to help. Well, they helped, but 
they're hindered, at the same time. I mean, there was a lot of things thrown away on Ocracoke that 
shouldn't never been—they went into people's houses and threw everything out.  
 
JA  45:15 
You don't do that. And, I know it was in good faith. But how do you how do you explain to somebody, 
"Why don't you just leave my stuff alone? I've been through this before?" 
 
JA  45:28 
I remember Hazel. It washed out the causeway between Beaufort and Morehead. There was a hole in 
there, twenty feet deep. There was a boat—well, you don't know, do you know where the ______? Do 
you know anything about Morehead? 
 
KC  45:46 
No, I don't know much about Morehead at all.  
 
JA  45:48 
When you come into Morehead, and when you get right into where the little buildings are starting to be, 
you know? The the one on the right was, Belks [?], and a pool room on the left, and it's the town.—
where it starts. I think it's 3rd Street or 4th Street or something like that.  
 
JA  46:06 
One of Captain ______'s boats was sitting in the middle of the road there. It picked it up and set it up 
there. So, you didn't go down there and fool with his boat. And I, its jus— People that needed the help, 
I'm pretty sure they enjoyed the help, but it got—it's just the idea of everybody rushing in to help when 
they're needed but they're not. Or it'd take a little bit more than—and the people needed help over there. 
but they didn't need. . .  
 
JA  46:45 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 21 - 
What was it, the storm of 33? There was, I reckon it washed over Ocracoke. I know it was 12oot of 
water over at Cedar Island. 'Cause Gilbert, Ray Daniels [spelling?], was born at night and he was in the 
second story of the house and the water was right to the thing when his mama had him. So yeah, there 
were chickens in the trees, boats in the trees. Cows hanging in the tree.  But—I don't know. We can fend 
for ourselves. 
 
KC  47:20 
What about this area has stayed the same? 
 
JA  47:26 
 It's dying off. It hurts. I don't know. The roads. . . ? That's the only thing I can see that's the same. 
Because everybody that comes here wants to change it.  And the more we get, the more people that 
come here, the [sighs]. . . its . . Why did you come here? 
 
JA  48:00 
"Oh it's beautiful down there. I did enjoy going walking down the road and looking at the water and all 
this kind of stuff." Well, why did you put a fence around your yard? There's never been a fence there. 
People have little beaches on Harkers Island. There's a place down right now were—you only own to the 
high water mark—some of these people coming out here don't understand that. They need to read their 
deed. And they have literally gone down and put signs on the beach. "Private Beach." That ain't good. 
 
KC  48:37 
Do you do repair work for dingbatters? [Down East term for off-islanders.] 
 
JA  48:43 
No. Have you, do you know the difference between the two dingbatters? A dingbatter will go and come. 
A damn dingbatter stays. [laughs] 'Cause we can't—there the ones, I'll tell you what. 
 
KC  48:58 
I think Karen's told me that before. [laughter] 
 
JA  49:03 
Believe it or not, I have, but it don't too close. [referring to doing repairs for off-islanders] And if they're 
trying to do something goofy or stupid, I won't have nothing to do with it, but if if they need help—and a 
lot of the people coming down are nice, don't get me wrong, they are. Tt's just that that one—whatever 
they are. "You owe me this" and "I got a right to do this, you get out of my way, I've got my golf cart." 
 
JA  49:41 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
 
- 22 - 
I will run over you. Don't pull your golf cart out in front of my truck. I will get you. If you don't got 
better sense than that, you don't need to be driving. But no I—yes. And some of the people that come 
down here are genuinely trying to keep it as is. But its far between, few and far inbetween. 
 
KC  50:05 
What's your hope for this area, in the next 50 years? 
 
JA  50:11 
I want to be dead before it's destroyed. I want to be dead before my last friend dies. [pause] 
 
KC  50:24 
I can understand, more, the meaning behind recreating these boats, because when you're gone, it's also 
your—part of your legacy for the area. 
 
JA  50:37 
But see, nobody will know. Nobody will ever know that I've worked on every one of these boats. They 
can't, they can't feel—On Saturday, or 12 o'clock Friday, sitting in school, [Helen Rose?] would come 
on the intercom, "Alright boys, the boats are coming in loaded. Might as well go and get your oilskins 
and go on down to the fish house. I'm in school. Dropped right out. We went to work.  
 
JA  51:08 
That's the way it was. Community was first and everybody was for the community. And there were 
some that couldn't do it, I mean, you could take them down, and hand them a shovel, and they'd look at 
it. And they never have worked. But the major—I'd say, 90% worked. Doing something. It wasn't 
nothing but shoveling ice or rolling a wheel barrow. Or pulling fish boxes. Its just, I don't know, those 
days are gone, those days are gone.  
 
JA  51:50 
And I hate it. And this is not the only area—you know. We go to the mountains. Karen and I both love 
the mountains. I was in military school in the mountains, Tennessee. The people up there were just like 
we were. And now we go up there, and we'll go into some of these little communities, and stuff like that, 
and they'll look at you, and in the old mountain talk, "Where are you from?" "Well we're from the 
coast." He said,"You got trouble with him dingbatters? Or them foreigners?" They call them foreigners. 
A lot of other things too. 
 
JA  52:31 
I said, "Yeah." "Well, they're moving in on our mountains and blocking the roads off and doing this and 
doing that." I mean, they've been in there how long, since Daniel Boone went in there. The Indians. Half 
of them are Indian. Its just a sad state of affairs. I don’t know how to solve it. I don't know if you can. 
Don't know if you can.

- 23 - 
 
JA  53:02 
It's not all doom and gloom. There's some—I love to go to the communities, like I grew up in, and they 
are getting very hard to find. Even you two. As young as you are. You remember things when you were 
growing up, that you now go back, and nobody has a clue what you're even talking about. And you 
had—did you grow up in a city? 
 
KC  53:32 
I'm complicated. My dad was a diplomat. So I grew up in the city. But a lot of them, around the world. 
[laughs] 
 
JA  53:41 
Did you ever go ou—were you ever with a cluster of kids? Y'all go out play at night?  
 
KC  53:46 
Oh yeah.  
 
JA  53:47 
Have you seen anybody do that lately? It's so depressing to sit here and not hear one youngin' ride up 
and down on the road or a bicycle or something. Used to, the youngins are playing, they'd run through 
the yard and go and turned water hose on you. I mean, it was people everywhere. You don't see it no 
more. You? [To JG] 
 
JG  54:15 
I grew up in Durham. Yeah, I used to run pretty feral.  
 
JA  54:19 
That's right. It's all changed. It's not just here. It's everywhere. 
 
KC  54:28 
Hey, and this is totally unrelated but just to prove your point. We lived in Paris when I was in middle 
school so I was 12 and my mom would let me go to the Champs-Élysées with my friends, alone, just in 
the city.  
 
JA  54:44 
Why not?  
 
KC  54:44 
Why not? [laughter]

JG  54:47 
That doesn't happen anymore. People call the police on a kind, unaccompagnied minor.  
 
JA  54:55 
Its just crazy.  
 
JG  54:57 
Well, how do, you know, is there way that you can kind of help the next generation? I mean, you're 
teaching this craft which feels very important. You know all this history of the area, you're preserving it 
through the boat building, the model building. You know, how do you make sure that that stays and gets 
out there? Your wife is a historian, at a museum.  
 
JA  55:27 
You only absorb what you want to. Nobody wants to work. Boatbuilding is hard work. It's not go to the 
store, buy all the boards already cut or this, that, or the other. It's hard work.  
 
JA  55:48 
And I have most of my students, when they get done, they're wore out. "I didn't know if that hard?" 
[chuckles] "Guess what, this is easy. Wait until we get into something else."  
 
JA  56:01 
But yeah, it's gone to the point of technology is the dominant factor and you—[pause, stammer] I'd go 
sit at the computer once in a while. And I worked on one for 31 years, and I despised it every minute. 
Because you lose. You lose you. In whatever you're doing.  
 
JA  56:35 
I don't like, I don't text. You want to talk to me? Call me. I'd rather you come see me. I'd rather look at 
you and talk to you, don't come here with your sunglasses on, I can't see you, I won't talk to you.  
 
JA  56:49 
But that's the way it is. It's got so impersonal. I mean, you know, people don't want to face nobody. I 
don't know [pauses]—its too compute—its too mechanical now. I mean, it's, "Well, the book says you 
got to do this." "Since when? I'm gonna do it this way." "Well, it looks the same." "No it don't. I put me 
in this. You let the machines do that."  
 
JA  57:30 
So that's, I don't think, that's not going to change. Because it's easy. And you have the world at your 
fingertips. God, I despised those old Compton's Encyclopedias. Mama had them things. I hated them 
darn things. 'Cause there wasn't nothing in them. There wasn't anything in them that I wanted because, 
afc2020009_021—Jimmy Ampsacher interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

there was some, but I hear people talk about how much they have learned or seen over their 20 or 30 
years. They hadn't seen nothing.  
 
JA  58:09 
I'd born 1946, the end of the war. People in Washington, DC—I remember living in Amish country. We 
were still riding the horse and buggy. Now, the Amish still ride the horse and buggy. But everybody else 
left them behind. You take from that, too. . . We've been through two other wars, three other wars, 
space. All types of aircraft, all types of boats. All types of television, computer-generated this, 
computer-generated that. And I can't grip it. I can't put my mind around it. And it's just—in these 75 
years I have seen a lot. But you know, that’s the way the world is. I have to live with it or live out here. 
I'd rather live out here. 
 
KC  59:16 
Can you say something about the satisfaction you get from working with your hands? 
 
JA  59:25 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. There's nothing any—My my kids and my wife are the only thing that give me joy. 
And when somebody brings me something that nobody else can fix. I'll fix it. And while I take a pile of 
wood and build a boat and see somebody go out in that boat and enjoy it. Everybody can't that.  
 
JA  1:00:01 
I don't need no plans. I don't need this. I just go build it. I got it in my head. I don't know where it came 
from. But I've always been that way. And I built cars, I built airplanes. I've done everything. But not 
quite everything. I'm still working on now, still going space.  
 
JA  1:00:23 
But that's the pleasure that I get. That's it. I enjoy. I enjoy seeing them come home and actually have to 
pick up a screwdriver to put their computer table together [mimics groan]. But it didn't jump out of the 
box and your magic button, it didn't go together did it? No, it still has mechanical fastener. So yeah, that 
and then the two two grand youngins. Yeah, that's—To be able to do and to think. And to be aggravating 
and contentions as I am sometime and alienated [phone rings] and you whatever you want to call it. 
Yeah, I I get that. That's about it for satisfaction. I'm going to do it my way or what. That's it. Its worked 
so far so why change it?  
 
KC  1:01:28 
We ask everyone this question, it's it's a little goofy but— 
 
JA  1:01:32 
I didn't do it.

KC  1:01:35 
You're innocent. Do you have a favorite tool?  
 
JA  1:01:40 
Pocket knife. I got Granddaddy's pocket knife. Take that pocket knife, I can go anywhere, I can do 
anything I want to. 
 
JG  1:02:01 
Is there anything else you want to make sure we get on tape? About repair, about the island? 
 
JA  1:02:08 
No, just enjoy it while you're here is all I can tell you. And when you come back ___ we can talk about 
something else.
