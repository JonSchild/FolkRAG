My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguards '( other day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilm' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out in " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all, 
put up me hands to catch a " fly, ' 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball 
I 
thought to San Francisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I

But thin the gang began to howl,

An' they rubbed me down with a

AIN'T YOU GOT A- CHEEK: 
By ROBERT McKAy.

Oh, I 
love a 
maiden, she's fair as can be, 
Her hair is nut brown and her boot No. 3, 
Her cheeks are as red aii .the'blossording-rose;.! 
Joy follows her, foinstePs wherever she goes, 
In her is all happinesa'earth can bestow: 
I 
can't understand why sheteaSes me so;" 
For when I 
would kiss her, this' sly little puss? 
On ler lips puts her finger an-d 
answers ni-e-thus—

Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to,ine, so, 
No, I 
won't let you, now please; 
let me go,' 
I'll be " mad" and to you I'll neVer speak,' 
You're " horrid," you're " awful," ain't you got 
a 
cheek! 
It's awful, when for a 
careSs you're inclined„ 
A. maiden should act so unjust arid Unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
ain snre, 
The nower received will be, value(' the more, 
And thus they're so atlful and - 
clintliWthe'elires, 
When we know theY'N'N;otird' like'to" as' well as

Some day we'll be married, Oh, thrice happy day 
Then all affectation will be cast away ;

Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's Wild Alarms, 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom suprome, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream-, 
I'll kiss her, caress her, do just as I-pleaser' 
And will not be amazed by such words as these—

Never Mind It Is Al] For The 13est. 
Respectfully subscribed to ROBERT` McKay. 
Words and =sic by 
11anny BENNETT. 
How many old maxims I 
constantly hear, 
Which I 
can't put to practical use, • 
They ruffle my feelings and grate on my ear, 
A 
sort of continual abuse, 
I 
hate these state saws—they're the bane of my 
life, 
They deprive me of comfort and rest; 
But the one most odious to me is this— 
" 
Never mind ; it is all for the best." 
There's always sonic wiseacre standing about, 
Ever ready to give me adVice, 
He'll bring up old sayings—a 
hundred or more, 
As if one of them would not suffice .; 
When my better half had three children at once, 
He so anxious to cheer the distress.ed, 
Met me on the street and consolinglY said— 
Never mind; it is all for the best." 
My mother-in-law died a 
short time ago, 
And I 
saw a 
good chance to get -sq:mtre, 
I 
knew that this " sympathizing' friend of mine 
Would make haste to relieve me of care, 
He entered the house with elongated phiz, 
And commenced, " friend, I 
know your oppressed," 
But stopped when I 
murmered with saintly repose— 
" 
Never mind; it is all for the best." 
THE GRAND REVIEW. 
Written by ROBERT M CKAY for Miss M OLLIE W ILSON, and sung by her 
with great success. 
-Upon Broadway, the other day, 
A

With banners gay in bright array, 
And music in the air, 
The Stripes and Stars the Son's of Mars, 
Held up like patriots true, 
As stiff as starch the boys did march— (Repeat.) 
Out in the Grand Review!

As up Broadway in bright array, 
Marched on each gallant band; 
Now if you'll list an hold your whist,

Each martiat host, Columbia's boast, —(Repeat.) 
Out in the Grand Review! 
The " Ziegel Guard" and 
Awkward Squad 
Took part in the parade, 
As did likewise those dizzy guys, 
" 
The Matinee Brigade,' 
The S. 0. T.'s' seemed quite at ease, 
Despite the awful noise, 
And following came 'midst loud acclaim, 
The " Bowld Hibernian Boys." 
CHORIJS.—Hurrah hurrah! and hoop-a-la, etc. 
The " Hoolahan's " anci " Monahan's," 
Like Thompson were " On Hand."

HERIDAN. 
Words aLd Music. 
You've heard of me, I'm sure you have, 
Or sect me on the street, 
I'm nevei absent from my post, 
;'m always on my beat. 
Tne iadies, b:ess their little hearts, 
I 
call thein all my pets, 
All recognize in me, one of 
The corner Statuettes. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there's no mistaking me; occupation I 
have 
none. 
I've an aged mother, and a 
young sister, who work 
every day. 
They support me. 
They earn jointly enough to 
give them a 
very economical living, and me a 
very comfortable 
one. 
They live in a 
fourui story tenement house. I 
have a 
room on a 
fashionable street, and eat my meals when I 
can get 
them. 
After allowing them a 
small portion of their earnings 
for their food and room, I 
take the larger remaining sum, 
which enables to dress very acceptably, and— 
CHORUS. 
On—street I 
stand all day, 
From early, morn„ till sun does set, 
Quizzing the girls that pass that way; 
I'm a 
corner Statuette. 
My style of dress is all my own, 
That you must admit; 
My hat! my coat! my vest I 
my pants! 
Observe their perfect fit, 
My collar too, a 
model of 
Grace, elegance and style; 
It's copied by my rivals, 
Who haunt me all the while. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's very annoying to have a 
set of brainless 
idiots dogging you about, trying to find out your tailor, to make 
your azqiiaintance, etc. 
I 
shun them all; 
I've no desire to

I'm thinking of a 
morning, 
In the distant long, ago, - 
When hope smiled on my fife's dawning, 
For I

Passing fair and dreaming eyed, 
Ruby smiles and eyes love laden. 
Revealing thoughts her tongue denied.

In the sweet bye and bye, 
We will meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet bye and bye,

THE NOBBY YOUNG FELLOVv. 
Written by ROBERT McKnr. 
I'm a 
nobby young fellow 
I'd have ye to know, 
There's nothing about me 
That's careless or slow, 
My form is encased in 
The finest of clothes, 
The girls all declare 
I'm the finest of beaux, 
An' as I 
pass by them 
Upon the Broadway, 
You can hear the fair damsels 
To each othersay: 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, ain't be a 
nobby young fellow," 
But of my good looks I'm not vain, 
In my coat I've a 
blushing red rose bud, 
In my hand I 
swing lightly my cane, 
I 
drink " Extra Dry " when I'm thirsty, 
In my pocket I've always a 
dime, 
You can bet all the wealth you can borrow, 
I'm a 
thoroughbred sport every time. 
'Tother night I 
dropped in at a 
rollicking ball, 
On the East side of town at the Walhalla Hall, 
The gang says ' whatis it?" when a 
bum full of gin 
Says, " 0, the door was left open, the wind 
blew it in, 
"Let's cut it open and see what's inside," 
I 
made for the doK,when I 
got out they cried: 
Crtonus—Oh, ain't he a 
nohby young fellow, etc.

With ringlets of gold-brown hair,

On the sward reclining, Birdie,

In the old time long ago, 
Here by the singing river, 
Where Mary's lying low.

"DOLLARS." 
Words and Music by ROBERT lIcKAY. 
There is a 
word you can hear almost every day, 
Every one longs for it, go where you may, 
it's sought by the rich*, 
by the poor, by the gay, 
In fact over everything it has a 
sway, 
I 
see you have all guessed the subject 'ere this, 
It's dollars, to have them is certainly bliss, 
It's the source of all trouble, the bottom of crimp, 
And dollars the motto you'll everywhere find: 
What was it that opened the White House to Hayes, 
Defrauded another man out of the place, 
What was it took Stanley thro' Africa's wilds, 
That stirs up the muse of G. Washington Childs, 
What was it that tempted the widow so gay, 
When she married the millionaire, Lord, tonic:- day, 
What was it, but ah, it is plain to your minds, 
'Twas dollars the motto one everywhere finds. 
Why is it that Beecher looks after the lantibs, 
That Murphy discourses on shakes and jim-jams, 
Why is it Johannes, the Count off his nut, 
On the stage of New York is permitted to strut. 
Why is it That Moody and Sankey exert, 
And cry " Halelujah" and sing " Hold the Fort," 
Why is it, but ah, I'm sure everyone knows, 
That dollars the rage as they put on their bows. 
Why was such attention to Gen'l Grant paid, 
What was it that started the late excise raid, 
Why is it that Conkling and Mathews and Blaine, 
in the Senate at Washington are now raising coin, 
One thing more my dear friends Iwould say ' ere I 
go, 
,it's,a fact and'I think it is well you should know, 
You may think I 
do this for the love of the flung, 
But without the dollars you may bet I 
wouldn't sing.

Has won from me my heart, 
She's as fair as fair can be, 
An' she's lately came froin'Ireland, 
Across from the ould dart, 
She's promised she'd wed me, 
Her eyes are blue as heaven's hue, 
She's got the sweetest name, 
0, I

Ould Erin's pretty posy, 
She's handsome but not vain.

She's so fair none compare, 
With my little Rosy, 
No, there's not another one 
Half so fair to me, 
Pretty pearl, my fresh girl, 
Love and truth combined, 
Won't it be a 
happy day 
When I 
call her mine. 
If you saw this little daisy, 
She'd surely set you crazy,

YOUR pOOKET-BOOKt IS' YOURNBEST

Price 10 cents, 
Word., by'Arrilitm W. FRENCH. 
Music by A. Cm,. 
There are friends you deem true, they will linger near you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day, they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As vou journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you climb or descend. 
You will see it some day, I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeod, 
Ever rea.dy to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they, 
would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send: 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pOcketbook" was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, heg6es at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him .a year, after that he gets clear, 
For his pocketbook is his best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
Banjo Solo. As sung by JAs. SAmeom 
I 
WENT to see my Jenny dear the other night at eight, 
Her Pa and Ma were in the room, we chatted till quite late, 
The old man said when off to bed, you know the clock is slow, 
I 
knew it was a 
hint for me, but I 
couldn't take it so. 
Won't you ever tumble, won't you ever drop, 
Cheese it cully, sherry your nibs, or I 
will call a 
cop, 
1, 2, 3, bounce him or hit him with a 
mop. 
I 
couldn't help but tumble then, but still I 
didn't drop, 
I 
called again next evening to see my Jenny dear. 
She met me at the front door I 
thought that she looked queer 
She told me that her cousin had called to spend the eve, 
And consequently for his sake no callers she'd receive, 
Won't you ever tumble, 
c. 
I 
went, right home that very night my pen in hand did take, 
To ask her if she would tell me why to me she'd give tm 
shake. 
I 
asked her to forget, forgive, and all that kind of trash, 
I 
told her just so long I 
lived no other girl I'd mash. 
Won't you ever tumble, ttc.

In an eating-Ouse saloon; 
But now, if you're observing, 
You can see I've changed my tune. 
One day I 
went to Boston, 
To have a 
little fun; 
When they grabbed me for the Jubilee, 
To play the big bass drum. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
always make a 
rumpus, 
When the big bass drum I 
play, 
The big bass drum I 
play, the big bass drum I 
play, 
The folks they like my music, 
They could listen all the day— 
Especially when they hear me 
And my boom, boom, boom! 
When Strauss he played his waltzes, 
And Gilmore led his band; 
The English, French and. Germans, 
All gave him a 
helping hand. 
But in all the foreign countries, 
They couldn't find, a 
one, 
To equal this here darkey, 
And his Jubilee bass-drum.

And such a 
winning way. 
He smiles at MC when he goes by, 
And always looks the same ; 
Stylish, too, indeed he is, 
I'd like to know his nanie. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, yes, he's a 
very nice young man. I 
generally 
meet him about here every afternoon. 
I 
came out to-day par-
ticularly to see him, but I 
wouldn't let him know it for the 
world. 
For these young men tale advantage of our confiding 
love. 
I 
don't see him anywhere. so I'll just step into a 
car, 
ride up and down the street until I 
see him coming, then get 
°At and meet him, as is if ' twere accidental. 
CHORUS. 
For he's so gay and sweet, 
And always looks the same; 
Nobby, and quite stylish, too, 
I 
wish I 
knew his name. 
(Enter ARTHUR SPOONEY.) 
I 
wonder who that lady is 
Whom every day I 
meet? 
Very prAty—stylish, too. 
Such hands, and oh! such feet I 
I'd pluck up courage, speak to her, 
If me she wouldn't blame. 
I'd really give a 
deal to know 
My pretty charmerls.name, 
SHE.—You ask me sir my mane, 
I 
cannot tell it, 
Indignation now I 
must express. 
Jove she's getting angry, 
Now I've done it. 
I've got myself into a 
pretty muss. 
SHE.-Oh, I 
believe he's going away. 
HE.—I 
will retire. 
SHE.— You're angry. 
HE.—No. 
SHE.—Don't leave me sir just yet, 
I'll tell you if you'll promise keep it secret, 
My pa and ma they call me Mignonette. 
Clioacs. 
HE.—You're sweeter than the Hower 
They've named you after. 
SHE.—I'm sure this happy day I'll ne'er forget, 
There's a 
band of opera music in her laughter. 
My pretty little darling Mignonette. 
[Dance. 
During symphony, MIGNONETTE: steals ARTHUR'S Watch and 
Chain, puts it in her bosom. 
SINGS: 
SHE.— It's getting late, you'll therefore please excuse me. 
HE.—You'll surely let me see you to the door. 
SHE.—Well really pa and ma are so particular, 
Adieu. 
To-morrow here at four. 
[Exit. 
HE.—Attrevoir, my darling little treasuer. 
You're pretty face I 
ne'er can forget. 
SPOKEN.—By 
Jove! 
My watch! my chain! both are missing I 
I'm robbed! Who has done it! 
Mignonette! 
Police! Police! 
Not one man near, of course not. 
My visit here I 
very much 
regret. 
Another lesson boys, don't forget it. 
Beware of sweet 
light fingered Mignonette, 
CHORUS. 
For she's so gay and stylish, too, 
Always looks the same; 
Pretty as a 
picture, too, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the next time I 
see her I'll pluck up courage 
and speak to her. 
But should she snub me! 
Oh, well, I 
won't be the first who has received a 
similar encouragement 
Nothing ventured, nothing won. 
Ah! No 1 Yes it is. b) 
Jove! 
There she. is now getting, out of that car, and she's 
coming this way, too! 
Oh, all my boasted courage is gone. 
Be quiet, trembling heart.

Business of trying to pass each other. 
MIGNONETTE drops her 
handkerchief. 
ARTHUR picks it up, gives it to her.

UNCLE. 
SCENE. - A plain room. Table and- chairs,L. Small screen 
R., third E., behind which are boxing-gloves, kehoc 
clubs, and a 
large wooden or rubber ball. 
ENTER, M ARIA, R. 
1. E. 
Maria.—Oh, dear, what will become of me! I'm afraid 
I 
shall die an old maid! My uncle is so cross and so hard 
to please, he frightens all my beaux away, and calls them 
jackanapes and ninnys,—says he don't want any kid-glove 
dandies or popinjays to marry his niece. 
Yes, every beau 
that calls on me is obliged to go through a 
rigid examina-
tion by my uncle; and, if they can't stand the ordeal and 
his terrible passion, he throws them out of the window 
or pitches them down stairs. 
Oh, if I 
could only find a 
beau that had the nerve to face him, and would n't get 
frightened at a 
gust of wind. 
Yes: my uncle says I 
must 
marry with a 
man of nerce, who ain't afraid of nothing or 
nobody, and willing to get his clothes all torn to pieces, in 
defence of a 
woman. 
Yes: that's the kind of a 
man I'm 
looking for, and if there's anybody here possessing those 
qualities, let him step forward to the 'rescue. (Singing 
heard outside.) 
Ah! I 
hear the voice of one of my ad-
43 
[A MAN OF NERVE.—Continnedi 
mirera, singing under the window. [A 
duet can be sung 
here, with voice without.] Yes : it's that insipid dandy who 
I 
met at the last ball. 
Well, he begged so hard to let him 
call on me, that I 
consented ; and I 
suppose I 
must be civil 
and let him come in. 
But it will be the same old thing 
over,—as soon as my uncle discovers him he will throw 
him out of the window or pitch him down stairs. 
ENTER, TAFFY. 
Taffy (with carpet-bag and umbrella). — Good evening! 
Well, I'm here, according to my promise. 
.Mitria.—Yes; so I 
see! [Aside. — And he looks as if he 
had come to stay a 
week or two!] 
Taffy—(Saunters op to her; MIYMIN his carpet- bag and um-
brella oneside).—Well, how do you do? I'm just as glad to 
see you as if I'd found a 
pocket-book, or somebody had 
hit me with ahammer. 
Maria ( aside).—{I 
'
in afraid be won't be disappointed 
when my uncle finds him here.] (
Both take chairs and sit.) 
I 
am very well, thank you. How have you been since I 
last saw you! 
Taify.—Oh, I've been gay as a 
rosette! (Loud 'noise of 
some one pounding without.) 
Maria (ring and alarmed).—Oh, mercy! that is my 
uncle; 
Taffy.—What's he doing? 
/
11kii.4.—(..3onaing up stairs! 
l'a' y— Is that the way he comes up-stairs! 
Maria.—Yes: when he don't feel well. 
[Aside.—And 
i'a‘stire sign that he is mad about something, and I'm 
afraid he 
murder this man if he should see him, for he 
hasn't had a 
victim tO Vent his wrath upon for a 
week and 
he's boiling over I]; 
44 
Taffy. — I ' in always sorry for anybody who don't feel 
well. 
He ought to get cured. 
Maria (aside).—[Yes : 
I 
wish somebody would cure him, 
so I 
could have some peace.] 
Oh, I ' in afraid ! 
Tilly. — Afraid! What kind of a 
thing is that! 
_Writ( (amazed).—Why, don't you know what afraid 
means! 
Taffy. — No : what is it ? 
31aria ( a 'oozed). — Why, it's to get up and run away 
from danger, or anything that threatens to do you harm! 
To 
ffy.-011, I 
thought it was some complaint like the 
measles or whooping cough ! 
Haria ( N/trprixed).—IITell, he's the first man that I 
ever 
saw that did n't know what the word " afraid " means! 
Well, I 
must say, he is the most singular individual I 
ever 
met before. 
Why, when any of those other fellows came 
o 
see me, and heard the noise of my uncle coming up-
stairs, they would get up and get so quick you couldn't see 
them for the dust ! (
Sitx up cbmer to him, and puts her arm

What seems to be 
the 111:1 t

.1/0/-:,; . -- oh, he's afflicted with a 
terrible complaint. 
• 
Terrible!" What 's 
that? What kind of a 
coin-
plaint is that? 
Maria. — W hy he has spells come over him at times, and 
he breaks things all to pieces, and throws anybody out of 
the window that CMIles in his way. 
In fact he has been 
known to chew a 
man's head off, without the least provo-
cation. 
Taffy (laughing). — Ha! ha! What a funny complaint 
that is. 
I 
am afflicted with it, myself, sometimes. 
Maria ( surprised). — Have you got it now? 
A 
MAN OF -XERVE.—(Continued.) 
fiaffy. — Well, no; I 
never have it in presence of ladies; 
but when I 
meet a 
man who is troubled with that com-
plaint, either he or me gets cured before we part. 
Maria (aside).—[He 's 
the strangest man I 
ever saw. I 
am getting quite interested in him. I 
believe I'm falling 
in love with him (
puts her arm around Ms neck). 
Zzffy. —I 
feel as if I 
was up to my neck in honey with 
a 
boxing-glove under my nose! 
I've brought along a 
pic-
ture-book to show you (
pulls out a 
pack tf cards and shows 
then?, to Maria). 
There's a 
king,— it takes two aces to beat 
a 
pair of them; and there's a Jack (
keeps on showing to 
Maria the different cards as)— 
ENTER, UNCLE [with a 
cane in his hand]. 
Uncle (looks about mysteriously).—Ah! what is this I 
see 
before me! (
discovers Maria and Taffy). 
My niece and a 
lover! 
Now, by the dogs, the work goes bravely on! I 
have been longing for this luxury. I 
am spoiling for some 
one to wreak my wrath upon, and relieve me of my sore 
afflictions and troubles of the day! 
Ha! I 
will toy with 
him for awhile, and then I 
will tear him all to pieces, put 
him in an envelope and dispatch him at once! (
raps cane 
on the table.) 
Maria (jumps up in alarm). Fly! fly! it is my uncle— 
(runs off quickly, R.) 
Taffy.—Fly ! 
fly I 
what's that? 
(Uncle 'steals up and slaps him on the back.) 
Taffy. — Shoo fly! 
Uncle.—Excuse me! I 
hope I 
have n't disturbed your 
little game of love? 
Taffy.—Love ! 
What 's 
that ? what's love? 
Uncle.—Well, here 's 
a 
fellow that don't know the mean-
46 
ing of love! 
Ah, that's too thin, my boy. 
I've been 
there, myself. 
I know what it is to be in love! Come 
hither, I 
wish to speak to you ! (Both take chairs and sit at 
table, Uncle pulls out cigar case and hands Taffy a 
cigar.) 
Have a 
smoke, sir? 
Taffy.—Well, I 
don't mind if I 
do (
takes cigar and lights 
it and leans back in, his chair and smokes). 
He seems a 
pleasant sort of a 
man. 
Uncle.—Well, sir, from all appearances, and what I 
have 
seen, you are in love with my niece, and I 
wish to have a 
few words to say to you on the subject (
slaps cane on the 
table). 
And I 'm a 
man of a 
very few words, sir! and I 
mean business, sir! business, sir! 
Taffy (indifferent).—Business! 
What's that ? 
What's 
business ? 
Uncle.—[Aside.—Well, be takes things very cool, I 
must 
say! anybody else would have jumped out of their skin.] 
I 
mean to say. sir, I 
mean business ! business, sir! (
Slaps 
cane On table.) 
Taffy — Well, you said that before! 
Uncle.—Did I? 
Well, sir, I 
say it again! I 
mean busi-
ness. 
I 
wish to understand, sir, what are your intentions 
in regard to my niece? Do you wish to marry with her, or 
are you only fooling with her to fill up time? For, if that's 
your game, sir (
pulls out large horse-pistol and points it at 
Taffy'shead), I'll put the contents of this into your head. 
Taffy (inch fferent). — What's that you hold in your hand ? 
Uncle.— That, sir, is a 
revolver. 
Taffy.— W hat's it for ? 
.Uncle.—To shoot men with,—shoot them dead, sir! 
Taffy.—I. thought it was a 
stomach pump. Down where 
I 
come from they don't shoot men, only mad dogs and 
"bars." 
Uncle.—And, pray sir, where might you come from? 
A MAN or NERVE.—(Continued.) 
Taffy.—Powder Creek, 
Lightning County, State of 
Blazes. 
Uncle.—ladeed! I 
never heard of that place before. 
[ 
Aside. — He don't seem to scare worth a 
cent at the sight 
of a 
pistol, and I'm hungry for a 
fight. 
I 
guess I'll try 
him with my kehoe clubs, and bounce him higher than a 
kite (
goes behind screen and brings out the clubs, one of them 
stuffed.) 
Did you ever see any of these things, down 
where you come from (
hands him the stuffed club. 
Taffy.—(examines club.) 
What's that? 
Uncle.—That 's 
a 
kehoe club. 
(Swings his up and down.) 
Taffy.—I 
thought it was an umbrella! 
What's it for? 
Uncle.—That, sir, is to exercise with and develop the 
muscle. 
Taffy.—Down where I 
come from they hew wood and 
draw water for exercise (
gets up and swings the club around. 
Uncle drops /118 club and stoops to pick it up, and Taffy strikes 
him in the rear with his club and knocks him sprawling on 
the floor.) 
Uncle.—Hold on, sir! hold on! 
What do you mean, 
sir, by striking me with that club. 
Mffy.—Well, I 
hope you ' 11 excuse my awkwardness, I 
never handled one before! 
Uncle (gets up and rubs himself). — Well, sir, I 
wish you 
would be more careful. [Aside.—I 
don't think I'll use the 
club for the present; I'll try him with my boxing-gloves.] 
(Gets boxing-gloves.) 
Did you ever see any of these things 
down where you come from (
hands him a 
pair of the gloves 
and puts on'pair.) 
Taffy. — What 's 
these? (Examines gloves and puts them on.) 
Uncle.—Those, sir, are boxing-gloves, to practice the art 
of self-defence. 
48 
Taffy. — I 
thought they were puddings. 
Down where I 
came from they don't have time to practice. 
If anybody 
don't behave themselves they haul off and give it to them 
like this (
strikes at Uncle and knocks hint sprawling; they 
spar about and Uncle cries out)—" Hold up ! I ' ve busted 
one of my gloves. (Both stop and take off glores and sit at 
table.) 
Unde.—[Aside.—Confound this fellow; he 's 
the toughest 
lover I've met with yet; but I 
won't give in to him. 
I'll 
shoot him first. 
Yes; 
shoot him on the spot—( rises and 
steps off « fop paces from the table.) 
Now 
just sit still for a 
moment and 1 ' 11 show you something that you never saw 
down where you come from—(pulls out pistol). 
Taffy.—(Smokes on his cigar, places his feet upon the table, 
fearless and indifferent to what is going on.) '
Well, what 
are you going to show me now? (//o/d out his arm with 
cigar in his hand.) 
Uncle.—I'm going to show you how nice I 
can take that 
cigar out of your hand (
takes aim and fires). 
Taffy (looks at his arm and feels of it).—I 
say, old Buffer, 
what was in that pistol? it's gone into my arm. 
Uncle—A leaden bullet, sir! 
[Aside.—I 
wish it had 
gone into his head.] 
Taffy (smiling).— Well, down where I 
come from I've 
got a 
little brother, five yea's of age, and if he could n't do 
better than that, I 'd 
pin his ears back and swallow him 
whole. 
-Well, as I 
don't want to be encumbered with any-
body's property but my own, 1'II just cut this bullet out— 
(pulls out knife and pretends to cut out the bullet from his 
arm; he has a 
bullet in his hand and holds it up to view). 
There, old Buffer is your bullet, and you can have it. 
I 
don't want, it (throws it on the table). 
The next time you 
try to shoot, don't be 
so cross-eyed in your elbows. 
Naafi.

Smokes on his cigar in perfect indifference.) 
have you g, 
anymore toys you want to show me? 
Undo (amazed).—{Aside. — Well, if he ain't the toughest 
nut I 
ever came across. 
But I'll get the best of him this 
time. 
I've got a 
torpedo in the closet that will blow him 
to thunder.] 
Yes; I've got something in the closet. 
I'll 
get it and show it to you (
goes behind the screen and brings 
out (1 
lame wooden or rubber ball, puts it on the table and sits 
in chair). 
Taffy ( indifferent).—What's that? 
Uncle.—[Aside.—Now, when I 
tell him what that is, he ' 11 
be frightened to death.] 
That's what they call a 
torpedo 
or bomb-shell ! 
Taffy (jumps up aniazed).—A torpedo ! 
Uncle.—[Aside.—I 
thought so! I've got him this time, 
at last. 
I 
thought I'd frighten him! 
Taffy.— Why, down where I 
come from they use them 
to play ball with (
suddenly grabs up the ball and tosses and 
catches it. 
Uncle (jumps up in alarm). — Look out ! look out! be 
careful! If you should drop that it would blow you to 
thunder. 
/alfg.—Oh, what are you giving us! ( Tosses up the ball 
till he gets behind the screen. Sudden report from, a 
pistol is 
heard, a 
clammy man is seen to go up and come down behind 
the screen. 
Taffy rolls out on the floor, gets up and brushcs 
off his clothes with his hands and conies forward). 
Well, 
that's the loudest fire cracker ever I 
heard !

cries out load).

While I 
have to seek my living, 
In the mighty far off West. 
There's old Buffalo, 
The swate town of Chicago, 
On the Er-i.e canal, 
Shure I'll have to go to say. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
I'll be bewailing, 
Hy strength ' twill be a

Wid hunger I'll be ailing, 
Since the soup house moved awee, 
Success attind yoti, Binnett, 
May your Herald never die, 
You kept me from hard work and WO, 
Upon the Boulevard. 
To work I'ei never stooP, 
While I 
ate your meat and soup, 
Oh to break stones in a 
quarry, 
think it's awful hard. 
There's many an honest man, 
You've oft filled his dinner-can, 
You put sunshine in his family, 
lt meal-
times every day. 
Oh! I'll be bewailing, el& 
remember well the station-horisa, 
Where I 
always slept, 
On the daffy down feathers. 
That were in the iron bed. 
The wharf down at the river, 
Where I'd crawl under out'v the wet, 
Neath longshoremen, fishermen 
. And canallers gentle tread. 
I'm called a 
snoozer, 
13y ev'ry ould bruiser, 
I'm as hungry as a 
mule, 
I 
could ate a 
bale of hay. 
Oh ! I'll be bewailing, er.o.

NAUGHTY DUTCH BUM. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
You kave heard I 
am awfully naughty, 
I 
can't help but say it is true, 
I'm a _nasher, you see, with the ladies, 
And a 
friend to the old women too; 
I'm the favorite at all the parties, 
In the ball room I 
stand number one, 
And the young girls will murmur so sweetly-
- He is such a 
naughty old burn. 
CHORUS. 
So you see I'm so awfully naughty, 
Oh I 
so naughty, and so haughty; 
The policemen between sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty old burn. 
I 
met a 
young charmer one evening, 
As the setting sun rose in the West, 
- 
She looked and she winked her eyes -- that way, 
Then she quietly pulled down my vest. 
We were leaning so nice on the water, 
But she shook the son of a 
gun. 
But I 
stole her false teeth when she left Me, 
For I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see, etc. 
You notice my.ulster's a, new one, 
A 
gift from •Napoleon the First, 
And I 
often think, yes, and wonder 
Whether it or my dice looks the worst: 
It's my style and my hioks, not my clothing, 
That make ladies easily won, 
I 
have mashed Mr. Barnum's " what is it," 
For I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see etc.,

Written by En. HARRIGAN for CHAS VIVIAN, 
Musie by DAVE BRAMAN. 
Pr's very queer when I 
came here 
I 
was christened right away. 
When I 
walk out I 
hear folks shout, 
" 
Lord Taffy 
Hi, I

So I

Really acknowledged a

Don't let it slip. I'll give you the tip, 
I'm Lord Arthur Gooseberry Incognitio. 
In Houston Stieet I 
had a 
treat 
At a 
place called Barry 
I'd a 
drop of beer with a 
chap so queer,' 
Who wished me to foot the bills. 
'Twas then 1 
became indignant, 
Said " I'm a 
Lord, sir. you must know!" , 
I 
heard a 
shout throw Taffy out 
Incognitio 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc. 
At my hotel I'm treated well, 
oh. in fact, quite royally; 
-
It's quite a 
lark—they're in the dark 
As to my nobility. 
So I 
register Lord, ah I

blank, 
From London so and so, 
To hear them laugh and say it's Taff

Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
AIR—"Johnny come Marching _Home." 
I'LL sing to you of a 
hig Injun, 
Choctaw! oh, law! 
He really was a 
number one, 
Oh, la! hi, yah! 
You never heard such a 
terrible yaw, 
Or felt the weight of such a 
paw, 
Yet he dearly loved a 
little squaw 
Called Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
[llepe,•it) 
17his Injun now was seven miles high 
I 
guess, more or less. 
His head it almost touched the sky, 
I 
guess, oh, yes 
He jumped ten miles at a 
single hound, 
Although his feet weighed fifty pound, 
And he danced a 
jig when he heard the sound 
Of Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
Lfeept,at.1 
Kermoodle she loved her big Nun 
With regard, so hard! 
That she and he agreed to be one, 
All right! that night! 
But up came a 
soldier all in blue, 
And shot Mr. Injun through and through, 
Till he yelled out hoop-de,dooden-doo, 
At Kennoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
[Repeat.) 
The Injun did the bucket kick, 
The shct made him drop, 
Kermoodle cried 'till she was sick, 
All wet with regret. 
She saw the Injun under ground all right. 
Then gave a 
scream with all her might, 
And married the soldier out of spite, 
Did Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo,

SG 
meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
.0 adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection,,, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
