OUR DEAR OLD SOUTHERN HOME. 
Originally composed by CRAM. A. 
SAVILLE, and sung by SAVILLE tt 
BENNETT, in all the principle Theatres in the United States. 
I've come bock to my dear old home, 
The place I 
ever longed to see, 
Where my dear old wife and I 
would sit, 
how happy then were we; 
The magnolias bloomed around our cabin door, 
The mockingbird sang its sweetest lay. 
And the piccanines danced and shag arottnd our cabin 
Indeed to me that was a 
happy day. 
Poor— 
CHORUS: 
I've come back, yes, I've come back. 
No more from home I'll roam. 
Yes, I've come back; yes, I've come back, 
To my dear old Southern home. 
When mosso sold the old man South, 
My poor old heart was filled with pain, 
When he bid inc good-bye the tears came to my eyes, 
For I 
thought I'd ne'er see him again. 
But he's come back to his dear old home, 
No more from me he will roam. 
Yes, he's come back to live and die 
in our dear old Southern home. 
(Chorus.) 
Originally composed by CHAS. A. 
SAviLLE, and sung with immense 
success at the NOVELTY THEATRE, N. Y. City. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place I 
want to see, 
The place I 
used to wander, 
It was so dear to me; 
I 
was happy with old massa, 
When living in the lane, 
So I'se traveling back to Georgia. 
I 
will say goodbye to you. 
CHORUS: 
I'm traveling back,—Sym. 
Yes, traveling back,—Sym. 
I'm gwine back again, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
For to see my home again. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place where I 
was born; 
Where I 
used to hoe the cotton, 
The sugar cane and corn; 
I'm getting old and feeble, 
And tired of roaming, too; 
So I'm gwine back to Georgia, 
I 
will saygood-bye to you. 
(Chorus, 
As Sung by CHAS. A. 
SAVILLE with great success throughout the 
United States. 
The little old log cabin, 
Is standing down dar still; 
Where my old dog lies sleeping, 
'Neath the creek that turns the mill; 
Old massa says, forever, 
With him 1 
must remain; 
And when I 
die, he'll lay me, 
Down among the sugancane. 
Criont;s: 
Oh, dar let me rest, 
Oh, dar let me rest, 
And never wake again; 
For dar'll be no care or sorrow, 
Down among the sugar-cane. 
The darkies used to gather 
Around my cabin door, 
They sang and danced so sweetly, 
That I 
ne .er could join them more; 
But there's heaps of consolation, 
To him that must remain; 
I'm passing to my resting, 
Down among the sugar-cane. ( Chorus). 
Oh, darkies gather round me, 
My eyes are growing dim; 
Just sing to me so sweetly, 
One of them old Methodist hymns; 
I 
hear the Banjo ringing, 
how sweet are its refrains; 
To him that is a 
gwine 
Down among the sugar-cane, (Chorus), 
Originally Composed by CHARLES A. 
SAVILLE, and sung by 
SAVILLE & BENNETT with great success at W OOD'S 
:NOVELTY THEATRE, ALBANY, N. 
V. 
I've traveled many weary miles, 
Since Hannah I 
have seen; 
But the old man has come back again, 
Though years have intervened-
When I 
left the old plantation, 
Poor old Hannah she did cry; 
Please, massa, don't you part us now, 
Or the old man he will die, 
Clionus: 
The old man ne is feeble now, 
And always has been true; 
Please massa don't you part us now, 
And we will both bless you. 
But massa sold the old man South, 
Far from his dear old home; 
And from me be was parted, 
And I 
was left alone; 
But he's come back to his home to die, 
The Lord his soul will save; 
And soon the old man will be laid, 
With me in the cold grave, 
((liortts,) 
Originally composed by SAVILLE & BENsE'rr, and sung with great 
success in all the leading theatres in America. 
I'm traveling back to my good old home, 
That stands down by the mill; 
Where my dear old wife 'and I 
was born, 
And our children around us did play: 
But those days, alas, are gone and past, 
From my dear old wife I 
was sold away: 
I'd like to be again, down among the sugar cane, 
In my dear cabin home so far away. 
Cnortus: 
But those days, alas, are gone and past, 
From my dear old wife I 
was sold away; 
I'd like to be again, down among the sugar cane; 
In my dear cabin home so far away. 
Old massa sold me far from home, 
Far from all that I 
held dear; 
My poor old wife, the joy of my life, 
Left me in sorrow and in tears; 
But I've come back to the home to die, 
With gray hairs on my head; 
For the old man's heart is broken now, 
For both my wife and my piccaninies dead. 
(Chorus).

A 
Leaf of Ivy from my Mother's Grave. 
Originally composed by CHARLES A. 
SAVILLE, and sung with great 
success in all the leading theatres in America. 
I 
went to Greenwood yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I 
knelt beside the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave; 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow • 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
CHORUS: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And ' tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was not welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
did roam; 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save 
Is this little leaf of Ivy, 
A 
leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave. 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home; 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above. 
Where we'll ne'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endless love. 
(Chorus). 
MARY KELLY'S RIVAL. 
Written by FRANK HART, and dedicated ICO SAVILLE 8: BENNETT, 
Aged Negro Delineators. 
You've heard of Mary Kelly, 
The girl that's got the beau; 
Now if you hold your breath a 
while, 
I 
will let you know; 
About a 
little colleen, 
So beautiful to see; 
And on the 17th of March, 
Why then she'll marry me. 
CHORUS: 
She's as fair, you would stare, 
At her mass of golden hair; 
Her beauty it would you almost stifle; 
When she walks on the street, 
Every one she meets, 
Says there's Katie Rourke, 
There's Mary Kelly' Rival. 
When we walk out on Sunday, 
The people at us stare; 
And then they ask each other, 
Who is that handsome couple there? 
You'll hear them whisper softly, 
And point back at us so; 
Saying that's Mary Kelly's Rival, 
And the young man is her beau. 
(Chorus). 
The boys they all get jealous, 
When we go out to walk; 
But we don't care a 
fig for them, 
We let them have their talk; 
At all the Balls and Picnics, 
You bet we are the go; 
For my girl outshines Kelly, 
And I 
can down her beau. 
I'll sing unto you of the topics of the day, 
And before I 
retire, a. few words I 
will say; 
And when I'm done singing, why you can judge, then, 
1 
Whether or not I 
have sung of our country's great men; 
If you meet a 
man who will help you in need, 
And stretch forth his hand, he's a 
good friend, indeed; 
if you ask for a 
dollar, he says yes, you can bet, 
He's one of the men we should never forget. 
I'll speak of a 
man of whom you've all learned, 
lie was an honest President all through his long term; 
An exponent of peace, honest, upright and just, 
A man in whom we placed all our confidence and trust; 
He was murdered in Washington a 
few years ago. 
how deeply our country felt that sad blow; 
But I'm sure, my kind friends, his death you regret, 
Old honest Abe Lincoln, we'll never forget. 
I'll speak of a 
man whose excitement is past, 
The State of New Jersey stuck to him to the last; 
He is a 
man whose war record is great, 
I'm sure he will honor old New Jersey State; 
At the battle of Gettysburg he gained great renown, 
lie done all he could to put the late great war down, 
And, although defeated, we'll honor him yet, 
General Winfield Scott Hancock we'll never forget. 
Originally written by FRANK HART, for THOMPSON & BEADY, 
We are the micks of pleasure, 
At shooting we're first-class; 
Our steps are all to measure, 
We've never been surpassed; 
When we are on parade, boys, 
All others we take down; 
I 
tell you we are dandies, 
We're the talk of all the town. 
ClIORIIS: 
Watch us marching, 
How neatly we step out; 
Our style is grand, 
We always know what we're about; 
The flag we carry 
Is never in the shade; 
We look so grand, we take command, 
While in the Micks' parade. 
When we march down 5th Avenue, 
The ladies at us stare; 
And you should see the boquets, 
Come flying through the air; 
God bless the little darlings, 
Of us they're not afraid, 
They always dress up in their best, 
When the Micks are on parade. 
(Chorus). 
DAUNTLESS COTERIE. 
Originally written by FRANK HART for the Dauntless Coterie. 
Sung by SAVILLE & BENNETT. 
A 
jollier set of fellows, 
l'm sure you cannot find; 
Than the boys of the Dauntless Coterie, 
Please bear this in mind; 
At all their Balls and Picnics, 
A 
jolly time you'll see; 
We'll say tra-la, then hip hurrah, 
For the Dauntless Coterie. 
CHORIJS • 
While gliding through the waltz, 
To the music of the band; 
Dancing with the girl you love, 
So happy hand in hand; 
As round and round we go, 
The air is full of glee; 
Now bear in mind, no club you'll find, 
Like the Dauntless Coterie. 
We are no roughs or fighters, 
We all go in for fun; 
If we can't give quiet patties, 
Our motto is give none; 
Come one and all and see us, 
And happy you will be; 
We invite you all to give a 
call, 
To the Dauntless Coterie. (Chorus). 
There's warrior White, our President, 
He is a 
solid man; 
He tries to make it pleasant, 
For every one he can; 
Fun and frolic rare, 
Are at our picnics you will see; 
We've lots of fun, we don't har none ; 
At the Dauntless Coterie. (Choru ,i). 
Composed by Nn 
Goss, and done nightly by Goss and Fox. 
Now if you want to have some fun, 
Come down in the valley to the jubilee, 
And see Clorinda and I 
made one, 
Way down in the valley at the jubilee, 
We're going to be married to-night, 
Down in the valley at the jubilee, 
Come, or you'll miss a 
funny sight, 
Down in the valley at the jubilee. 
CHORUS. 
Then, oh, what fun, 
With niggers prancing, singing, (lancing, 
Oh, what fun down at the jubilee. 
Repeat. 
We'll have a 
band of music there, 
Down in the valley at the jubilee, 
The sweetest music I 
declare, 
Down in the valley at the jubilee, 
A 
left handed fiddle and yellow clarionet, 
Down in the valley at the jubilee, 
A 
banjo, guitar, and a 
dizie cornet, 
Down in the valley at the jubi:ee. 
CIIORUS. 
Then, oh, what fun, 
With niggers prancing, singing, dancing, 
Oh, what fun down at the jubilee. 
Repeat.

Just to Piease the _Boys. 
Composed by Wm. A. HUNTLEY, and sang by ELLA M AYO. 
Some people have peculiar ways, and I 
have some. I 
know, 
I 
don't like swell society, restraint I 
cannot go; 
I've done and will do as I 
please. keep still or make .t 
noise, 
I 
love to please the ladies, but prefer to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, well, ladies never appear perfect in each 
other's eyes; there's always some little fault, whether caused 
by envy, jealousy, or otherwise. 
So, on this occasion I 
waive 
female opinion and intend— 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys ; 
I 
always meant, with good intent, 
To try and please the boys. 
I 
love to sing, to sail, and race, I 
love to skate and dance, 
And love all social parties where they give a 
girl a 
chance ; 
:\ly lady friends find fault because they cannot share my joys, 
And tell me I'm too forward when I 
try to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Ves, whenever I 
try to entertain a 
gentleman, I 
hear such exclamations as these: "Ain't she awful?" " How 
exceedingly fresh !" " She will never catch a 
sensible hus-
band." 
And all this because I 
try— 
Just to please the boys, &c. 
Some people call me fickle, just because I 
change my beau, 
And don't keep one man to myself, and let all others go; 
Now that, I 
think, would be unkind, for no one more enjoys 
To give good-looking men a 
chance, and try and please the 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—Lord ! 
I'm not fickle. 
I 
do like one man. The 
other evening a 
gentleman kissed me just because I 
let him. 
He repeated the act, and then wanted an encore. 
I 
refused. 
He said, " Ella, they all do it." 
He didn't mean me. I 
have 
a 
few kisses left, and when I 
distribute them it will be— 
Just to please the boys, &c.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Cuoims: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan: 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
C'Lorus. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Chorus. 
Written and Sung by C. H. SHEFFER, in" Uncle Ike's Jubilee." 
I 
look way over in the far end of the town, 
I 
know where John Anderson lives; 
I 
see them niggers a 
layin' all round. 
I

I

I'm Going To Meet My Sister.t 
Words and music by W. H. DELELTANTT. 
W HEN I 
landed in New York, 
All the way from Cushaloch, 
Where the black birds sung their notes of lamentation 
In every little lay, 
Sure I 
thought I 
heard them say 
May good luck attend you, Pat, in every station. 
When I 
landed in New York 
Sure I 
thought that I'd get work, 
But I 
found that was a 
matter rather hard, so 
I 
must emigrate out west; 
There I 
think I'll do the best 
When I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
4 
CHORUS. 
In Chicago, in the State of Illinois; 
But before I 
say adieu 
I 
will take a 
step or two 
Just as graceful as a 
little lustiardo. 
So blaze away and tear, 
Now the divil a 
hair I 
care, 
For I'm going to meet my sister in Chicago. 
Down at Castle Garden gate, - 
Sure it's there I 
had to wait, 
Now I 
know ye's all will say it was a 
pity; 
The divil a 
one I 
found 
Who would show a 
Paddy round, 
So you see I'm led astray now in your city. 
And no matter where I 
be, 
All the boys make game of me, 
And they holler pipe the tarrier Bernardo; 
With their cry, " What d'ye saoy 1" 
Faith me heart knows little joy, 
Till I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
In Chicago, etc.

'Written by ARCHIE DELMANING. 
rtortnedby " The DICLMANINGS 
at the " Vaudeville " Theatre, 
San Antonio, Texas. 
Oh, we are two careless boys from Tennessee, 
We just came out to have some recreation; 
It was in sunny South we were set free, 
Way down upon the old plantation; 
But at night when our weary work was o'er, 
Among the boys we caused a 
big sensation, 
And now we'll show to you, what the darkies used 
to do, 
Way down upon the old plantation. 
But now things have changed about the suiLny South 
'Mongst the cane no more you hear the darkies 
singing; 
-Where the levee figs once loved to dance and shout 
And listen to the bones and banjo ringing; 
When good old father Lincoln set us free, 
Then the darkies scattered all around creation; 
And upon the cabin floor we will dance like this no 
more, 
Way down upon the old plantation, 
In dot Little Old Log Cabin. 
Sung with great success by AL. W . 
FILSON". 
I 
am getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
I 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
ow Massa and old Missus they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the ble:t ; 
Things are changed about the place, the darkies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little dog of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
For de chimney's falling down, 
And de roof am caving in, 
And I 
ain't got long around here to remain, 
For de angels dey watch over me, 
When I 
lay me down to sleep, 
In dot little old log cabin in the lane. 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years ago, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banjo, 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh ! the only friend that's left me is that little dog of mine,

DELEHANTY. 
You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of Amber isle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw mycelf away; 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keen from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the moonlight picnic 
They gave at " Amberisle;" 
How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of " bon ton" style. 
It was there I 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I 
asked to see her home 
She said " I 
can't refuse." 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline," 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse.

INSANE NIGS. 
Words by ARCHIE DELMANING. 
sung by " The DELMANINGS 
at the Theatre Cotnique. 
Oh, we just came out dresseil up in style, 
AVe are going to the b::11; 
Well make the nigs and wenches stare, 
As we dance round the hall; 
With sweet perfume we'll till the room, 
The ceiling we will shake; 
Come every one and see the fun, 
When dancing for that cake, 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my, won't we put on airs, 
Dancing, prancing, as we go 'round the hall; 
Oh, my, won't we put on airs, 
Dancing, prancing, down at the colored ball. 
Oh, all the nigs for miles around, 
Have promised to be there; 
We're going to have a 
full brass band, 
'Twill be a 
grand affair; 
But all the nigs about this town, 
Say we are both insane; 
Because we sing and do the wing, 
We have dancing on the brain.

Return from the War."

Actors' Boarding House. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
I 
keep an actors' boarding house 
here in the city, 
All the gang about the town say I'm the boss, 
From the leading lady down 
To the back line of the ballet, 
On all the gang I 
have money lost. 
I've got.a little daughter 
That's struck upon the stage, 
And I 
fear that's been ordained by fate. 
She went out the other night 
With a 
couple of the gang, 
When she came home she said " I've got a 
date.' 
CHORUS. 
She's going on the stage, ain't it funny, (bus.) 
They're going to use her for a 
dummy, ( bus.) 
She must paint, powder and galvanize her face, 
Or she'll never make a 
hit in the world. 
She gets a 
letter every day from little Johnny Shay, 
And wants to double up with Amelia Dean, 
She does a 
walk round to her little _song and dance, 
And they say it is the dizziest ever seen, 
She's got a 
lithograph of the terrible danger. Norton, 
Her eyes on Watson & Ellis she wants to feast,

Waiting for Dr. Landis to come East.

Allow me to See you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, New York. 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. • 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
'
1 I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude: 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes 1" 
And often decidedly " no ;” • 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way. 
I 
then think what fools we men are! 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, Scc. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park. 
A 
beautiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt want anything more. 
SPOKEN.—Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No anrer, so I 
raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
Allow me to see you home, &c,

The sweetest treasure life can give

And childhood's golden moments live 
In dreams that soon must fade away. 
I 
see my angel mother's face, 
I 
hear her voice so true and brave,• 
Her smile beams out with hallowed grace, 
From thee, my rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 
That grassy mound where willows wave 
Oh precious gem of countless worth, 
• 
My rose from angel mothcr's grave. 
What memories cluster around it now, 
Like jewels around some holy shrine; 
Her loving hands are on my brow, 
Her eyes so fondly gaze in mine. 
I 
seem to gather to my breast 
The place and comfort life would crave. 
And dewy tears so fond and blest 
Are thine, dear rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 8.:c. 
It whispers that she dwells afar, 
And watches o'er her loved ones here ; 
Oh, brighter than the morning star 
Each thought of thee my mother dear. 
Thy loving arms again caress me 
With all the hope and joy they gave, 
While fondly to my lips I 
press 
Thy leaves, my rose from mother's grave.

A WOODLAND FLOWER. 
Written for " The DELMANINGS" by VERNER HOWARD. 
In a 
mossy woodland bower, 
Sat a 
maiden young and fair; 
With her golden tresses waving, 
In the sunny, perfumed air; 
There was joy in every dimple. 
In her rosy cheeks and chin; 
I 
would be a 
lucky fellow, 
If I 
could this maiden win. 
Cnottus: 
Oh, my heart with joy is beaming, (Sym). 
And I 
almost think I'm dreaming; ( Sym) 
There was joy in every dimple, 
In her rosy cheeks and chin; 
I 
would be a 
lucky fellow, 
If I 
could this maiden win. 
There's a 
world of mischief lurking, 
In her sparkling, bright, blue eye; 
As she sits ' mid rosy blossoms, 
Underneath the Summer sky. 
You would think her some sweet fairy. 
Lost amid the blooming flowers; 
If you saw this little beauty, 
Hidden in the leafy bowers. (Chorus). 
Oh, I 
love this pretty maiden, 
She is all the world to me; 
If I 
could this maiden marry, 
I'd be happy as a 
bee; 
She's a 
saucy, little spirit, 
Pull of mischief, love and fun; 
And the sweetest, little darling, 
Underneath the setting sun. (Chorus).

AIR— Slavery Days. 
Tonmco slowly, day by day, ' till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head ; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise ' cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave ; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can he free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell ; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave ; 
!tow it makes the tear-drops fall when-they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
it has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure ' twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay thE most ; 
Yet, still we can forgive, ' tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life L., passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave.

Of the faded past I'll ponder— 
Kiss me, love, before I

Written by J. P. SULLIVAN, and sung with immense success by 
CRONIN & SULLIVAN. 
I 
am a 
valiant Irishman, 
My name is Jack O'Hare; 
I 
was born in Tipperary, 
There's no place that's so fair; 
I 
came to New York City, 
And it was my settled plan; 
To try and get elected, 
To be be an Alderman. 
CHORUS: 
Down the street with head erect, 
All the ladies gaze on me; 
Smiling as I 
pass them by, 
I 
always look so neat you see; 
happy hearted, light and gay, 
And I'm always free from care; 
The jolliest chap in all the town, 
Is gallant Jack O'Hare. 
When I 
lived home, my mother said 
Jack, asthore, machree; 
Don't ere forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may be; 
The land that gave O'Connell birth, 
Emmet and Wolfetone; 
Jack, my son, don't ere forget, 
Your dear old Irish home. 
(Chorus). 
I 
soon became a 
voter, 
And worker, too, as well; 
Around the Polls on Election Day, 
Oh would'nt I

My friends they waited on me, 
Saying come and join the gang; 
And in spite of the very Devil, 
We'll make you au Alderman. (Chorus),

The sweetest and the fairest is the girl I

While riding in a 
stage-coach coming down Broadway; 
Smiling as she entered, oh, indeed she looked so sweet, 
I 
arose at once and asked her if she would have a 
seat. 
CHORUS. 
Then I'd like to win her heart and hand, (
synt.) 
She's the fairest in the land, (
syrn.) 
Then the village bells will sweetly chime, 
As we march side by side, 
And some happy day 
claim her 
As my own loving bride. 
At length I 
did approach her, and to me she looked Pei 
sweet, 
And said, " I 
hope some future day we again shall 
meet." 
We had a 
pleasant chat there, and she arose to leave, 
She said, " I 
hope to meet you, some afternoon or eve."

With patent leather heeled boots,

We walked and we talked together, 
Until it was quite late, 
And bidding her a

Air: " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Ph, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wi:d, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true ? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
With sweet laughing eyes, & c,

gal 
She's a 
stunner, she's a 
bouncer, 
Her given name is Sal, 
And she wears a 
balmoral. 
I 
met her at a 
ball, 
She couldn't dance at all, 
Wasn't she a 
fine gal, 
With a 
waterfall. 
CHORUS— 
Then oh, oh, I 
must find her, 
I 
must find her; 
Oh, oh, I 
wonder where she lives, 
Yonder, yonder is her father's house, 
And that's where she lives. 
I'm looking for my Pete, 
He's a 
coming, he's a 
coming, 
I

And dresses up so fine,

Thinks he cuts a 
shine.

I 
once did love a

Of course I

And I

Oh. she's the gat for me.

She's the gal for me,

Thick enough, thin enough, 
She's the gal for me

year, 
My wife is still as dear ; 
But when I 
rock the cradle 
It makes me feel so queer. 
Don't blush and be so shady, 
Of course I 
mean the baby. 
She's the gal, & c.

Sweet Nosegay. 
Written by GEORGE FASH, of MAYO and 1
7..sitt. 
When Flora decks the mantle bowers 
In elegant array, 
And scatters all the opening flowers, 
A 
compliment to May, 
With glowing joy my bosom beats, 
I 
gaze delighted round, 
And wish to see the various sweets 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis granted, and the bloom displayed, 
The treasure it is found; 
I 
see them all, my beauteous maid, 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
The flowers blush and bloom each year 
The birds sing out their lay, 
The loveliness is in my dear. 
When I 
am far away; 
The roses blush whene'ex she speaks, 
The lilies cease to bloom, 
The love which is but life to seek 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
Tis granted, & C.

Far away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I 
lingered '
mid the clover 
Singing to a 
village maid; 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
CHORUS. 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was dearer than the dearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fair 10 
'Twas decreed that fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well ; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, &e. 
ROYAL ROSES. 
Written by A. 
DELMASING, and dedicated to MISS ANNIE OLMSTEAD. 
'Twits in a 
quiet little spot, 
One Summer eve in June; 
While passing by an ivy cot, 
Where royal roses bloom; 
A 
maiden fair with golden hair, 
Sat 'mid the rosy bower; 
She looked an empress on her throne, 
The queen of all the flowers. 
CIIORTJS: 
Oh, my, to wed her I 
will try, ( Break). 
If I 
don't I 
know that I 
will die; (Break). 
The violets peep through meadows green, 
The rose-buds fringe the door; 
And over the grassy orchard, 
The pink and white blossoms pour. 
The moonbeams kissed her snowy brow, 
The dew-drops on her smiled; 
The night-birds sang their songs to her, 
And the evening hours beguiled; 
The roses nodded as she passed, 
And blushed a 
modest red; 
Oh, I 
would be a 
happy man, 
Could I 
this beauty wed. 
(Chorus).

'Twas a 
pleasant morn in Spring, 
When the birds began to sing, 
And the flowers with their perfume filled the air; 
Carelessly I 
went along, 
Singing snatches from a 
song, 
When I 
espied a 
maid with a 
head of golden hair. 
She bestowed on me a 
smile, 
Fascinating all the while, 
And in her hand she held a 
little flower; 
Which she pinned upon my breast, 
And you can guess the rest, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the angel of my dreams, (Sym.) 
Her eye so loving beams, 
(Sum.) 
Oh, my I 
she looked so gay, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower, 
She said I 
will be thine, 
Then she put her hand in mine, 
And she softly laid her head upon my breast,-
I 
was in a 
whirl of bliss, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And her rosy lips to mine she shyly pressed. 
I 
clasped her in my arms, 
And I 
gloried in her charms, 
Which put me in a 
heaven of delight; 
And now I 
am her beau, 
And in the little church below, 
We'll married be just a 
week to- night. 
She's the angel, etc. 
A IR: " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Words by BENNE= and FILSON, and sung by them amid roars of applause 
Filson—Oh, my lung is gone since I 
took that horn, 
Such a 
darling girl waited on me; 
She looked like a 
star when behind the bar, 
And her hair was the color of clay. 
Such a 
lovely nose, ' twas like a 
rubber hose, 
And her mouth was as wide as the Hudson. 
Such a 
delicious breath, it was certain death 
To the man that buzzed her long. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
funeral, ( Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
whistle in a 
tug-boat. (Syrn.) 
She's my only girl, (Sym.) 
With such a 
lovely curl, ( Sym.) 
She's as handsome as the cobwebs on the wall. ( Biz.) 
CHORUS. 
For my darling's sake I 
my life would take 
just as freely as I 
would a 
bedbug's; 
Such a 
lovely maid with teeth just like a 
spade, 
That I 
met down by the brook. 
Bennett--Oh my feet are sore and my clothes are tore 
Since a 
cross-eyed girl has shook me; 
Such a 
freckled face, teeth out of place, 
That I 
met down by the bay. 
Oh her liver lip, how it used to flip, 
When she tried to talk Italian, 
And her Spanish shoes, number thirty- twos, 
Would cover up the whole sidewalk. 
She's so lazy, (Sym.) 
And she's so crazy, (Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
fish-horn on a 
Friday. 
She's presumptive, (Sym.) 
And she's consumptive; ( Sym.) 
And her mouth would cover up a 
good size sewer. ( Biz)

Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me ; • 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; (Sym.) 
And she knew me! ( Sym.) 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! (Sym.) 
She surprised me! (Sym.) 
She paralyzed me! (Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gilly all the while. 
CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me— 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work. 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome 
As a 
handcart! 
With her head stuck 
Picking cinders! 
She's a 
daisy! 
She's terrible lazy! 
And she played me for 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
in an ash barrel— 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
a 
gIlly all the while.

DARLING BESSIE Or_ THE LEA 
As sung by John Nolan, the pleasing tenor. 
OH! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streanalet unto 1214, 
Is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure aud gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops .alt 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me1, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, &c. 
Oh ! the hobey be may linger where the buds and blossom* 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is fall of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, lee.

For us we hope you'll pray.

The girls have much to answer for, 
By the way in which they tease, 
And twirl us 'round their fingers, 
And do just as they please. 
I'm suffering just at present 
From one who's most unkind, 
She keeps me on a 
string, 
And won't make DD her mind.

jolly lark. 
Henrietta I 
Henrietta! 
Now don't refuse your Joe. 
Henrietta! Henrietta I 
Now darling, don't say no. 
She lets me make her presents, 
And what is more absurd, 
She listens to my promise, 
But never says a 
word. 
;66 
I 
write tier loving letters, 
And sit up half the night, 
But she says I'm doing—wrong, 
When to her I 
do—write. 
SPOKEN — And after covering a 
whole sheet of foolscap with 
all the expressions of love I 
can think of, I 
always put a 
post-
script down in the corner, and say  
Henrietta! etc. 
Sometimes we go to parties, 
Where she's a 
well-known flirt; 
Then she says there is no 'harm, 
But I 
feel so awfully hurt— 
I 
try to read her every thought, 
And watch her every glance, 
Each morning, noon, and night, 
Whene'er I 
have the chance. 
SPOKEN.—I 
whisper in her ear the same old story of  
Henrietta! etc. 
If she'd only give a 
whisper; 
If she'd say that little—Yes— 
Then I'd feel in Paradise, 
And my fate I 
then could guess. 
But in neither words nor ways, 
Her consent I 
cannot trace, 
And if I 
break my promise, 
There is a " breach of promise case!' 
SPOKEN.—And then I 
wouldn't need to say any more--
Henrietta I 
etc.

It was on a 
Tuesday night, as the stars were shining 
bright, 
When this happened which I'll now relate to YOU ; 
It's about this sad affai r th at you hear 
most everywhre, 
And that o'er our pleasant city spread a 
gloom. 
It of the young and old I'll tell, how their dear lives they 
did sell, 
And who suffered, God only knows what pain; 
But I 
hope they're now at rest, in heaven with the blest, 
And with rain they'll ne'er be troubled any more. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
It was, on this fatal night, when with faces that were 
bright 
That those people they all left their happy homes ; 
If the " Two Orphans" they conld see, how happy they 
would be, 
And all to the Brooklyn Theatre they did go. 
The place it was filled soon, and some left for want of 
TOM, 
And them that got seats thought that they were lucky; 
But it's little did they know the trouble or the woe, 
That they were about to leave upon this earth. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
They all sat there with glee and the falling sparks did see, 
And they most all thought that it was in the play; 
But when they saw the flames and smoke they saw It was 
no joke, 
It's then 'they ran excited for the door. 
Some fell upon the floor, from which they rose no more, 
And God help the women, you could hear them cry, 
And young men there with their wives, asking God to 
save their lives, 
But it seemed they all were led there to die. 
(Repeat last four line.)

TWO MISSISSIPPI NIGS. 
Words by ARCHIE DELMANING. 
Sung by " The DELMANINGS" at the " Grand Central Theatre," 
Troy, New York. 
We're two Mississippi Niggers, 
'Tis seldom we are seen; 
We work on board a 
boat, 
On the Mississippi stream; 
But when the moon is shining, 
'Tis then we go ashore, 
And dance till break of day, 
On the old log cabin floor. 
CHORUS: 
Two gay and festive boys, 
From the Mississippi shore; 
Now we'll show you how we dance, 
On the old log cabin floor. 
It was on the old plantation, 
Among the cotton rows; 
That sunny Southern land, 
Where the sweet magnolia grows; 
We love to eat the hoe cake, 
And watermelon, too; 
We make the old folks laugh, 
When we put down the shoe.

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions.

swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ztlemen who are either too diffi-
• dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentoue 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
', ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mieht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the difil-
calty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, w hich 
f
act makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—"

panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
ilIIMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the orcEnary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of, quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated. suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. EveniniBulletin.
