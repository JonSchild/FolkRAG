Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y 
Oh, dear, I 
don't know what to say, 
Mit joy I'm nearly wild, 
Why wouldend I? 
You see dis day 
Is de christning of my child. 
I 
insvidet all de neighbors, 
Und dey'll all come do my house, 
To drink my heald, 
Und wish success 
To leedle Rudolph Krouse. 
CHORUS. 
Come und kiss de baby, it will cause its parents joy. 
Come und kiss de baby, just for fun, 
Isend he a 
daisy? 
Yes, a 
leedle bouncing boy, 
Come und kiss de baby, every one. 
It looks like General U. S. Grand, 
But it's got his faders' feet, 
And such a 
puddy leedle hand, 
Und a 
double sets of teeth, 
Its moud looks like its mudder dear, 
Wick I 
noticed when it shinned, 
I 
would like to dreat you all to beer, 
In honor of de child, 
(Repeat.)

De theatre was full and de actors was tight, 
De musishens was out on a 
tare, 
When Dorkins did make his first entrance dat night, 
He was sooked in de head mit a 
chair. 
De footlights at last he approached very slow, 
Und, "Ladies and schendelmens," said, 
" 
Come und kiss de baby, it will cause its parents joy, 
Come mid kiss de baby, just for fun, 
Isend he a 
daizy? Yes, a 
leedle bouncing boy. 
Come und kiss de baby for  
De all do it; de all do it, 
De all do it, und somedimes de rue it, 
But de all do it, de all do it, 
Und so it will continue till 
Dc ducks und de hens, 
De rabbits und de squirrels, 
Und every leedle animals you see, 
De fishes in de wader, 
Und de sweet leedle birds, 
De have all got a

Quite famous I

I 
am far superior to 31uldoons, 
Mulcahy or  
Johnny Mirgan plays the irgan, 
His sister plays the trum, 
His mudder plays de timbarine, 
His brudder goes bum, bum, bum, 
All alone on an old trimbone, 
De music was so sweed 
I 
ofden gived him a 
penny to--
Pull down de blinds, 
Pull down de blinds, 
Bei nigt so langsome dus duch geschwind. 
Make down de cirtain, 
Lower de rag, 
Somebody's looking, so—. 
Dammy, make room for your auntie, 
Dat's a 
leedle dear, 
I 
wand her to sit here, 
You know your fader has got a 
plum, 
Wick he will give to you, und 
She'll say, " Dad, you're awfully clever, 
Oh, so clever, very clever, 
Und she'll say, Dad, she never, no never, 
Saw a 
fellow so— 
Raise your voices, every one, 
Und de enemy we will hunt, 
Wo will rule New York, und dat's de talk, 
When Duffy's to de front.

Behold in me a

Und 1.'11 dell you de reason why, 
Pm atfectinot mid loving und do all I

In de eyes of all not on a

My wife, she is getting divircet from me, 
Und will take mit her Philip, our child, 
You see, her und I 
lately cannot agree, 
Wich has nearly drove me wild. ( Sym).

Gentlemens und woman,

Oh, dear, I'm nearly wild, 
Oh, dear, I'm nearly wild

She spoils my business from morning till nigh, 
Und calls me a 
dirty Dutch fool, 
Sixty dimes in de day we're engaged in a 
light, 
It is yust like a 
prize-fighting school. ( Sym). 
She drinks all de beer und de wizky I 
got, 
Und says it agrees mid de child, 
She scalled me mit wader dad was burning hot, 
Can you wonder de reason I'm wild? 
17 
SPOKEN.—Yes, some night when she is asleep, I 
will, 
like old fellow, sneak into de room, but, instead of a 
pil 
low, I 
will smidder her mid a 
matraz, und should she 
wake up before she is dead und ask me who is de madder, 
I 
will not, like Ridcher numero dree, say, "Lay on Mc-
Duffy, and de first one what claims out is a 
sicker," but I 
will tell her in German—" Du verdamedes kamel, when 
du night ruhig bist schlag ich dir ems in die fres batteni 
das du de Hiinel for a

(Chorus.) 
Onions Und Cabbage, 
Kiss Me Good Bye, Darling. 
As sung by Tonii C. ',mien, in San Francisco, Call. 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their nightwatch do keep, 
And why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, kis me, ere we part. 
011011Us. 
Good bye, darling, good bye, 
Do not grieve or miss me, 
I 
must go; I 
leave you weeping, 
So good by darling, kiss me. 
Farewell my loved one, my own, 
Oh, but be true unto me, 
Soon will my life bark be thrown 
Out on the tempest at sea. 
I'm going, my darling, I 
love thee, 
Lips speak the love of the heart, 
Smile once again ere I 
go, 
Then kiss me, kiss me, ere we part, 
(Champs.)

Der shades of night vere falling fast,

Und scarcely der payment his step could keep, 
Und yet dis youth so very tight, 
Kept muttering only—

Dry not to pass de vild vatch said, 
Come let me lead you home to bed, 
He give no heed dis youth so tight, 
Made no reply save 
Gersunthite Bachmuhl.

Half buried in der sewer found, 
Dis very youth so very tight, 
Who snoring grunted—

Sircharged mit lager beer he lay, 
Oh, sad vere der voices of der night, 
Dot rent der air mit—

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNism, expressly for MURPHY and MACK, 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun, 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank, 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
1 
25 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent— 
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went tc the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The 7..lan that stole the country

When courting time with us begins, 
And love is in its prime, 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never find him bashful, 
The wine fills him with life, 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife? 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife? 
CH0:—For Louis Renouf s 
the wine for me, &c.

And when old age creeps on the scene, 
Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf fills us with life, 
And makes us young as May. 
Then happy's the man that is married, 
To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a 
jolly good life, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's led a 
jolly good life.

A 
Cool Customer. 
A man entered a 
well-known restaurant the other da.) and 
called for a 
dinner. 
His orders were of the most elaborate 
character, and fairly staggered the resources of even so noted 
a 
restaurant keeper. 
He lingered long at the table, and 
finallylwound .up with a 
bottle of wine. 
Then lighting a 
cigar he ordered, he leisurely sauntered up to the counter, 
and said to the proprietor: 
"Very fine dinner, landlord I Just charge it to me. I 
haven't got a 
cent." 
" 
But I 
don't know you," said the proprietor, indignantly. 
"Of course you don't. 
If you had, you wouldn't have let 
me had the dinner." 
" 
Pay me for the dinner, I 
say." 
"And I 
say I 
can't. 
Haven't got the blunt." 
" 
I'll see about that," said the proprietor, somewhat furious 
at the bill. 
Then he snatched a 
revolver from the drawer 
and leaped over the counter, collared the man, exclaiming, as 
he pointed it at his head: 
" 
Now see if you'll get away with that dinner without pay. 
ing for it, you scoundrel." 
"What is that you hold in your hand?" said the getter-
away-with- free-dinners, drawing back. 
" 
That is a 
revolver, sir." 
"Oh, that's a 
revolver, is it. 
I 
don't care a 
pin for a 
re, 
volver. 
I 
thought it was a 
stomach-pump." 
I 
DO not remember to have seen any epitaph in which a 
man's virtues are more concisely stated than that upon the 
/ate Mr. Cut Mink: 
" 
The angels to-night, in their mansions of light, 
Are waltzing around Anthony Mink; 
He was faithful and kind as any you'll find, 
And gin was his favorite drink."

Many funny clings to both of us was told ;

In America in de streets we would find gold. 
But when we arrived it wasn't so, 
No paradise did we see ;

Murphy's Dream. 
Written by GEORGE M URPHY, and performed by GEORGE and JOHN 
M URPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too much beer, 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
" 
Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to John 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat, 
Why, I 
dreamt t'other night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
They dreamt George was a 
Dutchman, and that his name 
was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he did break, 
That his name wasn't John, but was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys all saw in their dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, as their 
sentence was they had to die ; 
That they mounted the scaffold, John quickly, George slow, 
and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun ; 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite near, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung; 
They dreamt that the trap fell and that they were dead, how 
strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads and 
caused such a 
ridiculous dream.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the"old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K fo r King, Q for Queen, 
ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case

'courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
