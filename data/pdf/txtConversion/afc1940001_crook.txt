The Crooked song
Collection
Selected and converted. American Memory, Library of Congress.
Ben Rice The Crooked Song'Tis not of Alexander, nor heros that I sing'Tis not of Roman Empires or
any such a thingBut give me time, I'll explain as nearly as I canThe devilishness and treachery that
lies in a woman.When women was created, there was taken out of manOut of a long and crooked
rib, deny it if you canOut of a long and crooked rib created women wereAnd thus their crooked
nature shows how crooked women ['?]ar[ ) ?].I've heard men boast and brag; they said they had a
loving wifeAnd they was now enjoying all the comforts in this lifeBut the minute you offend her 'tis
then she'll let you knowNo bridle rein will hold her, no stirrup can make her go.Now sure success to
your wife of the one you love the best
