THE LIFE OF BABY HART. 
 :oo:— 
This little Miss began her professional carer, Sep-
tember 10th, 1875, at the age of four years. 
She made 
her debut at Macauleys Theatre, 
Louisville, 
Ky, 
speaking at a 
bentit. 
Since that time she has played 
in near all the leading variety theatres in the States; 
making a decided success, and meeting with un-
limited applause. 
Many, almost all of the songs that 
she sings are original, with the words and music, 
she being 
probably 
the youngest composer in 
America, and the only child that we know of on the 
variety stage who is not indebted to some one else for 
their songs. 
Her voice is a 
rich contralto, pure and 
sweet, her dancing very graceful, and every gesture 
the very poetry of motion, and she wins the hearts of 
her hearers wherever she appears. 
Off the stage her demeanor is modest, simple and 
very lady like. 
No assumption of superiority among 
her playmates, and among grown persons her manner 
is almost perfect, and she is as much of a 
favorite off 
as on the stage, making hosts of friends everywhere. 
Her parents are justly proud of her, shielding her 
Carefully from any knowledge of evil. 
And we pre-
dict that the day will come when this little lady will 
stand preeminently above her professional compeers, 
and that he will bear her honors modestly, and in a 
manner that will silence envious tongues. 
A 
brilliant future is before, God bless and protect 
her, is the wish of the writer.

... wander through these grand old rugged hills 
And sit down here to think, 
And look about the rocks and rills, 
And gather battercups and pinks, 
But while I 
see the pansies sweet, 
I 
think of mother dear so fair, 
Angels took her long ago, 
To their bright glad home up there. 
CHORUS 
'Tis a 
pansy, a 
pansy, dear mother, 
A 
pansy that I 
rave; 
'Tis a 
pansy, a 
pansy, dear mother, 
A 
taken from your grave. 
In the old church yard my mother's sleeping, 
Where it seems so sad and drear; 
O'er her head the violets are peeping, 
My lonely heart to cheer; 
How off. I 
real her dear old letters, 
Which tell me ever to be brave; 
How I'll treasure them in memory, 
And the pansy from her grave. 
Chorus.

THE WORKING MAN'S APPEAL, 
OR THE TIN BUCKET BRIGADE, 
IS RECITED WITH TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, 
BY BABY HART. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LLEDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near, 
The columns are marching, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. tho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Pilled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor doth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those • 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigade 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten aid stale; 
Though they are -worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigade.

Oh ! the sun's bright rays were going down, 
And twilight robed the scene; 
As we took our pleasant little evening stroll, 
Along the meadows green. 
Arm in aria, together gaily strolled, 
Listening to each others tales of love, 
And the music of the merry song birds, 
Chirping sweetly from above.

Oh ! the shadow of the SIM'S reflecting rays, 
Lend enchantment to the scene; 
Reminding us of early youthltil days, 
While gamboling on the green. 
Our hearts spike out their ardent love, 
Accompanied by a 
gentle sigh, 
Beneath the bright blue conopy above, 
None so happy as she and I.

THAT OLD BAY MULE OF MINE. 
BY CHARLEY DOCESTADER, EXPRESSLY FOR DAN ELM. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LIEDEP 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
I'm an old man now, as you can see, 
I'm sixty years of age; 
And when I 
was but ten years old, 
A 
stable boy was made. 
I've seen the fastest horses, 
And the ones what made best time, 
But of all I 
never seen a 
one, 
Like that old bay mule of mine. 
For he ain't fast 'ceptin' he am hit, 
He ain't pretty to be old; 
But he am faithful, good and kind, 
And that am more dan gold. 
He never runs away wid me, 
Nor cuts up any shines, 
For he am de best nag in dis town 
That old bay mule of mine. 
On Sundays when I 
dress myself, 
I 
go out for to take a 
drive, 
Dat mule he am as joyful, 
As a 
bird brim full of pride. 
But if I 
leave him for a 
day, 
For me that poor soul pines; 
I 
wouldn't exchange him for all this world, 
That old bay mule of mine. 
Chorus.

RECITED BY JOE HART. 
When the angry passion nthering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneitth my coat-tail seem to swarm, 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath, 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, I 
had not thought of that, 
My son just take them breeches oft 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
And you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
If I 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle,

My name is O'Brien front Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a

Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Ate tt ing he steps and the dance. 
And they shout out whenever 
passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water panes. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a

He played up a

And he gave out a

strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brook, 
We tho t

DON'T GO TO YOUR RELATIONS, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LUX. 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
in every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and frowns, 
If we depend on kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit le in fa N 
or, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CEORUS. 
So my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
How often they'll in\ ite you, 
But when poverty copies close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. Chorus. 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if yon don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
Chorus. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
Why Frank we were only joking. Chorus. 
There is none in this world so blessed as I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart if burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
For I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns, 
And only (lives to those that don't need it 
Cha 
f 
IT DON'T BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
Cnorxs. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dab, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance ;to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Missel3rown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to me.

Where pretty lilacs grow. (Dance.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A

Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
We'll ramble to and fro, • 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow.

As O'er the trotting course one day, 
My horse was quickly gliding; 
I 
met a 
gay and pretty blonde 
In a 
pretty phaeton riding. 
I 
quickly threw a 
kiss at her, 
Which caused the boys to stare, 
I 
noticed as she threw it back, 
She'd a 
ribbon in her hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! goodness gracious, me, 
(Break.) 
Her haLd I'm bound to gain 
But wasn't she nice; 
At any price. 
(Break.) 
No in tter be she rich or poor, 
All dangers I 
will dare, 
I'm bound to win that charming girl, 
With the ribbon in her hair. 
I 
quickly turned my horse around, 
My former ground retracing; 
Away we flew, and soon I 
found, 
That this girl was with me racing, 
The fun began in earnest now, 
A 
mile or more was run, 
When she sang out defiantly, 
Come and catch me if you can. 
I 
said all right, my pretty lass, 
soon be with you tripping; 
If you will give me one sweet kiss. 
While we o'er the track are skipping. 
Says she come on, and in a

I'd passed her on the square; 
I 
won the kiss from that dear girl 
With the ribbon in her hair.

One night I 
was invited, 
To attend a 
fancy hall; 
I 
dressed myself up in my hest, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
CIICRUS. 
Hands all around, boys ! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade—. 
.Nd Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
Chorus. 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
flc waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent. shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried,

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief? 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised. 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak. 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus. 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old.

MY AWFUL DAD. 
BY TOMMY TUCKER. 
The bible says the father's sin 
Descends upon th son; 
And as a 
witness to its truth, 
You'll find that I 
am one. 
My pa stays out late at night, 
He's quite a 
swell egad; 
I'm always blamed for mischief done 
By my awful dad. 
CHORUS. 
Go where I 
will, do what I 
may, 
The people think me bad; 
I 
think I 
will go crazy through 
My very awful dad. 
Now I 
am quite a 
model youth, 
But oar names are both the same, 
And that's the reason why he's fined, 
In court I 
get the blame. 
There's seven broach-of-promise suits 
My parents brought on me; 
And how I 
will slip out of them, 
I 
really cannot see. 
Now if he doesn't stop his tricks, 
I'll have to leave his house, 
For when I 
think of what I 
bear, 
My manhood it does rouse. 
I 
think I'll try to get a 
wife, 
The first that can be had, 
So that I 
then can rid me of 
My very awful dad.

So listen, my friends, and I 
hope you will not sneeze, 
At this something I've got to say to you. 
Ah ! it's well I

she would laugh, 
When she sat by the fire with my aunts, 
She was giggling, and was pointing at the 
object here in view, 
'Twas this patch from my angel brother's pants. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my memory like a 
happy dream, 
When I 
think about my ugly aunts; 
And the only thing they left me to remember 
him above, 
Is this patch from my angel brother's pants. 
This patch was put on by my mother's feeble hands, 
It puts me in Mind of better days; 
And whenever I 
look ot this patch upon those pants, 
I

Augustus, my loved one, do not spoil that little spot,

Darling, I 
have roamed to-day, 
'Mid the scenes of long ago ; 
Change has taken all away, 
That we lurid and cherished so. 
Time has toucned both cot and tree, 
Friends we knew no more remain, 
And I 
found naught left to-day, 
But the old church down the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Dear old chtirch down in the lane, 
It brings back with a 
fairy spell, 
Bright and beautiful again, 
Days, dear heart, 
te loved so well, so well. 
To its walls the ivy clings, 
And the roof was green with moss ; 
Crumbling are the stones where sings, 
Lark and thrush amid the dress. 
It is going- to decay. 
From the touch of time and rain, 
Just as we are love, to-day. 
Like the old church down the lane. 
Ckorus. 
Long I 
stood beside the door, 
Dreaming of the joys we know, 
In the golden days of yore. 
When we I

When we left it hand in hand. 
For our journey O'er life's noun ; 
Drifting Lack upon th•• strand.

The winter has come on, the summer's past ana gone, 
The streets and squares are covered with ice and snow, 
The people are wearing heavy woolen clothes, 
To keep themselves %% arm as they walk to and fro.. 
It is easy for the rich that can afford it. 
To keep a 
warm carpet on their floor, 
In a

For he knows what it is to be penniless and pour,

And there's a

Who goes out poor thing to wash and scrub all the week

Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light.

OLD POMPEPS GETTING BAREFOOT 
ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD

_ 
The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
getting stronger, . 
Before that morn of sunshine when massa set him free; 
He used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
It breakdown and at party, old Pomp was 
hale and hearty, 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness, 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his hold l 
CHORUS. 
The wool no more is growing, and Pompey's 
lleart is knowing, 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for massa, and at night would 
court some lassie, 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed so fair 
and white, 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkies danc'd 
so fleetly, 
t Wheu fell the southern moonbeans in floods 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, and gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
_ 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
Where Pompey once was happy before they set him free;

I 
follow the styles of the day ; 
Th, girls I 
amaze, when at them I 
gaze, 
And my beautiful form I 
displays. 
I 
love the dear creatures so well, 
That they don't my attentions repel, 
I've got a 
rich dad, who keeps me well clad, 
And in a 
brown- stone front I 
dwell.

Jaw de claw, law de daw, 
With the girls let me live and die, 
For they are such charming creatures, 
Much sweeter than kokenut pie. 
I'm the pet of my mamma, also, 
I'm courted wherever I 
go, 
I've plenty of wine that's really fine, 
That I

Sometimes I 
go out on a

And then Sarah and I

I 
talk to her sweet, her pardon entreat, 
I'm soon trotting her on my knee.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery streets 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you. know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother you understand ! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she sakt 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was bawd.

PAT MAY BC FOOLISH. 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grow% 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chortu.. 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as tr uo 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not tit for a 
country or queen.

wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast; 
A 
harp entwined with shamrocks, 
Are the emblems I 
love best. 
The symbols of old Erin, 
The land that gave me birth; 
The sacred soil of Ireland, 
The dearest spot on earth. 
CHORUS. 
It's the harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
It's the harp and the shamrock for me, 
And while I've strength to raise 
My voice, I'll sing in praise 
Of the Harp and the Shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks. 
I 
think of Patrick's Day; 
And when I 
hear the tune struck up. 
It makes me feel so gay. 
My spirits overcome me, 
I

Then touch the harp of Erin, 
And I'11 sing you Tara's Hall.

Oh ! wake, bonnieTessie, the bright morn is breaking, 
The sweet flowers are blooming o'er mountain and moor, 
The sunbeams are falling on mossy crown'd heather, 
And glinting the ivy that creeps round your door. 
How fair is the heath with the newly mown clover, 
Where song bird are singing their sweet notes of glee, 
And up in the highlands fond echo is calling, 
Oh ! wake, bonnie Bessie, the bright morn to see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh wake, bonnie Bessie, while dew-drops are nestling, 
In heart of the roses so fragrant and fair, 
The lad of the highland is wooing his lassie, 
Then wake bonnie Bessie, such true love to share. 
Oh ! wake bonnie Bessie, the day dawn is fleeting, 
The horn of the hunter is heard o'er the moor, 
Afar from the highlands and roaming the lowlands, 
Is one true heart yearning to enter your door. 
So fair is the valley in sunshine and gloaming, 
Yet lonely I 
wander my true love to see, 
Oh I 
am so weary of watching and waiting, 
Then wake bonnie Bessie, with sweet smiles for ma. 
Oh! wake, bonnie Bessie, my fond heart is calling, 
O'er heath and o'er heather it echoes afar, 
Oh! come to my arms in the calm of the gloaming, 
And list to my song neath the bright evening star. 
How fair are_the sunbeams but fairer the shadows, 
Which bring fondest dreams of thy pure love to me. 
Amid the sweet bloom of the heath and the heather, 
Then wake bonnie 1.3esi::, the fair stars to see.

The stars of night were looking down, 
Beside the gate we stood, 
Her sunny eyes were soft and brown, 
'Neath her pretty little Gipsey hood. 
Oh! she was like the lily fair! (Break.) 
A 
little queen beyond compare! (Break.) 
Around her neat bewitching waist, 
My arm I'd fondly reach! 
And oh ! those lips I

While strolling through the avenue, 
A cottage neat I-saw; 
A maiden dressed in pink and blue, 
Was standing at the door. 
Iler rosy cheeks they were so sweet, 
Her eyes shone bright and gay, 
And on her bosom rested neat, 
A rose perfumed bouquet. 
I 
raised my hat she bowed her head, 
Soon by her side I 
stood; 
And then sweet loving words were said, 
That made my heart feel good. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! she's the sweetest flower here, 
And she's the dearest of the dear; 
She's a 
lilly pure and true, 
A fragrant mignonette, 
A morning-glory dipped in dew, 
A 
purple violet; 
A tulip white, and red rose fair, 
The gayest of the gay; 
She's all the flowers sweet and rare, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
One day while standing by her side, 
I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be ray bride, 
She softly whispered " yes," 
Her answer filled me with new life, 
It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my wife, 
My rose perfumed bouquet. 
Now in a 
cottage of our own, 
One painted white and gray, 
I 
dwell in peace and love alone, 
With my rose perfumed 
bouquet.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
rye a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Oeh ! I 
didn't conic here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney MeGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! rnurther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost/ 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
BY CLARABELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHIN 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of hers 
hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
bagel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A- de, A-de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains. 
seem to watch and wait alway.
