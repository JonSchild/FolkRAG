Of John Reilly's Buck Goat I 
will tell, 
And the troubles which he did cause. 
It would take a 
whole volunm to tell 
The way in which he transgressed the laws. 
He was the terror of the whole neighborhood, 
Divil a 
one would come near him at all. 
A 
policeman, who swore fight him he would, 
He ate up coat-tails and all. 
Bad luck to that Goat— 
The dirty old bloat I 
He ate Reilly's pants, 
And swallowed his coat; 
He ate forty candles, 
And twenty pump-handles, 
And ready for more 
Was John Reilly's Buck Goat. 
The people all rose up one night, 
Swore the Goat they would kill upon sight. 
Next day, in a 
hod'.', after taking their toddy, 
They went for the Buck Goat to fight. 
The Goat met them as they came down the street, 
He let fly with both his hind feet. 
When the battle was over the Goat was in clover, 
For he was the king of the street, 
The Goat felt so proud 
Of bating the crowd. 
lie ate a 
shoemaker. 
By the name of Pat Dowd; 
He ate the leather, the lasts, 
And the twenty-four pails, 
And finished with a 
keg 
Of ten-penny nails. 
Then up stepped brave Michael McNalley. 
Who cornered the Goat in an alley. 
They fought for four hours, and then, by the powers, 
Pivil a 
thing was there left of McNally. 
It was then that I 
threw off my coat, 
And swore I 
would murder the Goat, 
Who took a 
look at my hat, and split up the back, 
And that was the end of the 1-oat. 
Ctionus. 
So you see this old hat 
Laid Reilly's Goat fiat. 
He'll never come back ; 
I'll answer for that. 
So you may all of you hoot it— 
Or else try to boot it, 
But I 
never will boot it, 
My darling old hat I 
Oh! friends, give me your attention, 
And I'll tell you of a 
ball 
That the Wexford tailors are going to give, 
Down here at Wallhalla Hall. 
I 
understand it will be a 
grand affair, 
What the Frinch call Recherche. 
The best dancer in the room 
Will get a 
present of a 
broom, 
And the worst will get a 
load of hay. 
Oh! Mister O'Flanagan will be there, 
With a 
boiled shirt—stiffened with starch, 
With a 
gold- headed cane, and idling full of ale, 
He'll lead the grand march, 
And when the dance is over 
He'll patronize the bar. 
Oh! he's a 
high-toned Mick, 
And never will kick. 
lie's the solid man from Mullingar. 
O'Grady, the tailor, will be there too, 
With a 
collar as high as a 
fence, 
With a 
swallow tailed coat, and a 
new cravat, 
That cost him twenty-five cents. 
He'll have trombone pants, fitting tight at the knees, 
A hat that was made in the flood; 
A second-hand vest, 
Oh! he'll be dressed, 
For he's of royal blood. 
Then early the next morning. 
At the ending of the ball, 
All the boy's heads will be terribly swelled; 
Their hats won't fit them at all. 
They'll go for their gin cock- tails, 
And try to straighten up. 
By night they are right, 
And forget that they were tight, 
And are read))
, for another sup.

Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
Have you heard of a 
cross-eyed man, 
By the name of Paddy McCann ? 
He could eat, he could fight, he could gouge and could bite; 
Divil a 
wan but he'd tan. 
He'd an arm as big as a 
log, 
A 
voice like the bark of a 
dog; 
His nose it turned up, just like a 
bull pup; 
He waddled about like a 
hog. 
He'd drink whiskey—a 
gallon a 
day, 
If he did'nt get it there'd be the divil to pay; 
He'd swear, by his life, he'd murther his wife— 
Poor woman! he tortured her gray. 
One day, while he was as drunk as a 
bat, 
He made a 
lick at her—when the poor cat 
Made one wicked fly, and tore out his cross-eye, 
Be the mortal! that nettled Pat. 
He made a 
lick at the cat with a 
brick— 
Had it struck her she would have felt sick. 
The cat up with the poker, and hit him a 
soaker, 
And his wife called him a 
dirty old Mick. 
Then he made up a 
terrible plan, 
Says I'll kill that cat if I 
can. 
The cat jumped down his mouth, turned him inside out, 
And, be jabers that settled McCann. 
Lend a 
hand to one another, -
11) 
In the daily toil of life; 
When we meet a 
weaker brother, 
Let us help him in the strife. 
There is none so rich, but may, 
In his turn, be forced to borrow, 
And the poor man's lot to-day, 
May become our own to-morrow. 
Lend a 
hand to one another, 
When malicious tongues have thrown 
Dark suspicions on your brother 
Be not prompt to cast a 
stone. 
There is none so good but may 
Run adrift in shame and sorrow, 
And the best of men to- day, 
May become the worst to-morrow. 
Lend a 
hand to one another 
In the race for honor's crown; 
Should it fall upon your brother 
Let not envy tear it down. 
Lend a 
hand to all, I 
say, 
In their sunshine and their sorrow, 
And the prize we've lost to- day 
May become our own to- morrow.

While riding on the railway cars the other day, 
A 
very funny incident happened by the way; 
A woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
C;ot on at a 
way station, convenient to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her rail, 
And turning to me, asked Is this the Morning Mail? 
I 
told her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When suddenly in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loafer ! she says to me, Its very well you knows ; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady so. 
Says I, Madam. what I'm guilty of I'm sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose again in haste, 
And says. Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for tickling of my legs. 
In the railway etc. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her—she was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
I 
ler great big market basket, and then, how very shocking ! 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, as I 
now have shown to you. 
CHESAPEAKE BAY. 
Sung by DAN COLLYER. 
Jake stood on de deck of an oyster boat, 
And he throwed up his hands, and he cried 
Good. bye, Liz; when I 
conic. back 
I'll make you my blooming bride. 
Liz stood on de shore, and she waved her handkerchief, 
As de good ship sailed away, a! 
And she hollered Jake! fetch me up a 
moss of clams, 
When you get down to Chesapeake Bay. 
When da got down de Bay, de commenced to drudge, 
But a 
thunder storm came on; 
The lightening flashed, and the billows dashed. 
And the Pungee was rocked in the storm. 
Jake tried to reach de eastern shore, 
But he could not do it that day, 
And the Pungee went down. and the crew was drowned 
In the woods on de Chesapeake Bay. 
When tidings came by telegraph 
That Jake was lost at sea, 
Liz nulled off her shoes, when she heard de dreadful news, 
And down on her back she lay ; 
She cut her throat, with a 
bar of soft soap, 
And she died that very same day, 
And her spirit flew to join de crew, 
-w ay down on du Cheaspeake Bay.

And find no latch on de golden gate?

THE OLD HORSE, 
Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
When I 
was a 
young horse, and in my youthful prime, 
My master used to ride on me, and thought me very fine. 
Poor old horse I Poor old horse! 
But now I'm growing old, and nature does decay. 
My master frowns upon me, and these words to me does say, 
Poor old horse! 
Poor old horse! 
When I 
was a 
young horse, I've travelled for many a 
mile 
Over hedges, over ditches, over bridges, gates, in style. 
Poor old horse 
Poor old horse! 
But now I'm growing old, and nature does decay. 
My master frowns upon me, and these words to me does say, 
Poor old horse! 
Poor old horse! 
To anyone I 
will give my old horse, and his shoes, 
And as for his old carcass for glue they won't refuse. 
Poor old horse I Poor old horse I 
For now I'm growing old, and scarcely fit to crawl. 
I'm forced to eat the coarsest grass, that grows against the wall. 
Poor old horse!

WIIISPER while we tell to you 
A 
story that is short and thrue, 
The rayson why we had to go 
Across the raging water. 
The British army we did jine. 
They 'listed us for twelve years time, 
And thought they had us very fine, 
But we skipped across the water. 
CHOW'S.

Shug a

Shugar in the tax-pot, 
How are you? 
Away on the big ship we did go. 
Across the raging water. 
We liked the army well enough, 
But rations there were very tough, 
They fed us on salt junk and dull., 
And stirabout and water. 
They put us in a 
coat of red, 
With a 
waivin' plume upon our head— 
We often wished that we were dead, 
Or drownded in the water. 
Shug a 
roog, a 
roog, sling, k,c. 
They made us swear to sarve the Queen, 
They took from us our coat of green, 
They took our ould dudeens away, 
And threw them in the water. 
Then we resolved to take Frinch hive, 
For liberty we did sAtely grieve, 
The British guard we did desave, 
And skipped across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a

And now we're in Amerikay, 
We do our wot-.: and get our pay, 
And many's the time we've blessed the day. 
We skipped across the water. 
The stars and stripes are o'er our head, 
The green does wave above the red, 
And British laws no more we dread, 
Since we'te across the water.

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Words and Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
Written express-
for TIERNEY S
.: Cnoms. 
Oh, let ye stand from under now and open wide your ears. 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West thay made us go 
And we worked at canalling in the State of Oh-ho-ho. 
But when the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
Company and wint into the fray; 
We fought the ragged rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they could'nt bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our laa, ha, ha, ha, hayfoot, straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many's the time we thought we'd thought we'd never 
see our homes again; 
The rebels fought like devils but their fighting was in vain, 
For they could'nt bate the Sligo Musteteers. 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and wid Grant -
w.f._ 
took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, though he was small, our gallant little 
Mac ; 
Faith 
if they'd let him have his way, he'd surely drive 
thim back, 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers. 
Sure, he knew how to Engineer, likewise to command; 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c. 
But now our lave of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd ax you all to take a 
ball, but we're without a 
chat; 
On Erie shares, and all such snares, our money it is lint— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers. 
We'll say Good Evening, one and all, your pardon, too, 
we crave, 
We did our duty, manfully, this country for to save; 
May the Shamrock and the Stars and Stripes in triumph 
ever wave, 
Wei the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c. 
IT'S NICE, 
15 
Written expressly for;LrrrLE Bon, by BEN DODGE. 
Some time ago I 
loved a 
girl, 
And very strange to say, 
Although she claimed to worship me, 
She'd a 
peculiar way 
Of acting very shy and strange, 
Whenever I 
was nigh, 
And when I 
asked the reason then, 
To me she would reply— 
CHORUS. 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so? 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Now that's what I 
exclaim; 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so ? 
Most everybody says it is, 
Of course I 
think the same. 
We're married now, and happy live 
As two doves in a 
nest, 
And with a 
charming family 
Our union has been blest; 
We've got a 
pair of bouncing twins— 
A 
lovely girl and boy, 
And the pleasures of our married life 
There's nothing can annoy. 
It's nice, etc. 
Now there's my next door neighbor, who 
Is known as Deacon Brown, 
Supposed by every one to be 
The straightest man in town; 
But I 
caught him late last Sunday night, 
Doing something wrong I'm sure, 
lie was trying to kiss his servant girl 
Behind the pantry door. 
SPOKEN.—I said, " Here, here, 
Deacon, stop! 
That's 
naughty." 
But be only said, " I 
know it is, Bobby, but--
It's nice," etc. 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket- book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
lie talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
I 
tell you its no fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill. 
Wall a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose. 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gull, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law. 
(Ant— Old Song.) 
I'VE a 
daughter who's surely gone crazy, 
It is a 
hard thing, I 
declare; 
She's now a 
theatrical lady, 
And wears a 
wig over her hair. 
She says " Wilt thou meet me by moonlight ? 
My heart's blood I 
would lose for thee !" 
She strikes attitudes in the kitchen, 
And kisses her fingers at me, 
CHORUS. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinness, 
And employs all her time washing clothes, 
But at night on the stage she's a 
countess, 
And they call her the " Lady Montrose," 
Shure, the wash-tub she calls it a 
castle, 
The soap is a 
dagger so keen, 
The coal-box she calls it a 
grotto— 
Such goings on I've niver seen, 
ghe stabs herself with a 
potato, 
And says "' Tis for thee, love, I 
die !" 
On the ceiling she has a 
tomato, 
And calls it the moon in the sky. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinniss, ttc. 
She tells me she'll be a 
great actress, 
Admirers she'll have by the score, 
She'll be courted by dukes, kings and princes, 
And the divel knows how many more. 
She uses my hat for a 
casket, 
For jewels she fills it with coal ; 
For a 
carriage she has the clothes-basket, 
And the clothes-pins are silver and gold. 
In the day-time she's Mary McGiniaiss, ikc 
MAN OF EDUCATION. 
Written by IIENJANIIN COLLIN:4, expressly for SHEEHAN cV, 
JONES. 
Don't talk to me of your high toned men, 
And their fluent conversation; 
There's none with me, boys, can compare, 
I 
am the greatest in the nation. 
I 
am known by all, both great and small, 
An Irishman from Donegal. 
And the ladies all say, both one and all, 
I 
am a 
man of education. 
Cuour4. 
I 
am an Irishman, both heart and hand, 
I 
have just come over to this free land, 
And I 
will have you all to understand 
I'm a 
man of education. 
I 
am never taken for Charley Ross, 
I'm a 
man of solid foundation; 
I 
will tell you, boys, that I'm the boss, 
And I 
am proud of my high station. 
Of the war in Europe I 
know all about, 
A 
brass band follows me when I

As sung by KONOLLMAN and RITTIE with great success. 
Also 
sung by CONROY and MURPHY nightly, 
Here we are, two " Log3cawanna Spooners ;" 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang," 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang,"

As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and endurance; 
With other scallawags we have no interference; 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the "General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like "Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We could put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang."

MICHAEL MURPHY. 
Sung by ED. HARRIGAN at the Theatre Comique. 
Ten years ago I 
stepped on board 
A 
ship to England bound, 
My heart and pockets both were Hg 
Though I'd not got a 
pound; 
I 
was but a 
young greesheen then, 
Without deceit or sham, 
But times and things have altered 
With myself and now I 
am— 
CHORUS. 
Mister Michael Murphy, a 
man of great ability, 
Known and respected too by all the gentility, 
Patronized by all the nobs amongst the great nobility, 
For Mister Michael Murphy is a 
well known man, 
I 
got some work to carry bricks, 
At fourteen bob a 
week, 
But soon I 
got the sack, because 
They said I'd too much cheek; 
So I 
fell back upon the club, 
And when I 
let them see, 
That I 
was full of book learning, 
They made a 
secretary—of 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc 
From that they made me president 
Of our new Home Rule league, 
And I 
soon got acquainted with 
An M. P. Mister Teague; 
My spechifying was so good, 
I 
soon got into fame, 
And everybody tells me that 
The man to make a 
name—is 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
My letters now are all addressed 
Michael Murphy, esquire, 
And if I 
get in Parliament 
I'll set the house on are; 
With my great and burning eloquence, 
I'll teach them the right way, 
To satisfy the Home Rule League, 
Then every one will say— 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
23 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
He said he learned them up at some free and aisy: 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him, 
He broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
He have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring lessons from Professor John 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity, 
He goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night,. 
For to fight a 
big black nagur; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young man, 
Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
He got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
He have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to the bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that he'll be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
He kicked his sister, Honorah in the forehead last week, 
He wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boiled oyster stews, 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

Come listen to me one an' all, 
To what I'm goin' to say, 
It's all about a 
neighbor o' mine, 
Who lives across the way ; 
He's the owner of a 
big coal cart, 
An' he likewise drives the same, 
An' he got a 
great big billy goat, 
Who's very much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For whin he'd jump, he'd hit you a 
thump, 
Unless you'd quickly slope 
Oh, the terror of the neighborhood 
Is Gilfillen's big buck goat I 
I'll tell you of the damages, 
That he's done all around, 
He wint into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I 
tell you there was a 
row, 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, etc,. 
Now it was here this afthernoon, 
He came into my yard, 
While I 
was plantin' flowers, 
And he stbruck me nur-hty hard: 
He knocked me down, jumped on me, 
An' he ate the tail o' me coat, 
Blue'd glass have no effect at all 
O. Gilfillen's big buck goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
Last Snnday week he ate my shirt, 
He also ate my hat, 
An' he also knocked the slituffin' 
Out of Mrs. Maloney's cat; 
I'm goin' to get a 
warrant now, 
(For my back is nearly broke,) 
To have Gilfillen arrested, 
And his son of a 
gun of a 
goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
DUNDREARY O'DONNELL, 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, in SCANLAN & CRONIN°, 
original Irish comedy farce, entitled " O'Donnell's Victory." 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
I'm a 
man of great renown, 
It's just about twinty years ago, 
Since I 
landed in this town; 
An' since that time I 
a 
family raised, 
Which I'm very proud to tell, 
An' in this city iver since, 
Wid me frinds I've had to dwell. 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
An' all the people say, 
I'm the coming man of this great place— 
The rest have had their day. 
As I 
walked out this mornin', 
Sure all the people said— 
" 
There goes O'Donnell, the candidate, 
By him we're to be led; 
Arrah! he's the man that'll rule New York, 
An' won't he cut a 
shine— 
Whin he goes over to Washington, 
As a 
Senator so fine!" 
Dundreary O'Donnell, etc. 
Now that the election is over, 
An' the glorious battle is won, 
My kindest thanks I 
offer to those, 
For the work they have done; 
And whin I 
take my sate, my frinds, 
The public thin I'll show— 
That Dundreary O'Donnell is the people's choice, 
Wherever he may go.

THE DAY WE LEFT THE OLD DART. 
Written by JoHN SHEEHAN, and sung by STIEEnAs & JONES in 
their original Irish Comedy Farce, entitled " The Day 
we left the Old Dart." 
In dear old Ireland we were born, 
It's many years ago; 
And raised up in sweet Monaghan, 
It's the place where we're from, oh. 
We came over in the ship called Dreadnaught, 
From friends we had to part; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
CHORUS. 
We are poor old Irish green horns, 
It was hard for us to part; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
The morning the ship left Liverpool dock, 
Our poor mother did say, 
" 
God bless ye, me darling children, 
For you're going to America; 
You are going across the ocean," 
We thought of it on the spot, 
We often sit down and curse the day, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
We are poor, etc.

Kind friends if you will listen now, 
My woes I'll now tell you ; 
My heart is nearly broken, 
And I 
don't know what to do; 
No matter where I 
chance to go, 
Nor wherever I 
may be, 
The blackguards cry as I 
pass by, 
O'Reily, you're N. G. 
If I 
go into a 
tavern, 
And call out for a 
boos, 
The gang says I 
must treat them 
Or their frend.ship I 
will lose ; 
And if I 
do refuse them, 
Their heads they shake at me, 
And sing out Philadelphia— 
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
It was just before election 
I 
was called to make a 
speech, 
For a 
friend of mine, 
Whose name was Thomas Lich; 
The gang was there, I 
do declare, 
And when I 
did begin, 
They said, for God's sake, fire him out 
Where did he get his wind ? 
They made such a 
terrible noise; 
And all at once I 
felt a 
brick 
Hit me between the eyes, 
And through the door I 
fled, for sure; 
Sure they meant to murder me, 
And when I 
was outside 
I 
heard them cry, 
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
The slang the gang is using now, 
You'll hear from every lip ; 
Its shoot the hat! and get it boiled; 
And don't you lose your grip! 
They say I'm too fresh, and too bran new. 
And will I 
ever drop, and stag his nips, 
And skip the gutter, and hit him with a 
7,
p. 
The children there are using the slang, 
As well as every one. 
They'll say to me, go take a 
bath I 
And why don't I 
take a 
run? 
And then they'll say, 
Go stop the coat, so long as Tra la la lee! 
But the worst of all 
Is when they bawl—

I 
like this City well enough, but here I

Go where I

The blackguards do make fun of me, 
And when I 
bid them stop, 
They say, now " cheese it," Old Times Rocks. 
I'm tould you carry a

I 
don't know what they mane at all, they think that they 
are smart; 
They say to me, go hire a 
hall, and tell me I'm too tart ; 
They tell me to go bounce myself, and call me old boy crop, 
But divil a 
word like this I've heard, I'm tould you carry 
The blackguards, &c. 
They call me tough man, and they say I 
carry a

They howl from every corner, stag the pigeon-toed galute. 
And when I

And crack it light, ould coffin back„ I'm tould you carry

When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry chit, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I

He called me a

vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above.

So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy ! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a

The noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border.. 
Arrah ! But the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly dressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder ; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
!'or she could'ut resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St, Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure, but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky ! 
With here and there a 
bit of a

The result of a 
drop of whiskey ! 
If Mike and Pat come out of a

With eyes of their own adorning, 
Divil a

P.t, Patrick's Day in the Morning," 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator; 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
Of " St. Patrick's day in the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you a 
wack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning!"

And a

And live as well as those big bugs

When there's public work to do.

NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU! 
As Sung b7 ALICE Munney, in their Sketch Terry's Return. 
Sweetly, the stars up above us are dreaming. 
The birds they are dreaming of morn ; 
Sad is the moon, though in radiance beaming, 
She is dreaming, alone and forlorn ; 
Roses and lilies, so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew ; 
So, when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true? 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment, 
While Norah, your Norah, is dreaming of you. 
Tho' you forget me, when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own ; 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling, alone ? 
Come to my heart, like a 
bird that is weary, 
0 
come to your Norah so true ; 
Linger not long, for the days they are dreary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting. so sadly and lonely. 
0, tell me, if still you are true ; 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment only, 
For Norab, your Norah, is dreaming of you.

For we've • ust landed, ust landed, 
We landed over there you know. 
We've landed, just landed. 
We're the two Irish cuckoos 
Cutting turf was our occupation, 
In the bogs of Allen then 
But they say that in this nation 
We'll at least be aldermen. 
We will run for big positions; 
In offices of note 
We'll join the 2oliticians 
And of course for us you'll vote. 
or we've just, M. 
When we go back to Ireland 
Sure then it will be said 
We'll raise up in our sire-land 
The rs,reen above the red. 
Then all this world will glory 
When e'er they hear the news 
Of Ireland and the story of 
The two Irish Cuckoos. 
As sung by ALICE 13ENITETT, 
Oh! Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin` 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground ; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
For there's a 
bloody law agin, the -wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with Napper Tandy and he tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for • Wearin' o' 
the Green !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear, is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sous wilt ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and east it on 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still, tho' under foot ' tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
not show; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen; 
But ' till that day, please God, I'll stick to 
Wearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part ; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
And where, thank God, we'll live and die, still " Wearin" 
o' the Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
An original Irish Comic Song as written and sung by JAMES 
O'NEIL the great Irish Comedian and 'Vocalist with tremendous 
success, at the various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne.er deny the same, 
1 
took a 
notion to cross the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, -White 
and the Blue. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes, for me on Election day. 
-When I 
started first in Politics, my friends they were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that I 
was too "brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
Tie \vas foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a 
big ash- ,-.;art. 
I 
am your candidate. &c. 
So now my friends I 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont ferget to vote, for me on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor-man's 
friend.

THE T. A. B. 
WrittAi and sung by O'NEIL, Comtoy and M URPHY, grand. 
children of Father Matthew, 
at Gill's Mammoth Concert 
Hall, 65 W. lions on St., N. Y. 
We are a 
jolly band, 
The greatest in the land, 
We once enjoyed a 
social glass 
As long as we could stand. 
But now we've changed our ways, 
And look for better days, 
have joined that band of happiness 
Called the T. A. B. 
Cnonus. 
Yes, we have joined the army of the T. A. B 
We nothing drink but Croton. forget what

We are a

Since.we have joined the T. A. B.

There we go now, give us a

Marching away with the life and the drain: 
Xl tell the story, we go for glory, 
Soldleii.; to ftglit for the kin0-4m come 
We take our water pure. 
While whiskey you secure, 
We are on the road to glory, 
The shortest path, that's sure.

And the ",T. A. 13's" our cry.

You see how strong we seem, 
Bad whiskey's but a

'Tis but the skim milk of the world, 
Cold water sure's the cream! 
But we are allowed to take, 
If our pledge we do not break, 
A 
drop of the " old cratur," boys, 
Just for the stomach's sake. 
Yes, we have joined, &c. 
March and Chorus — There we go now, &c. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
While out in the country last Summer I 
wedded ' 
A blushing young damsel whom I 
thought sublime, 
immediately after we moved to the city, 
Where we have lived happy the most of the time; 
Until last Friday night my homestead I 
entered, 
I 
saw there a 
young man, nineteen if a 
day, 
And tws I 
gazed at him, completely bewildered, 
The wife of my bosom unto me did say— 
Cnours. 
Don't take any notice, it's only my cousin, 
Don't let a 
small matter like this one annoy ; 
Now don't get excited, it's only my cousin, 
You mustn't mind Willie—he's only a 
boy. 
My wife with her cousin was very much smitten, 
At least so it seemed by her actions that night, 
For she called him 't Dear Willie" in tones very tender, 
Now I 
ask any married man if it was right; 
When the clock on the mantel struck the hour of eleven, 
She kissed him good- night ere he went to his bed, 
I 
sprang to my feet in a 
horrible passion, 
But my wife stopped my growling, and quietly said— 
Don't take any notice, etc. 
Next evening as I 
was from labor returning, 
A 
friend told me something which addled my brain, 
My wife and her cousin had " sloped" from the city, 
He'd seen them buy tickets and leave on the train; 
I 
rushed to the house, at the door met the servant, 
The truth of the statement I 
read in her face, 
My wife had shook me for her dear cousin Willie, 
She'd left her fond husband to live in disgrace, 
>7-,_'POREN.—After my friend had given me the unwelcome in-
formation I 
rushed frantically home. 
The door was locked; 
v,-ith one tremendous kick I 
burst it open. 
The servant girl 
met me in the hall and said, " Good Heavens, Mr. Dodge 
what 
is the matter ?" 
I 
asked for my wife; she told me the madam 
had only gone out for a 
short walk. (Even the servants were 
conspiring against me.) 
I 
hurried up stairs to our bedchamber. 
There upon the dressing- case lay a 
note addressed to me. 
I 
quickly picked it up, tore it open, and there, plainly written I 
read— 
Written by Wintiot SCANLAN, and performed by the famous 
SCANLAN & CRONIN. 
Air—" Trish P,egiment... 
Just cast your eyes upon us. 
We're dressed up in the style, 
We are two nobby coachmen, 
And we're from mild Erin's Isle; 
Arrah! it's many a 
happy day we seen, 
In that Isle so far away, 
And the same we spint ever sThee we came 
To swate America. 
When first we landed in New York, 
We wint to Union Square, 
Where we were engaged to drive 
A coach by a 
man named Pare: 
He brought us to his residence, 
Which was in Fourteenth Street, 
And the way we dressed and turned out, 
With us nothing could compete. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers, 
For the land of America, 
The same for dear ould Erin's Isle, 
Although she's far away; 
And whin ye meet us in the street, 
Yer hats to us just rise, 
And yell find we're just what ye may call— 
Two noble Irish boys. 
was engaged as footman, 
C.—And I 
was engaged to drive, 
And the way we turned out you'd think 
We were the happiest men alive; 
As we'd drive along through Broadway, 
The people all would say— 
" 
There goes two noble Trish boys, 
Oh, my ! don't they look gay!" 
Our boots and buttons shining bright, 
Our clothes so nice and clean, 
Such nobby Irish boys, my friends, 
Ne'er before was seen; 
And though we're now in America. 
And every thing is serene, 
We'll ne'er forget the land of our birth— 
That Emerald Isle so green. 
Then give three hearty cheers, etc. 
THE FLANNEL-MOUTH MICK.. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH. 
As sung by JOHNNY KENM.L. 
I 
KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
CLIOIXS. 
Oh, they yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick !" 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel-mouth mick. 
The other day while a- walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet. 
Says I, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma vick;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel-mouth mick." 
Oh, they yell out, etc, 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. McGuinness, 
flow are you to- day ? good day." 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel-mouth mick, 
Oh; they yell out, etc. 
W ,Akten by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by the famous SHEEHAN' 
& 
JONES in their original sketch entitled " The Arrival 
of the Murphys." 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Street, 
Where lives our brother Dan, 
He is an American citizen, 
Likewise an alderman.

We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ocean, 
To become American citizens, 
Where could you find an Irish 1,Lir 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare, 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats, 
Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may go.

JOCKEY CLUB BOUQUET, 
Words by ROBERT W OBEEN, of W ORDEN 
MACK. 
One evening in July, 
When the sunset gilt the sky, 
And the little birds were warbling ' mid the trees; 
I 
met a 
maiden fair, 
With wavy golden hair, 
Who seemed to lend a 
perfume to the breeze. 
Tier eyes of dreamy blue, 
Her cheeks of brilliant hue, 
And a 
merry song she warbles all the day ; 
Her name she would not tell, 
And as I 
loved her well, 
I 
christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
It's true I'm deep in love, (
break) 
win the girl, by Jove, (break) 
For she's promised to be mine, 
.Before the Winter time, 
And don't I 
wish to see the wedding day ; 
For her name she will not tell, 
And as I 
love her well, 
l've christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
(Dance.' 
She is as gentle as a 
dove, 
And bashful as her love, 
And says that I'm an impudent young man; 
And when I 
ask a 
kiss 
From this charming little miss, 
She tries to hide her face behind her fan. 
But if my wooing thrives, 
And the wedding day arrives, 
And to the church with me she'll gaily trip away; 
Why, if the fun you'd view, 
.111 introduce to you— 
My charming little Jockey Club Bouquet. 
It's true, etc.

Charlotte Temple. —To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures, 
sympathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving 
truth stranger than fiction." The poet' e 
line° 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple ; 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tie old-
1st and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have

monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
tour rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many or the an. 
severs depend upon the position certain cards bear to otiler cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tue directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difli. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. AS 
a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
