Interview with Beacham McDougald 
June 26, 2017 
Interviewed at the Laurinburg Chamber of Commerce in Laurinburg, North Carolina, 
by Sarah Bryan for Folklife of the Funeral Services Profession 
Sarah Bryan: So you were talking about Ma'com.1 
Beacham McDougald: Okay. Leaving the railroad, in 1881 he went back to doing 
what he was doing before, which was running a retail establishment, which was 
specializing in general hardware and undertaking. And he used his cabinetmaking 
skills to build some of the things that he actually sold, including the coffins, for 
undertaking. And at that time, undertakers generally supplied a wagon, and a coffin, 
and they would dress the person. And funerals, if you can imagine in the 1880s with no 
embalming, particularly in the summertime, it was kind of like, "We got to get Mama in 
the ground tomorrow morning." The customs at that time in this part of rural North 
Carolina was the body never left the house until it was taken to the cemetery. The 
person died at home, the undertaker's job was to wash the body, to dress it, to place it 
in a coffin. The funeral was always held at the home. It was then placed in the hearse, 
and everybody walked or rode behind the hearse to the graveyard, which at that time 
was somewhere close to wherever the family lived. If you lived in the community of 
Laurinburg where there was a cluster of houses, we had a city cemetery. If you lived in 
the country, you went to your church cemetery or your family cemetery. And Scotland 
County has got over 200 cemeteries that have been identified so far. A lot of them are 
family cemeteries out in the woods that nobody knew about. But the custom in those 
days without embalming was you could delay things during the winter, because of the 
natural cold air, but summertime it was urgent. And it was very simple. You know, 
hand fans were what people kept cool with. Electricity was a novelty, if it even existed. 
And it did exist in the people that had more affluency. And then as it moved into the 
20th century, you know, Laurinburg started growing up and so forth, and building, and 
near the end of the 19th century, his building burned. There was a fire that destroyed all 
of downtown Laurinburg. And at that time, before they rebuilt the community, they 
came up with what they called the fire zone. Any building put in downtown 
Laurinburg had to have brick walls. So during that time, they moved to temporary 
quarters north of the railroad tracks, and he built the three-story building, in 1903, 
which still stands right beside the railroad track on North Main Street. And the first two 
floors were the furniture and hardware, and the third floor was where he kept caskets. 
And at that time, the caskets were being shipped in on the rail, they would pick them 
up, bring them to the funeral home, and there at the funeral home they would put the 
padding and the liners in the casket. And the livery stable was where— You know, you 
go back, and today you realize, well, the funeral home had a hearse, didn't they? No. 
1 M. A. McDougald (1827-1909), Beacham McDougald's great-grandfather, whose first 
name, Malcolm, was pronounced "Ma'com" (like "Macon"). 
The funeral home rented a hearse from the livery stable, along with the horses, every 
time there was a funeral. I look back at some old bills, charges and things, that they had 
on itemized funeral statements back then, and there was always a charge for livery. 
And I found some old invoices, and the names of the livery stables that they rented the 
hearses and the horses from. And it was tradition in those days, if the person that died 
was a child, the hearse was white; if the person that died was an adult, the hearse was 
black. I guess it was a way of just saying the purity and innocence of a child versus the 
adult. But we have to remember that during those days, a lot of children died of 
childhood diseases. My great-grandfather, upon completion of that building, and 
moving into it the first of 1904, he had his three sons joining him; and that was Will, 
Dan, and John, who was my grandfather and the youngest. John was born in 1870. And 
1909, my grandfather Ma'com died, and at that time the three brothers made the 
decision, "John, you're going off to embalming school and we're going to learn to offer 
embalming." So John went off to Cincinnati for what was then a six-week course. That 
was in 1910. And he returned, and he was the first embalmer in about a 25- or 30-mile 
radius. So it was a situation in those days —you've got to think about it— all the roads 
were dirt roads. The major transportation factor was the railroad, and it came right 
beside their store. There were times when somebody would die perhaps in Lumberton, 
or die in Rockingham, and they needed to be embalmed; and they'd take them to the 
railroad station, put them in a car that was going to Laurinburg, to go to Laurinburg. 
My granddaddy would embalm him, send him back to Rockingham or Lumberton. 
(Laughs) So. You know, the thing about embalming in those early days is that it 
allowed families to come together. As I said, transportation was lower in those days, 
and if you lived 40 miles away, you know, getting there by road was difficult, getting 
there by railroad was possible, but you had to go with the train schedule. 
And just looking at some of the old statements I saw where a person in Laurinburg died 
in 1916,1 believe it was, in Lumberton, and my granddaddy contracted with a furniture 
store down there who picked up the man and put him in a coffin, and put him on the 
train, and sent him to Laurinburg, where he was embalmed, and they had the funeral 
here in Laurinburg, and they had all the livery charges itemized on it and getting the 
grave dug and so forth. And that funeral ended up costing, astronomically, over $200. 
SB: 1916. 
BM: 1916. That was probably a big fee. There's, I think, in those days, as I said, 
the funerals were always done in the house. The churches were, hadn't caught on in this 
area like that. It was always traditional to stay with the house. 
SB: In town as well as out in the country? 
BM: In town as well as out of town. And even when I got into the business, 
there was times where, after we picked up the person from wherever they passed and 
did the preparation, we took them back home and even had funerals in the house. My 
grandfather died in 1955, and his funeral was at his house, because that's what his 
generation did. Most people still liked to bring the body home, because that was the 
custom. And I think— The funeral, to me, is a study in America's changing culture. 
Because it used to be that death was very close and personal, because it always 
happened in the home, because rural areas had hospitals but they were not hospitals 
that could do everything like we can today. They just kept the patient comfortable, 
could bandage wounds and things of that nature. 
Thinking about that, it was such a very sociable thing, and even the early funerals I can 
remember from the '60s and '70s. I think about my mother's funeral; I was away in 
college when she passed, in the early '70s, and I came home from Atlanta and our house 
was full of people. Friends came and went. We did not have visitation at the funeral 
home, we had them at the house. The kitchen had more food in it than you could eat for 
two weeks. And it was just overwhelming community support, people turning out 
because that's what they did. Later, just a few years later, not even 20 years later, maybe 
10 years later, most visitation moved from the house to the funeral home. We see very 
few people that even want the addresses listed now, because American society, "Oh, 
that vase I had, where did it get to?" or "Something valuable disappeared from the 
house." And it's sad to say, but that's today's world. We're more digitally connected, by 
so many different communication devices —Facebook, social media —that today you're 
seeing more people put on Facebook, "Mama died," and people send them 
condolences. And you think, "Oh, this is going to be a big funeral. That person has had 
200-and-some condolences sent to them on Facebook." So you prepare as a funeral 
director for a large crowd. And 25 people show up. You know, the personal interaction 
has become more, "I expressed my condolences, I did my part." And I think that's a sad 
testament to Americans as a whole, is that we're getting away from the close personal 
interactions and becoming more digitally connected. And I think digital connections are 
good, but they should enhance the personal connections. I know you; if I see you 
somewhere, we're going to sit and talk. But if you lose someone and I'm close to you. 
I'm going to be there to offer my support, because nothing replaces the personal 
support. And that's becoming less and less, in today's society, compared to what it was 
20, 30,40 years ago. But we've gone from the home to the funeral home, to less 
formality. Even the Catholic Church. I don't know whether the unchanging nature I 
notice in the Catholics, where the parish priest is going to say, "This is the way we're 
going to do the service," but the family wants to add something personal to it, and he'll 
say, "No, we don't do that here," then the family will say, "Well, we're not going to 
have a mass here, we're going to just have something at the funeral home chapel or the 
graveside." And I have seen that done. As a matter of fact, the last three Catholic 
services that I did, the family did not go to the church or do anything at the church. 
They went to the graveside and had somebody else to do it. We're losing our connection 
to tradition at a faster pace than ever. I retired, am glad I did, because I appreciated the 
old way a little bit better. But I enjoyed the new way, because it did — technology, such 
as displaying pictures of a person's life, writing obituaries that tell their stories, 
something that wasn't done 20, 30,40 years ago. To me that could add to the tradition, 
but it's more or less replaced it. Back in 20, 30,40 years ago, churches were literally full 
on Sunday. Today, you look around most churches, particularly if you live in an area 
like this which is just a hop, step, and a leap from the ocean, and a lot of church 
members have beach homes, you know where they are on the weekends? (Laughs) I 
mean. I'm not knocking them, but that's just today's society. We're more affluent and 
we do what we want to do on weekends. I just love to keep the old ways alive, because, 
in my studies, I go back and I look for the personal interactions more than the dates and 
the big historical parts. I like to look at the small, personal part. And that was what was 
so profound about the funerals of the middle of the 20th century on to almost the end of 
the 20th century. And when the internet came along, it seemed like, "Well, I can send 
them an email," but a personal note—just sitting down sending a personal note, versus 
an email, or a statement on Facebook. (Laughs) Sometime we get desensitized, and I 
wonder sometimes if people really mean it. But today, as I said, the business where I 
had, we were doing over, I would say, we were serving families that chose cremation 
over half the time. I can remember, I finished my — I started working in funeral service 
in 1972, and went three years before we had the first cremation. And then, "Where will 
we take it to have it cremated?" Had to take the person all the way to Durham, to Duke 
Medical Center, or then just called Duke Hospital. And then I was just talking with 
someone who's at the funeral home we used to own, and they said, "Last two days, 
other funeral homes brought us 11 cremations." So they're doing a lot for other funeral 
homes around here. And nothing against cremation, but the main thing is, still, people 
have lost somebody near and dear, and there's nothing—I still go back to saying— 
there's nothing that replaces your personal appearance, personally being there, a 
personal hug, touch, a personal note if you can't be there, a handwritten note. So. Okay. 
Let's stop with that. What other topic do you want to cover? (Laughs) 
SB: No, this is great. How, in terms of how things have changed in the last 40, 45 
years, what about differences between races' and ethnicities' — white, African American, 
Indian—funerals? 
BM: I think African American funerals are still heavily attended. And there's a close 
bond there. They are gradually starting to do cremation, but they still revere the body, 
the physical body there, as the focal point of the funeral. I've been to several African 
American funerals this year, of people that I knew, and, you know, you never see it at a 
white funeral but every one of them, they got up and read every card that the family 
received from a friend, a condolence card. That tells you something. 
SB: Read it during the service? 
BM: They read what the card actually said. You can actually say, "Well, I've seen that 
card before," but then you read the little note under that— they wouldn't tell who it was 
from —but they would read every one of those cards. You know, to me that is a personal 
touch. These people are reaching out. And the families, they will, may go to a funeral 
home and have an hour-long visitation or they may be at their house, or they see some 
people at the church or anything, but they're much more physically and emotionally 
connected with each other than you see in the white population. I went to a Native 
American, or Lumbee Indian, service on Saturday. And it was a totally different 
experience. And when I went to it—it was in Pembroke, which is — and the man was the 
funeral director. 
SB: Was this Mr. Locklear?2 
BM: Mm-hmm. 
SB: I saw his obituary. 
BM: Yeah, and I sat there, and when the family—when I got there there was no 
register book to sign, which. I'm sitting there thinking, "They won't know I'm here 
unless they see me." And then when the family walked into the church, my wife and I 
stood up, and we looked around, and nobody else was standing up, so we sat down. 
And then when the minister got up and said, "We're going to sing the first hymn," and 
said what it was, my wife and I and everybody else on my row stood up, and we were 
the only ones in the church standing up, so we sat down. (Laughs) Then when they did 
the second congregational hymn, the preacher looked at us, and said, "Tm going to ask 
everybody to stand this time." (Laughs) But a man—there were two speakers, and there 
was a friend of the man who gave a story about his life and what he was like and 
everything, which did not really get too personal, but just a little bit. And then the 
minister, he gave a sermon that could have been any Sunday morning sermon. He 
never mentioned the man's name. And I miss that part. I think— You know, in the 
African American and the white population, and even the Lumbee Indians that live 
here in Scotland County, they're more into making sure the person's name is 
prominently mentioned throughout the service. I was surprised that it was so different 
in Pembroke. 
SB: Yeah, just one county over. 
BM: But it was a beautiful service still. It was an experience, because I didn't know 
what to do. I felt like, first the register book's not here; second thing, you don't stand up 
when the family comes in, you don't stand up when the family's going out. It's just, 
there are differences, but I'm not one to say that they're right or wrong. I'm just saying I 
know what I'm used to. But I do appreciate the fact that the African American 
2 Samuel R. Locklear, Sr. (1928-2017), longtime owner of Locklear & Son Funeral Home 
in the Lumbee community of Pembroke, North Carolina. 
population, they do turn out for their funerals. The whites will turn out more if it's a 
notable person—and Tm not just saying financially notable, Tm saying someone who 
made contact with a lot of friends, or someone who died tragically always brings out a 
lot of people. Still, I think about status funerals, or those where someone has, that lives 
in an area, has been in a retirement community and unable to get out, and all their 
family moves away, and then you have a funeral, you look around and might can count 
on ten fingers the number of friends that bothered to come. We're living longer, and 
dying slower. And as I said, the digital age— I think about last, a week ago Sunday, a 
young lady who was eight years younger than I am, I think—yeah—but I've known her 
and her daddy all my life, her sisters. She passed, and she was living in Indiana, and 
through the internet I contacted her two sisters that I knew and her stepmother, and 
expressed my condolences, because they all live in Upcountry South Carolina, 
Wilmington, and Rock Hill, South Carolina. And the one that died lived in Indiana. 
(Laughs) You know, we're spread out more, and I think that has a lot to do with the 
way things are being done today. And I know they asked me to send you, "Would 
you" — and I said, "I'm not in the family business," but the stepmother contacted me 
and asked me, said, "Is there room in the cemetery space in Laurinburg where her 
daddy is buried, that she could be buried there? She's being cremated." And I let her 
know, "There's plenty of room." And then she said, "Now, her mother's buried in 
McColl, South Carolina. Is there any room there?" I said, "There's plenty of room." So 
then they talked to the husband, and he said, "Tm not sure I want to release her yet," 
said, "I want to keep her in the house." So that's one thing that cremation allows, is a 
family to have time to make that final disposition at a time that's more convenient with 
the rest of the family. You know, it doesn't have to be done right then. But I'm sure, if 
that family here to come back here for a burial service and it was announced, that there 
would be dozens of people who would attend. 
SB: One thing that I was talking to Mr. Bennett about, and I hadn't thought much 
about previously—I mean, your talking about the things that cremation enables made 
me think about this — I'm interested in things that people might put it the coffin with the 
body. Does that happen often? 
BM: Yeah. 
SB: And does it matter if they're going to be buried or cremated? Do they still put an 
object in there? 
BM: Put a what on it? 
SB: Some sort of object of significance to the person. 
BM: Yeah, well, whether it's cremated or buried I don't think it really matters. I think 
about maybe a year and a half ago, an elderly couple in our church, and I knew them 
really well, the wife passed, and her wish was to be cremated. And she was. And then 
maybe a little over a year later, her husband passed. And he didn't like cremation. He 
allowed it for her, but. And we had a committal service at the cemetery, where the 
graveside service was held, with his casket, and sitting beside it was her urn, and her 
urn at the cemetery, after everybody had left, the family opened it and placed her urn in 
his arms. And they were buried together. As I said, cremation offers some opportunity 
there, that I think a lot of families get a warm feeling of that. I had a friend of mine, he 
was at Scotia Village, I'll never forget—his name was Bernie [?]. Bernie was retired 
military, he was Jewish, extremely intelligent, and his wife was smarter than he was. 
She was a member of MENSA. And when she passed, Bernie had her cremated, and we 
had a Jewish rabbi do the service. And then when Bernie died, a Presbyterian minister 
who was his friend and also retired military did the service but did it entirely using the 
Jewish ritual. And we placed his wife's ashes in his casket, and took them to Arlington, 
where he was buried, they were buried at Arlington together. And it's what he had 
wanted, he would have wanted that. And that's what he wanted done, and that's what 
was done. 
SB: Interesting that a Presbyterian minister did the Jewish service. Is that something 
that's happened here before, the cross-denominational — ? 
BM: It's happened more. As I said— As I was saying, the minister was Chaplain Tom 
Groome, who was a Presbyterian minister, who was born and raised in Groometown, 
North Carolina, outside of Greensboro, and he and Bernie were like that — I mean, they 
were good buddies. And Tom was one of these very intellectual but very compassionate 
Presbyterian ministers, and he sat down and he explained to me, "Here's what we're 
going to do, because this is a Jewish service." And I'm sitting there thinking, "Tom, 
you're a Presbyterian minister!" He says, "Yeah, but I'm doing what Bernie told me to 
do, and to get where I am today I had to know the Jewish customs as well." And you 
take that in one context, and then the facts of what I just showed, which is the last three 
Catholic services I've had, even though the people were Catholics in good standing they 
did not have a funeral mass or a priest, because the family did not want that. And they 
bring in—the last one had an Episcopal priest who was an in-law. I think is a — she was 
a daughter-in-law, and she was an Episcopal priest. And she did the service. And I 
realize how important that was, because it was a family member, and the family 
member knew her and loved her and you could tell that in the message. And the way 
the family planned that whole event around it, it was not anything that any funeral 
mass would have allowed, but the family obviously wanted it because it was 
comfortable to them. And that's the—you know, I think about probably ten year ago 
there was a thing I had on my general price list to have every family, just kind of a 
package plan, "Complete traditional funeral." When I retired last year, I couldn't tell 
you the meaning of a "complete traditional funeral," because, "Wait a minute, you 
mean we're going to do this and this? Let me go back and look over my notes and see 
how we do that." Because it's become such a change today that people are doing what 
they have value in doing. You're not old enough to remember, but I remember back in 
my high school years you had limited choices in the clothes you wore, the food you ate, 
and where you were wanting to go; number one, because everybody didn't have a car, 
you had to pile in together; number two, the clothes was all dress-up clothes, and you 
did have a pair of jeans or something like that you could wear, but nothing like we have 
choice of today. Today, think about cars; it's not a Chrysler product, a Chevrolet 
product, a Ford product. Foreign makers are here. Or let's talk about motorcycles. 
Television stations; I grew up when you could watch one channel. Today, I don't know 
how many channels and satellite stations are out there. We just have a little satellite— 
not a satellite but an antenna on our chimney, and we pick up about five stations, but 
that's plenty. But we have the internet, and we can watch everything from Netflix to — 
I've got on the Smithsonian channel and I love the Smithsonian channel. On wifi. Our 
choices today are so many that, when you start saying "traditional funeral," I would say 
less than five percent of the people have a traditional funeral. And what the traditional 
funeral meant was the person is picked up from where they died and taken into funeral 
home care, where they are embalmed, washed and dressed, placed in a casket, and 
visitation is held at the funeral home. Chairs, register stand taken to the home, where 
friends visit, food taken, the family comes to the funeral home, spends two hours the 
night before the funeral greeting family and friends, because more people can get to see 
them today at night than they can during the day. So visitations were always at least 
twice as large as the funeral. And then the next day you'd take the body to the church, 
go pick the family up in the limousine, line up the rest of the family, come to the church, 
have a traditional funeral, and then everybody would follow in procession to the 
cemetery where you would have a committal service. I would say five percent of the 
time that happens today. (Laughs) A good friend of ours died about two weeks ago — 
matter of fact, last time I talked to her she was sitting at this table. She was with our 
tourism development authority. She had a stroke. But she told me, she said, she asked 
me about cremation, and we talked about her options, and when she passed, they did 
just what I thought. She liked the idea she would be cremated, we would have a 
memorial service for her in the church that she loved. Over 400 people were there. And 
then after the service the family went into the church fellowship hall, where they 
greeted people. And they're going to scatter her ashes out on their farm. But she had 
told me that was what she wanted, and that's what they're doing. 
SB: I'm so sorry that you lost a friend. 
BM: [Emotional] Yeah. And you know, rather than sitting in church looking at a 
casket, they had a large portrait of her on the easel. And it was just [?]. It was a beautiful 
service, and it had nothing to do with the casket. It had everything to do with who she 
was. And I think that's what people are looking at today. If — I think about, too, 
downtown Laurinburg is getting ready to be revitalized, and they're bringing a bunch 
of restaurants in. They're not just going to be restaurants where you go and order 
something, but restaurants that provide experiences. You know, if you go in and order 
a sandwich, you don't just sit down at a bland table at a bland restaurant, you look at 
the pictures they have hanging on the wall, artwork, you look at the designs that they 
have professionally done, because they said, "I really felt good in that restaurant. The 
colors they used, the design, the pictures they used and everything, make dining an 
experience. And, oh, by the way, I did have a sandwich—but I can't remember what 
kind of sandwich I had!" And the same thing would be about a funeral, is you 
remember all the things that were going on around it, but if somebody were to say, 
"What kind of casket was he in?" "I don't even remember the casket. There may have 
been one, but I don't remember." So I think that's where—all of American society is 
going that way. 
SB: With funerals being more sort of personalized and less predictably traditional, 
with the idea of what's traditional being less predictable, and it sounds like funerals 
being more individualized— 
BM: It's very much more individualized. 
SB: — how much of the funeral director's job now is carrying out individual plans, 
and how much is suggesting, "We could do it this way"? 
BM: I think the funeral director has got to be what I would call a physician with great 
beside manners. You still have a job to do, and that is to get the dead where they need 
to be, and the family where they need to be. Now, the dead need to be disposed in some 
way, and you still accomplish that. But you've got to be there and explain to the family, 
and understand all the variables out there, and be able to share with the family—you 
know, let them talk and give you the clues. But then because you understand what is 
possible and what is not possible, you can say, "Let me just give you a couple of 
scenarios, see which one you like, and we can use that to maybe go in this direction." 
And even sometimes, if you'd like to have, regardless of whether they're being buried, 
cremated, whatever, if they don't want Mama's urn at the service—"Okay, are you 
going to keep Mama's cremated remains, or are you going to scatter them? After the 
service, what are your plans?" "Oh, we want to bury Mama out beside Daddy." "Okay. 
Would you want to do it before you have a service, after you have a service, or 
sometime later in the future?" and then they can say, "We want it before the service. We 
want it to be a private, intimate time for us." Okay. "What do you want it to look like at 
the cemetery when you are there? Do you want any special sounds, do you want any 
music?" People don't ever think about it, but music —to me, music tugs at the 
heartstrings more than anything, because the songs we hear that we've heard before 
takes us back to a memory. And I've had more people, when I mention music, they 
come up and they talk about something, "Gosh, Daddy loved Benny Goodman. Jazz. 
Old-time jazz, the clarinet." "Okay." I can pull up Benny Goodman on YouTube, and 
have it with the Bluetooth connected to some speakers there at the graveside. Or, being 
a Scottish population, we've got a bagpiper I can call on who can play whatever you 
want, as far as the bagpipe tune. Last summer I went to a friend's graveside service, and 
they brought a small string orchestra down from Chapel Hill to play at the graveside. 
And it was just beautiful. But when you're at a graveside, when you start talking music 
with people, and I'm trying to describe the scenery, they're thinking, "There's nothing 
but tombstones around there." Well, the view's going to be the same day after day, but 
we're talking about this time there. The music's going to be— And then, "Is there 
anybody in the family that may want to share some personal thoughts?" And they start 
talking among themselves, "What kind of thing—" "Do you feel comfortable laughing? 
What kind of mood do you want to set?" And I look over here and the son says, "Oh, I 
got to tell you about Mama's story when she did this down at the beach" or something. 
It might be something truly funny, everybody breaks out laughing again hearing about 
it. "We need to share that with the grandchildren. They're going to all be there." They 
do. Now, you've got to remember, by sharing these kind of stories with the 
grandchildren, you're educating another generation that this is what is tradition today. 
It wasn't tradition ten years ago, it won't be traditional ten years from now. So the word 
tradition, as far as funeral service, changes so much. And then after that, that particular 
service, one of the family friends who, his grandmother and grandfather lived next door 
to me, he came up and started talking about his father, who used to be Dean at the UNC 
Law School and on the Federal Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. And he said, 
"Daddy hasn't got much time." "Let's walk across here, we'll talk." So we walked over 
there. His daddy's going to be cremated, and he'll be buried. (?) He let me know where 
he was going to— "Now, we're wanting to [split?] Daddy's ashes in half, because his 
first wife and his children's mother was buried here. We want Daddy to be buried — 
And his current wife, who lived with him in Chapel Hill, they will be put together in 
Chapel Hill." And he said, "Is that unusual?" "No." "You sure?" "Yeah." "Is it illegal?" 
"You're a lawyer, you know it's not illegal." (Laughs) But you know, people want to 
discuss all of their options for things like that. I remember one friend I had, way out at 
the North Carolina Rural Heritage Center, getting ready to have a celebration or 
something, he said, "I wanted to let you know, when my time comes, I want you to 
divide my ashes up into 14 separate containers." I said, "Okay, Dan." I said, "Share 
with me what you have in mind." He said, "There are 14 special places I've been or 
lived, and I want some of them at every one of them, because they were all special to 
me." And he started giving me the story on every one. Ironically, he died two weeks 
later. And his family came in. They said, "Beacham, we've got a very unusual request 
for you." I said, "What?" "I know you've never heard anything like this, but we need 
Dan put into — " And I finished the sentence: "Fourteen different containers." (Laughs) 
They looked at me —okay. I said, "Tm sorry, but I can probably remember about five of 
the places, but—" (Laughs) And you know, the whole conversation to the family, they 
got to sit there and we talked, and they remembered or recalled the special memories at 
each one of those 14 different places. That's becoming today's ritual. There's nothing 
wrong with it. Now, they found comfort in it, I found comfort in it. Because I was the 
one to spread his ashes in one of those places, and that was where we were sitting when 
he told me what he wanted." But, you know, it's— We've had services where— I want 
to show you a picture. I think I've got it on here, matter of fact I know I've got it on 
here. [Looking for photo on his phone.] Trying to find — a friend of mine who died, itTl 
be two years ago this summer, and he was kind of a —he loved photography, and he 
was a great photographer, particularly sports scenes. And at Scotland High School, 
which is our high school, he would always be along the sidelines with his camera, 
taking pictures of everybody. And last year he passed, and —two years ago he passed — 
and he said, "I want everybody to wear team attire." Now, this was in August. There 
we are [showing photo of five people gathered, wearing team shirts] at his house. Of 
course, that's me. I'm the official undertaker. That's his sister, his brother, his aunt, and 
his father. 
SB: That's great. I love that there's three Laurinburg shirts, and then Duke and 
Carolina framing them. 
BM: He was a Carolina fan. And we cremated him, and his wish was to be scattered 
on the football field at Pate Stadium3, where we played football. Well, school was 
getting ready to get started, and I called the superintendent, and I asked permission. 
And he didn't like the idea. He said I might start a precedent. I said, "It's between me, 
you, his two brothers, and two best friends." He said, "Well, call the principal at the 
high school." I called the principal at the high school, explained to him, he said I needed 
to talk it over with the superintendent. I said, "The superintendent tossed it down to 
you." He said, "When do you want to do this?" I said, "You tell me the best time. We'll 
do it inconspicuously." He said, "We're having a big meeting for all the staff in the 
school auditorium at nine o'clock that morning. Can you do it at nine o'clock? I said, 
"Sure." So I went out and got a little plastic bucket, and I painted half of it Carolina 
blue, and the other half of it royal blue, which is Scotland High School blue. But it's also 
Duke blue. He hated Duke. (Laughs) So I told his brothers, I said, "[brothers' nicknames 
redacted]," those are his brothers' names, I said, "you see the two colors here?" They 
said, "Yeah. That's Scotland County and Carolina colors." I said, "No, it's Carolina 
colors and Duke colors." They said, "He'll come back and haint you!" Well, we started 
at one end of the field or the other, and everybody took a handful, and they walked 
away and they scattered them from wherever, and they'd come back and get another 
handful. Walked all the way from goal line to goal line. And that's where he's scattered. 
And the brothers, that's what they wanted to do. But as I said, I can't be as creative as a 
lot of people can. Everybody has their own values. And the brothers were most 
appreciative I was able to be the facilitator to make that happen. You know, it's kind of 
like cremation is —you can scatter ashes on public property, no problem. School is 
public property. But it is fenced in, therefore I felt I needed permission. You can scatter 
them on private property, with the owner's permission. You can scatter them at the 
beach between the high tide and low tide mark. But you still see people go and dump 
them off a pier, but it doesn't make any sense, that old rule said if you scatter somebody 
3 Football field at Scotland High School in Laurinburg. 
in the ocean it's got to be three miles out. Nobody pays any attention to that. I mean, the 
last time I scattered at the beach, I took it to the inland waterway and went over to the 
oyster beds, because they told me they wanted to come back as mother of pearl. And 
what the cremated remains are made of are perfect for the oysters. Yeah, it's great 
nutrition for them. So they'll get to come back as mother of pearl. But would I have 
thought about scattering somebody in an oyster bed because they wanted to come back 
as mother of pearl? No. (Laughs) But it's just that— People have different values. I had 
one person, he wanted to be flown, wanted to have his ashes scattered off of Cape 
Hatteras from an airplane. And that was done. We facilitated that happening. It's just— 
you know, I still feel, in all of that, people still want someplace that bears a name, that 
that person lived. You know, years ago cemeteries were the gathering places on Sunday 
afternoons, because we didn't have TV, we didn't have radio, and people went to 
cemeteries on Sunday and cleaned off graves, and it was a social thing. We don't do 
that anymore today. People still want to have something somewhere with their name 
on it. And our son is not buried on our cemetery lot, but there is a marker there for him. 
And I think you see a lot of places where — and even if you go to the vet clinic in 
Raleigh, the vet school—you'll see bricks that have people's dogs' names on them, and 
the dates on it. You go to our local hospice place, they've got a patio, and they've got 
the names that they have engraved of people. The people may be not from here, but 
they've got, the family knows, "I can go, and that's my special place." It's kind of like 
the Vietnam War wall, with the names. I went, and I remember a classmate through the 
ninth grade, he was a couple years older than I am, and after ninth grade he quit school 
and went and joined the military, and was killed in Vietnam. And I remember, I was 
still in high school when we had his funeral; buried him. I went to Washington, DC, and 
the first thing I wanted to do was find his name on the wall, and just went up, touched 
the name. That's a way of remembering things today. It's just, we've got so many 
choices today that — as I said, what tradition? There's no traditions anymore. You know, 
being in business forecast, I read this — it may have been the KipUnger Washington Letter. 
You know, years ago there were—every town was populated by mom-and-pop stores. 
They gave exceptional service, you know them, you bought from them. Then the big 
box stores came along and people started going to them because the prices were better. 
And you go to Walmart instead of these places, so the mom-and-pop stores closed. 
Now the internet is coming along—Amazon.com, they've even bought out Whole 
Foods —it's going to be where you go on Amazon and pick your stuff, and Whole Foods 
makes sure it gets delivered to your house. So big box stores are getting in trouble 
because of the internet. But it said, that creates another opening for mom-and-pop. You 
go back to small-concept, and you create experiences, and what was I telling you about 
the family store, the little sandwich shop? It's an experience. You don't just go in and 
get a sandwich. You go because it's an experience. Why do people—I can go to the store 
and buy a sixpack of beer for, what, four dollars? Why do I go to a brewpub and order a 
beer, and pay seven dollars and a half for one, when I can go and buy a sixpack for 
four? You're paying for the experience. So little things like that are bringing—it's kind 
of like the circle keeps changing and changing. And that's what I hope to see. The old 
McDougald building, the one by the railroad track, they're tearing out the inside. They 
have a company that's interested in turning it into a brewpub. Have a place on the first 
floor, a balcony on the second floor looking down. And I've been in a place like that on 
Fayetteville Street in Raleigh. So. And you know, you get a good meal, but you go in 
those old buildings that have been torn out and rebuilt, and you're looking at the brick 
wall that's a hundred-and-something years old, or two hundred years old, and you 
keep looking around at all the things they've done on it. It's an experience being there. 
You don't think twice about paying seven dollars and a half for a beer. So. That reminds 
me of a place downtown, 215 on Main, last—it's been about two years ago —but there 
was a man who —this would be an interesting—very nontraditional. A man moved here 
who was originally from Chicago. He was a financial planner, and he and his wife 
moved here into the retirement community, Deercroft. And he passed of cancer. Her 
favorite picture of him was he was wearing a red Hawaiian shirt. But he loved playing 
in a folk band that played in Chicago, and people still got together. And when he got 
sick, the one thing he wanted to do before he died —using internet technology, with his 
friends, he wanted to do an Eagles song together. They did. "Seven Bridges Road"? I 
can't remember the full name of it. Anyway, they did. When they had the memorial 
service, you know, "What church?" "Lenny didn't go to church." "Okay. Okay." She 
said, "Can you find somebody to talk?" I said, "Let me talk to you a little bit to see what 
I can get out of you; I might be able to talk." So finally agreed that I would be the 
officiant. I showed up wearing a red Hawaiian shirt. Actually, I had on a dress shirt 
over it. I got up there and I said, "Now, we're going to tune in to Lenny." So I took off 
my bowtie and took off my white shirt and coat, and said, "Okay." Pulled my shirttail 
out. "Now we're here with Lenny." And I started sharing some stories that she shared 
of his life, and I had a portable mic, and I said, "Now I'm going to walk around—" and 
probably 12 people got up and shared their Lenny stories. And they played that song, 
from him and his friend together, played the music that he had played. And then when 
it was over with they all went to 215 on Main Street, which has got craft beer and wine 
and so forth, and she treated everybody to (?), because Lenny loved playing in 
coffeehouses like this. 
It's not the typical Bible-thumping funeral anymore, but there's still going to be a lot of 
people that want the Bible-thumping funeral. And that's value. As long as it's valuable 
to them. And I've always thought, I said, "Look in the mirror, and everybody looks 
different. When it's time for them to go out, make the ceremony reflect them." 
SB: Something you mentioned that had not occurred to me until you mentioned your 
friend who died in Vietnam is that the funeral home business in your family started 
with the Civil War, and then you entered the business, what, at the tail end of the 
Vietnam War? 
BM: I was at the tail end. I finished college and I worked at the funeral home in the 
summers when I was in college. And then when I finished in '73 I was working fulltime. 
And then it's from September of '74 to August '75,1 was away at mortuary college in 
Atlanta. That was when my mother passed. And stayed in it from '72 to 2016. And if I 
could have done something different, I wish that possibly five years ago I had taken a 
several-month sabbatical. 
SB: Why's that? 
BM: The changes were happening so fast, that I really needed to step back from the 
business and look at it from afar. Go visit some other friends, like Danny Jefferson4 that 
I mentioned, and have discussions with him about what's going on. Taking all these 
thoughts, and just set down and contemplated. You know, like I'm talking to you here. 
How are we going to be able to offer things, to be able to communicate effectively? The 
key thing is communicating. If you have somebody come in, and they are a devout 
conservative Christian that wants a traditional funeral, how can we raise our traditional 
funeral to a higher standard for them? And if you are a free spirit, low-religion, and 
your family, you're still loved by family, how are we going to offer them — ? And if they 
were both in the funeral home on the same time, one of them on one side and one of 
them on the other side, how do you make sure you don't have any—you know! 
(Laughs) I remember, we've had several Buddhist services, and they're always 
cremation, and the circle of life, and things like that. And they like to burn incense. 
Well, at the same time you've got a family on the other side of the funeral home, and 
that incense gets in the air circulation system and comes up over there. There's a 
problem. How do you separate that, without being offensive to each other. There's a lot 
of things, and as I said, I wish I could have had a six-month sabbatical five years before 
I retired, and set back and looked at the changes, and come up with a clearer idea of— 
It's all about communication. 
But I was ready to retire anyway. I would have still stopped when I did. I don't know, 
it's just— The tangent curve that keeps going up higher—you know, from trigonometry 
or geometry, you know, it curves up —that's the way you would almost see the changes 
going in funeral service now. It's just, a shorter time, it's still going up faster. 1997, put 
the crematorium in at the funeral home, we were doing 13 percent cremation; last year I 
was there, we did 56 percent of our services cremations. It's going to still go up. Like 
my grandfather, who died in 1955 at the age of 85, he had his funeral in the house 
because that's the way he is. But when the generation— My Baby Boomers' generation 
is the old generation now, and we're also the generation that were the hippies of the 
1960s, we were the first generation to say, "We're going to do it our way." It's going to 
have a profound effect on funeral traditions. 
SB: Does that generational divide exist among funeral directors and morticians too? 
4 Funeral director in Kernersville, North Carolina, and a friend of Beacham 
McDougald's. 
BM: Oh yeah. 
SB: The Baby Boomers and the people older? 
BM: That's why I really knew that I needed to get out. If I had a professional person 
who was 20 years younger, who had skills, communication skills, and everything, 
where they would have been, I could have said, "You run with this." Because when I 
started, my father used to tell me stories that, when he graduated from mortuary 
college in 1935, he said, "I last embalmed a body in a house" —which was still—"in 
1938." And then after that he started telling me about problems he had trying to make 
changes, because his daddy said, "Well, we don't do that. We would never do that." But 
my daddy proved my granddaddy wrong. In the mid-1970s, I was the one that came 
out, and I said, "I want to do that." "No. We don't do that. People won't buy that." 
Well, I started hearing people talk to me, and they'd say, "Well, I just want a wooden 
casket." "Okay." So I said, "I'm going to buy some wooden caskets." But Daddy said, 
"People won't buy those things!" Well, by the 1980s, over half of our sales, casket sales, 
were wooden caskets. Daddy said, "Well, okay! They do." And when I started noticing 
the cremation, I said, "You know, a funeral parlor up in Southern Pines put in a 
crematorium." "We're not going to do that!" Said, "That'll encourage more people to 
cremate!" "Hmm, not really" I said, "They were having to take them all the way to 
Durham to have them cremated. Now they're having them to — " "No. We're not doing 
it." My daddy died in 1995. We had the settling of the estate by 1997. A year and a half 
after he died we had a crematorium up and going. So our generation is different. And I 
see it today, raising my granddaughter, 12 years old. This is her life, right here. 
[Tapping on phone.] We had (?) out this weekend because I said, "Next week is going to 
be a little bit cooler and less humid. I'm taking you out and putting you on that Zero 
Radius lawnmower, and you're going to learn to mow that—" "I'm not going to mow 
the grass!" I said, "Listen here, young lady. I was pushing a lawnmower when I was 
eight years old. You're no better than I am. You're going to learn some of these things." 
And I'm worried about the new generation, because they're not able to — Lordy! I said, 
"Gosh, if I was 12 years old and had a lawnmower I could ride on. I'd thought I'd died 
and gone to heaven." But you know, a story I've told people, we're having a big class 
reunion this year in November. Scotland High School out here will be 50 years old this 
fall. We're having the first three classes — sophomore, junior, and senior classes — I was 
the junior class. I said, "We're going to have us a reunion," so we put it together. We 
call ourselves the Scotland High School First-Footers, because we were the first ones to 
set foot in the high school. Fiftieth-anniversary reunion. And I've met with several 
classmates who are organizing the thing. One of them said, "You know, our children 
won't ever appreciate us, but if the internet informational grid that covers the world all 
of a sudden collapsed, we're the last generation that could do anything manually." I 
said, "That's frightening." I mean, that is. It is frightening. I think technology needs to 
be icing on the cake, but it doesn't need to be the cake. 
That's about all my mind held at one time. I've probably told you more than I know.
