Introduction. Pam O’Laughlin, elementary art teacher, interviewed at Oakwood 
Elementary School, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on January 23, 2014, interviewed by Mary Hoefferle. 
She has read and signed the release form. 
00:00:22 
Inspiration for choosing art education: Always wanted to help other people. 
Originally began college as a math education major. Good at math but doesn’t necessarily 
enjoy it. She always enjoyed art, so changed her major. 
00:01:28 
College preparation: Received a BFA in art education from UW Oshkosh. Took 
lots of ceramics classes. 
00:02:00 
Years of teaching: Nine years at all levels (minimal at middle school). Taught at 
13 different locations, mostly elementary, but also at high schools, including an alternative 
school.  
00:03:30 
Professional development: First group of teachers under PI 34 – change in state 
professional development requirements. No longer required to take college classes. oncerned 
that earning a master’s degree would hurt her chances of future employment. Took courses 
through the district: bullying prevention, working with autistic children, love and logic class 
management. 
00:04:53 
Typical day/week on the job: Arrive at 7:30, prepares supplies for 25 minutes. 
Shares the room with another teacher. Teaches 8:00 – 8:50, then 8:50 to 9:40, then walk out 
the door, drive to another school 10 minutes away, set up for class at that school and start 
teaching at 10:00 to 10:50. Lunch at 11:00, eats lunch with friends in the lunchroom and two 
days a week, does errands. Three afternoon classes, which end at 2:30. Bus duty at the end of 
the day. 
00:09:13 
Adult interactions during the day: Lunchtime only. Basement classroom which 
physically separates her from other teachers. Most conversations are about student 
behaviors. No collaboration time for discussing curriculum. Staff meetings are focused on 
school goals. 
00:11:55 
Working after school: Brings family to her classroom after school, kids play, she 
and art teacher husband work. Grading, cleaning brushes, loading kiln. Assessment is huge 
time commitment for 700 kids. Report cards three times a year, but she grades every other

week. She did 7,000 individual assessments last year. Created curriculum master plan with 
benchmarks, projects, vocabulary, skills for each grade level. 
00:17:40 
Relationship with principal and custodian: Not much interaction. Principal is 
gone from building often. Good relationship. She has never been observed/evaluated by an 
administrator in nine years of employment. No fear about being evaluated, though. Knows 
and sees the custodian almost every day, knows about his family. Friends with teachers who 
are her age and have children like her. 
00:22:24 
School traditions: two concerts (Christmas and Spring). Environmental 
Education Day (Oakwood is an Environmental Charter School). Huge carnival at the end of the 
year. Lots of parent involvement make these events happen. Science fair, Hawaiian Luau, 
Nature Fun Run. 
00:25:18 
Fundraising: Art to Remember (artwork transferred to other items). PTO 
handles paperwork portion. At first, the fundraiser money would go to classroom teachers, 
but her budget got cut, lowest in the district – only $2.84 per child for the year. Used to be a 
$1.84! Now, the PTO reimburses her for about $500 for supplies each year from the 
fundraiser. Tries to find donations and recyclable materials, swap materials with art teacher 
husband – trade extras. Art teacher exchanges at meetings. Can’t afford glazes, clay projects 
much smaller, searches out sales.  
00:30:45 
What she likes about her job: When a child who hasn’t been very successful in 
art finally creates something he/she is really proud of. She loves the look on their faces. She’ll 
hold it up and celebrate it with the whole class – and it’s clear how wonderful the child feels. 
She loves introducing kids to new ways to make art. Introduce them to materials they don’t 
have at home.  
00:33:05 
Challenges of the job: Time and money. Needs more time to prepare the 
materials during the day – few minutes between classes. Student behaviors are a big struggle. 
Kids used to be segregated into special needs, now integrated without support. Only provide 
support for kids who are a safety risk, but many other children need constant help to stay on 
task.  
00:35:59 
Changes in student behavior over nine years: Much more children with special 
needs/diverse learning needs and the intensity of problems has increased. Extreme anger 
issues. Increase in autism. Environmental pollutants/chemicals influencing/altering children’s 
behavior. She tells a few stories about students. 
00:43: 27 
Misconceptions about art teachers: Most people don’t realize what art teachers 
actually do. Parents email “art” project ideas that are crafty and not substantial. 
00:45:11 
Politics of the job: Not fun! She can’t handle lots of stress. Just having the job is 
stressful, lots of extra hours, and not much money. Making less money now than a first year

teacher! More expenses now. Politics on top of it, she just avoids it if possible. Worries about 
art program being cut. 
00:48:09 
Advice for new art teachers: You won’t be doing the same thing from one year 
to the next. Hours cut, moved from school to school, classroom to classroom, different grade 
levels. Constant evolution. Put in extra time the first few years!
