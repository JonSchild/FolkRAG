its 
current status as a basic training and advanced training center. 
Relationship with local community, especially because of Col. 
MacNab, the public affairs officer. Public is welcome to tour the 
base. Different kinds of community activities. Send units to 
parades: band, color guard, firing squad.

TXO1: (0-91) G—Ft. Dix; 19GT Impact area, near rifle ranges. 
We're 
near route 70, will catch a glimpse of 
it once in a while. Pines 
and maples are beautiful, Fasick comments. Bivouac area. Tent 
raising. Field kitchen. Range is 
in operation when red f►ag is 
out. Camoflage buildings. Some civilian homes on Hanover Blvd. 
Homes are more recent than the base. One has carved deer with 
Christmas lights.

area. Fasick used to be a reporter for the post newspaper, The 
Post. Occupations of people living near base. Area between

across. Room for expansion. 11,000 people on base, used to be 
50,000. Lots of action during Vietnam and Korean eras. 
(167— 220) Fire and manuver course. Need lots of territory 
so people don't run 
into each other. Awards for marksmanship. 
Safety is paramount, then training. If 
it (a tour) interferes 
with training, back off. 
(220-330) Large civilian workforce. Fasick lives 
in 
Burlington Township. Reserve units on weekends. 
No tours, 
reservists too nervous. Wonder- 
if soldiers get distracted by 
beauty of the surroundings. Praise for Col. MacNab. He used to 
teach history at West Point. 
(330-425) Arctic Corner. Loan of tents. Police departments

bought ground around the house 
Wife's family was 
in produce business. Her father and 
brothers were farmers. Had little produce markets where his wife 
worked when she was 5 years old. Main stand was up on the pike 
(White Horse Pike) after they moved from Pine Rd. (see PFP83— 
FSS0919). Whole family went into same business like he has today. 
The business looked interesting to him, he 
liked to meet the 
public. Worked 
in a grocery store on weekends when he was 
in high 
school. (5 minutes) Managed the American Store (now the Acme)(?in 
Woodbury or Egg Harbor?). Worked in shipyard for a while, then 
got drafted. Liked idea of going into business for himself. 
Served in Korea, vanguard before the Korean War. 
Built new stand 
in 
1972, sons' 
idea, they wanted to 
modernize. Buy local produce. Differences between farmers of 
different backgrounds. Italians--peaches; Germans--potatoes, 
onions. Depends on where you are. Vineland, all vegetables, 
dandelion, 
lettuce, tomatoes. Germans--potatoes, peppers,

broccoli, cabbage. Italians raise fruit and Germans grow 
vegetables. agriculture, (plant) 
Mushroom hunting and gathering. Friends pick them but they 
aren't sold. Wild mushrooms give weird feeling in throat. Wild 
mushrooms are a local favorite, especially in the fall 
if there 
has been a good rain. Pickle them. "Nothing like 'em." Be 
careful; would throw in a quarter or some garlic while the 
mushrooms were cooking and 
if 
the quarter or garlic turned black 
the mushrooms were no good. 
Snapping turtles caught and eaten at Lake Makepeace and 
along Mullica River. One of his nephews, Ralph Ficcatolla (sp? 
pronounced fish—a—tola) likes to catch turtles; he 
is a 
freeholder in Atlantic County. Things found in woods, 
like 
teaberries, wild huckleberries. Sal 
goes back in the woods a 
lot, want to show us stuff one day. 
Ralph shows picture of original house. Sal says, "Oh, that's 
when we were rich." (laughter) Baby pictures. Getting well—to—do, 
bit by bit. (10 minutes) 
Amatol, World War I gunpowder factory. 25,000 people. 
Speedway Park, board racetrack. New state troopers barracks. Can 
see ruins and foundations. Ironworks in Weymouth. Made pipe for 
Philadelphia. Old cemeteries. 
Elaine asks, "What do you like about this area?" Sal 
says 
it's not densely populated, "clean living," the woods, everybody 
knows each other. Slowly closing in. 
He's also a licensed insurance broker. Everybody does a 
little bit of everything. Served on township committee too and 
was mayor of Mullica Township three or four times. Gives us 
business cards. Shows us his mayor's badges. Ralph shows us 
second grade pictures. 
Sal 
enjoyed being mayor and serving the public. Always tried 
to do what he thought was right for the public. (15 minutes) 
Ralph kids him, "You got rich." Sal 
reviews pay scale for mayor, 
increases over the years. Different kinds of meetings. Planning 
for the area, Pinelands controversy. 11 acres for a house, or 3 
or 5. Control 
is okay but not a lot. Home rule is disappearing. 
Voter registration is 8500, 54 square miles. Large 
in 
land but 
poor because there isn't much industry. Heavy burden for schools. 
"But all 
in all 
it's a nice place to live in." 
I comment on the homemade grape wine and the dregs 
in the 
bottom. The sediment means it's good old—fashioned wine. Kidding 
about stomping on the grapes in the bathtub. Description of wine 
making. California grapes need very little sugar added. Make 
about 100 gallons a year; that's what's allowed by 
law. Joking 
reference to bootlegging and tape recorder turned off.

Stories about Jimmy the Brute, a local 
bully. He deserved 
his reputation. He was a first cousin of Sal's wife. 
(20 minutes) Reviewing more family pictures. 
Invite ourselves back for a walk 
in the woods. He can show 
us some lost cemeteries in the woods behind his house. Refers to 
the rabbi 
of the "colored Jewish community" 
in Elwood. Offers to 
take us over to the rabbi 
to meet him. 
Talk about setting up an 
interview between Sal and Uncle 
Charlie, would really produce results. Ralph suggest other family 
members who would know a lot, such as Aunt Julie. This gets Sal 
talking about the old family house on Pine Rd. Sometimes they 
went hungry, they all slept together. Father-in-law couldn't get 
3 cents for a pint of raspberries; today the wholesale price 
is a 
$1.25. The stand sells them for $1.99. 
Ralph says, "If you had 5 
acres of raspberries you could retire. Raspberries were a family 
affair. Large families, worked together picking by hand. Family 
farmer has now disappeared. Family used to do all 
the work. 
Some relatives still have farms; the Putiris buy from them. 
Family is 
involved in th farming business but it's gotten bigger. 
Talks about the DeMarco family. Various uncles still active 
in 
farming. Lots of family-oriented businesses. Columbia II diner, 
Joe's Maplewood restaurant, all 
run by the family. (25 minutes) 
Families all 
get together on July 16th, the big community 
celebration. Sal thinks it's a wonderful religious thing (in 
contrast to Ralph who told us earlier that he thought it was 
sa.creligious because of the practice of hanging money on the 
statues). See the people who have the faith. Old-timers went to 
mass every morning. Used to always visit the in-laws, but not like 
it once was.

TEXT: 
(continued from RSS005) Tape begins at tale end of a joke. 
Sal's mother-in-law would take care of people off the street. She 
had 
faith in people. 
Would give them 
money. 
"That's they wa.y 
they used to be, those old-timers." 
Discuss 
rifle 
in corner. 
Story about a fight with a customer. 
Customer trying to get good apples for the price of cheaper ones. 
At end, 
Sal says, 
"Pow. 
I hit him. 
Right over the 
potatoes." 
(Good 
overlap 
of Sal and Ralph.) Sal shoots the gun off in 
the 
air. 
Sounded like a cannon under the stand. 
(Great story, 
war-
rants full transcription.) 
Ethel story (she was former housekeepr). 
Sweeping the stand, man 
gets 
fresh with Ralph's mother, 
Ethel picks up an 
empty 
fruit 
basket 
and 
"just crowned him over the head with it." He 
turned 
around 
as said "What you do mama?" and she says, 
"I ain't 
your 
mama? Don't you get smart with my boss lady, you black so-and-so. 
Now get your nigger ass out of here ," 
she hollered at him. 
1 
She 
helped raised the boys.. 
Ralph tries to find  picture  of her. 
She 
came up every spring with her husband who worked for one 
of 
the farmers. She helped take care of the kids. worked for them 25 
years. Boys were pallbearers at her funera.l. (5 minutes) 
More picture sorting and comments. 
Big birthday parties. Another 
employee, 
Maria, from Argentina, took care of grandmother. Shows 
picture of Ethel. 
Cemetery 
blankets. 
Do more of them than in past. 
Used to 
open 
stand in April at start of asparagus season, 
possibly go through 
Thanksgiving, otherwise close at end of October. Today, "with all 
the new-(angled things," they open with the flower show in Phila-
delphia 
(They 
have a stand there.) (Ralph interjects that 
they 
need 
to 
stay 
open longer because of the tax 
burden.) 
In 
the 
meantime 
(offtime) 
they 
make all 
the 
cemetery 
pieces. 
Pine 
blanket--made from pine. 
Some people want them custom made 
with 
ribbons 
and 
decorations. 
One 
for a kid named 
Paul 
is 
quite 
elaborate 
with streamers with his name and little Santa 
Clauses 
and 
presents. 
Covers full grave. 
Most 5-7 feet long by S feet 
wide. 
Decorated with a ribbon. Trimmings--plastic poinsettias, 
flowers, 
cones. 
Common thing around here. Don't know if 
it's. an 
Italian 
or 
a. Catholic custom. 
Friends from Toronto don't 
know 
about it. Cemetery log--pine with poinsettias and flowers and the 
wreaths 
of course. 
Used to do retail wreaths but people 
wanted 
more than they wanted to make. (10 minutes) Picking up new custo-
mers because other makers are going out of business. 
May make up 
to 700 blankets. 
Decorate graves on Easter and Memorial Day too but not 
blankets. 
Only 
at 
Christmas 
"It's 
like to keep the loved 
one 
warm 
or 
something." Doesn't know where the started from. Family uses them 
on graves. Just came in, something to keep busy with in December. 
"It's 
always 
been in this area." Used to wrap 
laurel 
to 
hang 
around doorways and stuff. Don't do anymore because it's too much 
work to go in the woods and cut laurel. Can still get pine roping 
and laurel roping. 
Whole family is involved in making the blan-
kets, 
both men and women. 
Mom used to make ribbons. Ralph says, 
"I used to get the greens. I was a good cutter. I could look at a 
branch and I could know exactly what it could be used for like an 
end or a tip or a filler, 
whatever. 
I would trim them up, and I 
would grade them out." 
Get a piece of pine board and chicken wire, nail 
it to the board, 
fill 
it with moss (from the woods). 
"That's a job, going to get 
the 
moss 
in 
the woods." "When you got to go the 
moss 
in 
the 
:woods, 
that's 
nice." Rake it up. 
Put it under the chicken wire 
and stick the branches into the moss. A lot of poople use plastic 
foam but it keeps fresher in the moss. "It comes out beautiful 
in 
the blanket, 
believe me. 
They come out pretty." Start making in 
the middle of November. 
Ralph thinks there may be cemetery blan-
kets 
in 
Florida because people from the area 
have 
moved 
down 
there. 
"Little 
by 
little, 
I guess maybe it would 
spread 
out 
eventually." 
Ralph 
says, 
"Culture's been borrowed right 
along 
2 
with history." 
Sal 
says he loves to talk about the area, 
to tell 
people 
what 
Mullica 
Township is like. 
Elaine asks about who lives where 
in 
the township. 
Black Jewish community. Wharton Park, Spanish sec-
tion. Blacks in Elwood, south of the railroad tracks. Rich people 
live 
along the river. 
(15 minutes) Spanish community is 
mostly 
Puerto 
Rican. 
Sal 
knows 
some 
of 
them 
through 
politicking. 
Haitian=_. 
live 
their too. 
Game in little by little 
as 
migrant 
workers. 
Local 
help 
started 
to get bad, 
farmers 
brought 
in 
migrant help and little by little they started to settle. Quite a 
few Spanish people in the area now. 
Odessa 
Tennent (or Tennant) good contact for 
blacks. 
Rabbi 
in 
Black 
community. 
Tried to go to Israel but couldn't 
go. 
Moved 
here as group, 
seemed like overnight. Don't know where they came 
from. Wonderful people. 
Rumors 
of a. Disney World on Lake Makepeace. 
Ralph and Sal dis-
cuss 
a phone call. 
Review more 
family 
pictures. 
Honeymoon--
borrowed car, went to Niagra Falls with x•50 
in pocket. 
Don't 
like the casinos. 
Good for the casinos but not the 
local 
people' they've been hurt. Hurt local businesses. 
Birth 
of twin boy=.. 
(20 minutes)

TX01: (Continued from PFP83—RSS005.) Tape begins at tale end of a 
joke. Sal's mother—in—law would take care of people off the 
street. She had faith in people. Would give them money. "That's 
they way they used to be, those old—timers." 
Discuss rifle 
in corner. Story about a fight with a 
customer. Customer trying to get good apples for the price of 
cheaper ones. At end, Sal 
says, "Pow. I hit him. Right over the 
potatoes." (Good overlap of Sal and Ralph.) Sal 
shoots the gun 
off 
in the air. Sounded like a cannon under the stand. (Great 
story, warrants full transcription.) 
Ethel story (she was former housekeeper). Sweeping the 
stand, man gets fresh with Ralph's mother, Ethel picks up an 
empty fruit basket and "just crowned him over the head with it." 
He turned around as said "What you do mama?" and she says, "I 
ain't your mama? Don't you get smart with my boss lady, you black 
so—and—so. Now get your nigger ass out of here ," she hollered at 
him. 
She helped raised the boys. Ralph tries to find picture of 
her. She came up every spring with her husband who worked for one 
of the farmers. She helped take care of the kids. worked for them 
25 years. Boys were pallbearers at her funeral. (5 minutes) 
More picture sorting and comments. Big birthday parties. 
Another employee, Maria, from Argentina, took care of

grandmother. Shows picture of Ethel. 
Cemetery blankets. Do more of them than 
in past. Used to 
open stand 
in April at start of asparagus s.eason, possibly go 
through Thanksgiving, otherwise close at end of October. Today, 
"with all 
the new-fangled things," they open with the flower show 
in Philadelphia (They have a stand there.) (Ralph interjects that 
they need to stay open longer because of the tax burden.) In the 
meantime (offtime) they make all 
the cemetery pieces. Pine 
blanket--made from pine. Some people want them custom made with 
ribbons and decorations. One for a kid named Paul 
is quite 
elaborate with streamers with his name and little Santa Clauses 
and presents. Covers full grave. Most 5-7 feet long by 3 feet 
wide. 
Decorated with a ribbon. Trimmings--plastic poinsettias, 
flowers, cones. Common thing around here. Don't know if 
it's an 
Italian or a Catholic custom. Friends from Toronto don't know 
about it. Cemetery log--pine with poinsettias and flowers and the 
wreaths of course. Used to do retail wreaths but people wanted 
more than they wanted to make. (10 minutes) Picking up new 
customers because other makers are going out of business. May 
make up to 700 blankets. 
Decorate graves on Easter and Memorial Day too but not 
blankets. Only at Christmas "It's like to keep the loved one warm 
or something." Doesn't know where the started from. Family uses 
them on graves. Just came in, 
something to keep busy with 
in 
December. "It's always been 
in this area." Used to wrap laurel 
to 
hang around doorways and stuff. Don't do anymore because it's too 
much work to go 
in the woods and cut laurel. Can still get pine 
roping and laurel 
roping. 
Whole family is 
involved in making the 
blankets, both men and women. Mom used to make ribbons. Ralph 
says, 
"I used to get the greens. I was a good cutter. I could 
look at a branch and I could know exactly what it could be used 
for like an end or a tip or a filler, whatever. I would trim them 
up, 
and I would grade them out." 
Get a piece of pine board and chicken wire, nail 
it to the 
board, fill 
it with moss (from the woods). 
"That's a job, going 
to get the moss in the woods." "When you got to go the moss 
in 
the woods, that's nice." Rake 
it up. Put it under the chicken 
wire and stick the branches into the moss. A lot of people use 
plastic foam but it keeps fresher in the moss. "It comes out 
beautiful 
in the blanket, believe me. They come out pretty." 
Start making in the middle of November. Ralph thinks there may be 
cemetery blankets in Florida because people from the area have 
moved down there. "Little by 
little, I guess maybe it would 
spread out eventually." Ralph says, "Culture's been borrowed 
right along with history." 
Sal 
says he loves to talk about the area, to tell people 
what Mullica Township is 
like. Elaine asks about who lives where 
in the township. Black Jewish community. Wharton Park, Spanish 
section. Blacks in Elwood, south of the railroad tracks. Rich

people live along the river. (15 minutes) Spanish community is 
mostly Puerto Rican. Sal knows some of them through politicking. 
Haitians live their too. Came 
in 
little by 
little as migrant 
workers. Local help started to get bad, farmers brought in 
migrant help and little by little they started to settle. Quite a 
few Spanish people in the area now. 
Odessa Tennent (or Tennant) good contact for blacks. Rabbi 
in Black community. Tried to go to Israel but couldn't go. Moved 
here as group, seemed like overnight. Don't know where they came 
from. Wonderful people. 
Rumors of a Disney World on Lake Makepeace. 
Ralph and Sal 
discuss a phone call. Review more family pictures. Honeymoon--
borrowed car, went to Niagra Falls with $50 in pocket. 
Don't like the casinos. Good for the casinos but not the 
local people' they've been hurt. Hurt local businesses. 
Birth of twin boys. (20 minutes) 
Story about how Sal 
and 
Emma couldn't have children, then he ate gavededellis ("Italian 
potato and macaroni thing of some sort"), got appendicitis and

2MIK: 
TX01: (0-28) G-Ft. Dix; 19GT MacNab talks about public's perception 
of army as band of friendly aliens, as a spaceship that has 
landed at the edge of the Pines. Don't bother anybody that much, 
sometimes nice to have them 
around, and they 
do spend money. 
They come and go and don't have anything to do with rest of the 
area. Some people in area aren't exactly sure where Ft. Dix 
is. 
Think they don't have an 
interest in the community. 
(29- 75) People think they know about the army, had 
relatives in the army 
"who know all about it." Presumes the army 
hasn't changed since 1940s, 1950s or 1960s. MacNab did basic 
training here exactly 20 years ago. Army has changed so much, 
in 
real fundamental 
ways as society has changed. Has some stable 
elements too. One main change, 
less moving around. Did so at 
height of Vietnam conflict but now standard tour of duty is 
at 
least 2 years. People in stable areas wary of making friends 
if 
they think you're going to move right away. 
Lots of stability in 
this area on the part of civilians. 3-4 years for a tour is not 
unheard of. Some NCOs have been here 6 years. May go somewhere 
else and come back. 
(75-97) Community doesn't realize extent of employees and 
servicemen who live offpost. Don't wear uniforms much outside of 
work. Involved in 
lots of community groups. Wife teaches school 
in Burlington. Majority of army wives (and husband if wife is 
in 
army) work outside of post. Wives tend to be nurses and teachers, 
have careers they can move. 
Samuelson--83 Reel-to-reel logs 
page 14 
(97-147) His knowledge of 
local history. Done in part on 
purpose to make the point that he 
is part of the community. 
Military homes do reveal artifacts relating to their moves but 
basically the homes don't look 
like the homes of people who move 
a lot. Look like households of people who intend to live there 
for a while. Make extra effort to put down roots. Need to have 
the feeling of connection to civilian communities. Often 
civilians don't realize that as an asset. Of course, not all 
military people are as committed to community. He encourages 
people to explore the region. He describes the various 
recreational activities he and his family engage in. How he 
promotes the area to potential employees. "Kind of makes me sound 
like a travel agent or a public relations man, which I am. This 
is a terrific place." Prejudice in army subculture against the 
Northeast. Many army people are from South or Midwest and were 
brought up to believe the Northeast is not that great a place. 
(148-172) I ask what he knows about the Pinelands. Talks 
about ironworks, Hanover Furnace. Egg Harbor and Mullica as 
seaport in Revolutionary era. Last engagement of American 
Revolution in Cedar Bridge. Pines as cultural enclave. 
(173-192) This 
is office that gets complaints about 
artillery noise on weekends when reserve units train. Met with 
Plumsted Township committee in June. Made friends with some of the 
citizens. Dave Emory, longtime resident. 
Doesn't know if they 
would consider themselves Pineys but thinks they are "marginal 
Pineys" because they've been there for a long time. Meets with 
other township committees on noise question. Thinks people should 
know what the army 
is doing. 
(132-204) Has flown over the pines by helicopter. Sees 
isolated buildings, wonders why they are there. Flat. Doesn't 
look 
like solid mass of vegetation, can see the ground. 
(205-250) Concern about preservation plan. Presents 
practical difficulties, but great concept. Environmental 
protection. Have to use environment for all 
kinds of things. Ft. 
Dix 
is a community in the protection area. Lawyers have worked 
with Pinelands Commission. Hard to carry on something as dynamic 
as Ft. Dix within the constraints. Share environmental concerns. 
Landfill. Sewage treatment plant. Solid waste disposal. Heating 
plants. Incinerator. 
Army is a bureaucracy but suffers because 
of other bureaucracies like everyone else does. Ft. Dix 
is a 
town. Doesn't have old, old people. 
(251-288) Military retirees. Attracted to areas where they 
can use their military benefits. Where they settle depends on 
people's tastes but this 
is 
an attractive one. MacNab reviews 
areas where he's been stationed and might retire to. 
13,000 army 
retirees, plus air force and navy. They're invisible, don't wear 
uniforms, people don't realize the extent to which they affect 
Samuelson--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 15 
the community. 
(289-270) Korean community in Browns Mills. Bob Warner, wife 
is Korean, very much a part of the Korean community. Had a Korean 
wedding reception. Korean community in 
Burlington/Delran/Riverside area. Capt. Van Jenrette, married to 
a Korean woman. 
He got upset about a newspaper piece on 
Amerasian orphans, made it sound like all Korean women were 
prostitutes and mixed-parentage children were orphans. Also many 
German wives because of army people being stationed overseas. Air 
force--Philippines and Thailand. Significant subculture of German 
wives but because of the racial angle they're invisible. Army is 
a cosmopolitan society. Hermione Gilson, 
in army community 
services, 
is German. She translates for MacNab. His chief of 
staff's wife is too. Staff judge advocate is of Japanese 
background. Army gets people from all parts of society.

TX01: (1-27) G-Ft. Dix; 19GT Plumsted township folks' frame of 
reference is different from the army's. 4-5 years is ancient 
history for the cords on buildings. No systematic filing system, 
would be buried 
in paper. Something that happened five years ago 
seems to people in Plumsted like just last week. No record of 
stray shells from artillery but they knew of a barn knocked down 
20 years ago by a shell. They could show MacNab the barn if he 
wanted to see 
it. 
(28-40) Oriental subculture in New Jersey contributed to by 
the military presence, but not totally. Does installation cause 
build-up of Koreans which attracts other Koreans who have nothing 
to do with the military, or vice versa? Back to German wives. 
Historically, an army will bring home wives from where it happens 
to be. 
(41-74) Mechanisms by which base shares natural/scenic 
resources with community. Priorities--active duty people first, 
retirees, civilians. Civilians can hunt and fish. Rarely reach

viewed as resource center in other ways, want to use buildings, 
hold meetings "look at us as a cheap convention center." Schools 
use athletic fields to hold 
track meets. Police forces and fire 
departments.

he 
is remembering 1950s army of unmarried draftees interested in 
raising hell, when Wrightstown was a pretty gamey area. Still 
some part of that left but has fallen on hard times. Army today 
is different. Image of rape and pillage, 
lock up your daughters. 
Source of crime and drugs. Some drug problem but soldiers aren't 
the sellers. Rarely does a soldier perpetrate a crime. 
(108-139) Engineers allow cutting of firewood a couple of 
times a year. Sign-up procedure. Mainly civilians because on-post 
housing doesn't have fireplaces. Provisions for sharing resources 
with civilian world to the extent it 
is practical. 
(140-200) Army tries hard to be good neighbor. Doesn't loan 
as much as used to because it would compete with commercial 
world. Operate a lean company. Budget problems. Transportation 
resources. Recruitment issues. 86% high school graduates. Size of 
army. Change 
in strength, difficult to 
live with. Opportunities 
offered to minority groups.

TXO1: Earl points out his land along G-Magnolia Road; 21GT. 
Thinking of putting in some Christmas trees. The Bushes (a 
local 
family) raise turkeys, blueberries and Christmas trees. Points 
out son's house and we drive up to 
it. 
It's near Magnolia Road 
Fire Company. Pond nearby. Old outhouse. Pond, water level 
is 
down. Many, many acres of cranberry bogs 
in this area that have 
been abandoned. 
Pull 
up at Bush's blueberry shed, building a new freezer and 
storage space. Retail store and packing house. 
Discuss sorting 
and freezing procedure. (5 minutes) Blueberries start to ripen 
about June 13th, never in any hurry to start. Roughly June 20 to 
August 20. 
Introduces me to Wilbur Bush, one of the famous Bush sons. 
Family name used to be Bashan. Little family history, his great-
grandfather came to the area. Wilbur explains how the blueberries 
are packed, stems removed. Bakers like small berries, can 
sometimes get a premium price for them. This year's crop was 
about 60-65% off because of a late frost. Water level problem 
here, have to go deep. Start picking later if 
by machine. Use 
machine rather than migrant workers because labor situation got 
too complicated. 1946, kids from Burlington used to come work for 
Piper. Bush gets a few local girls to help. (10 minutes) Think 
minimum wage 
is part of the problem. Used to have black ladies 
Samuelson--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 13 
who came out and picked. They wouldn't pick enough to meet 
minimum wage requirements so they were out of a job. Bush used to 
hire 150 pickers a day. Corn--poor crop, premium prices. 
Can't get rich being a farmer. Gamble. Good years, put some 
away. Cash goes to next year's crop. Pruning, spraying. Work 
hardly ever eases off. May take a few weeks to go hunting. Moss 
pickers down 
in Chatsworth. Trespassers. Japanese come 
in spring 
and pick ferns (especially in burned over area), for salad. Earl 
knows a Japanese electronics technician who works at Ft. Dix. 
Piper took him around looking for ferns. The guy names his first 
few kids with Japanese names ("Bazooka"), but then named one 
George and then another Irene. 
Wilbur thinks he has a nice life. "Wouldn't have 
it any 
other way." (15 minutes) Earl talks about retiring from his code 
inspector job. He'd rather be out 
in the field or go fishing. 
Wonders what will happen to the next guy that takes his job (code 
inspector) and 
if 
he doesn't know the town, he's 
in trouble. 
"There's not much I don't know .... I know every foot of the 
township." His brother—in—law, Harold Lynch, head of public 
works, knows every inch of the township. Knows previous owners 
of the land or something about the property. He had to take tax 
assessor out last year. No fences, no 
lines, "but we know who 
owns this piece and who owns this piece that adjoins it. But you 
look at 
it, you say, 
'it looks like all 
one property to me.' But 
we know." 
Earl talks about Sheep Pen Hill disease for the cranberries. 
Wilbur raises blueberries and turkeys and Christmas trees, "and 
fights 
fires." 
Get back 
in car. Earl talks about how schoolkids used to 
pick berries 
to buy school clothes. Boys picked and girls 
packed. 
Pass Moose Hall. Earl describes turkey shoot. 
Drive pass Earl's house. Moved his house from an area near 
the Echelon Mall 
in Camden County. Added a story and extra rooms. 
(20 minutes) Father—in—law has a road stand. 
Drove through Bush's turkey sheds. Force—fed. Turkey 
business is good. Points out Bush family houses. Talks about 
local guys who fly ultra—light airplanes. Discusses his family's 
relation to the Bushes. 
Points out more family houses. Methodist 
Church where most of them go. Magnolia/New Lisbon Rd. 
One of 
wife's brothers raises blueberries, azaleas and drives a school 
bus 
and 
is a custodian, "A workaholic," Another brother is a 
public works supervisor. 12 houses within a half mile that 
members of his family live in, plus he owns four others. See each 
other all 
the time. (25 minutes) 
(Tape stops while we walk 
around his brother in—law's house where he grows azaleas.) The

Abandoned blueberry fields. Moose hall 
turkey shoot. Ernie Bowker, buying up blueberry fields, raises, 
picks and buys blueberries. His labor problems. 
Most of the real 
old—timers are gone. Ernie is cleaning up old bogs to prepare 
them for future wet picking. Bogs divided up 
into smaller lots. 
Bowker's cannery set on fire. Look at cuttings for cranberries. 
Dairy farming in area. A man named Emonds has a big farm and 
small dairy store. Volume is key for almost everything. Small 
retail sales can't support much so 
individual mills and the like 
went out of business. Lakewood--used to have big chicken farms in 
the 1930s. Jews or Poles came down from New York to run them. 
Mostly deserted now. ethnicity 
Southampton Township--blueberries, cranberries, a butcher. 
Jake Greenberg is a cattle dealer outside of Pemberton. "They 
always made money." Their house was robbed of $250,000. "There's 
thieves everywhere." A lot has to do with drug business, just 
like 
in 
the city. Hasn't heard of marijuana being grown 
in the 
area, thinks there may be some that grows wild. (5 minutes) crime 
Hunting. Different seasons: small game, deer. Deer chewing 
tender buds from berries. Plenty of wild bushes now so don't 
bother berries as much. (animal), (plant)

Ernie Bowker comes out from his office. Tape 
is turned off. 
Earl talks about woodcutting. Still some sawmills in 
operation--such as Lyman Taylor's in Buddtown, does fence and 
post work. We drive down Buddtown Rd. Points out cranberry bogs, 
old Scammell property. County owns development rights to 
it so 
it 
has to stay in agriculture. Tells story about violation notice. 
Mentions problems about trash 
in woods. Deer come out at night 
near bogs to drink and feed. 
Ice skating on bogs. Points out harvested fields. New, more 
efficient dry scoop machine. Deer hunting story about scaring off 
deer. (10 minutes) Earl has a real estate license, points out a 
house he had sold. Will continue to sell after he retires from 
his township job. Talks about his son. 
Old dairy farms have gone to soybeans. Pettet is 
local dairy 
farmer. "This is Buddtown. We always say, we always make a joke, 
well, how about the world coming an end, or something, Oh, we"II 
go to Buddtown." Pulls into sawmill yard. Cut local wood, mostly 
Jersey cedar. Mostly make fence. 
In Tabernacle or Indian Mills, 
the Wells family has a small sawmill. At Egg Harbor, there's 
another one. 
In Chatsworth, old Pineys collect moss. Don't want a steady 
job. Get food stamps, go cut birch whips. Get pinecones, moss, 
birch whips, wild grapevines. Cut them, roll them up. John 
Richardson in Mt. Holly acts as broker for them. (15 minutes) 
Place in Whiting where they take pine cones. Cook them and that 
makes them open up. Little bird like a wren, a pine sisken, eats 
the seeds. 
Used to be a fellow named Asa Pitman at Mt. Misery. Kept 
rattlesnakes. A fellow there now who kept a snake 
in his 
basement. Earl has seen it. Tells story about time 
it got out of 
its aquarium. 
Pick your own strawberries farm on Stockton Bridge Rd. Other 
strawberry farms near Tabernacle. 
Little settlement of houses on 
the road. Earl points out land he used to own. "The blueberries 
are just too far away and too much for me to handle." Points out 
Puerto Rican family's house. (20 minutes) 
Points out and discusses Bowker's "plant" (cannery) and how 
it burned down. Used to put blueberries in cans. Lots of junk 
still around, needs to be cleaned up. Fire was in January, 1982. 
Used to process raspberries, strawberries, apples for applesauce. 
Points out sites of former dairy farms. Talks about winter 
of 1946-47. He had a four—wheel drive weapons carrier and would 
try to keep the roads open so the milk could be brought out. 
Township didn't have any big equipment at that time.

2MIK: 
TX01: G-Devonshire; 12GT Discussion of Helen's wreath making. I ask 
how she got started with 
it. 
"I really just think living in 
the 
area and 
in 
in the woods, you know. It's been part of our lives 
and 
it grows on you. As time goes on you see 
it, 
you know." Never 
made them for money, just for church festivals or as gifts. Just 
for fun. Describes some of them, how they're made. Ideas from 
Berlin auction. 
Encourages us to go to 
it, 
"part of what goes on 
in south Jersey." She had seen wreaths at other places. Use of 
linoleum paste, for indoor and outdoor wreaths. 
Describes 
another one--grapevine with sea statice. She 
is going to sell 
this one. Yarrow, dried cockscomb, straw flowers, German statice. 
Use of wreaths, where they hang. Not going to make a business out 
of 
it. Pinecone wreath as Christmas wreath, some can hang all 
year. Get ribbon and silk flowers at "junky places" (5 minutes) 
where she doesn't have to spend a lot of money on them. Just 
started using straw flowers last year. Takes 5 minutes to wrap a 
wreath. Can harvest grapevines anytime. May have to pull 
leaves 
off. arts and crafts 
Bayberry wreath. Collected in woods and along shore. 
Delaware bayberry is smaller. I think 
it smells like Christmas; 
George thinks it smells like a hayfield. Cornhusk wreath. "My own 
original 
idea." Not hard to make, "nothing to 
it." Uses living 
room, kitchen as work area. May find things during trips to the 
Samuelson--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 30 
Catskills, especially the curly everlasting, a weed. "Prettier 
than ours." Makes a fuzzy mess. Likes to make dried arrangements 
(in addition to wreaths). (10 minutes) (plant) 
Describes process. Friend gives her flowers to dry. Some she 
raises. Terrible year for flowers--hot and dry. Some never 
opened. Stuff piles up 
in George's shed until she's ready to use 
it. 
Gathering pine cones. White pine cones good for background 
on wreath. Wreath that George made. Add greens to pine cone 
wreath at Christmas and use for door. George describes how to cut 
pine cones for wreath. Helen makes about 
20 wreaths during the 
year. Doesn't want to get too involved. Does it for pleasure. 
Cattails. Found 
in meadows, salt marshes, fresh water. 
Earlier you get them the smaller they are. July. Dry, spray with 
hair spray because there 
is a worm in there that turns them to 
fuzz. Hang them in shed by open window. (15 minutes) Arrangements 
of cattails, bittersweet and bayberry. 
Hates plastic and artificial stuff. Shows a wreath with 
plastic strawberries she had made for the church's Strawberry 
Festival which hadn't sold. Used to use secondhand artificial 
grapes 
Berlin auction--Thursdays (inside), Saturday and Sunday 
(outside). 
Used to sew for her children. Wreath making and canning 
satisfy creative impulse. aesthetics 
Things she likes to can. Likes to utilize everything. "There 
isn't anything I feel I couldn't can." Never had anything she 
didn't like. Freezes string beans, 
lima beans, corn, 
strawberries, raspberries, blueberries. Have big freezer. Feel 
more secure with canned things. Uses pressure cooker. (20 
minutes) George helps by peeling. Do more than they need. Take 
some to granddaughter in college. 
Peaches, beets, 
lima beans. 
Winemaking in Hammonton. George says they make dandelion wine. 
Made 
in spring. Sometimes get dandelions in Catskills. 
Description of how the wine 
is made. Rough recipe. Sauerkraut in 
crock now, 
in fermenting stage. Wine takes 10-12 days to ferment, 
depends on weather, heat. Same for sauerkraut. (25 minutes) 
foodways 
Get produce from their garden or from family members, their 
gardens and fields. Wouldn't make as much if 
she had to buy 
it. 
Younger family members do some canning. Women help each other. 
Her daughter this year just didn't have time and Helen wasn't 
going to push her. (Interview continues on PFP83-RSS016.)

TX01: G—Devonshire; 12GT Picking first peppers of the season. Don't 
can as many pickles as she used to. Sweet and sour pickles = 
bread and butter pickles. Bakes everything, doughnuts to bread. 
Lots of yeast dough. Fastnacht (means feast night), German 
doughnut, Lenten season. Stuff yourself, then lay off. Render own 
chicken fat. Her father was a baker and he used to make them (the 
doughnuts) on Shrove Tuesday. She makes a lot of them, people let 
her know. Former pastor of her church loves them and also likes 
her dandelion wine. foodways 
Dandelion wine is used as company or snack wine. Too sweet 
to be used as table wine. George tells story about early attempt 
at grape winemaking, termites ate through wine barrel. Helen has 
made wild cherry wine, medical purposes, for sore throats and 
colds. Too bitter. Describes process of making it. Wine and 
sugar, 2 Ibs of sugar to 1 gallon of juice. Tasting is 
important. 
Extra sweetening for dandelion wine. When chilled it sparkles 
like champagne. 
Tastes better chilled. Granddaughter wanted a 
bottle of the wine she could use when she got married someday. (5 
minutes) 
Meats. Like everything. Chicken, ham, mostly beef, roasts, 
stews. Loves to make soups. George doesn't care for them. 
Favorite meal--roast beef, deer meat, especially pickled like

sauerbraten. 
Spaezele, German noodle. Make gravy sour and have 
it with spaezele. 
Christmas. Many baked things. Cookies, stollen, give as 
gifts. Fruitcake, 
not as much as she used to because so many 
make their own or buy it. Expensive to make. (celebration) 
George peels apples, onions, peaches. Does more now that 
he's retired. Work together with string beans and lima beans. 
Wonders how she did 
it with the little kids around. 
George gathers pine cones, "gather here and there, 
saws 
them in half to open up 
into a flower design. Gathers cattails. 
Season for picking them. Helen: "The meadows are dead and the 
first thing you know, you're looking, and these things are there, 
the grasses, that fragmitis grass. It looks like it'll never come 
to 
life and there 
it 
is growing. I enjoy seeing that. You know 
it's going to happen because part of the Lord's plan, 
it never 
lets you down and there it 
is all 
of a sudden." gathering 
Garden. Corn, tomatoes (staked and wire capes), plum 
tomatoes (for ketchup), string beans (green and yellow), 
eggplants, potatoes (white and red), onions (good crop). Helen 
grows some herbs: thyme, majoram, oregano, basil, parsley, mint. 
George doesn't believe in planting marigolds to help keep pests 
away. This year overrun with spotted spider mites. (10 minutes) 
Attacked lima beans and tomatoes and marigolds. George 
is 
in 
charge of garden but Helen gives advice. He prepares the ground, 
plants the seeds, cultivates and irrigates, and harvests. He mows 
lawn and trims trees, rakes up the leaves. Doesn't like machine 
that chews up 
leaves. Composting. Raking leaves again. 
Helen does outside decorations for Halloween. Outside 
Christmas decorations. Christmas tree location. Chop down own 
tree. Put two or three pine trees together to make a more compact 
tree. Helen says George is not the happiest person when it comes 
to getting the tree. 
Stones that make up fireplace from surrounding fields. Built 
house themselves. Added on. Took about 3 years. Worked on 
weekends, evenings, summers. He worked at NAFEC at Pomona. 
Supervisor in the plumbing/pipe shop. 
Started as a pipefitter's 
helper. (15 minutes) 
Shows us growth on maple trees, branch fungi or lichen, 
bracken fungi. Also grows on birch. 
Introduces us to Helen's sister Emily who has brought over a 
pine cone wreath. Soak cones 
in water, push in frame, when they 
open up they lock each other in. 
Go down into cellar. Decide not to take recorder down there.

Resume in kitchen. Helen laughs about effect of tasting wine 
in cellar. Making spaezele--a filler, gives "body." 
(20 minutes) 
Jokes about cellar. Every spaezele isn't the same size. 
More about the kitchen 
area as early part of the house. 
Comments on rainstorm 
and warm temperatures. Wood stove in 
kitchen. Kitchen is headquarters in winter. Stove can heat living 
room in 
late afternoon. Warm nightgowns by stove. 
Bottle collection. Most came from their property. Everyone 
was collecting. Her father would turn over in his grave 
if 
he 
knew the stuff he had carted to the dump would turn up back 
in 
the house. 
(25 minutes)

in 
it.

Not so free with ketchup as gifts. Keeps 
it for George, he 
likes 
it. Mixed pickling spice. Don't measure anything, use 
whatever comes out of the garden, amount—wise. Save electricity. 
Cut up tomatoes and onions, cook with spices. Cook down until 
soft. Put cheesecloth over sieves, pour out. Water runs off 
immediately, pure white. Thick stuff, strain, cook another 15

If someone gives her something (already canned) she checks it 
out. Some jars are completely full. Handling pressure canner. If 
pressure goes down pulls liquid out of jar. 
foodways 
When she was a kid they didn't have pressure canners, used 
wash boiler and rack. For corn, 55 minutes for 9 pints in canner. 
Used to cook for 3 1/2 hours on wood stove at home. 
This area is part of her parents farm. Youngest sister is

Indiana, brought artisans with them. 
She worked there too, 
in 
summer, with glass cutters, held the sponge that dripped over 
glass cutter's wheel. Used be three or four small cut glass 
factories in Egg Harbor. 
Plants in arrangement--chrysanthemums, white adjoradum. 
Knows alternate names for wildflowers. Talk about coming back to 
visit. Dept. of Agriculture surveyed land when they first bought 
it, 
told them about the different kinds of soil they had, what

they could plant, aerial view of property. Needed room, but 
perfectly contented. Saved money for trees and shrubbery, wanted 
to get stuff started. Squirrels got to some stuff, hazelnuts, 
walnuts, 
chestnuts, peaches, apples. Mrs. Zimmer: "Too bad, you 
had nothing, right? You had plenty, and then some." Mr. Z: 
"And 
then they come work on my bird feeders, sunflower seeds." (7 
minutes) (plant), (animal) 
Impact of wine, powerful. Sugar, creates alcohol. 
Doing our laundry. 
Story about pipe fittings. 
Could've gotten homemade something from sister Emily. 
Own raspberries, several pickings, kept in refrigerator 
until enough for a batch. Don't need pectin. George jokes about 
giving wine soaked crackers to squirrels. 
Seed pods from polonia tree. 
Birds, enjoy watching anything that comes, even English 
sparrow. "Every bird 
is worth it's weight in gold." Chicakdee, 
titmouse, cardinal, nuthatch. Summer birds are gone. Red-breasted 
woodpecker. 10-12 types of sparrows, winter birds. 
(10 minutes) 
How did they get to recognize them: "Living with them 
and being 
interested in them." Lots of books, people knew they were 
interested. "You can't help but learn 
if you're interested in 
something." Wild doves, quail. 
Patio area. 
One Thanksgiving had a wild turkey 
in their yard, belonged 
to neighbor. 
Thanksgiving, family dinner. 
14 people around table. She 
tries to sit at end. Card table at end. 
If family gets bigger 
will get two church tables and put them in 
living room. 
(celebration) 
5 acres of 
land, down into cedar swamp. How parents' farm 
has been divided up among siblings. 
Mullica River, high water level. Tidal at about Crowley's 
Landing. Bay begins a little bit beyond Lower Bank. Northeast 
wind drives the water. Blow-out tide, strong northwest wind, 
blows water out, sometimes at places along the Mullica River can 
throw a stone across, "that's how much water is 
left." 
Crowley's Landing is part of Crowley Town. Boat ramp, 
bathing, picnic tables.

Egg Harbor Lake. Mr. Schmidt made it, Mr. Z. thinks. Mrs. Z. 
says city made it (15 minutes). Natural 
lake, stream starts at 
Eddie s. 
Mr. Z: 
"Yea, but they dammed it up." Mrs. Z: 
"Well, 
certainly, that, you do that with any lake, to make a body of 
water out of 
it. But it's a natural 
lake." 
Old—timer (Schmidt?) who believed in cedar water, had a 
sanitorium. Log cabins for patients. Place 
in Egg Harbor too. A 
snake affair on property where cedar water ran through and 
people, even 
in coldest weather walked through this water. All 
glass building, 
laid 
in sunlight for a cure. 
Boarded up house out on 563. A tavern. Belongs to city. The 
Bunglalow Inn. Someone has rented it and might open it. 
Nesco used to be called Nescohog, but people call 
it Nesco. 
Cookstown, now part of Devonshire area. This area is called 
Devonshire. Just a bend in the road. As a kid called this the 
agricultural district, even the name of the school, still called 
that, has nothing to do with the farming school. Used to fight 
against the name as kids. "We don't live 
in Devonshire, you know, 
we 
live 
in agricultural section, of the township." Get mail 
as 
Egg Harbor RFD. Devonshire, Elwood and DeCosta districts, then 
Hammonton s.tarts. To the north there's Nesco, Pleasant Mills, 
Weekstown. That comprises the township. Waona, this area where 
her family lived (?), they wanted to name it that. Had a meeting 
to discuss the name change when she was a kid. Primarily because 
of confusion about the agricultural school. Some people had 
it 
(Waona)on their trucks. Never established as a name. Baseball 
team, Waona Cubs. Local neighborhood ball group, quite active. 
Sizzling chicken fat. On low. Almost melted. Wood stove 
works good for it. Roast pork or ham, cut off fat, render it, use 
it for pie crust. 
Homemade lard. 
(20 minutes) So different from 
store lard, they pump water into 
it. Water in ham. 
Egg Harbor used to be on Mullica River. When railroad came 
through they called this area Egg Harbor. 
Sauerkraut crock. Even with all the salt on 
it still have to 
be careful, sterilize. Ferments. Brine. Hasn't turned color yet. 
Started the day before. Makes it every year but never this late. 
Big heads of cabbage (from New York State), "nothing to do but 
make s.auerkraut out of them." 50 cents a piece. 
Takes about 8 or 
9 days. Under the brine or else it spoils. Wash off inside of 
crock everyday with a paper towel. (25 minutes) 
Getting stuff ready to cut up for chow chow. "Doesn't that 
look, 
in that plate, and the big slab of bread, 
like an old 
Russian still 
life or something?" aesthetics, place names

Could sell her chow chow. Get along with what they have. Use

chow. 
Chop up vegetables, put 
in a salt brine overnight, sprinkle
