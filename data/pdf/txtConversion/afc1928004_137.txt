BRIGHT, ROSY MORNING. 
The bright rosy morning 
Peeps over the hills ; 
With blushes adorning 
The meadows and fields. 
CHORUS. 
While the merry, merry, horn 
Calls, come, come away, 
Awake from your slumbers, 
And hail the new day. 
The stag, roused before us, 
Away seems to fly, 
And pants to the chorus 
Of hounds in full cry. 
Then follow, follow, follow, follow, 
The musical chase; 
Where pleasure and vigor, 
And health all embrace. 
The day's sport, when over, 
Makes blood circle right; 
And gives the brisk lover, 
Fresh charms for the night. 
Then let us, let us now enjoy 
All we can while we may ; 
Let love crown the night, boys, 
As our sports crown the day.

In beauty gleam'd the moon last night, 
And brightly steno nips shone, 
Th e wind fnnong the linden trees, 
Mad e music sad and lone ; 
The shadows of the fire-li.dit danc'd 
Like sprites upon the floor, 
As moon arid star ray gently fell 
Around the cottage door— 
With breathings husli'd, we sat around 
The couch where Ettie 
And wept that one so beautiful, 
So soon must pass away. 
She wore within her golden hair, 
A mesh of changeful light. 
And mingled with her dark eyes' sheen 
Were spirit gleams last night ; 
Upon their light and viewless wings, 
The angels downward came, 
And stole within the cottage door , 
And que iclied our loveli ,da flame-

On yester eventide.

And you don't feel gay, 
When husbands come rolling home,

When the wine's in, the wit's out,

Oh, dear! 13h, dear

It's clear ! it's clear !

And don't your loving partners shock, 
When at early day, 
You, husbands, come reeling home. 
At the break of day, clix.

THE CHi3
ISE GIANT, 
By J. A HARDWICK. 
Ant :—" The Crocodile." 
The Fychow giant, Chang-woo-Gow, 
To<reach us has contrived here; 
And proves the heaviest China mail, 
That ever yet arrived here. 
'We want some great men, very much. 
Of weight in this tree nation ; 
'Though we have many who are such 
In their own estimation. 
Re writes his autograph, we read, 
Twelve feet high on the ceiling; 
His signature is called his chop, 
The Chinese style revealing. 
If he keeps only wide awake, 
He'll make a 
tidy living; 
And gain a 
valuable eteak (stake) 
For every chop he's giving. 
He's had to sleep upon the floor, 
Bedsteads too short. deploring; 
His legs hang down three flights of stains, 
While he's on the top floor snoring. 
To remedy that Charles Dickens did, 
An intimation send him; 
That while hero the great bed of Ware, 
He'd very kindly lend him. 
Of coairse, with aldermen he'll feed, 
The Lord Mayor so has told him ; 
And wii h 
Gog and Magog blow a 
weed, 
If the Guildhall will hold him. 
'Twould be a 
good thing if he walked, 
The Mansion House as far down • 
And with his head as through he stalked, 
Knocked black old Temple Bar down. 
Be has a 
wife, though he's Chinese, 
It's said she is a 
Tartar; 
And though he's twice as big as her, 
She can make him a 
smarter. 
And when in quarrels they . engage, 
It shows by the lady's fhshion; 
Mrs. Chan ,r-woo7gow is all the rage, 
While (Sang s

He wears the original seven-league boots, 
At least so says the paper ; 
His tile's so tall, it may be called, 
A regular skyscraper. 
It would employ all Spitalflelds 
Silk for his state robes weaving; 
'Tis said he smokes his own pigtail, 
:But that there's no believing. 
Of foreign famed exhibitors, 
Chang-woo-gow is the latest; 
And of all the great sensations out 
This giant is the greatest. 
It is reported off silver plate, 
He daily is a 
diner; 
Now here takes tea in ditto cups, 
And tnens lit.) his 11U.Se at China., 
SOFTLY TREAD. 
By G. 
BECKETT. 
There was a 
little fair hair'd boy, 
Play'd rontid its mother's knee; 
His lisping tongue and pretty smile, 
Was full of infant glee. 
She gaz'd upon her little child, 
And took hint to her breast ; 
She kiss'd his noble fore ead. 
And his tiny hand she press'd. 
CHORUS. 
Willie now is sleeping, 
Too soon, alas was sigh'd; 
The nmther she was weeping, 
For her little one had died. 
Another year has pass'd away, 
'Midst troubles, hopes and fears; 
The mother she seems happy, 
Yet oft sheds silent tears. 
Her footsteps to the churchyard 
May be trac'd at eventide; 
For she strews the grave with roam 
Of the little one that died. 
Softly o'er the hallow'd turf, 
prithee softly tread ; 
Break not the peaceful slumber, 
Of the little one that's dead. 
THE SCARLET FLOWER. 
She's gentle as the zephyr, 
That sips of every sweet; 
She's fairer than the fairest lily, 
In nature's soft retreat. 
Her eyes are like the crystal brook, 
And bright and clear to see ; 
Her lips outshine the scarlet flower, 
Of bonnie Ellerslie. 
Oh, were my love a 
blossom, 
When summer skies depart ;. 
I'd plant her in my bosom. 
Her garden, here, my eart. 
And oft I'd kiss her balmy lips, 
So beautiful to see; 
That far outshines the scarlet flower, 
Of bonnie Ellerslie. 
Might I 
be king of Scotland's throne, 
And a' the world beside ; • 
Right glad I'd give my crown to he; 
That lovely maid, my bride. 
The gate of heaven is at her lip, 
Denied alas! to me— 
That lip which shames the acarlet flown' 
Of bonnie 
sketki. 
ISIY RATTLING MARE AND I. 
By 
HARRY Currox. 
I 
am a 
country carrier, a 
jovial soul am I, 
I 
whistle and sing from morn till night,and trouble I 
do defy; 
I've one to bear me company, of work she does her share, 
It's not my wife upon my life, but a 
rattling old bay mare. 
Round goes the world, trouble I 
defy, 
Jogging along together, my boys, my rattling mare and L 
• 
Up and down the country side, the mare and I 
we go, 
The folks they kindly greet us, as we journey too and fro, 
The little ones they cheer us, and the old ones they stop and 
stare, 
And lift their eyes, with great surprise, at Joe and his 
rattling mare. 
Round goes, ekc. 
And, when the roads are heavy, or travelling up hill, 
in by her side assisting her, she works with such good will ; 
I 
know she loves me well enough, because the whip I 
spare, 
I'd rather hurt myself than hurt, my rattling old bay mare. 
Round goes, &c. 
And when the town we reach, she rattles over the stones, 
Slie lifts her head so splendid.y, nut one of your lazy drones; 
It's " Clear the road when Joseph comes," my crawlers all take 
care 
Of the carrier's cart, the driver smart, and the rattling old 
bay mare. 
Round goes, &c. 
I 
would not change my station with the noblest in the land, 
I 
would not be Prime Minister or anything so grand, 
I 
would not be an Alderman, to live in luxury 
And state, if it would seperate the old bay mare and I. 
Round goes. circ,

FAR AWAY, WHERE ANGELS DWELL. 
By JACQUES IMUMENTIIAL. 
At the door of a 
sad abode, for her mother a 
child was wailing, 
"Begone I" said a voice stern and rude, " thy pray'rs are 
unavailing." 
"I crave to see my mother dear," replied the child with heart 
nigh breaking, 
When one who saw her, pity taking, thus spike, her drooping 
soul to cheer :— 
" 
Calm thy sorrow! comfort borrow? she is gone who lov'd 
thee well, 
Far away, where angels dwell. 
Orphan lone ! thy mother's gone, far away where angels dwell.' 
She asks all who round her throng for the way that she must 
journey : 
They say that " the voyage is long, and the road is rough and 
thorny ;" 
But hope ey'ry step attends; a 
holy zeal and passion fires her 
With strength and courage faith inspires her, and charity as-
sistance lends. 
As she wanders, oft she ponders on her mother loy'd so well, 
Hoping soon with her to dwell. 
Scarce she grieves, for she believes soon she'll be where angels 
dwell. 
One night, faint with hunger and fear, she sank on a 
plain, cold 
and arid ; 
A kind shepherd, wandering near, the child to a 
convent carried, 
The sisters haste by to aid her— too late she sleeps to waken 
never ; 
And death that two fond hearts could sever reuuiteth them on 
high. 
Heav'n 'lath call'd her near her mother, near that mother lov'd 
so well, 
Far away where angels dwell. 
Orphan blest! oh I 
calm thou 'it restl far away, where angels

HARDWICK. 
Parody on " I 
like to be a 
swell,* 
I 
never was cut out to be 
An old maid full of grief; 
With only parrots, cats, and doge, 
To give my mind relief.

I'm not ashamed to tell, 
To take me out, and roani about. 
I 
like a

FAIR LILY OF THE VALE.

Thy sweets shall not wither, 
Unsheltered here beneath the chilling gale,

Come, come, come then come, 
Come where no harm can assail, 
I'll cherish a 
duty, 
In shielding thy beauty, 
Fair Lily, fair Lily of the Vale. 
Of one stricken-hearted, 
From earth now departed, 
Of whom so oft we told the piteous tale, 
What thoughts, newly burning, 
What days seem returning, 
At sight of thee, Youag Lily of the Vale. 
Come, come, ch. 
Thy light pearly clusters, 
Thy soft modest lustre, 
Shall grace my humble cot in yonder dale, 
And there in fond measure, 
Of her, our lost treasure, 
sing to thee, fair Lily of the Vale.

Make me no gaudy chaplet, 
Weave it in simple flowers, 
Seek them in lowly alieys, 
After the gentle showers.

Gay in the sunshine glowing, 
Bring me the pale muss rose- bud, 
Beneath the fresh leaves growing. 
Bring not the proud ey'd blossom,

Bring me the snowy lily, 
Floating oa silent waters ; 
Gems of the lowly valley,

My heart then filled ‘Nith fright I'm sure,

thought what I 
could do, 
But I 
spoke up and to him said, 
I 
am not seeking you. 
Fear overcame my courage then, 
I 
hung my head and sigled ; 
He took toe by the hand and said, 
Will you be my bride? 
I 
blushed still deter then I 
own, 
And thought what can I 
do, 
I 
said, pray sir, leave roe alone,

Still more terror o'er me stole, 
I 
sinking faintly cried, 
I 
wish I 
was at home once more, 
And by my mother's side, 
He kissed me tenderly, 
I 
thought what can I

THE REAPER ON THE PLAIN, 
Word by C. G. EASTMAN. Music by G. F. Roar. 
Bending o'er his sickle 
Mid the yellow grain, 
Lo! the sturdy reaper 
Reaping on the plain ; 
Singing as the sickle, 
Gathers to his hand, 
Rustling in its ripeness, 
The glory of his land, 
Mark the grain before him, 
Swaying in the wind, 
And the even gavel, 
Following behind, 
Bound in arm full bundles, standing one by one, 
The yester' morning's labor 
Ripens in the sun. 
Long I've stood and ponder'd 
Gazing from the bill, 
While the sturdy reaper, 
Sung and labor'd still: 
Bending o'er his sickle, 
'Mid the yellow grain, 
Happy and contented 
Reaping on the plain. 
And as upon my journey 
I 
leave the maple tree, 
Thinking of the difference 
Between the man and me, 
I 
turn again to see him 
Reaping on the plain, 
And almost wish my labor 
Were the sickle and the grain 
THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER. 
There was a 
youth, and a 
well beloved youth 
And he was a 
squire's son, 
lie loved the bailiff's daughter, dear, 
That lived in Islington ; 
But she was coy, and never could 
On him her heart bestow, 
Till he was sent to London town, 
Because he loved her so. 
When seven years had passed away, 
She put on mean attire, 
And straight to London she would go, 
About him to enquire; 
And as she went along the road, 
Through weather hot and dry, 
She rested on a 
grassy load, 
And her love came riding by. 
"Give me a 
penny, thou 'prentice good, 
Relieve a 
maid forlorn ;" 
" 
Before I 
give you a 
penny, sweetheart 
Pray, tell me where you were born." 
"Oh, I 
was born at Islington— " 
" 
Then tell me if you know, 
The bailiffs daughter of that place." 
"She died, sir, long ago 1" 
" 
If she he dead, then take my horse, 
My saddle and bridle also, 
For I 
will to some distant land, 
Where no one shall me know. 
" 
0 
stay, oh stay, thou goodly youth, 
She standeth by thy side ; 
She's here alive, she is not dead, 
But ready Co be thy bride."

THE THREE AGES OF LOVE. 
Words by H. F. CHORLEY. 
Music by E. J. Loom 
O'er the early time of Love, 
When my filmy used to rove, 
From the black.eyes to the blue, 
From the tiny to the tall. 
When as many girls were dear, 
As the days that jilt the year, 
Awl the newest and the youngest 
Was the fairest of them all. 
[Repeat 
When I 
lived but in her sight, 
And laid awake all night, 
Ere I 
met her in the greenwood, 
On a 
dewy morn of May. 
And a 
treasure passing rare, 
Was a 
stolen tress of hair, 
0 
merry days of youth, 
'Twas a 
sin ye could not stay, 
0. the manly time of love! 
Tho' the face TOT which I 
strove, 
From its cheek hath lost a 
rose— 
From its eyes one shade of blue. 
The' I 
see a 
furrow now, 
On its mild and matron brow, 
The years that d 
liii it'd its beauty 
have made it dearer too. 
And my heart it swells with pride, 
To see her by my side, 
Or to hear her singing tenderly 
Some old and simple lay. 
When the fire is burning bright, 
On a 
stormy winter night, 
0 
days of home delight! 
Ye should never pass away. 
But Age comes creeping near, 
With his forehead bleak and sere, 
And his heavv, heavy, ear, 
And his voice so small and shrill. 
When my step must totter slow, 
And my strength must dwindle low, 
Till a 
baby with its little hand, 
Can lead me where it will. 
Bnt tho' manhood's prime be past— 
So long as time shall last, 
Her gentle voice shall eln'er me, 
Still her faithful arm sustain. 
And our love shall even brave 
The parting of the grave. 
For I 
know there's bliss beyond, 
And we shall meet again.

WILL NO MAIDEN MARRY ME. 
By II. K 
LEBER, 
All the girls are getting married— 
Dropping off on every side, 
Ah I 
I 
fear too long I've tarried, 
Seeking, sighing for a 
bride. 
CHORUS, 
Here I 
am, ye tender damsels, 
Young and handsome as you see, 
Will no maiden marry ? marry I 
Will no maiden marry me? 
I 
could get a 
weeping widow, 
Almost any day, of course, 
Or a 
lady rendered single, 
By a by a 
late divorce. 
But I 
want a 
tend,r rose-
bud, 
Innocent, and full of glee: 
Will no maiden, tic. 
Oh! in pity don't deny me, 
Let we end this weary life, 
I 
would swim the wide Atlantic, 
Could I 
thereby gain a 
wife, 
I'm in enonest, I 
am pleading, 
Here upon my bolded kuoe, 
Will no, dm 
All is over ! I 
am married ! 
What a 
hasty fool am I, 
Whore's the end or all creation, 
Let, oh ! lot rue thilher fly, 
Help, oh I 
help me, cunning lawyer, 
Loose my bonds and set me free, 
I 
will be your debtor forever, 
If you will uutharry me. 
WHERE ARE NOW THE HOPES I CHERISHED. 
Words by CHARLES JEFFREYS. 
Music by BELLD.a. 
Where are now the hopes I 
cherished, 
Where the joys that once were mine ? 
Gone forever—all have perished, 
And the blighter's baud was thine! 
Look upon me, and remember 
Thy Norma ere she was bet ray'd ; 
Look again, and look exulting, 
On the ruin thou bast made, 
Look again, and look exulting 
On the ruin thou hast made. 
Canst thou think as thou dost listen 
To thy children's artless songs, 
Of that moment when their fond hearts 
First shall feel their mother's wrongs? 
Ha! thou shrinkest like the lightning 
To thy bosom fell remorse shall dart, 
And thou yet shall know the anguish 
Which bath broken my poor heart, 
And thou yet shall know the anguish 
Which bath broken my poor heart.

Come, come away;

FIERCE FLAMES ARE RAGING. 
By CHARLES JEFFY.r.r3. 
Fierce flames are raging, 
Loud clamor fills the air, 
Mad crowds rush forward, 
Eager for horrors there; 
Hark ! to their wild shouts, 
List to that piercing cry, 
Poor friendless gipsey, 
Must she thus die! 
CHORUS. 
Flames close around her, 
While fiercely they rise, 
Writhing with torture, 
Her loud shrieks, her loud shrieks, 
Her shrieks reach the Elik'S. 
There roars the burning pyre, 
There stands the doomed one, 
Demons exulting, laugh at each deep groan, 
Howling like wild beasts ; 
Yet in her agony, 
From hill side to hill side, 
Echoes her death cry, 
Flames close around her, ckc, 
OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT. 
Oft in the stilly night, ere slumber's chains have bound me, 
Fond memory brings the light of other days around me 
The smiles, the tears of childhood's years, 
The words of love then spoken, 
The eyes that shone, now dimm'd and gone, 
The cheerful heart now broken. 
When I 
remember all the friends so linked together, 
I've seen around me fall like leaves in wintry weather; 
I 
feel like one who treads alone some banquet hall deserted, 
Whose lights are fled, whose garlands dead, 
And all but he departed.

NEAR THE BROKEN STILE. 
Early in the morning, ' mid the meadows gay, 
While the breeze was scented with the new mown bay, 
Ev'ry bud and blossom sweetly seemed to smile, 
When by chime'', he met me, ttear the broken stile. 
Little then was spoken, yet did he disclose 
Thoughts, that came like perfume from the op'ning rose, 
Ev'ry bud and blossom sweetly seemed to smile, 
When, by chance, he tnet me near the brol.en stile. 
Gaudy flow'rs were blooming, and the golden corn 
In the breeze was wa ving at the early morn ; 
When again I 
met him, ling'ring near the stile, 
Swift he came to great me with a 
gentle smile. 
E 
tritest words were spoken, wand .ring by my side, 
'Till he claimed my promise that I'd be his bride. 
Oh ! I 
love the morning- when with gentle Ftnile, 
Swift he came to greet me, near the brokenstile. 
Soon beside the altar, hand in hand we stood. 
Ileart to heart respotokil truly as they should, 
While above the vallies rose the morning sun, 
Voices whispered round us, he and I 
were one. 
Since that morn with pleasure ey'ry hour's been rife, 
lie calls me his treasure, and his darling wife, 
Gladly we remember, when with lovim, 
smile, 
Promises were given near the broken stile.

WITHIN A MILE OF EDINBORO' TOWN. 
'Twits within a 
mile of Edinboro' town. 
In the rosy time of the year, 
Sweet flowers bloom'd and the grass was down 
And each shepherd woo'd his dear. 
Barmy Jocky blithe and gay 
Kiss'd sweet Jenny makin' hay, 
The lassie blusli'd and frowning cry'd, 
No, no, it will not do, 
I 
cannot, cannot, wonnot, wonnot, wonnot, buckle ton. 
Jocky was a 
wag that never would wed, 
Tho' long he had foilow'd the lass, 
Contented she earn'd and eat her own bread, 
And merrily turfed up the grass. 
Bonny Jocky blithe and free, 
Won her heart right merrily; 
Yet still she blushed and frowning cried 
No, no it will not do, I 
cannot, &c. 
But when he vow'd he would make her his bride, 
Tim' his flocks and herds were not few, 
She gave him her hand and a 
kiss beside. 
And vow'd she'd forever be true. 
Bonny Joeky blithe and free, 
Won her heart right merrily ; 
At church she no more frowning cry'd, 
No, no it will not do. I

OH I 
ARE I THEN REMEMBERED. 
Oh I 
am I 
then remembered still! 
Remembered too by thee I 
Or am I 
quite forgot by one 
Whom I 
no more shall see ? 
Yet say not so, for that would add 
Fresh anguish to my lot. 
I 
dare not hope to be recalrd— 
Yet would not be forgot. 
Had they who parted us but known 
How hearts like ours can feel, 
They would have spared us both a 
pang 
Beyond their power to heal. 
I 
know not if 
by heart retains 
Its wonted warmth or not ; 
Though I'm forbid to think of thee— 
Thou'lt never be forgot. 
May'st thou enjoy that peace of mind, 
Which I 
can never know 
If that's denied, my prayer shall be, 
That I 
may share thy wo. 
Where'er thou art, my every wish 
Will linger o'er that spot; 
My every thought will be of thee, 
Though I 
may be forgot. 
If we should meet in after years. 
Thou'lt find that I 
am changed: 
My eyes grown dim, my cheek grown pale, 
But not my faith estranged, 
From memory's dage the hand of death 
Alone thy name shall blot ; 
Forget. forsake me, if thou wilt— 
Thoult never be forgot. 
PRETTY MOCKING BIRD. 
Living echo, bird of eve,

FLOW ON, THOU SHINING RIVER. 
Flow on, thou shining river, 
But ere thou reach the sea, 
Seek Ella's bower, and give her 
The wreaths I 
fling o'er thee; 
And tell her thus, if she'll be mine, 
The current of our lives shall be, 
With joys along their course to shine, 
Like those sweet flowers on thee. . 
But if, in wand'ring thither, 
Thou find'st she mocks my pray'r, 
Then leave those wreaths to wither 
Upon the cold bank there ; 
And tell her thus, when youth is o'er, 
Her lone and lovely charms shall be 
Thrown upon life's weedy shore, 
Like those sweet flowers from thee. 
W H EN LIFE LOOKS LONE AND DR EARY. 
When life looks lone and dreary, 
What light can dispel the gloom, 
When time's swift wing grows weary, 
What charm can refresh his plume ; 
Tis woman, whose sweetness beameth 
O'er all that we feel or see, 
And if man of heav'n e'er dreametb, 
'Tis when he thinks purely of thee. 
Oh, woman ! 
Let conquerors fight for glory,— 
. 
Too dearly the meed they gain, 
Let patriots live in story, 
Too often they die in vain ; 
Give kingdoms to those who choose 'em, 
This world can (offer to me 
No throne like bcauty's bosom, 
No freedom like serving thee. 
Oh, woman 1 
IN NOT MYSELF AT ALL. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
Oh ! I'm not myself at all, buy dear, Molly dear, 
Frit not myself at all. 
Nothing- caring. nothing- knowing, ' tis after you I'm going, 
Faith your shadow 't 
is 
growing-, Molly dear. Molly dear, 
And I'm not. myself at all. 
TIt'other day I 
w,nt confessin' and I 
asked the father's blessin' 
But, says I," 
don't give me one entirely, 
For I 
fretled so last year, 
But the half o me is here, 
So give the other half to Molly Brierly ; 
Oh! I'm not myself at all." 
Oh I 
I'm not myself at all, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
My appetite's so small, 
I 
once could pick a 
goose, but my buttons is no use. 
Faith my tightest coat is loose, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
And I'm not myself at all. 
If thus it is I 
waste, you'd better dear make haste, 
Before your lover's gone away entirely 
If you dont soon change your mind, 
Not a 
bit of me you'l find. 
And what ' nil you think o' that, Molly Brierly ? 
Oh, l'm not myself at all. 
Oh ! my shadow on the wall, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Isn't like myself at all. 
For I've got so very thin, myself says 'tisn't him, 
But that purty girl so slim, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
And I'm not myself at all. 
If thus I 
smaller grow, all fretting dear for you, 
'Tis you should make me up the deficiency, 
So just let Father Taaf 
Make you my better half, 
And you will not the worse for the addition be; 
Oh, Yin not myself at all. 
I'll be not myself at all, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Till you my own I 
call, 
Since a change o'er me there came, sure you might change 
your name, 
And ' twould just come to the same, Molly dear, Molly dear, 
Oh I 'twould just come to the same; 
For if you and 1 
were one, all confusion would be gone, 
And 'twould simplify the mother entirely, 
And twould save us so much bother, 
When we'd both be one another, 
So listen now to rayson Molly Brierly; 
Oh I 
I'm not myeslf at Fn.

GENTLE HALLIE. 
By T. Sr. Joins. 
The sun has set in the west, 
The moon is climbing the hill, 
The old clock's striking the hour 
We promised to meet by the mill; 
I 
must bid her a 
long farewell, 
And oh I 'twill be with a 
sigh, 
As I 
watch by the pale moonlight, 
The tears that fall from her eye. 
Weep no more, gentle Mille, 
Let no tear- drop fall for me, 
The stars will twinkle one by one, 
And guide my bark safe o'er the sea. 
There's a 
charm in everything near, 
The sky, the earth, and the sea, 
But my thoughts turn away from those, 
And lovingly go to thee ; 
The love that I 
cherish for them, 
Is deep as such love can be; 
But deep as it is, is weak and faint, 
Compared with my love for thee. 
Weep no more, dr; 
When the slumbering sea lies still, 
Unstir'd by the breez ,.'s breath, 
And its stillness almost seems, 
The pulseless calm of death ; 
When I 
am far, far away, 
Where'er my bark may be, 
As the soft balmy air glides along, 
May it bring some tidings of thee. 
Weep no more, cto.

01 SAY NOT WOMAN'S LOVE IS BOUGHT. 
0 ! 
sav not woman's love is bought 
With vain and empty treasure; 
0! say not woman's heart is caught 
By every idle pleasure. 
When fir,t 
her gentle bosom knows 
Love's flame, it wanders never; 
Deep in her heart the passion glows ; 
She loves, and 
for ever. 
0 ! sax- not woman's false as fair: 
That like the bee she ranges, 
Still,:et.kin , flowers more sweet and rare, 
As fickle fancy changes. 
Ab ! no : the love that first can warm, 
Will leave her bos.un never; 
No second passion e'er can charm; 
She ioves and loves for ever.

DAWN OF DAY. 
P RIMA DONNA WALTZ . 
By JULIEN. 
NOW fades the star's soft ray, 
Stvift comes t , e 
dawn of day; 
From hedges near the chanticleer, 
Sends forth his matin lay; 
Then leave thy joyful dream 
And watch the sun's first beam 
Rise from the lake, where wings '
twill take, 
To climb the sky serene. 
The horn so clear is sounding near, 
As antlers free, bound on with glee. 
And swift the hounds' loud baying, 
In echoes float along; 
For now ' tis nt on and from the corn, 
The sky- lark springs to plume her wings, 
And as from eartn she .s 
straying,— 
Out pours her joyous song. 
Then wake from I 
gilt repose, , 
Thy laughing eyes unclose, 
Sweet soutg 
of cheer now greet the ear; 
We'll haste where beauty glows. 
Together we will rove 
The glen and flow'ry grove, 
And purest joy without alloy, 
Shall bless our mutual love! 
THE CRADLE SONG. 
Sweet and low, sweet and low, 
Wind of the western sea ; 
Low, low, breathe and blow, 
Wind of the western sea, 
Over the rolling waters go 
Come from the dropping moon and blow 
Dow din again, again, to me, 
While tuy little one sleeps, 
While my pretty one sleeps. 
Sleep and re-t, sleep and rest, 
Father will come to thee soon; 
Rest. rest on mother's breast: 
Father w:11 come to thee soon; 
Father will come to the babe in his nest 
Silver sails all out of the west' 
Under the moon, the silver moon, 
Sleep, my little one, sleep, 
Sleep, my pretty one, sleep. 
TEANIE ViTITH THE LIGHT BROWN HAIR. 
I

Borne lik- a

Many were the blithe birds that warble them o'er, 
I 
dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, - 
Flouting like a

I 
long for Jeanie With the day dawn smile. 
Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile ; 
I 
heard her. Juelodips, like joys gone by, 
Sighing rattod my heart o'er the Mud hopes that die 
Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the r 
Wailing for the lost one that conies not again ; 
On ! I 
iong for Jeanie, and wy heart bows low, 
Never wore to find her where the bright waters fi 
I 
sigh for Sc tide, but her light form stayed 
Far from the fond hearts round her native glade, 
Her smiles have vanished, aud her sweet songs flown, 
Flittiag like the dreams that have cheered us and gone 
Now the noditing wild flowers may wither on the shore 
While her gentle fingers will coil them no more • 
=Oh! I

Floating like a

THE DREAM IS PAST, 
By S. GLOVER. 
The dream is past, and with it fled, 
The hopes that once my passion fed, 
And darkly die mid grief and pain, 
The joy that's gone comes not again ; 
ISly soul in silence and in tears, 
Has cherisled now' for many years, 
A love for one who does not know, 
The thoughts that in my bosom glow ; 
Oh, cease, my heart, thy throbbing hider 
Another soon will be his bride, 
And hope's last faint but cheering ray, 
Will then forever pass away. 
They cannot see the silent tear, 
That falls unchecked when none are near, 
Nor do they mark the smothered sigh,. 
That heaves my breast when they are by, 
I 
know my cheek is paler now, 
And smiles no longer deck ray brow; 
'Tie youth's decay, 'twill soon begin, 
To tell the thoughts that dwell within, 
Oh, let me rouse my sleeping pride, 
And from his gaze my feelings hide; 
He shall not smile to think that I 
With love for him could pine and die,. 
THOU ART NINE OWN, LOVE. 
Then art mine own love, how can I 
bear to part, 
That thou hast all my heart, dearest, helieve 
Thou hest this soul of mine— so wholly is it thine, 
That I

Blue is the flow'ret call'd the " Forget-me-not." 
Ah, lay it on thy heart and think of me.

Ala:—"Father, Come home!" 
Spoken.—Now, I'll tell you what I 
say to my Sarah, when she's 
taken the pledge, at the pawnehop, and joiu'd the Anti-Teetetalkrs. 
Sarah, old Sarah, come home with me now, 
The time is about half-past one; 
You said, 'pon your soul, you'd sober come home, 
As soon as your washing was done. 
And here out all day you've been on the lark, 
And lashing since morning at ten; 
With the kids iu the gutter making dirt pies, 
And eall'd, too, has three tallymen. 
Roll home ! roll home ! roll home! 
Now, Sarah, " tight " Sarah, come home! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, hear my sweet voice draw it mild, 
Out the bobbies will not let you roam ; 
Sal, how will you manage to tumble up stairs/ 
Now, Sarah, do Sarah, come home. 
Sarah, my Sarah, jog on with me now, 
I'm blow'd if it hasn t 
struck two; 
You don't go to sleep on a 
door step, old girl. 
I 
won't chance being lock'd up thro' you. 
Why, you are getting worse, keep your pecker up, Sat, 
Your bonnet's all tatter'd and torn: 
get you, if you will but come on, old girl. 
A 
bloater, soft-reed, in the morn. 
Roll home, &e. with Chorus. 
Sarah, you Sarah, trot home with me now 
There's " Big Ben" a 
striking for three; 
Well, there now, she's : ell down, and sprawling along. 
I'm hang'd if she doesn't beat me. 
So, that is the way my Sar.li I've led, 
Along when she's been jolly " tight ;" 
And these are the very same words I 
have said, 
To /
Ay beautiful, Many a nigt

knelt in 
the 
greenwood to 
Nel - lie 
Dun - bar! 
A blush on her fair cheek, a 
tear in her eye, 
While her bright lips were parted with love's happy sigh,— 
She whisper'd, " This heart is not mine to bestow, 
It has long been thine own, dear, for weal or for woe I" 
Ah I 
more than all others I 
loved her by far, 
When I 
knelt at the altar with Nellie Dunbar! 
TIRE YOUNG RECRUIT. 
See! these ribbons gaily streaming, 
l'm a 
soldier now, Lizette, 
I'm a 
soldier now, Lizette: 
Yes, of battle I 
am dreaming, 
And the honor I 
shall get, 
With a 
sabre by my side, 
And a 
helmet on my brow, 
And a 
proud steed to ride, 
I 
shall rush on the foe. 
Yes, I 
flatter me, Lizette, 
"Ds a 
life that well will suit, 
The gay life of a 
young Recruit, 
The gay life of a 
young Recruit. 
We will march away to morrow, 
At the breaking of the day, 
At the breaking of the day, 
And the trumpets will be sounding, 
And the merry cymbals play. 
Yet, before I 
say good bye, 
And a 
last sad parting take, 
As a 
proof of your love, 
Wear this gift for my sake; 
Then, cheer up, my own Lizette, 
Let not grief your beauty stain, 
Soon you'll see the recruit again, 
Soon you'll see the recruit again. 
Shame! Lizette, to be weeping, 
While there's fame in store for me, 
While there's fame in store for me, 
Think when home I 
am returning, 
What a 
joyful day 'twill be, 
When to church you're fondly led, 
Like some lady smartly drest, 
And a 
hero you shall wed, 
'With a 
medal on his beast. 
Ha! there's not a 
maiden fair, 
But with welcome will salute, 
The gay bride of the young recruit, 
The gay bride of the young recruit. 
WORK I 
WORK! 
ROUND. 
Drive on, drive on, you lazy drone; 
To earn your bread this must be done, 
Or else you'll starve the bird you've won.

SONG OF MEG: 
AIR:—" The Star Spangled Banner." 
When Bibo went down to the re"-ions below, 
Where Lethe and Styx round eternity flow; 
He wak'd in the boat. and he would be rowed back, 
For his soul it was thirsty, and wanted some sack. 
But Charon replied, you were drunk when you died, 
And ne'er felt the pains that to death are allied: 
Take me back, replied Bib°, I 
mind not the pain 
And if I 
was drunk let me die () ace again. 
Forp,-et, replied Charon, those regions of strife, 
Drink of Lethe divine, ' tis the fountain of life, 
Where the soul is new born, and all past is a 
dream, 
E'en the gods themselves sip of the care drowning stream. 
The gods ! replied Bibo—drink water who will. 
The maxims of mortals I'll ever fulfill ;. 
Si prate not to me of your Lethe divine 
Our Lethe on earth is a 
bumper of wine. 
At length grim old Cerberus gave a 
loud roar.. 
When the crazy old bark struck the Stygian shore, 
Then Bubo got up. and he stau-gered to land, 
And jostled the ghosts, as they Ftood on the strand-
Says Charon, I 
tell you, ' tis vain to rebel, 
For your banish'd from earth, and shut up in 
That's a 
truth, replied Bib°, I 
know by this sign, 
For 'tis hell upon earth to be wanting of wine.

NY COT BESIDE THE SEA. 
A 
cot that stood beside the sea 
Was once my childhood's home; 
But I 
bad seen tall ships go by, 
And long'd with them to roam; 
I 
had nly wish, and far and wide 
I 
travers'd o'er the world, 
And saw with pride in distant lands, 
My native flag unfurl'd ; 
Yet absence gave may early home, 
A 
thousand charms to me, 
And more than palaces I 
priz'd, 
My cot beside the sea, 
My cot beside the sea. 
Tho' kind hearts beat in many lands, 
Tho' gentle looks were true, 
My longing hopes of home gave birth 
To many a 
fervent pray'r. 
And when I 
laid me down to rest, 
The sweet desire of day, 
Gave place to bright and happy dreams, 
Of dear ones far away. 
I 
woke, and fondly thought their dreams, 
Perchance had been of me: 
Thus day and night I 
longed to greet, 
My cot beside the sea. 
I 
hailed at length the happy land, 
I 
pressed my native shore, 
I 
felt my heart grow young again. 
What could I 
ask for more. 
But phantom-like my visions fled, 
The friends I 
love are gone, 
A 
stranger in my childhood's home, 
I 
stand unloved, unknown : 
Yet while one link in meary's chain 
Unbroken there shall be— 
'Twill bind me to that once lov'd home 
My cot beside the sea. 
A 
DOWN WHERE THE VIOLETS BLOOM. 
The spot I 
seek at evening's close, 
Where oft we met at yore, 
A 
smile of sunshine round it glows, 
Like that Eden wo re; 
The gold flowers of the wild gorse tree, 
Like tiny stars illume, 
The haunt of fairy bird and bee, 
Down where the violets bloom. 
The hawthorn bushes scent the air, 
As robed in white they stand, 
Like village maidens forming there, 
A happy bridal band ; 
As on the daisied green I 
lay 
Life has for me no gloom, 
For sweetly glide the hours away, 
flown where the violets bloom. 
THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
Proud flag of my country ! all gallantly streaming, 
In the breeze of the battle when glory appears, 
The stern scarlet blaze of its hurricane braving, 
While mercy hangs round with her olives and tears. 
Proud flag of my country I ' tis transport to meet, 
Some smoke-colored heroe, who bled under thee; 
As he rushed after victory's blood- dripping feet, 
And grasped the wild laurel, that blossoms o'er the sea. 
Yes, yes, if there's one whom a 
nation should love, 
One high-minded man, whom e'en angels admire; 
It is he, who with spirit all flushed from above, 
With the rich loyal bloom of the -patriot's fire, 
Dares stand between danger and thee, all the hour, 
When the tyrant would tread on thy peace amid thy pride, 
And fling out the flag of Republican power— 
A 
glory to lighten—a 
beacon to guide

TAKE ME HOME TO DIE. 
By I. B. W OODBTJRY. 
This land is very bright, mother, 
The flowers are very fair, 
There's magic in the orange groves? 
And fragrance in the air ; 
But take me to my dear old home, 
Where the brook goes babbling by, 
Let us go back again, mother! 
OIL I 
take we home to die. 
Let my father's hand Lut rest, mother, 
In blessing on my head, 
Let my brothers and my sister dear, 
But throng around my bed ; 
Oh! let me feel that lov'd ones near, 
Receive my parting breath, 
When I 
bid you all good- night, mother, 
And sleep the sleep of death. 
These flowers their sweetest sweets afford, 
I 
scent their fragrant breath, 
But ere they bloom again, mother, 
I 
shall be cold in death ; 
Then take nie to my early home, 
No ro-es are so dear, 
As those that bloom upon the bush, 
To your old room so near. 
It will be blooming soon, mother, 
Then come, oh, let me go I 
Give me once more its roses, 
Before you lay me low ; 
You'll lay them on my grave, mother, 
Say, mother I 
will you not ? 
You'll lay me by the mossy bank— 
I've told you oft the spot, 
TAKE DIE HOME TO DIE. [CoNcLuDEDi 
'Tis close beside the church, mother, 
And when you kneel to pray, 
I'll listen to your words, mother, 
Though I 
am far away : 
You mit,t. not weep for we. mother, 
For I 
shall happy be, 
And though I 
cannot stay with you, 
Yet you shall come to me. 
Dear mother, I 
am weeping, 
I 
cannot stop the tears, 
They're swelling at the thought of home, 
And of in 
early years; 
But I 
am getting faint, mother, 
Oh I 
take me to your breast, 
And let me feel your lip, mother, 
But on may furollead press. 
There's dimness on my sight, mother— 
I 
cannot get my breath, 
Is it your sobs I 
hear, mother? 
Oh I 
tell me, is this death ? 
You'll tell my father how I 
yearned, 
Once more to see him near, 
You'll kiss my brothers each for me, 
They will forget, I 
fear. 
You'll tell my sistcrs— brothers dear, 
I 
have gone up on high : 
And if they are good children here, 
They'll see me when they die; 
I 
feel I'm going now, mother, 
One kiss ere life is riven, 
Farewell my own dear mother, 
Until we meet iu heaven.

MY SOUL IS DARR.: 
By C. E. Pumurs. 
My soul is dark— 
Oh ! quickly string the harp 
I 
yet can brook to hear, 
And let thy gentle fingers fling 
Its gentle murmurs o'er mine ear 
If in this heart a 
hope be dear, 
That sound shall charm it forth again ; 
If in these eves there lark a 
tear, 
'Twill flow, and et ase to burn toy brain, 
'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain. 
But bid the strains be wild and deep, 
And let thy notts of joy be first, 
I 
tell thee, minstrel, I 
must ‘N p, 
Or else this heavy heart will burst, 
For it bath been by sorrow nurs'd, 
And arch'd in sleepless silence long, 
And now ' tis doom'd to know th e worst, 
And break at once or yield to song, 
And break at once or yield to song.

'TWAS OFF TfIE BLUE cAltAturs. 
By J. M. 11unuarin. 
TiTY LAST CIGAR.. 
'Twits off the Blue Canaries, 
A 
glorCous summer day; 
I 
sat upon the quarter deck, 
And whiff'd my cares away. 
And as the volum'd smoke arose, 
Like incense in the air; 
I 
breath'd a 
sigh to think in Booth, 
It was my last Cigar. 
I 
leaned upon the quarter rail, 
And looked down in the sea; 
E'en there the purple wreath of smoke 
Was curling gracefully. 
Oh what hail I 
at such a 
time, 
To do with wasting care, 
Alas I 
the trembling tear proclaimed, 
It was my last Cigar. 
I 
watched the ashes as it came. 
Fast drawing toward the end— 
I 
watched as a 
friend would watch, 
Beside a 
dying friend. 
But still the flame crept slowly on, 
It vanished into air— 
I 
threw it from me, spare the tale— 
It was my last Cigar. 
I've seen the land of all I 
love, 
Fade in the distance dim— 
rye watched above the blighted heart, 
Where once proud hope bath been. 
But I've never known a 
sorrow, 
That could with that compare, 
When off the blue Canaries 
I 
smoked my last Cigar.

FACES. 
By M RS. M . 
A. 
K IDDER. 
There are faces at the window 
And faces at the door, 
And a 
multitude of faces 
We have never seen before ; 
in the cars and in the stages, 
In the lanes and in the street, 
But we soon forget the faces 
That we daily, hourly meet. 
There are faces pale and anxious, 
With many a 
line of care; 
And faces odd and devilish, 
And faces young and fair I 
Then the sweet and dimph d 
child- face 
Upon us brightly gleams, 
Like the faces of the angels 
That we meet with in our dreams I 
There are faces in the album, 
That strangers scarcely heed; 
These are faces of our loved ones, 
Whose lineaments they read. 
There is father, and dear mother. 
Who long have passed from view, 
And the faces of their children, 
'With the poor, dead baby's, too I 
There are faces in our memories, 
Pale faces of the past ; 
Some were photographed by sorrow, 
Some by love— and these will last. 
They will mingle with the faces 
That time about us paints, 
Until we ( if God so wills it) 
See the faces of the saints. 
SOMEBODY'S COMING. 
By 
J. 
C. 
ANDREWS. 
Somebody's coming, coming, coining, 
Somebody's coining, but I'll not tell who, 
His form it is manly, his features are fair, 
His dark flashing eyes and his glossy black hair: 
his voice is all music, enchanting to hear, 
And when I 
am with him, I've nothing to fear, 
D.) you wish me to tell you ; no, no you may guess, 
Yet somebody's coming never-the-less. 
Somebody whisper ;1
., 
whispered, whispered, 
Smuebode whispered, hut, I'll malt tell what, 
lie sail there were stars that shone in the heavens, 
That li ,tenetl to vows by true lovers given ; 
And a 
sweet little boy with a 
handful of darts, 
That mischievously play with poor maiden's hearts, 
Do you wish ine to tell you, no, no, you may guess, 
Yet somebody whispered, never-the-less. 
Somebody's going, going, going, 
Somebody's going, lint I'll not tell where, 
There's a 
neat little church on the hill side stands, 
Where somebody asked me to go mid join hands; 
He said that he loved we, and I 
must be his, 
Ai ) I 
what can I 
do then but answer him yes. 
Du you wish me to t-11 you ? no, no you may guess, 
Yet somebody's going-, never- the- less. 
LOVE THEE, DEAREST. 
Love thee, dearest, love thee! 
Yes by yonder star I 
swear, 
Which thro' tears above thee, 
Shines so sadly f 
iir. 
Tho too oft dim, 
With tears like him, 
Like him my truth will shine; 
And love thee, dearest, love thee 
Yes—till death I'm thine. 
Leave thee, dearest, leave thee 
No—that st7:r is not more true; 
When my vows deceivi, thee, 
lie will wander too. 
A cloud of night 
May veil his light, 
And death shall darken mine, 
But leave thee, &tear t:s , leave thee I 
No— till death lit, thine.

I WANDER'D BY THE BROOKSIDE. 
By 
HINE. 
I 
wander'd by the brookside, 
I 
wander'd by the mill ; 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy wheel was still : 
There was no sound of grasshopper, 
Nor chirp of any bird, 
But the hearing of my own heart 
Was all tIm sound I 
heard. 
I 
sat beneath the elm tree, 
I 
watehe I 
the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer, 
I 
did not feel afraid ; 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word [ But the beating,&c. 
He came not, alm no ! he came not, 
The night came on alone, 
The little stars sat one by one, 
Each on his golden throne, 
The ev'ning air pss'd by my cheek, [ ctc. 
The leaves above were aired [But the beating, 
Fast silent tears were flowing, 
When something stood behind, 
A hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We did not speak one word, 
For the beating, ctn. 
 OS' 
OUR OWN SWEET THOUGHTS. 
Our own sweet thoughts they come and go, 
Like angel visits to the soul ; 
They round our hearts in gladness flow, 
And all our acts control ; 
They mem .ries bring of early days, 
Of childhood's lov'd and gentle hours, 
When life was young and all our ways, 
Were strewn with buds and flow'rs. 
Our own sweet thoughts we only share 
With those we love and love to bless; 
We breathe them only when and where 
They fall on tenderness ; 
They are to us of far more worth 
Than glit.Cring gems of purest ray ; 
Time dearest timings of all on earth, 
Our own sweet thoughts to-day. 
BOBBIN' AROUND. 
By W . 
J. 
FLORENCE. 
In August last, on one fine. day, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
When Josh and I 
went to make hay, 
We went a 
bobbing around. 
Says Josh to me, let's take a 
walk, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
Then we can have a 
private talk, 
As we go bobbing around. 
We walked along to the mountain ridge, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
Till wit got near Squire Slipshod's bridge, 
As we went a 
bobbing around. 
Then Josh and I 
went on a 
spree, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
And I 
kissed Josh and Josh kissed me, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh's pluck no longer tarri'd, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
Says he, dear Patience, let's get marri'd, 
Then we'll go bobbing around. 
Now I 
knew he lov'd another gal, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
They call'd her long 
crook'd shin'd, curly-toothed Sal 
When we went bobbing around. 
So after we got into church, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
I 
cut and left Josh in the lurch, 
Then he went bobbing around. 
Now all you chaps what's got a 
gal 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
Do think of long legg'd, emoted shin, curly-toothed Sal 
When you go bobbing around.

ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Perhaps fn business you've been wronged 
By some " defaulting rogue," 
For by such scamps the world is thronged, 
They long have been in vogue; 
Don't seek revenge on such a 
wretch, 
But to forgive him try, 
And thus you " do to others, as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
Cuouus.—Then " bear good will to all men,' 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
If you are rich, and some " old friend." 
Is " down at heel" and poor, 
Well, let the bar of station bend, 
And " open wide your door" 
To welcome him, as you were wont 
"In better days gone by," 
And thus you do to him, poor man, 
As " you'd wish to be done by." 
Cnoacs.—Then " bear good will to all intl," 
It's easy if vou try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
I 
think by what I've said or sung, 
In this my song to-night, 
That I 
have proved to every ono 
The glorious might of right. 
So let us all make this resolve, 
And keep it till we die, 
That is to " do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
Cnonus.—Then " bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by."

Say not this heart can alter, 
Think not. Ow' now we sever, 
can forget thee ever. 
What'er our darlening fate may be; 
While life .s 
last accents falter, 
Yet will I 
pray for thee. 
I'll pray for thee, 
I'll bless and pray for thee. 
Here tho' the hope forsake toe. 
Which that poor heart so treasnred, 
Soon a- ill its hours be measur'd 
And pitying heaven my sorrows see, 
Soon to its refuge take me, 
And there I'll pray for thee 
I'll pray,-.1... 
WHERE SHALL THE LOVER REST. 
By W ALTER SCOTT. 
Where shall the lover rest, 
Whom the fates sever 
From his true maiden's breast, 
Parted for ever ? 
Where, through groves deep and high, 
Sounds the far billow ; 
Where early violets die, 
Under the willow : 
Eleuloro, dze. there shall be his pillow. 
There through the summer day, 
Cool streams are laving, 
There, while the tempests sway, 
Scarce are boughs waving; 
There thy rest shalt thou take, 
Parted for ever, 
Never again to wake, 
Never, 0 
never, 
Eleuloro, dr.c. Never, 0 
never. 
Where shall the traitor rest, 
He the deceiver, 
Who could win maiden's breast, 
Ruin and leave her ? 
In the lost battle, 
Borne down by the flying, 
Where mingles war's rattle 
With groans of the dying, 
Eleuloro, &e. there shall he be lying. 
Her wing shall the eagle flap 
O'er the false-hearted, 
His warm blood the wolf shall lap 
Ere life be parted, 
Shame and dishonor sit 
By his grave ever; 
Blessing,s shall hallow it, 
Never, 0 never: 
Benham, &c. Never, 0 
never.
