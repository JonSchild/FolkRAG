VERNON DAHMER JR.: You’re welcome. 
EC: Mr. Dahmer, could you tell us when and where you were born and about 
your family history? 
VD: Yes. I was born in the Kelly Settlement community, about five miles 
north of Hattiesburg, here where we are today, in August 27, 1929.

AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: Tell me about your family. 
VD: Okay. My dad, Vernon F. Dahmer Sr., was one of twelve children born to 
George Dahmer and Ellen Kelly Dahmer. He was the youngest of twelve kids, six boys 
and six girls. One of the boys died as an infant so that left a family really of five boys 
and six girls. Being the way segregation was back in that day, discrimination, and the 
oppressive situation for blacks in Mississippi, and where the black race had very little 
defense from law enforcement, my grandfather made a conscious effort to make sure that 
his six female daughters had the opportunity to leave the state of Mississippi at a very 
young age. This was for their own protection, because it was pretty obvious at that time 
that the white male, he treated the black male as—however he wanted to. My grandfather, 
he saw this, being raised, born and raised, in Mississippi. And likewise, the male sons, 
all except my father who was the youngest boy, they left the state also and went north. 
EC : So your father’s the only one. 
VD: My father was the only one to remain here, and since he was a baby boy, I 
would imagine he was the closest to the parent, you know, being the baby. And he 
worked on a farm, and he made a decision to remain and not leave this state. The older 
males went ahead and assimilated into the society in Chicago and those places where they 
were identified as Caucasians, which is fine, because you were going looking for a better 
life, and I don’t fault them at all about that. It’s a situation where if you don’t ask, you 
don’t tell. So he was not asked because well, because all of them are very, very light- 
complected and just right off the bat, they look like whites. So, the assimilation was not 
that difficult, and they were very fortunate in landing good employment. The females, all 
of them went north and they married African American men and black men. 
2 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC : It’s interesting that the—. 
VD: Yes, it was. 
EC: Do you have a speculation about why the women did one thing and the 
men did something different? 
VD: No, I don’t. 
EC: Yeah. 
VD: Probably realizing and being raised in the South, it was probably find it 
easier to find a suitable black man [5:00] to marry. Not being closely affiliated with the 
white males in Mississippi, they’d feel comfortable being in a black environment. I 
would just imagine that was the reason why. And the same applied to men. When I went 
in the military in 1951, being raised in [an] all-black community, I never really had no 
desire to pass for any other race than being African American. I was married to a dark- 
skinned African American woman, and I was very comfortable. 
EC: Did the men who assimilated, did they stay in touch with the family? 
VD: Yes. Yes, they did. They’d come and visit, and on occasion, they would— 
one or maybe two of them—would bring their wives, their white wives, with them. And 
that was not hard to do at that time because due to the complexion of the family, and 
there were other mixed races in the community. To tell you the truth, there was quite a 
few of us coming out of slavery. So anytime a white person saw a light-skinned person 
with a dark-skinned person, it was automatically assumed that they were all Negroes 
because you had a lot of mulattos around. And that came out of slavery, as we saw the 
mixing of the races by the slave master and his family. 
EC: So that when they come here, it’s almost like the whites are passing. 
3 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: Yeah. And they felt comfortable, you know? 
EC: Yeah, good. 
VD: In moving around. I never saw any anxiety, but being a little boy, I didn’t 
pay any attention anyway. 
EC: Yeah, they were just people visiting. Yeah. 
VD: Right. 
EC: My senses are I have been told by some people that Kelly Settlement and 
some of the other areas, as you were saying a lot of mixed-race people, that there was a 
sense, at least among some people, being kind of in-between, that they didn’t really 
identify—. You’ve been saying you identify with the black community, but I’ve heard 
some people say that they didn’t identify one or another, that they sort of had an 
independence. Are you aware of that? 
VD: It could have happened. It could have happened, but coming out of a 
family where I never saw any racial separation or division, my grandparents and my 
parents always treated everybody the same, my school was all black, my church was all 
black. Consequently, I didn’t have any notions about going over to the other race or 
being maybe out of place. I felt very comfortable being black, and likewise today, and 
went through the military feeling that way. Black and from Mississippi. “Oh no, you’re 
not.” “Oh, yes I am.” [Laughter] I’m not making this up. It’s just the way it was. 
EC: “You’re not going to change who I am,” right? 
VD: Oh, no, no, no, no. No. And I saw that coming out of my family. My 
grandfather, George Dahmer, which you probably ought to [have] heard of this, he was 
white. He was thoroughbred white. His mother was white and his dad was a German, 
4 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
Peter Dahmer, from Darmstadt, Germany. I spent a lot of time there in the military. And 
he was white, and my grandfather’s mother was born out of wedlock, Laura Barnes, and 
she was placed with a mulatto woman to raise. And while being there with the mulatto 
lady who was a Barnes because you carried the slave name and all, this mulatto lady was 
running a boarding house up in Covington County, about twenty-five miles from here, 
and that’s where my dad’s—my grandfather’s—mother lived and worked. And then, the 
Dahmer family—. 
EC: So he was raised in that—. 
VD: Sure, the Dahmer family migrated from Germany because of economic 
conditions over there, and there’s like five of those brothers. And one of the older 
brothers settled there in the area and he became acquainted with my grandfather’s 
mother, and they had a child. And then later on, my grandfather, George Dahmer, grew 
up in that environment, and his mother Laura, she hired this black guy, Charlie Craft, to 
work for her in a business, and I think she ran a boarding house for the woodcutters and 
all also, eventually. [10:00] Then, she married an ex-slave, Charlie Craft. They went on 
to have nine mixed-race kids. My grandfather, George Dahmer, he was the oldest son. 
Yeah, he was the oldest son in that mixed-race family. Now, when they got married, 
even though Laura, my grandfather’s mother, was assumed to be mulatto because she had 
been raised up in a mulatto family, it was okay as long as she was unmarried. She 
married Charlie Craft, started having kids. Then, those white in that area say, “Hey, no. 
Uh-uh. This, we don’t go.” 
EC: Right. It’s okay for them to be together, but not for them to be married. 
5 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: Right, and to have kids. And they started that, okay? And then they had 
to leave from there and move down and commute to where we live. 
EC: And why was it okay for them to be in Kelly Settlement? 
VD: Because there were a lot of mulattos there, the Kelly family, which my 
grandmother came out of, my dad’s mother, Ellen Kelly Dahmer. And by the way, her 
mother was also white. She was bom out of wedlock and she was put with a black 
family, McComb family, to be raised, and that’s how she met up with my grandmother 
Ellen Kelly’s dad, Warren Kelly, okay? Because there were two, a mulatto and a white. 
EC: That’s interesting. 
VD: So that’s why he got this real light complexion, but there were other 
families out in our community likewise: the Wilson family, Eaton family. At one time, 
our family was identified as kind of a slang, “That’s where all the white Negroes live.” 
EC: We talked to Mrs. Smith earlier today and she said she was called that, a 
“white Negro.” 
VD: Mrs.—. Which one? 
EC: Jeannette. 
VD: Oh, Jeannette! I know. Yeah, Jeannette. Sure. 
EC: Yeah. She said she had that same name given—. 
VD: Right. Yeah, but she was from up around Soso, Mississippi. 
EC: Yeah. That’s what she was—. 
VD: Yeah, she was a Musgrove. I know of them. 
EC: Telling—. Yeah. 
VD: Lot of mixed-race kids. 
6 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: You know, the part of Mississippi Fm from, there were a few individuals, 
but not the families like this that I was aware of growing up in the community. 
Hattiesburg seems, this area—. Is that true? Did Hattiesburg have more mixed-race 
families? 
VD: Well, I have nothing to compare it with, but we had a lot of them, a lot of 
them, sure. 
EC: Can you tell me what it was like growing up? You had a farm, your 
family farm. 
VD: Right. 
EC: Can you tell us about that? 
VD: Yes. My dad, being the youngest son, and actually involved in farming, 
that was his first occupation, being that with my grandfather George, they owned several 
hundred acres of land. And he was a very, very successful farmer. And having to raise 
twelve kids on his farm, you had to be good to feed them because there were no public 
service jobs out [there] and their families really lived on mostly what they raised on the 
farm. [Coughs] Pardon me. Consequently, my dad saw this as just a normal way of life, 
and he liked it, and he became a landowner after he married my mother. And my 
mother’s from the same community, and my grandfather gave him a little land to start 
and then he went on and acquired his own land, but it was adjourning properties. My dad 
became successful in the business and early, I would say in the mid-1930s—. My dad was 
born in 1908, and by that time, he was like twenty-six, twenty-seven years old. He 
bought a school bus because the days of segregated schools, the black kids had to have 
transportation, so the white school system loosened up and allowed independent 
7 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
individuals to go buy a bus to transport black kids to and from school. So what that did, 
my dad bought the school bus and that put him earning more income to supplement the 
family. 
EC: So if he bought it, they would pay him to drive it? 
VD: And he leased his services and the bus to the county and they would pay 
him for his time. And in the meantime, when he’d get the—. 
EC: So he both simultaneously earned something and get his kids to school. 
VD: Right, and not only that, by buying a bus, he had the opportunity to 
provide public service to other people in the community, or organizations or whatever, 
because during that time, it was coming out that the person has very little personal 
transportation around. So he’d haul people to Sunday school [15:00] conventions, church 
conventions or where—basketball games—which supplemented his income. And he 
continued to do that until 1940, and I remember these days because at that time, you 
know, I’m bom twen—. I was like eleven years old, oldest kid, of eight kids. 
EC: You had a lot of responsibility, I imagine. 
VD: Yes, I grew up with a big responsibility and my dad and all the farmers in 
the area, this whole area, they were using animals to farm. Mechanization had not yet 
arrived in this area, not to an extent to where it was noticeable in the family farm. 
Consequently, my dad, in 1940, the war was starting in Europe, as you well know. And 
Camp Shelby is just south of here, about fifteen miles, and it [was] one of the major 
training camps and it started to grow to provide, what, soldiers to go off and fight the war 
in different locations. That created jobs because the camp had to grow to do this. That 
means black folks that were living on the farm had a chance to leave the farm—not leave 
8 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
the farm, go and work to supplement their farm income, okay? So what dad did then, he 
saw an opportunity with that extra money to go and buy him a new tractor. 
EC: So he used the income from working Camp Shelby or—? 
VD: No, he used the income from—. He used the improvement in the economy. 
EC: Got it. 
VD: Okay? 
EC: Right. 
VD: To bring more money into the community, and he had more activity with 
what he had already going on, and he was using his bus to transport people to and from 
Camp Shelby to work and all. So what he decided, took that extra money and bought 
him a tractor, and all of the implements that goes along to do his—run his—farming 
operation. 
EC: He would have been really in the forefront of that. 
VD: He was in the forefront. He was the only guy in the neighborhood, white 
or black, that had a tractor, as far as we know, definitely with black folks. And when he 
bought the tractor, well the other farmers in the area were using mules and horses, and by 
my dad having a tractor, he could cultivate more land and he expanded his farm, plus we 
used the tractor to assist other farmers in work that they needed to move them forward. 
And then around 1942 when the war was really moving along, and the black community 
had money coming in, my dad said, “Hey, now’s the time to open a grocery store.” [EC 
laughs] So he opened a grocery store adjacent to the house and—. 
EC: He was really a very savvy businessperson. 
9 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: He was a mover and a shaker. Only had a tenth-grade education, but he’d 
take chances that I would’ve balked at. [EC laughs] But being raised the way he was, in 
a progressive home, my grandfather was not openly that progressive but he was a mover 
and a shaker by him having the land that he had and the success that he had. And not 
only that, my grandfather and my dad were very close friends, too. They worked in 
partnership. But by that time, my grandfather’s getting up in age and the farming now is 
moving toward my dad and his family, us boys. 
EC: So he’s taking more responsibility. 
VD: Right. He’s taking on more responsibility. Consequently, my dad built a 
grocery store, country grocery store. And in that country grocery store in the black 
neighborhood, he also attracted some white customers, and the grocery store was fully 
equipped with everything going in, canned goods, and very little electricity in that area at 
that time. A lot of people living in the country had iceboxes and they used block ice for 
special treats. So, he built a little icehouse [EC laughs] right next to the grocery store. 
EC: Where would he get the ice? 
VD: We bought it down in Hattiesburg from the wholesaler that sold it to 
restaurants and all. And one of my jobs was to take that school bus and go down and 
hauled in three-hundred-pound blocks of ice and deliver them on a Friday, and bring 
them, put them in the icehouse, and chip them into fifty- and twenty-five-pound blocks. 
[Laughter] So that was one of my jobs, and being in the summertime, I didn’t mind it too 
much, but he—. The icehouse was built homemade, with sawdust in the side as 
insulation, sawdust in the bottom. It was quite cool. 
EC: How did he know how to do that? He just—? 
10 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: Smart guy. That’s all I can say. 
EC: So did you all, did you help build? 
VD: No. Well now, at that time, I was only about fourteen, fifteen years old, 
going to school. My interest wasn’t—. Hey, Fm doing what Fm being told to do, okay? 
[Laughter] And Fm doing what Fm being told to do too, without any question, okay? 
[Laughter] 
EC: You weren’t a rebellious—. 
VD: And not only that, by being out in the forefront [20:00] and I was kind of 
comparing, you know, “Boys, Fm doing this. I can drive a tractor. You can’t.” 
EC: Right. 
VD: And you got that—. 
EC: “You’ve got a mule.” 
VD: “You found a mule,” so I felt real good about who I was. But it never did 
feel like, there was never that atmosphere of you were better than somebody else. That 
just never crept into the picture because I saw my family just maintaining like they 
always were. 
EC: Did your family talk to you all about that or was it just how they acted? 
VD: No, no, no. No, no. It’s how they acted. Go to black Sunday school, 
everything you do is black. Segregation kept us what? It kept us together. In a way, 
integration really affected our unity. There’s no doubt about that. 
EC: You didn’t have a choice before about being—. 
VD: We depending on one another. 
EC: And having the same, people couldn’t escape it. 
11 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: No, and you couldn’t escape it. Now, if you stepped outside of your 
boundary, you were in deep trouble. Right? And what you did, you learned to—you 
didn’t learn—you were just comfortable in an environment because you do nothing else. 
EC: Yeah. So you were growing up. So you were working on the farm. 
VD: I worked on the farm. I started out working on the farm as soon as I was 
big enough—. 
EC: And then the ice—. 
VD: Feeding the hogs and chickens, went into the grocery business. I learned 
how to cut meat. We butchered our own cattle in most cases. And then, around 1945, 
now my dad had a grocery business going on. We had a school bus business and we had 
the farm, and my dad is having all these boys in a row, see. 
EC : And that’s good labor at that point. 
VD: And hey, well [it’s] in-house labor. 
EC: [Laughs] What kind of salary were you getting? 
VD: Hey, sleep—. 
EC: Room and board? [Laughs] 
VD: Room and board, that’s the word I was looking for. That’s right. Right. 
Room and board, and a little spending money on the weekend, which was not very much, 
either. 
EC: Did you get—? Did you have candy? Did you get spending, penny candy 
at the store? 
VD: Oh, yeah. You could do that, but you had to watch it. We were very 
disciplined, but you still steal a little bit every now and then. You know how that goes. 
12 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
Boys can be boys. And then around 1945 when the war effort was really moving in 
Europe and in the Pacific area, there was more money coming into Hattiesburg, more 
black folks being employed to supplement their income. So, my dad went off and bought 
a sawmill, a small sawmill, because we had a lot of land, had a lot of timber and all. And 
first, he started cutting his own timber and he had a little—had two guys that he worked 
with that had experience. And then, there we were, so we started in, what, cutting logs 
and cutting lumber, for sale in the neighborhood, and the other folks heard about it. And 
first thing I know, the log business is starting to flourish and dad was selling his lumber 
to local farmers or whoever to build barns and chicken houses and outhouses. So, we had 
three areas of income going on. 
EC: When we spoke with your mothe—well, Mrs. Dahmer—she told me that 
you father knew which trees the boards came from in the house that was burned down. 
VD: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure. 
EC : When was that house built? 
VD: I was away in the military and it had to be built probably in the early 
sixties or late fifties. I don’t remember. 
EC: So did you grow up in that same spot where the house is now? 
VD: Oh, yes. I grew up there in that same—. 
EC: So it was a new—? 
VD: It was a new house firebombing had destroyed, which was a new house 
that they were lived into when the firebombing took place. 
EC: So they had already had one destroyed? 
VD: Well, no. The house I grew up in was the old original home. 
13 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC : That’s what I was wondering about. 
VD: And then they built a new home after my dad married my stepmother, 
Ellen, but she’s been in the family. She’s our mother. She’s been in the family sixty¬ 
something years. 
EC : So she’s been your mother sixty years? 
VD: Oh, yeah. And she’s a real fine lady, and everything worked out fine. My 
dad and mom, they married 1928 and they divorced about 1935. My dad had the three 
boys by her, so we got three sets of kids: three by my mother, three by another. The 
second wife, she died at thirty-one years old. It was some kind of muscular disease. And 
then, he married the existing mother in 1952. I had been married then one year. My kids 
are the same age or older than—. 
EC : Than your youngest—. 
VD: Yeah, sure. 
EC: Yeah. So let me just ask you one more. So in 1935, so I’m trying to—. So 
you were about six years old? 
VD: I was six years old, yeah. 
EC: So did you have a relationship with your [25:00] mother after they 
divorced? 
VD: Yeah, for about two or two and a half years because her family only lived 
about three miles from where we lived. All in the same community. And my mother 
took the baby boy with her to live with the grandparents, and my dad kept the two older 
kids, my brother and I, because we—. He didn’t have no money to pay child support. He 
told me the jury said, “You keep them and feed them.” [Laughter] He didn’t talk about 
14 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
that because my mom, my mother, my maternal mother, my dad had a beautiful 
relationship [with], I never heard either one of them talk bad about the other, even after 
they divorced, which I definitely appreciated when I grew up. It doesn’t make sense. 
EC: Right, yeah. That’s not always the case. 
VD: Right. So my mom took the baby, and my dad then took us and he didn’t 
dump us on our grandparents who lived nearby. 
EC : I wondered because—. 
VD: No, he did not. He kept us right there in the house with him, and then we 
visited grandparents as needed, and he had other older ladies in the family because 
people—. Jobs were scarce. Depression in 1929, we still in Depression. They’d come 
and cook, and clean, and my dad would pay them or whatever, and they were older 
ladies, family. And that worked out well until he married again in 1938, and he married 
there and they went on to have three sons by that wife, and she died in 1949. She had 
three boys. So, there we are again in the house with my dad, five boys and no mom. 
Right. So, but I grew up with that wife. 
EC: So she was in many ways your mother? 
VD: Right, in many ways—. 
EC: The one person—. 
VD: But having one baby right after another, because she was a younger 
woman. 
EC : She’s pretty busy. 
VD: She’s busy, yeah, but that’s okay. We had a lady in the house and it 
worked out fine. 
15 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: Were you happy to have a lady in the house? 
VD: Right. But then again, us boys, five boys, ended up then with older ladies 
coming in and cooking and cleaning. So, we were raised a lot without a mother, and our 
dad met the need for both. You know, he was a busy man. We were always a part of his 
life; part of his life in working, part of his life in social activities, part of his life in play. 
He didn’t ever have to take out time for us. 
EC: It was just everything you did was as a family? 
VD: Everything, we were together. We’d work all day and go to the river—our 
property run adjacent to the river—and go in swimming. He’d beat us in the water. [EC 
laughs] He was just that kind of guy, and I’m not making this up. If you all talk to any of 
my brothers, our dad was the focal point of our life. It doesn’t mean that we didn’t 
appreciate the grandparents and the other ladies that came through the family, but he was 
with us. 
EC : He was your parent? 
VD: We didn’t miss any fairs, any circuses, and things like that. 
EC: That must have been a really remarkable childhood to—. 
VD: It was. 
EC: The combination of the work and then also the— 
VD: Yes, it was. 
EC: Opportunities. 
VD: Yes, it was. And then what that did, by having—this is my own personal— 
by having to focus mostly on one family person, like your father, who was very involved 
in our life, it created an unusual unity in cooperating amongst us. My dad was the leader. 
16 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
He was the boss, but he wasn’t bossy, but he was a disciplinarian. Consequently, we all 
danced by the same music. What I mean by that, we all followed the same group of 
orders and there were no, any confusion being “what Mom said,” “what Dad said.” 
Everything coming from one direction. And I learned this over time in raising my own 
kids. Consequently, we bonded. Us boys, hey. I mean, the bond even exists today. 
EC: You all are very close? 
VD: And I’ve lost three brothers, but hey. 
EC: Yeah. 
VD: If you mess with one, you mess with the whole crowd. But we always got 
along real well. We didn’t fight. We argued. We competed, but we got along real well, 
and to some extent, our wives didn’t quite understand. [Laughter] 
EC: They couldn’t compete with your brothers? [Laughter] 
VD: That was a fact, but it worked out good, you know? 
EC: Yeah. What was your schooling like? 
VD: Going to a country school, and the school was like only within a half a 
mile from the [30:00] house. We walked to school. 
EC: Did your family provide the property for the school? 
VD: Yes. My great-grandfather, Warren Kelly, provided the property. He 
gave the school—. He gave one—two—acres, by the way, to build a school building on. 
And that was my grandmother, Ellen Kelly’s, father, Warren Kelly. And he was a 
descendant of Green Kelly, slave master, and his African mistress, Sarah. He was a 
mixed-race kid, and that put him in line with family connections and he came out of that 
environment owning quite a bit of property. And what he did, he used his property to 
17 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
build the first church on, and the first school, and just kind of structured the community 
around it. Now, you had other families that came in starting to build with that same 
attitude, so this was not a one-man show, but he provided the land and worked with the 
school system, and the first school was opened in 1879. First school, but prior to then, 
they had school in the church—. 
EC: But that’s the first school building. 
VD: Which was built—. Yeah, first school building. Yes, ma’am. Now, the 
first school itself came out of the church which was built, was a log cabin. 
EC: What denomination was it? 
VD: Shady Grove, a Baptist church. 
EC: Was it built after the Civil War, do you know? 
VD: No, no. It was built in—. Well, the church itself was established in 1864. 
EC: Okay. That makes sense. 
VD: The Negroes and the blacks in that state, prior to that time, was going to a 
white church. You’ve probably heard that, have you? 
EC: Well, I don’t know about this particular community, but I know it was 
common. 
VD: Well, it did in our community. The whites, naturally they were subjects of 
the plantation owners, and they went to the local Baptist church, which was about four or 
five miles from where our church is, and they attended church there, and it’s the 
Providence Baptist Church. And it still didn’t exist in Soso when I was growing. 
EC: So is it a white church now? 
18 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: It’s a white church, yeah. Sure. Large church. And then the black church 
members established their church, the Shady Grove Baptist Church, and then Shady 
Grove came from the first church service they had was on the gro—under a shady tree. 
And the church we have there is right in the same place. The trees are gone, but the 
church is there. 
EC : That’s too bad about the trees. [Laughs] 
VD: Yeah. Yeah. And it was a one-room log cabin, and that one-room log 
cabin also served as the first school. 
EC: Where did the teachers come from? 
VD: Local. 
EC: Yeah. And so when you were go--. 
VD: When I say local, it came out of the family. 
EC: Yeah. From the beginning, from when it was first founded? The first 
teachers were family members from back in the 1870s? 
VD: Right. 
EC: Where did they get their education in slavery? Or did they get it in the 
immediate aftermath? 
VD: That’s a good question. 
EC: Yeah. That’s not part of the family history? 
VD: It was obvious that education and religion was the avenue out of slavery 
because if the first thing you’re going to do is build a church, then the second thing 
you’re going to do as a freed slave is to build a school. You learn something from being 
what, enslaved, because you saw that going on around you. So rather than go out and do 
19 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
something differently, what you do is you repeat what you’ve already seen. Even though 
you may not have been a part of the building, you were a part of, what, of the success. 
EC: Yeah. You know what freedom—. 
VD: Right. And my great-grandfather, Warren Kelly, he educated his kids, and 
when my grandfather, George Dahmer, wanted to marry Ellen, “No. Boy, where’s your 
education?” And he would not permit it until, what, until my grandfather went to 
Jackson State and improved his education because that’s where my grandmother Ellen 
Kelly had gone. So there was enough education at that time coming right out of slavery. 
Well, let’s put it, there was enough forethought about education that provided [35:00] 
people who had enough to teach. 
EC: Well, there were always people that found ways to learn. 
VD: Found ways to learn. Right, right. 
EC: Even when there was a law saying you couldn’t. 
VD: Right. 
EC: So your grandfather, George Dahmer, went to Jackson State for a while? 
VD: Yes, he did. 
EC: Okay. And your father went through tenth grade? 
VD: He went through tenth grade in a local community school, Bay Springs 
school. 
EC: That was probably the last grade they had. 
VD: At that time, it was the last grade, and as the population increased and 
decreased, it would go from ten to twelve, back to ten, to twelve. And at the time, my 
dad was going to tenth grade. By the time I graduated in 1948, it was twelfth grade. 
20 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: So what was--? So you said that you went to the school about a half mile 
from your home. 
VD: Yes. 
EC: What was that school like? 
VD: Being in a community where you knew a lot of the kids, practically all of 
the kids, except the ones that are maybe in the outlying areas, it was more like a big 
family reunion. You knew everybody and it was a lot of fun, and you never felt out of 
place. And the teachers that we had blended right into that same environment, and it was 
a good atmosphere for learning because the education I have today, the basic education, 
what it is, and what you see, and what you hear, started right there. And coming out of a 
family, like many other black families too, by the way, they came prepared to learn. And 
my dad always had us saying—a lot of the other older guys Ed heard say this,—says, 
“Hey. Em not sending you to school to carry a lunch.” [Laughter] Because we didn’t 
have a lunchroom. “Hey, Eve got work here at the house for you to do.” So, going to 
school served two purposes: get an education, plus get out of a lot of hard work. 
[Laughter] So it didn’t lack a lot of motivation there. It didn’t take a lot of motivating to 
do it. And a whole lot of the kids, their families were not able to continue their 
education. We had a lot of dropouts, and that was—and as I look back, that was a sad 
thing. Where my family, and there was other families, allowed their kids to go on 
through and graduate. All of us graduated from high school. 
EC: Yeah. No, I know that Eve had many people tell me that they had to work 
so they couldn’t keep going to school. 
21 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: And I saw that with guys. You got to the fourth grade. By the time you 
made it to the fifth, the kids big enough to go to the fields and work, you start losing 
population. And by the time you got to the tenth or eleventh grade, my class only had 
eight people in it, and we started off with a big class in the primary. 
EC: Yeah. What were your favorite subjects? 
VD: I liked math. I liked reading, and math and reading—. English, I had 
difficulty with because I could never grasp the verb and the noun, and the pronoun. I 
could do those, but when you got over to the other parts—. 
EC: The subjunctive? [Laughs] 
VD: Yeah. F11 tell you that. And I kind of tuned it out because I figured I 
didn’t need it anyway. I found out later that I did, and so I had to go back and do some 
remedial study in order to move ahead. 
EC: You didn’t see any need for it? 
VD: Right. But those are my favorite and favorite subjects. And then later on, 
when I say later on, when I got to being about to fifth or sixth grade, we had spelling 
class where the kids get up before the class and the teacher would call your word, and 
you’d spell it. I fell in love with spelling, and the way it happened was my dad drove a 
school bus, and when he come to pick up the kids, spelling was the last class at the end of 
the day, and he would come to my classroom. And here I am up at the board, writing my 
spelling letters and the teacher would call them out, and my dad’s sitting there watching 
me misspell these words. [Laughter] So when we’d get home at night, he says, “Get that 
spelling book,” and we’d sit down in front of the fireplace, kerosene lamp, and he’d call 
me those words. And if I missed one, he’d bump me upside the head. And after a while, 
22 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
I got where I learned—and then I learned how to identify syllables, and then Fd do pretty 
well at that. So, that turned out to be—helped a lot. 
EC: Did you enjoy doing that with your dad or was it pressure? 
VD: No, I didn’t enjoy it. 
EC: It was pressure. [Laughter] 
VD: Nope, no I didn’t enjoy getting bumped upside the head, you know. 
EC: You have to learn how to act under pressure if you’re going to get—. 
VD: Right. That’s exactly right. But all in all, the school turned out well. I 
graduated on time, eighteen years old. 
EC: I’ve talked to a few people. I think they’re a little younger than you 
[40:00] and they went to different schools, but one person was telling me that she had a— 
she didn’t call it civics class. I can’t remember what she called it, but she said that the 
teacher actually talked to them about voting in their class. Did you ever have any kind 
of-? 
VD: Yes. Yes. I don’t want to miss that piece. Our principal was progressive. 
He was educated. He saw the need for education and—, I lost my thought. 
EC: I had asked you about voting, teachers and—. 
VD: Oh, yeah. Yeah. He saw the need for the education and he was really in 
tune with African American history, Negro history. I learned about Booker T. 
Washington early in those days, George Washington Carver, the Underground Railroad, 
and all of those things I learned right there in the 1940s. We had a little thin green black 
history book, and I went looking for one when I returned home, and it identified the 
prominent Negroes back in that day that had really made a difference in bringing us 
23 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
forward as far as education is concerned. And I tried to find it, and he acquired that 
book, and we had to—. It was a part of the curriculum in seventh and eighth grade. So, I 
had a real good feel of what blacks had done up to that period. Who invented the cotton 
gin, and things that came along in that era. 
EC: Did you have any sense of the politics behind that? 
VD: No. 
EC: Because of course—. 
VD: No.. 
EC: The white school district, I would imagine that your school had a black 
principal and then probably a white superintendent or something. 
VD: White superintendent. And the most of our textbooks came from the 
white schools because they passed their used textbooks down to the black schools. Right. 
Some would have pages missing. You’d see names of other kids in them, but they were 
books. 
EC: Did you think about that at the time, that you’re getting these secondhand 
books or anything? 
VD: No. No. No, I didn’t. 
EC: Did you have any sense of the white kids’ school, or did you have any 
contact with white kids? 
VD: The white school was only about two and a half, three miles away and 
they lived in another world. But now, their properties adjourned ours. We would see 
them. We knew them, but we went to separate schools. Everything was separate. 
Separate church and schools, separate theaters when you went to town and have a chance 
24 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
to go to the movie. We didn’t have any social interaction other than maybe we’d end up 
in a creek swimming on a hot summer day, and play just like nothing ever happened. I 
grew up with them, but socially we didn’t mix outside of that, no. 
EC: Yeah. I know you said that your dad’s store had white customers. 
VD: Had white customers, sure. 
EC: Did he ever have white people working on the land? 
VD: Yes. There were some poors in the community that were just so poor that 
they would come and they’d work in the cotton fields, pick cotton. I do remember they 
wouldn’t be mixed up. Say like maybe a part of the field, but not the distance away. A 
little segment here, blacks, and a little segment there, all adjoining, picking cotton 
together. Right. 
EC: Yeah. That’s a—. It’s just—. 
VD: But now, they were extremely poor white folks to do that. 
EC: And that they really, that they would have to have a pretty desperate need 
in order to go to work for a black family? 
VD: A very desperate need. Very desperate need, yes. But we didn’t look at 
them as being poor, just some white folks, coming to pick cotton. 
EC: Yeah, yeah. I mean, when you were working in the store when your dad 
had the store, were there ever any issues with white customers, or did things go pretty 
smoothly? 
VD: My dad had—not malicious, not—arguing and that. The white customers 
would come and take his goods and wouldn’t pay him because my dad could not make 
them pay. Back in that day, people didn’t walk around with credit cards, or cash money 
25 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
in their pocket. They’d buy groceries and put them on a charge book, and when they got 
paid, they’d come pay the bill and buy more stuff, and they’re living from week to week 
or payday to payday. Well, some of the white customers took advantage of my dad. Like 
there was this one guy, right after the war, came back. He was a vet and he got in good 
with my dad and he was paying his bill real well. My dad let him get too far out, and he 
owed my dad several hundred dollars and walked off. And by that time, I’m working in 
the grocery store. I’m a clerk, cutting meats, selling ice, pumping gas, fixing flats, 
whatever, and I was in tune with what was going on in the business. And my dad had a 
good business on Saturday, when country folks [45:00] come by to buy, oh he’d—. 
Money was everywhere—not everywhere. We had a lot of money. And after, you had to 
put it back into the business, but the business was good and growing, and you had them 
to do that. 
EC: What would—? Would your dad say anything about that? Did he talk to 
you or did he—? 
VD: No, he didn’t say it. 
EC: He just—. 
VD: Yeah, we had no distractions, like television. There was a lot of family 
conversation that went on in the presence of the kid, and my dad was open, and he said, 
“Yeah,” he said, “I let Sam have this, number one, and he won’t pay me.” And he’d be 
disappointed, and then he’d move on. And on the other hand, I saw my dad and I was a 
part of this. There were some families there, primarily black, not very many but so poor, 
they’d come to buy groceries and didn’t have enough, and they have kids. And when 
they arrived at the store, they’d sit on—you saw this picture of the store—sit on the porch. 
26 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
My dad would give them a drink and a Moon Pie, and that was their treat. Walked up 
there from way back in the woods some place, and then before they got ready to leave, 
they’d have a little grocery list. Most of them had the grandmother or somebody like 
that. He’d give them extra meat, just pass out stuff, and he just had an open heart. 
[Pause] And he got that from his dad. Excuse me. 
EC: No. I imagine that’s something you never, never lose. 
VD: No. Uh-uh. He got that from George Dahmer. My grandfather, George 
Dahmer, had enough property to where he had sharecroppers. You’ve probably heard 
that. And only a couple of families, but they were not servants. They’re people coming 
in, looking well, but make a living. They’d come from other communities, and he had a 
couple of rental houses, nothing—. Nobody had nothing fancy, and they’d move in and 
what we made, as far as edibles, greens, peas, you even had sugarcane, made our own 
syrup and all that. They were like a family. They participated in it. Nobody went 
hungry. 
EC: It was a more communal kind of—. 
VD: Right. But you maintain your independence, and you were respected as an 
individual, and there was a love relationship in that environment because those people 
appreciated so much until they loved him, and they’d give their all. He loved them back 
likewise, but never look down. Wasn’t a noisy man. Quiet, and would just—. We’d kill 
four or five hogs and have people come help us clean the hog and he’d be passing—not 
passing out—they could tell you what they want, and we’d share. Now, that sharing came 
out of that, to me, as I look back on it, and as I kept growing, it came out of that slave- 
type community where we had to depend on one another, and we knew that was the way 
27 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
we had to make it, and it carried right on over beyond that period, and it went right on in 
to the way my grandfather treated everyone. And my dad was raised with it, and that was 
part of life. And you know what? We do the same thing. I just did something that we’re 
pretty crazy about, a young—. I’m involved in the Scouts, helping kids and all this, and 
I’m not bragging or anything, and the kid’s dad died and his mother died. He was small, 
lived in the community, raised up there, and his dad was an older guy and the dad died 
and left him a little house and an acre of land. And the kid didn’t know any—he’s 
nineteen years and he had to pay taxes? Tax collector came out and took the property! 
The property’s adjoining my property that I own, and he said, “Do you want to buy it?” 
And I looked at him and I says to myself, “No, I don’t want to buy it.” I go to the tax 
collector. I say, “How much did this cost?” What does this guy pay for it, that bought it 
at the tax sale? And he told me—my relationship, our relationship’s so good with the 
citizens in this area—he told me everything. He said, “Tell you what, Vernon.” He said, 
“Go call him. Tell him you talked to me” and they paid, the property’s very little house 
on it, for fifteen thousand dollars. Well, I ain’t got no fifteen thousand dollars. But I got 
the guy down for nine hundred fifty dollars, okay? [EC laughs] So what did I do? 
[Coughs] Pardon me. My sinuses have been-forever. 
So, I got in cont—. [50:00] After I got in contact with the guy, then this investor 
said, “Well, I’ll finance it.” I said, “No. We’ll take care of that,” and I sent him a check 
for nine hundred and fifty bucks. Now, I’m not wealthy. Nine hundred and fifty dollars 
is a lot of money to me, but in the meantime, I said, “This kid was raised up in an 
environment where people learned there had to be no parental guidance. There was not 
none. It was not good enough for him to survive on his own, and so what? I got all the 
28 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
paperwork fixed up, made him a payment plan, and he’s going to pay me back in a year.” 
And I showed him how to pay your taxes, how to get your homestead exemption, trained 
like I trained my kids. And when I finished with him the other day, and got him all set 
up—and he works for my brother, Dennis, that you saw there, doing the sugarcane thing, 
cutting my mom’s yard. “Hey, we don’t throw you away,” and he’s going to be all right. 
He left the house, and my wife had some chicken. We ate, and he went out there with 
tears in his eyes. 
EC: I bet he did. 
VD: Yeah. 
EC: I mean, it’s like he lost his family and he has—. 
VD: Hey, and I didn’t go out— 
EC: Family in his village. 
VD: In the community. I can tell you, that’s not for publication. 
EC: Right. I understand. 
VD: No, that’s what we do. Sure. 
EC: You know, in Claiborne County, there was a man that had land and—. 
VD: You have to keep me on track, now. 
EC: Yeah. No, no, you’re good. And he wanted people to have houses, and so 
he sold people land at a price they couldn’t have bought it anywhere else, and they call it 
Jones Village out there now after him. 
VD: Is that right? 
EC: That’s right. 
VD : Where’s that at? 
29 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: It’s in Claiborne County. So, yeah. 
VD: Yeah, my doctor’s from over there. 
EC: Yeah. 
VD: Yeah, he passed away. 
EC: Yeah. So when you graduated from high school, what did you do next? 
VD: I enrolled at Tougaloo. Tougaloo’s expensive, but my cousin was going 
there, and his mother was a teacher. He could afford it. But I went anyway. [EC laughs] 
Went to Tougaloo and during the very first semester, I became seriously ill with 
pneumonia before testing time, and I was unable to make my tests. My dad had to come 
get me. By the time I recovered, we’d already gone into another semester, so I just 
stayed at home. I’m eighteen years old at that time, going on nineteen. Fma part of the 
workforce, so I went to work for the remaining part of the year and the next school year, I 
went to Alcorn. And went I got out to Alcorn, then the second wife, she took seriously 
ill, and then I had to come home and help in the business because things were not going 
good after World War II. It was in a recession during the early fifties, and I came home 
to help my dad and we buried her, and then I went back to Alcorn again. And by that 
time, I lost my deferment and that’s when the draft came and got me. [Laughter] So that 
ended my education, but I had a full year. 
EC: A full year? 
VD: Yeah. I had thirty-eight credits. That’s about it, isn’t it? 
EC: Let’s see. 
VD: Thirty-eight—. 
30 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: That’s about three semesters. Wait, let’s see. Thirty-eight credits, thirteen 
classes. Yeah. Yeah. Did you like—? Well, tell me what Alcorn was like. 
VD: Alcorn, I went there under a work program. And a lot of country kids, lot 
of kids from the country, and then there were some kids that were from upper-class black 
families, too, that went dressed every day. And then there was us kids, we came out the 
country. [EC laughs] So there was some adapting to do to that environment. And some 
of them came out of some schools—well, they came out of families who were, they were 
probably advanced in their educational abilities and all. But all in all, it was a big, big—. 
Back in the woods, and there were very few distractions, very few. 
EC: Counting crickets. [Laughs] 
VD: Counting crickets. That’s exactly right. And it was all about work, study, 
and sports, and I was not qualified to be on any of the teams, just go to some of them, and 
that was the extent of it. Very little time for girls, hardly none. [Laughter] Not only that 
they had a mistress there named Miss Tanner. She’d kill you, so. 
EC: Yeah, they had some strict rules, didn’t they? 
VD: Yes, very strict rules. You walked a girl to the dorm holding her hand, 
which that didn’t happen very often anyway, and when you got to the dorm at the end of 
that, no kissing, no hugging and all that. You better get from here. 
EC: [Laughs] And a curfew too, probably, for the girls. 
VD: Oh, definitely a curfew. Sure. 
EC: Was it for you too, or was it just for the girls? 
VD: Oh, it’s just for the girls, I would imagine. Well, I never—. They were—. 
I don’t know what they had. We didn’t interact that much except in the classroom. 
31 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: Yeah. Was there a big difference between Tougaloo and Alcorn? 
VD: Yeah. More affluent kids. Definitely more affluent; you could see it. 
[50:00] It was obvious. Yeah, I was more comfortable at Alcorn. Sure. Because they 
had more guys from rural communities, farming. I had a lot more in common, and being 
in a work program. 
EC: And Alcorn was an agricultural school. 
VD: And it was agricultural, and I was majoring in agriculture. That was my 
goal. 
EC: So that probably influenced—. 
VD: Right. It did influence. Most of my friends worked in a dairy because at 
that time, we had our own dairy, our own cattle, and all. Fortunately, I had a job inside 
mopping floors, and this was good. I liked it. [EC laughs] 
EC: When we were talking before we started taping, you mentioned about 
Tougaloo having white faculty. 
VD: Yes, I did. 
EC: What was that like for you? Did you think about it? 
VD: I was not overwhelmed by it because coming out of a community where 
there were a lot of light-skinned people, there was not this contrast of dark/white because 
I came out of a family and a community where there were just a lot of light-skinned folks. 
And the whites in our neighborhood, they interacted also. So, no, but it did surprise me 
to have white instructors, with all the black students. And there may have been a handful 
of white students there at that time. Let’s see if I remember correctly. It’s kind of hard to 
tell. 
32 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: That’s true. Yeah. 
VD: And the president was President Warren, and I think he was handicapped. 
I think he was. 
EC: Really? I don’t really know much about Tougaloo at that time. 
VD: Right. And a couple of my teachers were--one of them I know was— 
white. 
EC: Yeah. Were they from other parts of the country or were they local? 
VD: I don’t know. 
EC: You don’t know. 
VD: No, ma’am. I don’t know. 
EC: I had meant to ask you before. Was your father registered to vote when 
you were younger? 
VD: No. 
EC: Was he ever able to register? 
VD: No. 
EC: I know some people were registered, and then they took them off the rolls, 
and then they had to try to re-register. 
VD: No. No. My dad was very conscious of the fact that he was being denied 
the same ample opportunities as whites, and he didn’t hide that from us. He depended on 
them for survival, and he never did talk mean about them, but he let us know that there 
was a difference in survival. And he would tell us boys, he said, “You got to be twice as 
good to stay out of trouble. You’ve got to work twice as hard to get ahead. It’s not 
even.” And he let you know that up front, “It is not even.” And that helped a lot when I 
33 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
went in the Air Force because I felt a little inferior, because I figured these, the white kids 
went out of these superior schools. But after a while, I found out, well, yeah, they may 
have came out of superior institutions, but [Laughs] some of them weren’t no smarter 
than me. [Laughter] But, anyway, at least I didn’t think they were anyway. So, I lost my 
thought. 
EC: Well, I had asked you about your dad trying to vote. 
VD: Oh, yeah. So in growing up in that environment, my dad paid very close 
attention to what was going on around him, like my grandfather. We had a newspaper 
every day. We didn’t have electricity in the house up until I was probably in the eighth 
grade, and we studied by light, and my dad bought a small radio, RCA, one of them old- 
fashioned kind? And so he could listen to the news and other programs, and he would 
drive the school bus up to the window of the house and drew the power from the truck 
battery to run the radio. 
EC: And that’s how you’d listen to the radio? 
VD: And there were three things that he’d listen to religiously. One of them in 
the evenings, the six o’clock news with John Cameron Swayze, because he’d make us sit 
down and be quiet and hear the news. If you want to change that, sir, just let me know. 
John Bishop: Oh no, I’m fine. 
VD: Okay. And everybody, the news is on. He didn’t have to tell you. The 
news on, you be quiet and you listen. You didn’t leave the room. He listened to I Aim and 
Abner. They came on every day, if you ever heard of I Aim and Abner. 
EC: Uh-uh. 
34 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: Okay. That was a comedy show of hillbillies. [EC laughs] They came on 
every day, on I Aim and Abner and the Jot ’em Down Store in the country. And Amos ’n ' 
Andy at six o’clock in the evening. And on a Saturday night, he would listen to the 
Grand Ole Opry. 
EC: So that was the big [1:00:00] entertainment? 
VD: The big entertainment. 
EC: So you got news and a couple of shows. 
VD: Right. But as a result of paying attention and keeping up with the news, 
we all became news listeners. 
EC: He influenced you. 
VD: Influenced. And we found out that’s where you get your information 
from. My dad had another saying. Once we got big enough to understand what he’s 
talking about, he said, “Pay attention to what’s going on around you and you have a 
chance to get away without being a victim of your circumstances.” In other words, don’t 
be a victim of your environment because you’re not paying attention. And he had a 
parable he’d use, “Don’t be like a hog eating acorns under a big oak tree. You’re eating 
acorns but you never look up to see where they’re coming from, and one day when the 
acorns run out and you’re hungry, you’re left to starve to death. So, be aware of what’s 
going on around you.” And that’s just the way we all grew up. All of us are very 
political-oriented, okay? Very much so. So, we came up in a political environment. 
So when, in the mid-1940s, my dad had heard about that NAACP had started up. 
And he and eight other black men established the Forrest County branch of the NAACP. 
It was nine of them that started it, and they held secret meetings, and they went to the 
35 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
meetings at night. There are nine men, black men, in the Hattiesburg area that founded 
the Forrest County branch of the NAACP, and it was around 1945, the mid-1940s. And 
at that time, they had the meetings at night and my dad would always let us know, let me 
know, “Fm going to a NAACP meeting” because it was an underground-type 
organization during that time. And he continued to go to these meetings very religiously, 
and then when he’d go to the meeting, he would come home and we’d be working that 
day and he’d tell us, tell me and my older brother, what was going on as we did our work. 
And as a result of him being a part of that organization, and he let us know by just a 
conversation that there were—. It had something to do with politics. It had something to 
do with voting. So, in about 1946—yeah, I think I was around sixteen, seventeen years 
old, maybe—my dad started taking me with him, even before then, when he did business. 
I’d go with him when he paid the property tax, and at the same time he paid the property 
tax to the sheriff—sheriff was the tax collector in Forrest County—he would also pay his 
poll tax. And when he’d leave the sheriffs office, he’d go down the hall to the voter 
registration office and pay his poll tax. 
Well on this one occasion, he went to pay the poll tax. It may have been the first. 
I don’t know what happened prior to then. He went in. He pulled out his receipt he had 
in his hand, and there was this white man behind the counter, and he walked up and he 
asked—he knew who my dad was without a doubt, you know, being a country town— 
“Yeah, what do you want?” My dad said, “I paid my poll tax. I want to register.” And 
he looked at him, just kind of like stared at him, “Why are you here?” I remember that 
because Fm old enough now to know how you treat my dad. And he gave my dad a card, 
like a four-by-eight card, a six-by-eight, and it had some writing. He said on it, “Read 
36 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
that and tell me what it said,” then he went on back and sat down. And my dad read the 
information on the card and finally he says, “Sir, Fm finished,” and the guy came up and 
looked at him, and looked at me. He says, “All right, tell me what you read.” My dad 
told him. He says, “That’s not what it said.” And that was the end of it. 
Now, here’s a man, my father, who had helped me with my lesson, he was in 
business, he was running a business, and he couldn’t interpret what was on the card, and I 
was old enough to know that’s not true. That aggravated me some because what you did, 
you just denied a man that I care a lot about. Hey, you just told him, “You don’t know 
what you’re talking about.” That didn’t hit me very well. Now, I didn’t get mad about it, 
but I saw that as strange because I had never seen this upfront, that close. [1:05:00] Fm 
sure it’s happened other places. 
And from that time on, he may have continued. I didn’t go with him anymore, 
but I don’t know whether he did or did not. And the next time I heard anything about 
him becoming involved was when he became president of the local NAACP during the 
mid-fifties. And as a result of the Supreme Court ruling on the school segregation 
problem, was that Brown us. Board of Education in Kansas, something like that. I think 
that’s right. Mississippi then tightened up. It really tightened up. “Hey, we’re not going 
to have no school integration here.” Well, my dad’s already involved in NAACP by then, 
and he’s out of the closet. The organization is out of the closet. It’s well known. And 
then, that’s when he became targeted by the hostile forces out there. 
EC: After that first incident that you saw, or the one that you witnessed, did he- 
-when you were riding home that day—did he say anything to you? 
VD: No, he did not. 
37 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: Did he talk to you about what happened? 
VD: No, he did not. No. I think during that time, I can only think that that was 
such a routine practice of being denied. Maybe not to him so much, but he’d start going 
with other blacks. He’d just suck it up and move on. 
EC: Yeah. And you said when he was president in the mid-1950s, people 
knew who he was? 
VD: Oh, yeah, without a doubt. 
EC: And you said that’s when the harassment started? 
VD: Yeah. That’s when the harassment started, then. 
EC: Can you—? You probably weren’t home. 
VD: I wasn’t here but—. 
EC: But he told you about it? 
VD: He talked about it. Yeah, he talked about it. 
EC: Can you tell us what he said to you or what you know about it? 
VD: Yeah. During that time, the racial climate was changing. The tension was 
rising and this friendly atmosphere that we once had there was disappeared. Now, here’s 
how I experienced it. I went in the Air Force 1951. I came home around 1954, [19]55. 
At that time, after I had reenlisted, and chose the Air Force as a career and I was a Staff 
Sergeant. Did well doing my first enlistment. And I stopped at the local white grocery 
store that had been in the community before my dad built his because we had a 
relationship with the—with that family because that’s where we did our trading. And I 
stopped there to get some gas, and I went in with a real friendly atmosphere, and the wife 
of the storeowner, she was there, and I spoke to her. And they had one son, and he was 
38 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
several years younger than me, but I saw him grow up. So I ask her, I says, “Well, 
where’s your son?” I called him by his name, and [she] said, “You mean Mr. So-and-so.” 
Well, here I am now twenty-five years old, twenty-six, and she want me to call her son 
who’s probably still a teenager “mister.” Never saw that before. 
And I stopped at another grocery store in the community on down coming toward 
Hattiesburg where we would stop occasionally, and I went in there just to buy something, 
because I felt comfortable being at home. And the grocery store owner there, he said, 
“Oh, you’re in the—. You’re up north now!” I says, “Yes, I am.” I was stationed in 
Nebraska, Omaha, Offutt Air Force Base. And he says, “Well, what’s it like being up 
there? Are they different?” So he was quizzing me on my being outside of that 
Mississippi environment. 
EC: Have you been ruined? 
VD: And how had it affected me being in a more integrated area? And I picked 
up on that immediately. 
EC: He was wanting to know if you’d been ruined. [Laughs] 
VD: Whatnot. I’d been ruined. That’s exactly right. So, that’s how I knew 
then that the things that’s changing, and my dad then was getting into a situation, but I 
didn’t really focus on it because there had not been any open violence. It was just a rise 
in the recognition that things about to happen in Mississippi now that the masters don’t 
want to happen. And now where you’re not going to be treated quite as kindly and as 
friendly as it was because now, you’re starting to threaten “our way of life.” And I had to 
look back on it. I didn’t recognize it at that time. So what I did then was I didn’t go into 
these places. I just kind of stayed away from them. 
39 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: Yeah. Did your father [1:10:00] talk to you about the changing 
atmosphere or did you just know it from your own experience? 
VD: When I would visit home, he didn’t have to say it. It was obvious. And 
what I mean by obvious, he would—. For example, I came home with my family at that 
time, got a wife and couple kids, and we stayed there with him. And he says, “Hey, be 
careful where you go and you hear at nighttime, we don’t walk and get in front of 
windows. And also, we’ve seen some harassment here. There’s a gun in that room 
where you’re going to be. If you hear anything, hey, be aware of it.” Well, being 
military, that was no big deal, coming out from where we had guns. “Hey, that’s okay. 
I’m comfortable with that environment.” So I saw the difference happening then. 
EC: It’s a real change to have to take all those precautions. 
VD: To have to take all those precautions. That is exactly right. Sure. 
EC: Can you tell me about your own military experience? What happened 
when you got drafted? 
VD: What happened when I got drafted was it was during the height of the 
Korean War, and there was troops everywhere. And what I mean by “everywhere,” when 
you get into that military environment—. And I left home on a bus, went to Jackson along 
with some other recruits, went to the recruiting and the reporting place, and it was on a 
tri-state bus, a Greyhound, one or the other, and there were whites and black guys on 
there, and maybe some other passengers. I don’t remember exactly. But anyway, we got 
there and checked in. The day was far along. They gave us some food and took us to a 
motel. Well, there was no motel for whites and went out on Fairview Street. There was a 
black hotel down there. Well, I’d been on Fairview Street, so I’m all right. And the 
40 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
white ones, they went wherever they went, and the next morning, got up, and they picked 
us up in a bus and carried us to the induction center. And that’s when the processing took 
place, along stripping down, doing your physicals and all, and getting ready to ship us 
out. 
From there, the next day, we left and made it up—went to San Antonio, Texas to 
Lackland Air Force Base, which is a major Air Force training base. And, I mean, there 
were troops all over the place, and we were sleeping in tents because the permanent 
structures were all full. And we stayed there just, oh, about three weeks, and they keep 
us busy, the guys busy. Mostly, got up, dressed, do your military thing, and they would 
go out and pick up big rocks, put them in a pile. And then the next day, we would come 
along and we’d pick up the smaller ones, put them in piles. [Laughs] Just to keep you 
busy. You think I’m kidding! That’s a fact, all right? [Laughter] And then, during the 
night, they’d spread them all out again or whatever. All right? But anyway, you went 
through all that stuff, and I’m a man twenty-two years old, been working on a farm. 
“Yeah, I’m out here picking up rocks and I’m piling them up.” And then we went on a— 
shipped us out to Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas. That’s where I did 
my basic training. 
And from basic training, I was assigned to Francis E. Warren Air Base in 
Cheyenne, Wyoming, for my tech training. That was a Teletype training school there, 
along with other training facilities too in the communications field, and there was a mode 
of transportation for kids to learn how to drive trucks and stuff. 
EC: Let me ask you. So how did you feel about being drafted? 
41 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: I tried my best to stay out of it. My dad tried to get me deferred, and I 
didn’t want to go. No, I did not want to go, all because I just, I’m comfortable where I 
am. Yeah. 
EC: Yeah. What about, were you drafted specifically into the Air Force or did 
you have any say? 
VD: No, no, no. Oh, that’s a piece I missed. No. Let me tell you how that 
happened. 
EC: All right. 
VD: One, maybe a month, a little over, prior to going in the Air Force, I 
received a letter from the—they had a name—local board. 
EC: The draft board? 
VD: Draft board. Directing that I report for induction on the 15th of September, 
1951. And I looked at it, and I says, “Okay. Well, I’m getting ready to get out of here.” 
So I’m leaving the house with my dad, and I told him, I said, “Hey. This is what this is 
about.” So, I start preparing to go off to the Army because that’s where the guys were 
going. [1:15:00] My uncle, my dad’s baby sister’s husband, was in the 92nd Infantry in 
Italy, a ground foot soldier, fought. And I told him, and he said, “No, no. You don’t 
want to do that. Uh-uh.” Then, I had a couple of other black guys in the community that 
was in combat and he said, “Oh, you don’t want to do that.” He says, “Hey, go to the 
Navy or the Air Force. Don’t get caught up in this Army thing.” And after they told me 
that, I says, “Okay.” So, I procrastinated up until the 10th of September. [EC laughs] 
EC: You didn’t give yourself much—. 
42 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: No. And I said, “Look, I got to do--make up my mind.” So, I went to the 
Air Force recruiter here in Hattiesburg. It’s in the basement of the old post office 
downtown? 
EC: Yeah. 
VD: And I walked in, and there was an Air Force recruiter, Army recruiter, 
Navy recruiter, and Fm not sure whether they had a Marine or not. And I saw that Air 
Force, and I went in that door. And that sergeant, he said to me, “Can I help you?” And 
I told him, I said, “Fd like to volunteer for the Air Force.” So, he gave me some papers 
to fill out, and I took some tests or whatever, and he said, “Well, when do you want to 
leave?” I said, “Can I leave today?” [Laughter] He said, “No. The bus is already gone.” 
He said, “What about in the morning? Be down here at seven o’clock.” I said, “Okay, 
I’ll be here.” So, at seven o’clock, I reported to the post office, and they were there and 
they carried us down to the bus station, which is on Walnut Street, caught a bus out to 
Jackson. And so after I got situated at Sheppard Air Force Base in basic training, which 
is in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that was, by the way, in the early part of September of 
1951,1 was in my unit in my squad, drilling with them out on the parade field, going 
through my training. And in that group, there must’ve been about thirty guys in these 
squads. My name came out over the PA system, “Private Vernon Dahmer Jr., report to 
the orderly room.” I’m twenty-two years old. I’m in there with a bunch of guys 
eighteen, nineteen, maybe twenty. Fm kind of like the old dude. There were a few left 
over from World War II that was coming back again, but not very many. I don’t know 
what in my outfit, but anyway. I said, “Dang, what have I done now?” because Fm in 
43 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
this military environment now. Your name come out and you don’t remember anything 
that you did. “What have I done?” 
EC: Right. [Laughter] A little scary. 
VD: And so the squad leader called to a halt, dismissed me from the group, told 
me to report to the orderly room. I went to the orderly room, reported to the first 
sergeant. “These two gentlemen want to talk with you.” They were in civilian clothes. 
And they asked me, “Your name?” I told them, “Vernon F. Dahmer Jr.” “Let me see 
your dog tags.” Dog tags around my neck, pulled my dog tags out, and they check them. 
That’s who you are. He said, “You know, you’re a draft dodger.” “No, sir. I didn’t 
know that.” “Well, didn’t you get your notice from the local board?” Lying through my 
teeth, “No, sir.” [Laughter] I didn’t sign up for it. Lied, stood him flatfooted, and he 
says, “Well, you—. They sent you one.” I said, “No, sir. I never got it.” He said, “Well, 
okay. You’re already in now. I guess that’s all right.” Well, I guess it is all right. 
You’re going to take me out and put me in the Army? I wasn’t thinking that for him. 
I’m thinking that now. And, when he did that, boy, the perspiration dried up, and I got a 
hold of my nerves, and the first sergeant said, “All right, get back to your unit.” I went 
back to my unit. 
EC: Did you know that that might happen? Or did you just—? 
VD: No! I didn’t know that was going to happen, no. These guys flashed their 
badges on me, so they were from some kind of investigative unit. I don’t know whether 
they were the FBI, or the local Army investigators. You know, at Air Force, they have 
their own investigators. But no, they were federal. I know that, though. They had to be 
federal. 
44 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: That’s a little nerve-wracking. 
VD: Without a doubt. 
EC: And you came up with that on your feet. [Laughter] 
VD: Oh, hey. Well, you know, being twenty-two years old, you learn how to 
lie and you learn how to lie quick, especially when you get in a bind. 
EC: Sounds like it came in handy. 
VD: Yes, it did. 
EC: That’s a good skill, I guess. 
VD: Yeah, very good. It worked. 
EC: When you went into the military, how did you end up--? You said you 
went to the communications school for Teletype training. 
VD: Yeah, that’s—. 
EC: How did that come about? 
VD: That’s another phase that’s very interesting. I was assigned to Francis E. 
Warren Air Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming to become [1:20:00] a Teletype operator. 
Being raised on a farm—. Or, we had an old cash register my dad found somewhere and 
it was manual, and now you’re taking this farm boy who’s been used to driving trucks, 
hauling logs, running tractor, and all this. Yes, I had mechanical ability, operation-type, 
operating-type abilities, but not for no typewriter, no Teletype, no typewriter. And they 
assigned me to that school, and I started off, and after [I was] there for a while, I was in 
this typing class, “J-U-J, space, F-G-F, space,” and I’m telling myself, “I don’t want to be 
no Teletype operator. It just doesn’t fit me and my prior experience.” And across this 
great big open field—Wyoming’s big and everything is open—was a bunch of guys in 
45 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
training learning how to drive a truck with a trailer. Well, I knew how to do that. I could 
back a truckload of lumber down an alley. And Fm sitting there in front of a typewriter 
and I could go over there to that school, and I can go right through there and be a truck 
driver, and I don’t have to deal with this typewriter. 
Well, being the older guy in the community, I mean, in my squadron, I had a 
relationship somehow or another with the first sergeant. Been around a little bit, and I 
started to be his runner. He asked me, he said, “Dahmer. I need guys to carry messages 
from one outfit to another to the headquarters. Do you want to do that?” That’s during 
my off time when I got off in the evening. Well, Fm doing this remedial training, me and 
two other guys, training to catch up in the typing, and then I would do that in my off time 
thinking I may get a little something out of that. So during that time I was working with 
the first sergeant, things got real comfortable with my sergeant. I says, “Can I go in and 
talk to the captain? I want to go to over here to do that automotive training place, to that 
truck driving school.” And he said, “Man, they don’t need you doing that. You’re in 
Teletype.” 
Finally, one day, he said, “Okay.” He made an appointment with me to see the 
captain, and I got all dressed up and went in and reported to the captain, and gave him my 
experience, driving trucks, raised on a farm. And he’s sitting there with this nice little 
smile on his face, and I thought I was getting over on him [EC laughs] and when I 
finished, he says, “You know what, you’ve got a lot of good experience. And they can 
use you over there,” he says, “but Private Dahmer,” he says, “the Air Force needs come 
first and I want you to go back down to that Teletype school and be the best Teletype 
operator in the outfit.” [Laughter] He busted my bubble right in front of his desk, and 
46 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
when I went by the first sergeant, he said, “I told you so.” I went on back to the barracks 
and I got with it. 
EC: You resigned yourself? 
VD: Yes, I did. I learned how to type, graduated, and believe it or not, that was 
the best decision that was made for me by somebody else. That, being a Teletype 
operator, moved me into the communications vein, all the way to computers when I 
retired as a senior master sergeant. There ain’t no way I would’ve been a senior master 
sergeant driving a truck. And I got promoted on my first enlistment because I was used 
to studying. I was used to commitment, so I didn’t have no problem becoming a good 
Teletype operator, and it worked out real well. And I married, too, one month before I 
went in the Air Force, and by the time I finished my first enlistment at Tyndall Air Force 
Base in Florida where I was stationed, I was already a staff sergeant. I could take my 
family with me any place I went, and then assignment came up going to Europe, but prior 
to, my first assignment—. Let me back up a moment. 
Coming out of Teletype school, my first assignment then was to a radar station in 
Omaha, Nebraska. Not to the air base, a radar station, and from there, to Nome, Alaska, 
at a radar site overlooking the Siberian Strait, watching the Russians take off and land 
every day. [EC laughs] They fly you out and they leave you there for a year. 
EC: Wow. 
ND: Isolated. I’m married one month before I leave, my wife is pregnant with 
a baby, I’m wanting to be home, and I’m sitting here now in this isolated place waiting 
for a year to pass. 
EC: That must’ve been a—. 
47 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
ND: To me, it was domesticated purism, or whatever. [EC laughs] But it was 
all work, nothing else to do. You worked and slept. And I [1:25:00] cleaned up, did 
extra work in the offices’ quarters, make extra money to send to my wife and all. So 
when I came, when I was assigned from there, I had preference on the base because of 
this--. 
EC: Because of where you had been? 
VD: Where Ed been. And I picked Panama City, Florida, which was close to 
home. 
EC : And then your wife was able to be with you there? 
VD: And my wife came down there. I only had two stripes. She came down, 
but they had quarters on base for low-ranking airmen, and by that time I had two kids, 
boy and a girl. They were little tykes. And I went there with two stripes and I stayed 
there and made two more while I was there. Thing worked out well and I reenlisted, and 
that started my Air Force career. So, at reenlistment time, I talked to my wife. I says, 
“Look.” Now, prior to talking with my wife, this warrant officer from Kentucky, white 
fellow, World War II vet, was my boss. He was the communications officer over the 
whole thing. And I had left the comm center being a Teletype prompter, and I was his 
clerk. I learned how to type on a typewriter then, and that’s where I got my rank, 
working for him. He jacked me up. But I had to work, though. Then I became a 
Western Union accountant clerk, doing another task. And he asked me one day, he says, 
“Sergeant Dahmer,” he says, “you’re coming up for reenlistment” and because I talked 
about it, he says, “What you going to do?” I said, “Well, I’m going back to Mississippi 
48 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
to my dad’s saw mill,” and he said, “Are you crazy?” He said, “You only got sixteen 
years to go. You’re already a staff sergeant.” 
EC: [Laughs] So let me ask you. I don’t know if I know enough about the 
military. So, was your draft two years or four years? 
VD: It was a four-year tour. 
EC : It was a four-year tour. 
VD: When you’re in Air Force, meant a four-year tour. 
EC: Okay. So once you moved towards the Air Force, you had to commit to a 
longer tour. 
VD: I had two more years. 
EC: All right. So you had invested four years. 
VD: I invested four years. But that gave me a chance to make enough rank to 
where I can make a decision to whether I want it to become a career, in hindsight. 
EC: And so that was enough for you to envision a career with the Air Force. 
VD: I could envision—. And then when I told my boss, the warrant officer, 
because his offices back there, and I’m in here, at a typewriter, answering phones, and 
doing all this other work. He said, “You’re crazy,” and he and the top sergeant in the 
outfit there who was in the office with him come and said, “Hey, you don’t want to do 
that. Hey.” Started explaining the Air Force benefits and things going on, which I hadn’t 
really zeroed in on. And so after I talked with my wife and thought about it, I said, 
“Yeah, I’ll reenlist.” And I went back and I told him, I said, “Yeah, Mr.”—he’s one of 
them—I said, “Mr. Johnson, yes, I’ll reenlist.” He made an appointment, and I went out 
and talked to the commanding officer, squadron leader, major, and he already received 
49 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
notification that I was going to reenlist, and I walked in, and he shook my hand. He said, 
“Hey, Mr. Johnson says you’re going to reenlist.” I said, “Yes, sir. I’m going to.” He 
said, “Congratulations.” Then, they set me up for reenlistment and they were giving me a 
bonus. 
EC : For reenlisting? 
VD: Yeah. And if you reenlist for four years, you get a certain amount. If you 
reenlist for six years, you get more money. Well, since I’m going, I went for six years, 
and when I went to the finance office, they paid us in cash. I had a stack of twenty-dollar 
bills that high. [EC laughs] That’s the most money I’d ever seen in my life. Man, I said, 
“Oh, man!” 
EC: So you felt like you made a good decision. 
VD: Oh, I went on and told my wife I was rich, because she lived there on 
base, you know, and had bought me a little Ford car, and everything was going well. 
And that started my Air Force career. And the house was firebombed in 1966. In 1964, 
my family and I had returned from Germany, and we visited with dad and my mom there 
in the family home. And my wife is from here also, so between the two families. And I 
saw at that time that the racial tension was real high, and my dad was quite conscious 
then of his safety. But being home and enjoying being home, I didn’t really focus on it 
that much. Then, I was assigned to March Air Base in California, and I moved my family 
there with me. Got the kids involved in school, and at that time I was a master sergeant, 
and I became shift leader in a big communications organization, and I didn’t hear 
anything more from my dad because we didn’t communicate that much because he had 
his thing going and I had mine going, my Air Force career, and kids, and school, and all.

And on the morning, Monday morning, January 10, 1966,1 received a telephone 
call from one of my dad’s sisters who lived in [1:30:00] Compton, there in South Central, 
LA; Compton, California. And I was informed of what had happened. The house had 
been firebombed and it was like two or three o’clock in the morning. It woke me up out 
of a deep sleep. I was living in my own house downtown—I bought a house downtown 
with my family—and that was really a shock. I wasn’t too surprised because what I had 
seen, but at that time, it was a shock. So I woke my wife up and told her what had 
happened, and I proceeded then to get ready to go to work, put my uniform on. And so 
while sitting, after I got ready to go, I had time to think. I couldn’t call anybody because 
the house had been burned, destroyed, and there was no telephone communication. 
So, I’m here now just waiting on my—to find out what my next move is going to 
be. So in my thoughts, I said, “You know what? I know the—how blacks are treated in 
the justice system”—because I’m a grown man now, I’m thirty-five years old—“in 
Mississippi.” And something told me, “Go to the FBI office in Riverside and tell them 
about what has happened and express my desire, what I would like to see happen in my 
dad’s case.” I reported downtown, Riverside, California federal building. I was standing 
outside the FBI office when they came to work. Just two or three gentlemen came in, and 
we greeted one another. Went, “Officer, can I help you?” And I told him about it, and he 
said, “We already know about it,” because they were keeping up with these firebombings 
apparently on their system. 
And long story short, I says, “I have one request. I do not want any law 
enforcement officers, people, on my dad’s case, none from Mississippi. Outside of 
Mississippi, fine, because I’m well aware of the FBI, and I have top-secret DSI clearance. 
51 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
Fm well aware of what’s going on now.” And that one FBI officer looked at me and he 
says, “Hold on a minute. Are you telling me that you doubt the integrity of the FBI?” 
Fm never going to forget it, like it recorded on my brain. And I told him, “I didn’t say 
that. I told you what my desire was.” And from that time on, I found out later that I was 
being trailed. I was under observation. One of the reasons being is, my security 
clearance and my position, because I was in charge of base telecommunication center, 
had fifty people working, having all kinds of intelligence stuff, very super sensitive thing. 
And the commanding officer, when I left going home, who was a colonel, called me into 
his office and told me, “Do not compromise my position.” You know? 
EC: How did they think you might do that? What were the--? 
VD: What I knew. Now, I had access to—. 
EC: So they think, but what did they think you would do with it? 
VD: Well, we’ve had people deserting and going on and doing crazy stuff. Just 
want to let me know that my commitment was to the Air Force. Well, my commitment is 
also to my family. Fm not going to kill a career of fifteen years, going home, and do 
some crazy stuff. No. But that was okay, and I don’t recall them ever telling me that he 
regret what happened to my dad because I wasn’t focused on that. But when I went by 
the first sergeant, who was a good friend of mine, big outfit, a lot of people, he looked at 
me, just kind of shook his head like, “Dang.” In the meantime, I went on in and started 
preparing to come home, and I arrived home. That was on a—, I left Los Angeles Airport 
at midnight on that Monday night after I got reservations, so I arrived in New Orleans 
that next morning and got a flight coming out of New Orleans to home. And during my 
trip home, I saw this one guy on the plane. I didn’t notice it at the time, but the same guy 
52 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
that I saw on the plane had boarded the plane at midnight in LA and we got to New 
Orleans and had to change planes a couple of times because we were having difficulty, 
and finally I called a bus, and came on the bus. When I got to the site, I saw the same 
guy again, but I never connected the dots. 
EC: They already had somebody. 
VD: Already had somebody on me, and that person stayed on me for a long 
time, because when I got back to my job after being home for two weeks, and then one of 
the guys in my department, where all of the messages on the base, all kinds of clearances, 
going through my facility that Fm in charge of. They never, never did identify me as 
being the guy who sees everything that go on. A message come across telling about my 
activity. [Laughter] My [1:35:00] analysis guy showed it to me. So then, you know, I 
says, “Hey. These people don’t know Fm a Negro or whatever,” and so I said, “Well, 
they’ve been keeping up with me.” 
But in the meantime, coming home to bury my dad and what happened, this is the 
most essential part. My dad, the father of eight children, seven boys and a girl, seven of 
his sons, including me, served a total of seventy-eight years on active duty during the 
Korean and Vietnam era and beyond. We were serving our nation protecting the very 
country that neglected to protect my family from the terrorist forces here. My dad and 
mom slept in shifts for years, which my mom probably told you about, for years, while 
we were throughout the world protecting the nation, and my country couldn’t protect me. 
Coming home to that devastating sight that morning when I arrived, and I looked 
at the burned-out facilities, which I think you’ve probably seen pictures of, and I went to 
the morgue and looked at my dad, that was probably the worst days of my life. I mean, 
53 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
that was horrible. But I said, “Hey. You’re the oldest kid. You’ve got a responsibility. 
You’ve been around. Your mom, your sister been burned. Your dad’s dead. My 
family’s homeless. Law enforcement people everywhere, reporters everywhere, 
curiosity-seekers everywhere, at the burned-down site. Some grieving, some whatever. 
But I got to deal with this issue and then the burden is on my shoulder.” And having that 
responsibility as I grew up in the Air Force prepared me for a lot of tough stuff, but I was 
not prepared to deal with this. 
But I said, “It’s over now. You’ve got to do what—.” So I just blocked it out. 
And I started dealing with the objective. I mean immediately. “Dad ain’t dead as far as 
I’m concerned. Yeah, he’s dead, but I don’t let this get in the way of what I have to do, 
consequently.” I got good family, and I had some help, but the decision was on— 
around—me, being the oldest son, because that’s just the way we were raised. And in the 
meantime, I had contacted my other brothers and they was coming in, and the family 
getting prepared for the funeral and all this other stuff. Now, that was a very tough time. 
To tell you the truth, there’s never been another time in my life—. And it wasn’t—. My 
dad’s death, death comes, but the way he died and the contribution he had made to 
society, and the contributions he s—. All of us retired from the military with honorable 
discharge and with accolades. File full of things that we did that we learned at home to 
do right, and we’re good soldiers, no black mark nowhere, and we dealed with this. 
So and I looked up and said, “Well, my praise for defending my country was to 
what? Put up with what happened to it.” That’s what my country thought of me, because 
this did not have to happen. The oath that my brothers now took, hey, we lived up to it. 
Wherever they were going to send us, that’s where we were going to go, and we were 
54 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
going to do what we had to do. That’s the way we—. But the oath that those people who 
took to protect my family, they did not do it, and I fought my country for not making 
them do that. 
Now, I still love my country, but I still say, “Hey. My country could’ve done 
better than that. If I can do this for my country, how come my country couldn’t do this 
for my family?” And it took me a while to get over that, but I never thought about being 
vindictive. That ain’t me, but these things go through, because you have to have been 
denied the opportunity that you gave all of you for to try to have. And that was tough. 
EC: When your father was killed, were all of your brothers who’d served in the 
military, had they already, were they already in the military, or did some of them join 
after? 
VD: No, no, no. All of us had gone—. 
EC: And drafted, right? 
VD: Yes. Well-. 
EC: You said joined, but—. 
VD: But they were in the military. I don’t know how they, how all of them got 
there. Being the oldest, I was the first. When my dad was killed, it’s four of us on active 
duty. I was in California. Me, and my brother next to me, the second [oldest], he was 
career. He was on Shemya Island off of Alaska. My other brother was in Germany and I 
had one in Florida, and my brother Harold who had just returned from [1:40:00] Korea 
and ended his commitment to the service, honorably discharged, he was in the house that 
night. So the time that mom and dad, mom and dad were sleeping in shifts to avoid what 
eventually happened, they had five sons serving on active duty in the military. And for 
55 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
us four sons to come home in uniform and bury my dad because of these race-haters, all 
because he’s the “wrong” race, he’s the “wrong” color, but he’s born in this country. He 
was a good citizen, well thought of, a family of good citizens, and as far as I’m 
concerned, we weren’t better than nobody, but hey, my family had—. And as far as I’m 
concerned, did a good job in raising us to be good citizens, and we live by that code 
today. 
EC: Did anybody at the time recognize that fact about all of you all serving 
your country? Yeah. 
VD: Other than the fact that we came home, it’d be in the newspaper. There’s 
a sergeant came home, that one came home, but as far as—. 
EC: But nobody—. 
VD: Special, no. No. 
EC: Yeah. The contradiction you were pointing out. 
VD: Right. Nobody pointed it out. 
EC : Can you talk about what your family’s done over the years to try to 
pursue—there’s probably no justice in this case, but—to make sure that some people were 
held accountable? 
VD: Yes. My mom is a lady that I have the utmost respect for, and she gets 
that respect from all of us. She’s number one in our life. She’s the leader of our family, 
even though we were grown men. She went through all this and we never overshadowed 
her. You may notice that. We don’t do that. And as a result of what happened to our 
family, she chose not to leave. She chose to stay here because she had those two kids. 
She was a teacher, and she had brothers living in Washington and other places that were 
56 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
financially in good shape. One brother a dentist, others worked for the federal 
government in Washington, had good jobs, and they said, “Hey, leave the place! Come 
here.” She said—. She thought about it and she said, “Fm not going,” and she stayed, 
built a house on the same spot. Hey, and raised those two kids, Dennis and Betty, that 
she had by my dad, my brother and my sister. We don’t have no “halves.” Everybody’s 
brothers and sisters. Sent them to college, college degrees. They’re professionals and 
running them off in a life. And she built a home with assistance and continued her life, 
became an election commissioner in the same district where my dad was killed, for three 
terms and could’ve had more terms. And the whites put her in, all because of the kind of 
life that she lived. It wasn’t because they felt sorry for her. That was probably a part of 
it, a little sympathy there, but because of the life that she did and the way that she lived 
her life after this catastrophic event. 
And then she had to live through all of these klansmen’s trials. She testified over 
seventy-something times and after the fourteen who did this were indicted and they 
brought some to justice, and finally they couldn’t get Sam Bowers after they tried him 
four times because the jury had klansmen in there. She went through a whole, whole lot, 
and as a result, she maintained the family nucleus, the location, and we all came back 
home around her and built where you see we are today. She held everything intact, and 
to me, that demonstrates a whole lot about who we are as a family. There ain’t no “big 
Fs and little you’s.” We’re just a family committed to where we were raised and we got 
a lady here that my dad chose to be his wife down the road that we totally respect until 
the end, and that we do. 
57 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
EC: It’s such a thing to have to go through, and it seems like that you all have 
handled it as well as anybody could. 
VD: Coming out of this situation after we got the conviction of Sam Bowers—. 
EC: Did that help? 
VD: Yeah. Sam Bowers was in 1998. The Medgar Evers case serviced the 
opportunity for us to get Sam Bowers back in the courtroom. We won’t go through all of 
that. 
EC: Can you just—? I mean, we know, but can you say who Sam Bowers is, 
for people in the future who might—? 
VD: Oh, yes. For Sam Bow—. Sam Bowers was the leader of the White 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Jones County in the Laurel, Mississippi area, and he had 
power [1:45:00] that was equal to the governor’s, what a former Klansman told me, that 
he was highly regarded and he could go to the governor’s office anytime. And he had 
told former klansmen, or other klansmen in his organization, “You can kill a black man 
or nigger in Mississippi and don’t have to worry about going to jail.” Now, I got this 
from a former Klansman. So, Sam Bowers was a man that was beyond reach during that 
era. And to get him back into the courtroom in 1998, which required a lot of work. Our 
family worked with the law enforcement people to get him back to the courtroom, and I 
was the primary leader on that, with the assistance of the family now, but you’ve got to 
have a spokesperson. My mom and I, and my brother Dennis helped a lot also, and we 
were with the news media, and all, and created enough attention on it. [Pause] We 
created enough attention until we got the support of the community because we’re going 
through all these phases and we only got five convictions out of the previous trials that 
58 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
was held in the 1960s, late 1960s, [19]67, [19]68. But we never could get Sam. Now, we 
have a chance to get Sam. For Sam, and Sam was convicted on the 21st of August by jury 
verdict, 1998, somewhere around between two and three o’clock, a day I’ll never forget, 
for what he had done. And he was carted off to the jail and there at the prison, and he 
died in November of 2006 in prison. 
EC: What did it mean for you that he—? 
VD: Justice finally, even though it’s thirty-two years late. I wish it had been 
better, but it finally came and was very pleased. There were no high fives. There were 
no celebrations. We was glad to be treated equally in the justice system as others, even 
though it took a long time to do it. It took thirty-two years to do this. And the good thing 
that I see with my family, and I give this to my mom because she stayed here and dealt 
with it, is that we didn’t give up, and the community worked with us and didn’t allow us 
to give up. In other words, we had these memorial services every year on January the 
10th and about that time at the church to keep it alive. And the Hub City Professional 
Men’s Club, which is an all-black men’s club in Hattiesburg, my brother was a part of 
that, Alvin, they’d have a program every year. For twenty-five years, they kept it alive. 
And we got good support when it came time for the trials in [19]98. We had good 
support from all of the law enforcement officers. I never got one bad telephone call. One 
of my neighbors that I grew up with, a white guy, told me, he says, “Vernon,” he said, 
“they’re still out there.” He says, “Fm not sure if I was you I’d be doing this.” Well, I 
thanked him, and I appreciated it, and I moved on because I’d seen worse things in life. 
My dad gave his life, and it’s the least I can do, or we can do as a family, is to keep on— 
EC: Pursuing. 
59 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0114 
Vernon Dahmer, Jr. 
VD: Doing what we had to do until we get justice, at least try to. Okay? 
EC: Go ahead. 
VD: This photo is of my father, Vernon F. Dahmer Sr., back in his young days. 
This photo is a copy of the home site that was destroyed by the firebombing on January 
the 10th, which involved the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Laurel, Mississippi, 
led by Sam Bowers. This is the burned-out structure of the family home, taken about 
three or four days after the [1:50:00] firebombing. Those standing overlooking the site 
are my brothers who were serving in the military on active duty at other locations, 
including me, and I’m a part of this photo also. 
Okay. This is a copy of the grocery store prior to the firebombing. The grocery 
store was adjacent to the house, about a hundred, hundred and fifty feet away. This is the 
burned-down site of the grocery store, with two of my dad’s sons, my brothers, looking at 
the burned-out debris following the firebombing. This is a copy photo, is of the family 
members following the funeral, my father’s funeral, which took place—the exact date I’m 
not sure—but it was the weekend following January 10th, which was on a Saturday. 
This is a copy of the car which was in the carport, which was destroyed along 
with the firebombing.
