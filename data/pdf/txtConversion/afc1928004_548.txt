I 
wish my love and I 
was sailing, 
As far from land as far could be, 
Far, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me. 
CHORUS— 
Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, & c. 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy, 
The reason I 
will tell to thee, 
Because when drinking, I 
am thinking, 
Does my true love remember me.

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
'Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh I 
sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, &c, 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That, in kindness and truth were spoken. 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh ! to the heart that knows them so well. 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh I 
sorrowful sungs unsung.

SUNG BY BILLY EMERSON. 
Oh ! my golckn slippers am laid away,

An' my long-taird coat, dat I

An' my long white robe dat I

I'm gwine to get changed kase it fits too soon, 
An' de ole gray horse dat I

CHORUS— 
Oh! dem golden slippers!

Golden slippers I'm gwine to wear, 
Because dey look so neat; 
Oh ! dem golden slippers!

Golden slippers I'se gwine to wear, 
To walk in de golden street. 
Oh ! my ole banjo hangs on de wall, 
Kase it ain't been tuned since ' way last fall, 
But de darks all say we will hab a

When we ride up in de chariot in de morn. 
Dar's ole brudder Ben and sister Luce,

What a

When we ride up in de chariot in de morn. 
So it's good-bye, children, I

Whar de rain don't fall or de wind don't blow, 
And yer ulster coats, why, yer will not need, 
When yer ride up in de chariot in de morn. 
But yer golden slippers must be nice and clean, 
And yer age must be just sweet sixteen, 
And yer white kid gloves yer will have to wear, 
When yer ride up in de chariot in de morn.

McCORMACK THE COPPER. 
Written by Mr. W. J. Scanlan, and sung by him in Minnie Palnisr's 
" 
Boarding School," at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera House. 
Why do I 
smile 
well, I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
dandy copper on the Broadway Squad, 
And a 
brave one at that am I. 
If there's a 
murder or fight about, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Ah ! isn't he a 
dear. 
CHORE'S— 
I'm a 
darling, ain't I 
chaprming, 
And the ladies all say as I 
pass them by, 
Ain't he purty ! ain't he lovely ! 
Dan McCormack the copper am 1. 
Repeat 
visit all the collar shops, 
About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. 
I 
acquaint her with all the acknowledgments. 
Which from the public I 
receive, 
And tell her how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'd have to lave. 
I'm a 
darling, etc. 
ly antecedents were high-toned. 
Respected everywhere 
My father could whip an elephant--
My mother could whip a 
bear. 
My sister could toss a 
camel. 
My brother could fig-ht a 
tly. 
They could stand a 
rhinoceros on his head, 
And sing the Swate By- and- 13y, 
I'm a 
darling, etc.

The Night I 
Learned To Swint 
Words and Music by Thos. E. PowEits. 
Copyright, 1879, by 'Dios. 
E. 
POWERS. 
Sung with immense success by JAMES O'NEIL. 
rile music of this song is published in elegant lithographed title pitga 
by Mrs. Pauline Liodor, 60 Chatham street, will be sent to any 
address, post-paid, on receipt of price, 40 cents, 
One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
.To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORE'S. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh I " chaw roast- beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim, 
(Chorus.) 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Lee.-
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childish joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say: 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
DANCE ME 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile wotild win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, & c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee, 
Dance me on your knee, & c,

Levi - Kassiday. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
sung by J. E. Muicrirr, of M URPHY & MAOH 
in the laugnable sketch, entitled " The Secret." 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. 
H . 
HARDING'S, 2N Bowevy and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 36 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundlana, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A.- down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. ( 
Chm•us.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the 
mast" in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassday.

Handsome as a 
Handcart. 
Written by,JAs. McAvey expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
by them with trem endous success throughout the country. 
Copyrighted by A. 3. FtsnER, 1879. 
Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me ; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me ; 
And she knew me! 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel ! 
She surprised me ! 
She paralyzed me ! 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.)

And she played me for a

CHORUS. 
That rtalian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me— 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work. 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome 
As a 
handcart ! 
With her head stuck in a 
Picking cinders! 
She's a 
daisy ! 
She's terrible lazy! 
And she played me for a

Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last• 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tat., past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would tall, 
in spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past C0111C8 up before 
Mo like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall see 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ah ! the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, Icc.

Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Cuo:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c.

Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve,

innocently said:

was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c. 
5. 
Now when once more the light of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've ' waken'd up old memories you're the girl Pd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light:

Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Title and music composed by PADDY MURPHY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 070. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country, it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile I 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of, our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, &e.

Something of a 
Wrestler: 
Written by H. BENNE'rr, and respectfully dedicated to AL. W . 
FiLsoN, 
and sung by him with unbounded success. 
0, l'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
Whenever there's a 
boxing match I 
ante up my tin. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
like to make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of losing, but I 
never done it yet. 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestle and it ended in a 
fight, 
A Scotchman, a 
Dutchman, a 
Turk and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Riley got slugged with a 
brick. 
CITORt'S. 
Then nobody knows what a 
racket there was there, 
Nobody knows now, I 
tell you, I 
declare. ( Repeat chorus.) 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
could never keep it mum, 
Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he stuck out his band, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
lie caught a 
hold of McIntire, and threw him on the floor ; 
He went for little Brady, and he hit him such a 
crack 
That he knocked his Sunday shirt clean off of his back. 
Then nobody knows, &c.

What Are You Up To, 
Jane? 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart'g 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, N. Y. 
• 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug little grocery store. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in 
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in 
chief again. 
What are you up to, Jane? 
my life, you're up to your mis-
now what you up to, Jane ? 
my life, you're up to your mis-
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old ' uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.—As 
our " blessings" came into the room two., 
by- two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old ' un 
dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
Wh t 
are you up to Jane? & c.

When They're Making Me a 
King. 
As sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, 
Broadway. 
I 
had a 
dream the other night, I 
dreamt I 
was a 
king, 
And fifty million subjects to my honor they did sing; 
When I 
awoke, I 
soon found out the dream it wasn't true ; 
I 
don't think I 
shall be a 
king, I 
really don't; do you? 
CHORUS. 
When the moon is made of green cheese, when pigs begin to 
When four- and-twenty blackbirds are all baked in a 
pie; 
When the pie is opened, if the birds begin to sing, 
That will be about the time they're making me a 
king. 
Were I 
a 
king, the workingman should have his " old time " 
pay, 
And sewing girls should never toil for thirty cents a 
day, 
I'd take a 
trip to Canada, where Bennett he has gone, 
And make the people happy there, for they are all for 
Lorne. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd give each gin i 
a 
rich and wealthy beau, 
On every blooming widow I 
a 
husband would bestow; 
I'd give a 
candy store apiece to little girls and boys, 
And from the Elevated Road. I'd soon extract the noise. 
When the moon. &c.

WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ME A KING. 
Continued. 
Were I 
a 
king I'd go around with Talmage every night, 
I'd take a 
peep in every den to see them drink and fight; 
But when I 
feel inclined to go and see the haunts of sin, 
I 
think that Brooklyn would be found a 
good place to begin. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I a 
king, I'd make the parsons practice what they 
preach. 
I'd take away policemen's clubs that have too long a 
reach; 
The beggar*roid the man of wealth I'd give an equal 
chance, 
And find out how much Murphy gets for preaching temper-
ance. 
When the moon, & c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd make the land with milk and honey flow, 
Who was it robbed a 
certain grave? I very soon should 
know; 
On every grand piano leg, I'd draw a 
stocking fair, 
Lest Comstock should pop inland find some misdemeanor 
there.

Will I 
Always be Your Darling? 
Why Did My Josie ? 
Written by W
. 
J. 
SCANLON, of SCANLON & CRONIN. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a /ilea time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
CHORUS. 
oh, my 1 
wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine. 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to- morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
(Cliorus,) 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alasl she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
CHORUS.. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this world like my own little Joe. 
Dedicated to FRANK HANSON.

Will I 
always be your darling, 
As we journey down life's sea? 
Will the wife be just as precious 
As the sweetheart seems to be? 
There may be rough waves to weather, 
Over which our bark may sail, 
DO 
you think our hearts together 
Will ride smoothly through the gale? 
CHORUS. 
Will I 
always be your darling? 
Tell me honest, tell me true, 
If forever and forever 
I 
will be as dear to you ? 
When the silver hair shall mingle 
With the curly locks of gold, 
And my face, careworn and wrinkled, 
Tells you I 
am getting old ; 
Will I 
be the same dear darling. 
When shall come life's harvest days ? 
Will the love be then as ardent, 
And the lips as fondly praise ?

FOLEY in " Uncle Ike's Jubilee." 
A happy colored man am I, just three score years I've seen, 
I

Though old in years, my heart is young; it won't be long 
before 
The gospel train will come along, bound for the other shore. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am Uncle Isaac Green, just three score years I've seen ; 
Though old in years I'm you-.1g at heart, I

Green. 
When the horn does blow the work am done, the niggers 
they all throng 
To our cot down in the lane to hear a 
good old song, 
But Gabriel soon will blow his horn, and tell us " all aboard;* 
How happy we will be that morn' in the army of the Lord.

We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming ; 
He sat with Ins hand clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to have said " It is thine." 
Had he the courage to ask it. 
CHORUS. 
Birds of the air, joyous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
Were you asleep, or did you just peep 
Under the arch in the park ? 
Under the arch in the park, 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark 
Only the night-birds were calling; 
He whispered in tenderest strains, 
But his love, all! he dared not reveal it, 
A 
kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Had he the courage to steal it.

Moonlight around its was shining,

"I promise you never to break it."

With my graceful walk I

My great Colorados the barbers do curl. 
I

I've a 
story for your ear— 
'Tis of a 
fascinating little maiden 
To me she is mDst dear. 
She is so captivating 
She would steal your senses quite, 
To gaze but once upon her form 
Would till you with delight.

But still with Annie Dee 
We'll wander o'er the lea,

And pick the pretty \ iolets 
I

But though we'll never marry

For still I

Of Cupid's tiny dart.

Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte, 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me clay by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

The New York Lasses. 
Written and sung by H ENRY CARNEY with great success. 
Oh, I'll sing in the praise of the New York young lasses--
Such charming young creatures are they— 
For somehow or other, ' twixt one and another 
My heart has been stolen away. 
It's no use one sighing, tho' hard' I 
am trying, 
I 
can't tell wherever it's gone ; 
For the great and the small ones, the short and the tall ones, 
I'm in love with them all, every one. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the New York lasses for me, 
With their hearts and their eyes full of glee ; 
I'm in love with them all, both the short and the tall, 
So the ::ew York young lasses for me. 
Their sweet, smiling faces, as fresh as the daisies, 
Would captivate any man's heart. 
Tho' in beauty they're blooming, and quite unassuming, 
And act as they should woman's part ; 
Their eyes glisten brightly, their ways are so sprightly, 
Their modesty none can surpass ; 
Tho' it may perhaps look tiring, I 
can't help admiring 
Those pretty young girls as they pass. 
Oh, the New York young lasses, Lc. 
They trip like the fairy, so graceful and airy, 
They look so enchanting and pure ; 
At their darning and stitching they look so bewitching— 
More like angels than mortals, I'm sure— 
They have such pretty features, these lovely young creatures, 
That hearts made of stone they would break, 
If one would me marry no longer I,d tarry, 
And a 
good husband, too I 
would make. 
Oh, the Ncv Yon; young lasses, &c.

What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine So bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
We pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear.,_ 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
-When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon.

Oh, my, how happy we do be ! ( Sym.)

When the pretty little stars they' shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
1N:ow the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell ; 
And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a 
fairy dell. 
With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love to some one at the first sight, 
Down where the flowerets dwell.

Oh, my, how happy we do be ! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes, full of mirthful glee ! (Sym.)

Darling one, when first I 
met you, 
When I 
pledged you hand and heart; 
There were roses on your cheeks, love, 
And we vow'd we ne'er would part: 
One more kiss, for I 
am going, 
Far beyond all earthly woes; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered with the blushing rose.— Cho.

Thou'st gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in yon silent tomb ; 
Yet mem'ry recalls thy sweet preence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I 
think of the day we were parted, 
The heart-broken friends that stood by, 
Death came and it severed that tie, love, 
Thy spirit did mount upon high.

ThoWst gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in yon silent tomb ; 
Yet menfry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I've thought of our home in the West love, 
Of friends and kindred so dear ; 
Alas! death has entered that home, love, 
And robbed it of all that can cheer. 
I 
think of thee ever, my loved one, 
How hard it was from thee to part ; 
And while I 
have life and have hope, love, 
I'll cherish thee to my heart. 
(Chorus.) 
I'll come to thee soon, my dear darling, 
And never again from thee part ; 
The sun then will shine with that brightness, 
And pleasure return to my heart, 
Then life shall be sweet as before, love, 
And gladness re-echo with joy ; 
To meet thee above in that realm love, 
Where death ne'er again can destroy.

Grandmother's Chair, 
Written by JOHN READ, and sung with great success as the latest hit of

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pound,-; 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
flow my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, • 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, Szc.

A 
Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave 
Words and music by H ARRY K ENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by Wm. H . 
KENNEDY, 128 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. V. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, & c.

To the opera I 
went one night, 
And " Martha" was the play, 
The music was enchanting, 
And the scene was bright and gay. 
Jewels sparkled on fair forms 
And eyes sparkled as bright, 
And oh, I 
was transported with 
The gorgeus brilliant sight. 
My heart beat fast, my cheeks glow'd red, 
My eyes they danced with light, 
Just like two round and shining stars 
Lit on the brow of night. 
I 
raised my glass to look around 
To see what I 
could see, 
And found that every opera glass 
Was levelled right at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, smiles and blushes, music sweet, and jewels rich and 
rare, 
And waving fans, in many all fashion beauty there, 
My eager eyes drank in the sight as far as I 
could see, 
But every other eye was bent admiringly on me. 
I 
turned my head to look awhile 
And gaze upon the stage, 
I 
knew my hair and dainty hat 
Would soon be all the rage. 
I 
heard a 
long drawn tender sigh, 
The house was then quite still, 
And turned to meet a 
pair of eyes 
That made my bosom thrill. 
A 
lady was discoursing her most charming occupation 
And as I 
gazed and listened 
I 
forgot my own sensation, 
For those eyes and sighs in t'other box 
Seemed with music to combine 
As the lady's song her lover's heart 
With the thread she did entwine. 
(Chorus.) 
Style is what Catches the Girls. 
Copyrighted by E. H. H ARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
Sung by HARRY BEcxwern. 
-Behold a 
young man with a 
weakness for dress— 
I 
trust you won't say that I 
go to excess— 
The latest thing out is my passion to wear; 
I'm envied by gents, and ador'd by the fair ! 
Out of the fashion, you're out of the world ; 
Society's pleasures away from you whirl'd, 
At last, tho' not least, now in spite of the churls, 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, style is what catches the girls ! 
Talk about diamonds and pearls ! 
They won't go a 
mile unless you're in style, 
And style is what catches the girls. 
The darlings exclaim as I. pass down the street : 
" 
Oh ! isn't he ravishing, heavenly sweet !'' 
I 
pass by them slowly with such nonchalance, 
And see them upon me admiringly glance ; 
A prince in his carriage could ne'er hope to see 
The sweet admiration bestowed upon me ! 
They smile and they whisper, and shake out their curls, 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Yes, style is, & c. 
Now, not being wealthy, to keep up this pace. 
Adversity often allows me no grace ; 
My chances, sometimes, they are terribly slim, 
But I 
keep my head up, it is sink or to swim ! 
Some maiden of wealth will yet sweet upon me ; 
How can they resist wh— their eyes plainly see 
An Adonis in form, fashion, moustache and curls ! 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Yes, style is, &c.

At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me: 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid. 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this: 
You may look, etc 
When we were engaged, I . taid, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day, 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her :ay 
You may look, etc.

A

In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a

To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen SO 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Torn Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bott.e, 
Sure lie all the windows broke ; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

Down the river gliding; free,

'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a

Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along.

Fellows may be better looking, 
Richer, wiser than myself, 
But I've a 
gift I 
greatly value, 
More than beauty, sense, or pelf ; 
For I 
possess a 
style and manner, 
Loved by ev'ry girl I 
see, • 
A 
flirting, teasing, pleasing way—that 
Tickles them and just suits Inc. 
spoKEN.—Just my litt le peculiarity, a 
style of my own that tickles 
them. 
i 
Ion't know what it is, you know, but there's something 
about, ine they like, becatt e

Cfioitus. 
It tickles the ladies immensely, you know! 
It tickles the ladies, wherever I 
go; 
It tickles the ladies, they like it, and so— 
They think I 
shall marry—but--oh I 
dear no! 
In position quite romantic 
With my hand my heart upon, 
sigh, as thought I'd lost the power 
Of ar-ti-cu-la-ti-on I 
Then, in tones as low and gentle 
As a 
cooing turtle dove, 
Say—well— something sentimental, 
Look—but do not speak my love. 
SPOREN. — That's how it's done, this spooney business tickles them 
—and they are in no hurry lor you to come to the point; they don't 
care for it to be too soon over for the longer a 
flirtation lasts, the 
mote— 
It tickles the ladies, etc. 
Though my heart with love may tingle, 
I 
ne'er lose in 
hand or head, 
For I 
know I 
must keep single, 
I 
should lose my power if wed. 
Though I 
might be still as pleasing, 
Still as youthful, fond, and gay, 
I 
should find the charm was broken 
From the fatal wedding day. 
SPORES.—Yes, it would be all up, the sport would be over, the bird 
would be caged, and nobody but my better-half would admit, that--
It tickles the ladies, etc_

famous sketch, entitled " Life in a 
Tenement House." 
• 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That tauglit her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha ! 
Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of his legs.

Dedicated to H ARRY M INER, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the genfle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning ; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! ( Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers ; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not !" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, S,:c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding ; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c.

Little Treasure, Linger Near Me. 
Published by permission of PHIL, P. 
KEIL, McKeesport, Pa. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
When I 
have you by my side 
I 
forget all care and trouble. 
And that ill may life betide. 
I 
remember only, darling, 
That the one I 
love is near, 
In the sunlight of your presence 
All the shadows disappear. 
CHORUS. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Oh, how rich a 
man am I! 
Not a 
king on earth is richer, 
For no gold your love can buy. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Let me look into your eyes, 
Where the sweetest violets blossom 
Underneath the summer skies. 
Put your hand in mine, my darling, 
And believe the words I 
speak ; 
Never any rose was fairer 
Than the roses on thy cheek. 
Linger near me, &c. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
While the days are passing by, 
Meet me with a 
kiss at nightfall, 
And the love-light in your eye. 
Oh, my darling, life without you 
Would a 
dreary journey be, 
Let me keep you always near me, 
For you're all the world to me. 
Linger near me, & e.

I 
know a 
little rosy bud, 
A 
light-weight of sixteen, 
Wid hair where warmest colors blaze, 
And heart where truth do beam. 
She have a 
cheek where freshness dwells, 
She'd spoil up any man, 
A lump of carrot gold is she, 
This little Maggie Ann. 
CmpRus. 
This little Maggie Ann, 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
She'd strike you blind dumb, 
This sweet little plum, 
This slick and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggie Ann. 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
A Vaynus is she, 
Whatever that may be, 
Is little Maggie Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine. 
But she bekem high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
rale pure Irish nurse 
Is little Mary Ann. 
This little, & e. 
The babies all she washes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

Jealousy." 
Let my name be kindly spoken 
'When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly speak of thee. 
All the scenes of days departed 
I'll endeavor to forget, 
And if you are broken-hearted, 
Think not of the days we met. 
CHORUS. 
Let my mace be kindly spoken 
When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly .speak of thee. 
In the past We loved each other, 
Loved each other fond and true; 
And I'll never find another 
That can take the place of you. 
Tho' I 
wander on for ever, 
Seeking lands beyond the sea, 
Well I 
know that I 
shall never 
Never find the like of thee. 
Let my name, &c. 
If the fate should bid me meet you 
At some far-off distant day, 
I 
would fondly kiss and greet you 
In the old familiar way. 
Tho' the binding link is broken, 
It is sweet to part as friends, 
And the farewell word that's spoken 
To the heart a 
sweetness lends.

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fere simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called iturmrTy DUMPTY,' and 1)01111d 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirtine, 
the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Ridinc, Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and tile directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening'Bulletin.
