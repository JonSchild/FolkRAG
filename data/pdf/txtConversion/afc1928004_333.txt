IRISHMEN TO THE FRONT

at the OLYMPIC THEATRE, BROADWAY. N. Y. 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. 
FISHER, OS Nassau treet, Sew York. 
The Irishmen are out to-day, all dressed up 
the style, 
With blooming shamrocks in their hats, and faces born to 
smile; 
Old Erin's flag is flying with 'Columbus' starry gem, 
And our friends aro out to cheer and shout, for the gallant, 
Irishmen. 
CHORUS. 
Then Irishmen to the front, hurrah! 
The tiro and drum we hear, 
With step so gay, we march away, 
While all the people cheer, 
The ladies too, with hearts so true. 
Applaud us now and then, 
And on St Patrick's day they love to see 
The gallant Irishmen. 
We march the street r:o graceful, with the marshal in advance, 
The band plays up an Irish tune, and it almost makes us dance. 
There's such delight, It byings us back to ould Ireland one 
again: 
With banners proudly floating o'er the gallant Irishmen. 
Then Irishmen, Coc. 
At. night we're ready to join the fun and take a 
social glass: 
We talk of dear ould Ireland, the shamrock and the grass; 
We laugh and sing, and our feet we fling, like Irishmen so trie, 
And if there:: a 
light, why its our delight to show what we can 
do, 
Then Irishmen, & c. 
HAND IN HAND. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and preformed by ScANLAN 
CRONIN, with great success at the Theatre Comique, 514 
Broadway, New York. 
THE yankee land is full of joy, 
A 
century has gone, 
And here we are to celebrate 
The glories we have won. 
We sought with fight to disunite, 
But peace now rules the land. 
The North and South to day are joined, 
Rejoicing-Hand in hand. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' bright is the land, where liberty was born, 
Dear to us all is our nation so grand. 
Flags are entwined, and foes hard to find, 
Now, we are all united Hand in Hand. 
The rich, the poor, the young and old, 
Are all alive with glee, 
They sing the songs of freedom's land 
The same as you and me. 
They shoot their guns, and beat their drums, 
With noise so loud and grand, 
And cry " long live America, "

all are Hand in Hand. 
Tho' bright Is the, (to. 
They drink to noble Washington, 
The greatest man of all. 
Whose sword left us our liberty, 
And made the foeman fall. 
From far and near, great men are here, 
To learn and understand, 
The nation's glory and delight, 
While all are Hand in Hand.

We have a 
Prince from Germany, 
And Lords from England too, 
A 
Count from Spain, a 
Duke from France,

Is here to praise the land, 
Where rich, and poor, are all alike,

O'HALLERAN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
Anew a 
original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, 
in his new and original sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is 011alleran, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery they can easily tell: 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro, 
The blaclguards they see me, arrah from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORI:g. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street, 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll-hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green. of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up. and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'llalleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policerr.,an. 
For as I 
promenade, Szc. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
rormdsman you see. 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand. 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can, 
To hOuld my reputation as a 
true Irishman.. 
For as I 
promenade. tfic. 
THE WEDDING TOUR. 
Written by W. SCANLAN', and sung with great success 
SCANLAN AND CRONIN. 
Now we're on our wedding tour, 
Full of joy you may be sure, 
Here and there we ramble round, 
Every place for pleasure bound; 
You should see us day and night, 
In our honey moon's delight, 
Free from every eare and woe, 
singing merrily as we go. 
C FIORE'S. 
Sure, oh sure we're on our wedding tour; 
We're a 
dandy pair, and the people stare 
Alike, the rich and poor; 
So gay, so gay the moments fly away, 
Our voices ring as we laugh and sing, 
While on our wedding tour. 
We have wandered to the sea, 
Where the waves are wild and free; 
We have stood on mountains high, 
Gazing at the summer sky, 
Far away in Spain and France; 
We have watched the latest dance. 
And in Erin's 1ovely land, 
Oft we met r, friendly hand. 
Sure, oh sure &c, 
Now we're going to settle down, 
In some corner of the town, 
There we hope our friends will call, 
Welcome is the word to all; 
We will have a 
drop to spare, 
And besides a 
vacant chair; 
Friendly words for every one, 
Song and dance and boundless fan. 
Sure, oh sure & u.,

Have I

O'er the bosom of the ocean, 
Shall the sea-bird cease to rove. 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E're my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee, &c. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest: 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest, 
Be my heart thy throne for ever, 
Let all tears forgotten be; 
Weal or woe es-trange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee.

Price 35 cts. 
We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great SL 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand. 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
â€˜Ve smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
They've left their hash to come 
out 
and 
mash, when the Mar-
eyes; 
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Ememld Hall, and an illegant supper 
There was beans and peas and 
frigazees, and oysters fat for 
too,â€” 
With pickled stgws, and hullabaloos, and 
Irish quail 
so 
grand; 
you, 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gans band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Brani,gan'g band.. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
OUR OULD IRISH HOME. 
Written and sung by WiLuem SCANLAN. 
Ould Ireland is our native home, 
The land where we were born, 
And of it we are proud our friends, 
And we ne'er our country scorn. 
'Twas there our poor ould parents died 
Not many years ago, 
And ever since that time we had 
To wander to and fro. 
CHORUS. 
From our ould Irish home, 
Our ould Irish home, 
The land of our birth, 
Where strangers may roam.

There's not an Irishman to-day, 
But would light with all his might, 
To see his dear ould country free, 
And Mame up grand and bright. 
With the flag of freedom waving high 
O'er Ireland s 
beauteous home, 
Arrah, then our hearts would beat with joy, 
And we never more would roam. 
From our ould Irish home, &c. 
flow I 
long to see the day arrive, 
When we shall take our stand, 
Beneath that green immortal flag, 
And fight for mother's land; 
To strike I 
to strike that wished for blow, 
And break that cruel chain, 
That holds our own dear mother's isle 
In bondage, grief and pain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
our ould Irish home, 
Our ould Irish home, 
The land of our birth, 
Where strangers may roam.

Broadway, New York. 
Did ye's ever go in 'till an Irishman's shanty? 
Och! b'ys, that's the place where the whiskey is plenty ; 
With his pipe in his mouth, there sits Paddy so free, 
No King in his place is prouder than he! 
CHORUS. 
Arrah! me honey, 
W-h-a-c-k! Paddy's the boy. 
There's a. three-legged stool, with a 
table to match 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a 
latch, 
There's a 
nate fether mattra.ss all bustin' with straw, 
For want of a 
bedstead, it lies on the floor. 
Arrah! me honey, kc,. 
There's snug little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of boords that was left when the shanty was built: 
There's a 
thiee-cornered mirror hangs up on the wall, 
The divil a 
face has seen it all. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
Ho has pigs in the sty, and a 
cow in the stable, 
And he feeds them on scraps from the table; 
They'd starve if confined, so they roam at their aise, 
And come into the shanty whinever they plaise. 
Arrah! me honey, &râ€ž 
fle has three rooms in oneâ€”kitchen, bedroom and hall; 
And his chist is three wooden pegs in the wall; 
Two snits of owld clothes makes his wardrobe complete, 
One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street. 
Arrah! me honey, Szt.c. 
Ile can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate, 
But is always continted with praties and mate; 
He prefers them when cawlei (if he can't get them hot), 
And makes thy in a 
bowl when he can't get a 
pot. 
Arrah! me honey, kc. 
There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys, 
Attends to the shanty, the girls and the boys; 
The brats lie thinks more of than gold that's refined). 
biddy's the jewel that's set in his mind. 
Arrah! me honey, Scc. 
The rich may divide their enjoyments alone, 
With those who have riches as great as their own; 
But Pat hangs the latch-string outside of his door, 
And will share his last cent with the needy and poor.

I'M Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or fpr dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patzick's Day I 
love to wear the flat me father wore, 
CHORUS. 
It's o2d, but it's beautifulâ€”the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore--
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
bid you all good eveningâ€”good luck to you I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father 
WOrb. 
It's old, etc.

with overwhelming applause, at three of the leading varlet: 
theatres in New York. 
DID you ever make love? 
If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once. so bashfui and shy. 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing ana teasing had such a 
nice way; 
.Now every night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
But she had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant. 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
Spokenâ€”Charley, dear, before you take a seat, won't you 
please go and. 
CHORUS 
Pull down the blind, pull down the 
Pull down the ,: hind, love, come don't be -
aLkiut.l. 
Though we're alone, near this in tnind, 
Somebody's loosing, low, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one ming and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waiat low cosy ore at 
Luce two little turtie-aoves perched on a 
tree 
squeezing and teasing and pleasing we hadâ€” 
Ouch billing and cooing that make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad 
but still 
was awfully s-:.-eet on me. 
Spoken.. â€”Well, I 
should say so; I 
cut her other beau out al-
t 
og.ether, so one night when we were alone in the front parlor, she 
saw this other beau go past the window, so she drew up very 
close to me, and whisperedâ€” 
Pull down the blind, S
CC 
One night, for a 
change, to the theatre we went 
And when we got home she was very content, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine : 
She called me her rose-bud, her duck and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
Spoken.â€”Yes, I 
popped the question to her right then and 
there, at.d de you know at that highly interesting moment, just 
as I 
asked this fair creature to marry me, there was a 
police-
man went past ac she drew up a 
little closer, and ,put her dx.-: 
arms arouna my neck, and looked up into my face with all her 
innocent simplicity, and simpered out, " Well Charley, if I 
marry, 
you, yat won't abuse me, will you ?" 
Abusc you, why bless

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1874 by E. H. 
KIARDING, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Words and Music by Joseph P. SKELLY. 
rhe Music of this song is published by E. 17 1st

Nevp York. 
Price 10 cents. 
As sung by JOELNNY ROACH, the Irish Comic, and Da. Its 
L. THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
ulcahy's gone away! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took couhriand 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away! 
He was great,. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' tie chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of itâ€” 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, Jr_o. 
ae treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man-
But now he's gone away 
He was great, 
The girLs went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and sayâ€” 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &..c.

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed by JOHNNY ROACH. 
COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
'or you have to fight both day and night 'gaiast John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheers. 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town. 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh. clear the track I" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, Sce,. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
, grows. 
Then hurrah, ke.

WHERE HAS TWEED GONE 
By JAMES CARR. 
CAN any one tell us where Tweed has:gone ? 
Old Bill has gone, the Boss has gone. 
You see, Sheriff Connor feels very forlorn, 
While sorrow is breaking his heart. 
The Warden and Keeper have got in a 
stew, 
Got in a 
stewâ€”in fact, into twoâ€” 
To happiness now they have bidden adieu. 
Because the chief played it so smart. 
SPOKEN.â€”Among the numerous opinions that are hazarded 
in my hearing I 
note the following: 
Perhaps he's on Jim Bennett's yacht, and plows the raging 
main; 
Perhaps with Babcock gone, crooked budge to straighten 
again ; 
Perhaps " gone West" with Susan B. upon a 
special car; 
Perhaps he's gone to Cuba, for a 
Connecticut seed segar. 
A 
nice pile of ducats they'll pay if you bring 
This Tammany King, this Boss of the Ring, 
And Connor and Dunham and Hagan will sing 
With joy if the Sachem you'll find. 
They have sought high and low William M. to regainâ€” 
But all in vain, that's very plain, 
Have concluded they'll never escort him againâ€” 
I 
think I'm of the same mind. 
SPOKEN â€” But still I 
hear this clamor : 
Perhaps he's gone with Darwin to civilize the ape, 
Perhaps with Bristow gone " to let no guilty man escape," 
Perhaps he's gone to Utah, the Cancan dance to teach, 
Perhaps to Boston gone he is the " Third-term Ghost" to 
preach,

STOKES' VERDICT, 
Written and Snng by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON. 
Air.â€”" Never g,) Back on the Poor." 
IF you'll listen awhile, Ill sing you a 
song 
ALout this " glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference" I'll show ' twist the rich and the poor, 
Lti a " trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of "stamps," you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own ?rison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or goldâ€” 
Let the " rich " go, but hang up the poor ! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we've had now-a-days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his graveâ€” 
A 
good man as ever was bornâ€” 
Jim Fisk he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast, the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and:wine, 
But his heart it w : s 
right, I 
am sure ; 
Though he lived iike a " prince" in a 
palace so fine. 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wo.f" from the door ; 
He strove to do right, though he my have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor! 
JIM _
Fisk was a 
man, wore his 
heart on his sleeve,' 
No matter what people would say, 
And he done all his d 
eds ( both the good and the bad) 
In the broad open light of the day, 
29 
With his grand " six-in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash" to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great I:re " slio -Vd the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his " wealth," still remembered the poor! 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
his "Lightning Express" manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor! 
Now what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this friend of the poor? 
When such men get free, is there any one safe 
If they.step from outside their own door? 
Is there one law for the poor anti one for the rich'' 
It seems so, at le st so I 
say ; 
If they hang up the poor, whyâ€”damn it 1â€”the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way! 
CHORUS. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe, 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back on the poor. 
Oh shame on this " land of the free and the brave," 
When such sights as this meet our eye! 
The poor in their prisons re treated like slaves 
While the rich in their cells they live high. 
A poor devil " crazy with drink," they will hang 
For a 
murder he didn't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " political friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to spend! 
CHORUS. 
But if things go on this way, we'll stand it no more; 
The people will rise up in bands ; 
A 
Vigilance Committee we'll raise on our ihore, 
And take the law in our own hands

TERRENCE MULDOON. 
By Cox T. 
M URPHY, 
For ED. )4IURRAT. 
In the county Tipperary there lived, long ago, 
A Widow whose husband was dead. 
And whose son, I 
am told, when scarce a 
year old. 
Sang songs and drank whiskey in bed. 
And as he grew big he could dance ye a 
jig, 
On a 
table, a 
chair, or a 
spoon ; 
And the ladies would sigh for a 
glance of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
CEOTIFS. 
He could read, he could writeâ€” 
He could dance, he could fight; 
He could sing or could whistle a 
tune, 
And the ladies would sigh. for a 
glance of his eye. 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
Young Terrence was purty as purty could be. 
And his featuresâ€”so every one saidâ€” 
Was gentle and mild as a 
two year old child, 
While his hair was a 
beautiful red ; 
And as for his hand, by my soul it was grand, 
And his nose it turned up to the Moon; 
Sure, the boys in the street, all envied th,
.. feet, 
Of the beautiful Terrence Muldoon. 
He could read &c. 
young Terrence's eyes were as blue as the skies. 
And his voice was as sweet as a 
fife ; 
But his passion to stale often sent him to jail, 
And at last put an end to his life. 
For one night in his sleep he was caught stealing sheep. 
And the jury agreed yery soonâ€” 
A 
rope, do you see. 'round the limb of a 
tree, 
Soon ended poor Terrence Muldoon.

WHEN only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this wonderful town; 
Strange things I 
have seen and stranger things heard 
Which to me appeared queer I 
must own; 
I 
don't want you to think I'm perfection, 
Nor I 
wouldn't be indeed if I 
could, 
Yet whenever I 
go among the rich or the poor, 
There is some one to say I 
am no good. 
CITORUS. 
For the boys in the street they cry out 
In a 
way can' t 
be misunderstood; 
Will you ever go home to old Ireland; 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
When first I 
arrived in the city, 
To a 
first-class hotel sure I 
went; 
Straight up Broadway I 
r . mbled, 
To view all the sights I 
was bent; 
Into a 
neat little gin-mill I 
wandered, 
Like a 
r. al Irish gentle 1 
an should; 
When the puppy that sto -C 
behind the bar, 
Says you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the Boys, .14. 
Says I 
do 1 
look Ike a 
hangman,: 
Or any of that rascally crowd; 
Who in Ireland for less than a 
shilling, 
To take a 
man's life would he proud; 
No, indeed, now my friend, you don't know me, 
Thoughpoor I 
might be and need food, 
Yet there is not a 
man in the country, 
Begorra could say I 
am no good 
For the Boys, &c. 
When at home I 
was a 
bit of a 
boxer, 
And could hold my own with the rest, 
And in many an off- hand encounter, 
I 
was known to have come out the best; 
Yet I 
hardly reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely knew, be dad, where I 
stood, 
When a 
shaver shot up to my shoulder, 
Says Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the Boys, &c.. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang, 
I 
can daily be seen at the hail; 
Now when the poor and the sick need assistance, 
By you all it is well understood, 
There is not a 
man in the ward 
Will say Murphy, lay down you're no good. 
For the boys in the street, they all shout, 
In a 
voice can't be misunderstood, 
There goes Mr. Murphy the solid man, 
Dare any of you say he's no good.

TIM FLAHERTY. 
[Copyright, 1872, by JOHN Cirusca & Co.] 
Sung with great success by PAT Roortn-r. 
I'm a 
lighthearted Paddy, a 
rale Irish laddy, 
I 
went to America strange wonders to say; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York, 
I 
was eighteen long days a 
crossing the say. 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a 
blaggard who said, " Paddy, come go with me, 
And I 
will show you the city, the sights are so pretty." 
He says, " What's your name ?" says I " Tim Flaherty.. 
Cnonus. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arah, gaze upon me; 
A 
lighthearted Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment: 
When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I 
wint to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, &c. 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy.

Good evening to you one and all, 
You're looking well I

I 
took a

great big ship 
Acrooss the raging sea; 
I've been out of work a

And you know it's very hard; 
But now I've got a

Bera.nt in the Boulevard.

So here I 
am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid; 
While my son does carry the Pick, my boys, 
And I 
do handle the spade; 
My Uncle Deal is an Alderman, 
And he holds a 
grip in the ward; 
'Tis him that gives the tickets out 
To work on the Boulevard, 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! 
So now farewell, I'm going away, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
For if I 
sing any more for you 
I'll lose a

I'm going down to the City Hall, 
To try and get a

To put my father's Uncle to work

Here I 
am, an Irishman, 
As you can plainly see ; 
I 
just came over from Ireland, 
From the county of Tralle.

I 
was met by a 
fair haired maiden, 
And this is what she saidâ€”

meet you pet, 
I'll meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet; 
I'll strike you with a 
Turkey-leg, I'll smother you with the 
stuffing; 
For the darling of the ladies is Hilderbrant McGuffin. 
Oh when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to ray great joy, 
My wife she made me a 
present 
Of a 
darling, bouncing boy; 
And when at night he'd holler for his Paregorie, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd singâ€”

"St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
By M ATT. McAmis.. 
Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
The noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border. 
Arrah ! But the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly dressedâ€”. 
No monarch ever was bolderâ€” 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she could'nt resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St, Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och! sure, but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey I 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Divil a 
bit do they care for that, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator; 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
Of " St. Patrick's day in the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant part, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you a 
wack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning !" 
4g 
Airâ€”" Mulcahy's gone away." 
YOU have beard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name: 
And, faith he had a 
sister, too, 
Was noted for her fame: 
She was chief-cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making a 
hash was guat; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
CHORUS. 
She is tall and thin. 
With her crooked shin: 
And her age was twenty-eight, 
Her cheeks were red, 
And so was the head 
Of Mulcahey's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
g to see; 
G e 
s 
me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cakes and tea, 
And oftimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whispering my love story to 
Mulcahey's sister Kate, 
CHORUS. â€”She is tall and thin, etc. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That she was fooling me; 
went to her house, one night, 
And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a 
greasy soapfat-man 
A-hugging my darling Kate. 
Cnoaus.â€”She is tall and thin, ete.

Music by JAMES E. 
STEWARM, 
The roses and lilies now bloom in the dell, 
They smile in their beauty for Kathleen Machree 
She trips to the glen that we both know so well, 
While I 
am so anxious her sweet face to see. 
0, could you but list to the sound of her -voice, 
It fills me with joy, 'tis music to me ; 
When I 
ask if she loves me, her answer will beâ€” 
A 
kiss from the lips of sweet Kathleen Machree, 
CHORUS. 
Kathleen Machree, sweet Kathleen Machree, 
No rose in the dell can compare love with thee ; 
Kathleen Machree. sweet Kathleen Machree, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree. 
Some maidens are sweeter and fairer to view, 
But none can compare with sweet Kathleen Machree, 
She wins with her smiles and her heart free from guile, 
While close by her side I 
am longing to be. 
0, she will be waiting to-night in the glen, 
With words that are fond and sweetest to me ; 
She's the dearest to me and the fairest of all, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree.

I'm far superior to Muldoon,

I'M quite independent in my Way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the let dissipated,

With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me loan' round 
The whiskey bars at night.

I'm as dacent a 
man as you can End, 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of laming in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound.

I

With a

Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I

Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly showo 
That there's no such man as me.

Oh since that time I've always found you've been a

I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been fur you ; 
Kind word, were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life ; 
I 
now look back upon the p 
st, along life's stormy sea, 
I 
smile to think '
mid all life's scenes, you've been a

THE CHARCOAL MAN, 
Composed and Sung by GEORGE W ELLING, the Gr-nt Comique. 
AMâ€”Dub/in. Carman. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if he does go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said I 
was a 
genius and she'd have no other man; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust around the the city and my Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, &-c. 
One day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He upset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his revolver and blew himself off the 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead a 
single life, 
And to peddle charcoal as you see, with no Rosy for my 
wife. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c.

The N. Y. Evening _Vail writes: 
" 
A Life Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 Nas-
sau trest ca led the ' Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encoarage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
'where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "fltrting." 
The N. Sr. Eeening Telegram, writes: " We have lately seen a neat littls 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, NO. OS 
Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opk randi of flitting. and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Courting Cards.â€” This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young peopleâ€”a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords v,-ith 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
ut may be enjoyed by evening parties  â€¢
