THE BIG „4".' MUSKETEERS. 
A.•:' sung by the only Bm " 4," 
LISTER, ALLEN, STICITII AND W ALDRON. 
It was on a 
Saturday night, 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Henderson Carter 
Our Captain for to be; 
He accepted the office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers, 
For to march in front of the ranks 
Of The Big " 4" Musketeers. 
Cnostrs. 
We march like Soldiers, through the streets, 
With our new flags flying so gay; 
And beat the time with both our feet, 
While the Band does sweetly play; 
From windows high, the girls do look, 
And smile on us, Pioneers! 
And then their handkerchiefs they wave, 
At the Big " 4" Musketeers. 
As we're marching down the street, 
With our Band a 
playing, so gay, 
some people we chance to meet, 
And this we heard them say— 
Who are those Soldiers so bold? 
They look so very queer! 
The crowd then all did shout— 
That's The Big " 4" Musketeers I 
We march, &c.

TURN DOWN YOUR COLLO. 
Written and sung by Joinz D. Gairm, the popular 
Irish Comedian. 
rn sing of my son who is just twenty-three, 
That stays up the whole night to dance the tra la-la le. 
He is one of the gang, can b3 seen every day, 
With his skinny tight pants, walking down Broadway; 
He says he is working every day, 
He is a 
stearer for a 
Bunco, and he on the lay; 
When I 
ask him the meaning of this Bunco lay, 
He'll turn round and wink, and then he will say— 
Cnonns. 
Turn down your collar! Turn down your collar I 
Nixey. old man, now come here, take this dollar; 
Now 14's have a 
Ball don't squeal or holler— 
Cheese it, there comes a 
cop— turn down your collar. 
When I 
ask this lad to try and reform, 
He says, g out West, you're an old omathom ! 
To shake the gang, he says he will try, 
And join the preachers Moody and So.nkie; 
There is no use of talking, he stays out all night, 
And comes home in the morning with the gang boilint 
tight ; 
He calls his mother an old calabash, 
And says pull down the blinds, the old man's got a 
mash. 
Turn down your collar, &e.

And them we're going to try 
To dance into their affections, 
Or we'll dance until we die!

RAILIM. 
Waltzing with cousin at the ball last night, 
One face this heart set beating, 
Whose form s6 fair, it dazzled quite 
This heart, this heart when first we met;, 
And as my fond pulsations like a 
torrent heaved, 
My boom's echo's fondly beat; 
Oh would, as full of anguish, 
I 
were from love, from love relieved. 
CHORLIS. 
For his face is fair, 
His form is rare, 
My love— sweet dove 
Our hearts combine. 
No power I 
fear 
If he is near; 
Through life— 
A 
true wife— 
Me he will find. 
They told me that his heart was taken 
With one more proud, more gay. 
But still my love it was not shaken. 
For with him, night seemed turned to day. 
And as his silver voice so softly plead 
Or Whispered—whispered in mine ear, 
A 
spell, as if by magic, 
Would lisp his name, so dear to me. 
For his face is fair, &c. 
And true love conquers all; 
But still there's hope while life remains, they say, 
The darker be the night; the brighta day. 
Oh! darling Cupid though thou art small, 
.Be herald for thy mistress, and be sure 
Thou fill'st him with true love's ala ins, 
And -
bring, oh! bring him. angel Cupid, 
Yes, bring him back unto these arms. 
For his face is fair, eta.

THE JOLLY OLD MAN. 
Written and sung by HARR1. BENNETT. 
You see before you a 
iolly old man, 
My age is sevetty-two; 
I 
ne'er let sorrow remain in my heart, 
And I 
never am sad or blue; 
I've wrestled with fortune many a 
y 
ear— 
Of trouble I've had a 
good share ; 
But I 
smokes my pipe, and drinks my b.,— 
For misfortune I 
do not care. 
CHORUS. 
Fol de lol, lol do lot, dum dd dam day, 
I 
sing and dance all my sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly aml gay— 
Fol de lol, 101 de 101, dum de dum day. 
Some people meet all their troubles half way, 
And always are borrowing woe; 
And that is the reason their hair turns gray, 
And their spirits do get so low, 
Now take my advice, give care a 
wide berth, 
Let your hearts be happy and light; 
For nothing is gained by crying, you know, 
So keep your eyes sparkling and bright: 
CHORUS. 
Fol de lol, 101 de 101, dum de dum day, 
I 
sing and dance all ray sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly and gay— 
Fol de lol, lol de lol, dum de dum day.

ARLEY ROSS. 
ViTnen by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by &mix D. Garrimr.. 
0, ladies and gentlemen listen to me, 
t,nd whin you have heard me I'm sure you'll agree 
That I'm much abused, though I 
can't tell why, 
And to tell you my troubles I'm going to try. 
On the corner beyond there's a 
gang of young roughs, 
They insult decent people, and call themselves toughs, 
And ivery day at me their slang tney do toss, 
And they say I 
resimble the lost Charley Ross. 
They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out " Gilhooley, your collar is loose ;" 
At Mulligan's wake sure they filled me with snuff, , 
And tould me to go out and get meself stuffed. 
Sure, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a 
job, 
To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
But to understand thim I'm greatly at loss, 
Whin they say, " Pipe him off—there goes young 
Charlie Ross !" 
'Twas only last night, sure, they gave me a 
call, 
To deliver a 
lecture at Hibernia Hall 
3: put on a 
tilled shirt and hastc:-.'d there quick, 
But the blackguards did serve me the divil's own trick. 
Whin I 
wint in they put a 
big bag on my head, 
And rolled me around 'till I 
thought I 
was dead; 
Then they threw me down stairs with a 
terrible toss, 
And tould the police they had found Charley Ross.

HARDING, AIRMD Pub.., 220 Broiveir, 
Written and sung by FR&sit LEWIS. 
Also the DIG FOLTZ. 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go kirk on his friend; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface, 
The kind deeds which thro' life him attend: 
I 
hear the echo sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
I 
list to its voice—and it bids me rejoice,--
Then hurrah for the Minstrel rand I 
Then Hurrah! Then Hurrah! 
Then Hurrah for the Minstrel Band; 
I 
will speak first of one whom we lov'd in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger Would sate. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
The tall son of ' York, he has died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
He was the pride, the pride— 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood liks a 
Minstrel so trot), 
lin defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth, alas! broke his old Banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, ' till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding. 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
They 
and they died, with the boys that they , 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band! 
The dear boys! The dear boys! 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band 
'But now I 
must speak of the prince of them all,— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan! 
-Let ev'ry one mourn, for our Chieftain is gone, 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrel and Man. 
Let all his praises be sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud end char thro' the laud. • 
He liv'd and he died, both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band ! 
He was king! He was king! 
He was king of the Minstrel Band! 
There is also a 
name that is well known to Fame—

George Belmore, the Jockey so true! 
His last race is run, and the prize he has won; 
To the Judges his spirit it flew. 
I 
hear the people shouting, shouting, 
As the flying Scud rasses the Stand. 
The heat, it is run, the Gold cup is won, 
He has join'd the True Minstrel Band! 
He has joined, he has joine(1,

MUSIC Pub. by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery; N. Y. 
Sarah Smart is young and charming, 
Sarah Smart's the girl I 
love, 
Which I'm sure there is no harm in ; 
Though she thinks there is, by Jove 
For, when first I 
courted Sarah, 
Very much afraid was she, 
And all the more I'd try to square her, 
All the more she'd round on me. 
And when playfully I 
squeez'd her 
Little hand in mine, she said, 
That such liberties displeased her, 
So I 
squeezed her waist instead, 
Of course she tried to get away, 
But) held her while she did say— 
CHORUS. 
John, dear John, now do give over, 
Johnny, how you frighten me; 
How I 
wish you'd sail the seas over— 
Will you give over and let me be ? 
I 
said I 
loved her to distraction, 
Spoke to her old crusty dad; 
Gave him every satisfaction 
As to hOw much money I 
had. 
He 'Jaen gave me his permission, 
If I 
could, his child to wed;

Still, she would not,oalmlylistiR 
To the loving words I 
said: 
But blushed and murmured, 
"Cheese it, Mister !" 
As I 
held her in my arms; 
And if I 
but tried to kiss her, 
She was filled with dreadful qualms; 
She'd wriggle in my arms and cry,

let me go or I 
shall die. 
John, dear John, U r 
At last, one evening I 
did meet her, 
In a 
quiet retired spot, 
And I 
with a 
kiss did greet her, 
.Ere she'd time to tell me not. 
I 
then quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When.'

Soon great progress I

She would gladly marry me; 
So a

And my wife she'll shortly be. 
And since Kve named the happy day,

BANJO SOLO. 
As sung by ANDY Corzom, at TONY PASTOR'S, B'way, N. Y. 
There was a 
young man who never had his health, 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to bed, 
And soon he was fast asleep 
And to his surprise when he open'd up his eyes, 
He was turned to a 
big dead-beat. 
SPOREN.—That's the reason, Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
CHOr.US. 
For if you do, surely you'l rue it, 
Though strange to you it seems, 
For how funny you would look, all strung upon a 
hook, 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head, 
And she sent for her darling Lou ; 
She says go bring ma that same box of pins, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse when she sent for the nurse; 
After taking in a 
great big numbcr, 
When she looK'd in the glass she was.just as green as grass, 
She had turned to a 
big cucumber! 
For if you do, ttc. 
Now the old pussie cat was looking for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pIlls ; • 
She was loo:iiug all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
e'She thought they would cure all her ills ; 
But then the fun began when the cat began to run 
From the cellar clear up to the garret; 
And heody 
it turned to a 
barrel of sour lam% 
And hEr tail it turned into a 
carrot! 
SPOKM—As 
I 
said before, Lathes and Gentlemen— 
For if you do, (143.

Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh: she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
Cnonts. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
I've. only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark ; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor. 
And just then I 
could only remark_. 
The " Club" had, Arc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And s 
lid she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd Lit 1113 alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet litik kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOREN.—S0 I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
assure her once more : as a 
positive fact, that—

Way down in old Carolina, 
In good old Dixie's land— 
All among the cane, 
With a

There we'd join together; 
Old Massa he would bring' 
Kind Missi and the little ones, 
To hear us niggers sing.

He's always sure to holler out—

And you may.guess, when he is dress'd,-
, 
Of girls' he knows a

A 
Widow fell in love with him, 
While riding in a 
train; 
She had a 
blessed boy with her, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN. — Yes. the confounded young urchin (mused me 
a 
great deal of pain and sorrow, and the Widow, his 
Mother, introduced me as 'his Uncle? Fred Jones was 
never an Uncle before, and never will be again. not if he 
knows it! 
And the whole of the jouiney the Mother said 
to the,boy--
CHoaus. 
Tommy make room for your Uncle, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy make room for your Uncle, 
I 
want him to sit here ; 
You know Mamma has got a 
bun, 
And that she'll give to you; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your Uncle, do—do. 
When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The widow loved Romantic Scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry;

The mother told her loving Son, 
To watch the passing train; 
tut, no, he said, my Uncle Fred 
Will kiss your haud again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young elf ? 
SPOSEN.—Yes, it would never do to make love beforetha 
boy, and the Widow said— "

Just then we went under a

and she said—

I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue sew?

And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I

PULL DOWN THE BLIND. 
As sung by TONY PAFrou.7 
DID you ever make love? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ey'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless del:ght our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
cuouUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind, 
Though were alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pall down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
Mont one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing, we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to mak our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOK1M — And if that. soldier would only have left us alone,. 
she would never have exclahned: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
41 
One night, for a.change, we went to the play, 
&nd when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was. " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, Ler duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, •• 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankjul I'm blessed with a 
good little w:fe. 
SPoKUN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

With the lot 'fortune to them has doled; 
They're sure to find fault with the most trivial things 
And they alwa s

But its best to he cheerful and ha py like tite, 
And laugh all your troubles away. 
CHORUS. 
It's best to be cheerful and happy like me, 
It's best to be merry and gay, 
It's best to take things just the same as they Of 
And laugh all your troables away. 
Some grumble because things are not Lo their m!..1.4, 
And others at what they have got, 
Some grumble at trouble they've brought on themselce6 
And others at no matter what; 
They're always in trouble for trouble they make, 
And they meet trouble more than half way, 
But it's best to take things just the same as they come, 
And laugh all your troubles away. 
It' s 
best, loo. 
I've tasted misfortune in every way, 
Been kicked out of the house for the rerit, 
On? day I've had money and dress'il like a

And another day not worth a

But still I'm content as a 
king on his throne, 
And 
happy by night and by day,- — 
For I

PAIR PLAY. 
As sung by JOLLY NAM 
To do as you would be done by, is good advice, you'll own. 
Do everybody that you can, is a 
maxim better known. 
I 
do not envy other men live and let live, I 
say, 
The world is wide enough for all, if all could bave .fair play, 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't care'a pin what the world may say, 
I'm always rough and ready, and I 
like fair play. 
Give a 
man a 
fair chance, and stand out of the way, 
Fair play's a 
jewell, and I 
like fair 
How often in our law courts we see justice 'really blind, 
And many a 
poor man sent to jail whena rich man's orly 
fined. 
Their faults, perhaps, may be the same, but one the fine 
can pay. 
The other can't, so goes to jail, I 
don't call that fiir play. 
I 
don't care a 
pin, ice. 
Twixt masters and their workingmen good feeling we 
should like; 
Good masters make good workmen,"itis 'bad'dlies cause a 
strike ; 
And if they only give the men a'little higher pay 
When higher profits= they obtain. I 
should call that fair play. 
I 
don't care xpin, 
To get fair play for one and all then let us all combine. 
And now I 
think I'll make an end of this long song of 
mine; 
So join me in the chorus now before I 
go away, 
And let your motto always be, for one and all fair play.

And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I

I 
am growing old and weary now, my sight is getting dim. 
And my work on the earth is nearly done; 
Old massa has departed, I 
soon will follow him, 
And my friends have cross'd the river one by one. 
Oh, 'tis sad to bid good-by to all that was so dear, 
For I'll never see those good old times again; 
And I 
miss the happy voices that I 
fondly used to hear 
In my little old log cabin in the lane! 
Cnonus. 
Ah, yes, I 
am old and feeble now, my head is bend, 
ing low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the angels they will lead me, when my time has 
come to go, 
From my litle old log cabin in the lane! 
Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wander'd by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide 
Now 'tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I 
hear rpm the roof the falling rain; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made my heart so 
glad 
In the little old log cabin in the lane! 
Ah, yes, I 
am old and feeble, Scc. 
So I'll totter to my journey's end and try to do my best, 
Tho' I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest, 
In that bright and happy home so far awa,7. 
Still I 
linger by the door and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
&lid I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come 
along 
To my little old log cabin in the lane!

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the • thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and ruir resulting from once yie14-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. • 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in .'apt attention to the end.

THE APPRENtia4' 
Olt 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists 8c Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, cou.sists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural .' 
philosophy and cherniary in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the aboveWOrk. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now. as an old friendlreta 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, Calculation , 
of the power of machinery,' 
resistance to motion, strain ha material," ett..'.-3/ahigaitrer
, 
and _Wager; July, 1874. 
alThe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made seine Valuabis'additions to Areerican 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is athearetiCal treatise en Practical'thW. 
ehanics, designed to qupply a 
recognized deficiency.-- Most 
of the . Nycirks on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is Mit available to young men commencing as apprei-
ticesin shops'. 
Any young man with' a' fair'IthoWietigi' of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage 
it is 'not. 
only suitable for a 
text book but also • as a 
of reference: 
Meet' ambitious Young men. 
Will make them-, 
selves- so familiar with ita contents as to b utile tO (i
.efer 
readily to any portion of the book. ,The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish Anita of work from other IOW, 
which'is not'without wane,' r.nd might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitior.. works. 
The book'is Well 
printed on good white paper. an. 'ound in stiff cloth covers.
