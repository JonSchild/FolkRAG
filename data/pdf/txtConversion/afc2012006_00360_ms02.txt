March 2, 2012 Bay Houston Towing, Capt. Tom Tray 
Grew up in Iowa. Studied there. Got an appt with Kings Point Academy. Never seen the 
ocean before. Spent 4 years at King's Point. Spent one year at sea. Federal service 
academy. Requires congressional appt. Graduated in 1976. Went to sea for a few months. 
Then decided to stay on land. Decided to get a job. Alaska Pipeline. Jobs opened up for a 
lot of people. Decided to sail oil tankers, mostly on the Alaska route. Sailed as captain in 
1987. Got into war zone during the 1st gulf war. Came ashore in 1993. First job working 
logistics on the Tundra, in Russia. Was hired by a Norwegian company setting up office 
in Webster, TX. Was hired by El Paso; El Paso went south with Enron, closed ups hops 
and had to lay off all the employees. Bay Houston was looking for VP, applied and got 
job after Energy Houston.  
 
00:07:04 
Bay Houston was started by Capt. WD Hayden. Invented hydraulic clam shell dredge, 
started dredging oyster beds in Galveston bay. All roads in south East Texas, up until the 
1950s, were paved with oyster shells and not gravel. He also discovered that oyster shells 
make a good substitute in concrete for limestone. started a cement business - Hayden 
cement company. Had a large fleet of barges and tug boats. 1925, Houston Towing 
Company bought the Buffalo Bayou Dan Ryan Towing Company. Only tugboat company 
on Houston Ship channel, but competition came back. In 1934, G&H Towing Company 
was formed after merging all their assets and operations into a single company. Towing 
companies maintained ownership of tugs and marketing. Good Family run company. 
Members of the 5th generation are now running it. Family owns it since 1880s.  
 
00:13:31 
All discreet entities, the business do not articulate. Have a ranch outside Morksdale, TX. 
Can take customers there hunting. Cooperative spirit is unique to Houston. Spirit of 
cooperation in Houston is unique, Work together. The dredging done in Houston, is 
example of best in the country. When it was time to dredge the Port of Houston, all arms 
came together - industry, Galveston bay foundation, environmental groups came together 
and discussed and came up with a plan. Took the dredge spoils and rebuilt the islands that 
 
 
had been washed away over the years, as ships have gone past. Have managed to make 
Houston more competitive in terms of business at the Port.  
 
00:18:22 
One of the few tugboat companies whose crew is all union. They are part of the seafarer 
international union (SIU). Have gotten along since 1934.  Moved family from 
Connecticut to Houston. Been in Houston since 1989.  
 
00:21:35 
Tugboat companies in TX and LA are unionized. The reason they are not elsewhere is 
because of the labor strife in the mid 80s. Bitter union battle in the North East. 
Advantages are can get labor, disadvantages can’t get labor. Getting to be difficult to get 
qualified labor. Was not unusual, back then, to see a person who had very less education 
start off at the bottom and very soon get promoted to post of Captain. Very unusual to see 
that now. Recruiting heavily out of maritime academies. Advantages - excellent medical 
and pension plans. Bad - Have to go through contract negotiations every 2-3 years. Fairly 
strife free relationship for the last 77 years.  
 
00:24:00 
Combined fleet is 32 tugboats. 4th largest harvest tug fleet in the nation. youngest fleet in 
the nation. aggressive build program. Very progressive, safety oriented. Probably the 
most honest tugboat company in the US. EMD engines. Bollard pole. Cajun horsepower, 
more advertised horsepower. Different types of tugboats. Quality and power differences 
in tugboats. Z Drive favorite tugboats for captains. Starting building E end in 2005. 
Powerful class of tugboats called Z Techs. Built a particular type of tugboat keeping in 
mind the expansion of both the Panama canal and the Houston Ship channel. To help 
facilitate the bringing n of bigger ships.  
 
00:35:05 
Ships are the same, the only diff is slightly larger set of tankers. Tugboat requires more 
horsepower. Instead of steam, they are run on diesel. The tech to do things has changed.  
Have the most innovative, dispatching and tugboat logging compared to any other place 
in the US. Estimated the AIS transponders. Automated all the dispatching. Job comes in 
by email. Everything is set up with a touch screen. Tremendous improvement for 
efficiency. Have been able to go back and learn from mistakes.  
 
00:42:19 
Have to make sure the employee is well qualified. Cant take anyone off the streets, 
equipment is very expensive. Going form old conventional tug boats, to driving a new 
tugboats that are operated with joysticks has been a real pleasure. Kids who grow up 
playing video games very often prove to be good with driving the tugboat. 
 
00:45:35 
 
 
Older guys have seen it all before and know ways to get out of it. If they are on a new 
tech boat, wont know how to use the Tech to get out of it. Z drives are very 
maneuverable. Can get one in and out of trouble. Have not piloted any of the tugs. Have 
captained one of the fastest freights in history but license says am qualified to drive any 
gross tons upon ocean. But acc to US. Coastguard not qualified to drive the tugboats. 
Have a TOAR - Towing officers assessment rating - needs to be filled out for a tugboat. 
Need to be supervised by a tugboat operator for 3-6 months. Is a safety measure. A lot of 
regulations were added after the Queen Isabella and the I-40 accidents.  
 
00:48:12 
All tugs are names after the family members. All members of the Hayden family. 
Christenings are fun. Have been short and sweet. Have been to them since 1995. Three as 
guests and four with Bay Houston. Have held them at Bay Houston. After Ike, have held 
them at Pier 21. 
 
00:51:23 
Important things at a Christening are the prayer and breaking the bottle of champagne on 
the side of the side of the boat, by the person it is named after. The Greeks would pour 
olive oil, grain and wine over the bow. Seamen are very superstitious. Don’t like sailing 
in a boat that is not christened.  
 
00:53:08 
Tugboats for many years were just an engine and a propeller with a rudder on the end. 
Ballord is a great big piling on a dock. That model was working nicely until people 
started doubting the horsepower. In US, measure in pounds what a tugboat is pulling. 
Only tugboat company to pull and measure every tugboat in the fleet. Can change how 
much a tugboat pulls by changing the propeller etc. Have to play around a little till the 
right combination works.  
 
00:58:31 
Do it for certification, not a public demonstration. Have to get the ballord poles certified 
by a committee. It is a demonstration for the industry members. It is a way to ensure that 
they are doing what they say they will be doing.  
 
01:00:35 
5 tugs on Corpus Christi, 2 tugs in Freeport, remaining in Galveston Bay. One of the 
strengths of the company, can shift them depending on where they are needed. 2 of the 
largest ports are in the country are in Galveston bay, Houston is the biggest port in the 
US. More ships coming to Houston than anywhere else in the country. When the numbers 
come out for across the country, the ports are all listed as port complexes. Eg. New York 
New Jersey. New Orleans has 43 ports, but Galveston is listed as 3 ports. Skews the 
statistics and hurts when money needs to be dredged up. The Houston Port complex has 
 
 
43% more ships than anywhere else in the US. 9000 ships compared to 4000+ ships 
anywhere else.  
 
01:03:30 
Largest port in the US. Serve 3 of the 6 largest ports in the US Houston, Texas City and 
Corpus Christi. More economical for tugs to just dock and undock. Tie up the lines under 
the ship and tug it round or into position. Dock it in a slip, let the ship tie up and then 
leave. When they are ready to go, go help them out again. Provide an escort which is an 
extra rudder for the ship. ((Phone rings, Pause tape)) 
 
((RESUME)) 
All the company does is dock and undock and provide harbor services. Shift a ship from 
one port to another. Do not do offshore towing, Have a good harbor tug fleet. Area 
provide company and have contracts with a lot of people. Shipping world is fairly small, 
so ships that come in either have a contract with the company already or with the 
competitor.  
 
01:08:25 
Maritime education - are the largest port complex in the US. Back until 4 years ago there 
was no maritime education in any school or college. Changes in licensing have resulted 
in not being able to take kids off the streets and turn them into tugboat captains. Have 
tried to get school districts in the Houston area to acknowledge the existence of the port 
in Houston and create awareness. Did a career day in LaPorte Junior High, 4-5 years ago. 
Out of a 120 7th graders only 5 knew that there was a port in Houston. only 2 out 5 
teachers were aware of the port in town. Need to change that. Need to get awareness and 
change licensing regulations. Were able to take a kid of the street and get him a license in 
18 months. Lost that pipeline and things got desperate for a while. Have partnered with 
the Houston Pilots and the Port of Houston Authority. Port of Houston has sponsored to 
maritime academies in Austin high school and  Yates High school. San Jacinto college 
district has put together a Maritime program. Will build a Maritime and Technology 
Center. Have great courses already. Houston is leading the nation in Maritime education 
but still a lot more can be done. 2 years ago statistics show that 785,000 jobs were 
generated by the port.  
 
01:12:04 
9/11 has made many changes to access and availability of the port. Regulations were so 
tight couldn't go see tugs down at the dock. Biggest problem on the manning side was the 
coastguard's focus completely disappeared from licensing to security and for almost a 
decade just ignored the regulating side. Tugboats need to be regulated. TWIC card to 
even work on the tugboat. A lot of people that work on tugs are 3rd and 4th generation. 
Almost like a family job.  
 
01:15:09 
 
 
By partnering with the port of Houston Authority. Started recognizing around 2004 that it 
was getting difficult to crew the tugboats. Members of the Texas waterways Operators 
assoc. Made a proposal to them to set up an education committee to convince people to 
study and take up jobs at the port. In 2005 TWA set up a committee and headed it. 
Started with Galveston college and was a dismal failure. The East End Rotary Club 
expressed interest. Pilots have been active in this endeavor. Need to coordinate all the 
independent efforts into one effort.
