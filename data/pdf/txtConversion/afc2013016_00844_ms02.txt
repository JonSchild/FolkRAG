Introductions—Interviewer is Lucy Long. Interviewing Iryna Snyadanko 
(Spelling??), owner of Ukrainian Food and Deli, in Parma Heights, OH on Wed. April 16, 2015. 
00:00:30 
She was born in the Ukraine; came to US 13 years ago; came straight to Cleveland 
00:00:40 
Did you have experience with food work before you moved? 
Yes. Worked in a 
grocery store when she was around 20 years old. So had about 10 years of 
experience when she came to US. 
00:01:14 
Comparison of working in grocery store in the US verses the Ukraine. 
She believes it is easier in the US tax and inspection wise—those were very difficult at home, but 
it's harder because of the language difficulties [being in English], i.e. with the paper work. 
Came here with the goal to open own business and not to work for someone else. Planned on 
opening a 
food business. "Yes because ... If I 
want to open something I 
have to open what I 
know.... What business I 
know. What to do with that business. How to provide it. I 
would not 
go in like uh, how to show up [?] or something because I 
have no idea what to do with it. So I 
don't want to open a 
business for failing. I 
want to open for success. So I 
went to the industry I 
familiar with." 
00:02:43 
She did not have training with food businesses in Ukraine. That started in US with English and 
Hospitality management classes. Did a 
degree in Hospitality Management. Half classes were 
culinary classes. If took one more semester she could be chef, but that was not her goal. Goal 
was to open the store, not cooking. 
Chef at school was Czech. She uses the knowledge with the Czech cooking not in the store but 
for cooking at home. If had a 
restaurant, we would use that knowledge. Doesn't do any cooking 
for the store; sell all prepackaged things at the store. 
00:04:34 
Who makes the perogies and other baked goods for the store? 
Local bakeries that have license. Lots of people ask to sell their products, but they have to have a 
license. She feels bad that not selling her churches' perogies but can't because they don't have 
license. Wanted to make them in the store, but she doesn't have time for that. 
00:05:38 
Talking about opening a 
place like the Peirogie Palace, a 
fast food restaurant in Chicago. There 
is one in Willoughby, Ohio [another town on the east side of Cleveland]. 
00:07:22 
Do you feel like you have a 
social relationship with the bakeries that you use for your shop? Do 
you feel like there is an ethnic community? 
No. One is 3rd generation German the other is Ukrainian and they have a 
daughter born here; 
many of their recipes are adapted with American tastes. Many of their customers are American. 
00:08:30 
Do you feel like you are teaching Ukrainian culture through your store? 
Yes. People come in and see foods that they remember their grandmother making or see foods 
that they saw at a 
party. Sometimes people will ask questions about culture and country. "If 
people are interested I'm glad to help them." 
00:09:36 
Some people have to make changes to their foods to sell in the US, Do you change anything? 
No, most everything is made in the USA and they (The owners of those companies) are Eastern 
European and use the traditional recipes. They make things like she would taste them in the 
Ukraine. She likes to offer a 
variety so there is something for everyone. She gives as an example 
the different types of kielbasa they carry. 
She does try to sell some American things there too, such as American style salami, but 
discontinued it because nobody was really buying it. 
00:11:56 
Do you try to educate customers with signs in the store? 
"We do. We also give samples." Most people are willing to try the samples. Feels they have 
many loyal customers because of the sampling and explanation of the foods. 
00:12:52 
Are there any foods that you don't offer to the American customers because you don't think they 
would like them? 
Yes, for example, pork blood and tongue. She doesn't even like it herself! 
00:14:07 
Do you ever have customers that complain about the smell or anything like that? 
Not the smell, but they are grossed about the whole fish. They refer to the whole fish as a 
dead 
fish. She jokes about just having fish filets swimming in ocean, since customers don't recognize 
reality. 
Have you ever had a 
thing like that happen and you felt insulted? 
Yes, it happens quite often. For example: Some older gentlemen came in and asked what the 
place was. She responded with Ukrainian grocery store, and they asked if that was like barbarian. 
She tries not to be arrogant, but she also feels she needs to put people in their place to let them 
see how their comment was offensive. They did come back and were nice after that. 
00:16:39 
She put sup maps of Ukraine in the store, because people couldn't figure out where it was. 
00:17:48 
Do you have people who challenge the food as real ethnic Ukrainian food? 
Her response is that there are 500 recipes to make borscht; and each individual is probably using 
their grandmothers' recipe as their standard. Also, every region has its own recipe. 
00:19:24 
Do you always use English as the language here? 
All the girls that work there are Ukrainian, so she speaks Ukraine to them, but English to English 
customers, Ukraine to Ukraine customers, Polish to Polish customers, Russian to Russian 
customers. She has tried to learn some Romanian for the few Romanian customers that come in. 
One of the requirements to work there is to speak fluent Ukrainian because there are some people 
that come in that are not very efficient with English, so she tries to speak to them in their native 
language. 
00:21:11 
Is the grocery store like a 
community center? 
Yes. They have a 
communication board that people can post events, advertisements, jobs, selling 
or buying items. People can meet at the store, and they accidentally bump into people they know 
here. 
00:23:34 
Do you think about creating and keeping community among the customers when making 
business decisions? 
In the beginning it was about making money but recently they started supporting about 5 
churches. Example--for Easter, send Easter bread and kielbasa to the churches. They also help 
people with information about living in the US; try to advise people to avoid the problems they 
ran into when they were getting established in the USA. 
00:25:17 
Long hours that she works at the store-- 12 hours a 
day. 
00:25:25 
Discussion about her family. She has 2 
boys—ages 21 and 10. She doesn't get to see her family 
much, but they and her husband also help out at the store. 
00:25:58 
Interview conclusion.
