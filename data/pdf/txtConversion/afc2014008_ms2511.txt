Bess, this must have been a terrible few months for you
 
I don't s

an possibly sound so calm and collected
 
in the letters you write.  If anything like that had happened
 
to us I am s

Dear Bess,
 
We just saw the notes you wrote for the
 
Capitol record.
 They are by far the best I
 
have read.., and I am so happy.
 A sense
 
of perspective that is much needed in these
 
things.
 
I howled at "
 his ap artment"l
 Chicken?
 
Work goes on as usual here.
 Saw Alan once
 
since he got back and he looks very well and
 
seemed quite satisfied with his trip to the
 
Soviet Union.
 
Love to all,

IT 
Dear Bess -
 this belated letter is to tell you
 
that I simply scrawled that note Vo you when visiting Martha
 
-
chiamme last winter, and had no idea that someone else in LA
 
as already handling I
ter bookings. I forwarded your letter to
 
er, and I hope she wrote you. 
I It looks like I myself will -be heading our your way again
 
his September. In spite of all the headaches, do you think
 
ou would be interested in arranging things again? If not (and
 
I could well understand that it wouldn't be worth all the
 
bother for you) do you know someone who would have time to do
 
it?
 
Reading the headlines these days must take you back to
 
1942-43 in Detroit. Things have changed a lot there. But it
 
would be interestin g to go  bac k aga
in
.  
Have finally got that movie camera working, and am starting
 
this summer on that project of photographing instrumental
 
techniques. Will let you know progress,
 
love to all the f
an

MR. SEEGER.  I feel that in my whole life, I

the implication of being called before this

may be different from yours, or yours, Mr.

, 1961
 
Pete Seeger:
 
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. After hearing myself
 
t
alked about, p

 am g
rateful
 
f
or t

F
irst, I
 s
hould l

p

l
ong weeks and months, knowing t
hat i

im adequately f
or h

 b
elieve t

S

r s
up-
ported, o
r s
ung anything i
n any way s
ubversive o
f my
 
country. Congressman Walter s
tated t
hat he was i
n-
v
estigating a conspiracy. I
 s
tated under oath t
hat I
 had
 
n
ever done anything conspiratorial. I
f he doubted my
 
word, why d
idn't he e
ven question i
t? Why d
idn't he
 
have me i
ndicted f
or perjury? Because, I b
elieve, even
 
h
e knew t
hat I
 was s
peaking t
he t
ruth.
 
Some o
f my ancestors were r
eligious d
issenters who
 
c
ame t
o America over 300 y
ears a

i
eve t

 do no d

o t
hose who may come a

I
 am 42 y
ears o

ery l
ucky man.
 
I have a wife and t
hree healthy children, and we l
ive
 
i
n a house we built with our own hands, on t

o

The House committee wished t

"

The o

He t

popularized  v
ia  h

lso
 
got  t

In an e

Seeger  does  everything h

Though Seeger  does not
 
write most o
f t

s

ocks  back  and
 
f
orth on h
is heels and puts
 
f

which c
atches t

utored,  e
arnest  emotions,
 
both happy and s

p
letely without p

There may have been a
 
h
int o
f melancholy over t
he
 
t
rial i
n Seeger's voice a
s he
 
described  why people  s
ing
 
f

 "Some

aid,  "because
 
t

Hobo p

Then he began s
inging i

howed t
hat,  mel-
ancholy or not, he had f
elt
 
a

began wandering a
round t

inging during t

1
930s.  There  were  mourn-

laints o
f t
he hobo who
 
i
s  "goin'  down  t

eelin'  bad",  and  derisive
 
t
aunts  a
t  t
he  daughter  o
f
 
t
he  r
ailroad  mogul,  Jay
 
Gould. And t
here were h

arious  s

about a man who got t
he
 
t
own o
f "yakkety yak" i
nto
 
hysterics  over  a s

made up about a f

But t

Today, Seeger denies t
hat
 
t
he s
ongs he s
ings r
epresent
 
h
is  personal  opinion  p
re-
c
isely. After t
he concert, he
 
explained "
I s

Consequently
 he

duced  an  a

uneless,
 
b

f a s
hare-
c
ropper's wife a

"

a good j
ob a

f I
 
hadn't done s

aid.
 
But t
he l
arge number o
f
 
s
ongs on t
opics i
n t
he cur-
r
ent  news  belied  complete
 
detachment on t
he part o
f
 
t

s
 
obviously  keenly  i
nvolved
 
with t
he problems  o
f  d
is-
a
rmament  and  c
ivil  r
ights.
 
And s
o he s
ang about t

about how "

s a hush
 
s
ettled  on  t
he  c

s
ang a f
amiliar s
ong about a
 
f
amiliar l
onging:
 
"

I

To put an end t

His c

Of  course  t

t
opic most heavily on See-
ger's mind, perhaps i
ntensi-
f
ying h
is o
ther concerns, i
s
 
t
he "Seeger c
ase" and i
ts im-
p
lications.
 
In 1

I
n March o
f t

f
ederal court j
ury convicted
 
Seeger o
f contempt o
f Con-
g
ress, and he was s
entenced

e-
c
ision was appealed  imme-
d
iately, and Seeger i
s now
 
out on bail until t

At t

d

I have never i

A c

As he s

ays.

 The  audience  ap-

ntroduced
 
a s
ong "made up a couple o
f
 
years ago when people were
 
getting t
hrown i

a
sked courageously: a

ong
 
a

I
f Pete  Seeger's  l
oyalty
 
i
s s
eriously i

haps i
t was s
ignif
icant t
hat
 
most o
f t

were  American  f
olksongs.
 
He has t
aken s

s
ays,  t

might well have added, "
to

emind u

But he s
ays "nice a

Dear Bess -
 many thanks for letter. A
 
day after it arrived came one from
 
iax Krone which you have seen in carbon
 
wrote to thank him for expressions of
 
confidence, and intimating that "if the
 
opportunity presents itself, this year
 
or any other, to attend Idyllwild in
 
any capacity I would jump ati the
 
chance. '
 
If, in a quiet way, it seemed that
 
my not be&ág XX there would cause too
 
much trouble, perhaps I could come out,
 
even for reduced fee.
 
The key is, '
in a quiet way', tnough
 
it seems to me. The general balance of
 
forces is not yet that in which a
 
large scale battle  c
an be won on this
 
field. The laws of cultural guerilla
 
tactics, in other words, would still
 
hold: keep in mind that we have few
 
reserves and they have many, and i
t
 
s more important for us to keep from
 
getting so bloody that we can't fght
 
again. Rather: pick battles that we
 
.eel- we can win.
 
What do you think?
 
How do people cause  j
uiet troub T
h?
 
I
' l
l say this: that I
'll keep those
 
dates completely clear, and if even at
 
the last moment anybody can even pay
 
my fare out and back, I think I
'd try t
 
make it. I
'd been looking forward to
 
Idyllwild. It sounded like a wonderful
 
place. I
'll not deny I
'm disappointed.
 
Wohderful that Butch is working on
 
the Frog. Met a good film editor who
 
eald he would like to help on the
 
cutting if possible. If I come out
 
this summer, this would be the ideal
 
t
ire to film it/

FOR PETEtS SAKE !
 
Special Bulletin  issued by Friends of Pete Seeger
 October 1961
 
Because of the many inquiries regarding the present sta-
tus of the PETE SEEGER CASE, we are issuing this special
 
bulletin at this time.  However, in preparation is a six
 
page printed BULLETIN, which will report the case more
 
fully and other news of great interest from all over the
 
world in response to the case.  This BULLETIN will short-
ly be off the press and sent to you.
 
PETE SEEGER APPEAL TO BE HEARD IN MARCH OF 1962
 
Mr. Paul L. Ross, attorney for Pete Seeger, has advised us that
 
the appeal for Pete will be heard before the United States Court
 
of Appeals in New York City during the month of March 1962.  Ori-
ginally this hearing was scheduled for December of 1961.  At pres-
ent Pete remains out on bail ($2000) and is free to continue his
 
concert schedule all over the country.
 
If the ruling of the Appeals Court upholds the conviction,  the
 
case will then immediately be submitted for a hearing before the
 
United States Supreme Court.  If such is the case,  it may take
 
the Supreme Court up to six months from the time the appeal i
s
 
made to them to review the case.
 
PETE LEAVES FOR ENG LAND FOR CONCERT TOUR
 
On October 12th, Pete, his wife Toshi and their youngest daughter
 
left for England for a one-month concert tour of the British Isles.
 
He will return to New York towards the end of November.
 
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FOR PETE COMES IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
 
Hundreds and hundreds of letters and messages have been sent to
 
Pete and to the Friends of Pete Seeger, from all over the world,
 
and from people of all walks of life,  in support of Pete s case.
 
With these letters have come thousands of dollars to help pay
 
for the legal costs.  This great response has come without the
 
efforts of any organization and has been a magnificent spontaneous
 
response on the part of so many people who feel a great disservice
 
has been done to American democracy by the jail sentence imposed
 
upon Pete.  The next BULLETIN will contain excerpts from some
 
letters and a report of activities on behalf of Pete.

described  why  people  s

Today, Seeger denies t

But t

And s

I
n March o
f t

f
ederal court j
ury convicted
 
Seeger o
f contempt o
f Con-
g
ress, and he was s

At t

I have never i

He has t

s
ays,  t

might well have added, "
to

But he s
ays "nice a

Dear Bess,
 
At present it looks as though I shall not be able
 
to get out to Los Angeles before next September.
 I
 
will be going to-
 midwest and
 couple of other short
 
trips in between now and June. 'But since it looks as
 
though  I will be here most of the summer, I guess
 
we will have to plan it for next September or october.
 
Hpwever, you can tell the people at the nursery
 
schools that I am extremely interested in the idea
 
that they had and I would be glad to discuss it in more
 
detail on the assumption that I will be able  o get
 
out tere s:reti -n

rby
 due March 4th.
 She is well and
 
I had intended to turn down all bookings for February
 
and March in order to be here.
 However, next week I
 
fly out to Oregon for a one shot deal at the University
 
of
 regon which I couldn't afford to turn down.
 
Here the Columbia series was concluded successful1y
 
and Toshi and I have had printed up a whole batch of i
'i
 
brochuresA  I don't think that I have sent you a copy
 
but at any rate we intend to circulate them around
 
colleges and see if I can't get a few more college
 
bookings which will make it more practical to tour  the
 
country.
 
I hadh't heard anything about it being
. diff icult
 
to clear Lomax copyright material for TV and radio.
 I
 
thought Mac Millan was doing it and that It all want
 
automatically though either it or BNI or one of the other
 
bi: companies.
 
Sorry I won't be out sooner,
 
Love from us both to all of

to Rumania several times and had v

I played the tpe recorded c

so you could put in all in still another cardboard box.
 
Enclosed with this envelope is enough postage to c

 :
 
use the same s

can use that over.  Also am enclosing labels etc.  (

Tcshi is typing from the tape machine.. HE REALLY must want

It all iced up here for ab ut a eek and we couldn '

even the truck up.  That melted off for a day and here comes th
 
snow.  Ofcourse Peter was away from all this most of the time..
 
Too bad cause he loves the ice and snow but I have gott n so I
 
could do without it most of the time. The family here are all fine..
 
Tinya(the new one) looks more like she should be yours than mine.
 
Her hair is getting redder, her eyes still blue but the shape at

 Peter poils her.. as does the whole family.  But  as

Dear Bess -  
By now I hope Sid Fox has called you. Toshi and I decided it
 
was impractical to try to come 4  to the West Coast this spring
 
after all, for several reasons. Now I only hope that you have
 
not been put to too much unnecessary trouble.
 
The several reasons included the fact that
 really been away
 
from home too much this year already....been touring in the midwest
 
almost constantly the last two months, seeing the family home
 
for an average of one day a week most of which time I was too
 
busy recuperating to really enjoy the family.
 
Second, your trenchant comment:
 afraid you're hitting just the
 
same old audience again and again" struck home. In addition, since
 
it is so late in the spring that most colleges are closing 
.
... 
well,
 
putting all reasons together, we- called Sid Fox and explained things.
 
We also set down and planned out next fall as well as possible, so
 
that I could be in LA or thereabouts from Oct 2 through 7
. This
 
friend in Detroit did such a good job of coordinating midwest bookings
 
this year, that I figured I
'd give him names and addresses for the
 
West Coast, and let him manage the details. His name is Paul Endicott,
 
30532 Sheridan, Garden City, Mich., in case anyone asks you how to
 
contact me about October.
 
In spite of the rush, this has been an interesting yur, I confess. I
'll
 
not deny it's been gratifying to find myself able to draw larger
 
crowds and in a greater variety of placer than I ever did before. This
 
is carrying out the basic idea that in general we must all reach out
 
more than ever -
 get out of the corner -
 break down the walls that
 
some would like to hedge us in with. Mixed metaphor.
 
I don't know if I ever told you: what made up my mind on this
 
point was the ALP in '
49 asking W
 Irwin Silber to help them line
 
up a concert series. He suggested my name among others. They said "Oh,
 
we know Pete, of course. He's an old friend. But we want to reach
 
out to a broader audience."
 
That decided me. If after all those years, being satisft
hed that I
 
had never bothered takéng the commercial road, I was not as useful
 
to the ALP as Dick Bennett (whom they wanted to get) -
 then I was
 
wrong.
 
We tried one tack with the Weavers. Between our own mistakes and
 
the McCarthyites we didn't do the job completely right, but it was a
 
step.
 
Now is a new period, though. I
've sung dUring the last couple
 
months at s
everal dozen colleges (Wise., Rich. Okla., Northwestern,
 
Oberlin, Antioch, Western Reserve, etc) Churches and Y
's and Community
 
Centers.  Incidentally, the Weavers we reunite again briefly for a
 
M KJ6Y1 Yt 1f r week of concerts in May.
 
With all this, however, I don't figure on trying to try to
 
be a Star Personality, as the traditional solo career usually
 
works out to be. Rather, I would hope that my visit might be
 
responsible for bringing kindred spirits together who might not have
 
known each other previously. Or might demonstrate new ways to
 
create music.
 
Well, enough of my problems. Your report of concerts at UCLA and
 
City College was very interesting. Similar things are going W
 on
 
in Chicago, NY, and a couple dozen other cities on a smaller scale
 
of course). The whole revival of folkmusic has reached a whole new
 
level, it seems t9 . 1
e.
 
Too bad Alan i Ahere
 to participate in it. Too bad especially
 
since he was so largely responsible for getting it started.
 
Give my very best to Odetta. Zak Guy and Noel to let us know
 
when they pass through NYC so we can see them even if briefly.
 
Your article on guitar teaching comes out in Sing Out this month.
 
It's circulation is gradually rising, but not fast enough. Some
 
big changes may have to be made - but which? No one is quite decided,
 
certainly not me. Do you use the magazine at all? -°
 
Incidentally, do you see the English magazinelet '
Sing'? Reminds
 
one of People's Songs in its early days. Lots of things going on there.
 
In Canada, too, many good things.
 
In general, it is as though many of the things we tried to
 
get started ten years, or fifteen years ago, are gradually coming
 
to pass, with a whole new generation of youngsters.
 
One other thing, before I close: Tosh and I are taking the
 
whole summer off from other work in order to concentrate on the
 
movie project (which has perforce lain dormant through the
 
winter,). Even before the banjo movie is completed, or any of the
 
other short subjects, have to edit down some 25 minutes of 1U1Y
 
shots I took in Trinidad in January, describing how to make a steel
 
drum. I
've quite fallen in love with the instrument. Bought six
 
drums: Z one bass, two tenors (
'guitar pans' they are called) one
 
alto (
'2nd pan') and two sopranos (
'ping pongs', or 1st pans)with
 
24 notes each. As soon as warm weather comes I think I can make
 
'
em myself. At the moment we still have eight inches of snow
 
on the ground. Plus mud and slush. What an Apr i
l
 
Anyway, I
'll write you further about the steel drums. I feel
 
it' s got a tremendous future as a teenage instrument. Fills a gap
 
left vacant since the fife and drum corps, or the bagpipe band. Easy
 
for amateurs. Needs no amplification, therefore ideal for outdoor
 
march i
ng or dancing. Cheap to make. Can be played in all weathers,
 
even with mittens on. Limited in tonal range a
,nd timbre, but these
 
very limitations become in the end XKI( some of
t  he main reasons why
 
it is a great folk instrument.
 
all for now
 
PS - reason I wanLed Sunday night free was so I could get more chance to
 
see you and Butch and the kids.
 
I
 
Dearest Bess,
 
Terribly sorry that I didn't get t
his off s
ooner.  But it has
 
been rather a mess here.  12 days ago we had our first snow. Three
 
days later we had another and from then (
the big one was the third)
 
on I haven't been able tp g
et home.  Yestreday was the first day that
 
I g
ot the truck with chains and low gear up the hill and plowed down.
 
There had been drifts up to 6
 feet on the soad and a
ll around the
 
house.  Peter was touring and so again missed the big snow.  In 4
7 we
 
were in LA.  Had to toboggan the tape machine, typeqriter etc. off
 
and ofcourse f
orgot to bring the address file down.  Fr a
nkly was afraid
 
to death that i
t would spill and I would have a mess on my hands.
 
School closed d
own and I had a couple of very bored children who were
 
mad qs hops that Papa wasn't here cause Mama is no good when i
t c
omes
 
to pulling s
leds up and down mountaini.
 
We are in our third day of Easter vacation and there is still
 
two feet of snow on the ground.  Parts of it only a f
oot.  They 3
ay
 
that another s
torm in brewing.  Can't  you imagine the easter parade
 
in a s
now
f,
 
Now about business. Sidney Fox on the phone the other day said
 
It
hat they wanted Peter.  i mk
pm said Ok with the stipulation that
 
he gets $300
 plus fare for the two days.  And told him that I hadn't had
 
a chance to talk it over with you.  He agreed.  If I can get him a
 
booking in San Francisco and/ or Portland it would bring the fare down,
 
to one way plus s
ome or a
ll of the plane trip to San Francisco.
 
This has been a c
razy year.  We had expected bookings to fall off
 
after the testimony last s
ummer.  Instead they grew.  Peter has been
 
s
olidly booked from the 15th
 of January until this weeked that Sid wants.
 
Paul Endicott, whè has been handling Peters midwest bookings has been
 
doing quite a g
ood job.  Many colleges that he had not been into before
 
plus higher fees.., than Peter has ever dared ask.  But i
t has made it
 
necessary to stick to a higher minimum and take benfite.  Locally Peter's
 
min i
mum i
s $100.00 g
oing up according to the occasion and college etc.
 
budget.  Sh I don't know whether Peter has ever had the time to talk
 
about these things but I
 thought that you probably would like to know
 
what i
s g
oing on booking—wise at this end.
 
In the last week I have had s
o many requests for next year that
 
I hope to have a minute to talk to Peter and get a chance to evaluate
 
what work he wants to do and where we Mre heading for.  It isn't just
 
i
ndividual bookings but managers and people who want to sign h
im up
 
f
or s
eries etc.  It i
s one thing =mob when a charitable organization
 
books you for $100 and makes  five hundred or more on you, but another
 
when a g
uy books you into a s
eries and keeps the remainder.  Some kind
 
of percentage deal should be made in this case, I should t
hink.  Locally
 
I h
ear tell that Peter has become a "hot
 and I guess everyone wants
 
a piece if they c
an g
et i
t.  Nothing e
specially wrong,, except that
 
eventually we don't know whether we are coming or goingl
 
Plus the Weavers are doing concerts againi  And somehow  that
 
takes time.
, planning,
. rehearsals and no conflicts.  Why don't you c
ome
 
eqst and take over?  We c
ould all sit on the hill .
. get a baby sitter,
 
look at the s
unset  and f
orget about the whole thing.
 
Back to business again:
 
a
 
Peter s
aid (
on the tape machine) t
hat he wanted Sunday evening
 
free to s
ee you and other dhrfriends.. I don't �mow Khether he wants
 
just a s
ocial visit or whether there are things that he wants to discuss
 
and/ or hear about.  That would leave Saturday afternoon q Saturday
 
evening free,
 Since this would be the last weekend of four and half
 
months of c
ontinous singing ,
 Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon
 
would be better.  Don't you think that Peter has enough following by
 
now i
n IA to g
et them all under one roof?  Maybe not.
, I don't know.  Here
 
they can pack 1000 or more to the rafters without too much trouble.
 
Also he c
annot leave until noon Friday and I am just presuming that
 
there i
s a flight that g
ets him t
here by Sat. afternoon*
 
SidneJF Fox also s
aid t
hat he didn't want a children's thing to
 
c
onflict with their thing on Sunday Af
ternoon.  f
f
i
dm6m Because of this
 
desire f
or no conflicts and because he wanted an answer before I had
 
had a chance to discuss i
t with you, was t
he reasonihat I more or less
 
made him responsible f
or the feels.
 
In the next month we w
ill decide what week Peter will spend in
 
or around LA next fall.  I
 would like to have a definite tour schedule
 
s
et up now.
, amh so that anyone who wants him has plenty of time to
 
arrange things,  Also it looks like Peter will be booked so far in
 
advance that s
ome s
ort of s
chedule will have to be s
et up.  Inclusing time
 
h
omel  He has s
pent less thati a day home s
ometimes in the last few
 
months*  When he has spent one full or more days .,
 thay have had to be
 
s
pent entirely at the dictating machine..
 
Also, we got the record I hope safe and s
ound.  Peter is taking
 
i
t down to Moo's to open there when they tape it, s
o that there isn't
 
any chance of it's breaking.
 
Love all around.. I got a letter from a friend in Paris who had
 
run into Alan.. l
ie s
eemed to be well.. Peter hears now and agiin but
 
they are usually notes to the point.. of whatever he is writing about.

 came across some and thoughthat Corey woUld
 
g
et a kick out of herself and Danny •  Didn't d
are show i
t to
 
D
anny though!  My son's figure sure has changed.
'
 
Alah c
ame up for a weekend before Peter left,  He l
ooked very well..
 
with beard etc, and was exactly the s
ame a
s eight years ago.  I f
eel
 
a
s if I had aged about twnety years to his one.  I am not quite sure
 
what he tho ght of me... besides telling that I
 was attacking him all
 
the time (
 not physically I hope.. I think he must have meant mentally)..
 
rather verbally) I didn't realize I was but I do rem
 disagreeing
 
with him about various people and instances he brought up.  Certainly
 
didn't mean i
t as an attack but  just a
s expressing how I f
elt about
 
whatever i
t was.  So unimportant that I n't even remember.  The c
th r
 
thing was that out of a clear sky while I was driving him to the  :
 
bar for cigarettes, he said 0 Why do you try to distroy those whore
 
you ]
.ove?"Since he had on  been in the house a few hours and I h
a
 
not a
s yet annihilated (
spelling) anyone I s
aid I didn't r
ealize I wa..
 
and I
 was promptly af
tl analyzed to the extent of the drive to the bar.
 
Since Danny was away with my father and Mika i
s a dream when he i
sn't
 
around to get on each other's nea ves  and thence mine There was only
 
poor Peter.  Now I am not e
specially in awe of Peter and as long a
s
 
we work on various projects together I f
eel like I c
an put my two
 
c
ents in as well as he. • 30 I argue and he has come around to agr
 .
ng
 
ith me that s
ome of the projects have been better in the long run
 
f
or the arguing., not because I am right but because we can each gt
 
a clearer picture that way (
he usually gets his way.. ut since we f
e E
.
 
things differently  this way we c
an see more than one side). I admit
 
I
 have a sharp tôngue but sometimes that i
s the only way I can penetr
 
that one track mind of Peter's.  If he gets his mind on s
ometing the ho.: e
 
would blow up and he would still be sitting there thinking.
 
Oh well, this i
s all incase Alan over writes that I am a horror. I a
cLnit
 
I am a part horror but I really don't V
hink i
t is any of his business.
 
We must have parted on good terms cause after Peter left he called  p to
 
get the name of a girl I knew and to a
sk me to dinner if I ever g

Did you see the Times today.. he g

Dear Bess,
 
Max Krone just told us about the mixup with Brownie.  I c
ertainly
 
feel bad and will try and talk with hi
r
t as s
oon a
s he gets back
 
east.
 
Peggy and Ewan McColl just s
ent us a long t
ape recording of some
 
peace s
ongs.  Some of them s
eem to good that I
 want to even
 
wait for "Sing Out" to print them.  Therefore, enclosed are a couple
 
copies.  Perhaps you know of s
ome people in Los Angeles who could
 
put them to use.
 
Butch:  Moe Asch was very interested to hear of the progress you have made
 
on the frog movie and was anxious to know if we had any kind of a schedule
 
for completion on it or any kind of a budget.  Since you are now so far
 
along ,  do you think it would be practical for you to write h
im and make
 
some definite proposals?
 
One last note.  I wonder i
f you c
ould turn over in your mind to s
ee
 
if there are any possibilities you know of for articles or songs which
 
c
ould be used by "Sing Out" •
 I
 am trying to give them as much materi. I
 
as possible during the next month so there will be no danger of shortages
 
later on in the winter.  The circulation i ,ti U going up and I feel
 
pretty good about the prospects for the
 tie of it, whether or not
 
"Sing Out " c
ontinues exactly as it is or whether .
L
% eventual l
y any kind
 
of change was made.
 
Hope all the f
amily is well and
. thriving.  We got home two weeks ago after
 
a fine trip t
kt
hough national parks.  We were full of waterfalls, bears,
 
deers, moose e

I think p
erhaps the best thing is  for people to actually
 
iced the hearing, of 1955 and l
et then make up their own minds about it,
 
without me trying to go into elaborate explan ticna of  why I answered
 
some questions -
-
 such as my name and address -
 but refused to answer
 
other questions such as who did I know, and where and when did I ever
 
s
ing.  In these hearings I stated that I didn't went to cast any asper -
sions on neople
. who had used the Fifth Amendment; I simply did not
 
fool that I wanted t
o use it myself,  As my lawyer has explained it to
 
me, using the Fifth Amendment is in effect saying "you have no right to
 
ask !
2  this question", but using the First means in effect '
you have
 
no right to ask a
ny
 Amorloaq,
 such questions.  3
1nce I felt I was in a
 
strong enough position to make a breeder attiok upon the committee. I
 
chose, in effect, the second oe'n'se...,....
 
In an tnter 1e't; a couple o
:' weeks  po with a professor
 
from Southern California who is making a detailed study of my case and
 
ethers like it, I was asked "do you think that Co n
gress does net have
 
any right to have inyest
atir
i#r
, ooini teee of any sort?".  Naturally,
 
I had to agree that Congress does htve a right to investigate things,
 
and some of its investigations have been extremely important and have
 
brought out things which the norrs1 investigative bodies do net bring
 
out, such as the Teapot Dome scandal and the La Follette f
indings on
 
the labor spy racket.  Hewover, when Congress invedtigates somethi n
g,
 
it is quite a different thing f
rom having a perennial junket to expose
 
perfectly leg i activities.  3un
.,D
osinm there were a few Congressmen
 
who thought that all cli con anies were run by a bu
nch of creeks,
 
and they kepTup every aii
la year s
ince Tea pot Dome a running investi-
gation where they could call  he executives of any oil company on the
 
stand and, by asking them pei ed questions with no chance for rebuttal,
 
n
iake it a
ppear that they w*ró engaged in shady business practices.
 
Supposing even that following the La P
'ellett, investigation, there was
 
a perennial investigation into the use of
 detective agency. New, it
 
is perfectly legal to run detective agencies, but a perennial committee
 
could make i look as though any detective agency was literally a labor
 
spy racket.
 
In effeot  this is what the un'.Amerioen activities con.
 
mitt.. has been doing for twenty-five years now.  Under the pretense of
 
investigating conspiracy, they
- have actually bo
on in the perennial busi-.
 
mesa of exposing heresy -
-
 that Is, exposing to the public v
iew • all the
 
na m
es they can possibly get of a
nyone who over had anything to do with
 
any s."oa Ued radical organization, however legal this organization
 
might have b
een.  This, to my mind, is a complete distortion .f the o.r
 
riot prioticee and the legal practices of Co n
gress.  And my best defense,
 
frankly, is a bard-hitting offense to try and put this committee out of
 
business.  7t'a hurtling all of us -
-
 it's hurting Americas and the world.
 
In other words, it's net enough to simply try and o1 Im "Pete is inn.oent
 
I'm no more innocent than any other noraai sinful human being. However,
 
this counIttee is harmLng America, and the sooner we get rid of it, the
 
bitter.
 
Pc understand why it is harmi n
g America is difficult and
 
o
en'e be done in two or three words.  The newspaper headlines of 1itera1l
 
decades have to be rebutted.  Perhaps the beat way they can be rebutted
 
is to tell a detailed anc  spec
ific story about one person*  It this one
 
person has to be me, why then I guess I am perfectly willing to have
 
it told.  This is why I usually preface any statement about this trial
 
with quoting what I toic  the committee and what I told the judge
 
namely, "I have never done anything conspiratorial in my life nor sung
 
anything nor supported anything conspiratorial in any way."  This 1
.
 a a
 
very bread statement to make.  The committee claims to be 1n eatigating
 
conspiracy.  They had witnesses who claimed that I was a member of or-
ganizations and had supported organizations which they claimed to be
 
conspiratorial.  1ither the committee should indict these witnesses
 
for p
erjury or should indict me for perjury, or else the committee it-
self is lying, and the question is net one of conspiracy but heresy.
 
The tact that neither Congressman Walter or ludgo Murphy
 
questioned this statement (quoted in the above paragraph -
 B.H.)
 
to me exposes the tact that they knew they are not really investiga-
t
ing conspiracy.  They have got to be put on the spot and forced t
o
 
admit this basic fraud.  In America one does not have the right to
 
conspire to overthrow the government by force and v
iolence without
 
getting thrown in jail for it.  But  i
merioa has been oroud that you
 
have a perfect legal right to believe in heresy of whatever form y
ou
 
want as long as this does not include any overt act which mould be il-
l
egal.  These guys have simply get to be  ,
Inned down and made to prove
 
what overt acts that are illegal have been committed.  Congressman
 
Walter has a nerfeotly gaod right to proclaim his belief that certain
 
ideas are harmful to America, but he has absolutely no r
ight to go un-
challenged with his cl aim that these beliefs are illegal and conspira-
torial and un- merIcan.
 rice has plenty of room for t uit heresies.
 
It mould not be such a Food country without them.

FRIENDS OF PETE SEEGER
 
Harold Leventhal
 200 West 5

 New York,19, N.  Y.
 
April 1961
 
Dear Friends:
 
Many people throughout the country;  friends, fans and admirers of
 
Pete Seeger, have been anxious to give their support in whatever effort
 
is needed to help Pete.
 
The lawyers handling the case have already made an  appeal to a higher
 
court, which will hear the appeal sometime in October.
 Failing in this
 
instance, a further appeal will be brought before the United States Su-
preme Court.
 In the meantime, Pete remains out on bail and will con-
tinue his regular concert appearances throughout the country.
 
A group of us are now organizing the FRIENDS OF PETE SEEGER whose main
 
purpose will be as follows
 
1
)
 To issue literature stating the facts behind this case--why Pete
 
did not answer the Un-American Committee, as well as such information
 
that would present background material of the issues involved,
 
2
)
 To publicize this case and the principals behind it and to gain as
 
much public support as possible in all sections of the country.
 
3
)  To help Pete with the necessary monies for the legal expenses
 
incurred in this case and the monies needed for the appeal.
 It is esti-
mated that it can cost $15,000 to see it up to the Supreme Court.
 Dona-
tions should be made payable to: Harold Leventhal and sent to the above
 
address,
 
i
i
-
)
 To encourage people to form FRIENDS OF PETE SEEGER in their cities.
 
We in New York would be glad to be of help wherever possible.
 We want
 
to coordinate such activities with New York as the center.
 
Just as soon as the printed literature is off the press we will gladly
 
send you the quantities desired.
 
Needless to say we seek your support and will keep you posted of our
 
efforts to keep Pete Seeger out of jail!
 
Cordially,
 
HAROLD LEVENTHAL
 
P.S.
 Please write us if you can help.
 
belated answer to your good letter of July 13th.  TL
 
'ave been more crowded than I e
 t
:i t
.ic
 
decided to try and put out a rev.,-,
-,
,
,(
' of t
 in cf
 Look.
 
T
ristead of being a one-week job, this turned into a two-mont1
 
job with Toshi and I working around the clock with electric
 
typewriter and rubber cement and me and Danny transcribing
 
fer
'
gs earnestly.  The new edition will be off the press in
 
f
iL or so, I hope, and I
'll send you a copy.  It will be ?O
 
pages instead of +O, and I only hope it won't be too confusing
 
to students to find more material in it.  Thanks to printing
 
larger editions, the price will only have to go up to  2
.
 
After we finished the paste-up we took off for Cape Cod
 
where I had a job in a night club for a week, and it was the
 
'
irst real vacation it seemed that we'd ever had.  My two hour
 
in the night club was a breeze, and during the day we went out
 
to the beach.  Toshi and Mika got brown as Indians, and Danny
 
Tinya and I at least got more tanned than usual.
 
I was sorry not to be at Idyliwild but in view of all tho
 
other things going on, and the usual problem of my being away
 
from the family too much anyway, it would have been just ImpossiLL
:.
 
I was especially glad to hear of Frank Hamilton's success.  I f
 
that if he keeps on developing, he will be a really great perfcr:or
 
some day.  Up to now it seemed that he was experimenting mw:
 
the time and hadn't quite simmered down ite a stow,--  ar

around the East, and another trip to England perhaps in Nove!-
ber.
 In February Paul Endicott is arranging a trip down the
 
W
est Coast, and I guess it'll mean one large affair in some p. ee
 
like the Hollywood High School although I
'm tr
 to
 
him that some more peripheral appearances might i
 C:
 
audience, which is always a necessity, it seem
 o
• 
like to do something for the First Unitarian C u'eh  n:
 
they are such good old friends.  I
'm not sure just how many mor-
.
 
years people will want to come and see old Seeger whamming and
 
bamming and letting the audience do most of the work while all
 
he does is to keep them in rhythm with each other, and every
 
there are more talented young people who can play rings around
 
Thiever, I guess I
'll keep it up for as long as I enjoy doing
 
and feel that I have something to contribute.
 I find I don't
 
learn songs quite as quickly as I used to, and I get more pleas.u€
 
out of life in just plain goofing off than I ever did in days go
 
by.  We splurged and got one of these little fiberglass sailboat., 
and Danny and I have been sailing it up and down t
'
rT
 
we can get away, which isn't as often as I had hopEr.
 
All love and best thoughts go to Naomi—having to wo.n
 
th a cast on her neck for six months.  The way you and your
 
f ily have weathered crisis after crisis like this is re lI
 
na nificent.
 
Lastly thanks to you and Sam and all the others for taking u
j
 
that collection and sending it to Harold Leventhal.  At the m ornE'
t
 
he 1eral fund is net in desrarat  nee
 ut if we
 c-u li  ie r  '
 
appe:l, then i
s when we would probably need more.  Toshi and I
 
have put about $+OOO into the case so far and about an equal
 
amount has come in from contributions.  This has taken care of
 
all expenses to date, plus the cost of printing up those leaflets
 
which you have perhaps seen.  Harold Leventhal printed up 35,000
 
of them and they've gone out all around the country.  I do not
 
feel that I want to press people for contributions. :Hce
 
are so many other causes which are in much more dire need.
 c;t
 
important is to simply let people know about the situation in
 
general.
 
All for now, and love to the whole family.
 
Pete

I know how busy you are and how difficult it was for you to taj.e
 
the time to write your letter and this makes me all the more
 
sorry for my long delay in answering it.  But the last couple
 
of months have been completely hectic.  First of all, I worked
 
on getting out a revised edition of my banjo book; instead of
 
the job requiring two weeks (
as I had with over-optimism hoped),
 
it took all of two months.  And then during August I had to take
 
a couple of trips away from home.  Now, as a result of all this,
 
I find myself in September trying to catch up on a two months'
 
accumulation of mail.
 
Toshi and I have been kind of walking a narrow line every
 
time someone asks us about my case, because on the one hand
 
we have the desire to be perfectly and normally frank with
 
anybody wo asks the question, especially with those who ask it
 
with completely friendly intent; then on the other h
.tnd  we have
 
stern injunctions from my layer for me not to go shooting off my
 
mouth about legal matters.  He says that can only lead to trouble
 
and he can't do an adequate job of defending me if I
'm trying to
 
give my opinion on legal matters which I don't really know anything
 
about.' We had to get his permission before even the booklet
 
Harold Leventhal printed could go to press. And each time I
 
suggested bringing up more infoimation that could be included in
 
such a booklet, why it would get cut down on the grounds that it
 
just confused the issue.
 
This also comes up in regard to people who are trying to raise
 
funds for our legal defense, especially those in other countries.
 
My lawyer says that while there is no need for me to stop them from
 
doing it, he said that if I want to go to England to sing I must
 
definitely not participate in any function that would be trying
 
to raise money for my legal defense.
 
I think perhaps the best thing is for people to actually read
 
the hearings of 1955 and let them make up their own minds about
 
it, without me trying to go into elaborate explanations of why
 
I answered some questions -
-
 such as my name and address -
-
 but
 
refused to answer other questions such as who did I know, and
 
where and when did I ever sing.  In these hearings I stated that
 
I didn't want to cast any aspersions on people who had used the
 
Fifth amendment; I simply did not feel that I wanted to use it
 
7
 
myself.  As my laser has explained it to me, using the Fifth
 
amendment is in effect saying "you have no right to ask me this
 
question", but using the First means in effect "you have no right
 
to ask any American such questions".  Since I felt I was in a
 
strong enough position to make a broader attack upon the committee
 
I chose, in effect, the second course.
 
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get copies of the
 
original hearings since they are out of print now.  Harold
 
Leventhal is having a few photostats made of the copy which I
 
have, but I
'm not sure whether my lawyer would let us print them
 
up in quantity for wide distribution.
 
In an interview a couple of weeks ago with a professor from
 
Southern California who i
s making a detailed study of my case and
 
3
 
others like it, I was asked "do you think that Congress does not
 
have any right to have investigating committees of any sort?".
 
Naturally, I had to agree that Congress does have a right to
 
investigate things, and some of its investigations have been
 
extremely important and have brought out things which the
 
normal investigative bodies do not bring out, such as the
 
Teapot Dome scandal, and the La Follette findings on the labor
 
spy racket.
 However, when Congress investigates something it is
 
quite a different thing from having a perennial junket to expose
 
perfectly legal activities.  Supposing there were a few Congress-
men who thought that all oil companies were run by a bunch of
 
crooks, and they kept up every single tear for the next twenty five
 
years a running investigation where they could call the executives
 
of any oil company on the stand and by asking them pointed questions
 
with no chance for rebuttal and make it appear that they were
 
engaged in shady business practices.  Supposing even that following
 
the La Follette investigation, there was a perennial investigation
 
into the use of any detective agency.  Now it is perfectly legal
 
to run detective agencies, but a perennial committee could make it
 
look as though any detective agency was literally a labor spy
 
racket.
 
In effect, this is what the un-American activities committee
 
has been doing for 25 years now.  Under the pretense of investigating
 
conspiracy, they have actually been in the perennial business of
 
exposing heresy -
-
 that is, exposing to the public view all the
 
names they can possibly get of anyone who ever had anything to do
 
with any so-called radical organization, however legal this
 
organization might have been.  This, to my r
nirxl, i
s a complete
 
distortion o f  the c o r r ec t  p r a c t i c es  and the l
egal p r a c t i c e s  of
 
Congress.  And my best defense, frankly, is a hard-hitting
 
offense to try and put this committee out of business.
 It's
 
hurting all of us -
-
 it's hurting America and the world.
 In
 
other words, it's not enough to simply try and claim "Pete is
 
innocent."  I
'm no more innocent than any other normal sinful
 
human being.  However, this committee is harming America, and
 
the sooner we get rid of it, the better.  To understand why i
t
 
is harming America is difficult and can't be done in two or
 
three words.  The newspaper headlines of literally decade
 
r
t v
 
to be rebutted
 Perhaps the best way they can he
 
rebutted is to tell a detailed and specific story about c m
 
person.
 If this one person has to be me, why then I gues
 
perfectly willing to have it told.  This is why I usually pre'
 
any statement about this trial with quoting what I told the
 
committee and what I told the judge -
-
 namely, "1 have never dc
 
anything conspiratorial in my life nor sung anything nor supp
 
anything conspiratorial in any way."  This is a very broad st
 
m e r
it  to make.  The committee claims to be investigating conspira
 
They had witnesses who claimed that I was a member of organization
 
a
rid had supported organizations which they claimed were conspira-
torial.  Either the committee should indict these witnesses for
 
or
 
perjury or should indict me for perjury,/else the committee Itse
 
is lying, and the question is not one of conspiracy but heresy.
 
The fact that neither Congressman Walter or Judge Murphy questioned
 
this statement, to me exposes the fact that they know they are not
 
really investigating conspiracy.  They have got to be put on the
 
spot and forced to admit this basic fraud.
 In America one does
 
force and violence without getting thrown in jail for it.
 
But America has been proud that you hage a perfect legal right
 
to believe in heresy of whatever form you want as long as this
 
does not include any overt act which would be illegal.  These
 
guys have simply got to be pinned down and made to prove  what
 
overt acts that are illegal have been commttted.  Congressman
 
Walter has a perfectly good right to proclaim his belief that
 
certain ideas are harmful to America, but he has absolutely no
 
right to go unchallRnged with his claim that these beliefs are
 
illegal and conspiratorial and un-American.  America has plenty
 
of room for heresies.
 It would not be such a good country without
 
them.
 
Well, Bess, I hope you can make some sense out of all this
 
rambling.  I
've made a carbon of this letter to send to my
 
lawyer along with your letter in the hopes that we can get some-
thing out that will be of supplementary use to the small brochures
 
which Harold has already sent out -
-
 about forty thousand of them,
 
I believe.
 
Love to all the family, and see you perhaps in  arch.

I o
riginally wrote this more than two weeks ago but due to the trial never got it off,
 
so am rewriting to make better s
ense than the first.
 
The reason for this letter i
s that I have in hand a check for royalties from Leeds
 
Music (
 successor to Bob Mills)  for the "Sinking of the Rueban James" in the amount
 
of $345.85.  I think that some clarification i
s needed about Almanac monies.
 
This i
s the first time that any sizable amount has c
ome in for the Almanac Singers
 
In 1956 we received a check for $112.90.  Of Which 900 was for "Songs of the Almar
 
the rest for "
Round and Round Hitler's Grave".  A letter was snt to all the Almanac
 
Singers asking if this amount could be given to the then newly rounded W.W. Guthrie
 
Children's Fund,  All except one said "yes", outright.  One put the reservation that
 
if the amount divided amounted to more he would think tfwice. I took i
t upon myself
 
t
o divide i
t between the Fund and Sis, since Sis at that time had hit a low period.
 
By the way, that check was for royalties dating back to 1946, Folksongs have come a
 
long way, royalty wise, since then.
 
Since 1956 the checks have mostly been for Reuban James,  Reuban Janiea:6/30/59  30.4C

 Peter felt that Reuban J

was mostly Woody s
 and again, divided up it wasn't much.  I have not sent the above
 
amounts to the Children's Fund but directly to Woody via the Gleasons to spend on food,
 
cigaretts, clothing for Woody personally, as well as to help out with the root beer and
 
f
ood for theSunday gatherings at the Gleasons when Woody was visiting out of the hospital.
 
NOW:  Thanks to the Kindston Trio (Ithink)  we have abig c*eck on out hands and this letter

o

PETE
 SEEGER
 
Pete Seeger has appealed his case t
o the United State Court of .ppeals,
 
which will hear it on October 1
, 1961.  He is free on bail, and
, is
 
able t
o travel freely.
 
In the coming months, Pete is going to appear in concerts, radio and
.
 
'
ulevision, and will travel to Canada, Er lani, and
, Europe in addition
 
c
i of time, shows
 
concerts in i
linneapolis, Chica,o and Skokiu, ane
. a earanCe8 for civil
 
liberties groups in San Francisco and in Denver in May.  The last half
 
of that month will be s
pent in England on a radio s
eries for BBC, during
 
which time he will also do television shows for BBC.
 
He will be at home most of the summer, and on September 16, 1961 a
iipears
 
at Carnegie Hall, in New York.  About the middle of October he leaves
 
for England and a six week European concert, radio and television tour.
 
On his r
eturn he is expected to do concerts in New York, Boston, Detroit,
 
Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Vancouver and
 
other cities.  There will also be ad itional records for the Columbia
 
Record Company.
 
Pete will continue t
o limit the number of concerts he does, so that
 
there will be no tour in any formal sense of the word, but there will
 
be occasional week end concerts in the large cities.  He will be
 
available for television programs throughout the country, both in con-
junction with concert appearances, and independ
.antly of then as well.

THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
 After hearing myself talked ab
out, pro and con,
 
for three days, I am grateful for the chance to say a few unrestricted
 
words.
 
First, I should like to thank my lawyer for his masterly presentation of
 
my defense.  He has worked over many long weeks and months, knowing that
 
it is beyond my power t
o pay him adequately for his work.
 I believe that
 
he,  and great legal minds like Justice Hugo Black-and Dr. Alexander
 
Meiklejohn, have explained far better than I can why they believe the
 
First Amendment gives an American citizen the right to refuse to speak
 
upon occasion.
 
Secondly, I should like to s
tate before this court, much as I did before
 
Congressman "alter's committee, my conviction that I have never in my
 
life said
., or supported
., or sung anything in any way subversive of my
 
country.
 Congressman Walter stated that he was investigating a con-
spiracy.  I stated under oath that I had never done anything conspira-
torial.
 If he doubted my word, why didn't he even question it?  Why
 
didn't he have me indicted for perjury? Because, I believe, even he
 
knew that I was speaking the truth.
 
Some of my ancestors were religious disenters who came to America over
 
300 years ago.  Others were abolitionists in New England of the 1640 o
 
and 50' s
 I believe that in choosing my mresent course I do no dis-
honor to them, or to those who may come after me.
 
I am 42 years old, and count myself a very lucky man. 
I have a wife
 
and three healthy children, and we live in a house we built with our
 
own hands, on the banks of the beautiful Hudson River.  For twent0 
years I have been singing folksongs of American and other lands to
 
people everywhere.
 I am proud
. that I have never refused to sing to
 
any group of people because I might disagree with some of the ideas of
 
s
ome of the people listening to me.
 I have sung for rich and poor,
 
for Americans of every possible political and religious opinion and
 
persuasion, of every race, color,  and creed.
 
Ta
m House Committee wismed to  il1ery ao because i
t dsdji't like s
ome
 
few of the many thousands of place
,s I have sung for. Now it s
o happens
 
that the specific song whose title was mentioned in ,this
, trial, "Wasn't
 
That A
 is one of my favorites.  The song is apropos to this case.
 
I wonder if I might have your Dorulosion to s
ing i
t here before I close?
 
Judge: "You may not".
 
Well, perhaps you will hear it some other time.  A good s
ong can only
 
do good
., and I am proud of the songs I have sung.
 I hope to be able
 
to continue singing these s
ongs for all who ant to listen, Republicans,
 
Democrats, and
. independents.  Do I have the right to sing these s
onos?
 
Do I have the right to sing them anywhere?

Many people throughout the country;  friends, fans and admirers of
 
Pete Seeger, have been anxious to give their support in whatever effort
 
is needed to help Pete.
 
The lawyers handling the case have already made an  appeal to a higher
 
court, which will hear the appeal sometime in October.
 Failing in this
 
instance, a further appeal will be brought before the United States Su-
preme Court.
 In the meantime, Pete remains out on bail and will con-
tinue his regular concert appearances tbroughout the country.
 
A group of us are now organizing the FRIENDS OF PETE SEEGER whose main
 
purpose will be as follows:
 
1
)
 To issue literature stating the facts behind this case--why Pete
 
did not answer the Un-American Committee, as well as such information
 
that would present background material of the issues involved.
 
2
)
 To publicize this case and the principals behind it and to gain as
 
much public support as possible in all sections of the country.
 
3
)
 To help Pete with the necessary monies for the legal expenses
 
incurred in this case and the monies needed for the appeal.
 It is esti-
mated that it can cost $15,000 to see it up to the Supreme Court.
 Dona-
tions should be made payable to: Harold Leventhal and sent to the above
 
address,
 
4
)
 To encourage people to form FRIENDS OF PETE SEEGER in their cities,
 
We in New York would be glad to be of help wherever possible.
 We want
 
to coordinate such activities with New York as the center,
 
Just as soon as the printed literature is off the press we will gladl�
/
 
send yMl the quantities desired.
 
Needless to say we seek your support and will keep you posted of our
 
efforts to keep Pete Seeger out of jail!

STATEMENT BY PETER SEEG
.iL B'cRE JUDGE MURPHY,
 
Federal Court, New York City
 
April 1
4
,  1961
 
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.  After hearing myself talked about, pro and con, for three
 
days, I am grateful for the chance to say a few unrestricted words.
 
First, I should like to thank my lawyer for his masterly presentation of my defense.
 
He has worked over many long weeks and months, knowing that i
t i
s beyond my power to
 
pay him adequately for his work.  I believe that he, and great legal minds like
 
Justice Hugo Black and Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, have explained far better than I can
 
why they believe the First Amendment gives an American citizen the right to refuse to
 
speak upon occasion.
 
Secondly, I should like to state before this court, much as I did before Congressman
 
Walter's committee, my conviction that I have never i
n my life said, or supported, or
 
sung anything i
n any way subversive of my country.  Congressman Walter stated that he
 
was i
nvestigating a conspiracy.
 I stated under oath that I had never done anything
 
conspiratorial.  If he doubted my word, why didn't he even question i
t?  Why didn't
 
he have me i
ndicted for perjury?  Because, I believe, even he knew that I was speak-
i
ng the truth.
 
Some of my ancestors were religious dissenters who came to America aver 300 years ago.
 
Others were abolitionists i
n New England of the 181
40's and 50's.
 I believe that i
n
 
choosing my present course I do no dishonor to them, or to those who may come after
 
me.
 
I am 42 years old
., and count myself a very lucky man.  I have a wife and three healthy
 
children, and we live i
n a house we built with our own hands, on the banks of the
 
beautiful Hudson River.  For twenty years I have been singing folkeongs of America
 
and other lands to people everywhere.
 I am proud that I never refused to sing to any
 
group of people because I might disagree with some of the ideas of some of the people
 
listening to me.
 I have sung for rich and poor, for Americans of every possible po-
litical and religious opinion and persuasion, of every race, color and creed.
 
The House committee wished to pillory me because i
t didn't l
ike some few of the many
 
thousands of places I have sung for.  Now i
t so happens that the specific song whose
 
title was mentioned i
n this trial, "Wasn't That A Time", i
s one of my favorites.
 
The song I
s apropos to this case.  I wonder If I might have your permission to sing
 
i
t here before I close?
 
(Judge denied permission)
 
Well, perhaps you will hear i
t some other time.  A good song can only do good, and I
 
am proud of the songs I have sung.  I hope to be able to continue singing these songs
 
for all who want to listen, Republicans, Democrats, and I
ndependents.  Do I have the
 
right to s
ing these songs?  Do I have the right to s
ing them anywhere?

Seeger was born May 3
, 1
919, i
n
 
New York C
ity. He now l
ives i
n t
he
 
t
own o
f Beacon, N.Y. His mother was
 
a v
iolin t
eacher and h
is f
ather a noted
 
musicologist, but Pete s
ays he n
ever
 
i
ntended t
o s
tudy music h
imself.
 
"You know, i
f your f
ather's a min-
i
ster or a l
awyer," h
e s
ays, "
that's
 
t
he very t
hing you j
ust make up your
 
mind you're not going t
o be." However,
 
he c
onfesses t
o having t
aken up t
he
 
ukulele when he was 8
, and he p
layed
 
t
he t
enor banjo i
n t
he s
chool j
azz band.
 
"
I knew by heart," he s
ays, "practi-
c
ally a
ll t
he h
it t
unes o
f t
he 1
920s
 
and t
he e
arly '
30s. This gave me a
 
f
eeling f
or words and music." But he
 
had s
till not f
ound what he was s
eek-
i
ng.
 
IT WASN'T UNTIL 1
935, when h
e
 
v
isited  a s
quare  dance  f
estival  i
n
 
Asheville,  N.C.,  t
hat  he  d
iscovered
 
s
omething he f
elt worthwhile.  Here
 
he  observed  t
he  gregariousness  o
f
 
people, s
haring a c
ommunal p
leasure
 
i
n music.  Here, t
hen, was t
he f
irst
 
t
rue f
usion o
f words and music t
hat
 
was t
o s
et h
im on h
is f
uture c
ourse.
 
He  s
pent  s
ome  t
ime  with  Alan
 
Lomax i
n t
he archives o
f American
 
f
olk music i
n t
he L
ibrary o
f Congress,
 
where he heard many o
f t
he r
ecord-
i
ngs  Lomax had made o
f s
ongs o
f
 
America.  Then, f
or a period b
efore
 
World War I
I, a
s he puts i
t
, he "ho-
boed around with my banjo" t
hrough
 
t
he s
outhern and midwestern s
tates,
 
meeting and observing t
he people who
 
s
ang and  p
layed i
n  t
he mountains,
 
valleys, and p
lains.
 
From 1
942 t
o 1
945, h
e was i
n t
he
 
armed f
orces. His t
alents f
or c
ommuni-
c
ating music t
o l
arge audiences was
 
d
iscovered i
n s
pecial s
ervices. He wryly
 
observes t
hat t
his "means t
hat when
 
my k
ids a
sk me, 'Daddy, what d
id you
 
do i
n t
he great war?' I t
ell t
hem, '
I
 
p
layed t
he banjo'." Which he d
id f
or
 
t
he s
oldiers i
n t
he name o
f morale-
building.
 
AFTER THE WAR, he j
oined t
he
 
Almanacs, a s
inging group which i
n-
c
luded s
uch noted f
olk artists a
s Woody
 
Guthrie, Lee Hays, and Millard Lain-
pell. They t
raveled a
cross t
he c
ountry,
 
made s
ome r
ecordings, and s
ang every-
where.
 
I
n  1
949,  Seeger helped  f
orm  t
he
 
Weavers, which i
ncluded Hays, Fred
 
Hellerman,  and  Ronnie  G
ilbert.  He
 
was with t
hem until 1
952. A y
ear after
 
he j
oined t
hem, t
he s
ong Goodnight,
 
I
rene, which t
hey used a
t t
heir r
ecitals,
 
made The Hit Parade and brought t
he
 
Weavers national f
ame.
 
This s
ong, Pete points out, f
irst was
 
popularized  by  Leadbelly  and  was
 
drawn f
rom h
is l
ife. Leadbelly's death
 
s
ix months b
efore t
he s
ong a
ttained
 
nationwide  popularity was  t
he f
inal
 
t
ouch t
o a l

ection o
f s
ongs t
o f
ocus h
is audience's
 
a

imeless moods and
 
expression t
hey c
onvey.
 
IT I
S BEFORE a
 c
lassroom audience
 
t
hat  Seeger perhaps i
s a
t h
is b
est.
 
Pete has made two 1
0-inch LPs f
or
 
Folkways Records (
 Birds, Beasts, Bugs
 
and Little Fishes and Birds, Beasts,
 
Bugs and Bigger Fishes) which p
er-
petuate a z

f f
olk music. And
 
audiences f
or t
his basic k
ind o
f music
 
are greater t
han e
ver, Pete s
ays.
 
He points out t
hat when he was i

C
iro's n

t
he Weavers, he s
ang t
o perhaps 1

f
 
c
oncerts a
t t
hree Los Angeles c
olleges
 
within a f
ew days, he sang t
o more
 
t
han 5
,000 persons.
 
"Folk music," s
ays Seeger, "
is a
t
 
i
ts h
ealthiest when people participate.
 
I notice  a
lso  t

t's t
his a

drives  out  prejudice,  snobbery,  and
 
c

makes us know t

PETE AND HIS wife now are em-

again, t

"This c

And a Committee member t

orm s
 
t

or Count 9 (
Ta).
 
After this r
esponse, Chairman Walter a
sked whether the
 
N

eplied i

f

t

fter t
hese addi-
t
ional i

s was not further asked
 
about t
eaching a
t the Jef
ferson School.
 
There were further queries about appellant's pei
'foIii-
a
iiees a
t entertainment f
or the Jef
ferson School and the
 
Labor Youth League, and about an organization called "Peo-
p
le's Songs."  Appellant gave the s
ame r
esponse t
o a
ll o
f
 
t
hese questions, was not d
irected t
o answer any o
f them
 
(GX 10, pp. 2459-2460; GX 12, pp.  14-16), and none o
f them
 
i
s embraced i

ndictment.  He asked a
t one point "Do
 
you t
hink that I
 s
ing propaganda s

omething?", but
 
hi
s question was i
gnored (O X 10, p

Count 10.  Finally, Mr. Tavenner asked, "Are you a
 
member o
f the Com munist Party now?"  This question ap-
pellant was d
irected t
o answer, and he again r
esponded by
 
s
aying, "My answer i
s t

ame as before."  This was the
 
basis for Count 10 (GX 10, p
.  2460; GX 12, p

On July 25, 1956, nearly a year l
ater, the Committee r
e-
ported the appellant's r

I
n Deutch v

1961),
 
the Supreme Court s
aid:
 
"One i

 (Bracketed

In Watkins v
. United States, 354 U. S

1957), which
 
Deutch here r
elied on, the Court pointed out that an i
ndi-
v

ommittee must determine a
t h
is
 
peril whether o
r not t
o answer a question.  Therefore, the
 
Court said, 354 U. S

t 208-9,
 
"
It i
s obvious that a PCI )f

Mi. Justice Frankfurter, c

To t
ake a s
ingle e
xample:
 
The question underlying Count 1 was "May I a
sk you
 
whether o
r not t
he Allerton Section was a s
ection o
f t
he
 
Co m munist Party?"  Explaining pertinency i
n t

o
f t

estif

s f
ollows:
 
"The i
nquiry t

here was t

scer-
t
ain whether o

However, appellant was not g

hearing, and the jury were not g
