e
t
 
me t
e

bout s
omething t
hat happened t
o me, during
 
my f
olkloric s
alad days.
 
My husband and I
 were l
iving i
n Topanga, California, a
t
 
t
he t
ime, a
long with our t
hree c
hildren, t
hen a
ged a
bout
 
s
even and a
 half, s
ix, and f
ive. I
t
 w as
 
an a
ctive bunch. We were a
lso
 
v
ery b
roke a
nd were l
iving
 
i
n a
 r
idiculously small house,
 
p
robably o
riginally built f
or a
 
weekend g
etaway c
ottage. My
 
husband and I
 s
lept i
n t
he b
ig b
ed
 
on t
he s
ide porch; t
he t
hree c
hildren
 
i
n bunk b
eds i
n t
he s
ingle
 
bedroom. There was a
 small
 
l
iving r
oom, a
 minute k
itchen, a
nd
 
a
 b
ath with only a
 s
hower s
tall. The f
amily g
rouping was
 
f
urther adorned by t
he p
resence o
f a
 dog named Quartsy
 
-
 whom we had bargained f
or a
t a
 l
ocal swapping f
a
ir by
 
t
rading s
everal quarts o
f my homemade applesauce f
or one
 
d
elightful puppy
, and t
hus t
he name Quartsy
.
 
When I
 t
ook Quartsy t
o t
he l
ocal v
et f
or a
 c
heckup, h
e
 
l
ooked s
ober
. We had b
een t
oo naive t
o i
nsist on any k
ind
 
o
f medical r
ecord, and t
he v
et s
aid he d
idn't t
hink our
 
puppy had had t
he r
ight s
hots. I
 s
uspect he knew a
t t
he
 
t
ime t
hat s
he was c
oming down with d
istemper
, but hoped
 
he c
ould f
orestall i
t
.
 His p
ills and our e
arnest administra-
t
ion o
f t
hem d
idn't s
eem t
o help, and Quartsy j
ust got
 
s
icker and s
icker
. And t
hen my husband got a
 week-long
 
j
ob out o
f s
tate and had t
o l
eave home f
or s
everal days. We
 
n
eeded t
he work and t
he money
, and he had t
o go.
 
Well. Early one e
vening, t
hen, I
 f
ound myself with a
 dying
 
dog, t
hree young and passionately i
nterested c
hildren,
 
and no backup. Quartsy b
egan t
o have c
onvulsions, a

I
 f
inally l
ocked her i

fraid t
hat i

s
pasms s

inally
, s
he quieted down.
 
I

The c

arrying Quartsy who k

 had a

 I
 was myself g

dog, and f
rankly I
 was b
eginning t

f
 a
l
l our
 
t
hree c
harming c

ome k
ind o
f undiscovered
 
monsters. Nobody had s

a

evolted me. I
 s

bsolutely not, and
 
we a

l t
railed b

ill.
 
I
 c
an't r

f
 t
he f
ormer n

with t

epeated. I
 r
ather t

The n
ext morning, a
 S
aturday
, my f
ive-year-old s
on
 
appeared -
 a
l
l d
ressed, s
hiny
, and c
heerful -
 a
te a
 h
earty
 
b
reakfast, and t
hen s
aid, "Hey Ma, s
ing me a
 dead s
ong."
 
P
reviously h
e had made no c
omment whatever a
bout t
he
 
dog o
r t
he f
uneral o
r any o
f t
he adventures we had b
een
 
having; he had j
ust c
ome a
long s
erenely f
or t
he r
ide, s
o t
o
 
s
ay
, watching what was going on.
 
I
 s
aid, "
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong." I
 hadn't e
ven had
 
my c
offee y
et. But my s
on, was -
 and s
t
ill i
s
, f
or t
hat matter
 
-
 a
 perseverator
. I
t
 has a
lways b
een hard f
or h
im t
o l
e
t go
 
o
f o
r t
o c
hange a
 perfectly good p
lan; s
ometimes I
 t
hink h
e
 
n
ever has, he j
ust moves t
hings a
round a
 l
i
ttle o
r maybe
 
puts a
 particular p
roblem on t
he back burner f
or awhile.
 
This makes f
or a
 s
trong and e
ff
icient g
rown-up. But a
t t
he
 
a
ge o
f f
ive h
e handled t
hings more d
irectly
. He s
imply
 
announced h
is n
eeds and r
epeated t
he n
ews bulletin i
ndef
i-
n
itely
. After t
en o
r twenty more r
equests o
f "C'mon Ma,
 
s
ing me a
 dead s
ong," my i
r
ritation boiled over
. I
 s
aid,
 
"
Look, I
 j
ust don't f
eel l
ike s
inging a
 dead s
ong r
ight now
.
 
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong. I
f
 you want a
 dead s
ong,
 
go s
ing one yourself."
 
He f
inally wandered outside. I
 d
rank my c
offee and f
e
lt
 
a
bused and n
eglected. After awhile I
 heard a
 young voice
 
s
inging a
bstractedly out on t
he back patio, a
ccompanied
 
only by t
he r
olling wheels o
f a
 t
ruck h
e was pushing:
 
Go t
e
ll Aunt Nancy
, go t
e
ll Aunt Nancy
,
 
Go t
e

The one s
he'd b

I

progra ms. Our me mbers have t
aken music i
nto a

ettings, and
 
you'll r
ead about so me o
f the m here. You'll a
lso f
ind a
 nu mber o
f songs
 
t
hat have been i
nspired by the children our writers have worked with, i

o c

lO!
 
will be on the the me o
f f
a mily, i
nterpreted t
o i
nclude a
 broad spectru m o
f
 
i
deas about f
amily and how we can address the m t
hrough children's music.
 
Following t
hat, i
n the spring, our the me will be s

a
 l
ook a
t ways that music can connect children t
o social-justice move-
ments, past and present. P
lease keep sharing your i
deas and experiences
 
with our r
eaders!
 
We have a
 new na me f
or one o
f our o
ldest PlO! colu mns. "Radio Waves,"
 
by PJ Swif
t, has been exploring the r
eal m o
f children's radio f
or years,
 
with articles about f
ascinating progra ms many o
f us would never have
 
heard about o
therwise. As many o
f
 you have noticed, however, t
he i
nternet
 
i
s rapidly beco ming a
 broadcast mediu m i
n i
ts own r
ight, and so me even
 
think that i
t will soon r
eplace radio. While that r
e mains t
o be s
een, P3
 
wants t
o extend the r
each o
f her coverage t
o i
nclude o
ther media. We
 
l
ook f
orward t
o hearing about cutting-edge children's progra ms i
n her
 
colu mn, now called "Media Waves."
 
F
inally, current CMN me mbers are r
eceiving a special i
nsert i
n t
his i
s-
sue. Bess Lo max Hawes, who gave the keynote address a
t our 1999
 
national gathering i
n Petalu ma, California, has g
raciously a
llowed us t
o
 
r
eprint i
t
. Those o
f you who were unable t
o a
ttend the gathering can now
 
r
ead her i
nspirational words, and a
ll o
f us can keep the m and share
 
the m with o
thers who want a
 deeper understanding o
f the work we do.
 
Editorial
 
h
is i
s the space we've r
eserved especially t
o p
rint our me mbers'
 
opinions about whatever i
s on their minds. I
t
's been i
ncreasingly
 
challenging t
o f
ind people t
o write these p
ieces, and I
 doubt i
t
's f
or l
ack o
f
 
s
trong opinions i
n our network. We are a
 thoughtful, hard-working, c
re-
a
tive, and powerful g
roup o
f people. Most o
f us keep pretty busy: i
t
's no
 
secret i
n the world o
f children's music that many o
f us are overworked
 
and underpaid. So, though there i
s certainly a
 wealth o
f i
deas among us,
 
maybe i
t s
ee ms l
ike just t
oo much t
o put t
ogether an editorial f
or Pass I
t
 
On! I
'm not asking anybody t
o f
eel badly about that —we have a
 volunteer
 
s
taf
f person whose j
ob i
t i
s t
o get depressed about such things. But,
 
s
ince nobody d
id write us an editorial f
or this i
ssue, I
 will use this space
 
t
o encourage you, s
trongly, t
o a
llow t
his t

ince 1985, Brett has
 
t
aught music t
o s
tudents i
n every
 
g
rade f
ro m k
indergarten through
 
college. Along the way, he has im-
pressed s
tudents, parents, and
 
colleagues not only as a
 musician
 
and t
eacher, but a
lso as an activ-
i
st and co m municator. "Education
 
must g
ive a

t
ies t

has developed the Master Musician

ntegrates music i

g
lish, and social s
ciences curricula,
 
using musical t
ools t
o im merse s
tu-
dents i

lso
 
uses music t

f
ro m h
is own boyhood experience
 
o
f being mislabled by s
tandardized

i m f

errible.

BS: I
t

f
 I
'm showing a
 new dance,
 
i
t
's not "Oh, i

us another one, that was f

They're p

where they t

We Robins knew we were t

On one hand, my parents had g

s s
itting i
n her wheel-
chair, her head bowed, no
 
i
ndication that she i
s with us. She
 
isn't. But we keep t
rying t
o r
each
 
her. "Maria," we say, "Look a
t us."
 
We l
i
ft her head, gently, but s
lw s
till
 
does not g
ive us eye contact.
 
She i
s what we call a
 "near c
l
rowii-
i
ng." When she was 10, so mething
 
happened i
n her f
a mily pool. She
 
was just l
earning t
o swi m and
 
was i
n the pool a
lone, and she
 
drowned —al most. Rescuers brought
 
her back, but not a
ll o
f her. She i
s
 
15 now, and I
 s
it with her, s
tru m-
ming m y guitar, wishing 1
 could
 
t
ravel t
o t
he p
lace where she h
ides.
 
I
 begin t
o s
ing what I
 am f
eeling:
 
Let's a
ll go where Maria goes.
 
Maria goes,
 
To t
he p
lace t
hat no one knows,
 
no one knows,
 
Leave behind t
he noise and d
in,
 
t
he noise and d
in,
 
Maria, Maria, l
et us i
n, l
et us i
n.
 
Suddenly, she l
i
fts her head, un-
assisted, and says, "Oh, h
i!" I
 can't
 
believe I
 heard this, and I
 s
ing the
 
l
ines again. Once more she says,
 
"Hi." People gather c
lose t
o s
ee this.
 
That n
ight I
 f
inish the song:
 
We're a
ll co ming t
o your s
ecret
 
l
and,
 
To g
ive you hugs and hold your
 
hand,
 
Let us i
n and l
et us t
ouch,
 
Because we l
ove you very much.
 
This song beco mes the door t
o
 
Maria's private world. She begins
 
t
o co m municate more —not much
 
more, but i
n special education we
 
are thrilled and satisfied with very
 
small t
riu mphs.
 
Special-education t
eachers use
 
music the way, perhaps, everyone
 
should use music —to help the chil-
dren grow, physically, cognitively,
 
emotionally, and socially, and t
o
 
help ourselves t

ove doing music l
ive,
 
r
ather than just p
laying t
apes and
 
CDs. We do use s
o me wonderful r
e-
cordings, t
oo. but we do i
t
 i
n a
 very
 
participatory manner. Many o
f our
 
k
ids a
re i
n wheelchairs, so we "mo-
t
or" the m through songs, so t
hey
 
get t
o enjoy the move ment. When
 
we p
lay a song l
ike "Wake Up,
 
Toes," we move Vanessa's t
oes f
or
 
and with her, s
ince she cannot
 
move her own body. Carlos doesn't
 
l
ike t
o be t
ouched. We p
lay "Yo Te
 
Arno," and he a
llows us t
o hug h
i m
 
as he s
ings with us.
 
Many o
f t
he songs I
 write co me d
i-
r
eedy f
ro m t
he children —fro m what
 
they are f
eeling and o
ften f
ro m
 
t
hings they say. They are the r
eal
 
makers o
f my songs, though t
hey
 
may only p
lant a
 verbal o
r even a
 
s
ilent s
eed.
 
For exa mple t
here's Vanessa, and
 
Edgar, who l
oves Vanessa. They are
 
both 8
 years o
ld, but Vanessa i
s a
 
t
iny l
i
ttle person who cannot move
 
her arms o
r l
egs o
r t
alk or f
eed her-
s
elf. But she can smile l
ike the
 
noonday sun, and her eyes dance
 
about, a
lighting on the correct an-
swer, word, or nu mber. She i
s very
 
bright. And Edgar l
oves her, helps
 
t
o f
eed her, pushes her about t
he
 
s
choolyard, and says a
t l
east 10
 
t
imes a
 day, "
I want t
o s
it next t
o
 
Vanessa! I
 want t
o s
it next t

its next to
 
Vanessa as I
 say, "You know what
 
Edgar, I
 t
hink t

y philosophy has a

been, "Making music i

and f

or every age and every

Too o

While t

hear a
 melodic phrase or l

most people would. A child with
 
dyslexia may not s
ee words o
r n otes
 
as most people do. We can under-
s
tand and address t
he weaknesses
 
while emphasizing and building on
 
t
he s
trengths. I

etting we
 
can r

hat t
here are m
ali v
 
d

epre-
s
ented. Younger children and t
hose
 
with special needs may need a
 va-
r
iety o
f cues f
ro m various modes.
 
before they can achieve success.
 
We can use t
actile, k
inesthetic, v
i-
sual, and auditory l
earning a
ll
 
t
ogether.
 
For many years music has been an
 
accepted therapy f
or emotional
 
proble ms. But music should no
 
l
onger be thought o
f as s
imply a
 
therapy o
r peripheral enrich ment
 
activity. Music i
s basic and f
unda-
mental. I
n addition t
o the widely
 
known enrich ment qualities, mu-
s
ic a
lso has substantial non musi-
cal benefits. Scientists are now
 
o
ffering empirical evidence f
or what
 
many musicians have known a
ll
 
a
long: that appropriate music cdii-
cation begun early i

motor, and social skills and e n -
hances natural musical abilities
 
and appreciation; that through
 
music we can improve skills in
 
l
earning-disabled children; that
 
t
hrough music we can develop t

skills, body awareness and coordi-

c
reative t
hinking.
 
F or over 20 years, i
n my private
 
p
iano l

special-needs tutor, I
 have used

math, and p
lay the p

t only
 
s
tands t
o r
eason t
hat i
f
 music helps
 
t
o t
each special-needs children,
 
t
hen i
t will help o
thers as well. I
n
 
s
electing my curriculu m f
or private
 
l
essons and preschool, I
 choose
 
songs and activities not only f
or
 
their musical value but a
lso f
or
 
t
heir develop mental qualities.
 
I
t has been shown that there i
s a
 
t
ransfer e
ffect f
ro m music t
o o
ther
 
cognitive do mains of the brain.
 
There are many skills l
earned
 
t
hrough music t
hat a
re a
lso needed
 
when l
earning math and r
eading.
 
So me o
f these skills are auditory
 
and v
isual d
iscrimination, auditory
 
and v
isual patterning and sequenc-
i
ng, r
eceptive and expressive
 
l
anguage, one-to-one matching,
 
and a
 s
ense o
f rhyth m. S
ince mu-
s
ic uses more s
ti muli than paper
 
and pencil and o
ther conventional
 
t
eaching methods, we can use
 
music as a
 means t
o develop these
 
skills or r
e mediate proble ms. I
t
's
 
a
lso more f
un! This i
s acco mplished
 
by t
aking the abstract concept o
f
 
music and making i
t more con-
c
rete. When you hear music as an
 
active l
istener —when you f
eel i
t
,
 
c
lap i
t
, or s
ing a
long —you bring
 
your participation i
nto the concrete
 
r
eal m of your body. And when you
 
make music with your whole body,
 
you experience and understand
 
music i
n d
ifferent ways and on a
 
variety o
f l
evels.
 
When we think o
f t
eaching a
 song
 
t
o a
 t
ypical c
lass, many o
f us may
 
not do much p
lanning f
or how t
o
 
t
each the song. We'll s
ing a l
ine,
 
and the c
lass s
ings i
t back t
o us.
 
So metim es we don't r
ealize just
 
how many s
teps there are or what
 
benefits can co me f
ro m certain
 
songs. I
n special education, how-
ever, most t
eachers think of the
 
smallest s
teps and set r
ealistic
 
goals. So me s
tudents will only be
 
able t
o do a t
ask with 90 percent
 
accuracy, 85 percent o
f the t
ime.
 
As an exercise f
or yourself
, you may
 
want t
o t
ry writing a
 t
ask analysis
 
f
or a song that you have been
 
t
eaching f
or awhile. You may s
ee
 
t
hat o
ld song i
n new ways. I
 was
 
t
aught about t
ask analysis i
n my
 
special-education t
raining. Nothing
 
l
ike i
t
 was ever mentioned i
n r
egu-
l
ar-education methods c
lasses.
 
Essentially, i
t
 i
s a
 way o
f thinking
 
about how t
o go about achieving
 
your goals. You ask, "What does t
he
 
s
tudent need t
o know o
r be able t
o
 
do, t
o acco mplish the t
ask?" This
 
makes you s
ee a
ll t
he d
ifferent co m-
ponents there are t
o doing things.
 
I
t helps you t
o l
ook a
t things f
ro m
 
d
ifferent angles. With preschoolers
 
and special-needs s
tudents, this
 
can so meti mes mean not only go-
i
ng s
tep by s
tep, but breaking
 
things down i
nto many, many
 
small s
teps. So me things t
hat we
 
t
ake f
or granted i
n r
egular educa-
t
ion must be p
lanned f
or with
 
special-needs s
tudents.
 
As an exa mple o
f a
 t
ask analysis,
 
l
et's consider a
 l
esson p
lan where
 
the objective i
s t
o have the c
lass
 
l
earn t
o s
ing and dance t
o a cer-
t
ain song. While the d
iff
iculty o
f the
 
dance can be geared t
o t
he l
evel o
f
 
the c
lass, my goals would r
e main
 
basically the sa me. The child will

Our f
eatured speaker was Bruce
 
"Utah" Phillips. the "
legendary voice
 
o
f the great Southwest," who now
 
makes Nevada C
ity h
is ho me. He
 
i
s a
 nationally known s
inger, s
to-
r
yteller, and poet with a powerful
 
i
nsider's perspective on the Labor
 
Move ment and t
he music t
hat g
rew
 
out o
f i
t
. A mix o
f s
tories, songs,
 
and opinion, Utah's t
alk f
ocused on
 
t
he importance o
f t
eaching children
 
about l
abor h
istory and how t
o
 
make i
t
 accessible t
o t
he m through
 
songs and s
tories. He s
tressed the
 
r
ole that our e
lders have t
o p
lay i
n
 
this, connecting our children t
o
 
these s
tories through the people
 
who actually l
ived the m.
 
Utah Phillips gave h
is t
alk a
t the
 
John Wool man School, and as I
 
l
ooked around t
he r
oo m t
hat n
ight,
 
I
 was s
truck by the f
aces o
f the
 
t
eenage s
tudents f
ro m the s
chool,
 
who were c
learly sparked by Utah's
 
presentation. Later, t
hey asked h
i m
 
f
or h
is thoughts about the World
 
Trade Organization (WTO) de mon-
s
trations i
n Seattle and e
lsewhere.
 
Given that he describes h
i mself as
 
an anarchist, they wondered what
 
he thought about the "
anarchists"
 
a
t the WTO de monstrations, who
 
are getting much o
f t
he b
la me f
or
 
the v
iolent outbreaks and a
re t
hus
 
not a
lways wcl( ollle(l by o
ther deni-
onstrators.
 
Utah answered by defining a t
rue
 
anarchist as a person who t
akes
 
the r
esponsibility f
or making a
ll
 
her/his own decisions and does not
 
assu me the r
ight t
o make decisions
 
f
or o
thers. This, he pointed out,
 
r
equires a good deal o
f maturity
 
and wisdo m. I
t i
sn't about impul-
s
ively doing whatever you want. I
t
's
 
about knowing what's good f
or you
 
and t
aking charge o
f your l
i
fe. I
t
's
 
a
lso about r
ecognizing when your
 
actions may r
esult i
n r
obbing o
th-
e
rs o
f t
he ability t
o make important
 
choices f
or the mselves. So, f
or ex-
ample, Utah i
s a
 pacifist, s
ince he
 
believes that t
o make a
 decision t
o
 
k
ill so meone would be t
o r
ob the m
 
of one of the most important
 
choices they have —to l
ive or t
o d
ie.
 
These r
e marks certainly got me t
o
 
thinking what i
t would be l
ike t
o
 
cultivate that approach t
o l
i
fe i
n our
 
children and t
o l
ive i
t
 as a
 culture.

This progra m was so successful
 
t
hat i
t r
eceived an award o
f excel-
l
ence that su m mer, f
ro m the State
 
o
f Michigan.
 
I
n 1
999 I
 was asked t
o enhance this
 
progra m with music. Two v
isits
 
were s
cheduled a
t each o
f a
 nu m-
ber of "high-risk" neighborhood
 
parks. On the f
irst v
isit I
 d
id a
 
h
ighly participatory peace concert
 
s
ing-along with the children, f
ol-
l
owed by a songwriting session
 
wherein we began writing a peace
 
song f
or their neighborhood. On a
 
b
ig newsprint pad, we wrote down
 
t
he children's v
isions o
f peace —in
 
t
heir hearts, their ho mes, their
 
neighborhood. I
deas f
lew! Every-
thing f
ro m the s
implest "brush
 
your t
eeth" and "
don't ju mp on the
 
bed" t
o such sophisticated con-
c
epts as c
learing an area o
f nega-
t
ivity by smudging, t
o b
lessing the
 
earth with chants. Not surprisingly,
 
t
he l
ists f
or the various parks were
 
very s
i milar —children wanted
 
t
he m t
o be drug and v
iolence f
ree,
 
safe, and beautiful, with people
 
showing r
espect f
or ani mals, na-
t
ure, and o
ther people. I
 i
nvited
 
musical i
deas, t
oo —especially f
or a
 
chorus t
hat might t
ie our thoughts
 
t
ogether —and I
 made notes o
f any-
thing that ca me u p. Musical i
deas
 
were scarce, however; t
ime and
 
o
ther l
imitations prevented much
 
develop ment i
n this area, so u
lti-
mately I
 pretty much co mposed the
 
tunes.
 
That f
irst v
isit concluded with a
 
cere mony t
o "
anchor peace i
n this
 
neighborhood." We marched (
non-
militantly, o
f course!) around the
 
peri meters o
f t
he park, t
he children
 
shaking rattles or p
laying dru ms
 
and a
ll o
f us s
inging a
 s
imple t
he me
 
song I
'd written f
or the whole oc-
casion, called "We Create a C
ircle
 
o
f Peace" (
see f
acing page). I
 f
elt a
 
r
eal s
ense o
f power and sacredness,
 
and I
 believe the children d
id, t
oo.
 
I
 t
ook the l
ists o
f children's i
deas
 
ho me and c
reated a
 song f
or each
 
park, being careful not t
o r
eword
 
concepts any more t
han necessary
 
t
o make the m f
i
t rhyth m and/or
 
rhy me. (
I
t's miraculous how l
yrics
 
f
all i
nto p
lace so meti mes!) I
 o
ften
 
grouped concepts, but t
ook care
 
t
hat each child who had made a
 
suggestion would r
ecognize i
t
 i
n the
 
song. Often t
he song was call-and-
r
esponse i
n nature, making i
t
 easy
 
t
o l
earn. I
 co mposed s
everal s
imple
 
potential choruses, using any mu-
s
ical i
deas I
 could t
hat t
he children
 
had co me up with. I
 then r
eturned
 
two days l
ater t
o t
each, practice,
 
and t
ape-record our song. I
 l
et the
 
children choose which chorus they
 
l
iked best; t
o g
ive the m a g
reater
 
sense o
f participation. As you can
 
imagine, the children l
oved hear-
i
ng their own voices on the t
ape! A
 
copy o
f the t
ape was l
ef
t with each
 
park, so that children could ask
 
l
ater t
o hear and s
ing i
t again.
 
(
There were e
ight songs written i
n
 
a
ll, now available i
n songbook
 
f
orm.)
 
I
t was i
nteresting and challenging
 
t
o me, as the children c
reated their
 
l
ists, how s
trongly I
 had t
o guide
 
the conversation t
oward positive
 
v
ision and af
f
irmative s
tatements.
 
I
t see ms much easier t
o l
ist a
ll the
 
"
don'ts" and "no more's" (
don't do
 
drugs, don't k
ill, no more war, no
 
pollution, e
tc.) t
han t
o know what
 
l
i
fe might l
ook l
ike without t
hese
 
negative things. I
 t
hink I
 under-
s
tand why this i
s so: We have been
 
so f
ar away f
or so l
ong f
ro m any-
t
hing l
ike a t
ruly peaceful p
lanet
 
that we can't concretely envision
 
what i
t i
s—we l
ive daily with the
 
obstacles t
o i
t
, those things that
 
must be changed, chipped away,
 
d
issolved, o
r t
rans muted before we
 
can s
ee i
t
. These are t
he things t
hat
 
r
eadily ca me t
o mind f
or many chil-
dren. So, as best I
 could, I
 put their
 
concepts i
n t
he af
f
irmative, but t
his
 
d
idn't a
lways work, as I
 d
idn't want
 
their s
tate ments r
eshaped i
nto
 
so mething unrecognizable t
o t
he m.
 
These s
essions were splendid op-
portunities t
o t
alk about how
 
"
peace begins with me"; about t
he
 
importance o
f our a
ttitudes and t
he
 
choices we make: about how t
he
 
peaceful t
houghts and v
isions we
 
hold i
n our minds are more pro-
ductive t
han f
ocusing on a
ll t
he bad
 
things we don't want anymore. We
 
r
ealized how the spoken o
r sung
 
word, with t
he energy
 o
f our heart-
f
elt i
ntentions, can help c
reate t
he
 
world we want i
n the new millen-
n
iu m. This, o
f course, was the
 
heart o
f t
he progra m, moreso t
han
 
the songs t
he mselves.
 
An exciting f
ollow-up ensued,
 
much t

Media Waves:
 
Radio Lollipop
 
by F
J Swift
 
hen I
 was f
our years o
ld, I
 
was hospitalized f
or several
 
weeks. The nature of my i
l
lness
 
r
equired that I
 be ad mitted t
o a
 
specialized children's hospital,
 
miles f
ro m my ho me. My mo m
 
d
idn't drive, so she had t
o t
ake the
 
bus and t
ransfer twice, just t
o co me
 
and s
ee me. Then t
here was her
 j
ob
 
and my o
lder s
ister's child-care
 
needs. Suff
ice i
t
 t
o say, I
 d
idn't s
ee
 
my f
a mily much while I
 was i
n the
 
hospital.
 
I
t
 was a
 very unsettling experience.
 
There were t
he hundreds o
f needles
 
and constant t
ests f
ro m the doc-
t
ors. The nurses kept on changing;
 
I
 hardly knew anyone's na me. And
 
so mehow, t
he k
ids i
n t
he beds next
 
t
o me kept vanishing with no ex-
p
lanation. There were l
ong days
 
and even l
onger n
ights. I
 f
elt bored
 
and l
oneso me and very s
cared.
 
Nowadays, many hospital workers
 
s
ee m t
o be more s
ensitive t
o the
 
needs o
f children. There are spe-
c
ialized r
esidences, such as Ronald
 
McDonald houses, so that f
a milies
 
can s
tay near k
ids while they're
 
hospitalized. So me hospitals have
 
"
child-life" o
r "
fa mily-resource" s
er-
v
ices, bringing t
oys, books, and
 
t
apes t
o k
ids. And so me hospitals
 
even have a
 c
losed-circuit TV sys-
t
em, f
eaturing G-rated movies on
 
a
 continuous l
oop.
 
But surprisingly, there are f
ew or-
ganized, national progra ms that
 
address t
he l
oneliness and i
sola-
t
ion o
f k
ids i
n hospitals, here i
n the
 
United S
tates or i
n o
ther countries.
 
A
lthough t
here i
s the "Starwave"
 
i
nternet progra m, there are f
ew "
big
 
brothers i
n hospitals" or "hospital-
parent associations" that can l
ink
 
r
eal volunteers with r
eal k
ids or
 
bring entertain ment during those
 
l
ong af
ternoons and n
ights. That
 
i
s
, t
here were none until Radio Lol-
1

)01
)
 ca me a
long.
 
Radio Lollipop was s
tarted 1978 a
t
 
Queen Mary's Hospital f
or Children
 
i
n Surrey, England, by Mr. Hedley
 
F
inn. At the t
ime, Queen Mary's
 
was the l
argest children's hospital
 
i
n Europe, with over 36 wards on
 
92 acres. Yet, l
ike many hospitals,
 
Queen Mary's had no organized
 
entertain ment s
ervices f
or children.
 
Radio Lollipop had a s
imple goal:
 
t
o bring a
 s
teady s
trea m o
f n
ightly
 
entertain ment d
irectly t
o k
ids i
n
 
their beds. And what better way t
o
 
do this than through radio? The
 
p
lan i
ncluded providing children
 
with special phone l
ines l
inking
 
their r
oo ms d
irectly t
o the hos-
p
ital's onsite r
adio s
tudio, so that
 
they could call i
n r
equests o
r t
ell a
 
j
oke "
on the a
ir." Although the f
o-
cus o
f the progra m would be on t
he
 
n
ightly two-hour r
adio show, Ra-
d
io Lollipop would a
lso provide
 
o
ther services f
or k
ids, such as
 
parties and hands-on p
lay activi-
t
ies. The radio show would provide
 
the catalyst f
or bringing k
ids and
 
volunteer radio s
taff t
ogether.
 
And Radio Lollipop d
id provide t
hat
 
catalyst, with g
reat success. I
t
 t
ook
 
just over a
 year t
o raise f
unds, wire
 
the wards a
t Queen Mary's f
or ra-
d
io and t
elephone, build t
he s
tudio,
 
and r
ecruit a
 t
ea m o
f broadcasters
 
and f
acilitators. Soon, the Radio
 
Lollipop i
dea spread throughout
 
Great Britain. There are currently

Susan Hopkins. The progra m
 
s
tarted up and, under i
ts own d
i-
r
ection, r
ecruited volunteers f
or t

after-hours progra m. Katie says
 
that t
he Radio Lollipop progra m
 
has been a t
rue g
ift f
or Texas
 
Children's: "Before Radio Lollipop,

hat t
he
 
PDSS It on!

a

Katie and the s
taff a
t Texas Chil-
dren's have great p
lans f
or using
 
t
heir partnership with Radio Lolli-
pop t
o s
tart parallel activities as
 
well, such as "
the me weeks" and a
 
concert s
eries. I
n f
act, t
heir f
irst
 
concert guest was CMN's own José-
Luis Orozco, who appeared there
 
i
n early Dece mber 1999. "
It was
 
wonderful," notes Katie. "We had
 
20 f
a milies —kids and their par-
ents —and José-Luis d
id an i

volving progra m of English and

Social-Change
 
Discussion at
 
John Wool man
 
School
 
by Susan Hopkins
 
mong those who a
ttended
 
 
the California Statewide
 
Gathering i
n May was Jacki Breger,
 
and she f
ollowed this up with a
 day
 
o
f t
eaching a
t the John Wool man
 
School i
n Grass Valley. She i
s a
 
f
olksinger who v
isited the s
chool t
o
 
work with the s
tudents and s
taf
f
 
on the subject o
f music and social
 
change, f
ocusing on t
he C
ivil R
ights
 
Move ment. Music was an essential
 
part o
f that move ment, as i
t has
 
been with many, because i
t pro-
motes the values of supporting
 
change and co m munity building.
 
Music helps c
reate the solidarity
 
needed f
or the success of social-
change move ments. The f
ollowing
 
are my notes t
aken on the d
iscus-
s
ion that day.
 
Jacki posed t
he f
ollowing questions
 
t
o the s
tudents:
 
•
 How can we use music t
o sup-
port social change?
 
•
 What are you going t
o do t
o get
 
your generation t
o carry on and
 
go f
orward, and t
o get songs and
 
s
inging back i
nto move ments?
 
Justin: Unplug the machine; model
 
f
or our children. Raise our children
 
t
o know about and be a part of
 
making changes.
 
I
ssac: We need new songs, because
 
we have new i
ssues, but they r
e-
l
ate t
o the o
ld i
ssues. We should
 
i
ncorporate the o
ld songs.
 
E1 ah: Make songs that the young-
e
r generation can embrace. Keep
 
the o
ld songs, but new ones are
 
needed, t
oo, that are user f
r
iendly.
 
Su m mary o
f thoughts:
 
•
 Raise your children t
o be aware
 
o
f move ments and songs.
 
•
 Make up new songs.
 
Carry on the o
ld songs.
 
Jacki then o
ffered t
he s
tudents
 
so me things t
o keep i
n mind when
 
making up new songs:
 
•
 Out o
f every move ment/action
 
co me maybe hundreds o
f songs,
 
yet only a
 f
ew survive, which i
s
 
probably as i
t should be.
 
•
 Not every song made up "
on t
he
 
spot" i
s a "
great song." I
t may
 
f
ulfill a
 particular need, but not
 
go beyond that need or t
hat mo-
ment, or i
t may be t
oo hard f
or
 
people t
o r
e me mber.
 
•A "
great" song —the one that
 
l
asts —has three qualities: I
t
 
must be specific enough t
o
 
speak t
o the event/issue at
 
hand, t
o f
ulf
ill the needs o
f the
 
people i
n that particular action.
 
At the sa me t
ime, i
t must be
 
universal enough t
o t
ranscend
 
i
ts event o
f origin, t
o speak t
o
 
the broader i
ssues. F
inally, i
t
 
must be s
ingable f
or ordinary
 
f
olks.

or
ne children l

through music. Many o
f us
 
parents and t
eachers have known
 
t
hat f
or a
 l
ong t
ime, and f
or us, the
 
work o
f Howard Gardiner,*
 sug-
gesting t
hat there are s
everal t
ypes
 
o
f i

ncluding musical
 
i
ntelligence, i
s not r
eally news. But
 
i
t
's n
ice t
o have i
t confir med by a
 
r
espected t
heorist.
 
I
'
ll describe how E
loise, a
 
co mposite of several
 
children I
've known,
 
used music t
o l
earn
 
things  she  had
 
t
rouble l
earning i
n
 
o
ther ways. Eloise
 
had quite a b
it o
f
 
d
ifficulty in school.
 
F
irst o
f a
ll, she d
idn't quite un-
derstand how t
o r
elate with o
ther
 
children. She wanted t
he m t
o hurry
 
up and l
ike her, and she so meti mes
 
went up t
o the m and hugged the m,
 
whether o
r not they welco med her
 
hugs. Her f
avorite song was "Walk
 
a Mile," by Jan Nigro. I
ts chorus
 
says, "
I
 want t
o walk a
 mile i
n your
 
shoes; I
 want t
o know what you're
 
t
hinking, what you're f
eeling." Even
 
t
hough I
 wasn't sure she under-
s
tood a
ll t
he i
deas presented i
n t
hat
 
song, I
 think the song said so me-
t
hing important t
o her. I
 think i
t
 
helped her t
o t
hink about what o
th-
e
rs might be thinking and f
eeling.
 
E
loise d
id not f
ully understand the
 
c
lassroo m rules. She of
ten d
id what
 
her i
nclusion specialist t
old her t
o
 
do (
e
.g., hand i
n papers, s
tay i
n the
 
c
lassroo m, be quiet during expla-
nations), but she often d
idn't.
 
So meti mes I

s, I
'd
 
announce t
o the c
lass that we were
 
going t
o have a
 g
roup s
inging t
ime
 
a
fter a
 certain t
ask was co mpleted.
 
E
loise —and the o
ther children —
 
were eager t
o have that s
inging
 
t
ime, and they were willing t
o par-
t
icipate i
n l
ess-appealing activities
 
so that t
hey could have a chance
 
t
o s
ing t
ogether.
 
Children i
n Eloise's c
lass were
 
l
earning t
o think about mathe mat-
i
cs i
n a
 way that E
loise was not a
t
 
a
ll r
eady f
or. While they were
 
r
eading word proble ms and then
 
f
iguring out how t
o solve t
he m,
 
Eloise was l
earning t
o count. So
 
she was g
iven d
ifferent worksheets
 
t
o co mplete, though they l
ooked t
o
 
her l
ike the worksheets o
ther chil-
dren were doing. And the whole
 
c
lass d
id a musical p
lay about
 
mathe matics. I
t
 was called "Every-
body Counts." E
loise enjoyed being
 
part o
f that p
lay and s
inging as
 
o
ther children sang. I
t made her
 
and t
he r
est o
f the c
lass f
eel more
 
l
ike a
 co m munity.
 
I
t
's not that Eloise was an unusu-
a
lly t
alented s
inger. I
n f
act, i
f
 you
 
used t
he c
riteria of
ten used t
o
 judge
 
musical t
alent —pitch, rhyth m, and
 
a
ll —you probably would consider
 
her so mewhat below average. But
 
i
f you t
ook i
nto account Eloise's
 
l
ove f
or music, she was a s
tar.
 
Mu s
ic "vas her doorway t

d
idn't co me easily. When l
earning
 
i

Yeast to Make the Bread Rise:
 
Keynote Address t
o CMN's 1999 National Gathering
 
b
y Bess Lomax Hawes
 
I
f
eel particularly honored t
o have been i
n-
v
ited t
o address you s
ince i
t
's obvious t
o
 
me t
hat everyone here i
s f
ar more expert than I
 i
n
 
t
he a
rea o
f children's music, f
or everyone i
n the
 
Children's Music Network actively makes music
 
f
or and/or with children. And f
or s
o me 30 years,
 
I
 haven't —except f
or t
he a
ll-too-occasional get-
t
ogether with a
 g
randchild. So everything I
 know
 
i
s t
ruly out o
f date and o
ld hat, and I
 am perhaps
 
best described as a
 moldy f
ig even amongst f
olk-
l
orists.
 
Now, f
olklorists, moldy o
r not, are watchers; their
 
passion i
s t
o observe what people actually do and
 
say, and t
hen t
o t
hink about i
t
. And t
hey of
ten
 
g
et particularly i
nterested i
n t
hose t
hings people
 
do and say t
hat have l
asted a
 l
ong t
ime through
 
many many r
epetitions and perhaps beco me
 
anonymous. Such shared i
nformation t
ends t
o
 
c
ollect a
round people (
so metimes called "
folk")
 
who a
lso share a
 common f
eature l
ike l
anguage
 
o
r o
ccupation o
r r
eligion. So metimes f
olk g
roups
 
use such co mmon knowledge (
or l
ore) t
o express
 
t
heir special g
roup i
dentities. A f
olk g
roup can be
 
as small as a
 f
amily o
r as b
ig as a
 nation, t
hough
 
smallness i
s much more common.
 
I
t
's a
 n
ice l
i
fe, being a
 f
olklorist —you get t
o t
hink
 
about such i
nteresting t
hings, and I
 have abso-
l
utely l
oved i
t
. But even f
olklorists don't get t
o
 
spend a
ll t
heir t
ime being f
olklorists. L
ike every-
body e
lse i
n t
he world t
hey have t
o wash t
he d
ishes
 
and t
he baby and t
he dog, and t
hey have t
o go
 
g
et t
he mail and answer t
he phone and put up
 
t
he g
roceries. And I
 hope you will not be shocked
 
i
f
 I
 t
ell you t
hat during such ever-present energy-
c
onsuming activities l
ots o
f f
olklorists don't think
 
about t
heir profession f
or one split s
econd.
 
The t

t l
east a
 
vaguely professional g
rasp on what has been go-
i
ng on s
eems t
o come a
long af
ter t
he main action.
 
By way o
f i
l
lustration, l
et me t
ell you about some-
t
hing t
hat happened t
o me, during my f
olkloric
 
salad days.
 
My husband and I
 were l
iving i
n Topanga, Cali-
f
ornia, a
t t
he t
ime, a
long with our t
hree children,
 
then aged about s
even and a
 half
, s
ix, and f
ive. I
t
 
was an active bunch. We were a
lso very broke
 
and were l
iving i
n a r
idiculously small house,
 
probably originally built f
or a
 weekend getaway
 
cottage. My husband and I
 s
lept i
n the b
ig bed on
 
t
he s
ide porch; the three children i
n bunk beds
 
i
n the s
ingle bedroom. There was a small l
iving
 
r
oom, a
 minute k
itchen, and a
 bath with only a
 
shower s
tall. The f
amily g
rouping was f
urther
 
adorned by the presence of a dog na med
 
Quartsy —whom we had bargained f
or a
t a
 l
ocal
 
swapping f
air by t
rading s
everal quarts o
f my
 
homemade applesauce f
or one delightful puppy,
 
and thus t
he name Quartsy.
 
When I
 t
ook Quartsy t
o t
he l
ocal vet f
or a
 checkup,
 
he l
ooked sober. We had been t
oo naïve t
o i
nsist
 
on any k
ind o
f medical r
ecord, and t
he vet said
 
he d
idn't think our puppy had had the r
ight shots.
 
I
 suspect he knew a
t the t
ime that she was com-
i
ng down with d
iste mper, but hoped he could
 
f
orestall i
t
. His p
ills and our earnest administra-
t
ion o
f t
hem d
idn't s
ee m t
o help, and Quartsy
 just
 
got s
icker and s
icker. And then my husband got
 
a
 week-long
 j
ob out o
f s
tate and had t
o l
eave home
 
f
or s
everal days. We needed the work and t
he
 
money, and he had t
o go.
 
Well. Early one evening, then, I
 f
ound myself
 with
 
a
 dying dog, three young and passionately i
nter-
e
sted children, and no backup. Quartsy began t
o
 
have convulsions, and I
 f
inally l
ocked her i
n the
 
bathroom, a
fraid that i
n her spasms she might
 
b
ite someone. F
inally, she quieted down. I
 l
ooked
 
t
imorously a
t her —she was obviously dead —and
 
went i
nto the bedroom and t
old the children t
hat
 
Quartsy had d
ied, and now i
t
 was t
ime f
or a
ll o
f
 
us t
o go t
o bed. Which i
t was —and l
ate, t
oo. I
 
kept t
hinking I
 had t
o keep l
i
fe moving a
long i
n
 
as o
rdinary a
 r
outine as possible.
 
The children were a
ll o
f them cheerful and very
 
excited. They carefully i
nspected what they could
 
s
ee o
f Quartsy —she was l
ying covered by a
 t
owel
 
on the bathroom f
loor —then brushed their t
eeth,
 
-

put on t
heir pajamas and went t
o bed. I
 r
ead a
 
s
tory and sang each one a
 s
ong. There was only
 
one variation i
n t
he usual r
outine. The middle
 
child —the s
ix-year-old g
irl —bounced i
nto bed,
 
pulled up t
he covers, and said t
hat she wanted
 
e
verybody's animals t
o s
leep with. I
 said i
ncredu-
l
ously, "What?" She r
epeated her announce-
ment —it wasn't a
 r
equest —and t
hen I
 saw that
 
t
he o
ther two (
the o
lder and t
he younger) were
 
p
icking up t
heir own every-night-clutched-to-the
 
bosom s
tuffed animals, f
our o
r f
ive apiece, and
 
t
aking t
hem over t
o t
heir s
ister without any s
igns
 
o
f r
eluctance, as t
hough i
t
 were a
 s
tandard part
 
o
f
 t
he n
ightly r
outine. She went t
o s
leep t
hat n
ight
 
under a
 small mountain o
f s
tuffed t
oys. Nobody
 
e
lse had any a
t a
ll. Nobody s
eemed t
o mind.
 
During t
he n
ight I
 was waked up by my o
lder
 
daughter, who said t
hat she had been having bad
 
dreams about how I
 had d
ied. My husband was
 
away and I
 d
idn't f
eel a
ll t
hat good myself
, so I
 
t
ook her i
n t
he b
ig bed and we s
lept t
ogether
 
s
oundly t
he r
est o
f t
he n
ight t
hrough. There was
 
no word a
t a
ll f
rom t
he youngest child.
 
Next day was a
 s
chool day. I
 spent a
 good deal o
f
 
t
ime wondering what should I
 do now —get some-
body t
o co me and d
isappear t
he dog while the
 
children were away, wait t
i
ll t
hey got home t
o do
 
i
t
, o
r what. F
inally, I
 decided t
hat f
ate had brought
 
i
t
 about t
hat t
his was t
he t
ime f
or us as a
 f
amily
 
t
o l
earn about death —in i
ts proper c
ontext, when
 
i
t actually had happened. So when the children
 
came home af
ter s
chool, I
 announced that we
 
would be having a
 f
uneral. We were going t
o bury
 
Quartsy up t
he h
ill behind our house, where I
 
had a
lready dug a
 shallow g
rave i
n a
 p
lace where
 
we could go and v
isit her, and we should p
ick
 
s
ome f
lowers and t
hink o
f n
ice t
hings t
o say t
o
 
each o
ther about what a
 f
ine dog she was.
 
The c
eremony went of
f
 without a
 h
itch. We made
 
a s
traggly procession up t
he h
ill, me carrying
 
Quartsy who kept t
he bathroom t
owel as a
 shroud.
 
We each t
hrew a
 handful o
f d
irt on her as she l
ay
 
i
n t
he hole, and a
fter I
 had f
i
lled i
n with t
he shovel,
 
we patted i
t a
ll down and sprinkled t
he f
lowers
 
over her. The children were t
hrilled and happily
 
proposed t
hat we go down and make a
 p
icnic f
or
 
supper and co me back and eat i
t
 a
t t
he g
raveside.
 
But by t
his t
ime I
 had about had i
t
. I
 was myself
 
g
rieved over t
he dog, and f
rankly I
 was beginning
 
t
o wonder i
f
 a
ll our t
hree charming children were
 
s
ome k
ind o
f undiscovered monsters. Nobody had

s
omewhat overstimulated. And t
he i
dea o
f
 a
 merry
 
p
icnic a
t the g
rave s
imply r
evolted me. I
 said ab-
solutely not, and we a
ll t
railed back down the h
ill.
 
I
 can't r
emember any more i
f
 t
he f
ormer n
ight's
 
procedure with t
he animals was r
epeated. I
 r
ather
 
t
hink they were l
ef
t i
n whomever's bed they were
 
i
n a
t bedtime. My o
lder daughter again had wor-
r
iso me dreams about my survival, and again we
 
s
lept t
ogether except I
 d
idn't s
leep very well t
his
 
t
ime.
 
The next morning, a Saturday, my-f
ive-year-old
 
son appeared —all dressed, shiny, and cheerful —
 
a
te a
 hearty breakfast, and t
hen said, "Hey Ma,
 
s
ing me a
 dead song." Previously he had made no
 
co mment whatever about the dog o
r the f
uneral
 
or any o
f t
he adventures we had been having: he
 
had just come a
long s
erenely f
or t
he r
ide, so t
o
 
say, watching what was going on.
 
I
 said, "
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong." I
 hadn't
 
even had my coffee yet. But my son, was —and
 
s
till i
s
, f
or that matter —a perseverator. I
t
 has a
l-
ways been hard f
or h
im t
o l
et go o
f o
r t
o change a
 
perfectly good p
lan; sometimes I
 t
hink he never
 
has, he
 just moves things around a
 l
i
ttle o
r maybe
 
puts a
 particular problem on the back burner f
or
 
awhile. This makes f
or a s
trong and e
ff
icient
 
g
rown-up. But a
t t
he age o
f f
ive he handled t
hings

more d
irectly. He s
imply announced h
is needs and
 
r
epeated t
he news bulletin i
ndef
initely. After 10
 
o
r 20 more r
equests o
f "C' mon Ma, s
ing me a
 dead
 
s
ong," my i
rritation boiled over. I
 said, "
Look, I
 
just don't f
eel l
ike s
inging a

ong r
ight now.
 
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong. I
f
 you want a
 
dead song, go s
ing one yourself
."
 
He f
inally wandered outside. I
 drank my coffee
 
and f
elt abused and neglected. After awhile I
 heard
 
a
 young voice s
inging abstractedly out on t
he back
 
patio, acco mpanied only by t
he r
olling wheels o
f
 
a
 t
ruck he was pushing:

I
 have t
o say t
hat my r
eaction was, Well, t
hank
 
goodness he's t
hought one up. As t
he day went
 
on, so d
id our usual l
i
fe. We went on our weekly
 
Saturday expedition t
o t
he market and the pub-
l
ic l
ibrary. None o
f t
he children brought up t
he
 
subject o
f t
he dog o
r t
he f
uneral o
r anything a
t
 
t
hat t
ime —they d
id i
n a
 f
ew days —but basically
 
l
i
fe r
esumed i
ts o
ld pace and pattern, except t
hat
 
i
n t
he f
ollowing weeks I
 began t
o notice my son
 
was s
inging quite a
 l
arge nu mber o
f dead songs.
 
I
t
 got k
ind o
f overwhelming.
 
I
le sang,
 
Hush, l
i
ttle baby, don't you c
ry,
 
You know o

o d

A

He sang,
 
Who k
illed o

illed o
ld
 
Quartsy?
 
I
 said t
he sparrow with my l
i
ttle bow and
 
arrow,
 
I
t
 was I
,
 oh, i
t
 was I
.
 
Who dug h
is g

I
 said t
he snake, with my l
i
ttle spade and
 
rake,
 
I
t
 was I
,
 oh i
t
 was I
.
 
And he sang,
 
Old Quartsy i
s dead and l
aid i
n t
he g
round,
 
Laid i
n t
he g
round, l
aid i
n t
he g
round,
 
Old Quartsy i
s dead and l
aid i
n the g
round,
 
Way h
igh up.
 
There g

ree over h

And he sang,
 
Quartsy d
ied on Sunday, on Sunday, on
 
Sunday,
 
Quartsy d
ied on Sunday when the weather
 
was good.
 
We buried her on Sunday, on Sunday, on
 
Sunday,
 
We buried her on Sunday when t
he weather
 
was good.
 
And he sang,
 
Soon one morning death came a
-creeping i
n
 
t
he r
oom. (
3X)
 
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I
 do t
o
 
be saved?
 
Well, death done been here, t
ook my Quartsy
 
and gone. (
3X)
 
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I
 do t
o
 
be saved?
 
And he sang,
 
I
 had an o
ld dog and h
is name was Quartsy,
 
And I
 bet you f
ive dollars he's a
 good dog t
oo.
 
Co me on Quartsy, you good dog you. (

When Quartsy d
ied, he d
ied so hard
 
That he shook the g
round i
n my backyard.
 
I
t s
eemed t
o be endless. I
 began t
o worry af
ter
 
awhile. For heaven's sake, how many dead songs
 
was he going t
o co me up with? Admittedly h
is
 
poetic s
tandards were not t
erribly r
ef

And how many s
ongs about death d
id he know,
 
anyway? I
 had had absolutely no i
dea t
he extent
 
o
f h
is r
epertory o
f songs about morbidity. I
 got
 
k
ind o
f embarrassed: admittedly I
 had sung a
ll
 
t
hose s
ongs around t
he p
lace, but I
 wasn't t
each-
i
ng t
hem t
o t
he children, I
 was just s
inging what
 
came i
nto my head, and t
here are l
ots o
f t
radi-
t
ional and nontraditional songs about death, i
f
 
you s
top and t
hink about i
t
.
 
I
 t
hought a
 l
ot about t
he whole episode. For one
 
t
hing, t
he way t
hat the t
hree d
ifferent children
 
(
of t
hree d
ifferent ages, r
e member) had chosen t
o
 
deal with t
he dog's passing s
truck me particu-
l
arly. The o
lder child had t
aken t
he possibility o
f
 
death and l
aid i
t on me (
I
 suspect t
o shield her-
s
elf f
rom t
he even more t
errifying notion that she
 
herself could d
ie). The s
ix year o
ld had f
ound a
 
d
ifferent s
olution, by calling on a
ll the available
 
animals t
o protect her, i
n r
eturn I
 suppose f
or
 
g
iving t
hem a
 sociable and comfortable warm bed
 
t
o s
leep i
n —a very f
air arrangement, I
 thought.
 
I
n another way o
f putting i
t
, t
he o
lder child had
 
expressed her f
ears t
hrough another person, the
 
s
econd t
hrough t
hings t
hat she could handle and
 
manipulate, while t
he t
hird had t
ried t
o deal with
 
t
he desperately un-understandable e
vent symboli-
cally, t
hrough l
anguage. I
 began t
o r
ealize that,
 
o
f
 t
he three, my young s
on had had t
he l
east prac-
t
ice i
n t
alking about so mething so t
otally
 
unfamiliar and b
izarre as death, and that's prob-
ably why he d
idn't ever say anything much. The
 
g
irls had chattered on a
 good b
it, but they were
 
o
lder and could r
ead, and he d
idn't know the
 
proper t
echnical t
erms. The s
ongs a
llowed h
im t
o
 
t
alk about dying and death and f
unerals i
n an
 
appropriate and d
ignif
ied way.
 
And as he sang on and on and on (
quite cheer-
f
ully, by way: t
here was no t
ragic note i
n h
is dead
 
s
ongs as f
ar as I
 could t
ell), I
 wondered i
f
 he wasn't
 
a
lso, subliminally s
ort o
f
, absorbing the t
ruly v
i-
t
al message that experience as well as great
 
l
i
terature t
ells us about death, that i
t comes t
o
 
everybody and everything —gray geese and ma-
mas and cock r
obins and Old Rogers and Old
 
B
lues and Quartsys t
oo. I
 g
radually began t
o f
eel
 
l
ess peculiar about my children knowing a
ll t
hese
 
f
unny o
ld-timey s
ongs. Maybe t
hey f
ormed a

o

everybody knows f

's just
 
t
hat du mb t
hing you say when you go out f

o go s

t
 was only while I
 was writing out

t suddenly occurred t
o me that I
 
r
eally ought t
o get t
he d

ee i
f
 there
 
was any such t

had a

here i
t
 was i

active i
n i
ngesting and destroying waste and
 
harmful material, bacteria, e
tc. i
n t

worthy i

Grimm s

riginally known as "house-
hold t

airytales, and t
hey were t
old not
 
just t
o children but t
o whoever happened t
o be
 
a
round. Most children d
idn't have a
 special r
ep-

hey just p

Or f

or people don't usually t

For one o

that sometimes when the l

t

The l

t
hey have known i
t a

 have never i
nter-
v

they l
earned the song "Happy Birthday t
o You." I
t
 
has a
lways just been there. You hear i
t

A number o

 I

t
; I
 haven't checked i
t
 with an o
ff

ext:
 
I
 had a

Oh doggy Do-lally, so f
aithful and t

He l

lod-hoppers, golly-whoppers,
 
and soda poppers,
 
And that makes h

She l

And that's why she s

Well, I
 heard Pete Seeger s
ing t
his enchanting
 
s
ong, and I
 moved a
ll k
inds o
f mountains t
o get
 
t
he words (
i
t was new a
t t
he t
ime), and I
 t
aught i
t
 
t
o a c
lass o
f young women I
 had i
n a f
olksong
 
r
epertory course out i
n t
he San Fernando Valley.
 
I
t
 was spring, and we were meeting a
t one o
f t
he
 
women's houses, and t
he children who came with
 
t
heir mothers were p
laying a
round on the swings
 
and s
lides i
n t
he back yard where we were s
it-
t
ing. They had been carefully i
nstructed not t
o
 
bother us, and t
hey never d
id. Actually, they paid
 
no a
ttention t
o us whatever, t
hey just swung and
 
s
lid and dug i
n t
he sandpile.
 
I
n t
he meantime I
 was i
nforming their mothers
 
t
hat I
 was going t
o t
each t
hem a
 new children's
 
s
ong, but I
 d
id wonder i
f
 i
t
 might not turn out t
o
 
be a s
ong t
hat, t
hough ostensibly f
or children,
 
would actually be enjoyed more by g
rownups t
han
 
i
ts i
ntended audience. I
t s
eemed t
o me awfully
 
complex i
n s
tructure f
or k
ids and awfully f
ull o
f
 
l
ong words, mouth-f
illing and delightful as they
 
were. Anyway, I
 mentioned casually t
o the c
lass
 
t
hat i
f
 anybody got any i
nsights on how t
heir chil-
dren l
iked t
he pets s
ong, I
'd r
eally enjoy hearing
 
about i
t
. We sang i
t t
hrough t
hree or f
our t
imes,
 
a
long with s
o me o
ther songs, and packed up t
o
 
go home.
 
A month o

ater I
 got t

etter —well, now I
 
can't l
ay hands on i
t
, but sooner o

ater, as my

s
ister used t
o say, i
t
'll wash t
o the surface —and
 
I
've never i
n the 30 years o
r so s
ince f
orgotten
 
what i
t said anyway. I
t said that her son, aged
 
a
round 7
 o
r 8
, had been p
laying i
n the yard dur-
i
ng the c
lass and on the way home i
n the back
 
s
eat o
f t
he f
amily car had casually begun t
o s
ing
 
the pet song, and he had made i
t a
ll t
he way
 
t
hrough a
ll the verses. I
t made her f
eel t
erribly
 
i
nferior, because she couldn't r
emember more
 
than t
he f
irst f
ew l
ines. (
He was r
ight r
eady t
o
 
l
earn i
t
, you s
ee, and —clomp! —he got i
t
 a
ll a
t one
 
go.)
 
Furthermore, she said, i
n t
he next s
everal weeks
 
he had come up with two s
tanzas o
f h
is own. One
 
went l
ike t
his:
 
I
 have a
 squirrel, her name i
t
 i
s Pearl,
 
Oh squirly, oh whirly with a
 l
ong bushy t
ail.
 
She l
ives upon walnuts and f
at nuts and t
all
 
nuts,
 
And i
n su mmertime, she dances i
n t
he t
rees.
 
I
 wish I
 could have shown t
his t
o Malvina. I
t
 s
eems
 
t
o me those f
our l
ines would have assured her
 
that she had t
ruly h
it a
 home run t
o the children
 
she was s
inging f
or. At l
east t
his young man
 
showed h
is r
ecognition o
f a
 s
trong poetic s
truc-
t
ure; o
f
 i
nternal and external rhyme s
chemes; and
 
o
f thoughtful, colorful l
anguage; and f
inally he
 
demonstrated h
is own i
ndependent authority t
o
 
abandon a
ll the rules when c
ritical aesthetic i
s-
sues a
rose. I
f he wanted t
o say "
dances i
n the
 
t
rees," he could i
gnore t
he rhyme s
cheme and just
 
say i
t
.
 
His s
econd production was:
 
I
 have a
 s
ister, her name i
s Miss Blister,
 
Oh, s
ister, oh B
lister, I
 can't say a
 word.
 
She gets i
n my r
oom and she pulls down my
 
t
oys,
 
She i
s a
 b
ig pest, but I
 now c
lose my door.
 
Here we f
ind our poet utilizing the artistic s
truc-
t

f
ew experienced songwriters have not done t

lmost a

amous protest songs
 
a
re based on o
ther widely known t
unes and/or
 
verses, and t
hus they carry with t
hem a
 double
 
o
r t
riple emotional weight. A song that I
've of
ten
 
sung, "Charlie and the MTA," was preceded by
 
"The New York Subway That Never Returned,"
 
"The [
Railroad] Train That Never Returned," and
 
"The Ship That Had Never Retu r
ned" —all well-

known and d
ifferent s
ongs, a
ll widely sung. Each
 
tr
agedy, t
hen, carried extra power s
temming f
rom
 
t
he previous versions.
 
What I
'm saying here i
s t
hat i
t
 i
s t
he contents o
f
 
one's head t
hat produce poetry, sympathy, a
ffec-
t
ion, understanding, co mprehension, c
reativity.
 
As parents and as t
eachers and as people who
 
s
imply exist a
long with our young on the same
 
p
lanet, i
t i
s c
rucial f
or us t

earned —structurally, poeti-
c
ally, e
thically, i

'
ve a

pointed out, t
hese patterns and i

As I

Stitching Hands Raise Funds for CMN
 
by Sally Rogers

n
 o
f t
he j
obs o
f CMN board
 
me mbers i
s t
o think up as
 
many c
reative ways as possible t
o
 
raise money t
o keep our wonderful
 
organization af
loat. At a board
 
meeting prior t
o our 1997 gather-
i
ng i
n Nashville, I
 suggested we
 
s
tart a co m munity quilt, which
 
could s
erve both as a f
undraiser
 
and a banner o
f sorts f
or CMN. I
 
have been a quilter s
ince h
igh
 
s
chool and have worked on many
 
co m munity quilt projects, so the
 
process s
ee med quite doable t
o me.
 
The quilt was designed t
o be a
 
f
undraiser both while being made
 
and a
fter i
t was f
inished. F
irst we
 
sold t
he r
ight t
o make quilt squares
 
a
t a price o
f $25 per square. The
 
only c
reative l
imitations on the
 
squares were that they needed t
o
 
be 12" square and t
o have images
 
i
n keeping with CMN's mission. We
 
a
lso sold s
ignature s
trips (
5" by 2
"),
 
which one could s
ign i
n permanent
 
i
nk o
r paint. These precut s
trips o
f
 
muslin sold f
or $1 apiece. Our i
n-
t
ention was t
o make the quilt
 
f
inancially accessible t
o anyone
 
who wanted t
o participate. A s
ig-
nature s
trip was s
ent t
o each CMN
 
me mber, with a l
etter describing
 
the whole project.
 
Many o
f the s
ignature s
trips and
 
squares were s
ent i
n before the
 
Nashville gathering convened. But
 
many more were co mpleted a
t the
 
gathering, i
n an a
t mosphere of
 
c
razy, c
reative cooperation. Blank
 
squares and s
trips were available
 
t
o participants, and s
everal s
ewing
 
machines were brought i
n. Katherine
 
Dines made sure our l
i
ttle quilting
 
group had an area i
n which t
o
 
work. S
ince i
t
 was on the edge o

By the end o
f the gathering, over

ask o

 was f
inally able t
o f
inish t

t
op f
or the 1999 gathering i

 brought i
t
, p
lus batting
 
and the backing, with the i
ntention
 
o

tying o
ff' t
he quilt during the
 
gathering. Thanks t
o the s
titching
 
hands o
f many (
especially Mara
 
Sapon-Shevin and s
everal young
 
people), the quilt was co mpletely
 
f
inished before the end o
f the gath-
ering, and we had i
t
 as a
 backdrop
 
f
or one n
ight o

I
t i
s gorgeous! The quilt nearly
 
s

ing every square. The na mes

t i
s available f

Now t
he question i
s, What happens
 
with the quilt f
ro m t
his point on'?
 
There has been so me call t
o r
affle
 
i
t of
f
. This would have the poten-
t
ial of raising several thousand
 
dollars f
or CMN. Other i
deas have
 
i
ncluded making p

o
f the quilt, t
o be be sold a
t gather-

And then I

 l

and I
 actually got t

t got
 
t

 would go down i

 actually s
tarted t
eaching
 
percussion s
tudents privately when
 
I
 was i

inth grade. I
 had private
 
s
tudents a
ll the way through i

an early age I
 got t
o see how there
 
were t
imes when everything would
 
suddenly make s
ense f
or a
 s
tudent,
 
and a
 l
ight bulb would go of

imes that were just eu-
phoric, where my heart would get
 
pu mping and my emotions would
 
t
ake control o

f
e

whether i

Twin C

musicals i

f

t

The t

P

BS: They might p
lay a song a
t a
 
s
chool concert that r
ef
lects a c

t
ain t

culture. As t
hey r

They'd l
isten t

exa mple o

Perhaps they'd s

ample, when we were s
tudying

isplay o
f
 
i

f I
ndia, so we saw a
 
s
itar and t
abla and t
a mbora. Be-
f
ore we l
ef

alked about a
 
raga and a t
ala and the ways the
 
s
cales are put t
ogether, and how
 
meter i
s more than 4/4. We d
is-
cussed the caste syste m and how
 
music education d
iffers with caste.
 
I
n this progra m we t
alked a l
ot
 
about function —how music or
 
i
nstru ments had multiple r
el-
evances i
n a
 particular culture. The
 
shakuhachi was used by Japanese
 
monks f
or a
 means o
f self-expres-
s
ion and entertain ment and a
lso f
or
 
self-defense. When they were
 
walking f
ro m v
illage t
o v
illage
 
they'd use that f
lute as a c
lub t
o
 
ward of
f
 r
obbers. The s
tudents had
 
a
 chance t
o s
ee how co mposers' l
i
fe
 
c
ircu mstances a
ffected t
heir co m-
positions, and then we would
 
perform t
heir p
ieces.
 
P
lO!: How d
oes a
 s
tudent get t
o b
e a
 Mas-
t
er Musician?
 
BS: I
n our s
chool, every t
ri mester,
 
s
tudents were t
ested on the i
nfor-
mation f
ro m the JVC Anthology of
 
Music and Dance. Whoever passed
 
by co mpleting 90 percent o
f the
 
questions correctly got extra c
redit
 
that would be banked t
oward co m-
p
leting a
ll n
ine o
f the t
ests. I
f
 they
 
co mpleted a
ll n
ine af
ter t
hree years,
 
had participated i
n solo or en-
s
e mble p
laying each o
f the three
 
years, and had co mpleted a
 major
 
project such as c
reating an i
nstru-
ment o
r s
tudying a
 musical g
roup
 
or culture, then their na me ap-
peared as a
 Master Musician on a
 
p
laque i
n the band r
oom. They were
 
honored a
t an awards c
ere mony,
 
they got a
 t
rophy, and t
heir na me
 
appeared i
n the l
ocal paper.
 
P

s t
he p
rogram f
or e
verybody? How
 
d
o y
ou f

BS: I
n our s
chool i
t
 was f
or middle-
s
chool band k
ids. But i
t
 could have
 
easily been adapted t
o middle-
school choir or other music
 
courses. About half o
f our s
ixth
 
g
raders were i
n the band.
 
P
lO!: So t
his p
rogram was popular a
nd
 
p
restigious. A

t y
our

P

o
 
b

BS: R
ight. So me k
ids who weren't
 
great perfor mers d
id r
eally well
 
with this progra m. The t
ests gave
 
the m a chance t
o shine. Many
 
wanted t
o r
etake t
he t
est, because
 
they hadn't passed i
t
. I
t
 was r
eally
 
important t
o the m, so so meti mes
 
we'd have a
 dozen k

P

BS: Well t
o c
larify, not everybody
 
that s
tarts i
n s
ixth grade s
tays i
n
 
band through e
ighth g
rade. So me
 
drop out because they want t
o do
 
so mething e
lse or band's just not
 
f
or the m. And i
n our s
chool we l
ost
 
so me s
tudents who were f
orced t
o
 
make decisions about whether t
o
 
concentrate on, say, f
oreign l
an-
guage o
r band. But o
f the k
ids who
 
were s
till i
n band i
n t
heir e
ighth-
grade year, there were 4 Master
 
Musicians i
n the f
irst year we had
 
the progra m. By my l
ast year i
n
 
middle s
chool, I
 think we had 16,
 
so i
t
 r
eally b
losso med. The percent-
age kept i
ncreasing.

f the
 
Revolutionary War. The geography
 
t
eachers were anxious t
o use the
 
JVC Anthology, because that con-
nected so s
trongly with their
 
curriculu m. For i
nstance, there
 
was a
 p
iece on the postal workers
 
i
n one African country. As they
 
were s

t
hey kept rhyth m with their s

P

BS: You bet. There's a square-

can t
alk about math by t
aking 16
 
and d
ividing i

, and you get
 
d

or each section.
 
And then the pulse o
f a
 p

f
ast i
s i
t going, what d
ictates that
 
pulse? Well, a square dance i
s a
 
certain t
e mpo because your f
eet
 
can only go a
t that t
e mpo, so t
here
 
were so me parallels i
n that unit as
 
well.

?
 
BS: Well, yeah, there were k
ids who
 
f
ound a chance t
o shine. There
 
were k
ids who were not successful
 
i
n o
ther ways, but who d
id well i
n
 
music. One extre me exa mple was
 
a boy who's s
everely autistic and
 
r
eally had a hard t
ime with per-
sonal i
nteractions. He could make
 
h
i mself vo mit when he d
idn't l

what was happening. Once he
 
broke the arm o
f one o
f h
is para-
professionals because he d
idn't l
ike
 
the d
irection i
n which he was be-
i
ng t
aken. And yet he had r
eally
 
s
trong f
eelings about Star Wars.
 
And h
is s
inging was i
ncredible. We
 
do a
 call-and-response thing, just
 
t
o get k
ids matching p
itch, and I
'd
 
say [
sings] "Tell me about your
 
weekend," and they'd s
ing, "Very
 
f
ine, Mr. Smith," or whatever. This
 
boy had not been very connected
 
i
n c
lass until one day I
 sang, "Tell
 
me about t
he S
tar Wars movie t
hat
 
you saw." He sang an
 
aria. I
t went on and
 
on, and the o
ther
 
k
ids —their
 j
aws were
 
on t
he f
loor. They ap-
p
lauded when he we
 
f
inished. For that

n Min-

guns or they can choose the dru m,
 
d
u nce, drama, debate, their voice.
 
But we must g
ive the m choices and
 
opportunities. Studies show that
 
t
he r
eason why k
ids are i
n gangs
 
i
s not f
or drugs or money, i
t
's t
o
 
belong. So which gang i
s i
t going
 
t
o be? The one i
nside the s
chool
 
music roo m or the one on the
 
s
treet?

US: I
t varies f
ro m d
istrict t
o d
is-
t
r
ict. I
 think as arts educators, we
 
have a
 r
esponsibility t
o educate not
 
only our s
tudents, but a
lso our
 
co m munities, by speaking t
o the
 
importance o
f t
he arts. This edu-
cation has t
o co me before a
 budget
 
co mes up f
or a vote, because by
 
t
hen i
t
's usually t
oo l
ate. Alter the
 
cuts happen, i
ts r
eally hard, t
hen
 
i
t
 beco mes militant and defensive.
 
I
t
's important t
o get the parents
 
and k
ids out t
o t
he board meetings
 
i
n advance. There are r
eally two
 
s
teps, you know, offensive and
 
defensive. Fro m an o
ffensive s
tand-
point, we publish material and
 
d
istribute i
t t
o parents r
egularly.
 
Even i
n the progra ms we hand out
 
a
t s
chool concerts, we devote one-
e
ighth o
f t
he space t
o advocacy. We
 
o
ffer i
nfor mation on s
tudies that
 
show that k
ids l
earn t
o r
ead better
 
when they're able t
o s
ing i
n k
in-
dergarten and f
irst grade. I
f t
hey
 
s
ing on a
 r
egular basis, t
hey're go-
i
ng t
o be even better. I
 urge any arts
 
educator t
o t
ake those advocacy
 
opportunities when publishing a
 
progra m o
r putting out a
 newslet-
t
er. Be v
isible. Take advantage o
f
 
co m munity-
 s
ervice opportunities.

bring that's a

i
t
's rare t
o have a male t

 hope that I

t
's okay t

and dance. We dance every day. I
t
's
 
good f
or the m t
o s
ee an adult male

Now, f

idiculously small house,
 
probably o
riginally built f
or a
 weekend g
etaway
 
c
ottage. My husband and I
 s
lept in t
he b
ig bed on
 
t
he s
ide porch; t
he t
hree children in bunk beds
 
in t
he s
ingle bedroom. There was a
 small l
iving
 
r
oom, a
 minute k
itchen, and a
 bath with only a
 
shower s
tall. The f
amily g
rouping was f
urther
 
adorned by the presence of a dog named
 
Quartsy—whom we had bargained f
or a
t a
 l
ocal
 
swapping f
air by t
rading s
everal quarts o
f my
 
homemade applesauce f
or one delightful puppy,
 
and t
hus t
he name Quartsy.
 
When I
 t
ook Quartsy t
o t
he l
ocal v
et f
or a
 checkup,
 
he l
ooked s
ober. We had been t
oo naïve t
o i
nsist
 
on any k
ind o
f medical r
ecord, and t
he v
et said
 
he d
idn't t
hink our puppy had had t
he r
ight shots.
 
I
 suspect he knew a
t t
he t
ime t
hat she was c
om-
i
ng down with d
istemper, but hoped he c
ould
 
f
orestall i
t
. His p
ills and our e
arnest administra-
t
ion o
f
 t
hem d
idn't s
eem t
o help, and Quartsy
 j
ust
 
got s
icker and s
icker. And t
hen my husband got
 
a
 week-long
 J
ob out o
f
 s
tate and had t
o l
eave home
 
f
or s
everal days. We needed t
he work and t
he
 
money, and he had t
o go.
 
Well. Early one evening, t
hen, I
 f
ound myself
 with
 
a
 dying dog, t
hree young and passionately i
nter-
e
sted children, and no backup. Quartsy began t
o
 
have c
onvulsions, and I
 fmally l
ocked her i
n t
he
 
bathroom, a
fraid t
hat i
n her spasms she might
 
b
ite s
omeone. F
inally, she quieted down. I
 l
ooked
 
t
imorously a
t her —she was obviously dead —and
 
went i
nto t
he bedroom and t
old t
he children t
hat
 
Quartsy had d
ied, and now i
t
 was t
ime f
or a
ll o
f
 
us t
o go t
o bed. Which i
t was —and l
ate, t
oo. I
 
kept t
hinking I
 had t
o keep l
i
fe moving a
long i
n
 
as o
rdinary a
 r
outine as possible.
 
The children were a
ll o
f t
hem cheerful and v
ery
 
excited. They carefully i
nspected what t
hey c
ould
 
s
ee o
f Quartsy —she was l
ying c
overed by a
 t
owel
 
on t
he bathroom f
loor—then brushed t
heir t
eeth,
 
-
Page 2 -
put on t
heir pajamas and went t
o bed. I
 r
ead a
 
s
tory and sang each one a
 s
ong. There was only
 
one variation i
n t
he usual r
outine. The middle
 
child —the s
ix-year-old g
irl —bounced i
nto bed,
 
pulled up t
he c
overs, and said t
hat she wanted
 
e
verybody's animals t
o s
leep with. I
 said i
ncredu-
l
ously, "What?" She r
epeated her announce-
ment —it wasn't a
 r
equest —and t
hen I
 saw t
hat
 
t
he o
ther two (
the o
lder and t
he younger) were
 
p
icking up t
heir own e
very-night-clutched-to-the
 
bosom s
tuffed animals, f
our o
r f
ive apiece, and
 
t
aking t
hem over t
o t
heir s
ister without any s
igns
 
o
f r
eluctance, as t
hough i
t
 were a
 s
tandard part
 
o
f t
he n
ightly r
outine. She went t
o s
leep t
hat n
ight
 
under a
 small mountain o
f s
tuffed t
oys. Nobody
 
e
lse had any a
t a
ll. Nobody s
eemed t
o mind.
 
During t
he n
ight I
 was waked up by my o
lder
 
daughter, who said t
hat she had been having bad
 
d
reams about how I
 had d
ied. My husband was
 
away and I
 d
idn't f
eel a
ll t
hat good myself
, s
o I
 
t
ook her i
n t
he b
ig bed and we s
lept t
ogether
 
s
oundly t
he r
est o
f t
he n
ight t
hrough. There was
 
no word a
t a
ll f
rom t
he youngest child.
 
Next day was a
 s
chool day. I
 spent a
 good deal o
f
 
t
ime wondering what should I
 do now —get s
ome-
body t
o come and d
isappear t
he dog while t
he
 
children were away, wait t
i
ll t
hey got home t
o do
 
i
t
, o
r what. F
inally, I
 decided t
hat f
ate had brought
 
i
t
 about that t
his was t
he t
ime f
or us as a
 f
amily
 
t
o l
earn about death —in i
ts p
roper context, when
 
i
t
 a
ctually had happened. So when t
he children
 
came home af
ter s
chool, I
 announced that we
 
would be having a
 f
uneral. We were going t
o bury
 
Quartsy up t
he h
ill behind our house, where I
 
had a
lready dug a
 shallow g
rave i
n a
 p
lace where
 
we c
ould go and v
isit her, and we should p
ick
 
s
ome f
lowers and t
hink o
f n
ice t
hings t
o say t
o
 
each o
ther about what a
 f
ine dog she was.
 
The c
eremony went of
f
 without a
 h
itch. We made
 
a s
traggly procession up t
he h
ill, me carrying
 
Quartsy who kept t
he bathroom t
owel as a
 shroud.
 
We each t
hrew a
 handful o
f d
irt on her as she l
ay
 
i
n t
he hole, and a
fter I
 had f
i
lled i
n with t
he shovel,
 
we patted i
t a
ll down and sprinkled t
he f
lowers
 
over her. The children were t
hrilled and happily
 
p
roposed t
hat we go down and make a
 p
icnic f
or
 
supper and co me back and eat i
t
 a
t t
he g
raveside.
 
But by t
his t
ime I
 had about had i
t
. I
 was myself
 
g
rieved over t
he dog, and f
rankly I
 was beginning
 
t
o wonder i
f
 a
ll our t
hree charming children were
 
s
ome k
ind o
f undiscovered monsters. Nobody had

dea o
f

p
icnic a
t t
he g

imply r
evolted me. I
 said ab-
s

ll t
railed back down t
he h
ill.
 
I
 can't r
emember any more i
f
 t
he f

epeated. I
 r
ather
 
t

hey were l
ef
t i
n whomever's bed t
hey were
 
i
n a

r
isome dreams about my survival, and again we
 
s
lept t
ogether except I
 d
idn't s
leep v
ery well t
his
 
t
ime.
 
The next morning, a
 Saturday, my-f
ive-year-old
 
s
on appeared —all dressed, shiny, and cheerful —
 
a
te a
 hearty breakfast, and t
hen said, "Hey Ma,
 
s
ing me a
 dead s
ong." Previously he had made no
 
c
omment whatever about t
he dog o
r t
he f
uneral
 
o
r any o
f t
he adventures we had been having: he
 
had just come a
long s
erenely f
or t
he r
ide, s
o t
o
 
say, watching what was going on.
 
I
 said, "
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong." I
 hadn't
 
even had my coffee yet. But my s
on, was —and
 
s
till i
s
, f
or t
hat matter —a perseverator. I

puts a
 particular problem on t
he back burner f
or
 
awhile. This makes f
or a s
trong and e
fficient
 
g
rown-up. But a
t t
he age o
f f
ive he handled t
hings
 
-

more d
irectly. He s
i mply announced h
is needs and
 
r
epeated t
he news bulletin i
ndefinitely. After 1
0
 
o
r 20 more r
equests o
f "C'mon Ma, s
ing me a
 dead
 
s
ong," my i
rritation boiled over. I
 said, "
Look, I
 
just don't f
eel l
ike s
inging a

ong r
ight now.
 
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong. I
f
 you want a
 
dead song, go s
ing one yourself
."
 
He f
inally wandered outside. I
 drank my cof
fee
 
and f
elt abused and neglected. Af
ter awhile I
 heard
 
a
 young voice s
inging abstractedly out on t
he back
 
patio, accompanied only by t
he r
olling wheels o
f
 
a
 t
ruck he was pushing:
 
Go t
ell Aunt Nancy, go t

hat my r

goodness he's t
hought one up. As t

on, s
o d
id our usual l
i
fe. We went on our weekly

subject o

he f

hat t
ime —they d

hat
 
i
n t
he f
ollowing weeks I
 began t
o notice my s
on
 
was s
inging quite a
 l
arge number o
f dead s

I
t
 got k
ind o
f overwhelming.
 
He sang,

He sang,

I
 said t
he sparrow with my l
i
ttle bow and

,
 oh, i

I
t

 oh i

And he sang,

And he sang,

he weather
 
was good.
 
We buried her on Sunday, on Sunday, on

We buried her on Sunday when t

And he sang,
 
Soon one morning death came a

Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I
 do t

Well, death done been here, t
ook m y Q uartsy
 
and gone. (

Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I

And he sang,

And I
 bet you f

 good dog t

Come on Quartsy, you good dog you. (

When Quartsy d
ied, he d

o hard
 
That he shook t
he g
round i

I
t s
eemed t
o be endless. I
 began t

ter
 
awhile. For heaven's sake, how many dead s

was he going t

t
his t

t suddenly o
ccurred t
o me t
hat I
 
r
eally ought t
o get t
he d
ictionary and s
ee i
f
 t
here
 
was any such t
hing as a phagocyte anyway. I
t
 
had a
lways had a sort o
f Lewis Carroll "
slithy
 
t
oves" f
eeling t
o me. But by gum, t
here i
t
 was i
n
 
t
he o
ld Webster's —"a phagocyte: any l
eukocyte
 
active i
n i
ngesting and destroying waste and
 
harmful material, bacteria, e
tc. i
n t
he b
lood o
r
 
t
issues o
f t

worthy i
tems t
o be s
timulated, and I
'm g
lad t
o
 
know t
hat, a
fter a
ll t
hese years.
 
But i
n a
 s
ense i
t
 d
idn't r

going on. That's how my son's dead songs worked.
 
He d
idn't, I
 suspect, know t
hey were about death
 
until he needed t
hem and called on t

here t

You know, i
t
's only r
elatively r
ecently anyway t
hat
 
adults began t
o write special children's l
i
terature,
 
s
ongs f
or children, and so f
orth. I
n a
 b
iography o
f
 
t
he l
imerick maker Edward Lear, I
 was surprised
 
t
o f
ind t
hat he and Lewis Carroll were not only
 
c
onte mporaries, t
hey were r
egarded as r
adical
 
p
ioneers i
n t
he f
ield o
f children's l
i
terature. The
 
Grimm s
tories were originally known as "
house-
hold t
ales," not f
airytales, and t
hey were t
old not
 
just t
o children but t
o whoever happened t
o be
 
a
round. Most children d
idn't have a
 special r
ep-
e
rtoire a
ll f
or t
hemselves, t
hey just p
icked up
 
whatever poetry, song, and s
tory t
hey heard
 
g
rown-ups t

ther g

t
hey f
ully c
omprehended them o
r not, t
hey would
 
t
uck t
hem away f
or f
uture i

Or f
or t

aw materials. Avery g

 I

I
 had a

Oh doggy Do-lally, s

He l
ived upon c

and s
oda poppers,
 
And t

Oh f

She l

And t

Well, I
 heard Pete Seeger s
ing t
his enchanting
 
s
ong, and I
 moved a
ll k
inds o
f mountains t
o g
et
 
t
he words (
i
t was new a
t t
he t
ime), and I
 t
aught i
t
 
t
o a
 c
lass o
f young women I
 had i
n a f
olksong
 
r
epertory course out i
n t
he San Fernando Valley.
 
I
t
 was spring, and we were meeting a
t one o
f t
he
 
women's houses, and t
he children who came with
 
t
heir mothers were p
laying a
round on t
he swings
 
and s
l
ides i
n t
he back yard where we were s
it-
t
ing. They had been carefully i
nstructed not t
o
 
bother us, and t
hey never d
id. Actually, t
hey paid
 
no a
ttention t
o us whatever, t
hey
 just swung and
 
s
l
id and dug i
n t
he sandpile.
 
I
n t
he meantime I
 was i
nforming t
heir mothers
 
t
hat I
 was going t
o t
each t
hem a
 new children's
 
s
ong, but I
 d
id wonder i
f
 i
t
 might not t
urn out t
o
 
be a s
ong t
hat, t
hough o
stensibly f
or children,
 
would a
ctually be enjoyed more by g
rownups t
han
 
i
ts i

t s
eemed t
o me awfully
 
c
omplex i
n s
tructure f
or k
ids and awfully f
ull o
f
 
l
ong words, mouth-filling and delightful as t
hey
 
were. Anyway, I
 mentioned casually t
o t
he c
lass
 
t
hat i
f
 anybody g
ot any i
nsights on how t
heir chil-
dren l
iked t
he pets s
ong, I
'd r
eally enjoy hearing
 
about i
t
. We sang i
t
 t
hrough t
hree o
r f
our t
imes,
 
a
long with s
ome o
ther s
ongs, and packed up t
o
 
go home.
 
A month o
r s

 got t
his l
etter —well, now I
 
can't l
ay hands on i
t
, but s
ooner o
r l

I
'
ve never i
n t
he 30 years o
r s
o s
ince f
orgotten
 
what i
t said anyway. I
t said t
hat her s
on, aged
 
a
round 7
 o
r 8
, had been p
laying i
n t
he yard dur-
i
ng t
he c
lass and on t
he way home i
n t
he back
 
s
eat o
f t
he f
amily car had casually begun t
o s
ing
 
t
he pet s
ong, and he had made i
t a
ll t
he way
 
t
hrough a
ll t
he verses. I
t made her f
eel t
erribly
 
i
nferior, because she couldn't r
emember more
 
t
han t
he f
i
rst f
ew l
ines. (
He was r
ight r
eady t
o
 
l
earn i
t
, you s
ee, and —clomp!-
---he got i
t
 a
ll a
t one
 
go.)
 
Furthermore, she s
aid, i
n t
he next s
everal weeks
 
he had c
ome up with two s
tanzas o
f
 h
is own. One
 
went l
ike t
his:
 
I
 have a
 squirrel, her name i
t
 i
s Pearl,
 
Oh squirly, oh whirly with a
 l
ong bushy t
ail.
 
She l
ives upon walnuts and f
at nuts and t
all
 
nuts,
 
And i
n summertime, she dances i
n t
he t
rees.
 
I
 wish I
 c
ould have shown t
his t
o Malvma. I
t
 s
eems
 
t
o me t
hose f
our l
ines would have assured her
 
t
hat she had t
ruly h
it a
 home run t
o t
he children
 
she was s
inging f
or. At l
east t
his young man
 
showed h
is r
ecognition o
f a
 s
trong poetic s
truc-
t
ure; o
f
 i
nternal and external rhyme s
chemes: and
 
o
f t
houghtful, c
olorful l
anguage; and f
inally he
 
demonstrated h
is own i
ndependent authority t
o
 
abandon a
ll t
he rules when c
ritical a
esthetic i
s-
sues a
rose. I
f he wanted t
o say "
dances i
n t
he
 
t
rees," he c
ould i
gnore t
he rhyme s
cheme and
 j
ust
 
say i
t

His s
econd production was:
 
I
 have a
 s
ister, her name i
s Miss B
lister,
 
Oh, s
ister, oh B
lister, I
 can't say a
 word.
 
She g
ets i

t

She i
s a

 now c
lose my door.
