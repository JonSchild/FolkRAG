[Letter from Alan Lomax to Carita Doggett Corse, May

May 27, 1942
Dr. Carita D. Corse, State Supervisor Statewide Writers' Project Work Projects
Administration 49 West Duval Street Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
We would like very much to examine all the prints you have of Florida folk groups, whether
they show actual recordings being made or not. Could you send us a comprehensive
selection of the prints you have on hand, as a loan? It is rather hard to tell from this
distance just what types of pictures will prove to be of use to us.
Sincerely yours, Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
