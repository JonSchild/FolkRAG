I am most grateful that Alan and I are in contact through
 
your intervention despite the circumstances - the illness. I
 
have been trying without success for some time now to reach
 
him and suggest we take up Brown Girl where we left off years
 
ago. Anyway,  we are,  you and I
,  going to carry the project
 
over the top. This I am sure will certainly give Alan some

You must know that Anne abd I started a documentary on dance
 
some years ago. There is really no reason when she has got
 
Alan's affairs into shape why she and I cannot take up that
 
project where we left it.  While there is life there is HOPE
 
don't you think?
 
(
Find?)  Alan soon and give him my love and my hope that he
 
will get better!
 
Send me the materials to be edited and let US get on with the
 
work.  With sincere concern and care for you all,  Bye.

ANANA 0
 The Trinidadian naional song form,  the
 
Calypso,  stems  from the African tradition of topical song -
-
the banter song is another example.  ANANA-O and ELE MISI 0
 
may be used as a spring board for introducing the important
 
topic of oral history.
 A class might take on the assignment
 
of interviewing all local citizens over the age of  60 to find
 
out about how their own town or village came  into existence,
 
who moved in first,  how the fields or streets were first laid
 
out,  who b uilt the o munity,  etc.
 Such vivid local history
 
should be carefully recorded and read back to the other class
 
members  for confirmation and discussion.
 Some classes have
 
produced their own small  "books" detailing such information.
 
Such projects are not only important  in the education of
 
children,  they are important to the self-understanding of the
 
communities  involved.
 Too much human history dies every year
 
as the people who remember "what  really happened" pass away.
 
MEET ME ON THE ROAD.
 JD discussions concerning the many ways
 
any society controls violence by imposing order upon it.
 The
 
tourney of medieval knighthood might be one example,  the
 
American game of football another,  the kalinda a third,  the
 
"rules of modern warfare" another.
 It  is  important that
 
students  see that violence and fighting are not the property
 
of only a single culture.
 
VIO VIO LE
 Overlap produces a harmonic interval;  it also
 
stands  for a habit of interaction notably African.
 In
 
African tradition,  two or more individuals can speak,  sing,
 
or dance different patterns  in overlap without  interfering
 
with one another,  in fact,  the overlapping of parts often
 
results  in an exciting ensemble effect.
 (Later -
-
 MARY AND
 
MARTHA -
-
 It  (overlap)  is a warm and supportive singing
 
style,  though it may prove difficult  for singers  from
 
European backgrounds who are used to a respectful pause
 
between solo and chorus  lines!
 The taunting or
 
teasing element  in this  song shows how folklore is used by a
 
dominant black group against a minority.
 
MANGO TI-N
 (Much overlap)
 It might be fun for a class to
 
try singing this  song without any overlap whatever cutting
 
the ends of the  lines off short  (which would be the European
 
way of doing it)  to experience the difference for themselves.
 
Again,  turn-taking,  sharing social space and group support of
 
individual expressivity -
 main African themes -
 are the basic
 
structures  in the play activity.
 They can be pointed out and
 
taught as  cultural universals that are particularly emphazied
 
in African and Afro-American childrens games.
 
ROLLING SHILLING  (May have already used this  in headnote) The
 
shift  in stress on the syllables of the word "rolling"  is one
 
more example of the African approach to expressive behavion,
 
where change and variation is the rule.
 In dance,  change of
 
level,  of side,  of emphasis,  of tempo,  of meter is the
 
essence of art.
 This  is the Caribbean practice of shifting
 
verbal background of accent,  in speech and song.
 This  skill
 
gave the black man playful control over the language of his
 
masters.
 Sometimes he accented so many "wrong"  syllables as
 
to make it  impossible  for whites to understand him.
 
MOUIN LEVE LINDI EON MATIN Simple counting through the
 
musical transcription of this  song is a cmplex undertaking
 
for advanced music students.  After an attempt has been made,
 
it might be interesting for a class to try learning the
 
melody from the recording.  Learning directly from the singers
 
is the method of choice in almost every soceity in the world
 
except  for those few Europeans who actually can read music.
 
No child or adult  should ever feel ashmaed of using this age-
old and most reliable method of learning music.
 
BLUE BIRD
 Note how this
 
procedures,  maintainence
 
transformations of group
 
procedures captured here
 
little song is  sometimes
 
may call a child wearing
 
game teaches turen-taking,  step-wise
 
of clear-cult  formations,  and
 
pattenrs -
-
 all v aluable social
 
in recreational form.
 This pleasant
 
atered by children who,  for example,
 
a white  shirt a "white bird".
 \
 
This kind of poetic initiative on the part of children can be
 
encouraged by teachers rather than enforcing the  "right" way
 
of singing the  song.
 Creative editing of this kind is an
 
important  factor in the child's enjoyment of these
 
traditional pastimes,  and it has  frequently led to the
 
development of new and genuinely artistic variations.
 
ROMAN SOLDIERS Children may enjoy learning such "pretend"
 
activities are reflections of historical reality;  that the
 
Romans and the Britons actually did fight,  and that
 
generations of children have re-enacted their struggles.
 For
 
some few children a realization of this kind may be the  first
 
glimpse of the marvel of man's historical memory which
 
stretches back,  in such apparentl trivial forms as the
 
playing of childrens'  games,  over centuries and centuries of
 
human time.

Dear J.D.
 
3800 North Fairfax Dr.  #410
 
Arlington,  Va.  22203
 
August  21,  1996
 
I have  some really good news.  Pantheon Press has accepted the
 
manuscript of Brown Girl in the Ring and will  soon be sending
 
both you and Alan the rest of your advance payments.  Finally!
 
Hooray,  hooray!
 
I have asked Alan's office to send you a copy of the current
 
manuscript  (
the one  I sent Pantheon)  as  soon as possible.  We
 
will need to talk over  (or perhaps  just write to each other
 
over)  some of the changes  I have made.  For one thing,  it was
 
necessary to cut that  remarkable interview with you that Alan
 
edited;  it was  so long that  it over-balanced the book badly.
 
So  I took the liberty of cutting it and then adding to Alan's
 
introduction a statement that Brown Girl simply includes
 
exerpts  from a longer manuscript by you which it  is hoped
 
will appear one day separately.  And that  is  just the way that
 
Alan felt and I feel.  Dear J.D.,  I really hope you will take
 
that original piece,  expand it,  maybe take your story
 up to
 
your first teaching job or further,  and make it  into its own
 
book.  The entire thing is absolutely marvellous and would
 
make such an important contribution.  By the way,  I
 
temporarily titled your piece "I Recall  
 
Growing up in
 
Tobago"  If you don't  like that,  please  let me know what  you
 
would prefer.
 
I also took some remarks  I had written explaining some
 
special musical  features and added them to exerpts  from some
 
of your writings on textual and pedagogical  issues and put
 
them together into a section titled "Observations on the Song
 
Game" by J.D.  Elder and Bess Lomax Hawes.  If you don't  like
 
this arrangement,  please don't hesitate to say so.  I just
 
felt that with your biographical  section and Alan's general
 
introduction,  it would be perhaps better to corral your and
 
my instructions  for parents and teachers  into a single
 
section.
 
And I hope you will  read through the song games themselves,
 
with their notes,  which I did,  also the little geographic
 
sketches  I wrote at the beginning of each chapter.  Together
 
with maps,  (the publishers will get new ones drawn,  these are
 
just xeroxed from a guide book)  and some of Alan's
 
photographs of island children dancing,  it all makes for a
 
lively book  I think.  I' m really pleased with the way it has
 
come out and hope you like  it too.  And over and over again,
 
please telephone or write and let me know if you find any
  
problems anywhere. It's your book,  after all and you must be
 
happy with it.
 
Anna,  by the way,  thinks that  I should become a third author.
 
On the other hand,  I would be perfectly happy with a title as
 
Editor or something like that.  I wish you would think it
 
over;  I really don't quite know how I feel.  My sense is that
 
without you two gentlemen there would be no book and my role
 
was more  secretarial,  but -
-
-
 well,  I feel one way Monday,
 
Wednesday and Friday and the other way Tuesday,  Thursday and
 
Saturday and Sunday I just don't know,  so do let me know what
 
you think.  Anyway,  isn't  it great to think of this  lovely
 
book finally coming out!  I am just thrilled.
 
Yours ever,
 
P.S.
 Alan is doing better these days and has gone to Anna's
 
house in Tarpon Springs.  You can reach him there at 301 North
 
Spring Boulevard,  Tarpon Springs,  Florida 34689.  Telephone:
 
813/942-4039,  He's still pretty stroked out and can't speak
 
too well,  but he doesn't have to be in a hospital at this
 
point,  and that's a big step forward.

I recall a very interesting rhyme from my school days.
 It
 
was a boy's song game, but with hardly a tune.  One boy acted
 
•  the role of '
cousin'--a term that had nothing to do with blood
 
relations, but was used to address anyone in the village to
 
whom respect was due.
 In the game the players would stand be-
fore the  '
cousin' and put demands,  and he would shout back the
 
answers.  And did we boys shout those demands in the school
 
yard there at Bethel Church Hill!
 
Cousin,  lend me your pickney
 (pickaninrw) 
What you want with me pickney?
 
Pickney to work for money.
 
What you do with the money?
 
Money for buy some lala.
 (food)
 
What you with the lala?
 
Lala for put in me belly.
 
What you do with the belly?
 
Make one pickney.
 
•
 (
3 i
b
 
What you do with the pickney?
 
Pickney to work for money.
 
And -.
then we would begin all over again...
 
I remember my old aunty,  Putsy Can s, coming down to my
 
mother's house in Charlotte 'ille and saying,  "Eva give me one
 
pickney," and one of us little shavers would have to go off with
 
her and live in a little old dark house that her sea-captain
 
husband had left her.  Auntie needed a pickney to pick up,  to
 
run to the market,  to find eggs,  to do a thousand things which
 
she had no more children to help her to do.  Hers were grown
 
up and gone.  Most of all she needed company,  somebody young
 
and lively,  to instruct and feed and pet.
 So maam would give
 
her one pickney; she had a house full of them.  One of us would
 
go up with this aunt,  a member of our extended Moore family,
 
that stretched through fifteen households and made up a good
 
fraction of the population of our village.  Thinking of it in
 
this way I can understand why we little boys shouted our ironic
 
rhyme at the top of our voices,  and our leader would shout back
 
the facts of life at us.
 
Come and give me one pickney.
 
What you do with a pickney?
 
We knew what those adults would do.  They would work that
 
pickney.  That pickney would be doing the tasks that he could
 
manage,  so as, to leave the older hands free to do more money
 
.'3
'
 
-making jobs,  and they might keep him indefinitely.  A relative
 
might come to you and say, "My wife is going to have a baby.
 I
 
want to borrow one of your children to help her." --So first
 
baby,  second baby, third baby,  fourth baby--sometimes the child
 
would never go back home.  You're ashamed to go to your blood
 
relation and say,  "Give me back my child."  My uncle borrowed
 
a girl called Dorothy from his aunt, his mother's sister,  and
 
she remained with him ano helped bring up all his ten children
 
and finally married from that house.
 
A family might be too poor to mind all the children they
 
had.
 So a person who needed  help and couldn't employ a ser-
vant would borrow a child to help him,  so he could get money
 
'
to buy lala to put in belly to buy one pickney.'
 That's what
 
you get your pickney for--to help you.  You know the proverb:
 
'
Donkey bring pickney to ease back.' That's what my mother used
 
to say.
 
In the enterprises of getting and spending, children worked
 
side by side with the adults,  so it was in Charlotte$ville,
 
where I was born.  A kind of junior partnership existed between
 
the older people and the children.  Rather than emphasizing the
 
difference between the young and the old, this black ethic ar-
ranges for both to be involved in the work.  You began very
 
very early.  As soon as you could carry a little thing in your
 
hand,  it was "Bring it for mama, bring it for mama."  As a duti-
ful child, who knew where everything was in the home, you would
 
run to obey.
 I can't imagine a child not doing that.  Man,  you
 
love your mother too much.
 -
 
I remember the smell of my mother's body; it was such a
 
sweet smell to me.
 I didn't know it was not a perfume.
 I
 
didn't know it was a body smell, my mother's natural smell.
 If
 
my mother was coming home,  I would know because I
. would smell
 
her smell.  My father had another kind of smell and,  if me or my
 
twin brother were sent to find his pajamas, we could find them
 
in the dark closet among the other clothes by his special smell,
 
and to us little animals,  it was a comforting kind of smell.
 
Maybe this is the way of peasant children all over the world,
 
relating to parents and their work for our welfare so intimately
 
that we could detect our parents in the dark by distinguishing
 
their smells in a crowd of other parents,  for it was associated
 
with the deep love we had for them and the closeness there was
 
between us.
 I'd like to smell that smell again.
 
Even when children were transferred from their own family
 
to another,  this closeness,  respect,  and love was usually trans-
ferred to the new parents.  The pickneys who were borrowed would
 
carry out all the duties expected of them in their own homes.
 
The jobs for the little girls and boys differed in many ways.
 
The little boys would go with their father to the garden and
 
pick grass and weeds from round the corn and pea plants.  In
 
French this is called '
rond
--it's a task that a grown man
 
f.nds it hard to do, to double himself up and get right down
 
there and pick the grass so that the plant stands alone in a
 
circle of pure soil.
 So the little boys do that job, while
 
their fathers are digging or hoeing or chopping wood--clearing
 
the land for '
planting crops.
 
If his father was a fisherman,  the little boy would go down
 
and collect his father's fish,  and take him his hot drink of
 
cocoa or coffee when the boat came in.
 Each fisherman in a boat
 
selects a mark--cut eye,  shave-head, one tail--that he uses to
 
mark every fish he catches.  All the fish go together in the
 
gunnel of the boat,  so when the little boy comes with his basket,
 
he'll ask his father,  "Daddy, what is your mark?" and he'll tell
 
him,  "Boy,  shave-head."  So while the father be busy washing the
 
boat and fixing the gear, the boy will pick out all the fish
 
with the skin shaved off their heads,  and when they get home and
 
gut the fish, he has to go outside and dig a hole and bury the
 
entrails.
 If the boy didn't do these little chores, the father
 
would have to.
 The father does the big,  strenuous things,  and
 
the little boy is supposed to do all the little jobs.
 
If the family minds goats or sheep or pigs or rabbits,  the
 
little boy, before he goes to school has to go and pick hog
 
meat or rabbit meat or goat meat--that means greenstuf
 f--to
 
last the animals all day.  The whole family rises early,  at
 
five in the morning,  for a meal must be prepared for the man to
 
gç to work at seven.  He must have his 'wash-mouth,' a so-called
 
token meal.
 If the man is a heavy eater, he might eat. five
 
johnnycakes  and a mug of chocolate for his wash-mouth.
 But
 
that's not his breakfast.  He carries his breakfast of johnny-
cake and some kind of meat or fish and cocoa with him.
 So that
 
p .. . , .
 
woman has to be up early,  frying fish and bakes like hell, and
 
if there are little girls,  they have got to be doing chores along
 
with mother, parceling out the food for their father, demonstrat-
ing that they are interested in the breadwinner of the family.
 
No child could lie in bed and not show any interest in what the
 
mother is doing; they'd drive him out ard give him a good licking.
 
As soon as the father leaves that home, the little boy's in
 
charge,  sort of.
 "Your father's gone to work, you're the man
 
here now.  Come on feed the goats; get the hogmeat--"  It's a
 
happy thing for the little boy to stand in his father's shoes.
 
By eight o'clock he has done his chores,  eaten his breakfast and
 
has left for school.  And this regime applies to the girls as
 
well.  When they come home in the evening, the mother will have
 
the girl beside her in the kitchen, preparing dinner, while the
 
boys go bring the animals in from the fields and tether them
 
for the night.  Like other workers, we children tried to get
 
out of our chores at times, but this was hard because our elders
 
were severe taskmasters with hard hands and long switches and
 
calabash whips. . Day for us Vas work--morning and evening--and
 
in the middle of it,  school.  On Saturdays you put on your old
 
pants and you scrub your mother's floor and pick up firewood.
 
We were boys, but we had to wash clothes, we had to knead bread,
 
we had to grate coconut, we had to pound chocolate on Saturdays
 
because Sunda
'y was the big day.  There was no time to play,
 
except on holidays.  The games like the ones in this book were
 
played on moonlit nights
,.  Full moon.
 
If you belonged to a large family, you'd play in your own
 
back yard and you'd sing so loud and so sweet that the neighbor-
hood children would be attracted and they would join you,  if
 
your parents approved.  You might go to your neighbor and say,
 
"C o us i n,  I come to beg you to allow so-and-so to come and play
 
with us."  And then that person would use the occasion to come
 
visit their neighbor and bring all the children.  You see,
 
parents don't want their children to be out playing
 and they're
 
.
not there.
 Small as that village was,  it was criss-crossed with
 
caste-like groupings.  At the periphery there were the Grenadians
 
(from the nearby island),  against whom you were warned,  "Don't
 
marry to them, don't have nothing to do with them."
 
Inside the village there were the big families--Nicholsons,
 
Moores, Carringtons, Murrays.  The Murrays and the Moores were
 
forever feuding.  The Carringtons and the Nicholsons were forever
 
feuding.
 One of the families were supposed to be wizards and
 
you weren't supposed to play' with them, because they'd put thihgs
 
in your food and cast spells on the boys and make them marry
 
against their will.
 So thpre were proscriptions about which
 
child you could play with or who you could make a liaison or a
 
friendship with,  and the parents were supervising to see that
 
this wasn't done and that wasn't done.  In fact,  they didn't allow
 
/
 
demo nstrate
 
their children,  especially their girl children, to go out alone.
 
My mother used to say,  "I don't want my child to go anywhere
 
without me."
 
So on those moonlight nights, when the games were played,
 
the parents would sit down there and watch and,  if the game is
 
not going according to the way they think it should go,  they'd

I have seen my Aunt Annie come to
 
out on moonlight nights and teach us their games.-
 
B
u t in
 
most 
cases the children had an adult audience.
 
I think they used the games to check on whether their boys
 
were men and whether their girls were women.
 They didn't have
 
the word "sissy," but they called a boy Ima commairel  if he
 
didn't show his motion.
 That mother would fly in your face so
 
much if you made a remark like that about her boy.
 They were
 
very sensitive in Charlotteb-�ille if their boy was called a
 
w9manish man or their girl a tomboy,  and they went to those
 
dances to see whether their children were living up to their
 
ro les.
 if a little seven,  eight or nine year old boy would
 
/
 
him two slaps,  left and right,  if he didn't do what he was sup-
posed to when they sang--Hug and kiss your partner.
 
You got it both ways.  My little cousin, Vic,  she would kiss
 
and show her motion and things like that and her mother would
 
say,  "
It's the Nicholson blood.
 See how her mouth black."  The
 
Nicholsoris were supposed to be an oversexed old Scottish tribe,
 
never had less than fifteen children.  My auntie was married to
 
a Nicholson,  and she despised the Nicholson blood in her own
 
child, when she see her doing her motion-winding.
 
Winding is like the belly dance, but not re ally that.
 It's
 
winding your bottom.  When they sang--Show me your motion--in
 
the game,  then that child is supposed to wind his little bottom.
 
If he didn't show his motion, his mother would call,  "Come on,
 
boy," and if he still didn't do it,  she would come and hit him
 
two slaps.  But don't do that in public, outside that game.  If
 
someone says,  "Mrs. Elder, I met your little boy down there wind-
ing his bottom," his mother would give him a beating.
 So that
 
little child is very much aware of taboos and social approval.
 
In the song game, when it corhes to "Show me your motion," you do
 
i.
 If you do it outside of that setting--punishment.  Any big
 
person seeing you winding in the street, when there is. no game,
 
will hold you and give you one licking.
 
In the old Creole community any older person can reproach or
 
beat youngsters for doing something wrong.
 
"You're Charles Elder's son?"
 
"Yessir."
 
"What you doing?"
 
And you stand up like a marble stone, because the moment he
 
calls your name he's in loco parentis. You would prefer that
 
he gave you a shipping and kept it a secret from your own
 
parents.  To behave badly in the presence of people outside your
 
own family was a shameful thing, deserving severe punishment from
 
your parents,  given in the presence of the adult offended.
 In
 
this way juvenile delinquency never developed as a problem in
 
our village.  Many an adult person who saw a child misbehaving
 
p .. . , .
 
on the street would mercifully refrain from complaining to that
 
child's parent, knowing the severe punishment that they would
 
inflict.
 
Bedtime came about ten or ten thirty, but not before stories
 
were told about the Congo people,  about slaver  about escapades
 
by Negroes.
 In teaching us children about good conduct and
 
about how to live life, my father told us animal tales,  like
 
'Trouble make the monkey eat red pepper.'  my father said it had
 
t9 do with the monkey being too inquisitive.
 
Monkey saw a man eating something and asked what it was.
 
The man said it was 'trouble.' So he went to the nearest farm-
house and said he wanted some trouble,  and they put some hound
 
puppies in a bag and gave that to him.  Now the monkey didn't
 
want to share his trouble with anybody.
 So he took: it  way out
 
(
 
I
 
in the desert to open it  up.  Out jumped three angry hound
 
dogs.
 They tore that monkey's hide and he ran off with the hounds
 
close behind till he came to the only tree in sight.
 It was a
 
qru-qru tree,  all spines from the ground up,  and by the time the
 
monkey got to the top, his whole body was full of spines.  The
 
hound puppies kept him up that tree for three days, before hunger
 
drove them home.  Then the monkey came down, hungry to death and
 
the first thing he saw was a pepper tree full of peppers.  The
 
pepper burned his mouth, but he didn't care.  He was hungry and
 
ate all the pepper.  That was better than being, eaten by hounds
 
or starving to death in the qru-qru tree.
 
So in Creole society, when you really in trouble, which you've
 
brought on yourself,  and you have to do something distasteful,
 
they say,  'Trouble make a monkey eat pepper,' and nobody sympa-
thizes with you.
 It's a kind of heartless thing.
 
My father used animal stories like that to teach us children
 
how to live life,  and he had a favorite song that he used to hum,
 
when we brought trouble on ourselves.  When we hear him singing
 
that, we know he is laughing at us.
 
Your daddy say 'No  go there, boy,'
 
Pay mango,
 
You take your hard ears,  go there, boy,
 
Pay mango,
 
You'll take your bare hand to cut timber,
 
Pay mango,
 
Pay, boy, pay mango...
 
To take one's bare hands and cut timber is the punit
hment
 
for boys who disobey their fathers--the children with '
hard ears.'
 
When we hear him singing 'Pay Mango,' we know he's laughing at
 
us and our troubles and wouldn't come to help us,  unless we were
 
about to be killed.  We got the moral,  all right.
 
Actually my father was a soft-minded man,  though firm in
 
dealing with us  children.
 He flogged me only once,  at my
 
mother's instigation.
 Very early he took me into a kind of
 
partnership with him.  He would take me into the woods to shoot
 
and hunt and do the things a man should know.  Very early he
 
bought me a book --What a Young Boy Ought to Know. 
Every day
 
he would go through that book with me,  tell me everything,  topic
 
by topic, verse by verse.  Must of been about twelve at that
 
time, but, God, I don't think I had to read any book to know about
 
sex.
 We had seen goats having sex and sheep having sex.
 
Very, very early we realized that sex was something to be
 
hiding about.  My mother's sisters had all girls and these girls
 
lived in a part of the village called Bottom Gulley.  The women
 
in Bottom Gulley used to wash clothes naked as they born and act
 
o t all kinda things; so my mother would tell us that Aunt Annie's
 
girl children were 'very vile.'  But in Black society two sisters'
 
children are close,  far more close than a brother and a sister's
 
children.
 So these little girls would come over.
 
In those days a girl,  even up to age twelve, wore no panties
 
like modern day girls.  All they had was a shift,  a long thing
 
with a hole bust in the top and two holes in the side.  And they're
 
running wild.  And I could remember those little cousins of mine
 
s-they were real wild.  Wild is the word.  They would run away
 
to our house, which had a coppice alongside it--a kind of low
 
bush that grows up after you chop down virgin forest.  Children
 
twelve years old could easily hide inside this bush and give you
 
real hell to find.
 So these little girls would induce us--three
 
of us, my twin brother, myself,  and a little one just tagging
 
after--these little girls would induce us into this bush to play
 
hide and seek,  and, boy,  there was birds and bees inside there
 
I suppose my mother suspected,  and I would hear her telling
 
her sister,  "Annie, don't make those little devils of yours come
 
over here and teach my boys to sin."  And Annie would laugh and
 
say,  "Well, how you know?"  She say,  "I smell them."
 
Now,  as I sit here,  I can remember the characteristic smell of
 
these little girls--fresh,  natural,  animal smell.
 It was glory,
 
it was heaven for us to sex up those little girls.  We knew
 
nothing.  We had seen the animals, but a human encounter is the
 
greatest feeling in the world.
 Those little girls, they taught us.
 
For the grown-ups it was a matter to be laughed at; they did
 
nothing to scold us or restrain us from the playful love affairs
 
of our childhood days.  Years after we were all grown up and had
 
scattered away from that village,  and most of us married, we would'
 
recall those childhood sexual experiments.  Those girls would ask
 
us--"What was wrong with that?"  Of course,  nothing was really
 
wrong;  it was all part of our life experience, part of a very
 
useful education in living a life that was not guilt-ridden.
 In
 
time a copy of The Home Physician appeared in our house,  and all
 
we wanted to know about sex and human reproduction was there for
 
us to read.
 
In one sense,  however, our villagers were hung up on extra-
and pre-marital sex; they would bring pressure on an individual
 
who made a woman pregnant and did not want to marry her.
 In
 
"Mis  Marie," a game in this book,  the singers pay to the boy in
 
the ring,  "Marry the gal one time."  On the other hand,  sexual
 
fecundity in man and woman was a virtue to be admired.
 A man
 
who did not get himself a woman by the time he was twenty was
 
suspect and could become a langhirig-stock in the village; he
 
would be called a mafrodice 
(
effeminate),  laughed at by the
 
women and scoffed at by the males.
 
It was one's mother who discovered a boy's approach to
 
puberty and reported it to her husband.  The relationship between
 
a young man and his mother bdgir
is to center around the boy's
 
f male associates,  and a mother will go as far as advising her
 
son about his choices.  He is now a valued breadwinner,  and it is
 
his mother who is most eager to exploit this source of income.
 
Mothers attempt to delay the marriage of their sons as long as
 
possible,  and in the old days they had a song in which they laid
 
claim to their sons' time and money and demanded that they post-
pone marrying and leaving the house.
 
Tell dem say you no married yet,
 
You no courtin' yet
 
You no leave home yet,
 
You must go back to home
 
To go mind you Mama...
 
Mothers claim the right to select the girl their sons should
 
court and to arrange the marriage.  They,  and not the fathers,
 
decide which of the females in the village would be suitable as
 
a wife to enter the family.  Again it is the women of the village
 
who officially oversee that the girls grow up in strict morality,
 
until they are married.  Any pre-marital union or clandestine
 
love affair--any acting the woman in the home--are noted in a
 
girl and count against her when a man considers her for a spouse.
 
In most of these old Creole families girls were very strictly
 
supervised by their mothers.
 
I used to see women come to my mother and say,
 "Eva, me get
 
one girl,  she arms smell like aloes."
 
And my mother would say,  "A big woman like you, you don't
 
know how to bring up girl children?  Bring the girl for mei"
 
My mother is baking broad and she takes out a hot loaf of bread,
 
it in two, blow on it, put it under that girl's arm, hold
 
her arms out like that,  and the odor is gone.  Cut forever.
 
That was my mother's cure for arm-hole odor.
 
My mother used to make bride clothes, and so our house was
 
always filled with young women,  coming and getting measured up
 
to be married,  and it's a rule in our village,  the bride must
 
dress in the house where the dress was made; no material must be
 
left for anybody to get a piece of it.
 If somebody collect those
 
pieces and do something with them,  it put a spell on the marriage;
 
the marriage wouldn't go well.  After that bride leaves, my
 
mother had to get us little boys to put all those pieces together.
 
I don't know what my mother used to do with them.
 
So I was a little boy--I must have been about eight-'-and
 
there's a girl who live near to us and she was getting married to
 
one of our cousins, netting married to a Moore.  My mother, being
 
a Moore,  is making this girl's dress.  And I remember they brought
 
the girl home.  Viola was her name,  and she was big and fat and she
 
was pretty, but I remember her feet were too big.  Anyway, I saw
 
my mother with white cucumber talcum soap--my mother and another
 
woman in our bedroom--and they were saying to this girl,  "Wash
 
this thing properly,  girl.  *ash this thing properly.  This man
 
r
r
nist get it sweet and smelling good tonight."
 
They were saying how this girl must give a good body to this
 
man she was going to be married to.  Like my sisters were tombbys,
 
climbing any old tree to pick any fruit.  My mother would drag
 
them down and beat the life outa them and say,  "What you gonna
 
give the man,  if you tear it up,  if you  spoil it?"  This is all
 
over Tobago.
 call it a superstition.
 
"Careful, careful,  don't jump over that bridge,  don't jump
 
over that ditch,  
-
don't.
. .
"  This is how my mother condemned my
 
A
Bulnatc kA nnie's daughters.
 Their father was a fishing boat man
 
socie
t
and they usedy to go out with him and fish,  and my mother used
 
to say,  "My God, how Annie could allow these girl  children to
 
do that?"
 My mother was squeamish about girl children.  You
 
got to walk straight,  sit straight,  all kinds of things like that.
 
So parallel to the involvement of children in adult work in

for a l
brown boy in the ring'  and,  of course,  the boys play
 
the chasing games,  the kissing and show me your motion games.
 
Roman Soldie
,  in my community, was strictly for the boys, who
 
often took 'Are you ready for a fight' quite literally.
 In ex-
ceptional cases a group of boys may agree to play a girls' game
 
and vice versa.  A boy who is game-hungry or is left out of boy's
 
roughhouse sports may float over and join a girl's game.  For
 
instance,  in a family, composed of both boys and girls, roles
 
might be switched, according to the needs of the game,  and a
 
little boy is then safe in playing Jane and Louisa with his
 
sisters.
 
All this points  up the importance of the song-games in the
 
socialization process in Caribbean society.
 In my day, mothers
 
and fathers were present at game sessions and directly instructed
 
the young in how the games ought to be played.  This gives the
 
older folk the opportunity to influence the children's choices
 
of play partners and reinforce  household pacts and to emphasize
 
cultural values and behavioral norms.
 In the evenings fathers
 
made toys for their children and on holidays accompanied them to
 
the playgrounds and watched Over them as they played the tradi
 
t onal games.
 
)
J, I  r j &A,�
 
There were four traditional holidays,  later sanctioned by
 
government decree--Easter Monday, August 1st, Christmas Day,
 
and New Year's Day.  On these days parents were at home and
 
dressed up their children and took them to the savannah to play.
 
The savannah was an open field in the village.  On it the men
 
played cricket.  On other occasions the womens'  institute or
 
the church mission organized competitions and games for the
 
children,  and in this way many British games were introduced into
 
the village by the Methodist minister, who had been trained in
 
youth work.
 But on holidays the savannah was the stage on which
 
fathers acted out their status as the proud possessors of family,
 
wife and children.
 
Traditionally, on Christmas and the other holidays, each
 
family,  no matter how poor it  is,  sees to it that each child
 
gets new clothes and shoes and spending money so that the child-
ren can share,  equally with the adults,  the pleasures that the
 
holiday seasons bring.
 The comm unity spends a considerable part
 
of its earnings on fte .  Children and the young claim an equal
 
p rt with the adults in conspicuous spending on new clothes and
 
on the food that is shared with friends and neighbors.
 In sum,
 
the Creole family can be said to operate on an economy that is'
 
child oriented.
 
In Trinidad and Tobago, rich and poor engage in Esusu--a
 
lay-away savings system by which members of a savings ring con-
tribute money to a pool and then draw their hand in time for
 
Carnival when they need a lump sum to buy new clothes and cos-
tumes for themselves and their children.
 These holiday customs,
 
organizing work and play into a rhythmic cycle, have helped to
 
establish a positive work ethic in the Caribbean.
 They have
 
rubbed away some of the scars,  left by the plantation system,
 
in which work and play were mandated.
 The people work hard and
 
then they play nard.
 The children understand early the place in
 
life of organized work and play--the work group and the play
 
group,  through which the balance between earning a living and
 
recreation is achieved.
 
Easter
  
My father was a great man.
 Nothing he couldn't do.
 He
 
could play anything.
 He could pitch top.
 He could pitch marble.
 
He could blow the flute.
 On Good Friday he had to go to church
 
for three hours of service.
 He had to go in a white suit, white
 
boots and sing in the choir.  When he comes home he'll take up
 
his glasses,  see what he get
 On Good Friday you break a white
 
of an egg and put it in water and put it '
under the sun and then
 
you go to church and when you come back you see what you get
 
--divination.
 The egg would take on different shapes.
 In the
 
water and the sun it takes the shape of a church or it takes the
 
shape of a coffin or a tree or a penny.
 It's plain for anybody
 
to see.
 You don't call somebody else to ask him what you get,
 
you tell him what you get.
 If you get a church,  you call every-
body to see you get a church, you're going to get married.  You
 
see a coffin.
 Then you say,  "Oh, God,  somebody gon' to dead
 
in the family."
 This is big people business.  You little child,
 
you're crazy to do it, but--.
 
"What are you up to?  You playing big woman?"
 
It's for young girls,  teenagers, who have love affairs and
 
things like that.
 Most old married people don't bother, but
 
young girls,  they want to see their future.
 Anyway you come
 
back from church and everybody look at their's and you're eating.
 
Olive oil and salt cod fish and yams is all you are supposed to
 
eat on Good Friday.
 Not supposed to shed no blood--no killing
 
of no chicken,  no beef,  no pork.
 Wine.
 That's the one time we
 
children would get wine from our parents.
 And it is sweet wine,
 
red wine,  sweet,  sweet--no alcohol in it.
 
Each holiday we race boats.  Our Charlotte <
"ille harbor,
 
called Man-of-War Bay,  is exceptionally deep.
 As you face the
 
ocean,  the deepest part is oh your left, called Bottom Bay,  and
 
op the right is Corner Rock.
 In the race you're rowing from
 
Bottom Bay to Corner Rock.
 The best oarsmen were the men who
 
worked on the seine boats, the boats used to carry the nets to'
 
surround the shoals of fish that swarmed the harbor.  Any boat could
 
enter the race.
 There was no regulation about boat size or number
 
of rowers.
 So a little boat, Little Willie, with only four
 
men in it is racing a big boat with eight men in it.  They pay
 
the same dollar to enter the race and they both aim to reach
 
the winner's pole first.
 
So you would be dressed up to see the boat race or the horse
 
race on the beach,  and,  if you're little enough, you get a pig
 
-a-back on your father.
 If those horses bolt and run through
 
the crowd,  it could kill you.  You might get lost in that big
 
crowd,  at least it looked big to a little child.
 So your parent
 
all the time watching you,  and when you finish you go and watch
 
marble pitching.
 
Good Friday is really marble day.  You see them hang a
 
purse round the waist.  You hear them marbles shaking--'chuck
 
-chuck-chuck.'  You have different kinds of marble.  You have
 
chow and you have aggie, you have common.  Common is a beauti-
ful little marble, but the value is only one.  Then you have
 
twosy and fives--the value of that is not five penny but five
 
commons.  You
, have crystals, clear like a green bottle and
 
beautiful.
 Then you have yot!r taw,  the master marble.
 If you
 
have to sell out your marbles, you never sell your taw.
 Some
 
fellows use a solid steel sphere for their taw because it's
 
heavy.
 Some fellows use a big fives.  When you pitch your taw
 
and hit another man's taw,  then every marble in the ring belong
 
to you.  You '
put them in your pocket and you pass.
 
- 
All that knowledge about marbles comes to you from your
 
father.
 He buys you your first set.  Remember that first little
 
bag of pretty marbles you had?  Before you go to bed, you feel
 
around and if you don 't have them, you can't sleep?  Here's
 
three boys in the family--my two brothers and me--we thief each
 
other's marbles.  When you sleeping, they thief your marble,
 
because each fellow is building up his own bank.  My last bro-
ther was the greatest marble pitcher in the world.  The man
 
wasn't losing.  Nothing.
 He have a gunny sack full of marbles
 
and he hiding them in the ground and he would forget where he
 
hide them and he was crazy for weeks,  looking, digging.
 I
 
think marbles is worse than alcoholism.
 It's an addiction.
 
My mother had to beat it out of him.
 
Anyway,  in our village, your father will take  you out to
 
protect you on Easter,  the big marble pitching day.
 Big man
 
pitching.  We little boy watch, can't go near them.
 So much
 
marble in the ring and the ring so big, we little boys just
 
eyed it.  On Good Friday they had six rings like that with a
 
captain appointed to regulate the marble pitching.  Fights might
 
bçeak out.
 Police might even come.
 
Fathers stood sentry over their boys as they played marbles
 
to make sure they were not robbed by the bigger ones.
 I remember
 
how secure I felt when my father was with me and I won some
 
bigger boy's marbles.  Ordinarily they would simply have taken
 
the marbles from me by force, but with my father there, they
 
dared not cheat or refuse to pay their wagers.
 
In marble pitching there is a rule that no winner can with-
draw from the game until he has won the last marble his opponent
 
has.
 Pretty often that is the turning point.
 I'm down to my
 
taw and I put it in the ring,  and you put down five commons
 
there against my taw.  And I say,  "Lend me a taw."
 
You're under obligation to lend me a taw.
 Pretty often I
 
might start from that and win back every marble.
 The fellow's
 
afraid of that and so he say,  "
I'm going home.  -My mother calling
 
me.
 
"After you win me, you're walkin' out?  No, man."  And me
 
and my brother would grab him.  My brother always had his little
 
twig--like a police baton with twine around it and a nice little
 
leather handle and he was a good fighter.
 
And the fellow that wanted to win and walk out would say,
 
"But you have only one marble."
 
That's when the captain or the father would say,  "As long as
 
you got one marble, you gotta play him."
 
So we would play him and win.
 If he doesn't play, we would
 
fight,  and if he has supporters, the fight would get big.
 Those
 
days we didn't have a police station.  You settled your own
 
problems.
 The big people would come and say,  "What you fightin'
 
for?"
 
Or your mother may come and say,  "What you raisin' your voice
 
and fightir
i'  for?  Shame your family !"  Pulling you away.
 
On Easter Day, when the sea was low,  the tide receded leav-
ing a clean,  hard beach of sand from Corner Rock to Bottom Bay,' 
more than a mile long.
 On. this the horse races were run and on
 
early Easter Day the horse owners came into the village--Darcy
 
Orr and Joshua - Sandy, men from Low Lands and from Castana, bring-
/
 ing their race horses.
 In our own village Stephen Carrington
 
and Wormseed Nicholson kept race horses.
 
On Easter Mondays, when the tide became very low,  large
 
turtles would run
 
o
J
 
mostly the leatherback turtles,
 
sometimes a couple of porpoises.
 Villagers would turn the
 
turtles on their backs and slaughter them.
 There would be
 
turtle meat in every pot on that day.
 Sometimes one man and
 
how own relatives would capture the turtle unaided.  He would
 
sell the meat cheaply, but the catch was his and he would cut
 
away the best part of the meat for his own family.  As men
 
carved up the turtle,  they would sing the turtle song.
 
Easter Monday,  glorious day
 
Leatherback turtle come a'bay
 
Uncle Reggie bring you' rope
 
Auntie Missis bring you' gourd cal'bash
 
Chorus:
 
You damn wrong to interfere,
 
You damn wrong to interfere,
 
In me business.
 
Only your wife get the heart and liver of that turtle.
 If
 
you give it away to another woman, you're a very bad man.
 So
 
Reggie Murray, who turns the turtle, will call for his wife,
 
Mrs. Murray,  and she will come down and load these things into
 
her special calabash.
 I don't know why the Murrays, who were
 
very religious people, were put into this very unreligiOus song,
 
but we kids liked it.
 
Easter Monday was also kite-flying day.
 Every family made
 
its own kites.  A man who had no time to make his children's
 
kites would employ alci.te-maker to come to his home and make
 
kites for a wage.
 But my father was a great kite-maker and on
 
the evening before Easter Monday he would sit home the whole
 
night making kites, my mother grumbling,  "Charles,  come nail
 
back this door for me"--things like that.
 
And he would say,  "
 Leave me with my boys."  And we round
 
him like a great god, while's he's making kites for us.
 
You use cocoye_feX
the mid-ribs of the coconut palm fronds
 
for the kite ribs.  You buy No. 8 Clark thread,  strong enough to
 
fish with,  for the kite strirg.  And you boil starch, cassava
 
starch,  for paste,  and put aloes in it because,  if you don't,
 
when you wake up Easter morning, these roaches eat up your kite
 
--eat up the starch, that is,  and you're in tears because you
 
miss the competition.
 
So we're '
cutting paper in triangles,  using my mother's
 
seamstress scissors, cutting quiet, quiet, because if my mother
 
come to know,  she take away her scissors.  We make the frame out
 
of the cocoye-fex, run string around to form a hexagon or an
 
octagon.
 Paste paper on kite frame,  and make a jib boom right
 
on top there, with two flaps made of contrasting colored paper.
 
The compass is put on and the string attached to the center,  and
 
then the kite-maker adds a "singer"--a paper fringe on a small
 
cross-string attached inside a curved funnel.  When the singer
 
flutters in the wind,  it makes a steady booming sound.
 In
 
Charlottesville a kite that did not sing was regarded as defective.
 
The final touch is the "zwill."  Kite flying was competitive.
 
So at the tail of the kite you hang a razor sharp piece of glass,
 
the zwill.  Any kite attempting to outfly your kite will be
 
"given the zwill"--you jerk your string and the tail will swing
 
and the zqill will cut the string of the rival in mid-air.  To
 
see a kite falling in.
-distress a mile away from you up in the
 
air is great fun.
 To be master of the sky full of kites is the
 
aspiration of every little boy in the village.
 
After the kite-flying ana the horse-racing,  there were other
 
v.1lage sports.  Tug-of-war was for the grown-ups, both males
 
and females.
 Greasy-pole was for anyone who was a good tree
 
climber.
 Tree-climbing is a common form of work for Charlotte; ' 
ville people--coconut trees,  timber trees,  cocoa trees,  and the
 
masts of sailing boats have to be climbed.  On Easter Monday
 
a huge pole some thirty feet in height and about eight inches
 
in diameter was planted deep in the earth.  At the top of it
 
was the prize--a hamper containing ham, money, rum,  and candies.
 
The surface of the pole was larded with cart grease until it was
 
slippery.  Contestants were expected to climb this pole and dis-
lodge the hamper.  Whoever did kept it as his prize.
 
On holidays my father's music band would come to our house
 
and rehearse.  My father had a string band,  the only one in the
 
village,  a string band with piccolo and flute.  My father played
 
the flute--a big,  long one--and these other men--Braveman and
 
Lattie and Quinton and Peace, mainly from one family, the Jacks,
 
who played on strings and wind instruments--would come,  and
 
while  they rehearsing, my mother would be cooking,  good food.
 
My father would serve plenty of wine,  red port wine,  falernum, 
at lunch.
 During the drawing of  the cork,  the musicians would
 
play a favorite reel,  "Bush Behind the Basket," and my father
 
would give us children a little taste of the falernum and my
 
mother would say,  "Tell this man .
--he's your cousin.
 It's
 
your family, your blood."
 
Then they would sit down and eat.  My mother would give us
 
food at another table,  and those men would fill the house with
 
music and then they would go off serenading from house to house,
 
visiting the important people who had invited them--the overseer,
 
the Portuguese merchant,  a wealthy farmer--and then they would
 
play for a dance.
 We'd be dead asleep when they came back.
 
Father would be laughing,  because he was high,  and when my
 
mother saw him in that mood,'ihe'd be happy about that.
 But
 
sometimes there were fights in the dancehall.
 For a churchman,
 
it was no good for his image,  so after a time my father gave
 
up making dancehall  music and concentrated on church music.
 
To avoid the temptation of backsliding, he gave away his beau-
tiful rosewood flute.
 
Auqu t Day
  
The first of August was Emancipation Day, officially; we
 
called it Freedom Day.
 Early in the morning on that day some
 
of the old Congo people in the village would observe a ceremony
 
in which they beat their mali-down-down---a heavy steel drum
 
container for olive oil--and sang freedom songs like this one:
 
Ta la lie le-oh
 
Freedom are come-oh
 
Ta la lie le-oh
 
King George, here you hoe-oh.
 
The people from Grenada sould sing:
 
Freedom-oh mama mwe-oh
 
Freedom ca te way fuet-na
 
Bunda mama mwe.
 
(Freedom took my mother
 
Freedom took away whip
 
From my mother's buttocks.)
 
No one in the village would work on that day no matter how
 
high the wages offered.
 Anyone who did was regarded as disloyal
 
and forgetful of slavery days.
 
August Day morning was devoted to the Sunday school anni-
versary, when the teachers, pupils,  and officers of the Sunday
 
school celebrated by holding a religious concert.
 No one wish-
clothes were made for the boys.

your neck and a big pink bow and your suit might all be in silk.
 
Mother made these suits for us.
 She made gingerbread -and walk-
ing stick candy,  twisted mint,  cooking that all night for the
 
church.
 We boys would carry it to the schoolro.om,
 because,
 
although it was a church affair,  they would hold it in the
 
schoolroom.
 The place would be dressed up,  and we little boys
 
would be running back and forward carrying vlowers and things
 
like that till one o'clock.
 The whole village came in its
 
best clothes,  all the children,  all the grandparents.
 
The main feature of these anniversary meetings were the
 
action songs and Bible plays by Cornelius Moore and his children.
 
Later this fame passed to another Moore family--Phillip Sunny
 
Moore and his family.
 The M6ores were a religious people and a
 
bright people,  and
-they would take a pass
 age out of the Bible,
 
the story of Ruth and Naomi or David and Goliath.
. or about Mr.
 
Greatheart and the other characters in Pilqrim's Proqress, and
 
write a play and learn all the parts.
 There was a lot of action
 
on stage--a rough platform of boards with a bedsheet for a
 
screen.
 Goliath sang in a big,  gruff voice,  and little David
 
piped an answer.
 They were backed by the chorus.
 
Goliath -
 Come unto me
 
David
 -
 I'll come to thee.
 
Goliath -
 Come unto me
 
David
 -
 I'll come to thee.
 
Goliath -
 Come unto me
 
And I will give my flesh
 
Unto the beasts
 
Of the field
 
And unto the
 
Fowls of the air.
 
Chorus
 -
 Come unto me....
 
Every boy wanted to star as David,  but usually a delicate,
 
tender little boy was chosen and taught the part and how to make
 
and use his sling and stone.
 Goliath was always tall,  gruff and
 
bearded.
 His voice was loud and his armour-bearer had trouble
 
lifting up his sword and the weaver's beam with which he would
 
slay David, when' David and Gdliath closed in battle.
 
Aurelia Moore was David's sister and she'd sing:
 
Little David, play on your harp,
 
Hallelu, hallelu,
 
Little David,  play on your harp,
 
Hallelu.
 
I've told you once and I've told you twice,
 
There's sinners in hell for shootin' dice....
 
And the dice men on stage playing dice and acting out every
 
god-awful thing you could think of.  Whole day was this drama.
 
And you're drinking ginger beer till your belly's full and
 
you're eating mint and cake.
 It was a great day,
 August Day.
 
Many of these plays were taken out of Pilqrim's Proqress  
--you know the one illustrated with line drawings.
 In Char-
lottesville there's three books you have in your house--Sankey
 
and Moody's Sacred Sonqs and Solos, the Bible and Pilqrim's  
Proqress. 
If a man lose his Pilqrim's Proqress, he'll announce
 
it in church from the pulpit.
 
In time,  the younger generation of more educated Moores
 
began to act in the drama of Dick Turpin,  the great British
 
highwayman,  instead of the Bible stories.
 At first the church
 
people protested.
 Were you going to approve of robbery in plays
 
for children--especially in Sunday school?  But after a time
 
secular plays like "The Sinking of the Titanic" crept in and
 
the escapades of
e
Anansi,  the trickster, were accepted.
 
The two World War I veterans from Char1otte vil1e,  Joe Dick
 
and Sam Perry, were asked to '
mount a play showing how they had
 
c ptured a German machine gun when their British captain had
 
deserted them.
 The machine gun,  now in Scarborough Courthouse,
 
was loaned to the Sunday School for this play, which was a gre at
 
success.
 Old newspaper accounts were used to give documenta-
tion to the play,  and the Sunday School folk plays became more
 
secular.
 
The children had their part in the Anniversary.
 They were
 
given poetry and prose selections which they had to recite.
 
If you bust--if you forget your piece and shame your
 
parents —who were sitting right there and listening to you,
 
brother,  you got one fair licking.
R ight
 
we give you all new clothes for you,  you come up and make me
 
shamed in public?"
 
But if you say your piece nice, your godparents and every-
body run up to you, kissing you and give you sweets and push
 
money in your pocket.
 
On August Day the Grenadians would come in from the gardens
 
in the mountains where they lived and hold a cheer-up.
 They
 
would build a big tent in somebody's yard and cook food in big
 
flat iron pots--one full of rice,  one full of pork,  one full of
 
beef,  one full of fish,  one full of vegetables.
 They'd drum
 
and play tamborines and sing:
 
See le Roi Victor comin'
 
With his one foot 
-
 -
 
freedom.
 It was a very emotional time.
 People recounted all the
 
sufferings of slavery and talked it over to their children, over
 
and over again.
 In our house we relied on the written word.
 My
 
father would read us the life of Wilberforce and make us read
 
it ourselves,  but in homes where there were no books,  they'd tell
 
stories,  rely upon tradition.
 My grandmother was a slave,  born
 
on the same day as Queen Victoria,  so out of her mouth came
 
stories about the two slaves, Dickey-Ben and Babsalta.
 
"The same stick that knocked Babsalta in the morning will
 
knock Dicky-Ben in the evening," my grandm other used to begin...
 
This is the story of a house slave and a bush slave.
 In
 
the morning Dicky-Ben,  dressed up in white clothes,  is getting
 
the master wine and thing like that.
 And they drive Babsalta
 
out of the bus +nd
 they tie him up, beat his bare backside with
 
whips and they they anoint him down with molasses,  leave him
 
there strung up,  and fly come and he can't move.
 
Dicky-Ben used to pass and trook him,  teasing him,  and
 
Babsalta hang up there three days and the third day an old man
 
saw Dicky-Ben doing that.
 He say,  "Dicky-Ben,  the same stick
 
that beat Babsalta in the morning will slay Dicky-Ben in the
 
evening."
 Dicky-Ben laugh.
 
Next day Dicky-Ben drop the master's big goblet full of
 
brandy,  and the master so mad,  he loose down Babsalta and hang
 
up Dicky-Ben in all his white clothes and the same stick that
 
he used to beat Babsalta, he let Dicky-Ben have it.
 Babsalta
 
trook him and said,  "Dicky-Ben,  you the house slave.
 But the
 
same stick that knock Babsalta in the morning knock Dicky-Ben
 
in the evening."
 
My grandmother would come home especially to tell us all
 
these slavery stories.
 Story after story after story about Congo
 
Brown.
 Congo Brown was the wizard who saw Freedom coming and
 
went from plantation to plantation telling the slaves the good
 
news in song:
 
Who been are say--Freedom no are come-oh?
 
Who been are say--Freedom no are come-oh?
 
Who been are say--Freedom no are come-oh?
 
Oh King George-oh, here you bill, here you hoe-oh!
 
Congo Brown--the slave who flew back to Africa--is the great
 
legend of Tobago.
 Erich Roche has written a long poem about
 
him.
 
Congo Brown saw  lL -f
. putting woman's belly in a hole
 
--pregnant woman.
 When they're pregnant,  they dig a hole and
 
put the belly in the hole and beat their bottom with a bill.
 (A
 
bill is a kinda cutlass ,with a hook to hook the cane.
 So when
 
Congo Brown see that,  tears come to his eyes.
 He work his magic,
 
so when they let go blows on the slave's bottom, the white
 
woman up in the great house bawl out,  "Stop the beating,  stop
 
the beating"--because every blow that they give that slave woman
 
Congo make that blow fall on the white man's wife.
 
Congo know they were,going to beat his wife one day.
 So
 
he turn his wife into the white man's big cow.
 They looking
 
for his wife all abroad.
 When they came, Congo said,  "You see
 
my wife down the road, boy?"
 
He said,  "No,  sir,  all I see is a black cow."
 
Congo hit him one kick.
 "That is my wife you are calling
 
a black cow like that.
 Go down and tell her I said to come
 
here."
 
"But Congo, I don't see your wife."
 
"Go to that same black cow, boy,  go yonder and see."
 And
 
the cow turn into Congo's wife.
 
Things are getting really bad this time,  and Congo called
 
all his people and he told them,  "Tomorrow morning we're flying
 
back to Africa."
 Say,  "Each one of you bring two corn stick
 
(corn cobs)."
 
Say,"Congo, what you're doing with this corn stick?"
 
Say,  "Mind your business,  but bring your two corn stick--
everybody bring two corn stick."
 
So when they came, he say,  "Put your corn stick under your
 
arm and hold your hand down tight like that."
 Say,  "One,  two,
 
three,  Guinea "  And those who did not eat salt, rise up in the
 
air with Guinea and they sail back to Africa.
 And those who
 
had eaten the salt of the land,  they rise up a little bit and
 
and they drop down back and they began to cry, because Congo
 
and all
- the other fellows gone.
 
Now when I was a little boy,  and my grandmother was telling
 
us about Congo Brown, we had to lock up the house in the night,
 
because this here man who could fly back to Africa, he could
 
turn people into stone,  he could take a long bamboo and chuck
 
the moon,  and we're tightened to death of this Congo Brown.
 The
 
fact is that Congo's family still live in Charlott 4'
vi11e.
 
All
 
those people name Brown are kin to him,  so that we can't dis-
believe this Congo business as just my grandmother's own thing.
 
The legend of Congo is known all over Tobago.
 As you go
 
from village to village the great things that Congo did multiply.
 
He is the hero of freedom,
 an active freedom fighter in our
 
August Day dramas.
 For these slavery plays the casts were
 
large.
 Costumes were slave clothes,  ragged and dirty.
 Bills,
 
hoes, brooms,  and tools for work in the fields would be thrown
 
away when Congo Brown announces that "Freedom are come-oh!"
 In
 
these plays children took part side by side with the adults,
 
reciting poems about slavery and Emancipation and singing old
 
slave songs.
 
Haddie Massa and Laddie Missie
 - 
When you go home say haddie for me
 
Oh you Moma, way gie-ah we free
 
Oh you Moma, way gie-ah we free
 
A song like this would be acted out.
 Massa and Missie
 
are leaving by ship for England.
 Black people,  now free,  stand
 
on the pier and send "Laddie"  (Lowdye)  for Queen Victoria
 
(Victoria the Good)  "who gie ah we (all of us)  free(dom)."
 
There were songs about the failure of plantation economy
 
and the fall of the planter class and the sad end to which so
 
many planters had come as a result of the demise of king sugar.
 
In this song the white people face poverty and real trouble.
 
Massa dead, he lefl no money
 
Missis have to work she pony*
 
Oh ho ho, bell are ring a' yard-oh
 
Yard oh yard-oh, bell are ring a' yard-oh
 
Oh yo yo, bell are ring a' yard-oh
 
This was pure folklore upon which the Charlotteosville
-svil
-le
 
dramatists were drawing to make up Sunday School Anniversary
 
plays for August Day.
 
Christmas
  
Work goes up to Christma� Eve,  villagers making preparations
 
fQr a two-day rest.
 The house gets a new look with wallpaper.
 
The whole compound is properly cleaned.
 Some people build large
 
earth ovens outside to bake Christmas "load"  (heavy bread and
 
cakes),  chicken (mostly large roosters),  and a fatted pig re-
served for Christmas.
 The best of the yam and plantain crop is
 
0
 
selected and brought home late on Christmas Eve.
 Hardly any
 
fishing is done around this time-
, people eat pork and the poor-
est folk buy a ham.
 Large stone jars of ginger beer are pre-
pared and the traditional sorrel drink is a compulsory item
 
in all homes.
 School was usually closed for the Christmas ho1i
 
days, -  and children would help clean up the house and its com-
pound.
 
Christmas Day is the big day in the Caribbean,  a time of
 
spending the money received from the cocoa crop and from work-
ing on the cocoa and coconut estates at Starwooci, Carnpbelton,
 
and Hermitage.
 Children received not only Christmas presents
 
but clothes for the New Year as well.
 
Your mother went to Scarboro about the Thursday before
 
--walking.
 Walk one day.
 Sleep,  get up early.  Walk in to
 
Scarboro,  shop.
 Buy all the nice things and put them in a big
 
canister (a trunk made out of tin).
 Put in all the toys,  the
 
clothes,  the books,  the shoes,  and so on,  and walk back.
 
So your mother coming back Christmas Eve night.  You're not
 
sleeping,  youirë sitting up and waiting for your mother.  Your
 
father had to go inside the kitchen and cook and clean the
 
house.
 He don't want to touch things wrong inside that kitchen;
 
so my father is gingerly touching, but he has got to feed the
 
children.
 But he's frightened my mother will quarrel.
 Nonethe-
less,  he had to cook something.
 
He would sit up with us,  and we would smell the smell,  all
 
the sweet smells of the city when my mother come with her per-
fume.
 As she burst through, we all grab her around her waist,
 
lift down this canister,  and she would lock us out of the bed-
room,  open up the cannister with her husband,  and we are out-
side  and we are wondering what has happened.
 She would bring
 
a dancing man.
 For the boys she would bring cocked hats, which
 
you can't touch till Christmas Day.
 And new clothes for the
 
New Year--and books,  town sweets.
 
Christmas Day you visit your grandmother.
 No work.
 You
 
had Maypole,  too.
 
band
 
Maypole/is going to win,
 
If the people don't want to sing.
 
Pa la ma la,
 
Pa la ma la,
 
Me-day-day-oh.
 
Methodist people wouldn't allow their children to dance the
 
Maypole, because the Maypole was  organized by the few Spanish
 
people in our midst, Granadi n Spanish.
 There was a chorus and
 
an orchestra of drummers,  guitar players,  and fiddlers.
 Le Roi
 
Victor would compose his own songs,  nothing like the Mayday songs
 
we were taught in school:
 
This is the month of Maying,
 
When merry lads are playing,
 
Tra la la la la...
 
7
 
What Le Roi Victor sung was about village experiences and
 
comesse (
scandals),  and there would be lots of eating and rum
 
drinking in the fashion of the old Grenadine cheerup. 
The village
 
shopkeepers stood the cost for the pole, the costumes, while the
 
villagers threw up the money for the food and drink.  The Maypole
 
was made from a man -l
ak tree trunk, peeled and painted red.  From
 
the top hung ribbons of different colors,  and the person dancing
 
a certain ribbon had to wear clothes of that same color.
 The
 
man who stood in the middle, holding the pole, was dressed in
 
all the colors,  and your hat had to hang down by a ribbon in the
 
back of your head.  The hats were made out of cardboard, painted,
 
and there was a sash around the waist,  same color as your ribbon.
 
They would bring the Maypole into the village square.  The whole
 
village would be following them,  and when they'd meet in the
 
square, they'd make a space and all these people would sing and
 
dance the Maypole,  until a fight break out and everybody run
 
and leave.
 
Fights used to break out.  Maybe somebody wanted to come
 
inside and touch
' the Maypole '
or touch  the girls and these for-
eigners would say,  "Don't come inside here.  This is a Granadian
 
thing.  We organized this.  We the boss here "
 
"OK,  you're boss here so--this is our village..."  And so a
 
fight would break out,  and everybody scattered and run and break
 
up the Maypole.
 Next morning, we see this pole lying down with
 
I
 
all the ribbons.
 It was sad, very sad.  We would take away a
 
ribbon.
 Christmas done.
 
New Year's Day
  
Boxing Day was a lazy, quiet day.
 The people may visit each
 
other eating and drinking the leftovers from Christmas.  On New
 
Year's we
. children play top and sometimes the Methodist folk had
 
a tea meeting.
 These were the occasions for benefits for the
 
church fund,  and they normally happen on New Year's and sometimes
 
on August Day.
 
The whole congregation divided into classes.  Every class
 
leader is given five dollars,  and she gives out to her class mem-
bers one shilling each.  Five dollars is twenty shilling.
 So
 
each class member would have a shilling.
 Each member must go
 
take  her "talent" and work the talent.  You might make starch
 
and sell.  You might buy anything and work it.  And then talent
 
is called in,  and all the money is put together and they use that
 
to buy sugar and flour and thing to bake bread and tea.  But
 
don't fool yourself.
 Not a box of tea is bought.  Tea is not
 
tea,  it is cocoa tea you're talking about.  Chocolate.  They
 
bqil huge pots of chocolate.
 A rich person would give a barrel
 
of cocoa from his land.  Have you ever seen a big bar of raw
 
chocolate?  Those women would add spice as they pound it in
 
their deep mortars--vanilla and cinnamon and coconut fat--so
 
that when they boil that chocolate,  it smells sweet for miles
 
C
 
around,  and the eaters /ome down.
 
Each class member is supposed to sell so many tea-meeting
 
tickets.
 A tea-meeting ticket is for a shilling or a dollar.
 
That entitles you to come in and eat as much and drink as much
 
as you can.
 Mug after mug after mug after mug after mug of
 
chocolate and bread after bread after bread.
 We had a fella
 
called Jonathan Grey.
 He was our neighbor.
 Jonathan would
 
drink twelve mugs  of chocolate and eat fifty loaves of bread,
 
and he says,  "That is just wash-mouth."  You remember a "wash
 
-mouth" is just a bite early in the morning to help wait for
 
your breakfast.
 So nobody would sell Jonathan a ticket to a
 
tea-meeting.
 Each person who sells you a ticket has a table
 
and must sit down there and see that his people are satisfied.
 
Apart from eating,  drinking,  there's a concert, put on by
 
the women.
 And it is there that you have an opportunity to
 
recite Bible pieces and things like that.
 It is a church affair,
 
you see.
 
And all those big people will play those same games we have
 
in this book.
 There were people with calloused hands--fishermen,
 
w sherwomen.
 We children just stand up and watch.
 Those big
 
people had no time for children in this play.
 
My Aunt Annie knew all the games and she was the organizer
 
of those women.
 Aunt Annie was a real Amazon.
 She could tongue
 
-lash you or,  if you played that game wrong,  she would drag you
 
LA
 
out and say,  "Go and sit down."  My Aunt Annie was a very nice
 
woman,  but I seen her say,  "You're spoiling the damn game, man,"
 
and she'd drag that woman right out.
 
That whole village -is Methodist and every Methodist is
 
under oath to decorum,  and,  if you misconduct yourself,  that
 
whole village will come down on your head.  And if you boot a
 
follow up,  they'll say you perfectly right to boot him up.
 He
 
had no right to come and spoil up the people.
 "It's a church
 
thing, man,  it's God's church, man.
 Behave yourself."  And
 
if two times they talk to you,  you don't behave
. yourself, out
 
you go.
 So the big people playing the games, maybe the one
 
chance they have.
 
The little children would stand around and look at them,
 
and in "Drop Peter Drop," if somebody fall down,  as a child you
 
can't stand up there and laugh at that big person.
 Somebody
 
would go and hit you one box from behind.
 
On New Year's Day and on August Day top playing was as
 
important as marbles for young and old alike.
 If you didn't have
 
a top when that'day came,  it was a reflection on your parents.'
 
We had a neighbor called Simon Felix, who was crippled and so
 
his son didn't have a top.  My mother used to say,  "Charles,
 
call Felix child and give him a top."
 It was sad to think that
 
New Year's come and a child didn't have a top.
 
You see,  all our tops were home-made.
 Store-bought tops
 
would have been useless in the top games we played, where the
 
aim was to split the other fellows' tops.
 Your top was made of
 
the hardest wood, well-cured,  and had a tenpenny nail in the
 
end,  ground to a chisel edge or a needle point.
 My father used
 
to make tops for us, but when we became too many, my mother
 
would bring home this famous top-maker called Brightman Adams,
 
and he would bed down in our house,  eating our food and sleeping
 
on his corn-husk mattress, making tops for us.
 
This Brightman was a giant who knew all the secrets of top-
I
1
U1!..
 
it stands erect in -play,  and it must sing or hum loudly while it
 
is spinning.
 It must be made of tough wood so that it will not
 
easily split,  if punctured.
 Brightman used dog-wood,  a yellow
 
-looking wood with a nice smell.

.e that had 
a knot in it,  rather than a straight grain,  not so likely to bust
 
when somebody hit it.
 He taught us how to "quail" or cure the
 
wood by burying it in the earth.
 He showed us how to shape the
 
top with a sharp pen knife,  how to smooth it with a glass-bottle
 
c4tter,  and paint it and decorate it.
 And from Brightman we
 
learned the magic of top-making.
 The wood must come from an old
 
branch, when the sap was going down and when the moon was weak
 
The top
 
certain deadly deadly herbs like stinging nettle.  You learned
 
to play top slowly from older men.
 Practice consists of punch-
ing holes in a piece of board laid on the ground in one's own
 
back yard.
 To open the game a ring is drawn on the ground and
 
several players aim to strike inside the ring.  Those striking
 
outside must put down their tops in the ring so the others can
 
aim their blows at it.  You whip your top,  aiming to hit a top
 
in the ring with the sharp pointed nail at the end of your top.
 
It's like throwing a dagger at a man7 you got to be skilled doing
 
that.
 A good blow is expected to chip the side of the top on the
 
ground or to split it in half.
 My brother and I were famous, but
 
there were some fellows from up on the hill, we used to call them
 
top-jumbies (ghosts), because they never miss.
 
In Char1otte iille tops was a game for boys and for men.  You
 
had no right to a top if you were a girl,  although we had some
 
Congo people,  some Amazon kind of folk, whose daughters used to
 
play top like men.  We were afraid of them.  When those girls
 
attack,  they kick and butt you and tear the clothes right off
 
your body.
 They were fierc & women.
 In fact top-playing could
 
even be dangerous,  and parents insist that only age-mates play
 
together since older boys had the habit of running over the
 
littler ones.
 There's a marking line at which I must stand to
 
strike at your top.
 If I get over that line and bust your
 
top,  I have io give you my top--if my top is good enough.
 If
 
it's not,  then I'm supposed to pay you for your top.
 Arguments
 
over these things have led to family fights and even ended up
 
in magistrate's court.
 
Carnival
  
In colonial times,  under French rule, Carnival lasted from
 
Christmas till Ash Wednesday,  two whole months of fete and
 
frolicking.
 Today,  under strict government regulation, we hold
 
Carnival for the two days before Ash Wednesday, on Lundi Gras  
and Mardi Gras, a period of freedom to roam the streets,  dressed
 
in new clothes,  spending money, dancing, visiting with friends.
 
Children are excited because they get plenty food,  pops,  balloons,
 
special clothes, boots,  hats,  and on Sunday night there's Kiddies
 
Carnival.
 Today more and more children are coming out for
 
Kiddies Carnival as the community becomes more wealthy and the
 
parents buy costumes so that their children can enter the compe-
titions.
 These are judged on five points--best dress, best
 
acting,  topicality, design of artwork,  and spirit of carnival.
 
You have all kinds of themes.
 One year it was the butter-
flies of Trinidad and Tobago
 One year it was the sea gardens
 
of Tobago, with all the fishes you see on Bocu reef.  One cos-
tume was a sea porcupine and at the ends of every steel wire
 
there was a fish knitted in wirework.  Carnival draws out the
 
genius in people.
 They had one costume made like  the old
 
British penny, thick enough to hold a little girl.
 The head of
 
Britannia on the penny was the face of the little girl.  When
 
Lç
'
 
she touched a little button, the penny door opened up,  and you
 
saw a gold and beautiful child inside.
 
Monday morning,  at six o'clock, there is a short pageant
 
called iou'-'vert (daybreak).
 In this "old mask," a remain of
 
scandalous and often illegal masking of earlier days, the people
 
dress in rags, enact the comesse (the social scandals)  and lam-
poon the high and powerful in the country.  These iouve
 maskers
 
take to the streets and herald Carnival with their antics, but
 
earlier than these officially permitted sca
ndal-mongers appear
 
other,  illegal groups, dash into the streets, dance for a brief
 
moment,  and disappear into their hiding places.  This bastard
 
edition of -
jouvert,  called jouvert pas ça jouvert (daybreak is
 
not daybreak)  is extremely erotic and pornographic--trans -
vestites with red ink on their bodies like menstrual blood and
 
so on.
 If the police catch them they are sure to incarcerate
 
them.
 Every year since the Carnival riots of 1881, when the
 
people of Trinidad successfully fought off an attempt by the
 
Crown to emasculate and effectively abolish Carnival, the police
 
officially, by proclamatiOf
l,'allOW Carnival,  specifying the
 
ecact hours and other conditions under which the fete may be
 
engaged in.
 
C, 
"
I, Ellis Clark, by the graIe of God the governor, hereby
 
proclaim that Carnival should begin on such and such a day and
 
at such and such a time."  so if you play jouvert pas ça jouvert
  
and get in the hand of the police, they lock you up.
 And if
 
you play one minute after midnight, Tuesday,  they lock you up,
 
too.
 So the bell goes eight on Monday and the bands come out
 
and they're judged.
 It's all satire and humor, projected
 
through plastic art,  costuming,  and buffoonery.
 They say
 
Monday is no mass  (masquerade), but yet Monday can be nice;
 
they don't send the kings and queens,  they send little samples
 
from the big bands to compete.
 
Tuesday those big bands begin to come.
 They take two hours
 
before the judges.
 The glory that was Greece--you have ten
 
different categories of Greeks in authentic costume,  and each
 
category is a hundred strong, man and woman.
 The subjects
 
of Ghengis Khan; twelve categories of the people that were in
 
Ghengis Khan day.
 And each category is hundreds and all jump-
ing to the tune of Sparrow music.
 The whole of China passing
 
in front of you face,  jumping in Trinidad style.
 I don't
 
think the Romans had anything like that.
 
When they played To Hell and Back, the year after the war,
 
they fished up all those old 'broken down motor car parts,  took
 
the chassis and made tanks which looked as authentic as a real
 
tank.
 Where they got the clothes from,  I don't know, but they
 
had authentic army clothes,  green clothes like Castro--hat,
 
helmet,  everything.
 Thousands of people in that band.
 And
 
guns going o
.
 The guns look so real,  I was scared to death.
 
So I go to my friend,  the bandleader,  the big bad man,  I say,
 
"George where you-all get all these things."
 
He say,  "Ah, Mister Elder, we buy that long time."  And he
 
laughing.
 
If you are a married man,  you better get that esusu money
 
in January to buy me Carnival clothes, because I am Mrs. So
 
-and-So and I want me dress hang up there, I want me new shoes,
 
I want new shoes for the children, because we are going to
 
Sari Fernando to see mass.
 So whether you're a peasant or
 
whether you're a teacher or whether you are a senior civil
 
servant,  you better put out that money for Mrs. So-and-So and
 
the children to buy the Carnival clothes,  a broad sombrero for
 
the boy,  domino for the girl,  the wife have to have her hair
 
done, because for two days you're sitting down on that stand
 
with your big hamper--good food,  rice and beans,  and the best
 
rum inside there,  because it's a conspicuous thing.  You can't
 
come and eat bread and sweet drinks and call yourself Mrs.
 
So-and-So.
 
"Darling,  I have some po±k here,  you can have another piece,
 
.
,.Darling,  I have some turkey here,  you can get a little..."
 
All that is coming out of your backbone in Carnival.
 The
 
Trinidad man will tell you that his wife would pawn her gold
 
bangles to get money to pay Carnival...
 Wednesday morning after
 
you take your ashes you begin your esusu for next year Carnival.
 
As you come out of the church, you say,  "Boy, what we gonna play
 
/
 
for next Carnival?"  And you're getting ideas.
 You read in
 
book in library to get ideas.
 Your head going round and say
 
what we going to play?  Who we going to play with?  You're the
 
whole year planning.
 This is a people who work like hell.
 
They work hard.
 And they play hard.
 To see a factory man or
 
a chief civil servant jump in that band or a Senator winding
 
on the road under his beautiful costume,  say "Who is that?"
 
"Dr. Warden, man,  it's Dr. Warden.
 He playing -j
ouvert." 
That's us.
 Play.
 Not by yourself at all.
 Always a group...
 
All of us are friends, working in this office.  We gonna play
 
butterflies.
 Some black as the ace of spades,  some fair,  and
 
they're all playing butterflies--black butterfly, big blue,  all
 
the butterflies of Trinidad.
 And when one of those little
 
nigger girls put on that costume of butterflies, man,  you could
 
eat them raw,  they sweetness.
 But Wednesday morning she's sit-
ting down there doing my files,  as efficient as you want.  Work
 
and play,  play and work...
 
Bonqo
  
in our village there were some women whom my grandmother
 
celled "quelbe people" who were great drummers.
 You could hear
 
them by night drumming and singing old African songs and beat-
ing on their Mali doun-doun, as their drums were called in
 
CharlotteVille.
 Sometimes these women would get together with
 
the younger people and teach them the songs,  the drumming
 
techniques and how to mark rhythm with stamping tubes made of
 
bamboo.
 They showed you how to clap,  they showed you how to
 
drum,  they showed you how to dance,  they showed you everything.
 
They were good church people; they used to come to church, but
 
their names were not in any book.
 They were heathens, but be-
cause they were good dancers and singers, people would bring
 
them down to do their thing at the wakes for the dead,  because
 
the Bongo,  or wake-house rituals, with dancing and singing and
 
feasting was the area in which these old Congo women specialized.
 
Their songs were about war and fighting in Africa and about
 
slavery.
 Some were lecherous wake-house songs about the dead
 
and procreation,  and their dancing was wild and erotic and
 
the Methodists forbade their members from participating in
 
wake-house rituals on the grounds that it was pagan.
 Methodist
 
children were forbidden to attend.
 My mother said that Bongo
 
was the devil's business and a Bongo king couldn't pass across
 
our yard,  so that by and large we never knew very much about
 
Bongo until we grew up.
 
The wake for the dead goes on for many nights,  and every
 
night there is singing and dancing.
 I don't think they even
 
notice they are laughing and crying,  both.
 People outside tell-
ing jokes and laughing.
 People inside the house crying like
 
hell,  because if you don't cry when somebody in your family
 
die,  people suspect that you killed your father or something
 
like that.
 There is compulsory mourning.
 
A woman, who has been watching over her dying husband,
 
when she is sure her husband is dead,  she is supposed to come
 
and stand in her door there and bawl,  loud,  and people will run
 
and say,  "What happened?"
 
"Charles dead."
 
And then they run down the streets and carry the news,  tell
 
everybody "Charles Elder dead, Charles Elder dead."
 
Everybody who hears that news who is a cousin or family
 
must wail loud.
 All the family will take  up the wailing.
 You
 
will hear them wailing all over the village.
 They take a big
 
white towel and tie it under the abdomen in order to allow them
 
to bawl.
 They will come to the house of death and give their
 
condolence to the widow.
 
As the men gather,  there is one saying you always hear...
 
"Man dead, man there... Man dead, man there," making joke in
 
the face of death.
 To a man whose infant has died in the
 
course of being born,  they say,  "Water throw way,  coco no
 
broke..."
 This means that w
l-i
ile the infant has died (water
 
t
h rown away)  the mother  (
coco,  the calabash bowl to hold
 
water)  still lives.
 
By the time they begin to Bongo man,  nobody crying again.
 
If that woman crying,  she in the house.
 They done bind up her
 
belly already.
 People have taken over in the yard.
 The coffin
 
is being made.
 Food is being cooked.
 The women inside there
 
sewing the shroud,  they tell her,  "All  right, you don't inter-
fere, Mrs. Elder.
 Sit down, keep quiet."
 So if she's crying,
 
she is crying very quietly.
 Because people have taken over.
 
On the first Sunday night after the death the wake takes
 
the form of a sacred ceremony.
 The participants dress in
 
Sunday clothes--white for females, black for males.
 Hymns are
 
sung and speeches are made in praise of the deceased.
 In
 
17
 
/
ç & Toco there is folk eulogy called a "heartfelt," usually given
 
by a friend of the family,  in which all the dead person's
 
virtues are reviewed and praised,  the audience cheering from
 
time to time.
 
To the very strait-laced,  the nights of Bongo that follow
 
were ungodly.
 Some Methodist ministers denounced it as the
 
'devil dance.'
 But because Charlotteville was rather evenly
 
divided between the Episcopalians and the Methodists,  a com-
promise was reached.
 Bongo was African,  it was said,  and the
 
church should not interfere with things cultural as long as
 
the people attended church and paid their dues.
 So the Bongo
 
wakes continued and outstanding churchmen took part.
 Fear of
 
community retribution for not supporting ceremonials for the
 
dead was powerful in the village.
 No argument about churchly
 
proscriptions could prevail over the social obligations the
 
individual £61t, when a friend or kinsman had died and was to
 
be buried.
 In time this conflict disappeared and church
 
members could attend the Bongo wakes provided they did not
 
join too openly in the dancing and singing and card-playing.
 
Everybody who comes brings rum, brings food, brings all
 
kin of things.
 The Bongo in the traditional way goes on for
 
nine nights.
 Some would be playing card games--seven-eleven,
 
the devil's '
fame.
 Over there some people are telling Nansi
 
stories.
 Over there some people are playing ring games and
 
stone games.
 Over here some people are dancing and singing
 
Bongo.
 The man who boss all this--the best dancer--the one
 
that know all the songs in his head--is the Bongo king.
 Every
 
game have its own formation.
 He invites the people,  he forms
 
them up, he gives them the "croix-croix" sticks, he starts up
 
the song and demonstrates the dance.
 
Vini ouwais,  vini ouwais,  Bongo...
 
There are about five basic Bongo steps, but dancers often
 
improvise others as the music gets hotter.
 Men and women
 
dance in pairs with much body contact.
 Often two men dance,
 
each one trying -to do steps the other cannot follow,  demon-
s rating their endurance and skill to the women in movements
 
that clearly represent the sex act.
 Others involve acrobatic
 
skill.
 In one,  two men with knees full bent, balance on thei
 
toes,  hopping and kicking forward with each foot alternately
 
to the beat of the music.
 In another they balance the whole
 
body on one hand and spin round and round,  as they kick out-
wards.
 In another,  called in Creole--Zherbe non tout comma  
plait --a man and a woman face each other, hop first on one
 
foot,  then the other, meanwhile throwing the other leg over
 
the shoulder of their partner!
 
The probability is very, very great that if a woman dances
 
a Bongo with you twice,  she's making an opening for you,  and
 
everybody would know.
 Because Bongo is open.
 It's one time
 
when nobody pulls any punches at all.
 Everybody knows what
 
Bongo is all about. Like if your girlfriend pairs off with
 
another man dancing that we would call that vulgar dance, he
 
may come and grab her out, beat her up right there.  Tempers
 
flare very high, because dancing the Bongo, man,  is just a step
 
removed from the sex act in the minds of many people.
 The
 
children who come look at the big ones and so on,  they learn
 
everything,  really,  at a Bongo.  When the Nansi story come they
 
dig out all the children, bring them,  sit them around to tell
 
the story.
 The audience is mdtiy adult, but whatever children
 
k
 
are there,  they bring them ráund to hear the stories as well.
 
But Bongo is for grown people.  They will dance Bongo all
 
evening.
 At midnight they will feed you, clear the ring and
 
the Bongo king will call out,  "Boys,  it's limbo now,  limbo,
 
limbo."
 
"All right,  lend me your cutlass."
 
Man takes cutlass, he run in the bush, he cuts two forked
 
sticks, he sharpen the bottom of those sticks and he drive them
 
in the ground.
 Then he get a bamboo stick and he puts it
 
across there,  usually waist high.  None of this lowering down
 
to six  inches or so.
 I'm talking about the natural limbo. The
 
dancers would be singing:
 
Liza come lay lay lay,
 
Liza come limbo like-a me.
 
I wonder why nobody will limbo w
 ith me,
 
Limbo,  limbo with-a me.
 
I want a little woman to limbo with me,
 
Limbo,  limbo with-a me.
 
All through the night the champions challenge Bongo kings
 
from neighboring villages to the limbo tournament.
 The fame
 
of champions spreads to other villages and they travel from
 
wake-house to wake-house to compete.
 Nowadays every West Indian
 
dance troupe on tour features these limbo experts,  as their
 
top attractions.
 Pearl Primus was the first dancer to choreo-
graph the limbo for the stage when she did research in Trinidad
 
with students from Columbia University under Vera Rubin in the
 
early fifties,  and since then the limbo has become a popular
 
public entertainment in Trinidad,  in fact,  all over the world.
 
Sophisticated limbo equipment flies with these troupes to
 
London or to Africa where Pearl Primus says limbo originated.
 
Some professional dancers make it under the cross-bar at
 
four inches.
 Six people passing below the bar with two women
 
balancing on their legs and one standing on her head,  the limbo
 
bar soaked down with  paraffin, blazing like hell,  and fire
 
dropping on the fellow's belly and burning him.
 That's show-
manship,  city business,  not the real hard rock limbo in the
 
middle of the bush, when I u ed to see it.
 A session might
 
last until one or two in the morning and the Bongo king say,
 
"Mister Chairman, me throat is dry."
 
The house-master will fetch a bottle of rum for the men and
 
a bottle of wine for the women.
 He will put them in a conspic-
uous place near a flambeau and say,  "Anybody with a dry throat,
 
go take a sip."
 
If you take too much he'll cork the bottle.
 He must stay
 
sobor himself and he must control the dancing and singing.
 This
 
is his power.
 He is the Bongo king.
 He call,  "Next game is
 
the Stone Game."
 
The Stone Game is played by young and old alike, but all men.
 
They kneel on the ground in a circle.
 In front of the leader
 
is a pile of stones, big as two fists, one for each man in the
 
circle.
 The song starts...
 
When I was in jail I heard the bugle blow,
 
When I was in jail I heard the bugle blow,
 
Comin' back to my country to see you.
 
The leader starts beating the rhythm of the song on the
 
ground with a stone.
 After a couple of bars he slaps down that
 
stone in front of the player on his right.
 That player snatches
 
that stone and slaps it down in front of the player on his right,
 
and at the same time the leader slaps down another stone in front
 
of him,  all in time to the music.
 Each player repeats the action
 
with each stone as it appear  in front of him,  till all those
 
stones are moving around the circle in rhythm.
 
Roll,  boy,  roll,  you rollin' like a drum,
 
Roll, boy,  roll,  you rollin'  like a drum,
 
Comin' back to my country to see you.
 
Next the leader will stop passing stones until they all pile
 
up in front of him.
 Then he'll pass them to his left.
 
Fight,  boys,  fight and never run away,
 
Fight, boys,  fight and never run away,
 
Comm ' back to my country to see you.
 
The stones go round and round the circ1e--bop  bop  bop
 
bop --like a military drill.
 You mustn't miss the beat or a
 
stone will catch your fingers and bust it up.
 I've seen men
 
playing this thing with coconuts, wicked fellows.
 No women go
 
near that.
 It's a sea captain's wake and they're full of rum
 
and fish broth.
 They've been drinking all day pnd they're
 
happy.
 There's twenty of them and you can image the noise of
 
those twenty coconuts going down--Boum  Boum  Boum
 Imagine
 
those big 'ippery coconuts.  You've got to grab each one and
 
slam it down to your right and not miss a beat.
 If you do,
 
your finger is in trouble
 
Me stone is me stone,
 
Miss Mary, Miss Mary, Miss Mary,
 
Pass am gi'e-am,  lick am dung,
 
Is me stone, Miss Mary.
 
They play another game with long bamboo sticks.  You hold
 
ends of two sticks and I ho1  the other ends.
 The dancer jumps
 
up on those two poles and we polemen lift them and swing them
 
from side to side and the dancer must dance and keep his balance
 
and not fall while we try to pitch him off...
 The Bongo king
 
carries all these games in his head.
 He's the dancing master
 
and as long as he stay,  there's something happening on the
 
grounds--they're building the coffin,  they're scraping the hog,
 
they're pounding chocolate,  they're baking bread.  Maybe some
 
woman would break up the Bongo,  say,  "Stop the damn Bongo and
 
come help us chop some wood."  Otherwise those men would Bongo
 
till daybreak.
 
to nine
 
Bongo go on seven/nights,  and it gets sweeter every night.
 
Maybe a visitor from a faraway village might bring in a new
 
Bongo song or dance that nobody know.
 A man from way out in
 
Mason Hall brought in this Bongo,  "Passe, Manuel," and it went
 
like wildfire.
 It's an animal game,  in which dog and cat and
 
all the animals pass up manuel.
 
First you got to decide who is cat, who is mule, who is
 
goat, who is Manual.
 
"What you want?"
 
"I want goat."
 
"What you want?"
 
"I want sheep."
 That mean you have to "bah-bah" when you
 
pass Manuel.
 
All the animals stand up in a circle with a space between
 
each one,  and the person who is Manuel stands in the middle ana
 
he has to look real bad,  like sonebody you will pass on the
 
road without '
saying "good day" or "good morning" to.
 All the
 
animals face inwards,  looking at Manuel,  clapping as they sing.
 
Go 'way, Manuel,  go way yonder,
 
Me don't want you no mo'  longer.
 
Passé, Manuel, passé, Manuel,
 
Dog and all are passé Manuel.
 
Passé, Manuel, passé, Manuel,
 
Cat and all are passé Manuel...
 
Meantime,  all the animals, one after another,  pass Manuel
 
by, without greeting him, passing him zig-zag,  like threading a
 
needle.
 You have been taught to say "good morning" to everybody
 
you meet, whether he's a beggar or a tubber-foot man,* it doesn't
 
matter.
 If your neighbors are quarreling, you must say "good
 
morning" when you pass.
 But Manuel is a villager whd has fallen
 
out of grace and is despised and not even the animals will greet
 
him.
 The donkey pass him with his foot in the air.
 Ram-goat
 
with his
 But Manuel is not
 
greeted.
 Maybe he's the old Spanish element, and the Creole
 
-speaking French folks are mocking him.
 Maybe he's a villager,
 
fallen out of grace so not eYen the animals greet him.
 The
 
donkey pass him with his foot in the air.
 Ram-goat with his
 
long pecker out.
 Cow bawling.
 Pull-frog grunting and hopping
 
--every animal acting his part so everybody know which animal
 
*  See page
 
pass Manuel.
 The last one to go by change places with Manuel
 
and Manuel go to the head of the line.
 He becomes the first
 
animal and then all change in order.
 The game over when every-
body has played Manuel and every animal.
 
Go way, Manuel,  go way yonder,
 
Me don't want you no mo' yonder.
 
You bongo till the people tired and begin to fade out.
 To-
wards daybreak the Bongo king reminds the dancers that they have
 
to work the next day.
 
"Poor people want a little sleep.
 Let we go home."
 
One by one the crowd leaves,  after a last drink of rum or
 
coffee.
 To keep away the juinbies (ghosts)  that may try to
 
follow them.
 
,SO 
r
ne may wash their faces with some rum and turn
 
their shirts inside out before setting out along the dark roads
 
and tracks that lead towards their homes.
