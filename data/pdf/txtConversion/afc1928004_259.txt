:Biographical Sketch of 
THOMAS HARPER,. 
The subject of this little sketch was born August 26th, 
1846, in Bellville, Illinois, fourteen miles east of Saint Louis, 
• Mo. When but a 
year old his parents removed to Quincy, 
Adams County, Illinois, one of the prettiest towns situated on 
the Mississippi River. 
Here Tom passed his childhood days, 
and it was here he made his first appearance upon the BOARDS, 
playing the parts of Prince Harry in the stranger, and Master 
George in Uncle Tom's Cabin ; both child's parts. 
This was 
in 1853, with Duff's Dramatic Company, at Kendall's Hall, then 
the only recognized show hall in the town. 
At the outbreak 
of the war in 1861, he was among the first to enroll his name 
among the brave men who enlisted as volunteers for three 
months. 
He was at this time only fifteen years of age, and 
being too small to carry a 
musket, he was installed as the 
drummer for the company 
After serving his time he was 
discharged, and wishing to re-enlist with his old comrades, 
he offered his services again, this time for three years, his 
captain although admiring his courage and patriotism declined 
to accept him, saying, "he was too young to endure the 
hardships and privations of a 
soldier's life." 
So, with kind 
wishes, Ton and his comrades parted, he going home to 
5 
4 
Quincy with the determination of enlisting in the first regi-
ment that would take him. 
This opportunity soon presented 
itself; for in less than three months his name was again en-
rolled as a 
volunteer in Company B. 26th Illinois. 
And soon 
they were at the seat of war fighting for their country. He 
passed unharmed through seven battles. 
At the battle of Iuka, 
Mississippi, September 19th, 1862, he was wounded by a 
piece of a 
shell in the right leg ; It was found necessary to 
amputate his limb. 
After laying in the hospitals in different 
parts of the country, he was discharged and pensioned by the 
United States, and sent home after his health was sufficiently 
recovered. 
In connection with Professor De Francois, he organized a 
small variety troupe under the name of De Francois Combin-
ation, which financially was a 
failure. 
His next attempt in 
show business was at St. Joe, Mo. 
Having seen Billy Emer-
son in his songs and dances, be conceived the idea that if a 
man with one leg could only do the same it would be a 
sen-
sation. 
So acting upon this idea he immediately put it into 
execution by practicing. 
He made his debut at the Cricket 
Varieties, 1870, for the benefit of Harry Spriggs, and James 
Gilroy, and created such a 
genuine sensation that he was en-
gaged for three weeks. 
At the close of his engagement 
he went to Omaha, playing there two months, He went to 
Cheyenne for six weeks. 
In Salt Lake City, he played in 
Brigham Young's theatre and created a 
grand sensation among 
the Mormonites. 
After playing in all the principal towns in 
the far West, he returned to Denver, Colorado, there joining 
Purdy and McDonald's Minstrels, who made their pioneer 
trip to Southern Colorado and New Mexico, meeting with 
success everywhere. He finally returned to Denver under 
engagement to Charlie Ward of the Corn Exchange Varieties. 
He made himself a 
favorite at once, staying there sixteen 
weeks to crowded houses. He then came East to Chicago, 
(his parents having removed there.) He set about making 
engagements; but having no reputation with Eastern mana-
gers he could'ut get an opening for some time. 
After laying 
idle four months, Gardiner and Trimple, of Pittsburg, offered 
hnn one week, which he accepted and made a tremendous 
hit. 
From there he went to Philadelphia. 
At the Grand 
Central he made another success, playing there three weeks. 
He then opened at Shelby's Comique, Buffalo, New York, 
drawing crowded houses nightly ; and it's to manager Shelby 
he owes his present reputation, he being the first manager 
who took any interest in him. From that time until the 
present he has had no trouble in making engagements, but 
is in demand at all times. 
While playing in Troy, New York, he met his friend and 
partner, George Stansill, who was one of the employees of the 
house. 
They practiced together during his engagement there, 
and November 9th, 1874, they made their first appearance 
together at the Grand Central Theatre, Brooklyn, and 
wherever they have appeared since, they have made the great-
est ot successes, being pronounced the greatest novelty on the 
American stage. 
-Mr. Harper is 
the Author of the following songs and

sketches : 
"Home from the war." " True Irish hearts," " The Veter-
ans," "Lively Mokes," " Flag we love the best," " The land 
of the free," " Two organ grinders," etc., etc. 
GEORGE STAN-SILL, 
The subject of this sketch was born in Albany, New York, 
September 3d, 1856, his parents residing there at the present 
time. 
At the age of six while playing with some of his school 
mates he fell and fractured his knee, his parents used every 
endeavor to save his limb from amputation, spending thou-
sands of dollars to skilful physicians and surgeons; but all 
—o purpose, for after four years of the most intense suffer-
ing they came to the conclusion that they would have to am-
putate the limb to save his life, which was done on the 22d 
of November, 1865, he being at the time only nine years old. 
His first appearance before the public was at Acker's Varieties, 
Troy, ; 
New York, September 5th, 1873, appearing at Rosa 
6 
Lee's benefit, in a 
jig, dancing with such precision of time and 
execution that a 
person turning their back to him would think 
that he was dancing with two legs instead of one. 
His next 
appearance was at the Grand Central Theatre Brooklyn, E. D. 
November 9th, 1874, where after long and arduous practice, 
he appeared in conjunction with his partner, Tom Harper, 
they making a 
hit. 
They are both possessed of good voices 
which blend harmoniously together, and their dancing is 
simply marvelous and shows that practice and perseverance 
will accomplish anything. 
They are at present playing to 
crowded houses at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, this city. 
EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESS. 
New York Clipper, Dec. 1874. 
The new appearances this week are the great one- legged 
song and dance artists, Messrs. Harper and Stansill who have 
taken Yew York by storm, creating a 
genuine sensation; 
their dancing is done with the aid of a 
crutch, and it is 
wonderful how they do it so well. 
New York Herald, Dec. 30th, 1874. 
Among the new faces at the Olympic Theatre, this week, are 
Harper and StansB, the famous one legged song and dance 
men, who are received with unbounded Itpplause and admira-

Philadelphia, Dec. 18th, 1874. 
I 
take great pleasure in recommending Messrs. Harper and 
Stansill, the one-legged dancer3 as the greatest novelty in the 
show business, thc y 
having made the largest hit of any two 
people here this season, and are re-engaged to me, April 5th.

WANT TO SEE THE OLD HOME AGAIN, 
Music by 3 
AmEs E. 
STEWART. Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung amid tremendous applause by Harper and Stansid, in their act 
entitled the Veterans. 
-WE'VE wandered very far away from the place we were born, 
And my poor heart has been to sad, dejected and forlorn, 
No master kind to treat us well, to cheer us when in pain, 
I 
want to ace the cotton fields and the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
For the good old days are past and gone 
I 
sigh for them in vain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, and the dear old home again.. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, when my days are- very few, 
My wife and children they are gone, I 
don't know what to do, 
Old master too he must be dead, his hair was turning gray, 
Oh take me to my home again before I 
pass away! 
For the good old days, etc. 
Words by J. A, Grum 
Music by JAMES E. 
STEwART. 
ONE night I 
was walking along when I 
saw 
A 
poor little boy in the street, 
His face it was covered with tears and dirt, 
And no shoes on his poor little feet, 
He stopped me and asked me for twenty-five cents, 
Said he had int eaten food all the day, 
I 
saie, where's your mother ? 
Fie stammered and said, my mother has gone out to pray, 
C.EORt-S. 
The fire has gone out, we've nothing to eat, 
And Sammy's been crying all day, 
Who'll give me some money to buy us some bread? 
for my mother lias gone out to pray. 
She says that the men are so wicked you know, 
And giving their minds up to drink, 
And now she has joined the crusader's band, 
And they're making things lively I 
think, 
For father can't get any whisky-down town, 
So he brought home a 
bottle to-day, 
And he's blind staving drank in the woodshed behind, 
While my mother has gone out to pray. 
The fire has gone out, 
11 
She left me at home to take care of the boys, 
And they're screaming and squalling so queer, 
And Tommy fell on to the stove while ago, 
And nearly burnt off all his e 
r, 
And the baby fell o 
it of the cradle and cryed, 
And the very old duce wai to pay, 
For the grub is locked, and we've nothing to eat 
Since my mother has gone out to pray. 
The fire has gone out, etc. 
I 
gave him some money to buy him some bread, 
And I 
thought all the women a 
For the men their bottles will fill on ; he sly, 
And for meanuesi 
drink all the more; 
They'd better stay home a:.,d Enke care of their house, 
And not leave their children fit day, 
For there's many an urchin a 
crying for bread, 
While his moilitr has gone out to pray, 
The fire has gone out, etc. 
Song and Dance as rerformed by HARPER & STANSILL. 
1WAS a 
Saturday afternoon, as down the street I 
went, 
I 
passed a 
damsel who was fair; 
And as she glided by, I 
was stifled by the scent 
That came from her glossy, curly hair. 
She wore a 
gaiter boot, the size was number three. 
Which attracted my attention for awhile; 
And when she saw me looking, she tossed her curls at me, 
And also cast a 
most bewitching smile. 
CHORUS, 
Yes, she tossed her curls at me in a 
manner that was free, 
Did this pretty little damsel so fair. 
I 
shall netr forget that foot, nor that natty little boot, 
Belonging to the girl with the glossy hair. 
I 
watched her around the corner, ' till she was out of sight, 
Then waited near the crossing for a 
car; 
And when I 
took my seat, I 
noticed to the riht 
The little one conversing with her pa. 
I 
knew she had been shopping, by the bundles that she had, 
But what they contained I 
could' at see; 
And when she reached her home, she passed them to her pa, 
Then with a 
smile, she tossed her curls at me. 
Yes, she tossed her curls, &c. 
-THERE'S MAGIC IN A 
KISS, 
As Sung by HARPER & STANSILL with great success throughout 
the United States, 
Music by GEO. CATLIN, 
IN life there's nothing sweeter 
Than to have or be a 
beau; 
It's nice to court a 
pretty girl, 
But that you fellows all know. 
Now I 
have got a 
sweetheart, 
A 
charming little miss, 
And that is how I 
come to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
CHORUS. 
My charming little fairy, 
(BREAK.) 
So blithesome and airy. 
(BREAK.) 
Oh, my heart is captivated 
By a 
charming little miss, 
And that is how I 
come to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
Now when two lovers quarrel, 
They'll sit zo,e pout awhile, 
Then one or the other, will very soon 
Provoke a 
friendly smile. 
Then making up's delightful, 
The way it's done is this— 
He clasps her in her arms, and, well 
There's magic in a 
hi. 
My charming little fairy, &c. 
CEASE your repining, bright eyes are shining, 
Pont. Iicart..,. are melting with fervent love; 
Red cheeks are paling, sweethearts bewailing, 
Tarry not one moment from the girl you love. 
She's sure to cheer you when she comes near you, 
She's ever waiting for the fond sweet kiss; 
If you're inclined for a 
midnight ramble, 
Tell me what you think of a 
scene like this. 
CHORUS. 
Wait till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk, 
Mind what you say, boys, that's how to court her, 
Tell her that you'll wed when the days grow short. 
See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight, making the heart bright, 
Waking up the little birds before the break ot day. 
Tickling and teazina% kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots ol little fibs, and swearing they are true, 
Some say it's naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait one moment and 
tell you what to do. 
Wait till the moonlight, & c,

WALKING IN THE SNOW, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As performed 'Mtn great success by II 1RPER <4-; STANSILL. 
ONE afternoon in Winter, when the snow was falling fast, 
In turning down a 
by street there a 
maid I 
chanced to pass; 
Her cheeks they looked quite ruddy, at least I 
thought them so 
I 
turned around and spoke to her, while walking in the snow. 
CHORUS. 
Walking in the snow, boys, not going very fast, 
I 
found it very pleasant, and the time so quickly passed. 
I 
love this little darling, l'd have you all to know, 
I'll ne'er forget the day I 
met her, while walking in the snow. 
A 
year and more we courted, without having any strife, 
I 
asked this darling creature if she would be my wife. 
She said to me, my dearest, anon Til let you know, 
But if I 
do, I'll ne'er forget, our walking in the snow. 
Walking in the snow, iv.c.

CHARMING LITTLE LOU. 
An performed with great success by HARPER & STANSILL. 
White, Smith Sc, Perry, Boston, Publishers. 
I'VE sang to you quite oft' before, 
Of charming girls divine; 
But now l've found a 
dearer one, 
She is a 
beau of mine. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
As soft as heavens bluo; 
Each day I 
bless the hour I 
met 
My charming, little Lou. 
CHORUS. 
• 
Oh, yes, I 
love her dear as life, 
And to me she is true, 
I'm only waiting for the day 
I 
shall wed my little. 
Lou. 
We met one summer's evening 
When the sun was sinking low, 
In Central Park, down by the fount, 
Where sparkling waters flow. 
She smiled so sweet, and then she blushed 
As I 
was passing by; 
Meet me to-morrow evening here, 
A 
smile was my reply. 
Oh, yes, I 
love her, ST,c.. 
SUNDAY, WHEN THE BELLS BEGIN TO 
RING. 
Song and Dance, written and sung by MAY FLORENCE only. 
IT was summer and the men', birds were singing, 
I 
was strolling by a 
brook • ne Sunday Morn, 
And wishing then to hear the Church bells ringing, 
When I 
met the sweetest d 
trling ever born, 
With a 
jaunty hat and saucy laughing eyes, 
As lovely as a 
queen she was dressed, 
When she smiled on me I 
was struck with surprise. 
And thought if she were mine I 
would be blessed. 
CHORUS. 
She's an Angel from above, 
To my neck I 
fell in love; 
She's as pretty as the picture of an angel, 
And sweeter than the birds she can sing, 
I 
met her by the brook last Sunday morning, 
It was just before the bells began to ring. 
(break) 
(break) 
I 
stepped up to her side and raised .ny bat, 
For my heart was in a 
flutter of delight, 
I 
scarcely knew what compliment to pay her. 
So I 
told her that her eyes were sparkling bright. 
Then she took my arm, in such a 
stylish way, 
And seemed to be so happy all the while; 
When I 
asked her to be my wife, said I'd stick to her 
through life. 
She sweetly answered yes, and then she smiled. 
She's an angel from abc,ve, 16c. 
As sung with great success by GARNELLA Baorims.. 
JOHN BULL he was an Englishman, 
Who went on tramp one day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
For to carry him a 
long way; 
He traveled along for many a 
mile, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Until he met an Irishman 
By the Jame of Pat Magee. 
Good morning, Pat, says Johnny Bull, 
Where are you going to? 
Oh, faith, I 
do not know, says Pat, 
I'm looking for a 
job to do. 
Can yo—u 
lend me a 
shilling, Paddy? 
Says Johnny Bull to Pat. 
Sure it's the only thing I'm wanting, 
For I 
havn't got nary a 
rap. 
They had not travelled very far, 
When a 
Scotchman, like them, out of work, 
And by his look and appearance, 
As hungry as a 
Turk. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty? 
Says bold Paddy Magee. 
I 
canna do that, says the Scotchman, 
For I 
hau'ila got nary a 
buhee. 
Ch, I 
have got a 
three-pence, 
What shall we do with that? 
• 
Buy three-pence worth of whiskey, 
'Twill cheer us up, says Pat, 
Oh dinna do that, says Scotty, 
I'll tell you what we'll do, 
Buy three-pence worth of oat meal. 
I'll make some nice bergue. 
1(1 
Oh no, we'll buy a 
loaf of bread, 
The Englishman did say, 
And in yonder hay-stack 
We'll sleep our hunger away. 
Well get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning, 
Who dreams the greatest dream. 
Now, the Englishman, by the morning, 
Ten million men had been 
For years a 
digging a 
turnip out, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip out, 
By working night and day, 
It took four million horses 
This turnip to 'aul away. 
Now the Scotchman, by the morning 
Forty million men had been 
For years a 
making a 
boiler, 
The largest ever seen. 
What was it for ? says John Bull, 
Was it make of copper or tin? 
'Twas made of copper, says Scotty, 
To boil your turnip in. 
SPOIN. —NOW comes Pat's dream. 
'Oh, sure, I've been dreaming, 
And dramed a 
pleasant dream, 
I 
drained I 
was in a 
hay- stack, 
All by a 
purling stream. 
And you and Scotty were there too, 
You were, upon my oath, 
By the powers, I 
dreamed I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and ate the loaf. 
FANCY LITTLE STEP. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by HARPER & STANSILL with great success. 
OH, we've come out to tell about a 
little love affair, 
That occurred to us as we walked out to take the evening air, 
About a 
girl we chanced to meet, such charms we can't forget, 
Our admiration was bestowed on a 
fancy little step. 
CITORTIS. 
For so easily and gracefully she did glide, 
(BREAK.) 
For that fairy I 
could have died. 
(BREAK.) 
Her head was bending low, as she gracefully on did go, 
With a 
silver pair of tassels on her high-heeled boots, and a 
charming little step. 
Bnt another fellow cut us out, he wears a 
fine moustache, 
And with his high-heeled boots and cane, oh, don't he cut a 
dash, 
He told this girl he loved her, which it really was too much, 
He walked into her affections, and we walked oft on our crutch, 
For so easily, tkc.

And the little tailor boy stole broadcloth enough 
To keep these three rogues warm, 
To keep these three rogues warm, 
To keep these three rogues warm, 
The little tailor boy stole broadcloth enough 
To keep these three rogues warm. 
The miller got drowned in his dam, 
The weaver got hung with his yarn, 
And the little tailor boy went sliding down below 
With the broadcloth under his arm, 
With the broadcloth under his arm, 
With the broadcloth under his arm, 
The little talor boy went sliding down below 
With the broadcloth under his arm. 
About three weeks after that, 
About three weeks after that, 
The little tailor boy went sliding down below

Without any crown to his hat,

The little tailor boy went sliding down below, 
We don't want any more of that.

was walking down the street, the other afternoon, 
Lit my cigar, put on my kids in front of a

watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame. 
She quickly waved her handkerchief, of course I 
did the same.

was at her side, your pardon, mi=s, said I, 
If I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but then you took my eye.

She said she had no objections, -but her parents they were poor.

I 
stepped up to her side and raised my hat, 
She blushed and hung her head; 
My heart it kept going pit- a-pat, 
I 
scarce know what I 
said. 
I 
excused myself, but then I 
must not tell,

HEART'S DELIGHT, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Answer to " If ever I 
cease to love." 
I 
sat myself down at her feet, one cold tempestuous night. 
I 
pour'd soft solder in the ears of my own clear heart's delight, 
She sighed and smiled so sweetly when my love to her I 
told, 
Tho' I 
had my linen overcoat on, but still I 
felt quite cold 
cold, 
Tho' I 
left my pocketbook on the piano, in tones I 
cried quite 
bold: 
My own, my heart's delight, my own my heart's delight, 
I'd sooner have a 
dollar right in my pocket, than go back on 
my heart's delight. 
Than go back on my heart's delight, than go back on my 
heart's delight, 
rd sooner be elected a 
congressman, than go back on my 
heart's delight. 
A 
ten cent ring was on her thumb, her horse-tail hair did 
flow, 
She had pink saucer on her cheeks, so I 
kissed her gentle 
toe, 
Hex -glass eye gazed upon me, which afforded me relief, 
She chewed her gums a 
little while, and then took out her 
teeth, teeth, 
Ahd then she cried, in tones so wild, oh list to ray belief, 
My own my heart's delight, my own my heart's delight, 
I'd sooner have v. good eye in my head, than go back on my 
heart's delight. 
2 
Than go back on my heart's delight, than go back on my 
heart's delight, 
I'd sooner be married to Duke Alex, than go back on my 
heart's delight. 
So fondly then I 
bit her ear, she kissed me on my eye. 
And then she turned a 
somersault saying, " how is that for 
high:" 
She ran down to a 
rippling stream, and her head in it she 
ducks, 
Crying, heart's delight, I'd marry you, even if you was a 
Ku 
Klux Klux. 
Oh; yes indeed, we'll married be, 
And we'll see how marriage works, and we'll see how the old 
thing works. 
My own my heart's delight, my own my heart's delight, 
I'd sooner own a 
farm in New Jersey, than go back on my 
heart's delight, 
Than go back on my heart's delight, than go back on my 
heart's delight. 
I'd sooner run my face for a good square meal, than go 
back on heart's delight, 
I'd sooner smoke old Grant's cigars, than go back on my 
heart's delight.

SWEET DORA DARE, 
Music Pubilsbed by Wm. A. Post), 547 Broadway. 
TRIPPING down the valley, skipping o'er the lea, 
Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid can be ; 
Like a 
plume of raven is the bright sheen of her hair, 
Happy as a 
little queen is my darling Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song-birds, as they sweetly sing, 
Hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring; 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hew:. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare, 
Dora with the lilies of the valley in. her hair, 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair/ 
My heart it will go pit-a-pat at sight of Dora Dare. 
All the lads are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet, 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the while. 
What has passed between us; Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again my Dora Dare will wear 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her hair.

OH! we are the stylish swells of creation, 
All others in the shade we leave, 
Our winning ways they cause a 
great sensation, 
Especially when we promenade at eve, 
The ladies sigh and say, oh !

They look so very neat, 
They are really captivating, 
When they promenade the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the ladies fair they say we look so neat,

While envious gents say our form is so complete, 
Oh, we are the stylish swells of creation, 
And our winning ways they fascinate the belles, 
Gentle sighs are often heard as we pass by them, 
'By famous, the only colored swells. 
When strolling out at eve, we're called perfection, 
By those lovely girls who chance to pass us by, 
In it they seem to take great satisfaction, 
I 
suppose it's 'cause we are timid, young and shy; 
We always smile, yes, all the while, 
For our souls they agitate, 
Those handsome, stylish, lovely girls, 
All hearts they captivate. 
Oh, the ladies fair, etc.

I 
WILL sing a 
song of nations great, 
Among them I 
Will name, 
English, Irish, German, and America, 
Though I 
hope not one of you 
Will find the least offence, 
With anything that I 
may say; 
For I 
will give to all of them, 
There own justly dues, 
Not one of them out of place will name, 
For I'm not the least bit partial, 
To any country 'neath the sun, 
But cry aloud, let them all have their rightetnit 
CHORUS. 
Then praise all of you your country, 
Your country's glorious name, 
And if you will take a 
righteous path, 
You will win a 
honored fame. 
There is dear old England, always calm, 
Who never speaks a 
word, 
Not even to praise her honored name, 
If she would only speak and tell the good she does, 
6 
Many other countries they would blush for shame, 
In honor to the men-of-war that's in her navy yard, 
a 
most wonderful sight to be seen; 
Then let us give her credit, 
For the noble work she's done. 
And all say, God save the Queen. 
Then praise all of you, etc. 
Now there's our.German country, 
Who's deserving of great praise, 
With her noble King William at their head, 
Althoughhe was victorious in the recent Prussian war, 
He's mourning now the blood his country shed, 
Let us hope that he may never have cause to fight again, 
To lose the useful men that they have raised, 
But let each brotherly country together hand in hand, 
And each sing aloud the other's praise. 
Then praise all of you, etc. 
Now there is dear old Ireland, 
Which is next upon my list, 
Who for long has been opposed to he own right, 
But she will not beg for mercy, 
If she thought it would be granted; 
She will wait till she is strong enough to fight. 
For old Ireland is the mother of many honest hearts, 
And every day more are growing in the land, 
Then why, if she can help it, should she be trod upon, 
For bold hearts are often found in Irishmen, 
:1 7 
CHORUS: 
Old Ireland has suffered, 
But soon will cry for glee, 
For the tithe is quickly drawing near, 
When old Ireland shall be free. 
Now there's another country, 
She's the greatest ot them all, 
America, where Freedom never dies, 
F;he's the mother of invention, 
Her productions they are greatest, 
(Many country ' neath the skies, 
She's a 
refuge for all nations of every land and clime, 
But of this pray don't thin:: we boast, 
We only ask you to remember how America has su:ierei 
For the lives to win this Freedom that was lost. 
CHORUS. 
Then who deserves this honor, 
Why, our noble Washington, 
For he's Father of the greatest country 
That e'er the sun shone on.

WHEN I'm far away from our fond village home, 
In countries way over the sea, 
Remember me darling, and do not forget, 
Irene to write often to me: 
You'll tell me how baby is getting along, 
And how he's growing the while, 
For then I 
can't dandle the duck on my knee, 
Cr look at his cunning sweet smile. 
Cllones. 
Write to me often, Irene darling, do, 
When I'm far away over the sea, 
For I'll be thinking, Irene dear, of you, 
So Irene do write often to me. 
When snow's of bleak winter has mantled the earth, 
And everything's dreary and sad, 
You'll write to me, Irene, I 
hope dearest one, 
Epistles to make my heart glad, 
You'll tell me baby has cut his wee teeth, 
And when he commences to walk, 
And Irene, remember, to write me the day, - 
You first hear the dear chimp talk. 
When birds in calm summer are singing their songs, 
And lillies bloom fresh in the vale, 
Forget me not, Irene, but think of the ship, 
On which your dear husband does sail. 
It may be long years ere my steps I 
retrace, 
To you and our fond village home, 
But write to me often Irene darling do, 
No matter where ere I 
may roam.

called again next evening to see my Jenny dear. 
She met me at the front door I 
thought that she looked queer 
She told me that her cousin had called to spend the eve, 
And consequently for his sake no callers she'd receive, 
Won't you ever tumble, &c. 
I 
went right home that very night my peu in hand did take, 
To ask her if she would tell me why to me she'd give the 
shake. 
I 
asked her to forget, forgive, and all that kind of trash,

lived no other girl I'd mash.

Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she said, 
Don't ask me now to wed, 
What would the people say, 
If we should run away? 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
She talk'd on useless matters. 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a woman clatters, 
When silent she should be, 
I 
begg'd her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me, 
My love WU 
all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said. 
Oh, aint you awful

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away, 
But, my darling, you will be, will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes, my darling, you will be, 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to-day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes, my darling, mine alone 
Yu have never older grown 
Darling, T

Love can never more grow old, 
Locks may lose their Drown and gold; 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, • 
But the hearts that love will know, 
Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is sliver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
since I 
kissed you, mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

And in the splendid four pair back,

Such a

Round she goes on her darling toes, 
Round on her tootsey wootsies, 
You should hear me cry, encore! 
That's the girl what I 
adore, 
My love She's honest, tho' she's poor, 
And all the world to me. 
At night she dances on the singe. 
In white and golden spangle, 
But in the daytime helps her " Mar," 
To turn the ancient mangle; 
At night, swells with their opera glees, 
Her fair form (to acimim.

'Tis pleasant on a 
summer night, 
I 
think you won't deny, 
When stars. like wicked laughing eyes, 
Are winking in the sky ; 
With sonic one by your side w:iose eyes 
Are brhda as any star, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
Enjoying your cigar. 
CHORUS. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, 
Smokin ,, a 
cigar. 
Talkine- to a 
pretty girl, 
Heedless of her pa; 
Though some may like to strut about, 
I 
like it better far, 
Leaning on a 
balcony 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
You'rc glad to leave the crowded room, 
And if the night be fair, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
To get a 
breath of air; 
And if you've some one by your side, 
She won't take it amiss, 
If, in a 
quiet sort of way, 
You steal a 
little kiss. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, etc. 
When curtains screen you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop the question qu4tly, 
What better place can be 
The coldest- hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
Have never Proved unkind. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, etc.

Wand'ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me,

Roaming by the streamlet tide? 
Where I 
whispered as I 
kissed thee. 
You were more than all beside?

Bring again those happy days, 
With th:i never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ?

I

Ai the day I

Yes, our locks may lose their gold, 
And our faces, too, grow old. 
But our hearts will be the same, 
Naught can dim love's holy flame. 
We have journeyed on in life, 
Side by side, through storm and strife, 
Still together, hand in band, 
Seek we now another land. 
While the silver tints the gold, etc. 
Let us down life's sunny slope, 
Wander with the blissful hope, 
That when shadows ' round us creep,

Sleep to know no pain or care, 
We shall meet just over there, 
By the shining gates of gold, 
Where our faces ne'er grow old,

THE GAY MASQUERADE. 
Sung by ELLA W INNER. 
SOME like garden parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spooning, just " under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weakness, I 
fear, is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pretty darlings In costume arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Some dances are like Quakers' meetings in style, 
So " starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smiles 
But to do as one likes without feeling afraid, 
By jove the right place is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the dear masquerade, 
With sweet " tootsie wootsies" so sweetly arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' tis the easiest:task, 
To FOMO elegant creature whilst wearing a 
mask; 
Oh the tales I 
have told, and the vows I 
have made— 
There's no place for flirting like the gay masquerade, 
56 
CHOB178. 
rm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With dear " popsy wopsies," so gaily arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Each lady that's masked, for " a 
beauty," don't take 
If you do then, " that's where you will make a 
mistake," 
Some darling old spinsters you'll oft find arrayed, 
Who are fishing for flats at the gay masquerade,

As sung by James McCale, the English comic. 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rcsy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown 
hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved ray Nelly beats them all. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle; 
Nelly Ray, like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Kelly Ray. 
CHORUS. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met ray Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, etc. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright, green grass, 
And words of love, I 
whispered to this young country lass; 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
aat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged ::c 
be my bride. 
Nelly Ray, Nolly nay, etc. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy we 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the heads of her or me; 
But in our farmhouse we'll be happy night and day. 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray.

OH! have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the sumir .l. 
zNiher smile would set you crazy, 
With hair and eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd tremble with delight, 
And deem it all an honor— 
Her sweet fat, Mushing 
Oh! you should see my pretty little Jessie, 
Her beauty shames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
CHORUS. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancing, 
Oh! may the joy of life forever bless thee, 
Lovely queen of every rose, 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop in the rose-bud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes; 
Oh who would dare to crush her 
A 
sweet and tender flower, 
60 
And who would dare to hush her, 
While singing in her bower, • 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song. 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd sit there all day long. 
My heart, &c, 
I 
tometimes think that I 
am going -crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white-cap daisy, 
Its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is theirfriend. 
This evening her and I 
were in the garden— 
When I 
my suite did press; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She blushingly answered, yes. 
My heart, &c.

; . 
It is the Fac-simile of a 
Trick practised by al,4 
the Professors Of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leadiug Journal saw, of it: 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order has 
been sent us called HIIMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportunity ior a decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture-
book 
yly printed and colored, it is so bound that a 
prac-
tised manipulntor taking it up and flirtinv the leaves rapidly 
over, can mahc t 
appear to be filled with copies of only one 
picture, or with blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
suc-
cession of figures. 
One minute the pmiphlet, quickly thumb-
ed, appears to contain nothing but the portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit : the next, only Columbine , 
then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. 
A 
little practice, and the direc:ions printed with the book will 
make anybody at home in the handling of it."—Phila. Even-

The New

A / ittle book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
aS we think it would only encourage the bad hr bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
2.5 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
t 
lonable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to Our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.
