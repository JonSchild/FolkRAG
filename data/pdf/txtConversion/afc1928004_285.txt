TAKE this letter to my mother, 
Far across the deep blue sea, 
It will fill her heart with pleasure,

How she wept when last we parted, 
How her heart was filled with pain, 
When she said, " Good-bye, God bless you; 
We may never meet again."

And ere long I'll turn my footsteps 
Back towards my dear old home.

Mich. 
Price 40 cents. 
OH, soon o'er the seas I'll be sailing, 
Perhaps ne'er to meet you again! 
Your love in my soul lives unfailing, 
And blossoms in sunlight and rain ; 
For my thoughts will be always about you, 
Wherever I 
chance, love, to stray; 
Tell me, darling, I 
never may doubt you, 
Be true to me while I'm away ! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, my thought will be always about you, 
Wherever I

Be true to me while I'm away ! 
Oh, how can I 
ever forget you, 
And dear days of long, long ago ? 
I 
bless the sweet hour when I 
met you, 
Your cheeks were like roses in snow ! 
In the land where my footsteps are going, 
I'll d:eam of you, love, night-and day ; 
Will you ever, your fond love bestowing, 
Be true to me while I'm away 
Yes, my thought, etc. 
I'll think of your kindness each morrow, 
Your eyes are the stars of my night 
I'll think of you love in my sorrow, 
I'll think of you in my delight ! 
Tell me, darling, for soon we must sever, 
I 
bless your sweet lips while they say, 
That your heart will " forever and ever 
Be true to me while I'm away !" 
Yes, my thought, etc. 
GATHERING SHELLS FROM THE SEA 
SHORE. 
Words and Music by W ILL L. 
THOMPSON. 
The Music of this song is published by W ILL L. 
THOMPSON & CO., East 
Liverpool, Ohio. 
Price 40 cents. 
I 
WANDER ID 
to-day on the sea shore, 
The winds and the waves were low, 
And I 
thought of the days that are gone, Maud, 
Many long years ago; 
! 
those were the happiest days of all, Maud, 
Not a 
care nor a 
sorrow did we know, 
As we played on the white pebbled sand, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
CHORUS. 
Gathering up the shells from the sea shore, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore; 
Ah! those were the happiest days of all, Maud, 
• 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Oh, don't you remember the day, Maud, 
The last time we wander'd on the shore, 
Our hearts were so joyous and gay, Maud, 
For you promised to be mine evermore; 
Then the shells they were whiter than ever, 
And the bright waves were lovelier than before, 
The hours were but moments to us, Maud. 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc. 
But now we are growing up in years, Maud, 
Our locks are all silver'd and gray, 
Yet the vows that we made on the shore, Maud, 
Are fresh in our merniries to- day ; 
There still is a 
charm in those bright shells 
And the sound of the deep ocean's roar, 
For they call back the days that we spent, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc.

VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW. 
By W. II. DELEHANTY. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The sun had just gone down, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town ; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye- lashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, (Symp.) 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A dreamy, soft expression, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner there I 
found. 
CHORUS. 
She deigned to smile upon me, 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A dreamy, soft expression, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She, blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh, I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
(symp.) 
VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW.—Concluded. 
So arm in arm we wandered, (Synzp.) 
Yes, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A dreamy, soft expression, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
THERE'S. MAGIC IN A KISS. 
IN 
life there's nothing sweeter 
Than to have, or be, a 
beau; 
It's nice to love a 
pretty girl, 
And that we all well know ; 
Now I 
have found a 
sweetheart.. 
A charming little Miss, 
And that is how I 
came to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
CHORUS. 
For she's my little fairy, (Break) 
So beautiful and airy, 
Break) 
My heart is captivated 
By a 
charming little Miss, 
And that is how I 
came to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss. (Dance.) 
Now when two lovers quarrel 
They sit and pout awhile, 
Until one or the other will 
Provoke a 
winning smile ; 
The makrig up's delightful, 
'Tis full of joy and bliss, 
He clasps her in his arms, and then 
There's magic in a 
kiss. 
For she's, etc. 
SWEET ALEEN. 
By T. M. HENGLER. 
I 
Am waiting here to-night, 
Sweet Aleen, 
To see my heart's delight, 
Dear Aleen; 
As I 
linger at the gate 
Tell me what may be my fate, 
I 
your answer will await, 
Sweet Aleen. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Aleen, (Symp.) dear Aleen, (Symp.) 
Whisper softly, tell me truly, 
Thou art mine; 
Sweet Aleen, (Symp.) dear Aleen, (Symp.) 
Whisper softly, tell me truly, 
Thou art mine. 
If you love me answer yes, 
Sweet Aleen, 
Half your answer I 
can guess, 
Dear Aleen; 
Fairest, sweetest, dearest love,' 
Like an angel from above, 
Let me vow to you my love, 
Sweet Alen. 
Sweet Aleen, etc. 
Days may come, and days may go, 
Sweet Aleen, 
I 
shall ever love you so. 
Dear Aleen, 
You'll e'er find me fond and true, 
Believe my inner soul, 0 
do, 
My life I 
freely yield to you, 
Sweet Aleen. 
Sweet Aleen, etc. 
WATCHING. 
DESCRIPTIVE SONG FOR TENOR OP. 
SOPRANO . 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by HARRISON MILLARD. 
The music of this song ls published by Wm. A. POND & 
Co., 547 Broadway, 
New York. Price 50 cents. 
OH, weeping eyes that watch in vain 
Thro' weary hours of care! 
Oh, hearts that long to meet again, 
Yet pine in dark despair! 
Alone ! alone! the stars look down 
In pity from above; 
The night bird calls, the teardrop falls, 
Watching for those we love, 
Watching for those we love! 
Gay plumes were dancing in the sun, 
The onward march had just begun; 
"Farewell! farewell! my darling one, 
Farewell! farewell! my darling one, 
Ill soon come back, 
I'll soon come back to thee !" 
" 
Oh, keep this little rose," she said, 
" 
Oh, keep this little rose, " she said, 
And on his shoulder bow'd her head, 
And on his shoulder bow'd her head: 
" 
What tho' its bloom will soon be fled ! 
Oh, still remember me, 
01), still, oh, still remember me !" 
" 
My heart, my heart will e'er be true!" 
The gallant ranks were lost to view; 
But still a 
white hand wed adieu, 
Upon that daisied lea, 
Upon that daisied lea. 
The moon streams on her window pane ; 
A 
soldier lies at rest 
Upon the far off battle plain, 
A 
red rose on his breast! 
The night winds sigh " Alone! alone!" 
The stars watch from above, 
Oh, hearts that break, so weary grown, 
Watching for those they love, 
For those they love, for those they love, 
Watching alone, watching alone, 
For those they love, alone, 
For those they love, for those they love

MOTHER, IS THE OLD HOME LONELY?" 
Words by ARTHUR W .

Music by CHARLES D. 
BLAKE. 
The Music of this song is published by Wu. A. POND Sr Co., 547 Broadway,

Price 40 cents. 
MoTnEn, is the old home lonely, 
With no children left you there, 
And no one to guard thee only 
him who hears the humblest pray'r 7 
Do you miss the many faces, 
Miss their love- kiss on thy brow, 
Loving hearts and warm embraces, 
Is the old home lonely now 7 
cuonus. 
Is the old home lonely, mother ? 
Lonely to you night and day ? 
With your children, one another, 
Wandering so far away. 
Mother, is the old home lonely, 
With no voices hush'd in pray'r, 
And no little footsteps only 
Making music ev'rywhere 
Happy hearts that lived to cheer you, 
And your cup of bliss tc fill, 
They may never linger near you. 
Is the old home lonely now ? 
Is the old home, etc. 
Mother, is the old home : onely, 
As you think of other days, 
When kind hearts around thee only 
Linger'd still to speak thy praise? 
You are growing old and weary, 
Marks of sorrow on your brow; 
And the days must be so dreary. 
Is the old home lonely now 7 
Is the old home, et.:.

JUST TOUCH THE HARP GENTLY, MY 
PRETTY LOUISE. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cottage. 
As the curtain rises the symphony of the 
song is played very softly.] 
[Enter CHARLES; he looks inquiringly around him, and 
'when he sees the cottage expresses delight.] 
CHARLES.—'Tis the place at last! 
Oh, what a flood of 
pleasant memories rush upon me at this moment. 
There's 
the little garden where so often we have walked in happier 
days. 
Yonder is the green, shady lane, and the little white 
church on the hill. 
There is her window; and far away I 
see the soft glimmer of the stream, by which we used to stray 
and dream of the bright future that we deemed was hi store 
for us. 
I 
wonder if she has forgotten me? They say that ab-
sence conquers love, and I 
have been away over the sea for the 
last five years. 
How well I 
remember the little parlor where 
we used to sit and chat in the lovely twilight. 
Then those lily 
fingers of hers used to fly over the strings of her harp, as she 
woke the sweet strains that I 
never can forget while life shall 
last. 
There seems to be no one at home. 
Even the birds are 
quiet. 
What would I 
not give to hear that touch upon the 
harp once more. 
It would tell me that I 
was not forgotten. 
[The symphony of the song is again played. CHARLES conies 
forward and sings.] 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when together we sat 
On the porch ' neath the nest of' the dove. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
It brings fond recollections to me; 
You remember the mocking-bird mimicked it once, 
As it perched on the sycamore tree. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise, etc.

CHARLES listens attentively.]

They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
For each song that she sang, your pretty Louise, 
E'en now she remembers them well, 
For though we've been parted, they've lived in her heart, 
And sweet is the love that they tell!

On, Mister, why don't you stop selling your rum 
To poor, shiftless fathers like mine, 
Who spend in your shop all the money tney get 
For poisonous whiskey and wine 7 
My mother has nothing that's decent to wear, 
And sister is crying for bread, 
While father is lying dead drunk on the floor, 
With bruises all over his head. 
CHORES. 
Oh, Mister, why don't you stop selling your rum 
To poor, shiftless fathers like mine, 
Who spend in your shop all the money they earn, 
For poisonous whiskey and wine ? 
Oh, Mister, the stuff that is sold at your bar 
To those who are given to drink, 
Is certainly death to the ones that partake, 
And thousands are now on the brink ; 
My father was happy when doing his work, 
And making three dollars a 
day, 
But now he is down in the world, and he says 
You whiskey has led him astray. 
Oh, Mister, etc. 
Oh, Mister, please don't give my pa any more 
To make him so wretched and wild, 
For when he's in liquor he's maddened with rage, 
And threatens his wife and his child; 
This life is a 
burden to mother and I, 
When father is off on a 
spree, 
So, Mister, please don't let him have any more, 
'Twill be such a 
kindness to me. 
Oh, Mister, etc.

Evermore, " God bless our home!" 
When the gloomy night is falling, 
And my weary heart is sad, 
Sweetest voices then are calling, 
Making music pure and glad; 
Oh, they charm away my sorrow, 
Smooth my path where'er I 
roam; 
Not one cloud can dim the morrow 
While I 
sing, " God bless our home !" 
Bless our home, etc. 
There the dearest joys are biding, 
There is heav'n on earth for me; 
While the sands of life are gliding, 
Sweetest blessings there I

May those blessings live forever, 
Keep the wolf from out the door, 
Welcome be each friend, and never 
May our hearts forget the poor.

But satisfaction yet I'll have,

Good evening, little love,

S:Gli for my dear little cottage again, 
Its pretty surroundings, and wide spread domain, 
The sweet purple clover, the daisy field fair, 
The meadow and streamlet, the pure healthy air; 
How happy the days of the long, long ago, 
When hearts were so merry they cared not for woe, 
And all in the village were joyous and free, 
Oh. give it, yes, give it, that cottage to me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, give me, yes, give me, the meadow and plain, 
And give me, I 
pray thee, my cottage again; 
I 
sigh for that meek little cottage once more, 
Oh, could I, oh could I 
but knock at its door. 
I 
sigh for my dear little cottage again, 
The shady oak forest, the long winding lane, 
The bright scented roses, the lilacs and pink, 
The call of the robin and fond bobolink ; 
How gayly and quickly the hours passed away, 
And each rolling sun brought a 
bright sunny day, 
While down in the pasture and far o'er the hill 
We heard the sweet music that came from the rill. 
Oh, give me, etc. 
I 
sigh for my dear little cottage again, 
Its old slanted roof and its fixtures so plain, 
The close clinging ivy, the fast running vine, 
And ev'ry thing else that about it did twine; 
Oh, could I 
but see it, the home of my youth, 
The place where dear mother first taught me truth, 
Oh, could I 
go back ' ilea th its shelter again, 
And play on the clover and daisy domain. 
Oh, give me, etc.

That build in the old cherry tree; 
How sweetly they're singing, dear mother, 
And look at that pretty red breast, 
how careful she watches the young ones 
Asleep in the little brown nest. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what are the little birds saying, dear mother, 
While chirping and singing the while ? 
Please tell me, I'm anxious to know, mother, 
So tell me, your little sick child. 
Dear mother, just list to the blue jay, 
How funny it calls to its mate, 
And yonder, the proud looking sparrow 
Is perched on the bar of the gate. 
Far up in the air, the swift swallow 
Goes (lodging about life a 
kite, 
And still farther up is the blackbird, 
Why, mother, ' tis near out of sight. 
Oh, what, etc. 
Now, mother, please let down the window, 
And tell me if birds that fly high, 
Will reach the bright gold gates of heaven, 
Far, far away up in the sky; 
Soon, mother, your darlino- will be there,

As it points to baby's cradle, 
Ere she leaves this sinful land;

THEY were brought to my bedside at bright early morn, 
Just three little violets plucked from her grave; 
Their tiny blue leaves were unfolded at dawn, 
Ere the wind caused the grass in the meadows to wave; 
How simple they were—but a 
story they told 
Of the days long ago when we walked arm-in- arm, 
And vowed one another, with hearts never cold, 
To always be happy and ne'er inflict harm. 
CHORUS. 
Just three little violets plucked from her grave; 
How I 
love them for Hattie, who left long ago; 
They blootn'cl ere the winds caused the green grass to wave. 
Oh, little blue beauties, I 
do love you so. 
But she left me in springtime; I 
ne'er shall forget 
The cold parting kisses she placed on my cheek; 
They called her to heaven, but still I 
regret 
That she left me so soon, although feeble and weak ; 
She said she was ready the voyage to take, 
For she'd prayed to the Saviour her poor soul to save; 
So now I 
will kiss them for poor Hattie's sake, 
These three little violets plucked from her grave.

Yes, I'll meet thee at the elder near the tree, 
For your heart to me is so true, I

As in springtime when we used to cross the lea; 
The pale moon so full and swelling, it will light you from your

So remember, Mattie dearest, meet me there, 
And a 
shower of loving kisses will help constitute our blisses, 
While I 
nestle buds of roses in your hair.

When the whippoorwill is calling whippoorwill, 
When the stars begin to twinkle and the dews begin to sprinkle, 
I 
will meet thee at the call of whippoorwill (
whippoorwill, 
whippoorwill). 
When the whippoorwill is calling, and the dew is softly falling, 
I 
will press thee to my bosom, Mattie dear, 
For your flowing golden tresses and your loving, warm caresses, 
I 
do cherish so and long to have them near; 
Then the tiny stars will twinkle, and the dew the grass will 
sprinkle, 
While the fire- fl)- shows at intervals its light; 
So remember, Mattie darling, when the whippoorwill is calling, 
You must meet me with your smiling face so bright.

JANET'S CHOICE.-Concluded. 
So the Laird may marry the Lady, 
The Lady of high degree, 
And jewels so fair she may twine in her hair, 
They are better for her than me; 
And gaily I'll dance at the bridal, 
I'll merrily dance on the lea, 
With Susan, and Alice, and Emma, 
But Donald shall dance with me! 
And I 
will marry, & c. 
So the Laird he married the Lady, 
The Lady of high degree, 
And the lowland lassie he lov'd so well 
Abode in her own country; 
For oh! where would my heart be, 
Was ever her constant cry, 
If ever I'd dared to marry the Laird ? 
Why, Donald would surely die! 
So I 
will marry, &c.

SWEET ROSE OF YARROW. 
The morning broke in blushes o'er me, 
As up in the sunny hill I 
strayed; 
A 
beauteous girl I 
saw before me, 
And thus I 
spoke the lovely maid: 
Sweet maid, and whither dost thou rove ? 
Thine eye is Cupid's piercing arrow, 
Thy name I 
prithee tell me, love?' 
She said, 
They call me Rose of Yarrow.' 
Be mine, dear maid, and fondly I'll cherish 
Those blooming charms have won my heart, 
For sooner, dearest, would I 
perish, 
Than any pang to thee impart.' 
She blush'd consent; the village peal 
Rang for our nuptials on the morrow, 
And bless'd contented do I 
feel, 
Possess'd of her, sweet Rose of Yarrow.

If all the love is true

Those pretty eyes of blue ?

Beside that fittle streamlet, love, 
We've often met before, 
And kisses that I 
gave you there 
Are numbered by the score; 
You said that they were very sweet,

But, Effie, you must tell me more

His eyes grew bright with gladness, 
His cheeks were all aglow 
The eve I 
call'd him to me 
And said, " hove you so ; " 
His head dropp'd on my shoulder, 
He pressed his lips to mine, 
And said, " Forever, dearest, 
Forever I 
am thine." 
CHORUS. 
His eyes grew bright with gladness 
When told I 
loved him so, 
But mine were dull with sadness 
That evening long ago. 
'Twas in the cheerful summer 
We talked of future bliss, 
And ' neath the spreading maple 
I 
took his loving kiss; 
I 
told him that I 
never, 
I 
never would deceive, 
And that I 
ne'er should vex him, 
Or any way agrieve.

But false to him I've proven, 
Tho' he was true to me, 
And weli I

No more my fond caresses 
Of happy long ago 
Will flil his eyes with gladness, 
For I've deceived him so.

SOFTLY fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mantled earth of white, 
Casting lines of sweet reflection 
Though the breezy winter's night; 
Dancing thro' the leafless forests, 
Shining on the frozen stream, 
Climbing up and down the hillside, 
Making shadows on the gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mantled earth of white, 
Casting lines of sweet reflection 
Thro' the breezy winter's night. 
Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the harden'd crust of snow, 
Chasing gems of sparkling beauty 
In the valleys far below; 
Hopping o'er the lifeless bushes, 
Glist'ning on the village spires, 
Tripping o'er the glens and hedges, 
Waltzing round the woodman's fires. 
Softly fall,

Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mountain tops around, 
Making pictures of the shrubb'ry

crystal of the oround; 
Skipping o'er the grassless meadow, 
Prancing up and down the lea, 
Throwing light upon my window, 
Silvery moonbeams dear to me.

With June's most lovely roses,

Would see me on the ocean, 
And that she must not pine away,

But it was more than she could bear, 
She would not hold her fears, 
While I 
so fondly then and there 
Would kiss away her tears.

IT IS NOT THE TEAR AT THIS MOMENT SHED. 
By THOMAS Moonn 
AIR,—" 
The Sixpence.” 
It is not the tear at this moment shed, 
When the cold turf has just been laid o'er him; 
That can tell how beloved is the friend that's fled, 
And how deep in our hearts we deplore him. 
'Tis the tear, through many a 
long day wept, 
Through a 
life by his loss all shaded; 
'Tis the sad remembrance fondly kept, 
When all other griefs have faded. 
And thus shall we mourn, and his memory's light, 
As it shines through our hearts, shall improve them; 
And worth shall seem fairer and truth more bright, 
When we think how he lived but to love them. 
And as buried saints the grave perfume, 
Where fadeless they've lowg been lying, 
So our hearts shall borrow a 
sweetening bloom, 
From the image he left there in dying.

LOSE and cheerless is the household, 
That so merry used to be, 
When she'd climb up to our shoulder, 
Or was dandled on our knee; 
But the little one has left us, 
Left us in her childish bloom, 
And her little form is resting 
In the dark and dismal tomb. 
CHORUS. 
All is cheerless here without her, 
happy days with us are o'er, 
For our little one has left us, 
Left us to return no more. 
Oft the little dear would tell us 
In a 
lisping kind of way 
All about the pretty angels 
Coming to her bed one day; 
Little did we think that vision 
Of our darling near at hand, 
Or that she so soon would leave us 
With that pretty angel band. 
All is, etc. 
On the shelf her cunning dresses 
Lie beside her little toys, 
Which together with a 
dollie 
Were our little darling's joys; 
How we miss the merry laughter, 
And the pretty lisping tongue, 
Of the little one that left us, 
Left us innocent and young. 
All is, etc.

For papa's voice I

hear 
Upon the ocean deep; 
He cries for help, or he will sink, 
lie calls for you and me, 
Oh, mamma, why did papa go 
So far away at sea 
Come, darling, etc. 
Your papa went because, my child, 
his duty called him there; 
So let us now for his return 
Together make a 
prayer; 
That vision, love, is rather strange, 
I 
cannot think him dead ; 
So now lie down, my petty one, 
And rest your little head.

As they caper round about you,

But they all are sure to chatter, 
Dance me, papa, on yom knee.

There is nothing that is dearer 
Than the little ones so free, 
As they chatter all together, 
Dance me, papa, on your knee.

Of the children whom we love, 
As they rally all together, 
Cooing like the spotless dove 1 
One vill spy a

That the others do not see, 
But they all seem to remember, 
Dance me, papa, on your knee.

Of our little boys and girls, 
As they climb and clamor round us, 
Tossing heads of golden curls ? 
And at eve, e'er sleep o'ercomes them, 
Then we love their merry glee, 
Though their tireless tongues are saying, 
Dance me. papa, on your knee.

Hum, my little darling, hush thee,

Will to-night bring home some bread ; 
Hard he's labored in the fact'ry,

And, to make it more distressing, 
All the mills have closed to-day.

Hush, my little darling, hush thee, 
Check your hunger for awhile, 
Try to bear the burden lightly— 
Substitute for tears a 
smile ; 
Do not let your courage falter, 
For I've heard your papa say, 
That his darling should not suffer, 
Though the mills have closed to-day. 
Hush, my little darling, etc.

Try and do the best you can,

Another, you're lazy and fat, 
And one of the boys says, dear papa,

Tut robin was singing a 
song in the tree, 
The blue birds were twittering near, 
The linnet re-echoed a 
beautiful glee, 
In notes that were mellow and clear; 
The dew- laden daisies just over the lea 
Had a 
hiss from the radiant sun, 
When Jamie, my lover, came over to me 
And brightened the heart he had won. 
My Jamie was telling a 
tale of the sea, 
his voyage to glittering lands, 
The changes in life since my sailor and me 
First 0
.rasp'd one another's brown hands ; 
He told of the fields and the hills far away, 
The skies he had seen in the West, 
When closer I 
drew to his sailor array 
And rested my head on his breast. 
The ocean may rumble and roar on its way, 
The beacon its fluttering make. 
The vessels may dance in the foam and the spray, 
And billows may thunder and break ; 
Tho others may sigh for a 
life on the sea, 
A 
home on the racing abyss, 
My Jamie will never more wander from me, 
My heart is now wedded to his.
