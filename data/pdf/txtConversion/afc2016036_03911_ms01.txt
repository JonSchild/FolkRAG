[0:00] Introduction to Paul Lemieux, he explains his family history, how he got started in 
welding, and how he started his company Blue Fleet Welding Services. Paul describes the strike 
at Hathaway’s and how it helped lead to him starting his own business. 
[5:10] Paul describes the work he did during the fishermen’s strike in the late 1980s, his positive 
memories of working for Hathaway Machinery right out of high school and learning from the 
older workers there. He explains the positive and negative aspects of working with family. 
[9:59] Paul summarizes the different kinds of jobs that Blue Fleet Welding Services does, how 
many people he employs and their roles, and the time commitment that having his own business 
requires. He also describes what the busy summer season is like, and the importance of keeping 
up with paperwork. 
[15:03] Paul explains the work he does for scallop boats in Maine during the summer, and the 
intricate regulations for scallopers in the state of Maine. He shares his newfound love for skiing 
in the slower winter months and explains how chemicals (oxygen, acetylene, argon, and propane) 
are used in various types of welding, including arc, mig, and tig welding. 
[20:04] Paul describes the work that is done in his shop versus what is done directly on the boats, 
fishermen doing their own welding repair work, and his favorite aspect of his job: crane work. 
Paul describes how he uses the crane truck and repairing dredges. Paul explains the various tools 
he uses in welding, and the influence of Leo Tuttle on welding in New Bedford. 
[25:10] Paul explains how all of the companies associated with the fishing industry in New 
Bedford have been consolidated over the years and are being bought up by Wall Street 
companies for hundreds of millions of dollars, how commercial fishing license allocation has 
changed, and the effect of the consolidation of fishing boats on shore side businesses like his. 
[30:07] Paul describes how he’s been able to stay in business, other welders that are going out of 
business, and the ability to make money on the waterfront if someone is driven enough and 
works hard enough. He describes the change in the waterfront from a place with a sense of 
community, to an industry that feels more corporate, and how he tries to keep his workers 
employed even when work is unsteady. 
[35:14] Paul explains how he likes to run his company to create a positive work environment for 
his employees, jargon used in the company, hiring his right-hand-man Sal and Sal’s background 
and skills. 
[40:00] Paul describes accidents that have happened while welding fuel tanks, the different 
places they’ve sold dredges to, how dredge styles have changed. 
[45:38] Paul explains how other shore side and fishing companies try to expand into welding 
unsuccessfully.

Laura Orleans: Today is June 28th in the year 2017. This is an interview for the New Bedford 
Fishing Heritage Center, funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of Congress. 
As part of this project we are interviewing shore side workers in the New Bedford/Fairhaven 
fishing industry to record their stories, document their skills and knowledge, and better 
understand their important role in the fishing industry. The recording and transcript will become 
part of the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. I am Laura Orleans, and today I am 
speaking with Paul Lemieux at Blue Fleet Welding? 
Paul Lemieux: Service, yup. 
LO: Service. Um, and ifs about 1:30 in the afternoon. 
PL: Correct. 
LO: Okay. So even though we just, oh, and even though you just signed that paper, do you give 
us permission to record your story for this project? 
PL: Yes, I do. 
LO: And if you would just please introduce yourself 
PL: My name is Paul Lemieux. 
LO: And what is your job in the fishing industry? 
PL: I am, let me introduce myself a little bit more so you know. I am third generation Canadian- 
American. My grandfather came here, not by the boat but by the train. And he started his own 
business which my father and his brothers went into their own business. And he had seven 
children and they were French Catholic, they all had large families. So the next generation had 
eleven, eleven, seven, six; so that business couldn't support all the next generation, so the third 
generation started splintering out, and I wasn't the oldest of the, of my family, so I figured my 
best shot was to go out on my own and find another business. And what brought me to the 
fishing industry was, is I went to Vocational to learn to be a welder, because my grandfather was 
in the plumbing business and heating business... Is it working? 
LO: Ifs working fine, I just want to make sure that when you move your arm like... 
PL: Okay. 
LO: ...the cord... 
PL: So don't move the arm. 
LO: Sorry. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017

PL: Okay. 
LO: You're fine. 
PL: Yup. 
LO: Okay. Go ahead. So the plumbing and heating business. 
PL: So he was in the plumbing and heating business and they used to have a welder come in and 
do some of their welding. And it looked interesting, so I went to Vocational for welding and in a 
strange twist of fate, the uh, when I graduated they got me a job over at Aerovox and the fore-, 
the superintendent came back and said, "Listen, Paul. This is a better job over here at Hathaway 
Machinery." And I chose that job and I worked ten years there, and wanting to start my own 
business I finally got the gumption and the determination and went for it. I figured it's all or 
nothing. I had four kids at the time and a mortgage, but I had experience and gumption. 
LO: So tell me, so when was that that you started this business? 
PL: Uh, 1984, '85. It's the winter, I started in '84 but didn't really get into business until the 
February of'85, so technically I started the business in 1985. 
LO: So right before the big strike that I've heard so much about. 
PL: Exactly. Which it was one of the benefits for me, and a problem. 
LO: So talk to me about that; it's sort of off-topic. 
PL: Okay well let me go to the first story first... 
LO: Okay. 
PL: ...before I get to the second one. So I worked at Hathaway's, and I worked my way up to the 
top; I had a wife, I had four kids and come from a family of workers, lot of overtime, things were 
going good and a twist of fate happened over here. They got into a big strike. But a week before 
we went on strike, they gave me the boss's position, but I had to get out of the union. The strike 
lasted for 50 weeks. It left a lot of business, uh, bitterness between employees that were friends 
and... I left before they voted to strike, but I left, to weeks become boss, but a lot of people didn't 
see it that way. They see me jumping ship. Of course, I was the enemy along with, and then 
Hathaway's and Brayley's had to bring back the Hathaway’s for the voting struggle. Long story 
short, they brought in some of the owners back, they made me the boss. I mean, they made one 
of them the boss of me. Which, that was a time to leave, because they made me boss, I lost all of 
my friends who were fellow employees, and then the minute the strike was done they hired one 
of the former owners who made- So, that's enough. That was the first fate. Within a year that 
place went out of business. And they told me it would never go out of business, they were so 
high and mighty... 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
5 
LO: There was a fire, correct? 
PL: There was a fire, but there was a few lawsuits. The fire was one of the last punches. There 
was a lawsuit where they lost, a guy lost his arm when he was picking up rope on the winch, 
never mind that they notified the guy had to be updated, never mind that it went to another 
company that they worked on the winch, never mind, never mind, never mind. Long story short, 
they lost. Lost their insurance, had to fire, lost another lawsuit, went out of business. They went 
out of business was when scalloping was on an uptick. At the same time I left. If I had left six 
months later, all that work that they lost would have went to someone else who was already 
established. 
[5:09] 
LO: I understand, yeah. 
PL: Right? Fate. So then when the strike came, that got a little ugly, but I had a couple of big 
projects and I was a little guy... 
LO: And we're talking now about the fishermen's strike. 
PL: The fishermen's strike, right. So now move on, so I'm in business I think maybe about a half 
a dozen years. I'm just. I'm a small, small guy but I'm, so now it kind of shut down the industry 
but it was a couple of small guys that were using me to rebuild their boat. So while the strike 
went on I had this big project. Now first crossing the picket line it was tough, because they 
wanted to shut everybody down, but as the strike went on the guys realized hey, listen, when the 
strike ends, there again these fishermen are friends, I say listen, when the strike ends you're 
going to want that boat to go fishing. You got another year to go to fix it. You got to let me fix it. 
Then it was no problem. So now if the strike wasn't there, maybe the bigger companies would've 
come in and took that job. But they didn't. 
LO: So it was an opportunity. 
PL: Right. 
LO: Interesting. 
PL: For every- Right, there's always opportunity. I mean, you know, like my grandfather used to 
tell me during the Great Depression, unemployment was what, 28 percent, right? That means 
what, 82 percent of people were working. Take [unintelligible] out, take away the people that 
don't do their jobs and there's plenty of work out there. 
LO: Yup. All right, so let's back it up a little bit. 
PL: Okay. 
LO: So you're at New Bedford Voc. Is that what you said? 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
6 
PL: Right. Graduated from Voc. 
LO: Graduated from Voc, learned welding a little bit in the shop or maybe... 
PL: Four years vocational program, yeah. 
LO: And then you went to Hathaway from that. 
PL: Hathaway Machinery, worked ten years. 
LO: I'm assuming you learned more at Hathaway. 
PL: I learned the trade that I'm doing now at Hathaway’s. Learned how to do the dredges and 
repair the boats. 
LO: Tell me about that process of learning. Do you remember how you, you know, your first day 
on the job or kind of.. 
PL: It was pretty interesting, it was pretty good because there again, fishing is in cycles. And I 
caught the cycle right. They started getting busy so they need to hire guys, but all the other 
people in the shop were like in their late 50s and early 60s. One guy was 45, and then I was the 
young buck at, I think I was 18 or 19 at the time. So now all the old guys took favor to me, you 
know, because I was the new. And you know you can go into a place, you know, good or bad. 
And you go in polite and people want to help you. You go in there try to know it all, snotty-ass 
kid... I went in there polite, I was raised right, and like I said, in six years, 90 percent of the 
employees that was there, they all retired, retired. They were all 30, 40, 50 year men. It was that 
kind of company, you know? 
LO: Do you remember anybody in particular that kind of took you under their wing to teach you 
the... 
PL: All of them did. 
LO: All of them? Yeah. 
PL: One of the, Mr. Costa, his, he lived in Fairhaven in this, he rented to my aunt and uncle 
which he didn't, you know, then he found out, you know. Just, all of them. They just, it was a 
family. I still have dreams about that place, you know. We had a baseball team together. You 
know, we had our own team, you know? It was a good place to work. 
LO: All right, so now you've got this, 30-something years. 
PL: 32, 33 years, correct. 
LO: And talk to me about sort of, I mean, if s a family business. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
7 
PL: Well, it's... 
LO: We were talking off the tape a little bit about that. 
PL: Okay so get back, so before when I decided I had to go out, I had a wife and four kids and a 
mortgage. I needed a paycheck. So I went into business with my brother Moe, who was living at 
home and didn't need a paycheck. He carried a lot of paychecks. And then we eventually built 
up. I've had a sister, when she got out of school, work part-time. I had a brother who started his 
own electrical business that would work when he needed work. I have a brother who works for 
me today, I had another brother work part-time for me, well work full-time for me for several 
years. 
LO: And then your sons? 
PL: And then I've had three sons in and out at any given time. 
LO: What are the positives of that? Are there positives? 
PL: You can trust family. You know, I could call any one of my brothers at any time, and any 
one of my sons, you know. So you know they're not going to, because they know if s family. And 
we're all raised right, so. 
LO: And what are the challenges of that situation? 
PL: You're family! Like I say, the problem I have with my sons is number one. I'm their father. 
Number two. I'm their boss. Number three. I'm their friend. You know, so we see each other all 
the time and sometimes the hats get clouded. Like I said, I worked with my father and I loved the 
guy, but I wouldn't work for him. He was too protective. 
[9:59] 
LO: So talk to me about this place and what you do. Tell me all the... 
PL: We build, uh... 
LO: ...range of services. 
PL: We started out boat repairing and building scallop dredges, and then we continued in trying 
to get more products. We build the dredges, we build the chain bags, we build the club sticks, we 
put them all together. We do the boat repair work, we have a couple of cranes where we move all 
the marine equipment around. Basically that's what we do. 
LO: And how many people are employed? 
PL: Counting all the employees with the secretaries, 12. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
8 
LO: That's a pretty big group. 
PL: Dozen. Yup. 
LO: And how do you divide the jobs up? I get the sense that certain people, like you were 
saying, you know. Matt does this and I don't do that... 
PL: Yeah we have, like I said, we have, let's call them different departments. Obviously, 
Shirley's in charge of the secretary department. One of my son's works here and we have a part- 
time secretary. And then I have Sal who's the shop foreman, who takes care of all of the welding 
details. Matthew, when he's not fishing, usually takes care, and sometimes when he's fishing 
because we have to call him up and, "Oh you're home, I know, but we need to get this order..." 
So he usually manages the gear work and when he's here he's working the gear. So and then me 
and this other guy do the crane work. So basically got one, three, four departments. 
LO: Whaf s your favorite part of the job? 
PL: Going home. 
LO: Is that really true? 
PL: Some days, yes. Like today I'm going to have my granddaughter. I'm going to go the house 
and I'm going to spoil her. So yeah, I can't wait to go home. Well, you know, make a business, 
excuse me a second. Make a business like this survive, you have to marry it. And you marry it 
because you love it. In the early days I had a desk at home so I'd do whatever work here, and 
when I could get out I'd go home because I could watch TV, I could do my bills and I could be 
with my kids. I had a pool in the backyard in the summertime, it worked out great. As the kids 
got older and I got separated and eventually divorced from my wife, I moved the office into here 
and there again, I got my computer here so I can look at my kids' pictures and talk to, you know, 
Facebook with my grandchildren, you end up spending a lot of time. You love it and it turns into 
a love/hate relationship. I'm fortunate now. I'm able to start separating it. I took three days off 
this weekend, I went to the Saco River, little R and R, so now tomorrow night I'm going to have 
to work late to catch up on the paperwork. But I don't mind. I do it when I want. 
LO: But that marriage. Tell me about why you married this job. You could've been anything. 
What do you like about it? 
PL: You know, my grandfather had his business, my father had a business. I'm going to have a 
business, period. Try to work for someone. 
LO: Is there something specific about the welding that... 
PL: No, it was just, it could've been electrical, I see the guy welding at my father's shop, I 
thought it was cool, one of my brothers went into it. And I liked it. So I stayed with it. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
9 
LO: Tell me about a typical day. 
PL: Summertime or winter time? 
LO: Well, let's do summertime first since it's summer. 
PL: The season for the scallopers starts in March. So the phone starts ringing in February and 
7:00-8:00,1 start at 8, but they'll call at 7 or 8.1 had a multi-boat owner call Sunday afternoon at 
2:00 because he needed a guy at 8 in the morning. So the phone rings in the summertime, it just 
flies off the hook until the middle of the season when they pretty much got half their, their 
season in and they're just kind of spacing it out. And then it goes 8-4, 8-5, and then there's 
paperwork. I'm fortunate now because I have the two cranes and I have Sal that's really good and 
the part-time secretary, we'll manipulate her so I can squeeze in her around 1:30, 2:00 and get a 
couple hours in. Because 2, 3 days I week I watch my granddaughter. Saturdays is when it's not 
too nice out, or whenever it's a bad day, Saturdays I come in here and I lock the doors, you 
know, so I can take care of the paperwork. And that's the worst part of this business is the 
paperwork. Because unfortunately, if you forget, for instance, the scallop dredge, and it happens, 
come summertime or come October, the state of Maine starts their business in December, so 
come October we start getting a lot of tire kickers, a lot of orders. I can get 16, 20 dredges and 
they all come, because they're lobstermen and they want to get their order in but they want to 
wait till the last minute, scoop in and get the dredge. If the season opens December 1, they're 
here November 30th, 29th, 28th and there's 20 dredges going out with gear and some with bags 
and some not with bags. And it's easy to forget one dredge. We number them; I'd have them 
numbered three times because it happens. You just get so busy and if you don't mark it down, 
you've got to sit here, and that's what I don't like about the job, is that... 
[15:03] 
LO: so are those bay scallop dredges? 
PL: No, them are state of Maine dredges, okay? 
LO: Tell me about that. I was unaware. 
PL: Okay, they have their own season, okay? Massachusetts has their own season, and the 
federals, okay? But in the state of Maine, they're a crusty old crew, the lobstermen rule there. 
And they're, if there's not a hundred little bays with their own little rules and regulations, there's 
my granddaughter. She's conked out, good, because I need a nap after all that, uh, so, what was I 
saying now? 
LO: Oh, about the crusty old crowd and... 
PL: Oh yeah, so every year the lobstermen decide what's going to happen. So then the scallopers 
are left to feed off the crumbs, you know what I'm saying? So sometimes the season's longer, 
sometimes it's shorter. Sometimes they can use ten-footers, sometimes they can only use five and 
a half-footers. And so whatever, and then every bay has their own sub-regulations. And a lot of 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
10 
these guys are calling up here expecting me to know, you know, Costco, Shirley lives for Maine. 
She loves this time of year. She talks to everybody up and down the coast and she knows, 
everybody knows her father, they're all lobstering. So right, Shirley, every different, every, uh, so 
we get all those orders. So if s easy when they all come in at once and you, it does get hectic. 
LO: And I didn't realize, thaf s interesting that you're serving boats up in Maine. 
PL: Yup. But usually what, what used to be the season is, they used to start November 1st to 
December 1st, and they could only use five and a half-foot dredges. Then from December 1st 
until, I think January or February, they can go up to ten and a half, but as the scallop and the cod 
and the lobster adjusts, like I say, the lobstermen come in and, you know, they're all lobstermen. 
So the majority rules. And a lot of the lobstermen are also scallopers, so they're playing off either 
way. But the guys that come down here to buy scallop dredges tell me, you know, the lobstermen 
rule there, and whatever the lobstermen say they got to do. And then in the wintertime, when it 
slows down, then I get to take my real time off 
LO: I see the ski posters on every wall. 
PL: The skiing. It's a funny thing, I never, I work outside all the time. I hate outdoor and I 
couldn't wait to go home and take a hot tub, right? It's like, what am I going to go out there 
skiing, but you have the time, you're going to make the best of it, right? And have you ever been 
skiing? 
LO: I have. 
PL: So you got all that, you know, new-fangled, you got hand warmers, you got toe warmers. 
Hey, and the best thing of all, you got that bar over there, so you can come in and warm up 
anytime and eat and drink. So make use of the time. 
LO: So, let's see. I recently learned about the compression tank, the gas tanks that are used in 
welding? 
PL: Yup. 
LO: Had no idea. So tell me, tell me what I don't know. You're talking to, you know, somebody 
who knows nothing about welding. 
PL: You want me to impress you or scare you? 
LO: Both. 
PL: Okay. That liquid oxygen, okay, that's compressed oxygen. We have acetylene here, we have 
propane here, we have bottled oxygen. That's enough to make a bomb. I could take out half a city 
with the right chemicals and the right... Not that I would. Please don't call anyone; don't put that 
particular in... but thaf s how dangerous it can be. But there again, like that compressed oxygen is 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
11 
used to save people's lives. You know, if you were dying and you needed oxygen, I could just 
take that oxygen there and make a jerry rig and feed you oxygen. 
LO: And how is it connected to the welding apparatus? 
PL: Okay so that's the, in the welding, and we can take a walk out there after and I'll show you, 
you have oxygen acetylene is used to heat and bend the material, and also to cut it. Then you 
have the arc welding, which is electric stick welding, which we use to fuse the metal together. 
We also use mig welding here, which is a machine gun to a regular gun, which is rapid fire, 
heavy welding. Then you have the tig welding, which is, we call the dentist welding. You need 
the fancy gloves, you can't, nice and clean oil. You use an argon gas and it can't have no 
contamination. We don't do that stuff here. We just rust and, fill and slug kind of guys. Because 
as you well know, fishing, they throw it overboard it's going to get beat. 
LO: Yeah. So mostly you're making dredges. 
PL: Building dredges and putting the gear together and... 
LO: And does much of the work take place off-site, or is it all here in the shop? 
PL: There again, go back to the four different departments. The fabrication of the dredges and 
the gear, all done here. Grappling hooks and all new equipment here. Repair dredges, sometimes 
we bring them here, only then when they're switching dredges because if s going to cost a crane 
to bring them here and back. So they'll go to the boat and repair them. And then sometimes they 
have boat repair work, so obviously they've got to go to the boat. 
[20:04] 
LO: And how much of that will the crew do themselves? Any of it? Do they do that repair work? 
PL: Some guys do, but I like to try to tell them, are you a fisherman or are you a welder? Do you 
want to spend your life fishing or do you want to go out there and weld? You come home, do 
you want to be with your wife, or do you want to weld? And sometimes they have equipment on 
the boat which is very good and sometimes they don't. And it, and that's really what happens. 
The people that are capable of welding, they make a little bit of money and they say, "you know 
what? I want to go home and spend time with my wife and kids, you know? Just do it yourself" 
Come wintertime and there's nothing to go around, they'll do it themselves. But no problem. We 
have enough guys. 
LO: So what, well we talked about what your favorite thing is, which is going home, and your 
least favorite thing which is... 
PL: Yeah, no the favorite thing. I'll tell you... 
LO: Yeah tell me the favorite thing... 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
12 
PL: ...really the favorite thing is operating my crane. Okay, so my typical day is, is I go out a 
couple days a week and I eat breakfast with my mom or my son, and we start the day at 8:00. 
And I get here two minutes of 8, 3 minutes of 8, but Sal already knows his job, he's the foreman, 
and Bob [unintelligible] knows what he's doing and the gear guys know what they're doing. They 
don't need me here, just in case there's a one quick, you know, you got to change the play at the 
last minute deal. And I get them going, whatever they need, "oh we need..." okay, phone calls, 
Shirley comes in, we straighten out the paperwork, then I jump on my crane truck and I get to go 
move the dredges around. And I use hooks to lift them. And when you don't have employees 
working with you, you can cut corners. So it's like, uh, you ever to go Lincoln Park, one of the 
amusement parks and try to pick up a stuffed animal? It's basically what I do all day, but with 
dredges and doors and nets. And if I lose, then I got to climb down and hook it up myself If I 
win, I hook it up and people see me and I look like a hero, like... But that's the best part. I used to 
plow with the truck, I used to unload the clam boats with the truck, so I worked all crazy hours. 
LO: So the challenge of it is kind of appealing. 
PL: Yes. And it, if s what made, I wouldn't be in business now if I didn't have the crane trucks. 
Because you need to move the scallop dredges and if I had to hire out the crane all the time, 
pretty soon someone would figure that you don't need a crane to build dredges, which they do 
now, or the guys building dredges say, I don't need him to build dredges and move dredges, 
because I'm doing it. Yeah. Why, you know, cut him right out of it. 
LO: Can you think of anytime that you had a really challenging job, unexpected order, or some 
problem that you solved that was kind of., sticks out in your mind? 
PL: You know, people like it when they come in with a repair job that they have no clue, and if s 
peanut butter for me. So they think you're a hero. There's a lot of jobs like that, busted booms or 
busting out and the guys come in here and if s laying on his deck in three pieces and, "I want to 
get out, like, tomorrow!" right? And two days later you get him out. And they look and they say, 
"wow." But. 
LO: Thaf s pretty satisfying too. 
PL: Yes, that is satisfying. 
LO: Whaf s the most common repair job? 
PL: Dredges. Repairing the, they've got to put shoes on just about every trip and then they beat 
them up so there are cracks and cut and bars, and... 
LO: Tell me what the shoes are again? 
PL: That's the part that sits down on the bottom that scrapes the, that, on the bottom. We can 
show you out there. 
LO: Yeah. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
13 
PL: So that's the part that takes the most wear, like tires on a car. If you wear out our tires and 
kept on driving you'd be spinning on your rims. If you ran out of your rims, you'd be dragging on 
your, uh, bumper. Then I'd have to rebuild the whole car. So best to get your tires changed before 
you get into your rims. 
LO: What about tools? You've got to have specialized tools. I mean, there are links, tweezers... 
PL: Yeah, most of them are common hand tools. Nothing too fancy. I'm not a multi-million 
operation where we get presses and breaks. We have a few simple drill presses and an 
ironworker, which cuts and punches holes in metal. But other than that it's all hand. Hand and 
crane. 
LO: Somebody told me that Leo Tuttle, does that name mean anything... 
PL: Yes. Leo Tuttle. 
LO: Is it true that he basically invented the squeezer? Before that people were hammering the... 
PL: He probably did. Leo, I didn't work for his boss, [unintelligible], okay, he had this guy run 
[unintelligible], who was a hero. He really was, he was a Korean War hero. Brings a tear to my 
eyes. He was one of twelve people left standing doing that, uh, that march, that death march, the 
TV one? So one of twelve guys left. But so he did all his work. But yeah, Leo was, Leo was an 
innovator. He was, people watched what Leo did and they followed Leo. Because he'd catch the 
most scallops, and he knew what he was doing. 
[25:10] 
LO: How have things evolved in all these years? So you've been at this forty years or so. 
PL: 33, 33 years I've been here. 
LO: Here, and then before that even, right? 
PL: 10 years in Hathaway's, you're right, 43 years. I started when I'm 18, I'm 60. Give or take. 
LO: How have things changed? Tools or materials, or anything. 
PL: Whaf s happening now is that the industry is shrinking, like anything else. Whaf s happening 
is when I started the business, I could name you a dozen welding companies. A dozen. Now 
you're lucky if I can name three or four. And after me, John Luzo's got one guy, one and a half 
guys working for him, Manny the welder's three quarters, thirty hours a week guy. I mean 
before, I could name Morris [??] and Z & W's, and Ronnie's Welding, and Ceasar's Welding and 
Joe, Joe [??] and Victor, and John Luzo, and Ryan. 
LO: So not enough volume of work? 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
14 
PL: Well what's happening is, is ever since the government stepped in, okay, the government is 
shrinking this industry and only for name sake, you've got the [??], the [??], the Roy [??], and 
that's just this generation. Next generation when, and I'm just going to pick, for example, the 
people you know, like sooner or later Roy is going to pass on to his two kids, and so now those 
two kids are sooner or later going to say, "you know. Wall Streef s coming down like this 
already, because, you know, give you 300 million for this. 300 million, or whatever, what am I, 
crazy? I'm going to work till I'm 90? I can buy a house in three different countries and just 
bounce around for 300 million." It happened with the [??] fishing, [unintelligible]. I don't know 
how familiar you are with [??] but they had like some 30-some odd boats. That company got 
bought out. He had at, uh, a fish house down south, with eight boats, and this company, I know 
Mr. Davis, he's the CEO, and if s a Wall Street company. Now eight boats, the licenses are 
averaging five, six million. So just for simple math, eight times five is 40 million, plus the 
property down there must be worth five million, 10 million, pick a figure, right, if s 45 million 
right there. Then they bought the Harbor Blue up here, they bought all his six or seven boats and 
they were all six to seven million-dollar boats, because they had tuna quota with it, and 
scalloping. So eight times seven is another 50-some-odd million, we're up to what, a hundred 
million now. Now they bought that building over here, uh, it used to be Quality where Ray [??] 
ties up, that whole big plant, what's that, 30, 40 million dollar plant? And they're not stopping. So 
when Roy, you know... 
LO: So thaf s outside, outside money coming in? 
PL: That's right. 
LO: Yeah. 
PL: Thaf s money that's Wall Street. This guy has got some Wall Street firm and he's coming and 
buying it all up. Warren Alexander, Carlos is going to jail because of the same thing. The 
Russian guys, Warren has guys, anyone, Lars, they come all the time offering him hundreds of 
millions of dollars because they want, they're... When I started the business anyone could buy a 
license and fish. Before I turn 65, there won't be one species in the ocean that nobody doesn't 
own. Everything's going to be owned by somebody. I own quota right now. In fact, that's one of 
the questions I'm going to hit you up later, boats like the Trident. We bought the Trident, we 
stripped the boat, we sold the parts, we kept the license, we're leasing it out. We had the Matthew 
and Lisa. We had 20,000 pounds of cod fish when we first bought that license, excuse me. Now 
we're lucky if we have 900 pounds from 20,000 pounds. So now these licenses, there again, 
sooner or later I'm going to die. One of my sons are going to get it, or my daughter. My daughter 
lives in Florida. She's going to say, what do I want that for? Can I get a hundred, can I get fifty, 
can I get 500, whatever? And it's going to stock, it's going to the stock market. 
LO: So tell me, you mentioned that back in the day, I don't remember exactly what the year was, 
but that there were five, six, seven... 
PL: When I started welding there was all kind of welding business. There were all kinds of 
carpenter businesses. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
15 
LO: What happened to them? And why did you... 
PL: Well there again... 
LO: You know. 
PL: Roy Enoksen went from owning maybe six boats to owning and managing 25-30 boats. He's 
got his own welding crew. Lars Vinjerud, I remember coming to him and he came to me when he 
started and bought a used dredge for $300, and asked if he could pay when he could come back. 
He had no money. And there again, now he has 18 boats and he has a crew working for him. So 
now everyone's got six, seven boats, they get their own little crew, and so there's less and less 
independents. 
[30:07] 
LO: And what do you think kept you... 
PL: The scallop dredges. Because I was building scallop dredges and I got into the crane work, 
which is what I do. And I'll work at Sunday, two minutes, you know, before midnight, if that's 
what to do to make that customer come back, you know, there's no turning around. It's, there's no 
other job for me. So I want to make the customer happy. And when you make the customers 
happy they come back, most of the time. So, and the scallop dredges, when you don't spend more 
than you make and you're, you know, so wintertime when it gets slow I made the guys build 
dredges, did what we have to do to get by until the big, until the good times came. Guys that 
weren't building, John Luzo's been able to maintain, only because he went into the, um, salted 
cod business. But that's left him now. He used to buy these cod skeletons, salt them heavily, and 
then ship them over to Portugal as a delicacy. And he was from Portugal. So he had this big shop 
so he could weld, he took a comer of the shop and that was his welding shop, he was able to 
weld with no overhead. But now he's lost the cod business and he's selling the building and he's 
got another two or three years to go and there'll be another welder out of business. 
LO: Sounds like a bleak future that you see. 
PL: Not if you're a multi-boat owner. There's plenty of welding work, but not for independents, 
small independents like me. I mean, you know. I'm talking I do a million and a half a year 
business is a good year for me. You talk to Roy Enoksen, if he doesn't do 300 million he had a 
bad year, you know? And I could quit tomorrow and go work for a Warren Alexander or Roy 
Enoksen like that, but you'd be working for somebody else. I'd rather be poor and work for 
myself than be rich and taking orders from somebody. If s the way I am. 
LO: That independence is a strong thing in the industry. 
PL: It is. My father, my grandfather, going back to family, so, yeah. 
LO: The waterfronf s kind of an unusual place, I think. 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
16 
PL: It is. 
LO: What would you say about that? 
PL: Well, the one thing, the one thing about the waterfront that a lot of people don't realize, is 
that somebody could get out of school, 8th grade, 10th grade, 12th grade, with a lot of gumption 
and hard work and get here, and make two, three, four hundred thousand dollars in a matter of 
five years if he really wanted to do it. And you can't do that by getting a college education, which 
I'm not saying you could do even better with a college education, but you have guys coming 
from all over the country. They come down from Maine, they up from down south, and they 
want to get on a scalloper because they hear you can make 20, 30 thousand dollars a trip. And 
that's the lure of easy money, is strong appeal as they say, but it's not easy money. It's not always 
there. But it brings out people with cajones. 
LO: So what would you say you value in the workers that you have? 
PL: Say that again? 
LO: What makes a really good worker? 
PL: Me? Show up on time, give me an honest day's work and don't steal from me. And I'l find 
work till the day I die. And work's pretty good. I have the best crew, the best crew. They're 
diversified, I can name them all and you know, there's, I can take days off, I don't have a 
problem. 
LO: Thaf s good. 
PL: I can't take weeks off at a time. 
LO: Do you feel like, a lot of people that I talk to... 
PL: Actually I could take weeks off at a time, but then I would miss it. But go ahead. 
LO: A lot of people that I talk to sort of talk about kind of, back in the old days there was much 
more community, now it feels, to them, like that sense of community has kind of gone away. 
PL: There again, it's coming to be a one-horse town. So as there's less and less boat owners, it's 
more and more of a corporate world. And corporates are all about numbers, okay? I got two sons 
working for me, I got a brother right now. I've got a second or third cousin/nephew or however 
you want to say it, then I have a half a dozen other employees. I, I'll find work to break even to 
keep them busy. The big companies will say, "Jeez, you know, we don't need the welding shop 
this year, lay them all off and then, and I'll buy six months." And to be honest with you. I've had 
to do that. I've had to lay my brother off and say, "Listen, Rodger, here's your unemployment, go 
find a part-time job, come here one day a week I'll pay you a little bit of cash, things get better, 
we'll hire you back." You do what you got to do to survive, but when it gets slow, thaf s, I bought 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
17 
a boat and I'm refabbing it. And hopefully I got enough money to fix it and sell it, but, so I can 
keep my guys going. Because if s never steady in this business. Never. 
[35:14] 
LO: So there's more of a, I don't know, sense of, welfare like... 
PL: Well right now it's more of a sense of survival... 
LO: But, as a manager, as the owner of the company, you have... 
PL: It's family. 
LO: Yeah. 
PL: I treat it, the way, you know, and there again, when I started this business, I used, I didn't go 
to college for business, I learned the hard way, and believe me, I learned a lot of hard lessons. 
But I copied Hathaway Machinery, which I thought, there again, I felt, it was a big business but 
it was still family-owned, it was a third-generation business. The third generation ran it aground. 
So I copied my, like, eleven holidays. I pay my guys eleven paid holidays. One of them is a 
birthday. And they say, "Why do you do that?" I say, "Well, that's the company I worked for 
before, that that's what they did. And I liked it, so you know, this is the standard I'm using 
myself I'm not going to, you know, going to be that or better." And that's what I do, I mean. The 
end of the year, we have a lot of money, we have a party and a bonus. We have a bad year, 
well... 
LO: Little party. 
PL: Well a little party, yeah. We have sandwiches and beer out there in the break room. 
LO: That's good. Funny little question, but I know that there are interesting terms on the 
waterfront and, you know, different workplaces. Like you've got the cookies that you put on the 
dredge, right? 
PL: Right. 
LO: Can you think of other ones that you guys... 
PL: Well the shoes on the dredge... 
LO: The shoes... 
PL: Right, then we put the tires on the dredge, which really, are hard, solid rubber rollers. Uh, 
describing the dredge you have your bale and your gooseneck, which if you don't know what I'm 
talking about, it's like, what are you talking about? You know, and your pressure plate, I mean, 
there are different terminology. Other than that... 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
18 
LO: And do most of the guys, I mean other than your sons, but the other workers, did they come 
in here knowing the fishing industry? 
PL: Most of the kids I take I get them out of Voc, believe it or not. Sal, Sal was a godsend. Sal's 
my number one guy. 
LO: Where did Sal come from? I met Sal last summer. 
PL: Did you? 
LO: Yeah. 
PL: He came here with his brother. Couldn't speak a lick of English. Couldn't speak a lick of 
English and he wanted a job. And I was just getting busy, said, Jesus. There's something about 
him. I said, hang onto him. But he couldn't speak English and that was a good thing, because 
when people can't speak English, and at the time I didn't know he was married and had three 
little kids, that I didn't know. But so he comes in, he wants a job, he's got a job, he can't talk to 
nobody, he speaks no English, right? So he's just going to keep welding and hold his job, so, to 
keep his job. So after about six months, there again, the cycle started getting up and work was 
getting good and the brother comes back again and says, you know, he needs more money. I'm 
saying to myself, we all need more money, you know? The hell do you want me to do, you 
know? Says, he's got three kids. I said, oh, you had to tell me that. So we started raising him. 
And his three kids, because he spoke fluent Portuguese, so it was Spanish and English and 
Creole because of his family and his kids... 
LO: He's from where? 
PL: He's originally from Portugal. But of course, you met Sal, so you know he's got to be from 
Africa somewhere somehow, but he... 
LO: I figured Cape Verde, no? Maybe? 
PL: Probably both. 
LO: Yeah. Azores. 
PL: Azores. Yeah. But he. I'm not going to argue. I'm not a gynecologist, he's awful black to be 
just from the Azores, right? But he, that's what, so he's Azorean, part Cape Verdean, you know, 
generations, he could have a lot of, I don't know, but he writes down Cape Verdean, Portuguese, 
thaf s what I consider him, and, uh, he's one hell of a guy. He's come to the top. I can't do, I can 
tell him what to do, I say, "Hey Sal, build this up over here." And I get away and I come back if s 
like, wow. Better than I was even thinking. 
LO: What kind of experience did he come with? 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
19 
PL: He was a certified pipe welder in Portugal, but he has a natural talent for what he's doing. He 
just - There again, just shit luck timing. 
LO: That's great. 
PL: Yeah. For both of us. 
LO: Yeah. 
PL: Yeah. 
LO: Just want to see if I missed anything on my list. Is there anything you wanted to talk about 
that we haven't talked about? 
PL: No. I could show you how it works out there and everything, you might have a few more 
questions. 
LO: Oh, I know, one other question, you talked about the gasses... 
PL: Yup. 
LO: ...which are flammable and explosive... 
PL: Yup, yup. 
LO: You ever have a close call? 
PL: Urn... 
LO: With that or with... 
[40:00] 
PL: Funny story. Okay, you're going to love this one. There again, being into welding, we have 
experience. And when we're in Vocational, they showed us the difference between gasoline, 
propane, diesel fuel, gasoline. Now, the guy takes a rag, he lights it up, he goes to diesel fuel and 
he sticks it in the bucket of diesel fuel, he puts it out, right? Same thing, he goes to the gasoline, 
he gets about five feet away, the thing goes woosh. So I always know that gasoline, and every so 
often people come in and ask for favors. Well, somebody came in and they needed their gasoline 
tank welded. So I said, listen Sal, this is what we got to do. We flush it out, you soap it out, the 
proper procedures. We did it three times. We filled it up with water, it was only a small tank, it's 
a motorcycle tank, about, let's say three, four gallons tops. Soap it out, wash it out, leave it, water 
sitting in it all night long, drain it the next day. Say, "Sal, how's it, you know, how's it look and 
everything?" You know, yup, say, "Well, make sure you got all your clothes on, you know, the 
face shield," and you're actually, because sometimes in summer we'll just weld like this. But, 
said, "Okay." So we come back in the office and I start talking to Bob Lobel, and all of a sudden 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
20 
we hear Boom! We run out of there, Sal's white as a ghost. "Sal, what happened?" As soon as he 
put the torch and the heat to it and he heated it up, the fumes. After we soaked it for two nights 
and washed it out, the fumes still stayed there. And it blew up. I've been in a fuel tank myself 
with inches of diesel fuel in the tank and welding a little hole because they didn't want to haul 
out because times are so tough and they'd be out of business if the boat got hauled out and... But 
that was... 
LO: You weld on the tanks that hold the fuel? 
PL: Been inside a tank, with fuel in it, welding it, yes. 
LO: Wow. That never... 
PL: I would never do that again today and I've never sent any of my guys out there. But back 
then, I, one of the things I like to do today, and most times in my life, I love to go to the mail. I 
love to see, oh, check from this guy, oh, check from this guy. Back in the early '90s when times 
were tough, I was afraid to go to the mailbox. Bankruptcies left and right, getting stuck. And 
people don't realize, if you do a 10 thousand dollar job you're probably making about 3 or 4 or 5 
hundred dollars, you know. That was the brutal part. But what else are you going to do? I 
thought, when I got divorced and I was at my lowest and business was bad and I was dating this 
girl and she, her best friend's husband worked at the gas company, and that was always a 
cherished job, you know, security. You work forty hours, you get your, you know, you get your 
insurance 401k, nobody's, you know, nobody's beating you like a dog and... And I said, many a 
days, wanting to fill it out. But I didn't. And things got better. 
LO: I get the sense you're pretty happy with how it all turned out, so far. 
PL: Yup. I wouldn't do something different. I wouldn't. 
LO: So besides the crane truck, what else do you like about it? 
PL: About the job? Just coming around, they know me as Mr. Blue Fleet. I get calls where, 
Shirley, where do we sell dredges, what, Russia? England, Alaska... 
Shirley: Ireland. 
LO: Wow. 
PL: Ireland, Canada... 
Shirley: Oregon. 
PL: Yeah, Alaska or Oregon. 
LO: And how do they get shipped? Truck? 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
21 
PL: Tmck and then by boat. 
LO: Boat. 
PL: But that's why we never get repeat business, because it's cheaper to copy it than it is to make 
a new one. But, you know, because New Bedford is considered the scallop capital of the world. 
So if you find scallops in your neck of the world, and you Google it up, you'll find New Bedford. 
So if you want to know something about scallops, well lef s, you know, gear. Well lef s look for, 
like. Ship Supply, or Reidar's, or dredges, you know. My name comes up. 
LO: I think if s even called a New Bedford-style dredge. 
PL: Thaf s right. New Bedford-style dredge. It was in the book, I don't know if you read the 
Marine Service, they're coming back with a, uh, what the hell do they call them, if s five small 
dredges, a Digby dredge, with a bar ten foot or fifteen foot, and then you have like two-foot 
dredges in the back. And oh, they're the best thing since sliced bread. They're doing great over 
there in, uh, Norway. Well, you know, we did that 30 years ago. So we've already been there, 
you know what I mean? And I know that because I was there when they were doing it. Nobody 
in New Bedford uses them anymore, what does that tell you? When I started the business I had a 
boat or two that ordered them, and everyone else was clipping them. So they don't use them. So 
and thaf s what people, when people go into scalloping, we build the dredges, we build the gear, 
we hang it. I deliver it, I pick them up, I store them. With me, you don't need anybody else. With 
anybody else, you need me, you know what I'm saying? Except for Roy because he's got his own 
dock so he can have boats come up to him and dock. You know, or if somebody else, like 
Charlie is starting to build dredges, but he doesn't have the crane, he doesn't have the dock, so 
he's at a disadvantage. 
[45:38] 
LO: Charlie [??]? 
PL: Yeah. Nice guy, successful but, you know, Charlie wants to do everything and he's going to 
find out that what he was doing best he should stick with. But, you get people that come in, when 
it looks easy everyone wants to do it. And in theory, I survive because I build dredges. But 
because I'm not too high-priced, I got a sharp pencil, if s hard to get in under the mark and to beat 
somebody who's been in for 30 years with a better product thaf s twice the price. You know, it's 
like how. I've been doing it for 30 years so you've got to steal, he has his own boats, but thaf s not 
enough to keep the business going. And I'm not singling out Charlie in particular, but guys like 
Charlie, I have that with the vultures, you know. It's just, you know. I've been doing it for 30 
years so I've been doing it. You've got to come and get it from me, so you better either be a lot 
better, a lot cheaper, or, you know, have some dancing girls come with them, you know what I 
mean? Why would you change, whether it was dredges or, you know, you go buy a new car, 
you're happy with the guy, he got the best price in town you think, you're going to come to me. 
I'm going to have to get you a better car, lower price, right? 
LO: Parting words? 
Interview with Paul Lemieux, June 28, 2017 
22 
PL: See you in twenty years, because I plan to be here until the day I die, but not working 60 
hours a week. By then I'll be down to 20 hours a week with three-month vacations. Sal will be 
the guy you're talking with. But yeah, I love this. I love it. 
LO: Great. 
PL: Okay? 
LO: Thank you.
