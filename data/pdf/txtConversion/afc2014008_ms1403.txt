I heard the bosses saying...got no work f

There's a guard at every door

"JUST THE FACTS, Mk'AN"
 
(Made up of two songs: "Biggest Thing Man
 
Has Ever Done" and "Ten Thousand Years Ago").
 
A)
 
I was born about ten thousand years ago;
 
There ain 't nothing in this world I do not know,
 
I 3aw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring-a-round
 
the rosie,
 
And I can whip the guy that says it isn't so.
 
B
)  Pm just a lonesome traveller.
 
The great historical bum.
 
F
ighly educated, from history I
've come
 
I built the Rock of Ages twas in the year of One;
 
And that was about the biggest thing
 
"
hat man has ever done.
 
I saw Satan when he looked the Gardeno'er,
 
I saw Eve and Adam driven from the door,
 
From behind the bushes peeping seen ie apple they was eating
 
And I
'll swear that I
'm the guy what ate the core.
 
d
)  d
arden of Eden?
 
Fe U, I BUILT the Garden of Eden, it was the year of Two,
 
J
oined the Apple Pickers Union, and I always paid my dues.
 
Fm the man that signed the contract to Raise the Rising Sun,
 
'd that's about the biggest thing that man has ever d
one.
 
A)  I taught Samson how to use his mighty hands,
 
Showed Columbus -
-
 this happy land,
 
And for Pharoah's little kiddies built the pyramiddies,
 
And to the Sahara carried all the sand.
 
Fcami4s?  Why
 
F
 straw boss on the pyramids, the Tower of Babel, too,
 
I opened up the ocean, let the migrant children through;
 
J
ell, I fought a million battles, and I never lost a one,
 
And that's about the biggest thing that man has ever d
one.
 
A)  I taught Solomon his little ABC's,
 
I was the first one ate Limburger cheese,
 
And while sailing down the bay with Methuselah one day,
 
I saved his flowing whiskers from the breeze.
 
A)
 
.
 
Well, I was in the Revolution when we s
et this country free,
 
It was me and a couple of Indians that dumped the Boston tea,
 
Well, I won the battle of Valley Forge and the Battle of Bully Run,
 
And that's about the biggest t
hing that man has ever done.
 
Queen Elizabeth fell deadin love with me,
 
We were married in Milwaukee secretly,
 
But I snuck around and shook her, to go with G
eneral Hooker
 
To fight mosquiters d
own in Tennessee.
 
Repeat t
he first verst of both songs simultaneously.
 
(
Not.; this version is s
lightly different from the version which has
 
been recorded by '
Walt Robertson for Folkways Records. I rather prefer
 
his version here and there. But in the interests of accuracy, I
'm giving
 
you this exactly a it was c
opied by my friend Keith Clark, of Ottawa, Ill.
 
(
i
t D 4) from the diary of Mrs. S
ara A Price, of Ottawa. She had had s
even
 
children and lost them all, Some of her e
ons had been killed i
n the Civil
 
War, 1861-65.  Thus this version c
an be dated about
 aid  Nineteenth
 
Century. It sounds to as  like a c
omposed s
ong, c
omposed in the US, not
 
Ireland, although the tradition is that of Irish topical ballads. It has
 
been variously, titled '
Life Is A Toil', and '
Housewive's L
ament' • Mrs.
 
Price called i

One c
i
ay as I wandered I heard a c
cmp1airibg
 
And s
aw a porr mman the picture of gloom
 
She glanced at the end on her doorstep (
'twas raining)
 
And this was $U  her wail as she wielded her broom
 
Oh, life is a toil and love is a trouble
 
Beauty wi
ll fade and riches will flee
 
And pleasures they dwindle and prices they double
 
And nothing is what I could wish it to be
 
There's too much of worriment goes to a bonnet
 
There's too much of iroing goes to a s
hort
 
There's nothing that pays for the t
ime you waste on it
 
There's nothing that lasts us but trouble and dirt
 
Ih March i
t is mu., it is slush in December
 
The midsu e
mer breesle are loaded with duet
 
In fall the leaves litter, in muggy September
 
The wallpaper rots and the condlesticks rust
 
There are worms in the cherries and slugs on the
 
And ante in the sugar and mice in the pies
 
The rubbish of spide no mortal supposes
 
And ravaging roaches and d
amaging flies
 
U It's sweeping at s
ix and it' s dusting at seven
 
It's victuAls at eight and it's dishes at nine
 
Ito j
; potting and pe
nning from t
en to eleven
 
We s
carce break ow fast till we plan how to dine
 
With grease And with grim, from c
orner to c
enter
 
Forever at war and forever alert
 
No rest for %U a d
ay lost the enemy enter
 
I spend my whole life in s
truggle with dirt
 
Last night in my dreams I
 was stationed forever
 
On a IU U little bars isle in the midst of the sea
 
My one chance of life was a c
easeless endeavor
 
To sweep off the waves '
ore they swept off poor me
 
Ala s
  twas a dream, again I behold it
 
I
 yield, I am helpless,  my fate to avert
 
She rolled down her sleeves, her apron she f
olded
 
Then lay down and died, and was buried in dirt

SOUTH  COAST
 
S
 
My name is Juan Jarro de Castro, my father was a Spanish grandee
 
But I won my wife in a card game; to }
ie11 with those Lords o'er the
 
sea
 
Oh the South Coast is a wild coast and lonely,
 
You may win at a game in Jalon
 
But the lion still rules the barranca
 
And a man there i
s always alone.
 
I play d in a car' game at Jalon, I played with a man there named Juan
 
And after I
'd taken his money,  staked all against his daughter  )
awn.
 
I picked up the ace,  I had won h e
r. My heart which was down at my feet
 
Jumped up to my throab in a hurry, like a pure summer's day sh  was
 
sweet.
 
He called the girl out of the kitchen: he called the girl out with
 
a curse,
 
Saying, take her, god damn her, yOu ve
 won her;  she's yours now,
 
for better or worse.
 
Her arms had to tighten about me as we rode up the hills to the south
 
Not a wore did I hear from her that day, or a kiss from her pretty
 
red mouth.
 
V  soon reached my cabin at twilight; the stars twinkled out
 5
 
on the coast.
 
She soon loved the vall v, t
 orchrrds, but I kn
 that she lovCd
 
me the most.
 
Oh that was a gay happy winter, w' carved on a cra Ue of pine
 
By the fire in that neat little shanty, I sang with that gay wife
 
of mine.
 
On  lay I got hurt in a landslide, crushed hip and twice broken bone,
 
Sh  saddl e
d my pony like licitening and rode
 off in the night for
 
Jalon.
 
A lion screamed in the harr nca, bolted ani fell on the slide
 
My young wife lay dead in th  moonlight, my heart died that night
 
with my bride.

My name i
s Peter Amb.rl.y, I
'll have you understand
 
I was b
orn on Prince Edw rd I
sland, Close by the river s
tand
 
In 1
880, I l
oft my native home
 
Oh, this c
ountry I would travel o
'er, this country I would r
oam.
 
I landed in New Brunswick close by the l
umb'ring country
 
I hired to work in the lumbering woods, just out of Miraad.ohi
 
I hired to w
ork in the lumbering woods, where they out the tall spruce down
 
And while l
oading teams with yarded l
ogs, I received my fatal wound.
 
O there's d
anger on the salt, salt sea, where the waves roll mountains high
 
And there's danger on the battlefield, where angry bullets f
ly
 
£nd there's danger in the old north woods, for death lurks silent there
 
And It's I have fallen victim to, its awful monstrous snare.
 
And s
o adieu my dearest friend, I mean my mother dear
 
She reared us in our father's place s,
 a
s he left our tender care
 
but l
ittle did she ever know, as she sang my lullaby
 
Oh the c
ountry I would travel in, the death that I would di..
 
o
 adieu to a
ll the i
sland girls, the i
sland girls so true
 
Long may they l
ive to r
oam the shore, where my f
irst b
reath I drew
 
Long may they live to roam the shore, and see the ships go by
 
with banners gaily waving, from tall masts upon high.
 
But there's one request before I d
ie, unto my comrades all
 
My lonely grave may they keep clean, when leaves and snows do fall
 
For it's near the town of Miremichi, alone I
'm forced to l
ip
 
To await the • yj
5 coming, on ressur.ction day.
 
Y
es my name is .  . .
 etc. (repeat f
irst verse).

But now I hear that she don't look the same.

Shame and Scandal
 
There was a family lived
 
an the isle of
 
San Sebastian for a long, long
 
while.  The head of the family was a
 
Hollander man, and the
 
younger brother , his name was
 
Pan.  (
cho.) A h - 
Woe, ah - 
Me
 
Shame and S candal on the fami-
(
1) -ly.  Ah -  
() woe, Ah - 
(
1) Me
 
() Shame and Scandal on the fain!-
(
1) ly.
 
The Hollander man kept in the tower
 
A wife as pretty as a big white flower
 
She saw the brother and she stole his heart
 
And that's how the trouble and the scandal s
tart
 
The wife and the brother, they wanted to go
 
But the Hollander man he tell them  No1e
 
The wife fall down and the evil came
 
And burn her mind in its evil flame.
 
Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk
 
And the music has come to make her walk
 
The brothers are lonely, and the nurse is young,
 
And now you must know that my song is sung
 
r
 I
 
THE H. U. A.  :
,
 
I am a college student, and I've come to sr
 a snc
';
 
S
 
I've always been a liberal, I never
 
thouoht it wrcro.
 
iut I have come to tell you to take warni:
 
you may have to tancle with the old H. U. A.
 
Now I am only 18 years of ae as of this date.
 
It's bard to see how I could be a danger to th
 state,
 
But that's what the committee said and so it has to be,
 
For their sources are of unimpeachable inteRrity.
 
H. U. A. C.
 H. U. A. C.
 
hat a lucky thir w it is for
 :u and me;
 
That our freedoms are well c
7uarded
 
By oolitically retarded men of unimneachable inte -ritr.
 
I -i
ent and joined a picket line because I'd like to see
 
No more discrimination if our land is really free.
 
I'd like to see them put an end to weapons testin
 to:;
 
But they say this is a dangerous subversive point of view.
 
I tried to be progressive, but I never was a red.
 
I thought the First Amendment meant exactly what it said
 
iut now that that's gone out of style, there's just one thinT to do
 
e silent or conservative, the choice if up to you.
 
f
i. U. A.  C
., H. U. A. C.
 
They're just looking out for guys like you and me.
 
So become reactionary and of progress be most wary
 
Keey our country true and brave and strong and free.
 
Now listen to my warning and reject each liberal
 
And praise the men who govern us no matter what they do.
 
But even this is not enou h for those who w-uld c
r0 far,
 
You'd better make your moth r join the local U. A . H.
 
Now please don't ever tell them who it was who sano t is
 ono.
 
If anyone should ask you tell them I have moved a1on .
 
I'm sorry that I have to leave, the evening has been øreat
 
ut I hsve ceen subnoenaèd and I really can't be late.

Four cornfields are all that remain
 
Of the ranch which once was mine,Alas
 
Of that charming white house--oh,how
 
sad it is now
 
The pastures are emp y of livestock
 
E very last one  is gone,alas
 
i

of flowereee
las,it is gone!
 
You will lend me your eyes,my brunette,

Four cornfields which so dearly I lov
 
my dear mother cared for,alasL

Without poppies or sweet-smelling herbs!

WE 'RE IN THE SALE BOAT BROTHER 
o
 the Lord looked down
 
From His holy place
 
Said, 'Lordy me what a sea of space."
 
"What a spot to launch the huma
i race."
 
So He built Him a boat
 
For a mixed up crew
 
With eyes of black and brown and blue.
 
And that's how eom  you and
 
Have just one world
 
With just one sky.
 
cHOBuS: 
We'De in the same boat, brotlE r.
 
We're in the same boat, brother.
 
A
: d if you shake one end
 
You're gonna rock the other
 
It's the same boat brother.
 
o
 the boat rolled on
 
Through storm and grief
 
Past maiy a rock
 
And many a reef
 
What kept them going
 
Was the great belief
 
That they had to b
ern to navigate
 
Ourt the human race was a special frieght.
 
If you don't want to be in  onah's shoes
 
You'd better be mates on this here cruise.
 
Now you ad I
, we know i
t's true
 
The future is ours
 
We'll see it tho'
 
Standing side by side, we'll
 
build the world new
 
0 it taks some timefor people
 
to learn
 
What's bad for the bow
 
Ain't good for the stern
 
But black and white, and red and
 
brown
 
Will all work together
 
And make the world go around.
 
A year has passed
 
Our camp has grown
 
Now here at last we've found a
 
new home
 
There's many astorm
 
But our love is strong
 
For we've worked together for
 
brotherhood
 
And now we know that it has brought
 
us good
 
8o  f you want this camp to go and
 
grow
 
You'd better start work m
ith a
 
rake ad hoe.

While those prices and profits went to town.
 
If a dollar's worth a dine,
 
What the hell good is nine?
 
It's as Phoney as a Nine Dollar Bill.  CHORUS
  
You're the hero of the day, the bosses said,
 
And we'll all be proud thourh you are dead.
 
I rolled out with the Navy
 
And the bosa rolled in the gravy
 
And he left me with a Nine Dollar Bill.  CHORUS
  
4.  They're saying on Capitol Hill,
 
Here's a strike that we've cot to kill.
 
2et the boys in olive drab
 
And the Navy blue to scab;
 
Pay them off with a Nine Dollar Bill.  CHORUS
  
5. So I'm stay n  on the beach, boys, until
 
That boss comes across -

 and be will.

We're  oinn to sink that Nine Dollar Bill. CHORUS

Which sixty percent should I choo

Should I go around with no pants on
 
Or do I look best without shoes?
 
Will the dealer take s

For all of my farm supplies?
 
And will they cut my taxes dawn
 
To sixty percent of their size?

As I went down to the mowing field,
 oo rye, etc.
 
A big black snake bit me on the heel.
 
I fell down upon the ground,
 
Shut my eyes and I looked all around.
 
I set up on a stump for t
o take my rest,
 
Looked like a woodcheck se tti ng  on a nest.
 
The woodchuck grinned a banjo song,
 
Up came a skunk with his britches on.
 
The woodchuck and skunk got into a fight,
 
'
ihe fumes so strong it put out the li g
ht.
 
'
ihey fought and they danced till the chimney began to rust,
 
hard to tell which smelt the worst.

're coming, we're coming, our brave little band
 
On the right side of temperance we all take our stand.
 
e don't smoke tobacco because we all t
hink
 
That a person who'd use It is so apt to drink.
 
l
e never eat fruitcake, it's so full of rum
 
just one s
ingle slice puts a man on the bum.
 
Oh can your imagine a nastier s
ight
 
Than a mari eating fruitcake until he gets t

Oh a man drunk on fruitcake is a public disgrace
 
As he rolls in the gutter with crumbs on his face.

When you gonna let me get sober
 
Let me alone, let me go home
 
Let me go back and start over.
 
Rambling round this dirty old to wn
 
Singing for nickels and dimes,
 
Time's getting rough,  I ain't got enough
 
To get a little bottle of wine.
 
Little hotel, older than hell
 
Dark as the coal in a mine
 
Blankets are thing, I lay there and grin
 
I got a little bottle of wine.
 
Pain in my head, bugs in my bed,
 
Pants are so old that they shine,
 
Out on the street tell the people I meet
 
Buy me a bottle of wine.
 
Preacher will preach, teacher will teachg,
 
Miner will dig in the ± mine
 
I ride the rods, trusting in God
 
Hugging my bottle of wine.

Dear  Bess
 
A remnent  of  Jerry's  early  religious  training  is  our  copy  of
 
The  Methodist  Hymnal,  edition 1939,  which  you 're  welcome  to
 
borrow any  time.
 
The variants  of We  Are  Bound  for the  Promised  Land  in  there
 
refer more  to  Heaven and how good  it will  be  to  die  and  go
 
there.
 This  seems  to be  a common theme  of  Methodist  hymns.
 
Easter  1962  I attended  the  services  at  Palos  Heights,  Illinois
 
with Jerry's  folks.
 When he  and  I went  there  it was  the  only
 
church  in  the  community of  500 people,  so  had about  100 members
 
and a piano.
 Now  the community has  several  thousand  people,
 
a dozen  churches,  and  "Jerry's church"  has  seferal  hundred
 
members,  an organ,  and elegant  choir robes.
 I was  surprised
 
at  the  terribly poor quality of  the  singing this  year.
 The
 
organ was  so  loud  I couldn't hear  the  congregation singing.
 
All  the  hymns were  pitcheâ  too  high  for me,  and  those  around
 
me  (and my singing voice has a fairly  good range  these  days).
 
I couldn't hear any  "feeling"  expressed  in  the  words  sung,  it
 
just was  the  organ plowing along and  the  group plowing along
 
with  it.
 The minister  (not  the  one  Jerry and  I loved years
 
ago!) doesn' t even sing  -
-
 he bows  his  head.
 
Methodism was  born  in song.
 But  something has  happened,  and
 
I wonder  if  the  gusto  of  the singing correlates  with  the  socio-
economic  condition of  the  singers?
 Probably  Lee  Hayes  has  a
 
much more  accurate  explanation,  and
 like  to  know  it.

On  Jordan's stormy banks  I stand,  And cast  a wishful  eye
 
To Canaan's fair  and happy  land,  Where my  possessions  lie.
 
O the  transporting,  rapturous scene  that rises  to my sight
 
Sweet  fields arrayed in  living  green,  and  rivers  of  delight!
 
O'er all  those wide  extended plains shines  one  eternal  day
 
There  God  the  Son  forever reigns,  and  scatters  night away.
 
No chilling winds,  or  poisonous breath,  can reach  that  healthful  shore
 
Sickness  and sorrow,  pain and death,  are  felt  and  feared  no  more.
 
When  I shall  reach that  happy  place,  I'll  be  forever blest
 
For  I shall  see my Father's face and  in His  bosom rest
 
Filled with delight my raptured  soul  lives  out  its  earthly  day
 
And  then,  though  Jordan's waves may roll,  I'll  fearless  launch away.

There  is a land  of  pure  delight where  saints immortal  reign;
 
Infinite  day  excludes  the  night,  and pleasures banish pain
 
There  everlasting spring abides  and never withering  flowers
 
Death,  like  a norrow sea,  divides this  heavenly  land  from  ours.
 
Sweet  fields  beyond the  swelling  flood stand dressed  in  living green
 
So  to  the  Jews  old Canaan stood while  I
tordan rolled between
 
Could we  but  climb where Moses stood  and view the  landscape  o'er
 
Not  Jordan's stream,  nor  death's cold  flood,  should  fright  us  from  the
 
shore.

On Jordan's stormy banks  I stand,  And cast a wishful eye
 
To Canaan's fair and happy land,  'here my possessions  lie.
 
the  transporting,  rapturous scene that rises to my sight
 
Sweet  fields arrayed in  living green,  and rivers of delight!
 
O'er all  those wide extended plains shines one eternal day
 
There God  the  Son forever reigns,  and scatters night away.
 
No chilling winds,  or poisonous breath,  can reach  that healthful shore;
 
Sickness and sorrow,  pain and death, are felt  and feared no more.
 
When I shall reach that happy place,  I'll be  forever blest
 
For I shall see my Father's face and  in His bosom rest
 
Filled with delight my raptured soul lives out its earthly day
 
And then,  though Jordan's waves may roll,  I'll  fearless  launch away.
