THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
}Intered acording to act of Congress, in the year 18'73, by NEI, H AS. 
NIGAN, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at 
Wash/41/-1.0n, D. C. 
Composed and sung by F ARRIGAN & HART, with immense success, at 
the Theatre Comique, New York. 
We crave your condescension, 
A'xi we'll tell you what we know 
if marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
:A Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the 
Connemarro pet, 
With the Rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud—. 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red boys, 
5 
To show where we came from; 
Our guns we'd lift 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
Ve shoulthed, &o. 
When we'd g-t 
horn'' at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd skzp; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of Whisky, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard.

BUFFALO. 
WrIttca by NED HARKIGA.N. 
riZOM Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; • 
Along; 
long Lip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, aal winud storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall; 
rna every ineil a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-a Canal. 
Cuont-s. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the gin is getting low; 
I 
baldly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we Lid good-bye; 
When a 
pirate 
upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
For the Erie, &-
43 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawanna Coal; 
-It save the boat an awful shock, - 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
helloed to the driver, 
On the tow- path's treaden dirt; 
He came aboard and stopped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
For the Lrle, 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
'We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew mutinizcd 
Because I 
refusc.d to drink. 
Keep up your co--- , then I 
cried, 
I'll lari?:; you. safcly in 
And w.
 _en we strike a 
grocor- store, 
Wfd swim in barrels of gin. 
For the Erie, &e, 
The storm went down, we wont ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank. ; 
Greased ourselves with tallow-fat, 
And slid out on a 
plank.. 
Sal is in the Poor House, boys, 
The crew are all in jail; 
the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
SPOKEN,. So haul in your bow-line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads ; 
Don't act just like a 
fool,

ERIN FAR AWAY. 
Sung by EDDIE POWERS the Irish nightingale at Kerns & POWeril 
Opera House, corner of Prince & Cro ,by st: -ect-=. 
He never sings 
this only when be wishes 10 keep his audience all night. 
THE morn looked down from an azure sky; 
When the deadly 11-11t Wa-, o'er, 
On the battle field were the brave laid low, 
Whom this life could claim no more, 
And its pale light cast on the damp cold earth, 
Where a 
wounded soldier lay, 
O'er whose form crept the breath of death, 
As his life tide flowed away. 
In this verse he gets very much excited and falls against the baz. 
A. comrade passing heard his moans, 
And soon the sufferer found, 
And gently raised his aching head, 
From ofl the crimsoned ground, 
Sweet words of hope and thoughts of home, 
lie whispered in his ear, 
And spoke he of the victory, 
Which they had won so dear. 
This verse is great graft for the boys. 
The dying soldier raised his brad, 
And gently brushed aside, 
The raven locks that his heart's blood, 
To crimson red had dyed, 
And faintly, slowly, comrade said, 
Not long on earth's ray stay, 
No more we'll roam In my childhood's home, 
In Erin far away. 
Is where he calls in Police ( to drink.) 
But a 
lock of hair I 
pray you bear, 
To my mother o'er the sea, 
That when upon it she may look, 
Sh. , will kindly think of me. 
And tell her though mid India's sands, 
My mouldering dust may lay, 
My heart is still with Erin, 
Loved Erin far away. 
IPTe is where the gang shed tears ( for a 
natl.) 
roll n.

Since I 
s kr s:niling face. 
That Ler f ) rui is present to my mind, 
Each feat are I 
can trace, 
And at this my last, and ( lying hour, 
My wanderi:br thouy:lits now stray, 
To the grassy glade where oft we played, 
In Erin far away. 
Eddie heccimes weak and calls for assistance—aus, 
Tell my brothers that I 
nobly fell, 
And as our father died, 
With my bayonet char"ing on the foe, 
And my sabre by my side, 
It nerved my heart to e:miner, 
And the sepoy 
t•I slay. 
As visions bitslit crept o'er my sight, 
Of Erin far away. 
15 
— 
Eddle.—He is ebbing lastly away. 
Tell the friends with whom in childhood I 
played, 
Around the old oak tree, 
That my last breath blessed them dying, 
In a 
clim3 far o'er the sea, 
And tell them that I 
blul and fought, 
On this' e,yentful day, 
For Britain's honor, Britain's Queen, 
And Erin far away. 
Ms audience d!scovered asleep in all directions round the floor. 
No more he said his eyes grew dim, 
Ere the next sun had shed 
Her glowing beams upon the earth, 
The vital spark had fled ; 
A 
grave was made in which he was laid, 
Ere closed the waning day, 
Far from each haunt he loved so well, 
In Erin far away. 
Slow fire— red music.

First Lover. 
I'VE just arrived in town to day, 
To see the girl I 
love. 
She lives in yonder little cot, 
She is my turtle dove; 
I 
know I've got a

That comes here on the sly, 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try. 
C

Oh, my, the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out behind, 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The7fairest in the land, 
A.nd I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand.

He thinks he cuts a

He comes around the girl nova, 
And very soon I'll find;

On him 'Mina a

And send him home with his 3Ia,

To drink nothing else but so-long tea,

To see my friends ' ,row stout and gay, 
Fat on me I'll never get, 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a

All the gals they do me shun, 
And shake me for some other fell, 
They say I 
look like the barrel of a

Could be used for an umbrell; 
Oh, what will I

In the eye of an needle I

MY thoughts of a 
girl I 
can't conceal, 
I 
met the other day. 
She'd a 
dainty lout and a 
lovely heal, 
With, oh, such a 
winning way; 
No duck in a 
pond was half so light:, 
As she with her careless air, 
The veil she wore was scarlet bright, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Citorius. 
Oh! my heart pit-pat as she passed me by, 
So beautiful and Ur, 
She glanced at me with her soft blue eye, 
,The girl with the flowing hair. 
We met again, twits in a 
set, 
At the colored waiter's ball, 
As I 
baIniced across her eye I 
met, 
I 
really thought Pd fall; 
The music stopped, I 
stepped aside 
To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I 
really tried, 
The girl with the !lowing hair. 
Oh! my heart, Ps.,e, 
Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls, 
in this town yet to be had, 
With plenty 01 silks and curls, 
Bat she's the only one I 
love, 
Id tell her if I 
dare, 
She's sweet to me us the turtle dove, 
The girl with the !lowing hair.

Oh, tell me, darling, that you love rue,

Take my greenbacks, Molly darling, 
Don't turn up to aza your nose.

Molly, fattest, fairest, huggest,

You still love me, Molly darling, 
Don't despise me 'cause I'm fat. 
When we're married, Molly darling, 
And you are my loving spoase, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing tag around the house; 
You must give them paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
Should they annoy you, Moi.y darling. 
Gently put on them a

published in D. W. IIiteheock's Half Dime series 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em'rald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodlan0 dells, 
Mera'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature love's all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev'ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there 2 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'cl shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mueross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's spara 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daft' the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were mere fair, 
Ceauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that slcp.

THE DUBLIN MINCING MASTER,

IN Dublin city once there lived, 
A

He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster--
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Dancin' master.

Go a

The Dublin Dancin' masther, oh ! 
M'Carthy, allow me to in throduce to yer notice 
6fr. Cornelius Fitzpelthers Fitzfoozie O'Shaughnessy, a 
new pu-

Och, how ho you do, sir, you're a 
pupal' ve had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you, sir, yo

yourself in better lamas for the practice cf 
our feet. 
This is 
something of your style of dancin' I 
presume sir? ( Dances a 
Spanish waP:z.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
All, sir, I'm afeard you'll nivir make a dancer; your 
legs are not fellows; however, I'll see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies.

MUSIC 
published by E. H. Hard. 
COME all you tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue' sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of 
the Bugaboo. 
(*Repeat 
The day when first I 
joinecl her she lay in James street Canal ; 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape 
never shall, 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead, for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
['Repeat, 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plow the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
trne,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the Cap-
tuba of the Bugaboo. 
(*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the darl, 
blue sky, 
So the second ina`e gave order-4 
to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down Lelow was F.: moking in his bed—be 
set fire to the Bugaboo. 
[*Repeat. 
When the ;aptain found what he had done, he loud for help 
did shout, 
He called up through the chimney top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out: 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And 'the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they could'nt save the Bugaboo.

'When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
'The fire it bnrned s ) hard one night, that it could'nt burn 
anymore; 
So the captain he gave orders to 1 ) wer the boats and save the 
crew,* 
-While a 
1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered In

As sung by "Mickey Mullan, the great patteu Vocalist. 
When I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me ; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me ; 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigg0 it with Judy O'Ca-
lagan, 
• 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra,. 
nigan. 
SPOKEN 
Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six 
;reet five, andtas fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's 
walk—people used to take me for the Brigadier.--He used to 
come into my mothers sheebin shop every morning for a 
nog_ 
gin of whisky, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in 
and the battles he was'n't in ; about the Generals ho killed 
1,nd the Generals that killed him, -until he had me as full of 
.military ardor as an egg is full of meat. 
One morning he 
said tome, " Paddy," said he, " will you take a 
shillings farth ?" 
Said I, I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute. " Oh," said 
he, " you don't understand me, the Qu'eii wants men." Well, 
said I, I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the 
Queen. " No, no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you 
'list ?" 
I 
don't mind if I 
do, said I. 
So I 
donned the regi, 
mentals and off- I 
started to his 
Cr:coitus.

Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
wai footing 
it ; 
But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, your'e put-
ting your foot in it; 
Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Ca-
lagan ; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in my eye, to go marching with Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOZEN :—We were all drawn up in rasp and file—or rank 
and file as the Brigadier called it. 
One fine morning I 
walked 
over to him as polite as you please. Good morning, your ho-
nor, said I, would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater 
this morning ? " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the 
road we started to a 
sheebin shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. 
I 
was pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug 
out of my hand. " Hould on, Paddy; me boy," said he, "dis-
cipline among the men. 
The privates are never allowed to 
drink, while the officers are around." He put the mug to his 
mouth and divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in 1" he 
cried. Arrah, we'll not fall out, said I. " Stand at ase I" How 
can I 
when there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot. 
" 
Forward, march !" I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, 
he drew his sword and hit me with thee lt øf it across tag hi/5(1 
which made me limp of to his 
Rub a 
dub &c. 
Soon into battle we went, where the bullets were shooting and 
flying sure; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying sure; 
57 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy 
O'Calagan 
With the Brigadiee's head it made free, faith it finished 
Brigadier Branig,an. 
SPokEN:—Yes, there we stood, Murphy en one side, I 
on 
the other and the Brigadier in the middle, when a_long came a 
bombshell, taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah!" 
cried Murphy. raising his hand, " We're free at last ! " when 
along came another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand! I've 
lost me hand !" 
Hould your gab, you black-guard, said I, 
i.tre's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
-- *out it. 
I 
went over to where he was lying. 
Are you kilt, said 
he didn't condescend to speak to me. 
If you have any request 
to make, said I. if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you. 
"Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and 
spachless. and if you have any regards for me, you'll be afther 
going over the field and looking for my head, place it on 
my 
shoulders, and see me buried daeentiy." 
I'll do that same 
said I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last 
I 
came to it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whisky. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. 
I 
brought it over to him. There's your head, said 
f. " No, Paddy, that's not ray head," Yes it is, said I, " No, 
it's not," said he, Well, head, or no head, said I,Divil another 
head you'll get from me! So I 
threw his head in his face and 
I 
ran off singing

My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh I 
Nicottemus, 
Ile's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea ; 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched yon will be. 
CHOECOL 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Nicodemus I 
Nicodemus! don't you go away ? 
I've loved you Nicodernn,4 and I've loved you many a 
day. 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fnAian coat, 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SpoxEs.) And again she bogan to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas 
Think of this well: Nicodemus I 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
Sc' ,Q.lo said, &c. 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh. NimcIzzust 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You van't run away there's no back door z 
Reef the anchor, Nicoderaus, the Captain he will say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay 
So she said, &-c. 
This is what he said--
It's no use you talking to me; said Nieodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoing out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh, Nicoderaus, 4c,

I 
sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt when first 
ren in love,

had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
Cifours. 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left inc 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the flees, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel th,4 
way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own. 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you fe& 
that way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
The old man said that we might wed sad so he crowned ou 
bliss, 
hnd I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pas; a
