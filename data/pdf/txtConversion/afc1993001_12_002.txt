GENERAL DESCRIPTION
 
"Chae-il Han-in Hak-kyo," the First Korean School, is located in Silver
 
Spring, Maryland in the annex and basement classrooms of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church.
 S
ituated along Georgia Avenue approximately f
ive miles
 
outside of the capitol beltway surrounding Washington, D
.C., the church
 
is in the midst of the Maryland suburbs.  Korean lettering on a s
ign in
 
front is the only suggestion of the church's ethnic identity.
 
The school meets every Saturday from 9
:30 AN to 1
:00 PM and parallels
 
the American public school calendar.  No classes are held during the
 
summer, and American holidays are celebrated as well as Korean ones.
 
Students enroll by semester and receive report cards and certificates of
 
acheivement at the end of the school year.
 
Over 150 kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and high school
 
students attend the school.  A faculty of 1
3 teachers and 2 administrators
 
(1 principal and 1 administrative assistant) teach the classes in Korean
 
language, music, dance, and martial arts.  The main emphasis of the school
 
is on the Korean language, but other subjects are offered to attract the
 
childrens' interest and provide more exposure to Korean culture and values.
 
Classes preparing high school students for the SAT test are also offered
 
through the school.
 
Although the school is independent from the church, church members
 
play important roles in the administration and policy making of the
 
school.
 The school is currently self-supporting, earning funds for
 
faculty salaries and supplies from the students' tuition fees.
 
The school is the largest Korean language school in the Washington
 
area even though it is fairly new.
 Its growth is due to various dynamics
 
in the Korean community in the Maryland suburbs as well as to the hard
 
2
 
work of the school administrators.
 In general, the success of the school
 
reflects the success of the Korean community in adapting to American
 
l
ife and their awareness of and pride in their ethnic heritage.

PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL
  
The primary purpose of the First Korean School is to create
 
good Korean-American citizens.
 Teaching Korean language is a way of
 
achieving that end.
 It is also a means of transmitting knowledge of and
 
appreciation for Korean cult ure.
 With such understanding, children deve-
lope
 
Noh,  the sixth grade teacher and a board member,  explains:
 
I feel I found the reason is actual need.
 First,  their
 
mother tongue, Korean is needed as a tool Of communiCaLion
 
between generations.
 Sometimes,  the first generation and
 
second generation .
.. find a gap (in) communicating with
 
each other later on.
 Then, make kind of tragedy in the
 
immigration family.
 So we worry about (it).
 Their mother
 
tongue is basically a tool of communication in the immi-
grant family.
 
Second reason is (
it provides a) kind of cultural resource .
..
 
Also, we don't want to forget (Korean heritage).  We don't
 
have to get out of that kind of cultural resource.  That means
 
that (
it) is a kind of mission of the f
irst generation.
 
The third point (
is) I think the second generation who (
are)
 
born in America will f
ind themselves a l
ittle bit different
 
from (
the) major (
ethnic) group in the adolescent age period.
 
At that t
ime, they need some integration in their personality,
 
or some identity in their origin.  S
o anytime they try to
 
seek some f
amily system, their roots, their cultural origin,
 
if they got some kind of cultural resources from t
heir f
irst
 
generation or f
amily .
.. they make use of those kinds of re-
s
ources in the integration of t
heir personality .
..
 
F
acilitating communication between generations is a major concern of
 
the Korean S
chool.  l
anguage is not the only barrier between p
arents and
 
children; differences in values and attitudes also create problems.  Mr.
 
J
the 
I
principal, 
s
tory in a school publication was misunderstood by t
he students.

The horse continued o
n, carrying him to the shop.
 When he awoke and found
 
himself there, he realized that he had become addicted to wine.  He then
 
killed his horse and began leading an upright life.
 Eventually, he became
 
a great general.
 
Mr. Lee explained that the moral of this story is that one must dis-
pose of bad influences if one wants to succeed in life.
 The horse was
 
aiding the general's addiction and, therefore, had to be killed.  The
 
Korean parents recognized this moral and agreed with it.
 Their children,
 
however, failed to see the point of the story and called the general bad
 
and silly for killing his horse.
 
Lee hopes that the Korean School will help the children understand
 
their parents' attitudes and values.
 He recognizes that the children may
 
not agree with those values, but at least they will know what they are,
 
and later, perhaps, will choose to accept them.
 
S
ince the school's purpose extends beyond s
imply transmitting language
 
skills, its curriculum includes other aspects of Korean culture.  Music,
 
dance and martial arts are offered to every student, and lectures on
 
Korean history and customs are often included in the language classes.
 
The school also considers the immediate welfare of Korean-American
 
children.
 SAT classes are offered through the school that help high sclio
 
students prepare for college entrance exams, and the administration hopes
 
t
o offer similar courses on other subjects in the future.
 
Mr. Koh, the vice principal, summarizes the purpose of the school in
 
an anecdote:

If you buy a ticket--airplane, bus, train--from here [Wash-

In life,  [
one has] only one chance.
 If [
one has] a big
 
goal,  [
one] can go far.
 If have small goals, only go a small
 
distance.
 
So.. .Korean school tries to give students big goals.
 
(ES82 -LL-1U6)
 
The First Korean School was established June 5,  1977 by the First
 
Korean Baptist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland.
 On April 10,  1979,  the
 
school was incorporated in the state of Maryland and became independent
 
of the Church.
 As of Spring 1982,  the school maintains relations with
 
the church but is growing increasingly independent in financial and policy
 
matters.  It is also growing in size and reputation.
 
The school was created by a small group of Korean immigrants living
 
in the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C.
 Mr. Han—Il Lee, current
 
principal, initiated the idea and spearheaded the organization of the
 
school.
 He was aided by a school boardW

Korean School, which was created in 1970 and is the oldest Korean school
 
in the Washington area, provided an example of an established school.
 
leaders.
 Before he started the school, Mr. Lee sought advice from a
 
educat ion
The Korean Embassy's office of

S
 
(
the one now used as the church education building), and allowed the
 
school the use of this building free of charge.  Utilities were included
 
in the use of the building.
 The church considered this aid as a service
 
to the Korean community.
 There was also a mutual working relationship
 
between the church and school since members of the church were heavily
 
involved in the school.
 
The school also received minimal support from the Korean Embassy's
 
office of education in the form of free textbooks.  Although the Embassy
 
also provides funding for administrative costs to Korean schools requesting
 
such aid, the First Korean School was ineligible at first because of its
 
connection with the Korean Baptist Church.  The Embassy cannot support
 
church sponsored schools since the Korean government does not claim an
 
official religion.  When the school later became independent, its ar
ni:it-
strators did not request funding from the Embassy since they felt th
 
tuition payments sufficed for the school's administrative needs.  The
 
Embassy did, however, donate a large library of Korean literature, both
 
for adults and children.
 
In the first years of existence, the school was run primarily by
 
Mr. Han-Il Lee.
 He decided the curriculum, designed the class structure
 
and schedule, and made and printed the handouts used in all the classes.
 
He was also the f
irst principal of the school.
 His official duties
 
involved working closely with the board on policy matters, budget deci-
sions, and faculty hiring.  Mr. Han-Il Lee remained principal for two
 
years.
 In 1979, he was replaced by Dr. Lee, associate pastor of the First
 
Korean Baptist Church and holder of a Ph.D.  After one year Dr. Lee re-
turned to Korea to teach in a university.
 H
is place was then filled by
 
Mr. Park Hee Kyu, the former chief of education at the Korean Embassy.
 
S
 
Mr. Park was principal for only several months.
 The post was then
 
returned to Mr. Han-Il Lee who is the current principal.
 
The job of vice principal was not formally established until the
 
1
981-l982 school year when Mr. Han-Il Lee requested it.
 The f
aculty
 
then elected one of its members, Mr. Koh.
 Prior to this t
ime, Mr. Lee

rincipal when he was not principal.
 During such t
imes,
 
)
een primarily a political figurehead, while the details
 
of running the school were the reponalbility of the vice principal.
 
These changes in personnel have not meant changes in policy; the
 
board has retained its authority over such matters throughout the school's
 
history.
 The different principals did, however, make changes in teaching
 
materials, schedules, and details of administrating the school.
 
The school board has the responsibility of selecting the principal.
 
In general, they choose individuals who are respected members of the
 
community and who have academic and professional reputations.  Mr. Han-Il
 
Lee emphasized that he lacks the formal education to hold such a posi-
tion, but that no one else is available.
 He is actively looking for
 
another person to t
ake on the role.
 
The first board of the school consisted of seven to nine members:
 
the pastor, the DCE (Director of Christian Education), and chairman of
 
the parents' organization from the First Baptist Church, Mr. Han-Il Lee,
 
and several other individuals who were leaders in and representatives of
 
the Korean community.
 Some were also specialists in relevant f
ields.
 
About fifty percent of the board were church members.  Most were also
 
parents.  The board was divided evenly between U
.S. citizens and recent
 
immigrants.
 
The chairman of the board was Dr. Lee, a professor at Howard
 
9
 
University.  Mr. Pae, a computer programmer who had been in the country
 
over 15 years, and Mr. Park, chief of the Embassy's education office,
 
were also members.
 
S
ince its creation, the board has always included three official
 
members:
 the reverend, the DCE, and the president of the parents asso-
ciation from the First Korean Baptist Church.  The other four or f
ive
 
positions have been filled by a number of individuals.
 Some of the
 
original members have moved away; others no longer have the time to
 
belong.  Mr. Han-Il Lee is no longer a member.
 
The first board was chosen by Mr. Han-Il Lee and the leaders of the
 
First Korean Baptist Church.
 They purposely selected a mixture of back-
grounds in order to insure a concensus of public opinion.
 
In the first year, the faculty consisted of six teachers.  Mrs. Kwun
 
taught music; Mr. Kim taught taekwondo (martial arts) and; Mr. Han-11 Lee,
 
Miss Kwak, Mr. Chang, and Miss Pak taught the language classes.  Mr. Chang
 
and Mrs. Kwun have since moved away, and only Mr. Kim and Miss Kwak still
 
teach at the school: Mr. Kim for the high school class and Miss Kwak in
 
the fourth grade.  Mr. Lee, the principal, does not teach except as a
 
substitute.
 
The first teachers taught on a volunteer or near volunteer basis.
 
The administration found, though, that the faculty treated their duties
 
more seriously if they were paid.
 S
alaries were then instituted.
 The
 
teachers were also given more responsibility over their classes.
 
The first teachers were all chosen by the board.  The principal now
 
holds that responsibility.
 
Forty-five students registered in the f
irst year, of which approxi-
mately 30 to 35 attended regularly.
 The student body included children
 
10
 
from the local Korean community as well as from the First Korean Baptist
 
church.  The school publicized its opening in Korean-American newspapers
 
to reach children outside the church.  All the students paid a tuition of
 
$60.00 per semester, almost the same tuition charged now.
 
The students were tested and then placed into three different levels
 
of language skills.  These classes cut across age and school grade, put-
t
ing seventh graders with first graders.
 The students disliked this mix-
ture and, the following year, the school changed to a class system corres-
ponding with American school grades.
 
From the very beginning, the school has included music and martial
 
arts along with language classes.
 Dance was added several years ago, and
 
this past year, a special class for children with little or no background
 
in Korean was created as an experiment.
 Classes were also established to
 
prepare high school students to take SAT college entrance exams.
 
On April 10, 1979, the School was incorporated in the State of
 
Maryland.
 Until this time, the school was closely connected with the
 
church in f
inancial and policy matters.
 The school was now declared
 
independent of the church although it remained in the church buildings
 
and maintained a close relationship with individual church members and
 
staff.  About one half of the present faculty and student body are mem-
bers of the church.
 
In 1980 a new church building was constructed by the church members.
 
The old building was then designated as the education building to be used
 
for Sunday school classes, the Korean school, and other community activi-
t
ies held by the church.
 Having a place of its own has made a tremendous
 
difference for the Korean school.  Most of the other Korean schools
 
S 
1

S
 
borrow rooms from American churches or other organizations.
 Having its
 
own facilities  means that the school can handle more students.
 I
t also
 
means that a library is possible since storage is no problem.
 
The school keeps no formal record of its history other than progress
 
records of each student and minutes of board meetings.
 The church includes
 
the bare f
acts about the school in an outline of its own history, but
 
does not provide details.  Most of the history is retained in the memo-
ries of those individuals, such as Mr. Lee, who were there from the
 
beginning.
 
The school graduated its f
irst student in spring, 1982.
 The graduate
 
was pointed out to me as one of the few students who was aware of her
 
ethnic heritage and showed an active interest in learning Korean language
 
and history.  Part of her interest sprung from a desire to speak Korean
 
with other Korean and Korean-American students in college.  Apparently,
 
the active Korean organizations in several American universities use
 
Korean as their working language.
 The student recognized that if she
 
wanted to belong in such organizations, she needed the language skills.
 
Two teachers have been with the school since its beginnings.  Mr.
 
Kim, the high school teacher, has not seen noticeable changes in attitudes
 
among the students or Korean community.  He attributes the tremendous
 
growth of the school to the passage of time rather than to an increasing
 
awareness of ethnicity.  He feels that the parents are so busy the f
irst
 
years of living in the U.S. that they have no t
ime for luxuries like the
 
Korean school.
 They are only too aware of their Korean heritage and feel
 
that their primary goal is survival in this strange land.  After getting
 
established they are able to afford t
ime and expense of teaching their
 
children about their heritage.

The administration also feels that the expanding bus route has helped
 
attract students whose parents lack the t
ime, means, or initiative to
 
In
 in
 
't
ans for the future of tne school include adding subjects to t
he
 
uluni and expanding the extracurricular program.  Mr. Lee is pre-
sently searching for someone to direct a school and community orchestra.
 
He also hopes to offer classes that provide technical training that will
 
provide useful job skills, such as automobile maintenance or printing.
 
Several members of the school's faculty are presently working with a
 
national association of Korean education leaders to design textbooks suit-
able for Korean-American students.
 They hope that these will be ready
 
for publication within the next one or two years.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL
  
The school holds its classes in the First Korean Baptist Church.
 
The church consists of two main buildings.
 The main sanctuary, church
 
administrative offices, kitchen, reception area, and some classrooms are
 
in a building built in 1980.
 The second building is an older one bought
 
from another church.  Now called the education building, it also includes
 
a smaller sanctuary, kitchen, and classrooms.
 The school uses both of
 
these buildings.  Grades kindergarten through third, the special class,
 
and karate are all held in the education building.
 That building also
 
functions as the main building for the school since the room used as a
 
faculty lounge, administrative office, and supply storeroom is there.
 
Snack time is always held in the kitchen of this building, and school
 
assemblies meet in its sanctuary.
 
The church grounds also include an old house, a small playground
 
and an extensive parking lot.
 The basement of the house has been f
illed
 
with shelves to store the library donated by the Korean embassy. On
 
S
aturdays, the playground is often used by the younger students, while
 
the older ones often play in the parking lot.  A basketball hoop at one
 
end usually occupies the boys, and the girls often sit around picnic
 
t
ables in a shaded area.
 
The church provides the classrooms and other f
acilities free of
 
charge.
 I
t also covers all utilities.
 
The school has never requested monetary aid from sources outside the
 
Korean community.
 The Korean Church has been the primary source of aid,
 
but the Korean Embassy, which does provide funding for schools, has been
 
asked for help in only minimal ways.  Many Koreans seem to feel strongly
 
about earning their own way in life and do not like the idea of receiving
 
1
4
 
aid from public sources.
 This, it seems, is partly because they f
eel it
 
night undermine their own initiative and hard working attitudes but also
 
e they would then feel indebted to that source.
 
he school is now f
inanced by the students'  tuitions.
 Seventy per-
1L
 if  these monies go to faculty salaries.
 The other thirty percent
 
covers supplies and miscellaneous expenses, such as the end of year awards
 
and certificates and the handouts used in every classroom.
 These are
 
printed at cost at the principal's print shop.
 
Textbooks were donated by the Korean Embassy.
 Children use them in
 
class but do not buy them or take them home since the supply is not re-
newed every year.
 
Each student pays $60.00 per semester.
 D
iscounts are given to f
ami-
lies having more than one child enrolled: 10¼ for two children; and 30%
 
for three or more.
 Scholarships or remissions of tuition are available
 
to needy children.  Children adopted into American or Korean-American
 
f
amilies are also eligible for scholarships.  Beginning next year, Mr.
 
Lee hopes to offer a reduced tuition to children of mixed marriages.
 
A minimal snack fee is also charged which covers the juice and
 
doughnuts or fruit that are served every Saturday morning.
 Children who
 
ride the school vans pay an additional fee each month for that privelege.
 
The fee differs according to the distance from the child's home to the
 
school and is between five and ten dollars.  These payments cover the
 
cost of gas, van maintenance, and labor.  Karate uniforms and dance leo-
t
ards are also extra.
 
Teachers are paid an average of $8.00 an hour for 4 hours of teach-
ing each Saturday.  The pay is scaled according to experience and train-
ing.  The principal pointed out that this fee hardly covers the preparation
 
S
 
S

t
ime and the amount of effort and experience put into actual teaching:
 
"the teachers are really volunteers.  The salary doesn't
 
pay for anything--except gas money.
 So the teachers have
 
to have a real [
committment]."
 (ES82-LL-R22)

Some of the teachers double as drivers for the three school vans.
 
They are paid extra by the hour.  While I was visiting the school, Mr.
 
Kim, Mr. Pak, and Mr. Lee were the regular drivers.  Mr. Koh sometimes
 
substituted for them.
 
The church owns one of the vans and lends it to the school.
 The
 
other two are privately owned: one belongs to Mr. Pak, the other to Mr.
 
Lee.  The school also owns its own bus but uses it only when a sizeable
 
number of students need transportation for a school activity.
 For the
 
present the vans are adequate for transporting the students on Saturday.
 
The Korean school also runs SAT courses to prepare high school stu-
dents for the college entrance exams.  These classes are taught at night
 
at the church by American teachers brought in from a local high school.
 
The students pay $7.50 an hour for the two sessions twice a week.  That
 
fee covers the salaries of the teachers and any additional expenses.
 
Two institutions administer the school--a school board and a team
 
consisting of the principal and vice principal.
 The board consists of
 
eight or nine individuals.  The board determines the overall budget and
 
policy matters such as emphasis of the curriculum.
 The principal decides
 
most of the details of administration--hiring, break down of budget,
 
class schedules, school calendar--and provides a broad outline of skills
 
and knowledge to be taught to each class during semester.
 
The role of the vice principal is not clearly defined but seems to
 
be mostly an assistant to the principal in the more mundane matters of
 
1
6
 
actually administrating the school.
 
An administrative assistant also works at the school but seems to
 
have no part in the decision making of the administration.
 During the
 
1981-1982 school year, Miss Yun had this role.
 She usually spent every
 
S
aturday in the faculty lounge where she was ready to take care of any
 
problems that may arise.
 She was also in charge of snacks for the children
 
and coffee for the faculty.
 Usually, a volunteer mother or a teacher
 
helped in serving the snacks.  Miss Yun also kept track of the supplies
 
--paper products, pencils, crayons, etc. and the printed handouts.
 
A parents organization also exists but is not very active.
 I
t seems
 
to be associated with the First Korean Baptist Church as well as with the
 
school.  A meeting of the organization was held this past year to discuss
 
the role of the Korean School and current concerns of the parents.

As mentioned above the school emphasizes teaching the Korean language.
 
Language skills therefore are the most prominent part of the curriculum.
 
The administration and f
aculty recognize, though, that language study
 
demands a great deal of concentration and effort on the part of the stu-
dents.
 Students tend to be bored with and restless in the language classes.
 
The faculty worries that some students may drop out because of this and
 
that the ones who stay might not cultivate a love and appreciation for
 
the Korean language.
 To insure against this happening, the principal
 
cautions the faculty to make the classes interesting and enjoyable.

.
but sometimes they [
teachers] explain in English, because,
 
if not this was, they [
students] cannot catch [understand],
 
and they hate Korean.
 So if youngest are this way [
hating
 
Korean], when they grow up, they cannot choose [
to appreciate
 
their heritage], and they will always hate Korean.
 So [we]
 
have to pay attention to make [
learning Korean] interesting.
 
(ES82-LL--R22, Mr. Lee)
 
He also includes extracurricular activites such as dance, music,
 
and martial arts in the regular schedule.
 These classes not only enter-
t
ain the students and provide a change from language study; they also
 
help teach them about Korean customs, history, and values.
 
we cannot separate cu lt ure or  some
 hi story
 or  some
 custom
 
and the language.
 So, basically, we teaching for Korean
 
tongue.  Korean writing is easy, so we push just for tongue.
 
But if we push too much, they hate Korean language.
 So,
 
first t
ime, I suggest to teachers that you have to do is en-
courage in what is interesting.  Attending here, they make
 
friend of same skin or same color so they enjoy school.
 
Then they grow up, if they have good memory,....so just keep
 
tongue...
 
(
ES82-LL-R22, Mr. Lee)
 
S
ince the school's purpose extends beyond teaching language skills,
 
it includes other activities outside of the S
aturday classes.  The SAT
 
18
 
program is one such activity.
 For two hours twice a week, high school
 
students enrolled in the program are tutored in math and English in pre-
paration for the Standard Achievement Tests given to all students wanting
 
to enter American institutions of higher learning.  The teachers are
 
brought in from a local high school.
 The program is only open to members
 
of the First Korean Baptist Church.  The program has been highly success-
ful, and there is now a waiting list for openings.
 
For the Saturday language school, students are divided into classes
 
by their grade in American school.
 Eight such grade-classes exist: kin-
dergarten, first through sixth, junior high, and senior high school.
 
Another class, called the Special Class, provides children of any grade
 
with remedial help in reading and writing Korean and basic vocabulary.
 
Occasionally, a child will be placed in a higher or lower grade if
 
he or she displays the need.
 In general, though, teachers try to keep
 
the children in their respective American grades.
 No standard tests are
 
given to students to assess their ability or skills.  E
ach teacher is
 
responsible for monitoring the progress of their students.
 This system
 
of grouping the students means that a wide range of abilities will be
 
displayed in a single class.
 Each class, then, can be divided informally
 
into three levels with assignm ents geared towards those levels.
 It is
 
the teacher's option, however,  to structure their class in this way and
 
to place the students.
 
These basic classes focus on Korean language skills: reading, writing,
 
vocabulary, grammar and conversation.
 Reading usually involves handouts
 
and textbooks although teachers often write sentences and phrases on the
 
blackboard. Students are often called on to read out  loud.
 To help build
 
confidence and to provide variety, some teachers have their students read
 
1
9
 
S
 
S
 
out loud together in groups.
 
To practice writing in Korean, students usually copy texts from the
 
board or from printed sources.
 Quizzes which combine dictation and spel-
ling skills are sometimes given.
 S
tudents are usually given homework
 
that involves various writing exercises.
 
The students learn new vocabulary words through most of their lessons
 
but each class usually focuses on vocabulary exercises sometime during
 
the day.
 Such lessons often involve the use of English--either in expla-
nation of the words or in the students' answers.
 
Korean conversation supposedly happens throughout the day, but some
 
teachers put aside specific blocks of time for talking with t
 
in Korean.  This was done in the third grade class by the tea
 
students questions in Korean and encouraging the students to answer in
 
the same language.
 
Reading lessons often include traditional Korean stories.  During
 
one fourth grade class, students took different characters in a story and
 
read those parts out loud.
 Teachers also read the stories to the students
 
and use them for a Korean question and answer session.  Korean literature,
 
however, is not included in the curriculum as such.  One teacher expressed
 
a desire to do so, but said that the students do not speak Korean well
 
enough to appreciate it.
 
Korean history and culture are also included informally, but are not
 
given a major part of the class schedule.
 In the older classes, teachers
 
sometimes give lectures in Korean on those subjects, but teachers for the
 
younger students tend to incorporate history and culture into reading and
 
writing exercises.
 Several teachers expressed regret at not being able to
 
devote more time to Korean studies.
 There is too l
ittle time, though, even
 
20
 
for the primary t
ask of teaching Korean language.
 
All the teachers use the standardized Korean textbooks donated by
 
the Korean embassy, but most of them feel that they are inadequate for
 
Korean-American students.  The subjects, people, and places mentioned in
 
these texts tend to be foreign to the experiences of the children, and
 
therefore irrelevant.
 
Our situation is different, everyday life, thinking, every-
thing is different for students here from the textbooks.
 So
 
they need something they know.
 
(EX82 -LL-R8)
 
Most of the teachers design their own handouts to supplement the
 
textbooks.  They also write their own tests and quizzes.
 In this way,
 
the classes are directed towards the individual skills and interests of
 
each class.  Also, a reservoir of teaching materials is gradually being
 
-
pends on the teacher.
 In most of the classes, assignments involve some
 
t 1 7 e
 of writing exercise.
 
Some teachers include lectures and discussions on ethnicity in their
 
classes.
 Such topics are difficult to f
it into the curriculum, though,
 
s
ince most of the students lack the vocabulary to understand complex
 
ideas in Korean.

 If [we]  talk completely in Korean, they

cussions of ethnicity when they come from outsiders rather than members
 
of the Korean community.  Thus far, he has invited two men, one Finnish-
American and the other Polish, to talk to his students about maintaining
 
their ethnic identities.  The response has been positive:
 
• . .kids are very interested about that.  Because if [
I] push
 
myself, they very [much] hate or are against [

(ES82-LL-R22, Mr. Lee)
 
The school day is broken into five 45 minute periods, three of which
 
are spent in the language homeroom classes.
 The other two are used for
 
music and dance or martial arts.  Usually girls take dancing and boys
 
take martial arts, but a few girls choose the latter.  For the extra-
curricular classes, students are divided into three groups: kindergarten
 
through second grade: third through f
ifth; and sixth through high school.
 
In this way, each teacher has three periods a day, but the extracurricular
 
teachers have different groups of children for each period.  The language
 
teachers have the same students throughout, much like a homeroom situa-
t
ion in an American school.
 
The three periods in the language class are utilized individually by
 
each teacher.
 Depending on the age and attention span of their students,
 
the teachers distribute the various language skills between the three
 
periods. (For more detail on structure of individual classes, see the
 
fieldnotes.)
 
Most of the teachers state that the actual amount of knowledge and
 
language skills a student has is not as important as the progress a child
 
makes and the attitudes he has towards his ethnic identity.
 They feel,
 
22
 
though, that the students work better if they receive some type of reward,
 
whether positive or negative.  Most of the teachers give tests and quizzes
 
in class and grade homework.  At least one teacher, however, expressed
 
reluctance to do so.
 
They are so busy, and they are just little children.
 I
 
want to give them too much work because if I do, they will
 
have no time to play, and they will hate Korean school.

At the end of the school year, every student receives a report card
 
recording his grades.  Certificates of achievement are given to students
 
who have done especially well.  At the graduation ceremony in 1982 the
 
names of those students receiving certificates were read to the audience
 
while the students stood and were applauded.
 One child was given an award
 
for being the best student in the school.
 
When students graduate from American school, they also are graduated
 
from Korean school regardless of how much Korean language they know.  At
 
hat time they receive a diploma certifying that they have attended
 
K
orean language school.
 
While s
tudents i

t
end t
o have t
heir own reward systems.
 Students who excel in music can
 
join the children's choir that is sponsored by the Korean Baptist Church.
 
The choir has numerous performance engagements and participation in it
 
demands a strong commlttment as well as a good voice.  The martial arts
 
class follows a system used by all Karate schools in which different col-
ored belts represent each level of achievement: the highest being a
 
black belt, and the lowest being white.
 
The school calendar parallels the one used by American public schools.

The school year begins in the fall, usually September, and ends in early
 
summer, usually June.  The principal usually plans for forty saturdays of
 
school with perhaps f
ive or six holidays.
 
American public holidays such as Memorial Day and Labor Day are
 
kept, and Christian holidays--Christmas and Easter--are marked by vaca-
tions.  Teachers usually have parties or special activities in their
 
classrooms for such days, but these are left up to the teachers.
 The
 
only holidays celebrated by the entire school are two Korean ones: Chusok,
 
the harvest festival, and the Korean Independence Day on March 1
.
 These
 
are celebrated by school assemblies and parties.

FACULTY
  
The number of teachers tends to fluctuate during the school
 
year.  Most of the teachers are extremely busy and can barely afford the
 
time the school requires.  Many hold two jobs or run family businesses.
 
In the months I visited the school several transitions were made.  A
 
woman teacher, wife of a minister, left because of lack of t
ime.
 The
 
Karate teacher, a Mexican, was replaced by a Korean man. Two new teachers
 
came on while I was there--Mr. Koh's daughter and Mr. Noh.  The list on
 
the following page provides the current teachers at the end of the 1981-
1982 school year.
 
The school does not provide any training for its teachers nor does
 
it have set requirements in experience and training for hiring.
 The
 
administration tries to select teachers with previous training and experi-
ence, but at least two of the current teachers have only minimal formal
 
training.
 
In general the teachers are overqualified for elementary and middle
 
school teaching.  At least seven out of twelve have formal training in
 
education; one from an American university, the others from Korean insti-
tutions.  All of them have some experience working with children.
 The
 
kindergarten teacher was principal of an elementary school for 40 years;
 
Mr. Noh was on the board of education in Korea, and at least two others
 
taught in Korean schools.  Miss Koh, daughter of Mr. Koh, is now study-
ing education at the University of Maryland and works in the day care
 
center at the First Korean Baptist Church.  Mr. Choi has a degree in
 
social work and taught Karate in Korea.  Mrs. Kim's previous experience
 
was with teaching Sunday school, and Mr. Kim tutored students in agricul-
ture.

The teachers who do l
ack formal training or previous experience com-
pensate for it in understanding of and r
apport with the children and with
 
their committment to the purpose of the school.  All of the teachers
 
seemed to me to be very capable.
 
The principal, Mr. Lee Han-Il, is very proud of the f
aculty.  He
 
points to the various degrees they hold and feels they represent a high
 
caliber of education and backgrounds.
 He is also quick to point out that
 
he lacks a formal education and is reluctant to teach because of t
hat.
 
Very few of the teachers are trained specifically for language
 
teaching.
 Only one, Mr. Pak, is involved professionaly outside of t
he
 
school in such an activity.
 Some say that their previous teaching
 
helps them in dealing with the children and structuring their classes, but
 
not p
articularly with teaching Korean language.  Their task is further
 
complicated since they are trying to teach the values and heritage of a
 
culture as well as its mode of communication.
 
Teachers are given a great deal of freedom in designing the curriculum
 
and structure of their classes.
 The principal provides a general guide-
line for subjects and skills to be taught to each grade, but allows the
 
teachers to decide how to follow those guidelines.  They seem to appre-
ciate this freedom and its accompanying responsibilities.
 They feel that
 
they can adjust the curriculum, teaching methods, and class structure to
 
meet the particular needs of their students.
 They can also emphasize
 
their own t
alents and interests.
 For example, a teacher especially in-
terested in Korean history can stress that in his class.
 
This freedom seems to create a good atmosphere at the
 rhne1

one individual acts as authority and expert.
 Instead, they all work
 
together to discover the best teaching methods and materials.  The spe-
cial class is just such an attempt to determine the best approach.
 
While teaching Korean language is the primary emphasis of the classes,
 
the more immediate concerns of many of the teachers are making the classes
 
enjoyable and capturing the children's interest.  Most of them recognize
 
that learning a language is difficult and that if Korean is presented in
 
a dry and boring manner, the chilidren will not respond well.
 Their
 
attention in class would be impossible to hold and, some might beg their
 
parents to let them stay home.  Most of the teachers, then, consciously
 
try to make their classes fun.
 Some do this by presenting lessons in the
 
form of games or by changing activities whenever they sense boredom or
 
f
atigue among their students.
 Others achieve it by maintaining a relaxed
 
and cheerful atmosphere.  The high school teacher purchased ping pong
 
equipment for his class to use between breaks, and another t
akes her
 
class outside for a change of scenery.
 
Some of the teachers are also concerned about discipline in the
 
classrooms.  One felt that the children particularly the younger ones,
 
lack discipline at home and American school and need to receive a f
irm
 
hand at the Korean school.
 She also interpreted their misbehavior as a
 
lack of respect for elders and a display of rebelliion.
 Other teachers
 
tended to be more tolerant in their judgements and expectations.  Most
 
agreed that the Korean language is demanding, and that many of the chil-
dren f
ind it difficult.
 Their restlessness and boredom in class are due
 
to the nature of the subject being studied rather than a lack of discipline.
 
The second grade teacher suggested another reason behind her class'
 
somewhat boisterous behavior:
 
28
 
They feel at home here.
 They're with children who are the
 
same color, and many of them are their friends.  Everybody
 
is speaking the language they hear at home.
 Its not like at
 
American school where they feel they're alittle bit different.
 
Here they can be themselves.
 That's why they're alittle
 
noisy.
 
(
Interview with In Ok Kim, 4/3/82)
 
In my observations of the classes,  I felt that the teachers were
 
tolerant of students' behavior but not l
ax.
 They usually allowed some
 
degree of play and freedom for the students, but the classes never seemed
 
out of control.
 If the class became too noisy, they usually quieted it
 
by clapping their hands and calling for attention, speaking directly to
 
the student causing the disturbance, and, occasionally, by rapping a
 
child on the head or physically moving him to another chair or area of the
 
room.  Discipline was always administered with good humor and affection.
 
In general, the teachers seemed satisfied with the school policies
 
and structure.  The only issue of dispute among the faculty that I
 
was aware of was the use of English in the classroom.  While the classes
 
are primarily taught in Korean, some teachers use English to explain voca-
bulary words or complex concepts and to maintain the children's interest.
 
When I speak only Korean, they don; '
t understand and they
 
get bored and don't learn, but when I use English they are
 
interested and can ask questions.  Then they learn.
 
(Interview with Ok Kyung Kim, 5/22/82)
 
Most teachers, though, make a point to speak only Korean in class and
 
encourage--sometimes, admonish--the students to do likewise.
 Outside of
 
class, they usually speak to the children in Korean.
 The students will
 
respond in Korean, but most of them speak to one another in English.
 
The teachers rarely have t
ime for meetings outside of school hours.
 
Before the 1981 Fall semester began this past year, they did meet f
or a
 
day to plan the curriculum, discuss teaching methods and potential
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
probLems, and gather teaching materials.
 The principal and some of the
 
teachers agreed that more such meetings were needed, but few people can
 
afford the time.
 During the school hours, the faculty and principal
 
usually meet briefly after the morning assembly to discuss problems and
 
to pass on information.
 Teachers also meet informally during their
 
breaks in the administrative office which doubles as a f
aculty lounge.
 
While drinking coffee or tea, they can renew supplies for their classes
 
and chat with other teachers.
 
About one half of the teachers are members of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church.
 The principal states that teachers do not have to be
 
members to be qualified, but he hopes that most of the teachers in the
 
future will be church members.  Although we did not discuss the reasons
 
for this, I think he feels the f
aculty will be more in accord if they
 
are all church members.
 
The teacher's reasons for teaching at the Korean school tend to be
 
altruistic.
 The salary is too meagre to make monetary rewards a primary
 
motivation, and the mental and emotional energy required is too demanding
 
for anyone without a higher committment.
 Some of the reasons given when
 
I asked teachers about their motivations were a feeling of responsibility
 
towards the younger generation; concern for the ethnic identity of youth
 
and the possible problems resulting from a lack of it; concern for the
 
future welfare (economic, social, and emotional) of the Korean community
 
in the U.S.; and pride in and love for Korean heritage and culture.  A
 
sense of Christian duty to guide youth in the right direction, a calling
 
to teach, and a love for children were also motivations.
 
With these purposes in mind, most of the faculty said that they
 
consider their teaching to be a service to the Korean community as a
 
30
 
whole.
 They see their job as providing role models of Korean culture
 
values as well as actively teaching specific l
anguage skills.

STUDENTS
 
A directory of students' names and addresses compiled by the school
 
in the fall of 1981 lists 1
40 individual students.
 Eleven more names
 
were added by Miss Yun when I requested a copy of the directory in the
 
spring, making a total of 151 students.
 Eighty-six different families
 
are represented.  Addresses were not provided for all the students in the
 
directory, so the following statistics are not complete.
 They do, however,
 
give an idea of geographic distribution of the students' homes.
 
According to the student directory, all the students live in Maryland.
 
The following breakdown is by families not by number of students:
 
Silver Spring--29
 
Rockville--12
 
Potomac and Wheaton--7
 
Olney--5
 
Gai thersburg--4
 
Adelphi, Beltsville, Hyattsville-3
 
Takoma Park--2
 
Burtonsville, Derwood, Glen Dale, Kensington--1
 
There are no statistics available on the distribution of the Korean
 
population, so these numbers cannot be compared to the population as a
 
whole.
 It is interesting to note, though, that a good number of students
 
come from distances that are a thirty to forty-five minute drive away.
 
S
ilver Spring, which has the largest number of f
amilies, is very close
 
to the school (the school is in the Wheaton Plaza area of Silver Spring),
 
but both Rockville and Gaithersburg are a good thirty minutes drive.
 
Potomac is also quite a distance.  Most of these students ride the three
 
school vans, but some are driven there by their parents.
 Some of the
 
32
 
van routes are rather long--one of them starts two hours before classes
 
start--and the long ride apparently keeps some children away.
 
Most of these areas are suburban and middle class.
 S
ilver Spring is
 
a pleasant neighborhood of middle to upper-middle class homes.
 I
t also has
 
a good number of established home-owning Asian immigrants.
 Potomac is an
 
upper-middle to upper class area of country clubs and expensive homes.
 
That seven Korean families live there speaks well of the upward mobility
 
of the Korean population.  Most of the areas having three or less Korean
 
families sending children to the school tend to be middle to lower-middle
 
to working class.  Although I cannot compare these f
igures to overall
 
distribution statistics, the distribution of housing may suggest a
 
correspondence between wealth and awareness of ethnicity and willingness
 
to participate in an organized attempt to perserve and transmit ethnic
 
heritage.
 
Most of the students at the First Korean School are between the ages
 
of five and fourteen years old.
 There was a four year old in the kinder-
garten class and a high school senior who was about seventeen.
 There
 
were probably others that I was unaware of. (Korean ages are often
 
different from American ages.  Children are considered a year old at
 
birth, and sometimes have a second birthday on the Lunar New Year.
 
Therefore, Korean children often count their age as being one or two
 
years ahead of American children.
 In the U
.S. most Koreans go by the
 
American system.)
 
These ages correspond to American public school grades kindergar-
ten through eighth.  Most of the students are placed in classes at the
 
Korean school that parallel their grades in American school.
 I found,
 
though, that many of the children have skipped a year in American school.
 
33
 
S
 
S
 
Most of the students seemed to be full blooded Koreans.
 At least
 
two were adopted: a girl by a Korean family and a boy by an American
 
family.
 Several children come from "mixed marriages".
 One girl has a
 
Korean mother and a Chinese f
ather; a brother and s
ister have a Korean
 
mother and Black American father; and several others have American last
 
nam es.  Most of these children attended the Special Class, except the
 
younger ones who were kept with their age group.
 Their knowledge of
 
Korean was minimal but they seemed to keep up with most of the Korean
 
children in the same class.
 
Although no definitive count has been made, most of the faculty and
 
administration agreed that most of the children had either been born in
 
the U.S. or had spent a major part of their lives here.
 
All the children I observed spoke English fluently and with f
amili-
arity with schoolyard slang.  Many of them consider English their f
irst
 
language and Korean the language of their parents.
 One teacher suggested
 
that perhaps fifty percent of the children speak Korean at home.  He also
 
observed that it is more likely for a child to be f
luent in Korean if
 
there are grandparents living in the home.
 
Among themselves the students usually spoke English.
 They also
 
called each other by their American names instead of the Korean ones
 
usually used by the teachers.
 All of them wore American clothing to
 
school.  Even for special events, only very young children and adults
 
dressed in Korean clothing.
 In general, the students seemed very Ameri-
canized.  One teacher observed that:
 
•
 the children look Korean; have Korean skin color and
 
eyes.  But their thinking and customs are American.
 [
I]
 
think these children [
are] not Korean; they're American.
 
(
ES82-LL-Rll, Mr. Kim)
 
34
 
The majority of the students said they disliked attending Korean
 
school.  Many said that they came only because their parents made them
 
and that, if given a choice, they would stay home.
 Some students said
 
school was boring; others said it was too difficult.
 One fourth grader
 
said that learning Korean was too hard and demanded too much work.
 Seve-
ral other students complained that sitting still on Saturday morning was
 
frustrating: they were tired from a week of American school and wanted
 
to spend their time playing.
 Some also had conflicts between Korean
 
school and participating in American school or community activities, such
 
as Little League baseball.
 
Although most students said they disliked school, they seemed to have
 
fun while they were there.  Many had made friends with their classmates,
 
and they seemed to like their teachers.  They also seemed to enjoy the
 
non-language classes.  Martial arts tended to elicit a great deal of enthu-
siasm.
 
Some students said they did not understand why they should learn
 
Korean.
 They felt that Korean language was irrelevant to their l
ives
 
beyond enabling them to understand their parents.
 D
iscussions on ethnic
 
identity were of little interest to them.
 
Most of the students, though, seemed very aware of t
heir "Korean-
ness" and tended to accept their ethnic heritage in a matter of f
act way.
 
One teenager said that it was impossible not to acknowledge his heritage
 
because he looks so different from most Americans.
 He feels like an
 
American, eats American food, has American friends, and speaks English
 
fluently.  But he knows that some aspects of his life differ greatly from
 
the lives of his friends.  For example, he likes Korean food just as much
 
as American food.  When he marries he wants to marry a Korean so that his
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
35
 
wife can prepare Korean food.
 
Nevertheless, Korean and Korean-American children tend to easily f
it
 
into American ideals of success and behavior.  Many of them excel in Ameri-
can schools, and many plan on continuing their education at the most pres-
tigious insituttions--Harvard, Colombia, MIT.
 This striving towards suc-
cess is partly out of respect to their parents' wishes: many of them see
 
their parents working long hours and sacrificing their own careers and
 
interests for their children's futures.  The children see this and want to
 
live up to their parents' expectations.

PARENTS
 
The reason most often given by parents for sending their children
 
to the school is that it would be a shame for thee not to know their own
 
heritage.  Most felt that when the child had grown up, he would appreci-
ate the school.
 They also recognized, though, that for the present the
 
children did not like attending classes or learning Korean.
 
Reasons for not sending children to Korean school included the long
 
bus ride and a concern that they, the parents, were demanding too much
 
from their children.
 They wanted the Korean school to be a good experi-
ence, and felt that pushing the child too hard might have a negative
 
reaction.  Another said that his children had all attended school through
 
sixth grade in Korea so that Korean language was f
irmly implanted in
 
their minds.  They now needed to spend their time learning English and
 
doing homework for American school.  Also they already had Korean friends
 
so the Korean school offered nothing they were missing.
 
Parents involvement with their children's progress at Korean school
 
was difficult for me to assess.
 S
ince the vans provide transportation
 
for children from most of t
he surrounding suburbs, parents need not
 
sacrifice a S
aturday morning for their children's education.  Most of
 
the p
arents who do drive their children to school, drop them off in the
 
morning and pick them up in the afternoon, returning home or running
 
errands in the meantime.  One mother waited at the school for her chil-
dren every Saturday and worked as a volunteer, either substitute teaching
 
or helping Miss Yun give out snacks.
 She said it was too f
ar for her to
 
go home, and she wanted to help in any way she could.
 
According to the f
aculty, parents often help the children with their
 
homework.
 In f
act,  the most common request was that the school give more
 
37
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
homework.
 
Many of the parents seem to know each other from Korean church or
 
other organizations in the Korean community.
 The community is spread
 
out, though, so they do not have many opportunities for social gatherings.
 
Korean parents, in general, demand a lot from their children.
 One
 
and violin lessons and requires that she practice daily on both instruments.
 
Another parent, also a teacher at the school, takes her daughter to ballet
 
and piano lessons, and girl scouts.  Both mothers also encourage their
 
children excel at school.
 
Most of the parents recognize that they have high expectations of
 
their children.
 These expectations spring from traditional Korean values
 
as well as the more immediate concerns of succeeding in a new culture.
 
In the widespread Confucian tradition of Korean, children are seen as the
 
hope of the future who carry on the name of the family.  Children, then,
 
are taught early to respect their elders and to think of their achievements
 
in terms of upholding and honoring the f
amily reputation.
 
The economic situation in Korea reinforces the child's motivation to
 
succeed.  Korea is a very small country with a large population.
 Good
 
jobs are scarce and social structures rigid.
 Competition is extremely
 
intense.  Beginning in elementary school, children compete for places in
 
the best schools.
 Stringent placement exams determine the colleges
 
available to each student and oftentimes, the college attended determines
 
the jobs an individual is offered.  Most Korean students t
ake their
 
studies very seriously, putting 1
2 to 16 hours a day into school and
 
homework.
 
When Korean families immigrate to the U
.S.,  they often maintain
 
these attitudes and study habits.
 Even if the student-age children
 
realize that most American students can pass through American public
 
schools with relative ease,  their parents still remember the schools they
 
are used to.
 
Many parents came to the U.S. in order 
 
r
u(.
)
a
prov i de their childre n
 
with opportunities they never had, or to get them away from the competitive-
ness of the Korean educational system.
 Many have sacrificed careers,
 
status, and financial stability to come here where they.take much lower
 
paying and lower status jobs.
 The children of these parents are pushed
 
to succeed in order to justify their parents'  sacrifice.
 
At the same time, many parents are so busy trying to survive that
 
they have little time to pay attention to their children's education.
 
Maintaining an ethnic identity may only be counterproductive to adjust-
ment to a new culture and is considered to be a lux u ry.
 O nce

parents are adjusted and financially secure,  they begin to

things.
 They also may realize that their children are becoming

The school recognises the need to educate the parents and make them
 
aware of this potentiol loss of ethnic identity and the problems resul , 
from it.
 The faculty and administration feel that the school alone can-
not achieve its purpose and aims without the support of the parents.

THE KOREAN COMMUNITY AND ETHNIC AWARENESS
  
The current estimate for Koreans and Korean-Americans living in the
 
U
.S. reaches 600,000.  Most of that number l
ive in three major population
 
centers: Los Angelos which has 200,000 Korean residents, Chicago, and New
 
York.
 S
an Francisco and Washington D
.C. have the next largest populations.
 
The Korean embassy estimates that between 35,000 and 40,000 Koreans live in
 
the Washington metropolitan area.
 
The majority of the Korean poulation came here within the last twenty
 
years.
 The first generation of Koreans born in the U
.S. are just now
 
coming of age.  Most Koreans immigrating to the U.S. do so by choice.
 
Exit permits are difficult to obtain.  Many come for occupational
 
or educational opportunities.  Others come to escape the competitiveness
 
and restrictions of Korean society.  Many also come to provide their
 
children with opportunities and freedoms they never knew.
 
In coining to the U
.S., they often give up good paying jobs, social
 
status, and economic security: their degrees from Korean institutions and
 
their years of experience are not honored, and many either begin again
 
or change careers.  Their f
irst years here are often spent f
ighting for
 
survival.
 
At the same t
ime, many Korean immigrants do extremely well in the
 
U
.S.
 Their hard work often pays off in economic stability after f
ive or
 
ten years.  Many own their own businesses and homes and can afford to
 
send their children to the best schools.
 
Most Koreans have a great deal of pride in their heritage.
 Their
 
history extends back 5000 years and, their culture is a sophisti-
cated one, claiming scholars and scientists as part of its past.  The
 
Korean people are also a homogenous people.
 Although Japan and China
 
40
 
used Korea as a bridge for their many disputes and often tried to subju-
gate Korea, Korean culture and the Korean race has retained a unique
 
identity.  A respect for tradition and the past is inbred in the culture.
 
On the whole, the Koreans living in the U
.S. have retained t
his cul-
tural pride.  They maintain a personal ethnic identity and have created a
 
sense of ethnic community through numerous organizations.
 Yet, most have
 
adapted to and achieved in American society.
 
The Korean population living in the Washington metropolitan area is
 
not typical of other Korean communities.
 Its members tend to have a higher
 
lever of education and income and hold more white collar jobs than
 
Koreans in other areas.
 
Higher incomes seem to mean that money is avaiable for luxuries such
 
as language schools.
 It does not necessarily mean more free time, s
ince
 
parents often work two jobs or long hours on one job to achieve the
 
higher income.
 The offspring, however, are expected to devote their
 
t
ime and energies to studies and preparation for a good future.
 
Higher education seems to also correspond with awareness of and
 
appreciation for ones' origins.
 Such individuals tend to be more suppor-
t
ive of activites l
ike ethnic schools.
 In
. the First Korean School, how-
ever, Mr. Lee, the principal and organizer of the school, has only a high
 
school education.
 
Christian churches, particularly Presbyterian and Baptist, function
 
as central social as well as religious organizations in many Korean commu-
n
ities.  The city of Washington, D
.C. has over s
ixty churches.
 These
 
churches often provide a variety of services t
o the Korean cora unity.
 
Approximately twelve sponsor or operate Korean language classes.
 
The Korean community in the Washington metropolitan area is very
 
S
 
S
 
41
 
aware of the need to educate their youth in the language and culture of
 
their heritage.
 Twenty—four language schools now exist in this area.
 
The First Korean School is the largest of these.
 
42
 
CONCLUSION
  
S
ince its creation in 1977, the First Korean School has grown appro-
ximately four t
imes its student body  and faculty
 
.At least four f
actors
 
are responsible for this growth.
 
The f
irst is the school's stated purpose, which is to produce good
 
Korean-American citizens.  While this goal is being achieved primarily
 
through Korean language classes, it is broad enough to allow expansion
 
to meet the various needs of the Korean community.
 The SAT classes are
 
an excellent example of the school extending itself beyond its immediate
 
role of language teaching.
 
A second factor is the hard work and determination of several key
 
individuals.  They initiated the idea of the school and, through much
 
work, put that idea into effect.  These individuals have also continually
 
tried to recognize the needs of the Korean community and determine ways
 
t
hat the school can be of service.
 
The growth and continued support of the First Korean Baptist Church
 
have been a third factor.
 The new sanctuary and classrooms built by the
 
church in 1980 have enabled the school to expand its classes to hold
 
more students.
 The church has also provided for rent and utilities
 
s
ince the school's creation, allowing the tuition fees to be used for
 
other expenses.
 
The fourth f
actor is the Korean community itself.  On the whole, the
 
Korean community is both conscious and proud of its ethnic identity.
 In
 
the first few years of immigration, however, most individuals must concen-
trate on adjusting to the American way of life.
 Their emphasis at that
 
t
ime focusses on adjusting to a new identity rather that maintaining an
 
old one.
 The community in the Washington area is now established enough
 
43
 
S
 
so that its members can support such luxuries as maintaining ethnic
 
heritage and language.  They have also been here long enough to realize
 
that such maintenance is not a luxury but a necessity.
 
Four of the stated hypotheses of the Ethnic Schools Project are rele-
vant to the First Korean School.  First, the school very definitely
 
reflects the concerns of the adult generation of Korean immigrants and
 
Korean-Americans.  These concerns, however, are not limited to transmission
 
of cultural heritage but include the overall immediate and future welfare
 
of Korean-American children.  Neither are these concerns limited to only
 
a select group within the Korean community.  While the actual maintenance
 
and administration of the school is achieved by a small number of indivi-
duals with various educational and occupational credentials, the larger
 
com munity displays its support of the school through the continued enroll-
ment of their children.
 
Secondly, Koreans living in the U.S. seem to have a strong sense of
 
ethnic identity.  Although there is no geographically-delineated community
 
in the Washington area, Koreans living here demonstrate a strong sense of
 
ethnic community through numerous recreation, occupational, and educational
 
organizations.  The effort to institutionalize transmission of culture is
 
not unique to a select segment of the Korean population but is widespread
 
throughout both the Washington area and the rest of the U.S.
 
A third hypothesis is that ethnic schools help instill a sense of
 
community and ethnic identity.  One of the goals of the Korean School is
 
to provide students with a knowledge of their heritage so that they will
 
have more resources from which to formulate their identity and self-image.
 
I
t is too soon to assess whether or not it is achieving that goal.
 Also,
 
instilling a sense of ethnic community does not seem to be a primary goal
 
of the school.  While maintaining the mother tongue is felt to be necessary
 
f
or communication between generations, the school does not treat it as a
 
means of binding the children into a community.  Adaptation is considered
 
to be an inevitable necessity for their children if they are to succeed
 
in this society.  A strong self identity and an appreciation for their
 
heritage will help them both adapt and succeed.
 
A final hypothesis states that the curriculum of a school reflects
 
that group's perception of its ethnic identity: the components of the
 
school curriculum correspond to the components making up their iden-
tity.  The First Korean School's stated purpose is to produce good Korean-
American citizens.
 In order to be good citizens, the children need strong
 
identities and an appreciation for their heritage.  Korean language,
 
then, is emphasized as a means of both transmitting a cultural heritage
 
and maintaining strong family ties.  Being Korean in America, however,
 
requires more than s
imply speaking the language.  An appreciation for
 
culture, both eastern and western, is considered important: music, dance,
 
and martial arts are therefore included in the school's curriculum.
 
Achievement and success are also aspects of the Korean-American identity
 
and are reflected in the school's curriculum through such things as the
 
SAT classes.
 Informally, the school encourages the students to both
 
adapt to American life and maintain an ethnic identity.
 The two are not
 
felt to be incompatible; instead, they are complementary.  According to
 
the principal of the school, the more a child understands and appreciates
 
his own ethnic heritage, the better citizen of America he will become.

"Chae-il Han-in Hak-kyo," the First Korean School,  is located in Sil-
ver Spring,  Maryland in the annex and basement classrooms of the First
 
Korean Baptist Church.
 Situated along Georgia Avenue five miles outside
 
the Washington,  D.C. beltway,  the church is in the midst of the Maryland
 
suburbs.
 Korean lettering on a sign in front is the only indication of
 
the church's ethnic identity.
 
Over 150 kindergarten,  elementary,  junior high, and high school
 
students attend the First Korean School.
 A faculty of thirteen teachers
 
and two administrators teach the classes in Korean language, music,
 
dance, and martial arts.
 The primary emphasis is on Korean language
 
(both reading and speaking), but the other subjects are included to
 
attract the children's interest and to expose them to Korean culture and
 
LIt
value s.

PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL
 
While the First Korean School identifies itself as a language school
 
for teaching the "mother-tongue" to Korean descendents, its administra-
tors state that its primary purpose is to create good Korean-American
 
citizens.  This can be done best through teaching the Korean language,
 
using as a vehicle for transmitting Korean values and beliefs as well as
 
knowlege about Korean culture and history.  They believe that the more a
 
child understands and appreciates his ethnic heritage the better person
 
he will become and the more smoothly his acculturation into American
 
society will be accomplished.  By giving him the opportunity to know his
 
background, the school provides the child with more options to choose
 
from when he begins to develop his own perspective of his ethnic identity.
 
Mr. Noh, the sixth grade teacher and a board member, explains:
 
I think the second generation who (were) born in America
 
will find themselves a little bit different from (the) major
 
(ethnic) group in the adolescent age period.
 At that t
ime,
 
they need some integration in their personality, or some
 
identity in their origin.
 So anytime they try to seek
 
some family system, their roots, their cultural origin, if
 
they got some kind of cultural resources from their first
 
generation or family.. .
they (can) make use of those kinds
 
of resources in the integration of their personality...
 
(E582-LL-R7)
 
Facilitating communication between generations is a major concern of
 
the Korean School.
 Language is often a barrier between parents and
 
N
 
children since many Korean families are recent immigrants.
 The children,
 
because of their interaction with native-born English-speakers through
 
their schooling, usually learn the language within several years of their
 
arrival, while the parents take much longer.
 Oftentimes, parents and
 
grandparents never become fluent in the language and retain the " mother-
I Jg4
 
situation also:
 
.
..their mother tongue, Korean is needed as a tool of
 
communication betwen generations.
 Sometimes,  the first
 
generation and second generation
—find a gap (in) communi-
cating with each other later on.
 Then, make kind of tra-
gedy in the immigrant family.
 So we worry about (it).
 
Their mother tongue is basically a tool for communication in

The language barrier is particularly obvious in homes where grand-
parents are living with the family.
 In Korea, it is the grandparents
 
who are responsible for teaching the customs and values to the children.

create inter-generational barriers just as troublesome as the language one.

The

story co ncer ned a famous Korean general who, in his youth, often
 
visited a wine shop.
 One day while riding his horse, he fell asleep.
 
The horse continued walking and carried him to the wine shop.
 When the
 
general awoke and found himself there, he realized that he had become
 
addicted to wine.
 He then killed his horse and began leading an upright
 
life,  eve nt ual ly

aiding the general's addiction and therefore had to be destroyed.
 Th e
 
Korean parents recognized this moral and agreed with it.
 Their children,
 
however, did not understand the story.
 Even when it was explained to
 
them,  they saw no nobility in the general's actions and felt that he was
 
cruel for needlessly killing his horse.
 
Lee hopes that the school will help the children to understand their
 
parents' attitudes and values.
 He recognizes that the children may not
 
agree with them, but at least they will know what the values are, and,
 
perhaps, later may choose to accept them.
 
Many of the adult Koreans at the school have a strong sense of their
 
own Korean identity and heritage.
 They are proud to be Korean and feel
 
strong emotional ties with their motherland.
 They also feel that an
 
appreciation for Korean ways is a valuable and precious possession, one
 
that should be passed on to future generations.
 Their involvement in the
 
school is generated partly by these attitudes:
 
*
 -
 - we don't want to forget (Korean heritage).
 We don't
 
have to get out of that kind of cultural resource.
 That
 
means that (it) is a kind of mission of the first genera-
tion.
 
- The school is concerned with both the immediate and long-term
. welfa
 
of the students and of the Korean-American community.
 It offers the
 
language classes not only to transmit knowledge of a cultural heritage,
 
but also to provide a central place where Korean-American children can b
 
with others of their background, a place where they can feel comfortn�'
..
 
and have a sense of belonging.
 By providing such a place,  the school
 
hopes that the children will maintain the relationships that begin there
 
strengthening the ties in the Korean-American community.
 
5
 
The school is also concerned with the success of the children in
 
achieving their long-term educational and professional goals, most of
 
which are set very high.
 I
t hopes to provide role models by exposing the
 
children to ethnicAmerjcans who are successful.
 I
t gives practical help
 
in these objectives by offering SAT preparation classes to high school
 
students and by teaching the children the right values.
 In terms of the
 
future welfare of the children, the administration believes that it can
 
help most by encouraging them to set high goals.
 T
he principal explains:
 
I
f you buy a t
icket--airplane, bus,  train--from here
 
(Washington) to S
an Francisco, you can get off anywhere
 
along the way.  But a ticket to New York, takes you only
 
to New York.
 In life, (one has) only one chance.
 I
f (
one
 
has) a big goal, (one) can go far.
 If have small goals,
 
only go a small distance.
 S
o.. .Korean school tries to give
 
students big goals.

HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL
 
The First Korean School was established June 5
, 1977 by the First
 
Korean Baptist Church of S
ilver Spring, Maryland.
 On April 10, 1979 the
 
school was incorporated in the state of Maryland and became an independent
 
organization from the church.  As of Spring 1982, the school maintains
 
relations with the church but is growing increasingly independent in
 
financial and policy matters. 1 it is also also growing in size and reputa-
t
ion- 2 
The school was created by a small group of Korean immigrants l
iving,
 
in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D
.C.  Mr. Han-il Lee, current
 
principal, initiated the idea and spearheaded the organization of the
 
school.
 He was aided by a school board made up of church and community
 
leaders.
 
Before starting the school, Mr. Lee sought advice from a number of
 
people involved in ethnic language education.
 The Washington Korean
 
School, created in 1970 and the oldest Korean school in the Washington
 
metropolitan area, provided an example of an established school.  The
 
Korean Embassy's office of education which works with Korean ethnic
 
schools throughout the U.S. supplied other models as well as official
 
support and a representative to the school board.  Mr. Lee also drew
 
ideas from other ethnic communities and organizations, specifically,
 
F
innish,  Polish, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese.
 
Mr. Lee also organized the original financing of the school.  Appro-
'
 one third of the funds for supplies and administrative expenses
 
r
:
alned from the First Korean Baptist Church.  The rest was paid
 
for by students' tuitions.
 The Church also provided free use of their
 
facilities and utilities. 3 
The Korean Embassy also provided support in the form of free text-
books- 4 It later donated a large library of Korean literature for both
 
children and adults. 5 
In the first years of its existence, the school was run primarily by
 
Mr. Han-il Lee.
 He designed the curriculum, class structure, and schedule,
 
and printed the handouts used in all the classes to supplement the texts. 6 
He was also the first principal of the school.
 His official duties
 
involved budget and policy decisions, and faculty hiring.  Mr. Lee remained
 
principal for two years.
 In 1979, he was replaced by Dr. Lee, associate
 
pastor of the First Korean Baptist Church and holder of a Ph.D.  After
 
one year Dr. Lee returned to Korea to a university position, and his
 
place was filled by Mr. P
ark Hee Kyu, former chief of education  at the
 
Korean Embassy.  Mr. Park was principal for several months, and then the
 
7
 
post was returned to Mr. Han-il Lee who is currently the principal. 7 
The job of vice-principal was not formally established until the
 
1
981-1982 school year when Mr. Han-il Lee requested it.
 The faculty then
 
elected one its members, Mr. Koh- 8 
Since its creation, the Korean School has had a governing board that
 
makes policy decisions.
 The first board was chosen by Mr. Lee and the
 
leaders of the First Korean Baptist Church.  They established a seven to
 
n
ine member organization that included three official members:  the pastor,
 
the DCE (Director of Christian Education), and the president of the
 
parents association from the First Korean Baptist Church.
 The other
 
positions were filled by leaders and representatives of the Korean
 
community.
 Some were specialists in relevant fields.  About fifty percent
 
were church members and most were parents.  The board was also divided
 
evenly between U
.S. citizens and recent immigrants.  Although board
 
membership has changed over the years 9 , Mr. Lee has tried to insure a
 
mixture of backgrounds in order to obtain a concensus of public opinion.
 
In the f
irst year, the faculty consisted of six teachers, three of
 
whom are still with the school. 1°  It now includes thirteen teachers, al-
though the number tends to fluctuate during the school year- 11  The f
irst
 
t
eachers taught on a volunteer basis, but salaries were instituted within
 
the first year. 1
2  
Forty-five students registered for classes in the first year, each of
 
whom paid a tuition of $50.00 per semester. The number of students has
 
since increased to about 150 and tuition has gone up to $60.00 each
 
semester.
 The school had its first graduate in Spring 1982.
 
In order to reach children outside the Korean Baptist Church, the
 
school publicized its opening in local Korean-American newspapers.
 I
t
 
8
 
now circulates a small booklet telling about the school and the need for
 
Koreans to maintain their ethnic identity and heritage. 1
3  
In 1980 a new church building was constructed by the church members,
 
and the old building was designated as the education building to be used
 
for S
unday school classes, the Korean school, and other community activi-
t
ies.
 Having a place of its own has made a tremendous difference for the
 
school.
 I
t can store its teaching and administrative materials there and
 
has a room set aside for the library given them by the Embassy.
 I
t also
 
has the space to accommodate the growing number of students.
 
Plans for the future of the school include adding more subjects to
 
the curriculum and expanding the extracurricular program. 1-
4 Several mem-
bers of the school's faculty are presently working with a national asso-
ciation of Korean educators to design textbooks suitable for Korean-American
 
students.
 They hope that these will be ready for publication within the
 
next two years.
 
The school keeps no formal record of its history other than pro-
gress records of each student and minutes of board meetings.
 The church
 
includes the bare facts about the school in an outline of its own history,
 
but does not provide details.  Most of the history is retained in the
 
memories of those individuals who were there from the beginning.' 5 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL
  
The school hold its activities in the First Korean Baptist Church
 
which provides its facilities free of charge.
 The church consists of two
 
buildings.  The main sanctuary, church administrative offices, kitchen,
 
reception area, and upper-grade classrooms are in a new building built in
 
1980.  The second building is an older one bought from another church.
 It
 
9
 
includes a smaller sanctuary. kitchen, and classrooms.
 The school uses
 
both buildings.  Grades kindergarten through third, the special class,
 
and karate are held in the education building.
 The room used as a f
aculty
 
lounge, administrative office, and supply storeroom is also there.
 
The church grounds also include an old house where the library was
 
stored until Fall of 1982; a small playground; and an extensive parking
 
lot.
 A basketball hoop and picnic tables by the parking lot are often
 
used by the students during class breaks.
 
Aside from the facilties and utilities provided by the Korean Church,
 
the school is financed by the students' tuitions- 16  Seventy percent of
 
these funds go to faculty salaries.
 The other thirty percent covers
 
supplies and miscellaneous expenses, such as the end of year awards and
 
certificantes and the handouts used as teaching aids. 17  Textbooks were
 
donated by the Korean Embassy.
 Students use them in class but cannot buy
 
them or take them home.
 
Each student pays $60.00 per semester.  Discounts are given to fami-
lies having more than one child enrolled: 10% for two children; and 30%
 
for three or more.
 Scholarships or remissions of tuition are available
 
to needy children, and Korean children adopted into American or Korean-
American homes are also eligible for scholarships.  Beginning next year,
 
Mr. Lee hopes to offer a reduced tuition to children of mixed marriages.
 
A minimal snack fee is also charged to cover the cost of the juice
 
and doughnuts or fruit that are served every S
aturday morning.
 Chidren
 
who ride the school vans pay an additional fee each month.
 The fee depends
 
on the distance from the child's home to the school and is between five
 
and ten dollars.  These payments cover the cost of gas, van maintenance,
 
and labor.
 Karate uniforms and dance leotards are an additional expense.
 
Teachers are paid an average of $8.00 an hour for four hours of
 
teaching.  The pay is scaled according to experience and training, but is
 
little more than an honorarium.
 Some of the teachers double as drivers
 
for the three school vans and are paid by the hour for this work. 18  
The church owns one of the vans and lends it to the school.
 The
 
other two are privately owned by faculty members- 19  The school also owns
 
its own buses, but uses it only when a s
izeable number of students need
 
transportation.
 
The Korean school also runs SAT preparation courses for high school
 
students.
 These are t
aught at night at the church by American teachers
 
brought in from a local high school.
 The students pay $7.50 an hour for
 
the two-hour sessions twice a week.
 
Two institutions administer the school--a school board and a team
 
consisting of the pricipal and vice principal.
 The board determines the
 
overall budget and policy matters such as the purpose and emphasis of the
 
school.
 The principal decides most of the details of administration--
hiring, break down of budget, class schedules, school calendar--and
 
provides a broad outline of skills and knowidge to be t
aught to each
 
class each semester.
 The vice principal assists the principal in these
 
duti s.
 
An administrative assistant also aids the principal, acting as
 
secretary, treasurer, and, sometimes, substitute teacher. 2° She also
 
prepares the students' morning refreshments and keeps track of supplies.
 
A parents organization associated with the First Korean Baptist Church
 
also exists but is not very active. 2 ' The group meets about once a year to
 
discuss the role of the Korean School and current concerns of the parents.
 
Individual parents assist at the school by substitute teaching, bringing
 
11
 
snacks, and forming car pools.
 
CURRICULUM
 
The focus of activity at the First Korean School is the teaching of
 
the Korean language.
 l
anguage skills are therefore the most prominent
 
part of the curriculum.
 
The school originally placed the students into three different levels
 
of language skills.
 These classes cut across age and school grade, plac-
ing seventh graders with f
irst graders.  The students disliked this  mix-
ture, and, the following year, the school changed to a system corresponding
 
to the childrens' age and American school grade.
 
This system proved relatively satisfactory, 22  and nine such grade-
classes now exist: kindergarten, first through sixth, junior high, and
 
senior high.  Another class, the Special class, provides children of any
 
grade with remedial help in reading and writing Korean and basic vocabu-
lary. 23  
No standard tests are given to students to assess their ability or
 
skills.
 Each teacher is responsible for monitoring the progress of their
 
students.  This system of grouping the students results in a wide range
 
of ab-ilities in each class and poses difficulties for teachers in struc-
turing their classes.
 The principal suggests that they divide the class
 
into three levels and
 o-'
 i
t
 m n
n
 
is the teacher's option.
 
These basic classes focus  on  Koroan  l
angua ge sk i
-1
-1s
:  readfro, writfn ,
 
vocabulary, grammar and conversation.
 Reading exercises are based on hand-
outs, textbooks, and sentences and phrases written on the blackboard.
 The
 
students usually take turns reading out  loud, although some teachers have
 
1
2
 
their students read out  loud together.
 
These reading lessons often include traditional Korean stories.
 
During one fourth grade class, students chose characters in a story and
 
read those p
arts out loud.  Teachers also use the stories for question
 
and answer sessions to test the students' comprehension.
 
Writing exercises usually involve copying text from the blackboard
 
and from handouts.
 Quizzes which combine dictation and spelling are a
 
standard part of most of the classes, and students are often given homework
 
consisti ng  of  wri ti ng  exerci ses.
 
After a student has acquired the basic skills of reading and writing,
 
vocabulary and grammar lessons make up a major part of their class t
ime.
 
S
tudents are usually given vocabulary words to learn at home and then
 
practice them in class.
 Grammar lessons often involve using the new words
 
and building phrases and sentences out of them.
 
Korean conversation is also a part of most of the classes.
 Teachers
 
often conduct this part by asking questions in Korean and encouraging the
 
students to answer in Korean.
 They also encourage students to speak
 
Korean throughout the day, but among themselves the children invariably
 
speak English.
 
-
 Alt t
he t
eachers use the standardized Korean textbooks donated by
 
t
he Korean embassy, but most of them feel that they are inadequate for
 
)
rean-American children.
 The students often use texts several grades
 
hind them since they lack the vocabulary to understand the ones for
 
their own age group, and the subjects, people, and places mentioned in
 
these texts tend to be foreign to their experiences, and therefore irrelevant.
 
Our situation is different, everyday life, thinking, every-
thing is different for students here from the textbooks.
 
So they need something they know.
 
(
ES82-LL-R8)
 
Most of the teachers design handouts to supplement the textbooks.
 
They also write their own tests and quizzes.
 In this way, they can
 
address the individual skills and interests of their class, and the school
 
is gradually building up a reservoir of unique teaching materials.  E
ach
 
teacher also determines the amount and type of homework given to their class.
 
From the beginning the school has included music and martial arts
 
along with the language classes.
 Dance was added several years ago, and
 
an evening course to prepare students for the SAT college entrance exams
 
was established in 1979.
 The SAT program meets for two hours twice a
 
week and is taught by teachers from a local high school. 24  
The administration hopes that these extracurricular classes will
 
entertain the students and provide a break from the language study.  They
 
are concerned that the children will find the language classes too
 
demanding and tedious and, as a result, may lose interest in Korean.
 
They also hope that these classes will expose the students to more Korean
 
culture and values.
 
Korean history, literature, and culture are included informally in
 
all the classes.
 In the upper ones, teachers sometimes give lectures on
 
those subjects, but teachers for the younger students try to incorporate
 
history and culture into reading and writing excercises. 25  
Some teachers also include discussions of ethnicity in their classes.
 
Such topics are difficult to f
it into the curriculum s
ince most of the
 
students lack the vocabulary to understand complex ideas in Korean.
 The
 
administration hopes that such issues will be absorbed by the children from
 
the environment and role models provided by the school.
 
.we cannot separate culture or some history or some custom
 
the language.
 So, basically, we teaching for Korean tongue.
 
Korean writing is easy, so we push just for tongue.  But if
 
1
4
 
we push too much,  they hate Korean language.
 So,  f
irst t
ime,
 
I suggest to teachers that you have to do is encourage in
 
what is interesting.
 Attending here, they make friend of
 
same skin or same color so they enjoy schoo.
 They they
 
grow up, if they have good memory,...so just keep tongue...
 
(
E582-LLR22, Mr. Lee)
 
The principal has also found that the students are more receptive to
 
discussions of ethnicity when they come from outsiders rather than members
 
of the Korean community.
 So far, he has had two men, one Finnish and the
 
other Polish, talk to the students about maintaining their ethnic identi-
t
ies.
 The response was positive.
 
.
kids are very interested about that.
 Because if (I) push
 
myself, they very (much) hate or are against (thinking about
 
Korean identity).
 But the other person, they (are) t
alking
 
about themselves: we keep our own heritage, we keep own lan-
guage, then we (are) so proud.
 (They say) why don't you keep
 
your own language and your own heritage.
 Then alittle bit,
 
they (the students) understand it.
 
(ES82-LL-22, Mr. Lee)
 
The school day is broken into five 45 minute periods,  three of which
 
are spent in the language homeroom classes.  The other two are used for
 
music and dance or martial arts.
 Usually girls take dancing and boys
 
take martial arts, but a few girls choose the latter.  For these extracurri-
cular classes, students are divided into three groups: kindergarten
 
through second ggrade; third throgh fifth; and sixth through high school.
 
In this way, each teacher has three periods a day but the extracurricular
 
teachers have different groups of children for each period.
 The language
 
teachers have the same students throughout, much like a homeroom s
ituation
 
in an American school.
 - 
At the end of the school year, every student receives a report card, 26  
and certificates of achievement are given to those students who have done
 
especially well. 27  Students graduate from Korean school when they finish
 
1
5
 
American school, regardless of
 
they receive a diploma stating
 
their Korean language skills.
 At that t
ime
 
that they have attended the language program.
 
The school calendar parallels the one used by American public school.
 
The school year begins in the fall and ends in early summer. 28  American
 
public holidays are recognized but not celebrated by the school as a
 
whole.
 Christian holidays--Christmas and Easter--are usually marked by
 
some classroom activities.
 The only holidays celebrated by the entire
 
school are two Korean ones: Chusok, the Fall harvest festival, and t
he
 
Korean Independence 1y on March 1
.
 These are celebrated by school
 
assemblies and parties.
 
Two issues often mentioned by the f
aculty are the emphasis given to
 
the amount of knowledge a child should be expected to learn, and the use
 
of English in the classroom.  Both are related to the school's desire to
 
impart an understanding and love for Korean heritage to the students.
 
Most of the teachers feel that language is a way to transmit those feelings
 
and should not be an end in itself.
 The amount and quality of language
 
skills are not as important as the attitudes a student has towards his
 
ethnic identity and heritage.
 Classes, then, should be enjoyable and
 
interesting for the students and not too demanding. 29  
They are so busy, and they are just little children.
 I don't
 
want to give them too much work because if I do, they will
 
have no time to play, and they will hate Korean school.
 
(Interview with Special C
lass
 
teacher, May,  1982)
 
The other issue,  the use of English in the classroom, is resolved
 
individually by each teacher.
 The principal encourages them to speak
 
Korean at all times, but recognizes that the students' level of compre-
hension makes t
his d1 ff
1
.
 
16
 
Its very difficult.
 If (we) talk completely in Korean,
 
they cannot catch (the meaning and) feelings.
 S
o sometimes,
 
(for) important things, we explain in American.
 But, basi-
cally, we have (emphasize) learning the Korean tongue, so
 
if possible, (we) have to use Korean.
 
(ES82-LL-R22, Mr. Lee)
 
Most of the teachers try to speak primarily Korean in class, but find
 
that they need English to explain vocabulary words and ideas and, sometimes,
 
simply to keep the students' interest.
 
When I speak only Korean, they don't understand, and they
 
get bored and don't learn, but when I use English, they
 
are interested and can ask questions.  Then they learn.
 
(Interview with Ok Kyung Kim, 5/22/82)
 
Mr. Lee also states that it is more important that the students gain
 
an appreciation for their heritage than speak the language fluently.
 
.
but sometimes they (teachers) explain in English, because
 
they (students) cannot catch (understand) and they hate Korean.
 
So if youngest are this way (hating Korean), when they grow
 
up, they cannot choose (to appreciate their heritage), and
 
they will always hate Korean.
 So (we) have to pay attention
 
to make (learning Korean) interesting.
 
(ES82-LL-R22, Mr. Lee)
 
FACULTY
  
The number of teachers has grown from s
ix to f
ifteen since the creation
 
of the school.
 The list in the appendix provides information about the tea-
chers during the Spring 1982 semester. 3 °
 
The school does not formally train its teachers or set requirements
 
in experience and background for hiring, but the administration does try
 
to select teachers with previous training and experience.
 Most of the
 
teachers are overqualified for elementary and middle school teaching.
 
At least seven out of twelve have formal training in education; one from
 
an American university, the others from Korean institutions.  All of
 
17
 
them have some experience working with children. 3 ' Those that do lack
 
formal training or previous teaching experience compensate with under-
standing and concern for the students and with their committment t
o the
 
purpose of the school.  All of the teachers seemed to me to be very
 
capable.
 
Very few of the teachers are trained specifically for language
 
teaching. 32  Some say that their previous teaching helps them in dealing
 
with the children and structuring their classes, but not particularly
 
with teaching Korean language.
 Most find that their t
ask is further
 
complicated by the need to teach cultural values and heritage as well as
 
language.
 
The principal provides guidelines for the classes, but the actual
 
development of these is left up to the individual teachers.
 The faculty
 
meets occasionally to plan the curriculum, discuss teaching methods,
 
and gather teaching materials.
 During the school hours,  the faculty and
 
principal usually meet briefly after the morning assembly to discuss
 
immediate concerns and to pass on information.
 Teachers often meet infor-
mally during their morning breaks in the administrative office. 33  
While teaching Korean language is the primary emphasis of the classes,
 
the more immediate concern of many of the teachers is maintaining the
 
children's interest.
 Some do this by presenting lessons as games or by
 
chaning activities whenever they sense boredom or fatigue among their
 
students.  Others achieve it by creating a relaxed and cheerful atmos-
phere .
34
 
Some of the teachers are also concerned about discipline in the
 
classrooms.  One felt that the children, particularly the younger ones,
 
lack discipline at home and in American school and need to receive a f
irm
 
18
 
hand at the Korean school. 35  Other teachers tended to be more tolerant in
 
their judgements and expectations.  Most agreed that the Korean l
anguage
 
is demanding and that many of the children find it difficult.
 Their
 
restlessness in class is due more to the nature of the subject being
 
studied and the fact that it is S
aturday than to a lack of discipline.
 
The second grade teacher suggested another reason behind her class'
 
somewhat boisterous behavior:
 
They feel at home here.
 They're with children who are the
 
same color, and many of them are their friends.
 Everybody
 
is speaking the language they hear at home.
 It's not like
 
at American school where they feel they're a little bit
 
different.  Here they can be themselves.  That's why they're
 
a little noisy.
 
(
Interview with In Ok Kim, 4 /3 /82)
 
In my observations of the classes,  I felt that the teachers were
 
tolerant of students' behavior but not lax.
 They usually allowed some
 
degree of play and freedom among the students, but the classes never seemed
 
out of control.
 If the class did become too noisy, the teacher usually
 
quieted it by clapping their hands and calling for attention or by speaking
 
directly to the child.
 D
iscipline was always administered with good
 
humor and affection.
 
The teacher's reasons for teaching at the Korean school tend to be
 
altruistic.
 
• . .
the teachers are really volunteers.  The salary doesn't
 
pay for anything--except gas money.
 So the teachers have
 
to have a real (committment).
 
(EX82-LL-R22, Mr. Lee)
 
Some of the reasons teachers gave for working at the school include
 
a feeling of responsibility towards the next generation; concern for the
 
ethnic identity of the youth and the possible problems resulting from a
 
19
 
lack of it; concern for the future welfare (economic, social, and emotional)
 
of the Korean community in the U.S.; and pride in and love for Korean
 
culture. Also mentioned were a sense of Christian duty to guide youth in
 
the right direction, a calling to teach, and a love for children.  Most
 
of the faculty said that they consider their teaching to be a service to
 
the Korean community and that their l
ob is a way to provide role models
 
of Korean values.
 
STUDENTS 
A total of 151 students were listed in the spring school directory- 36  
Eighty-six different families were represented.
 All of the students l
ive
 
in Maryland, most of them f
airly close to the school and in middle class
 
surburban areas- 37  The student body includes both members and non-members
 
of the First Korean Baptist Church.
 
Most of the students at the First Korean School are between the ages
 
of five and fourteen years old, although there was several who were older
 
and younger.  These ages correspond to American public school grades
 
kindergarten through eighth. 38  
Most of the students seemed to be full blooded Koreans.  At least
 
two were adopted, and several come from "mixed marriages." 39  Most of these
 
children attended the Special Class, except for the younger ones who were
 
kept with their age group.  Although no official count has been made, most
 
of the faculty agreed that the children had either been born in the U
.S. or
 
had spent a major part of their lives here.
 
All the children I observed spoke English fluently, and many of them
 
consider it their first language.
 One teacher suggested that perhaps
 
fifty percent of the chidren speak Korean at home.
 He also observed that
 
it is more likely for a child to be fluent in Korean if the grandparents
 
20
 
live with the family.
 
Among themselves the students usually spoke English.
 They also called
 
each other by their American names rather than the Korean ones used by the
 
teachers.  All of them wore American clothing to school.
 Even for special
 
events very few of them wore Korean clothes. 40  In general,  the students
 
seemed very Americanized.
 One teacher observed that:
 
the children look Korean; have Korean skin color and
 
eyes.
 But their thinking and customs are American.
 (
I)
 
think these children (
are) not Korean; they're American.
 
(ES-82-LL-R11, Mr. K
im)
 
The majority of the s
tudents said they disliked attending Korean school,
 
claiming that they came only because their parents insisted.
 S
ome com-
plained that school was boring; others that it was too difficult.
 Several
 
said they were tired of classes after five days of American school, and
 
some wanted to watch S
aturday morning television.
 Some also had conflicts
 
between Korean school and A
nler -!
rRn crl c
1  r
 .
 -
 
as Little League baseball.
 
Although most students claimed to dislike school, they seemed to have
 
fun while they were there.  Many were friends with their classmates, and
 
they seemed to like their teachers.  They also seemed to enjoy the non-language
 
classes: martial arts, in particular, elicited enthusiasm.
 
Most of the students seemed very aware of their "Korean-ness" and
 
tended to accept it matter-of-factly.
 One teenager said that it was impossi-
ble for him not to acknowledge his heritage because his looks are Asian.  He
 
feels like an American, eats American food, has American friends, and speaks
 
English fluently.  But he recognizes that some aspects of his life differ
 
greatly from the lives of his friends.
 For example, he likes Korean food
 
and wants to marry a Korean girl so that his wife can prepare it at home.
 
MR
 
Another teenager wanted to learn Korean so that she could participat e 
in the Korean students group at the university she planned to attend.
 
She thought that she would feel most comfortable with other Korean and Korean
 
American students,  even though she spoke fluent English, because they would
 
share her cultural background and values.
 
In general,  Korean and Korean-American children tend to fit easily into
 
the American ideals of behavior and success.
 Many of them excel in American
 
schools and hope to continue their education at prestigious institutions,  suct
 
as Harvard, MIT, and Yale. 41  This striving towards success is partly out o f
 
respect for their parents' wishes: many see their parents sacrificing for thei
 
children's futures, but it also reflects Korean values that encourage hard
 
work, acheivement, and material and academic success.
 
PARENTS

represented by the parents of the students at the Korean school.
 The
 
school has purposely structured its fees to not be a financial burden,
 
- 
mini ma
l
and it offers conveniences,  such as the van service,  so that 
 
effort is required from the parents.
 
- The administration and faculty feel that a primary task is that of
 
educating the parents about the need to maintain and transmit,  in the hom, ,.
 
an appreciation for their Korean heritage.
 The school cannot achieve its
 
purpose without the support of the parents.
 Korean language,  in particular,
 
cannot be taught without some reinforcement in the home.
 
Parents' involvement with the Korean school seemed to be minimal, often
 
22
 
the school itself.
 
The reason most often given by parents for sending their children to
 
the school is that it would be a shame for them to not know their own
 
heritage.  They worry that the children will lack a strong sense of self
 
and pride in their heritage, both of which may create obstacles for then
 
in achieving a successful and fulfilled life.
 The parents are also car
,
 
cerned with the maintenance of the family identity:
 they want the fami
 
name t
o t
o be honored, and they want the children to know their ancestors. 42  
Communication between generations is particularly important, and some parents
 
felt that their children were adapting too well to American values and customs.
 
The parents recognized that the children complain about attending school
 
and learning Korean, but they felt that the children would appreciate this
 
training when they were grown.
 Several parents who do not send their children
 
to the school said they were concerned about demanding too much from them. 43  
Some felt that their children needed to concentrate on learning English,
 
studying for American school, and participating in other activities, such
 
as music lessons.
 Others said that forcing their children to attend would
 
produce negative reactions to their Korean heritage.
 
THE WASHINGTON AREA KOREAN COMMUNITY  AND ETHNIC AWARENESS
  
The 1982 estimate for Koreans and Korean-Americans living in the U
.S.
 
reaches 600,000.
 Most of that number live in three major population centers:
 
Los Angelos shich has 200,000 Korean residents, Chicago, and New York.
 S
an
 
Francisco and Washington, D
.C. have the next largest populations.
 The Korean
 
embassy estimates that between 35,000 and 40,000 Koreans live in the Washington
 
metropolitan area.
 
The majority of the Korean population in the U
.S. came within the last
 
24
 
language and culture maintenance and support a total of twenty-four language
 
schools.  The First Korean S
chool is the largest of these.
 
CONCLUSIONS
 
Since its creation in 1977,  the First Korean School has grown approxi-
mately four t
imes its original student body and f
aculty.
 At leat four f
ac-
tors are responsible for this growth.
 
The f
irst factor is the commlttment and determination of the individuals
 
who organized and developed the school.
 Their continued efforts to create an
 
effective program have drawn increasing support from the Korean community.
 
A second factor is the growth and continued support of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church.
 The building added by the church in 1980 has enabled the school
 
to expand its classes to hold more students.
 The church has also provided
 
free rent and utilities, allowing the tuition fees to be used for other expenses.
 
The third facter is the Washington Korean-American community and its
 
ethnic awareness.
 In general, the community is both conscious and proud of
 
its heritage.
 It has also been here long enough for its members to acquire a
 
measure of economic stability and formally support--both financially and emo-
tionally--the maintenance of ethnic language.
 Many have also been here long
 
enough to realize that such maintenance is not a luxury but a necessity.
 
The final factor is the school's broad purpose, which is to produce goo
 
Korean-American citizens.  While the school achieves this goal primarily thru
 
language classes, it has the flexibility to meet both immediate and long-term
 
needs of its students and the Korean-American community.
 
Four of the stated hypotheses of the Ethnic Schools Project are rele-
vant to the First Korean School. -
--First, the school definitely reflects the
 
25
 
concerns of the adult generation of Korean immigrants and Korean-Americans.
 
These concerns are not limited to transmission of cultural heritage but
 
include the overall immediate and future welfare of Korean-American children.
 
Neither are the concerns limited to a select group within the Korean commu-
n
ity.
 The actual administration of the school is achieved by a small num-
ber of individuals with a variety of educational and occupational credentials,
 
and the larger community displays its support through the continued enroll-
ment of their children.
 
Secondly, Koreans living in the U
.S. seem to have a strong sense of
 
ethnic identity.
 Although there is no geographcally-delineated community
 
in the Washington area, Koreans living here demonstrate a feeling of com-
munity through numerous recreational, occupational, and educational organi-
zations.  The effort to institutionalize transmission of culture is not
 
unique to a select segment of the Korean population but is widespread
 
throughout both the Washington area and the rest of the U.S.
 
A third hypothesis is that ethnic schools help instill a sense of
 
ethnic community and identity.  One of the goals of the Korean school L
 
to provide students with a knowledge of their heritage so that they will
 
have more resources from which to formulate their identity and self-image.
 
Maintenance of a community does not seem to be a primary goal.
 Instead,
 
the school stresses family and inter-generational t
ies.  Most Koreans con-
s
ider a degree of acculturation to be inevitable if their children are to
 
succeed in this society.  A developed personal identity and an apprecia-
t
ion for their heritage will help them to adapt and achieve success.
 
A final hypothesis states that the curriculum of a school reflects that
 
group's perception of its ethnic identity: the components of the school
 
curriculum correspond to the components making up their identity.
 The
 
26
 
F
irst Korean School's stated purpose is to produce good Korean-.American
 
citizens.
 In order to be good citizens, the children need a strong sense
 
of identity and an appreciation for their heritage.
 Korean language is
 
emphasized as a means of both transmitting a cultural heritage and main-
t
aining strong family t
ies.
 Being Korean in America, however, requires
 
more than s
imply speaking the language.  An appreciation for culture, both
 
eastern and western, is considered important: music, dance, and martial
 
arts are therefore included in the school's curriculum.  Achievement and
 
success are also aspects of the Korean-American identity and are reflected
 
in the school's curriculum through such things as the SAT classes.
 I
nfor-
mally, the school encourages the students to both adapt to American l
ife
 
and maintain an ethnic identity.  The two are not felt to be incompatible-
instead, they are complementary.
 The school reflects this attitude in it
 
curriculum.
 
NOTE S

.  A large number of the f
aculty and administration are members of th
 
First Korean Baptist Church.  While membership is not a requirement
 
hiring, the administration is concerned that the faculty share t
he 4 
values, many of which are based on a Christian belief system.

 The church considers this aid to the school to be part of its Christian
 
service to the Korean community.
 
4.  Although the Embassy provides funding for administrative costs to
 
language programs requesting such aid, the First Korean School was ineli-
gible at first because of its connection with the Korean Baptist Church.
 
The embassy cannot support church sponsored schools since the Korean
 
government claims to have no official religion.  When the school later
 
became independent, its administrators did not request funding from the
 
embassy because they felt the tuition payments sufficed for the school's
 
administrative needs.

.  -This library contains around 10,000 books, most of which are new.
 
The school plans to organize a national library loan system by which
 
Korean schools in other areas can borrow from their library.
 The adminis-
tration claimed that the First Korean School was chosen by the embassy to
 
receive these books because it is the largest school in the area and it
 
has the largest facilities.

 He feels that the
 
position should be f

 In some ways,
 
he sees the principal as being a figurehead who will lend status and
 
reputation to the school.  Although he has been principal several t

he feels uncomfortable in that role since he does not have a university
 
degree.

Chatig and Mrs. Kwun have s

 The administration found that the teachers took their work more seri-
ously when they were paid.
 Before salaries were instituted, there was a
 
29
 
problem with teachers not coming and not being prepared.

4.  Mr. Lee is presently searching for someone to direct a school and
 
community orchestra.
 He also hopes to offer classes that would provide
 
technical training that would teach useful job skills, such as automobile
 
maintenance and printing.  He is also Interested in starting hobby courses
 
for adults and senior citizens.
 
15.  Mr. Lee, the principal, Mr. Kim, the high school teacher, and Mr. Park,
 
the former embassy official are the only individuals who have been with
 
the school s
ince its creation.
 They are all interested in having the school's
 
history written down and distributed to other Korean schools and to other
 
ethnic groups.
 
16.  Many Koreans seem to feel strongly about earning their own way in
 
l
ife and do not like the idea of receiving aid from public sources.
 
This, it seems, is partly because they feel it might undermine their own
 
initiative and hard-working attitudes, but also because they would then
 
feel indebted to that source.
 
17.  Mr. Lee prints the certificates and handouts at cost in his printing
 
shops.
 End of year awards included notebooks, pencils, crayons, books and
 
other small items.
 
18.  While I was visiting the school, Mr. Kim, Mr. Pak, and Mr. Lee were
 
the regular drivers.  Mr. Koh sometimes substituted for them.
 
19.  The vans are owned by Mr. Pak and Mr. Lee.
 
20.
 During the 1981-82 school year, Miss Yun was the administrative
 
assistant.
 She left the job the next Fall to return to Korea.
 
21.  Most of the parents are too busy to participate.  Many of them hold
 
two jobs or run their own business, often working twelve or more hours
 
3n
 
a day.
 Some parents that I t
alked to s
aid they would l
ike to be more
 
active, but need to get f
inancially established f
irst.
 
22.
 The school is still searching for a system that would better accommo-
date the r
ange of skills and abilities displayed by each age group.  The
 
principal hopes to get ideas from other ethnic schools.
 
23.
 Sometimes a child will be placed in a higher or lower grade if he or
 
she lacks certain skills.
 Some of the children were embarrassed that they
 
were in a lower grade--one s
aid that she had flunked out of the other class.
 
Because the children tend to interpret such actions in this way, the tea-
chers try to keep the children in their respective grades.
 
24.
 The program has been highly successful, and there is now a waiting
 
list for enrollment.
 The classes are open only to members of the F
irst
 
Korean Baptist Church and the Korean school.
 
The SAT, Standard Achievement Test, is given nationally to all stu-
dents entering American institutions of higher learning.
 It consists of
 
two sections on math and English and specialized sections on specific dis-
ciplines.
 
25.
 Some teachers expressed regret at not being able to include t
hese
 
subjects in the curriculum, but most agreed that there was little enough
 
t
ime for language.
 
26.
 The teachers design their own methods of grading, but all of t
hem
 
seemed to use the following grades: excellent, good, satisfactory, anc
 
unsatisfactory or needs improvement.  Most of them did not emphasize
 
grades, but felt that the students worked harder if they received grades.
 
The activities classes tend to have their own reward systems.
 S
tudents
 
who excel in music can join the children's choir sponsored by the Korean
 
Baptist Church, and the martial arts class follows a system used by all
 
31
 
Karate Schools in which different colored belts represent levels of
 
achievement; the highest being a black belt, and the lowest being white.
 
27.
 At the 1982 graduation ceremony, the names of those students receiving
 
certificates were read to the audience while the students stood and were
 
applauded.
 One child was given an award for being the best student in
 
the school, and another was rewarded for making the most progress.
 
28.
 The F
irst Korean School usually starts classes in early September
 
and ends them in early June.
 The administration plans for forty S
atur-
days of school with perhaps five or six holidays.
 
29.
 Several of the faculty pointed out that Korean s
chools tend t
o
 
place the responsibility of making a class interesting on the student
 
rather than on the teacher, as tends to be the case in the American
 
system.
 
30.
 In the months I visited the school, several transitions were made.
 
A woman teacher, wife of a minister, left because she needed to devote
 
more time to helping her husband.
 The Karate teacher, a Mexican, was
 
replaced by a Korean man.
 Two new t
 - 
Koh, Mr. Koh's daughter, and Mr. Noh
 
31.
 The kindergarten teacher was principal of an elementary school for
 
forty years; Mr. Noh was on the board of education in Korea, and at least
 
two others t
aught in Korean schools.  Miss Koh, daughter of Mr. Koh, is
 
now studying education at the University of Maryland and works in the day
 
care center at the First Korean Baptist Church.  Mr. Choi has a degree in
 
social work and taught Karate in Korea.  Mrs. Kim's previous experience
 
was with teaching Sunday school, and Mr. Kim tutored students in agriculture
 
in Korea.  The junior high teacher currently teaches Korean to Americans
 
at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington which prepares government
 
32
 
personnel for overseas tours of duty.
 
32.  Mi. Park, the junior high school teacher, is the only one involved
 
professionally in teaching Korean language.
 
33.
 This freedom seems to create a good atmosphere among the f
aculty and
 
administration.
 No one individual acts as authority and expert, but they
 
all work together to develop the best possible teaching methods and
 
materials.
 The Special Class is the result of the teachers recognizing a
 
need and designing a way to meet that need.
 
34.
 For example,  the high school teacher purchased ping pong equipment
 
for his class to use between breaks.  Another takes her class outside for
 
a change of scenery and activity.
 
35.
 She also interpreted their misbehavior as a lack of respect for
 
elders and a display of rebellion.
 As a recent arrival from Korea, she
 
compared the children to the students she had taught in Korea and claimed
 
that the Korean children in the U
.S. were worse students--were lazy, undis-
ciplined, and disobedient--than those living in Korea.
 
36.
 This directory was compiled in the fall of 1981 and at that t
ime con-
tained 1
40 names.
 Miss Yun added another eleven when I requested a copy
 
of it in the spring.
 There was both a Korean and an English version of
 
the directory, and the Korean one seemed to be more up-to-date.
 
37.  Addresses were not provided for all the students in the directory,
 
so the following statistics are not complete, but they indicate the geo-
graphic distribution.
 The following breakdown in by families, not by num-
ber of students:
 
Silver Spring--2 families
 
Rockville--12
 
Potomac and Wheaton--7
 
Olney--5
 
3
3
 
Gaithersburg--4
 
Adeiphi, Beltsville, Hyattsville--3
 
Takoma Park--2
 
Burtonsville, Derwood, Glen Dale, Kensington--1
 
There are no statistics available o
n  the distribution of the Korean
 
population in this area, so these numbers cannot be compared to the commu-
n
ity as a whole.
 It is innteresting to note,  though,  that a good number
 
of students come from distances that are a thirty to forty-five minute
 
drive away.  Most of these students ride the three school vans, but some
 
are driven to school by their parents.
 S
ome of the van routes are r
ather
 
long--one starts two hours before classes begin--and the long ride
 
apparently keeps some children away.
 
Most of these areas are suburban and middle class.
 S
ilver Spring is
 
a pleasant neighborhood middle class homes and has a good number of estab-
lished Asian immigrants.  Potomac is an upper-middle to upper class area
 
of country clubs and expensive homes.
 That seven Korean families l
ive
 
there speaks clearly of the upward mobility of the Korean population.
 
Most of the areas having three or less Korean families sending children
 
to the school tend to be middle to lower-middle to working class.  This
 
d
istribution of housing may suggest a correspondence between wealth and
 
awa reness of ethnicity and willingness to participate in an organized
 
attempt to preserve and transmit ethnic heritage.
 
38.  Age is counted differently in Korea than in the U
.S.
 Chi1dr
 
considered a year old at their birth, and sometimes have a second
 
day on the Lunar New Year, the time traditionally at which all birth-
days are celebrated.
 See Cornelius Osgood, The Koreans and Their Cul-
ture(New York: Ronald Press Co., 1951) for more information about these
 
customs.
 The western custom of celebrating one's day of birth is becoming
 
3
4
 
more common, particularly among urban, middle class Koreans.
 The chil-
dren at the First Korean School sometimes gave both their "Korean age"
 
and "American age."
 They seemed to prefer the Korean version because it
 
made them older.
 
I found that a large number of the children at the school had skipped
 
a grade in American school, so were younger by one or two years than most
 
of their American classmates.
 
39.
 One girl had been adopted by a Korean family living in the U
.S., and
 
a boy adopted by an American family who had either lived in Korea or were
 
;ry knowledgeable about Korean culture.  According to some of the f
aculty,
 
boy was one of their best students and his parents were enthusiastic
 
upporters of the school.
 
Several children come from "mixed" parentage.  One girl has a Korean
 
mother and Chinese father; a brother and sister have a Korean mother and
 
Black American father; and several others have western family names.
 
40.  Koreans in Korea, particularly in urban areas, today tend to wear wes-
tern clothes more frequently than Korean clothing.
 The Korean dress for
 
women consists of a short jacket with full sleeves over an ankle length
 
full skirt.  It is still frequently worn, particularly by older women and
 
by women of any age for special occasions.
 The men's costume, which con-
sists of a jacket similar to the women's and full long pants, is more
 
rare.
 
41.  Of the Korean-American children I spoke to, approximately 90% said
 
they make straight A's on their report cards for American school.
 The
 
same percentage said they plan on attending college.  About half of the
 
children said they want a career in one of the medical professions.
 
42.  While Koreans do not officially practice ancestor worship, reverence
 
35
 
for the ancestors is an integral part of the culture.
 A point of pride
 
among many of the Koreans I have interviewed in the Washington area is
 
their ancestry.
 Several have shown me extended genealogies that trace
 
their family for fifty to seventy-five generations.
 
43.
 Most Korean parents seem to demand a lot from their children.
 Their
 
high expectations stem from several factors.  Traditional Korean values
 
stress achievement and place responsibility on children to bring honor
 
and respect to the family name.
 Children are seen as the hope of the
 
future: the child will take care of the parents in their old age and will
 
continue the family line, insuring that the family name survives into
 
the future.

 on ot many Korea:
 
immigrants.  Many parents came to the U
.S. to provide their children with
 
educational and professional opportunities they might lack in Korea and
 
to get them away from the extreme competitiveness of Korean society.
 In
 
coming here, though, the parents often sacrificed their own careers,
 
social status, and financial security.
 Their children are often pressured
 
to succeed to fulfill the parents'  dreams.
 Several students at the school
 
mentioned this to me as one of their motivations for working hard.
 
44. - Many parents told me that they felt that Korean society was too
 
restrictive and competitive.
 They felt that the exam system for entering
 
a school was unfair, and that the competitiveness of the job market meant
 
that the school name was more important than the actual quality of
 
education.  They also felt that the social structure was too rigid--too
 
concerned with status and family background and discriminatory towards
 
children without those advantages.
 They hoped that in the U.S. their
 
children would have the opportunity to choose their own careers and create
 
36
 
t
heir own social status.

45.  According to the Korean embassy, some of these language classes
 
combine Korean language with Bible study.
 These programs usually meet
 
before or after the Sunday worship service and are an extension of Sunday
 
school or the church youth group.
 
46.
 The administration at the First Korean School stated that individuals
 
having had higher education tend to be more supportive of activities,
 
such as the Korean school, that emphasize and preserve one's ethnic heri-
t
age.  Ironically, the principal organizer of the school, Mr. Han-Il Lee,
 
i
as only a high school education.
 
r
hey also stated that higher incomes usually meant more money avail-
for luxuries such as language schools, but that the community still
 
needed to be persuaded that maintaining one's ethnic language was a
 
worthy cause.

Final Report by L
ticv M. Lon
 
An estimated 600,000 Koreans and Korean—Americans are living in
 
the United States in 1982. Most of that number live in three major
 
population centers: Los Angeles (which has 200,000 Korean residents),
 
Chicago, and New York. San Francisco and Washington, D
.C. have the next
 
largest populations. The Korean embassy estimates that between 35,000
 
and 40,000 Koreans l
ive in the Washington metropolitan area.
 
The majority of the Korean population in t
he United States arrived
 
within the last twenty years, so the first generation of Koreans born
 
here is now coming of age. The Washington D.C. population is more
 
recent, however —only f
ive t
o t
en years old.1
 
Most Koreans immigrating t
o the United States do so by choice.
 
Many come for occupational or educational opportunities; others want to
 
escape the competitiveness and restrictions of Korean society. Still
 
others come to provide their children with more opportunities. By
 
emigrating, many give up established careers, social status, and
 
economic security. In addition, their first years here are often a
 
struggle for survival. Most Korean immigrants do extremely well in the
 
United States, often achieving economic stability within five or ten
 
years. Many of them own their homes and businesses and send their
 
children to the best schools.
 
Koreans have a great deal of pride in their heritage. Their
 
history, which extends back 5,000 years, has been a continuous struggle
 
to maintain an identity distinct from that of Japan and China. The
 
2
 
small c
ountry has nurtured many scholars, artists, and inventors. A
 
respect for tradition and the past i
s an integral part of the Korean
 
culture. The respect for the past i
s reinforced by the contemporary
 
achievements of Koreans. On the whole Koreans living in the United
 
States have retained their cultural pride; they maintain a personal
 
ethnic identity and express a community i
dentity through numerous
 
ethnic organizations.
 
Christian churches, particularly Presbyterian and Baptist,
 
function a
s the central social organization in many Korean communities.
 
Washington, D
.C.  has over sixty Korean churches, m a n y  of which r
i
 
their o wn  buildings. They offer a variety of services to the Korean
 
community, including Korean language classes. Approximately twelve
 
Washington-area churches sponsor such classes.
 
The Korean population in the Washington metropolitan area i
s n
ot
 
typical of other Korean communities. Its members have a higher level of
 
education and income than Koreans in other parts of the country. They
 
also appreciate the need for language and culture maintenance,
 
supporting a total of twenty-four language schools.2
 
History of the First Korean School
 
The First Korean School was established on June 5
,  1977 by t
he
 
First Korean Baptist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland.
 The school was
 
incorporated within the s
tate of Maryland on April 1
0,  1
979, b
ecoming
 
3
 
independent of the church. As of spring 1
982, the school maintains
 
relations with the church, but is growing increasingly independent in
 
financial and policy matters. It is also also growing in size and
 
reputation.
 
The school is located in Silver Spring, Maryland in the annex and
 
basement classrooms of the First Korean Baptist Church. Situated on
 
Georgia Avenue, five miles beyond the Washington, D
.C. beltway,  t
he
 
church i
s surrounded by Maryland suburbs. Korean lettering on a s
ign in
 
front of t
he building is the only indication of the church's e
thnic
 
identity.
 
Over 1
50 kindergarten  elementary, junior-high, and high-school
 
students attend the First Korean School. A faculty of thirteen teachers
 
and two administrators teach the classes in Korean language, music,
 
dance, and martial, arts. The primary emphasis is on Korean language
 
(both reading and speaking), but other subjects are included to
 
attract the children's interest and to expose them to Korean culture and
 
values.
 
Classes meet every Saturday from 9
:30 A
.M.  t
o 1
:00 p
. ,
,
.
 
They parallel the American public school calendar. There are sunnier and
 
winter vacations, and most American holidays are celebrated, as well as
 
selected Korean ones. Students enroll by semester and receive report
 
cards and certificates of achievement at the end of the school year.

Although the school i
s nominally independent of the church i
n
 
which its classes are held, members of the First Korean Baptist Church
 
play important roles in the school' s  administration. The school is
 
currently self-supporting, earning funds for faculty salaries and
 
supplies from the students' tuition fees.
 
The First Korean School was created by a small group of Korean
 
immigrants living in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Mr.
 
Han-il Lee,  its current principal,  initiated the idea and spearheaded
 
the organization of the school. He was aided by a school board made up
 
of church and community leaders.
 
Before starting the school Mr. Lee sought advice from a number of
 
people involved in ethnic-language education. The Washington Korean
 
School, the oldest Korean school in the Washington metropolitan area,
 
created in 1970, provided an example as an established school. The
 
Korean Embassy's office of education, which works with Korean ethnic
 
schools throughout the country, supplied other models, as well as
 
official support and a representative to the school board. Mr. Lee also
 
dreg
' ideas from other ethnic communities —specifically, Finnish,
 
Polish, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese —and their organizations.
 
Mr. Lee organized the original financing of the school. He
 
obtained approximately one-third of the funds for supplies and
 
administrative expenses from the First Korean Baptist Church, which
 
5
 
considers this aid to the school to be part of i
ts Christian service t
o
 
the Korean community. The rest was paid for by students'  tuitions. The
 
church also provided free use of their facilities and utilities.
 
The Korean Embassy gave the school free textbooks. Although
 
the embassy provides funding for administrative costs to language
 
programs requesting such aid, the First Korean School was ineligible a
t
 
f
irst because of its connection with the Korean Baptist Church. The
 
embassy cannot support church-sponsored schools since the Korean
 
government claims to have no official religion. When the school later
 
became independent,  its administrators did not request funding from the
 
embassy because they felt the tuition payments sufficed for the
 
school's administrative needs. The embassy later donated a library of
 
some ten thousand books of Korean literature to the school for use both
 
by children and adults. The school plans to organize a national library
 
loan system by which Korean schools in other areas can borrow from
 
their library.
 
In the first years of its existence the school was run primarily
 
by Mr. Han-il Lee. He designed the curriculum, class structure, and
 
school schedule. He also printed the handouts used in all the classes
 
to supplement the texts. Mr. Lee owns and operates a print shop in
 
suburban Maryland. He prints all handout materials for the school at
 
cost.

Mr. Han-il Lee was principal of the school during i
ts f
irst two
 
years. His official duties included budget matters, policy decisions,
 
and faculty hiring.  Dr. Lee, associate pastor of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church,  replaced Mr. Han-il Lee as principal in 1979. After one
 
year Dr. Lee returned to Korea to a university position; his place
 
was filled by Mr. Park Hee Kyu, former chief of education at the
 
Korean Embassy. Mr. Park was principal for several months, and then the
 
post was returned to Mr. Han-il Lee, who remains school principal.
 
Mr. Lee i
s currently seeking another principal. He feels that the
 
position should be filled by someone with academic degrees from a
 
prestigious institution, who enjoys community status and respect. He
 
sees the principal as being a figurehead, in some ways, who will lend
 
status and reputatin to the school. Although he has been principal
 
several times, his lack of a university degree makes him uncomfortable
 
in the role.
 
The job of vice-principal was not formally established until the
 
1981-1982 school year, when Mr. Han-il Lee requested it. The faculty
 
then elected one of its members, Mr. Koh, to the position.
 
Since its creation the Korean School has had a governing board
 
that makes policy decisions. The first board was chosen by Mr. Lee and
 
the leaders of the First Korean Baptist Church. They established a
 
seven- to nine-member organization that included three official
 
members:  the pastor, the director of Christian education, and the
 
president of the parents association of the First Korean Baptist
 
7
 
Church. The other positions were filled by representatives of the
 
Korean community, some of whom were specialists in relevant fields.
 
About fifty percent of the board were church members, and most were
 
parents. The board was also divided evenly between United States
 
citizens and r
ecent immigrants. Although board membership has changed
 
over the years, Mr. Lee has tried to insure a mixture of backgrounds in
 
order to obtain a broad r
ange of opinions.
 
Purposes of the School
 
While the First Korean School identifies itself as a language
 
school for teaching the  mother-tongue'  to Korean descendants, its
 
administrators state that its primary purpose is to create good
 
Korean-American citizens. That can be done best through teaching the
 
Korean language, using it as a vehicle for transmitting Korean values
 
and beli.fs, as we l
l as knowledge about Korean culture and history. The
 
school administrators believe that the more a child understands and
 
appreciates his ethnic heritage, the better person he will become and
 
the more smoothly his acculturation into American society will be
 
accomplished. By giving him the opportunity to know his background, the
 
school provides the child with more options to choose from when he
 
begins to develop his own perspective on his ethnic identity. Mr. Noh,
 
the sixth grade teacher and a board member, explains:
 
I think the second generation who [were]  born in
 
America will find themselves a little bit different
 
from E
thel major [ethnic] group in the adolescent age
 
period. At that time they need some integration in
 
their personality, or some identity in their origin. So
 
8
 
anytime they try t
o s
eek some f
amily system, t
heir
 
roots,  their cultural origin, i
f they got some kind of
 
cultural resources from their first generation or
 
family .
 .
 .
 they [can] make use of those kinds of
 
r
esources in the integration of their personality.
 
(Es82-LL-R7)
 
Facilitating communication between generations i
s a major concern
 
of the Korean School. Language is often a barrier between parents and
 
children, since many Korean families are recent immigrants.  Because of
 
their interaction with native-born English-speakers through their
 
schooling, the children usually learn English within a few years of
 
their arrival, while the parents take much longer. Often parents and
 
grandparents never become fluent in the language and speak Korean among
 
themselves and in their homes. As Mr. Noh says:
 
Their mother tongue, Korean, is needed as a tool of
 
communication between generations. Sometimes, the first
 
generation and second generation .
 .
 .  find a gap [in]
 
communicating with each other later on. Then, make kind
 
of tragedy in the immigrant family. So we worry about
 
[
it].  Their mother tongue is basically a tool for
 
communication in the immigrant family.  (ES82-LL-R7)
 
The language barrier is particularly obvious in homes where
 
grandparents are living with the family.
 
School administrators are also concerned that differences t
r
 
values and attitudes may create inter-generational barriers iusL
 
troublesome as language. Principal Lee described a representative
 
incident in which a story in a school publication was misunderstood by
 
the students. The story concerned a famous Korean general who often
 
visited a wine shop in his youth. One day, while riding his horse, he
 
fell asleep.  The horse continued walking and carried him to the wine
 
9
 
shop. When the general awoke and found himself there, he r
ealized that
 
he had become addicted t
o wine. He then killed his horse and began
 
leading an upright life, eventually becoming a great hero.
 
Mr. Lee explained that the moral of this story is that one must
 
dispose of bad influences i
f one wants to succeed in l
ife. The horse
 
was aiding the general's addiction and therefore had to be destroyed.
 
The Korean parents recognized this moral and agreed with it. Their
 
children, however, did not understand the story. Even when i
t was
 
explained t
o them, they saw no nobility in the general's actions and
 
felt that he was cruel for needlessly killing his horse. Mr. Lee hopes
 
that the school will help the children to understand their parents'
 
attitudes and values. He recognizes that the children may not agree
 
with them, but at least they will know what the values are, and  later
 
may choose t
o accept them.

their own Korean identity and heritage. They are proud to be Korean a r
ni
 
feel strong emotional ties with their motherland. They also feel that
 
an appreciation for Korean ways is a valuable and precious possession,
 
one that should be passed on to future generations. Their involvement
 
in the school is generated partly by these attitudes.  "We don't want to
 
forget [Korean heritage]," explains Mr. Noh. "We don't have to get out
 
of that kind of cultural resource. That means that  [
iti is  a  kind of
 
mission of the first generation" (ES82—LL--R7).

The administrators are concerned with both the immediate and
 
long-term welfare of the students and of the Korean-American community.
 
The school offers the language classes not only to transmit knowledge
 
of a cultural heritage, but also to provide a central place where
 
Korean-American children can be with others of their background, a
 
place where they can feel comfortable and have a sense of belonging.
 
School administrators hope that the children will maintain the
 
relationships that begin there,  strengthening the t
ies within in the
 
Korean-Awerjcar  
,c om
m u ni t y.
 
The administrators are further concerned with the success of the
 
children in achieving their long-term educational and professional
 
goals, most of which are set very high. They hope to provide role
 
models by exposing the children to ethnic Americans who are successful.
 
In terms of the future welfare of the children, the administration
 
believes that it can help most by encouraging them to set high goals.
 
As Han-il Lee says:
 
If you buy a ticket —airplane, bus, train —from here
 
[Washington]  to San Francisco, you can get off anywhere
 
along the way. But a ticket to New York, takes you only
 
to New York. In life,  [one has] only one chance. If
 
[
one has] a big goal,  [
one] can go far. If have small
 
goals, only go a small distance. So .  .  .  Korean
 
school tries to give students big goals.  (ES82-LL-R16)

School Administration
 
The school's administrators include a school board, the principal,
 
and the vice-principal. The board determines the overall budget and
 
policy matters, such as the purpose and emphasis of the school. The
 
principal handles most administrative details —hiring, application of
 
budget, class schedules, school calendar —and develops a broad outline
 
of the skills and knowidge to be taught to each class each semester.
 
The vice-principal assists the principal in  his  duties.  An
 
administrative assistant also aids the principal, acting as secretary,
 
treasurer, and substitute teacher, preparing the students' morning
 
refreshments, and keeping track of supplies.
 
In 1
980 a new church building was constructed by the church
 
members. The old building was designated as the education building
 
to be used for Sunday school classes, the Korean school, and other
 
community activities. Having a place of its own has made a tremendous
 
difference for the school. It has the space to accommodate the growing

 t aside for the library given
 
them by the Embassy.
 
The school meets in the First Korean Baptist Church,
 
which provides its facilities free of charge. The church consists of
 
two buildings:  the main sanctuary, church administrative offices,
 
1
2
 
kitchen, r
eception area, and upper-grade classrooms are in a new
 
building, built in 1
980; the second building includes a smaller
 
sanctuary, kitchen, and classrooms. The school uses both buildings.
 
The church grounds include an old house where the library was
 
stored until fall of 1982, a small playground, and an extensive parking
 
lot. A basketball hoop and picnic tables by the parking lot are often
 
used by the students during class breaks.
 
Except for the facjltjes and utilities provided by the Korean
 
Church, the school i
s financed wholly by the students' tuitions.
 
Seventy percent of these funds go to faculty salaries;  the other thirty
 
percent covers supplies and miscellaneous expenses, such as year-end
 
awards —
notebooks , pencils, crayons, books, and certificates —and the
 
handouts used as teaching aids. Textbooks were donated by the Korean
 
Embassy; students use them in class, but cannot buy them or take them
 
home.
 
Each student pays $60 per semester. Discounts are given to
 
families having more than one child enrolled:  ten percent for two
 
children, and thirty percent for three or more. Scholarships or
 
remissions of tuition are available to needy children. Korean children
 
adopted-into American or Korean-American homes are also eligible for
 
scholarships. Beginning next year Mr. Lee hopes to offer a reduced
 
tuition to children of mixed marriages.

A snack fee i
s also charged to cover the cost o
f t
he juice and
 
doughnuts or fruit that are served every Saturday morning. Children who
 
r
ide the school vans pay an additional fee of between $5 and $10 each
 
month, depending on the distance from the child's home to the school.
 
Karate uniforms and dance leotards are an additional expense.
 
Teachers are paid an average of $8 an hour for four hours of
 
teaching. The pay is scaled according t
o experience and training, but
 
it  i
s little more than an honorarium. Some of the teachers double as
 
drivers for the three school vans and are paid by the hour for this
 
work.
 
The church owns one of the vans and lends it to the school. The
 
other two are privately owned by faculty members. The school also owns
 
i
ts own buses, but uses them only when a sizeable number of students
 
need transportation.
 
The Korean school also runs Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
 
preparation courses for high school students. These are taught at night
 
at the church by American teachers brought in from a local high school.
 
The students pay $7.50 an hour for the two—hour sessions held twice a
 
week.

Classes and Curriculum
 
The focus of activity at the First Korean School i
s the teaching o
f
 
the Korean language. Language skills are,  therefore,  the most prominent
 
part of the curriculum.
 
The s
chool  ur gi:u1 I
; p
liced  he s
tudents into  U
iree hit
 
levels of language skills. These classes cut across age and school
 
grade, p
lacing seventh graders with first graders. The students
 
disliked this mixture, and the school changed to a system
 
corresponding to the childrens' age and American-school grade the
 
following year. This system proved relatively satisfactory, and nine
 
such levels now exist: kindergarten, first through sixth, junior
 
high, and senior high.
 
Another class, the Special Class, provides children of any grade
 
with remedial help in reading and writing Korean and basic vocabulary.
 
Sometimes a child will be placed in a higher or lower grade if he or
 
she lacks certain skills. Some of the children were embarrassed that they
 
were in a lower grade —one said that she had flunked out of the other class.
 
Because the children tend to interpret such actions in this way, the tea-
chers try to keep the children in their respective grades.
 
No standard tests are given to students to assess their ability or
 
skills. Each teacher is responsible for monitoring the progress of
 
their students. This system of grouping the students results in a wide
 
range of abilities in each class and poses structuring difficulties for
 
1
5
 
teachers. The school i
s s
till searching for a system t
hat would b
etter
 
accomodate the range of skills and abilities displayed by each age
 
group. The principal hopes to get ideas from other ethnic schools.
 In
 
the meantime, Mr. Han-il Lee has suggested that they divide the class
 
into three levels and give separate assignments t
o each level, but t
his
 
i
s the teacher's option.
 
These basic classes focus on Korean language skills:  r
eading,
 
writing,  vocabulary, grammar, and conversation. Reading exercises are
 
based on handouts, textbooks, and sentences and phrases written on t
he
 
blackboa.
.d. The students usually take turns reading out loud,  alrhou
 
some teachers have their students read out loud t
ogethe
 
The reading lessons often include traditional Korean stories.
 
During one fourth-grade class students chose characters in a story and
 
read those parts out loud. Teachers also use the stories for question
 
and answer sessions to test the students' comprehension.
 
Writing exercises usually involve copying text from the blackboard
 
and from handouts. Quizzes which combine dictation and spelling are a
 
standard part of most of the classes, and students are often given
 
homework consisting of writing exercises.
 
1
6
 
After a s
tudent has acquired the b
asic skills of reading and
 
writing, vocabulary and grammar lessons make up a major part of their
 
class t
ime. Students are usually given vocabulary words to learn at
 
home, which they practice in class. Grammar lessons often involve
 
building phrases and sentences out of the new words.
 
Korean conversation i
s also a part o
f most of the classes. Teachers
 
often generate conversation by a
sking questions in Korean. They also
 
encourage students to speak Korean througout the day, but
. the children
 
invariably speak English among themselves.
 
All the teachers use the standardized Korean textbooks donated by
 
the Korean Embassy, but most of them feel that they are inadequate for
 
Korean—American children. The students often use texts several grades
 
behind them, since they lack the vocabulary to understand the ones for
 
their own age group and the subjects, people, and places mentioned in
 
the texts tend to be foreign to their experiences. "Our situation i
s
 
different —everyday life, thinking, everything is different for
 
students here from the textbooks.
 So they need something they know,"
 
says -

 -
 -
 (ES82—LL—R8)
 
Most of the teachers design handouts to supplement the textbooks.
 
They also write their own tests and quizzes. They can address the
 
individual skills and interests of their class in this way, and the
 
school i
s gradually building up a reservoir of unique teaching
 
.erials. Each teacher also determines the amount and type of homework

From the beginning the school has included music and martial arts
 
along with its language classes. Dance was added several years ago. The
 
evening course to prepare students for the SAT college entrance exams
 
was established in 1
979.
 
The administration hopes that the extracurricular classes will
 
entertain rhe students and provide a break from the language study.
 
They are concerned that the children, f
inding the language classes t
oo
 
demanding and tedious, may lose interest in Korean. They also hope
 
that the extracurricular classes will expose the students to additional
 
asspects of Korean culture and values.
 
Korean history, l
iterature, and culture are included informally in
 
all the classes. Teachers sometimes give lectures on those subjects in
 
the upper grades, but teachers for the younger students try to
 
incorporate history and culture into reading and writing exercises.
 
Some teachers also include discussions of ethnicity in their
 
classes. Such topics are difficult to fit into the curriculum, since
 
most of the students lack the vocabulary to understand complex ideas in
 
Korean. The administration hopes that those issues will be absorbed by
 
the children from the environment and role models provided by the
 
school. As Mr. Lee explains:
 
We cannot separate culture, or some history, or some
 
custom [from] the language. So, basically, we teaching
 
for Korean tongue.  Korean writing is easy, 80 we push
 
just for tongue. But if we push too much, they hate
 
Korean language. So, first time, I suggest to teachers
 
1
8
 
that you have t
o do i
s encourage in what i
s
 
interesting. Attending here, they make friend of same
 
skin or same color, so they enjoy school. They, they
 
grow up, i
f they have good memory, .
 .
 .  so just keep
 
tongue .
 .
 .
 .
(Es82-LL-R22)
 
The principal has also found that the students are more receptive
 
to i
iscussions of ethnicity when they come from outsiders rather than
 
members of the Korean community. Accordingly, he has invited two men —
 
one Finnish and the other Polish —to talk to the students about
 
maintaining their ethnic identities. In Mr. Lee's view the response was
 
positive:
 
Kids are very interested about that. Because if [I]
 
push myself, they very [much] hate or are against
 
[
thinking about Korean identity]. But the other person,
 
they [are]  talking about themselves:  "We keep our own
 
heritage, we keep own language, then we [are] so
 
proud." [They say], "Why don't you keep your own
 
language and your own heritage?" Then, a little bit,
 
they [
the students] understand it. (ES82 LL 22)
 
The school day is broken into five 45-minute periods, three of
 
which are spent in the language homeroom classes. The other two are
 
used for music and dance or martial arts. Usually girls take dancing
 
and boys take martial arts, but a few girls choose the latter. Students
 
are divided into three groups for their extracurricular classes:
 
kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grades, and
 
sixth grade through high school. Each teacher has three periods a day
 
but the extracurricular teachers have different groups of children for
 
each period. The language t
eachers have the same students throughout,
 
much like a homeroom situation in an American school.

At t
he end of the school year, every s
tudent r
eceives a r
eport
 
card. The teachers design their own methods for computing a grade, but
 
all of them seemed to use the following grade designations: excellent,
 
good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory or needs improvement. Most o
f
 
them did not emphasize grades, but felt that the students work harder
 
i
f they received grades. The extracurricular classes have their
 
r
eward systems. Students who excel in music can
 
choir sponsored by the Korean Baptist Church, and
 - 
c
lass follows a system used by all karate schools in which differe
 
colored belts represent levels of achievement, the highest being a
 
black belt and the lowest being white. Certificates of achievement are
 
given to those students who have done especially well. The names of
 
those students receiving certificates were read to the audience while
 
the students stood and were applauded at the 1982 graduation ceremony.
 
One child was given an award for being the best student in the school,
 
and another was rewarded for making the most progress. Students
 
graduate from Korean school when they finish American school,
 
regardless of theli Korean—language skills. At that time they receive a
 
diploma stating that they have attended the language program.
 
own
 
The school calendar parallels the one used by American public
 
schools. The First Korean School usually starts classes in early
 
September and ends them in early June. The administration plans for
 
forty Saturdays of school, with perhaps five or six holidays. American
 
public holidays are recognized but not celebrated by the school as a
 
whole. Christian holidays —Christmas and Easter —are usually marked by
 
some classroom activities. The only holidays celebrated by the entire
 
20
 
school are two Korean ones: Chusok,  the fall harvest festival, and the
 
Korean Independence Day on March 1
, which are celebrated by school
 
assemblies and parties.
 
Two i
ssues frequently mentioned by the faculty are the emphasis
 
given to the amount of knowledge a child should be expected to l
earn
 
and the use of English in the classroom. Both are related to the
 
school's desire to impart an understanding and love for Korean heriti'
 
t
o the students  Most of the teachers feel that language is a way t
 
transmit those feelings and should not be an end in itsei:.
 
and quality of language skills are not as important as t

student has towards his ethnic identity and heritage
 
therefore ,  should be enjoyable and interesting for
 
not too demanding.  "They are so busy, and they are just little
 
children. I don't want to give them too much work because, if I do,
 
they will have no time to play, and they will hate Korean school," says
 
one of the Special Class teachers.
 
The amount of English used in the classroom is resolved
 
individually by each teacher. Principal Lee encourages them to speak
 
Korean at all t
imes, but recognizes that the students' level of
 
comprehension makes it difficult:
 
If [we]  talk completely in Korean, they cannot-catch
 
[the meaning and]  feelings. So sometimes,  [for]
 
Important things, we explain in American. But,
 
basically, we have [
emphasize]  learning the Korean
 
tongue, so, if possible
 [we] have to use Korean.
 
(ES82— u

Most of the t
eachers t
ry t
o speak primarily Korean i
n class, but
 
f
ind that they need English to explain vocabulary words and ideas and,
 
sometimes, simply to keep the students' interest. "When I speak only
 
Korean,  they don't understand, and they get bored and don't learn,"
 
says Ok Kyung Kim.  "But when I use English, they are interested and
 
can ask questions. Then they learn." (
Interview 5/22/82)
 
Mr. Lee also feels that it  i
s more important that the s
tudents
 
gain an appreciation for their heritage than speak the language
 
fluently. As he notes:
 
Sometimes they [
teachers] explain in English, because
 
they [students] cannot catch [understand], and they
 
hate Korean. So if youngest are this way when they
 
grow up,  they cannot choose [
to appreciate their
 
heritage], and they will always hate Korean. So [we]
 
have to pay attention to make [
learning Korean]
 
interesting. (ES82-LL-R22)
 
Plans for the future of the school include adding more subjects t
o
 
the curriculum and expanding the extracurricular program. Mr. Lee i
s
 
presently searching for someone to direct a school and community
 
orchestra. He hopes to offer classes that would provide technic
 
training and teach useful job skills, such as automobile maintenance
 
and printing, and is also interested in starting hobby courses for
 
adults and senior citizens. Several members of the school's faculty are
 
presently working with a national association of Korean educators to
 
design textbooks suitable for Korean-American students. They hope that
 
these will be ready for publication within the next two years.
 
22
 
Teachers
 
In i
ts f
irst year the faculty of the First Korean School consisted
 
of six teachers, three of whom are still with the school. The first
 
teachers included Mr. Han-Il Lee, Miss Kwak, Mr. Chang, and Miss Pak,
 
all of whom taught the language classes. In addition, Mrs. Kwun tmith
 
music and Mr. Kim taught taekwondo (Korean martial arts). Mr. Ki:n
 
continues with the school, teaching the high school class, and Miss
 
Kwak teaches the fourth grade. Mr. Lee, t
he principal, also t
eacries a
s
 
a substitute.
 
The f
aculty now numbers thirteen teachers, although the number
 
tends t
o fluctuate during the school year as teachers find they cannot
 
afford the time and energy required, or move. Appendix I provides
 
information about the teachers at the school during the spring semester
 
of  1
982.
 
The first teachers taught on a volunteer basis, but salaries were
 
instituted within the first year. The administration found that the
 
teachers took their work more seriously when they were paid. Before
 
salaries were instituted there was a problem with teachers not coming
 
and not being prepared.
 
A large number of the faculty and administration are members of
 
the First Korean Baptist Church. While membership is not a requirement
 
for hiring, the administration is concerned that the faculty share
 
their values, many of which are based on a Christian belief system.
 
23
 
The school does not formally train its teachers or set
 
requirements regarding the experience and background for hiring, but
 
the administration does try to select teachers with previous training
 
and experience. Most of the teachers are overqualified for elementary
 
and middle school teaching. At least seven have formal training in
 
education from American or Korean institutions. All of the teachers
 
have had some experience working with children. Those who lack formal
 
training or previous teaching experience compensate with understanding
 
and concern for the students and with their commitment to the school.
 
Very few of the teachers are trained specifically for language
 
education. Mr. Park, the junior high school teacher, is the only one
 
involved professionally in teaching the Korean language. Some say that
 
their previous teaching helps them in dealing with the children and
 
structuring their classes, but not particularly with teaching the
 
Korean language. Most find that their task is further complicated by
 
the need to teach cultural values and heritage as well as language.
 
-
 The principal provides guidelines for the classes, but the actual
 
class development is left to the individual teacher. The faculty
 
meets occasionally to plan the curriculum, discuss teaching methods,
 
and gather teaching materials. The faculty and principal usually meet
 
briefly after the morning assembly to discuss immediate concerns and
 
to exchange information. Teachers often meet informally during their
 
morning breaks in the administrative office. This freedom seems to
 
create a good atmosphere among the, faculty and administration. No one
 
24
 
i
ndividual acts as an authority or expert;  r
ather, all work t
ogether t
o
 
develop the best possible teaching methods and materials. The Special
 
Class, for example, results f
rom the t
eachers'  r
ecognizing a need  and
 
designing a way to fulfill it.
 
While teaching Korean language is the primary emphasis of t
 
classes, the more immediate concern of many of the teachers is
 
maintaining the children's interest. Some do so by presenting lessons
 
a
s games, or by changing activities whenever they sense boredom or
 
fatigue among their students. Others try to create a relaxed and
 
cheerful atmosphere. For example, the junior high shcool teacher
 
purchased Ping—Pong equipment for his class to use during breaks, and
 
another teacher periodically takes her class outside for a change of
 
scenery.
 
Some of the teachers are concerned about discipline in the
 
classrooms. One felt that the children, particularly the younger ones,
 
lack discipline at home and in American school aud need to receive a firm
 
hand at the Korean school. Other teachers tended to be more tolerant in
 
their judgments and expectations. Most agreed that the Korean language
 
is demanding and that many of the children find it difficult. Their
 
restlessness in class, they felt, is due more to the nature of the
 
subject and the fact that it i
s Saturday than to a lack of discipline.
 
In Ok Kim, the second grade teacher, proposed another reason
 
behind her class'  somewhat boisterous behavior:
 
25
 
They feel at home here. They're with children who are
 
the same color, and many of them are their friends.
 
Everybody is speaking the language they hear at home.
 
I
t's not like at American school, where they feel
 
they're a little bit different. Here they can be
 
themselves. That's why they're a little noisy.
 
(
Interview 4/3/82)
 
During my observations of the classes I felt that the teachers
 
were tolerant of students' behavior, but not lax. They usually allowed
 
some degree of play and freedom among the students, but the classes
 
never seemed out of control. If the class did become t
oo noisy, the
 
teachers usually quieted i
t by clapping their hands and calling for
 
attention, or by speaking directly to the child. Discipline was always
 
administered with good humor and affection.
 
The teachers' reasons for teaching at the Korean school are
 
primarily altruistic. Some of the reasons given for working at the
 
school include a feeling of responsibility towards the next generation,
 
concern for the ethnic identity of the youth and the possible problems
 
resulting from a lack of ethnic identity, concern for the future
 
economic, social, and emotional welfare of the Korean community in the
 
United States, and love for Korean culture. Also mentioned were a sense
 
of Christian duty to guide youth in the right direction, a calling to
 
teach, and a love for children. Most of the faculty said that they
 
consider their teaching to be a service to the Korean community and
 
that their job is a way to provide role models for Korean values. 'The
 
teachers are really volunteers," says Mr. Lee.  "The salary doesn't pay
 
for anything —except gas money. So the teachers have to have a real
 
[commitment]." (ES82-LL-R22)
 
26
 
Students
 
Forty-five students registered for classes in the school's first
 
year. A total of one hundred and fifty-one students from eighty-six
 
different families were l
isted in the spring 1
982 school directory. All
 
of the students live in Maryland, most of them in middle-class,
 
suburban areas fairly close to the school.3 The student body includes
 
both members and non-members of the First Korean Baptist Church.
 
Most of the students at the First Korean School are between the ages
 
of five and fourteen, although there was some who were older and
 
younger. These ages correspond to American public school grades
 
kindergarten through eighth grade.4
 
A large number of the students seemed to be full-blooded Koreans.
 
At least two were adopted and several came from mixed marriages,
 
however. Most of the adopted children and those from mixed marriages
 
attended the Special Class, except for the younger ones, who were kept
 
with their age group. Although no official count has been made, most of
 
the faculty agreed that all of the schoolchildren had either been born
 
in the United S
tates or had spent a major part of their lives here.
 
All the children I observed spoke English fluently, and many of
 
them consider it their first language. One teacher suggested that
 
perhaps fiity percent of the chldren speak Korean at home. He also
 
observed that it is more likely for a child to be fluent in Korean if
 
27
 
t
he grandparents l
ive with the family. Among themselves the students
 
usually spoke English. They also called each other by their American
 
names rather than the Korean ones used by the teachers. All of them
 
wore A erican clothing to school. Even for special events very few of
 
them wore Korean clothes. Koreans living in Korea today tend to wear
 
WesLern clothes more frequently than Korean clothing, particularly in
 
urban areas. The Korean dress for women consists of a short jacket with
 
full sleeves over and ankle-length full skirt. It i
s still frequently
 
worn, particularly by older women, and by women o
f a
ll ages on special
 
occasions. The men's costume, which consists of a jacket similar t
o the
 
women's over full, long pants, is more rare.
 
In general, the students seemed very Americanized.  "The children
 
look Korean, have Korean skin color and eyes," says Mr. Kim.  "But their
 
thinking and customs are American.  [I]
 think these children [are] not
 
Korean; they're American. (ES82-LL-Rll)
 
The majority of the students said they disliked attending
 
Korean school, claiming that they came only because their parents
 
insisted. Some complained that school was boring; others that it was
 
too difficult. Several said they were tired of classes after five days
 
of American school, and some wanted to watch Saturday morning
 
television. Others had conflicts between Korean school and community
 
activities, such as Little League baseball.
 
28
 
Although most students c
laimed to dislike school, t
hey seemed to
 
have fun while they were there. Many were friends with their classmates
 
and  seemed to like their teachers. They also appeared to enjoy the
 
non-language classes. Martial arts, in particular, elicited keen
 
enthusiasm.
 
Most of the students seemed very aware of their "Korean-ness" and
 
tended to accept it matter-of-factly. One teenager said that it was
 
impossible for him not t
o acknowledge his heritage because his l
ooks
 
are Asian. He feels like an American, eats American food, has American
 
friends, and speaks English fluently. But he recognizes that some
 
aspects of his life differ greatly from the lives of his friends. For
 
example, he likes Korean food and wants to marry a Korean girl so that
 
his wife can prepare it at home.
 
Another teenager wanted to learn Korean so that she could
 
participate in the Korean students' group at the university she planned
 
to attend.  She thought that she would feel most comfortable with other
 
Korean and Korean-American students, even though she spoke fluent
 
English, because they would share her cultural background and values.
 
Korean and Korean-American children tend t
o fit easily into the
 
American ideals of behavior and success. Many of them excel in American
 
schools and hope to continue their education at prestigious
 
institutions, such as Harvard, MIT, and Yale. Of the Korean-American
 
children I spoke to, approximately ninety percent said they make
 
straight A's on their report cards for American school. The same
 
29
 
percentage said they plan on attending college. About half the children
 
said they want a career in one of the medical professions. Striving
 
for success is partly due to respect for their parents' wishes —many
 
see their parents sacrificing for their children's futures —but it
 
also reflects Korean values that encourage hard work, acheivement, and
 
material and academic success.
 
Parents
 
The parents of the students at the Korean school represent a wide
 
range of professions, as well as economic and educational levels. The
 
school has purposely structured its fees not to be a financial burden.
 
It also offers conveniences, such as the van service, so that minimal
 
effort is required from the parents.
 
The administration and faculty feel that an important task is
 
educating the parents about the need to maintain and transmit an
 
appreciation for their Korean heritage in the home. The school cannot
 
achieve its purpose without the support of the parents; Korean
 
language, in particular, cannot be taught without some reinforcement
 
in the home.
 
3
u
 
'
arents'  involvement with the Korean school seemed to be minimal,
 
bciuse of conflicting work schedules. According to the faculty,
 
:en help the children with their homework, but relatively few
 
elf. Those that do help out by substitute
 
-
s, and forming car pools.
 
A parents organization associated with the First Korean Baptist
 
Church exists, but is not very active. Most of the parents are too busy
 
t
o participate. Many of them hold two jobs, or run their own business,
 
often working twelve or more hours a day. Some parents that I talked to
 
said they would like to be more active, but need to get financially
 
established first. The group meets about once a year to discuss the
 
role of the school and current concerns of the parents.
 
The reason most often given by parents for sending their children
 
to the school is that it would be a shame for them to not know their
 
own heritage. They worry that the children will lack a strong sense of
 
self and pride in their heritage, both of which may create oostacles
 
for them in achieving a successful and fulfilled life. The parents are
 
also concerned about the maintenance of the family identity:  they want
 
the family name to to be honored, and they want the children to know
 
their ancestors. Communication between generations is particularly
 
important, and some parents felt that their children were adapting too
 
well to American values and customs. While Koreans do not officially
 
practice ancestor worship, reverence for the ancestors is an integral
 
part of the culture. A point of pride among many of the Koreans I have
 
3
1
 
interviewed in the Washington area i
s their ancestry. Several have
 
shown me extended genealogies that trace their family for fifty to
 
seventy-five generations.
 
Most Korean parents seem to demand a lot from their children.
 
Their high expectations stem from several factors. Traditional Korean
 
values stress achievement and place responsibility on children to bring
 
honor and respect to the family name. Children are seen as the hope of
 
the future:  t
he child will take care of the parents in their old age
 
and will continue the family line, insuring that the family name
 
survives into the future.
 
The parents recognized that the children complain about attending
 
school and learning Korean, but they felt that the children would
 
appreciate the training when they are grown. Several parents who do not
 
send their children to the school said they were concerned about
 
demanding too much from them. Some felt that their children needed to
 
concentrate on learning English, studying for American school, and
 
participating in other activities, such as music lessons. Others said
 
that forcing their children to attend would produce negative reactions
 
to their Korean heritage.
 
32
 
Conclusion
 
Since its creation in 1
977 the First Korean School has grown
 
approximately four times in terms of its original student body and
 
faculty. At least four factors are responsible for this growth.
 
First i
s the commitment and determination of the individuals who
 
organized and developed the school. Their continued efforts to create
 
an effective program have attracted increasing support from the Korean
 
community.
 
Another factor in the school's success is the continued support of
 
the First Korean Baptist Church. The building added by the church in
 
1
980 has enabled the school to expand its classes to hold more
 
students. The church has also provided free rent and utilities,
 
allowing the tuition fees to be used for other expenses.
 
A third factor is the Washin
,:
 
ethnic awareness. The community i
:
 
heritage. It has been settled in Washington long enough for its members
 
to acquire a measure of economic stability, enabling the community t
o
 
support —both financially and emotionally —the maintenance of ethnic
 
language. Many have also been here long enough to realize that such
 
language maintenance i
s not a luxury but a necessity.
 
33
 
Finally there i
s the school' s  broad purpose--to produce good
 
Korean-American citizens. While the school achieves this goal primarily
 
through language classes, i
t has the flexibility to meet both the
 
immediate and long-term needs of its students and the Korean-American
 
community.
 
The First Korean School definitely reflects the concerns of the
 
adult generation of Korean immigrants and Korean-Americans. Their
 
concerns are not limited t
o transmission of cultural heritage, but
 
include the immediate and future welfare of Korean-American
 
children. Nor are those concerned limited to a select group within
 
the Korean community. The actual administration of the school is
 
achieved by a small number of individuals with a variety of educational
 
and occupational credentials, and the larger community displays its
 
support through the continued enrollment of their children.
 
Koreans living in the United States seem to have a strong sense of
 
ethnic identity. Although there is no geographically-delineated
 
community in the Washington area, Koreans living here demonstrate a
 
feeling of community through numerous recreational, occupational, and
 
educational organizations. The effort to institutionalize transmission
 
of culture is not unique to a select segment of the Korean population,
 
but is widespread throughout both the Washington area and the rest of
 
the country.
 
34
 
One of the goals of the Korean school i
s to provide s
tudents with
 
a knowledge of their heritage so that they will have more resources
 
from which to formulate their identity and self-image.  Maintenance of
 
a community does not seem to be a primary goal. Instead, the school
 
stresses family and inter-generational ties. Most Koreans consider a
 
degree of acculturation to be inevitable, if their children are to
 
succeed in this society. A developed personal identity and an
 
appreciation for their heritage will help them to adapt and achieve
 
SUCCCSS.
 
The First Korean School's stated purpose is to produce good
 
Korean-American citizens. In order to be good citizens, the children
 
need a strong sense of identity and an appreciation for their heritage.
 
Korean language is emphasized as a means  both of transmitting a
 
cultural heritage and maintaining strong family ties. Being Korean in
 
America, however, requires more than simply speaking the language. An
 
appreciation for culture, both Eastern and Western, is considered
 
important; music, dance, and martial arts are, therefore, includ
 
the school's curriculum. Achievement and success are also aape
 
the Korean-American identity and are reflected in the school's
 
curriculum through such things as the SAT classes. Informally,  tit
 
school encourages the students to adapt to American life while
 
maintaining an ethnic identity, and the two processes are felt to b
e
 
complementary. The school reflects this attitude in its curriculum and
 
i
ts entire program.

The Korean embassy maintains files on these schools, as well as on
 
'Addresses 
programs throughout the country.
 
Addresses were not provided for all students in the directory, so
 
the following statistics are not complete, but they indicate the
 
geographic distribution of families associated with the school. The
 
following breakdown i
s by families, not by number of students:
 
Silver Spring--2
 
Rockville -12
 
Potomac and  Wheaton--7
 
Olney--5
 
Gaithersburg -4
 
Adeiphi, Beltsville, Hyattsville -3
 
Takoina Park--2
 
Burtonsville, Derwood, Glen Dale, Kensington---1
 
There are no statistics available on the distribution of the Korean
 
population in this area, so these numbers cannot be comapred to the
 
community as a whole. It is interesting to note, however,  that a good
 
number of students come from distances that require a thrity to
 
forty-five minute drive. Most of these students ride the three school
 
vans, but some are driven to school by their parents. Some of the van
 
routes are rather long —one starts two hours before classes begin —and
 
the long ride apparently keeps some children away.
 
Most of these areas are suburban and middle class. Silver Spring
 
is a pleasant neighborhood of middle-class homes, and has a good number
 
of established Asian immigrants. Potomac is an upper-middle to
 
upper-class area of expensive homes and country clubs. The fact that
 
seven Korean families live there attests to the upward mobility of the
 
Korean population. The areas froqi which three or fewer Korean families
 
send childern to the school are middle class to lower middle and
 
working class. The distribution of housing may reflect a corresponden
 
between wealth, awareness of ethnicity, and willingness to participate
 
in an organized attempt to preserve and transmit ethnic heritage.
 
4Age is figured differently in Korea. Children are considered to be a
 
year old at their birth, and sometimes have a second birthday on the
 
Lunar New Year, when all birthdays are traditionally celebrated. See
 
Cornelius Osgood, The Koreans and Their Culture (New York: Ronald
 
Press Co., 1951) for more information about these customs. The Western
 
custom of celebrating one's day of birth is becoming more common,
 
particularly among urban, middle-class Koreans. The childern at the
 
First Korean School sometimes gave both their "Korean age" and
 
"American age." They seemed to prefer the Korean version because it
 
made them older.

church is surrounded by Maryland suburbs. Korean lettering on a sign in

, — Before starting the school Mr. Lee sought advice from a number of
 
people involved in ethnic-language education. The Washington Korean
 
School, the oldest Korean school in the Washington metropolitan area,
 
created in 1970,  provided an example
 an established school. The
 
Korean Embassy's office of education, which works with Korean ethnic
 
schools throughout the country,  supplied other models,  as well as
 
official support and a representative to the school board. Mr. Lee also

T
Bapti st Church,

the Korean community. The rest was paid for by students'  tuitions. The
 
church also provided free use of their facilities and utilities.
 
The Korean Embassy gave the school free textbooks. Although
 
the embassy provides funding for administrative costs to language
 
programs requesting such aid, the First Korean School was ineligible at
 
first because of its connection with the Korean Baptist Church. The
 
mbassy cannot support church-sponsored schools since the Korean
 
vernment claims to have no official religion. When the school later
 
became independent,  its administrators did not request funding from the
 
embassy because they felt the tuition payments sufficed for the
 
school's administrative needs. The embassy later donated a library of
 
some ten thousand books of Korean literature to the school for use both
 
by children and adults. The school plans to organize a national library
 
loan system by which Korean schools in other areas can borrow from
 
their library.
 
In the first years of its existence the school was run primarily
 
by Mr. Han-il Lee. He designed the curriculum, class structure, and
 
school schedule. He also printed the handouts used in all the classes
 
to supplement the texts

Mr. Han-il Lee was principal of the school during its first two
 
years. His official duties included budget matters, policy decisions,
 
and faculty hiring.  Dr. Lee, associate pastor of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church,  replaced Mr. Han-il Lee as principal in 1979. After one
 
year Dr. Lee returned to Korea to a university position; his place
 
was filled by Mr. Park Hee Kyu, former chief of education at the
 
Korean Embassy. Mr. Park was principal for several months, and then the
 
post was returned to Mr. Han-il Lee, who remains school principal.
 
Mr. Lee is currently seeking another principal. He feels that the
 
position should be filled by someone with academic degrees from a
 
prestigious institution, who enjoys community status and respect. He
 
sees the principal as being a figurehead,.
. Aa dl _L
 who will lend '
h
 
status and reputat x to the school. Although he has been principal
 
t
2&s
 
several times, 1 6 lack of a university degree makes him uncomfortable
 
in the role.
 
The job of vice-principal was not formally established until the
 
1981-1982 school year, when Mr. Han-il Lee requested it. The faculty
 
then elected one of its members, Mr. Koh, to the position.
 
Since its creation the Korean School has had a governing board
 
that makes policy decisions. The first board was chosen by Mr. Lee and
 
the leaders of the First Korean Baptist Church. They established a
 
seven- to nine-member organization that included three official
 
members:  the pastor, the director of Christian education, and the
 
president of the parents associati n of the First Korean Baptist
 
7
 
Church. The other positions were filled by representatives of the
 
Korean community, some of whom were specialists in relevant fields.
 
About fifty percent of the board were church members, and most were
 
parents. The board was also divided evenly between United States
 
citizens and recent immigrants. Although board membership has changed
 
over the years, Mr. Lee has tried to insure a mixture of backgrounds in
 
order to obtain a broad range of opinions.
 
Purposes of the School
 
While the First Korean School identifies itself as a language
 
school for teaching the "mother-tongue" to Korean descendants, its
 
administrators state that its primary purpose is to create good
 
Korean-American citizens. iLat can be done beet  .i.a
.gh teaching the
 
Korean language, using it as a vehicle for transmitting Korean value
 
and beliefs, as well as knowledge about Korean culture and history. The y
 
sehool -at
huiI1iscLgI -rs believe that the more a child understands and
 
appreciates his ethnic heritage, the better person he will become and
 
the more smoothly his acculturation into American society will be
 
accomplished. By giving him the opportunity to know his background, the
 
school provides the child with more options to choose _

(ES82-LL-R7)
 
Facilitating communication between generations is I major concern
 
of the Korean School. Language is often a barrier between parents and
 
children  since many Korean families are recent immigrants.  Because of
 
their interaction with native-born English-speakers through their
 
schooling, the children usually learn English within a few years of
 
their arrival, while the parents take much longer. Often parents and
 
grandparents never become fluent in the language and speak Korean among
 
themselves and in their homes. As Mr. Noh says:
 
Their mother tongue, Korean, is needed as a tool of
 
communication between generations. Sometimes, the first
 
generation and second generation .
 .  .  find a gap [in]
 
communicating with each other later on. Then, make kind
 
of tragedy in the immigrant family. So we worry about
 
[
it].  Their mother tongue is basically a tool for
 
communication in the immigrant family. (ES82-LL-R7)
 
The language barrier is particularly obvious in homes where
 
grandparents are living with the family.
 
School administrators are also concerned that differences in
 
values and attitudes may create inter-generational barriers just as
 
troublesome as language. Principal Lee described a representative
 
incident in which a story in a school publication was misunderstood by
 
the students. The story concerned a famous Korean general who often
 
visited a wine shop in his youth. Qne-day, while riding his horse, he
 
fell asleep.  The horse continued walking and carried him to the wine
 
9
 
shop. When the general awoke and found himself there, he realized that
 
he had become addicted to wine. He then killed his horse and began
 
leading an upright life, eventually becoming a great hero.
 
Mr. Lee explained that the moral of this story is that one must
 
dispose of bad influences if one wants to succeed in life. The horse
 
was aiding the general's addiction and therefore had to be destroyed.
 
The Korean parents recognized this moral and agreed with it. Their
 
.
-
 (t'
 
children, however,
 
saw no nobility in the general's actions and(
 
it
's
c
 
felt that he was cruel for needlessly killing his horse.4Mr. Lee hopes\
 '
 
that the school will help the children to understand their parents'
 
attitudes and values. He recognizes that the children may not agree
 
with them, but at least they will know what the values are, and
 r-r
 
may1 choose to accept them.
 
Many of the adult Koreans at the school have a strong sense of
 
their own Korean identity and heritage. They are proud to be Korean and
 
feel strong emotional ties with their motherland. They also feel that
 
an appreciation for Korean ways is a valuable and precious possession,
 
one that should be passed on to future generations. Their involvement
 
in the school is generated partly by these attitudes. "We don't want to
 
forget [Korean heritage]," explains Mr. Noh. "We don't have to get out
 
of that kind of cultural resource. That means that [it] is a kind of
 
mission of the first generation" (ES82-LL-R7).
 
10
 
The administrators are concerned with both the immediate and
 
long-term welfare of the students and of the Korean-American community.
 
The school offers the language classes not only to transmit knowledge
 
of a cultural heritage, but also to provide a central place where
 
Korean-American children can be with others of their background, a
 
place where they can feel comfortable and have a sense of belonging.
 
School administrators hope that the children will maintain the
 
relationships that begin there, strengthening the ties within in the
 
Korean-American community.
 
The administrators are further concerned with the success of the
 
children in achieving their long-term educational and professional
 
Mori W
 '

goals, most of which are set very high
 to provide role
 
models by exposing the children to ethnic Americans who are successful.
 
In terms of the future welfare of the children, the administration
 
believes that it can help most by encouraging them to set high goals.
 
As Han-il Lee says:
 
If you buy a ticket —airplane, bus, train —from here
 
[Washington] to San Francisco, you can get off anywhere
 
along the way. But a ticket to New York, takes you only
 
to New York. In life,  [one has] only one chance. If
 
[
one has] a big goal,  [
one] can go far. If have small
 
goals, only go a small distance. So .  .  .  Korean
 
school tries to give students big goals. (ES82-LL-R16)

School Administration
 
The school's administrators include a school board, the principal,
 
and the vice-principal. The board determines the overall budget and
 
policy matters, such as the purpose and emphasis of the school. The
 
principal handles most administrative details —hiring, application of
 
budget, class schedules, school calendar —and develops a broad outline
 
of the skills and knowldge to be taught to each class each semester.
 
The vice-principal assists the principal in his duties. An
 
administrative assistant also aids the principal, acting as secretary,
 
treasurer, and substitute teacher, preparing the students' morning
 
refreshments, and keeping track of supplies.
 
In 1
980 a new church building was constructed by the church
 
members. The old building was designated as the education building
 
to be used for Sunday school classes, the Korean school, and other
 
community activities. Having a place of its own has made a tremei ju,
 
difference for the school. It has the space to accommodate the growing
 
number of students. It can store its teaching and administrative
 
materials there, and also  has a room set aside for the library given
 
them by the Embassy.
 
The school meets in the First Korean Baptist Church,
 
which provides its facilities free of charge. The church consists of
 
two buildings: the main sanctuary, church administrative offices,
 
1
2
 
kitchen, reception area, and upper-grade classrooms are in a new
 
building, built in 1980; the second building includes a smaller
 
sanctuary, kitchen, and classrooms. The school uses both buildings.
 
The church grounds include an old house where the library was
 
stored until fall of 1982, a small playground, and an extensive parking
 
lot. A basketball hoop and picnic tables by the parking lot are often
 
used by the students during class breaks.
 
Except for the facilties and utilities provided by the Korean
 
Church, the school is financed wholly by the students' tuitions.
 
Seventy percent of these funds go to faculty salaries; the other thirty
 
percent covers supplies and miscellaneous expenses, such as year-end
 
awards —notebooks, pencils, crayons, books, and certificates —and the
 
handouts used as teaching aids. Textbooks were donated by the Korean
 
Embassy; students use them in class, but cannot buy them or take them
 
home.
 
Each student pays $60 per semester. Discounts are given to
 
families having more than one child enrolled:  ten percent for two
 
children, and thirty percent for three or more. Scholarships or
 
remissions of tuition are available to needy children. Korean children
 
adopted into American or Korean-American homes are also eligible for
 
scholarships. Beginning next year Mr. Lee hopes to offer a reduced
 
tuition to children of mixed marriages.

A snack fee is also charged to cover the cost of the juice and
 
doughnuts or fruit that are served every Saturday morning. Children who
 
ride the school vans pay an additional fee of between $5 and $10 each
 
month, depending on the distance from the child's home to the school.
 
Karate uniforms and dance leotards are an additional expense.
 
Teachers are paid an average of S8 an hour for four hours of
 
teaching1 The pay is scaled according to experience and training, bu
 
it  is little more than an honorarium. Some of the teachers double a
s
 
drivers for the three school vans and are paid by
 
work.
 
other two are privately owned by faculty members. The school also ow:
 
its own bus
, but uses 6ML  only when a sizeable number of students
 
need transportation.
 
The Korean school also runs Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
 
preparation courses for high school students. These are taught at night
 
at the church by American teachers brought in from a local high school.
 
The students pay $7.50 an hour for the two-hour sessions held twice a
 
week.

Classes and Curriculum
 
The focus of activity at the First Korean School is the teaching of
 
the Korean language. Language skills are, therefore, the most prominent
 
part of the curriculum.
 
The school originally placed the students into three different
 
levels of language skills. These classes cut across age and school
 
grade, placing seventh graders with first graders. The students
 
disliked this mixture, and the school changed to a system
 
corresponding to the childrens' age and American-school grade. Wae
 
This system proved relatively satisfactory, •and nine
 
qtb
.dt5
 
such levels now exist: kinderga rten
, fi rs t throug
h sixth ? junior
 
high, and senior high.
 
Another class, the Special Class, provides children of any grade
 
with remedial help in reading and writing Korean and basic vocabulary.
 
Sometimes a child will be placed in a higher or lower grade i
t he or
 
she lacks certain skills. Some of the children were embarrassed that they
 
were. in a lower grade —one said that she had flunked out of the other clas .
 
Because the children tend to interpret such actions in this way, the tea-
chers try to keep the children in their respective grades.
 
No standard tests are given to students to assess their ability or
 
skills. Each teacher is responsible for monitoring the progress of
 
their students. This system of grouping the students results in a wide
 
range of abilities in each class and poses structuring difficulties for
 
1
5
 
teachers. The school i
s still searching for a system that would better
 
accomodate the range of skills and abilities displayed by each age
 
group. The principal hopes to get ideas from other ethnic schools.
 In
 
the meantime, Mr. Han-il Lee has suggested that they divide the class
 
into three levels and give separate assignments to each level, but this
 
is the teacher's option.
 
These basic classes focus on Korean language skills: reading,
 
writing, vocabulary, grammar, and conversation. Reading exercises are
 
based on handouts, textbooks, and sentences and phrases written on the
 
blackboa d. The students usually take turns reading out loud, although
 
some teachers have their students read out loud together.
 
The reading lessons often include traditional Korean stories.
 
During one fourth-grade class students chose characters in a story and
 
read those parts out loud. Teachers also use the stories for question
 
and answer sessions to test the students' comprehension.
 
Writing exercises usually involve copying text from the blackboard
 
and from handouts. Quizzes which combine dictation and spelling are a
 
standard part of most of the classes, and students are often given
 
homework consisting of writing exercises.
 
1
6
 
After a student has acquired the basic skills of reading and
 
writing, vocabulary and grammar lessons make up a major part of their
 
class t
ime. Students are usually given vocabulary words to learn at
 
home, which they practice in class. Grammar lessons often involve
 
building phrases and sentences out of the new words.
 
Korean conversation is also a part of most of the classes. Teachers
 
often generate conversation by asking questions in Korean. They also
 
encourage students to speak Korean througout the day, but the children
 
invariably speak English among themselves.
 
All the teachers use the standardized Korean textbooks donated by
 
the Korean Embassy, but most of them feel that they are inadequate for
 
Korean-American children. The students often use texts several grades
 
behind them, since they lack the vocabulary to understand the ones for
 
their o
wn age group,and the subjects, people, and places mentioned in
 
the texts tend to be foreign to their experiences. "Our situation i
s
 
different —everyday life, thinking, everything is different for
 
students here from the textbooks.
 So they need something they know,"
 
r
. '

Most of the teachers design handouts to supplement the textbooks.

From the beginning the school has included music and martial arts
 
along with its language classes. Dance was added several years ago. The
 
evening course to prepare s
tudents for the SAT college entrance exams
 
was established in 1979.
 
The administration hopes that the extracurricular classes will
 
entertain +he students and provide a break from the language study.
 
They are concerned that the children, finding the language classes too
 
demanding and tedious, may lose interest in Korean. They also hope
 
that the extracurricular classes will expose the students to additional
 
asspects of Korean culture and values.
 
Korean history, literature, and culture are included informally in
 
all the classes. Teachers sometimes give lectures on those subjects in
 
the upper grades, but teachers for the younger students try to
 
incorporate history and culture into reading and writing exercises.
 
Some teachers also include discussions of ethnicity in their
 
classes.
 Such topics are difficult to fit into the curriculum since
 
most of the students lack the vocabulary to understand complex ideas
 
in Korean.
 The adminstration is also hesitant to emphasize such
 
issues, feeling that it is best to provide an environment in which
 
the children can discuss their ethnicity when they feel ready and
 
comfortable to.
 As Mr. Lee explains:
 
We cannot separate culture, or some history, or some
 
custom [from]  the language. So, basically, we teaching
 
for Korean tongue.  Korean wfiting is easy, so we push
 
just for tongue. But if we push too much, they hate
 
Korean language. So, first time, I suggest to teachers
 
1
8
 
that you have to do is encourage in what i
s
 
interesting. Attending here, they make friend of same
 
skin or same color, so they enjoy school. They, they
 
grow up, if they have good memory,  .
 .
 .  so just keep
 
t
ongue .
 .
 .
 .
(ES82-LL-R22)
 
The principal has also found that the students are more receptive
 
to Uscussions of ethnicity when they come from outsiders rather than
 
members of the Korean community. Accordingly, he has invited two men —
 
one Finnish and the other Polish —to talk to the students about
 
maintaining their ethnic identities.  In Mr. Lee's view the response was
 
positive:
 
Kids are very interested about that. Because if [I]
 
push myself, they very [much] hate or are against
 
[
thinking about Korean identity]. But the other person,
 
they [are]  talking about themselves: "We keep our own
 
heritage, we keep own language, then we [are] so
 
proud." [They say],
 "Why don't you keep your own
 
language and your own heritage?" Then, a little bit,
 
they [
the students] understand it. (ES82-LL-22)
 
The school day is broken into five 45-minute periods, three of
 
which are spent in the language homeroom classes. The other two are
 
used for music and dance or martial arts. Usually girls take dancing
 
and boys take martial arts, but a few girls choose the latter. Students
 
are divided into three groups for their extracurricular classes:
 
kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grades, and
 
sixth grade through high school./Each teacher hs t

At the end of the school year, every student receives a r
eport
 
card. The teachers design their own methods for computing a grade, but
 
all of them g
ed
 use the following grade designations: excellent,
 
good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory or needs improvement. Most of
 
them did not emphasize grades, but
 that the students work harder
 
i
f they received grades. The extracurricular classes have their own
 
reward systems. Students who excel in music can join the children's
 
choir sponsored by the Korean Baptist Church, and the martial arts
 
class follows a system used by all karate schools in which different
 
colored belts represent levels of achievement, the highest being a
 
black belt and the lowest being whi
2J
rtificates of achievement are
 
given to those students who have done especially well. he names of
 
"o&  students receiving certificates were read to the audience while
 
the students stood and were applauded at the 1982 graduation ceremony,
 
One child was given an award for being the best student in tb
 
and another was rewarded for making the most progress. Studen'
 
graduate from Korean school when they finish American school,
 
regardless of their Korean—language skills. At that time they receive a
 
diploma stating that they have attended the language program.
 
The school calendar parallels the one used by American public
 
schools. The First Korean School usually starts classes in early
 
September and ends them in early June. The administration plans for
 
forty Saturdays of school, with qaahapLs five or six holidays. American
 
public holidays are recognized but not celebrated by the school as a
 
whole. Christian holidays —Christmas and Easter —are usually marked by
 
some classroom activities. The only, holidays celebrated by the entire
 
20
 
school are two Korean ones: Chusok, the fall harvest festival, and i
 
1
34 i
 
Korean Independence Day on March 1, which are celebrated by school
 
assemblies and parties.
 
Two i
ssues frequently mentioned by the faculty are the emphasis
 
given to the amount of knowledge a child should be expected to learn
 
and the use of English in the classroom. Both are related to the
 
school's desire to impart an understanding and love for Korean heritage
 
to the students. Most of the teachers feel that language is a way to
 
transmit those feelings and should not be an end in itself. The amount
 
and quality of language skills are not as important as the attitudes a
 
student has towards his ethnic identity and heritage. Classes,
 
therefore ,  should be enjoyable and interesting for the students, and
 
not too demanding.  "They are so busy, and they are just little
 
children. I don't want to give them too much work because, if I do,
 
they will have no time to play, and they will hate Korean school," says
 
one of the Special Class teachers.
 
The amount of English used in the classroom is resolved
 
individually by each teacher. Principal Lee encourages them to speak
 
Korean at all times, but recognizes that the students' level of
 
comprehension makes it difficult:
 
If
 talk completely in Korean, they cannot catch
 
[
the meaning and] feelings. So sometimes,  [for]
 
important things, we explain in American. But,
 
basically, we have [
emphasize] learning the Korean
 
tongue, so, if possible, LiEl have to use Korean.
 
(Es82-LL-R22)

Most of the teachers try to speak primarily Korean in class, but
 
find that they need English to explain vocabulary words and ideas and,
 
sometimes, simply to keep the students' interest. "When I speak only
 
Korean, they don't understand, and they get bored and don't learn,"
 
says Ok Kyung Kim.  "But when I use English, they are interested and
 
can ask questions. Then they learn." (Interview 5/22/82)
 
Mr. Lee also feels that it  is more important that the students
 
gain an appreciation for their heritage than speak the language
 
fluently. As he notes:
 
Sometimes they [
teachers] explain in English, because
 
they [
students] cannot catch [understand], and they
 
hate Korean. So if youngest are this way when they
 
grow up, they cannot choose [
to appreciate their
 
heritage], and they will always hate Korean. So [we]
 
have to pay attention to make [learning Korean]
 
interesting.  (ES82 -LL-R22)
 
Plans for the future of the school include adding more subjects to
 
the curriculum and expanding the extracurricular program. Mr. Lee is
 
presently searching for someone to direct a school and community
 
orchestra. He hopes to offer classes that would provide technical
 
training and teach useful job skills, such as automobile maintenance
 
and printing, and is also interested in starting hobby courses for
 
adults and senior citizens. Several members of the school's faculty are
 
presently working with a national association of Korean educators to
 
design textbooks suitable for Korean-American students. They hope that
 
these will be ready for publication within the next two years.

Teachers
 
In its f
irst year the faculty of the First Korean School consisted
 
o
f six teachers,  three of whom are still with the school. The first
 
t
eachers included Mr. Han-11 Lee, Miss Kwak, Mr. Chang, and Miss Pak,
 
all of whom taught the language classes. In addition, Mrs. Kwun taught
 
music and Mr. Kim taught taekwondo (Korean martial arts). Mr. Kim
 
continues with the school, teaching the high school class, and Miss
 
Kwak teaches the fourth grade. Mr. Lee, the principal, also teaches as

A large number of the faculty and administration are members of
 
the First Korean Baptist Church. While membership is not a requirement
 
for hiring, the administration is concerned that the faculty share
 
their values, many of which are bi ed on a Christian belief system.
 
23
 
The school does not formally train its teachers or set
 
requirements regarding the experience and background for hiring, but
 
the administration does try to select teachers with previous training
 
and experience. Most of the teachers are overqualified for elementary
 
and middle school teaching. At least seven have formal training in
 
education from American or Korean institutions) All of the teachers
 
have had some experience working with children. Those who lack formal
 
training or previous teaching experience compensate with understanding
 
and concern for the students and with their commitment to the school.
 
Very few of the teachers are trained specifically for language
 
education. Mr. Park, the junior high school teacher, is the only one
 
involved professionally in teaching the Korean language. Some say that
 
their previous teaching helps them in dealing with the children and
 
structuring their classes, but not particularly with teaching the
 
Korean language. Most find that their task is further complicated by
 
the need to teach cultural values and heritage as well as language.
 
The principal provides guidelines for the classes, but the actual
 
class development is left to the individual teacher. The faculty
 
meets occasionally to plan the curriculum, discuss teaching methods,
 
and gather teaching materials. The faculty and principal usually meet
 
briefly after the morning assembly to discuss immediate concerns and
 
to exchange information. Teachers often meet informally during their
 
morning breaks in the administrative office. This freedom seems to
 
create a good atmosphere among the'f culty and administration. No one
 
24
 
individual acts as an authority or expert; rather, all work together to
 
develop the best possible teaching methods and materials. The Special
 
Class, for example, results from the .e
.ache
.rsX
 recognizing a need and
 
designing a way to fulfill i
t.
 
While teaching Korean language is the primary emphasis of the
 
classes, the more immediate concern of many of the teachers is
 
maintaining the children's interest. Some do so by presenting lessons
 
as games, or by changing activities whenever they sense boredom or
 
fatigue among their students. Others try to create a relaxed and
 
cheerful atmosphere. For example, the junior high shcool teacher
 
purchased Ping-Pong equipment for his class to use during breaks, and
 
another teacher periodically takes her class outside for a change of
 
scenery.
 
Some o
f t
he teachers are concerned about discipline in the
 
classrooms. One felt that the children, particularly the younger ones,
 
i
ck discipline at home and in American school and need to receive a firm
 
-I
nd at the Korean school. Other teachers tended to be more tolerant in
 
i
eir judgments and expectations. Most agreed that the Korean language
 
is demanding and that many of the children find it difficult. Their
 
restlessness in class, they felt, is due more to the nature of the
 
s
ubject and the fact that it is Saturday than to a lack of discipline.
 
c
j
j 
Ok K
E e second grade teacher
proposed another reason
 
behind her class' somewhat boisterous behavior:
 
25
 
They feel at home here. They're with children who are
 
the same color, and many of them are their friends.
 
Everybody is speaking the language they hear at home.
 
It's not like at American school, where they feel
 
they're a little bit different. Here they can be
 
themselves. That's why they're a little noisy.
 
(Interview 4/3/82)
 
During my observations of the classes I felt that the teachers
 
were tolerant of students' behavior, but not lax. They usually allowed
 
some degree of play and freedom among the students, but the classes
 
never seemed out of control. If the class did become too noisy, the
 
teachers usually quieted it by clapping their hands and calling for
 
attention, or by speaking directly to the child. Discipline was always
 
administered with good humor and affection.
 
The teachers' reasons for teaching at the Korean school are
 
primarily altruistic. Some of th  reasons
 
c-hoi l include a feeling of responsibility towards the next generation,
 
concern for the ethnic identity of the youth and the possible problems
 
resulting from a lack of ethnic identity, concern for the future
 
economic, social, and emotional welfare of the Korean community in the
 
United States, and 
4 love for Korean culture. Also men
ti one
d were
 a sense
 
of Christian duty to guide youth in the right direction, a calling t
o
 
teach, and a love for children. Most of the fac u
tv  s i
iid  t wit  tht v
 
consider their teaching to be a service to the K
r
ii  coinnut ity
 
that their job is a way to provide role models for Korean values. "it.
 
teachers are really volunteers," says Mr. Lee.  "The salary doesn't pay
 
for anything--except gas money. So the teachers have to have a real
 
[
commitment]." (ES82-LL-R22)

Students
 
Forty-five students registered for classes in the school's first
 
rc
 -1
 
year. A total of one hundred and fifty-one students from eighty-six
 
different families were listed in the # i g 19 2 school directory. All
 
of the students live in Maryland, most of them in middle-class,
 
suburban areas fairly close to the school.3 The student body includes
 
both members and non-members of the First Korean Baptist Church.
 
Most of the students at the First Korean School are between the ages
 
of five and fourteen, although there was some who were older and
 
younger. These ages correspond to American public school grades
 
kindergarten through eighth grade.4
 
A large number of the students seemed to be full-blooded Koreans.
 
At least two were adopted and several came from mixed marriages

All the children I observed spoke English fluently, and many of
 
them consider it their first language. One teacher suggested that
 
perhaps fi f

observed that it is more likely for a child to be fluent in Korean if
 
the grandparents live with the family. Among themselves the s

-re. Many were friends with their classmates
 
and  seemed to like their teachers. They also appeared to enjoy the
 
non-language classes. Martial arts,  in  particular, elicited keen
 
enthusiasm.
 
Most o
f t
i
'e students s
eem ed very aware of their 'Koreami-uess  and
 
,
-ended to accept it matter-of-factly. One teenager said that it was
 
:
npossible for him not to acknowledge his heritage because his looks
 
re  Asian. He feels like an American, eats American food, has American
 
friends, and speaks English fluently. But he recognizes that some
 
aspects of his life differ greatly from the lives of his friends. For
 
example, he likes Korean food and wants to marry a Korean girl so that
 
£
 
his wife can  prepare it at home.
 
Another teenager wanted to learn Korean so that she could
 
participate in the Korean students' group at the university she planned
 
?' o
 re
 
to attend.  She thought that she would feel meet comfortable with other
 
Korean and Korean-American students, even though she spoke fluent
 
English, because they would share her cultural background and values.
 
Korean and Korean-American children tend to fit easily into the
 
American ideals of behavior and success. Many of them excel in American
 
schools and hope to continue their education at prestigious
 
institutions, such as Harvard, MIT, and Yale. Of the Korean-American
 
children I spoke to, approximately ninety percent said they make
 
straight A
's on their report cards for American school. The same
 
29
 
percentage said they plan on attending college. About half the children
 
said they want a career in one of the medical professions. Striving
 
for success is partly due to respect for their parents' wishes —many
 
see their parents sacrificing for their children's futures —but it
 
also reflects Korean values that encourage hard work, acheivement, and
 
material and academic success.
 
Parents
 
The parents of the students at the Korean school represent a wide
 
range of professions, as well as economic and educational levels. The
 
school has purposely structured its fees not to be a financial burden.
 
It also offers conveniences, such as the van service, so that minimal
 
effort is required from the parents.
 
The administration and faculty feel that an important task is +o
 
educati ng the parents about the need to maintain and transmit an
 
appreciation for their Korean heritage in the home. The school cannot
 
achieve its purpose without the support of the parents; Korean
 
language, in particular, cannot be taught without some reinforcement
 
in the home.
 
30
 
Parents' involvement with the Korean school seemed to be minimal,
 
often because of conflicting work schedules. According to the faculty,
 
parents often help the children with their homework, but relatively few
 
assist at the school itself.  • oc th
—do help out by substitute
 
teaching, bringing snacks, and forming car pools.
 
A parents organization associated with the First Korean Baptist
 
Church exists, but is not very active. Most of the parents are too busy
 
t
o participate. Many of them hold two jobs, or run their own business,
 
often working twelve or more hours a day. Some parents that I talked to
 
said they would like to be more active, but need to get financially
 
established first. The group meets about once a year to discuss the
 
role of the school and current concerns of the parents.
 
The reason most often given by parents for sending their children
 
to the school is that it would be a shame for them to not know their
 
own heritage. They worry that the children will lack a strong sense of
 
.
eeLf and pride in their heritage, both of which may create obstacles
 
for them in achieving a successful and fulfilled life. The parents are
 
also concerned about the maintenance of the family identity:  they want
 
the family name to to be honored, and they want the children to know
 
their ancestors. Communication between generations is particularly
 
important, and some parents felt that their children were adapting too
 
well to American values and customs. While Koreans do
,
. not officially
 
practice ancestor worship, reverence for the ancestors is an integral
 
part of the culture,

shown me extended genealogies that trace their family for fifty to
 
Most Korean parents seem to demand a lot from their children.
 
Their high expectations stem from several factors. Traditional Korean
 
values stress achievement and place responsibility on children to bring
 
honor and respect  to the family name. Children are seen as the hope of
 
the future:  the child will take care of the parents in their old age
 
and will continue the family line,  insuring that  the family name
 
su rv ives into the future.

The First Korean School directly reflects the concerns of the
 
adult generation of Korean immigrants and Korean-Americans in the
 
Washington area.
 These concerns are not limited to transmission
 
of cultural heritage, but include the immediate and future wel-
fare of Korean-American children.  Nor are the individuals in-
volved limited to a select group within the Korean community.
 
The school's administrators and faculty hold a range of educational
 
and occupational credentials, and the larger community disrlsys its
 
support through-he continued enrollment of its children.
 
Since its creation in 1977 the First Korean School has
 
grown approximately four times the s
ize of its original student
 
body and faculty.
 At least four factors are responsible for this
 
growth.
 
First is the committment and determination of the individuals
 
who organized and developed the school.
 Their continued efforts
 
to create an effective program have increasingly attracted support
 
from the Korean community.
 
Another factor is the continued support of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church.
 The building added by the church in 1980 has
 
enabled the school to expand its classes to hold more students,
 
while the free rent and utilities provided by the church have
 
allowed the tuition fees to be used for other expenses.
 
A third factor in the school's success is the Washing ton
 
area Korean-American community and its1 egree of ethnic awareness.
 
The community is proud of its heritage and has developed strong 
, c
 
networks between its members through a variety of occupationaLj nd
 
religious organizations.
 It has also been settled in Washington
 
long enough for its members to acquire a measure'
 '
of economic sta-
bility, enabling the community to support--both financially and
 
socially--the maintenance of ethnic language.  Many have also been
 
here long enough to realize t
-ha  such language maintenance is not
 
a luxury but a necessity.

Tjj conclusion t the school tries to instill a sense of etnni
 
identity in its students while simultaneously-assisting t

selves an identity as Korean-Americans.
 The s
c ocl hopes that
 
its efforts will provide resources for that task.

1For a concise introduction to Korean immigration to the United States,
 
see Hyung-chan Kim,  "Koreans," Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic
  
Groups, ed. Stephan Therastrom (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
 
1
981), pp. 601-601. For a more detailed history refer to Hyung-chan
 
Kim, The Koreans in America, 1881-1974 (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.: Oceana
 
Publications,  1
974).
 
2The Korean embassy maintains files on these schools, as well as on
 
anguage programs throughout the country.
 
Addresses were not provided for all students in the directory, so
 
the following statistics are not complete, but they indicate the
 
geographic distribution of families associated with the school. The
 
following breakdown is by families, not by number of students:
 
Silver Spring--2
 
Rockville -12
 
Potomac and Wheaton--7
 
Olney--5
 
Gaithersburg -4
 
Adeiphi, Beltsville, Hyattsville--3
 
Takoma Park -2
 
Burtonsville, Derwood, Glen Dale, Kensington--1
 
i
i
-re are no statistics available on the distribution of the Korean
 
population in this area, so these numbers cannot be comapred to the
 
community as a whole. It is interesting to note, however, that a good
 
number of students come from distances that require a thrity to
 
forty-five minute drive. Most of these students ride the three school
 
vans, but some are driven to school by their parents. Some of the van
 
routes are rather long —one starts two hours before classes begin —and
 
the long ride apparently keeps some children away.
 
Most of these areas are suburban and middle class. Silver Spring
 
i
s a pleasant neighborhood of middle-class homes, and has a good number
 
of established Asian immigrants. Potomac is an upper-middle to
 
upper-class area of expensive homes and country clubs. The fact that
 
seven Korean families live there attests to the upward mobility of the
 
Korean population. The areas from which three or fewer Korean families
 
send childern to the school are middle class to lower middle and
 
working class. The distribution of housing may reflect a correspondence
 
between wealth, awareness of ethnicity, and willingness to participate
 
in an organized attempt to preserve and transmit ethnic heritage.
 
4Age is figured differently in Korea. Children are considered to be a
 
year old at their birth, and sometimes have a second birthday on the
 
Lunar New Year, when all birthdays are traditionally celebrated. See
 
Cornelius Osgood, The Koreans and Their Culture (New York: Ronald
 
Press Co., 1
951) for more information about these customs. The Western
 
custom of celebrating one's day of birth is becoming p
iore common,
 
particularly among urban, middle-class Koreans. The childern at the
 
First Korean School sometimes gave both their "Korean age  and
 
"American age." They seemed to prefer the Korean version because it
 
made them older.
 
In 1
982 estimated 600,000 Koreans and Korean-Americans were living
 
in the United States, congregated in three major population centers:
 
Los Angeles (with about 200,000 Korean residents), Chicago, and New
 
York. San Francisco and Washington, D.C. have the next largest Korean
 
populations. The Korean Embassy estimates that between 35,000 and
 
40,000 Koreans live in the Washington metropolitan area, the locale of
 
the school in this study.
 
The majority of the Korean population in the United States arrived
 
within the last twenty years. The Washington D.C. population is even
 
more recent —only five to ten years old. WThe
 first generation of
 
Koreans born in America is now coming of age, and the problems they
 
face are new ones for the Korean community.

Many come, for occupational ó  educational reasona) others want to
 
escape what they feel is an overly competititve and restrictive society
 
in Korea. Still others come to provide their children with
 
opportunities they might not have
 
in their homeland. By emigrating,
 
many give up established careers, social status, and economic security.
 
Their first years here are often a struggle for survival, full of long
 
hours at low paying jobs. Even so, most Korean immigrants succeed
 
financially in the  United States, often achieving economic stability
 
within five or ten years. Many of them own their homes and businesses
 
and send their children to the best schools and colleges.
 
2
 
Koreans have a great deal of pride iii  their heritage. Their
 
history, which extends back 5
,000 years, has been a continuous struggle
 
to maintain an identity distinct from that of Japan and China. The
 
small country has nurtured many scholars, artists, and inventors. A
 
respect for tradition and the past, which is reinforced by the
 
contemporary achievements of Koreans,  i
s an integral part of Korean
 
culture . On the whole, Koreans living in the United States have
 
retained their cultural pride; they maintain a distinctive personal
 
e
thnic identity and express a community iaentity through numerous
 
ethnic organizations.
 
Christian churches, particularly Presbyterian and Baptist,
 
function as the central social organization in many Korean communities.
 
Washington, D.C. has over sixty Korean churches, many of which have
 
their own buildings. They offer a variety of services to the Korean
 
community, including Korean language classes for children.
 
Approximately twelve Washington-area churches sponsor such classes.
 
In some r
espects, the Korean population in the Washington
 
metropolitan area is not typical of other Korean communities.  L
 
members have a higher level of education and income than Koreans in
 
other parts of the country, and they tend to be more recent arrivals.
 
They also appreciate the need for language and culture maintenance,
 
supporting a total of twenty-four language schools.\2J

maintains relations with the church, but is growing increasingly
 
independent in financial and policy matters. It is also growing in size
 
and reputation.
 
The seh-o&l is located in Silver Spring, Maryland in the annex and
 
basement classrooms of the First Korean Baptist Church. Situated on
 
Georgia Avenue, five miles beyond the Washington, D.C. beltway, the
 
church is surrounded by Maryland suburbs. Korean lettering on a sign in
 
front of the building is the only indication of the church's ethnic
 
identity.
 
Over 1
50 kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and high school
 
students attend the First Korean School. A faculty of thirteen teachers
 
and two administrators teach the classes in Korean language, music,
 
dance, and martial arts. The primary emphasis is on Korean lang
 
(both reading and speaking), but other subjects are included t
 
attract the children's interest and to expose them to Korean culture and
 
values.

Classes meet every Saturday from 9
:30 A
.M. to 1
:00 P.M. and follow
 
the American public school calendar, with summer and winter vacations.
 
The school celebrates  most American holidays, as well
  as selected
 
Korean ones. Students enroll by semester and receive report cards and
 
certificates of achievement at the end of the school year.
 
Although the school is nominally independent of the church in
 
which its classes are held, members of the First Korean Baptist Church
 
play important roles in the school's administration. The church also
 
provides classroom space and utilities, but in all other ways the
 
school i
s self-supporting, earning funds for faculty salaries and
 
supplies from the students' tuition fees.
 
The First Korean School was created by a small group of Korean
 
immigrants living in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Mr.
 
Han-il Lee, the current principal, initiated the idea and spearheaded

School,
, the oldest Korean school in the Washington metropolitan area,-
rovided an example of an established school. The
 
Korean Embassy's office of education, which works with Korean ethnic
 
schools throughout the country, supplied other models, as well as
 
official support and a representative to the school board. Mr. Lee also
 
drew ideas from other ethnic communities —specifically, Finnish,
 
Polish, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese —and their organizations.
 
5
 
Mr. Lee also organized the original financing of the school. He
 
obtained approximately one-third of the funds for supplies and
 
administrative expenses from the First Korean Baptist Church, which
 
considered this aid to be part of its Christian service to the Korean
 
community. The rest was paid for by students'  tuitions. The church also
 
provided free use of their facilities and utilities.
 
The Korean Embassy gave the school free textbooks. Although
 
the embassy provides funding for administrative costs to language
 
programs requesting such aid, the First Korean School was ineligible at
 
first because of its connection with the Korean Baptist Church. The
 
/
 
embassy cannot support church sponsored schools since the Korean
 
government claims to have no official religion. When the school later
 
became independent, its administrators did not request funding from the
 
embassy because they felt the tuition payments sufficed for the
 
school's administrative needs. The embassy later donated a library of
 
)
 ome ten thousand books of Korean literature to the school for use both
 
by children and adults. The school plans to organize a national library
 
A
 
loan system by which Korean schools in other areas can borrow from
 
their library.
 
In the first years of its existence the school was run primarily
 
by Mr. Han-il Lee. He designed the curriculum, class structure, and

and faculty hiring.

over the years, Mr. Lee has tried to insure a mixture of backgrounds

Purposes of the School
 
While the First Korean School identifies itself as a language
 
school for teaching the "mother tongue" to Korean descendents, its
 
administrators state that its primary purpose is to create good
 
Korean-American citizens. They believe that the more a child
 
understands and appreciates his ethnic heritage, the better perso:
 
will become and the more smoothly his acculturation into American
 
society will be accomplished. By giving him the opportunity to kn.
 
background, the school provides the child with more options to choose
 
from when he begins to develop his own perspective on his ethnic
 
identity. These goals can best be accomplished by teaching the Korean
 
language, using it as a vehicle for transmitting Korean values and
 
beliefs, as well as knowledge about Korean culture and history.
 
8
 
Facilitating communication between generations i
s another  major
 
concern of the Korean School. Language is often a barrier between
 
parents and children, particularly since many Korean families are
 
recent immigrants. Because of their interaction with native-horn
 
English-speakers through their schooling, the children usually learn
 
English within a few years of their arrival, while the parents take
 
much longer. Often parents and grandparents never become fluent in the
 
language and speak Korean among themselves and in their homes. As Mr.
 
Noh says:
 
Their mother tongue, Korean, is needed as a tool of
 
communication between generations. Sometimes, the first
 
generation and second generation .  .  .  find a gap [
in]
 
communicating with each other later on. Then, make kind
 
of tragedy in the immigrant family. So we worry about
 
[
it].  Their mother tongue is basically a tool for
 
communication in the immigrant family.  (ES82-LL-R7)
 
The language barrier is particularly obvious in homes where
 
grandparents are living with the family.
 
School administrators are also concerned that differences in
 
values and attitudes may  create inter-generational barriers just as
 
troublesome as language. Principal Lee described a representative
 
incident in which a story in a school publication was misunderstood by
 
the students. The story concerned a famous Korean general who often
 
visited a wine shop in his youth. One day, while riding his horse, he
 
fell asleep.  The horse continued walking and carried him to the wi n
 
shop. When the general awoke and found himself there, he realized that
 
he had become addicted to wine. He then killed his horse and began
 
leading an upright life, eventually
-- 
b
oming a great hero.
 
9
 
Mr. Lee explained that the moral of this story i
s that one must
 
dispose of bad influences if one wants to succeed in life. The horse
 
was aiding the general's addiction and therefore had to be destroyed.
 
The Korean parents recognized this moral and agreed with it. Their
 
children, however, saw no nobility in the general's actions and felt
 
that he was cruel for needlessly killing his horse. Such different
 
interpretations reflect different values and codes o
f behavior. Mr. Lee
 
hopes that the school will help the children t
erstand their
 
parents' attitudes and values. He recognizes that the children may not
 
agree with them, but at least they will know what the values are, and
 
may later choose to accept them.
 
Many of the adult Koreans at the school have a strong sense of
 
their own Korean identity and heritage. They are proud to be Korean and
 
feel strong emotional ties with their motherland. They also feel that
 
an appreciation for Korean ways is a valuable and precious possession,
 
one that should be passed on to future generations. Their involvement
 
in the school is generated partly by these attitudes. "We don't want t
 
/
Ov e
 
V  forget [Korean heritage]," explains Mr. Noh. "We don't have to get out
 
of that kind of cultural resource. That means that [
it] is a kind of
 
mission of the first generation" (ES82-LL-R7).
 
The administrators are concerned with both the immediate and
 
long-term welfare of the students and of the Korean-American community.
 
The school offers the language classes not only to transmit knowledge
 
of a cultural heritage
 
also to provide '
a central place where
 
10
 
Korean -American children can be with others of their background, a
 
place where they can feel comfortable and have a sense of belonging.
 
School administrators hope that the children will maintain the
 
/
relationships that begin there, strengthening the ti es within
 
Korean-American community.
 
The administrators are further concerned with the success of the
 
children in achieving their long-term educational and professional
 
goals, most of which are set very high. Along with instruction and
 
o
,v
-
 
sc cc
 
gu1dance they try to provide role models by exposing the children t
o
 
ethnic I
ricans who are successful. In terms of the future welfare of
 
the children, the administration believes that it can help most by
 
encouraging them to set high goals. As Han-il Lee says:
 
If you buy a ticket —airplane, bus, train —from here
 
[Washington] to San Francisco, you can get off anywhere
 
along the way. But a ticket to New York, takes you only
 
to New York. In life,  [
one has] only one chance. If
 
[one has] a big goal,  [one]  can go far. If have small
 
goals, only go a small distance. So .

school  tries t

ig goals.  (gS82-LI-R V)
 
School Administration
 
The school's administrators include a school board, the  principal,
 
and the vice-principal. The board determines the overall budget and
 
policy matters, such as the purpose and emphasis of the school. The
 
principal handles most administrative details —hiring, application of
 
budget, class schedules, school calendar--and develops a broad outline

of the skills and knowidge to be

The vice-principal assists the principal in his duties. An
 
administrative assistant also aids the principal, acting as secretary,
 
treasurer, and substitute teacher, preparing the students' morning
 
refreshments, and keeping track of supplies.

Classes and Curriculum
 
The focus of activity at the First Korean School is the teaching of
 
the Korean language. Language &kl+lq are, therefore, the most prominent
 
part of the curriculum.
 
The school originally placed the students into three different
 
levels e
language skil. k'The
 classes cut across age and school
 
grade, placing seventh graders with first graders. The students

system proved
 
(
a
 
relatively satisfactory, and nine s4e4-4eva4  now exist: kindergarten,
 
first through sixth grades, junior high, and senior high.
 
Another class,  the Special Class, provides children of any grade
 
with remedial help in reading and writing Korean and basic vocabulary.
 
Sometimes a child will be placed in a higher or lower grade if he or
 
she lacks certain skills. Some of the children were embarrassed that they
 
were in a lower grade —one said that she had flunked out of the other class.
 
Because the children tend to interpret such actions in this way, the tea
-;L"
 
chers try to keep the children in their respective grades.
 
No standard tests are given to students to assess their ability or
 
skills. Each teacher is responsible for monitoring the progress o
 
their students.
tem of grouping the students results in a
 
range of abilities in each class and poses structuring difficulties f
or
 
teachers. The school is still searching for a system that would better
 
accomodate the range of skills and abilities displayed by each age
 
group. The principal hopes to get ideas from other ethnic schools.  In
 
the meantime, Mr. Han-il Lee has suggested that they divide the class
 
into three levels and give separate assignments to each level, but this
 
i
s the teacher's option.

These basic classes focus on &orean language skills: reading,
 
writing, vocabulary, grammar, and conversation. Reading exercises are
 
based on handouts, textbooks, and sentences and phrases written on the
 
blackboard. The students usually take turns reading out loud, although
 
some teachers have their students read out loud together.
 
The reading lessons often include traditional Korean stories.

All the teachers use the standardized Korean textbooks donated by
 
the Korean Embassy, but most of then feel that they are inadequate for
 
Korean-American children. The students often use texts several grades
 
behind them, since they lack the vocabulary to understand the ones for
 
their own age group, and the subjects, people, and places mentioned in
 
the texts tend to be foreign to their experiences. "Our situation is
 
different--everyday life, thinking, everything is different for
 
students here from the textbooks.
 So they need something they know,"
 
says Mr. Noh. (ES82-LL-R8)
 
Most of the teachers design handouts to supplement the textbooks.
 
They also write their own tests and quizzes. In this way, while helping
 
the school develop a reservoir of unique teaching materials, they can
 
address the individual skills and interests of their class. Each
 
teacher also determines the amount and type of homework given to their
 
class.

 .
(ES82—LL—R22)
 
The principal has also found that the students are more receptive
 
to discussions of ethnicity when they come from outsiders rather than
 
members of the Korean community. Accordingly, he has invited two men--
18
 
one Finnish and the other Polish--to talk to the students about
 
maintaining their ethnic identities. In Mr. Lee's view the response was
 
positive:
 
Kids are very interested about that. Because if [
I]
 
push myself, they very [much]  hate or are against
 
[
thinking about Korean identity]. But the other person,
 
they [are]  talking about themselves: "We keep our own
 
heritage, we keep own language, then we [
are] so
 
proud." [They say],  "Why don't you keep your own
 
language and your own heritage?" Then, a little bit,
 
they [
the students] understand it. (ES82 LL 22)
 
The school day is broken into five 45—minute periods, three of
 
which are spent in the language homeroom classes. The other two are
 
used for music and dance or martial arts. Usually girls take dancing
 
and boys take martial arts, but a few girls choose the latter. Students
 
are divided into three groups for their extracurricular classes:
 
kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grades, and
 
sixth grade through high school.
 
At the end of the school year, every student receives a report
 
card. The teachers design their own methods for computing a grade, but
 
all of them use the following grade designations: excellent, good,
 
satisfactory, and unsatisfactory or needs improvement. Most of them do
 
/,lot emphasize grades, but feel that the students work harder if they

Two i
ssues frequently mentioned by the faculty are the emphasis
 
given to the amount of knowledge a child should be expected to learn
 
and the use of English in the classroom. Both are r
elated to the
 
school's desire to impart an understanding and love for Korean heritage
 
to the students. Most of the teachers feel that language is a way t
o
 
transmit those feelings and should not be an end in itself. The amount
 
and quality of language skills are not as important as the attitudes a
 
student has toward
 ethnic i
a
n
ty and heritage. Classes,
 
therefore', should be enjoyabl
teresting for the students, and
 
not too demanding.  "They are so busy, and they are just little

Korean at all t
imes, but recognizes that the students' level of
 
comprehension makes it difficult:
 
If talk completely in Korean, they cannot catch
 
[
the meaning and] feelings. So sometimes,  [
for]
 
important things, we explain in American. But,
 
basically, we have [
emphasize] learning the Korean
 
tongue, so, if possible, have to use Korean.
 
(Es82—LL--R22)
 
Most of the teachers try to speak primarily Korean in class, but
 
find that they need English to explain vocabulary words and ideas and,
 
sometimes, simply to keep the students' interest.  "When I speak only
 
imp ortant
 
Korean, they don't understand, and they g
et bored and don't learn,"
 
says Ok Kyung Kim. "But when I use English, they are interested and
 
can a
sk questions. Then they learn." (

Mr. Lee also feels that i

Sometimes they [
teachers] explain in English, because
 
they [
students] cannot catch [

hate Korean. So if youngest are this way when they
 
grow up, they cannot choose [
to appreciate their
 
heritage], and they will always hate Korean. S

Plans for the future of the school include adding more subjects to
 
the curriculum and expanding the extracurricular program. Mr. Lee is
 
presently searching for someone to direct a school and community
 
orchestra. He hopes to offer classes that wou ld p rovide
_
training and teach useful job skills,  such as automobile maintenance
 
and printing, and is also interested in starting hobby courses for
 
adults and seni o r citizens.  Several members of the school's faculty are

Teachers
 
In its first year the faculty of the Firsc Korean School consisted
 
of six teachers, three of whom are still with the school. The first
 
teachers included Mr. Han-Il Lee, Miss Kwak, Mr. Chang, and Miss Pak,
 
all of whom taught the language classes. In addition, Mrs. Kwun taught
 
music and Mr. Kim taught taekwondo (Korean martial arts). Mr. Kim
 
continues with the school, teaching the high school class, and Miss
 
Kwak teaches the fourth grade. Mr. Lee, the principal, also teaches a
s
 
a substitute.
 
The faculty now numbers thirteen teachers, although the number
 
tends to fluctuate during the school year as teachers find they cannot
 
afford the time and energy required, or move away. Appendix I provides

A large number of the faculty and administration are members of
 
the First Korean Baptist Church. While membership is not a requirement
 
for hiring, the administration is concerned that the faculty share
 
their values, many of which are based on a Christian belief system.
 
The school does not formally train its teachers or set
 
requirements regarding the experience and background for hiring, but
 
the administration does try to select teachers with previous training
 
Kko
 
and experience. Most of the teachers are o
qtr lifled for elementary
 
and middle school teaching. At least seven have formal training in
 
2
3
 
education f
rom American or Korean institutions, and sI  of the teachers
 
uave had some experience working with children. Those who lack formal
 
or previous teaching experience compensate with understanding
 
heir commitment to the school.

education. Mr. Park,  the junior high school teacher,
 s the only one
 
involved professionally in teaching the Korean language. Some say that
 
their previous teaching helps them in dealing with the children and
 
structuring their classes, but not particularly with teaching the
 
Korean language. Most find that their task is further complicated by
 
the need to teach cultural values and heritage as well as language.
 
The principal provides guidelines for the classes, but the actual
 
class development is left to the individual teacher. The faculty
 
meets occasionally to plan the curriculum, discuss teaching methods,
 
and gather teaching materials. The faculty

assembly to discuss immediate

concerns and
 
to exchange information. Teachers often I

develop the best possible teaching methods
 
and administration. No
 
rather, all work together to
 
and materials. The Special
 
Class, for example, results from the faculty's recognizing a need and
 
designing a way to fulfill it.
 
24
 
While t
eaching Korean language is the primary emphasis of the
 
classes, the more immediate concern of many of the teachers is
 
maintaining the children's interest. Some do so by presenting lessons
 
as games, or by changing activities whenever they sense boredom or
 
fatigue among their students. Others try to create a relaxed and
 
cheerful atmosphere. For example, the junior high shcool teacher
 
purchased Ping-Pong equipment for his class to use during breaks, and
 
another teacher periodically takes her class outside for a change of
 
scenery.
 
Some of the teachers are concerned about discipline in the
 
classrooms. One felt that the children, particularly the younger ones,
 
lack discipline at home and in American school and need to receive a firm
 
hand at the Korean school. Other teachers tended to be more tolerant in
 
their judgments and expectations. Most agreed that the Korean language
 
is demanding and that many of the children find it difficult. Their
 
restlessness in class, they felt, is due more to the nature of the
 
subject and the fact that it is Saturday than to a lack of discipline.

behind her class' somewhat boisterous behavior:
 
They feel at home here. They're with children who are

Everybody is speaking the language they hear at home.
 
It's not like at American school, where they feel
 
they're a little bit different. Here they can be
 
themselves. That's why they're a little noisy.
 
(Interview 4/3/82)
 
25
 
During my observations of the classes I felt that the teachers
 
were tolerant of students' behavior, but not lax. They usually allowed
 
some degree of play and freedom among the students, but the classes
 
never seemed out of control. If the class did become too noisy, the
 
teachers usually quieted it by clapping their hands and calling for
 
attention, or by speaking directly to the child. Discipline was always
 
administered with good humor and affection.
 
The teachers'  reasons for teaching at the Korean school are
 
primarily altruistic. Some of the stated reasons include a feeling of
 
responsibility toward/
he next generation, concern for the ethnic
 
identity of the youth and the possible problems resulting from a lack
 
of ethnic identity, concern for the future economic, social, and
 
emotional welfare of the Korean community in the United States, and a
 
love for Korean culture. Also mentioned were a sense of Christian duty
 
to guide youth in the right direction, a calling to teach, and a love
 
for children. Most of the faculty said that they consider their
 
teaching to be a service to the Korean community and that their job is
 
a way to provide role models for Korean values. "The teachers are
 
really volunteers," says Mr. Lee. "The salary doesn't pay for
 
anything —except gas money. So the teachers have to have a real
 
[
commitment]." (ES82-LL-R22)
 
26
 
Students
 
Forty-five students registered for classes in the school's first
 
year. By spring 1982 a total of one hundred and fifty-one students from
 
eighty-six different families were listed in the school di
 
r
 tory. All
 
of the students live in Maryland, most of them in middle-class,
 
suburban areas fairly close to the school .'The s
tudent body includes
 
both members and non-members of the First Korean Baptist Church.
 
Most of the students at the First Korean School are between the ages
 
'
. &
Q 
of five and fourteen, although there -
wa
some who were older and
 
younger. These ages correspond to American public school grades
 
kindergarten through eighth grade
,/
 
A large number of the students seemed to be full-blooded Koreans.
 
At least two were adopted and several came from mixed marriages. Most
 
of the children who were not full-blooded Korean attended the Special
 
Class, where they were learning basic vocabulary and grammar. Although
 
no official count has been made, most of the faculty agreed that all of
 
the schoolchildren had either been born in the United States or had
 
spent the majority of their lives here.
 
All the children I observed spoke English fluently, and many of
 
them consider it their first language. One teacher suggested that
 
perhaps fifty percent of the c
11dren speak Korean at home. He also
 
observed that it is more likely for a child to be fluent in Korean if
 
the grandparents live with the family. Among themselves the students
 
27
 
usually spoke English. They also called each other by their American
 
names rather than the Korean ones used by the teachers. All of them
 
wore American clothing to school. I saw Korean clothes only at special
 
events,  and anlv .

1n general, the students seemed very Americanized.  "
ihe children
 
look Korean, have Korean skin color and eyes," says Mr. Kim.  "But their
 
thinking and customs are American.  [
I] think these children [are] not
 
Korean;  they're American." (ES82-LL-Rll)
 
The majority of the students said they disliked attending Korean
 
school, claiming that they came only because their parents insisted.
 
Some complained that school was boring; others that it was too
 
difficult. Several said they were tired of classes after five days of
 
American school, and some wanted to watch Saturday morning television.
 
Others had conflicts between Korean school and community activities,
 
such as Little League baseball. Nevertheless, most of theta have fun at
 
school. Many were friends with their classmates and seemed to like
 
their teachers. They also appeared to enjoy the non-language classes.
 
Martial arts, in particular, elicited keen enthusiasm.
 
Most of the students seemed very aware of their "Korean-ness" and
 
tended to accept it matter-of-factly. One teenager said that it was
 
impossible for him not to acknowledge his heritage because his looks
 
are Asian. He feels like an American, eats American food, has American
 
friends, and speaks English fluently. But he recognizes that some
 
28
 
aspects of his life differ greatly from the lives of his friends. For
 
example, he likes Korean food and wants to marry a Korean girl so that
 
his wife can prepare it for him at home.
 
Another teenager wanted to learn Korean so that she could
 
participate in the Korean students' group at the university she planned
 
t
o attend.  She thought that she would feel more comfortable with other
 
Korean and Korean-American students, even though she spoke fluent
 
English, because they would share her cultural background and values.
 
Korean and Korean-American children tend to fit easily into the
 
American ideals of behavior and success. Many of them excel in American
 
schools and hope to continue their education at prestigious
 
institutions, such as Harvard, MIT, and Yale. Of the Korean-American
 
children I spoke to, approximately ninety percent said they make
 
straight A's on their report cards for American school. The same
 
percentage said they plan on attending college. About halt the children
 
said they want a career in one of the medical professions. Striving
 
for success is partly due to respect for their parents' wishes--many
 
see their parents sacrificing for the
9
i ldren's futures —but it
 
also reflects Korean values
 encourage hard work, acF
rement, and
 
material and academic success.
 
Parents
 
29
 
The parents of the students at the Korean school represent a wide
 
range of professions, as well as economic and educational levels. The
 
school has purposely structured its fees so as not to be a financial
 
burden. I
t also offers conveniences, such as the van service, so that
 
minimal effort is required from the parents.
 
The administration and faculty feel that one of their tasks i
s
 
to educate the parents about the need to maintain and transmit an
 
appreciation for their Korean heritage in the home. The school cannot
 
achieve its purpose without the support of the parents; Korean
 
language, in particular, cannot be taught without some reinforcement
 
in the home.
 
Parents' involvement with the Korean school seemed to be minimal,
 
often because of conflicting work schedules. According to the faculty,
 
parents often help the children with their homework, but relatively few
 
assist at the school itself. Some help out by substitute teaching,
 
bringing snacks, and forming car pools.
 
"
/
 
A parents organization associated with the First Korean Baptist
 
Church exists, but is not very active. Most of the parents are too busy
 
to participate. Many of them hold two jobs, or run their own business,
 
often working twelve or more hours a day. Some parents that I talked to
 
said they would like to be more active, but need to get financially
 
established first. The group meets about once a year to discuss t
 
role of the school and current concerns of the parents.

The r
eason most often given by parents for sending their children
 
t
o the school i
s that it would be a shame for them t
o not know their
 
own heritage. They worry that the children will lack a strong sense of
 
identity and pride in their heritage, both of which may create
 
obstacles for them in achieving a successful and fulfilled life. The
 
parents are also concerned about the maintenance of the family
 
identity: they want the family name to to be honored, and they want the
 
children to know their ancestors. Communication between generations i
s
 
particularly important, and some parents felt that their children were
 
adapting too well to American values and customs. While Koreans do not
 
officially practice ancestor worship, reverence for t
i
iie ancestors i
s an
 
integral part of the culture .
\,/
 
Most Korean parents seem to demand a lot from their children.
 
Their high expectations stem from several factors. Traditional Korean
 
values stress achievement and place responsibility on children to bring
 
honor and respect to the family name. Children are seen as the hope of
 
the future:  the child will take care of the parents in their old age
 
and will continue the family line, insuring that the family name
 
school and learning Korean, but they felt that the children would
 
appreciate the training when they were grown. Several parents who do
 
not send their children to the school said they were concerned about
 
demanding too much from them. Some felt that their children needed to
 
concentrate on learning English, studying for American school, and
 
32
 
participating in other activities, such as music lessons. Others said
 
that forcing their children t
o attend would produce aegative reactions
 
to their Korean heritage.
 
Conclusions
 
The First Korean school directly reflects the concerns of the
 
adult generation of Korean immigrants and Korean-Americans in the
 
Washington area. These concerns are not limited to transmission of
 
cultural heritage, but include the immediate and future welfare
 
Korean-American children. Nor are the individuals involved in
 
school limited to a select group within the Korean community. The
 
school's administrators and faculty hold a range of educational and
 
occupational credentials, and the larger community displays its support
 
through the continued enrollment of its children.
 
Since its creation in 1977 the First Korean School has grown to
 
approximately four times the size of its original student body and
 
faculty. At least four factors are responsible for this growth.
 
First is the commitment and determination of the individuals who
 
organized and developed the school. Their continuing efforts to create
 
an effective educational program have
 
from the Korean community.
 
attracted support
 
33
 
Another factor is the continued support of the First Korean
 
Baptist Church. The building added by the church in 1980 has enabled
 
the school to expand its classes and accommodate more students, while
 
the free rent and utilities provided by the church have allowed the
 
tuition fees t
o be used for other expenses.
 
A third factor in the school's success is the nature of the
 
Washington area Korean-American community and its high degree of ethnic
 
awareness. The community is proud of its heritage and has developed
 
strong networks between its members through a variety of occupational,
 
social, and religious organizations. It has also been settled in
 
Washington long enough for its members to acquire a measure of economic
 
stability, enabling the community to support —both financially and
 
socially —the maintenance of ethnic language. Many have also been here
 
long enough t
d realize that such language maintenance i
s not a luxury
 
f
lP('
 
A final factor is the school's concern with meeting the immediate
 
and long-term needs of its students by shaping them into good
 
Korean-American citizens. It attempts to achieve this goal by
 
instilling good values and healthy attitudes, by encouraging the
 
children to set high goals for themselves, and by providing an
 
environment in which they can confront and explore their ethnicity. The
 
administration feels that possessing knowledge of their heritage is
 
essential for the children to develop strong, positive-self-images,
 
/
which 
 are vital to their becoming '

emphasized7 s a means both of transmitting a cultural heritage and
 
maintaining strong family ties, which form the basis of social
 
responsibility.
 
Being Korean in America, however, requires more than simply
 
speaking and understanding the Korean language. Most Koreans consider a
 
degree of acculturation to be inevitable if their children are to
 
succeed in this society. They try, then, to expose them to the best of

-
In conclusion,  the school tries to instill a sense of ethnic
 
identity in its students, while simultaneously assisting them to adapt
 
to American life. Rather than seeing these as conflicting goals, the
 
school considers them necessary and complementary processes in the
 
children's development into honorable individuals. Furthermore, the
 
school recognizes that
 will never be wholly Korean nor
 
wholly American, but will have to forge an identity for themselves as
 
Korean-Americans. The school hopes its efforts will provide resources
 
for that task.
