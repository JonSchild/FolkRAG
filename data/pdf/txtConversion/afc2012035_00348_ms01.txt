We arrived at Gail Bruno’s house at 11am. She has a small salon in the basement 
of her home in a quaint, older suburban neighborhood on a quiet street with 
mature trees. Her husband greeted us outside as we were pulling into the 
driveway and Gail met us with a big smile at the door. They took us downstairs 
and we sat the kitchen table. Gail was welcoming and very sweet. After we sat 
down she showed us her old appointment book and we looked at photo albums 
of when she was a member of the Hairdressers Association. After about fifteen 
minutes of looking at pictures we started the interview. 
 
After about an hour, we were wrapping up the interview and Gail’s client, Aileen 
arrived. She sat and we chatted with Aileen for about ten minutes. We walked 
down the hallway to Gail’s salon. It looked like something right out of the 1960’s 
with wood paneled walls, canary yellow chairs and exposed brick.  
 
I photographed Gail giving Aileen a wash and roller set which is the most 
common hairstyling treatment she does since most of her clients are aged sixty 
and older. After she was done, they gave us a big hug and Gail offered us food 
and drinks for the road. We left around 2pm.
