LG: 
Okay, this is Lisa Gabbert. And today, I am interviewing Dr. Adriana Rojas, at her home 
in Salt Lake City. The date is November 6th, 2019, and this is part of the Physician Oral 
History project, for the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. 
 
 
So, thank you so much for agreeing to be interviewed today. 
 
AR: 
Thank you.

LG: 
And you know you’re being recorded and I have permission to record? 
 
AR: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And for the record, can you give me your birth year?  
 
AR: 
1971. 
 
LG: 
1971. Thank you. 
 
 
Okay, to start off the interview, I would like you just to talk a little bit about your medical 
training: where you went to medical school, and the years, and any residency and 
fellowship that followed. 
 
AR: 
Okay. I was born in Bucaramanga, Colombia. And I did my medical school there. I 
wanted to be a plastic surgeon, but I met my husband (who wanted to be a researcher). 
And he came to the United States and convinced me to get married.  
 
 
So, I [laughing] came here, and I did two years of post-doc fellowship in dermatology: 
basic science the first year and clinical the second year. And then I applied for internal 
medicine and dermatology, and I got into internal medicine. And I, after that, have loved 
it. And I have been an internist since.  
 
 
I have not done a fellowship, but I have areas of interest, which I have more expertise on. 
And I enjoy working with patients with musculoskeletal conditions, people with diabetes, 
and also I love dermatology, so I still act today on dermatology issues.  
 
LG: 
What was the name of the medical school that you went to in Colombia? And what years 
did you attend? 
 
AR: 
Universidad Industrial de Santander. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; and which years? 
 
AR: 
Hmm. That was 1988 to 2005. 
 
LG: 
Okay. How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
AR: 
Sorry – 1990 – no, 1998, yeah [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
1988? 
 
AR: 
1988 to 1995, actually. 
 
LG: 
Okay. So, six years of medical school then? 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 3 
 
 
AR: 
Six years –  
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
AR: 
Of medical school. 
 
LG: 
How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
[02:39] 
 
AR: 
I always wanted to be a physician. My mom is a physical therapist, and she always had 
little complaints about certain patients, in which she wanted to do a different 
management. And she was upset because she was not the one making the decisions. So, 
since I was a child she told me, “You need to train to make the decisions.” 
 
LG: 
Hmm. Interesting [laughs]. She wanted you to be powerful. 
 
 
Can you talk a little bit about medical school and what that was like? 
 
AR: 
It was busy; it was very busy. I was the youngest of my class, and it was people from 
very different backgrounds. This is a public university, and I came from a kind of 
protected environment, so it was a big change. And it was intense, busy, but it was fun: it 
was what I wanted to do. 
 
 
It was hard to go late to sleep and wake up early. And I fell asleep multiple times in class. 
I was lucky to have a very good classmate that will take pretty good notes and will study 
together every night.  
 
 
And it was fun, because you have a group of people that you get very close with, in true, 
difficult situations. I think med school was different in Colombia in the sense that some 
professors felt that they were on a pedestal, and you know, you as a student, didn’t have 
much [laughs] to offer. And you have then, other people that were nice and can 
encourage you to grow.  
 
 
So, when I came to the States and did my residency, I found that the environment was 
much nicer here, because professors were more open to students, and they – of course, 
they have an ego, but it was lower [laughing] than the egos that I found at my medical 
school. 
 
[04:47] 
 
LG: 
What was the best thing about medical school for you? 
 
AR: 
I think one of the best experiences that we have there is, is med school is different in 
Colombia, we have more the European model: you finish high school and you go straight 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 4 
 
to university. So you have five years that you are in med school and then you have one 
year of internship. And I think the internship is wonderful, because you are given a lot of 
responsibility, but you’re still a student. And it’s a great thing. I think it’s different here, 
because when you are an intern, you’re already a doctor. And you do have responsibility, 
and your attendings will be in charge; but somehow, I feel my model is nicer [laughs]. I 
don’t know, I feel that there’s a lot of responsibility, but you are a student; and it just 
feels – it’s nice. 
 
 
And then another thing you have in Colombia is that you have to do a social service 
before you get your medical license. So you can be a doctor, but the state will not give 
your medical doctor license until you do the social service. So, you have to go to a little 
town and be the doctor for the town. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about your experience doing that? 
 
AR: 
Yeah. At the time, you know, I just had taken the decision to get married. And I wanted 
to do the shortest social service possible, and that was in the high-violence areas in 
Colombia (at the time there was a difficult situation).  
 
 
So I went to a town that used to be controlled by the guerilla. Like a year before I went 
there, they built a military base in that town. So we were safe in the town, because the 
military were there.  
 
 
But you have to go and do health brigades at the rural towns that belonged to your 
hospital. You have to travel two hours; and then sometimes you have to get into rivers 
and get to the little towns.  
 
 
And sometimes you have to go to areas that now, there were not guerillas any more, but 
there were another sector in Colombia, called the paramilitary –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[07:30] 
 
AR: 
So, you know – you would enter these towns and there were these guys dressed in black 
all over the place, and controlling where you’re going, and what are you doing.  
 
 
And it is beautiful because you are close, and taking care of people; but at the same time, 
you see what a difficult situation the people in the rural areas are. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
Between the powers of the paramilitary that are now in town, and the guerillas used to be 
there (before). And then you go back to the little town, where your hospital is, and that 
it’s protected by the military. 
 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 5 
 
 
So, it was very interesting: all that dynamics. And as a rural doctor, you deliver babies, 
you do little things (little surgical procedures): you suture people. And you also are the 
first line of people that do simple autopsies. 
 
 
Every two weekends, you have to stay two and a half days by yourself, and you are the 
doctor there, and you have an assistant that shift every eight hours – but you are all the 
time there.  
 
 
I was very lucky because every time I have to do something and I changed my shift, the 
person who will cover me will get a body to do the autopsy –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
So, all those six months –  
 
LG: 
You didn’t have to? 
 
AR: 
Seven months and a half I did, actually. I didn’t have to do just – I only did one autopsy, 
and that was an old guy that has died in a nursing home [laughing]. So, it was very simple 
to do.  
 
 
But over times, you know, there were many – when there were victims of violence, if 
there was a single entry and a single exit point, that was an easy thing. But if there was 
something else involved you have to write the first part of the autopsy, you have to call 
the authorities, people will have to come. And it will take forever (the paper work), and it 
will take forever to get a medical examiner from the state to actually come. And it was 
very –  
 
LG: 
Did you ever feel like you were in danger?  
 
[10:00] 
 
AR: 
I only felt unsafe once. And there was one day that we went to one of these towns that 
were controlled by the paramilitary; and I was doing clinic. And then my first patient was 
in the room when I entered. And then there was one of the paramilitary, and he has his 
legs on my desk, and his gun on my desk. And that’s how the interview started; so, I felt 
very stressed out that day.  
 
LG: 
That is understandable [laughs]. 
 
AR: 
That was the only day. 
 
 
And then you know, you have all the people (young people) that are doing social 
services; so, my hospital was not that little – I have two other doctors doing social 
services, and one of them was a classmate from my med school, and the other one came 
from another city.  
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 6 
 
 
 
And you have the laboratory people that are doing the social service, too: the dentist is 
doing the social service; some of the lawyers that are in the town are doing social service.  
 
 
So, that’s your social environment. And you will go dancing to the only place to dance in 
the town, maybe the weekends when you weren’t out on call. And you know, you will go 
the river and have an afternoon there with your friends when you were not working.  
 
 
We have a very good community. 
 
LG: 
Hmm, interesting; interesting.  
 
 
So, what was it like going from medical school in Colombia, then to the residency – was 
it here, at the University of Utah? 
 
AR: 
No. I did my residency program at the University of Connecticut.  
 
LG: 
Okay. Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
AR: 
Yeah. So, when we moved from Colombia, we moved to Boston. And there I spent six 
months at the Countway Library of Harvard University, by the Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital – I started to do my certifications to validate my MD title.  
 
 
And then, you know, I did have the letters of recommendations from my teachers back in 
Colombia, but I needed to translate that; and I needed to actually start from scratch to get 
somebody to write me a letter of recommendation. 
 
 
I was lucky enough to get people to get me in through rotations at the Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital as a medical student. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
And that was very interesting and very hard, because there are many medical 
abbreviations; and when we are rounding in the hospital, and things like that, my English 
was not good enough to catch all these abbreviations. So, I have a hard time to kind of 
understand “What are we talking about?” And I will know about the pathologies and 
everything but I could not figure out what we were talking about until we were done 
talking about it [laughing]. And then I was like, “Oh, we were talking,” –  
 
 
It’s an adjustment until you catch all the abbreviations and stuff like that.  
 
 
And after that, you know, doing the post-doctoral fellowships allowed me to practice 
more my medical English. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 7 
 
[13:31] 
 
AR: 
And then the residency program at UConn was great. 
 
LG: 
And (remind me) that was a residency in? 
 
AR: 
Internal medicine. 
 
LG: 
Internal; okay.  
 
AR: 
I have to get my own place in Hartford, my husband was in Boston. And it was you 
know, it was okay; I just felt that doing my internship in Colombia, and my social service 
I was sleep-deprived even more than I was sleep-deprived here; and I feel I have more 
support (in many areas). So, it was good, and it was great because you have such an 
international community in the medical community. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
I got to know people from all over the world in my residency program. 
 
LG: 
Nice, nice. And can you talk a little bit about your job now? Where you work and what 
are some of your duties? 
 
AR: 
I work at the Salt Lake City VA Medical Center; I’m a primary care provider – it’s called 
the Blue Clinic – there we have mostly male patients and we have also a women’s clinic, 
and I work there too. I’m an adjunct faculty for the University of Utah; so, I work with 
medical students, with podiatry students, with podiatry residents, with internal medicine 
residents.  
 
 
And I also became part of group of providers at the VA that created a program to teach 
all the providers about diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions in 
female veterans. So, that’s what I do.  
 
 
I have a clinic for female veterans with musculoskeletal conditions. 
 
[15:30] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about what it’s like a little bit to work with veterans? 
 
AR: 
It’s very interesting. For me, my first contact with veterans was when I moved to Salt 
Lake. During my training, I did not rotate through any VA hospital. And you have many, 
many great interactions; you get to know people with very interesting histories about, you 
know, their experience during the war, what they have seen.  
 
 
I have one of my patients is one of the Hornets [editorial note: interviewee later corrected 
it to the Wasps] from the Second World War. She is a pilot, you know, (she’s not flying 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 8 
 
anymore) but she taught male pilots how to fly, and she will take the big planes to 
Europe. Because you know, just taking the planes and being a teacher for the male pilots 
(because female pilots could not fight). 
 
LG: 
Interesting. 
 
AR: 
So, that’s very interesting. We have a huge picture of that group, “the Hornets,” [editorial 
note: interviewee later corrected it to the Wasps] and there are a couple of them that are 
alive. But it makes me feel proud, just to be their primary care doctor and hear about how 
things were at that time. And you know, they are groundbreaking for females –  
 
LG: 
Yeah, for sure; for sure.  
 
 
As a female, and particularly as an international student – do you feel that there were any 
barriers that you had to overcome in becoming a physician? 
 
AR: 
Language is one. I think you know, in health, people are more attune to internationals. 
And I think physicians are more attuned to having people from different backgrounds 
work together. I will say that I never feel discriminated or anything while I was doing my 
internal medicine residency.  
 
 
My bosses, when I was doing my fellowships, were also non-U.S. born. So, they were –  
they were open to people from an international background.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. How about medical school, as a female medical school student? 
 
AR: 
Oh, my class – we were more girls than boys. So, even in my class – I think we were 100; 
and of the 100, 60 were females and 40 were males.  
 
LG: 
Hmm; so, heavily weighted to –  
 
[18:25] 
 
AR: 
Heavily weighted to females. 
 
LG: 
Nice. Can you describe some of the most challenging things about your job? What are 
some of the hardest? 
 
AR: 
The hardest time is when you recognize a lot of changes that people can do in their 
lifestyle, or a lot of stuff that they can do, and they choose not to do it. And you see the 
complications, and you see how things keep getting worse, and worse, and worse. And 
you’re there just being a witness of something that you told them is going to happen if 
you don’t take of yourself.  
 
 
So, in the past I think that the position of being a physician was like taken with respect, 
and people will listen what somebody tells you that will be good for you. And right now, 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 9 
 
either people don’t have that respect, or I feel that we are so busy with all what is going 
on, you know?  
 
 
Many times people are stressed about they don’t have anything to eat, and they cannot 
make choices; they don’t have resources to either educational or to make good decisions 
about their lifestyle; or they grew up in a difficult family dynamics, and they made them 
not take the best decisions on their lifestyle, and that end up going to have bad 
consequences later in life. Or that upbringing was traumatic and left you with bad 
mechanism of defense and you get into trouble, and trouble, and trouble, and make bad 
decisions.  
 
 
So, that’s hard to watch. And not always we, as health providers, can see that. We 
understand that people why cannot make decisions. But you know, resources are 
available, but people don’t want to take it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[20:38] 
 
AR: 
So, at the VA we have many people that came from very difficult, you know, households. 
And going through the military was an exit to that situation; was the key for them to get 
them to go and study, or to go away from a traumatic environment.  
 
 
And then unfortunately, they get into more trouble in the military, or they are the victims 
of military sexual trauma; and then their life gets worse and worse. They are the ones that 
get into substance abuse, and getting worse and worse and worse.  
 
 
We have the people that went to the Vietnam Wars, and the Korean Wars, where we were 
not aware of post-traumatic stress disorder, and we didn’t know how to treat that, and we 
didn’t know that that even was a condition. VA took a while to understand that. And now 
we understand that, but it’s hard to get these people to come and help themselves.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
And that’s a barrier for many of them. That’s the reason why they don’t do stuff. 
 
LG: 
How do you, then, navigate that, as a physician? As a physician, you’re – everybody is 
responsible for their own health, but also a physician’s job is to, you know, be 
responsible for the patient’s health (also) to some degree – so, how do you navigate that? 
 
AR: 
You need to create your barriers, and there is only so much you can do. And that’s hard 
to understand; and that took me awhile.  
 
 
I used to work at the – be the medical director of the women’s clinic, and that was a hard 
thing for me emotionally. There is a lot of females with military sexual trauma at the VA. 
And they get scarred for life.  
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 10 
 
 
 
And their personalities are hard to handle; there is a lot of borderline personalities, in 
which you offer to help, you know, and you know if things to do not work out for them, 
they cannot recognize that it’s something in their environment that needs to change, and 
they get blaming the provider. So –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
You know, nothing that you can do will help, so you give them all the resources, “We can 
do this, we can do that, we can try this.” They will go and try some things, and then 
nothing works because it’s not a physical problem that is going on: it’s something that is 
in your mind. And then if we don’t heal that, that’s not going to improve and it’s very 
hard for them to make the mind-body connection, that this is something that we need to 
start working from here. And then I understand, and that this is nothing that they 
intentionally do –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[23:55] 
 
AR: 
And they don’t see that we understand. They feel like, “Oh, it’s that you don’t believe 
me.”  
 
 
“And I believe that you have pain, I believe that you have a problem; but I cannot find it 
on an x-ray, and I cannot find it in anything. We need to work from your mind-body 
connection, because whatever trauma you have in the past is making you feel that. So, it 
makes me think that whatever happened in that past, you haven’t gone through that.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That sounds very difficult. 
 
AR: 
So, it’s very difficult. And we have lovely patients that I enjoy, and we have a good time, 
and it’s nice to hear their stories, and it’s very encouraging. But those patients kind of 
take a toll of you. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
And then you look at the schedule and see, “Oh, these two persons are coming today,” 
and your heart goes out. And then I need to relax and then, I want this to be a good 
encounter for my patient, because I care for her. Because if we didn’t care, we didn’t 
have even the heart rates –  
 
LG: 
Yeah, sure. 
 
AR: 
Right? Because you see, okay, whatever you want – but you know, we care about them, I 
care about them. So, I want them to have a good experience, I want them to get better. 
So, it’s hard.  
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 11 
 
 
LG: 
Do you feel that you (or physicians that you know) ever suffer because of the work? 
Because you see so much suffering and pain in your patients that sometimes is not 
controllable, or beyond your control? 
 
AR: 
I do, physicians do. We have a high rate of depression, and I think we have a high rate 
[laughing] of suicide too, unfortunately. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
AR: 
And you know, people are not used to talk about being burned out. And I think in the last 
couple of years that’s something that has been gaining momentum, about the health of the 
provider.  
 
 
I see many coworkers that are tired. I see many coworkers that are depressed. And I think 
it’s good for providers to talk; and when I’m down, I’m lucky enough that I have some 
peers I will go and cry, because this happened with somebody. And then you hear their 
stories, you hear their experience, and you are like, “Oh.” It’s like a [laughing] 
psychotherapy moment. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[26:35] 
 
AR: 
So, sharing is caring, and that’s helpful. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Do you think that the culture among physicians encourages them to do that? 
Or is that just you and your colleagues? 
 
AR: 
I think it’s probably more a girl thing. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
I think males are probably more at-risk; I don’t see the male providers sharing so much as 
female, we do. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
And it depends on your personality and how comfortable you feel with your peers.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you describe an either funny or crazy experience at the VA? 
 
AR: 
Well one funny – it might nnot be for the microphone, because of my accent –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 12 
 
AR: 
You know, I was talking about a patient, about what he can do for his diabetes. And we 
were talking about what his goals were. And I say, “I want you to focus on,” [laughing] 
“your calories, and your food choices,” [laughing] –  
 
 
And then when I say it, I didn’t see what I was saying, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
So, next visit that he came, he was – he said to me, “Okay, Dr. Rojas; I’m doing good, 
because I’m,” –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
“Fuck,” (whatever) “on this and that.” And he kept repeating; and you know, “My food 
choices, and I’ve f’d my food choices, f’d my everything.”  
 
 
And then I was like, “I’m so sorry.” 
 
 
But you need to understand my accent, and he was just joking with me. 
 
LG: 
Oh, he was? 
 
AR: 
He was just joking; he was having fun. So, from now on, every time he comes he tells 
me, “And I’ll [whispers]” –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
That is so funny. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
At least he didn’t take it literally, you know? 
 
AR: 
No, no, no [laughing] – he understood my accent. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
That’s hilarious. That’s hilarious. 
 
AR: 
Yeah. 
 
[28:59] 
 
LG: 
Let me see. How has being a physician changed you as a person? 
 
AR: 
It’s funny, because every time that you meet somebody, you are thinking about how this 
person can get healthier, you know? Like, “Oh, this person should exercise more.” Or, 
“This person should get sunscreen and wear a hat.” And things like that, that comes from 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 13 
 
my mind. And my husband tells me, “You have to counsel everybody that you see around 
you.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
So, that’s on all the time and it’s very hard to turn it off.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm; I could imagine that. How about when people learn that you’re a 
physician – how do they see you? Do they treat you any differently? 
 
AR: 
Well I have to say, like in interactions from people here, it’s like you are taken more into 
consideration after they know your educational background. 
 
LG: 
Can you give me an example? 
 
AR: 
I will say there was a particular mom at a school, where she kind of ignored me a lot, and 
didn’t pay too much attention to my opinion until she learn who I was.  
 
LG: 
And is that common? 
 
AR: 
I would say it will happen maybe once a year when I meet somebody. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
So, it’s so-so. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Do the doctors at your work make fun of each other?  
 
AR: 
We do, yes.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
AR: 
Yeah, we do. So, with [laughs] epidemics of pain killers and pain-seeking behavior, you 
know, we can joke about it when somebody gets hurt, or something and we say, “Oh, 
he’s limping because he will like you to prescribe some Percocet, or something.” 
[Laughing] So, we joke a lot about that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
And like a training that we were doing, and in this training you have to be role playing. 
So, I role played as somebody who got an injury, and the learner will be somebody who 
is examining you. So, you know, the first thing that whenever you want to be treated for 
pain is what we see many people asking. So, you will say, “Hi, I have this pain here, and 
ibuprofen doesn’t work, and Tylenol doesn’t work – can I get a Percocet.” 
 
[Laughter]

LG: 
Of course. [Laughs] Of course. 
 
AR: 
Yeah, and so –  
 
LG: 
That’s cute. Are there any jokes about internists that you know of? 
 
AR: 
Oh, that we probably will not give you a simple answer to a problem; that we have to 
explore everything: all the possibilities, and things like that. I’m not very good at jokes. I 
will forget them; sorry about it. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
No, that’s okay; that’s okay. That’s one that comes up a lot though, is that they make 
things complicated –  
 
AR: 
Yes. You know, we want to weigh all the differential diagnosis and all the possibilities 
[laughs].  
 
LG: 
Why do you think that doctors are sort of stereotyped for having a good sense of humor, 
and laughing a lot – do you think that’s true? 
 
[32:52] 
 
AR: 
I think it’s part of dealing with the stress. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
AR: 
Yeah, you have to see the bright side. And sometimes it’s not a nice humor [laughs], 
because you are, you know, putting into consideration suffering of somebody else, or an 
illness, or something. So, I don’t know – I cannot give you a joke in particular. 
 
LG: 
But you think it has to do with the stress? 
 
AR: 
I think it’s a way to release the stress.  
 
LG: 
Like stress relief? Um-hmm. 
 
 
Can you talk a little bit more about what it means to be responsible for a patient? I don’t 
think that the general public really understands that, when they think about doctoring.  
 
AR: 
So, when there is a particular complaint, you want to be sure that everything goes right, 
because it’s the life of somebody, it’s the advice that you’re giving somebody about the 
condition.  
 
And then you know, you were not sure about this, but then you’re thinking all the 
possibilities, and are they going to be safe? And how the result is going to be; and let’s 
try that and, “See you Monday.”  
 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 15 
 
 
And you will be, during the weekend, thinking, “Okay, was this right? Did I give you a 
little dosage? Should I give him more?” And you end up calling the patient, “So, how are 
you doing?” [Laughing] 
 
 
And then so, and then you see them Monday and say, “Things went fine.” I don’t know. 
 
 
Maybe I’m one of those that thinks too much about stuff, but it’s – you know, you have 
the life of somebody in your hands – and I’m doing primary care, I’m not in the inpatient 
setting anymore. I think the stakes are higher in inpatient, when you are dealing with 
inpatient.  
 
 
But nevertheless, you know, it’s something that can have a lot of consequences for some 
people. If it’s just a cold, there’s no big problem. But you know, there are, when people 
have advanced diseases and things like that, you worry about them. 
 
[35:06] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. That seems like it would be kind of a great responsibility? 
 
AR: 
Yeah. And then it gets back to thinking, “Okay, you need to advise – if this doesn’t go 
this way, you’ve got turn this around. Okay, we are planning this, but if you don’t feel 
this way, this way, this way, you need to do a, b, c.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
And there at the last you give all the instructions, and you are scared because you know, 
like some of my patients, you give them all the instructions, and you write it down and 
everything, and they are stubborn, and they will not want to do it. [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
And luckily, they came back, and you can fix that. But it’s stressful. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, it sounds stressful; it sounds stressful. 
 
 
What is the best thing about working at the VA for you? 
 
AR: 
You know, like I’m thinking about these lovely patients, and how you shared that 
experiences, and you know, they share to you their experiences and that’s very 
interesting. And then how they are so resilient, especially the older generation, and how 
they are so resilient about all the suffering that they had in the past. And they have a good 
look in life; that’s beautiful, that’s humbling, that’s really nice. 
 
LG: 
Yes, nice.  
 
 
Do you – you said you did training in dermatology as well? 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 16 
 
 
AR: 
I did a research fellowship and clinical research fellowship. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
AR: 
So, I work with a dermatologist in Boston who was studying autoimmune conditions in 
the skin for which there are not many treatments, and he was studying the use of IVIG in 
the treatment of Pemphigoid [laughs]. So, I did a lot of Western blot tests, and I got to 
write articles about adhesion molecules, and [laughs] inflamatory responses in the skin.  
 
 
And then my clinical training was with one dermatologist (Tanya Phillips), who 
specialized in wound healing. And she’s at Boston University, and that was a lot of fun. 
You know, she does wound healing, but at the same thing, there’s a lot of little research 
projects like you work with companies about which sunscreen is better.  
 
 
So, you get study subjects, and they put different sunscreens, and they come and you go 
biopsy, or they put it on their faces. And then you check how much sun spots they have, 
and you know, later on they take pictures to see the degree of photo damage from when 
they start using that SPF, whatever, to a higher SPF, or this brand, compared to the other 
brand.  
 
 
And some of them, you know, they will check microscopic changes in the skin, and you 
will put UV light in their backs and months later you biopsy into see what was the skin 
changes, according to the UV exposure. So, that was fun.  
 
[38:55] 
 
LG: 
There are jokes about dermatology. 
 
AR: 
Oh, there are plenty.  
 
LG: 
Do you know any? 
 
AR: 
No, you know, you might say one and I would hear and say, “Oh, I remember!” 
 
LG: 
Do you still do dermatology at all? 
 
AR: 
You know, I have a lot of stuff that I do in internal medicine, you know: sunspots, and 
things like that, that you will treat (and other recommendations). I think I’m one of the 
providers of the VA that that’s more preventive medicine and tell a lot of people about 
what to do, and the sunscreen, and the hat, and things that everybody will do a little 
sunspot – you burn them, freeze them, as skin grows you can shave them. Little stuff you 
can do: biopsies, and –  
 
LG: 
Alright. What else would you like people to know about being a doctor, particularly at 
the VA? What it’s like? 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 17 
 
 
AR: 
What it’s like? Oh. That you have a wide range of patients [laughs] – a wide range of 
patients, in terms of people who had a lot of trauma, and they will become very difficult 
patients for you: that they will have issues in which they won’t follow your instructions, 
and things like that. And that’s a stressful –  
 
 
You have the great patients, from which you learn a lot; because you know, many of 
these vets have traveled a lot, and they tell you a lot of stories, and they tell you how 
things were years ago, and they tell you about what’s the life in a ship, and you know, 
how they did things there (in the military). And so, you can learn a lot about that. 
 
 
And then you also have the people that they have an attitude, that because they served 
they, you know, need to have this special attention. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
But every patient is important and we do the best for every patient. And so, there can be 
some demanding parts. 
 
 
And then you have the other, very humble people that they say, “Oh, I’m not sick, I’m 
not that sick.”  
 
 
“Oh, I can get the services, but let other veterans – let them get it.” And then you, “No, 
sir – you should get you some stuff that you earned, because you served.” 
 
 
So, it’s a wide variety. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. How about working – can you talk just a little bit about what the 
VA system? And how it’s different? No? 
 
[41:55] 
 
AR: 
I think the VA system is a great system. I think there are differences between particular 
VAs. I feel my VA is pretty good 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
I have all the resources that I need, you know? I can call specialists and get stuff done. I 
see that people will complain because they have to wait a month (or a month and a half) 
to get a sleep study. And can say, for my son I had to wait ten months to get a sleep study 
in the private sector, and I have a good insurance.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Interview: Adriana Rojas 
Page 18 
 
AR: 
So, the resources are great. We have, you know, many of the providers, nurses, were 
veterans themselves, and they understand patients, and they sort of understand what they 
are going through. 
 
 
There is something that bugs me is that sometimes Washington makes some decisions 
about program that we care – “And now we care about this, and now you need to do 
this.” And sometimes they were very good programs, but it’s not the priority. So, you 
stop doing something, to start doing the other thing because somebody new in 
Washington decided that this is the thing to do. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
AR: 
So, that’s kind of – it’s hard because there is a lot of – I don’t know, sometimes there is 
not enough continuity on who is out there and making decisions.  
 
LG: 
Okay. Anything else that you want to share, or that you feel is important? 
 
AR: 
I think I’ll say being a physician is a calling. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AR: 
And there are different kinds of physicians. The ones that do primary care, and stuff like 
that – they want to have the ears to listen to you, that’s something that people (I think) 
grow with it [laughing], and it’s hard to get. And it gets me emotional [laughing].  
 
[44:00] 
 
 
But this is a great profession, and I love it. And I would not change it. 
 
LG: 
What advice would have for someone who is thinking about going to medical school? 
 
AR: 
You know, they need to choose according to their personality what they want. Social 
interaction is very, very, very important. And then if you are the patient kind, the 
listening kind – you will go through to primary care, pediatrics – interaction with people.  
 
 
 
If you are the type of person that you love medicine, you love new advances, and what’s 
new – maybe you like research, you will go to pathology or stuff like that.  
 
 
If you want imaging and signs, but you don’t want to deal with people – you probably 
will go to genetics, and you will go to radiology, pathology, or things like that.  
 
 
So, there is a variety. And the other thing – if you want to deal with people, you really 
need to set your boundaries. Because if you don’t set boundaries in this profession, it gets 
to you. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah; sure.

Okay. Is there anything else you’d like to add? No? Okay. 
 
 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert; I’m talking to Adriana Rojas, in her home (in Salt Lake 
City). It’s November 6th, 2019. And this is part of the Physician Oral History project for 
the American Folklife Center.  
 
 
Thank you. 
 
AR: 
No problem.
