BIKRAPRIVAL SKETCHES. 
Among the very few first-class Comediens that have made 
the Negro character a 
close study, will be found the name 
of M R, joriN W ILD. 
This Son of Momus not only com-
bines all the talent of a 
first-class artist, but that of a 
con-
scientious and high-toned gentleman. 
We learn that Mr. 
Wild will, by the kind permission of Mr. Josh Hart, Pro-
prietor of the celebrated Theatre Comique, 514 Broadway, 
New York, put upon the. road for a 
short season this Sum-
mer, a 
Company of unequalled artists, selected from the 
principal members of the Theatre Comique, whose refined 
performances have been the delight of the New York pub-
lic for the last 11 years ; and we can guarantee that the en-
tertainment givi by Mr. Wild's company, will be in every-
respect, and such as ladies and gentlemen can safely visit, 
without fear. 
There is a 
very curious incident related, in connection 
with this gentleman. A well known merchant in New 
York was upon the 
verge of 
bankruptcy—he 
bore 
his troubles on his face—his creditors became alarmed. 
A friend fearing he would be driven to suicide by his, 
misfortune, prevailed upon him to visit the Theatre 
Comique. 
He did so. 
And among the many good things 
presented, there, was a 
sketch in which Mr. Wild appeared. 
The merchant was seized with such an uncontrolable fit of 
laughter a, the many comical antics of Wild, that he for-
got his troubles, and all of the next day his face wore 
such a 
look of jollity that his creditors, who had seen him 
for weeks and weeks looking so wan and care-worn, imag-
ined from his change of demeanor that his affairs had re, 
ceived a 
prosperous turn, and instead of pressing their 
claims determined to await the result—by which means 
he was enabled to meet all his obligations, and he now 
stands at the head of the mercantile community, a 
prosper-
ous and honorable merchant. 
If one visit to a 
refined per-
formance has done so much for him, what may it not do for 
A 
Among the bright list of Stars, presented by Mr. Wild, 
will be found 
THE GREAT COOL BURGESS. 
Mr. Burgess stands, as it were, at the head of all of the 
Laugh Makers of the world—recognizod, as he is, from 
Canada to the State of Texas, as the greatest Mimic and 
most laughable Grotesque Comedian of the age—he stands 
to-day without a rival. 
His style is purely his own, 
and though many have striven to imitate him none have 
succeeded, and the comparison has always been as to that 
of the real diamond when brought along side of the paste. 
In presenting COOL BULGESS, Mr. W ILD does so with the 
assurance that he is giving his patrons a 
real and conscien-
tious artist and one who invokes laughter by pure wit, and 
not by low vulgarisms—always remembering the words of 
the Poet— 
litle nonsense, now a•nd then, 
Is relished by the besteof men." 
Wherever Mr. Burgess has appeared, the very anounce-
ment of the man who laughs, has been sufficient to put the 
community in a 
good humor. 
Associated with Mr. 'Burgess will be found— 
MR. WILLIAM CARTER, 
the Master Banjoist of the World. 
Mr. Carter, like the 
Great Cool Burgess, stands alone in his line of business. 
His solos and comicalities are all new and original, and the 
best evidence of his worth is, that he has remained with 
Mr. Josh Hart, Proprietor of the Theatre Comique, 511 
Broadway, New York, for several seasons, and has always 
been received, by the refined and intelligent audience who 
make that well known Theatre a 
family resort, with every 
demonstration of approval and delight 
There also will be found in Mr. Wild's Company, the 
Champion Jig and Song and Dance Artist— 
MR. JAMES MCA 
I', 
LE 
Y. 
Mr. Bradley has been a 
memiss: sf. Mr Josh Hart's 
0, 1 
; 
151 
Company for six years, which fact should be sufficient 
guarantee of his worth. 
Mr. Bradley has devoted his 
liesure time to teaching, and to him the Stage is indebted 
for some of its present artists in that line. 
In Mr. Wild's Company will also be found the celebrated 
Irish Comedians, Singers and Dancers— 
DIAMOND AND RYAN, 
who will appear at each performance in their Laughable 
Sketches of Irish character, depicting life as it really ex-
ists in the land of the Shamrock. 
These gentlemen's de-
lineations have been the admiration of the New York pub-
lic since their arrival in America. 
lunong the Ladies of the company will be found that 
Sweet Child of Song— 
MISS ALICE BENNETT. 
Miss Bennett posseses a 
voice of extreme sweetness, and 
although young in years, only entering the profession some 
three years ago, at the Theatre Comique, 514 Broadway, 
New York—where she has remained ever since, holding 
her own against all of the first class artists in that line of 
hnsiness—and she stands to-day, as a 
P.allad Singer, at the 
head of the profession. 
Mr. Wild has also engaged, for his Traveling Season, the 
beautiful and talented 
RICHMOND SISTERS, 
surnamed by both Press and Public, as tlse Queens of 
Song and Dance. 
These fascinating young artists, not 
only stand pre-eminent in their double songs and dances, 
but having very few equals, either in Jig or Clog Dances. 
They also appear in a 
German sketch, during which they 
execute their Excelsior Clog Hornpipe. In presenting these 
young ladies to his patrons, Mr. Wild does so with the as-
surance that they are artists, and in their line of business 
they stand unequalled, either in I.:1;E OPE OR AMERICA. 
; 
'

We have only made mention of a 
few of the many first 
class artists who will accompany Mr. Wild upon his Tour. 
Another big feature will be his Superb Orchestra and. 
Brass Band, who will make Grand Parades, daily, dressed 
in a 
new and gorgeous uniform, imported expressly for 
them from Europe. 
A CAD TO THE PUBLIC. 
A 
Company announcing themselves as from the Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, New York, have been imposing 
upon the inhabitants of the various Cities and Towns, 
Mr. JOSE HART, Sole Proprietor of the Theatre Comique, 
514 Broadway, New York, deems it a 
duty that he owes to 
the community at large, to denounce these glaring frauds, 
as not one member of the aforesaid organization have ever 
appeared at his Theatre, and, to the best of his knowledge 
and belief—as an Actor and Manager of over twenty year's 
standing—in any Theatre of respectability in this country. 
The community are respectfully referred to the following

Sung by the Original <
TAMES BRADLEY. 
Let all you Nigs, yes, lend your ears, 
And join me in my rhyme; 
I 
just conic up from Tennessee 
To pass away some time. 
Before I 
left, I 
loved a 
girl— 
And that I'm going to state; 
She was nothing then but a 
wee-wee child, 
But now she stands 6 
foot 8. 
CHORUS. 
Come all you Nigs and bring your gals, 
And the wedding we'll celebrate; 
The bells shall ring and Niggers sing, 
When I 
marry Shanghai Kate! 
We're going to be married a 
week from to-day, 
Pompey Jones he gives away the bride— 
In an Ab:lacca suit, and red-top boots. 
Oh ! 
be there, by her side, 
And when the preacher says, Amen 
I 
won't have a 
minute to wait, 
But we'll all go in, to cakes and gin— 
When I 
marry Shanghai Kate! 
Come all you Nigs, Sa3.

To have a

The band will play 
In the key of A, 
As the Wenches promenade the Hall, 
Plain Quadrilles— 
That would give a

At the _:•-kidillore's Fancy Ball ! 
Captain Brown, he will be there, 
With a

He'll put on

WhEu he does lead the march 
With Angelina Neversmile by his side ; 
Who's eycs would stop a

He falls in with the bums,

Sitting on the banks of the Mississippi, 
Down where the waters flow along, 
Happy as a 
worm in a 
barrel of mud. 
Levee niggers do nothing wrong— 
Steamboat whistle heard along the shore— 
Paddle wheel make the water bile. 
Putty soon the darkey heard an awful noise, 
Coming from the slippery Crocodile! 
Coming from the slippery Crocodile! 
You ought to see the tongue of that animile, 
When he opens his mouth and rolls up his eyes t 
He's -very fond of niggers that's young and fat I 
And little yaller speckled flies. 
Marster Jonah, he lived inside the Whale; 
You can bet your money that he'd spite, 
If be sleep one blessed moment, sure, 
Inside the slippery Crocodile!

On de ole plantation year's ago, 
'Fore this cruel war begun, 
We hoed the cotton all day long, 
Each happy Black and Tan; 
An when de dinner horn did toot, 
We make de hoecake sick— 
Ole Massa laugh an Missus shout 
Ah! Dinah, Jim an Joe! 
We're happy little Flip-Flaps, Flip-Flaps, Flip-Flaps, 
Eating corn meal, Slap-Jacks, Slap-Jacks, Jacks ; 
And when we think of our old home we shed a 
silent tar, 
'Till some policeman kindly says " jus walk off on your or.' 
'Twas in bright sunny Florida, 
Where sweet Persimmons grow, 
We alligators hunted, and 
First learnil de 
heel and toe !" 
Now we are free an Massa's gone, 
To de golden streets up dar, 
We nebber hear no dinner horn— 
"Twould make a 
horse fly swear. 
We're happy, &c. 
We've heard of " Freedmen's Bureau," 
An of Freedman's Washstands" too, 
Still no one offers us poor mokes 
A 
job of work to do ; 
But de good Lord dat make black an white, 
Won't let a 
sparrow fall, 
An when he blows his dinner horn, 
You bet we'll hear de call. 
We're happy, Szc.

Oh! how I 
loved a 
Deitcher girl 
Her name was Sally Kline. 
I 
took her to an oyster shop, 
And asked her if she'd dine! 
talso asked what she would have? 
Said she, I'll try a 
stew! 
And I 
will take the very same, 
So that it will please you. 
Cnoitus 
And we ate, and we ate! 
Yes, we ate the oyster stews; 
And we ate, and we ate! 
Yes, we ate the oyster stews 
And while we set there eating, 
I 
ordered a 
glass of beer; 
But as soon as we got finished, 
It made us feel quite queer! 
Said Ito her, What ails you? 
Oh, nothing! said she, my dear! 
But there must have been something 
In that there lager beer! 
And we ate, Ice. 
14 
At last I 
asked the waiter, 
While in my mind did think— 
That I 
would like to smash his nose, 
For giving us such a 
drink! 
My Sweetheart holler'd murder 1 
And dropp'd upon the floor! 
For I 
nearly killed the waiter— 
And then made for the door! 
And we ate, ecc. 
I 
had not reached but half a 
block, 
When, unto my surprise, 
The Bobby he had hold of me, 
And looked me in the eyes ; 
Said he, You're from that Oyster Shop, 
So with me you must come! 
For you hang around the Corner— 
And you're nothing but a 
Bum! 
And we ate, &c.'

THE GIRL AT PRINCE'S BAY. 
Sung by Wm. M ETZ. 
Now listen to me white folks, and I'll sing you a 
hymn, 
Its all about a 
pretty girl that at Prince's Bay would swim. 
I 
tell you she's a 
daisy, that's what all the boys did say, 
And the first acquaintance which we made was down at 
Prince's Bay! 
CHORUS. 
Yes ! It was at Prince's Bay, 
Where I 
met this darling, gay! 
I 
took her home that very night, 
And before I 
left this little 
I 
gently asked her for a 
kiss ! 
Next evening I 
went rite to the house, for on her I 
would 
call, 
And I 
met her coming down the stairs as I 
popped in the 
hall; 
Said I 
to her, good morning, dear, said she, how do you do, 
It's but a 
little while ago, when I 
was expecting you. 
Yes! It was, &c. 
She took me in the parlor and sat down by my side, 
So then, I 
asked her in joke, if she would be my bride ? 
.1 will, she answered in a 
smile, if Pa gives his consent, 
For he has a 
house and lot and it will cost no rent. 
Yes! It was, &e. 
Oh! talk about your house-lot, for that Is just what we 
could use, 
For I 
have ten dollars on the bank, and a 
pair of new clog 
shoes ; 
I 
also have a 
silver watch, that used to run all day! 
And if you have a 
chain to spare, just pass it up this way. 
Yes! It was, &c.

SUGAR CANE. 
Copyright secured in 1874. 
Sung with great success, by W ILD & BRADLEY, of Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Way down in old Carolina, 
In good old Dixie's land— 
All among the cane, 
With a 
happy darkie band. 
There we'd join together ; 
Old Massa he would bring 
Kind Missi and the little ones, 
To hear us niggers sing. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never shall forget old Aunty Dinah! 
And the fun we had in old Carolina. 
You may talk about your Jubilees— 
I 
wish they'd come again— 
I'd roll around upon the ground, 
Among the Sugar Cane! 
When the sun was boiling hot, 
Like gravey in the pan, 
I 
could tote the Sugar Cane 
With any other man. 
And when the day was over, 
To my Julia I 
would skip, 
Throw my arms around her neck, 
And kiss her on the lip 
Among the Sugar Cane, &e. 
GOOD NEWS FROM HOME. 
Sung by the 6th Ward Warblers, PATSEY MARLEY, STEPHEN 
JONES, PUCK SULLIVAN, and ANDY SOAP. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea. 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted, long ago, 
My life has been a 
scene of woe ; 
But now a 
joyful hour has come, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
Crionus. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
No Father 's 
near to guide me now, 
No Mother's tear to sooth my brow, 
No Sister's voice falls on mine ear, 
No Brother's smile to give me cheer; 
But though I 
wander far away, 
My heart is full of joy to-day, 
For friends across the Ocean's foam, 
Have sent to me good news from home. 
Good news from home, it°. 
When shall I 
see that cottage door, 
Where I've spent years of joy before ! 
'Twas then I 
knew no grief or care, 
My heart was happy there; 
Though I 
may never see it more,

My heart will be with those at home.

I'M very fond of beauties as any one can be, 
Darling one, the dearest one, I 
long so dear too see 
There's none of them can love them, except myself and you, 
For my love she is a 
yaller gal, and she's got the money too. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ? ain't she got the money, 
Yes, indeed, my honey; 
She is the sweetest flower that sips the falling dew, 
My love she is a 
yaller gal, she's got the money too. 
She takes me out a 
riding when ever she comes down, 
She's got the nicest carriage and the fastest horse in town. 
She teas me that she loves me, I 
listen, wouldn't you ? 
My love she is a 
yaller girl, she's got the money too. 
Oh! ain't, Sze. 
I'll have a 
nice piano, and won't I 
dance and sing, 
I'll have a 
hundred dollar chain, also a 
diamond pin, 
I'll have the nicest mansion upon the avenue, 
MI love she is a 
yaller gal, she's got the money too.

I'LL sing to you of a 
red-headed gal, 
Who lived in dis yer town, 
She was de boss waiter in a 
big hotel, 
Dat was kept by a 
man named Brown. 
She had carroty red eyes and pink blue hair, 
And they called her bungo 
And she fell in love wid a 
captain with whiskers. 
Wh‘i‘ 31111 on de raging canal. 
He courted her with all his might. 
And loved her full well, 
And treated his darling every night, 
To peanuts upon the half 
Ile took her out to ride one day, 
his darling bungo Sal, 
When the mule took the tooth-ache and pitched aem 
De middle of de raging canal. 
But the captain he proved false to her, 
his darling bungo 
And she met him in his Sunday clothes, 
In company with a 
tin-ware gal. 
When Sally found her love was false, 
It nearly broke her heart, 
And she stabbed herself one fine day, 
With the shell of a 
crab apple tart. 
Now the tin-ware gal went crazy then, 
Tore her hair and rung her han is, 
And drowned her in self defence, 
In one of her large dish pans; 
And the captain with the whiskers di-aracted went, 
And since has never been seen, 
S'o he cat off his Nviiisk-e- and died with the croup, 
For the \vearieg of Lie gri..en. 
Song and Dance by E. D. GOODING. 
Sung by JOHNNY W ILD, 
I 
ASK your attention for a 
little while, 
List while I 
relate— 
Of a 
little charmer that caught me in her toils, 
And doubtless sealed my fate; 
IIer eyes like violets bathed in dew, 
Or diamonds rich and rare, 
And a 
voice like the murmurings of the streamlet, 
She's the fairest of the fair; 
Since we met I 
can't forget her charming ways, [um.] 
Or her virtues which you'd surely praise. [sym.] 
CIIORIIA. 
I'm captivated by her winning voice, 
Like zephyrs in the air, 
I'd be in Eden—could I 
win this maiden, 
She's the fairest of the fair. 
Oft did we wander in pale moonlight, 
'Neath the shady grove, 
And with her hand so lightly in mine, 
Breathe my heartfelt love; 
And she'd thank me for my esteem, 
But to wed she did not care, 
And then toss her tresses—inviting caresses, 
She's the fairest of the fair, 
When next we meet low at her feet I'll tell my love again, 
[sym.] 
By J. B. MunPnr. 
Sang by JOHNNY W ILD. 
FOLKS wonder why I 
look so glum, 
And seldom show my face, 
As once I 
did, a 
year ago, in every public place, 
But they don't know how my poor heart was shivered up so fine, 
By him that lives across the street—the chap in No. 9. 
CHORUS. 
My heart is broke—I 
nearly choke—when thinking of the time, 
That Sarah Glass—run off alas—with the chap in No. 9. 
I'll tell you simply how it was and how it came to pass, 
I 
loved a 
chambermaid next door her name was Sarah Glass; 
I 
thought her soul a 
mirror pure—reflecting truth to mine, 
Tho' oft she flashed a 
smile upon the chap in No. 9. 
I 
took Miss Glass to operas, balls, and every brilliant place, 
And doted on her crystal eyes and clear, transparent face; 
I 
bought her gems of sparkling hue and presents rare and fine, 
And dreamed of her and future bliss nor thought of No. 9. 
At length the wished-for time was fixed to join our fates for life, 
When Sarah Glass should ease my 
pains and be my darling wife; 
I 
danced and sang all day with joy, such bliss I 
can't define, 
Nor envied once the fortunes of the chap in No. 9. 
Alas upon the very day that we were to be wed, 
My hopes were shattered—Sarah Glass cleared out, vamoosed 
and fled, 
IIer vows as brittle as her name, she broke with full design, 
She sloped—run off—got—went—with the chap in No. 9. 
And now the dark and dismal hours in loneliness I 
pass, 
Like some deserted picture-frame, forsaken by my glass; 
Lire's bitter goblet thus I 
drain and not a 
hope is mine, 
For they were smashed to pieces by the chap in No. 9. 
BURY YOUR DOG IN THE GARDEN, 
Written by G. L. SrouTE, and sung by JOILNNY W ILD. 
WHAT I 
know about farming 
Don't amount to much, 
But I 
know a 
very good maxim 
That they have amongst the Dutch: 
In cultivating your garden, 
I'll have you all to know, 
If you bury your dog in that garden, 
It will make your grape vines grow. 
A 
friend of mine had a 
bull dog, 
bull dog big and bold, 
AVIio was no good to make hash of, 
lie was too tough and old ; 
And how to 0-et rid of this canine, 
lie didn't exactly know, 
So he buried this dog in his garden, 
Anti it made his grape vines grow. 
You can't tell a 
dog from a 
grape vine, 
If on see timn in the dark, 
For a 
bull dog like a 
grape vine, 
Has got a 
very rough bark. 
But J 
won't detain you longer, 
For I 
think I 
better go 
And bury my dog in my garden, 
And make my grape vines ()Tow.

Sure I

When he said old man! you're getting too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on ice 
He told the old woman for to take a drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh! her heart is broke, God knows it is,

He'll come rolling home, &c. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until night; 
And if the policeman says, " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite. 
He went to the market only yesterday,

And he got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang !" 
He'll come rolling home, &c.

THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry,. 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay ; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nov, 
he's gone away! 
Ho was great, &e.. 
I 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor ; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair ; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
ulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, (te. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, . 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &c. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, &c. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man ; 
Bat now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, dm

BARN YARD SONG-. 
As sung by DR. Jas L. 
THAYER. 
Oh! Now kind friends, here I 
am; 
I've got it song that's new— 
I 
hope you'll not be offended 
If I 
sing it now to you; 
For when I 
see you look so glad, 
I'm sure it is no harm, 
To sing about the times we had 
When we lived on the farm. 
Cuonus. 
The Chickens crow! 
The Pigs do squeal! 
The Cows do lundly bawl ! 
! 
Those, the sounds I 
like to hear 
There's music in them all. 
Get up. oh, in the morning, 
Before the break of day; 
Go down into the cornfields 
To scare fho crows away ! 
And when the Sun begins to rise, 
The darkey's hoe and rake— 
Then conies the darke,y's joy and pride, 
The homminy and cake! 
Chorus. 
There's Old Alarster, good and kind ; 
He always looks so smiling 
You'd think his heart was full of joy— 
And it was over boiling. 
But now Old Marst€r is dead and gone; 
He lives in death's cold arm, 
He's left Old Jeff, and all the rest, 
Alone upon the Farm! 
(Imitations of Fowls, Pigs and Cows.) 
Chorus. 
1- CA1\7160T T.LL TO' WHY. 
Of what I'm going to sing is true, 
Perhaps 'twill make you laugh, 
Attention then I 
beg of you, 
But I'll only tell you half. 
A handsome swell I 
met ono day, 
And as be passed me by 
Ile doffed his hat to me so gay, 
But I 
can't tell you why. 
CIIOnus 
that handsome, dashing swell 
To me did wink his eye, 
Iike a 
shadow in my way he fell, 
But I 
can't tell you why. 
Ae'd lavender kids upon his hand 
And carried a 
nobby cane— 
I'd be the proudest in the land 
If I 
but knew his name; 
Little hands, a 
little foot, 
Eyes like the dark blue sky— 
He's just the one that would me suit, 
But I 
can't tell you why. 
And that, etc. 
Whene'er I 
meet him on the street 
He's sure to bow to me, 
And then I 
glance down at my feet,--
'Tis bashfulness, you see; 
No miter where we chance to be, 
He always winks his eye, 
And then be bows so gracefully— 
But I 
can't tell you why. 
And that, etc. 
I 
see him now a 
sitting there, 
The third seat in the row, 
With that most distinguised air 
That's always on a 
beau: 
I 
know it is? dreadful sin 
To do it on the sly, 
But I'll just throw a 
kiss to him— 
But 1 
can't tell you why. 
And that, etc,

She slowly answered " No!" 
And left me standing all alone

Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me ; 
Far away on the rolling billow, 
Ere the morn I 
will be. 
Sounds of war call me afar, 
And though with thee I 
fain would stay, 
When honor calls I 
must away. 
Lady, riso from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me ; 
Far away on the rolling billow, 
Ere the morn, I

Lady rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And breathe a 
prayer for me, 
When far away beyond the rolling billow, 
I 
fight for home and thee. 
And if I 
fall, my constant soul 
E'en at the gate of death will stay, 
'Till thine shall flee from earth away. 
Lady rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to rae ; 
Far away on the rolling billow, 
Ere the morn, I 
must be. 
Lady rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And greeting give to me, 
When once again across the rolling billow 
I 
return to thee. 
All the brave are on the wave, 
And though with thee I 
fain would stay, 
When honor calls I 
must away. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me ; 
Far away on the rolling billows, 
Eere the morn, I 
must be.

Blow your own trumpet when you have the chance, 
It's a 
maxim I'll practice and preach, 
And sound your own praises, iryou would advance, 
13 what I'll endeavor to teach. 
Modesty's charming, no doubt, in its place, 
But I'm sorry to say it don't pay, 
For the modest man finds that he's soon left behind 
By the man who had plenty to say. 
CHORUS. 
Blow your own Trumpet, where ever you go. 
For nobody else will, if you don't, you know, 
Make man respect you, or they will neglect you, 
Blow your own Trumpet yourself, you know. 
There have been men of genius who have died of despair, 
Unrewarded by fortune and fame; 
In vain they have struggled for many long years, 
They could not establish a 
name. 
Perhaps you will ask me the reason, it is, 
Their modesty caused their defeat, 
They've been passed, in the road, for position and place, 
By some numskull with heaps of conceit. 
Blow your own trumpet, 
So,' if you have talent, don't hide it, my friend, 
That is if to rise you aspire, 
The higher you raise it, the more men will praise it, 
If you tell them just what to admire; 
For the public will follow the leader, my boys, 
Like sheep that are led to a 
fold ; 
So if you just tell them how clever you are. 
Ten to one, they'll believe what they're told. 
Blow your own trumpet, iko. 
Blow your own Trumpet rind blazpn your name, 
Wherever you happen to be, 
Don't wait for a 
herald to trumpet your name, 
If distinguished you're an xi
ous t
o be 
Don't go to the rear, but push on, never fear, 
And do not forget my advice, 
But blow your own Trumpet as onward you go, 
And you'll get to the front in a 
trice. 
Blow your own Trumpet, 4tc.

What ? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may thCr 
forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is sadden'd and weary. 
See the tears how they course down his cheeks I 
Oh, this world it is lonely and drary, 
And his heart f-u. relief vainic s,
±"eks. 
CHORUS. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by ; 
Then over the hill to the poor house, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
Ah me ! on that old doorstep yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lily with prattle so sweet ' 
God knows how their father has loved them, 
But theyy've driven him out in the street. 
For he's old, &c.. 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful, affectionate wife; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; he gave them 
A 
deed for the farm 1 
aye, and more, 
lie gave them this house they were born in! 
And now he's tuned out from its door. 
For he's old, &c. 
Oh, children ! loved children! yet hear me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age: 
My life-blood I'd gladly have given, 
To shield and protect you 1 
but hark ! 
Though my heart breaks, Fli say it's you've driven 
Me out here to die in the dark. 
For he's old, &c. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me ; 
Farewell, dear old home, ah ! farewell 1 
Each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell : 
Well 1 
the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn ; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For he's old, &c. 
The Animals' Fair; or, Carter's Dream.

in going to sing, 
Is just the *, le to suit you. 
I 
had a 
dratm sad it did seem 
To be m, ,st awful queer; 
For the Birds and Bas's they had:a Fair, 
And I 
was oversecr. 
It was the Animals' Ftlir, 
The Birds and Beasts were thcre; 
The gay baboon l,y 
lie light of the moon 
lie combeel, hi, Auburn hair, 
The mon;a7 he got drunk, 
Fell down rya the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneeze 1, 
Fell on his knees, 
And how was that for the monk_ 
The jay-bird played the flute, 
The musk-rat played the fiddlc; 
The tiger-cat and the mouse 
Danced up and down the miado. 
The clef hant hugged the bull do,.,'s neck, 
And the bear got up his dander; 
The camel smashed 
fox ia the eyes; -. 
And bit off the ear of the -rincler. 
The bear he wanted a 
drink, 
The crocodile he did wink, 
They toss d 
a 
cent, 
The goose was sent. 
But she got full with the mink. 
The musquito said to the flee 
This is no place for me; 
The musquito stung the lion's nose, 
And the wild- cat swallowed the bee, 
The squirrel he called for hash, 
And fish-balls made of mud, 
The cow she chewed tobacco, 
Then threw away her cud. 
Fresh green-peas from cinnamon trees, 
Grass-soups and wine w as called; 
The pigs did cry " root hog or die," 
And the cats in chorus mauled. 
But it soon began to rain, 
The fair to an end it came; 
The monkey kissed 
The donkey's wife, 
The mule be laughed quite plain; 
he bull-dog lost his tail, 
The grasshopper he turned pale. 
The donkey stabbed the mule with his ear, 
And hung himself to a 
nail.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
,The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast 
heard my mother 
say— 
Waste not, want net, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " disp.atch," and practice what yoza-
preach ; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to lie a 
mischief- making boy, 
Destruction seem'd may only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when oftthnes well chastised,. 
how father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark:d in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn with care and Etrifeq, 
I 
speculated foolishly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, S:c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twat 
hot, 
I 
seiz'd my opportunities and never once forgot— 
Waste pot, S. 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The le,s_Rons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee-
ls, waste not, & c.

Goes a

Like a

Happy as a 
little queen is my darling Dora Dare.

Hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring, 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hear.

Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare, 
Dora with the lillies of the valley in her hair, 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair, 
My heart it will go pit- a- pat at sight of Dora Dare. 
All the laddies are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet, 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the 
while, 
What has passed between us, Dora Dare and I, 
3Iust be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again my Dora Dare will wear, 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her hair. 
Sweet Dora Dare, &e.

rtz are melting with fervent love; 
Red cheek:, are paling, sweethearts bewailing, 
Tarry not one moment from ilie girl you love. 
She's sure to cheer you when she comes near you, 
She's ever waiting for the fond sweet kiss; 
If you're inclined for a 
midnight ramble, 
Tell me what you think of a 
scene like this. 
CEIORIJS. 
Wait till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk, 
Mind what yon say, boys. that's how to court her, 
Tell her that you'll wed when the days grow short. 
See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight, making the heart bright, 
Waking up the little birds before the break ot day. 
Tickling and teazing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots oi little fibs, and swearing they are true, 
Some say it's naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait one moment and I'll tell you what to do. 
Wait till the moonlight, ct,c, 
As sung by TONY PASTOR.: 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A I 
or little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev•ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say : 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind,. 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.— And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
the would never have exclaimed: 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
Aid when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
polieem.,n passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
tine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
Fin thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little w-fe. 
SPOKEN.— And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim

My admiration was bestowed

With a

On her nigh-heeled boots, 
And her fancy little step.

grieve, 
I 
really think its mean; 
And after this I

That love is but a

Far away in suuny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I

Singing to a

And she wore beneath a

She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever'faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere Lie summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was clearer than the dearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tresies tied in blue. 
She was fair, AT. 
'Twas decreed that fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well ; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in eery vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, &c.

The mill shut down to-dly, dear wife, 
here's nothing here to eat, 
And look, the boots I've worn a

Are dropping off my feet ; 
My clothes are hardly decent, wife, 
While you are ragged, too, 
And famine stares us in the face, 
Oh, what are we to do.

Oh, what are we to do.. clear wife,

The mill shut down to-day. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The coal is nearly gone. 
And sea, there's scarcely wood enough 
To kindle in the morn ; 
The landlord will be coming soon 
To get the rent from you, 
And I 
have not a 
cent to pay 
The bills becoming due. 
Oh, what, &c. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The snow is on the ground, 
And hark ! the piercing winds without 
flow mournfully they sound ; 
The children have no shoes to wear, 
They cry for milk and bread, 
But, wife, the mills have stopped to-day, 
How shall we all be fed ?

perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it : 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order has 
been sent us called HUMPTY DUMPTY,' and hound in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture-
book 
printed and colored, it is so bound that a 
prac-
tised maniptlIntor taking it up and flirtinv the leaves rapidly 
over, can makc t 
appear to be filled with copies of only one 
picture. or with blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
suc-
cession of figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumb-
ed, appears to contain nothing but the portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit : the next, only Columbine , 
then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles.

little practice, and the directions printed with the book will 
make anybody at home in the handling of it."—Phita. Even-

Tt; those who have never perused the sad story of CHAR-
LOTTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor• 
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
Ills book, in the language of lirs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking example that vice, however prosperous in the he-
tinning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Tempk. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the riiiest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments lnd rair resulting from once yidd-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

It zives information of the modus oper-

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which ca. I 
be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mt,.•nanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics ; in his search among 
the many mechanical text-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc. —.Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in o manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair know coge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a \yolk 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make thun-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to nfer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might b advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper. and bound in still cloth covers.
