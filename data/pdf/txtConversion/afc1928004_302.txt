We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep stq, cte. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emeeald Hall, and an illegant supper 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frig,azees, and oysters fat for 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and 
Irish quail 
so grand; 
you, 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani, 
gans band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel. 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when mornitvr comes it's home we steal. 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan'S battcle

SPARKING SUNDAY NIGHT, 
As Sung by the For SISTERS. 
Sitting in a 
corncr, on a 
Sunday eve, 
With a 
taper'd finger resting on your sleeve ; 
Starlight eyes are casting on your face their light, 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, sparking Sunday night! 
How your heart is thumping 'gainst your Sunday vest, 
How wickedly 'tis working on this day of rest ; 
Hours seem but minutes, as they take their flight, 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, sparking Sunday night. 
DA and mama are sleeping in their peaceful bed, 
Dreaming of the things the folks in meeting said ; 
"Love ye one anofher," ministers recite, 
Bless me, don't we do it—sparking Sunday night! 
One arm with gentle pressure, lingers 'round her waist 
You squeeze her dimpl'd hand her pouting lips you taste 
She freely slaps your face, but more in love than spite. 
Thunder! ain't it pleasant sparking Sunday night! 
But hark ! the clock is striking two o'clobk, I 
snum, 
Sure as I'm a 
sinner, the time to go has come ; 
You ask, in spiteful accents, if that old clock is right, 
And wonder if it ever—sparked on Sunday night. 
One, two, three sweet kisses, four, five, six you hook, 
But thinking that you rob her, put back those you took, 
Then as for home you hurry, from the fair one's sight, 
Don't you wish each day was only Sunda' night. 
LITTLE VIOLET. 
Conversational Duet and Dance. 
Composed by 
ROLLIN HOWARD. 
As sung by the Fox SISTERS. 
BERTne.—Coming through the fields to-day, 
A 
charming sight to see; 
The violets seem to scent the air, 
And that a 
joy to me. 
That name first made mc fall in love 
With a 
bit of a 
coquette; 
Who could help it, or would rove 
From little Violet. 
DUET AS CHORUS. 
IDA.—Violet ! 
Violet! The charming little Violet, 
BERTHA. — Maidei . fair with chestnut hair, 
Charming little Violet. 
IDA.—I've a 
secret—no one's near, 
You'll not tell ?--I'll tell you ! 
A 
young man I 
know loves me dear; 
Now what am Ito do ? 
He kissed me just like our Ring Dove, 
I 
felt so shamed—and yet 
Felt pleased when he called me " love" 
And little Violet. 
[Dance. 
Duet, Chorus, &c. 
BEIITIIA.—Lucky accident, fair maid, 
This meeting, now, with you.

Ah, ha! we're off so gaily, 
Now let others take the rear, 
We're coming solid to the front, 
Of that don't have a 
fear; 
The Mulligan's, the lloolihan's, 
The Dougher y's and all; 
When we're paradin' thro' the stets, 
We drive them to the wall. 
Cnonus. 
First the left and then the right, 
But never both together; 
The tall, the short, the thick, the thin, 
We're worse, begob, than leather; 
As we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
I 
tell you we're the cards, 
We're bound to be the Hummers, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
So now we are the darlings, 
On that you may bet high, 
We have a 
prize for every man, 
And forty more besides. 
We don't mix with the common ones, 
For ourselves we have regard, 
We are 
A 
One" above the crowd, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
First the left, (5.:,c. 
Then you should come and see us 
As we march down Broadway; 
They are a 
gallant lot of men, 
I'm sure we'll hear you say. 
The " Seventh " come and gaze at us, 
And then they beat retreat ; 
It's no use, boys, they give it up, 
They know we can't be beat! 
First the left, Sx.

HOOP-LA 
As Sung by the Fox SISTERS. 
Listen to ray tale of woe : 
At a 
circus long ago, 
Hoop- la I

Round the ring there used to ride, 
One who was mv joy and pride, 
Hoop-la! Hoop-la I 
Hoop-la ho! 
"Ms4m,selle do Cherrytoes " that's what the blitsvid, 
Encore a 
hundred times, I 
with a

Such beauty ne'er was seen, all red, and blue and green. 
Outside a 
piebald, spotted steed.

Round the ring she used to go, 
Like an arrow from a 
bow, 
Hoop-la I

And my head was In a

Thro' this darling little girl, 
Hoop-lal Hoop-la 1

Pretty was the little head, 
Musical the voice that said : 
Hoop-la I 
Hoop-la 1 
Hoop-la ho 1 
And I 
thought I'd make my bride, 
Her who in the circus cried, 
Hoop-la 1 
Hoop-la! 
Hoop-la ho 1 
I 
bought boquets for her, eighteen or twenty, 
And at the stage door I 
left presents in plenty ; 
Rid gloves and pretty rings, Pit stalls and other things, 
Took all my quarter's salary. 
Bound the ring, tsc. 
I 
was mad. beyond a 
doubt, 
In my dreams I 
shouted out— 
Hoop la 1 
Hoop-la! 
Hoop-la ho I 
Said the doctor, that they called, 
" 
What's the matter?" and I 
bawled— 
Hoop-la! 
Hoop-la 1 
Hoop-la ho! 
Said I, " I'll speak to her—tell her I 
love her; 
And if she cares for me, soon I'll discover." 
So to the circus I 
rushed off, and presently, 
Out stepped the fair Miss Lnerrytoes. 
Round the ring, &e. 
" 
Darling, dearest one," said I, 
" 
Ever since I 
heard you cry— 
Hoop-la 1

'" Sorry am I," said she, " that you adore me, 
For I've my husband here, now waiting for me."

My dream has flown forever. Round the ring, &C

The regiment is forming, now, 
The ranks are nearly ; 
For valor or for victory, 
Our hearts are always drilrd. 
All Irishmen unite with us, 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or die like soldiers, 
In the Irish regiment ! 
In Wvihing uniform we.go, 
So straight in every fine, 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And_say we look so fine. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, that waits the bugles call, 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall ! 
Of raging war or cannon's roar, we have no fear at all— 
We'll 'Larch away to glory in the Irish Regiment ! 
We'll show the Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do ; 
In the Armory or battle-field, 
To duty we are true ; 
When marching on the gay parade, 
We are the nation's pride ; 
While the " Stars and Stripes" and Erin's flag 
Are flying side by side ! 
In dashing uniform, & c., with Chorus. 
The cause we serve is Liberty ! 
And we're a 
valiant band ; 
Some day we'll see the tyrants fall, 
And freedom in our land ; 
But far away we now must stay, 
And be with hope content; 
While marching on to victory, 
In the Irish regiment ! 
In dashing uniform, kc., with Chorus.

They Borrow, But Never Return. 
Copyrighted 1.8.76, and Music Pub. E EL HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
As Sung by the Fox SISTERS. 
As we pass, day by day, thro' life's busy highway, 
There are many strange people we see ; 
And the worst, I 
conclude, are the ones who intrude 
On our charity, be it so free. 
For they seem to depend upon what we will lend, 
Not a 
dollar they honestly earn ; 
Yet they prosper and thrive, and the way survive 
18, to borrow and never return ! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they borrow but never return, 
So of course it is easy to learn, 
There are some folks that live, not to spend or to give, 
But to borrow and never return! 
If you '
it::: up in store a 
few Jollars or more, 
Upon this you can truly depend, 
They \wall sure) find it out, and they'll chase you about, 
Till they force yea .\ our money to lend. 
If you doubtingly say, 
1 
ni afraid you won't pay," 
Such ideas of course they will spurt" ; 
And you'll tind out some day, I 
am right when I 
say, 
That they borrow, but never return ! 
Yes, they botrow, &c. 
In the fashion they dress, and their manners express 
They have plenty to eat and to wear ; 
But they'd be in the shade if their bills were all paid, 
And the poor-house would have them in care. 
'Tis no wonder they smile when they pass you in style— 
It is better to beg than to earn ; 
While it's true, as a 
rule, they will deem you a 
fool, 
When they borrow, to never return! 
Yes, they borrow, &e.

Why can't I

And he should see me safely

GIVE A 
MAN A 
CHANCE. 
iing by MISS ELLA W ESNEE, in G, with great success. 
I'm tired of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song of a 
different stamp; 
A 
title far from strange. 
So while I 
strive to do my best, 
At me pray take a 
glance, 
Just let your sympathizing ears, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
Cnonns. 
So always boys act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune gTants; 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up, 
Twenty shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps, if breathing time be giv'n 
The needful will be found. 
Say to him, " Well, I'll wait a 
bit ;" 
Think of this circumstance, 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always boys, &c. 
My song, perhaps, may not please you, 
But to do so is my aim; 
To meet your kind approval. 
Is the summit of my fame. 
But if you do not quite agree 
With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always boys, .k.c. 
As sung by Miss ELLA. W ESNER. 
One Saturday, just for a 
change, 
I 
thought I'd take a 
walk, 
Along the East River, 
Now of New York all the talk, 
When a 
pretty girl accosted me, 
" 
Oh pardon me, I 
pray, 
But I 
want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, 
Please Sir, which is the way ?" 
Crionus. 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
Wasn't it a 
jolly spree ; 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
This pretty, pretty girl enchanted me. 
On saying this she smiled a 
bit 
And gave a 
quiet " hem ;" 
For a 
second I 
was taken back, 
For she was a 
perfect gem; 
But I 
replied, and instantly, 
" 
It wasn't far away, 
And by her leave. I'd show her there 
Without the least delay. 
As I 
stroll'd, 
I 
proffered and she took nay arm, 
Which I 
thought would be refused, 
'• I'll have your Gas," the urchins cried, 
At which I 
felt amused ; 
For she really was a 
sort of girls 
You don't meet every day ; 
She seemed to cast a 
spell on me 
I 
could not throw away. 
As I 
stroll' d, &c. 
She told me as we walked along, 
" 
That her name was Mary Bell," 
And said, besides, 
she knew my Ma, 
And hoped she was quite well," 
But when she said, " your name is Brown, 
And you live near Parerapo, ( N. J.) 
I 
thought I'd picked up with a 
witch, 
Or else how could she know. 
As I 
stroli'd, 
I 
taxed my memory as to where 
I'd seen tier face before, 
But was aroused—as old St, John 
Chimed out the hour of four; 
Said she, " oh laws! I 
must be off 
For I'm ten minutes late ; 
Take this address and call on me, 
To-morrow night at eight." 
As I 
stroll'd, &c. 
Now to cut my little story short, 
Also my hopes and joys, 
I 
called and found she was a 
wife— 
With two bonny girls and boys; 
And her husband was a 
lighterman, 
Upon the Noeth and East River by names 
For once, done brown, was Brown, by one 
Of nature's purest gems.

I'M a 
fella you'll please understand 
Who likes to keep pace with the fashion; 
Tho' I 
don't quite go in' for

I 
confess that for dress I've a 
passion. 
I 
flatter myself I 
am able 
To show it off too and all that, 
I'm up to each mode on the table 
So what do you think of my hat. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the swell with the Alpine hat, 
The swell with the Alpine hat; 
In the street or the park, observers remark 
The swell with the Alpine hat. 
I've a 
rare swarm of base imitators, 
Who try to outdo me, that's flat. 
You must know now that I 
was the first 
To introduce this kind of hat. 
I 
saw it while crossing the Alps, 
In Boulogne too, the swells cut it fat; 
With this kind of castor, and so 
I 
brought over the new Alpine hat. 
I'm the swell with the, etc. 
Some say I 
look like 
William Tell,' 
Others think me a ' Merry Swiss Boy,' 
A 
retired organ-grinder one said I 
was, 
Which of course a 
chap's feelings annoy; 
Now I'm neither the one, nor the other, 
I'm a 
native of Hoxton, that's flat, 
But it gives one a 
foreign appearance— 
This new style of Alpine hat. 
I'm the swell with the, etc. 
It has such an effect on the ladies, 
At me now the darlings do stare; 
Imitation they say, is but flattery 
So the same kind of hat now they wear, 
Pm engaged to be wed to an angel, 
Who's possess'd of some coin and all that 
She confessed that she could not withstand me. 
And twas all thro' my new Alpine hat.

CUTS OF LIFE. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STIcKNRY. 
Now the song I'm going to sing to You, 
And what it is about, 
If you give me your attention, 
You will quickly find it out, 
'Tis about the cutting affairs of life, 
A 
savage subject but, 
'Tis none the less a 
true one—for, 
All nature has to cut, 
First the darling little baby, 
Cuts its darling little teeth, 
And the doctor cuts its little gums, 
To soothe its little grief, 
And when its a 
little older, 
It begins to cut up jack, 
Then its mama cuts a 
little switch, 
And cuts its little' back. 
Now the butcher cuts your mutton chops, 
The cook cuts up your hash, 
The tailor cuts the dandy's coat, 
The dandy cuts a 
dash; 
The circus clown cuts capers, 
The ring master cuts the clown, 
And then he cuts the horses up, 
To make them go around. 
46.4 the Dolly Yarcim cut*, 
Whe4 they Fo 
Their shoes. are tilt s 
O very =tall, 
They cut their pretty feet. 
Should you tell them that it cuts your hearts 
_ . 
To see thern cut up ao, 
They'll give you a 
eutting look will say, 
Now you just cut and go. 
Now employers cut your wages down, 
Such cuts you do not like, 
So you quickly cut away from work, 
And cut oc; on a 
strike, 
There are love -nits and business cuts, 
There's cuts of every kind, 
Even little boys can't steal a 
ride, 
Without its cut behind, 
But of all the many cuts of life, 
The unkindest cut of all, 
Is the cut an old friend gives you, 
When misfortunes on you fall, 
But there's a 
cut we all must feel, 
Before we enl the strife, 
'Tis when death comes to close the scene, 
And cuts the thread of life.

Marching away with the fife and the drum; 
All tell the story, we go for glory, 
Soldiers to fight for the kingdom come! 
We take our water pure. 
While whiskey you secure, 
We are on the road to glory, 
The shortest path, that's sure. 
No matter how we're dry, 
We don't drink on the sly, 
" 
Cold water" is our watchword, 
And the " T. A. ifs" our cry. 
Yes, we have joined, /Le,

You see how strong we seem, 
Bad whiskey's but a 
dream, 
'Tis but the skim milk of the world, 
Cold water sure's the cream!

If our pledge we do not break, 
A 
drop of the " old cratur," boys, 
Just for the stomach's sake.

Cheeks as hard as rocks 
There on the street from morn ' till night, 
And never change their socks. 
All in a

These rosebuds all parade! 
They stand for ladies to admire 
In the Matinee Brigade! 
Jawdge, and Chawles and Jerome are there, 
Got up with wondrous skill; 
And when they wink their naughty eye 
It never fails to kill. 
With ten cent canes and dizzy suits 
By a 
sheeny tailor made. 
The choicest plums in all the land 
Are the Matinee Bride. 
There on the mash, tte. 
They always strike an attitude 
To give themselves a 
tone, 
They live on love and Dutch free lunch, 
And smell of bad cologne! 
I'll bet two cents if the truth was known 
Their wash- bills wasn't paid ; 
But nobody knows how hard they mash 
In the Matinee Brigade!

Mind the child awhile! 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a

And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, &e. 
Ah when Nelly grew up to a

But still he is devoted 
In love to me, you see, 
And when he is promoted, 
Then he will marry me. 
Re's gone, 
As Sung by Tux BEALLAMS. 
Pon my life I'm so dreadfully naughty, 
I'm always at some naughty act; 
I 
don't want to startle you ladies, 
By stating so well known a 
fact. 
In confidence, mind, it's a 
secret, 
You'll keep it—I 
know ladies cau— 
1 
am, oh! I 
am, though I 
say it, 
I 
am such a 
naughty young man.

Pon my life, now, I'm dreadfully naughty, 
Oh! so naughty—very naughty; 
And the ladies ' twixt sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty young man. 
I 
once took my Grandma to Greenwich, 
She paid for the shrimps and the tea ; 
But then we gay naughty young feltows, 
Do love, so, a 
deuce of a 
spree ; 
We didn't get home * till past seven— 
The evening was growing quite dark, 
Miamma, was so anxious about us— 
But then we fast boys love a 
lark ! 
SPOREN.—I 
was always of a 
fast turn of mind; I 
go in for 
glorious dissipation, keep white mice and silk-worms— 
the silk-worms are fast too—I 
met one of them on the 
stairs this morning, ha! ! I 
love a 
joke, but then— 
Pon my life, now, &c. 
I've a 
cousin, and she's Uncle's daughter, 
I 
took her out once for a 
walk, 
You'd really have thought we were lovers, 
To judge from our looks and our talk; 
She into a 
pastry-cook's, took me, 
And I 
had two tarts and an ice; 
And that you'll adnait's dissipation, 
And filling besides, at the price. 
SPOKEN. —I 
made a 
splendid joke in the shop when 
they opened the lemonade and the cork popped, I 
said 
" 
that's popping the question." and she said: 
Oh! you 
naughty young man— 
Pon my life, now, &T. 
At " Kiss in the Ring" I'm considered, 
A 
naughty young man for the work; 
And at that fast game '• Hunt the Slipper," 
They call me a 
terrible Turk; 
At Christmas the ladies avoid me, 
'Cos, under the Misletoe bough 
I 
once kissed the eldest Miss Wilkins, 
And didn't I 
get in a 
row! 
• SPOK1N. — Yes, she was a 
devlish handsome woman, too, 
pass'd p'rhaps eight and fifty—but they like it, Sir—we 
gay naughty dogs, you see, ha! ha! 
The other night I 
went to the pit of the theatre, and in the crowd my two 
arms found themselves forced round two ladies waists— 
for shame! but then— 
Crronus. 
Pon my life, now, I'm dreadfully naughty, 
Oh ! so naughty—very naughty ; 
And the ladies ' twixt sixteen and forty, 
Say I

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regain 
Army, Oh!" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go, 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
G
;17 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more. 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure the made me walk the 
floor! 
We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
CHORUS. 
" 
Lift ! Lift!" the sargint used to say, 
"Now ye's have it ! can't ye keep it 7 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! Shoulder arms!' 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid 
Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very difflkilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paraffin' in the Hall; 
At alch mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
"Yer as awkward as the divil; doan't ye hould yer 0
-on that 
way!" 
43 
Whine'er next spake an ordher, but egad! 'twas wid a 
vim; 
I 
often wished, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh' d 
twenty stone, while I 
was very slink 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift!" &c. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we'll plod, 
Shouldher arms and counther marchin' in the timid "Awkwara 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift!" Icr.. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral 1 
be, 
I'll make 'em feel me vingeance, all sargints under me! 
I'll have 'em marchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk, 
rejuice them to the ranks at wance, and there I'll make 'em 
walk! 
If that ain't punishment enough, " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

Whenever he took command.

We shouldered guns 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the 
Connemarro pet, 
With the Rub, dub, club, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red boys, 
To show where we came from; 
Our guns we'd lift 
With the right ihoulder 
As we marched to the beat of the dram. 
We sbouldr)rid, 
When we'd g.t home at night, boys, 
The divil a

We'd all set up and drink a

Of Whisky, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in,

Cupid they say is a 
wonderful mystery, 
Often deceives and so with your " leaves," 
I'll give you a 
"page" of a 
sorrowful history," 
" 
Bound" up in trouble am I. 
My heart has been wounded, I'm sadly afraid, 
With darts from the eyes of my young Ladies maid; 
Like a 
rose in the night, I 
shall wither and fade, 
In the bloom of my life I 
shall die. 
For she says I'm possess'd of a 
great deal of vanity, 
Calls me a 
boy and a 
hobble-de hoy! 
And declares me a 
wonderful piece of humanity, 
Poor little Buttons am I. 
AIR. — Pretty Little Flora. 
She comes into the kitchen. looking so bewitching, 
She little knows how very much I 
prize her. 
Pretty smiles so simple, showing up each dimple, 
ljdion the face of Ann Eliza. 
Once I 
used. to think she kept a 
smile or two for me, 
And when she call'd me Dickie, I 
would jump about 
with glee; 
But now it's coldly Richard, I'm plung'd in misery, 
For life's a 
blank if wanting Ann Eliza. 
She come into the kitchen, looking se bewitching, 
She little knows how very much I 
prize her. 
Pretty smiles so simple, showing up each dimple 
Upon the charming face of Ann Eliza.

Why Richard how you start. 
Oh ! " Ann Eliza," if you could but " Analyze" my 
heart, 
You'd find I 
"pine." 
ANN ELIZA. 
Have done sir, pray, I 
really can't afford 
The time to listen, and must say I 
feel a 
great "Deal 
Bored." 
I 
wish I 
was a 
noble with a 
long pedigree, 
Or a 
Captain of a 
man of war that sails upon the sea; 
Or but a 
country gentleman, I'm neither of the three, 
So I'm left all-alone for to die. 
Oh my!

I've seen enough of you.

In pity hear my prayer. 
ANN ELIZA, 
I've no wish to renew the conversation, 
And must say I've seen enough of you. 
Talking will not do, I've no wish to renew the con-
versation, 
And repeat I've seen enough of you.

Wasting am I, soon there'll not be a

Poor little Buttons am I! 
No longer I'll stay to be treated with scorn, 
I'll be off as fast as my legs can carry me,

And come back without them, a 
figure forlorn, 
Then who do you think would be willing to marry ye ?

No longer I'll stay to be treated with scorn, 
No more in the kitchen I'll be an auxilliary,

But hark! there's the bells for us ringing,

THE SLIGO MUSKET 
BERS. 
Words and Music by HIRP.Y BENNETT. 
Written expressly 
for TrEn.-Ex & CRONIN. 
Oh, let ye stand from under now and open wide your ears, 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West thay made us go 
And we worked at canalling in the State of Oh-ho-ho. 
But when the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
Company and wint into the fray; 
We fought the ragged rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they could'ut bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our laa, ha, ha, ha, hayfoot, straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many's the time we thought we'd thought we'd never 
see our homes again; 
The rebels fought like devils, but their fighting was in vain, 
For they could'ut bate the Sligo Musteteers. 
We fought wid. Banks and Burnside, and wid Grant wt 
took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, though he was small, our gallant little 
Mac ; 
Faith ! if they'd let him have his way, he'd surely drive 
thim back. 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers. 
Sur 
he knew how to Engineer, likewise to command; 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c. 
But now our lave of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd as you all to take a 
ball, but we're without a 
cint; 
On Erie shares, and all such snares, our money it is lint— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers. 
We'll say Good Evening, one and all, your pardon, too, 
we crave, 
We did our duty, manfully, this country for to save; 
May the Shamrock and the Stars and Stripes in triumph 
ever wave, 
4Yer the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c, 
DON'T WAKE THE BABY. 
As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
'Tis caused by proud delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
mine 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : " Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms?" She placed her finger on her lips and said, " h—s—h— 
CHORUS. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild ! 
As soon as e'er the news spread 'round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said ' what a 
darling child !" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man. 
SPOKEN.—" Why," said they, "Mr. Snooks, Hr. Snooks, you 
ought to be a 
very happy man;" " I 
am, Jam !" I 
replied, and 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
I h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, Arc. 
To-day I 
married, so was Jones, 
Who said, quite on the sly— 
" 
Who'll be a 
happy father first, 
I 
wonder, you or I?" 
Jones always thinks he's No. I, 
But to-day that bliss is mine, 
And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
I'll crack a 
case of wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, 
and I'll 
make Jones drink the darling's 
health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy, 
With a 
parent's fond affection now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow, 
But what to call the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know. 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a 
Snooks, 
And when he's christened you must come 
And see how nice he looks. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'll invite you all to attend the christening, 
but remember, h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, 86e.

O'er the bosom of the ocean, 
Shall the sea-bird cease to rove. 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E're my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee, Ice. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make.me blest, 
Be my heart thy throne for ever, 
Let all tears forgotten be; 
Weal or woe es-trange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee, &c.

leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. _
Evening _Vail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fistinn's, 93 Nas-
sau street ca led the ' Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is fnough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.' 
The N. 
Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat littis3 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opt randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit '•  the next only Columbine, then

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arringed and printed in series—Hcarts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the 17. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expre, sing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dim. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unla,dy-like encourage-
nient. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
