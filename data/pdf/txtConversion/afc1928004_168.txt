SKETCH OF MISS AGNES WALLACE. 
Whenever any person achieves distinction in Science or 
Art, there springs up ft very laudable desire to learn all 
we possibly eau about such person's previous life. 
The 
editor of one of our most justly popular journals, gives to 
the public the following facts in relation to tins most 
deserved y distinguished artiste: 
This captivating and fascinating young lady was born in Leicester, 
England, and at the age of four years performed in the principal 
London theatres, in child's parts, and created at that time a 
great 
furore for her wonderful adaptability for the stage. 
She made her 
first appearance in New York at the Broadway Theatre, then under 
the management of George Wood. Miss Agnes Wallace soon became 
a favorite, and won deserved praise in every role she undertook. 
Her mother has been on the stage since childhood. 
She has brought 
up all her girls to the profession, and they have been, thoroughly 
educated in every branch of theatrical business, and when we take 
into consideration her age, and the brilliant dramatic talent she now 
displays, it is safe to say that she has a 
great future before her. Her 
father was a 
music composer. and leader of an orchestra, in one of the 
London theatres, and died when the girls were very young. We are 
justified in saying that whenever this charming artiste with her 
sweet silvery voice, her sparkling and dashing style, and her charm-
ing ways, returns to our city she will meet with a 
hearty welcome, 
and wherever she may go the good wishes of all who have witnessed 
her excellent performances will go with them. 
She has a bright 
future before her, and will stand still higher in the ranks of her pro-
fession in wh.ch, young as she is, she shines ms a star. 
Miss Agnes 
Wallace is • the bright particular Star " of the famous " Agnes Wallace 
Troupe ;" an organization which has no equal in producing those light, 
attractive pieces, which while away so many otherwise dull hours. 
We must not forget the comedian, Sam. B. Villa, of the troupe, 
who possesses a 
fine soprano voice, and is very neat in skirts. 
Thu 
most laughable performances was the caricature or the " Girl of the 
Period"— the fair Clorinda herself—by Mr S. B. Villa. 
Tile follies 
eccentricities and " gushing" sensibilities of the dear creature— the 
excellent make up and the amusing and desperate endeavors made to 
captivate the Prince, left the audience in roars of laughter. 
The 
rest of the company are also very good in their different parts.

And handed her wine and cake; 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare, 
For such a 
darling's sake.

FIRST SHE WOULD.—ICONCLuDED.) 
She hung her head, and smiled, and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss; 
And when we parted on that night, 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss.—C.ho. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And I'd take her here and there, 
And every time I 
got a 
chance 
My passion I'd declare. 
I've vow'd to be true on the top of Saint PludIs 
On the Undergrcund rail, Richmond Hill. 
At last I 
said, " if she wouldn't wed., 
By jingo! my-solf 
kill."—Cito. 
I 
thought it was " richt," and so I 
had 
The banns put up " on spec," 
And sent my love a " sweet silk dress: 
Her darling self to deck 
Upon the wedding morn I 
Qalled, 
My intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all, and worst of all, 
She'd not made up her mind. 
Spoken--She said she thought— 
Cho.—At first she would, and then she wouldn't-
And then, somehow, she thought she couldn't, 
And then she said, " I 
really s'houldn't,s 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty nian. 
Well, after that, we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home; 
To one thing, though, my wife objects, 
That's when I 
wish to roam. 
She says that -"home's the proper place 
For all good married men," 
If I 
trot out at night I 
have 
To be in bed by ten. 
5poken—As for letting me have the latch-key— 
Cho.— Once she would, but now she wouldn't; 
I 
say " she could," she says " she c,,uldn't," 
She says, " what's more, she's sure she shouldn't," 
And I'm a 
naughty, naughty man.

DOWN AMONG THE COALS. 
My Jemitna was in service once 
At a 
house in Madisiin Square, 
She never got out and so I 
used 
To go and court her there. 
Her mistresses were two old maids, 
Such very particular souls, 
That Jemima had to (Atm hide me 
In amongst the coals. 
0110RUs.—Down among the coals, down among the coals, 
Oh, by Jove it was a 
lark, all alone and in the dark, 
Down among the coals, down among the coals, 
Waiting to make love to my Jemima. 
When in that cellar, cobwebs used 
To decorate my clothes, 
The coal-dust got into my eyes, 
And would get up my nose; 
And when it rai ' d 
the water came 
A 
trickling through a 
crack, 
And I 
always fancied spiders were 
A crawling down my back. 
Down among the coals, itc. 
One night they sent Jemima out, 
Who'd forgotten her dear Joe 
Was down among the Wallsends 
And a 
prisoner below. 
I 
began to freeze, was obliged t sneeze 
And felt inclined to shout, 
At last call'd thro' the keyhole, 
"Here Jemima let's get out." 
Down among the coals, &c. 
At last the door was opened, 
'Twas dark, oh blest of bliss, 
I 
threw my arms 'around her neck, 
And gave her such a 
kiss.

THE OLD MAWS DRUNK AGAIN.

L. 
PETEES, NOW York:\ 
Price 35 cents. 
You've no doubt heard the song, 
" 
Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
how the old man used to " 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone.' 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again./ 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more ; 
But then he would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say.-1 
"The old man's drunk again." 
I. We've given him up for gone, &c.• 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
Aud drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed ; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, & C. 
" 
0 ! Father. dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow • 
You've drank away the bed's 
and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow ; 
0! don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go for you," 
When you get drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, &e.

She makes me do the household won. 
When I 
come home at night; 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
With rage she'll storm I 
vow, 
And if I 
snore too bard for her, 
Why there's bound to be a 
row: 
Cho.—There's bound, Er.e. 
She wakes me every morning, 
In an awful cruel way, 
She kicks me round about the room, 
Yet not a 
sentence dare I 
say; 
I 
have to wash my stocking; 
Isty fronts and shirts, I 
vow, 
And if I 
don't wash for her as well 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, ie. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her every farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek 
To give me two pence for myself, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, dan. 
When we had neither girl nor boy, 
She cast on me the blame; 
Now that we've five little ones, 
She grumbles just the same; 
But I 
no longer must be stopping, 
So at once I'll make my bow, 
For if my old woman should but pop in, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, dre.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.

once I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole in it. 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore, 
Oh I 
where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door. 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.--[CoNoLunro. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his `bacca,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my I 
how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' l'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &O. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken—At the end, of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what ' tanning' was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded 
I 
should never see my love, dro. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few short years ago. 
All sorts of weather, hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
cnottus. 
Oh. mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't 
Oh, George. please, George, not just yet awhile; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't I 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I `• waiting" Rept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upou my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed l" 
I 
longed to bear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well. George, dear, you're very kind, but we could never 
live 1.n two hundred a 
year, so until you are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &c. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year.. 
At last I 
really earned ; 
Selina heard how things had chan ,4ed, 
And when we met me day, 
Sbe seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say— 
Spoken—Yon remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you asked 
tne some time ago.—well, George, cear, as you have so improved 
circ,urnstances, suppose you ask Ille now, Georgy, Porgey, darling t 
eh. what say? 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & c. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves him for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dress. 
May they be old niaids till they die, 
And we'll never feel their loss— 
Spoken— So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you. don't

And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a

Perhars she's up in a

Perliaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on time sea ; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a

She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to

She said he was a

I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day, 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
It she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash ; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound.

As blithe as blithe can be, 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me;

With working in the vein, 
Arid like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I

Amid the fire and damp may strike 
And fling his darts at me.

How little do the great ones *are 
Who sit at home secure, 
What hidden dan..ers colliers dare— 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives.

Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can, 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a

However fortune turns about 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lade that look for coals.

happy day, full well, full well, I

She vowed that she'd be true to me 
Down in the valley whele the daisies grow, 
The daisies oh ! the daisies oh ! 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow ; 
It was a 
happy day, full well I 
know, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow. 
woo'd her in the valley where the daisies grow, 
And where beside a 
streamlet the water- lilies blow; 
It was a 
happy moment when first she let rue know 
She Iov'd me in the valley where the daisies grow,

joy to me, my heart was full of glee, 
When she agreed my loving bride to be, 
And vow`d that she'd be true to me,

Down in the valley where the daisies grow;

sweeter far than moon or star, Whilst court-ing in the rain. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A farmer's daughter! well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
Spoken.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer's daughter, what could be 
better; I 
wish'd the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &c. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again some other day.

can't exactly decide, you roust ask my pit. Eo 
I

His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane.

JUST THE THING FOR FRANK. 
Written and Composed by J. 
BATC HELDER. 
Sung with immense success by ARTHUR LLOYD. 
While walking out, the other night, I 
heard a 
jolly song, 
That induced me to sit down, and try to write one right or 
wrong; 
The one I 
heard, was meant to quizz a 
respected friend I 
know, 
' 
Who in a 
most nonchalant style, Sings, " No, no, Not for 
Joe." 
Spoken.—A capital song too, and the incomparable style in 
which my friend Baxter expresses his negatives in such a 
posi-
tive manner, has induced me to reply in the following a.ffirraa-
tive Chorus: 
CHORUS. 
A pretty little wife, as a partner for life, 
And a 
thousand or two in the Bank: 
With a 
good friend too who is honest and true, 
That's just the thing for Frank. 
The fellows wondered how it was that I 
got on so well, 
The many hearts I 
caused to break, ' tis impossible to tell; 
To enumerate my lady loves would gain for me a 
thank. 
And %would be breach of confidence, and not the thing for 
Frank. 
Spoken.—Decidedly not, any fellow guilty of such an in-
discretion, would never be worthy of— 
A pretty, etc. 
When I 
was single, 'pon my word, my friends did all de-
cl are, 
That, at making love to pretty girls, Frank Fair-face was 
all there." 
To stately dames I've whispered low, till in my arms they've 
sank. 
An interesting picture, eh ? and just the thing for Frauk. 
/UST THE THING FOR FRANK.—[coNcLuDED1 
Spoken.—Decidedly interesting pro tern, but nothing to the 
delights experienced with, 
A pretty, etc. 
But now I'm married and done for, I'll propose a 
toast for 
all, 
And although an old one, still I 
know you'll answer at my 
call: 
" 
May the single, all get married, and the married, happy 
be" ; 
And them with right good will, you'll all, this chorus sing 
with me. 
Of worldly goods I 
have my 
For I'm a 
friend to any nt-n, 
So in the lottery of this life, 
But to see you all as gay as 
Frank. 
A happy, etc. 
share, and am jolly as can be, 
who friendly acts to me. 
may you never draw a 
blank, 
myself, is just the thing for 
Spoken.—Just the very thing for Frank, for what can be 
more pleasant, than to see those around you happy, especially 
when you have the gratification of knowing that in some 
slight degree you have contributed towards that happiness. 
I 
hope some day to be personally acquainted with every one 
of you; I 
hope some day I 
shall receive an in-itation to visit 
every one of you, and I 
trust that when I 
do have that please 
tire, that every one of you will be possessed of— 
A happy. ete.

UP IN THE NEORINION LAND. 
Some like to spend their leisure time, 
At Long Branch, or Cape May ; 
Some ruralize at West Point, 
And some like at home to stay. 
But wheu I 
have a 
week to spare, 
I 
spend it out of hand ; 
I 
take my sweetheart and we go 
Up to the Mormon land. 
CHORUS. 
Up in the Mormon land, folks are not so shy, 
Up in the Mormon land, how is that for high, 
Up in the Mormon land, a 
matrimonial band, 
The easy place for courting is the Mormon land 
The rules of strict society, 
Are not to Mormon taste, 
And if I'm so disposed 1 
put, 
My arm around her waist. 
Up in the Mormon land, ctc. 
Their notions of morality 
Are not so very grand; 
. 
And so they do just what they please, 
Within the Mormon land. 
Up in the Mormon land, folks are not shy, 
Up .in the Mormon land, how is that for high, 
Up in the Mormon land, a 
matrimonial band, 
The easy place for courting is the Mormon land !

sung by the GREAT LINGARD• 
Oh I'm a 
girl that's fond of life, 
My age is twenty-one, 
1 
am averse to noise and strife, 
But very fond of fun; 
And though to vice I'm not inalin'cl, 
'I like the flattery of mankind, 
And always like to speak my mind, 
Alike to every one. 
CHORUS. 
For as through the park I 
go, 
The gents al) ‘vant to know, 
Who is that darling girl that drives so fE 
They 'd 
like to know. 
I 
live at home with dear mam-rno, 
And do jtkst as I 
will, 
While lovers come from near and far, 
And me with nonsense fill; 
But I 
tell them all, I'll be a 
nun, 
And beg they will at once have clone, 
But then they say, Pm only in fun, 
As I 
laugh behind my fan. 
Spoken.—Well, of course 1 
am in fun sometimes. 'Twee 
rrnly the other evening, ream-ma took me to a 
ball, and bought 
Tee this new dress from Madame Wintle for the oeaasion, for 
main-ma said, I 
must put on ray best smiles and graces, for 1 
was getting rather old and it was quite time I 
was off her 
hands. 
Poor main-ma! she always has my interest at heart. 
So after the Ball was over one dear young fellow began to ad-
dress me, and I 
really thought he was going to propose, but 
another gent came in and spoiled it all, and I've many times 
heard them both remark—

As through the park 1

LITTLE DICKEY BIRDS. 
AIR:—" Bold Fisherman." 
Written and composed by JOHN STETSON, expressly for the Burlesque 
of "ROBIN H OOD." 
Oh, I 
woke one tine morning 
And sallied forth for some sport, 
To catch the little feathered tribe, 
The truth I 
must tell. 
But when I 
arrove at Pimlico 
The wind it did begin to blow 
I 
struck a 
big brier in my toe, 
And into the Nvater I 
tell. 
Chant. — Into the bogs among the frogs, and the tittle-
bats and the brickbats, and the mosquitos bit me on the 
nose ; then I 
arose with dirty clothes and bleeding nose ; 
I 
thought I 
heard my foe singing— 
morms. 
Little Dickey Birds, little Dickey Birds, 
Who the dickens thought they were such a 
bore ; 
Little Dickey Birds, little Dicky Birds, 
Such a 
pest I 
never saw. 
First I 
wriggled, then I 
striggled, 
In the water to shiny, 
I 
bellowed and I 
yaowed 
Out tor help, but in vain : 
Then down did I 
gently glide 
And floated with the silvery tide, 
But previously to that I 
cried, 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
Chant. — On arriving at the terra firma at the bottom 
a 
qua para, 1 
wratig my clothes out to dry ; a 
herd of mos-
quitos tackled my nasal organ, which caused the ruby to 
flow freely from my lobster colored proboscis, and I 
never 
shall forget the day I 
went looking tor 
Little Dickey Birds! St-,e. 
My ghost walked that night 
To the bed-side of Mary Jane, 
I 
told her how dead I 
was, 
" 
Then," says she " f11 go mad." 
" 
For, since my love's dead," says she, 
" 
All joy for me's fled," says she 
" 
go a 
raying tuniack," says she 
And she went very bad. 
- 
Chant.—  After she had torn her waterfall to smithereens 
and bit a 
big chunk out. of the bed-post, knocked out 
several of her false teeth, I woke her out of her quiet 
slumbers, and promised her that never again would I 
go 
in search of 
Little Dickey Birds, SEe. 
MY LOVE'S GONE AWAY.

Oh! the bold 
Fish - or - m-tn. 
First he wriggled, then he striggled, 
In the water so briny; 
He bellowed, and he yellowed 
Out for help, but in vain; 
Then down did he gently glide, 
To the bottom of the sily'ry tide, 
But previously to that he cried, 
" 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
CHANT-On arriving at the terra firma, at the bottom of the 
'qua pura, he took a 
cough losenge, and murmured--
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the refrain of the gentle song he sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
Said the bold fisherman. 
His ghost walked that night 
To the bedside of his Mary Jane, 
lie told her how dead he was; 
Then says she, " I'll go mad." 
"For since my love's dead," says she, 
" 
All joy from me's fled," says she, 
" 
I'll go a 
raving luniack," says she, 
And she went, very bad. 
CHANT-She thereupon tore her best chignon to smithereens, 
danced the " Can-can" on top of the water- butt, and joined " the, 
woman's rights association," and frequently edifies the angelic 
members by softly chanting 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the kind of soul-inspiring song she sung, 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
Oh! the bold fisherman.

Won't you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me. 
0! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
CHORUS. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest., dearest, 
Look up. darling, tell me this ; 
Do you love me, Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mystic veil of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light. 
01 no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling. 
When they hear me call. your name. 
Mollie, fairest, itie. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
'rho' the parting gives me pain ; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
l 
will meet you here again. 
0! good-night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one, 
Happy may.you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
Mollie, fairest. iske-
DON'T GO, MOLLIE DARLING. 
Words by FRA-NIC D UMONT. 
Music by J. I
IENRY Wurr.m0aw. 
Oh! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious and time will not wait, 
Oh ! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Off to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
"We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh I 
listen to me. 
Oh ! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh ! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days \viten I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &e. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear ot advice, Mre 
dear, 
But all ! many evils will lurk at yam side ; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days are but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go— 
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you' 
; 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c.

WHEN I 
HEAR MY LOVE KNOCK AT THE DOOR 
I've a 
beau you must know, who it is I'll not tell, 
So don't ask, for you'll get no reply ; 
A dear dashing fellow, altho' not a 
swe:l, 
For swells I've no fancy, not I, 
lie's a 
troe gentleman, and that is a 
rank 
Above titles, which sonic girls adore ; 
Ah, how my heart beats when I 
hear my dear Frank, 
Give his darling rat-a- tat-at at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how my heart beats whenever I 
hear, 
His rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, 
No music's so sweet, with joy my heart beats 
When 1 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pie- mile we met, one bright summer's day. 
A day I 
ne'er shall forget ; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods, and somehow lost our way 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet : 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
And of it may he ne'er be bereft, 
After all we've concluded ' tis but an exchange, 
And ' tis said that exchange is no theft. 
Oh, how my heart beats, ffce. 
He has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down ; 
He has vow'd to be mine, in fact we both vow'd, 
Each other to love evermore; 
Ah ! where's there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, etc.

THE BROKEN-HEARTED BELLE. 
Axe.—" The Broken- Hearted Shepherd.' 
Would I could discover 
A really constant lover, 
My Harry's only halt and half, 
And nothing-, will he say 
Except 
Pop goes the weasel,' 
As he paints at his easel ; 
But, weasel-like, no question pops, 
Although I'd name the day-
C110 It US. 
Oh ! Barry, Oh! Harry, 
You're the man I'd like to marry 
Oh! Harry, Oh ! Harry, 
If you'd propose I'd not say " No!" 
Ride a 
bobby horse 
Off to Bamb'ry Cross, 
To see a girl, 
all rings and bells. 
Upon a snow-white horse. 
I'd like to be that lady 
When he a visit paid, he. 
Amongst that lot of bells and rings, 
Might ring this belle, of course, 
Oh! Harry, Oh; Harry, dm 
Little Jackey Horner 
Sat up in a corner. 
Palling plums with both his thumbs, 
Out of a Christmas pie; 
And silently I'm brooding, 
As a 
plum in pudding 
But Harry never takes me out, 
But quietly passes by. 
Oh! Harry, Oh Harry Le. 
Then there's Jack and Jill, too, 
They went up a bill, too; 
Jack fell down and broke his crown, 
And cans'd a great to-do, 
I'm sure that if that Harry 
Does not propose to marry, 
I 
shall fall down and break my heart— 
But that's ' twist n.e and you. 
Oh I 
Harry, Oh! Harry, Ste. 
Baby Baby B:inting, 
Mother's gone out hunting, 
I 
too will hunt both high and low, 
To gain him won't despair ; 
And more, I'll give up sighing ; 
Perhaps at the fair he's buying 
di splendid bunch of ribbons blue 
To tie up my bonny brown hair. 
Oh! Harry, ! Harry, deo.

ON THE PARADE.—[CoNcLuDits.] 
Now some like the jettys, 
And some like the piers, 
Infested by nurse-maids, 
And infants—" sweet dears"— 
And some climb the heights, 
But as I 
arn afraid 
Of too much exertion 
I 
keep the Parade. 
Spoken.—If a 
fella goes up a 
hill, he has to come down again 
sonic time or other. 
If a 
fella does the Beach, it's all"now for 
rowing," or " now for sailing," 
fresh baked shrimps," and fresh 
boiled buns," and such like confounded bores so I 
keep— 
On the Parade, Ltc. 
Now some like the sands, 
Some rude fellas there be, 
Who quiz the fair charmers, 
Who bathe in the sea. 
Some " go in" for sailing, 
But of that I'm afraid; 
I 
feel so much safer 
When on the Parade. 
Spoken.—A "sail in a 
pleasure-boat," pleasure—oh, excuse me I 
when a 
fella's on shore he knows where he is, but when a 
fella's 
in a 
pleasure (?) boat, he don't know where he is, and feels as if 
be didn't care where be went to; so I 
feel more " at home."— 
On the Parade, dr.c. 
'Tis upon the Parade, 
When the sun's going down, 
One meets with the fairest 
Elite of the town. 
There's one charmer I'd " pop " to, 
But feel most afraid, 
She's the fairest and richest 
Upon the Parade. 
Spokeiz.—Beautiful creature! daughter of an Indian banker— 
nandsome girl—with an ugly old governor—the old buffer has a 
gambooge complexion, and a 
voice like a 
cracked trombone—does 
the Bath chair- business. Should" the go€1.3 smile upon my" wooing, 
by Jove, I'll live and die—

Oh, don't you remember the pleasant old meadows, 
Where we in our childhood delighted to stray; 
Where we gathered the cowslips, and chased' our own shadows-, 
Or sat down to rest on the sweet scented bay ? 
Don't you remember, love ? don't you remember ? 
Oh, don't you remember the merry May-blossoms, 
That your loving hands twined in my long flowing hair; 
And the path through the woodlands, with primroses bordered, 
Where you told of brave knights, who defended the fair ? 
Don't you remember, love ? don't you remember ? 
Oh, don't you r 
member the vine-covered cottage, 
And the small wicket gate, 'neath the moon's gentle rays; 
Where we vowel to love truly, till death us should sever, 
And to live for each other the rest of our days ? 
Don't you remember, love ? don't you remember? 
Oh, don't you remember the village bells ringing, 
As you brought me away to your snug little cot, 
Where the children's sweet voices recall, as I'm singing, 
The joys that are past, but can ne'er be forgot ? 
Don't you remember, love 
don't you remember ?

Sing oh, for a 
brave and gallant bark, 
And a 
brisk and lively breeze; 
A 
little crew and a 
captain too, 
To carry me over the seas; 
ro carry we over the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay, 
She has taken a 
trip on a 
government ship, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
7noyus. -- So blow the winds I 
oh, a 
roving I 
will go, 
stay no more on Manhattan shore, 
So ;
ct the music play ; 
tart by the morning train, to cross the raging main, 
For* Um on the move to my own true love, 
'en thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue, my i.oys, 
But while I 
sing this lay, 
She is doing the grand in the distant land, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, ens. 
Oh I 
that was a 
dark and dismal day, 
When last she left the strand, 
She bid good bye with a 
tearful eye, 
And waved her lilly hand; 
She waved her lilly hand, my boys, 
As the big ship left the bay, 
And says she, remember me, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Oh I 
if I 
could but be a 
bos'n bold, 
Or only a 
born-ba-dier: 
I'd hire a 
boat, and hurry afloat, 
And straight to my true love steer. 
And straight to my true love steer, my boys, 
Where the dancing dolphins play, 
And the whales and the sharks are having their lark; 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, eta, 
Oh ! the sun may shine thro' a 
Winter fog,

MY POOR HEART IS SAD, WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
Words and Music by T. BRIGHAM Bisnor. 
The Music of this song is Published by J. L. PETErts, 594 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 35 Cents. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away; 
They say that young love's like the flower, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine it was snateli'd from its bower, 
And I 
never gain'd one in return, 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
For it brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has all pass'd away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that were all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you of its treasure, 
And you seem'd to love none but me; 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet Ill never, 
One unkind word to thee give, 
For your cherish'd memory ever, 
Shall be my sole joy while I 
live. 
My poor heart, (U. 
MY LOVE SHE LOVES ME NOT. 
Written and Composed by G. W. HUNT. 
I've loved a 
girl so deep and long, 
That of sense I 
ant bereft; 
I've made her heaps of presents, till 
I've scarce a 
penny left ; 
I 
tell her how I 
love her, and 
I 
pitch it jolly hot, 
But strange to say, unto this day, 
My love she loves me not. 
CHORUS. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, 
And water boiling het, 
If my love would only love me ; but 
My love she loves me not. 
I've taken her to parties, 
I've taken her to balls, 
I've taken her on the Elevated Rail, 
And up to the top of St. nulls'; 
The Chamber of Horrors at the Museum, 
And such cheering sights a 
lot; 
I've showed her Fulton Market, yes, 
But still she loves me not. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, tte. 
I've learnt to act like Kemble, 
My lady- love to please, 
I 
swear in solemn tragic tones, 
And flop down on my knees. 
I 
sing " Die Wacht am Rhein" to her, 
Awl of other songs a 
lot; 
I've learnt to play the cheerful flute, 
But still she loves me not. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, tibc. 
Why Is she so caiztankerouse, 
Why 
is she so unkind? 
Why is she so obstropelouse ? 
Why smash illy piece of mind ? 
If she'd love me a 
little, 
I'd do I 
don't know what, 
For her l'd live on Australian'beef, 
But, alas, she loves me not. 
'7;-
)r her I'd go thro' fire, 4e.

I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and lands in the country,

For money well spent brings joys, 
Yes, money was made to spend.

Suffice me to say that at night 
We dance, we sing, and we play; 
We " Upper Ten," with hearts so light, 
Thus merrily while time away.

While valking in dot viten, 
Viewing pretty flowers,

PARODY ON MOLLY DARLING. 
I 
met Molly in the garden. 
I 
believe ' twas after tea, 
She had on her Dolly Varden, 
She completely dazzled me; 
Oh, tell me, darling, that you love me, 
She gave my little hand a 
squoze. 
Take my greenbacks, Molly darling, 
Don't turn up to me your nose. 
CHORUS. 
Molly, fattest, fairest, hugest, 
Look up, darling, tell me that 
You still love me, Molly darling, 
Don't despise me 'cause I'm fat 
When ,‘ e're married, Molly darling, 
And you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing tag around the house ; 
You must give them paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
Should they annoy you, Molly darling, 
gently put on them a 
head. 
Molly, fatigest• gte.

MAN IS BUT A PIPE AND HIS LIFE IS BUT 
SMOKE. 
• 
Contented I 
sit with my pipe and my glass, 
Puffing sorrow and care far away, 
Though liquor may banish man's reason afar, 
He's only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
While his sense and his reason are always at war. 
He don't know when enough he has got. 
cricutuS. 
1 
Though many may laugh, others may joke, 
Man's but a 
pipe and his life is but smoke. 
Now man and a 
pipe are much nearer to kin, 
Than ever you have understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are they good ; 
For the one and the other's eontposed of clay, 
And if right I 
tell nature's plan, 
It takes but the breath from them both right away, 
The pipe dies and so (loth the man. 
Though many may, &c. 
Now Pm told by my pipe man's lot is to die, 
For sooner or later he must, 
And when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a pipe that's smoked out he's but dust; 
Then all you that wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not grief, strife nor sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day. 
For you may be smoked out on the morrow. 
Though many may, &C. 
BOB BAKER. 
Written by G. W. HUNT. 
Composed by ARTHUR LLOYD. 
There once lived Bob Baker, by trade a 
shoemaker; 
Whose trade flourished most in wet weather—hether; 
The boys call'd him snob, which quite enraged Bob, 
As he hammered away at his leather—hether ; 
There lived over the way, a 
girl I've beard say, 
And after her Bob he would dangle—angle; 
She had oh ! what a 
mug, her nose was a 
pug, 
She existed by turning a 
mangle—jangle, bangle, tangle, triangle 
CHORUS. 
Singing rum ti turn turn, also toodle turn tay, 
In addition to fol de rol liddy, 
With la la la la and all! ab ah! ah! 
In conclusion, ti titty turn tiddy. 
Now one night from affright, Bob in bcd jumped upright, 
By his side sure a 
ghost to discover— cover ; 
Said the ghost, " List, I 
say, be warned while you may, 
For Miss Polly she loveth another— other." 
Bob be started with surprise, lie could scarce believe his eyes, 
His heart it now felt quite a 
melter—skelter ; 
He fell out on the floor, and he then and there swore, 
That he'd go in the morning and welt ber—pelter, jelt er, lusher 
Singing rum ti turn turn, &e. 
With grief Bobby wept, as he to her house crept, 
When who should be see but her cousin— ousin ; 
It was no fault of hern, he w 
as doing a 
turn 
At the rate of three ba'perice a 
dozen—ozen; 
Now the snob with an oath, he rushed upon both, 
With his lapstone lie soon floored the cousin—ousin ; 
Then be drew forth his awl, tl at he'd brought from his stall, 
And with it stabbed Poll in the buzzun 
zzi ni, cuzzum, duzznyn 
Singing rum ti turn turn, & c. 
When he found ern' both dead, Baby blubber'd and said, 
Oh! sweet Poll, heie's an end to your mangling— angling ;" 
Then he ran off home fast, hung himself to his " last," 
For in the morning they found him a 
dangling—dangling. 
So, of the nightmare, I 
pray you'll take care, 
'Cos You See how this ended in murther—urther; 
Now I've not kept you long. so I'll now end may song, 
For I've nothing to say any further—fui flu r, tnifber rurther.

OCTOROON. 
As I 
was roving down the street, 
The other afternoon, 
While crossing of a 
walk I 
met 
A pretty Octoroon. 
She glanced at me so slyly, 
As she was passing by, 
I 
never shall forget that 
Darling roguish little eye. 
I 
turned around to look at her, 
And others did the same, 
She was so much attraction, 
That they worn% much to blame. 
She was iitressed in height of fashion, 
High-heeled boots and musharoon, 
She looked so gay my heart went with 
This pretty Octoroon. 
The other day as I 
walked in 
To an ice-cream saloon, 
I 
got an introduction to 
This pretty Octoroon. 
We chatted there quite sociably, 
Until it , 
got quite late, 
She took my arm, we walked along, 
Until we reached the gate. 
She asked if I'd call on her, 
Of course I 
did consent 
She pressed her parting lips to mine, 
And in the house she went. 
I 
never shall forget that kiss, 
At least not very soon, 
She kissed so sweet I 
taste it yet, 
Dat pretty Octoroon. 
The other day I 
called on her, 
A 
little while to stay. 
I 
found her pa and ma were home, 
I 
wished them far away. 
Her pa said, " Who are you, sir r 
And he grabbed me by the coat, 
Said I, " I 
am head steward on 
A Coney Island boat." 
He ordered me to leave the house, 
Which I 
did without delay, 
The gal she said she'd meet me 
Where we met the other day. 
So, white folks, please excuse me, 
For leaving you so soon, 
I'm going round the block to meet 
My pretty Octoroon.

I 
joined the ranks so martial, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though to " Reviews" I'm partial, 
No " rifle-butt" I'll be. 
At " small sword exercise" I'm great, 
Although perhaps you'll smile, 
I 
do the " goose-step" like a " duck," 
In military style. 
Chorus.-How do you like, &c. 
To " sham fights" I'm devoted, 
And always " gain the day;" 
I'm sure to be promoted 
For " merit" not for " pay." 
I've read the deeds of" Wellington," 
But in a 
little while, 
I 
fancy I 
shall " cut him out" 
In military style. 
Chorus.-How do you like, &c. 
And when there's warfare raging, 
There often is, no doubt, 
With manners so engaging, 
I'll put the foe to rout; 
I'll storm the trenches, scale the walla, 
The enemy I'll

And if I'm beat-I'll run away 
In military style.

OH YES! I'VE SEEN 'HIM LATELY. 
AIR :—' I haven't seen him lately." 
Words by H. J. 1VFIYMARK. 
Some time ago, I 
lost my bean, 
To you the fact did mention, 
But Mr. Green once more I've seen, 
So give me your attention. 
His face was bare and shorn of hair, 
He was not dress'd so neatly, 
This man untrue, I 
scarcely knew, 
He was transform'd completely. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis true, I've seen this Mr. Green, 
But he was alter'd greatly, 
In " durance vile" he waits his trial, 
Oh yes 1 
I've seen him lately I 
The Daly News I 
did peruse, 
When breakfasting one morning, 
And saw the name of this young " flame" 
The police-sheet adorning. 
It startled me, I 
knew 'twas he, 
With him it well accorded, 
I 
laughed with glee, so pleas'd to see 
His perfidy rewarded. 
'Tis true, I've seen this Mr. Green. 
But he was alter'd greatly, 
In " durance vile " he waits his trial, 
Oh! I've seen him lately ! 
'Mils thus it ran, "A 
tall young man, 
Who felt his strange position, 
Was yesterday, by policeman A, 
Arrested on suspicion. 
[1] 
id 
OH YES ! I'VE SEEN, &O.,— CONCLUDED. 
Complexion fair, light curly hair, 
And only six-and-twenty, 
A ' Court-Guide,' bound, on him was found, 
And duplicates ill plenty! 
'Tis true. I've seen this Mr. Green. 
But he was alter'd greatly, 
In " durance vile" he waits his trial, 
Oh I 
I've seen him lately! 
44 
Each duplicate, or jewels and plate 
That was in his possession, 
Was wrongly gained, by frauds obtain'd, 
Upon his own confession. 
Some were for rings and other things, 
Gold watch, gold chain, or locket, 
A 
monstrous pair of whiskers, fair, 
Were found in his coat pocket?' 
'Tis true, I've seen this Mr. Green. 
But he was alter'd greatly, 
In " durance vile" he waits his trial, 
Oh ! I've seen him lately l 
This " fickle lad" fresh victims had, 
Each time he was remanded. 
In prison van, this tall young man, 
Was by policeman handed. 
I 
caught a 
glance of him, by chance, 
He'd lost his gait so stately, 
And, without doubt, when he comes out, 
He will be altered greatly 
'Tis true, I've seen this Mr. Green. 
But he was alter'd greatly, 
In " 
durance vile" he waits his trial, 
Oh I 
I've seen him lately

THE IRISH CURE. 
They call me Kitty Connor, 
A laughing girl am I, 
But to get an honest living, 
Through Dublin streets I 
cry, 
The fruits of all the seasons round, 
Whether hot or cold, 
By the merry Irish cure, 
Are daily bought and sold. 
But I 
cannot tell why I'm sure, 
They call me the Irish cure, 
But the gents wink and grin, 
Touch me under the chin, 
And call me the Irish cure. 
I 
deal in garden stuff and fruits, 
With fish I 
spend my hours, 
Such as rabbits, chickens, eggs and roots, 
Crabs and cauliflowers, 
No matter what the seasons are, 
I've something worth their buying, 
And ' tho I'm laughing near and far, 
For other folks good I'm crying. 
But I 
cannot tell why I'm sure, 
They call me an Irish cure, 
But the gents wink and grin, 
Touch me under the chin, 
And call me an Irish cure. 
There's Barney Lary courted me, 
A twelvemonth and a 
day, 
But he never once supported me, 
For all his work is play ; 
He spent the wages he'd not got, 
And so badly was behaving, 
His brass and coppers went to pot 
He at the pot- house spent his savings. 
Why 
he'd call me an Irish cure. 
I 
never could tell I 
am sure. 
But the gents with a 
grin, 
Chuck me under the chin, 
Saying there's a 
sweet Irish cure.

THE SWEETET OF THE SWEET. 
Words by HARRY BLOODGOOD.

Music by A. H. IrguNALD. 
As I 
walked out one morning, 
The sun was shining bright, 
And for a 
time I 
felt my eyes 
Were dazzled by its light. 
When just as I 
was going 
To step across the street. 
I 
met a 
charming creature? 
The sweetest of the sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh her eyes were bright, 
Her step was light, 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet; 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet. 
I 
said, Oh charming creature, 
Will you accept my arm ; 
I'll see you safe across the street. 
She looked up in alarm ; 
Young man, she said, and then she smiled, 
Oh, lor, ' was such a 
treat, 
ne'er forget the look she gave, 
"rwas sweetest of the sweet. 
Oh her, & c. 
Ere many weeks had passed away, 
I 
took her for my bride, 
And now she is my only joy. 
My beauty and my pride.; 
And as I 
walk with her along 
The busy crowded street, 
I 
feel my wife most surely is 
t_ The sweetest of the sweet. 
Oh her, ttc.-
