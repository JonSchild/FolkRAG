Transcript of Interview with Samantha Adams, August 3, 2020 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:00:01): 
Okay. So I'm here. This is Ethan Sharp. I'm here with Samantha Adams. We are at Voices of Hope in 
Lexington. It is August 3rd. And to get us started Samantha--do you go by Sam? 
Samantha (00:00:19): 
I do. 
Ethan (00:00:19): 
Could you start with telling us a little bit about yourself, where you were born, where you, where you 
grew up, maybe where you went to school? 
Samantha (00:00:28): 
Okay. I was actually born in Memphis, Tennessee. My mother and father are both from Western 
Kentucky, but they met there, and that is where I was born. What I have come to find out through my 
journey of recovery is my father was a drug dealer. And basically when I came along, my mom decided 
to move back to where she was from in Paducah, Kentucky, because she did not want to raise me in that 
lifestyle. Things were getting broken into cars, windows busted out, things like that. So she moved back 
home. She married the guy who raised me when I was about two. He owned a construction company. I 
lived a very privileged, I didn't want for anything when I was younger. I had some step siblings that we 
got, they were all boys, so we just played outside a lot. So if I wanted it, I got it. There was no, we went 
to church three times a week, all of that good stuff. My parents ran the Sunday school. So I grew up in 
church. I went to church camp every summer up until my senior year of high school. Always made good 
grades. I partied a little bit in high school, but not too much. Just, I didn't smoke cigarettes or anything 
like that until after high school. I went to a community college in Paducah for the first two years, which 
is like West Kentucky Community and Technical College. And so I lived at home during those times. Right 
around then is when I started meeting more people in the county that I didn't go to school with. The 
county was still separated into three high schools at the time, so you kind of stayed with your high 
school for the most part. 
Samantha (00:02:04): 
So I started meeting people, started going out under age with a fake ID. Looking back, I see that I was 
probably the one that drank the most, stayed up the latest things like that, but it wasn't really a 
problem. It was just like a weekend thing. And I still went to school, and I worked in an attorney's office 
while I was doing that. So that was kind of my weekends. And I worked at the attorney's office through 
the week. And then when I was done with those two years, I decided to go to Murray State, which is 
very close to Paducah. So I wouldn't be too far from home. And that is when I guess I realized--well, I 
didn't realize I had a problem--but I had to move back home as a result. Like I said, I've lived a pretty 
privileged life. So whenever I moved to Murray, my dad had got me a new car, and my parents paid up 
or gave me money in my account for six months’ worth of rent and utilities. And then my dad put 
enough money in my account to make the payments and insurance on the car as well. So I had a pretty 
big lump sum of money in my account to start the year. I've never been good with money. I was waiting 
tables for the first time ever in a college town at a bar that was very popular there, where everyone 
2 
 
went on certain nights. That's kinda when I started dabbling with the pills, uppers, and painkillers as a 
waitress. They were right there in the kitchen. I had cash on hand, and I would get them pretty much 
every shift, you know. I felt like it made me work better. 
Samantha (00:03:32): 
So needless to say, I was introduced to cocaine as well. And I blew through the money in just a couple of 
months. And so like the third month when my roommate asked for the rent, I didn't have it. And she 
actually called my mother and said that she thought that there was some sort of a problem. So my mom 
actually called and said that I had 45 minutes to get home. And she had a drug test on the counter 
whenever I got home. Needless to say, I moved home. My parents had to cover the rest of the lease for 
my roommate cause they didn't want her to be out. So they had to continue to pay my half for that. I did 
get a job. My mom's a pretty prominent realtor in Paducah, so she knows a lot of people. So I got a job 
there. 
Samantha (00:04:18): 
And I kinda went back to how it was when I was living at home in college. I partied on the weekends, 
and that was pretty much it. I was still recreationally doing drugs, but I don't think she was as 
concerned, because she saw me going to work through the week. So I just kind of started living that 
lifestyle. Like I said, that would have been 2006. And that was my life. I partied on the weekends and 
worked through the week. I even started working at a doctor's office as a receptionist. I got pregnant 
with my first child in 2010. Definitely wasn't doing any drugs, drinking, smoking, none of that through, 
through the pregnancy. I had him in 2011. His father and I split up when he was 18 months old and I 
kinda went back to the lifestyle of--we had 50, 50 custody--so half the time I was super mom, and half 
the time I was going out partying with my friends. And it stayed like that for a long time until I met my 
daughter's father. And on July 4th, 2014, I'm not going to say that it's his fault. However, I always had, 
my favorite thing to do if I could was any type of opiate painkiller. And once he kind of, it only took a 
couple of weeks for him to find out that I liked those, and he kinda just started feeding my habit. Come 
to find out, I know why. It's because he was already in that habit himself. And knowing what I know 
now, I think that it made him feel better to know I was doing it too. So it was kind of to the point where 
he would give me a couple to take with me to work. 
Samantha (00:05:54): 
And then it just gradually increased from a couple of day to at the end of my addiction, 30 a day. So I 
was spending about $300 a day on painkillers. He--that was our life. I mean, it was just insane. He was 
dealing enough to support my habit and all of those things that came with it. I used through that entire 
pregnancy. So when she came, she was obviously positive. And so was I. I did not seek any medical 
treatment during pregnancy. I did not see an OB GYN. I lied to my family. I was so scared of them 
knowing I was using. I know now I could have asked the doctor for help, but then I was just too scared. 
So I just continued to use. I did slack off towards the end cause I knew it was getting time for her to 
come. So I was only taking a few a day instead of 30 a day. I think it's the only thing that saved me. They 
did take her on day two saying she was exhibiting withdrawal symptoms and put her in the NICU for a 
night. I can only explain it as an act of God. She did not have to be administered any morphine or 
anything like that. And she was back in my care. CPS came in and asked me if I had a problem, and I just 
told them, "No, that I had been in pain for a few days. So I was taking a couple a day." And they believed 
me because she didn't have to be administered any medicine, and she was cleared out of the NICU. So I 
think they believed me because of that. They weren't even giving me pain pills in the hospital. They were 
giving me Tylenol three, but they sent me home with Percocets. So that was a little confusing to me, 
3 
 
especially after I had seen CPS and felt like I was somewhat in trouble. So then I just went back to what I 
was doing. She was born in September. And that's when it got the worst was after her birth until her 
father got locked up in April of 2017, or no, 16. And like I said, he had done it all. He gave me what I 
needed every day, and I went about my way. So I wasn't doing any of the wheeling and dealing and 
figuring it out. So when he got arrested, I then had to figure it out because I was sick. So from that April 
to July, the 1st of July, is when I started stealing from my job, my parents, my grandparents' pills and her 
cabinet, all of those things. 
Samantha (00:08:23): 
And I went to treatment for the first time in July of 2016. I did 28 days and went back home for a couple 
of days and realized that it was too much too fast and decided to go back to Elizabethtown where I'd 
went to Recovery Works to do some long-term. To me it kind of felt like a party, like a sorority house. I 
bucked the system. I didn't listen to anything that they told me to do. I was sneaking, taking the van 
where I shouldn't have taken the van. Lying. I was still doing every--I wasn't using, but I was doing 
everything wrong. That eventually led me to getting kicked out of the program. And I went to live with a 
couple of different people in E-town, started using again, went back home to show back up on my 
mom's doorstep unannounced. I guess that would have been like October, 2016. And of course they 
thought I was sober. So they were very proud of me. I moved back home. My mom and I can't live 
together. So like I said, I come from a privileged family. She paid my deposit and three months’ rent in 
an apartment cause she didn't want me under her roof. They still didn't really trust me. And I got my 
taxes back shortly thereafter in January. A big sum because I had my daughter now, and I went on a 
bender from January to April. I took myself back to treatment unannounced. My daughter was with my 
mom, and I just took off back to E-town early, early morning. Cause I knew that it was just all going to be 
bad if I didn't. And she came and got my car while I was in treatment and sold it. So I didn't have that 
anymore. I did choose to stay and do long-term again. I did very well for about eight months until the 
guy that I was seeing at the time had went back out. I got in trouble at my house for taking their van to 
see him. And since he was in active use, they wanted me to restart the program. I did not want to do 
that. So I left and went to a hotel. I stayed clean for about two weeks until I just couldn't watch it 
anymore. I watched them get high every day. I had never done heroin until this point. And so for 
whatever reason, I decided that I wanted to start using too and why not. Because I wasn't doing 
anything else. And that was my first time doing heroin or using a needle. The first time I overdosed was 
about three weeks later, and we, like I said, we were going back and forth from E-town to Louisville with 
no car, which was difficult, trying to find heroin every day for about six weeks. 
Samantha (00:11:08): 
We went to treatment together. The third time I went to treatment, which is my sobriety date, 
December 8th, 2017 and stayed there. We tried to go-- 
Ethan (00:11:18): 
At Recovery Works? 
Samantha (00:11:19): 
Yeah, I went there all three times. Cause it was familiar. And so this last time, we stayed there. I actually 
left with him. We went to his family in Northern Kentucky. Realized that that wasn't going to work out 
for us to stay sober. So we both came back to E-town. We actually wound up in a sober living that is co-
ed. There's a men's program and a women's. Did that for a few weeks or a few months. Then realized 
4 
 
that wasn't working out. We actually split up, and that is when I really made a turnaround, I say for 
myself. I realized that I have to do this for me and no one else, and no one's going to stay with me just 
because I'm sober. So from that point forward, I did everything the program asked me to do. I graduated 
that program. I waited for the right opportunity and roommate and got an apartment in E-town with 
someone that I trusted that had a year more sober time than I did. I still didn't have a car, but I made 
sure I had a ride to work. I worked at a factory for a year and a half until I was eligible to work in 
treatment. My grandmother actually passed away that following May, and my dad gave me her vehicle, 
which was a blessing, because I was actually doing the right thing for once. So he gave me her car, and I 
got a job at Stepworks first. I worked there for a little bit on third shift, which I didn't get a lot of 
interaction with clients, but then they wouldn't take me off of third shift. So I wound up at Recovery 
Works, where I started my journey, on second shift and loved it. I loved working in treatment. It's 
different than what we do here now, but it's what I-- 
Ethan (00:13:01): 
It's all residential there? 
Samantha (00:13:03): 
Yes. It's what I wanted to do. And so I stayed there for a while. But in the middle of all of that, I met a 
guy who lived here in Lexington. So we were doing a lot of back and forth, a lot of your weekend, my 
weekend. And we were both just tired of going back and forth. So we made a pact to see who got a job 
where first, and a friend of mine actually volunteers here at Voices of Hope. And she told me that she 
thought I'd be really great at this job. And I applied, and I was here and moved to Lexington in two 
weeks, because I had to give Recovery Works my notice. And ever since, I've been here. It's been kind of 
weird cause I didn't start till February of this year. So I only worked for about a month until we started 
working from home. And I also switched grants from, I was doing just recovery coaching, and I actually 
switched to the JCOIN project, which was, is a little on hold right now. So I'm kind of going back to what I 
started at. I work with women who are getting ready to reenter society from incarceration, making sure 
they have resources that they need. And we work with six different counties all over the state. 
Ethan (00:14:09): 
So that's your main emphasis right now? 
Samantha (00:14:11): 
Yeah. But I'm kind of going back to the other, just splitting my time between grants because I'm doing 
some of the volunteer stuff here. One of our girls is leaving and then also recovery coaching through 
that. So I've been doing some travel to these counties that I'm unfamiliar with their recovery. 
Ethan (00:14:27): 
So JCOIN just to clarify, that's the, the reentry program? 
Samantha (00:14:31): 
It's part of the HEAL initiative. It's like a sub of HEAL. It's Justice for Community Opioid Initiative 
Network, is what JCOIN stands for. So for the two months that we were, sorry, off with COVID, it was a 
lot of research in those counties. Just researching different resources that any of them might need for 
reentry. So now that I'm back here, I've been doing some more phone calls like on the recovery coach 
level. We have two new ones now, so not as much, but I've been doing the TRS calls, which we do 
5 
 
weekly calls here. You can sign up, and we call you once a week to see how your recovery is going, which 
I find super beneficial because I know for me it's a lot easier to answer the phone sometimes than to 
actually make the call yourself. So a lot of people really like it. Some people do it just to get a check mark 
for drug court, but others really do like us to call that weekly. So I enjoy doing those. I don't get to do 
them every day, cause we have volunteers that we like to utilize, but I've been doing some of that. 
They've sent me some phone calls from some people, a family member, just needing someone to talk to, 
anyone that just kind of calls the center and you know-- 
Ethan (00:15:47): 
So these aren't necessarily people in recovery. 
Samantha (00:15:50): 
They might be a family member, so I may, you know, help them. We're not allowed to give advice, I'm 
sure you all know, as peer support specialists. What I like most about it is I come from a recovery of 12 
step program. And it did work for me. It was very, very beneficial. However, Voices of Hope has really 
opened my eyes to what worked for me doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work for someone else. 
So this role switching from a sponsorship role in a narcotics anonymous program to a peer support 
specialist was a little difficult for me at first because I'm used to telling someone to do exactly what I did 
or what my sponsor did. And that's, I've learned that it's not as beneficial, you know what I mean? Just 
being here to support, if you can smoke marijuana and live a good life, that's awesome. I can't. But I 
can't tell you that you can't. So that's been the coolest part of being here is just learning all the different 
pathways of recovery and learning to be supportive of that. And even the medical side, learning how 
buprenorphine works and why it is--where I come from in a 12 step program, it's looked down upon if 
you're on buprenorphine--but I've learned that, you know, I would rather have someone alive and not 
dependent on a substance and a needle than to shun them and say, well, you're not in recovery. So I've 
done a lot of learning. 
Ethan (00:17:09): 
So in Recovery Works, they're not that open to that? 
Samantha (00:17:16): 
Well, they started though a little bit. The treatment centers are jumping on board with it. But what I 
found through my research in the counties that I've been in is the treatment centers are on board with 
buprenorphine, but the sober livings are not. So the problem is, is they're getting out of these treatment 
centers and they're not having anywhere to go. And I just find that sad cause, you know, they're trying 
to do something different. So my hope is that when I'm working here, just anyone I work with, just, 
support, it might be the smallest goal ever, like calling mom that they haven't talked to in two months, 
you know, or two years even. And then for them to call and say, "Hey, I called my mom and it went 
great." Like those type of calls or, "Hey, I got a job at McDonald's," but it's awesome to them because 
they haven't worked in five years or whatever. It might not be the job they want eventually, but just, 
just watching the little milestones. And I don't think there as celebrated, like I said, from the recovery 
path that I come from, the little things aren't as celebrated. 
Ethan (00:18:14): 
And so when you're working with the women who are moving out of jails, that's what you're talking 
about, helping them through those little steps? 
6 
 
Samantha (00:18:20): 
Yeah. Just making sure, breaking down the barrier for them, helping them find whatever it is they need, 
housing, sober living, transportation needs, food, anything. 
Ethan (00:18:32): 
Can we go back a minute, because you said when, when you first got out of recovery the last time that 
you went to work in the factory, but you were hoping to go back to work in a recovery setting but you 
weren't eligible. So I wanted to ask you about that. Like, was that rules that Recovery Works had? 
Samantha (00:18:57): 
Yes. Stepworks. I never went to Stepworks, so I wasn't considered Stepworks alumni. Yeah. So I worked, 
I was able to work at Stepworks a little earlier than Recovery Works because I didn't go through that 
program. Recovery Works has like a two year rule. Yeah. And I started just, they went ahead and let me 
go ahead and start--it was about two months before my actual two years. 
Ethan (00:19:28): 
So did you, that's where you were learning about peer support certification? 
Samantha (00:19:34): 
That's when I decided that I wanted to become peer support certified. I didn't have to be to work there 
because I was just a residential aid. But that's where I learned. 
Ethan (00:19:44): 
At Stepworks. And then when you went to-- 
Samantha (00:19:45): 
And I did my peer support training in Louisville at Bridgehaven. 
Ethan (00:19:51): 
But then when you went to, back to work for Recovery Works, you did more of the kind of work that 
peer support specialists do, is that right? 
Samantha (00:20:02): 
We don't get a lot of one-on-one with the clients, but we were in charge of running certain groups. So a 
lot of times what would happen is when I was doing those groups, I would say something about my life 
or my story, just a snippet. And it would cause them to want to come and talk to me more about it. But 
since they have counselors there, we're not really supposed to, they're not really allowed to have like a 
one-on-one session. 
Ethan (00:20:33): 
I see, I see. Do they have like peer mentors or something like that? 
Samantha (00:20:37): 
7 
 
They're just residential aides, and there's a select few that go on to get certified it. To me, it's not 
beneficial in a treatment setting as much because they do have the counselors on site. And it's more just 
about getting a couple extra dollars an hour. You don't really get to do the one-on-one like we do here. 
Ethan (00:20:58): 
So you didn't have a lot of experience with the one-on-one until you came here? 
Samantha (00:21:06): 
No, just in a sponsorship role. I had a lot of sponsees through the Narcotics Anonymous program. Now 
it's different because I tell my sponsees what to do. That's what it taught me to do. Now I try to help 
them come up with their own idea and then support that the best way I know how. 
Ethan (00:21:23): 
Yeah. Maybe we could talk a little bit more about that because that's always a question that, you know, I 
get, when I, when I'm talking about peer support workers, how is that different from a sponsor? So you 
talked a little bit about sort of adjusting to, for, you know, going from being a sponsor to being a peer 
support specialist. Could you just say a little bit more about what's the difference and like maybe some 
of the challenges? 
Samantha (00:21:50): 
Well, like I said, the sponsorship role for me is very different. I was brought up in a very raw recovery. 
Not that they were mean, but they almost work in a way of, you know, I wanted to leave treatment the 
last time. And one of the people that I've known for a long time in the program was like, all right, you 
want to go back to that apartment with no running water and only a futon, you know, really making me 
think and giving it to me in a way to make me think, oh, you want to go die, sure, go ahead. You know, it 
wasn't like, they didn't call me and hold me. So, and my sponsor was that way, you're not going to do 
this. You did that before. This is what you're going to do, or I'm not going to be your sponsor. 
Samantha (00:22:28): 
So it was kind of like a scary, like a scared straight almost, you know. But it did work for me. Honestly, I 
didn't see the changes in myself till I say 18 months, when I really noticed that I thought differently and I 
could catch myself when I started to act differently. So that's why I always tell people to take the time. 
So when I went to peer support specialist training, and I learned that I'm not allowed to give them 
advice, I'm not allowed to tell them what to do. I learned a lot about mental illness and substance abuse 
in that training. It's a lot of both, which we're often dually diagnosed. So that was beneficial to me. So 
it's really just about asking the right questions to get them to come up with their own idea of what they 
think that they should do. 
Samantha (00:23:18): 
I can coach them into the idea that I think they should do, but I can't just say, okay, I mean, you have 
one week to get a job, or I just don't know, I can't help you anymore. I can't do that. Whereas if I was a 
sponsor, I would say you have one week to get a job, or I'm not going to be your sponsor anymore. 
That's the difference. You know, I just have to support whatever that is. If you can drink occasionally 
that's cool with me. And that was different for me to be okay with. Cause I come from an abstinence-
based program, and you know, my long-term treatment, obviously we weren't allowed to do anything 
like that. So that's been the difference is being, is just supporting whatever that looks like to you. And 
8 
 
then just learning, you know, a relapse is a big deal in a 12 step program, and in a peer support role, we 
like to just call it a little setback. You know, it doesn't negate everything that you've done before that. 
You know, if you have a slip, let's talk about it. Let's move forward. Where did we go wrong? Instead of, 
oh, you've got to start all over. I think that's a big turnoff in the 12 step fellowships is that when you 
relapse and you go and get your white chip in front of everyone that you have to start all the way over. 
And it's almost like they try to tell you that now you don't know anything again, you have to start all 
over, and that's just not true. You learn so much on your journey that there's no way that you unlearn all 
of that. You just had a slip. So that's been a difference maker too. 
Ethan (00:24:42): 
Did it to test your patients a little bit when you, when you can't be as maybe direct-- 
Samantha (00:24:47): 
It did at first, you know. Now I'm learning, but at first, it was difficult for me to make that switch because 
that's what I had done for two years, you know? And I had told people what to do, and I was told what 
to do, but it worked. But also I can see now where just meeting these people that come in here, they 
come to meet with us because they don't feel welcome in those 12 step fellowships, but they want the 
help from someone. They just don't like how they're treated in those meetings. 
Ethan (00:25:18): 
So you do get, you do work with a lot of folks who, who have struggled with 12 steps? 
Samantha (00:25:27): 
That's why I know here we offer a wide--we have 12 step fellowships that use our space--but we also 
have Recovery Dharma. We have SMART recovery. We offer yoga, free yoga, and tai chi. You know, 
that's all, you know, all of those things are important. We have an all men's meeting. We have a 
medication meeting now, Medically Assisted Recovery Anonymous, which one of our recovery coaches 
started here, which has been great turnout because there is a lot of people in recovery that are on 
medications, and they don't feel welcome elsewhere. So it's pretty cool. Just to know that I work 
somewhere where anyone who feels like they're making advances in their recovery feels welcome and 
not shunned or scared to come. 
Ethan (00:26:07): 
When, when you're, when you're working with people who are seeking help, how do you bring up your 
story? I think you've mentioned how you bring it up maybe in the meetings, but how does it come out, 
Like if you're, maybe you're talking with someone on the phone? 
Samantha (00:26:26): 
I usually listen to them and try to pick out the one thing that I relate to, whether it's being incarcerated 
or not speaking with my parents, not seeing my children. You know I'm almost three or I'm two and a 
half, coming up on three years clean, and I still don't have custody of my children. So I try to let them 
know that like, you're, it's not always going to be the same for everyone. Cause I used to get very 
frustrated in the beginning, when everybody was getting their kids back, at six months clean, or their 
families were coming to see them in treatment. I never had that. And I still don't. I mean, I'm still 
building those relationships. So I try to just listen to what they're telling me and pick up the one thing I 
can relate to and just give them a snippet. And then it usually sparks, well, what did you do in this. You 
9 
 
know, I went to jail in sobriety, you know. I don't have my children the way that I want to. But my 
parents finally understand, and it's taken this long for them to understand. They would rather have me 
here helping people and being clean than somewhere else with them not knowing, even though that 
means that I'm away from them and my children. 
Ethan (00:27:33): 
There's this question that I wanted to ask from other peer supports. So it's not kind of really well 
formulated, but if you are like, do you sort of help when you're working with someone, do you sort of 
help them through, sort of give them the language for them to understand what they're going through? 
Is that ever something that's sort of where you would intervene and say, well, I think this is how you 
should think about this, or this is what you're really dealing with. Does that sound-- 
Samantha (00:28:10): 
I try to do. Like I said, I was, I don't know about every peer support specialist training, but the one I went 
to, they were very clear about, we cannot give them direct advice or whatever. 
Ethan (00:28:21): 
Just more of a sort of a sounding board--of what they bring to you-- 
Samantha (00:28:24): 
And I try to bounce ideas. And so the recovery coaches here, we work on a recovery capital scale. So we 
go through the different things, and I try to just pick the one area that needs like the most work and 
start there, whether it's, they need a bus pass. Okay. Let's get the bus pass, and we'll check that off. 
Now, we're not very spiritual. What can we do to enhance our spiritual life? We're not very physically 
active. What can we do? And just try to meet the little goals. I try to talk in a different recovery language 
here. We try to be more positive than--we say setback instead of relapse. We say substance use disorder 
instead of drug addict and stuff like that. And that it is a big mental change for people whenever you 
speak to them in that way, rather than a negative way, it doesn't make them feel so low. Cause they're 
coming in here usually seeking treatment or trying to find sober living or they don't like AA, so they 
don't want to sponsor. So they come here for, for that. And so, you know, it's just, it's really 
individualized. I mean, I listen to what they're telling me. I try to always, especially during the first 
couple of meetings, let them relate to me because sometimes it's hard. Like when I first started 
Recovery Works, they're like, you never did. You went to jail, you did, you know. I don't look like that 
anymore. I don't, I don't talk like that. I don't dress like that. I don't act like that. Not that drug addicts or 
people with substance use disorder do, but I don't appear as though I did anymore. And so I have to 
relate to them. I have to let them know that I have used IV heroin or that I have been to jail, and let 
them know that I've been through those things because often they can't see that right away. Especially 
when we start to get some time clean, we just aren't those people anymore, you know. 
Ethan (00:30:22): 
Right, right. No, I think that helps. I just, you know, as I'm doing more interviews, I start coming up with 
sort of new questions. So ,but thanks. I wanted to talk about recovery coaching. So a little bit more 
about how that's different from peer support specialists. So you've talked about the recovery capital 
assessment, and so a recovery coach is not the same as a peer support specialist? I've heard people say 
it's different, but-- 
10 
 
Samantha (00:30:56): 
It is a little bit different, and we do our own recovery coach academy. Through Voices. So we do both. 
Ethan (00:31:03): 
Did you do that training here, or did you already have that? 
Samantha (00:31:07): 
No, Voices does their own. Yeah. It's through CCA. Like we have a, there's a book and everything and 
slide shows, and it's like a whole week long thing. I would say it's pretty much the same. However, 
recovery coaching is geared a little more towards just substance use, not both ends, not the mental and 
the substance use disorder. Whereas peer support specialists, you spend about half the week mental 
health, and then about half the week substance use. So this was just pretty much straight substance use. 
But yes, I had never done that before. Which I don't think just a peer support specialist in a treatment 
setting would either work on the recovery capital scale. That was, I had heard of it, but it was new to 
me. So we work off that, which there's like eight different categories, and I just kind of jot down, and like 
I said, I make a goal, I start off really small. That way we can start checking things off. And then every 
time they come to me, like, look what all we've checked, you know, you've done it. This is great. Like, 
you know and even if they don't want to come in and meet with us weekly, we call them weekly just to 
check in. Sometimes they just call us, just to check in, things like that. But it's basically, I've learned 
recovery coaching is more of just being a support. It's not do this, don't do that. We're actually not-- 
Samantha (00:32:25): 
They scared me in peer support training saying you can't do, there's no advising, no telling what to do. 
Obviously, no medical advice. I can't tell you to come in. 
Ethan (00:32:33): 
But you kind of help them set goals to move forward. 
Samantha (00:32:35): 
Yeah. And it's rewarding when they, when they get those goals, and they're so excited that, you know, 
they got a job, or their mom called, or they get to see their kids, and stuff like that. 
Ethan (00:32:46): 
And are there one-on-one sessions that you have? 
Samantha (00:32:49): 
Usually weekly, usually they come in weekly with all of this coming in, there's been a lot more phone. A 
lot of people aren't wanting to come in. Some of the sober livings won't allow them to do anything other 
than go to work. So it's been slow and a lot of people have fallen off, unfortunately, during this time. I 
mean, I've lost three friends personally just since COVID that had a year or more clean, you know. So it's 
just kind of slow right now for all the recovery coaches. It's just a weird time for everyone. 
Ethan (00:33:26): 
It is very difficult. So you would say that people who were doing coaching, who are getting coaching, 
there's been a pretty big drop off on that? 
11 
 
Samantha (00:33:35): 
I mean they're answering the phone. Well, most of them, and they're just, hey, yeah. But like I said, a lot 
of their sober livings aren't allowing them to do much else. Even though the meetings are opened back 
up, a couple of them have even told me that they're not even allowed to do that. They have to do their 
own meetings there. So we're still offering hybrid for that reason, so they can Zoom in. And then there's 
people here as well. 
Ethan (00:33:59): 
Do you run a meeting too here? 
Samantha (00:34:00): 
I used to do the women's. We don't have it anymore. I'm not sure why we took it off. So I'm, I'm 
certified as SMART facilitator. So I can do that. One of our recovery coaches kind of picked that up since 
I'm more on the JCOIN side now with the women in jail. So she kind of took that over for me, but I did do 
some SMART. I did do the women's, and then there's all recovery meetings as well, but YPR, which is 
Young People in Recovery. I'm sure you've heard of them. They actually hired a representative for this 
area. So he runs that meeting now. 
Ethan (00:34:39): 
So a little bit more about the JCOIN program. So when you were working, when you work with women 
in that program, is that, was that remote mostly? Is that all mostly [inaudbile] telephone? 
Samantha (00:34:55): 
Yes. So we were actually hired by UK. So UK actually goes in and does the initial visit in the jail, which 
now is telehealth, I guess, and then they send them to us after they do the initial one. So when they 
come to me, we have, it's like Daviess, Bullitt, Shelby, Lee, Harlan, and Grayson. So we have six counties, 
and those are the women that are in those jails. They will predominantly all be sent straight to a 
buprenorphine clinic. That's kind of the conditions of their release. And then our job after that is, you 
know, obviously do you have somewhere to go? How long till you get out, you know? Do you need sober 
living? Make sure they get there. You're gonna need transportation. Hook them up with the food bank. 
So traveling to those counties has been-- 
Ethan (00:35:44): 
So you do go meet with them? 
Samantha (00:35:44): 
I will. Yes, I haven't. Yeah, it kind of is on, on a pause because they can't go into the jails anymore. So it's 
very weird. 
Ethan (00:35:58): 
And these, so these are, these are women who are doing drug court. 
Samantha (00:36:02): 
No, some of them will be in a drug court. Some of them will just have conditions of release where I 
guess their PO will say, do this, don't do that. So basically we get 'em right before re-entry like a month 
12 
 
or so. And they're, you know, and that's when they call us. So it's kind of weird because we're in 
Lexington, and they're all over the state. So that's why we've been traveling to meet the people at the 
clinics, the people in treatment there, the sober living owners. 
Ethan (00:36:33): 
And that's, these are counties where there's not a whole lot of resources? 
Samantha (00:36:35): 
Yes. Right. And that's also been the thing I found when I realized that a lot of the sober livings don't 
allow people on buprenorphine. So I find that sad. However, I did have a great experience in Daviess 
county, which is Owensboro. No sober living will allow buprenorphine. However, I met with a couple 
individuals who run the Owensboro Recovery Project and whatever I said changed their mind about 
people on buprenorphine. So hopefully, I'm getting ready to go down and do, not a seminar, I wouldn't 
say, but I've prepared a slideshow on how it works, why it works. Quotes from people who have been on 
it and why that they love being on it. Things like that. Just if I can just get one sober living to change their 
mind, because the reality is these women are going to need somewhere to go. And so I'm kinda like the, 
I wasn't really a harm reduction person before becoming a peer support specialist. But now like, you 
know, if someone comes in and they're using, it's not, oh, I can't talk to you if you're still using. It's like, 
okay, are we using safely? Do you have clean needles? Are you using, don't use alone. Whoever's with, 
you needs to have Narcan. Let's send you home, you know. And that that's different for me. 
Ethan (00:37:53): 
But what is the resistance for the sober living? Why do they resist that? 
Samantha (00:38:01): 
A lot of people still think that they're just replacing something, they're replacing the drug with another 
drug. And for me, it was explained, like a doctor explained it to me, like we take Celexa to give our 
bodies a chemical that it's not producing, right. We need more so we can be happy, not so sad. Same 
thing, buprenorphine is doing the same thing. It's just replacing a chemical. Yes, that chemical was an 
illicit drug, but it's replacing it to where you don't have to do that and you can live a normal life and you 
just get up. And one of my friends, she actually made a quote and said, you know, I take my daily 
vitamins every day, and I just think of my Suboxone as one of my vitamins that keeps me healthy. So I 
think that the new shot is going to be more accepted. It's a 30 day. So you get one shot a month. It's like 
the Sublocade. And I think that maybe it might be a little more accepted because you're not taking 
something daily. 
Ethan (00:39:04): 
But they're not concerned that--I was just curious sort of where that resistance comes. They're not 
concerned about like-- 
Samantha (00:39:10): 
That you're misusing it or overusing it. You're selling it, or you're going to give it to somebody in the 
house. So a lot of houses have like--now, I know some of the houses have dosing times and whoever the 
person is, they keep it locked up, and you come get it at a certain time, and that's it. So I guess just, you 
have to have somebody that you trust to do that. A lot of people just, they come from an abstinence 
based program, and they don't agree with it at all. 
13 
 
Ethan (00:39:37): 
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's kind of partly a safety concern, but it's partly just sort of they've been taught 
this way. 
Samantha (00:39:44): 
I think so. Cause I've had to retrain my brain and just become open to it, which we say we're open-
minded in recovery. But I learned after moving here and becoming a recovery coach and going through 
peer support that I was actually very close-minded, you know, and I've had to just. But it's also, I mean, I 
post things on Facebook on my own personal stuff, and it's a lot of people have messaged me, like, 
thank you for saying that because I feel this way. Or, you know, even about like, leaving a 12 step 
program, like they're scared to quit going to meetings and things like that. But it's like, for me, like I just 
knew that it was, I didn't get clean to just go to meetings and sponsor people and work in recovery and 
not have another life. You know, like now I am in recovery. I'm still clean and sober, but I actually live my 
life. I go on trips. I go see my kids, you know. And before, when I was in Elizabethtown, I felt like the 
recovery, there was very, if you're not at this, this, and this meeting, then you're doing it wrong. If you 
don't have 10 sponsees, you're doing it wrong. And so it's opened my eyes to a new idea of recovery. 
Ethan (00:40:53): 
Well, it seems like things are changing everywhere. So I mean, that's, that's, that's a positive. Well, do 
you want to say more about that, is there anything we forgot in terms of what you work on here? So 
when you come into work, it kind of just depends on the day, you know, what your schedule is? 
Samantha (00:41:12): 
It kinda just depends. Like I said, I make the weekly calls for Telephone Recovery Support, when our 
volunteers weren't allowed in the center. So sometimes I'll do that. Obviously check up on my emails, 
and then we actually have a system we log into that prompts me on who to call. So we log in. It'll show 
who's ready for a phone call and then it's, yeah. 
Ethan (00:41:41): 
But those phone calls are just, you know, how, how can I help you? 
Samantha (00:41:44): 
Yeah. How's it going? What's, what's the hang up? Do you need any help? You know, we've taken 
people, we've taken sober livings hygiene kits, for new people. 
Ethan (00:41:56): 
And after you talk to someone, you like write it down, so that there's a record? 
Samantha (00:42:01): 
Yeah. It's all, you know, just like a little note box on their thing. And we use unique IDs. So no one's first 
and last name is used. So we just call them, just check up on their recovery. Sometimes they want to 
come in. Sometimes they don't. But you know, sometimes they're lying to me. Sometimes they're, you 
know, sometimes they're being honest. You just don't ever really--some people think that this place is a 
bank. They think that we can just give out money for whatever, and that's not the case. So 
unfortunately, some people come in, and they don't want to do the recovery capital. They don't want to 
14 
 
talk about all that. They just want a handout. And that's the nature of the beast. That's part of who we 
are-- 
Ethan (00:42:55): 
But when you are coaching someone, you do have, if they are in a situation, you can get them some kind 
of assistance, but it's not just for anyone, right? 
Samantha (00:43:04): 
Yeah, they have to be pretty engaged. And I have to see that they're doing the right thing, and they're 
really in a predicament, but we can take that to the, to the board here and say, "This is my participant. 
This is what she needs. This is why she needs it." And they'll either say yes or no. So there's a little bit of 
funds, but it's not like a lot of people think. 
Ethan (00:43:25): 
But the people who are doing the TRS, that's not an option for them? 
Samantha (00:43:28): 
No, yeah. They pretty much need to be, because we can't tell what you're really doing from TRS, you 
know. And not that we don't want to help people, but our funds would be exhausted if we gave 
everybody a month's worth of sober living, you know. 
Ethan (00:43:49): 
So, and then you, so you, you do work like the full week here, the full 40 hours? 
Samantha (00:43:55): 
Yep. Monday through Friday. I'm a 10 to 6:30. So it's getting ready to change a little bit. Cause I'm going 
to be taking over some of the volunteer work when Stacy leaves. So I'll have some volunteers, things like 
that. I'm taking over the sober socials, which we do twice monthly, so I'll be taking--and since my JCOIN 
is kind of on hold, I'm just picking up all the extra pieces in between. 
Ethan (00:44:21): 
JCOIN might go back on-- 
Samantha (00:44:23): 
After the first of the year. They don't think that we will be allowed into the jails. Which we will go, but 
UK has to go first. So UK has been told right now that it's probably gonna be the first the year before. 
Ethan (00:44:36): 
But procedures are all going forward. I mean, people aren't stuck in jail, right. I mean like-- 
Samantha (00:44:41): 
No, they're not stuck in jail. We're just not allowed to get in as a participant. Right. But they're working 
on some other things that we can do in the meantime, one of them is taking the recovery coach 
participants that we have now and conducting a survey to see--I don't know what the questions will be, 
15 
 
UK will come up with this, I guess--to see how they relate to their recovery coach, and how beneficial is 
it to them and whatever. However they calculate the results, that'll go back to UK and then we'll know-- 
Ethan (00:45:13): 
So JCOIN is a coaching program? 
Samantha (00:45:17): 
They call us peer navigators. But we are recovery coaches. I mean, it's no, it's no different. It's just on 
telehealth rather than face-to-face. 
Ethan (00:45:29): 
The terms get confusing. 
Samantha (00:45:29): 
Yes, it does. So if you look at my card, it says-- 
Ethan (00:45:33): 
Peer navigator. 
Samantha (00:45:36): 
It's kind of weird, but that's just what JCOIN project asked to call me. But I'm really, as far as like what I 
did as a recovery coach over here as to here, it's really the same, but that's just how their, what is it, 
their SOP just calls, just tells me that, yeah. 
Ethan (00:45:57): 
You know, I have encountered some people who will say, no, this is, this is what a coach does, this is 
what a peer support does. Some, some places they, they-- 
Samantha (00:46:04): 
Well then too, like you were saying at Stepworks, I was called a recovery coach, but I wasn't allowed to 
tell my story. I wasn't allowed to give them any type of advice at all. It was just what they called it. So 
when I came here, I was like, well, I'm a, and then I did that whole training. I'm like, oh my gosh, this is 
what a recovery coach is. You know what I was doing, I guess that's just what they call it there. 
Ethan (00:46:26): 
So this is sort of a process of defining what those roles are? 
Samantha (00:46:31): 
Yeah. But if you are a peer support certified at Stepworks, you are allowed-- 
Ethan (00:46:37): 
To do that kind of work. 
Samantha (00:46:41): 
16 
 
That certification kind of just gives you a little more-- 
Ethan (00:46:44): 
That's at Stepworks, which is different from Recovery Works. 
Samantha (00:46:50): 
I know it's very confusing. 
Ethan (00:46:52): 
Let's talk about sort of where you see, well, I don't know if you want to, before we get into that, if you 
have like any examples of folks you've worked with who've done really well, any, like we might call them 
success stories. 
Samantha (00:47:15): 
I would say my favorite one is I met with a lady who, you know, hadn't seen her kids for almost two 
years. And she just could not find the courage to even make the phone call to initiate, so I got to do that 
with her, the first phone call. And then after that, it was like, she would call and say, my mom called 
today, and I got to talk to my kids. And then it wasn't long until she called me on a Monday. And they 
had come to see her that weekend. And so just watching that was really cool. She still doesn't have 
them back like she wants, but they're, you know, moving back into their life you know, watching 
someone who--I worked with another couple actually, and it was kind of the same story. I didn't sit with 
them on the first phone call, but I encouraged them. And we made little steps along the way to initiate 
the phone call to see their kids. Because I think a lot of times we're just driven on fear of a no, you know, 
and so just letting them know that a no is okay. And we'll keep moving, and then we'll address it again in 
a few, in a few months. And I always let them know, you know, I went six months without even talking 
to my mother during her radiation and chemo for breast cancer. And at the time, she was really 
resentful. Now, my mom is glad that I was not there for that, because number one, I probably would 
have been high. And number two, she doesn't think at that time in my recovery that I was ready for it. 
So I try to let them know, sometimes it's just, you know, we don't want to force it, you know, just 
helping them. And then too people that, you know, get a job at McDonald's. And then in two months 
they're a shift manager, and then they're, they have a key to the store and the safe, and those things are 
very big, big things. And a lot of times their goals are to be in a position like this, or work in treatment. 
And I always encourage that. It's not the best money, but it is the most rewarding when you see 
somebody, you know, get those things back that they want. 
Ethan (00:49:27): 
I was going to ask about, so you work with other peer support workers, so, you know, what, what are 
those relationships like? And you know, what do you learn from other people you're working with, you 
know, other peer navigators, other peer support specialists? 
Samantha (00:49:43): 
We definitely consult each other on a lot of things, whether it, you know, we may not put somebody on 
hold, but they might have a conversation and then come back to me. Or I might go to one of the other 
ones that I know has been through the situation that I haven't. I can't think of one off the top of my 
head of what that would be, but there's things that others have been through that, that, you know, I 
haven't, or a resource-- 
17 
 
Ethan (00:50:06): 
You see them pretty much every day? 
Samantha (00:50:09): 
Oh yeah. Yeah. Our hours are a little bit different, you know, but we definitely bounce ideas off of each 
other. We, we meet weekly, all different types. We have programming. We have recovery coach 
meeting. I have just a JCOIN meeting. So we're collaborating often on what we think is best for ourselves 
and for Voices of Hope and even what services we might be able to offer that we don't yet offer, you 
know, that someone might be-- 
Ethan (00:50:40): 
What are you looking to offer? What else? 
Samantha (00:50:43): 
Well, like we started, we started up the grief group. Things like that are important, I think. And then the 
friends and family has been a big, big thing, and I've been helping with that some cause the guy who 
does that, he comes in a little bit later. So anytime there's a phone call in the mornings, I usually take 
those. And, you know, I worked with a mom whose son had been to treatment 40 plus times in his life. 
And he was getting ready to come home, and we, you know, discussed what she wanted to do and what 
she didn't want to do. And although I wanted to tell her what to do, I couldn't, but we wrote down the 
things that he had to do to stay there. And so far so good with them. I check, usually check in with her 
on Mondays if she doesn't call me on Fridays. 
Samantha (00:51:31): 
So she's really been grateful that I've followed up with her and followed her in the journey. And just 
giving--I've also been distributing flyers throughout the county, just here in Fayette County for the 
friends and family line, for people to call, you know, cause a lot of times, they don't, the other family 
members don't understand what a parent's going through. And if you're not the parent, you just don't 
get it. So I think stuff like that is beneficial. And then, of course, we just got the medication meeting up 
and running, which we were all really excited about. This week starts our LGBTQ all-recovery meeting. 
So we're appealing to that community as well, which is ever so growing. People are becoming more 
comfortable with those who identify in that way. And I think that's important for them to feel 
comfortable here. So just different things like that--looking at the holes in recovery and saying what, 
what can we offer that's not out there. 
Ethan (00:52:35): 
Do you also sometimes reach out to like peers at other institutions? Like at Recovery Works? 
Samantha (00:52:43): 
I mean if I need a resource in that area. Cause from working at those places, I know people at all 
locations. So if I've got a question about, you know, London, I'm going to call Tim at Stepworks, you 
know, cause he's in the recovery community there. 
Ethan (00:52:57): 
You don't sort of stay in touch constantly. It's more like if-- 
18 
 
Samantha (00:53:05): 
And we go and get, part of my project in JCOIN is getting the people all over the state to sign up to be a 
recovery advocate. And basically what that means is they give us permission to call them and ask 
questions with a participant or by ourselves. It'll always be Voices of Hope staff. But they just sign up 
and say, okay, these are the counties, and they click what counties they know about, what they're 
willing to help with sponsorship, sober living. So I can call and say, "Hey, this is Smith at Voices. I've got 
so-and-so leaving treatment here in Lexington. They're coming to where you're at. What can I do?" 
Because it's impossible to know everything all over the state. I mean, I'm really good at Hardin county 
cause I lived in E-town for three years, so I know everybody personally, but when it comes to 
everywhere else, I just. And then Louisville, we team up a lot with the LRCC, and they're super helpful 
and super awesome. 
Ethan (00:53:58): 
So those, those folks that you call, those recovery advocates, they're usually working in the recovery 
center-- 
Samantha (00:54:06): 
Some of them do. Some of them are just people, just people in AA or NA that, you know, are willing to 
be that phone call. So they're not always a peer support, but they can definitely get me to the right 
people, or at least get me a number to get me to the right person. 
Ethan (00:54:25): 
Well, we just want to end talking about, you know, how, how you see the profession of peer support 
specialist, how you've seen it growing and changing, and what are some issues that still need to be 
worked out and then sort of, where are you, where you would like to see, you know, the profession go 
and where you maybe personally would like to, to go with it? So that's a lot of questions. 
Samantha (00:54:58): 
As a peer support specialist and a recovery coach, I think that it's going to pick up speed because just 
like I said, for me being here and my eyes being open to different pathways of recovery and learning 
that my way is not the end all be all, that different things work for different people. I think that that idea 
is becoming more widespread. It's taken a little longer in certain areas, mostly the rural areas, who 
that's just not the way that they think, and that's okay. But I think that people will utilize our services 
more once they realize what we are. Some people think that we're just like a sponsor in AA. So for us to 
offer services here that are all inclusive, no matter what pathway it is that you're taking, that we're here 
to support. I think more people will want to come to a recovery coach or a peer support specialist. 
Because like I said, I know the people I work with, most of them come here to see us because they've 
had a bad experience in a 12 step fellowship. 
Ethan (00:56:00): 
Yeah. So you, you envision there being more centers like this around the state? 
Samantha (00:56:06): 
And, and they're, and they're coming, which is what Owensboro, that's what they're wanting to do 
there. We have one here, which we're one. And then also there's the new Recovery Cafe that just 
19 
 
opened here. Of course, Louisville has a center. Northern Kentucky has one, but I would love to see 
statewide. I mean, even nationwide, eventually centers where someone can come and feel welcomed 
no matter what, no matter if they're still using, or they choose a different pathway than the others. 
Because I know a lot of the clubhouses that supposedly they'll welcome anyone, it's just not the reality. 
It sounds good in theory, but I know from experience, and then the people I've worked with, you know, 
she, they found out she was taking a medication and ever since then, they won't let her speak in a 
meeting and a lot of different things. And so she had almost given up, you know, and it was actually 
working for her, you know, and I find that--you know, she's got three job promotions since she's been on 
the medication. And so I just envision as peer support specialists, we need to be, I say it, I'm all the time, 
like I recover out loud so that people don't have to die in silence. That's one of my favorite sayings. And 
so I just try to be an advocate for anything and everything, no matter what your way is, you know, and it 
seems to be working slowly but surely. Just that all centers become more all inclusive. 
Ethan (00:57:42): 
Recovery cafe, so they have a similar model? 
Samantha (00:57:45): 
I haven't been yet. They're going to host meetings there. It's just like a safe place. I think they're going to 
have like a, like a, you know, like a snack bar and then like maybe a pool table, just a safe place to go if 
you don't have one. 
Ethan (00:58:00): 
But not necessarily the coaching? 
Samantha (00:58:03): 
I don't know. I don't know. 
Ethan (00:58:04): 
I was curious. I haven't looked into it either. 
Samantha (00:58:09): 
I don't know if they're going to hire maybe eventually if they feel that that's like a need that they have. 
So, and then we're, we're just getting able to, you know, being able to go out and do the recruiting 
again, which is where we go to like the sober livings and the clinics and stuff like that. Let them know 
what our services are. It just got, like I said, it was such a standstill there for two months. We're still 
working on getting it back up and getting our people to come back in. 
Ethan (00:58:34): 
Do you foresee, you know, that it will pick up, you know, that people will starting coming in? 
Samantha (00:58:40): 
I hope so. You know, like I said, we're able to go places again. So people are seeing our faces again. 
We're doing our sober socials. Our meetings are back in, so more people. It's slow, but they are coming 
back. 
20 
 
Ethan (00:58:59): 
It was such a rough time. A lot of people just turned inward, you know, people, you know, across all 
lifestyles. But I do want to ask about sort of challenges, you know, what do you see things for peer 
support specialists, things maybe that need to be ironed out? 
Samantha (00:59:22): 
As much as I love not having to tell someone what to do. It is more challenging to get them to set those 
goals their self and not just say that's not going to work. Although I don't know if it's going to work or 
not. So I wish sometimes that we were more allowed to say, "This is what I think you should do." I just 
can't use it in that context. So I have to twist it, try to make them come up with that, the idea I'm 
thinking, on their own and say, "Yes, that's a great idea." 
Ethan (01:00:00): 
It's a really fine line. 
Samantha (01:00:03): 
Yeah, it is. Because they're looking at you for direction, but yet we're really not allowed to give them 
that direction. So, you know, they want peer support specialists, but then we really aren't allowed to 
say, "Well, that didn't work for me. So you should try it this way." When I know some, not always, but a 
lot of times I know that, you know, leaving the sober living is not a good idea, but I can't say that. I have 
to support whatever it is. 
Ethan (01:00:35): 
So you can't even say, my opinion is...? 
Samantha (01:00:38): 
No. I would just have to say, you know, we can try that, but let's look at the pros and the cons. Yeah, but 
I can't say, "That's a dumb idea." Or "That didn't work for me. I tried it five times." Because they may go 
get their own apartment and be very successful and be sober forever. So it's one of those, it's kind of 
like the thing with relationships in recovery, people always say don't. However, there's those few people 
that meet in recovery, and they're married now with kids, and they own a business, and you know what 
I mean? And so you just can't say that to people, because I think that's the discouraging part of a 12 step 
fellowship is being told, "No, your way is wrong." Well, then, you already think it's wrong. And so even if 
you go to do it, you feel like you're going to fail. So the fine line to be more defined would be beneficial, 
but I've learned to, you know, do the like motivational interviewing type questions to try to finesse it to 
make them come up with the idea that I think they should do anyway. And that's really the best way. 
Ethan (01:01:50): 
Yeah. The motivational interviewing. I think that's what I was trying to get at with my question earlier. 
Like how do you sort of get them to do things or think about things in a certain way without-- 
Samantha (01:02:01): 
Just asking questions. The recovery capital scale helps. Because it's laid out, you know, personal 
relationships, transportation. So they can see on paper, what, oh, well that's good. Because they may 
not be thinking that that's a plus, but it is a plus, you know. So just, you know, the line to be more 
21 
 
defined, but at the same time, I think it's good because it allows our participants to think that they're 
coming up with the idea on their own. And I've learned that when they think that they've came up with 
it on their own, they're more prone to do it than for me to say don't do this, do this. Well, they're going 
to not want to do this because I'm telling them to. And so they come up with it on their own. And so I 
think, I think it works more, but it's getting, I don't know. I don't want to say pull people away from a 12 
step fellowship, but getting people to understand that maybe that's not the only way. That you can 
benefit from meeting with a recovery coach. 
Ethan (01:03:06): 
Right. Well, I think that's about it. There is something that we. What about you personally? What about 
like your thoughts on what, where you'd like to go with your-- 
Samantha (01:03:19): 
Well, I haven't decided yet what I'm going to do. Since being in recovery, I love working with people in 
recovery and seeing the light bulb come on. However, moving forward and getting my children back, am 
I going to be able to support myself with a peer support specialist salary? Probably not. I can with the 
help of someone, which I have, but what if I didn't? So I'm at the point now in my recovery where I want 
to go back to school, but I don't. I always thought I would do social work and become a counselor and all 
that stuff. But now I don't know that that's necessarily going to be the road that I take. So I'm waiting to 
go back to school until I know for sure, because I don't want to waste my time doing something that I 
don't want to do. 
Samantha (01:04:09): 
So I just think it's important for anyone to realize how important a peer is aside from a counselor or, you 
know, someone that just runs a treatment center. Not that counselors haven't been there, some of 
them have, but to have someone who's been through those experiences, they're more likely, I know I 
was, I listened to people who had been through what I'd been through more so than my mom, who 
doesn't understand. So they are beneficial in treatment settings and after-treatment settings, because 
we can relate. And I think that's where our advice that we're not allowed to give comes in, you know, 
because they say, "Oh, okay, well, she did it this way and it worked for her." So they're more willing to 
try. 
Ethan (01:04:56): 
Well, and that's another challenge, the salary isn't right for everyone. 
Samantha (01:05:09): 
And it works for me now, but I have half of everything. If it were just me, I probably wouldn't. I would 
have to do something maybe on the weekends to offset.  
Ethan (01:05:17): 
But maybe in the future, you know, once they realize the importance of peer support-- 
Samantha (01:05:23): 
22 
 
Which I feel like we, I mean, this is the most, here they offer more than anywhere else as a peer 
support. Like I haven't found anywhere that would even match this. So just having the peer support, no 
other degrees, no college degrees, no extras, just that certification alone. 
Ethan (01:05:45): 
But yeah, that is something that needs to be worked on. 
Samantha (01:05:51): 
If they can, if they can prove that it's working, which I feel like it definitely is working in some respects, 
but it's, it's an ever, it's a challenge that's never going to go away. 
Ethan (01:06:06): 
I have heard there's an issue with Medicaid billing, and you all don't deal with that because you're grant-
funded. But for those who do the billing for a peer support specialist-- 
Samantha (01:06:19): 
We don't do the billing, but I guess a treatment center can--I forget. 
Ethan (01:06:25): 
Yeah, they can bill for peer support, but I've heard that it's not very much. So that, that's a concern. But 
anyway, so is there anything else that we should talk about? Other issues? 
Samantha (01:06:45): 
I don't think so. 
Speaker 3 (01:06:48): 
Okay. We went an hour, so that's great. Thank you so much.
