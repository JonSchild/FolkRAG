Grew up in Tyler, East Texas. School in Notre Dame and stayed up there. Went to law 
school. Folks were farm people. Father was with the federal govt. Being a lawyer was in 
the blood. Met wife up there. got clerkship with judge out of Notre Dame in Georgia. 
Fascinating time to be a judge on the 5th circuit. Was still segregated in the south. Had a 
fascinating time. Had opportunity to work with lawyers who were the legal pillars of the 
desegregation movement. Worked for three years with a firm in Atlanta. Was always 
interested in maritime law. Came to Houston in 1974. Made partner at the firm quickly. 
Doing maritime law ever since. Four kids.  
 
00:05:02 
Know Father Patout through Notre Dame alumni. Was president of the Notre dame club. 
Also part of the seafarers club. Never been to public school. Strong Catholic background.  
 
00:07:10 
William Wade Justice. US attorney. Career on bench.  
 
00:09:55 
Admiralty law. Maritime law is English based. Civil law system. Very international law. 
Has developed similarly all over the world. US picked up law from the English in the 
1700s. many anomalies that still exist. For instance, ships are treated as people. Ships can 
be arrested and can be sold to satisfy it's debts. Primarily federal court. Congress in 1789 
reserved causes and common law to the state court so they could adjudicate maritime 
cases. Certain things a state court can't do. Largely judge made law. International 
regulatory. Part of the UN. Safety at sea. Lots of statutes from 1870s about protecting 
seamen. Collisions, groundings, hitting docks, bridges. Property damage, casualty 
element. Do a lot of personal injury work. Deal with immigration. expatriation of dead 
bodies. Cargo. from steel containers to oil cargos. Commercial side. Lease them - long 
term or short term. Active arbitration in Houston. American merchant marine has largely 
disappeared. 95% of ships came in last year are foreign vessels. Deal with conflicts. Part 
of international aspect of maritime law is insurance. At every major port there is one set 
of attorney's representing the P&I club. There are 11 groups in the internationally.

Was involved in the Gulf oil spill. Fast response in the business. Get  involved at least in 
advising the management. Earlier there were no response people as was there now during 
the oil spill. Had to take on the additional role and be point person during crisis.  
 
00:24:38 
It was the Alvenus back in 1984. Grounded going into Cameroon, LA. Spilled 10,000 
tons of crude oil. Had a grounded ship with casualty on there with most of the crude on. 
Oil migrated down tot Galveston and turned out to be the largest beach spill in the US. 
British flag vessel, coastguard investigation. UK sent a master mariner over to 
investigate. Litigation started up. At that time while all the work was going on, people 
started coming to the office with boils on their body. Upon investigation, turned out to be 
hair follicles from dead moths.  
 
00:30:11 
first thing to assess during a disaster is what kind of resources would need to be brought 
together, Was required to do a lot of non legal stuff. The ITOF are the world's experts on 
response for tanker spills. Was sent an Englishman to handle the mess. Was an expert. 
Crude oil spill is biodegradable. By then a few big spills had happened and had become 
cynical. But consequences are less than what was being said and made of the situation. 
The dangerous spills are those of products like chemicals that do not break down.  
 
00:38:12 
When got involved in spill management, role now for a P&I. Response has to be handled 
responsibly. Once experts come in, need to get out of the way. Spill was high sulphur 
crude, smell of rotten eggs. Also benzene. Evacuated certain areas of Port Arthur. Ship 
came in and had a hydrodynamic interaction with the bank. It did four shears. An 
outbound barge comes in and literally knifes into it. Cuts through the double hull and 
another tank. Oil spilled out. Lost relatively small spill but it smelled. Filed limitation of 
liability. Had 2500 residents who had complained. Word got around in the community 
that if your claim was in you would get a $1000. No questions asked. All of a sudden. the 
clerkâ€™s office was inundated with all these claims. Many had no lawyers. 40% of the 
population in Port Arthur filed a claim.  
 
00:44:36 
Anticipated that it would be down to a manageable number, have done that a couple of 
times. Had a similar situation with a barge in Corpus Christi. evacuated 8500 people and 
ended up with 2000 people.  
 
00:46:02 
Sometimes the local agents have a fair appreciation of this, stevedores a lot less, people 
like River Patout who are focused on sea farers have a different point of view. 
Wonderfully graphic and fascinating events that are fun to deal with. Find it fascinating 
the breadth of what is being done and just how internationally connected they are. Having 
 
 
to get used to cultural differences.  Most important thing is developing a sense of trust 
with people. When trying to reconstruct an event to report to someone else most 
westerners communicate in a linear narrative fashion. Asian crew members recall stories 
in a more random fashion. Time line is not as important as the significance of the event. 
difficult to find really good interpreters.

The firm represented the west gulf maritime assoc. in labor matters. Good relationship 
with the union workers. Back then they drank like fish and they figured out can drink 
with them. Used to start with gin and tonic and then switch to tonic thereafter. These 
were men who ran the stevedores and companies, not the big corporate giants as of now. 
Were almost mom and pop operations. There would be no decisions taken without a few 
drinks. Had to drink with them. They were probably chronic alcoholics. Not necessarily 
educated. Absolutely fascinating practice. One funny events that happened was with of 
person who had worked his way up through the ranks, the arbitration had to do something 
with practices back in 1947 and he was the only one around who remembered something 
from 1947. Cornered him and asked him, and he answered something that was 
completely the opposite of what he had said earlier. Nowadays during depositions, know 
pretty much what everyone is going to say. There are no surprises. Back then it really 
tested ability as a stand up lawyer to react to surprises. Have been counsel for fringe 
benefits fund for 30 years now. Interesting relationship because there is a great deal of 
trust, very rewarding.  
 
01:00:16 
Remember people talking about the strike of 68. Joined in 1974. Started working in 
WGMA in 1980. Before the permits to carry concealed weapons were around, pretty 
much everyone that was union or management was armed. Were at the end of a meeting, 
and there was a .38 caliber cartridge on the floor. 4-5 guys looked up and said "No it's not 
mine." 
 
01:03:00 
Personalities that worked together and persevered with each other, would come out and 
be at odds with each other. Jointly administering their fringe benefit plans. The only thing 
that concerned us was the sole benefit of the participants but it taught people how to deal 
with each other and work constructively.  
 
01:04:17 
Had a pension plan which has now been phased out. A fine benefit plan - if worked 30 
years, sufficient hours, got a monthly annuity, spouse got annuity after husband's death. 
Always had a welfare fund it now works out of New York. It was a Cadillac plan. They 
had a reserve of a year to cover medical expenses, back when there were 9 million man 
hours. 15,000 people. Healthcare costs started increasing and started running out of 
money. In 1990 Actuaries came down and put a date; present burn rate this would be over 
 
 
in a particular date. Though union had to sacrifice a lot, was interesting to see them work 
through that. Recognized the threat of automation and containerization very soon. 
Depleted man power. Welfare is covered by MILA.  
 
01:11:25 
Containerization and automation has greatly affected the number of jobs. Consolidation 
and non local ownership. Stevedore companies are now not locally owned and controlled. 
"The bean counters have taken over." Back in the 50s and 60s ships would be at port for 
two weeks. People would stay at sea farers club, Nowadays ships only stay for 36 hours. 
No homogenous crews anymore. Used to be strict before. Now everything is mixed. 
Going to least costly labor supplies. While Philippines has benefited from this, they are 
now running out of Filipinos and the more prosperous people get the less time they want 
to spend at sea. A lot of Eastern Europeans still go out to sea. 
 
01:!5:48 
Fewer personal injuries. International standards in procedures. Safety at sea regulations. 
Into fatigue regulations. Safety standards have improved. Better electronic devices. 
Radar, AIS, separation scheme outside of Galveston. Used to have 2-3 collisions every 
week, Standards have come up. Open id. Consequently there are fewer maritime 
attorneys around. Everything used to go through NY. TWIC card, 9/11, security. Sludge 
produced by the engines instead of incinerating or filtering it out, just dumping it over the 
side. US laws states that must keep a record of any oily waste that is produced off the 
ship and the processing of the waste. People are caught because of bad record keeping 
ways. General decline in the quality of training, experience in the crews. May just be 
fatigue. More paperwork to be done. New radio system have meant no radio operator 
who as essentially the captain's secretary. So no one to do paperwork.  
 
01:23:12 
50 years ago people were not worried about oil being spilt in the water. Now someone 
has to be held responsible. Logically it would be the ship's master.  
 
01:25:30 
I-610 bridge. TO bring ships into the Turin Basin, have to lower the boom. 610 has a 
clearance of 135 ft. Got a call when ship hit the bridge, boom was facing forward, caught 
underneath the structure and out the pavement. 3 automobiles were involved. To come 
under the a bridge like the 610 which is low, chief officer has to do an air draft 
calculation. He has to confirm whether the ship can pass safely underneath. He gave the 
command for the boom to be lowered. He spoke in a Polish accent in English. The person 
lowering the boom was a Filipino who may not have understood what he was saying. 
(Makes gesture) Boom did not get lowered. 6 months later, another ship from the same 
company with Ukrainian officer and Filipino crew did exactly the same time with a little 
more damage. Coastguard was livid. For 2 years after that, every time a ship from that 
company wanted to come through they had to stop at Barber's Cut, get a surveyor on and 
 
 
confirm that the boom was down and could pass through. Houston pilots have a $1000 
limitation of liability.  
 
01:32:05 
As a brand new partner at the firm. Galoptic Sun was a 100 miles offshore. Third officer 
had on a iron mike (autopilot) and had forgotten to calculate the set and drift. Clips brand 
new platform, rips open three tanks on the side and there is a fire storm on the ship. Fire 
melted the lifeboats, windows, glass. 7 Filipino crew members died. Norwegian chief 
engineer had his wife on board. They jumped into the water and were found by a Cajun 
crew.  
 
Have not had a mutiny in ages. Master would sometimes have problems with the crew 
with threats of physical violence. Once ship was parked next to wrecked fish meal barge. 
Had a brand new master who did not honor overtime deals. Spanish basque crew. 
Norwegian management. Launch operator asked him to keep the ship running. Turned it 
into a labor dispute. And paid them what was due.  
Either the master will call directly or the company will call the club and the club assigns 
a person.  
 
01:40:52 
Collegiality in the bar as an admiralty lawyer. Makes it very enjoyable. Most of them are 
old friends. Things are handled with great stability.
