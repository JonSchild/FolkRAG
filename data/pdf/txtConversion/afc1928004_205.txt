When de stars come peeping out, 
And de moon shimmers o'er de sea, 
Soft we creep from de hut, to dance Fandango 
Under de Mango tree! 
CRORES — Under de Mango tree, caramba! 
Under de Mango tree! 
Under de Mango tree, Caramba 
Under de Mango tree! 
By de cane-piece dere's a 
boy 
A- waiting all de time for me, 
To ax me to dance de grand Fandango, 
Under de Mango tree! 
(CHORUS.) 
Before I 
saw dat sweetie, 
I 
was gay as a 
bird and free, 
But he won my bib at de fust Fandango, 
Under de Mango tree! 
(CHORUS) 
My heart quivers like a 
leaf, 
De moment I 
dat darky see ; 
For I 
t'ink oh de time we danced Fandango, 
Under de Mango tree I 
(CHORUS.) 
Oh! what will my mudder say ? 
Whateber shall I 
say to she? 
When she hears I've been to de grand Fandango, 
Under de Mango tree!

• C. II. Dersos 
Co., 711 Broadway, -New York. 
He comes to see me every night, 
To see and nothing more; 
At first I 
used to feel delight, 
But now he's just a 
bore ; 
I 
can't endure his awkward ways, 
Nor art can I 
employ 
To make him speak a 
single phrase, 
He's such a 
bashful boy! 
SPONEN—Yes indeed, he's awful. 
He'll come in and say." Oh, 
good- evening." or something like that, you know, and say, per-
haps, it has been a 
nice day, and that yesterday intght have been 
a 
nice day if it hadn't rained. "%Veil, of course I must do the 
agreeable. I 
give him a 
chair and tell him to sit down, and take 
his hat, and so on, you know 
and if I 
Want to fish for compli-
ments, I 
say that I 
must look horrid the way I'm fixed, and that 
I 
didn't have time to do up my hair, I 
was so busy. 
Of course 
anybody else would say, " Oh,trot at all—you look very charm-
ing. I'm sure." 
But he—gracious me, he doesn't know enough 
for that. 
He's 50 stupid. 
Well, no one can expect much from 
him when— 
mot-
Its. 
He loves me much, he does I 
know, 
But oh, he will not tell me so, 
And what to do I 
do not know, 
He's such a 
bashful lx.y. 
He sits beside me, lifts his eyes, 
His love so fond to show, 
And when he to my speech 
"Fis replies,
but a " yes " or " no." 
I 
hint, but hints are all in vain, 
His mind they don't annoy ; 
He never makes his feelings plain, 
He's such a 
bashful boy I 
SPOREN—He's got it had, He has me perfectly distracted. 
He never takes me anywhere, never has any news. i 
ever goes 
to a ha'', never walks on the avenue never does any thing, in 
fact, that a 
person ought to do under the circumstances. 
Totten 
give him a 
piece ( truly mind— when he knocks all the peace ont 
of it. 
But somehow he wins me beck twain, aid comes the same 
as ever, and doesn't improve at all. 
I 
believe I 
can sever do arty 
thing with him, and the reason is, you know— 
(CHORUS.) 
My hand he squeezes very hard, 
And never says a 
word, 
And sighs so oft and looks so soft, 
His conduct looks absurd. 
But every genius has his whim, 
Which time can ne'er destroy, 
And so I 
think I'll stick to him, 
Though he's a 
bashful boy ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, I 
have discovered I 
hat he has some aood points, 
and that one mu- t 
have great care in cultivating his acquaint-
ance in order to find them out. 1 
shell wait pat iently tor a 
while, 
but. I'll not depend on him lor company. No indeed. 
I'll just 
hold him in r, serve, you know. 
In the mean nine. I 
can only 
express my deep regret that— (Cnon us.) 
The Irish Speculator. 
Since you call for a 
song, why, I'll sing 3-ou that same, 
And if I 
should fail, your indulgence I 
claim ; 
And that you may know me, I'll tell you my name, 
I'm Phelim O'Patrick, an Irish boy. 
T 
once speculated the whole of my cash, 
To rise in the world or tumble down smash ; 
I 
must have been cracked when my money I 
spent, 
For like a 
cracked thing- all to pieces I 
went. 
Hubbery, hubbery, bother and strife—. 
I 
wish I 
were dead to get rid of my life, 
For in this world I 
find no joy, 
I'm Phelim O'Patrick, an Irish boy. 
He's Such a 
Lovely Waltzer.

He takes me 2
-ently round the waist, 
He holds his arm just so, 
I 
place my willing hand in his, 
And gayly off we go. 
He's never weary of the dance, 
And I'm about the same, 
And when the music sounds no more, 
I 
cry, " Oh, what a 
shame !" 
SPOKEN—Ye, indeed, I'm quite sorry when the dance Is over; 
it seems like awaking from a 
sweet little sleep. 
Of course, my 
Charlie is the whole cause of it, because, you know, 
CHORUS— He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
So graceful he can go ; 
He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
My Charlie, my Charlie, my beau. 
I 
can't endure these old quadrilles 
And reels— oh, gracious, (iota— 
Do it speak of them, if you insist, 
I 
plainly say, I 
won't ; 
Pm far above those worn-out things, 
They're much too full- of halts, 
No dance to me can ever bring 
Such pleasure as the waltz. 
SPOKEN—Ah, he's such a 
glorious fellow I When the dance is 
over we walk in the garden, and if there happens to be a 
bright 
moon . wn on us from the sky, he often tells me that 
he wonders which look the most glorious, the moon or my eyes. 
I 
say. hush, don't talk nonsense. 
But then I 
don't care what he 
says—my admiration of him is based upon the fact that—(Ctio.) 
With merry strains from jolly Strauss, 
And gleaming lights around, 
Our forms entwined, our joys combined, 
We hear the gladsome sound. 
We think no more of worldly woe 
While quickly flies the time, 
The music comes so sweet and low, 
I 
think it quite sublime. 
SrokEN—Sublime, did I 
say 
Yes, that's just the word. I 
TlItiy seem a 
little enthusiastic, but 1 
can't help it. 
It's all be-
cadge— . (Cnonus.)

Lies she with closed eyes, 
Calmly at rest; 
Hands meekly folded 
On her still breast; 
Peaceful the smile 
On her quiet face, 
Calm, gentle vision 
Of pure, holy grace. 
Fm iends gather round her, 
But not to weep, 
Knowing their darling 
Is only asleep. 
Gone are her troubles, 
All now are o'er ; 
Naught of this life's struggles 
Knoweth she more. 
Soothed is our grief 
While this thought we keep: 
Not gone forever, 
No! only asleep. 
Friends gather round her, etc.

liVe all made love to pretty girls, 
Whom we met here and there, 
But I 
know one, with dark-blue eyes 
And a 
tress of golden hair. 
I 
saw her at her father's house, 
'Mid flowers, blooming sweet, 
Her smiling face, her winning ways, 
My heart made faster beat. 
CHORUS. 
But as of yore, she's mine no more— 
It's a 
dream of days gone by, 
I 
often think of moments sweet 
When we met on the sly. 
We went together every where, 
Though " ma" would oft object, 
But papa smiled, he thought no harm, 
And said, " That's all correct." 
The other boys would no more call, 
For I 
was then her pet; 
But I 
did make a 
sad mistake, 
Else I 
would be it yet. (Cuonos.) 
I 
did not please her " ma " enough, 
I 
need not tell you bow ; 
But for this capital offense 
I'm no more wanted now. 
I 
would advise you all, my friends, 
If you should meet this elf, 
To fix it right with mammie first, 
" 
ion know how ' tis myself." (CHoRus.)

Last night I 
lay slumb'ring, awake and alone, 
And deamin' of you, darlin' Widow Mavrone. 
I 
saw standing there at the foot of my bed 
A terrible ghost in blue blazes and red ; 
And who do you think was the spirit that came, 
While talkin' to you in my beautiful drame ? 
The sorra one else but yourTiusband, Dan Lee ; 
" 
What troubles you, Daniel ?" says I; and says Ile : 
" 
Go, Barney, tell Biddy, my wife that's my widdy, 
I 
want her to marry some dacent young man, 
Like you, who would treat her with kindness, the 
craytimr, 
As I 
did when living, her own loving Dan. 
" 
Then Barney," ses he, " on the night ye's are wid, 
I'll come and rn tell ye the place where I 
hid 
A. big crock of goohl, that I 
found as I 
dug 
One day in the field by the side of the bog. 
Coming borne to tell Biddy, I 
stopped in at the fair, 
And got drunk and was killed at the fight that was 
there ; 
But I 
can't go to rest till ye're joined in wedlock, 
And Biddy has got the contents of the crock. 
For it's you I 
would choose to step into my shoes, 
And make me poor widdy so happy and blest, 
For I 
know that you want her, then tell her I'll haunt 
her 
Until ye's are married, then I'll go to rest." 
The blooming young widow looked thoughtful and 
sly, 
Gave Barney a 
glance from her roguish black eye, 
That told him quite plainly she could not be sold, 
Be frightened by ghosts, nor be bought for bog 
gold. 
"Oh, Barney, this dreadful to think that poor Dan 
Is shItt out from glory till some other man 
Is found that his brogans will easily suit 
; 
Steps into his shoes and his breeches to boot ; 
- 
But you are too small—they won't fit you at all, 
I But Murphy is just of Dan's figure and make ; 
' 
So he's gone for the priest in Dan's shoes, coat and 
vest, 
For I 
promised to have him the night of Dan's 
wake. 
Sunshine .and Shade. 
The brightest day that ever shone 
May be a 
while o'ereast ; 
Should passing clouds obscure the sun, 
'Tis brighter when they're past ! 
This life of ours is even so 
With joy and gloom inlaid— 
Who breathes its air must learn to share 
The sunshine and the shade. 
The tear may rise to dim the smile, 
A 
smile to gild the tear; 
So after lovers' angry words 
The kind ones seem more dear; 
Yes, ever so! old sorrows die, 
New pleasures flower and fade, 
Then calmly learn to bear in turn 
The sunshine and the shade.

PETERS, owner of the copyright and Music 
Publisher, 599 Broadway, New York. 
One day I 
took an omnibus 
To have a 
pleasant ride, 
'Twas full, exactly six of us 
Were crowded on each side: 
A fat girl there—oh, sad mishap! 
A ton of silk and lace— 
She plumped herself down on my lap— 
Put yourself in my place ! 
Cnonts—How you would act I 
do not know, 
If it was in your case, 
Just fancy, now, my feelings, oh, 
Put yourself in my place! 
One night I 
had been dining out, 
And went home feeling " queer;" 
So softly then I 
crept about 
Lest any one should hear; 
Miss Nibbs, an old maid, I 
mistook, 
And clasped with fond embrace ! . 
She screamed, while I 
with terror shook— 
Put yourself in my place! 
(CHORUS.) 
I 
went to see my girl, one night, 
She sat down by my side; 
She was the sweetest, fairest sight, 
It could not be denied ; 
Quite fascinated by her charms 
And by her pretty face, 
I 
hugged her fondly in my arms— 
Put yourself in my place ! (Cnonuso

While gathering tiny shells amid the wavelets 
At Long Branch, one fair summer afternoon, 
I 
met a 
little laughing, dark-eyed gipsy, 
She was warbling a 
sweet operatic tune ; 
Her winning ways would drive a 
saint to madness, 
Such a 
saucy little witch was never seen; 
Three summers she has been the belle of Long Branch 
And her pretty name is Gipsy Victorine. 
C11011.1.TS. 
With roguish eyes and smile so sweet, 
In fashion always dressed complete, 
We gayly walked together by the sea- shore, 
Or wandered by the moonlight's silver sheen ; 
She can sing and dance as light as any fairy, 
Can this laughing little beauty, Victorine. 
Her laugh is like a 
flood of rippling music, 
As it floats upon the dreamy summer air; 
Her starry eyes with mischief ever dancing, 
They're enough to drive a 
fellow to despair; 
Her raven ringlets set the beaux a-raving, 
She perambulates as proud as any queen ; 
Yet she greets me ever with a 
smile of sweetness, 
Does my darling little Gipsy Victorine. (Cno.) 
For the happy time that's coming I 
am waiting 
So anxiously, for her I've asked to wed ; 
She whispered " Yes" with such seraphic sweetness, 
On my bosom laid her darling curly head. 
When the birdies sing their songs in happy springtime, 
In a 
cosy cottage near a 
woodland green, 
Far happier than a " Morning Star " or " Sunflower," 
I'll luxuriate with Gipsy Victorine. (CHo.) 
J. F. SHERIDAN'S POPULAR SONG. 
Copied by permis!-ion of Wm. A. POND & CO., Music Publishers,

Good- evening, friends, I 
hope you're well, 
A story to you I 
will tell, 
How head and ears in love I 
fell 
With a 
dashing, gay brunette. 
The first time that I 
met her 
I 
was riding in a 
car, 
A 
L4-en ,leman was N‘ith her, 
I 
think it was her pa; 
I 
arose and said, " Will you accept my seat :e" 
She bowed and thanked me with a 
smile so sweet, 
This dashing, gay brunette. 
We smiled and flirted as on we rode, 
I 
followed her to her abode, 
Into her band I 
slipped a 
note, 
Asking if I 
might on her call; 
Next day I 
got an answer, 
It filled me with delight, 
Stating I 
might call on her 
The coming Sunday night. 
I 
read and read her letter o'er again, 
I 
thought myself the luckiest of men, 
My dashing, gay brunette. 
At the appointed hour I 
rung the bell, 
'Twas answered 'by my little Nell, 
Her blushing face at once did tell 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
hide it, so 
I 
told her of my love, 
And vowed I 
would be true to her 
As the stars above. 
She said that she could love none else but me, 
So next week I 
am going to married be 
To my dashing, gay brunette.

Life is real, life is dual, 
Single blessedness a 
fib ; 
" 
Man's thou art, to man returnest," 
Has been spoken of the rib. 
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, 
Is our destined end or way ; 
But to act that each to-morrow 
Brings us nearer marriage- day. 
Life is long and youth is fleeting, 
And our hearts, though light and gay, 
Still like merry drums are beating 
Wedding-marches all the way. 
In the world's broad field of battle, 
In the bivouac of life, 
Be not like dumb, driven cattle— 
Be some hen-pecked husband's wife. 
Our grandmothers' lives remind us 
We can make our lives sublime, 
Leaving little tracks behind us, 
Footprints on the sands of time. 
Let us, then, be up and doing, 
With a 
heart on triumph set; 
Still contriving, still pursuing, 
Till we each a 
husband get.

A. world of trouble we live in, 
A world of strife and eaTe— 
Where often disappointment makes 
Our load too much to bear; 
But never let the spirit sink, 
Look up, be firm and strong, 
And let your golden maxim be— 
To always push along. 
CHORUS. 
Push along! push alpng! fight your way along! 
Never mind a 
fall, boys, go it twice as strong ; 
Push along! straight along! fight your way along! 
Let your motto be—push along! 
If things go not just as you wish, 
Don't give up in despair; 
Think not you never can succeed, 
This is not acting fair; 
But try again, and then perchance 
Your plan& may not go wrong, 
And never fail to mark the rule 
And always push along. (Cnonus.)

Oh, there's something I'm dying to say, 
Though I 
hardly know how to begin 
But to lose ij.n occasion like this 
-Would be foolish as well as a 
sin ; 
So now, then, for better or worse, 
I 
must surely proceed on my way; 
But, dear me, oh I 
how dreadful it is 
To have something you're dying to say. 
CHORUS—
Something I'm dying to say— 
There's something I'm dying to say; 
But dear me, how dreadful it is 
To have something you're dying to say. 
When you choose a 
nice spot in the woods, 
And your handkerchief spread on the ground, 
And the fair one invite, with a 
blush, 
To partake of the seat you have found, 
And then, if she smiling consent, 
You most awkwardly stand in the way, 
Then you cough—that's as fa7. as you get 
In the something you're dying to say. (Clio.) 
Or perhaps then, with courage renewed, 
You will tremblingly sit yourself down, 
She inquiringly looks in your face, 
Then you carefully look all around ; 
And now with an effort so great, 
As you think of the chance that you've got, 
Say, under your breath, " Dearest girl, 
I 
think that the weather is hot." (Cm.)

This world to some seems like a 
field 
Where naught but weeds will grow, 
While many less deserving, 
Often reap what others sow; 
Some are always up and doing, 
Others pine and mope, 
And forget the good old saying— 
" 
-While there's life there's hope." 
CHORUS. 
Should fortune frown upon you, 
Or dark thoughts interlope, 
Banish them at once, my boys, 
For " while there's life there's hope." 
Let's watch you noble vessel, 
With her happy crew on deck, 
Ere long upon the waves she's dashed, 
A dull and dismal wreck; 
Her boats are lost, her mainmast gone, 
But clinging to the rope, 
You hear her seamen whisper still— 
" 
While there's life there's hope." (Cuo.) 
The miner underneath the ground 
Toils on from day to day, 
In darkness and oblivion 
His life is passed away; 
With sad mishap or deadly damp 
He often has to cope, 
His comfort still, while waiting help, 
Is, " while there's life there's hope." (Cuo.) 
Pride of the Ball. 
CHAS. M. CONNOLLY'S POPULAR SONG. 
Exclusive permission to use thi-, song granted to Beadle & Adams 
by J. L. PETEns, owner of the copyright and Music 
Publisher, 599 Broadway, New York. 
You've heard of the heavy swells 
That strut around so gay, 
And talk of wine and style 
In such a 
flashy way; 
But all this noise is not 
The sort of thing for me, 
The pleasures of the dance 
With my tastes most agree. 
CHORUS—The pet and the pride of the ball, yes! 
For I 
am the pride of the ball, 
Tripping gayly, so gayly, 
In the charming, sweet, (1
,
glitful waltz. 
I'm noted far and near 
For easy, quiet grace, 
I'm not a " Rollickin' Ram," 
hi noise I'm out of place ; 
Let heavy swells drink wine, 
And ape the " Roman fall," 
But quiet pleasure best 
Suits me, the pride of the ball. (CH0.) 
No picture half so sweet 
And charming can there be, 
As in a 
brilliant hall 
The charming sight to see, 
Of beauty, youth and style, 
Aglow with pleasure all, 
Alt, then indeed ' tis sweet 
To be the pride of the ball. (Ono.)

They say success in life depends, 
By old and young we bear it said, 
With plenty cash and lots of friends, 
You're always right and go ahead. 
The Bulls and Bears will corner gold, 
And water stocks their shares to spread, 
Then buy up dupes with what they sold, 
Beat all they can, then go ahead. 
CHORUS. 
This maxim always keep in view, 
Fools rush where angels fear to tread, 
Whatever path you may pursue, 
Be sure you're right, then go ahead. 
In politics some make their pile, 
And gamble like a 
thoroughbred, 
Big diamonds wear and sport the style, 
Fast horses drive and go ahead. 
The poor man sweats at honest toil, 
And labors hard to earn his bread, 
Works at the forge and tills the soil 
From morn till eve, to go ahead. 
When a 
poor fellow's broken down, 
His pockets dry and nary red, 
At his misfortunes never frown, 
Give him a 
lift and go ahead. 
The game of life will soon be o'er, 
Old Death is trumps and spades are led, 
The deal is up ! we play no more, 
Pass in your checks and go ahead.

The Increase of Crime.

C. II. DrrsoN & Co., 711 Broadway, New York. 
I've been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely defioe, 
I've been thinking why people should wondel• 
At the fearful increase of crime. 
Cries old Uncle Sam, " It's a 
poser, 
There's something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
We can boast we have plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks they have all they can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world, we are told, sir, 
Yet still there's an increase of crime." 
It's true, as you say, Uncle Sammy, 
We've abundance of gold stored away, 
And why should we leave it there useless, 
To be guarded by night and by day ? 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself may confine, 
What a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In the terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
jot, sir, 
Politicians you feed the whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man with hunger may rot, sir, 
Uncle Sam, can you wonder at crime ? 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on their beat 
Arresting the poor, hungry fellow, 
For earning his bread in the street, 
While a 
thief on the corner is grinning ? 
In the broad open light of the day 
Our pcckets he'll pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law can not touch him, they say. 
While he laughs with contempt and derision, 
Defies the whole police division, 
The poor fellow you'll throw into prison 
Uncle Sam, can you wonder at crime? 
It is true what I 
say, and you'll own it, 
Temptation is near to the poor, 
They see many fearful examples, 
From honesty's way to allure; 
Just look at your fine politicians, 
All ready for bribery's hand, 
Just look how the innocent suffer, 
While the guilty are lords of the land; 
Then open for them the dark prison, 
Let Justice, like one newly risen, 
Their guilt on their foreheads emblazon, 
And then we may wonder at crime. 
Just think, while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our Union are fed ; 
While you with your rich folks can dine, sir 
'Tis a 
Godsend to them to get bread. 
Go, visit the homes of the poor, sir, 
Such a 
sight you will never behold ; 
The prison- dens go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold ; 
When a 
little would soon break asunder 
The chain that the poor suffer under, 
Go and list to that great cry of hunger, 
And nevermore wonder at crime.

Let others praise the ruby bright 
In the red wine's sparkling glow— 
Dearer to me is the diamond light 
Of the fountain's clearest flow. 
The feet of earthly men have trod 
The juice from the bleeding vine; 
But the streams come pure from the hand of God 
To fill this cup of mine. 
Cllonus—Then give me a 
cup of cold water, 
The clear, sweet cup of cold water; 
For his arm is strong, though his toil is long, 
Who drinks but the clear, cold water. 
The dew-drops lie in the floweret's cup— 
How rich is the perfume now ! 
And the fainting earth with joy looks up 
When the rain falls on her brow ; 
The brook gives forth with a 
pleasant voice 
To gladden the vale along, 
And the bending trees on her banks rejoice 
To hear her quiet song. 
CHORUS— Then give me a 
cup of cold water, 
The clear, sweet cup of cold water ; 
For bright is his eye, and his spirit high, 
Who drinks but the clear, cold water. 
The lark soars up with a 
lighter strain 
When the wave has dashed his wing, 
And the steed flings back his flowing mane 
In the might of the crystal spring. 
This was the drink of Paradise, 
Ere blight on her beauty fell, 
And the buried streams'of her gladness rise 
In every nios-grown well. 
Cnonus—Then here's to the cup of cold water, 
The pure, sweet cup of cold water ; 
For nature gives to all that lives 
But a 
drink of the clear, cold water.

Now is it not a 
pity 
Such a 
pretty girl as I 
Should be sent to a 
nunnery, 
To pine' away and die? 
CHORUS. 
But I 
won't be a nun, no I 
won't be a 
rum ; 
I'm So fond of pleasure, that I 
can not be a 
nun. 
I'm sure I 
can not tell 
What the mischief I 
have done; 
But my mother often tells me 
That I 
must be a 
nun. (Cllonus.) 
I 
could not bear confinement, 
No it would not do . for me, 
For I 
like to go a-shopping, 
And to see -what I 
can see. (Cnonus) 
I 
love to hear men flattering— 
Love fashionable clothes 
I 
love music and dancing, 
And chatting with the beaux. (Cno.) 
So, mother, don't be angry, now, 
But let your daughter be, 
For the nuns would not like to have 
A novice wild as me. (Cao.)

As I 
stroll'd out one evening 
When the silver moon was shining 
And the little stars were twinkling, 
'Twas in the month of June; 
I 
chanced to meet a 
beauty, 
So sylph-like, neat mid pretty, 
With pouting lips like ruby 
Peach-blossoms in full bloom; 
And as she came up nearer, 
her sweet face met my view, 
My heart spoke with a 
whisper— 
" 
Fair maiden, I 
love you!" 
REFRAIN. 
Oh, yes, yes, yes ! she's all the world to me, 
Oh, no, no, no ! there's none as sweet as she, 
Her bright blue eyes bewitching had pierced me 
through and through, 
My heart seems ever whisp'ring, " Pair maiden, I 
love 
you." 
Each day my love grew stronger, 
And I 
couldn't wait any longer; 
At last I 
did approach her 
With " Lady, please excuse, 
Though often I 
have seen you 
And wished so much to know you— 
In truth, fair maid, I 
love you, 
My suit please don't refuse !" 
She smiled and said, " Don't flatter, 
If what you say be true, 
It gives me joy and pleasure, 
I 
think I 
might love you!" 
(REFRAIN.) 
That evening when we parted 
She told me then her secret, 
One which I 
hold as sacred 
And never shall reveal. 
The roses were a- blooming, 
The gentle breeze perfuming; 
She said, in words so loving— 
" 
My name is Lulu Bell." 
Each evening we're together 
Our woes and cares are few, 
She loves to hear me whisper 
" 
Dear Lulu, I 
love you!"

Fled like a

Homes that were lovely and pleasant, 
Now by the clouds overcast! 
u 
Over the heart'of the cif, 
Swept the red flames in their ire 
All the bright hopes of the future 
Lost, lost in the terrible fire. 
CHORUS. 
Lost, bear the sad cry of anguish— 
Lost by the tempest so dire! 
All the bright hopes of the future 
Lost, lost in the terrible fire. 
Wild as the storms of the ocean, 
Sounded the message of doom; 
Blotting the stars from the azure, 
Fell 
e 
dark mantle of gloom. 
Gone, like the blossoms of summer, 
Rent by the brand fierce and dire, 
All that was cherished and treasured, 
Lost, lost in the terrible five. 
Up from the ruins around us, 
Soon we shall rise in our might ! 
Just as the dawn of the morning 
Follows the darkness of night. 
So from despair and affliction 
May we forever aspire! 
Upward and onward our motto 
Tried, tried, but not lost in the fire. (Cm.)

Mother Says I 
Mustn't, 
G. W. MINT'S COMIC SONG. 
I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl 
A few short years ago, 
All sorts of weather, lain or hail, 
To court her I 
would go ; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time to be away, 
Andowhen I 
asked a 
parting kiss 
She always used to say : 
CHORUS. 
Oh, mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't, 
Oh, George, please George, not just yet awhile ; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't, 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I " waiting" kept ; at last, one day, 
rthought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed ?" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said: 
SPOKEN—W ell, George, you're very kind, but we could nerer 
live on two ho tithed a 
year, so until you are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— (Cnouus.) 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no s!one unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year 
At last I 
really earned 
Selina heard how things had changed, 
And when we met, one day, 
She seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovitwly did say : 
SPOKEN—Yon remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you 
33 
asked me smile time ago? 
Well, George, dear, as you have so 
improved in circumstances, sit pose you ask me now, Georgy 
Porgy, darling. elt-, what say ?W. ell, said I, upon considerat 
you're very kind, but— (Ctiouus.) 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves hint for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf ; 
All sordid-minded damsels who 
May ‘vorship golden dross, 
May they be old maids till they die, 
And we'll never feel their loss. 
SPOICEN—SO 
ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you 
don't once too often say— (Cnonus.)

Violets, violets, blossoming low, 
Deep in the greenest of mosses that grow, 
Daisies and buttercups over the grass, 
Nodding and bowing to me as I 
pass; 
Snowdrops and lilies, your cool fragrant bells, 
hiding away in the dim, dreamy dells, 
Tell me the secret I'm wailing to know— 
Whisper it softly and whisper it low 
Say, is he coining? 
Say, is he ? 
Yes, or no? 
Yes, or no ? 
Mocking- bird, trilling your wondcrful song, 
Floating in sunshine the valleys along, 
Robins, that sing 'mid the cherry-tree's bloom, 
Blackbirds that whistle from yon golden broom, 
Silver waves plashing on low shining sands, 
Southern winds breathing of far, spicy lands, 
Tell me the secret I'm waiting to know 
Whisper it softly and whisper it low: 
Say, is he coming ? 
Say, is he coming ? etc. 
A

I'm a 
fella who doesn't like bothar, 
All trouble's a 
deuce of a 
bore, 
I've an income left me by my mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
felth do more ? 
My favorite sport's killing time, 
My aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some through this world run or climb, 
I 
take the trip easy and crawl. 
CHORUS—But they tell me I'm awfully clevar, 
Oh, so clevar, deuced clevar; 
They say they nevar, no nevar 
Met a 
fella so clevar before. 
Some fellas go in for the army, 
And some lento go in for trade, 
But I 
haven't such bores to annoy me, 
My fortune was already made; 
And some fellas go in for brains, 
And scribble to turn in a 
penny— 
Those fellas deserve a! their gains, 
As for brains, I 
could do without any. (Ono.) 
In the Park I 
am often seen driving, 
When the dear girls take me for a 
duke, 
Whenever I 
go in for billiards, 
Somehow I'm a 
demon to fluke; 
Sometimes to an evening party, 
To keep them alive, in I 
peep, 
Whenever they ask me to sing 
They're certain to fall fast asleep. (Cuo.) 
Some fellas will borrow a 
termer, 
For which I 
get no I. 0. U., 
Sometimes I 
assist them in bills, 
Which I 
have to pay when they're due; 
There are mothers with daughters to marry, 
Somehow take a 
fatcy to me; 
They think they're as deep as Old Harry, 
But the bait and the hook I 
can see. (Cno.)

I'm over head and ears in love 
(The truth I'll tell) with a 
turtle-dove ; 
She ought to be in the skies above, 
An angel she should be. 
Her laughing eyes, with a 
dimpled chin, 
IIer face so sweet arid fair, 
IIer looks so neat and so complete, 
With a 
mass of silk- like hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, prettily she dances on her pretty little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tuberose, 
Charms all people., as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar- plum. 
This luscious little sugar-plum 
Was introduced to the one you see 
At a 
masked ball, where I 
had such fun, 
Every one was in such glee; 
This joyous night my heart felt light 
With gleams of future bliss, 
When paving at the dawn of day, 
I 
was wrapt in happiness. (Cnortus.) 
I'm with her every night at eight, 
We walk and talk in ecstatic bliss ; 
Of her I'm proud and feel elate, 
She's all my happiness. 
I'll feel so gay when the knot is tied, 
The time will soon advance, 
When she will be my treasured bride 
We'll be " par excellence." (CrtoRus)

Pm waiting alone by the stile, Nora, darling, 
The place where you've met me so often before, 
And whispered so sweetly, I 
love you, my Barney ; 
Oh, why do you care, love, to greet me no more ? 
Estranged from you, life seems so bitter and lonely, 
Without your dear love, Nora, darling, I'd die; 
I've wept for you oft since you left me in anger, 
Down here by the stile, without kissing good-by! 
CHORUS. 
Forgive me, and come back again to your Barney, 
The angels will bless you, mavourneen achree; 
Oh, dry those sad tears that forever are falling; 
My Nora, my darling, oh, come back to me. 
Oh, have you forgotten your promise, mavourneen, 
You gave me the night when we met by the stream ? 
With your head on my bosom, you told me you loved 
me, 
Then earth like a 
heaven to me, darling, did seem. 
'Tis little I 
dreamed then of sorrow or sadness,' 
Or felt in my heart that you'd break that fond vow; 
Another may win thee, but none in this wide world 
Can give you the love that I 
feel for you now. 
The birds in the woodland sing sweetly as ever, 
The streamlet is flowing as placid and bright ; 
My heart is as true to you, loving and yearning, 
And weeps for you, darling, both morning and night. 
Perhaps when I'm gone, and the daisies bloom, o'er me, 
You'll come in the twilight and weep o'er my grave, 
And mourn for the true heart that loved you so fondly, 
For one who'd have died you sweet darling to save.

He Had Such Taking Ways. 
POPULAR COMIC SONG FOR LADIES. 
Exclusive permission to use this song granted to Beadle & Adams

Publisher, 599 Broadway, New York. 
Ali, me! he was a 
nice man— 
Such taking ways he had ! 
He took my hand one summer eve— 
My hand in jewels clad— 
He whispered such delightful words, 
Such sweet, poetic things, 
And all the while his fingers played 
Among my diamond rings. 
CHORUS—He's gone, he's gone to Sing Sing, 
He's vanished from my gaze, 
This coaxing, charming, nice young man 
That had such taking ways. 
How could I 
doubt when playfully 
lie took my solitaire? 
He did it with such gorgeous words 
And such a 
splendid air ! 
Or even when he broke my brooch, 
And took it off to mend, 
I'm sure the darling fellow 
Did not do it to offend. (Cnonus.) 
But 
there came one wretched eve— 
The last he spent with me— 
He stayed till very late indeed, 
And going, took the key— 
The key that locked the pantry door, 
Where all the plate was stored; 
And then lie took his leave--a 
kiss— 
And called me " his adored." (Cnonus.) 
;

Next morn the silver all was gone, 
Papa was dreadful cool, 
I 
said ' twas not Adolphus Bing, 
He said I 
was a 
fool! 
Papa took means to prove me wrong, 
They caught Adolphus Bing— 
The plate was found, but nothing e'er 
Was heard of brooch or ring. (Cuonus.)

What's life without its pleasures 
To help pass time away ? 
What is the use of grieving 
And fretting, day by day ? 
Too short indeed is life, 
So, while here we do abide, 
Let's always try to look upon 
The pleasant, bright, gay side. 
Cnouus—The gay side, the bright side, 
Let's always look on the gay side ; 
For life is short, so, while we're here. 
Let's look on the gay side of life. 
Why borrow care and trouble ? 
Why think of them at all ? 
Look always on the bright side, 
Let not the spirits fall ; 
For life may be made pleasant 
If this rule be your guide: 
To always try to look upon 
Its pleasant, bright, gay side. ( Cnon-cs.)

And through life to contentedly sail ; 
With jolly companions so gay, 
I 
always am sure to be found, 
And noisily with them, quite oft, 
I've rolled home while the milk was going round. 
There is wisdom in my plan of life, 
To enjoy myself oft as I

I 
try to avoid care and strife, 
Which is surely the pleasantest way ; 
In the sparkling and life-giving wine 
All sorrow and trouble I 
drown, 
Day and night fun and frolic I 
court, 
And roll home while the milk is going round.

My beau was a 
broker 
Of great wealth and beauty ; 
A 
man of fine quality, 
Fond of his duty, 
Which was to help needy 
And moneyless creatures, 
Who came to him daily 
With anxiouslined features : 
CHonus—Crying, lend me some money, dear, 
I'd give none offense, 
But if you do love me, 
Oh, lend me ten cents. 
My love often things did get 
Very much mixed indeed, 
lie jumbled his business 
With making his love, he did, 
When he'd forget himself, 
Sometimes he'd say to me, 
While smiling so fondly, 
Thus would he pray to me: (Cuo.) 
lie would have proposed to me, 
But trade wouldn't let him, 
And now that he's gone from me, 
I've got to forget him. 
It's hard thus to lose him, 
Which can not be helped, 
For when he came to popping, 
This is what he yelped: (CHO.)

'Twas on a 
summer's day, 
I 
met her all by chance, 
IIer smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance. 
We wandered in the Mall, 
We strolled beside the lake, 
Her pretty hand, so white and small, 
Of course I 
chanced to take. 
CHORUS. 
Twilight in the park, twilight in the park, 
Cupid lingers there, and no one near to mark 
Some one by your side, happy as a 
lark ; 
That's the time I 
love twilight in the park. 
We talked about the swans, 
And all the other birds; 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words. 
She leaned upon my arm, 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper 
All the love within my breast. 
She left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said good-by; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half-suppressed a 
sigh. 
She said she'd come again, 
And named the time and place; 
Her abFence gave my heart such pain, 
For heaven shone in her face. (Cno.) 
So every day I 
watched, 
In love's delightful trance, 
And sure enough we met again— 
She knew me at a 
glance. 
'Twas love at sight, I 
said, 
And as the day grew dark, 
I 
won her heart forevermore, 
At twilight in the park.

In it pretty little cottage by the sea-shore, 
Where the ivy and the honeysuckle twine, 
Lives the sweetest, the dearest little darling 
That ever deigned to charm this heart of mine. 
She's as fair and as pure as the lily, 
And as charming as the tiny dowers of May, 
Oh, I 
never shall forget my darling Minnie, 
I 
shall never cease to love sweet Minnie Gray. 
CRORIIS—Minnie Gray, Minnie Gray, 
In that cozy little cottage by the sea; 
She's the sweetest, the dearest little darling, 
Oh, Minnie, thou art all the world to me. 
Together we have wandered in the Maytime, 
When the robin sung his merry warbling lay, 
Together we have spent the happy moments, 
In the twilight of the fast departing day. 
Oh, Minnie, shall I 
ever call thee mine, love ? 
I 
am waiting for that happy, happy day ; 
There never was a 
maiden half so lovely 
As my pretty little darling, Minnie Gray. (Ciro.) 
Vite Mice.

Publisher, 599 Broadway, New York. 
You see a 
poor boy here, a 
native of Switzerland, 
Two weeks ago to this country I 
came; 
I 
sell vite mice in your beautiful city, 
A 
poor Savoyard, and Pierre is my name. 
I 
wander bare-footed from morning till night, 
So cold and so hungry I 
go through the streets, 
My fingers I 
snap, and merrily sing, 
And smile at the pretty young ladies I 
meet. 
REFRAIN. 
Will you buy, Bare, ze vite mice from me? 
Poor Savoyard from Switzerland you see. 
I've a 
nice little sweetheart at home in my country, 
Ze sweetest and dearest that ever you met ; 
How fondly she loves her poor little Savoyard, 
I'd give the world for my own dear Lizettc; 
How sadly she cried the day I 
departed, 
And said she'd be true to poor Pierre all her life, 
But yen I 
am rich I'll go back to my country, 
, And find out my dear one and make her my wife. 
Oh, vill no kind gentleman on me take pity ? 
You viii, I 
am sure, Miss, you're smiling so nice, 
help the poor Swiss boy, alone among strangers, 
Earning his living by selling vite mice. 
But I'll be merry in rain or in sunshine, 
I'll laugh at misfortune and banish dull care, 
As long as my singing viii cause you amusement, 
So smile, in your kindness, on poor little Pierre.

The evening breeze is ebbing low 
A 
lullaby to-day— . 
I 
have a 
question I 
would ask 
Before it dies away; 
The pebbles on the beach are dry, 
The tide has sunken low, 
Alittle form is standing near 
Between the ebb and flow. 
Cnon.us—We wandered on, both side by side, 
I 
asked her to become my bride ; 
She's just a 
roguish little dear, 
And it was not very late 
As she whispered " Yes," and shed a 
tear, 
As we parted at the gate. 
A 
little heart, that longing waits 
To know what next ' twill hear, 
A 
little face that slyly looks 
To see if still I'm near; 
Ah, little heart that answered " Yes," 
Though pouting lips said " No 1" 
You thought that you'd be asked again 
Between the ebb and flow. (Cnonus.) 
A 
little face, half- frightened when 
I 
turn to go away, 
Two little bands, that slyly reach 
As if to bid me stay; 
A. little voice that softly says— 
" 
I 
didn't mean that 
No,' " 
A 
little pride that well were lost, 
Between the ebb and flow. (CnoRn.)

In the bat tie of life, as it's trials oppose us, 
Those gather success who stand firm to the end, 
For as fate weaves its web, sad experience shows us 
They only succeed on themselves who depend. 
Though time with its worrie ,, 
oft seems to defy us, 
And wearies us daily with many a 
slip, 
Yet there's one blessed boon that he can not deny us: 
The pleasure of keeping a 
stiff upper lip. 
CHORUS. 
Don't give up the ship—keep a 
stiff upper lip ! 
Though the ill-winds of fate blow you out of the 
track, 
And whatever chance trouble life's golden-hued bub-
ble, 
Don't give up the ship—keep a 
stiff upper lip. 
, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip, though misfortune and sorrow 
Join hands to defeat the best hope of your heart, 
From the pangs of to-day spring the joy of to-mor-
row, 
As nature oft yields to the magic of art. 
Though toil is the burden of every man living, 
- 
Sweet rest comes at last to the weary and worn, 
As wrongs we forget in the joy of forgiving, 
Oft strengthen the heart-strings when tortured and 
torn. 
Life is weary, at best, and we're full of repining, 
And weakly we yield in the struggle with fate; 
Yet no cloud is so dark but its bright silver lining 
May cheer and uphold us before ' tis too late. 
One half of enjoyment were taken from pleasure 
If life brought no contrasts of gloom and of doubt, 
But we grasp at bright fancies with no stint or 
measure, 
Since shadows encompass them round and about.

Little brook that glideth through the meadows,

little message 
Bear it to my love for me. 
Seek him where those waves, grown slow and weary, 
Languish through the dull streets of the town • 
Where, instead of flowers, faces dreary 
Peer into thy mirror, stained and brown. 
Tell him that beside thy crystal fountains, 
Where the shy bird dips and flies aWay, 
In the purple shadows of the mountains, 
There, awaiting him, I 
stay. 
Tell him, little brook, but whisper lowly, 
Lest the gossip breezes hear thee tell, 
That amid the mountain silence holy 
Quiet hearts may learn love's lesson well. 
Tell him I

For the heavens reflect hope's sunny hue ; 
Ah ! tell him, brook, how some one loves him only,

Always pull together, 
Is a 
maxim true and good, 
Although in many instances 
It has been misconstrued; 
The meaning that I'd have you take 
Is a 
simple one indeed, 
It's always pull together 
If you would make any speed. 
CHonus—So pull slow and steady, boys, 
For strange though it may seem, 
The hardest pull won't make the boat 
Go fastest down the stream. 
If you wish to keep your bark atioat, 
And brave life's stormy weather, 
Never dip your oars too deep, 
But always pull together. 
There's many married couples, 
Who lead a 
wretched life, 
The husband's temper is, no doubt, 
Sometimes the cause of strife ; 
While many wives forget their vows, 
" 
Love, honor and obey," 
Although their husbands pull aright, 
They pull the othc- way. 
(CHO) 
So always pull together 
As on life's stream you glide, 
Ne'er lose heart though you have to pull 
Against a 
running tide. 
What though the wind's against you, 
'Twill very soon blow past, 
Pull with a 
will, and you will reach 
The harbor safe at last.

n 
a 
quiet little corner, 
Not far off from this spot, 
Lived the happy, jolly family 
Of John Charles Peter Knott. 
There were father, mother, Tom and John, 
Susan and Mary Jane, 
They staid at home on pleasant days, 
And traveled in the rain. 
The father, John Charles Peter, 
Was ' most two hundred weight, 
He always wore a 
jolly smile, 
Though his hat, was out of date; 
To make a 
joke or sing a 
song 
lie was the greatest case, 
Whene'er you'd meet him on the street, 
He'd smile all o'er his face. 
CHORUS. 
He can joke, ha ! ha! 
He can laugh, ho 
ho 
He is never at a 
loss what to say; 
But be merry while you can, 
Is the motto of this man, 
And you'll always find him merry thro' the day. 
The wife of John Charles Peter, 
Her name was Polly Ann, 
Was not afraid of J. C. P., 
Or any other man. 
Supposed to be his better half, 
She really was the whole; 
She pried into a 
secret 
Like a 
weasel or a 
mole. 
If J. C. P. dared make a 
joke 
She'd give the door a 
slam, 
He'd blow his nose and then he'd be 
As mute as any clam. 
Poor Tom and John would catch it then 
For some remembered prank, 
And wonder why, for father's sake, 
They often got a 
spank. 
Torn and John are both rare children— 
Twin roses in the bud; 
They have a 
rare affinity 
For water and for mud. 
They are John and Polly's twins, you see, 
The youngest, I 
opine, 
For Torn was twelve last Easter week, 
And John is barely nine. 
An orchard robbed, it surely was 
Those " pesky boys of Knott's ;" 
A 
fish-hook in a 
piece of bread 
Drew geese across the lots. 
Their father laughed at them all day, 
Their mother whipped at night, 
And supperless to bed at once 
Sent each unlucky wight. 
Susan was fat and fair and twenty, 
Just like Peter as two peas, 
Her tongue would rattle like a 
mill, 
And was never quite at ease. 
She had a 
beau, as most girls have, 
Excepting Mary Jane ; 
His hair was parted like a 
girl's, 
And he always had a 
cane. 
Susan would say, " Adolphus Brown, 
Your hair looks like fright," 
And box his ears until he'd vow 
He'd not come another night; 
Then, woman-like, she'd kiss him, 
Or else try some other tack, 
And while she'd say, " Pm sorry, darling," 
Put a 
spider down his back. (
Cno.) 
Oh I 
Mary Jane's the fairest gem 
That ' mong these jewels walked ; 
Her hair was like the red, red rose, 
She stuttered when she talked. 
Her nose was somewhat out of joint, 
Her eyes looked at her nose, 
She's only just turned thirty-two, 
As blooming as a 
rose. 
" 
Of man she couldn't bear the sight," 
At least she said round town, 
At home she sighed and softly sung, 
" 
I-love A-d-d.dolphus B-B-Brown." 
She wore her hair done up in curls, 
To take Adolphus' eye, 
Till one sad night when Tommy found 
A bunch inside the pie. (Cno.) 
CHORUS. 
Then she sighed " Ah, me 1" 
Then she cried, " You brute I" 
But she hasn't seen Adolphus since that day ; 
But she stays within her room, 
Or else gazes at the moon, 
And she very seldom has a 
word to say.

We ladies often sigh and say, 
" 
These men will drive us mad," 
For they all make the best of vows 
And then turn out so bad. 
They say they love us when they don't, 
Swear true they'll ever be; 
But he who never swears at all: 
Is the style of man for me. 
But he who never swears at all 
Is the style of man for me. 
I've often seen a 
pretty girl, 
Great beauty she possessed, • 
The only fault would be, " she's poor," 
And never finely dressed ; 
But he who would respect " the rags," 
When such a 
one he'd see, 
And let her pass without remark, 
Is the style of man for me. 
And let hur pass without remark, 
Is the style of man for me. 
There's something else I've got to say 
Before I 
close my song, 
That is—I 
do not mean to say 
That all men mean us wrong ; 
Of course, sometimes, I 
may expect 
A happy bride to be, 
And he who does propose at once 
Is the style of man for me. 
And he who does propose at once 
Is the style of man for me.

We 3re. a pair of frisky mokes, 
Who never borrow pain, 
We dance to-day and never drink, 
To-morro of comus again ; 
We are alike in dress and form, 
Just like two little fins, 
We're known wherever we may go 
As the Mississippi Twins. 
CHORUS— Oh, my, don't you see, 
When you look at him you gaze at me ? 
I 
take a 
little dance, 
Leave off where he begins; 
it conies quite easy to us bo 
The Mississippi Twins. 
When we were in our Southern home 
We'd oft in trouble be ; 
Then I'd get licked for what he did, 
And he'd get licked for me. 
When to the circus we would go 
A 
seat for him I'd find, 
And get mixed so and turned around 
And leave myself behind. (CnoR 
And now we have a 
pretty girl, 
We own her little heart, 
The only trouble seems to be, 
She can't tell us apart ; 
She don't know which of us to have, 
But lucky he who wins ; 
I 
guess she'll have to marry both 
Of the Mississippi Twins. (ullon.us.) 
BOL SMITH RUSSELL'S CHARACTER SONG. 
Perhaps you can tell me who I 
am, 
To me it's all a .mystery ; 
Of a 
family like ours 
I 
never read in history; 
We started night, some years ago, 
Fair sailing and fine weather, 
But one unlucky day, somehow, 
We got mixed up together. 
CHORUS. 
My grandma, when she heard of it, went nearly ra-
ving mad, 
My uncle, when he dreamt of it, was very near as bad; 
We're mixed up in an awful way, it's any thing but 
fun, 
My father he's my son-in-law, and I'm his son. 
I 
fell in with a 
widow, once, 
And her one day I 
married; 
If I'd have known how things would go, 
I'm sure I 
would have tarried. 
She had a 
grown-up daughter, and 
This daughter married father, 
Then my wife had a 
little boy, 
Which mixed us all up rather. (Ono.) 
My mother is my daughter, and 
My daughter is my mother, 
My wife is father's mother, and 
his grandson is his brother. 
My. son is mother's brother, but 
Alas, I 
haven't done, sirs, 
To make the complication worse, 
My father had a 
son, sirs. 
My father's brother is his son, 
My grandson is his brother, 
his mother is my daughter, and 
My wife is a 
grandmother ; 
But who's my uncle, who's my niece, 
I'm in a 
muddle rather, 
I'm bless'd if I 
shan't prove myself 
To be my own grandfather. (Cno.)

Smile again, my bonnie lassie, 
Lassie, smile again! 
Prithee do not frown, sweet lassie, 
For it gives me pain. 
If to love thee too sincerely 
Be a 
fault in me, 
Thus to use me so severely 
Is not kind in thee.

Lassie, smile again 
Prithee do not frown, sweet lassie, 
For it gives me pain. 
Fare thee well, my bonnie lassie, 
Lassie, fare ye well 1 
Time will show thee, bonnie lassie, 
More than tongue can tell. 
Though we're doomed by Fate to sever, 
And ' tis hard to part, • 
Still, believe me, thou shalt ever 
Own my faithful heart. (Cnonus.)

As Kitty was walking one morning so early, 
When over the meadow came whistling Ben, 
She lifted her head, with its brown hair so curly, 
And what do you think pretty Kitty did then ? 
Why, out of her eye came glances so shy, 
Coquetted with am as he slowly passed by ; 
He lifted his cap, his heart beating the while, 
And greeted her thus, with a 
bow and a 
smile : 
" 
Good-morning, Miss Kitty, ' tis Early yer walkin', 
The sun is outlt-rivaled indade be yer eyes I" 
" ' Pis you that can flatther, have done wid yer talkin', 
And ' tind to yer whistliu';" sweet Kitty replies. 
" 
Mavourneen 1" said he—" Be aisy 1" said she ; 
" 
Indade, if yell let me, I 
will that," said he. 
She tossed her bright head and nc'er deigned him a 
glance; 
Thought he, " Oh, for wooing, I've mighty small 
chance I" 
But out on the meadow, that morning so early, 
He ceased not front teasing, and Kitty gave in. 
" ' Tis only to kape ye from being so surly," 
S 
dd she, " though I 
vow in my heart it's a 
sin. 
For some time ago, believe it or no, 
I 
yielded my heart to a 
good-looking beau. 
I 
vowed in my soul that to him I'd be thrue, 
And why should I 
break that same vow, sir, for you ?" 
" 
Bedad, thin, Mavourneen, that vow I'll not hinder, 
I 
don't want wheart that is not all my own ! 
But I 
will be bound lie will not be more tinder 
Than I, though ye're sending me off sad and lone !" 
" 
Come back, Ben 1" said she. " What for. thi ' 
said he. 
"Because I 
meant you all the time, sir," said she. 
" 
Then here goes a 
kiss for the bargain," he cries, 
"'no' I 
knew —e 
meant me by the look in yer eyes r

To be the first at ball or hop, 
r0 have bouquets by dozens, 
To wake the boyish love of male 
And hate of female cousins; 
To say and do just what you please, 
And without rhyme or reason, 
And yet be praised— this is to be 
The beauty of the season. 
The beaux at church think more of yo' 
Than of the prayer or sermon ; 
You are the first asked for a 
waltz, 
The last one at the German. 
Yet, though you've lovers by the score— 
Can some one tell the reason ?-
The plainest girl is wed before 
The beauty of the season. 
You're ' witching, there's no doubt of that, 
Your very smile is winning, 
One glance from those bewitching eyes 
Sets hearts and heads a-spinning. 
But when a 
suitor comes for life, 
You flirt beyond all reason, 
And so you'll die an old maid yet, 
My beauty of the season.

Where'er I 
am the Italics throng, 
And as on me they gaze, 
They seem to think I 
go it strong 
In all the stunning ways! 
But some, alas, I 
always find, 
Grim- featured and passe, 
Who, full of envy, speak their mind, 
And this is what they say : 
Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! 
In all the world there's no such fool as Sam. 
Of gossip I 
have made an art, 
My sayings are the rage; 
I'm great in matters of the heart, 
And capture e'en the sage ! 
The guileless soul of sweet sixteen, 
The maid of years mature--
The servant girl, the fashions' queen— 
All sigh with love demure: 
Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! 
In all the world there's naught so sweet as Sam! 
I'm certain I'm a 
grand success 
In every taking style— 
And sure without my wit, I 
guess, 
The world would cease to smile 
And as I 
go from grave to gay, 
From lively to severe, 
My motto is—" Let others pay," 
The while I 
sing with cheer: 
Saint Sam! Sam I 
Sant 14 
In this broad world they've greater fools than Sam.

A queer but good little expression, 
And one which we hear every day, 
"In one ear and out of the other," 
Oft handily coming in play— 
Yes, a 
good little rule to follow, 
That is, in some cases I'll tell, 
In order to trouble avoid, 
And to keep one's self easy, as well. 
CHORUS. 
" 
In one ear and out of the other," 
Much we hear had best be received; 
Thus may one avoid much bother, 
Since much that's said's not to be believed. 
How oft we meet folks always ready 
Unkind words of others to say, 
With backbiting words of the absent, 
In a 
sneaking and cowardly way; 
So when all such spiteful expressions 
In our ears are eagerly popped, 
"In one ear and out of the other " 
Is the safe, proper rule to adopt. (Clio.) 
Sharp words by the tongue oft are spoken, 
Not sanctioned always by the head, 
But said in a 
moment of passion, 
Oft repented the instant they're said. 
Now in such a 
case to get angry 
And offended 's 
the act of a 
fool; 
" 
In one ear and out of the other," 
Is most surely the sensible rule. (Ciro.)
