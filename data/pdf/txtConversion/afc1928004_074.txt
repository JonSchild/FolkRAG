BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
OWEN FAWCETT, at present the principal low 
comedian of the Walnut Street Theatre, was born 
in the city of London, England, twenty-six years 
ago. 
Made his first appearance on the stage in 
September, 1858, at the old Pittsburgh Theatre, 
then under the management of C. S. Porter. 
Leaving the Smoky City in May, 1859, he joined 
the traveling company of Joseph Parker, playing 
in every city, town and village in the States of 
North and South Carolina. For the seasons of 1860 
and 1861, he engaged with John T. Ford, Esq., 
for the Holliday Street Theatre, Baltimore, Md., 
where he remained four years, (excepting the 
summer of 1861, when he was engaged by W. J. 
Florence for the Winter Garden, N. Y., and the 
summer of 1863 at the Norfolk Theatre.) 
During 
his term of service with . 
Mr. Ford, he appeared at 
his Theatres in Washington and Alexandria. 
For the seasons of 1864 and 1865, he was engaged 
by Mrs. Garretson, for the Walnut Street Theatre, 
Philadelphia, but before the season opened a 
corn-
(5)

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
promise was made, and he was especially secured 
by J. S. Clarke, to play the " Dromio of Ephesus," 
in the " Comedy of Errors," at the Winter Garden, 
N. Y., at which theatre he remained the entire 
season. 
He then came to the Walnut St. Theatre, 
(August, 18650 and has been the principal low 
comedian ever since, slowly but surely winning 
his way to popular favor. 
Mr. Fawcett is an original comedian; his forte 
is broad humor. 
As a 
comic singer ( so essential 
to a 
comedian), he is second to none. 
In giving 
this well-deserved endorsement to the talents of 
Mr. F.—taients, that one day, with due cultivation 
and study, will place him in the front rank of our 
most popular comedians—we with pleasure add, 
that in his private life he is eonsistant and respect-
able.

PAUL PRY. 
"Just dropped in! 
Hope I 
dont intrude." 
Sung in character 
by Owen Fawcett, for over two hundred and fifty times. 
I've just dropped in to make a 
call, I 
hope I 
don't 
intrude, now, 
but Paul Pry, how are you all? 
Pray don't 
think me rude, now; 
They say that I've gone out of town, but that's 
• 
indeed a 
story, 
Or how could I 
appear to make my handsome bow 
before ye? 
Chorus.—Poor Paul Pry, 
Everybody laughs when they behold Paul Pry. 
8 
OWEN FAWCETT'S 
Because I 
take an interest in other people's busi-
ness, 
I'm bump'd, and thump'd, and snubb'd, and 
drubb'd until I 
feel a 
dizziness 
Which makes me vow I'll never do a 
kind and 
worthy action, 
For whatsoc'er I 
meddle in, I 
ne'er give satisfac-
tion. 
Oh,orus.—Poor Paul Pry, 
Everybody fleers and jeers at poor Paul 
Pry. 
One night as next the wall I 
walk'd, my way in 
caution groping, 
I 
spied a 
ladder next a 
window, placed there for 
eloping; 
I 
knew this was not quite correct, so to the top did 
clamber, 
And as I 
just dropp'd in I 
saw a 
man hide in a 
lady's chamber. 
Chorus.—Poor Paul Pry. 
What a 
situation ' twas for poor Paul 
Pry. 
Who should the lady's father be but my friend 
Colonel Hardy. 
I 
pointed to his daughter's room, and bid him not 
be tardy; 
lie quickly kicked me out of doors, and called me 
lying fellow, 
But I 
came back because I 
had forgot my umbrel-
la. 
Chorus.—Poor Paul Pry, 
Everybody's mischief falls on poor Paul 
Pry. 
This umbrella cost me one and nine-pence in the 
city ; 
To lose an article so useful, would be a 
shame and 
pity. 
• 
.9 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
I 
often, too, forget my gloves, affairs my mind 
distract so, 
While people can't forbear from laughing when 
they see me act so. 
Chorus.—Poor Paul Pry, 
Everybody laughs when they behold 
Paul Pry. 
They've got me in the picture shops, they have, 
upon my honor, 
I'm next to Venus, which they say is quite a 
libel 
on her. 
No matter if my friends still smile, their plaudits 
ne' er denying, 
To yield them more amusement, why I'll still 
continue prying. 
Chorus.—Poor Paul Pry, 
Everybody laughs when they see poor 
Paul Pry. 
THE LAD FOR THE LASSES. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett at the Walnut Street Theatre, Phila-
delphia, for over one hundred nights. , 
On! when I 
was a 
little boy, 
No higher than my knee; 
A 
very merry, pretty boy, as ever you did see, 
A 
very merry, pretty boy, as ever you did see, 
The lasses how they handled me, and dandled me, 
And callQd me a 
pretty little boy; 
Lawks, what a 
little boy. 
Then ' round my little waist, 
They would tie a 
little string, 
Saying, come along, you pretty boy, 
You funny little thing, funny little thing; 
10 
OWEN FAWCETT'S 
For I 
looked so well, laughed so well, and kissed 
so well, 
In short, I 
was the very lad the lasses wished to 
have. 
Now when a 
boy is pretty born, 
All the world does say 
That if he grows to be a 
man, he'll grow the other 
way, 
That if he grows to be a 
man, he'll grow the other 
way. 
Now the pretty girls they run for me, make fun 
for me, 
And call me a 
pretty little man; 
Lawks, what a 
little man. 
Then round about my waist 
In clusters they will hang, 
And for to get possession, each other won't they 
bang ? 
Each other won't they bang ? 
For I 
look so well, and laugh so well, make love 
so well, 
In short, I 
am the very lad the lasses wish to have. 
Now when I 
am a 
married man, 
As married man I'll be, 
For, oh! I 
know a 
pretty girl, she's very fond of 
me, 
For, ()lie! 
I 
know a 
pretty girl, she's very fond of 
me; 
Ifer auburn locks are curly and they're whirley, 
And she thinks me a 
funny little man. 
Lawks, what a 
little man. 
Then smiling like a 
cherub, . 
I 
shall seek to crown my joy, 
On my knee another saucy, pretty, curly-headed 
boy; 
Such a 
pretty little boy ; 
If he's pretty, and he's witty in a 
ditty, 
Now, what would you all think some night, 
To hear him singing here. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER.

THE WEEPING WILLER. 
A 
doleful ballad. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett in the drama of the 
" 
Orange Girl," at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philad'a. 
Down by the country side lives old Gray, the miller, 
Down by the mill-stream side, grows a 
weeping 
wilier; 
Under the wilier tree sat the miller's daughter, 
Singing a 
song, and a-gazing long into the bub-
bling water !—Fluid! 
Chorus.—Oh ! 
she sat by the side of the bubbling 
water, 
Under the weeping wilier tree. 
Tears they were in her eyes, hands she was 
wringing; 
First she cried, and then she sighed, and then 
began a-singing 
All this world's a 
waste, life to me is o-jous 
Since William's deserted me, and gone and joined 
the sogers 1—army. 
Oh I 
she sat by the side, &c. 
First she looked at the wilier above, and said, I'll 
hang in my garter; 
But what a 
mistake, if the garter should break, I 
would be drowned in the water; 
Then she looked at the water below, and her 
nerves began to totter; 
I'm not very bold, and I 
might take cold, I'll wait 
till the weather is hotter 1—milder. 
Oh she sat by the side, etc. 
Then she rose and dried her tears, and said since 
he's a 
rover, 
I 
will not mind, but try to find some more faithful 
lover; 
If one I 
cannot find, to me it's very funny, 
Since love is blind, I'm half inclined to marry a 
man for money 1—rhino. 
Oh she sat by the side, &c.

WEDLOCK IS A TICKLISH THING. 
Bang by Owen Fawcett, in the character of " Thomas," in the 
farce of " The Secret." 
Tanti Palpiti. 
Wedlock is a 
ticklish thing, 
hey merrily ho, and ho merrily hey; 
And will joy or sorrow bring, 
Hey merrily ho, hey ho: 
Oh, how delightful pass their days away, 
Who, never spiteful, only toy and play. 
Spoken.—" Will you take a 
walk this morning, 
my love ?" " Yes, my dear." " Then you had 
better put on your gum boots, my chicken, for fear 
of catching cold." " And pray do you put on 
your overcoat, least you might increase your 
cough." " Thank you, my precious, tbr your care 
of me." 
Oh, wedlock's joys are soft and sweet, 
Hey merrily ho, and ho merrily hey; 
When fond hearts in union meet, 
Hey merrily ho, hey ho. 
Let us only change the scene, 
Ho terrible hey, and hey terrible ho; 
Take a 
peep behind the screen, 
Ho, terrible ho, hey ho. 
What she proposes, be it good or bad, 
He still opposes till he drives her mad. 
Spoken.—" Do you dine at home to- day, sir ?" 
" 
I 
can't tell, ma'am." " What shall I 
provid,?" 
" 
What you like." " Would you like a 
roasted 
chicken ?" " You know I don't like roasted 
chicken." " Well, boiled, then ?" " Worse and 
worse." " What will you have, then ?'• " No-
thing." " Very well, sir." " Very well, ma'am." 
"Oh, you brute." " Good morning, ma'am, I 
shall not be home all day, nor night. 
I'm going 
• 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
to the club." " Go, and I 
never want to see your 
face again." 
Thus wedlock is a 
dreadful state, 
Ho terrible hey, and hey terrible ho ; 
• 
When cold hearts are joined by fate, 
Ho, terrible ho, hey ho. 
KA—FOOZLE—EM. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett, at the Walnut Street Theatre, 
Phila-
.. 
delphia, 
, 
In ancient days there dwelt a 
Turk, 
A horrid beast, who in the East, 
Did the prophet's holy work, 
As babah of Jerusalem. 
He had a 
daughter smirk and sweet, 
Complexion fair and dark blue hair ; 
With naught about her like a 
Turk, 
Except her name, Ka-loozle-em. 
Chorus.— Oh I Ka-tbozle-em, Ka-foozle-em, Ka-
foozle-em, 
Oh! Ka-foozle-em, the daughter of the 
babah. 
A youth resided near to she, 
His name was Sam, a 
perfect lamb; 
He came of ancient pedigree, 
And was from old Methuselam. 
He drove a 
trade, and prospered well, 
in skins of cats, and ancient hats, 
And ringing at the babah's bell 
lie saw and loved Ka-tOozie-em. 
Oh! Ka-foozle-em, & c. 
If Sam had been a 
Musselman, 
lie might have sold the babah, 
And with a 
verse of Al- co- ran, 
Have managed to bamboozle him; 
14 
OWEN FAWCETT'S 
But, oh dear, no, he tried to sham, 
Passed, one night late, the area gate, 
And stole into the Turk's harem, 
To carry off Ka-foozle-em. 
Oh! Ka-foozle-em, & c. 
The babah was about to smoke; 
His slaves rushed in with horrid din,— 
MarshaHalt I 
dog, the house has broke, 
Come down, my lord, and toozle him. 
The babah wreathed his face in smiles, 
Went down stairs, and witnessed there 
A gentleman in three old tiles, 
A kissing of Ka-foozle-em. 
Oh! Ka-foozle-em, &c. 
The pious babah said no more 
Than twenty prayers, and went up stairs, 
And took a 
bowstring from his drawer, 
And came back to Ka-foozle-em. 
The maiden and the youth he took, 
And choked them both, and nothing loth 
Together pitched them in the brook 
Of Ke-dron, near Jerusalem. 
011! Ka-foozle-em, & c. 
And still the ancient legend goes. 
When day is gone from Lebanon, 
And the eastern moonlight throws 
A shadow from Jerusalem; 
Between the wailing of the cats, 
A sound then falls from ruined walls, 
A ghost is seen in three old tiles, 
Ad(issing of Ka-foozle-em. 
Oh! &c.

LOVE AND OYSTERS. 
A PARODY ON HERO AND LEANDER. 
Sung with great success by Owen Fawcett. 
Air.—" Partaat pour La Sync." 
13 
THERE was a 
tall young oysterman lived by the 
river side, 
his hut was built upon the bank, his boat was on 
the tide ; 
The daughter of a 
fisherman, who was both tall 
and slim, 
Lived over on the other side, right opposite to him, 
Lived over on the other side, right opposite to him. 
It was this tall young oysterman that saw this 
lovely maid, 
All on a 
moonlight evening a- sitting in the shade ; 
-He saw her wave her handkerchief— as much as if 
to say, 
" 
There's plenty room for courting now that 
daddy's gone away, 
There's plenty room for courting now that 
daddy's gone away." 
Up jumped this tall young oysterman, and to 
himself said he, 
" 
I'd better leave my skiff behind, for fear that 
folks should see ; 
I've read it in a 
story book, that for to kiss his 
dear, 
Leander swam the Hellespont, and I 
will swim 
this here, 
Leander swam the Hellespont, and I 
will swim 
this here." 
Oh ! then he leaped into the wave, and then ho 
crossed the stream ; 
And then he clambered up the bank, all in the 
moonlight's gleam; 
16 
OWN 
FAWCETT'S 
0, there were kisses soft as dew, and words as soft 
as rain, 
And then they heard her father's step, and in he 
leaped again, 
And then they heard her father's step, and in he 
leaped again. 
Out spoke this aged fisherman, " Oh ! what is that 
my daughter ?" 
" 
It's nothing but a brickbat, sir, that I 
flung in 
the water !" 
" 
What, then, is that funny thing that's swimming 
o'er so fast ?" 
" 
It's nothing but a 
porpoise, sir, that's just a-
swimming past! 
It's nothing but a porpoise, sir, that's just a-
swimming past !" 
" 
Run" said the ancient fisherman, " now bring 
me my harpoon, 
And I 
will jump into my boat, and fix the critter 
soon ?" 
Down fell the lovely damsel, as falls a 
slaughtered 
flock— 
Her hair hung round her pallid cheeks like sea-
weed round a 
rock, 
Her hair hung round her pallid cheeks like sea-
weed round a 
rock. 
Alas ! and for this loving one she woke not from 
her swound, 
Her swain was taken with the cramp, and in the 
water drowned, 
But fate has metamorphos'd them in pity for their 
woe ; 
And now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids 
down below, 
And now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids 
down below.

And you shall hear of a

It is all about one Billy Vile, 
Who was his parients sole delight. 
Ri fol, tie rol, &c.

And noted for a

The prettiest lass that was ever seen. 
Hi fol, de rol, Sze. 
Now, this young woman, I'd have you to know, 
Loved that ' ere young man but very so-so; 
For she was very well varsed in letters, 
Aud fit to marry poor Billy Vite's betters. 
Ri fol, de rol, & c. 
Now when his suit she did deny, 
He in a 
coal pit went to cry, 
When straightway to him appeared old Nick, 
-Who bid him tip her a 
penn'orth of white arsenic. 
Ri fol, de rol, & c. 
To poison her he was worry loth ; 
So he mixed it up in some sheep's head broth, 
And she did eat while she was able, 
'Till she fell stiff, stone- dead, underneath the table. 
Hi fol, de rol, & c. 
One night when he lay fast asleep, 
He plainly saw the ghost of a

And unto hint it straightway said,

JUST A LITTLE TOO LATE. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
There was a 
little man, people called him Mr. 
Murry, 
lie had a 
little house in a 
pretty part of Surry; 
He was always in a 
hurry, in a 
scurry, in a 
flurry, 
And he'd talk, and he'd walk, and go on at such 
a 
rate; 
But this little Mr. Murry, tho' always in a 
worry, 
Was, by getting in' a 
hurry, just a 
little too late. 
Such a 
hurried life he led, people said that he'd be 
dead, 
Save he took it in his head to go courting and be 
wed; 
But this put him in a 
flurry, in a 
scurry, in a 
hurry, 
While he walked, thus he talked: that he thought 
he'd found a 
mate; 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
19 
Her name he said was " Carry," but perhaps I'd 
better tarry, 
'Tis at my time to marry, just a 
little too late. 
Just a 
little too late, & c. 
So he courted Miss McPherson, who'd a 
very 
comely person, 
A. charming Grecian nose, her eyes as black as 
sloes, 
While her ringlets which were known to be almost 
all her own, 
Were flaxen, perfect Saxon, which of course 
means very light; 
Her height was called the middle; her age that 
was a 
riddle. 
Her friends said they'd engage any day to name 
her age, 
Which they whispered corresponded with her 
height. (Spoken)—MIDDLING.) 
So this Murry, in a 
hurry, in a 
flurry, in a 
scurry, 
Still walked as he talked, and went on at such a 
rate; 
Now you'll hear how Mr. Murry, who was 
always in a 
flurry, 
Was, by getting in a 
hurry, just a 
little too late. 
Just a 
little too late, & c. 
Then in a 
hurried way, he named the happy day, 
And the hour ' twas eleven, in a 
county town of 
Devon; 
Said Miss Carry, dry or shower, if you're not here 
at the hour 
You should call, I 
once for all say that I'll not 
wait, 
For there's 
t handsome Major A., whose been press-
ing me to say 
That my hand, you understand, will alone de-
cide his fate; 
So this Murry in a 
worry, in a 
scurry, in a 
flurry, 
Was, by getting in a 
hurry, just a 
little too late. 
Just a 
little too late, &c.

out the time, 
And then she cried out, " I'm not willing here to

SO 
with her Major A., to the church she went 
her way, 
And this little Mr. Murry sought his home in 
Surry, 
Which be reached in a 
hurry, in a 
scurry, in a

And he walked, and he talked, and he rubbed his 
little pate, 
And he dined alone on curry, said he, " a

late."

I'M NOT SUCH AN UGLY MAN. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett, in character. 
I 
think if you look at my figure and face, 
You surely might see many worse; 
Could I 
but in some lady's heart find a 
place, 
For beauty I'd point to my purse; 
By some I'm told that I 
look rather old, 
But believe it I 
never can; 
If not an Adonis ! I've plenty of gold, 
And I'm not such an ugly man. 
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not such an ugly man. 
I'm none of your regular beauties, I 
own, 
Still there's something about me uncommon; 
My head's rather bald, and my cheeks rat her brown, 
And my nose rather puggy than Roman. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER.

Then look at my eyes, ( I 
don't say they're a 
pair,) 
If my forehead's the color of tan, 
I've plenty of mouth, and though few tusk are there, 
Yet Pm not such an ugly man, &c. 
Yet would you believe it, the girls take delight, 
In making me food for their mirth; 
They begged I 
would come to a 
party one night, 
"Iwas the pleasantest party on earth. 
And so, too, thought I, till a 
forward young child 
With its innocent prattht began, 
And she said with such point that the company 
smiled, 
" 
La, ma, what an ugly man." 
But I'm not, &e. 
Just to pass time away, if I 
go to the play, 
I'm sure to meet something to vex me; 
For a 
lady, one night, who sat just on my right, 
With her laughing did sorely perplex me. 
That the laughter was catching appeared very clear, 
I'm convinced ' twas a 
regular plan; 
For nought could I 
see, and nought could I 
hear, 
But 0 
Lord, what an ugly man. 
But Pm not such, L`cc. 
To the Zoological Gardens I 
went t'other day, 
The Giraffes and the Lions to see, 
Strange birds and .queer beauties, no attractions had 
they, 
But all eyes were turned upon me. 
Some called me Baboon, and some Ourang-outaug, 
Or a 
nondescript fresh from Japan; 
But a 
lady soon stopped all their clatter and clang, 
With " Bless me, that's the ugly man.' 
But I'm not, & c. 
Now, what's in a 
face, I 
have heard people say, 
Why that depends upon liking, 
Mine is one of a 
sort you don't see every day; 
There are very few faces so striking, 
OWEN FAwcErr's. 
But " handsome is he who the handsome thing 
does." 
And this, ladies, all is my plan, 
Will any one have me ? (Pause) 
What a 
general buzz ! 
-Why I 
can't be an ugly man. 
But I 
can't be, SLc. 
MY SON TOM. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
My son's a 
youth of talent rare, you really ought 
to know him, 
But he blushes so when people stare, that he 
seldom lets me show him; 
To school he never yet was sent, nor yet to Oxford 
college, 
So all are in astonishment where Tom picked up 
his knowledge. 
Ciwrus.—My Tom's a 
youth of talents rare, you 
really ought to know him, 
But he blushes so when people stare, 
that he seldom lets me show him; 
My Tom, Tom, Torn, you really ought 
to know him, 
But he blushes so when people stare, 
that he seldom lets me show him. 
But Tom's a 
minor, recollect, but nineteen nest 
November; 
And so, of course, one can't expect big books he 
should remember; 
With clever boys, if people force their minds, ' tis 
ru-i-na-tion, 
So I 
let nature take her course a 
fig for ed-u-ea-
tion. 
My Tom's a 
youth, &e. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
23 
By instinct Tom picks up at once the things that 
others study; 
My wire she storms, and calls him dunce, she 
should not do so should she? 
Some talk about the books they've read, and each 
is thought a 
wise one, 
Torn makes, all out of his own head, remarks that 
quite surprise one. 
My Tom's a 
youth, &c. 
Tom wears no stock, no long-tail coat, unfit for 
boys of his age; 
A 
jacket and an open throat, best suit his form and 
visage : 
Hereafter, when the fair and gay my darling is 
pursuing, 
I'm sure he will not fail to say, "' T 
was all my 
father's doing. 
My Tom's a 
youth, &c.

BACON AND GREENS. 
Eu r,z by Owen Fawcett, in E. L. Davenport's play of" F, or 
'Branded," at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. 
I 
have lived lonc, enough to be rarely mistaken, 
And hind my full share of life's changeable scenes; 
Dot my woes have been solaced by good greens 
and bacon ; 
My joys have been doubled by bacon and greens. 
What a thrill 
of remembrance e'en now they 
awaken 
Of childhood's gay morning and youth's merry 
scenes; 
When one day we had greens and a 
plateful of 
bacon, 
And the next we had bacon and a 
plateful of 
greens. 
A 
h ! well I 
remember, when sad and forsaken, 
heart-wrung by the scorn of a 
miss in her teens, 
how I 
fled from her sight to my loved greens and 
bacon, 
And forsot my despair over bacon and greens. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
29 
When the banks refused specie, and credit was 
shaken, 
I 
shared in the wreck, and was ruined in means; 
My friends all declared I 
had not saved my bacon; 
But I 
lived, for I 
still had my bacon and greens. 
If some fairy a 
grant of three wishes could make 
one 
So worthless as I, and so laden with sins, 
I'd wish all the greens in the world, then the 
bacon, 
Then wish for a 
little more bacon and greens. 
Oh ! there is a 
charm in this dish, rightly taken, 
Which from custards and jellies an epicure 
weans; 
Stick your fork in the fat, wrap your greens round 
the bacon, 
And you'll vow there's no dish like good bacon 
and greens.

A NORRI-BULL TAIL! 
33 
Sang by owen Fawcett, in the character of " Orphan Joe," 
in the drama of " The Gypsy Farmer," with groat uccetis. 
I'll sing a 
norri-bulil tale of woe, 
That happen'd some short time ago, 
To an ill- fitted familee, 
As lived next door but one to me. 
The parient was so stern and grim, 
That nufiln ever pleased him; 
lie never liked a 
joke or pun, 
Nor tried his fist at neither one. 
For oh ! Its such a 
norri-bull tale, 
Your flesh will start, your hair turn pale; 
If you will only list to me, 
Tweedle, twaddle, twiddle, twiddle dee. 
This familee, from day to day, 
Like hermits passed the time away; 
They looked such grim and grizzly frights, 
With faces as long as shilling kites; 
They never did attempt a 
joke, 
And to each other seldom spoke; 
And each one suffered, as they say, 
From melan-cholo-ma-nia! 
For oh ! &c. 
They never let no daylight in 
Their dwelling, which you'll say's a 
sin; 
But just like mice they stalked about, 
And never showed their noses out; 
This miserable doleful lot, 
From wuss to wusser daily got; 
Until at last a 
form they planned, 
That each should die by his own hand. 
For oh! & e. 
The father into the garden did stroll, 
And blew out his brains with a 
sausage roll; 
The mother, seeing what he'd done, 
Stabbed herself with a 
currant bun;

Soon after which the oldest boy 
Shot himself with a 
saveloy; 
The youngest daughter, Mary Anne, 
Garroted herself with the frying pan. 
For oh! Sze. 
The little boy just turned six, 
Swallowed a 
gross of new red bricks; 
John with his life did make away, 
By shooting of himself with an old tea tray; 
The melancholy visaged groom 
Ran himself through with the stable broom; 
The housemaid into the house did rush, 
And cut her throat with the blacking brush. 
For oh ! ttc. 
The infant child, just turned two, 
Drowned himself in an Irish stew; 
But one was left, and he alack, 
Hung himself with the rasping jack; 
The black and white poor tabby cat, 
Choked herself with the street door mat; 
And a 
fly upon the window pane, 
Died of water upon the brain.

THE BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
It was in the winter, ' bout six in the morn, 
When I, little innocent creature, was born ; 
There was doctor and nurse, and a 
great many 
more, 
But none of them saw such a 
baby before. 
They all swore I 
was like my pa- pa, oh! 
And there is the nose of ma-ma; 
With a 
few alterations, oh, la! 
Will make him a 
beautiful boy. 
To make him a 
beauty, cried out Mistress Sneer, 
We'll be troubled without the child has a 
sweet 
leer; 
Then to give me this leer Mistress Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose. 
This made me wink and blink so, 
. 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh! 
At last it turned into a 
squint, so, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy. 
To make me accomplished, they said I 
wanted one 
thing, 
My mouth was too small for the dear child to sing; 
Then to lug it and stretch it they all of them tried, 
"rim they stretched my sweet mouth near half a 
yard wide. 
Crying, " pull away now, Mrs. Rider, 
It must be a 
little bit wider!" 
My dear mouth they split pretty nigh, sir, 
, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy. 
Now, being complete, I 
was next sent to.sehool, 
And to show off my make was stuck on a high 
stool; 
When the children went home, they cried out with 
surprise. 
" 
We've a 
new boy at school with such beautiful 
eyes."

OWEN FAWCETT'S 
He can look any way so handy. 
Such a 
mouth he has got to suck candy, 
And his legs are so preciously bandy, 
They call him the beautiful boy. 
1" other day I 
was asked in the city to dine, 
The ladies in raptures all thought me divine; 
A.nd all, when observing my elegant grace, 
Neglected their dinner to gaze on my face. 
They cried, " I 
shall faint with surprise, 
No gaslight can equal his eyes; 
And such a 
sweet mouth for mince pies, 
Oh, dear! what a 
beautiful boy." 
Now ladies, beware of love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am, I 
shall steal all youf hearts; 
And then, sweet, dear little creatures, you'll sigh. 
And doat on my charms till you'll languish and die. 
For you know I 
can't marry you all, 
But believe me whenever you call, 
My endeavors shall be to please all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy. 
THE COCKNEY SPORTSMAN. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
AIR .—Derry Down. 
When the very first day to the field I 
had got, 
I 
discovered great natural parts as a 
shot; 
My spaniel had put up a 
snipe from a 
bog, 
I 
missed it, I 
own, but I 
brought down the dog, 
Down, down, down, derry down, &e. 
So keen my 
first hunt, I 
brushed over the grounds, 
I 
decidedly distanced the fox and the hounds; 
And I 
leaped my first hedge with so earnest a 
mind, 
That I 
left a 
fine gelding I 
rode on, behind. 
Down, down, down, derry down, &e. 
PAUL PRY SON GSTER.

But time and experience have rendered me cool, 
And I 
counsel young sportsmen to think of this

When you go out shooting, don't shoot your dog 
dead, 
But take a 
good aim and bring your game down 
°instead.

UMBRELLA COURTSHIP. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
A belle and a 
beau would walking go, 
In love they both were pining; 
'The wind in gentle gales did blow, 
An April sun was shining. 
'Though Simon long had courted Miss, 
He knew he'd acted wrong in 
Not having dared to steal a 
kiss; 
Which set her quite a- longing. 
Tol ol 
It so occurred as they did walk, 
And viewed each dale so flow'ry, 
As Simon by her side did stalk, 
Declared the sky looked show'ry. 
The rain came to her like a 
drug, 
When loudly he did bellow, 
`"Look here, my love, we can be snug, 
For I've got an umbrella." 
Tol ol 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER

Quick flew the shelter over Miss; 
Now Simon was a 
droll one, 
He thought this was the time to kiss, 
So from her lips he stole one. 
She blushed; the rain left off, and he 
The umbrella closed for draining; 
"Oh! don't," said she, " I 
plainly see, 
It hasn't left off raining." 
Tol ol ol. 
Now Simon, when he srnok'd the plan, 
The umbrella righted, 
He grew quite bold, talked like a 
man, 
And she seemed quite delighted. 
Their lips rung chimes full fifty times, 
Like simple lovers training; 
Says she, " these are but lovers' crimes, 
I 
hope it won't leave off raining." 
Tol ol ol. 
He kissed her out of her consent, 
That she'd become his bride; hence 
' 
To buy the ring was his intent, 
And then to buy the license. 
They parted, but he took much pains, , 
Where they should meet to tell her, 
Says she, " I'll meet when next it rains, 
So bring your umbrella." 
Tol ol ol. 
The wedding morn, no time to waste, 
He arose before ' twas yet day; 
And just as if to please her taste, 
It was a 
shocking wet day. 
They married were, had children dear, 
Eight round-faced little fellows; 
But strange to state the whole of the eight, 
Were marked with umbrellas.

ONVE'N FAWCETT'S 
TOMMY DODD. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett, in Boucicault's drama of " After Dark," 
at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. 
I 
lead a 
somewhat easy life, like most men about 
town, 
But still I 
must submit to you, I'm somewhat of 
renown; 
A speeulative turn of mind, it, may seem rather 
odd, 
I 
have a 
weakness, and it is a 
love for " Tommy 
Dodd." * 
Chorus.—I'm always safe when I 
begin, Tommy 
Dodd, Tommy Dodd, . 
Glasses round, segars as well, Tommy 
Dodd, Tommy Dodd; 
Now, my boys, let's all go in, Tommy 
Dodd, Tommy Dodd, 
Head or tail, I'm safe to win, hurrah for 
Tommy Dodd. 
In town, if you meet a 
friend, you cannot let him 
pass, 
Of course you must do something, you then pro-
pose a 
glass; 
Now if I 
meet a 
chum or two, I 
hail them with a 
nod, 
Propose for each a 
full grown dose, but submit 
Tommy Dodd. 
Chorus.—I'm always safe, &c. 
You've no idea the run of luck which I 
have found 
the rule, 
Attends you if you go in " hot," of course remain-
ing " cool;" 
A 
purse is just in case of need, for you can ride 
rough shod, 
And live like any fighting-cock if you're up to 
Tommy Dodd. 
snorus.—I'm always safe, &c. 
* 
Meaning, to

A friend of mine three daughters had, he asked 
me home to tea, 
I played and sung, when by-and-by, they aU 
spooned on to me; 
I 
could'nt court the lot, you know, for that would 
seem so odd, 
So I 
proposed that they'd decide by the way of 
Tommy Dodd. 
Chorus.—I'm always safe, &c. 
THE COBBLER AND HIS WIPE. 
Sang by Owen Fawcett, in the character of " Mustapha," the 
Cobbler, in the " Forty Thieves." 
Last week I 
took a 
wife, 
And when I 
first did woo her, 
I 
vowed I'd stick through life, 
Like cobblers wax unto her; 
But soon we fell, by some mishap, 
At loggerheads together, 
And when my wife began to strap, 
Why I 
began to leather. 
Sing, ri fol de lal, &c. 
Now, I'm a 
quiet man, 
I 
never make a 
riot; 
But strive—do all I 
can, 
To make my wife keep quiet; 
She has such a 
scolding tongue, 
But I've found how to stop her, 
Now, says I, " My dear you're wrong," 
And then she gets a 
whopper. 
Sing, ri fol de lal, & c. 
My wife, without her shoes, 
Is scarcely three feet seven; 
While I, to all men's views, 
Am 
full five feet eleven.

When to take her down some pegs, 
I 
drubbed her neat and clever, 
She made a 
bolt right through my legs, 
And ran away forever. 
Sing, ri fol de lal, & c. 
But now she's gone, good lack, 
My hair like hog's hair bristled; 
Thinks I, she'll ne'er come back, 
So I 
went to work and whistled. 
0! let her go, I've got my stall, 
Which may no robber rifle, 
T ' would break my heart to lose my awl, 
To lose my wife's a 
trifle.

Sure mortal man was born for sorrow, 
Grief to- day, and grief to morrow, 
Here I'm snubbed, and there I'm rated, 
I\Ver was a

There Mrs. Bell swears none can trick hcr, 
And if I

For every drop I 
drink she charges, 
And our small beer's as sour as warges. 
Oh, Lackaday! 
Pity, Billy Lackaday. 
Poor Susan scolds and when I've heard her, 
I 
dreams all night of love and murder:, 
I 
sighs, I 
groans like any paviour, 
Forgetting all genteel be -haviour! 
Miss Fanny, oh! she has undone me; 
Like any queen, looks down upon me, 
And when I

It aint no use, it's wieey-warcey!

BUTTER AND CHEESE. 
ann.f,, by Owen Fawcett at the Walnut Street Theatre, Phila-
delphia, and Theatre Royal Montreal. 
I 
ve just come out before you all for to try for to 
sing, 
I 
fear it's not in my power to do any such thing, 
But since you're inclined to hear me bawl, I'll try 
what I 
can do, 
And if I 
come to a 
chorus, why, you may join in 
too. 
Why you may join in too. 
A cook I 
had for my sweetheart, I'll tell you the 
reason why, 
At Christmas she baked plum puddings, likewise 
she made mince pie ; 
Her master's cupboard was full of stores, and she 
did keep the keys, 
One pocket she filled with butter, and the other 
she tilled with cheese. 
And the other she filled with cheese. 
One pocket she filled with butter, about three 
pound or more, 
And in cutting off the cheese, her master came 
thumping at the door; 
She being in a 
quand'ry what to do, bade me up 
the chimney fly, 
And up into the chimney went butter, cheese and I. 
Went butter, cheese and I. 
had'ut been up the chimney above an hour at 
most; 
When the butter began to melt, and the cheese 
began to toast. 
The old man sat by the fireside; he thought the 
devil was there, 
For every drop that fell in the fire, oh, lord I 
how 
it did flare. 
Oh, lord ! how it did flare. 
44 
OWEN FAWCETT'S 
The master he went to the top of the house, but 
not a 
word did he say, 
Thinking that some water might drive this devil 
away; 
And sure enough, it came pouring clowns fast as 
it could tall, 
And I 
came tumbling after, butter, and cheese, and 
all. 
Butter and cheese, and all. 
And I 
came tumbling after, with my sooty and 
greasy face; 
Out of the front door I 
did run, and through the 
streets did pace; 
The dogs did bark, and the children did cry as 
loud as they could bawl, 
And the old women cried out of the windows 
there goes butter, and cheese, and all. 
There goes butter, and cheese, and all. 
MY LOVE IIE IS A. SAILLEUR BOY.

THE WORDS BY CHAS. M. WALCOT, SR. 
My love he is a 
sailleur boy, so galliant and bold, 
lie's as tall as a 
flag-staff, scarcely nineteen years 
old; 
For to cruise round this wide world he has left his 
own dear, 
And my heart it is a-busting because he is not here. 
Chorus.— For his spirit was tre-men-duous, 
And fierce to behold, 
In a 
young man bred a 
carpentier, 
Only nineteen years old. 
Ifis parients they bound him for to be a 
carpentier, 
But a 
seafaring life he did very much prefer—

THE SEWING MACHINE. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
am a 
most unlucky elf, I 
wish I'd ne'er been born, 
For I've been chiselled of my pelf, and then left 
quite forlorn; 
By a 
deceitful feminine, named Gingeretta Green, 
Who worked like " bricks" from 
six, at a 
Singer's Sewing Machine. 
Chorus.—Pvc lost my heart, 0 
dear 
I've been bamboozled clear, 
By that female fair, with the flaxen hair, 
Who worked at the sewing machine. 
I 
saw her first in Chestnut Street, as I 
walked out 
one day, 
And daily since, I 
did evince a 
wish to pass that 
way; 
She looked a 
useful sort of girl, about " sweet 
seventeen," 
And I 
fell in love with this young dove, who 
worked at the sewing machine. 
For I've lost my heart, & c. 
I 
took her to the Walnut, Owen Fawcett to see 
play, 
Hops, balls, and routs I 
took her out, we did the 
thing so gay; 
She moved so nimbly on her feet so graceful, neat 
and clean, 
No damsel them could dance, I 
swear,,like Ginger-
retta Green. 
For I've lost my heart & c. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
47 
Companions and acquaintances she'd often with 
her bring, 
While I 
stood " Sam" just like a 
lamb, and paid 
for everything; 
She said she wished to " work at home" and as I 
was'nt mean, 
I 
gave one night, forty dollars quite, to purchase 
a 
sewing machine. 
For I've lost my heart, & c. 
Next morning we went to Singer's, a 
first class 
one did buy, 
I 
saw her to her domicile, then home did quickly 
hie; 
She promised she would marry me, just three 
weeks from thai clay, 
And, crikey my, 0 did'ut I 
just wish my time 
away. 
For I've lost my heart, &c. 
But when she got her instrument, she left me in 
the lurch, 
And with some counter jumper chap, she hastened 
off to church; 
They laughed and called me " spooney," said I 
was jolly green, 
Enjoyed the fun, and I 
was done, clean out of my 
sewing machine. 
For I've lost my heart, &c. 
Young men a warning take by me, all sewing 
machine girls shun, 
Don't set ' em up in business, or you'll be surely 
" 
clone;" 
No doubt I 
do deserve it, because I 
was so green, 
But still it's hard to lose your girl, and also your 
sewing machine. 
For I've lost my heart, &c.

(Spoken.) 
POLITICAL. 
When politicians in fear and doubt, 
That they should be from place kicked out, 
Get up ' gainst time and sense to spout 
A long, dull evening through; 
What mean they, then, by party clique? 
Mob orators and factions weak ? 
'Tis only, would they truth then speak, 
But cock-a-doodle-doo. • 
Cock-a- doodle, cock-a-doodle,cock-a-doodle-doo. 
(Spoken.) 
COMMERCIAL. 
When companies whose stock of cash 
Directors spend to cut a 
dash, 
Are formed to advertise, and smash, 
And bankruptcy go through; 
When tradesfolks' live in regal state, 
The goods they sell adulterate, 
And puff in print, why, what's their prate? 
But cock-a- doodle doo.

AMATORY. 
When woman, lovely woman sighs, 
You praise her lips, her cheeks, her eyes, 
And swear by all the tenderest ties, 
And vow your vows are true; 
She answers tenderly and low, 
The words that from her lips do flow 
Are softly sweet; but yet we know 
Are naught but cock-a-doodle-doo.

MISS DEBORAH DODDLE, AND SIR GIL-
BERT GOSOFTLY. 
You may talk of sweet passion, of wishing and 
wooing, 
Of ecstacies, blushes and darts, 
Of altars and turtles, of billing and cooing, 
Flaming torches and fond, bleeding hearts; 
But the truest of lovers ever was seen 
In city or town, great or small, 
Was Miss Deborah Doddle, Miss Deborah Doddle 
of Daisy- mead Green, 
And Sir Gilbert Gosoftly of Gooseberry Hall. 
The virgin was fifty, her head very taper; 
Her mouth large, and nose rather fiat, 
Iler complexion as blooming as whity brown 
paper; 
She'd but one eye, and squinted at that. 
For an excellent rib she was formed too, I 
ween, 
Since terribly crooked withal, 
Was Miss Deborah Doddle, Miss Deborah Doddle 
of Daisy- mead Green, 
For Sir Gilbert Gosoftly of Gooseberry Hall. 
The knight once a sad race had run when in 
clover, 
But his running had come to a 
dreg; 
For now he was poor, and sixty got over, 
Besides that he had but one leg; 
But titled was he, and she rich as a 
queen, 
These in love with each other did fall, 
Sweet Miss Deborah Doddle, Miss Deborah Doddle 
of Daisy-mead Green, 
And Sir Gilbert Gosoftly of Gooseberry Hall. 
The knight caught a 
fever in toasting her merits, 
Took physic, and that made him die; 
When the grief of the fair one so consumed all 
her spirits,

drop in her eye. 
And such fond, constant love from oblivion to 
screen,

tombstone so tall, •

of Daisy-mead Green, 
And Sir Gilbert Gosoftly of Gooseberry Hall. 
THE LANCASHIRE LASS! 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. Published by Lee St Walker, No. 722 
Chestnut Street, Philadelphia. 
You may talk of young girls, but none can surpass, 
My dear little charmer who comes from Oldham, 
Fresh and as sweet as the newly mown grass; 
Is my little Polly, the Lancashire Lass. 
Her eyes so blue, and teeth so white, 
Her hair is brown, her step is light; 
Her ankle is a 
perfect mite, 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
Chorus.—My Lancashire Lass, sure none can 
surpass, 
My Lancashire 
Lass, for 
style 
and 
beauty; 
My Lancashire Lass, conic fill up your 
glass, 
And drink to the health of my Lancashire 
Lass. 
The way that I 
won her is strange, you will say, 
'Twas one afternoon that I 
went to Bellevue; 
A young friend of mine was there for the day, 
And took little Polly for whom he'd to pay. 
When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his chance ' twas all U. P; 
And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &c., 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
She said she'd be mice and swore to be true, 
We've since been like doves billing and cooing, 
We never fall out, as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you. 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
I 
she don't mind, we'll don't care; 
She says that her future I 
shall share, 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My beautiful Lancashire, &c. 
She's published the banns, we're going to wed, 
I 
leave those matters for her to settle, 
To morrow, for time has so quickly fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led. 
I 
need not work, whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea Pm not averse, 
And perhaps—one day I'll have to nurse 
A sweet little Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &c. 
UP IN A BALLOON. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
One night I 
went up in a 
balloon, 
On a 
voyage of discovery to visit the moon, 
Where an old man dwells, so some people say, 
"Through cutting of sticks on a 
Sunday." 
Up went the balloon, quickly higher and higher, 
Over house-top and chimney- top, town and spire; 
I 
knocked off the monument's top very nigh, 
And caught hold of the cross of St. Paul's going 
by. 
Chorus.—Up in a 
balloon, up in a 
balloon, 
All among the little stars, sailing round 
the moon, 
Up in a 
balloon, up in a 
balloon, 
It's something awful jolly to- be up in a 
balloon.

Up, up I 
was borne with terrible power, 
At the rate of ten thousand five hundred an hour; 
The air was cold, the wind blew loud, 
I 
narrowly escaped being choked by a 
cloud. 
Still up I 
went till surrounded by stars, 
And such planets as Jupiter, Venus and Mars; 
The big and the little bear loudly did growl, 
And the dog- star, on seeing me, set 9p a 
howl. 
Up in a 
balloon, &c. 
I 
met shooting stars, who were bent upon sport, 
But who shot in a 
very strange manner, I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks, I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the milky way. 
I 
counted the stars till at last I 
thought 
I 
had found out how much they were worth by 
the quart; 
An unpolite " ZErolite," who ran ' gainst my ear, 
Would'nt give " e'er a 
light" to light my segar. 
Up in a 
balloon, &c. 
Next a 
comet went by midst fire like hail, 
To give me a 
lift I 
seized hold of his tail ; 
To where he was going I 
did'nt inquire, 
We'd gone past the moon till we could'nt get 
hig her. 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost! don't think I 
joke, 
When somehow I 
felt a 
great shock—I 
awoke; 
When instead of balloon, moon and planets I 
saw, 
I'd tumbled from off of my bed to the floor. 
And there was no balloon, there was no 
balloon, 
There were not any planets, and there 
was'nt any moon; 
So never sup too heavy, or, by jingo, 
, very soon, 
You're like to fancy you are going vp 
in a 
balloon. 
I KNOW NOT WHY I LOVE THEE. 
---
I 
know not why I 
love thee, 
Thou dost not think of me, 
But still my heart will wander 
Forever back to thee: 
But still my heart will wander, 
Forever back to thee. 
A magic spell is round me, 
My spirit to enchain, 
I 
struggle to forget thee, 
To free my heart again; 
I 
struggle to forget thee, 
To flee my heart again. 
Perchance thou ne'er didst love me, 
But e'er my spirit wing 
'Twill hover round thy pathway, 
A fond though viewless thing; 
'Twill hover round thy pathway, 
A fond though viewless thing. 
And in that better world, love, 
In Heaven's delicious clime, 
Amidst seraphic millions, 
My spirit shall seek thine; 
Amidst seraphic millions, 
My spirit shall seek thine. 
TIMMY BOYLE. 
(Music published by Lee & Walker, No. 722 Chestnut Street, 
Philadelphia.) 
There was a 
little man who kept a 
little store, 
And had a 
little sign above his little door; 
In little letters black was written Timmy Boyle, 
And there from morn till night this little man did 
toil. 
5*

OWL.N FAIVCI.TT'S 
But one unlucky day this little Timmy Boyle, 
Made up his little mind to speculate in oil ; 
He sold off all the goods he'd laid on the shelf, 
And then, the little fool, he went and sold himself. 
Ile bought up many shares, and thought his fortune 
made, 
But little Timmy Boyle knew little of the trade; 
The more he bought up stocks, the more the stocks 
went down, 
'Till a 
poorer little man there could not well be 
found. 
(Very slow.) 
So one dark, stormy night, when. every one was 
gone, 
This little Timmy Boyle thought something must 
be wrong; 
He bought a 
little rope, blew out his little light., 
And then he put an end unto his little life. 
A 
jury soon was called to ascertain the cause, 
Why little Timmy Boyle had thus defied the laws; 
A 
verdict they returned, that little Timmy Boyle 
Had came unto his death from a 
little too much oil. 
My path of life is choked with weeds, I'm wearily; 
them because 
My late lamented husband's gone; oh! what a 
man he was. 
I 
am his relict, now, alas, reduced to skin and bones, 
Thro' mourning, day and night, the late lamented 
31r. Jones.

Oh, what a

We used to keep a 
public house, ' twas called the 
"Lover's Arms," 
And lots of nice young men came in, attracted by

They'd squeeze my hand, and talk to me in such 
bewitching tones, 
Which often raised the ire of the late lamented Mr. 
Jones. 
I 
mourn all day, &c. 
He trusted me with any one, and never had a 
doubt, 
The last at night, who came to bed, would put the 
candle out;

Some forward chap I 
saw just now, was laughing 
at my woe; 
But though I'm bound to pass the time in tears, 
and sighs, and moans, 
I 
a 
successor yet may find to the late lamented 
Mr. Jones.

mourn all day, &c.

SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
.4 
I 
sing you a 
ditty, of a 
damsel so pretty, 
.Who lived from the city some seventeen miles; 
Her name is Maria, her worthy old sire, 
Was clerk and town crier—his name was John 
Styles. 
With lips, like a 
cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please, 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her, 
For worse or for better, she was shelling green peas. 
Chorus.— Under the trees, a 
bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silently shelling green peas. 
I'd long loved her dearly, truly, sincerely, 
At length, I 
thought really I'd settle in life : 
Though aged fifty, I'd been very thrifty, 
And thought ' twas high time lobe taking a 
wife. 
My bosom on fire, in search of Maria, 
Through lanes of wild briar, o'er shadowed by 
trees, 
I 
strolled to the spot where, outside her cot, there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
Under the trees, & c. 
I 
step up unto her, commencing to woo her, 
I 
said, " That no truer fond heart could be found 
Than mine, if she'd take me some morning, and 
make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round." 
I 
said, " Our life would be one round of delight, 
Like the little birds singing upon the green trees." 
To a whisper, then, dropping my voice without 
stopping, 
The•question was popping, as she popped the 
pen9. 
Under the trees, &e. 
60 
OWEN FAWCETT'S 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid, 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said. 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be stealing 
A 
kiss—when came reeling her hand on my head; 
" 
Do you think I'd engage, she cried out in a 
rage, 
With a man twice my age, so clear out if you 
please.'' 
Ifo a 
terrible passion, at me she send crashing, 
On my head smashing, the bowl of green peas. 
Under the trees, & c. 
Iv way of addenda, she said, " Sir, remember, 
That May and December can never unite, 
Your leave, sir, 
be taking;" my neck nearly 
breaking, 
I 
made my escape in a 
terrible fright. 
I 
never will marry, but single will tarry 
Though friends and acquaintance do nothing 
but tease, 
Whenever they meet me, in this style they greet 
me, 
" 
Old boy, what's the price now of lamb and 
green peas ?" 
Yes, how they tease, whenever they please, 
By shouting out after me, " Lamb and green 
peas." 
Under the trees, &c. 
THE CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW I MET 
ON THE THIAN. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
Whilst in New Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
Prom Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle; it stated: fast he was dying, 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
.few things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage, 
A charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
PArL PRY SONGSTER. 
61 
An infant she had so fondly caressing; 
1. ventured to ask if that was her own? 
She answered in words appearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again! 
In fact, fast to my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was the charming • young widow I 
met on the 
train. 
As the train it was stopped, the engine to water, 
She asked me in a 
hurry—Would I 
be so kind 
tier infant to take it, the darling so quiet? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into, 
The signal for starting I 
heard; but in vain,. 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train started 
without 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror! it was dead ! 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note—which on reading, 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged me to bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
How quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound— 
The sweet little creature asleep was, she told me; 
Quite dead asleep— so, in truth, I 
found. 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain; . 
On the stone was inscribed—Underneath was be-
queathed me 
By a*charming young widow I 
met on the train.

OUT JOHN. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett. 
Out John, out John, what are you about John? 
If you don't say out at once, you make the fellow 
doubt, John, 
Say I'm out whoever calls, and hide my hat and 
cane, John, 
Say you've not the least idea when 
shall come 
again, John, 
Let the people leave their bills, but tell them not 
to call, John, 
Say I'm courting Miss Rupee, and mean to pay 
them all John. 
Chorus.—Out John, run John. What are you 
about John? 
If you don't say out at once, you make 
the fellow doubt, John. 
Run, John! run, John, there's another dun, John, 
if it's Podger, bid him call to- morrow week at 
one, John, 
If he says he saw me at the window as he knocked, 
John, 
Make a 
face and shake your head, and tell him you 
are shocked, John; 
Take your pocket-handkerchief and mit it to your 
eye, John, 
your master's not the man to bid you tell a 
lie, John. 
Out, John! out, John, & c. 
Oh, John! go, John, there's Noodle's knock, I 
know, John; 
Tell him that all yesterday you sought him high

Tell him just before he came, you saw me mount 
the hill, John; 
Say yon think Pm only gone to pay his little hill, 
John;

Then I

You're sure I 
mean to call when next I 
pass his 
way, John. 
Out, John! out, John, &c. 
Hie, John! fly, John, I 
will tell you why, John, 
If there is not Grimshaw at the corner, may I 
die, John, 
He will hear of no excuse, I'm sure he'll search

Peeping into corners hardly fit to hold a

Beg he'll take a

Out, John! out, John, &c. 
LET THE TOAST BE DEAR WOMAN. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett and W. Lanning Street, at the Walnut 
Street Theatre. 
Bright, bright are the beams of the morning skies, 
And sweet dew the red blossom sips, 
But brighter the glances of dear woman's eyes, 
And sweet is the dew on her lips; 
Her mouth is the fountain of rapture, 
A source -from whence purity flows. 
Oh! who would not taste of its magic, 
As the honey- bee sips of the rose? 
Chorus. 
Then the toast, then the toast be " dear woman," 
Let each breast that is manly approve; 
Then the toast, then the toast, be " dear woman," 
And nine cheers for the girls that we love. 
Hip! hip! hurrah! hip! hip! hurrah! • 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
And nine cheers for the girls that we love.

OWES FAWCETT'S 
Come, raise, raise the wine cup to heaven high; 
Ye gods of Olympus approve, 
The offering thus mellowed by woman's bright 
eye, 
Out-rivals the nectar of .Jove. 
Then drain, drain the goblet with transport; 
A. spell of life's best joy impart; 
The cup thus devoted to woman, 
Yields the only true balm to the heart. 
Then the toast, &c. 
BEAUTIFUL NELL. 
Don't talk to me of pretty girls, 
Of lovely women don't! 
I'll never listen to a 
word, 
I 
won't, no, that I 
won't ! 
There's not a 
beauty in the land 
To match my peerless belle; 
I'll tell you all about my love, 
My beautiful, my Nell. 
Whist/e.—Beautiful girl with beautiful eyes, 
Bright as the morning and blue as the 
skies, 
Beautiful teeth and hair as well, 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Nell. 
We met, ' twas in a 
crowd, you know, 
As some one somewhere sings; 
The scene a 
ball room, where I 
mark'd 
This angel wanting wings. 
She floated in the gay quadrille, 
Mazourka'd, polk'd as well; 
But whirling wildly in the waltz, 
The darling tripped and tell. 
Spoken.—Exposing the smallest portion of the 
heel of a 
Cinderella slipper— oh, 
Beautiful girl, &c. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
I 
pick'd her up most tenderly, 
And ask'd if she was hurt, 
Convey'd her to an ottoman, 
And then began to flirt. 
She told she was just eighteen, 
Was reading Martin Tupper, 
Was fond of strolls in moonlit groves, 
And thought she'd have some supper 
Beautiful girl, &c. 
At slipper, lobster salad, love, 
And chicken we discuss'd, 
We gabbled and we gobbled, as 
All supping lovers must; 
We champagn'd, sherri'd, and mosell'd, 
Each time the bottle past, 
Rethought each smile the darling gave 
Was lovelier than the last. 
Beautiful girl, &c. 
I 
think, somehow, the wine I 
drank 
had made me all amiss, 
Or why, was I 
fool enough 
To try and steal a 
kiss ? 
" 
Oh, some one fetch my husband, do !" 
She scream'd out in affright— 
" 
Married, by jingo !" I 
exclairn'd 
And did a " fly by night." 
Beautiful girl, &c. 
A 
sadder and a 
wiser man, 
I 
reached my home once more, 
And madly raving at my lot, 
My raven hair I 
tore; 
I'm wretched as a 
man can be, 
And farewell ! Oh, farewell ! 
To that sweet, dear, deceiving dream, 
My beautiful, my Nell. 
Beautiful girl, &c.

THE MUSICIAN AND THE DANCER.. 
AIR.—The Cork Leg. 
His name was Herr Tuyfel, and we understand 
That he played the bassoon in an orchestra band ; 
A portly young Dutchman, quite gallant and tall, 
With a 
yellow mustachio admired by all. 
Chorus.—Ri too ral lu, &c. 
Her name was La Sylphide, a 
native of France, 
And in the theatre she used for to dance; 
0, she was bewitching, and in the Can- Can 
She could, with her toes, kick the hat off a 
man. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
And Herr Tuyfel, the Dutchman, while she danced 
and he played, 
Cast many a 
sheep's eye at this pretty maid; 
And he'd blow, and he'd blow, while he fondly 
thought bow 
lie would relish his lager if she was his frow. 
RI too ral, &c. 
And, one evening, La Sylphide she happened one 
eye 
To cast down on Herr Tuyfel—it knocked him 
sky-high! 
He blew, and he blew till he got out of breath— 
Her glance the young Dutchman most tickled to 
death. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
lie wrote her a 
letter, he called her his " dove," 
He swore he was dying by inches in love; 
To smile on her lover his angel he bid, 
lie asked her his heart to accept— and she did. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
PAUL FRY SONGSTER. 
07 
He was smitten completely, and, joking apart, 
She had captured Herr Tuyfel, and stolen his 
heart; 
He bought her silk dresses, and rings one or two; 
He swore to be constant—she swore to be true. 
Ri too ral, &e. 
But fierce wais his anger, and great hs surprise, 
When, one night, on another she cast both her 
eyes; 
lie watched her quite closely, and, what do you 
think? 
Why, at the base drummer she gave a 
sly wink! 
Ri too ral, &c. 
He thought of the dresses, he thought of the rings, 
lie thought of her promise, her kisses and things; 
"False! False!" shrieked Herr Tuyfel, " I 
see it at 
last!" 
And he seized his basson, and he blew a 
loud blast! 
Hi too ral, &c. 
And he blew, and he blew a 
most horrible blow; 
La Sylphide got frightened, and fainted, you know; 
But he blew for an hour and then didn't stop 
'Till he blew of his head a 
large hole in the top! 
Ri too ral, &c. 
But little to tell you, my dear friends, remains— 
He blew, and he blew till be blew out his brains; 
And the flitkle La Sylphide—you can guess what's 
to come, 
She married the fellow who played the base drum!

THE DUTCH BARBER; 
OR ROOTLE-TIIM TOOTLE- TOM TAY. 
Sung by Owen Fawcett, 
in 
the character 
of " Gregory 
Dygell" in the play of " The Orange Girl," at the Wal-
nut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. 
I 
will now then my troubles unfold, ; 
You must know I've been sold, 
And I'm sure when my story I've told, 
Badly treated I've been you will say. 
By a 
cook who was called Sarah Jane? 
Sarah Jane was her name, 
But I 
hope I'll never see her again, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Chorus.—Tho' I 
vowed that I 
never would leave 
her, 
She turned out a 
cruel deceiver; 
Rootle-tum, tootle- turn, tootle-turn, 
Tootle- turn, tootle- turn tag. 
Now I 
met this cook first in the park, 
Central Park, just near dark, 
And I 
ventured to make a 
remark; 
That it was a 
very cool day! 
She answered me not at all bold, 
That it was very cold; 
Her name and address she then told, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-tum tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, & c. 
Sarah Jane was a 
frisky young maid, 
And good wages was paid, 
And at the fine house where she stayed 
I 
called on her most ev'ry day. 
But one evening she drove me quite mad, - 
Yes, quite mad, ' twas too bad; 
A dutch barber beside her she had, 
Rootle-tum, tootle- turn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, &c.

" 
Mister Dutchman," says I, " this looks queer, 
Swilling here lager beer; 
But you ain't got no biz'ness down here, 
So listen to what I 
now say. 
If I 
catch you again here, forsooth, 
It's the truth though uncouth, 
I 
will darken your eyes, my sweet youth," 
Rootle-tum, tootle-tutn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, &c. 
" 
Now," said he; " vy to you interfere, 
Mit us here, o'er our peer; 
I've as much right as you to pe here, 
Und I'll leave it to Sarah to say." 
"Now, then, miss, your affections I'll test— 
Do not jest, I 
protest," 
And the barber she vowed she loved best, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, &c. 
That she loved me I 
firmly believed, 
But how soon was deceived; 
Tho' it's no use now being grieved, 
For he married and took her away. 
I 
wish him much joy of this belle, 
What a 
sell I 
must tell; 
I 
hear that she lathers him well, 
Lathers and bastes him each day!

A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW. 
With my jug in one hand and my pipe in my other, 
I'll drink to my neighbor and friend, 
My cares in a 
whiff of tobacco I'll smother, 
For life I 
know shortly I 
must end, 
Whiles Ceres most kindly refills my brown jug 
With good ale I 
will make myself mellow; 
In my old wicker chair I 
will seat myself snug, 
Like a 
jolly and true-hearted fellow. 
I'll ne'er trouble my head with the cares of the 
nation, 
I've enough on my own for to mind; 
For the cares of this life are but grief and vexation, 
To death we must all be consign'd. 
PAUL PRY SONGSTER. 
71 
Then we'll laugh, drink, and smoke, and leave 
nothing to pay, 
But drop like a 
pear that is mellow; 
And when cold in my coffin 
leave them to say, 
He's gone, what a 
jolly good fellow. 
THE LITTLE MAID. 
There was a 
little maid, and she had a 
little bonnet, 
She had a 
little finger, with a 
little ring upon it, 
And what's a 
little odd, her little heart was then 
in love—but not a 
little with the best of little men. 
For the little youth had exercised his flattering 
tongue, 
And down before her little feet his little knees he 
flung; 
lie pressed her little hand, and in her little face he 
gazed, 
And looked as if his little head had been a 
little 
crazed. 
Alas, her little lover did with little warning leave 
her, 
And she found him little better than a 
little gay' 
deceiver; 
Then in a 
little moment, stifling all with her little 
wishes, 
She took a 
little jump all among the little fishes. 
Now, all you little maidens, whose little love grows 
fonder, 
Upon the little moral of this little story ponder; 
Beware of little trinkets, little men, and little sighs, 
For you little know what great things from little 
things may rise.

OUR OLD TOM CAT. 
!AIR—" ivy Green." 
A downy old cove is our old Torn cat, 
Just turned of thirty years old; 
He eats all the lean, and leaves all the fat, 
And wont touch his meals if they're cold. 
His food must be crumbled and not decayed, 
To pleasure his dainty whim: 
And a 
turkey bone that never was touched, 
Makes a 
jolly blow out for him. 
Cho.—Creeping over the tiles so pat, 
And crying " Mew," does our old Tom cat. 
Old joints have fled and the bones decayed, 
And the dishes have broken been ; 
But old Torn still follows the kitchen maid, 
And slyly licks up all the cream. 
And our old Tom cat in his lonely days 
Will joyfully think of the past, 
And a 
big leg of mutton that never was touched, 
Will be food for Tommy at last. 
Creeping, &e. 
Fast he flies tho' he has no wings, 
And a 
sly old soldier is ho; 
Close under the window, " Mew" he sings, 
, "Ain't you coming out to-night, love," says he; 
Then slyly he creepeth the gutters all round, 
And his old tail he joyously waives, 
As his lady love from a 
garret he spies, 
Then he sings her his amorous staves.
