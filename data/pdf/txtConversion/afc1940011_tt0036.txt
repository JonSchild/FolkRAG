GREEK RECORDINGS AT TARPON SPRINGS, FLORIDA Recorded by John Filareton,
May 12, 1940.
Records are here numbered in proper sequence as the ceremonies developed. The
occasion was the dedication of the building of Ladies Society, Philoptohus, (friend of the
poor) on May 12th, 1940, at Tarpon Springs, Florida. Religious services were conducted
by his Grace Archbishop Athenagoras, assisted by Rev. Father Karaphillis of Tarpon
Springs Greek Orthodox Church, St. Nicholas. Music and chants by the Byzantine choir
of the church, directed by Professor George Anastassiou. An impressive demonstration
of religious and patriotic fervor marked the services, which were similar to Greek Cross
services of Epiphany Day on January 6th.
RECORD NO. 1 — A
Agiasmos, the blessing of the water by Archbishop Athenagoras. At the conclusion of the
Bishop's sermon a basin of water is brought in to be blessed. During this ceremony the
Archbishop prays that God will send His Holy Spirit in blessing. He commemorates those
of the faithful who have departed to their final rest and calls upon the mother of God, all
the saints, spostles and prophets to join in his supplication for Divine mercy, for world
peace, the welfare of Christian people, strength and guidance for our President and rulers
and blessings on the Philoptohus Society and on all those participating in the services.
After each supplication the choir chants “ Kyrie eleison ” (Lord have mercy). At the end
of the prayer the Archbishop dips a small bunch of Vassilikos 2 — sweet basil — into the
blessed water and sprinkles the congregation with the sign of the cross, chanting, “ En
Iordani vaptisomen sou Kyrie ” — (Oh Lord, baptized in the Jordan). As this ceremony was

within the Easter period, however, the chant was changed to “ Christos Anesti ” (Christ
arisen) which is sung at all services for forty days following Easter.
During the blessing of the waters the voice of the assistant, Father Karaphillis, is heard
reciting the great Ectenia or supplication to God.
3881 RECORD NO. 1 — B
Reading from the New Testament by Prof. George Anastassiou, leading chanter of
the choir, the “ Apostolos, ” a portion of Acts or the letters of the Apostles in the New
Testament. This is read before the Bishop or priest reads from the Holy Bible the Gospel
of the day. Upon completion of the reading the choir chants “Alleluia” three times, then
again chants “ Doxa si Kyrie si ” (Glory to Thee, O Lord, Glory to Thee).
Native dances and music and a program of entertainment followed the religious services.
The musicians and their instruments were: George Kaletizis— Lavouto, Louis Kapsalos—
Violin, Charylaos (Harry) Parris— Santouri (Kimball).
The recorded native dance numbers were played entirely by ear as they were originated,
not by note because the peculiar rhythm, technique and expression of this music cannot
be written nor have they ever been written. Attempts of modern composers to duplicate
these tunes have resulted in nothing more than a mechanical interpretation of the melody
not the technique or true expression.

can interpret in the original spirit. At weddings this dance is usually led by kin and friends
of the groom to honor the newly married pair.

“Sousta” Island Halki Native Dance.
“Halkiticos, Sousta,” is a classic dance of the Island of Halki, and originated on the Asia
Minor Coast three to four thousand years ago. The natives adopted this dance, when the
only musical instrument which we now know was a small lyra, still used by these Islanders
and by the Island of Creta. This is danced in the manner of the Kalymnos Island style of
dancing, except at a more lively pace with faster steps.
NOTE: Although Mr. Filareton lists the following songs among those he recorded,
we cannot identify them. He has left the Writers' Project, and we are unable to get
more complete information from him. Perhaps they are the records we have marked
“Unidentified.”

and congregation. (Christos Anesti) “Christ arisen” is the Hymn sung by the angels when
Christ rose from the dead the third day, and is sung at the midnight services of Easter

hands clasped and with slow, short steps that bring out all its original dignity and grace.
