This is Warde Ford at Central Valley, California, singingMY MOTHER WAS A LADY.
Two drummers they were seated in a swell hotel one day;While dining, they were chatting in a jovial
sort of way.There came a purty waitress to bring a tray of food,When they spoke to her insultingly
in a manner rather rude.At first she didn't notice or make the least reply,'Til some remark was
made to her, brought teardrops to her eye.She turned on her tormentors, her cheeks were blushing
red,And posing as a picture, this is what she said,"My mother was a lady and your's yours you would
allow,And you may have a sister who needs protection now;I came to this big city to find my brother
dear,And you wouldn't dare insult me, sir, if brother Jack were here."They both sat there in silence,
their heads hung down in shame,Saying, "Forgive me, [miss?], I meant no harm; Oh, tell me what's
your name."She told him and he cried aloud, "I know your brother too,We've been friends for many
many years and he often speaks of you.Now, come with me when I go back and if you'll only wed,I'll
take you to him as my wife, 'cause I love you since you said,"My mother was a lady and [ your's ?]
yours you would allow,And you may have a sister who needs protection now;I came to this great city
to find my brother dear,And you wouldn't dare insult me, sir, if brother Jack were here. "
