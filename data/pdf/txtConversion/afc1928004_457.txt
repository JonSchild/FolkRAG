go by the name of the Johnsons. 
We're happy and gay as can be ; 
We work all day long and don't grumble, 
And have a 
nice chat after tea. 
I 
sit by Ins side while he's smoking his pipe, 
And sing them old songs that we sung 
While working away in the cotton ileitis, 
In them days when we were young. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'll :join bands together, 
Let the darkeys shout ani sing, 
Join us in our jubilee, 
And make the banjo ring. 
(Repeat.I 
Ws forty long years we've been married, 
And I've never been sorry one bit. 
I 
remember the cool sumnier evenings, 
When under the shade trees we'd sit.

DARLING LITTLE I-TARRY. 
I'm in love, Fin ashamed to confess it, 
For the wretch of a 
fellow is here ; 
heart, if he chose to possess it, 
surrender without any fear. 
But then, oh he treats me so coldly, 
And flirts, too, whenever be can. 
No matter what People have tom me, 
I'm ii love with the horrilde man. 
etiOBT:S. 
Yes, darling little Harry is the man I'd like to niarr-.• 
But make him out I 
really never can ; 
He is so fascinating I 
really almost hate him, 
For he is snob a 
handsome hal... man. 
While others betray their devotion, 
And carry their hearts to my feet, 
He shows not the slightest emotion, 
x 
or utters it word that is sweet. 
He knows very well that I 
like him, 
He knows he has stolen my heart. 
How happy I'd be could I 
strike him, 
That is, in the tenderest part. 
Yes, darling little Harry, etc, 
Sometimes I 
have thought he was trying 
My love just to put to the test, 
And then it is no use denying, 
lfy hand he has oftentimes pressed. 
It really is yery distressing, 
For my lwart on the fellow is set ; 
I'm sure he will soon come confessing, 
I 
know I 
shall conquer him yet. 
Yes, darling little Harry, etc.

OH, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old IllaSSa set us free ; 
tell you what did happen in her good old mother's 
cabin, 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio Inver, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkeys shiver. 
One night about eight we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
cnonts. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river ; 
And one night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tried to win my Rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be ; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she always 
shattered, 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee. 
I 
love when I look at her, she's black, but that's no 
matter. 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
hnce I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together ire from care or strife ; 
And it's nantral to snppos., we had a 
little Io!q,, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer ()f 
our life. 
Yet the winter of ( on. days will come, alas ! 
When sprinp., summer and autumn, too, will pass ; 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and I'll bless the happy 
day, 
When I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
written by WilliAm CAratoLL, and sung by HAttrus a-
ncl CAriRoLL. 
I 
EEMEMBEE, oh, how well, when you and I 
were young, 
But those very happy days have come and gone ; 
I 
am thinking of the past when we worked side by side, 
Picking cotton for our massa all day long. 
But he is dead and gone and. 
we do mourn his loss, 
He loved these poor old darkeys till death came ; 
We hope he's better off in that good old place, above, 
But will never see his dear old face again. 
CEIO 
We remember, oh, how well, our happy childhood's days, 
When we played outside the old log cabin door ; 
But them good old times have passed, we'll soon be laid 
away, 
And them happy days we'll never sec them more. 
But now we're growing old and our hair is turning gray, 
We cannot work much longer, that is true ; 
For our limbs are getting old, lyit I 
never will , 
When Arethusa and myself could shake a 
shoe. 
Alas I 
them glorious days are passed, our work is nearly 
done, 
If we could only 
ec.‘ them just once more, 
Oh, how happy we would be, for to dance the livelong 
day, 
But Fin thinking that our dancing days arc o'er. 
We remember, etc. 
DIABOLICAL STORY. _ 
Orlg!nally sung by BILLY CARTER 
IF 
you'll listen with your ears, 
For it couple of million years, 
A 
diabolical story I 
will tell ; 
It s 
about a 
-
female girl 
With red teeth and curly hair, 
And I 
loved her till my head began to swell. 
Her name was Susan Glue, 
And the grub she used to chew, 
She NVii-; a 
night clerk in a 
foundry over town ; 
She'd an alabaster claw-, 
And a 
double breasted jaw, 
And every bunion on her feet weighed a 
pound, 
One day she gave me the shake, 
And I 
thought my heart would break, 
When I 
heard sh. , was playing Hamlet on the stage ; 
She stole eleven or twenty dollars, 
And a 
lot of paper collars, 
And eloped with a 
bummer twice her age 
As a 
singer she is vile, 
And she hasn't got no style. 
And they'll kill her if she ever tries to dance. 
Oh, she stole my summer clothes, 
And I 
was nearly froze, 
And her bummer wears my bran new Sunday pants. 
If I 
ever meet her feller, 
I 
will bust him in the smeller, 
I 
am certain he Sill find an early grave ; 
1 
will split his ugly l
-Loloie, 
Ana 
kick him in the lung. 
With an Indian club his whiskers I 
will shave. 
I 
will sling a 
bottle of ink, 
And destroy Miss Susan Glue, 
And gently drop liar in the nearest sewer. 
I 
will think it kidney stew, 
And 
skip to Kalamazoo, 
For Jimmy Fresh he never went back on the poor.

Darling Bessie of the Lea." 
OH, I 
wander ' mill the roses, in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime : 
But far sweeter than the roses or the strealidet unto me, 
The snub-right face of  
"My 1\i'ary Ann." 
Oh, my Mary Ann, she's an artizan 
in it factory way down town ; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned feller::, 
And she lives six stories from the ground. 
in a 
brick tenement, where they cat up devilment 
Every night in the week and ever day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out -upon the sand  
BElle Brandon." 
'Nefith a 
tree by the margin of a 
woodland, 
Whose spreading leafy boughs sweep the ground, 
With a 
path leading thither o'er the prairie, 
Where silence hung her night garb around,— 
There oft I 
have wandered in the evening, 
When the summer winds were fragrant on the lea. 
There  
"I Cannot Sing the Old Songs." 
cannot sing the old songs 
I 
sung long years ago. 
For heart and voice would fail me, 
And foolish tears would -

For bygone hours come o'er my heart, 
With each familiar strain ;

Oh, Nancy Fat, she was a 
gal 
Fair and tall and slender : 
The fairest gal I 
ever saw 
In all the female gender. 
A 
lovely foot I 
know she had. 
Into a

Her ankles small were made for use

I

Oh, Nancy Fat

Thou host wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished time image for years ; 
Thou bast taught me at last to forget thee, 
in secret, in silence and tears. 
As a 
young bird, when left by its mother  
"Come and Kiss Me," 
She hugged me and she kisstA mo, 
She took me by the hand, 
She said I 
was the sweetest thing 
in the shape of mortal man. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
'My love WaS good and !trong; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me,— 
She told me to go ' long. 
Conic and kis:i me, 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me, Susie, 
Don't be mad wid me !

JOSEPHINE SLASHER. 
Wiitte-a 
Ly \Vm. CARROLL. 
IT 
was at a 
party I 
met Josephine, 
She was drinking sarsaparilla and bad benzine. 
She's the ugliest mortal that ever was born, 
With a 
big gum- boil upon her horn. 
Her hair was black as the driven snow, 
And the boys for short would call her Joe. 
She dressed in fashion from top to toe, 
But she was a 
terrible terrier. 
CHCLUS. 
She's very tart and dizzy, too, she is not very fat, 
But as pretty as a 
porcupine, and has green eyes like a 
cat. 
Her ears are pinned back to her head, she's as lively as a 
fka, 
Where'er she goes, her password is, 
Why, you'll remem-
ber me.' 
When supper Legan there was lots of fun, 
Louise, she got chock full of rum ; 
She jumped on the table and snatched a 
pie, 
And banged Mrs. ,Tones right in the eye. 
The table came down with a 
terrible crash, 
With all the dishes and plates of hash. 
She grasped a 
cleaver and commenced to slash, 
For she was a 
blood thirsty villain. 
She's very tart, etc. 
And then slic fired a 
rock which smashed an eight day 
clock. 
Oh, then, ves, then, she went right for tile men. 
The way sile slashed and swore, and like a 
bull did roar. 
Oh, yes, I 
guess they all made for the door. 
So gracefully and beautifully around the room 
rush. 
She grabbed the washboard from a 
tub, likewise a 
scrub-
ing brush. 
She smashed Bill Jinkins in the jaw, and pulverized his 
knee, 
And as she fought she yelled right out, " Why, you'll

She's very tart, etc. 
Originally snug by BILLY 4AItTrR. 
I'm. sing to you some woes of mine, 
About a 
gal so fair, 
With a 
hump-backed bunion on her nose, 
And brick- bat colored hair. 
I 
loved her as I 
loved my life, 
And she was gay, you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarienette. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke Italian Dutch ; 
And every time I 
caught hini there 
Yon bet I 
made hint dust, dust, dust. 
He -played for her night and day, 
And murdered old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold ; 
He told her of his bully home, 
And of his wealth untold. 
He played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat, 
He Mowed the brains out of his head, 
And spoiled his Sunday cravat. 
CHORUS. 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turned her head, 
He asked her if she'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to doetlI, 
With a 
whortleberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And I 
tried to cut ney.throat, 
I 
went alone to t 
beer saloon, 
For a 
wooden overcoat, 
C110:11.-S. 
I 
saw the gal lest week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a 
K. flat clarionette, 
With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says, old man, don't fret, 
'I've got two boys, you bet. 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a 
yellow clarionette.

THE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND HAS 
SEEN. 
As 
sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, NED BARRY. 
Now, sin e..z
s. I 
appear here, before you once more, 
endeavor to gain your fair smile ; 
Tho' years now- have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cline' to the dear native Isle. 
And I'll sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
will sing of the great men that's been ; 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart, 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Erin Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea , or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To ti great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell, you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman, whose equals were few ; 
At the great Parliament. he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet, the martyr, be fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel, his name it keeps green ; 
He died for his country and Li] erty's laws, 
Thos, were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Thon lil-Te's to the sons, etc. 
And then we had Sarstikld who conquered each foe, 
And never was known f
or t
o yi eld 
Tin' 
foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake. 
When his war horse would enter the field ; 
And then as for poet ,, 
there is no land ha sure. 
Where such brilliant genius has been ; 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Toni Mort« 
Those were gre at men that Ireland has seen. 
Then here's to the son;:, etc. 
But though those great men have m)w passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone ; 
1Ve have men that would die for their country to- day, 
And a 
parliannlit wish of their own. 
But may Clod guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancour or spleen ; 
But when honor demands them, they valiantly 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen. 
Then here's to the sons, etc.

NO' SMOKING ALLOWED.

Who's faithful whatever luck fortnne may send 
Wherever I

She was head cook in a

Where she learned to be a

And got three dollars every week 
For cutting out corns with a

One day her lover, with his ear chew(-A off,

And shot her with the shaving brush.

Or, the early part of life, with it; glory and its strife.

With fear and p•tinful tremor in the maze.

Who could sing a

In the green-gablud cabin in the vale ! 
In the good, rich Georgia State, where the chains of•bon-
dage great, 
Were put by heartless custom to our race ; 
And when the master gruff, would rPther give a 
cull', 
Than speak a 
civil sentence in its place. 
Quite often in the Eight, I'd shudder at the sight,

They're shouting for to get a

Then bless you, little children, won't you fall in the gang, 
Away up in the sky ? 
We're putting on our shoes and we won't be long, 
Away up in the sky.

NEVER DESERT A FRIEND. 
Sun,-; 
by NED BARRY witu great success. 
A 
3Lis who's close-fisted, and selfish, and mean, 
Is a 
man who would never suit me, 
For though I'm not wealthy I 
always have been, 
To my friends open-handed and free ; 
I 
don't think you're poorer for helping a 
friend 
With a 
dollar or two when in need, 
Bat you're certainly worse if you worship your purse, 
And give way to a 
miserly greed. 
CHORUS. 
Never give way to a 
stingy way, 
I 
don't say it's wise to lend ; 
right to put by for a 
rainy day, 
But not to desert a 
friend. 
Some men go on scraping and pinching to save. 
Till it makes them decrepit and old, 
And although they may stand on the brink of the grave, 
They'll be planning and scheming for gold. 
It's a 
sorrowful sight to see people who might 
Live in comfort and peace to the end, 
By their pitiful ways only shorten their days, 
To make money for others to spend. 
Never get into, etc. 
Now although I 
advise and I 
think it is wise, 
To be generous, honest and just, 
Don't imagine that I 
would not have you put by, 
And provide your old age with a 
crust ; 
For prudence will tell you there will come a 
day, 
When you'll find you are laid on the shelf, 
And you may depend from beginning to end, 
That the best friend of all is yourself. 
Don't get into, eta

SLAVERY BEFORE THE WAR. 
Written by W ILLIAM HARRIS, and enng by HARRIS and CARROI3b. 
On, don't take her from me and leave me alone, 
For dreary this poor old man's home it will be ; 
I'll have no one to cheer me as old age creeps on, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and take me along. 
You'll take her away where I'll ne'er see her more 
Perhaps she may die among strangers alone, 
With no one to cheer her deserted she'll be, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and leave her with me. 
CHORUS. 
God bless you, kind sir, for this good deed, 
You'll find that we'll try to do all that you need ; 
In heaven above you'll find your reward, 
For not separating these two loving hearts. 
Oh, let him go with we, I 
beg of you do ; 
We'll work for you daily, and pray for you too ; 
We'll try to repay you as well as we can, 
Oh, don't s.,parate me from this poor old man. 
Just think of your mother in days long gone by ; 
How she would have suffered if she had to die 
Away from your father without any home, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and take him along. 
God bless you, kind sir, etc. 
Sung by N ED BARRY, 
T HERE are times to be merry, and times to be sad, 
On this changeable earth of ours ; 
There's a 
share of the good and a 
share of the bad, 
In our journey through thorns and flowers. 
There are parts of the way that are blooming and 
There are parts that are stony ground, 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
CHORUS. 
As long as the world goes round, 
As long as the world goes round ; 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
Tho' our hearts may grow faint in the battle of life, 
'Tis a 
comfort at least to feel 
That the morrow may bring a 
new turn to the strife, 
In a 
turning of fortune's wheel. 
Tho' the sky be o'ercast, there is sunshine at last, 
Where the blackest of clouds are found ; 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, etc. 
Let us bow to the sorrows fate throws in our way, 
There is hope when its frowns are worst ; 
And enjoy the bright weather of life while we may, 
For to-morrow the storm will burst. 
Seize the best when you can, bear the worst like a 
man, 
'Tis a 
motto both safe and sound ; 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, etc.. 
Sung with great success by BILLY TENNYSON. 
I LIVED with me master not many years ago, 
Down on the Tom Peake Bay, 
And I 
feel so glad to see you negroes now, 
Kase the white folks set me free. 
I 
am hungry now, my feet am cold, 
Shivering when the cold wind blows, 
And I 
feel so glad when I 
get home, 
Down where the sugar cane grows. 
CHORUS. 
Den I'm gwine, den I'm gwine, 
Den I'm gwine away to stay, 
Never come away, 
Down where the sugar cane grows. 
Then I 
lived with me master not many years ago, 
Down on the Tom Peake Bay, 
And I 
feel so glad to see we darkeys now, 
Kase the white folks set me free, 
And 
stick to the hoe till the sun goes down, 
And rise when the rooster crows, 
And I'll spend my life with my dear old wife 
Down where the sugar cane grows. 
Den I

Den I 
am gwine to stay, 
I'll never come away 
Down where the sugar cane grows..

THE OLD PLANTATION 'S LONELY. 
Sung with great success by BILLY TEICNYSON. 
OH, the old plantation's lonely now to what it used to be, 
And the place is just as silent as the tomb, 
Where we used to hear the mocking bird a 
singing in the 
tree, 
In the lan,1 where the sweet magnolias bloom ; 
But no longer do you hear the darkeys singing in the cane 
As they used to do in happy days of yore ; 
For old master's gone and left us in this weary world of 
Pain, 
And he'll never hear the darkeys sing no more.

Oh, the old plantation's lonely now to what it used to be ; 
Still I 
can't forget the place where I 
was born; 
But before old master passed away lie set us darkeys free. 
And we work no more among tile growing corn. 
You can never hear the dinner horn a- blowing when ' tis 
noon, 
You will never hear old master's voice no more, 
You will never see us hunting for the possum and the coon

Tell me, are your tidings true ? 
My boy, oh say you are but jesting, 
With your sire you never knew.

To find instead of joyful greeting, 
That all on earth T 
loved is, gone.

Hush, boy, I

She beckons me to come; 
Listen to the angels calling,

Oh, father clear, your boy is near you, 
The prop of your old years; 
Let's pray to Him who gives glory, 
And reigns o'er this vale of tears.

THE TIME WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by HARMS' and CARROLL. 
DAR'S a 
pretty little spA down in Southern Tennessee, 
Whar de ivy blossoms twine around de door. 
And ever fresh and green in our memories it will be, 
Though we' know we'll.never see it any more. 
But we never can forget the old home we loved so well, 
And the many good old tunes that we have sung ; 
And the tears they fill our eyes every time we try to tell 
Of the times we used to have when we were young. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, de tam.bo and de bones are forever laid away, 
And de fiddle and de banjo am unstrung 
But we often heave a 
sigh for do happy days gone by, 
And de times we used to have when we were young, 
When de autumn days had come we would husk de yaller 
corn ; 
In de fields we were a-singing all de day, 
For before dey made us free we had never cause to mourn, 
And around the old place everything was gay. 
And many, many times, when de work of day was o'er, 
With our melody de old' plantation rung ; 
And our hearts do often:long for the happy days of yore, 
And times we used to have when we were young.

TRAVELLING BACK AGAIN.

Character Vocalist. 
Words and Music Original by Mums and CARROLL. 
I 
HAVE travelled far and near from the place that I 
love 
dear, 
Yet, to-day, while walking leisurely along, 
I 
was thinking of my home I 
left not long ago. 
That's why I_ sing for you my little song. 
It was down in old Kentucky I 
left when twenty-two, 
And, kind friends, the Darting gave me pain ; 
But I'll yet see my old wife—my children so young in life. 
That is why I 
am trying to travel back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll be welcomed with a 
smile as they gave me when but 
a 
child. 
I 
can see the place far o'er the rolling plain ; 
Yes, these voices will be clear when sounding on my ear. 
That's why, kind friends, I 
am travelling back again. 
What is that spot I 
see ? 
It fills my heart with glee. 
It's the old church which I 
used to love so dear, 
Where my little child would say, ' Oh, papa, come and 
pray." 
I 
tell you them's the days which gave me cheer. 
The little school-house too, the woods I've wandered 
through, 
Mv cottage that was painted neat and clean, 
That faithful old dog " Touse," which always was round 
my house • 
I 
will see them when I 
travel back again. 
I'll be welcomed, etc. 
I 
know soon I 
must die, yet it makes me almost cry, 
When I 
have to leave the people which I 
love; 
But we all must go some day—that's what the prophets 
say. 
If not here, I 
hope to meet all friends above. 
I 
fought for " Uncle Sam," to free my native land ; 
General Washington, he said the day we'd gain ; 
But now the fighting's o'er, and I

DARK COMPLECTED COON. 
Original by the late JANES BRADLEY. 
GOOD evening friends, I'll sing to you, 
A 
song and dance which is true, 
I 
loved a 
girl whose name was Lew, 
But now she's ran away. 
She could sing just like a 
bird. 
The sweetest voice you ever heard. 
Her lover too was so absurd. 
And you can always hear md say. 
I 
think I 
made a 
big mistake, 
By falling in love with Louisa Flake, 
She ran away, and gave me the shake, 
With a 
dark complected coon. 
Louisa's ma don't feel content 
For marrying that coon without her consent, 
When she heard the news in a 
fit she went,

I AM GETTING NEAR DE CABIN. 
Sketch, written by EDWARD Ati6TIN, for ilannm and Csaacni. 
I 
AM getting near de cabin 
Where dwells my darling wife ; 
Now I 
wonder how she's looking 
At dis yere stage ob life ? 
I hardly think she'll know me now 
My black hair am turned gray ; 
I've not forgot my lubly wife 
Though I'm so long away ; 
I 
recollect when I 
was young, 
And we worked side by side— 
'Twas ' way down 'mong de sugar canes— 
I took her for my bride. 
Now we've both grown old together, 
My dear ole wife an' I, 
I'm coming back whar I 
was born; 
'Ls (Tar I 
wish to die. 
CHORUS. 
Darling ' Melia, (roice outside) I 
hear you. 
Lubly ' Melia, (coke outside) I'm near you. 
I 
never was so happy in my life. 
Whar de birds of Southern birth 
Make joyful dis yere earth, 
I 
shortly ' spect to see my little wife. 
SPOKEN.—Yas ; 
dere's de same ole cabin. 
Dere's de 
place where I've passed so many happy hours wid 'Melia 
and de piccaiunies ; but dat yere's a 
tender subject. 
As I 
passed round by de old churchyard (Music—' Massa's in 
de Cold, Cold Ground") I 
saw an increase in de graves dar. 
I ' speet de children am all laid day to rest—bless dar souls ! 
But dar's one thing sure—'Melia am not dar, for I 
just 
heard her voice. I 
won't mention nuffin 'bout de children, 
for I 
know ' twill break her poor ole heart to tell de news. 
(Music ceases) I 
hope 'Melia won't blame de ole man for 
leaving her so sudden. 
I'll go to her full of penitence, 
an' I know she'll take me home to her heart. 
Oh, 'Melia knows dat I 
was forced 
One day to say " Good-bye ;" 
A•dark cloud hovered o'er our heads, 
But now ' tis all pass'd by.

I AM GETTING NEAR DE CABIN.—continued. 
I 
might have staid, an' yet been sold, 
An' from my 'Melia part, 
An' den I 
wandered fai away, 
It almost broke my heart. 
But massa, he am reconciled, 
An' I 
can now come home 
To meet my dear old wife again, 
An' claim her as my own. 
Our children now are gone to rest— 
Dere graves wet wid her tears; 
But 'Melia now am left me, sure, 
In my declining years.

TROUBL11S OF A SONG AND DANCE MAN. 
Sung by MANCHESTER and JENNINGb. 
No longer talk about your men 
Of funny song and dance ; 
For we can lay way over them all, 
If you'll give us a 
chance. 
There's dancing in our heels and toes 
And music in our chins. 
You can bet we are thoroughbreds, 
Although we're thick and thin. 
CHORUS. 
My name is Singing Citis, 
(Sum.) 
While mine is Dancing Jim, 
(
Sym.) 
You bet we are two thoroughbreds, 
Although we're thick and thin. 
if any one that's here to night 
Would like a photograph of us, 
Just call on Dancing Jimmy here, 
Or else to Singing Gus, 
Some say that we both look alike, 
And some say we are twins ; 
You bet we are two thoroughbreds, 
Although we're thick and thin. 
My name is singiug Gus, oto.

THE BEAUTE. 
Originally sung by the " Irish Emperors," Favon and SHIELDS. 
YOUR attention now we ask for a 
couple of years, 
To a 
story we will relate, 
It's about a 
purty Irish girl we met while we was walking, 
She was hanging on a 
slaughter-house gate. 
She was as pnrty and as sweet as a 
cow, 
Such clothes you never did see ; 
She had a 
darling little bonnet with a 
poodle dog upon it. 
She's the Irish girl that winked at me. 
CHORts. 
Oh, my, wasn't she a 
beante, 
Tra In le, skip the gutter, the baby's got a 
tooth ; 
Wrestling pots, that was her duty, 
And her sister was a 
boarding-house cook. 
My name i Patsey Marley, and the daisies call me 
Cl 
FM a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick ; 
My name is Patsey Marley. and the daisies call me 
Charley, 
I'm a 
double-breasted acrobatic Mick. 
The other day we thought we'd take a 
little walk, 
For to try and see the daisy; 
While walking dowr. the street, by chance we her did 
meet, 
With a 
man about six foot eight. 
Says I, ‘. Excuse me, my dear, 
But isn't your name Arabella ? " 
She hit me such it poke that my neck she nearly broke, 
And she knocked me head and heels in a 
cellar. 
Oh, my, 
she, etc.

THE old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil ; 
I 
never drearn'd %would come to this, or that I'd be in 
need, 
After years of service in Carlilfit 
My limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white 
as snow, 
Anil I 
cannot see the gentle slimmer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by.

rhe old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to

And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no me', he's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old ; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor arms of mine 
would seem, 
if tne poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to-morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkeys shoat and sing ; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring ; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound, 
Then I'll have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I 
shall know no mo' about this wordly care. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
THE BANJO NIAV HA ::: G-3 SILENT ON THE 
DOOR . 
Written and composed by JERRY D. 
McCann:tr. 
Sung with great success by Diric. LITTLE 
CALLENDER'S Georgia Min-
bt rel. 
OH, the old home is sad now and dreary, 
The darkeys sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, it's all that reThains of the children, 
Of the ones that have cherished me so dear, 
And no more will I 
hear their voices singing 
The good old songs my heart rejoiced to hear. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old home is sad now and dreary, 
(Bass alone) Sad and dreary, for 
Tli dark y. sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
(Bass alone) And the oanjo, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, but time makes me fondly remember, 
At evening when the toiling day was done. 
How the folks used to sing and play the banjo, 
For trouble in those good times we had none 
But their forms in the grave now lie sleeping, 
So dear to me in happy days of yore, 
And I'm left here alone all day weeping, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, the old home, etc. 
Now old age has come on, and I'm weary, 
The few locks that are left me are quite gray ; 
Round the farm ev'ry day I'm wandering, 
Yes, wandering, for I 
soon must pass away. 
So you'll please listen now and remember, 
When the poor colored man shall be no more, 
Take good care, kind friends, and part with never 
The banjo hanging on the cabin door. 
Oh, the old home, etc. 
CLOVER. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by HALEY and W EST. 
HAPPY is my lot, for in yonder little cot 
Dwells a 
darling, charming little maiden, 
She's an angel from above, my little turtle dove, 
And with love for her my heart is heavy-laden. 
The last time that I 
saw my love, 
She promised me to wed, 
Oh, she's so sweet, and so complete, 
She's turned this darkey's head. 
CHORUS. 
When this girl does marry me, 
Sorrow will be over, 
Then we will so happy be, 
And this little nig will always live in clover. 
This maiden whom I 
love all other girls above, 
Is the sweetest little girl in all creation, 
With a 
rosy face so fair, and wavy golden hair, 
She possesses every art of fascination. 
She loves no one but me, and mine some day she'll be, 
I'll be happy when the wedding day is o'er. 
Then when I 
can call her wife, we shall lead a 
merry life, 
In joy and bliss, ecstatic evermore. 
When thii girl does marry me, etc. 
DARKEY'S HOLIDAY. 
Sung by IlAnnis and CARROLL. 
HE. 
LOVE the Southern clime, where this darkoy was born, 
I 
love the dear old time, each was a 
happy morn ; 
With joy we worked all day, at eve we joined the dance ; 
Each dusky belle, so beautiful, could kill me with a 
glance. 
I 
tuned my old banjo, and struck the tambourine ; 
We sung the old time music as we capm.id round the 
green. 
The good mosso would join, our fun would never rest ; 
Those days will never be forgot, within this darkey's 
breast. 
CHORTIS.—BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green ; 
Joyful darkeys we, when dancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine ; 
That's the full I 
loved, dancing on the green. 
SHE. 
They say this nigger's free ; yes, free to want and pain, 
I 
would much rather see those good old times again, 
When through the cotton field I 
wandered with old Joe ; 
But those good times will ne'or come back, those days of 
long ago. 
It makes my old man smile, he thinks of those sweet 
hours, 
When me with love tales he'd beguile, amidst those sunny 
bowen; 
But cheer up, dear old man, through life we've done our 
best, 
We'll pass out like the sunlight, when it dies in the west. 
CHORUS. —BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green; 
Joyful darkeys we, when dancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine ; 
That's the fun we loved, dancing on the green.
