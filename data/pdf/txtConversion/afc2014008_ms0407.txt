sa w Mr. Manning,
 
The Folic Arts panel reviewed bath of your
 fil m Ot its resent m eting and
 
asked so to convey saveral suggeesti ms:
 
1)  They feel that the credits sk ald point out that this _
 is not
 
so such a Xebawk or other strictly tribal ,
 enterPrioa as a d
e
wsstrstion by
 
the Ake w
ssasua and American Indian TrsvoLli f
t Cs11
W.

)  They also wish that you  could is,Omm Way indicate that the
 
tipia in the backgro ed are not tr0ditional to the Iroquois, and that
 
saes of the da mes heave been adapted from other non--Iroquois Indian groups
:.
 
This could be 3
haddled t
hro
e
s narration, or through a
re aecoupanying brochure
 
(Point 1 could be heandled either o
ral► " well)
 
3
)  They wondered if the dances at* " could not be resbeptusing
 
traditional leg and f
a
got-covert ts or evens s leotard or stocking.  They
 
felt so conscious of the skin-blenishe!s (
undoubtedly caused by the ferocity
 
of Canadian mosquitoes -- I really sympathize) that they couldn't concen-
trate an the dance steps.
 
Please understand that the above suggestio n are, strictly speaking, none
 
of our business.  It's your film, not our*.  But I do believe: tbat the
 
panel fools so s
tr* Wy about their reeopmendations that they would authorize
 
supra than they grant aMadssnt "a regdtsto
id if they could be accomplished.
 
?
Tees decision is entirely or to you and Will not i
s *& W wlay affect the
 
Poegi >
•'s handling of y
e w request of 11/29/79.  1 just thought I ought
 
to send their recom madations along to you before we f
ret too tar embroiled
 
in the papserreork.

Dear Mr. 7
_
.ippert
 
Jade Sapp, who is directing the Mississippi Folk Arts Project
 
sponsored by your organization and Miles College, has re-
quested technical assistance from the Folk Arts Program.
 Folk
 
Arts has a special fund for providing such funding and we are
 
arranging to sand three specialists to Eutaw for brief visits
 
to consult with Mrs. Sapp on her varied program.  We just
 
wanted to let you know about the above mentioned action and
 
hope you'll approve.  We are happy to hear from Jane that
 
the project is coming along well.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Puut,
 
The k you for your pleasant letter.  :
since our hasty conversation, we have
 
bo w plagued with staff shortages, flu begs and similar disasters; the
 
Folk Arts pe Mi has held a 3-day meetings
e
ting
 
s 
we've sfaultanseusly beta
 
coping with e
re aWlicatioe d
e "Itu 4  lbo upshot:  an extremely tardy reply
 
to yours of Novoober 29.  Please s
e
ct my 4 W*piss.
 
I hope that you by now are avare that RO
W Abra
de, Folk Arts panel
 
chairman until just recently, i
s mm r
esident i
n the Lou Angeles area.
 
Though I ca r
rot say that any of our staff will be in California until some
 
later date is the spring (March or April), Roger is available for consul-
tation right moor, and be v m1d, -
Z,4* sure, be happy to meet with you.  You
 
eon reach its at S
erl os College, Clarevaat (
71,)621-2766.
 
I think your idea of a "Folk Arts finder" within the 1
0micipal Arts Department
 
in Lao Angeles is a terribly exciting one.  Perhaps we could pursue the
 
subject further by phone (
202)634-4282.  Please don't forget x
is.  I
'll
 
enclose a copy of our guidelines by way of reminder.

Subject;  Attached application
 
At its meeting December 8-14, the Peak Arta panel reco m
mended the funding
 
of the attached application frc  the Alabama Council on the Arts and
 
Humanities.  The grant will appear in the February Council pages with
 
the following description:
 
Support for a aeries of six tee-dity "Christian Harmony"
 
Singing Schools to be held in six counties in Alabama.
 
The so-called Christian Harmony.aang book is one of _
a
 
series of methods for teaching a
 -sin
s (
solfeggio)
 
used throughout small southern ,
g
itiap for the past
 
200 years.  This is an attempt to repspuLtrise the
 
singing school custom, now fallen into disuse and
 
f
amiliar to only a relatively small number of old-timers.
 
This is a defensibly artistic as opposed to religious project, but Z
 
wanted you to have the i
nformation before anybody objected[

NOWMANDUM
 
December 17, 1979
 
To:  Mary Ann Tighe

Subject:  Storm warning
 
At its meeting of December 6-8. the Folk Arts panel rejected an application
 
from Boricua College for the Puerto Rican Arts and Cultural Center's a
nnual
 
trullas project.  That t
atullss
. 4ust
ocm is a Puerto Rican variety of wassailing;
 
bands and singers go from b
o om _
 to house serenading and imprevisi f
t .
eon$ks
 
about the Nativity and other Seasonal matters.  The Christmas festivity is
 
Puerto Rico lasts from Christmas to Three King* Day (
January 6
).
 
Roricus
, College (
read: An& Marta Morales) has applied to us three years in
 
succession to bring trollas experts to I
NA w York P.R.
, groups.  Each year she
 
has delayed applying until our October 1 deadline; applications at this
 
deadline are reviewed by our December panel.  Since there is no way a
 
Decesh*r panel can get money out in t
ime_tot a Christmas event, we have
 
actually been
, f
ending; her after the .
fact.  This year, the panel simply
 
refused to do it for the third t
ime. and I completely co
ns with this
 
decision.  Des Sheehy and I both personally reminded, re-reminded, warned,
 
threatened, and pleaded with Ana Marta to gat that application in o
n time.
 
She just did not d
es it.  The clincher, from Folk Arts' point of view, is
 
that she h
 e
rself,wrote In her final report ,
o
c
 n our 1973 tr 4 A
Js grant that
 
the project had turned out poorly b
ecause the federal m o
m
'! Ud come through
 
so late that proper planning was impossible.
 
I an writing this memo because 1
,axpect to be on vacation with s
ay grandchildren
 
from December 20-3©, and A
n & Hart* my very well decide to appeal to you.
 
My s
ternest r
+
rxcr
nnx►sm "tion would be to urge her to start working on her 1980
 
trallas application right now and heave this Christmas out.

Dear Mr. Thompson,
 
1
11ank you for your proposal.  I shall enclose the Yolk Arts guideliues for
 
your use in case you decide to apply .
for funding to our Program.  Our 1930
 
deadlines are January 1
, April 1 and October 1 for projects scheduled to
 
start about six months after the application date.
 
I must tell you ,
 however, that the Folk Arts advisory panel has recom mended
 
only limited funding to a few particularly significant pow-vOws in the
 
past.  This is because the pow w
ow► mD
'rMOGUt,  3n many sections of the country,
 
is pretty self-
-suf.ficieut ,
 while there are many other Native American
 
cultural projects that could not possibly occur without outside funding.
 
If you decide to APPlY to us. there, I would recommend that you indicate
 
just u y you would t
reed federal help to run your project and especially
 
a
shy your proposed budget is so extremely costly.
 
i
re would also need to know ghat drums , singers, and dancers 7 o intend to
 
invite , or at least from which tribes . We would also need to have additional
 
background on your own organization, the numbers of American Indiana in
 
Henn Moines that you service , and their tribal affiliations . `
moor unny people
 
do you think might attend the pow-sow. and what proportion misht be Indian?
 
Row long could activities p
ro on each day?  Would admission be charged?  I am
 
sorry to ask so m
e
at y questions ,
 but the Folk.
 Arts Program has very limited
 
funds, and our advisory panel examines all projects, therefore ,
 with great care.
 
Our panel also scrutinizes budgets with particular thoroughness . Let me
 
make a few suggestions regarding yours.
 In the first place, we cannot provide
 
prlze
 monies . I also don't understand the proposed item for
. food.  If
 
your invited.
 participants are getting $100 a day (which is extremely high in
 
terms of other pow-wow budgets I have B
een) do they require food to be
 
furnished as well ? Two thousand dollars sums also a very high figure for
 
space rental.  Iverall , I would recommend that you scale your f
inancial
 
estimate down considerably and try to think of some more economical *
.
rays
 
of proceeding.
 
I dope the foregoing observations are helpful.  Please remember they are only
 
staff recommendations.  The final 4ecision Ifas with our advisory panel.
 
S
hould y
ou Anme avy other questions or need additional Information . please
 
feel free to write agaia or to telephone me person-to--person collect at
 
- 2 -
 
202-634-4282

to you.

Dear N e
d;
 
I am sorry to have taken so interminably long over your
 
Navajo run Proposal.  Truly, we usually work more swiftly.
 
Let me tell you what we've done.
 I've gone over your pro-
posal with Folk Arts staff, with the Crafts people in our
 
Visual Arts Program, and with our Museum Program as well.
 
This has :
been time-consuming, and.  I
'm afraid, not especially
 
productive.
 Each answer boiled down to the fact that you'd
 
have to restructure the proposal considerably in order to be
 
competitive within the various guidelines.
 
From the perspective of the Folk Arts Program, the part that
 
would seen to fit our guidelines is the documentation phase,
 
and that's already in process.  By the time that we could
 
physically get you any money, most of that would already be
 
over.
 The other problem is that the way its written up here,
 
the project is really research-oriented.  We do support
 
research, but generally as ancillary to a performance or the
 
doing of something.
 If the whole project were less expensive,
 
the research aspect a
right not loom so large; for this total
 
am
mnt of money, however, I think the Folk Arts panel might
 
feel that too much was going into research to fit our guide-
lines.
 (
What they really mould like to fund is the salary
 
for the weaver and the weaving expenses, for example.)
 
Both Crafts and Museums in one way or another said that the
 
focus on the single crafts worker and the single product
 
disturbed them.  Again, they felt it was a large amount of
 
money to be focussed on one weaver and one rug.  Both of them
 
thought that a larder, comparative exhibit might stand a
 
better chance in their exhibition categories.
 
2
 
I shall include Sally's hand-written notes, representing the
 
point of view of the Special Programs Office at the National
 
Endowment for the Humanities.  Essentially, she seems to be
 
saying that ,
you need to focus on the interpretive/explanatory
 
aspects of the exhibit in order to qualify for NEH support.
 
She also thinks you should address the issue of why this
 
would ue a humanities project anyway and how humanists would
 
be involved.
 
I am sorry to have labored so long and to have come up with
 
so little.
 I shall enclose a set of Folk arts guidelines for
 
your consideration in case you decide to apply to us anyway.
 
Note that our grants only run one year.  out next des dline is
 
January 1 (
read: first two weeks of January)  for projects
 
scheduled to start in approximately six months.
 
cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Rawes

Dear Professor Tiredo,
 
This is just a note to thank you for allowing we the opportunity to see
 
your film, the Life of Christ.  Dan Sheehy and Bob Teske looked at it while
 
I was away for a brief vacation. and recommended it in t
tse most enthusiastic
 
terms when I returned.
 
I have j
ust finished screening it and want to tell you that I was deeply = mod.
 
You welly are to be congratulated; it is a most imaginative conception,
 
carried through superbly.  I have rarely seen a film on traditiosnal arts
 
that had such impact on both eye and ear.
 
Please keep in touch with us, either directly, or through our mutual friend
 
Elena, and I hope that in future we can he working together.
 
Yours very sincerely,

Subject:  Travel allowance, 1980
 
Polk Arts is feellug a bit abuded over its travel allocation for 10"0.
 
In 1979, vs had only $9,O M with which, by pract f
tlnp the moat stringent
 
economies, making several stops on each foray, and c
lutching every dime.
 
we mnReed 18 trips, three quite extenAed.  Since air fares '
have already
 
!
zone up 407 since the beginning of the 1979 fiscal year, with another major
 
Increase predicted for
. January 199p. we feel that our current 1988 Allocation
 
of $12,500 is j
tast holding the line -- no real Increase at all.
 
I must point out, too, that we were eatre"el
.y noble in 1979: we neither
 
griped at our sm
ell figure nor did we overspend.  In fact, d
aze to the
 
economies mentioned abowe, we actually spent only $9,1 V of our S9,f"nn.
 
We really squeezed that
 pan made several trips to New York in which,
 
by virtue of staying with friends and carrying a lunch, for all Y tnow,
 
he only charred the Fndnwwent for plane fare and aub-ray.
 
in 1980, ve'4 tike to live it up a little.  ror one thing, we'4 1ik
.e to
 
have an out of town panel meeting. Vn ch we figure would cost us $
3,noo.
 
We will simply have to forego that with our current budget.  r
o hov about
 
reconaidering our original r"uest for $19,000?  We will t
ine it w sel

Please accept the Program's thanks for your f
ine editing of our essay.
 
Vs do have a f
ew ave
 n%ento I would appreciate your incorporating (
an
al
 
do edit those, if need be).
 
On pane 3
:  The film Always for Pleasure has raised a certain mmount of
 
local argumentation (
Inevitable in such projects) in rev  Orleans.  It
 
right he s
tore tactful to substitute an equally f
ine fills that Folk: Arts
 
has supported:  The Popovich Brothers of South Chicago: the latter would
 
a
lso have the advantage of mentioning European ethnic support, a bit
 
c
inder-represented in the other examples given.
 
That sentence would then read:
 
.
..on black
- tap dancers, or the rop vi
.ch frothers of South Chicago,
 
on a serbian-
 p eri.
can musical family.
 
to page 4
, s
ay ever-alert staff points out that, on line e
, we did not
 
actually fund t
he radio station, we funded a local Chicano group that hack
 
mWe arrangements with the radio station for the broadcast series.  This
 
sentence should then read:
 
.
..to encourage Yexi
.can-�Arertcan traditional song-compositional s
tyle
 
by means of support to a series of radio arorrame broadcasting traditional
 
conterporary California corxidos (
narrative songs about actual events) .
 
Also or
, pane 4
, in the next sentence could the rbrase "black flues pickers'
 
be inserted i
n the list of types of people we support.  t
ie have only one
 
other example of our nro7rnn '
:s
 support for black traditional culture, and
 
It seers a little scanty.

Dear Dr. Civon
 
Thank you for your letter.
 I am enclosing a copy of the Folk
 
Arts informational brochure
s as well a s  a copy of our quide-
lines that contain the neces sary forms for applying to the
 
program.  The brochure is Just  easier to read and a more
 
irvitinn format.
 
You will notice that W  will need quite a hit core detail on
 
j
erst how this project is being carried out and what hoped for
 
results will he obtained.  We generally feel that out-and-out
 
research projects fall within the reavensibility of the 
"ationa
s
sl Endowment for the Fumanities.  We are interested in
 
research that is incidentasltto another project.
 Zn your case,
 
we would need to know what you ant
i/or the tribe will do with
 
the stories and songs that you collect.  Will they simply "o
 
into an archive; If so, will the tribe have access to that
 
archive; will there be any distribution of the r
agterials via
 
small publications, rocordings, radio Programs a suitable
 
public performances or the like?
 
I think if yon read through the brochure quickly, our poAnt of
 
viers will become? clear.  We are interested in preservin, and
 
vaiidaatinn living cultural variety; obviously, archiving would
 
be a part of a goo,l project, but not just archiving.
 
There are a
s few other technical details.  We will need along
 
with your eventual application the vitas of p
e�c,ple involved Y 
in the project, some indication of tribal surport (which may
 
or may not comes from the official tribal council), informa-
tion on where the materi a
ls collected
 w il
l  he t
aut  l
and where
 
a protection copy w ill be put  also),
 and, finally, some
 
indication of the availability of r
ratchinq funds.
 In F&gk
 
Arts we more or less assume that there is little hard cash
 
available, but some always helps,, W
 then there are nary
 
soft matc h: Possibilities -- donations of spaces, equipment
 
rental
., tire, and the like.

DATE:  November 19,  1979
 
RE:
 Memo of Record
 
U 
On November 2 a meeting was held to discuss the issues raised
 
in Folk Arts'  memo of September 26 on non-European music and
 
dance forms.
 In attendance were Mary Ann Tighe,  Ezra Laderman,
 
Aida Chapman,  Esther Novak,  Jim Ireland,  Kathleen Bannon,  Bess
 
Hawes,  and Dan Sheehy.
 
The discussion disclosed that several Programs,  including Folk
 
Arts, Music,  Dance,  and Opera/Musical Theater had been funding
 
occasional groups and individuals in this area but in a
 
sporadic manner.
 In general,  the discussants seemed to feel
 
that the issue deserved further in-house study before
 
an overall Endowment funding policy that would treat applicants
 
evenhandedly and would eliminate some of the "gaps"  in the
 
guidelines would be developed.
 
The group recommended that the next step be to hold a larger
'
-
presentation/discussion meeting to involve key Endowment
 
personnel -- appropriate Program Directors and/or other staff
 
as well as panel representatives -- along with invited members
 
of the "world music and dance" constituency.
 The purpose of
 
the proposed conference will be to introduce the world of
 
world music within the United States to those present and to
 
discuss strategies for its appropriate funding by Endowment
 
programs.
 
2
 
Dan Sheehy accepted the responsibility of planning and organizing
 
the meeting for the coming spring, aided by a working committee
 
including Rhoda Grauer, Aida Chapman and Kathleen Bannon.
 A
 
meeting of this committee will be held after the Folk Arts
 
panel meeting  (
December 6-8)  and before Christmas.

Dear *

Thank
, you for your Invitation to attend the One Rundredth Anniversary
 
celebration of the Arebapoloeical
. Tnetitute of America.
 
Unfortunately, T don't think it would be very arnrorriate for i
re to attend,
 
as the Falk Arts rrosraawr specifically limits i
ts funding to livirp traditional
 
arts.  I have ventured to forward your invitation to our `
+useums Program
 
with the thought that a representative frog+ there
 be able to attend,
 
though they also have limits.  Specifically, their funding toes to erts-
centered exhibitions a
nd projects.
 
T assure that you have invited representatives from the latlona
rl Endo w "
 t
 
for they Hwmar
.ities.  Tf I understand they conplex structure of federal
 
furdinp a
ctencies accurately, I think the discipline of a
archaeroloay would
 
s
tet more assistance more easily from Rum

I
t seems to me
, that your i

tea falls well within our guidelines.  nowsever,
 
I would advise you to refine and focus i
t more sharply before you send in
 
an application.  As you are probably aware, t
l
+ere has been a great deal of
 
work done to record small congregation relip.:
ious music throughout the 1
31ack
 
South, including a good deal of Georgia,  I only yesterday received an alhur
 
of Black religlotss s
InSine recorded a year avo in southeast Georgia by a

I don't mean to imply that t
he whole lob has been done- (
the whole lob, in
 
this field, is never dore).  But I do think that you s
hould
d look aroiinki very
 
carefully, before you co mIt to a project. to determine l
ust what the major
 
needs are.  You probably should be in touch with some of the people who
 
have worked with black religious music in the deep south.  One scholar
 
currently available to you is Bennis Coelho, t

whether in black c

Dear Charley,
 
Thank you for your Interesting report.  Z stall enclose It witb the hack-up
 
information on your new grant application.
 
Barbara hasn't yet sent in her report
., but I will certainly send yom a
. copy
 
when it comes.  We chatted about it a bit in Loss Angeles at the AF9 meeting'
 
her description v
ans generally favorable, and she didn't mention Fosse Maddox
 
or Kenny doll at all.  The strongest feeling she had was that you needed to
 
get more field work d
ome and you needed better (
and paid) {
presenters.  t
roth of
 
these concerns could he taken care of by her s
surgestion of providing coffee-
and-cakes money for field wort: -
-- say at $100 a month) for some reseaarcheas
 
who then should he  paid full salaries when actually doing presentation at
 
the festivals.  I thought this was ar interesting i
deas and one that I intend
 
to suggest to other festival producers.  Most field work Ir Pat full time
 
anyway; what you really need is expense money for g
ees and the ability to nick
 
up the supper check or bring the beer or something.
 
Ph received two :
n
ice letters from nice people who enjoyed the festival
 
I
'll enclose xerexes for your files.
 
All the best.  Sorry I couldn't join you this past week.

I am sorry it has taken ns so long to respond to your letter.
 
We have had some staff changes in the role Arts Program that
 
have gotten us very far behind with our normal  conduct of
 
business.
 
We have taken care of your rervuest to have the grant period
 
extendee? until December 30th.
 The necessary forms have been
 
submitted to our t
yrants Office,  and you will hear from them
 
directly in due course.
 In the meantime, you sh ould simply
 
assure that the extension has been a
jpprovea .
 
Changing the project director, however,  is a far more tire-
consuming matter and one which will necessitate panel approvel.
 
since Dr. Basaoz'  name was written into the original e
rrant
 
reviewee b
 y t
he Folk Arts Panel.
 The panel will not meet until
 
December, by which time your grant period will be practically
 
over.
 
I wonder if s
kjme Accomr_0eation could not be reached between
 
your Board and Dr. Basaoz,  allowing p
Ir.  32at to take over certain
 
functions on an informal basis?
 '
.
'
then if you should decide to
 
reapply for another year,  the project could be worked out in
 
any manner desirable to the Turkish American Cult ural Alliance
 
as a group.
 
There is one further rossibility that I can see.
 We could poll

PROPOSED DRAFT FOR LEAFLET
  
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS
 
The FOLK ARTS PROGRAM announces an APPRENTICESHIP CATEGORY
 
Apprenticeships are cash awards to qualified and experienced
 
persons who wish to commit to a period of serious study with a
 
senior master traditional artisan  (
craftsworker), musician,
 
dancer,  story-teller, or singer.
 These awards are intended to
 
support the fees for the master teacher as well as essential
 
expenses that may be required by the apprentice  (
such as materials,
 
local travel, maintenance, and the like).
 They do not,  except
 
under the most remarkable circumstances,  include apprentice
 
salaries.
 Our primary purpose is to get funds to senior tradi-
tional artists and to encourage them to pass on the fruits of
 
their wisdom and skill to younger people.
 
Since the overall goal of the Folk Arts Program is to
 
help keep local traditional arts alive,  special preference will
 
be shown to qualified young artists who wish to study within
 
their own tradition -- for example, Native American craftsworkers
 
who wish to learn from an elder within their own tribe.
 Outside
-
.
 
learners, however,  should not automatically consider themselves
 
disqualified.
 Give us a try.

Amounts requested. 
Within the overall Arts Endowment limitation
 
of one-year grants,  estimate realistically the time and the
 
expenses required.
 A fiddler can likely tape-record enough
 
fiddle tunes in a month of intensive study to take his life-time
 
i

t
 
,
!S
 
to master; a weaver may require considerably more time to absorb
 
the intricacies  being demonstrated.
 Most of our musical appren-
ticeship grants, therefore, have been in the neighborhood of
 
$1,000 or $1,500; crafts apprenticeships have ranged as high as
 
$7,000.
 Be reasonable; be fair.
 We shall try to do the same.
 
How to apply. 
Send a letter saying what you would like to do
 
to the FOLK ARTS PROGRAM, National Endowment for the Arts,
 
2401 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506; we will send you
 
an application form in return.  When you have filled it in and
 
sent it back to us, you should include:
 
evidence of your skill  (
or potential skill)  in the art
 
form (
tapes or slides or photos, as appropriate)
 
some indication that the traditional artist is
 
interested in having you as a student  (
ideally,
 
a letter from the master artist agreeing to the
 
terms of the apprenticeship),
 
a budget, showing that most of the grant money will
 
go towards fees for the master teacher and towards
 
your own supplies, travel and similar expenses,

an estimate of the time required to lean the necessary
 
skills.

Dear Jeff
 
Here is all the information we have on the Shoaelwater affair
 
including a copy of this r

seers to be the arants officer for the tribe.  You should be
 
sure, when you get in touch, to reet with the Peritage Committee
 
and the fellow who is now listed as the project director, Mr
..
 
Syall.
 
Ms. Birch seems a
s sensible lady ane is much relieved that you
 
are coming over-  in fact, delighted.
 the tells r
a
ge, by the
 
way, that McClurg Vivian (who diet deckle to r€-verse her n
a me
 
from Vivian McClurg while she was working for the Shoaalwaters -
--
they don't have any idea why)  is n
ow i

brushed the sand of the Washington beaches fron her shoes
 
forever.
 They are extrer
.►ely annoyed with her;  a
3pFarently she
 
left them in a
s terrific mess.
 
Jeff, I think you should just try to aet these people out of
 
this particular grant situation in as r
?ianified a manner as
 
possible; they are being honest and open and S think should be
 
encouracee in that attitude.
 :
Maybe there would be some way
 to
 
spend the remaining $410 on linquistically relater pr ojects,
 
I think that would make then. feel better

responded with especial

 You might also talk with their about future "heritage"
 
proiaects f  I do wonder, though, if they have ouch herttaae left

 There don't seerm to be very many of
 
them left.

Re:

 for Policy and Grants Panel
 
The attached are our nominations for Folk ?
arts panelists in 1980.
 
Because of the relatively small number of applications reviewee
 
annually, the: need for rapid response to our varied constituency,
 
and the evolving character of our young program, we continue to
 
recorrend a combined policy and grants panel, reetina as a cor
.-
mittee of the whole four  times a year.
 One meetina (August)
 
will concern .
itself basically with policy eebate,  reviewing only
 
a minimur, number of emergency applications.
 
There are some slight imbalances noticeable in the panel list
 
as proposed.
 T
ie

, the r
aid--South and three
 
from t
1le Mir
?-Atlantic; however, we should he able to correct
 
the omission by use of consultants as needed, and the three
 
Mid--,Atlantic panelists are extrersely strong.
 The percentage
 
of women and minorities has risen from 259  in 1
.979 to 33* in
 
1980;  the number of non-academic panelists from one in 1979 to
 
two in 19ep.
 £ventua ny, we believe that 20% or 25% non-academics
 
would be about right.
 It is difficult to locate non--scholars
 
willing to review and make judgments in this broae field-  in
 
the i
r
?eantime, all the academics recommended have strong affilia--
tions with, and experience in,  the public sector.

hank you for your letter of Septer

The yolk Arts Program is anxious to be of assistance to the
 
Passamaquoddy Tribe, ane we feel that the intent of your project
 
to reestablish the traditional Passamacgttodey canoe is an ex-
cellent idea.
 
There are, however, a few di f
ficulties with the project as
 
outlined.
 We do not see any evidence of matching fiscal or
 
in-kind support frcvn the tribe, and even the participation
 
of tribal menbers appears to be limited in the description
 
sent. in.
 An yo;i will see in the Folk arts guidelines that I
 
enclose, we are concerned with the transmission of traditional
 
skills from senior craftsmen and artists, and z an sure our
 
advisory panel would look carPf
_ully at this particular aspect
 
of your project.
 
Another consideration is that we require evidence that docu-
mentation projects, most especially films, should be accomplished
 
with the highest degree of professionalism, so that the resulting
 
product could be worthy of the Great Passamaquoddy traditional
 
boat-building art.
 I wonder if f
 il-inc, the construction of the
 
canoe is indeed the best way of recordi
.nR the project or if, in
 
fact, docunentat:ion is absolutely needed?  (
It's always expensive.)
 
I understand frotr
. Sandy Ices, Director of the Archives of
 
Folklore and Oral f
cistory at the University of !wine in Orono
 
that a gentleman named Y. Tappan Addy did a most careful docu-
mentation of rassamaquoddy boat building through detailed
 
drawinas some time early in the century.
 I a
r= sure that if you
 
got in touch-:
 with Professor zves, he would be happy to let you
 
know where to ae't ho
-le of Mr. Addy's work.
 (Sandy Ives is a
 
member of the Folk Arts advisory panel and would, I am sure, be
 
happy to discuss the details of your project with you further.)
 
If either Mr. Lewis or Mr. Bassett wish to act in touch with
 
the Folk Arts office to discuss some of the issues rained in
 
this letter, please feel free to call me or r

near Lou,
 
Thank you !
`or your letter.
 I
'r
rm sorry to hear about the attitude
 
of the San Diego State a6rinistration.
 
It seems to r
ye a few misunderstandings have developed.  t
roth
 
the Falk Arts panel are the old r
olk music panel have taken
 
the position t
hat they do not want to fund the sane event
 
indefinitely.  Our constituency is just tor
s large and our
 
funds too small.  The rule has been flexible
 twn, three, or
 
in special cases, four years or so.
 I am sure *
lob Cordon must
 
have told you that when your applications came under the
 
Music Program.
 
The money that you say is now going to San rrancisco is coi
.ng
 
for exactly the purpose for which you were funded -- to help
 
support local fieldwork, so that eventually the Golden Gate
 
festival can better represent the r
rul
.ti-ethnic comnnnity in
 
which the festival takes place.  we are now supporting them
 
for the second year, and I have z
alreaey talker' with then
 
about tryirc to eevelop more local fiscal support so that we
 
can gradually how out of the picture.
 
Your Blues Festival, however, is a new event (
at 3east it is
 
news to me) , and I don't see why you shouldn't apply for ?
yelp
 
from the folk Arts Program should you plan to do it again next
 
fall.
 I thought the program looker'
, quite interesting.
 I
'll
 
enclose a copy of our new guidelines for your use; our next
 
deadline is January 1 for projects scheduled to start during
 
the summertir+e.
 you might want to try to make that deadlines
 
so as to allow you a f

ear Annette,
 
You really do seem to he having hare luck with your projects
 
this year.
 It's too bac! about T
•
7alter's deserting you.  However,
 
I cannot conceive that the Folk Arts panel would do anything
 
other than enthusiastically endorse your choice of Richard
 
March to finish of=
t the project.  ro just ro ahead.
 
Please dive Richard i
ry best and tell hire if he would like
 
to update his vita
., fine; otherwise, we will just go with the
 
one we already l
i ve.  And please c
;ive him r
ty hest regards.
 
I hope your r
ather projects are proaressina well.
 Let's keep
 
in touch.
 I may be coming out to Cincinnati for the American
 
Anthropological Association meeting the end of November, but
 
I am afraid I s
will be too rushed to c
Tet to Clevela
_ne at that
 
particular time.  Maybe we'll just have to meet in Los Angeles!

Dear mr. Taylor:
 
I understand from the O.C. Department of Corrections that your
 
organization may be willing to act as fiscal agent and spon-
sor for a project that the Folk Arts Program at the National
 
Endowment for the Arts would like to fund.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the grant as recently approved by
 
our advisory paned.  The history of this project is as
 
follows.  The Program was approachmd in 1978 by Charles
 
Sayles, an exceptionally fine blues harmonica player, who was
 
interested in teaching his art form in the I.C. prison
 
system.  At the time, we had an individual pilot project
 
category, by which we could give grants to individual artists;
 
having received approval from the U.C. Board of Corrections,
 
the panel enthusiastically supported Mr. Sayles' proposal.
 
Since that time, we have changed our guidelines and now require
 
organizational sponsorship for all our projects except
 
individual apprenticeships.  At first, the D.C. Department of
 
Corrections, which shares our enthusiasm for A
ir. Sayles' work,
 
felt that they could sponsor the grant directly, and sent in
 
the application enclosed.  Since that time, however, they
 
have been advised that they should not takes the role of
 
sponsor, and so we are turning to you.
 
I hope you will find the project worthwhile, and that we can
 
work together with your organization to further this useful
 
and constructive activity.  If this is the case, we will
 
2
 
;geed a formal letter of acceptance from you together with a
 
copy of your 501(c)  3 Internal Revenue status letter for our
 
files.
 If you have any further questions on this,  please
 
telephone me, or the Folk Arts Grants Officer, Martha
 
Kuenhold, who is actually more familiar than I with the legal
 
requirements.
 She will also be the person to talk to about
 
renegotiating the budget.
 Both of us can be reached at
 
634-4282.
 
Thank you for your help in this matter.

From-
 Bess Lomax Hawes
 
With the ready prospect of a few extra slots for personnel in
 
view (
even remotely)  let r
re make a
1 sugpestion that I }
relieve
 
would save the Endowment time, cash and patience, to cite
 
Herman Melville.
 
I recommend in the strongest terms that the Endowment hire a
 
sound ane film technician, to work under the general supervision
 
of Media, with the following duties:
 
a
.
 repair and maintenance of
. all Fndowment soured and
 
film reproducing eguiparent.
 (
!
Polk Arts has boucht some tape
 
machines of its ovn for the facilitation of staff and panel
 
review; I believe Mugic is eoina the same, and other Prograr
+s
 
will likely follow.  Thus we will have more cguipr
+ent to be
 
looked after than simply that in the -
Media screening room.)
 
b. r,�
*snonsibil
.ity for the running of screening presen-
tations in the Media Screenina
, Room.
 This would "
I th aid Don
 
Drucker, who has other duties, and relieve the Proarars who now
 
have to negotiate for non's time (f
i Muently patting for his
 
overtime out of their awn buckets).
 
c.
 train Endoi  ent personnel as needed in the {goner
 
ope ration of sound, film, ane video equipment, so that we will
.
 
have appropriate backup people ir case of need.
 
d.
 set up and record panel r
*eetings as necessary ane
 
Council r
.eetings in particular.
 Our sound systems at Council
 
meetinos are normally both rudimentary and gerry-built r if we
 
are inviting
_ the public, they have a right to ;
year what is
 
going on at the Council table.
 A full time technician should
 
be able to solve the sound enhancement problems no matter what
 
facility we find ourselves in
 
-
- 2 ,
-
e
.  Maintenance: And supervision of the tape and film
 
archives in Media.  These are valuable resources , now being
 
handled part time b
y various Media staff.  They are doing a
 
r
cooc  job, but this could be more efficiently handled by a
 
single individual.
 
I have checked this idea with bath nrian O
'f
loherty anO f
lan
 
nrucker , and they enelorse it whol.

FY 79 Closeout of Accounting Maeords and possible
 
delay in processing cash
. reouest
.s
 
The two to four week delay in processing cash requests could
 
prove to be a seal hardship for many of the folk Arts grantees.
 
On October 1 this program had
. 24 cash requests in the Grants
 
Office.  Many of these were grants approved at the May National
 
Council meeting.and hel up in--house due to the computer problem.
 
Some of these grantees received their grant letters two months
 
a
t, cneir project had began and their first cash request will
 
now he held up within the Endowment.  It really seems unfair.
 
Would it not have been possible for the Grants Office to have
 
been notified in advance.  Perhaps they could have attempted
 
to M cCaw* all case requests received (in our case 24) prior
 
to the four week delay.
 
At present, we do not feel that we will have an W
erjency"
 
situation, but each c
lay approximately three grantees with
 
cash requests pending call us to & A when they can expect to
 
have their money in hand.  2f tn*rt 10 more than a three to
 
four week delay, many will become "
 ncies "
.  And fielding
 
these calls is a f or use of staff time.

Dear
 
I a
r° s
tarry to trouble you between neetinas, but we are up against
 
a difficult situation.
 Ve recently had a call from the Ver-ont
 
Council on the Arts enquirine: about action on their application.
 
When we asked what application, they said they hay
. sent ir
. a
 
request for second-year funding for their state folk arts procrar.
 
in April for review by the June panel neeting.
 It never arrived.
 
Quite franRly, I think they had thoucrht it would be a shoo--in
 
ant so they hadn't worried about it at all.
 Now, if they can't
 
get funding by January 1
, they will have toffire the project
 
director, Jane: Beck, and the program will grind to a halt.
 
We have thise options:
 
1
)
 To hole the application for full panel review at our
 
Noverrher r
reetina.
 .
At the full amount rerruesteu,  it would have
 
to go to February Council for funeinq in April.  Verr
<
sont says
 
they cannot hald out that long.
 
2
)
 To get then to come to the December r
Reeting with a
 
reduced budget (
say, for half a year
.) and re--
apply for the rest
.
 
later on.
 This would enable us to take it as a Chairman's
 
action for January 1 funding, but would double the eventual
 
paperwork.
 
3
)
 To poll the panel on the application as it should have
 
been seen at the June panel.
 This panel d6cision can be sub__
 
witted as late material to the Noverber C
.orncil, allowinn funding
 
(i f.  approved) by January 1.
 
ar
, enclosing
_ a ballot for your use.
 Please phone us what you
 
want done, and return the ballot with any feedback you want to
 
give to the
 p roject.
 I xn also enclosing the material that would
 
have been in the .
Tune panel book in case you select option 3
;
 
2
 
if you do, please indicate whether or not you approve or reject
 
the application as it stands.  T ease act as speedily as you can.
 
I am only polling the panel ",rbers who acted on the original
 
enplication and a few others who have sr
secial interests in
 
Vew England, so I need to have your views quic Ky in case you
 
e
lect option 3
.
 
Sorry to lay this on you.  This is the second application that
 
has been lost in the mail this year, and that is two too r

Professor Alenriat has technically been on the Folk krts panel
 
for a year, unfortunately resigninc' from the panel in mie-course
 
because of i
ll health.
 F
ie has offered to continue assisting the
 
panel by reviewing Puerto Rican and Newyorkican arplications
 
at a distance-  I am extremely hopeful that rec,-very from his
 
recent surgery will restore him to his fors-er vigorous state
 
of health.
 
nurinr
, his abortive Panel membership, however, I had direct
 
occasion to observe the esteen in which he is held by scholars
 
and -
-
-- rix;t importantly -
-- anyone knowledgeable in Puerto Rican
 
arts.
 He is widely considere+4
, the "father of Puerto Rican
 
cultural studies"!  he has been active in developina radio and
 
television on the island- he single-handedly launched a highly
 
successful program to revive the use of the cuatro, a :
small
 
guit ar formerly characteristic of Puerto Ricii
T
-nisic but in recent
 
times fallen out of popularity;  he has taught many oene:rations
 
of young Puerto Rican artists, musicians, actors and dancers.
 
He is probably the sinrle most respected name in ruerto Pican
 
indicenous arts,  and -- an important point -
-- a nare that
 
seems to he respected by all the varyinc Puerto Rican political
 
groups.

MEMORANDUM
 
To!  Mary Ann Tiahe
 
Fror.  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Subject:
 Report of the Task Force on Hispanic A
rrerican Art
 
In thinking about the Hispanic Task Force report, one important
 
consideration should be born in mina;
 the concerns expressed
 
in this retort- are shared, in Folk Arts' experience, by every
 
cultural minority in the United States.  Some groups are more
 
vocal
. than others- some *
tore numerically strong; some popu-
lations more thinly scattered or more geoura
.phical
.ly centere4.
 
There are ;
zany differences, but the essential problar^*s are the
 
same.
 
From our experience, the most critical prohlems are-
1
)
 Communication - knowinc about the Endoim
r
.ent, the
 
State Arts Aaenca
i
.es, and other sources of assistance.
 
Here, we agree with the sugc
;estion of special workshops for
 
Hispanic groups.  I
lan Sheehy reports that on his recent Texas
 
trip, Professor George "
rruan asYed that Dan return so that a
 
large meeting of interested Brownsville residents could be
 
planned.
 
The idea of increased on--site visits to croups in the rid-west
 
and the South-west would surely be helpful.  our experience
 
indicates that panelists and other consultants are more effective
 
in ar
e evaluative role; staff visits are especially useful in
 
explaining proarams and polie
.ies.
 Attention neeess to be paid
 
to panel travel budge ts, staff travel budgets and
., especially,
 
staff size.  We cannot make staff visits that leave the nroclra r
.
 
unmanned in Washington.
 
Folk Arts is thinking of putting out a :
special flyer describing
 
our apprenticeship program exclusively.  Our thought is that this
 
category, which tight be
: of particular interest to ntnority
 
groups and individuals, is so buried in our larger quidelines
 
that many people who might like to know about it -
dust don't get
 
that far.
 If this should prove a useful stratecry, other prograr^s
 
night think of nutting out special inexpensive flyers announcing
 
those categories that would he of special interest to cultural
 
minorities.
 
�
)
 Evaluation - is our process of judging a-pli
.cations "fair"?
 
The first consiOeration here is r
+inori
.ty presence on panels, and
 
Folk Arts' philosophy on this point is perhaps a little different
 
from the general Fndownent posture.  t
=hat we think is needed
 
in the application evaluation process is  a
) knowledco and
 
b
) wisdom, two qualities that are not monorolized by any single
 
racial or cultural
. c
rroup.  As A.B. continues to point out, both
 
staff and panelists need to learn to think more deeply and to
 
increase their raroe of knowledge.  One of the more interesting
 
ways to co these things is to have the experience of being on .
an
 
Rneowment panel, and that is the main reason that Folk Arts
 
strongly surports the rolicy of  includirlcr minorities on panels.
 
Tt is not that minority representatives are autor
+aticall
.y endowed
 
with the ability to evaluate their own culture fairly ­  indeed,
 
sometimes they are extraordinarily severe on their own people.
 
The issue is that it's only right to give lots of different
 
kinds of people the chancey to learn ant' crow through the panel
 
experience.
 
The position just stated would probably not satisfy so
-me of the
 
I
tisnanic Task Force members.
 Powever, we believe that we meet
 
their criterion of having an Hispanic review all Hispanic
 
applications by virtue of our having a
*
.
_
- least one Hispanic
 
F
rarticipatinq in all our panel
. -
seetings .  (
You n
=ight be am=used
 
to hear that one of the panelists Fol1  Arts will recommend next
 
month is a Mexican--American who, havin r
 completed his classic
 
work on Jananese music, has spent the past year learning
 
Aounanian in order to do field work in the Palkans this surrrer. )
 
As to rejection letters, Folk Arts tries to dive all applicants
 
an explanation of the reasons behind both acceptances and re-
jections.
 "What dent right" is as intereastirn "what went wrong".
 
'
 e also believe that both are better eiscussed over the phone or
 
in person than through
. the mails.
 After some
. experimentation,
 
Folk Arts is currently using only two rejection letters.
 One
 
says simply that the competition was stiff and the money small
 
and
 that further information as to specifics may be had
 
for the askinc; . The other states the same thine but adds that
 
the panel found great merit in the idea and that the staff looks
 
forward to helping the applicant d
eavelor a 7
"ore highly competitive
 
proposal, should they wish to apply aanin.  We've had pretty
 
good responses to these two forms.
 
3
)
 Technical assistance -
. how to plan, how to budvet,
 
how to raise outside mor
.-I
-es, and horn to write a fundable
 
application.
 
This is probably the most ei
.scouraaing n obler.  we haven't
 
fount' that one--tinge technical assistance (
say, for first appl i-
cations only)  is enough.
 Some of the groups we deal with need
 
assistance every time they apply for a different project.
 
There is simply not enough staff time to fill all the needs out
 
there.
 
3
 
"Start-up"funds, therefore , seem especially tricky . 'T
here are
 
already many T
?isranic ore
sanizations in need of technical assistance
 
and advice= it seems a bit fool-hardy to begin new ores while
 
the old ones are sti!l strugc-linr.  Folk Arts has occasionally
 
funded f

.h. the start--up costs of a new
 
festival or co munity event -- but we only do that under unusual
 
circumstances , anO we feel real.
 concern over the idea of
 
proliferatina new ornanizations.
 
We have given one experimental grant to strnnathen the management
 
skills of an ethnic organization (
Balkan Arts)
-.  The main thina
 
we have learned .
from this is that one year 's support is not
 
enough: it is clearly aoina to take two years to help them get
 
on their feet , and it may even rec mire three.  Frankly, though
 
we may sound a bit o

It has taken me a shockingly lono tire to art around to telling
 
you no, but it B
ras such a pleasure to see you at the Michigan
 
State Arts Council neetina in Ann Arbor.  One always feels a
 
bit daunt wi venturing onto unfamiliar turf out in the states,
 
especially, I find, at Arts Council meetings, but when I saw
 
you I felt right at home.
 
And hoer marvellous to think that you will be on the Council to
 
give the possible fledging of a folk arts }
proclram proper auidarce.
 
I
'm enclosing, just for your own private interest, a recent list
 
of grants awarded by our program;  I think looking throuvh it
 
will give you a better idea of the content and scope of our
 
program than any nurber of speeches.  Maybe you'll have time to
 
write me a
. bit of evaluation; Z am sure the panel as well as the
 
staff would value your co m
ments highly.  My own personal feeling
 
is that we are doing reasonably well except for the eternal
 
problem that 'pure research" is in the domain of the F
?umanities.
 
Well, we shall just have to work on them harrier about sponsorina
 
the field work we so badly need.
 
And speaking of staff, 2 have a new colleacue who z believe you
 
know.  As I ray have :
mentioned at the reeting, Sally Yerkovich,
 
the young folklorist who worked with o
ne, has left us and core
 
to F
F
irnanities.
 She has ;
d
ust been replaced by Rob Teske, who
 
joined us froze the University of Western Kentucky.  He asked Die
 
to send you his especial personal regards.
 
I hope all is c
roing well for you, Thelma, and that your health
 
remains vigorous.  You certainly looked well that afternoon.
 
Please see if you don't wart to charge your mind anal join us in
 
Los Anaeles; it bids fair to he an interesting meeting.

Dear John:
 
You may rememher looking at a recent panel meeting at the Luiseno
 
"culture bank
." materials, and r
ay mentioning that the photographer
 
involved, Susan Dyal, was taking the next step of helping the
 
Luisenos prepare an account of their project for possible
 
publication by the `
dative American Study Center at U.C.L.A.
 
Enclosed is the most recent cormunication from Susan.
 I thounht
 
you might fina
l it of special interest, since it Is the first
 
time, so far as I recall, that we've had an on-site evaluation
 
by the people involved in the grant.
 It took place about a
 
year after the Luisenos got the Bark.
.
 
The implications of wi
lat she say: seem to me fascinating in
 
terms of other museum and exhibit projects, and possibly worth
 
full ranel discussion.
 
The "r. and Mrs. Red rlk she mentions, by the way, are Yankton
 
Sioux whom she met at the Smithsonian while they were researching
 
their tribal history and she was working on Luiseno material.
 
They fell into conversation, she showed them the Luiseno project,
 
and since then they have become fast frienes by correspondence.
 
Her report on what sae's done with them suggests yet another
 
way in which we micht work.
 (
By the g
ray, I think
. Susan is badly
 
risplaced as a photographer in a commercial studio;  she's been
 
doing all this in her spare time,  imagine what she could do if
 
she didn't have to have a bread-
-and-butter job.)
 maybe we coule
 
do something a
lh
�out that.
 
Anyway, I hope things are going well amd that you're not too
 
involved in the teaching.  Any responses from the panel?  I
 
continue to find the stuff you've broufTht in so far extremely
 
useful.
 
Affectionately,

at the Institute this fall, and that he h

a reference.
 
Mr. Ivey has served with distinction on several Fndn*
, went
 
adv isory panels during the past four years.
 He was chairman of
 
the Folk/Ethnic Music panel in the Music Program, ,
 as well as
 
representing the field of folk music in the music Prograr's
 
Planning Council.
 For the past year, he has been Vice-Chairr^
,an
 
of the Folk Arts Program.
 
Our
.
 ina our associat i

M
Ir
.. Ivey to
 
be a highly competent folklorist, especially knowledgeable in
 
the area
. of American folk music.
 Ne has a particular gift for
 
organization and is an experienced administrator, as his work
 
as Director of the Country music tall of Fame has clearly
 
demonstrated.
 In addition, he speaks well, organizes his
 
thoughts and his "aterials clearly and quickly, and, I should
 
think, would make an excellent teacher.
 I have the highest
 
respect for him, and recommend him to the Institute in the
 
strongest terms.
 
If there is any further information I can provide, please don't
 
hesitate to qet in touch.
 In the meantime, I think you will

Dear Mr.  Royal,
 
Thank you so much for your report on the Port Townsend event.
 
We really appreciate peorle's taking time to write i
ts about
 
projects  we've funded.
 It's awfully hard for us to find out
 
the details especially at :
such a areaat geocraphic distance.
 
And I'r+ delighted
. that you were pleased by' the festival.
 
Concerning your idea of grinding traditional musicians to the
 
campus at Santa Cruz,  it sorewhat depends on how you wart to
 
do it.
 Generally, the Folk Arts advisory panel has put on-
campus concert series at a pretty low priority.
 lesidencies
 
are a bit "ore up our alley, especially residencies that serve
 
the surrounding come
tunity and not lust the university population.
 
You right be interested in cettinq in touch with gene Bluestein
 
at California State University, Fresno, Fresno Foundation,
 
Maple & Shaw Avenues, Fresno, CA
 93740,  (
209)487•-2553.
 He
 
has conducted an eytremely successful s
en
tries of folk artist
 
residencies at
. Cal State Fresno durina the last several years
 
and might have sore useful suQaestions hoth in how to *
write ur
,
 
an appealing grant nropnsal any  how to bring off a successful . 
college folk music residency.
 Tf you don't know him, don't
 
hesitate to use "y name when you aet in touch.
 He's a nice
 
fellow and I'm sure would be glad to advise you.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our current Folk Arts brochure for
 
your information.
 You will see that there is a good bit of
 
room for improvisation on the applicant's part,  so I hope you
 
can come up with an inter,►stino idea.
 Please don't hesitate
 
to writes again if I can be of further help, or you can simply
 
telephone me person-to--person collect at 242-634--4292 and I

Dear Mr. Palkin,
 
Than: you for your interest
:ina letter.
 
I enclose a copy of the: Folk Arts guidelines for your use.
 
You will note} that it contains three copies of our application
 
forms.
 Our next deAdline is listed as October 1; however
.,
 
since we have been short-staffed this summer and thus a hit
 
slaw in responding to proposals, I have extended the eeadline
 
to October 15.
 
I have several questions about your idea.
 They are sirnmly
 
intende=d to be of assistance in preparing your application.
 
In the first place, your rethod of research seems a hit
 
va r
naely described.  Which universities do you intend to cover
 
in your project?  Are you thinking of interviewing only
 
presen t-clay students, or are you planning to collect frog
 
old graces as well?  Now many?  How gar back historically do
 
you intend to attempt to go?  This is such a r
hammoth topic
 
that I think some closer focussine7 nee
 es to be considered
 
before you present your final application.
 
If I were you,  I also believe I would play down a bit the
.
 
idea that these song traditio n
s are b
e3incx "lost".
 Frankly,
 
I personally know lots of college songs; some of them of my
 
parent's generation, some of my own, ane some of ry childrens'
 
the songs aren't "lost" at all -- they just haven't been
 
collected and s
eat down anywhere.
 This may seem ricky on my
 
part, but the
 
)anel tends to get a k
nit depressed ane irritable
 
when every request is based on "dyinc" or "lost" arts that
 
they know to be alive and kicking though not formally pre-
sented or archives
:.
 
Finally, a
. f
e w technical c
latters.
 You will notice in our
 
guidelines that we can only give partial support to such
 
projects, normally on a fifty-fifty matching basis.
 Perhaps
 
your college can he of help here,  "soft" match  (
donated
 
services, eauinrrent, overhead and the like)  is acceptable,
 
but you will. need to think this over carefully.
 Finally,
 
should yon decide after all this verbiage to apply to us
 
anyway, we will need a sample of your radio work and evidence
 
of your technical ability as a sound recorei0t.
 P sample
 
treatment would also strengthen your applications  this coul:
'
 
either be written out or take the fora of an audio sample.
 
I hope the above remarks aren't too irtir
,
+idatinct;  it seers to
 
me an interesting idea if you can work it out.
 If you have
 
any further questJons, don't hesitate to write again, or you
 
could telephone me person-to--person collect at 2
172-634--4282
 
and Dan :
Sheehy, t
nv ethnorusicolocTist associate or I will
 
return your call on the federal lien.

 Long distance commercial telephone calls
 
I should like to draw your .
attention to Folk
, Arts' hurt
 
feelings concerning the above.
 We never
. (to r
my knowledge)
 
make any long distance commercial calla except to Alaska,
 
Puerto Pico, Hawaii, anO Canada  (for which calls we use the
 
closest FTS operator)  or to the Virgin
, Island's to which
 
garden  spot calls go commercial,  for some strange reason,
 
all the way.
 we do, however, do eonsidr-cable business with
 
all the above bizarre locations, and feel that it is unfair
 
that we abould be billed for calls that are essential to the
 
normal conduct of Folk Arts'  affairs.
 
Seriously,  is there no dispensation that can be given by the
 
Administrative Services to calls to the territories and the
 
commonwealths?

and docurientinR tinwork collections in the southwest, neither
 
the Crafts Prograr. at the Arts Yndownent nor the Folk Arts
 
Progran; have guidelines in support of such research-centered
 
projects.  The National F
rdowyrent for the Fumanities gives out
 
such awards through their Research Program, but the competition
 
for individual grants is extremely stringent and the application
 
process very time-consuming.
 If you deciee to apply to than
 
Humanities, let me suggest that you send a letter of enquiry
 
to Sally Yerkovich, Special Programs, National Fncdowrent for
 
the I

 I am afraid that all Folk Arts can offer is
 
support for another apprenticeship or perhaps a comrunity-

I thought you might be interested in the enclosed report.
 
Folk Arts had funded a Basque project to help pay the
 
expenses involved in hiring a txistu player to dive instruction
 
to Basque teenagers.  This report is from an ethnomusicologist
 
we asked to drop by and see what happened.  My view is that
 
the results are mixed, and I wonder if there isn't a better
 
idea that we could s
uggest to these folks when they get back
 
in touch with us next year, as I am sure that they will.
 
The thing I understand about the Basques is that they are
 
super-organized.
 It occurs to me they might be interested,
 
therefore in a more organized approach to the problem.
 
would it make sense to suggest to them that they try to
 
produce a teaching record with accompanying instructional
 
booklet, the record to include demonstrations of the major
 
techniques plus ornamentations on one side perhaps, and a
 
number of the most important tunes on the other side?  r
ye
 
could certainly afford to help them get the necessary
 
experts  (
an ethnomusicologist, a txistu player and a high
 
quality sound man) together to organize the thing, write up
 
the booklet and get it out.
 
Maybe this is the wrong approach entirely.
 But from what I
 
read here, maybe a ten day session in a summer camp
 
atmosphere isn't quite the thing either.  Maybe you could
 
talk this over with Alan and give me a buzz.  There is no
 
rush.
 The Basques are all feeling quite set up about this
 
particular project, but I bet I will hear from them again
 
early next year for a repeat grant.

Give my love to Bill, and especially to yourself.

Dear Dr. Pacholezyk,
 
I a
r, delighted to hear that the University of Maryland Baltimore
 
County is considering the establishment of a graduate proararr
 
in othnoriusicoloc�y.
 I have studied the plan you forwardee
 
with great care and feel that it represents an exciting opportunity
 
for your campus, for your students, for the field of ethno-
musicology, and for the state of Maryland.
 
I should also like to congratulate you on the clarity and
 
vision of your overall plan.
 I am narticularly enthl
.asiasticc
 
over your idea of using the greater Paltinore area as a source
 
of field studies.
 Acacemic neclect of the native cultural
 
resources of our major cities continues to amaze me; I
--save
 
recently heard -- and I have no reason not to relieve it --
that the United Ptrates now hosts rany of the finest practitioners
 
of the great r
zusiral tr
.A6itions of the world, from Cambodia to
 
E
crypt, from Africa
: to Ireland.  Your students should be able
 
to make sore tryly extitincs discoveries, of genuine benefit to
 
the study of ethnomusicology and of real delight to other
 
Americans.
 
I further agree with you on the noel for such studies.
 In my
 
capacity as a federal granting officer I find far too few con-
sultants with local expertise such as your students will s
lain.
 
t
ouring this present period
., when so many T
rRericaans are
 
engages? in a search for cultural identity, the importance of
 
the trained cultural advocate continues to rrow.  Many of t
ry
 
former students in California have found interesting and
. excitinc;
 
j
obs in education and related fields.
 I a
r, sure that your
 
well--trained young Maryland ethnomusicolocists will find
 
themselves equally happy with their choice of study.
 
Again, my congratulations on your exceptionally well--planned
 
and ingenious program, and ry very best wishes for its adoption
 
by your university.
 If you feel that a letter from me addressed
 
to your Dean or your President would he in order, I shoilld be
 
delighted to oblige

The rest of polk Arts ataff will, of course, be holding the

Folk Arts doesn't  have all that much eXP WL*nce with
 
individual artists anyway, and therefore probably couldn't
 
contribute a great deal; we can, of courage, at least
 
learn from the minutes.

xerc is the list of Folk Prts Grants to support Mative American

Frankly , they make us look a hit better than we are.
 Many of

since they were part

in the number and size of projects suprotted through time
 
reflects changes in Vie panel's trinkinq fror

I auess what I'm saying is that I'
*
*  not totally satisfied with
 
our progress , although we're horvinex in trore.  In the first
 
place, we just don't get enough applications dealing with
 
Indian traeitional
, arts concernsz this means I believe, that
 
we haven•t  publicized our program rroa6ly enoucrh.  In the
 
second place, many of the applications we 3o qe} are over-lairoe
 
and bureanoratically-loa0ed, and relatively little money gets
 
down to the artists themeelven.
 I
'r
n trying to rush our
 
appren
 ticnahip program as one of our better devices for tryir
_e
 
to get money directly to artists, as wo f
l as ensuring the
 
transmission of trAditional skills.
 
I still believe the Polk Arts Pro(4ram is correct it stayinv
 
with the concept that our job is to sur
.
,port ane maintain tra l
l
 
tional skills and art forms, l
.eavina to other Endowment Proctrar s

Country Dance And Sonct Society
 
I know no more what to do about these folks than you do.
 
It's a venerable society,  founded way back- when by a group
 
of ?
English Country Hance enthusiasts  (morris dancers, kind
 
of relics from the Elizabethan past, etc.),
 They do what they
 
do,  as far as I can tell, very nicely, but it's a little
 
bit moribund as far as Folk Arts is concernee.
 We have
 
wrestled with fundincx them
. several times,  and on the whole
 
the Folk Arts panel seers to have felt that it was a i
cing of
 
antiquarian organization without the kind of vitality that---
say —cloc
-giPa or even square dancing or contra daneina h
,,-
,
,s
 
in many com munities.
 We have offered to help fun-3 their live
 
music costs especially at community dances, but that hasn't
 
Apparently appealed to them
..
 
C
an the other hand, there's nothinQ really wrong with them
 
either.
 A perfect exanple of things that fall through
 
cracks.
 
T'd be willing to take these proposals to our ranel and see
 
what they'd think of it all once again, but I really doubt
 
it would be very successful
..
 Would any of their activities
 
qualify un0er Dance's guidelines?
 
Just as a footnote, Folk Arts funded the recant f
4olf Trap
 
festival in order to help bring in perfor-ers from the west
 
coast, r
oaming it a bit more "national" in scope.
 T thought
 
(as T always do)  sore of the ir s tu ff was

Near Ned:
 
Thanks for your letter and for telling me about the Kiva
 
Historical Puppet Theater.  An application from that group
 
never reached Folk Arts and, as far as i can find out, the
 
other possible Endowment Programs -- Theater, Special
 
Projects, and Expansion Arts -- never heard from them either.
 
I wonder where they could have applied?
 
I shall enclose a copy of our new brochure and a general
 
Guide to Programs.  As you will agree, I think, when you
 
read our brochure, I doubt these folks will fit into our
 
guidelines.
 However, they could apply to the Theater Pro-
gram,  if they qualify, or to Expansion Arts.
 Special
 
Projects is basically for multi-disciplinary projects of a
 
larger scope, but it night be worth getting in touch with
 
them as well.
 
Z
'm sorry to put this right back on you, but i hesitate to
 
show the material you sent t
he  around since the Puppet
 
Theater probably has a whole new idea in mind for next year
 
(
the earliest we could get funding to them, if successful).
 
why don't you suggest to them that they apply directly to
 
Theater or to Expansion Arts, or,  if they like, they could
 
send me their ideas for next season, and I would be glad to
 
try and broker their proposal to whatever Program seems -
most
 
appropriate.  The other thing to c
rake sure of is that they
 
have applied to their own state arts agency.
 It's startling
 
how many groups forget that the competition is much less cut-
throat on a state level.

)
 A major collection of traditional Indian art owned
 
by the BIA
. and stored at the I.A
..I.A.
 This collection is
 
extremely valuable, both intrinsically anO historically.
 
The two collections together fora a major historical record
 
of the development of Native American art.
 Major consider a-
tion should be given to the maintenance and the integrity
 
of these collections, regardless of what happens to the
 
school.
 It would be a tragedy if they were dispersed or
 
broken up.

Mr. Paul A. rol

Centennial Commission
 
Bacone College
 
Muskogee, OP y 74401
 
near Mr
.. Collyer,
 
Thank youfor your interesting proposal.
 I am enclosing a
 
copy of the Folk
. ?
arts guidelines for 1
'980 for your use.
 As
 
you are probably aware, our next deadline is October 1 for
 
projects schedules' to start in the spring.
 if it is difficult
 
for you to make that exact date, don't worry; we can he a
 
hit relaxed about deadlines,  since we set thee, ve ry far ahead.
 
Any time during the first twc weeks of Septer-ber would be
 
all right.
 
My principal reaction to your plan i
ts that it is very expensive
 
.
for a first-time festival.
 Our advisory panel tends to I
)e
 
conservative with first-time events, and I think they might
 
be concerned by the complexity and length of the occasion.
 
There would seem to be several ways in which the costs could
 
be kept down:
 the employment of more local artists would
 
cut c
lown considerably on the travel expenses.
 Zt might also
 
be possible to stage a two--day, rather than a four-day festival.
 
I would rot suc
,,
gest cutting down on either the promotional
 
expenses or the support expenses.
 However
.,  Z do not think
 
that the T
IFA can provide tents;  this expense will have to be
 
transferred over into your part of the budget.
 
Perhaps you could not only cut your costs a bit but also get
 
some field work done that would be helpful to you in future
 
activities by putting some of the travel money into locating
 
previously unknown Fative American artists in Oklahoma.
 
Judging by your travel estimate  (average 1,600 miles travel
 
per artist round trit
e,)  you rust be planning to bring in
 
mostly people from New Mexico and Ariyona, or perhaps Mississippi.
 
I think the ,
panel would be particularly aratified if it could
 
assist Bacone College to present  at least some Native American
 
artists .
from Oklahoma whose gifts had been overlooKed before.
 
2
 
Finally, I suspect that the panel will look carefully not only
 
at your budget but at the r
_articular people to be involved.
 
Certainly you seen to have a first--rate advisory council
 
already assembled.  Perhaps alone with your application you
 
can send in some examples of names of indivienalsartists you
 
riaht wish to invite, a list of the types of arts activities
 
you intend to demonstrate, and an indication of the training
 
and background you would expect in your project director.  We
 
have a hard-working panel: the more specific the information,
 
the better they feel
..
 
Please gear in mind that the above suggestions are s
imply
 
staff reaction.  You should apply for whatever plan at whatever
 
cost you and your advisory group think is appropriate.  t
ie
 
try to he helpful but in no sense coercive.
 
Please don't hesitate to write aaain, if there is anythina
 
further the Folk Arts staff can do for you.  Or you can call
 
person
_-•to-person collect at 202/634-4282, and I shall return
 
your call on the federal line.

Tear Mr. Thundercloud,
 
Thank you very much for your very interesting proposal.
 I
 
shall enclose a cony of the Fold
. Arts guidelines for your
 
use.
 You should try to nake our next deadline, I believe;
 
you will see in our guidelines that it is October 1, but we
 
have extended it to October 15.  we have been short-staffed
 
this sumner, and have not Cotten back to people pronptl
.y
 
enough to insist on the earlier deadline,
 
You idea is certainly presented clearly.
 My principal
 
concern is that the project is a bit expensive, even for
 
so many events.
 Perhaps you could give us some further
 
information on the number of people you would expect to he
 
affected by the activities or some further justification of
 
that sort.
 Some indication of hard cash match or ether
 
outside funds would also be helpful.
 
We will also need a hit r
.
 orn detail in the buda+et.
 Perhaps
 
y
,ou could give us a separate estimated budctet per event that
 
you are asking us to fund
..
 This could be a supplement to the
 
overall budget indicated in the application forr-
 I an sorry
 
to put you to this trouble, but the Folk Arts advisory panel
 
frequently asks staff to tell them just exactly what their
 
funds, if awarder
:, will buy; anti I suppose we should all he
 
glad that they are thinking of our tax dollars with that
 
decree of concern.
 
most of the events you have starred as conforming with our
 
guidelines seem m ite accurate to me.
 I would recommend that
 
you give a little more backup to the "style show" concept;
 
that nar a may dive the panel a hit of trouble as a trad itional
 
activity, even though the oarments  (from your description)
 
themselves will he traditional.
 I a
xn also a hit concerned
 
about the Fotawow.
 The panel has often been reluctant to
 
fund powwows, on the grounds that they are often selfa-supporting
 
events and the injection of outside funds might change or
 
0amage them.
 
2
 
Y should mention for your guidance that the Polk Arts panel
 
is particularly interested in projects that have a chance
 
of becoming self--sufficient.  l
ie have an infinitely broad
 
constituency in need of assistance, and we also believe
 
that most traditional nr
'ojects, if they are truly desired by
 
the community, can eventually sustain themselves, otherwise,
 
perhaps people really don't want them to happen.
 This is a
 
result of the panel's extreme concern that they not 'lay
 
things on' people.
 Anyway, Z would recommend that you give
 
us some special justification for the need for outside
 
fundinq for the powwow in particular.
 
I hone the above observations are helpful.
 Sf there
: is
 
anything further I can t
oo, please don't hesitate to write
 
again or call me Person.-to-person collect at 20?--634-4252,
 
anJ Dan Sheehy or Z will return your caI
.l on the federal
 
line.
 
We shall look forward to receiving your application.
 (By
 
the way, we will hold the Information you have already sent
 
for inclusion in your  file, so you do not need to send
 
another copy.

Dear Ray,
 
I realized after I Left the car yeaterday that I hack neglected
 
to thank you for your hospitality and also that lovely lunch.
 
I even got a quick walk through the gardens, thanks to Joe's
 
thoughtfulness.
 It was an extremely pleasant, as well as
 
interesting day, and I hope you will convey my appreciation
 
to your staff and to your Council members who were so corr?ial
..
 
I was tired on the way back and I can't hear very well in a
 
car anyway, so I feel I didn't rise :
sufficiently to our
 
discussion of the qualifications for a folk arts coordinator
 
(
or whatever you choose to call the position).
 
I don't think you need a PhD folklorist (ethnomusicologist,
 
cultural anthropologist), ?
but  I do think you need at a
 
minir
±ur an M.A. level with a couple of years experience
 
(
PhD equivalent) . The reason for my urging an academically
 
trained person on you is sir^ple.
 They may not know the
 
arts, cultural history, etc. of a particular group, but they
 
will either know who knows or they will know hou, to find out
 
who knows with great speed.
 
It is an invaluable asset.
 On s
ty own staff I happen to have
 
a PhD ethnorusicologist (Dan Sheehy); he is aware of or in
 
touch with a totally different nroup of experts than is s
ty
 
folklorist (
Sally Yerkovich, soon to l
ie replaced by Rol" Teske).
 
Petween the two of them and r
sv own circle of contacts, we have
 
a fighting chance of coming up with the latest information
 
available on almost any -Native American tribe or European or
 
Asian sub-group that
. wanders into the office.
 That's the
 
big value of acadenics.
 
Be sure, also that your academically-trained person has had
 
field experience, and liked it.  You don't want a librarian/
 
archivist (though every scholar archives sort of automati-
cally).
 Finally, I think a PhD level is about right in
 
terms of age -- young enough to :
stand up to the job physically
 
but old enough to have wandered around some.
 Look for a
 
4
 
candidate who has travelled, who has had different kings
 
of jobs, w
1io really sFne ms  to have gotten Around.
 
Well, you know all this.
 Z
'll m rtairly keen my eye Out
 
for available talent to refer to you.
 As to salary, as
 
Z told you, it varies widely depending upon backorour
_d ,
 
experience an6 length of tire in office.  We have sore at
 
$12,000; one at over $20,000 (
not on our payroll, however;
 
she's a highly senior person) . 2 think if you l
.00l:ed in the
 
area of 1£,000 to lt,040 you ought to be able to attract a
 
highly r
?ual
.ified person.

Gear Judith,
 
It sounds as thauqh you did a perfectly salendicl iob with
 
your Pride of ?wine Fair.
 7t is shocking 'had luck that it
 
was poorly attenc?Ed.
 I am enclosing a xerox of a I®tzar
 
a friend of mine in the Endowment received that ray explain
 
part of the problem, however, dandy 2ves agrees with you
 
that the gasoline genic was probably pr2marily responsible.
 
Wepprcahahly cannot help you with your deficit.
 I
've o
zone
 
to bat over this issue before, and have been told firmly
 
that we can't play it both ways.  The Enclowr
+ent doesn't
 
ask for the return of any profits made by a nraject, and
 
therefore doesn't hold itself responsible for any deficits
 
that may occur.
 (
cor+e government agencies do it the other
 
way around -- take back profits and make up deficits- nobody
 
f
 does both.)
 
What
  worries me shout your letter is that it sounds as though
 
you have emerczed from the expprience exhausted and a :
pit
 
frustrated, so much s® that you do not really anticipate
 
doinrr it again.
 I don't think you need to do it again exactly,
 
but Z do think you should steno' !
pack and take a rood loo k
,
 
at what you and yonr students were able to pull G
aff -
-
-
- a
 
really in-d eath look at Maine's three major populations
 
in a kind
. of
_ harmonious and cooperative settinv.  This is a
.
 
rare achievement, and z hope that, as your strength recovers,
 
you will begin to think about haw to capitalize on the small
 
n
iirarZe you've accomplished.
 
The problem with festivals i
re that they are over so soon.
 
I keep wondPrinq how t© capitalize on the investment of
 
energy and intelligence that aoe,s into them -- maybe post-
festival short or long-term residencies, or concert series,
 
or little tours of the surrounding areas or some
.thinn.
 I
 
:
mean, when You've g
r>
't
.ten all these great People together,
 
it seems such a shame j
ust to let the excitement dissolve.
 
A
r±yway: if you com
ae up with any  d-
er
.s along these
 
I
'd surely like to hear about then.  And
, we miOht very
 
well be able to be of help in funding...

Dear Ms. Menair,
 
Thank you for your very interestinq proposal.
 I am enclosing
 
coni es of the new Folk Arts guidelines for your use.  Our
 
next deadline is October 1
, for projects scheduled to begin
 
around April, and we'll loop: forward to hearing from you then
 
or later.
 (
Please don't qet too paranoid about our deadlines;
 
e
re deliberately set them
. far ahead.)
 
You will he interested to hear that Bob Teske, who I believe
 
vi
sited you during the snrircr, will be Jointnq our staff
 
September 10. and will be available to help you with the
 
final details of your
. application.  He replaces Sally Yerkovich,
 
who has accepted a position at the s
tational rndowment for the
 
Humanities.
 
Since "
fob  (who visited us recently) was activainted with your
 
facility and personnel, Z asked him t
.o comment on your
 
proposal.  He had a number of specific suggestions with which
 
I agree; they are simply intended to help strengthen your
 
final application
..
 
He thinks you should provide
: our revirswinq panel with more
 
detail on the content and focus of the exhibits.  I
le also
 
thinks that more information on exhibit preparation (who will
 
do it, will the items be borrower  or purchas e?, etc.) *
.
could
 
be of great interest.  You !
should also, of course, spell out
 
how you will be transpertinq the exhibits, ane who will be
 
paying for transportation costs.
 
Finally, he queried whether or not the third exhibit would
 
exactly fit the panel's guidelines.  Festivals and feast days
 
are clearly within our domain, but co*xmerce and the daily
 
lives of u
rine and mill wor)%rare a bit problematical.  My  own
 
view on the ratter is that you miuht want to ao ahead and take
 
a chance on coring in for all three.
 I dislike intensely the
 
idea of people's shifting what they want to do in order to
 
T
 
fit what they think we will fund.  Clearly, your proj?ct
 
overall is arts fecusseO, and Z think the par
_el will see
 
that.  They always have the option of fundina +
part of an
 
application, if their scruples aet too nuch for them.
 
I hope the ahrve suggestions are useful:
 Please don't hesi-
tate to get in touch with me or Bob by phone, if you think
 
of other questions you would like us to try ana answer.
 If
 
you call 2
.02/63 4-$282, person
.-•to-person collect, one or
 
another of the staff will call you back on the federal line.

 Since we believe the proved"re to be an imposition

I believe I have polled the

 We begin rolling with the panel chairr°an, proceeding

select in terms of their particular area of expertise until
 
we have an approximate clear majority.
 7 don't believe we

 I do the polling myself, taking notQs, which are

 We include information about the i34ue  in the

I an also sending a pane or two showing grant examples awarded
 
by the Falk Arts Program in support of Native American cultural

 You will notice that we generally fund in rather
 
small amounts and that we particularly support traditional arts,
 
rather than newer innovative art forms  (which are eligible for
 
support throcanh other programs within the Endowment).
 
if you decide to apply to us, please send us as full a descrip-
tion of what you plan to do as possible.
 If you have held the
 
pow-wow before, perhaps you could incluOe a proarar or similar
 
information.
 You should also give us some reason for requiring
 
additional funding.
 We have a very tiny buc ket and normally
 
cannot continue to fund events year after year;  therefore, we
 
are very cautious about building up events beyond a scale
 
where they can eventually be supported by the local community.
 
We would also like to know something about your Center.
 Is it
 
a multi-tribal group?  Are there any; tribal organizations in
 
your area that participate?  Where would the participants in
 
your pow--wow come frogs?  Vova; a the tribes in eastern Oklahoma
 
be represented?  Our reviewiret ranee takes its duties ve nt
 
seriously and examines each reauest with a great deal of care,
 
so please send as much specific information as possible.
 
If I can be of any further assistance, please don't hesitate to

Dear Ms. Uundon
 
Thank you for your letter of enquiry.
 
I am afraid I will have to be discouraging in my answer
..
 
The Folk Arts Proaram un until now ,
has not funded projects
 
concerned with teaching traditional  :
kills except in  two
 
very lir+ited ways:
 
A.
 we occasionally t
a
.Ssist in bringing traditional
 
artists into school and T
M
+useuri situations for rurposes of
 
denonstratina traditional skills.
 
b.  �
7P have a l
ir
.itea arpren
ticeship program, in which
 
inOi
.vi f
tals can study With a traditional master craftswor
'ker
 
on a one-to-one basis.
 
So far, we have not funded classes of the type that you propose;
 
and I don't believe that the Crafts Section of our visual
. Arts
 
Proaram does either.  However, I shall enclose auideli
.nes from
 
Moth Folk Arts and Crafts for your information.  Perhaps they
 
will prove more helpful than this letters
 
In general the rnOowrtent has taken an extremely cautious
 
approach to the whole probleri of training, i
t's difficult to
 
know how to help such projects with the very limited funds
 
at our disposal.  Perhaps you wouirl e
?o better to e
^noui re of
 
your Own state art: agency; a letter, such as the one you
 
wrote i
re, T
might be addressed to: Jack F
. Olds, Fxec. Director,
 
Iowa State Arts Council, State Capitol Building, T
ies Moines,
 
Iowa  50319.
 
As a final c m
.
-rent, please recognize that this 1.
s just one
 
woman's opinion.  You have every right to apply to the Folk
 
Arts Pronram anyway, anr' you should do so if you want to take
 
the chance.

in Anthrorolog;r, Averican Studies,or the like, a good typist,
 
energetic, and flexible enough to art as backup to both our
 
folkloric and administrative staff.
 
The duties of the iob woule include handling routine services
 
in all stages of our operation.
- but the primary responsibility
 
would he to help us with grant follow-up problems, including
 
setting up and maintaining a site visit calendar, keening
 
track of our media grants to see when rrograms are to be aired
 
and films scheduled, extracting and
. analyzing data obtained
 
from our
. ;
project reports, and generally keeping uv with grants
 
awarded.
 
This is the most neglected area of our operation as of now, and
 
the only one that makes me feel the slight e
st nervous twinge
 
wren I get ready for Congressional hearings.
 The present
 
staff simply cannot add this oversight function to their
 
regular duties.
- they are already working far too much overtime
 
and, I notice with dismay, are getting sick at a gradually
 
increasing rate.
 Their morale continues high, but I cannot
 
ask them to do anything else, nor can I ask myself either.
 
I an starting, by the way, an atter+pt to keep track of just
 
what each of the current staff is doing on a
. day-by-day basis.
 
I
've been too administratively naive to realize the importance
 
of this until recently, but since such a high proportion of
 
ghat we do every day results not so muc h in gran
ts awarded
 
as in activities that surface elsewhere in the Endowrent or
 
in other federal agencies, t feel that I owe it to you to
 
{
 
i
 
2
 
give you a better ides of our actual M eration.
 I
'll ho-Pe
 
to have some kind of an over--view paper before you in the next
 
couple of months.
 In the reantime.  I myself was startled to
 
find out from Folk Arts' secretary that she is sending out
 
our brochures and auidelines at a rate that has now increased
 
to between 75 and i00 copies a week.

Subject:  Folk Acts 1980 Fc;uipnent and Administrative
 
Services Needs
 
Folk Arts is over--crowded, resstY , ant
i frustrated.
 A great
 
deal of this is cue to the fact that we have s
rinimal storage
 
and work equipment.  Far too much time is spent re-arranaina
 
piles on the floor, and running around borrowing equipxr
.ent
 
from other Programs.  To help our remarkably efficient staff
 
aet their work done in a more hunan
.e atmosphere in 1980, we
 
have the following needs:
 
1 Selectric IT typewriter
 
2 calculators with tape
 
1 electronic hand helm calculator
 
1 five-drawer file cabinet
 
1 typincF table
 
1 table with two or mare levels to store
 
active applications
 
2 reception chairs
 
l reception table
 
l wheeler' cabinet for our new audio--visual
 
equipment
 
1 bull--dozer to clean out the hall leading to
 
Folk Arts from the elevator
 
The Endowment can save monies by substituting muscle power for
 
the fi nal equipment item.  The preceding requests, however,
 
are minimal, necessary, and, frankly, only our fair share.
 
Folk
 
Folk Arts is further requesting one additional personnel slot
 
in 1980.
 If this request is granted, we will require in
 
addition to the above items, one complete work station extra
 
(
estimated total cost: $2,000).  We do not now have the
 _
.
.
 
necessary equipment and furriture to house another body.
 
Finally,  (
in case this would be helpful information for the
 
future) we plan to ask for another slat in 1981; this would
 
likely complete our projected staff pattern for the fore-
seeable future.

DRAFT STATEMENT FOR MRS. MONDALE
 
Festivals are, aoove all else, occasions for rejoicing, times
 
when we can pleasure ourselves by displaying all those aspects
 
of our lives that we believe to be the most beautiful, the
 
most worthy of admiration.  Festivals allow us to step back
 
from the everyday part of our lives and admire what we have
 
created out of our own ideas of what is good and what is
 
beautiful.
 
Especially in our great cities, where so many peoples have
 
come together from so many different places, our workaday
 
public behavior, dress and style identifies us mostly in terms
 
of what we do.  Festivals, however, allow us to show who we
 
are, and thus each group and each individual can rejoice in
 
public, not just in their own particular creative visions.
 
but in those of their neighbors as well.
 
Festivals, thereby, are occasions when our multi-parted
 
peoples can convene in mutual admiration and respect.  As such,
 
they are positive steps towards social peace and understanding.
 
V
's need these special times when our everyday focus can broaden,
 
when we can delight in the many works of humankind.
 
I wish the words of the conference well.  And I hope you will
 
continue to invite me to many many more festivals.

Dear Bonnie,
 
Thanks for your letter and the script.
 I
'm afraid I
'm going
 
to disappoint you, but I sir
,nly have no real reaction.
 I
 
guess I a
re at the wrong age or stage of life or something,
 
but I find it terribly difficult to focus On  that particular
 
part of my east.
 I can do it when somebody like navid inter
.-
views me, but even then I don't like to r
ho it very much.
 T
 
think it's because the period still seens to me extremely
 
comnlex and delicate, and when I talk about
, it or anybody
 
else writes about it, it suddenly turns sort of cartoon-like
 
and simplistic.
 
Anyway, I wish I could be of more help in an advisory capacity.
 
In practical terms, I have forwarded your script down to our
 
Meeia Arts Program for their response and comment, and they
 
will, I expect, be netting in touch with you directly.  They
 
are smart and efficient folks and very hard workers.
 I think
 
you will be in good hands.  The co--funding business is indeed
 
a problem, but I an sure they have dealt with it before.
 
All the hest, always.  Feep in touch.

Dear ?
4s. Roessner-2lerman ,
 
Thank you for your letter.
 I a
re sorry to have taken so long
,
 
to answer it, but I have been trying
, to sake some enquiries
 
on your behalf.
 
As you will see from the enclosed Folk Arts guidelines, we
 
c
oo not fund individual artists, excert for those who might
 
;
rash to undertake an apprenticeship with a single traditional
 
artist.  This does not seem to fit your particular case.
 I
 
have also discussed your idea with our Crafts Program; their
 
guidelines (which I also enclose) do not exactly square with
 
your project either.  You may, of course, apply to either or
 
both prograns and get a final decision frog our advisory nanels.
 
I an
. simply c
xivincr you staff opinions.
 
There are two other possible sources of funding you right
 
consider.
 one is the Office of rducation at HEW.
 i a
rt sorry
 
I have not been able to find the correct sut,division of that
 
rather large agency for you, but they do have zany different
 
granting programs, and your has is concern with e f
tcation would
 
surely qualify you for their attention.
 Secondly, you might
 
enquire from the California Arts Council.
 Sometir►es state
 
programs are more flexible than the federal ones;  at least
 
it's worth a try.
 
I am sorry to sound discoura
.ning.
 Should you decide to apply
 
to the t
,1
ational '
Endowment anyway, you will find the appropriate
 
deadlines listed
, in the guidelines of the respective programs.
 
And ray t wish you all success in your quest for funding.
 
Sincerely,

 The next application

The only thine that worriers me a bit about your letter is the
 
expensiveness of the plan.
 We can only give one  y
,ear grants,
 
for one thing  (although you can reapply at the end of the year).
 
For another, our program is set up so that most of the money
 
goes to the traditional cra£tsworker-teacher, not to the
 
apprentice.

make a suggestion.
 Ms. Clydia 1

riaht be able to suggest ways of keeping

 We have taken

 Don't worry if you
 
don't receive a more official axtension notification
 
i
:vnediately.
- such forms come out of our grants office which
 
is currently swanped with end-of-the-fiscal-year business,
 
and such none- controversial iters as time extensions tend to
 
get shoved to the bottom of piles.
 
I an
, very happy to hear that your pr oject is moving
 
alone :

 If you get a chance to send us any tapes or
 
scripts or whatever, we're lave to have them.
 Don't ao to any
 
special effort right now, though.
 It appears likely that
 
either Dan Sheehy, the staff
, ethnornusicologist, or I will
 
need to nake a trip to Puerto Rica durinq the late su rer or
 
early fall, in which case we will certainly crop by  and pay
 
your operation a visit.
 We are currently debating dates and
 
which one of us should go.
 Is there any particular time when
 
you would not he available or when a visit .
from one or the other
 
of us would be
. disruptive or inconvenient?  If so, please
 
drop us a line post-haste, so we can avoid it.
 
With our continued best wishes for the success of your

 Partnershin Consultants
 
I have the names of a couple of consultants I could recomn►end.
 
Both are on Folk .
Arts panel, so you could come and meet them
 
at our next panel meeting  (August 24--25)  and size them up
 
for yourself,  if you're interested.
 
One is Clydia Nahwooksy  (Vorman, Oklahoma) .  Clydia worked
 
for the BIA for a number of years,  also at the Smithsonian
 
F
'olklife Program,  and has a deal of administrative experience
 
behind her.
 She is Cherokee, married to a
. xiowa-•C'or}anche,
 
and has recently set up a consultancy service for Native
 
American arts organizations in Oklahoma.
 
The second is John Szwed,  currently a professor at the
 
University of Pennsylvania.
 John is interested in evaluation
 
methodology and has just completed a study for t
h:e Folk Arts
 
Prograre on how we can qet a better handle on what we're
 
doing.
 John has an original and inventive minO -
-- the kind
 
of guy that comas up with interesting ideas and has little
 
time for routine bureaucracy.
 
A final suggestion is a folklorist who is not on the panel,
 
but who has wrestled with the current extremely complex
 
situation in Appalachia  (with the Appalachian Regional Develop-
nent Office,  and the t
.ational Park Service,  et al)for a number
 
of years.
 Fis name is David Whisnant.
 He teaches at the
 
University of Maryland, but Appalachia is his turf,  and I
 
think he would be extremely useful
. on any kind of survey
 
you might be asked to work on down there.

Subject:
 Indian Basket-maker Anecdote
 
I have tried to verify the details of the story I told
 
you during our recent lunch party.  As usual, oral transmission
 
had already started its eternal editing process° there is no
 
way to stop a good story from becoming better.
 
however, I checked with Barre Toelken
. (
Professor of
 
English, University of Oregon) who originally tole the tale,
 
and here is what he knows.  The basket-maker in question is a
 
Mrs. Maats  (
pronounced "Mats").  She is a Yurok, or a Yurok/T,upa
 
(
pronounced "Poops")  from northern California.  The northern
 
California tribes -- all small -
-- have lone been recognized
 
as the great basket-makers of the west coast- their work is
 
exceptionally t
1elicate, and t
ars. Maats is one of the last of
 
the great basket-weavers.
 
Several years ago, the Fine Arts Department crafts faculty
 
at the University of
. Oregon invitee Mrs. Maats to teach basket-
weaving to their advarcer� students, all experio
-nced basket-
makers  . She bevan her first lesson by teaching them a song in
 
Yurok.  When they inquired why they needed to knew the sons,
 
she replied that you should not gather the plants without singing
 
to them to explain why they were being so treater;.
 
She then taught then a whole series of soncrs that were to
 
be sung while they were softening the grasses and other plant
 
materials in their mouths befor e the weaving could begin.
 
When the students finally asked when they were going to start
 
working on the baskets, Mrs. Maats said, "we are working on the
 
baskets.  A basket is only a song that has becorie visible, that
 
you can hold in your arms, that you can carry food in."
 
She dent on to explain that songs are ways in which you
 
thank nature for its bounty.
 Baskets are what you carry food in.
 
The food goes into your mouth, and the songs come out (
and are
 
forr*
.ed into baskets).
 
The students had been thinking of a basket as an isolated
 
object that they could simply cope.
 Mrs. Maats, on the other
 
hand, could not think of a basket as a mere thine, removed fror
 
nature and from the people who made and used it.
 To t
ier, it
 
seems to be an expression of a whole complex of aesthetic ideas,
 
all of which fit together into a particular view of the relatio n-
ship of man and nature.
 
Let me add one cautionary note -- not every American
 
Indian tribe feels the same way about basket-making, although
 
many do.
 This story airply expresses one distinctive Indian
 
idea; it should not be rresented as a pan--Indian concept.

SUBJECT:  NA Cyllinder Project
 
Receipt of Alan's metro re Rob Black's project reminds me
 
to try to straighten out on paper some views of mine that I
 
do not seem to have gotten across verbally.
 
1
)
 Dissemination of the material retrieved by this project
 
to Native American tribes is the whole reason for doing it,
 
from where I sit.
 
2
)
 Dissemination planning is therefore critical, and must
 
be carefully thought out at each stage.
 
3
)
 As a u
rorkinc paper, let me suggest the fo2lowinc ground
 
rules  (
these are totally negotiable, and, in fact, are yet to
 
be negotiated) :
 
a
.  That the project workers resist insofar as they
 
hur
t
tanely can stand it, pressure from individual tribes to get
 
their own material,out, until the basic cepyina j
ob has been
 
completed.
 (
This, of course, exempts Tom's recent experimental
 
work with the Chir
+newas, a legitimate atteript to see how things
 
are going to work before we get too far c
lown the road.)
 There
 
is simply a practical reason for being hard-hearted and hard-
headed on this point; I do not see how the project can he com-
pleted, if it is continually interrupted with demands for e
special
 
extraction of particular materials uncovered.
 
b.  That the project begin planning now, and developing
 
funding eources for, a ninimum
, of five complete copies of the
 
entire  output of the project to be placed in appropriate regional
 
facilities across the nation.  The Museur of Northern Arizona
 
z
right he one such facilit�t or perhaps Santa Fe: surely VCLA
 
would be another, and Indiana another.
 This would allow smaller
 
tribes reasonable local access to the r
;aterial, and would facili-
tate crass--tribal investigations of shared repertoires, instru-
rentation, vocal styles, and the like.  Any such repository
 
selected should, it seers to r
ye, indicate willingness to utilize
 
-a -
Franc Lillis' brilliant strategy of replying to tribal enquiries
 
by selecting a nearby library with listening facilities and
 
sending the material requested out on inter-library loan.
 This
 
eliminates the problem of clearances and ownership and Gets us
 
back down to the primary point of our entire effort; that people
 
ought to be able to hear music, especially their own.
 
Fundina for this phase of the project would, it appears to
 
me, be r
zost appropriately sought from W 1
1.
 If you actree, I will
 
raise the
: issue in r
ay upcom na negotiations with Patricia Mcrate.
 
c.
 That particular tribal requests for copies of their
 
own material he referred to Folk
_ Arts at the Arts Endowment for
 
funding assistance.
 It may turn out to be too big a job for
 
us, but the existence of rccfional archives where all the material
 
can be found might help us out.
 This, however, is where Folk
 
Arts can most appropriately cop
se into the picture, helping in-
dividual tribes wore{ out what to c
oo with the material they get -
radio programs, issuance of tribal recordincs, re--location of
 
singers, perhaps even songbooks, who knows?
 
d.
 That we begin a coordinated effort to locate
 
private funds to help support all three phases of the project.
 
I still think
. that RCA Victor could be sold on making this their
 
big public relations fundincs campaign; there are oil companies
 
(
Indian owner.)  that I understand right be approached, as well
 
as private companies and
. foundations.
 This, it seems to me
:,
 
should be coordinated by Alan: we certainly don't want to tromp
 
through the sage offices in series.
 
e.
 That everybody continue to try to remain cognizant
 
of the other people's responsibilities.
 This is hard to do
 
during the rush of day to day business, but I believe it to be
 
essential.
 If the Library begins to spend its funds on local
 
tribal reinforcement projects, the monies will be eaten up
 
before the project is done.
 If Folk Arts funds a large recrional
 
archives project, we will not have the wherewithall in our budget
 
to take care of the tribes.
 
Well, this is the way I gee it.
 I hope I've put my views
 
clearly, and I believe ther! to be thoroughly debatable.
 I just
 
think we must have a plan, and here's r
ry two bits worth.

Dear Bill,
 
Just a hasty reminder that the panel wanted you to take a
 
look at the Fendersonvil le Arts Council's festival
..
 (
You
 
recall, it was rejected for this year with a recommendation
 
that somebody take a loop: at it; it's apparently been going
 
for some time:, so I doubt that our failure to fund it this
 
year will cause thee= to close up shop.)
 
Now, they do not know that they have been rejected, and I
 
probably will not tell them until after August Council
 
unless they severely twist my arr.
 Somebody naned Pat Hawkins
 
has tried to reach me, but I havcnit called back because we've
 
gotten into :
so much trouble from trying to be good guys and
 
letting people knots early.
 
if you should want to find out the exact dates of the festival,
 
you call Ms. Hawkins now at 615-322-0789.
 1 lust thought it
 
would be more convenient for you to have a reminder letter
 
since it is so far in the future.
 
There were two additional projects the panel hoped you could
 
fine: time to look into:
 the Monroe County Rural Feritaae
 
(
second year funding for traditional musicians to teach
 
around the state; we've never evaluated it and should have
.).
 
The person to qet in touch with here is Robert Martin, project
 
director 334•-772--3159, in Union, West Virainia 24993.  Thep
.,
 
if it's possible to get there from the m*, the panel horrid you
 
could stop in and talk with the Randolph County Creative work-
-
shop people (we funded them once or twice and turned them down
 
the second year) . You should  probably see "
c
larion Harless,

Bill, when and if you net ready to do these visits, Ove r
y

'll authorize the trip with NCTA;  they'll take
 
over from there.
 Sorry to lay such a long screed on you,
 
but it seemed to me batter on paper than by phone.

Griswold and Lois Bingham.
 The substance of these letters
 
ind ieateO to us that negotiations for the loan of the exhibit
 
had been undertaken with the S
Trithsonian and that they were
 
proceeding snoothly.
 
The Folk Arts advisory panel was further encouraged to
 
learn that panelist, Clydia Nahwooksy of Norrsan, Gklahoma,
 
an experienceO ;
a
ebrinistrator who has worker' both at the BIA
 
anid the Smithsonian, was in close touch with Reverend Pauahty
 
and woule be able to keep an eye out on the development of
 
the pr oject locally.
 
The panel concluded, on the basis of the above information,
 
that matters were in good enouoh share for us to allocate
 
some funds for the support of this worthy project.
 Obviously,
 
no funds will be released until negotiations are complete
 
between the Snithsonian and the Fort Sills Museum
s or whatever
 
other appropriate:
; facility is eventually agreed upon.
 
I ar
. sorry if you feel we acted with undue baste and
 
I also apologize for not ha*sine known that your office should
 
have been involved.
 I telephoned
. you a few days a
cTo when
 
Ms. I
.
Nahwooksy was in town on a surprise Plying visit hoping
 
that the three of us could meet and review the situation,
 
but yzou were not available at such short notice.
 Since she
 
appears to be quite conversant with the Kiowas as well As
 
knowledgable about local museum facilities, you :
nierht wish
 
to speak with her by phone.
 She can be reached at 405--360-4420.
 
Or I would be happy to provide you with any further information
 
I Night happen to have.

Dear Professor Aleqria:
 
^
'hank you for your letter infor.minq us of your inability
 
to attend the recent Folk Arts panel r
neetinc.
 It arrived
 
in time for us to locate a substitute:
 Dr. Jose Limon
 
of the University of Texas.  He is a fine scholar and i
 
hope will consent to continue working with: us on the Folk Arts
 
Panel.
 
However, his area of exnertige is the southwestern Hispanic
 
tradition, rather than the Caribbean.  We are in greatest
 
need of the area that you, above all others that I have been
 
able to locate, represent.  Resides, I find it culturally
 
irresponsible that there is no Fndowment panel that contains
 
a panelist from Puerto Rico.
 
Could I possibly urge you to reconsider your resignation?
 
we would be more than happy to retain a place for you with
 
the understanding that you probably could not attend every
 
meeting, or naybe even every other r
^eetina?  Perhaps, indeed,
 
on the occasions where you could not he with us, we could
 
simply nail you copies of any applications on which we most
 
desperately need your advice and counsel
., anO we could discuss
 
them by telephone.  The development of a wise and a
sianificant
 
policy vis-a-vis Puerto Rican traditional culture is of
 
primary importance to the folk Arts panel
., and as of now, we
 
are simply feeling our way.
 
I am sorry to be so importunate.  Perhaps we will be able to
 
schedule a meeting in San Juan this coming year.
 in the
 
meantime, our next ;
panel meeting dates will be Ansust 23-26, 1979,
 
and November 29 through December 1
, 1979.
 Someone from the
 
office will he in touch with you soon to see if you will be
 
able to join us on either e
late.

SUBJECT:
 National Park Service
 
Pursuant to your recent announcer-ent of the cooperative effort
 
between the Arts Endowment and
. the pepnrtrent of the Interior
 
to promote cultural activities in the nation's parks and
 
recreation areas,  I thought it night be of interest to you
 
ho %now that Folk .
Arts has been informally working along
 
these lines with the 3ational Park Service for some time now.
 
A resume of our funding activities is attached.
 Most of them
 
have resulted fror a cooperative agreement between "
.
+PS and the
 
National Council
. on the Traditional Arts to help develop
 
local folk arts activiti es in federal parks.
 When the NCTA
 
has developed a viable program, the,  sometimes advise the
 
}
park in question to apply for rclk ,
Arts assistance throuab
 
their affiliated foundations in order to aet the ball roiling
 
for the first few years.
 As always with our program, our
 
stress is on helping find local traditional artists who can
 
act ns story tellers,  local histor ians,  crafts der-onstrators,
 
entertainers and the like in their own nearby park.
 So far,
 
this has worked out very well anO is,  incidentally, highly
 
energy-conserving.

'o Whom It May Concern
 
I have recently been informed that Ms. Martha ruenhold, an
 
employee of the National Endowment for the Arts, has been
 
su m
,oned for jury duty.  ^hip
* letter is to request that
 
ms. auenhold's tern.
  of service be postponed until the last
 
two weeks of september or some time during the month of
 
October.
 
We make this request reeoanizinq that t
a
rs. Fuenhold must fulfill
 
her civic duties.  1
iowever, because of the nature of '
`
 s
. ruenhold's
 
job and the complexities of the schedule under which she works,
 
we respectfully urge you to postpone her jury service until the
 
period indicated.
 
Ms. Yuenhold is a Program svecialist for the Folk Arts Program
 
with the Vational Endowment for the Arts, a small federal
 
agency.  The Jivision in which Ms. Ruenhold works is one of
 
the smallest within the aaency, so that absences during the
 
summer months work a particular hardship on hnr follow workers.
 
An additional complication is that during the T
?onth of Auqust,
 
during which she is currently called for jury service, two
 
crucial three-day meetings have already been scheduled;  one,
 
a meeting of the national Council for the Arts 7  the second, a
 
meeting of the Folk Arts' advidory panel.
 She is required to
 
prepare materials for and stand ready to participate in both
 
of these meetings, her absence could seriously affect their
 
efficient conduct.
 
l
ie thank you for mi
.ving serious attention to this request.
 
Please note, again, that reschedulina Ms. Fuenhold's parti-
cipation in jury duty durino the six weeks starting September 15
 
would meet with no further request for postponement by this
 
agency.
 
.
For your information, Ms. huenhold's home adJress is 3551 Idaho

Dear Dr. Willard
 
I must first apologize earnestly for c
ry lone
. delay in answering
 
your letter of May 16.
 it is reajjy inexcusable.
 
I suppose the reason it has bumper' around our office without
 
anyone's taking actual hold of the issue, is that it really
 
doesn't quite fit our particular prog ram at the Arts rndowr ent.
 
T shall enclose a copy of our
. explanatory brochure, perhaps
 
reading through it will clarify our position
,.
 The real issue,
 
it seems to me, it that this project is essentially university-
based both in concept and in impact, and that is not what our
 
proc,ran is really about.  On the whole, I think it might have
 
a happier hone in the I
Tational Endowment for the F
tumanities ,
 
our sister a
rdency.
 
Can you allow me a few more weeks to explore t
!:is possibility?
 
My associate Dr. Sally Yerkovich, may be transferring to NEM
 
quite soon, in the reantirr
.e, she will be in close touch with the
 
Humanities staff and can investivate the likelihood of this
 
proposal's fitting into one or another of their programs.
 17
.1
hey
 
tend to favor university-based projectgr the Arts Endowment,
 
on the other hand, leans much more strongly towards projects
 
directed towards community organisations.
 
There are a few other questions to be addressed.  You are not
 
very specific as to just what or which traditional arts wyou
 
are thinking about here.  The Folk
_ Arts advisory panel, I know,
 
would want to know just how you defi ne '
'traditional arts'
'; I
 
should ir
.agine the question would arise at the Fumanitieg
 
Endowment as well.  Perhaps you could consider preparing a
 
more specific outline of what arts and which artists you are
 
thinking of working withr that might more properly refine the:
 
exact purpose of your proposal.
 
You may also f
oant to congieer using some other context than
 
the classroom for vic
:eotaning.  Althourrh classroom presentations
 
of the traditional arts can be highly effective, they frer
nuently
 
do not translate well onto video,  h situation where more of a
 
sense of the natural context of artistic creation could be
 
-
>  -
 
A
 
captured right be more internstina for the viewers of your
 
ta ms in the long run.
 
Finally, he sere that you are asking for enough money to c
oo
 
the project really well.  Too often people consider video an
 
inexpensive nediam at the start of a project, but when they
 
get to the paint of wanting to produce really top quality
 
tapes for future use and re--use, they find that their expenses
 
have increased considerably.
 
Either Dr. '
Yerkovich or I will be in touch with you soon with
 
a
(I' Ational sucsgestiors.
 In the meantime, if any questions
 
oc
-cur, please don't hesitate to call z02µ634-4292 person-to-
person collect, and we will return your call on the federal
 
line.

Dear Mr. Faker,
 
Thank you for your interesting and well thought o
xit proposal.
 
:
Unfortunately, you were misinfor-
r
 ed about our July l deadline;
 
we have no deadline at that time except for extrer.ely small
 
projects that are handled on an eierc
-Tency basis daring the
 
summer months.
 
Our next real deadline is October I for projects schedules
 
to start in the spring of 19SO.
 I hope this doesn't throw
 
your tirae-table off irretrievably.
 I shall enclose two copies
 
'
� of our guidelines for your use.
 
ME M
bLet me :
rare a few suggestions
 
a.
 
`
hough I quite understand that it is necessary for
 
'
 
you to provide such a project with an international focus,
 
I am not sure that Endowment funds can be used for work in
 
Siberia and Canada.
 I will try to get a ruling on this from
 
our lecal office:  in the meantime, you might consider juggling
 
your funds so as to come t
in with sorre other source for that
 
aspect of the project.
 
b.
 This brings up the issue of ratchinq monies.
 The
 
Fnso
 wment has some capacity for funding non--matched or
 
partially hatched effortss however, it is always reassuring to
 
know that the c
 rantee is not totally dependent on the federal
 
government for fun(:s in such an ambitious and,
 we hope, long-
enduring ,
project.
 We can accept "soft natch" for all or part
 
of your fifty per-cent, but some indication of other real
 
money would be terrific.
 
C.
 Finally,  it seems to me that you're planning too
 
tightly in terms of your sucagested time-table.
 I re dly
 
don't see how your folklorist could do all that work in only
 
eight months.
 Perhaps you nicaht consider snreasding it out
 
A hit; at least make the Period you're requesting for grant
 
support one year.
 But considering travel difficulties and the
 
oerreral slow and dignified Dace of most of the negotiations
 
1
9
, 
I have engaged in with An
-erican Indian tribes, I don't see
 
how a festival could he pulled together in seven to eicht months.
 
Maybe Eskimos make decisions and oraanixe themselves more
 
quickly?
 
Other than the above r
c�r
+arks, i
t seers to re your proposal is
 
in excellent .
shape, an:  I
'll greatly look forward to hearina
 
from you again.
 If I
 can b
-e of further assistance, please
 
don't hesitate to write, and I will promise to he quicker
 
in a
ny reply.  or you could call person--to-person collect --
202-634-4282 -- and I will try to reach you hack on the federal
 
lire, should it extend as far as Nomel

Dear J. Pfl
.eiderer,
 
I thank you for your letter of June 25, 
 thouah I an sorry to
 
hear that the project, in your view, is not rovina well.
 I
 
shall certainly look into the situation and 4ive whatever
 
help I can arrange from this office.  T
iowever, the Arts
 
Endowment takes the general view that the grantee has, by law,
 
the responsibility and therefore the authority to v
ranage the
 
project, unless, of course, there is evidence of any kind of
 
i
llegality.
 
kowever, we can legitimately enquire into the progress of
 
our grants, ant
i I shall certainly do so in this case.  As to
 
Mr. Baron, again we take the position that it is not the busi-
ness of the federal government to scrutinize the employment of
 
any particular individual employed by our grantees.  we can,
 
and do, require that individuals hires: as folklorists with
 
federal money possess minirrurr, qualifications, but that's
 
generally as far as we feel we ought to 4o, remote as we are
 
from the scene of t
=le action.
 
I home you have expressed your concerns to the project director,
 
Joanne
. Allison, who is ultimately responsible for the overall
 
conduct of the grant.  Again, Z thank you for writing me.  We
 
shall certainly follow the progress of this crant with
 
consicerable interest.
 
sincerely,

"car Peter,
 
I apologize for taking so lanes to thank you for your cordial
 
invitation to attend the reetino of the Orec*on Arts Council.
 
As you know,  I have been locked into 1931 budgetary matters,
 
following which I spent a couple of days in l
ied with an ear
 
infection.
 
However -
-
-- S did enjoy the visit,  and I hope n
ay !
participation
 
was useful.
 I hope,  also,  that I conveyed to the staff and
 
the council r
ay personal and o mfessional
_ respect for the job
 
that Suzi has done in her short time in office.
 There is one
 
thing I forgot to c
iaphasize in -my remarks -
-m the real tour de
 
force she pulled off in netting the !
)regon folk arts exhh
iri t
 
into the Renwick.
 I think that effort has perhaps been taken
 
too r
.uch for granted locally.
 The fact that the curator is
 
from Oregon did not,  as you right suppose, rake "selling
,"
 
the exhibit easier'  it was actually harder in that he had
. to
 
be convinced to take a fresh look at sic;hts and objects he
 
had seen all his life.
 Ix it had not been for the excellence
 
of Suzi's presentation and the strong support she had venerated
 
throughout the Smithsonian,  she never woul6 have even aotte►n
 
in the door.
 Seriously, Peter,  this is a major achievement
 
in Washington terms, and the Folk Arts Program intends to
 
trumpet the news all aroune.
 
So -
-- congratulations are c
lue on all sines:
 to Suzi,  the

 Go we will assume that all is proceeding s "

I should be quite happy, of course,  to meet with any members

 I shall
 
get in touch with you during September when I have confirmed
 
final dates for my Ohio trip,  and hope that you will be able

Dear Mr.  Koehler
 
I am sorry i
 t has taken t
he  so lane
, to write and thank you for
 
my ,
pleasant anO warm reception at the recent meeting of the
 
Oregon Arts Council
..
 As always, when I visit outside Washington,
 
I returned home feeling I had learned more than I had given.
 
It was a pleasure to participate in your weeting,  and i only
 
regret that my time was :
so limiter.
 
T should like again to congratulate you for the strong leader--
ship role the Oregon .
Arts Council has taken in regards to the
 
Folk Arts.
 Yours is one of the most successful state programs
 
in the nation.  and I use you as a good exarple every day in
 
my discussions with other states.
 The fact of the Renwick's
 
acceptance of the Oregon Folk Arts exhibit is an achievement
 
I perhaps did not spear: enough about in P
ty  remarks.
 It is
 
really sensational news!  I doubt that any other state folk
 
arts proaram could have mounted an exhibit worthy of that
 
institution at this particular time.
 Conarat lations are due
 
all around
 to you and the Council for your strong support
 
of the procTram, to Peter Vero and his staff for their energy
 
and dedication,  and most especially to Su-
-i Jones whose
 
eneraetic Professionalisv
.r and devotion to the highest standards
 
of quality Fade it all possible.

I think ycu should ao to Fire Pluff.
 I would appreciate your
 
evaluation of the overall situation, and your reco mendations
 
for what to do next.
 
I must tell you, t
lioi
.1gh, that we
. are having to get a bit more
 
formal in te r
ns of site reports.  The main problem is a certain
 
neurosis that is developing in the field among those visited --
 
a feeling that there s
erf: "secret" reports(undoubtedly saying
 
nasty things a but thea
:) on r
.
ile forever in some dread office
 
in T
lashinaton.
 
I have interviewed our legal officials on the point, and they
 
tell me that when you (
a panelist or consultant) go somewhere
 
and look at something for a fee paid by us, the resulting docu-
ment is the equivalent of an inter-office memaranduul and doesn't
 
have to be shown to anybody.
 As usual, this takes care of
. the
 
JQra1 problarn but doesn't bear upon the rural or the ethical
 
issues.
 
t
ry suggestion is that everybody going out on site visits for us
 
should produce not only* a site
. report (which s
! ,,
nuld include
 
nar;es, addresses and shone numbers, if }
possible, of those
 
visited) but a separate sheet of paper su m
-
 inq up any r
.ecommend-
atx
L ms that night have occurred
) to you, whether previously
 
orally transmitted or not.
 I can then keep the report (which
 
can be written in free verse and s
aY  a
ll manner of scandalous
 
things as suitable) , and send a copy of the recommendations to
 
the group that was visite=
d, alone with a nice soothing note
:.
 
As for the Texas report, I find it intensely er+bArrassina --
both as a Texan and a folklorist.
 I really don't know what to
 
do about it, it seems to g
ee the ultimate of what we don't want
 
to have happen.
 it's a lesson to us all
 if you co in to
 
a community  via the middle--class exclusively, they will never
 
get their claws out of your hack.
 
I wish t had some words of wisdom to of

Festival of Native Arts
 
University of Alaska
 
Fairbanks, Alaska  997€1
 
Dear Ms. Pootoogooluk,
 
I apologize for the delay in answerinq your letter.
 
Unfortunately, your request arrived just after our final
 
deadline for the current fiscal year.
 Our next deadline
 
is not until October 1 fcr projects scheduled to start about
 
six months later.
 Your scheduled dates for the 1980 festival
 
are uncamfortabl
.y tight, and allow no time for research expenses.
 
The best suggestion I can make is that you see if you
 
cannot keep your request to ;17,530 or f low.
 This would
 
enable us to put your grant through  (
if recormended)  as a
 
Chalrman's Action, and would speed it up by about three
 
months.
 By law, grants recommended that are more than
 
17,100 gust be reviewed by our `
rational Council before they
 
can he signed by the Chairman, and this lengthens the process
 
considerably.
 
Actually, the Falk arts panel generally recommends second year
 
funding for a festival at a lower amount than the first year
 
anyway, so perhaps working to this figure will not be too
 
difficult for you.
 I shall enclose a copy of our current
 
guidelines for your use.
 Don't hesitate to call (
202)634-4282
 
if I or any of the Folk Arts stuff can be of further assistance.

Dear Mia Roynton:
 
Let me rive you some wor 4 s of advice.
 They be distasteful,
 
but they are meant to give You a picture of the reality that
 
faces you.
 
The  Z
ational Endown
rent for the Arts is a federal agency,  and
 
federal
, Qrants are extremely difficult to aet.
 You are up
 
against nation--wide cor^petition, competition that sometimes
 
involves extremely senior scholars who have spent their life-
times c
=onsiderino the iss;?es anal the problems of their concerns.
 
Even they are often washed out.
 You cannot depend upon outside
 
aid and advice to help you formulate the solution to your
 
problem you are addressing: you must know that exactly what
 
you proTxase to Oo is the only answer, or at least the very
 
teat answer possible from every point of view.
 You gust be
 
extremely grow n-up,  and you must be extremely serious.
 
This was the essential difficul ty  (I believe)  with your appli-
cation.
 It was hurried,  a bit casually assembled, and had an
 
unfortunate flavor of arateurishness about it.
 rven more
 
deadly was the slinht sense that you were more concerned with
 
your own career than with Lily May Ledford's.
 That ray, of
 
course,  not he true,  but it came through that way.
 It even
 
shows up in your letter of June 21;  there is a hit of a feelincs
 
that you neee a grant in order to pursue your career,  therefore,
 
you ought to qet one, and that you could,  if you only had
 
adequate advice from the Folk Arta Program
..
 
I repeat.
 Federal
.  g
_rants are extremely difficult to aet.
 I
 
encourage you to search your soul and see if you think that
 
exactly what you propose to do is the very best thing that
 
could happen to Lily vat  Ledford at this point in her life.
 
Are you the best qua i  ed person available to work with her?
 
How important is it that the project he done?
 What is the very
 
hest way to ?
pursue it?  What is the most i
r,portant distribution
 
mechanism to tap?
 In what g
ray will this project meet our
 
necessary criterion of cultural. significance?
 
2 _
_
 
If you can d
ob
-al with all these auesti
.ons, by all means reapply.
 
You can indeed apply three times a year fir the very same thing---
October 1
, January 1
, and April 1
.
 7
4e ll l be happy to be of as
 
much help as we can, but remember, Oo, that we are eealino
 
with a huneree and fifty-odd equally serious applications each
 
deadline.
 There's only so ouch help we can offer each individual.
 
Yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

P.S.
 You will he happy to s
hear that, pursuant to our conve r-
sation in my office, I was able to persuade Berea College to
 
care in for an application to take ?
oily May as a
re artist-in-
residence.
 Though the grant has not yet been officially
 
approved, the signs are good, and I a
rr very hopeful that all
 
will go amoothly .

 Regional Representative Job Descriptions
 
.
Although a number of Recional Representatives have been
 
personally helpful, I canit say that the system itself is
 
crucial for Folk Arts.
 Referring to the job description
 
(
page 8
) :
 
a.
 Site visits.  Folk Arts applicants and grantees are
 
frequently off the beaten paths that the RR's travel.
 I am
 
unable to think of a 3inQle exar
.nle when anyone was able to
 
visit a site I had suggested.
 
h.
 Informing programs about developments in state arts
 
agencies.  There has been :
 o ni e  cotm-unication here, but nothing
 
that required an interpreter.  State arts agencies usually
 
can, and c
oo, speak for themselves.
 
c.  Use of folk artists in schools.
 This function has
 
been more or less taken over by the Folk Artists ir
, Schools
 
Coordinator, Linda
. Ruki.
 
d.
 EncouraRing applications that fit ppnel priorities.
 
Most of r
+y contacts with RR's on applications have been on
 
the level of queries from there as to whether or not a parti-
cular application woul:
.l inde=ed fit our guidelines.
 
Actually, the major usefulness of the RR system to the Folk
 
Arts program is not mentioned in the job description.
 I have
 
several
, times rotten general information as to the qualifica-
tions and seriousness of an applying croup by asking the RR.
 
There is a certain kind of shielding function they per
.forrl
 
here:  it would have been, I think, more difficult for me to
 
have called up a state arts agency and said -- hey, what do
 
you know a
,�ut these Varticular folks?  State arts people are
 
often incliner
_
- to feel very protective about in-state Groups.
 
2 _
 
I feel a !
pit diffident about of ferina the above coi we nt s
 .  As
 
I saie, several of the Regional Representatives have shown a
 
real interest in the folk Arts Proaran and have been personally
 
constructive and helpful.
 Ine
?eed, we have no way of knowing
 
how many unsuitable applications they have screened out for us.
 
on the whole, though, I can't testify that their continued
 
existence is essential from our Prograr:'s point of view.

 It made my day, and I arrived it Oregon in a much

 I do believe it's the vex-r first major cr

to mount
  it is the plain result of all your many years' careful
 
field work and nresentatioral experience in North Carolina.
 
I don't know anybody else who would knew that much about

Dear Ms. Adars
 
I spoke with Barre Toelkean, past Folk Arts panel chairman,
 
s
l
rlortly after our telephone convergation.
 R
e= had several
 
suggestions for you.  first that you get in touch with
 
Peter Corey at the Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka.  Apparently,
 
Mr. Corey is an Anglo, but he knows native carvers, area could
 
discuss the cultural problem with you.
 
x
;arre's c
,ennral feeling is -
-
-- I hope I
'm quoting him correctly —
 
that it is particularly important to try to locate a native
 
carve=r because of the highly complex aesthetic attituees
 
you're s
tealing with in your area.  Yis i
rtnression is that there
 
are very few,  if any, F
paida carvers arovznrl any r
iore an6 that
 
yon will
. probably have to go wit1a a Tlingit.
 It's true, he
 
says, that you're up against a touch probler., and that it will
 
probably get touahe.r as timee c
►oes on,  but  he thinks you micht
 
be able to locate Nathan Jackson, a youna Tlingit carver
., or
 
possibly Sd kasco (
Kasko?) an older Tlipai t
- fellow last heard of
 
by Barre in Juneau.  :
Mr. Corey, Barre thinks, would be able to
 
put you I
n touch with these
; two aentlem
:en, and possibly others
 
as well.
 
The crucial thinct, if V ve  understoo(I larre correctly, is to
 
locate so:roone who is conversant with t"
.e sy-,rbolir_ content
 
that is critical to Tlingit aesthetics, and who will get in
 
all the idr
%as that ought to be there to r
%ake it a
. real Tlingit
 
pole.  Otherwise, they'll ;
gait until it's all finishe~�, and
 
then all the Tlingits will stand around an(! e
zrouse about it
 
forever
. .
 
I hopes this information will be of help.  Barre is conducting
 
a field survey in Montana for t
}zd next six weeks or s
ea, and
 
car be reached, should you want to talk to him directly,
 
through the Montana Arts Council at 235 Fast !

 Attached letter frog
► Newbold Noyes
 
Folk Arts helped out with the film "Root Hon or nips" that was
 
r
tade by Mr. Noyes and Fawn Fulton.
 It turned out quite nicely.
 
It's not a block-buster, but neither is it a
. diserace;  it's
 
a nice, quiet, sensitive filr- with largely local a
t-peal
 the
 
very kind of f
.iln we've been worrying about whether or not we
 
should put our money into.
 Is that kind of thing the very hest
 
use for our :
small 6ocumentary funds?  The panel will be
 
wrestling with this exact proble�r
, during their policy mpetina
 
in Auata.s
 t
 .
 
I have spoken with either !
Sr. Noyes or wr. Fulton, I forcet
 
which, about the Metronolitan -
Museum rroiect  (f
ihe Michael
 
Rockefeller exhibit- to the Museum of Prig
;; Live Art) .  It does
 
seem a shame that that effort should be abanOoned in r
aid-flight
 
solely because of the untir+ely death of Nelson Rockefeller.
 
Of all Mr. Noyes' concerns, this seems to me the most critical,
 
though I think it would require serious money.  Rerha�s nrian
 
knows about it first--liana; if rot, it would seem useful 4
1
 .
.or
 
rrian, or +
rf  
,or F
roth of us, to see first-hand the situation
 
and what Cley've already d
rone before the rndowment mRkes any
 
kind of commitment.
 
Frankly, the Rockefeller primitive art prof,
-
: ct doesn't fit
 
into Folk Arts v
iiilelines, but it does raise
. an issue I
 
worry about whenever I Have the time to: my ever
.-present
 
concern that thq rnd wment is not doinc
; enough to expose the
 
American public to the manifold art systems of the rest of the
 
world.
 I know that Museuzr
=s does some in this area, and Media
 
does sore, and Falk Arts ane rxpansion Arts s
loes some, but--
add it all t
ap together--it's awfully little.  And I don't know
 
where to tell people to go for help, especially ethnographic
 
film r
sahers.
 After all, why shoulen't we be supporting a
 
serious exhibit of primitive art from Africa and Oceania?
 
And films about it?
 
2
 
We face this ?roblem in every level of the Y
'ndowment, it seers
 
to me, Mary Ann.
 I will try to have a session with Ezra on
 
the issue of world music in the next few weeks.  '
"hough I a
.
c
:
 
firm in !
q
ty  conviction that we should primarily support the
 
developrent of A
 merican arts .
and artists,  it does seen that
 
soma corner of the Endowment sho"Id be devoted to the Oevelop-
rent of greater sophistication and appreciation or
, the part
 
of the American public for the arts of the world.  Nobody
 
else is doing it.
 
The rest of t
er. voyns ` letter is a lovely cataloqun of dreams.
 
Fe should be encouraged. it seers to me.

I should likes to recor
imend in the strongest terms the early
 
puhlication of Frank and Anne Warner's collection of American
 
folk son(-s.
 This is one of the r
+aior works of its kind.
 It
 
is encyclopedic in score, yet it contains material that will
 
refresh and d
.elic_
�ht both scholarly and lay readers.
 Anne
 
and Frank warner have made this hook their lif etime contri-
bution to all these who value the American musical heritage.
 
It should reach the widest audience possible, and it will,
 
via classroaom
, use and general purchase.
 
I look forward to the appearance of this enorr~ously important
 
collection with the greatest enthusiasm.

You are of course eligible to apply at any tine you want to.
 
I guess I do not think you should reapply to Falk Arts with
 
the same concept, as the aOvi
.sory panel did not seem to feel
 
that the s
ubject proposed would make an effective folk arts
 
film.  You might try, if you wish, applying with that idea
 
to our Media Arts Program which looks at samples fray the
 
viecipoint of film as an aesthetic art form in and of itself,
 
and therefore, doesn't particularly care what the proposed
 
topic is.

 Please
 
glance at the printed information enclosed and see if it is

The Folk Arts Program shares your concern for the traditional
 
artists of the Chinese corrunity.  There are two
, !
'p
assible
 
ways that the Folk Arts Proaran might be of assistance.
 One
 
would be a matching grant for support of an exhibition of
 
Chinese traditional art, possibly even one that could travel
 
from co  unity to co r

4unity.
 A second would be non-r
:

grants for talented individuals who might wish to apprentice
 
themselves to sore of your senior artisans.
 
I hope the enclosed materials  (whether 1979 or 1920) will he
 
of use in helping you decide on the best possibilities for
 
your

 If you area in doubt, please do not hesitate to
 
telephone the Folk Arts Prograrr for further information.  You

Dear Mr.  DuVal ,
 
I must first apologize for taking so unconscionably lone to
 
answer your enquiry of May 29.
 I had been hoping our new
 
guidelines would he off the press, but it seems there will be
 
another couple of  weeks before we g
rill see them.
 
They are not, however
., notably different from the 1979
 
guidelines I enclose, at least in tenrs of your particular
 
kind of project.
 You will see that the Folk Arts advisory
 
panel has elected to emphasize the employrent and honoring
 
of local traditional artists -  both in 1979 anc in 198©.
 
The problem is that we have such a tiny amount of money,
 
priorities r
eust be set somehow, and this is what they seer. to
 
feel is the r
:ost crucial issues  the exposure of local artists
 
to the local audience who so often believes that all folk
 
artists rust by act of Concrress have been born in Appalachia.
 
What: V m
. saying is that it is unlikely that the Folk Arts panel
 
would aplsrove overall support for yo.xr festival, but that they
 
right be interested in helping with those costs involv e: in
 
presenting your own senior Oregonian traditional folks.
 This
 
would,  after all, release some of your other monies to take
*
 
care of other festival elerents you might wish to include.
 
Should you decide to apply to us for fundirq, our next appli-
cation deadline is October 1,  1979.
 If th:y arplicration forr
.
:
 
itself presents any Cifficulties, please don't hesitate to
 
get in touch with us at 2}2/634-4282.
 Call person to person
 
collect,  and s
 mieone will return your call on the federal line.
 
Another possible source of information sne counsel would be
 
your own state folk arts coordinator,  "uzi Jones, who can be
 
reached at 835 Summer Street, NF.,  Salem, Oregon 97301,
 
503/378-3625.
 She has worked closely with t
l-t
e Folk Arts
 
Program during the past couple of years, and could dive you
 
very sound advice on preparing your application.
 
Sincerely,

near Mr. S

. ,
 
Please accept my applocxies for the delay in answering your
 
letter of may 25.
 I had been waiting for our 1930 cui=felines
 
(
soon, I keep being told, to come to us from the prEss) , but I
 
feel I should ;
gait no longer.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our 1979 Guidelines, since those
 
prepares' for 1980 do not differ greatly in tern s
, of the kind
 
of activities you propose.
 You might wish to observe some of
 
the following points in filling out the forms you will
. find
 
within the guidelines-
a.
 The most .
important question, it seems to me, is for
 
whom are you preparino these materials, especially the booklet?
 
7o you intend to direct your work towards crafts workers,
 
tourists, the general public, or any or all of the foreQoino?
 
You should think this through carefully.
 
b.
 Secondly, we should need to be assures?, especially in
 
connection with your video plans, that you are planrinc to
 
employ qualified Versonnel.
 Our single airy is to ensure that
 
any documentation project we fund is carried through without
 
any technical or artistic blemishes, so that the cultures so
 
preserved can be magnificently displayed.
 Please forward,
 
along with your application, some kinC of description of the
 
qualifications you would expect of the people to be employed
 
in carrying out your plans.
 Samples of previous work '
would
 
also be essential, especially from your video producer.
 
c.
 It would also strengthen your vroposal if you could
 
outline how you plan to disse-
u
rinate the videotapes, booklets
 
and other material to be produced by your project.
 The Folk
 
Arts panel is deeply concerned that projects we fund reach the
 
intended audience.
 
Finally, you might be interested to know that a current
 
member of the Folk Arts panel has recently moved to your
. state.
 
Ms. Clydia Nahwooksy, a member of our advisory panel for the
.
 
past three years,  is now 1ivina at P.O. Box 1512, Norman
 
Oklahoma 73070,  (
405)3 16
9-3271.
 1 a1<  sure she would be happy
 
to consult with
: you r if you would lice to qet in touch with her.
 
Or, if I or any of my staff can be of additional service,
 
you have only to call 202/634-4282, person-to-person collect,
 
and we will return yo"r call on the federal line.  Our next
 
application deadline is October 1
, 1979 for projects sche f
tled
 
to start in the spring of the tollowina year.  We will hope
 
to '
year fray: you soon.
 
Cordially,

Dear Jack anz Steve,

if I recall my Lewis Carroll correctly .  If push comes to shove,
 
-
make a donation to the Folksona Archive at L.C. in my narte (
hut
