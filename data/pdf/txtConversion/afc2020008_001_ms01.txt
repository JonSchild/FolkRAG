Edward Pany interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 23, 2021 at the Atlas Cement Company Memorial 
Museum in Northampton, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo:  
Today is Sunday, May 23, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational history 
archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the Lehigh Valley, 
Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United States. I am Vyta Pivo 
and today I am speaking with Ed Pany as well as Sally Madden. Ed Pany will introduce himself in 
just a little bit, but Sally Madden is his daughter, a librarian, and trustee at the museum. So, today 
I am speaking from the Atlas Cement Company Museum in Northampton, Pennsylvania. Just to 
confirm, Ed, you give me your permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
Ed Pany:  
Yes 
VP:  
Excellent. 
VP:  
So, we’ll begin. Could you tell me your full name, and when and where you were born?  
EP:  
My name is Edward Pany. I was born in 1936 in Northampton, Pennsylvania. I am a 
graduate of Northampton High School, Kutztown State Teachers’ College with a BS and Master’s 
degrees in social studies. I was a social studies teacher at Northampton High School for 39 years. 
Upon graduation, I worked at the Atlas Portland Cement Company, at that time it was called 
Universal Atlas Portland Cement Company. I worked there with my father for four summers. My 
father, my grandfather, my wife’s grandfather, uncles. All these people were cement workers in 
the industry here in Northampton.  
VP:  
And you grew up in Northampton as well? 
EP: 
Yes.  
VP:  
And where did you family come from originally? 
EP:  
My father was an immigrant from Austria-Hungary, therefore I am a first-generation 
American. He came from a family of fourteen. And the people came to America in groups because 
they just couldn’t bring all their family over at one time. So, when my father came here, his first 
job as a young man was on a farm because most Austrians were farmers and of course as he aged 
he started to work at the cement plant, where he put in a 35 year career and enjoyed his job.  
VP:  
When did he start working at the cement plant?  
EP:  
He started at the cement plant right after World War II, 1945/46. It’s interesting, the Atlas 
was operating during the war but on a limited basis, so they hired a large number of employees to 
go full production and in my research I found on some days they’d hire 8, 9, 10 men simultaneously 
and the next day 8, 9, 10 men. So, the seniority of workers was based on the time they were hired 
 
 
2 
 
and the date, because they used seniority system when there was a layoff. I wanted to remain a 
cement worker, but my father suggested that I go to college and become a teacher because I would 
be the first member of the family to have a college education. My father was very wise in 
suggesting I do that because the Atlas closed in 1982, so naturally I would have been actually laid 
off. As a teacher I was able to work until 1987.  
VP:  
So, when did you start working at the Atlas Cement Company? 
EP:  
I worked there from 1954 to 58. I worked all shifts.  
VP:  
Can you described them? 
EP:  
Well, we worked the day shift, which was still four o’clock. 
VP:  
And when did you start in the morning? 
[00:04:44] 
EP:  
I think we started at 7:00 o’clock in the morning and the afternoon shift was basically, and 
I am not exact on the time, it was basically from 3:30 to 11:00. And your midnight shift was like 
11:30, you know, until 7:00 in the morning. So, I had experience in working all three shifts and 
when you work all three shifts, you must really regulate your sleeping hours, you regulate your 
intake of food. So, it was an interesting experience to work basically 24 hours during tenure that I 
spent at the Atlas. Did I enjoy it? I enjoyed it immensely because I met a lot of good men who 
gave me guidance, shared their work experiences with me, but more than anything else encouraged 
me to go to college because they said we’d hope we were here forever, but the plant wasn’t there 
forever. So, those men gave me sound advice.  
 
I think we have a quotation in this museum: when people saw the plant, they thought it will 
last forever. And it was a sad day in August of 1982, when it closed. We were slowly lowering 
production, we got rid of producing white gray cement and only produced white cement. So, it 
was uneconomical to run the plant just with one kiln. So, it was a sad day when the plant close.  
VP:  
So, what did you do in the different shifts? How did the jobs themselves vary based on the 
shifts? 
EP:  
First of all, interesting. My wage was $2.02 per hour. That wage allowed me to pay my 
tuition to Kutztown State Teachers College. Just to give you a comparison of the past and present. 
I held many jobs. I was usually a helper to a skilled employee. I was a grinderman helper. Today, 
when you visit a cement plant, there are no grindermen, there are no help because it’s done from 
a central control station by one individual. I also worked in the kiln building. Winter temperature 
exceeded one 130-40 degrees. You spend the night drinking a lot of water, so you didn’t suffer 
[de]hydration. You didn’t have an appetite. And it killed building because the heat was so intense. 
But you did get accustomed to the heat. I also worked in the pump house because the Atlas plant 
was one of few plants that was a wet plant. They mix water with the stone and used a filtration 
process which today is so uneconomical, there is no white cement plant and all the plants around 
here are dry. They don't use water in their procedure like we did. So that's one of the reasons we 
closed – our energy costs was too high. So, we had to close because of this factor. Of course, the 
 
 
3 
 
site where the Atlas plant was is presently a co-generation plant where they generate electricity 
from waste coal. So, it's been a brown site that was reinvented and is again used for the public 
good, really, providing electricity to our customers.  
I had many good foremen, they respected the young people who were going to college, 
even to the present day, some of the best employers I ever had were the foremen from the cement 
plant. Many workers didn’t have a high school education. They admired people with an education 
and you are doing to find that out in your interviews. I mean, most these cement workers that I 
worked with, I said a long time ago, they were all first-generation Americans. They came from 
Europe and they worked in the cement plants. Most went to school. If they did six years maybe, to 
learn English and the American way. Most had a difficult time with English, but the cement plants 
to me were always the laboratories of democracy. You brought in Germans, you brought in the 
Polish, you brought in Croatians, Austrians. They couldn't speak English, but by communicating 
with the men in the plant, they learned in English and they were Americanized. So, we really never 
had any conflict here with all these ethnic groups because we had all these nationalities. And as a 
result, many different churches came and were built in our community. Practically all these 
churches are still there today. Unfortunately, churches don't have the attendance they had in the 
past. But all these many of these churches have their roots in the cement industry coming to 
Northampton because many churches were founded in 1896, 1894, and 1895. And that that was in 
Northampton, started at 1895. So, you can see with all these people coming to the area, they 
brought their customs and they brought their religions. And these churches are legacies of those 
immigrants. So, cement molded this town, it gave us our name.  
VP:  
Tell me more! 
[00:11:11] 
EP:  
Northampton has a fabulous history. Northampton goes back to before the American 
Revolution. You might interview cement workers throughout the United States, but very few have 
a history like we have in the Lehigh Valley. We had one of the first settlements in our area was 
1727. That's a long time ago. And of course, we experienced the French and Indian War. And the 
example of the French and Indian war is on the mural. We have a block house in Northampton that 
was built during the French and Indian War 1756-63 to protect settlers. Some of the first soldiers 
in the United States of America came from here. They were called to Northampton militia. One of 
the main militia men was Colonel John Sigfried. Colonel John Sigfried was a personal friend of 
George Washington. We have letters. We have correspondence between General Washington and 
Colonel Sigfried in Washington and his letters. “Respectfully yours. You’re serving George 
Washington.” Quite different from the atmosphere we face maybe in the present day, but there was 
a compactness, there was a common goal – independence of America. So, the first two soldiers 
came from here. They were Scotch, Irish and they were joined by Germans. And these men fought 
in battles that are in history books: Battle of Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown. My mammoth, 
these are in the US history books. And these men here fought those battles and they are the 
descendants of the men who built this community. 
VP:  
So why did the cement industry start in Northampton here? 
 
 
4 
 
EP:  
Another interesting point. Our community also played a big role in the Civil War. We had 
men again, we had men fight at Gettysburg. We have a chance at Fredricksburg. One of the soldiers 
in that war was Theodore Hall. He's our most famous Civil War veteran and he owned a large plot 
of land here in Northampton, hundreds of acres. Well, after in the 1820s, we started to build canals. 
So primitive cement plants were formed in 1825, 1826, 1827 along the Lehigh River. We had an 
important canal, Lehigh Cold Colden Navigation Canal, linking the coal regions to Philadelphia. 
And the boats, of course, took the coal down, so planned it in the 1870s with a railroad system. 
Now, construction started to take place. The cement that was first used was primitive cement called 
hydraulic. I won’t go into the chemical formula. And much of the cement was brought from 
England, which we trace here in this museum. Well, all of a sudden we realized we had the material 
in the Lehigh Valley necessary to make cement. Calcium carbonate is one of the main ingredients 
in cement itself. It's a basically a limestone, an impure limestone because there's other additives. 
What we found is Jacksonberg vain, there’s a vein of cement going through this area called 
Jacksonberg. It's one of the richest veins of cement rock in the world where we were sitting on this 
cement rock. So, men like David Saler realize that this was important. So, in the 1860s, he built 
plants in Copley along the Lehigh River. And he made – remember some cement was made before 
David Saler, but it was called hydraulic cement. It didn't have the strength and durability of what 
Saler had. So Saler developed a Portland cement, which is the cement using the same material, but 
you’re burning the ingredients at a high temperature, 22-23,000 degrees. Twenty two, twenty three 
hundred degrees. And the chemical reaction takes place in this cement, in this rock called forming 
clinker, which is the product of cement wholesaler, to come up with this technique. And he went 
to the US Pantanal office in 1866, he received a patent for Portland Cement in America.  
Well, because cement was becoming so popular, a man named Jose Navarro came from 
Spain as a young man. He was in Cuba and then he came to New York City and he heard that the 
cement industry was blossoming in a place called the Lehigh Valley. So, he came to the Lehigh 
Valley, he built a small place in Copley, which I have on a photo in this museum. But he ran out 
of materials here. Here’s where Theodor Howel comes it, the Civil War veteran. Novarro comes 
to Northampton, he meets with Theodor Howel. And he said, “I'd like to purchase a couple hundred 
acres of land for you to buy from you to build cement plants.” So, Theodor Howel, a Civil War 
veteran who basically knew nothing about this cement made the transaction that enabled and 
Pennsylvania for years to become the cement capital world. He sold that land to José Navarro and 
José Navarro immediately build three plants here. First was built in 1895, the last in 1905. He built 
three plants, called plant two, three and four. They were the largest cement complex in the world. 
If you do research, the largest in the world employs close to 5,000 people. I was fortunate to 
interview men who knew José Navarro. José Navarro came here for a funeral of one of the 
accountants I interviewed his son. José Navarro came to Northampton. He even had a telegraph 
system here so he could communicate with his office in New York, but it was amazing, you know, 
what transpired here? Well, he built these three plants, but he needed employees. Here is where a 
lot of my research comes in. 
 
[00:19:08]

The Atlas sent and all cement plants sent agents to Europe, in some cases, whole villages 
left. There's a man on this mural, there’s a quotation by Steve Janni, Steve Janni came from Austria, 
Hungary. The village had about 70 people. They were enticed to come to Copley and Northampton 
because there were cement plant jobs, the whole village left. And you’ll say, what about the 
women? The women worked in cigar factories because cigars were made by hand. Hundreds of 
women in this area worked in cigar factories. It's hard to believe to some of the buildings still 
stand, but younger people don’t realize it. So, the men worked at the cement plant, the women 
worked at the at the cigar factories. Well, what was interesting also we hear the quotation, 
“America has streets lined with gold.” It might be a fantasy, but they did have streets lined in gold 
because when these people got off the train, there were men there with suits on and ledgers and 
interpreters and they said, “we have the job for you, John. Sign here, Will.” “I couldn't sign. I made 
a mark.” “And we have a home for you! Mrs. Moore speaks Austrian. She has a boarding house 
for you and then you can bring your wife over later on.” So, we had borders. You don't hear that 
term often anymore. We had borders all over Northampton, and there’s quotations. I interviewed 
people who own the homes where their parents acted as the landlords. And I interviewed men who 
were boarders at these different places until they could bring their families over. So, America was 
a country of opportunity. There is no question about it. It was just amazing, they tell me when the 
train would stop here down in Northampton because people had tags on here, they had tags on 
their shirts Northampton, Pennsylvania because they couldn't speak, but the conductors would 
leave them off.  
VP:  
So, how did they learn how to do their job? 
EP:  
Good question, most of the jobs are manual, most of the jobs are manual, men were 
shoveling stone, they were loading stone on cars, they were working in the quarry, they were 
blasting. They had equipment that is totally obsolete today. And that equipment needed manpower 
because you had to feed a lot of this stuff manually. Today, you got conveyor belts, you got this 
and that. To give you a point, we had 400 horses, so you had to have people taking care of the 
horses, you had to take care of the farms.  
VP: 
What were the horses for?  
[00:22:00] 
EP: 
Horses were used in the quarry to pull out the stone used to take the dynamite in the stone 
into the quarry, used to haul the cinders from the boiler houses to dumps outside of the plant. So, 
the horses, the horses had names: Elias, Gabriel. Most of them were named saintly horses. And we 
actually had eight farms and we had men whose job was only to take their horses. And we had 
farmers here because we needed grain, we needed corn, they needed care. Some say the horses 
were taking better care of it than some people took care of family. I don't know if that's true, but 
that was a theme that they used to kid each other because they didn't want the horses to die and 
needed these horses. I interviewed men who saw boxcars of horses come to Northampton and the 
horses and the train stopped at the Siegfried Station on West 23rd Street. They were released from 
the boxcars and they were herded out this 21st Street to the Atlas twenty first street to the atlas 
because it was in [unclear]. I'll give you a human story: when the first shipment came in, because 
 
 
6 
 
there were a shipment made at 12-13 boxcars, they would take a horse to a hotel along the way. 
The horse would stand outside, a man would go inside and get a glass or pitcher of beer and baptize 
the horse so he would have a long, healthy, successful career. I actually spoke to people who did 
this and witness this. So, you can see the stories that these men have related to me are amazing. 
And I was fortunate to interview three men who actually packed cement for the Panama Canal. I'm 
talking 1898 and they remember vividly how the cement was packed.  
And you asked about labor. Well, the boxcars were loaded by hand! Each boxcar had about 
1,500 bags. There were no conveyers, men wheeled them in and in each boxcar there were two 
throwers. They would stack the bags 12 feet high. The bags weigh 94 pounds. So, men had to 
throw them up. Initially, cement was in barrels and the barrels were 376 pounds. Those had to be 
rolled on the cars. So, that was labor intensive. It didn't take a lot of education to do these jobs that 
I'm describing. Now, eventually these men were taught the more technical jobs. But the word 
technical is a misnomer in those days compared to today.  
VP: 
So, that is a new thing. So, how many men have you interviewed?  
[00:25:58] 
EP: 
Well, I currently have interviewed about 250 men in recent years as cement workers of the 
month because we honor cement workers a month from each of the companies from, of course, 
Lafarge, Keystone, Lehigh Heidelberg, Hercules, which is now Buzzi Unicem. And did I miss 
any? [Sally Ann offers input] Well, that's Lehigh Heidelberg. So, I just want to OK, OK, I want to 
be sure I get this right. There's Lafarge, Keystone, Lehigh Heidelberg and Buzzi Unicem Hercules. 
See, there was a company Essroc, a lot of these companies emerge and get sold.  
Now here's a fact for you guys, here's a fact for your listeners. At one time over the years, 
we've had 30 companies here in 60 plants, there are 60 plants here in our history! Because many 
plants companies had 3-4 plants running. Well, we eventually had five plants, Atlas had five. And 
of course, I've used this in my talks when people question me. If I lived in Northampton in 1920 
when my father came over, I could walk to ten cement plants. There's no other place in the United 
States where that this had happen. I live in Northampton. I walk on to the Atlas [unclear] that plant 
two, three and four. That's three. I walk across the cement and bridge to Whitehall's – four. I walk 
to Copley David Sailors' Boys – five. I go to McArthur Road, Lehigh Portland – six. I go to Egypt. 
American Cement had two. I go to Amron, which is a block mile away from Egypt, they had three. 
So, I’m over ten already. You could walk to these places and people actually walked, went by 
horse wagons and later by train because I've interviewed people who've done all they've walked, 
they've gone on a train and they were able to save enough money to buy a car, a model, a car. They 
were able to buy a model, a Ford. And guys chipped in so they could put gas in it. So, you can see 
it. These are lifetime experiences that will never be duplicated again.  
So, these men had to be hardy. Remember, there's no 40 hour week right there.  
VP: 
How many were there? How many hours were people working? 
 
 
 
7 
 
[00:29:15] 
EP: 
Initially, we're talking seven days a week. We're talking ten to twelve hours a day, seven 
days a week. Here's a story for you. A gentleman wanted to get married. He asked for a day off to 
get married on his Saturday. The foreman said to him, “Well, we'll give you a half a day. You can 
come to work in the afternoon.” Of course, they gave them a day without pay. Now we have 
different wage in this museum. I checked the wages of cement workers. Well, in the 1920s, people 
were lucky to take home as little as 1-1,100 dollars a year. And in this museum you'll see, well 
you look at the paycheck and you look at the hours and they didn’t amount to very much per hour. 
Remember, there were no unions. The cement plans have their own insurance plans. The Atlas 
plant plan gives you a hundred dollars if you lose a leg. Now, that's below the ankle. If you lose a 
leg above the knee, that's one hundred and fifty. So, you can see they paid, they had an Atlas 
insurance program, which only paid as long as the insurance fund had the money in it because 
there was a slight deduction. It's not like Blue Cross and Blue Shield. There was a slight deduction. 
Well, if everybody was working, there was money in the fund. When times were slow and people 
were working. And if there was an accident, well, they just didn't get paid. That's paid one hundred 
dollars yet people lived and survived under these circumstances. How they did, it's amazing. You 
could see they were hardy, they were hardy, and they passed this heartiness on to their family, like 
my grandfather passed his work ethic to my father. And that took place. And even today, all if 
you're going to interview current cement workers, ask them how many of their family worked in 
the cement plants in the past, in many cases, father, son, grandson, it was a long, contiguous line 
of people. But of course, today we have very few employees. I mean, we don't have 5,000 cement 
workers in the Valley. We're lucky, probably to have around a thousand when you have quarry 
operations, they're earning very good money. They deserve it. But again, it's different type. The 
jobs aren't there because of mechanization, technological advancement. They're very safe, the 
cement plant, very, very safe. You can see in this museum all the safety equipment we have. We 
had blasts that killed numerous people. I researched the Sands Eddy plant that was Lehigh 
Portland. Thirty-one men died there simultaneously. We put a memorial up to these men, we had 
mentioned in the museum. And I traced some of these ancestors and I actually interviewed men 
who were there during the blast and recovered bodies because they had, you know, thirty-one. 
Some churches, some churches, they only could have three funerals at a time. So, they had three, 
four, four, two, three, four days of funerals. It was very, very sad. And they really didn't get very 
much money. I did study it. I forget the amount of money. It was less than a thousand dollars that 
families received. It was a pittance compared to the present day.  
VP: 
And so when you started working in the cement plant, was the situation better? 
EP: 
The situation was very good when I worked – two dollars and two cents an hour was very 
good money. I earn more as a cement worker than I did as a teacher. I started teaching – to make 
a comparison free for your listeners. I start, there's no complaints, because that's the way society 
was. I started as a teacher at 4,000 thousand dollars a year. That was 1958. I was earning more 
money as a cement worker because the rate had gone up by that time. So naturally I thought, well, 
this is foolish. I'll stay as a cement worker and retire from here with a pension and health benefits. 
Well, that didn't happen because plants closed. And I interviewed many men who were despondent 
 
 
8 
 
when the plants closed. And there are sad stories I could mention, but I don't want to mention how 
mentally men were depressed. You know, they talk about depression today. You had men who 
were fifty-three, fifty years, forty years old. They lost their jobs. They couldn't get an equal job. 
This worked on them mentally. It was a very, very sad situation. When these plans go, men were 
in tears to have a hard cement worker cry, that's really saying something because, you know, I 
interviewed these men who later had a real difficult time adjusting to other jobs.  
VP: 
What types of other jobs did they take?  
[00:35:05] 
EP: 
Well, basically, menial compared some ended up working at a dairy, well, then one of the 
biggest dairies around here closed. Some ended up at a linoleum plant. Then that closed. Bethlehem 
Steel were still hiring at 1980. They closed. So, there's been a big transformation, not only here 
but in the whole country as far as jobs. We had no warehouse distribution centers. Now today, the 
area is dotted with warehouse distribution centers. We never had to hospital care in the past that 
we have today. Health is one of the biggest employers in the Lehigh Valley, if not the biggest. 
Education is big, but even education is hurt because a lot of people are not going to college as they 
did in the past. Colleges are advertising for students on billboards, so you can see there has been a 
change in even a high school student today. A college education is not a guarantee of a job because 
I know teachers, men, and ladies with degrees who are working in unrelated fields, because they 
just can't get employment. But in my era, everybody was hiring.  
VP: 
And did lots of people work part time because you said you went to school and worked at 
the plant.  
EP: 
The cement companies were so good they hired usually sons and daughters because there 
are women who work in the office, the sons and daughters of workers, to help them pay college 
tuition. I did all this work because I thought they were they were like a benefactor. I appreciated 
that I got a college education because I worked at a cement plant. I worked alongside men who 
become engineers. One of the top professors at DeSales University now in Northampton, was a 
student of mine who is a cement worker, which he admires to the present day. Some of those boys 
became attorneys. I know some became physicians. So, they use that money for new careers. Not 
many would become cement workers because their parents had wisdom and wanted them to get a 
better education so they could pursue other careers, including myself. So that's why I've done all 
this work, because I appreciate it is my father loved his job. My father-in-law loved his job. My 
Godfather loved studies. Guys loved their work. It's hard to believe to people loved their jobs like 
these bad. If these men when my father would have coming home complaining and moaning, I 
would have never done this work.  
VP:  
Did they like the job because of the nature of the work or because they got to work together?  
[00:38:36] 
EP:  
They liked nature of work and they liked the camaraderie. There was camaraderie because, 
look, you had all these streets at once and of course, we intermarried, then. I married a 
Pennsylvania Dutch girl, proud to say.  
 
 
9 
 
VP: 
Also at the cement industry? 
EP: 
Yes, her father and uncles were, absolutely. 
VP: 
So, your families worked together? 
EP: 
 They did work together with different eras, different plans. See, my father-in-law, they 
worked during the twenties and thirties, my father started after the war because he was on the farm. 
VP: 
Did people talk about cement at home? 
EP: 
Oh my God, did they talk cement! Because, you know, I sit at home and like, my Godfather, 
my father we talk about. “Yeah, that broke down, that should have been fixed earlier, that we could 
have taken.” There was a, I don't know what people talk about their jobs like they did that time, 
but I witnessed and heard all this conversation. I mean, there was banter all day, “oh they liked 
this foreman, they liked this foreman. They bowling teams well looked at baseball teams. So there 
that camaraderie, there's good camaraderie and cement plants today. There's good comradery. 
You're going to see that because I've interviewed almost three hundred cement workers, but I could 
have interviewed a thousand people easily. 
SM: 
I think, what she might be getting at, like, how many people did you interview for the 
museum. I think its two separate things.  
EP: 
I don’t think I interviewed many people before I did this museum, but I've known cement 
workers my whole life and heard these conversations because, see, we are all kind of social clubs 
here. So, I hear it all these conversations. Well, then when I started. Oh, my God, I thought that at 
least a thousand. Well, I do write articles for the newspaper. I, let's say I attempt to, there's a 
Northampton press. Here's a good fact for you: our first newspaper was called the Cement News 
was a newspaper for the cement belt. It was a weekly and the editor was the head of the print shop 
at the Atlas, so he ran a paper and he ran the print shop. His name was Ed Royer. But anyway, the 
newspapers did contact me to write history, you know. Well, I've written droves of articles on 
cement workers. I must've written a thousand articles easy because I'm right for over 25 years. So, 
when I heard about this museum, the possibility of me getting funds to do this, then I immersed 
myself. 
VP:  
So you mentioned women also worked in these places. 
EP:  
Oh, yes, yes.  
VP:  
What types of jobs?  
[00:42:09] 
EP: 
OK. When you look at a cement plant sometime, you know you know, in fact, women were 
very, very important in early cement. They were very, very important. Probably certainly they 
worked in the offices. They were excellent in the offices. We have quotations here. I mean, they 
were upset if they missed one cent in their report. We actually interviewed people. But this is 
interesting. Cement plants had droves of women. We made the cloth bags in Northampton. We 
made the cloth bags in Northampton for all our Atlas Cement plants. Dozens and dozens of women 
 
 
10 
 
were making these bags, sewing them, cleaning them, printing them. And we do have pictures of 
this over. And of course, the office was loaded with women also because we didn't have the 
computers. I mean, we had to trust the typewriter, which I have there from the early offices. And 
so you can see women were involved in it. In recent years, women had worked in the plants. 
Women have been, I've interviewed women who had worked in the cement plants themselves. 
They can handle the technical aspects just as good as a male, in some cases better, because while 
I don't know, women, they're very conscientious of the women that I interviewed. Some worked 
in the laboratory, I know I interviewed some women. And of course, secretaries in the business 
office, in the materials handling office. So, the women did play a vital role. They still do. But 
remember, we have very few men and women in the industry, which is very unfortunate.  
VP:  
And so you mentioned there were lots of immigrant workers. Were there Black workers?  
[00:44:21] 
EP:  
We had a few Black workers in later years, a few. But in this area, we didn't have a large 
Black population at all. This basically was like the frontier at one time. So, we really didn’t. We 
had diversity in religions and ethnic backgrounds, but we didn't have. We had Portuguese, a lot of 
Portuguese. They worked up in Palmerton, in the zinc plant. We had a lot of Italians working in 
Salay up at Rosetto. We had a lot of Welshman up there in Bangor in Slate. So, we did, but we 
didn't have a large Afro-American population. No, we did not. We had a few African-American 
men, they worked here. I know when one fella died, men made a collection so he would be buried 
properly. But we didn't have an abundance. 
VP:   And you mentioned things have changed a lot, and in terms of manufacture, I imagine that 
Northampton and other areas were pretty dusty from all the cement manufacture. 
EP:  
Real interesting. Very interesting.  
VP: 
Can you tell me more about that? 
EP: 
Very interesting. Well, we didn't have dust collectors. 
VP:  
Can you tell me what they do, what do dust collectors do?  
[00:45:48] 
EP: 
Well, they removed they removed the granules deeply rooted, they remove particles from 
the air, period. They remove them before they enter the stack and they're collected in large nylon 
bags. And some of it's now recycled. They take it, as they put it, right back in. Plants are very clean 
compared to what they do because they're under EPA regulations. All the cement plants today have 
monitors on their stack. So, they're monitored 24 hours a day. You don't have to have a technician 
there. These are recorded and it records exactly what's happening. 
VP:  
How were they recorded before the monitors? 
EP:  
Well, before there were monitors, before men came to the plant and they checked different 
things. They used primitive instruments compared to what we have today. So, we had dust. Well, 
very interesting. Some first cement plants had no dust collectors. We know that. Steel plants had 
 
 
11 
 
nothing. We were dusty, dusty community, but very interesting. During the Depression, the plants 
close. We were three months a year. All of a sudden, they get some orders because now the WPA 
comes in, now we're going to start building bridges, Works Progress Administration. Plants are 
running a little longer, so the headline in the cement news is “plants in operation.” If its dust, they 
basically say it's dust, we're happy for the dust. The headline basically said “We're happy for the 
dust.” You wouldn't hear that today. I mean, you'd be closed on. They were happy for the dust 
because they accepted the dust as part of your life. The coal miners, accepted the black lung for 
years. And years ago, the ladies would sweep off the sidewalks every day or two because you had 
to dust. We saw it, I think my daughter saw it to a small extent. 
SM: 
I always wondered, we didn't have a garage at our house, so we rented the garage next 
door. And I could never figure out, what was the big deal? That you had to put your car in the 
garage. Well, you had to put your car in the garage because it was cement dust and if it rained, 
well, that’s a problem.  
EP: 
So, you see, gradually, you know, as time change and technology was developed, then they 
started putting dust collectors. One of the most famous companies was the Fuller Company in 
Catasauqua. The Fuller Company was a famous, famous company. And they were one of the first 
companies to make dust collectors. Because I was there, I was there when they put up that one dust 
collector in the 1950s, you know, it was a building with big bags on that sifted the dust out before 
it went into the stack. It was amazing because, you know, years ago, if some dust would come out, 
people would say “that’s not dust, that’s smoke.” Because you had all these families working, you 
couldn't get people go to a meeting and petition to close a plant. I mean, that was unheard of. And 
to get back, Northampton was named by a cement plant. Do you think these people are going to 
call for the plant to close? Our name at one time was Alliance, Pennsylvania. 1902. Well, we had 
so much mail and so many clubbish cement bags because cloth bags were recycled before that 
word was popular. There was recycling and people didn't realize it. When bags were used on the 
job, they were sent back and you got ten or fifteen cents for the bag. And of course we were getting 
thousands of bags back here and they were ending up in the [unclear] ending up at different places. 
So our company was so powerful, it went to council in Northampton County Court and said we'd 
like to change the name from Alliance to Northampton, Pennsylvania, and it passed. You couldn't 
do that today, it would take four acts of Congress! 
VP: 
So, what are the bags used for? 
EP: 
We packed the cement in bags. Because you see, it was bags because you didn’t have the 
bulk cement cars and trucks like now.  
VP: 
So, you said they were recycled.  
[00:50:57] 
EP:  
Yeah, they were recycled. They were brought back and used again. They were used and 
used again. So again, you had people if there was holes in them, you had the women repairing the 
bags. We have bags in here that are 120 years old and they're still good. And of course, the bags 
had other uses. If the bag was too old, the lady took it home and she made a bed sheet and she 
 
 
12 
 
made a towel and she made a blanket. People today might be horrified to hear that, but people used 
everything possible. I have a tablecloth made out of cement bags, which I have for a display. I 
have bags that were knitted and embroidered and used as place settings on tables and bureau. You 
wouldn't think of doing that today, but we did it because that was the way life was.  
VP: 
So, you have such a rich collection of material in the museum.  
EP: 
Yes.  
VP:  
How did you go about gathering all these things? And how did the idea for the museum 
start? 
[00:52:17] 
EP:  
Well, as a teacher, I and Mr. Firestone, who was the art teacher at the high school, I decided 
the high school needed a display of its history because it's located on the Atlas site. So, Mr. 
Firestone and I gathered photographs, artifacts and put a 40 foot paneled glass display into senior 
high school. Its right there, right, Mrs. Madden? It has been taken care of, it hasn’t, knock on wood, 
been abused by the kids. Honest to goodness. And it's there for many, many years. OK, well, then 
Northampton Generating Company came here and they said, well, Mr. Panny, we would like to 
build a generating plant on the Atlas site. Would you help us? I'm a teacher, remember. They came 
to see me in my classroom. I said, “yes, gentlemen, I will help you if you meet environmental 
standards.” So, I say, “please take me to some of your operations.” So, I went up to up to the coal 
regions of Pennsylvania, I went to a couple of communities. One was up in Shenandoah, I recall. 
I forget where the other place was. Gilberton, yeah. I went to these plants and they were passing 
all kind of rules and regulations because they were burning waste coal, which was being laid there 
and the acid was seeping into streams. So, they figured this is environmentally sound, OK, so, they 
came to north and they said, would you speak for me them? I said, “yes, I will speak for you. If 
you promise to recycle a building on this site, make a museum.” They say “we'll do it.” Now, I did 
speak in front of council and that plant has been there for over twenty years, is that right, Sal? So, 
yes, I spoke in council. It was packed. It was passed unanimously. There were a couple people 
who opposed it, but a number of people did speak to me. I, I felt very good. They said, “Mr. Pany, 
we don't totally agree with you, but we respect you.” I said, you got a site which is, today they call 
it brownfield. I said, this is a brownfield. They'll put in a plant here, they'll pay taxes and they'll 
provide employment. And of course, this is what they did. Well, they couldn't use one of the Atlas 
buildings for a museum because of asbestos and lead. So, they were gracious to give me a grant to 
build this museum almost 25 years ago. The museum, I'm proud to say, cost the taxpayers nothing. 
And it's manned by my daughter, Mr. Oberly. Mr. Yurish, borough manager, Mr. Bropst. It's 
monitored by us. We're not compensated for anything we do. So, this museum is free to the 
community and the only cement museum in the United States visited by men as far as People's 
Republic of China, Korea, Philippines had them all here because all of them have roots and 
connections to our cement plants because these cement plants are international. So, you know, it's 
been nice just to see all these people come here and respect what we did, including yourself. 
VP:  
Can you describe the different exhibitions?  
 
 
13 
 
EP:  
The museum starts with the beginning of cement. It's hard to believe, but if you look at the 
great pyramids of Giza, that's not cement, of course, but there's primitive burnt limestone between 
those big blocks. And of course, later on, we know what the Romans were some of the greatest 
builders in the world, the Colosseum is the proof. They use a lot of volcanic ash because it's burned 
at such a high temperature. You get a chemical reaction similar to burning clinker. OK, then it 
started to be made in Europe. It was commercialized in Europe, especially in England. There was 
a John Aspen in England, there were a number of other guys who developed cement in England. 
Of course, then it came to the United States. 
VP:  
I see you have photographs of that plant, the two, three, four.  
EP:  
Yes, yes. And of course, plant four is the generating plant, plant two and four and the 
generating plants. So, many other areas end up as housing. You know, people don't realize and we 
have some pillars of the old plant in these housing developments because they don't realize the 
heritage of our community. So, you see cement, we have a banner near “Northampton, the Home 
of Cement.” It was the binding force, the first telephone system was at the Atlas, one of the first 
fire companies was at the Atlas because it was so big, they could do these things.  
SM: 
Like, the switch for the lady whose father ran that switchboard is still alive today. She 
comes every year a little picture on my phone. She comes and she sits at the switchboard every 
year, even with the fire equipment, like this fire equipment on one side. And the borough took care 
of it and kept it active for us, so we have it in the museum, so. Things were items that people had 
or collected over the years, the bell that is on the telephone every day, that bell matches with a 
photo of a train that came in and out of the [unclear] railroad to the Atlas. So, people were amazing, 
they still drop things off. [unclear] The dynamite blaster, the kids love the dynamite blaster. The 
horse was the only thing that was actually purchased, but we did not purchased it; a local attorney 
in town purchased that for us, the museum, because it is original model for a harness maker to 
make harnesses in town, not just for the Atlas but for the community. And that course was the 
harness maker shop. And so, someone was kind enough to purchase that and donate it to the 
museum.  
EP: 
Many of the items are over 100 years old, including that horse. So they're irreplaceable and 
valuable, but they give you a feel. You see a horse, you say “a cement plant? Why would you have 
a horse?” So, you immediately get the interest of people when they see the horse. 
VP:  
So, in addition to other workers from other countries, you have lots of students who come 
in, there are these thank you notes and letters. So, can you tell me a little bit about how you work 
with local schools?  
EP:  
That's very good, please interject, Mrs. Madden, please interject like you did. We got the 
idea that our students should see this museum and learn their cement heritage. One of the great 
gaps in the history of our country is local history. Most communities, the residents know nothing 
about the history, origins or community. We live in a busy society, so we take it for granted. Being 
cement was the binding force, named us, named our football team, named everything. We said, 
“well, we're going to try to get the students here to the museum.” The administration was very 
cooperative. Those teachers were cooperative. The parents were cooperative because many of 
 
 
14 
 
them were way back to an earlier era when so their neighbors, somebody was in cement. So, all 
students from the Northampton School District visit this at least once during their career. All fifth 
graders visit this museum and that’s close to a 1,000 right there. Then, of course, we have a cement 
day at the middle school where we got 1,300 students and have representatives from the cement 
plants come in, give a program on their industry, and the kids could ask questions. But the thing I 
think we're most proud of, Sally, is the middle school, which you have seen, Miss. I mean, we had 
such a wonderful outpouring of interest in our heritage that the school board and administration 
decided they would name every hall in the museum, in the new middle school after a cement plant. 
There is no school in the United States that has halls named after cement plant. If there is, I'd like 
to know where. So, you have visitors coming in and said, “well, what do you mean, Giant? What 
do you mean Bath, Portland?” These are all places that were cement plants that are gone. So, we 
don't only remember to five current, we remember them all. So, that's been you know, that's been 
a thrill to see that. And Mr. Kovalchuk, our good superintendent, by the way, his father worked in 
two of these cement plants and his whole family has a heritage in the cement block. And school 
board members have heritage in a cement plant. So, what helped us educate the people is we had 
willing people in our borough council, our school board and our administration and teachers that 
work with us, which is phenomenal nowadays. And, knock on wood, I mean, it's been smooth, 
right, Mrs. Madden? For what? For like 20 some years? Twenty five years we’re doing this.  
SM: 
And the mural has been a really important teaching tool. And that’s where the students 
come in, and they sit, and they start and teach with the mural. And take it from there.  
[01:04:31] 
EP: 
We also pack a lunch for students, a lunch similar to what a cement worker would have. 
We have the original, which we have the original lunch boxes. That box is 100 years old. And 
what we do, we put in lard because people actually use lard on sandwiches. We actually even put 
in moldy bread to show students nothing was thrown away because you didn't have preservatives. 
And then they scrape the mold off and people put some more on. We have sardines for them, we 
have pork rinds, which they called. What did they call them here to add a name for? I've cracklings. 
They call pork crackling. They're pieces of skin from hogs, which people used to eat. So, we bring 
these, we bring molasses. We show the kids this. And they're amazed because, you know, they 
complain about their food in the cafeteria. They say, hey, guys, look what we have. We have no 
cakes in here. I mean, we have a basic lunch and we have black coffee. I say we have no cream. 
So, all the kids are fascinated by this lunch. It's a big hit the minute you show them the lunch and 
you got your attention because they've never seen anything like that. People don't carry a lunch if 
they have a cafeteria. So, you know, you've got the kids on your side.  
VP: 
I’m hungry now.  
EP: 
Sure, you’re hungry! Sure, you’re hungry!  
VP:  
Well, is there anything else that maybe we haven't covered that you would like to mention 
or talk about? 
EP:  
Well, Mrs. Madden, do you have any suggestions?  
 
 
15 
 
SM: 
And looking at the displays. I would also say just community wise, not necessarily the 
[unclear] Atlas. But there's a community display over on the far wall and you know, if you look at 
the floats, they're all like cement floats. If you look at the baseball team, if you look at the display 
for the hospital, the hospital right now houses the school district administration building and there 
were two hospitals in town. And those were all, you know, they would take care of the cement 
workers. That was like everything revolved around the cement industry in the community.  
EP: 
Our athletic team is called the Koncrete Kinds. That’s the most unique. It was in USA 
Today one time. It was like second or third. Honest to goodness as so being so unique. But it’s 
because it’s cement heritage.  
VP: 
But it’s because all the work you have been doing at the museum and beyond.  
EP: 
Oh, absolutely. But, you know, it's been a joy to do this. I mean, I wouldn't have done this 
if I wouldn't have got response. And even today, this man knows people call me continuously with 
artifacts and articles they would like me to pursue, but I just can't do it anymore to do all this. But 
people come to my home and I just recently, a lady, a lady who has a cement heritage, traced her 
family back to pre-American Revolution. And I said, well, I'll gladly do the story. I said, please 
write a capsule. So, she wrote about her relatives who fought in the Revolutionary War and 
whatnot. And then, of course, I picked it up and I did a story on this family and their role in the 
Revolutionary War. So, again, we have a deep history here, which a lot of states wouldn't have 
because we're an original thirteen state. The great state of Virginia would have it, you know, I 
mean, they would have in Massachusetts, in New England. But when you look at the rest of the 
United States, it didn't exist. So, we laid the foundation. You know, Benjamin Franklin, by the 
way, probably the greatest Pennsylvanian who ever lived. 
VP: 
The vey literal foundation.  
EP: 
Yes, I mean he was just he was he was a Renaissance man. He was he was a man of humble 
background who had interest in the Public Library of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania. 
He came to this area. Benjamin Franklin came within a couple feet of this museum during the 
French and Indian War. And this is not fantasy, this has been documented. I mean, he came here 
to set up a system of force during the French and Indian War and set up a post system here. 
VP:  
And it’s so amazing how the museum connects. 
EP:  
Should we connect. Sure, we connect. And I'm sure we reconnect. So I'm sure I connect it 
to the Civil War, Theodore Hall. 
VP:  
How amazing.  
EP:  
It is an amazing story here. I've you you've come to the right place. You can go to other 
cement plants and they all has an interesting history. But we really go back farther than anybody. 
Yeah. 
VP:  
Thank you for doing this work and for chatting. 
EP:  
Well, it's a pleasure. I hope we gave you I could give you a hundred stories. 
 
 
16 
 
VP:  
And to be continued, you will have to schedule another interview. 
EP:  
I think I'll give you one of my stories yet. This is a fascinating story. And this came from 
a retired man from Lafarge Hanses. I don't know if he's still living or not. This was amazing story. 
I've written this story. They came from Austria-Hungary, and his great great grandfather was sent 
to cement plant in Hannibal, Missouri. I was there, by the way. Atlas had plants on the Hannibal, 
Missouri, on the Mississippi because of shipping. OK, so he shipped to Hannibal, Missouri, 
immigrant, very little education. The only entertainment they had was playing cards. So, there was 
a shutdown and they said, “let's go to St. Louis.” So, somehow these boys went to St. Louis, 
Missouri. Oh, my God. The big city, immigrant boys, big city. They walked down the street in St. 
Louis and there’s droves the saloons, right? They called them saloons. So, they go into a saloon. 
A bunch of people are playing cards and they sat in two empty chair. “Boys, would you like to 
play cards? So they sat up because they could play cobra, these guys. This game went on for almost 
like two o'clock in the morning. During the game, one of the men quoted Shakespeare and he 
looked like he was in port. Like all everybody who played with him knew him. So, the game is 
over. The boys get up. I think it was called the Standard Saloon. The boys up, a couple of men at 
the table, they say “boys, you're lucky that you're leaving with any money in your pocket.” “What 
do you mean?” “Do you know who was playing cards against you?” No. “It was Frank Alexander 
James, the brother of Jesse James.” Amazing story. I and my wife went to Quiney, Missouri, 
ourselves, to the home of Frank and Jesse James. And I was surprised that a lot of visitors there, 
even from England, because I researched this whole Jesse James thing, which I and my daughter 
researched it and gave talks on it. But I thought that's a nice sidelight for you. 
VP:  
Thank you. Yeah, that's a really lovely way to wrap it up. 
EP:  
Thank you so much for your time, your work.
