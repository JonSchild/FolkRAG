Worked all summer long, I didn't save my railroad fare, Hum... um... um... Worked all
summer long, I didn't save my railroad fare. I ain't got no money, And my friends they don't
even care.
Oh my dear mother, She prayed this prayer for me; My dear mother, She prayed this
prayer for me. She said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, Wheresoever he may be.'
