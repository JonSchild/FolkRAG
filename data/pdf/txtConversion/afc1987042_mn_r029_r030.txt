TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER IN MID-SENTENCE:  Ann Marie Dion?  
A:  That's correct.  [I:  Is that (--) Okay.]  A hmm.
I:  Uh, we're at St. Louis School.  Is this the school?  
A:  Yes, this is the school cafeteria.  The academy is upstairs.  [I:  Oh!  Alright.  And the rectory 
is on the other side of the church?]  Right, uh hmm.  [I:  That's a big church.]  Yeah!  It sure is.  
[I:  I was banging on all the doors]  Oh really?  [I:  This is not the rectory, this is not the school.  I
didn't know where I was.]  Yup.
I:  I'm going to talk to you about the bingo, but before I get to the bingo [A:  Sure.] I thought 
maybe I would ask you something about yourself and your family and where you live in Lowell. 
Where do you live in Lowell?
A:  I live here in Centraville.  [I:  In Centraville?]  Yeah, It's about two blocks up.  [I:  Okay, on 
West 6th Street?]  No, I live on Farmland Road, it's off of Lakeview Avenue.  [I:  Oh, all right.  
Okay.]
I:  And do you know how your family came to, arrived in Lowell?  How they got here?
A:  Uh, I don't know.  Uh, my father was brought up here in Lowell,  because he came from 
Little Canada.  Uh, my mother was born here in Lowell, uh, in the home we are living in now.  
Uh, how my grandparents got here though, I couldn't tell you.  I really do not know.  [I:  Are they
from Canada?]  Yes, they are.  A hmm.  My father's family is mainly from Maine, but my 
mother's family is from Canada.  I do have relatives up there still.  [I:  And they would have been
from French speaking Canada?]  Yes.  A hmm.  [I:  So, anyway, you know that it was your 
father's parents that came to Lowell.]  Right!  [I:  And your mother's parents.]   Right!  
I:  Did they ever tell you why they came down?  
A:  No, no.  And I don't have any grandparents living any longer, so.  
I:  [UNCLEAR]  Did they work in the Mills?
A:  My grandfather owned a store here.  Uh, a variety store.  It's now a florists down the corner 
over here.  [I:  In Centraville?]  Yes.  It's "Kenwood Florists" now, but it use to be "Bob's 
Market".  And he use to own and run that store.  [I:  This is your father's father?]  My mother's 
father.  [I:  Oh, mother's father.  Sorry.]  My father's father, I really have no idea.  I don't even 
know him.  [I:  Yeah!]  So, cause he died when I was quite young, so, I really never got to know 
him.  [I:  Yeah.  That's the same with my father's father.]  Yeah!  [I:  In fact, my father's father 
died before I was even born.]  Really, wow!  So that's what happen with my sister.  She was born 
at 1:00 in the afternoon and my grandfather had died at 10:00 that morning.  [I:  Oh my god!]  
Yeah!  [I:  Oh, that's so unusual, the same day.]  Yup.  [I:  So they had a little store here?]  Right! 
[I:  What part of (--)  Does this have a name, this part of Centraville?]  This is Centraville, just 
Centraville.  [I:  This isn't Little Canada?]  No it's not.  Little Canada is where the University 
campus is now.  That use to be all Little Canada, but that's all been knocked down and 
demolished.  Then those cement buildings, apartments came in, [I:  Yeah!]  and that took all over 
Little Canada.  
I:  The part that we are in now, around the church, did that use to be, or is it still a french part of 
Centraville?
A:  Yes it is.  [I:  It still is?]  Yes, there's still quite a few people here that talk french still.  [I:  
Really?]  Oh yeah!  [I:  On the streets?]  Oh sure, oh sure.  We got quite a few families that that's 
all they talk is french.  And you'll here them.  Oh yeah!  There are a lot of elderly still around 
here, this section, and there all still very french.  You'll here them here at bingo.  [I:  Do some not
know English?]  No, they all know English.  They all do know English.  A hmm.  [I:  Do you 
speak french?]  Yes, I do.  
I:  Because I went to, uh, a French Canadian cookout last week.
A:  Oh really.  [I:  Uh, with Ray, uh, (--)]  [Boregon?]  [No, Patcan (--)] [UNCLEAR.]  [I:  He 
use to be (--)]  Yes, didn't he use to work at Union National, too?  Yeah, I know him.  I worked 
there with him for a while.  [I:  And Yvonne Lagasse.]  Oh, yup.  [I:  I practice a little of my 
french.]  [LAUGHING]  
I:  Was that the language?  Was that your first language at home?
A:  No, I talked English first.  I learned my French through school.  [I:  But both your parents 
know French?]  Uhmm.  Oh yeah.  [I:  So they spoke English at home?]  Yes.  [I:  And then what 
(--) If this is where you grew up, you would have gone to what school?]  I went here to St. Louis.
[I:  And what grades are there?]  I started only here at the third grade, because before we were 
living here, uh, when my mother had gotten married, naturally, she had moved and after having 
kids we ended up in Chelmsford.  So, we lived in Chelmsford for a while until my grandfather 
past away.  When he past away, my grandmother asked us to move in with her to keep her 
company, so she wouldn't be lonely.  So we moved back here to Centraville.  
I:  And that's when you started school?
A:  I school here in the third grade because I had already been in school for first and second at 
North Chelmsford.  [I:  And then how did they do the language at St. Louis?  Was it half the day 
in English and half the day in French?]  No, it was only a course, maybe an hour.  Yeah!  [I:  Oh, 
cause I thought in the old days (--)]  And they would switch (--)  Well know, because see, when 
we started school you only had one classroom, you know.  So, I mean, they would spend an hour 
in Spelling, and in English, an hour in Team Math, and an hour in Science, an hour in Religion, 
an hour in French, you know, so by time its recess and then you've gone home.
I:  But a classroom for each grade or everybody was together?
A:  A classroom for each grade, yup.  I think they (--)  My gosh your making me go back a long 
time here.  They had (--)  I'm going to say they had two classes of each grade.  And then when it 
got into junior high, which is 7th and 8th, they switched it off to four classes.  So you would 
switch classes.  So in other words we had four teachers in the 7th and 8th grade.  And we would 
switch and spend so many hours in each class.  [I:  How many grades in the school?]   There's 
eight in elementary and then there is four in the academy.  So it's full.  [I:  Did you go to the 
academy?]  No I did not, I went to Lowell High School.
I:  Now how come some kids go to the academy and some go to Lowell High?
A:  Uh, we'll say I had my fill with the nuns so I decided to pull out.  [I:  Cause a lot of people 
have told me they go to grammar school with the church and then Lowell High.]  I mean you end
up paying tuition, you know, after they come to the academy, where if I go to Lowell High I don't
have to pay a tuition.  And where I came from a family of seven, it was kind of hard to make my 
parents pay for us to all go to a public, I mean, parochial school or a paying high school.  [I:  Did
you have to pay for grammar school?]  Yes, we did.  But it was always given to you like at a rate.
Like there was seven of us in school, the first one paid one price, the second one had a lower 
price, the third one (--)   So like when we first started there was four of us and I believe the first 
three paid and the fourth one didn't have to.  [I:  That's because they wanted all of the families to 
go in.]  Sure, right.  [I:  Was it taught by nuns or lay teachers?]  I had all nuns when I first started,
but by the time I graduated they started having lay teachers.  [I:  Are there still nuns here at the 
rectory?]  Yes there are, there's (--) I want to say there's between 12 and 20 of them left.  But 
they're not all teaching either.  There's still (--) there is still quite a few lay teachers teaching here 
now.  [I:  But between 12 to 20 nuns still?]  Yeah, uhmm.  I know definitely there are 12, because
12 of the nuns, once school starts they come and give us a hand here at bingo.  From six o'clock 
to seven o'clock they come in and run the kitchen for us.  [I:  The nuns do?]  Yes.  [I:  Do they 
dress in their habits?]  In their habits, yes.  Some do, some don't.  It depends.  [I:  What order is 
that?]  Oh!  I knew you were going to say that.  [I:  [Laughing] It's not a trick question.  So if you
don't know it]  No, it's the Assumption of something.  [I:  I just asked that.]  I have no idea.  
I:  And then after you finished high school, did you stay in the Centraville area?  
A:  Yes I did.  Yeah!  I'm still living at home with my family.  [I:  And this is a question I ask 
people sometimes.  Have you gone in all the other parts of the city, or do you tend to stay around 
here?]  No, I think I basically stay here in the section of the city because I know it.  [I:  And what
would be the place that you sort of think of as your section?  Like kind of what streets?]  
Basically Centraville.  [I:  All of Centraville?]  Yeah, really.  [I:  So you might go up to the top of
Christian Hill or uh (--)]  Right, and I can go up by Gage, uh, Robinson School, because softball 
and Little League games are playing there all the time.  So I'm always up by there.  Uh, (--)  [I:  
Are you involved in the Little League Games?]  No, I just go and watch because my next door 
neighbor's is on a team, and a little boy that use to live upstairs from us is on a team.  So when 
they see me at the games they're glad that Ann is there to watch them and cheer them on.  So, 
when I know when they have a game, I try to make their games.  
I:  Are those the ones that I see in the evening?
A:  Yeah, right!  Their games start at, between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. their games start.  So by 8:00, 
8:30 they're finished.  [I:  And that's in the summer, too?]  They do, they still do have some 
games going on now, right now it's their play-offs.  So they're getting that (--).  [I:  The guys 
down at National Park are in their play offs too and they're all excited.]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I:  Are any of the masses in French at the church?
A:  We still have one mass left in French.  That's the ten o'clock mass on Sunday mornings.  [I:  
Is there a choir at that one?]  I've never really gone.  I do not believe there is one.  The only choir
that I know of was at the four o'clock mass, but last year they didn't have one.  They lost a 
conductor and there hasn't been anybody that's been wanted to volunteer to take over the 
position.  They still have people that want to sing, but there is nobody there to lead them.   So 
without a leader it's kind of difficult.  But then they have the 5:30 mass, they have folk, like a 
folk mass.  They have three girls, I should say two girls, then a sister that play the guitar.  And 
they do that mass.  [I:  That's Saturday night.]  Saturday evening, right.  Sunday morning, at the 
8:30 mass, which is mainly (--)  Well when I went to school it was always the mass for the 
children.  And they have, uh, an organist that plays at that mass.  Uh, my sister is one of the 
organists.  Uhmm, I don't (--) One time they may have had an organist playing at the 10:00, but 
I'm really not sure anymore.  I mean, like I said, I don't go into that one, so I'm not sure.  [I:  
Would it just be old people, or do all ages go to that?]  To the ten o'clock mass?  [I:  Yeah.]  Oh, 
anybody goes to (--)  Oh, its all ages that go to the mass, but as far as I'm concerned it's too late 
in the day for me to go.  I mean I want to go to either the seven o'clock in the morning, you know
what I mean?  [I:  Early, right?]  Yeah, right.  
I:  That's sort of nifty, young people learn french.
A:  Yes they do.  There still teaching it in this school.  [I:  Could you carry on a conversation 
with people?]  I can get by, it's very rusty, though.  [I:  Cause you don't use it, right?]  Right, 
right.  [I:  Do you use it with the people that come here?]  Uh, no, not that often.  No, not really.  
Not unless somebody wants to say something and they don't want others to hear them, you know,
like "don't tell somebody" and then they will start talking to me in french.  I used it quite a bit 
when I was working at the hospital, because I use to work at St. Joseph's.  I was there for 9 1/2 
years.  And I worked in the Emergency Department, and (--) [I:  What are you, a nurse?]  No I'm 
not.  I was the supervisor there and we took care of the registration.  And quite a few times we 
had french speaking woman come in, and they're just so nervous about their testing that it was 
just so much easier for them to talk french.  And rather than give the customer, the patient, a hard
time the girls would turn around and say "Ann this one's for you", you know.  So I would go over
there and take care of them for them.  You know my french is not very fluent, but they 
understood what I was trying to say and I think that was the main thing.  [I:  And you understood 
them.]  Right.  Oh, I can understand perfectly.  I can read perfectly.  My writing and my speaking
back is rusty.  [I:  UNCLEAR]  
I:  Would those necessarily be older people or (--)
A:  Oh, yeah, they were all older people.  All of them were older.  Over sixties. 
I:  What about (--)  The other thing I wanted to ask you was, this is a little of bingo, but do you 
belong to any clubs in Lowell, or groups?
A:  No.  [I:  Sidality, or (--)]  No, nothing.  Just here in the church.  That's all.  [I:  When you say 
here in the church, you mean?]  I'm involved with the Christmas fair, the Carousel, the Five 
Hundred Club, uh, the bingo, we have breakfast that will be starting back up in September.  Once
a month we put on a breakfast here in the cafeteria.  [I:  For?]  Anybody who is welcome to 
come.  [I:  Is that like a fund raiser or (--)]  Yes it is.  The money that we raise, we give it to the 
pastor and he gives it to one of the principles of the schools, either the academy's or the 
elementary.  And he gives it to them for whatever they need.  Uh, they bought a tv, they bought 
an antenna for a tv, they bought a VCR.  I mean it's all things that they need to help with the kids.
[I:  What are the other things?  The Five Hundred?]  The Five Hundred Club?  Uhmm, we have 
five hundred members.  Well we don't have five hundred members anymore, we've got about 
four hundred members, we've got (--) I think there's a hundred members there.  Yeah, I think that 
there is a hundred that, members that are available.  So we got like four hundred members all in a
club, they all have a number.  Once a month we draw a number.  The first prize is $1000, the 
second prize is $100, and then we give out three $50's.  So they can win $1200.50 each month.  
And it's $5.00 a month to join.  [I:  Is there a event, I mean do you all get together when you 
draw the numbers?]  Yes we do.  It's held on the last Sunday of every month.  So we meet here in
the cafeteria.  [I:  Do all four hundred come?]  No, no.  Uhm, I'll say thirty at the most come, and
it's always the same ones.  So it's always your regulars.  [I:  But the other people still pay $5.00?]
That's right, yeah, yup.  [I:  And do they have tea or something?]  Yeah, we have coffee and 
donuts, uh, but like I said, when September comes, we run the Five Hundred Club the same 
morning as our breakfast.  So, it like gathers them more and keeps them here for the drawing as 
well.  And with all the open numbers that we have we're able to sell a few of them.
I:  Open numbers?
A:  Yeah, we have (--) That board behind you, all those numbers are available numbers, people 
have either dropped out or we just haven't been able to resell them for their share.  [I:  Oh, so, 
like if I picked 255, that's my number throughout the year?]  That's correct, uhmm.  [I:  But if I 
just want to come in next month, I can.]  You can just pick one for that one month.  [I:  And give 
you five dollars for that number.]  Right.  [I:  Oh, all right.]  
I:  And what's the other club you said you were in?
A:  Oh, somebody's at the door.  [I:  Oh, okay, go ahead.]
I:  And you said there is a Christmas Bizzar too?
A:  Yes, that's usually held, I'll say, the first week of November, and it's here in the cafeteria.  
And we just set it all up for Christmas, and sell, and raffle, and everything else.  All kind of 
Christmas ideas for Christmas, for people to buy.  [I:  What do you sell?]  Uh, we have all kinds 
of novelties.  Uh, there's that wreath that you can see behind you, and there's all those boxes up 
above are craft items that we've got together here in the cafeteria.  And we try to get ideas from 
everybody and make up these things and we sell them off on the tables during the fair time.  [I:  
So people make stuff and bring it to you or you make the things?]  Both.  A lot of people will 
make it themselves at their home on their leisure time.  But when it comes time for the fair they 
will come over here and say "I would like to donate them for the fair".  Fine, we'll take it.  [I:  
So, mostly it's handmade things?]  Uh, no it's not.  We got maybe two tables that are handmade.  
All the rest it's either a raffle or they're games, or we got a sweet chart.  We have the kitchen that 
is open to sell food.  We got all kind of raffle tables.  So we got a drawing in that fair as well, and
that's a five hundred prize.  And then it's broken down, I can't remember what it is though.  Five 
hundred, a hundred, two $50's, two $25's, and I think ten $5's, something like that, or five $10's 
something like that.  [I:  Everybody chances.]  Yes, uhmm. 
I:  So when's that?
A:  The first week of November.  [I:  Oh, okay.]  
I:  Do you know if anybody does any handwork for the church, uh, lacework, or embroidery, or 
(--)  
A:  I have no idea.  [I:  That's not something that sounds familiar?]  Doesn't sound familiar to me 
at all, no.  We do have a lot of woman that knit and crochet, and they bring those, you know, 
they'll make us an afghan or something, and they'll bring for the  fair.  Uh, but I don't know about
any lace type work or embroidery type that I have never seen.  [I:  Okay, I just didn't know if 
they do anything that, you know, they might have learned from their mother's how to do some 
kind of handwork.  Doesn't have to be embroidery, but I guess (--)]  No, I only, like I say, I only 
know of knitting and crocheting, that's all I know of.  [I:  Yeah, yeah, okay.]
I:  And onto the bingo.  How did you get involved (--)  What do you do here first, I guess?  
A:  What do I do?  I mainly do all the paper work in the office.  That has to be reported to the 
state.  I got started by being a player, and I was 18 going on 19 at the time and it was in the 
summer.  It was July and the man that was running it at the time was like running around.  And I 
said "Do you need some help?"  He goes "why, would you really like to help me?"  I says "sure 
I'll help if you want me to help.".  So that's how I started and I've been here ever since.  I just 
celebrated my 14th year here.  [I:  Wow!]
I:  And how did you start coming to bingo?
A:  My mother.  My mother is a regular bingo fanatic we're going to call them.  [LAUGHING]  
Uh, you know, I had turned 18, and "Ann come on, lets go to bingo".  So sure I went to bingo, 
you know, it was fun.  I was very lucky being a player.  [I:  Oh you won?]  Oh yes, many times.  
[I:  Do you still play?]  No I don't.  No, I work.  I devote all my time running here.  But from 
when we open the doors setting up, getting the people in here, then after I do that we have paper 
strips that we have to sell, or lottery tickets that we want to gamble with, that I have to go on the 
floor to sell.  After that I come back into the office and I'm here at this desk till about 9:30 at 
night working on all papers that have to be turned into the state.  And they come and 
[UNCLEAR] every so many weeks, and make sure that all our paper and everything is in order.  
[I:  Oh, that your not (--)  Do you have to pay taxes on it?]  Yes we do.  [I:  Even though your a 
church?]  That's right.  [I:  So you have to report how much money that comes in?]  Yeah right, 
everything that comes in.  And we have to pay tax on everything that's taken in, not what's given 
out.  [I:  Oh, the gross.]  
I:  And then tell me what happens.  You come here at 3:30 (--)
A:  Yup, and I set up all the kitchen.  I have to get like the coffee going, the water going for the 
hot dogs, uh, get all the cups out in the kitchen, get all the plates out for pizza, turn all the ovens 
on.  So then when Rose comes in she's going to put all the pastries out on the trays and she'll fix 
all the pizza's so they'll be ready to just pop in the oven.  And then we have to set up the floors 
because there's bingo boards that have to come down so that people can see the boards.  And then
there's the machine for the bingo balls for them, for the caller to use.  And that all has to come 
down and set up.  So that's all set up and ready to go.  Turn on the air conditioners to make it 
cool for the people in this kind of weather, ha, ha.  But even now it might be nice and cool out 
and you're going to say "well why do you need the air conditioners today?"  But because there's 
no windows, you know, there's two window but with an air conditioner in each.  And then on the 
opposite side there's two more windows, but they got the winter storm windows still in them.  So 
you open them and your not going to get any air anyways.  So we pop on the air conditioners.  I 
mean after a hundred people get in here it does get a little stuffy.
I:  Is that about how many people come?
A:  We average anywhere between, lately anywhere between 115 to 125, which is very small.  
We use to be 150 to 170.  So we've dropped an awful lot.  [I:  Why?]  Who knows.  Go to New 
Hampshire, get better money, bigger money.  I can't tell you, I really don't know.  [I:  Is it the 
same 100 or so that come?]  Basically, yes.  Give or take 5 or 10, yeah.  Uhmm.  [I:  Is it mostly 
men or woman or (--)]  Oh no, all women, you can count men on your hands.  Yeah.
I:  I want to go back to the order, okay.  So you set up until around what time?
A:  I usually takes me about a good hour to get everything set up, uh, sometimes even longer.  It 
all depends.  It all depends on what I have to do.  Like I had to fully set up today.  Usually what I
do is sneak in here on Tuesday nights and get like a little head start.  But when school starts it 
gets even worse.  It takes us even longer.  Because with the kids here in the cafeteria, okay, they 
got there own set up.  So there's chairs all over the place, the tables aren't where they are suppose
to be.  So it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work.  [I:  And then what comes next after you set up?]  
After I'm done set up out on the floors, then I have to come in here and set up all the boxes, you 
know.  Paper strip games, I have to put their money there so that when they start they have 
money to start with.  The lottery charity game tickets that are behind you, I have to count all 
them tickets and issue them so many.  And then when they come back at the end of the night I 
count what's left.  And they have to balance to my figures.  If they don't then I yell at them.  "All 
right, you ripped me off tonight, what's you guys doing?" you know.  [LAUGHING]  You know, 
and uh, that has to be set up, I haven't done that yet.  [I:  Yeah, tell me if you have to stop to do 
something.]  No, no not yet.  And then uh, (--)  See we don't sell any of that until 6:00, okay.  So 
in a half an hour we open the doors.  And that's when the public will come in, buy their cards, 
and place them wherever they want to sit.  [I:  At 5:00?]  Uhmm.  A majority of them leave.  
They just come in, set up their cards, go home and eat, and change, and whatever.  Then they 
come back at seven.  There are a few that stay until seven o'clock, until it opens, and you'll see 
them eating supper here.  
I:  In together, or in groups, alone or how does it go?
A:  Oh no.  A whole mob will walk in at the door at the same time.  Because what it is, is that 
Rose just has unlocked the door.  So they will come in and stand in the hallway.  They know not 
to come pass those doors.  Cause they know that we don't open until 5:00.  And we can't let them 
sneak in every now and then because then they will be here at 3:00 when I'm here.  And then I'll 
never get anything set up.  [I:  Why do they line up?]  Excuse me?  [I:  Why do they come so 
early?]  They want to get their spot.  [I:  Does it happen that someone might come late, and they 
get mad someone else is in there spot?]  Oh yes, oh they get furious.  And they expect us to do 
something about it and they're really isn't anything that we can do.  I mean, it's an awful thing to 
say, because you really hate to loose your customer, but how can you go up to somebody and say
"I'm sorry but you're in Mrs spot" you know, you just (--)  You know.  Moderate commission 
would really be furious if they knew you were doing things like this, because as they say there 
are no reservations.   You can't reserve.  If you want to be here at 5:00 to get your spot, then be 
here at 5:00 and get your spot.  [I:  Are there favorite spots?]  Oh yes, definitely.  [I:  Where are 
those tables?]  And heaven forbid that (--)  You know you can come in and want your regular 
spot, okay, one that you sit in every week, and there will be a person behind you that is brand 
new, has never been to this bingo before, and they'll go right by the line to grab a spot.  I mean, 
the table is not yours unless you got the paid stub of your ticket that says it's your seat.  Okay, if 
you don't have that ticket then I have every right to bounce you out of that spot.  And it does 
happen.  You get knew people that come in and what they do is bypass the line to go grab there 
table.  In the meantime somebody is buying their cards.  They want to get to their table and see 
that somebody is already there.  Well they will make it known to us, believe me.  "Somebody's in
my spot"  Okay, and off you go and doing the knotty job of making the move.  And then you end 
up with a furious person.  No matter what you do you have a furious person.  So you just abide 
by the state laws.
I:  Don't people know like "Dottie usually sits over here." and (--)
A:  Well if your a new person that has never been to this bingo before you don't know that.  [I:  
But the ones who do know (--)]  Yes, they will never take somebody else's spot.  
I:  How long has this bingo been going on at St. Louis?
A:  Oh my, a good thirty years.  [I:  So some of these people have been going here for a long 
time?]  Oh yeah, oh definitely.  One of the workers, uh, he comes in later now, he usually doesn't 
come here until 7:30-8:00.  By the time he comes he only does the last half.  Uh, he was telling 
me a couple of weeks ago, last week in fact, that he started working bingo a few weeks after I 
was born.  Because he didn't realize last week was my birthday and he was telling me the whole 
story about how he started here at bingo and he told me it was only a couple of years after.  So 
I'm 33 this year.  So he's been at least working this here bingo for thirty years.  [I:  But St. Louis' 
Church has been here since the 1800's?]  Oh yes, that's right.  
I:  Okay, so then 5:00, then lining up (--)  Oh.  What I wanted to ask you about the seats, is it in 
the middle of the room that they like or the ends?
A:  Oh, each person has their own favorite spot.  Uhmm.  Some like to be near the caller, some 
like to be near the air conditioners, and it really all depends.  [I:  So the ones that stay from five 
on, what do they do?]  Play cards, uh, read a paper, bring a magazine with them, uh, chit chat 
with somebody else.  You know, have their supper.  A few of them you'll see have their supper.  
[I:  Do people eat much of the food?]  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we buy five pizza's and the five pizza's 
will be sold by the end of the night.  We also pick up between 10-15 hot dogs and those will be 
gone by the end of night.  So, and then we have about 1, 2, 3 (--)  It's either 5 or 6 dozen of 
pastries.  That, that varies.  Sometimes it all goes, sometimes it doesn't.  [I:  And then, uh, do 
they eat before the game starts, or during the game, or after?]  You got it.  You just said it all.  [I: 
Oh, so they'll eat during the game?]  Sure, uhmm.  [I:  It must be hard though, you have to watch 
your cards.]  Oh no, well it depends what you're playing.  If your only playing nine cards, then 
you can have a party while your playing with nine cards.  I mean nine cards to me is nothing to 
play, but we have people that play thirty, but even thirty you'll see them drinking and eating and 
snacking and (--)  But it all depends on how you adjust yourself.  I mean maybe you'll only snack
while there calling off a winner, you know.  
I:  And then, uh, okay, five to seven they sit.
A:  Five to seven they sit.   [I:  Nothing happens officially.]  Uh, not as far as the game is 
concerned.  Just at six o'clock that's when we go out with the paper strip games.  These are 
special games.  And we go out at 6:00 till 7:00 and sell these paper strip games.  So if they want 
to play a special game to win more money then normal (--)  Where are they?  I just ran some of 
these off.  This is our prizes.  And where it says Early Bird, ING, and Winner Take All, those are 
specials.  Those you have to buy paper strips for.  All the other games on that list they have 
cards.  [I:  The Early Bird, ING]  Uhmm, and the Winner Take All.  [I:   Okay, and that you 
would have to be here at six to get the paper strips for.]  Right, from six to seven.  If you happen 
to come in 7:30 you can't buy the first one because the game is already either in progress, or has 
ended.  But if you want the next two games, the ING and the Winner Take All, at intermission we
sell them as well.  For anybody that has either come in late, or they won and want to buy a 
couple extras.  [I:  Oh, I see, okay.  And when is the intermission?]  Intermission is right before 
the ING game.  [I:  Is that at a certain time?]  Time?  It all depends, I mean, cause if you have 
like five and six (--)  We're going to loose our electricity.  Uh, it really all depends.  Because if 
there is four or five winners per game then naturally it's going to take longer, because the caller 
has to check every single card.  But if there is only one winner per game then you're going to fly.
END OF SIDE ONE
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
I:  Where were we.  Oh yeah.  What do you call it?  The strip game?
A:  Paper strips.  [I:  Paper strips.]  Those are special games.  [I:  Okay.]  
I:  And uh, you said the intermission comes depending on the number of winners.  
A:  Yeah, it's generally, I'll say anywhere from quarter of eight and eight-thirty.  Anywhere 
between that range.  [I:  And how long is the intermission?]  Generally, between 15 to 20 
minutes.  Usually the caller who calls next kind of looks if everybody's gotten what they wanted 
to eat and it looks like everybody is out of the ladies room.  Then he will go and start calling.  
And if it looks like everybody is still up and around then he will wait a few more minutes.  But 
it's generally around 15 and 20 minutes.  [I:  Does that mean you have two callers every night?]  
Yes, uhmm.  One calls the beginning half and one calls the last half.  [I:  And are they two 
different kinds of games the beginning and the (--)]  No, they're not.  No, they're all (--)  No, not 
really.
I:  All right.  So mostly people eat, talk, go to the bathroom?  
A:  Right.  Make a phone call home, make sure everything is okay.  Change their cards.  Cause 
"All these are rotten, they weren't good to me.  So, I want new cards".  So they come and change 
their cards at intermission.  Hope that their new cards will be better for them.  [I:  So they feel 
like the cards are lucky or not?]  Yeah, right.  [I:  That's funny.]  You'll have a lot of people that 
will make sure that they have numbers 1 through 75.  So that at any time during the night if a 
number is called, well I know I have it somewhere on my cards.  And if they don't, if they 
happen to be missing a number, they'll actually request that we switch cards because there 
missing a certain number.  [I:  Oh, so they'll come back and exchange cards?]  Right, and they're 
not legally, it's not allowed, the state rules that you can't.  So what we have to do is if they want 
to change a card we can exchange a card for them face down.  If it's still not the one they want, 
then they have to say "Can I have another card?"  You know what I'm saying?  We can't look for 
their number that they're missing and say "here you go".  [I:  Oh, that's like setting it up.]  Right. 
Right.  They just have to keep picking a card and hope that they finally get one.  
I:  Now, since I don't know much about bingo, is there some sort of rule book that tells you how 
to play the game, or are there (--) How do you know what the rules are?
A:  You, basically, you learn the rules as you become a player.  Uh, usually, I never seen a case 
where three people walk into bingo together, or singly and say "I don't know what to do, teach 
me".  You always end up coming with somebody who seems to know.  You know, you buy your 
cards and you set.  So on all, like these regular games, these games that are sticking out, that 
you're going to play on your cards.  So the caller will call B-8.  So you'll look under the B on 
your card.  See [are cards are three card?] on one.  So if somebody is playing nine cards and 
they'll have three strips like this in front of them.  So if you need a B-8, your not going to look 
over here, your going to look under the B and look for an 8.  [I:  The B as in Bingo.]  Right.  
Okay.  You find the number you want and put a little marker on it.  So you don't have to look at 
every single row because they're numbered.  There's 1-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60-75.  So each 
row has 15 numbers.  [I:  All right, you lost me.]  B, you'll find a number in B, from 1-15.  You'll 
never find 16 in the B row.  [I:  Oh, I see.  Oh, under I it's 16-(--)]  16-30.  And then it's 31-45 
under the N.  [I:  Oh, I see.]
I:  And then these other games.
A:  Uhmmm.  [I:  They must have developed over time, huh?]  Yes, they have.  Yup.  Usually it's 
just a regular bingo, you know, five across or diagonally, or whatever.  [I:  What's regular, okay 
regular bingo would be five across.]  Regular bingo is just a straight bingo either way.  [I:  
Diagonally, across, or horizontally.]  Right.  That's a regular bingo. That's how bingo, (--) That's 
a regular bingo.  But over the years they've invented games.  There's a Round Robin, which they 
call, and that's around the center.  [I:  That's all the squares are in a square around the center.]  
Right.  Around the free spot.  And then they have the Large Round Robin, which is the outside 
ridge.  [I:  Okay.]  Then they play the T-game.  And that's here and like this.  [I:  It forms the 
shape of a T.]  Right.  Or upside down, this way up.  You can play it either way. There's the H, 
using the two ends with the center.  There's the X game, which we do play.  There's what they 
call a Postage Stamp, which is these four.  [I:  The four in the corner.]  These four, or it's these 
four, but it's any four in a corner.  It makes a Postage Stamp.  Uh, I'm trying to think, there's the L
game, and then there's the 7 game.  There's the H, I said.  [I:  Garbage Game?]  Garbage Game is
an anything game, anyway you can win.  Either get four corners, a Postage Stamp, a regular 
bingo.  So they call it Garbage.  [I:  That's funny.]  
I:  An X would form a shape of an X.  
A:  Right.  [I:  What's the Wild Number Game?]  Wild Number is a cover-all.  You have to cover 
all the numbers on you card.  And wild number means the very first number that he calls, if he 
happens to call I 21 then anything ending in 1 you cover on all your cards.  So the 1 becomes a 
wild number.  So when you win maybe 11 was never called but because of the 1 that made it 
wild makes it eligible for you to win.  
I:  And what about this game I saw at St. Michael's that this lady had explained to me.  They 
played a game that if you called 21 and you had 12 you could put the reverse of the number.
A:  Oh, we don't play that one here, yes.  That's similar to a Wild Game.  [I:  How come you 
don't play that one?]  We don't want to get involved, I don't know.  There's a lot of games we 
don't play.  I mean, basically, it depends on your crowd.  I mean, if the people want to play that 
type of a game.  [I:  Will they say lets play (--)]  Cause what we did at one time awhile back is 
we did a survey.  We sent out a questionnaire, do you want to change this game?  Do you like it 
the way it is?  What is it you don't like about us?  Why isn't your not, you know, (--)  And that's 
where we basically learned that that's not why they don't want to play they just want to (--).  
They want to play those special games but in order to play those special games they want more 
money too.  And we can't give out that much money because where not that big of a crowd.  I 
mean, at St. Michaels your talking 500 people, and were only 100 here.  And they expect us to 
give out the same kind of money they're giving out and we can't, we just can't.  There's no way 
we can compete with them.  I mean if we had the people, yes, we could give it out, and we would
give it out.  [I:  If you had more space would you get more people?]  Yes, but we also have the 
library upstairs that we open up.  We can fit easily 190 people between the floor downstairs and 
the bingo upstairs because we use the hall upstairs as well as the library.  But, like I said, we just 
don't have those people anymore.  We use to have 170-150 people up here all the time.  And it's 
just dropped way down to 110-125.  [I:  Do you know when it started to drop?]  I'm going to say 
it's when Mass State Lottery came out with all there Megabucks.  
I:  Competitions on the State.
A:  Yes.  Yes.  And if you notice you will see Mass State Lottery advertise very well, have you 
ever seen Bingo advertised?  [I:  That's the funny part.  Do you advertise at all?]  We advertise in 
the paper, but I'm saying do you ever see the state advertise Bingo?  No.  Never, never had 
advertised bingo, now why?  [I:  Huh!]  We had, it was a year ago in September, we had a 
meeting, uh, where was it, Brighton area I think it was.  I can't even remember.  And we all got 
together, and everybody that had a bingo, was invited to this meeting, and we all went, well we 
didn't all go , the two head persons here, we went to that meeting and that same exact question 
that was brought up.  You will advertise Mass State Lottery to get out there to buy those 
Megabuck Tickets, but why don't you advertise Bingo?  I mean they're getting there percentage 
just as well.  There still going to get there cut.  But yet, where not advertised.
I:  Do you ever have meetings with the other churches about Bingo?
A:  No.  I've never been a participant of somebody else's and they've never called me to my 
knowledge to meet or to talk.  [I:  Well you must have arranged the nights because you don't 
have bingo on the same nights.]  I don't know how that started.  That was way before my time.  
You know, to me it's just like well we're not going to have it Thursday nights because they have it
Thursday nights so we better have it Tuesday nights because there's one (--) you know what I'm 
saying?  But I mean, again that's something that's been started a long time ago.  [I:  And you 
always had it on (--)]  We've always had it on Wednsday nights.  [I:  Oh, you know what night it 
is tonight?]  [LAUGHING].
I:  Where is it the other nights?  Do you know?
A:  St. Michael's has there's on Tuesday nights.  [I:  Yeah!]  Uh, Lowell Elks is tonight.  St. 
Theresa's is on Tuesday nights.  Uhm, The Polish American Club is on Thursday nights.  Uhm, 
there's uh, what do you call that church?  [I:  St. Casermine?]  St. Casermine, there on Friday 
nights.  There several others, but I don't know when they are.  [I:  Now, do the same people, did 
your mother for example, go to St. Michael's, St. Louis, Polish American Club (--)]  Not all of 
them.  My mother went to St. Louis and St. Michael's.  She'd go twice a week.  But you will 
meet people that go five nights a week.  [I:  To all the different (--)  Is there something on 
Monday night too?]  There is, but I'm trying to think where it is.  I don't know if it is St. Jean 
D'Arc or I know St. Joseph's School has one on Friday nights.  Barbara, where is there a Bingo 
Monday nights?  [B. Jean Darc'.]  It is St. Jean D'Arc.  [O:  St. Jean D'Arc, Immaculate 
Conception, uh (--)] Tuesday night is St. Michael's and St. Theresa's.  [O:  St. Michael's, St. 
Theresa's, Sacred Heart (--)]  Oh!  Sacred Heart.
O:  There's three of them there.  On Wednsday night there's us, the VFW, the Lowell Elks.
A:  The VFW's closed for the summer though.  [O:  Someone said they were reopening.]  I don't 
know, maybe.  [O:  And then Thursday nights is uh, Notre Dame, Dracut Knights of Columbus in
Dracut.]  Oh!  That's right.  I forgot about that one.  Yes.  That's right.  [O:  And then Friday is St.
Marie's, St. William's]  Oh!  I didn't know those.  [O:  St. Marie's is in Centraville.]   I only knew 
St. Casimere.  [O:  St. Casimere's, St. Joseph's]  And St. Joseph's.  I said that.  [O:  Yup and (--)]  
[I:  So it covers the whole city?] Dracut High School has it.  [O:  Sundays.]  On Sundays, but not 
during the summer.  [O:  No, they close during the summer.]  They're only during school.  Yeah.  
I don't know of any Saturdays.  [O:  Saturdays?  The Holy Trinity up on High Street, uh, the one 
up in Pelham]  Oh yeah, but that's not around here.  [O:  Sundays there is St. Patrick's in Lowell, 
uh, let's see what else is there on Sundays?  I use to know them all.]  She's a regular bingo 
fanatic.  [O:  Do you know how long I have been going here?  Over 25 years.  25 Years.]  
I:  25 years to St. Louis?
O:  Right!  
I:  Yeah, but what I'm trying to find out is (--)  Okay, do people come here to gamble, or what do 
they come here for really?
O:  A night out, enjoyment.  [A:  Yeah!]  True.  People, to them bingo is [A:  It's a gamble but 
(--)], it's a gamble, it's  a night out.  [A:  But it's a night out.]  They see their friends, they talk to 
their friends, they get up and catch up on the latest gossip, which is great.  We tell jokes, you 
know, eat candy.  That's what it is.  People, this is a diversion to them, after the humdrum of the 
house all day.  I know it is for me.  I've been coming here, yeah, this is my 25th year.
A:  Andy was telling us last week that it has been about thirty years for him.  
B:  Yeah, because they started [A:  That's when he started.]  uh, 1958, they started.  And I started 
coming in 1962.  
I:  Do you go to all of them?  [O:  No.]  Which ones do you go to?  
B:  Sometimes, when I was living in the other part of the city, in Pawtucketville,  I use to go to 
St. Jean D'Arc and uh, I've been to Notre Dame a couple of times, but I only come here.  You 
know this is my regular.  [LAUGHING]  This here.
 
I:  Is this your parish? 
B:  No, I do more for this parish than I do for my own.
A:  There's a lot of non-parishioners that come.  [B:  Yeah, a lot of them.]  [I:  What is it that you 
like about this bingo better than the other ones?]  
B:  I don't know.   Maybe because I like the people.  I know everybody, everybody knows me.  
They'll call on the telephone, "Is Barbara there?"  "Will you put my cards down?"  It's true.  [I:  
Do you sit in the same place?]  I have sat in every side of this hall.  Cause they use to have the 
tables, not the way they are now, they use to be turned this way.  Uh, we use to sit up against the 
wall there, then we sat down at this wall, then we sat over here, and then we sat when the tables 
were this way.  But since the tables have been this way, we sit at the same table.  
I:  And you need quite a lot of room don't you?  I mean you can't sit too close cause you have to 
have room for your cards?
B:  Well I play 30 cards, which is a lot of cards.  Not many people play 30 cards.  [I:  Can you 
still talk to your neighbor, although you got all those cards?]  Oh yeah.  [A:  Of course.  They 
talk.  Believe you me, they talk.  Sometimes a little too much.  You'd like them to say shhh.]  We 
keep saying shshsh.  And it's us talking.  And When I yell bingo, (--) [A:  Everybody knows it.]  
That's right, keeps them on their toes.  Because I said to Ann, how can you hear a hand.  A lot of 
them will put up there hands.  [A:  They have bingo, and it's there hand that goes up. Ha.]  
I:  And if they don't see you then you don't win?
B:  Well how do you hear a hand?
A:  Well how can you, it's up to the caller too.  He's sitting there  trying to listen for you to say 
"Bingo" not [SHE RAISES HER HAND].
I:  Is it ever a woman caller?  [A:  Rose has called a few times.]  [B:  We had a girl named Laura 
that use to call.]  [A:  She use to come in all the time, but she stopped coming.]  [B:  But, uh, Ann
Marie has called.]   [A:  No sir, never in my life.]  [B:  I thought you did call one night.]  [A:  
Never in my life.]
I:  Why not?
A:  No way.  
B:  Rose, didn't she call one night?  [R:  Who?]  Ann.  [R:  Not since I've been here.]  I thought 
you had.  [A:  Never in my life.  I've done everything in here but call.]  I'll tell you one thing, if it
wasn't for Ann, this place would fall apart.  And I'm not saying because of her sitting there, I'm 
just telling you straight facts.  [I:  She runs the place.]  [A:  Ha, ha, I keep them on their toes.]  
You know, like [UNCLEAR] straight back.  [LAUGHING].
I:  Does anybody get paid?
A:  No.  [B:  It's volunteer.  But you will see the same faces every week.]
I:  Ann, do you play too, or do you just run it?
B:  No, no, no she's the runner.  [A:  She's the player.]  I play.
A:  I don't run it, Danny runs it.  [B:  No, no.]  Danny's the president of this place, not I.  [B:  The
president, right.]  He's in charge.  He does all the talking, I don't.  [B:  Yeah, There are presidents,
and there are pee-ons workers.]  I'm the pee-on.  [B:  Who actually does, you know, all the 
work?]
I:  Do you have to do something did you say?
A:  Yup!  We are going to be opening in 5 minutes, so.
I:  Okay tell me again, what is bingo support?  Schools, outside activities, what else?
D:  We're already charities, as if you know that uh, bingo will support handicapped children.  
Some bingos are run for that.  Some bingos are run for Youth Centers, uh, Day Care Centers, uh, 
revitalizing of a property that has probably gone down and people have gotten together, ran a 
bingo to support it.
I:  Is it mostly the churches that run it?  [D:  No, no, you have more than, you have bingo that 
supports the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign War, the Elks, they all run bingos and uh, 
they in turn take that money in and put it back into the community.]
I:  What about the idea that it is gambling?
D:  That's a false.  I think anybody that says that bingo is gambling, let me put it to you this way. 
If you take bingo out of a parish, you take away the communications, you take away the uh, 
[UNCLEAR] of some of these people.  Some of the elderly people, that's all they got to look 
forward to.  [I:  That's right, it's their only way out.]  Where today's life style is so expensive they
can't afford to do with fine restaurants, sand theaters, and shows.  Even though Lowell has 
provided them, it isn't enough.  This here bingo supplies that need.  They come, they meet there 
friends, they talk about past.  They have their gripes and what not, but that's part of the fusion 
that is needed.  Even though you have some decending remarks you also have some uplifting 
remarks [UNCLEAR].
I:  Well you do at any social gathering.  You know, people (--)
D:  Bingo gives them a sense of being part of something.  Any bingo really.  After awhile of 
being with a group of people it's like bowling every week.
I:  How come men don't come?
D:  Uh, we have some men, but it's more predominant woman.  And men kind of shy away from 
that.  It's looked upon as being a woman's "activity".  And really it isn't.  Uh, you take all the 
illegal gambling and stir it back into bingo, and you give bingo a hand to expand, my god the 
state would make thousand of dollars more.  Just that it doesn't.
I:  What's the male counter part to bingo?
D:  As to what?
I:  What do men do to get together to talk, gripe, you know, shoot the breeze?
D:  Well you got a number of activities.  You could join the Elks, that's one.  I'm not a person 
who joins those groups.  
I:  Everybody always tells me you can join all these clubs.  "Oh, are you a member?" "No."
D:  I have no interest in that.  My interest is in the community.  What is good for one should be 
good for all.  And uh, an all male or an all female thing is kind of outdated now.  It's now, you 
got a mix.  I think, uh, anybody today who says "this is totally a male originated organization" 
they're fooling themselves.
I:  Well the Rotary Club just got shut down for that in the court.  I notice that it use to be all male
and the court said (--).
D:  Three years ago it was the uh JC's.  [I:  Oh, they had to admit women there?]  Absolutely.
I:  This is a release form.  It says that you will allow us to give the tape to the library to tell about
bingo.  [A:  Oh, sure.]  There is two copies, you keep one and the other one I take.  So you know 
what you signed.  
I:  Could I sit for a little while with some of the people, like maybe that lady.  [D:  You can enjoy 
yourself all evening if you like.]  I'm not going to play.  [D:  Nope, but you can inquire, we'll 
give you a free hand.]  Okay.  
D:  Also our bingo also helps other organizations that come down in and want to uh, [A:  I'm 
going to let you have this magazine, sorry Danny I'm going to (--)]  Yeah, I know.  [A:  This is 
Lowell alone, all right, and over here is the Middlesex County.  Yeah, I have another one.  This is
the meeting that we had gone to.]  [I:  Oh, all right.  [A:  You can stay here and talk to her, I got 
to go.]  [I:  Just tell me your birth date.]  [A:  It was last Wednsday, 8-19-54.]  
D:  54, your a youngster, ha, ha.  [I:  Your Dan Marcotte?]  Marcotte.  [I:  Martin?  Marcotte.]  
[A:  His is next Thursday.]   Yeah, let's not push it.  [A:  Oh, I won't give out the year, how's 
that?]  Thank you.  
I:  You were talking before about people that sort of complained, talked gossip, etc.  [D:  Sure.]  
Do you know what they talk about during the games?
D:  Oh sure.  It's easy, you can hear it.  I walked one night through the bingo hall, and you hear 
remarks of little intimate things like a woman is now seeing this individual or her husband has 
past away, uh, complaints about the community (--)  [I:  Like?]  Like it wasn't like it was back 
when.  Uh, I think the biggest fear for most of the elderly is the lack of caring on the younger 
generation.  Uh, (--)
I:  Is is mostly old people that come?  Would you call them elderly?
D:  I would say 60% are the older generation.  I don't like to use the word elderly or senior 
citizen, they're the older generation.  They're the generation that is now in power.  They're 
running the country.  Our generation is doing, every generation has it.  My daughter's generation 
will be the new generation of [UNCLEAR].  Uh, it's just a press on our society.  I look at the old 
generation as being the generation of two major wars, two conflicts, who have tighten there belts 
under depression.  I spend an ample time with the elderly.  I like listening to the stories.  My 
grandfather died a year ago and I listen to the times when they use to build the canals till when 
he use to supervise the canals.  
I:  But, uh, was he Irish, I'm trying to guess.
D:  French.  [I:  French.]
I:  What about your mother, or on the other side?
D:  French too.  French/Indian.  Uh, like I said, a lot of the elderly are talking about that.  Future 
aspirations, fears about social security being cut, medicaid being reduced, uh, how they are going
to exist and what not.  Things of that sort.  And sometimes I think we are in too much of a rush to
stop and listen to them.  
I:  What do the younger people do for that kind of social outlook?
D:  Well you got your uh, night life, you got other activities.  I think the young are starting to get 
more involved in the health scene, rapped up in there own individual ideas.  The problem with 
that is that you forget about the community.  I'm not saying a great deal of them.  There is that 
small minute crowd that does take pride in the community and does get involved.  But for the 
most part, no.  Self wrapped up in career, self wrapped up in personal goals, egos that have to be 
fulfilled.
I:  But they have friends, don't they get together somehow?
D:  Uh, when you say friends, what do you mean by friends?
I:  Well, like people at certain age would get together here and play bingo, other people like high 
school kids might get together at CYO, some kids hang around on street corner, at least that's 
where they see their friends.  [D:  Oh, oh.]  Some people ages 30-40 (--).
D:  That's uh, one thing bingo does offer.  It's a weekly thing.  It's here no matter what.  52 weeks
out of the year, it's here.  So 52 weeks out of the year, even if they visit one time a week at bingo,
it's like family.  You know.  You go see your gram, your mother and father once a week.  Or at 
least a couple of times a month.  But they're there.  It's established.  Bingo's established.  Uh, you
can ask a lot of the bingo's around.  They have established group of people that come and sit in 
one specific area and do one specific thing.  And it is a group of people and that is it.  And uh, 
that's what bingo supplies.  That meeting place.  Yeah, there's gambling going on.  I cannot 
concede to the amount of money that is given out to bingo as being a tremendous megabucks 
value.  But I think the potential for bingo is giving the elderly a chance to enjoy being with other 
people, mixing, winning a little money.  Most of all just that.  See we run breakfasts once a 
month.  We start in September and we'll go till possibly June.  It's a family style breakfast.  And 
uh, it's rather cheap.  But uh, it's a gathering place.  To know that at the end of the month an 
elderly person can come in here with two dollars and get a full breakfast, and all the compliments
of breakfast and meet the other group of people.  
I:  Is that all parishioners, or other people too?
D:  Oh yeah.  We open the doors to anybody.  This is (--)
I:  But do other people come?
D:  Sure.  We get firemen that come, policemen that stop by, pick up their breakfast. "Sunday 
mornings, St. Louis Bingo, we got to pick up our breakfast."  See I believe in as much as Lowell 
has grown, uh, and come out of a depression fifteen years ago, and that's the word to use.  I don't 
think it turned into slums.  You can't turn something that was there into a slum.  It's just a 
depression.  Lack of interest, lack of funds.  And I think Lowell is coming out of that.  And I 
think we have some excellent (--)  I know a lot of Lowell politicians who are trying, who are 
trying to bring the sense of value back to the community.  And I tip my hat to them.  I think it is 
worth while.  And I'd like to see a lot more.  My wife and I are involved in the community.  [I:  
In the community in what way?]  My wife is a member of the Highland Players.  That is a 
theatrical group.  They get together once a year, and they invite a variety of charities.  Now the 
gentleman who has started there, his name is Bud Caufield, he's running for City Council.  I 
might not agree on his politics, or his ideas of politics, but I know that he has been one of the 
rocks of (--)  I admire him for his involvement in the community.  Literally.  [I:  What do they 
do, make up plays?]  What they do is they put on a show for a weekend.  Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday.  And they put on this mass minstrel show at the Lowell Auditorium.  And it's singing and
comedy.  They have done it over 12 years now.  [I:  Is that volunteer?]  All volunteer.  There's 
roughly anywhere from 100 - 150 people involved in the show.  [I:  When does it take place?]  In
May.  Matter-of-fact if you ask anybody in the city of Lowell they'll tell you about the Highland 
Players.  [I:  Why are they called the Highland Players?]  Well originally it was for the Highland 
Little League, and they use to do, raise money for the Little League interest and a few other 
things, and they would put on these minstrel shows to raise money.  Well it got to a point where, 
two years ago, I stepped down because of my involvement in my career, uh, and my involvement
with other things, uh, they started to expand.  They were going to Chelmsford, Billerica, Dracut, 
Lowell.  They were traveling.  It just got too much, way too much.  
I:  So they performed more than once a year?
D:  They use to.  Now they perform once a year at Lowell Auditorium.  And they sell out.  [I:  Do
they rehearse the whole year?]  Oh yeah.  They start in January for May.  [I:  Uh ha.]  
I:  And what do they do with the money?
D:  Okay.  They don't raise it solely for themselves.  Uh, they invite all the charitable groups in 
Lowell to sell tickets and the money they get from the tickets is a small percentage paid back to 
the Highland Players for the cost of the costumes and the theater itself.
