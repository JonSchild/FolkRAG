THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE BANJO. 
BANJO SOLO , 
Written hy CHAS. DIIICKIVOOD. 
Sung by TONI W ARFIELD. 
W ELL, here we are before you, 
My old banjo and me ; 
We're right direct from Africa, 
We come through C. 0. D. 
My name is Pompey Julius, 
:My banjo's name is Sal; 
I 
love her as I 
do my life, 
You bet I 
always shall. 
Then hear the old strings rattle ; 
I 
love to hear her prattle; 
Some love one kind of music, 
Some would another choose, 
But there's nothing like the banjo, 
To drive away the " blues." 
The other day a 
friend came up, 
And unto me he said, 
" 
I've got the hypochondria, 
I 
wish that I 
were dead; " 
I 
just took down the banjo, 
From its accustomed place, 
I 
played him up a 
jig or two, 
lie laughed all o'er his face. 
Then hear the old, etc. 
So, kind friends, do your level best 
To drive dull care away ; 
ou only have one life to live, 
Be happy while you may; 
Howsomever, should you ever 
Get to feeling solemucholy, 
Just call on Pompey Julius, 
And he'll cure you up, by Golly ! 
Then hear the old, etc.

Sung by TOM W ATITIELD. 
Loox away yonder, what do I

What you gwine to do when you get dar ? 
I

What you gwine to do when you get dar ? 
Look away yonder, look up in de sky, 
What you gwine to do when you get dar ? 
I

CHORUS. 
Oh, in

When I

I

What you gwine to do when you get dal. ? 
And ride wid her in de golden chariot,

Oh, my little, etc. 
UNSOPHISTICATED LOVE. 
End Song. 
Sung by ARCHIE W HITE with D UP..= and BENEDICT... 
Minstrels, 
THE gal that I 
love is both tall and serene, 
Her teeth are bran new, and her cheeks are so green 
Her voice is as sweet as the tones of a 
mule, 
Her uncle's a 
sailor, her brother's a 
fool. 
She can chew all day long on a 
big lump of gum, 
Like a 
freckled faced boy with a 
wart on his thumb, 
Her appetite's good, she'd devour with great ease, 
A 
couple of tons of old limburger cheese. 
CHORUS. 
She had a 
great love for the new silver dollars, 
She looks like a 
fairy in clean paper collars, 
When she opens her head the inside can be seen, 
No " taffy" at all, she's a 
lovely sardine. 
She owns a 
big farm where the bull frogs do grow, 
She raises a 
crop of the best kind of snow ; 
I 
gave her my picture dressed in my best togs, 
And she put it in the sty for to frighten the hogs. 
She wears a 
glass eye, and its color is red, 
She's a 
big bunch of feathers attached to her head, 
She can talk broken Chinese in seventeen tongues, 
And blow down a 
house with her cast iron lungs. 
She had, etc. 
never can tell all her beauties at once, 
She calls me a 
sugar-coated galvanized dunce; 
When she kisses me with her big mouth open wide, 
There's room enough in it for an elephant to ride. 
If she ever got mad she'd pulverize your jaw 
With one little swipe of her delicate paw ; 
What shall I 
say of her gaiters to wear ? 
It takes forty big co wskins to make her a 
pair. 
She had, etc.

THE TALKING WOMAN. 
Words and Music by Wm. CauttoLL. 
I'LL sing about a 
darling girl who is not known to fame, 
She lives in Crystal Palace, and I 
don't know what's her 
name, 
And where she works, or what she does, there is no one 
can tell ; 
She looks just like a 
bag of rag3 a-tumbling down a 
hill. 
Her noisy tongue is running -wild from .early morn till 
night, 
And all the neighbors think that she's a 
gawk ; 
But they have to weaken terribly and then throw up the 
sponge 
When this Iron Foundry girl begins to talk. 
CIMET7S. 
But she has big feet, and she eats raw meat, 
And I 
think they call her Marge ; 
Her ears were green and her hair was lean, 
And her mouth is wondrous large. 
She's dressed so gay like a 
bile of hay, 
has a 
nose like a -chicken hawk ; 
She'll give points to almost any one 
When she begins to talk. 
Her voice is like a 
rip-saw when it strikes against a 
nail, 
She'll talk your hair out by the roots or a 
tramp clean out 
of jail ; 
She talked the hinges off a 
door, which was an awful 
sin ; 
I 
know she talked a 
man to death and talked a 
bull-dog 
thin. 
Her jaws are made of cast-steel and they never will wear 
out, 
And she winds them every morning, so they say. 
I'll bet a 
doughnut to a 
pie iF they give her a 
chance 
She'll talk a 
year if she can talk a 
day.

THE TALKING WOMAN.—Conoludad, 
CIIOEUS. 
She's very fat like a 
Thomag cat, 
And her talk is awful trash ; 
She is no fool, but she's like a 
mule, 
And her teeth are filled with hash. 
She stole a 
fence, for she has no sense, 
And they pushed her in the dock ; 
But that had no effect on her 
When she began to talk. 
She won the medal at Paree and walked off with the 
And. says she'll never give it up, no, never, till she dies ; 
She's forty-six years old to- day, and healthy as a 
hen, 
She'll live to talk the lives out of a 
hundred thousand 
men. 
Bat sha will talk herself to death some one of these fine 
days, 
And her name upon a 
mudscow we will chalk. 
We'll miss her from the foundry where she used to sit 
and chin. 
This charming- 
girl who always wants to talk. 
C.110111_,S. 
She talks so lust that I 
think she'll last 
Till the world comes to an end ; 
She gets abuse, and her teeth are loose, 
And she has not got a 
friend ; 
11.,r 
eyes are red, like the hogs she's fed, 
Like a 
stubborn mule she'll balk ; 
She'll give a 
mile in twenty-six 
With some one for to talk.

THE COLORED BAND. 
END SON (;. 
By C. R. 
DOCKSTADER. 
sung by Tom W ARFIELo. 
I 
HEAR de music playing 
As I 
come down de street, 
It reminds me of it colored band 
That used to play, so sweet; 
Every member was a 
coon, 
And popular airs they played; 
You ought to hear de music, 
At a 
dance, or on parade. 
CHORI ".••••% 
Tura, turn, turn, the cornet went, 
Played by Jimmie Paddle. 
Zume, 7.1.1111C, zume, de old trombone, 
Johnson played de fiddle. 
Tute, lute, tute, the clarinet, 
Played by Jones' wife. 
Music on de fife. 
When de band begins to play, 
Then the people march away; 
Hear the foolish wenches say, 
Watch them coons,- give them room, 
Dey ain't got long to stay. 
Jones' wife am tall and black, 
And seven feet she stands; 
She wants to be the leader 
Of that awful colored band. 
She plays the drum and cymbals, 
Most beautiful to see ; 
Her eyes are red, and the wig on her head 
Was built in " forty-thrce."

THE COLORED BAND.—Concluded. 
One evening in de summer, 
They went out to serenade ; 
They 'roused de folks for miles around 
With the discords that they made. 
The police came to stop de row, 
They thought there was a 
fight. 
That colored band marched hand in hand 
To the station- house that night.

Words and Music by Auctio: W HITE. 
'TAWS down in the meadow by the brooklet. 
Where the birds were sweetly singing, 
Where the nightingale sung out its lay, 
And the summer flowers were springing; 
'Twas there I 
met a 
maiden fair 
With cheeks that were aglow; 
She won my heart that very night, 
Down where the orange blossoms grow. 
C11011I7S. 
For there's none so fair that can compare 
With this treasure I 
call my own; 
I'll ne're forget when first we met 
Down where the orange blossoms grow. 
Oh, she sent me a 
loving missive; 
In it she requested a 
reply; 
Then she spoke about our happy meeting 
When no one else was nigh. 
Her vision haunts me night and day, 
She's fairer than the rose; 
That day we met I'll ne'er forget, 
Down where the orange blossms grow. 
For there's none so fair, etc. 
I 
dare say you think- now that, strange it appears, 
Ti' see a 
comedian xvho is nearly in tears , 
But when my sad story I 
pour in your ears, 
Perhaps you will pity my woes. 
It's on a 
young damsel I 
fondly did dot— 
NO 
charmer more fairer than she. 
She fancied the stage, but cola 
not sing a 
note, 
Su she came to take lessons from me— do, re, nal. 
C1101tC. 
To music balls 'nightly this damsel would go, 
And listen to Robinson, who enchanted her so, 
But now she's got married, and liVes in a 
place I 
don't know, 
With a 
fellow who plays the banjo. 
On bearin,w me sing the " Bohemian Swell," 
She head-
vet-ears in love with the MI. 
In less than three weeks she knew all her note ,‘ 
well, 
Such attention I 
to her had paid. 
All the new ladies' songs that were puhlished I 
bought; 
bought her stage preperties new : 
For she by this time to perfection was brought, 
And soon was to make her debut. 
To music halls nightly, lita. 
Now, I 
asked a 
young fellow I 
happened to know, 
Be being rather clever upon the banjo; 
And as I 
to the country for a 
week mid to go, 
To pertOrtu tic town (111 it's tor m e. 
Be promised, and I 
on my journey aid start— 
Came btch, aud found to my dismay. 
That he with his banjo hail so eharno•d her heart, 
That \\ ith him she skedaddled away.. 
'To music halls nightly, 
I 
ne•er saw her more after that night—. 
I 
ne .er saw her more. though I 
scot ( died left ond right, 
And I 
was laid nip seven weeks I 
hrongh the flight, 
The news it so played on my nerves 
As I 
was out strolling one very fine day, 
I 
turned round to hear music tones. 
Saw this chap with his banjo was tuning away, 
While my darling was shaking the " bones " 
To music balls nightly, e.r.c. 
Against this young fellow a 
grudge 1 
do owe 
lit' did very WT011 ,  in servill7 me so: 
And also a 
grudge aii-ainst Ius banjo— 
And 1 
lope it wen't keep in tune. 
I 
hope, wit'

And knock a

And I 
also hope. when they go throned' tint

That they don't get one cent of tin.

HELEN'S BABIES," 
Wito is it takes our big tomcat 
And throws it in the creek? 
Who is it makes such a 
terrible noise 
When we strive to sing or speak ? 
Who mashed my watch and filled my hat 
With water, grease and gravies? 
Those noisy little nigger imps, 
We call 'em Helen's babies. 
CHORES. 
They killed the cat, they shaved the dog, 
Stole the bangs from all the ladies, 
They shot a 
duck, and greased a 
hog, 
Those awful lichen's babies. 
They filled my pipe with powder, 
And thought it was immense, 
To see me blown up in the air 
And fall across the fence, 
They filled my shoes with water 
Enough to float the navies. 
I'd like to catch those nigger imps, 
Those sassy Helen's babies. 
They killed the eat, etc. 
THE GIRL WITH GOLDEN HAIR. 
Song and Dance by Anciiii W HITE. 
WREN the evening winds do wlfisper 
Of the blissful days agone, 
And I 
smile and sigh in silence 
At the scenes I 
draw therefrom; 
Then to memory's eye ariseth 
Pictures sad, and very fair; 
But the fairest one to gaze on 
Is the girl with goltion hair.

If you knew her you would love her, (/ rea/..) 
For there's music in her laughter ; (bra/) 
She's the pink of sweet perfection. 
Bewitching, and so fair; 
And the only one that holds my heart, 
Is the girl with golden hair. 
Yes, the fairest, dearest picture 
That ariseth to my sight, 
Is this winsome maid with tresses 
Like unto the gold sunlight; 
Like a 
half-
blown rose her mouth is, 
Like a 
wild rose is her check. 
And her eyes like blue flax blossoms 
Arc most tender, fad, and sweet.

illINNY SIGHTS. 
Itio2dt, by PRANK DUMONT. 
Sung by Tom W ATIFIELD. 
I'VE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, 
I'll tell you of the funny sights I've seen these many 
years ; 
I 
saw a 
bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag, 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
I 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
say, an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a 
greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin ride a 
horse, 
Or see a 
steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase a 
flea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen a 
hog whose head was bald, around his head he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
saw a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank some old benzine I saw a thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe, and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing- gloves standing on his head, 
A 
dish cloth drink a 
pail of milk, and a 
lobster that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on lfis ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever saw, I 
remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper .without any teeth chewing a 
bale of 
hay.

PRIVATE OPINION OF TOMMY WARFIELD. 
Written and sung by T031 NA-Al:FIELD. 
KIND friends, if you will listen, I 
will try to amuse you; 
I 
wont keep you long, so your attention please give. 
It's one thing and another that's happened quite lately 
in this great country in which we all live. 
For .
.. ou know everybody has some sort of hobby, 
Some pet little views of their own to reveal; 
So as its the fashion I'll give you in passing 
The private opinion of Tommy Warfield. 
Politics soon will ruin our country, 
And one. thing sure, between me and you, 
If the poor bad the money that's spent on electing, 
That would be an act of charity that right men would do. 
It would make many a 
happy one and a 
great name for our 
Nation, 
Many a 
bleeding heart soon then would be healed. 
Politicians don't need it, the rich wouldn't miss it. 
That's the private opinion of Tommy Warfield.

THREE TRIUMPHANT TRAMPS. 
Words by BE:MCI:E..; SMITH. 
Now here come the three tri-um-phant tramp.s, 
On the verge of dark decay, 
Who travel all the snoozy night, 
And sleeps away the day. 
We've just come out to hunt a 
lunch 
As hungry as can be, 
So hurry up the crackers and cheese 
And schooners of beer for three; 
Bring on your live old Ern-bur-ger, 
Eye bread and sour hrout, 
Pale ale and bottled stout, 
Gin, ruin, and wine, and a 
keg or Sc) of beer, 
And then a 
truce to every care 
For the three ill-urn- pliant tramps. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramping all the time, 
Sleeping on the telegraph, eating on the fly, 
On other people's property we always grip our clamps, 
Our luck to try as we go by, 
We three tri-um-phant tramps— tramp. 
We haven't had a 
dollar bill 
Since the war of ' 62, 
When we tramped it in the bloody march, 
The gray against the blue. 
And yet we have a 
rattling time 
Excurting through the land, 
No place to sleep, nowhere to eat, 
And never a 
helping hand, 
Oh, we triumph o'er the decrees of fate; 
And never care a 
straw 
For money-moving law, 
So long as lunch and a 
glass or so of beer 
Can get into the greedy chunps 
Of three tri-um-phant tramps. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, ete.

ANNA MARIA CAFOOSELAM JANE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by TOM W ARFIELD. 
I'VE nearly cried my eyes all out, 
My clothes are getting thinner, 
I'll be bald-headed very soon 
Through a 
girl, I 
couldn't win her. 
I 
bought a 
brand new set of teeth 
To chew gum- drops through the day, 
And when she euchered all my stamps, 
Why, from in 
she ran away.

Anna Maria Cafooselam Jane, 
That is my darling's name ; 
And all the fellows in this town 
Thve got her on the brain. 
She's humpbacked, bunion on her toe, 
And a 
double-breasted corn, 
Where is my Anna Maria gone 'f 
The fellow she pawned her gizzard to 
Was an artiste in his line; 
lie was by trade a 
catcher of dogs, 
And he got rich in the Summer time. 
Ile presented her with a 
poodle purp. 
Her old heart to ensnare; 
lie bought her had butter for pomade, 
And a 
barrel of red false hair. 
Anna Maria, etc. 
I 
thought at once I 
would die (my hair), 
Or do a 
deed quite rash; 
So I 
rushed right down to my boarding-house, 
And I 
poisoned myself with hash. 
I 
threw myself in a 
fellow's pocket, 
And borrowed his watch—that's funny; 
While the girl she came to a 
terrible end 
By eating brown soap for honey.

A ROW OF TENEMENT H OU SES . 
Originally sung by the swell Comedians, NILES and EvANs. 
Air—" Blue Alsatian Mountains." 
IN 
a row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair ; 
Her papa yore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Mai(len with a 
dimpled eyebrow-, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
:NI-olden with a 
valler 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Scone family would move away, 
For that row of tenement house.i 
Never sceine.d to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing! 
Just to hear that maiden sing. 
Oh, he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought lie was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
nurro burro! hurra! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trousers 
For the clog to chew that day.

ONE MORE RIVER TO CROSS. 
Sung by CuAs. GOODYEAR, with great success. 
SHOUT, children, you am free, 
One more river to cross ; 
Oh, the sogers give you liberty, 
One more river to cross ; 
Oh, four eleven forty four, 
One more river to aross ; 
That's the number now that comes no more, 
One more river to cross. 
CHORUS. 
Den a 
wasent that a 
wide river, 
River of Jordan's strand. 
Wide river, one more river to cross. 
Some go to church for to sing and laugh, 
One more river to cross; 
Dey think they knew all, but didn't know half, 
One more river to cross ; 
Some go to church for to sing and shout, 
One more river to cross ; 
In aboRt six months dey get kicked out,

THE DAYS WHEN THIS OLD NIGGER WAS 
YOUNG. 
.4.m.—" The good old days of Adam and Eve." 
I'LL sing you a 
song that never has been sung, 
'Bout the good ole days when dis nigger was young, ; 
And when you bears it, you'll say " dat's so," 
For I 
know what I 
tells you, an' tolls what I 
know. 
CHORUS. 
Singing, oh, dear! what queer things have sprung 
Since de safe ole times when dis nigger was young, 
In de days I 
was young, nigger's wool didn't hang high, 
Poultry sold cheap and chickens wasn't shanghigh ; 
Young folks went to meetin' an' didn't go to musses, 
And folks went into hominy instead of homnybusses. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc. 
In dem ole times, why a 
church wasn't a 
pay house, 
An' the pulpit didn't wear clothes like a 
play-house ; 
Dn folks sung together by the sigh of dar voices, 
An' dey didn't pay the choir for makin' all de noises. 
Singin ,i, oh, dear! etc. 
On de ole turnpike dar was no railway crashes, 
Dan de liquor still didn't make the brandy smashes ; 
Folks didn't get frightened at too many news, 
Den cobblers didn't burn soles, but dey mended shoes. 
Singing, oh, dear ! etc.

THE HUNGRY NAN FROM HARLEM. 
Sung with immense success by JAMES O'NEIL. 
OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of ha 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHOLL'S. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet. 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

I_ 
THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM—Con-
cluded. 
He eat so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, 
His bones were sticking thro' his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He struck this city one fine day 
And for a 
meal he could not pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd cat, etc. 
The very first thing he chanced to meet 
'Twits a 
German Band coming down the street, 
He swallowed them all, as fast as they come, 
He chewed up the music and eat the base-drum. 
He tackled a 
crowd coming borne from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them all. 
Ile went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
He went out on election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
He met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down ; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. 
Then, gutting disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
And that's the way be used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc.

MARY ANN , 
I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
1 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half- pence and ar precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper a a 
saint, or me, or you, 
But somehow, when I 
I 
rot her round. no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all tile people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For, certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, [shout— 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar Voice N‘ ill 
cnwit -s. 
Oh ! very well, Mary Ann, 
tell your ma; 
She little thought when you came out. 3-ou'd go so far. 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you inc— 
.
-nary Ann, tie! for shame, Vali 
yith! yob! Oh! yak! 
We went last WhitsumMonday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing tirst-ciass, of course— at that I 
never fail. 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or w 
hat you might call a 
bcb, 
To h.,ek us it: a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob, 
We sat on downy cushions and the Curtains chew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not biar the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh! very well, etc. 
We 
wander'd through the forest-glades as happy as could be, 
We thought, from vulgar people there, we should at l-ast 
he free. [could hear, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
And Avhispered those son, silly things, that lovers thick so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet, and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and scaled it with a 
kiss, 
A chap, bird's-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we ( plickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry. no matter Aviai c 
we'd retain. 
My :, lary Ann declared to me she knew those pcop'e not— 
In fact, she said, she \void(' nor MiK with ;g1C1):1vul
-ar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried, 
SPOKEIN.—Oh! oh! oh! 
Oh! very well, etc.

Monarchs. 
THERE'S a 
dizzy lives in this town, 
7de's awfully " fond of hash " 
He's called the worst boitt in the West, 
And he's always on the mash. 
He has hash for breakfast, hash for dinner, 
And warmed lip hash for tea ; 
Oh, says he, how I 
wish I 
had a 
house made of hash, 
How happy I 
would be. 
CHORUS. 
He's very fond of hash. anl he never has any cash, 
And in a 
terrilile mannin. could carry the banner, 
But has no desire to see Doki!tor Tanner ; 
He never could get enough, and he thought it was 
awful tough, 
That 110 one in the city would on him take pity, 
And give him a 
good free lunch. 
This fellow would stand for hours and hems 
In the windows of a 
hashery ; 
was tha in ) 4 
d!)T-g)!1-dest crank for link 
That ever you did sec. 
IIis mammy said when he was -
young, 
he'd DCVO: Oat eake or trash, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying, " mamma, I 
want my hash." 
lie's very fonei of hash, etc. 
Oh ! this hash destroyer is now coilLnt ; 
He's got a 
red hot job, 
lIe's Ia ad hash slinger in a 
dizzy eating house, 
He is, so help me Bob. 
Where his soprituo piccolo voice is heard, 
Whila he's raking in the cash, 
A-velling out at the top of his Voice, 
With his mouth chuck full of hash. 
He's very fond of hash, etc.

THE POULTRY DEALER. 
As sung by CHAS. BAcKus at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera. House. 
Published by ( has. F. Escher, Jr., 
Girard avenue, Philadelphia. 
Mv name is Simon Cloverseed, 
I 
deal in poultry, eggs, 
I've every kind of chickens 
That ever walked on legs ; 
Such cackling you have never heard, 
And the dickens all to pay, 
When the roosters all begin to crow 
At early dawn of day. 
CHOICES. 
Such flapping, crowing, cackling, quacklin g, 
Feathers flying far and near, 
Mister Rooster flaps his wings (Crow) 
When daylight does appear. 
The Guinea-ben talks politics— 
I 
tell 
on ' tis immense— 
They have some funny arguments 
While sitting on the fence ; 
The bantam struts about and flirts 
With the pigeons in the cage, 
The turkey turns black in the face, 
And the gander's in a 
rage. " 
Such flapping, crowing, etc. 
The ducks arc tattling all the news 
About the shanghais brother, 
The goose put on her spectacles 
And went and kissed her mother 
The chickens cackled lond with joy, 
One to the other said 
Miss Malay's proud as Lucifer, 
Her first egg she has laid. 
Such flapping, Crowing, etc. 
THE THIN TAN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written for TOM IVAnFiELD, by FE.ANK DUMONT. 
THE thinnest man I 
ever saw, 
Lived over in Hoboken ; 
When I 
tell you all how thin he was, 
You'll think that I 
am joking. 
In a 
key-hole he would often creep, 
Thro' a 
sieve he'd go a 
sliding, 
But when the landlord came for rent 
In the gas pipe he'd be hiding. 
CHORLS. 
Tissue paper's very thin, 
So's a 
porous plaster, 
This man he got as thin as gauze. 
He couldn't get thin any faster. 
Tie never went out on a 
windy day, 
And when he went out alone, 
All the dogs would follow him, 
Thinking he was a 
bone. 
One night, while he was sleeping, 
The candle was burning dimly, 
A 
bed-hug grabbed him by the neck, 
And pulled him up the chimney, 
CTIORUS. 
He was as thin as milk in a 
bad hotel, 
Or the skin of a 
new potato. 
For exercise he'd take a 
dive 
Through the holes of a 
nutmeg grater. 
One day, while he was prowling, 
In a 
bakery he did go ; 
The baker threw him in the trough, 
And mixed him with the dough. 
They put him in the Oven, 
I 
tell Srort twas amazing, 
They baked him in a 
New Year's cake, 
And passed him off for a 
raisin. 
He was as thin, etc.

USED TO OWN A DONKEY. 
Words by BEN. COLLINS. 
Sung by M ANCHESTER and JENNINGg. 
I 
USED to own a 
donkey, 
A bob- tailed stubborn cuss, 
lie was born around the Spring of '49. 
His hide was full of sears 
From stopping railroad cars. 
Tie had blind staggers, he was ring-
boned, deaf and blind, 
Ile could kick like a 
steam engine, 
lie could raise you through the roof 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs. 
But lie died at half-past four, 
He has gone to that beautiful shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS . 
Davy's left the stable 
For that promised land; 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn. 
No more he'll ever chew, 
They have turned him into glue, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's departed. 
His hoof was like a 
sling shot, 
lie could drive it through a 
wall; 
he'd come into the house and kick you out of bed, 
His feet was full of bunions, 
He could eat a 
barrel of onions, 
And go to sleep standing on his head. 
He'd go in a 
saloon, stick his foot into a 
spittoon, 
Kick the bar into the street, just for a 
joke. 
When he laid down and (lied, 
All the mules in .1 
ersey cried, 
Empty is the stable, 1 :t.vy's croaked. 
CHORUS . 
lle's gone to be an angel 
With spit- curls on his brow; 
Ile died with epezoodic in the head 
lie was to go to Congress, 
With all the other mules, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's dead.

remember good old 
massa and missis. 
Den there was young Massa Charles, and 
den there wa: my wife Clohoe. 
De tears come rolling down 
my cheeks when I 
think of old times. 
Bat I 
must plod along 
to the old plawntion.

THE NIGHT THAT WE WENT BOBBING 
AFTER EELS . . 
RECITATION. 
Written and recited by JOHN F. 
W HITNEY, of the “ Novelty Four," 
in their original burletta, " Reher;:sal in the Parlor." 
I 
DON'T exactly recollect, but 'twas at the full of the MOOD, 
About three years ago in the middle of next, June, 
'That a 
gang of its assembled for to start a 
fishiur• club, 
And we elected all the officers midst a 
terrible hubbub, 
And McGowan was elected Treasurer pro tem. 
We came to the conclusion we'd go bobbing after eels, 
And for fear we'd get the cramps we took along a 
keg of 
nails. 
We started very early so as we'd not start late. 
And we lied a 
gallon demijohn marked B-A- T- E, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got near the place where we were going to bob, 
We pushed the boat about a 
mile up to our necks in mud. 
Devlin got excited and McCue was going to shoot, 
Because he had the gall to make an eel- trap of his boot, 
On the night that we went ho] dung after eels. 
McSourly, the comic singer, lie wanted to vocalize, 
But we beseeched him to desist, for us he'd paralyze ; 
But when he got about hall full he started Pinafore, 
And they threw him over the side of the boat and I 
never 
see him more, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got tired 
day ; 
Muldoon cried out 
at sea. 
I 
never got over it 
mistake. 
He gave inc an eel 
snake. 
rThisper.) On the 
of bobbing it was near the break of 
breakers ahead and swore we were out 
for a 
month, for the cook made a

RIVAL FROGS. 
Words by FRANK DU:1/0NT. 
Sang by Tall W AEFIELD. 
THERE was a 
little frog that lived in a 
swamp, 
And a 
liunkey little frog was he ; 
He'd sit on a 
stump in the glimmer of the moon, 
And wink at an owl in the tree. 
He fell in love with a 
fat widow frog, 
But a 
rival soon came around, 
A 
cross-eyed frog with corns on his feet, 
Who sang bass from a 
hole in the ground. 
This hunkey little frog soon jealous got, 
He commenced to grieve and to fret, 
For the cross-eyed frog would skirmish in the rain 
To the widow's house, you bet. 
But this frog on the log did wait one night, 
Smashed his snoot and then he dusted, 
The cross-eyed frog took a 
dose of fusil oil, 
He swelled up like a 
bladder and busted. 
The hunkey frog then went on a 
bust, 
And drank a 
gallon of lager beer, 
He got entangled and fell in a 
heap, 
For his stomach felt so queer. 
A 
big buck nigger came that way, 
And this frog be soon espied, 
He scratched on the back of his head, 
And pe2led off all his hide.

W HAT kind of garment does de wise man wear, 
To join do pilgrim band ? 
What kind of hair oil to grease your hair. 
And join de pilgrim band ? 
You must wear a

Floating on de morning breeze, 
And shake de gospel powder 
To make old Satan sneeze. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de oiler to de brimstone lake ; 
Don't stan' all day a-makin . up your mind ; 
Which road is you gwiue to take ?

Walk on, don't wait for stragglers on de way, 
For I'm going through on de telegraph note, 
To get ready for de Judgment Day. 
When Satan goes round for to collect de fares, 
I'll join de pilgrim band ; 
He'll kick you down from de slippery stairs, 
I'll join depilri in band. 
If your password ain't de right one, 
And your name ain't on de book, 
It will be too late to buzz him, 
You'll find dat you are shook.

And de oder to de brimstone lake ; 
Don't stau' all day a-makin' up your mind ;

OUR PRESIDENTS. 
Sung with great success by Tom. W ATZFIELD. 
PERHArs it may b ?, well enough 
In these the present times, 
To name our Country's Presidents 
In a 
few appropriate rhymes. 
To begin with we will take the first, 
The most highly honored one, 
The Father of our Country, 
The immortal Washington. 
Next Adams, and then came Jefferson, 
A 
statesman of high note, 
Who the immortal Declaration 
Of our Independence wrote. 
The next was Jimmy 
-Who whipped Johnny Bull, you know 
In the war of eighteen hundred twelve, 
And then came James Alonnie. 
John Quincy Adams was the next ; 
And then the old war horse, 
Bold Hickory Jackson, came along 
And showed them who was boss. 
Van Buren next hung up his hat 
On the Presidential rack ; 
But Tip and Ty came along by and by 
Ari run him off the track, 
( ) 
OUR PRESIDENTS .—Concluded. 
They served four years between them both, 
And then came James K. Polk ; 
With Taylor next, who died and left 
Fillmore to bear the yoke. 
Next Franklin Pearce beat Scott, you know, 
In eighteen fifty-two ; 
Who was followed by Buchanan, 
Who the next four years put through. 
The next was good old honest Abe, 
Who met a 
tragic end ; 
Andy Johnson took his place, 
And proved tile people's friend. 
This brings us down to U. S. Grant, 
And in summing up I 
find 
There was more stealing under him 
Than all the rest combined. 
Next Rutherford B. fell in line, 
Though put in by a 
fraud ; 
He served four years most faithfully 
And left a 
good record. 
Next James A. Garfield was the choice, 
And while ruling this glorious land, 
He was stricken down in the prime of life, 
By the assassin's.hand.

Performed with great SUCCOSS all over the 'country by BARLOW, 
W ILSON, rIZIMI,OSE & W EST'S Hui:ALOIS. 
I 
LIVED in old Virgiiny for many, many years, 
And worked among the cciton and corn ; 
Old massa he was good and kind, it tilled my eyes with 
tears, 
I 
nebber see his good old face any more. 
The rumiticum cotched me. my limbs are getting weak, 
it bent me over like the yaller corn. 
I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a

When this poor old man am dead and gone. 
De rumiticum cotehed me, my limbs are getting weak, 
It bent Inc over like the yaller corn.

When this pool: old man am dead and gone. 
Now day's do good ole missie, she was ebla•r kind to me ; 
To please her was my very heart's (

But death did know 110 tokens, it took her off one day, 
And now she living with the angels bright. 
The old plantation's changed about, the boy am gone

No more shall hoe de green and yaller corn ; 
And I

When this poor old man am dead and gone.

Now it's hard to be contented when eberything is changed : 
Old massa and missie gone from me. 
But de good book says be patient, and try and bar up 
your pains, 
And soon from toil and sorrow 
be free ; 
But here 1 
is a- n-coping in sorrow all alone, 
With no one left to cheer me while I 
stay ; 
And I 
wonder if thar's any one will shed a

When this poor old man am passed away.

KEEP STUDYING, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by FRANK DUNONT for Tom W ARFIELr, 
Now, Daniel was in the lion's den, 
And he nearly lost his breath ; 
If my mother-in-law was in that den, 
She'd talk them lions to death. 
Lot's wife was a 
trusty body, too, 
She'd go and tattle the news, 
But she was turned into a 
pillar of salt, 
Away up in Syracuse. 
What makes this earth revolve and turn, 
While ever solid on the ground ? 
It's like a 
grindstone with a 
crank, 
And niggers turning it around. 
In old Noah's ark there was a 
pair 
Of animals from land and sea ; 
Now, tell me where did he put the big winkle, 
The polecat and the flea ? 
'Who made the railroads and steam-engine. 
Who made the telegraph ? 
'Twas the man that kept a 
studying, 
You bet two dollars and a 
half. 
Who stole into that chicken- coop, 
Grabbed a 
chicken and off did run ? 
That man had better keep studying 
About that farmer's loaded gun.

Oh, yes, he did. etc. 
Now we are for glory,
