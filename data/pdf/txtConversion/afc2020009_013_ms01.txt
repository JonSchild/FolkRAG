STEPHEN CASH, Cobbler
Katy Clune  0:00
So just for the purposes of introducing ourselves for the tape, I'm Katy Clune And I'm here on 
November 16, 2020, with Julia Gartrell. And if you could introduce yourself for the tape, and 
we'll take it from there.
Stephen Cash  0:18
My name is Stephen Cash.
KC  0:21
And we're at...
SC  0:23
Oh, 2704 Hillsborough Street. Raleigh, North Carolina.
KC  0:27
Thank you. And how long have you worked for Man Mur?
SC  0:31
I've been here 37 years.
KC  0:35
And when were you born?
SC  0:36
1961.
KC  0:38
Ok, so that's a substantial amount of your career.
SC  0:44
Yes.
KC  0:45
How did you find yourself coming to the store?
SC  0:50
When I was a child, my daddy took me to work on Saturday back in the 70s. Earliest recollection 
I had was when I---- we would write dates on the bottom of she soles, and I have one here, that 
says 1971. So I started working at working. I was like, what, 10 years old. So I started working, 
and then he would rotate me with my brother every other Saturday. And then during the summer,
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
I would work every--- six days a week. And I'd get five dollars a day. And then when I was in,
probably the ninth grade, is when I got seriously more serious about working. The guy that
worked there had a heart attack, and he basically quit working. So I would come in after school,
probably 2:30. And I would work until 5:30. And then I'd work some at night. And then from
there, you just got more and more working.
KC  1:58
Was that at this location?
SC  2:00
No. We--- my daddy had, my daddy started with his brother at little five points in Durham. His,
his brother owned a convenience store and there was a shoe shop beside of him. And he went
over there. He, his brother, keep asking the guy didn't want to sell it, didn't want to sell it. So
finally one day says, "Yeah, I want to sell it". So he sold it to his brother. And his brother run it,
and my daddy had just got back from the Korean War. And his other job didn't work out. So he
went to work for his brother on the GI Bill. And from there, he bought another shop, Edgemont
and it was in the 50s. And he worked there, he owned the shop. Then he went from there to
Whelan's village, and he run that until Northgate [mall] in Durham opened. It was one of the first
seven shops that opened at Northgate. And that was in 19--- I'm gonna say 1960. So and then I
started--- my mom waited, actually waited on the front when she was pregnant with me. And so
that's how it all started.
KC  3:17
And, each of those shops your dad ran were shoe repair shops?
SC  3:22
Yes, he closed that one went to Whelans Village, run that one and open up Northgate until the
lease run out at Whelans Village. Whelans Village was pretty much going down  hill. And then
Northgate opened up he went to Northgate and it basically took off from there. And he worked
there until he's, till.... well when I graduated in 1979 I worked there probably a couple of years
and then he was saving that---- yeah when I graduate from there I worked there till he bought this
place in eighty two, and then that's when me my mama come over here in 1982. And she worked
with me, because we was like half the size.  It [the shop] was 16 foot by 60 and we, we she
worked there until basically she had lymphoma. And she quit and then Ronnie, my cousin,
worked together and then my brother....long story. But he worked for me. And then I had Liz
Ann who worked here but she--- they, all of them are lon gone. Ronnie, Gregory, my brother and
Liz Ann they've been long gone.
KC  4:36
And what are your parents names?
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
SC  4:37
His name is George Cash and her name is Helen Cash.
KC  4:43
And what would your mother do?
SC  4:45
She waited on the front. She, customers she didn't do no repair but she waited on the front.
KC  4:52
So why did you love it so much to start increasing your hours after school and come here every
day after school?
SC  5:00
That's a--- I like.... it's a good question because I don't know why I'll be honest. I like working
with my hands. I love what I do. If I was a plumber, I would be a good plumber. But this was I
reckon easy to obtain, I would say, easier. But I love working with my hands and helping people.
And I make a living at it.
Julia Gartrell 5:30
Could you describe, you said you started at around age 10? Could you describe some of the early
responsibilities you had in the shop?
SC  5:39
Goofing off, pretty much. I started shining shoes and stuff like that. And then going around the
edges of shoes, and I wanted to learn more, and my daddy would teach me more as time went on.
So it, you know, it's just kind of like you just grow into it. One thing led to another, but I wanted
to get out and do more. I want--- he didn't sell shoes at the time and I wanted to sell shoes. And
then the Frye [boot] salesman at the time, His name is Larry Coons. In fact, he owns a shoe store
on Fayetteville, he told my daddy that this place was up for sale he said I think he's ready to sell.
And we're--- the only thing we heard about this place is how good they were how big a business
they were but we come over here and it was nothing like that. So we opened up we bought him
out. My momma and daddy bought him out in 82. In July. End of June, actually beginning of
July. And aah, you know, it was a slow go from you know, the grandson of the owner was here. It
helped us kind of acclimate to the whatever. And he come over here and we--- of course he didn't
know a whole lot. But I helped him learn too and that's basically about it as far as.... any more
questions? Y'all maybe need to edit this.
KC  7:20
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
So the name Man Mur---- you bought the name as well?
SC  7:26
Well. The name comes from the bowling alley. And the original owner his name was Troy Smith.
He had the shoe shop at the bowling alley. And you can go back in the archives, in the Raleigh
archives--- guys send us pictures in his shop down the right beside of it. He showed us a picture
and it had Wachovia Bank moving down the street which they moved here, which is [now] Wells
Fargo. But he--- he had the shoe shop down in the bowling alley. They run a contest. And then
then it Man Mur Bowling. Or Man Mer Center, I don't know. But that burnt to the ground. Burnt
shoe shop up and everything. So Troy, who owned a house here and lived here, he tore his house
down and built this building. Originally it was a shoe shop, a hot dog place, the barber shop was
there. And there's several things on the end. And when that burned to the ground, he took the
name.
KC  8:33
Any idea when--- when it first opened?
SC  8:36
I don't know. I want to say, here it was nineteen fifty nine.  Down the street was--- I won't, I
won't guess is maybe in the late 40s or 40s. That's one thing I don't know. But it was down there
a while.
KC  8:54
Very cool. I like thinking you're a multi generational shoe expert. And this is a multi generational
shoe building.
SC  9:06
Yeah, it is old.
KC  9:08
So you said that you remember seeing a date because you'd find the shoe?
SC  9:14
Yeah, what we did, because, you would repair a pair of shoes. And they come back say the sole
wore out too quick. And we use a good leather. And we would, and we'd put our name on there
and sign it. And it's around here somewhere. They took it off at Northgate years ago when I was
over here. And I save it, and lord only knows, it's back there somewhere. I know I didn't throw it
away. But it had my name on it had 1971 you know, it's just something you write up under the
heel.
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  9:50
Is that like on the inside?
SC  9:52
It's on the up under, the like, a man's shoe up under when you take the heel off. Yeah, it's under
the heel. They couldn't see it. You know. So that was 1971. You know I've done this all my life
JG  10:07
So how would you say that the business has changed since you started in it? Because I imagine
there's been some, some changes.
SC  10:18
Well, shoes to me are being made cheaper and a lot more synthetic. When I started in Durham in
the 70s most shoes that you repaired men's and shoes and ladies' shoes well they were all leather.
Now you've got all kinds of synthetics urethane, plastic and it's, I wouldn't say harder, but it's
different process of repairing them. Cause back then you know you put a leather sole on it was a
leather shoe had a leather welt. And now you've got a lot of plastic and we use different glue for
attatching stuff. But you still have a lot of good shoes like Allen Edmonds, Aldens, and different
types of shoes. But the urethane, you've got to have the right equipment to put on the plastics and
stuff. And to be honest with you, we use something I would say it's super glue. To be quite
honest with you, to attach a lot of these plastic sheos urethane shoes and stuff. And then we have
like a, like on a Vibram sole like if we do a hiking boot it's--- it's called I can't think of the name
of it now but it's a different kind of glue. And then we put a chlorine wash on the Vibram rubber
sole. I don't know what it does but there's a chemical reaction to where the glue, once you do the
chlorine wash you let it dry and then you use that plastic or glue they keep--- my guy calls that
plastic but it's a different glue that you put on there then you let it dry and then you heat it up.
And then you that's with the hiking boot and then you put the Vibram sole on there. It's the only
way I know it can stick.
JG  12:36
So do things with these new materials are they breaking in different manners than they used to?
SC  12:42
No, you get a lot of shoes that are made out of urethane that they disintegrate. And like, uh, Solo
hiking boots Vasque hiking boots. You get about eight to 10 year wear. Most people are buying
them boots, they go they pay $300 for a pair of boots, they wear them one time they stick them in
the closet. Next snow we get eight or 10 years later they broke them out and the sole, the
urethane disentegrates. That's--- a lot of shoes are like that. You know Blundstone boots, ah some
of the Sanita clogs: eight to 10 years and they're about done. And shoes that are glued on now it's
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
about probably eight to 10 years the glue just does not hold the material together. It's probably,
my thing it it's probably the environment is making them change their glues
KC  13:44
You just explained why my favorite Dankso clogs from college just just like all at once just
basically fell apart.
SC  13:54
Yeah
KC  13:55
After years and years of good use
SC  13:58
Well see Sanita made all of Dansko's clogs, up probably it's been at least 15 years. And that
urethane disintegrates. The new Dans-- the new Danksos I haven't seen them do that yet. So
anyway, I'm gonna need to get a drink of water, I've never talked so much in my life. Man I just
had a girl come in here the other day. She bought a pair of Danskos that were made by Sanita.
Danso had the square on the bottom and Dankso on that. She bought a pair of green suede ones
she loved. Off of one of these  eBay's or something like that. She wore 'em one time and the
bottom disintegrated. So what I did was I took a new pair of Sanitas,  took them apart to the
bottom, the new bottom and put on her bottom. At 130 dollars.
KC  15:22
That's as much as a new clog...
SC  15:24
More.
KC  15:24
... but it wouldn't be green suede.
SC  15:30
She loved 'em.
JG  15:31
That leads to a question I always have for folks in repair industries. Which is, Do you find that
people are willing to pay a lot more to preserve something that they truly love than they might
even spend on something new or you know, what's that relationship between...?
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
SC  15:52
I reckon it depends on the person. I just took in a pair of boots today that she loved 'em, and she
wanted to get them fixed it was $80 to fix them. But she could have probably bought a pair for
$100. I don't know, I think they all need a psychiatrist. In my opinion.
JG  16:14
Then you'd be out of business!
SC  16:15
And you know you can buy--- she could have bought a new pair probably, but she loved, the, she
loved them boots and she wanted to get 'em fixed. And I can fix them and I can do a good job. I
don't like to fix something that I'm---- and I tell people this, this is going to look terrible, but
sometimes they still want them fixed.
JG  16:37
Do you think, have you seen that increase or decrease? Like people coming in with something
that they're really attached to that they want to repair versus, just a kind of everyday repair?
SC  16:50
I don't know, you hear you know, a lot of people come in here I'll say about probably half of
them they, they know the shoes not worth it but, they'll say, I love these shoes. I want to get them
fixed. You know? A lot of times I've had a person today say that. Two people.
KC  17:10
And you said you enjoy, you know, doing it well and because you can make people happy. Can
you tell us like do you have a particularly well job done? A customer satisfaction story?
SC  17:25
The girl with a green suede clogs. She was, she was really happy. A lot of people, I mean a lot of
people, you know, that get shoes fixed. That they love, love the job love, you know they just love
the shoe itself.
JG  17:46
Are there any very unusual repairs you can think of? Over the years?
SC  17:52
You probably don't want to hear this. I don't know. I just, I did repair a guy's mask one time. He
was into bondage.
KC  18:07
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
That must have been a leather mask.
SC  18:09
It was. And I did that, and I said I'll never do another one.
JG  18:17
That got a little too personal?
SC  18:18
I don't know, you know, he come to the back and he want  to put these eyelets, D rings, so it
would hold it or something. And you know, a customer come in and I know she saw him and I'm
on thinking you know what. What? I do a lot of things that I think: I wish I'd have never done
this. That was one of them. I've seen the guy yet again. See ya, yeah.
KC  18:42
Probably because your repair job was good enough!.
SC  18:47
I don't know it's probably killed him. [laughs]
JG  18:52
Your shop extends beyond shoes. I think I saw--- when I was here before I saw you taking in a
purse. Is it kind of any leather good?
SC  19:00
Yes. I mean, you know I had a lady come in the day that, uh, I got a pocketbook back  there to fix
for us, a Louis Vuitton. Honestly I think she dug out the garbage, but she wants new leather tabs
put on.  But she brought in that "Christmas vacation" but she--- it was a van. You know when
they had the tree on top of it. Well she dropped it and broke the stand off of it. And said oh, well
can you fix this? I said well might be able to but I fixed--- it's into my office now.
KC  19:38
Just out of the kindess of your heart?
SC  19:40
Yeah I reckon. Well I knew, I could probably--- I knew I could probably fix it.  I put superglue to
hold it and then I put this stuff called Tuff Toe that they use on baseball cleats. Like, like this
[demonstrates], right here. And I got brown in it so I coated the the base of it on the tree stump.
And it had these chips on I covered that up.
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  20:13
How much are you going to charge her for that?
SC  20:17
I'd like to charge her $1,000. If you want to know the truth. Causing them tubes cost about $9. I
don't know.
KC  20:28
20 bucks.
SC  20:30
I'd like to. But...
JG  20:35
Another thing we like to ask is if you have a favorite technique or favorite tool that you use?
SC  20:44
This right here. It's probably the---- I should go back there and find one I've got says 1975 on it.
JG  20:52
What is that thing called?
SC  20:53
It's called a lip knife.
JG  20:55
Ok and what do you do with it then?
SC  20:57
You cut--- see how the thing goes round there? It helps from cutting--- keeps from cutting up of
the shoe when you're goin' around a sole. And you use this. But honestly the metal in these
things is so bad that you got to constantly sharpen it.
JG  21:14
You always have one on you.
SC  21:15
Yes, I've always this. I sure have. My daddy had one, it had, ah, 1969 on and I think that he had,
that he used. He passed away September of last year, September 19. He was eighty eight. I think
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
he was eighty eight. Or he'd have been eighty eight in two months. Yeah, he had Alzheimer's. I
hope it wasn't all the glue he smelled [chuckles].
KC  21:47
Would he still come by the shop?
SC  21:52
He--- no. Well, when he was able, he would occasionally. He's about like me when I get out of
here I don't ever want to see another shoe as long as I live. I probably wouldn't even go down
Hillsborough Street. If you want to know the truth. But let me see if I can find that knife I had.
Actually it don't have blade on it. Basically, I would still use it. But what I would do is, when you
wear the blade out, you would take that nail out and stick the other blade, a new one in there, like
this. And it was getting wore out. But that's April of '75 that tells you how old I am.
JG  23:02
We'll get some pictures afterwards.
KC  23:06
Do you find you have to train your--- like develop--- keep on top of industry trends, or I don't
know watch YouTube videos to keep up with the skills needed for the types of jobs you get or is
the change gradual enough that you're just kind of always acclimating?
SC  23:30
The only thing that I've think that I've seen on YouTube is how to stretch a ladies dress boot. I
did see somebody do that. And I use that. A lot. But other than that it's kind of like, when you're
crossing the street, you jump out in the middle of the street, and then you'll then you look both
ways. It's a little late then. So I'm always doing something or finding--- finding a way to do the
job. Regardless. If I had spent $100 to get something that I will make $10 on I will. That's how I
would do it. And it don't make any sense, but that's just how I am.
KC  24:22
And how would you compare the way you work to the way you saw your father work?
SC  24:28
The same. My daddy worked six days a week for a long time. And unfortunately I'm working---
now I'm working seven days a week. I work, I get up at six o'clock. I get down here around
6:30ish and I piddle around a little bit and I just try to start work at seven. And I saw my, I saw
my daddy to do that. Day after day, and I saw him come in at one and two o'clock in the morning
because the guy who worked there, he had a heart attack. You know, it's just there's nobody to fill
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
the void. You can't find anybody to want to do this. Because, you know, everybody wants to
make more than the president. And that ain't gonna happen.
JG  25:30
What is your labor force at this point? How many people are  here?
SC  25:33
Pitiful. Pitiful. Let's see here. I got the Hernandezes. He come in probably five or six years ago---
his son come in, didn't know a word of English, and still don't know any English. But he is legal.
And he come in. And first I said, forget it, because I've already dealt with one guy. He was an
excellent shoe repairman from Florida, who come in from Cuba on the boat. But that was, ah,
you know what, I learned a little bit from him. But he wanted to take over. He made Jack Rogers
[shoes] for Jack Rogers. But he was making---- I think he was doing it on the side too. And then
they basically maybe wanted him sign a contract. He said no. I don't know what happened. But
he moved from Florida to up here. So I gave him a job. He worked here a little while until we
had a personality conflict. And I won. So he moved on. And so I was a little hesitant on Tony.
But he's, he's he's a good guy. You know, when you're dealing with somebody who come from a
whole 'nother world, and coming in here, or to the United States, it's different. You know, it's
nothing bad, but it's just different. But he, he's, he's, he's been here about five or six years. And
then I had Liz Ann, who worked here for about 15 years. And first thing I know that, you know,
she had cataracts in her eyes. She'd take a piece of paper, like this... y'all gonna have to edit all
this.  Honestly, she would look like that. So...
KC  27:33
Was she working up front or in the back?
SC  27:34
She was doing all the reps[?], riding boot zippers. It was a big help. And she was a good worker.
But she was---- her eyes got bad, and then first thing you know, she'd missed one day, she missed
one day, she missed two days. First think you know she missed three days. And then she worked
three days. And I was paying the whole, the full cause she'd been so---- I'd pay her the whole
week. But then I got to thinkin' I said you know what, she she's gone mess me up. So the
Hernandezes had a daughter. And she started working the front. And I said--- I asked her I say
you know anybody wants a job? Sew these patches on that vest right there? She said, my mama.
I say bring your mama. I say you bring your mom because Liz Ann was halfway showing up
KC  28:26
And going blind.
SC  28:27
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
And going blind.
JG  28:30
So you're just finding people from kind of word of mouth at this point is there...
SC  28:34
They come by here. I mean, I gotta help wanted sign now. If I could find someone to work the
front.
KC  28:41
Did Tony know how to fix shoes?
SC  28:43
Yes, he did. I didn't have to show him a lot.
KC  28:45
Where is he from?
SC  28:46
Honduras. And he come here legally. His son has been here for apparently a long time. And they,
they come in and then their daughter was in Honduras. They was here about a year before they
could get her here. They got one more daughter they want to bring and they're working on that
now. Which I can't blame 'em I'd want to be here to that place is terrible.
JG  29:10
So are you training people? I mean, sounds like Tony came in with some skills but is there like a,
you know---- is it just people find their way into this business? Or is there an apprenticeship-type
program or, you know--- it's not, it's clearly a booming industry still,  there's shoe shops
everywhere.
SC  29:29
Well, I don't know, be honest with ya. People who--- the best people own their own business.
Basically. Then you get some---- you got some people maybe you.... there Indians, and there's
Chiefs. I'm a chief. And then are Indians. So some people don't want the responsibility that it
takes. I mean, whe--- and then Ronnie when this COVID started, that... yeah that's my first
cousin. He's been here like he was here like 35 years. Then when his COVID started, he came in
with a runny nose. I told him he need to be tested, but this is going down a rabbit hole. Long
story short, he said he, he got tests and he had--- he didn't have it. He went out to the lake with
his girlfriend. I saw it on YouTube, I mean on Facebook. That was the end of his career. It sure
was, I've had enough. So you know, and then you get--- I got a girl wants, wants a job here. And
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
she come in, I interviewed her.  Might wanna turn this mic off. She smells like a polecat. You
know what a polecat smells like?
KC  30:55
No, I don't
SC  30:57
You don't? Well don't take a bath for about a week or two. And then she--- well I'll tell you what
the deal was: I need be paid cash. I said that don't work here. So I don't know what that was
about.
JG  31:12
So do you have any thoughts about? It doesn't sound like you're heading towards retirement
anytime soon, because you're you're a hard worker. But do you have a sense of what might
happen to the business when you retire?
SC  31:31
I don't know. But I can tell you this. I'm not going to sell this to somebody who's gonna run it in
a ditch. I will close this place up and put a big apartment building here. That's, you know, I'm not
gonna....
KC  31:47
You own the....?
SC  31:48
I own 66% of this building. And there's 33% that I don't own. But it's taken me 37 years to.... It's
been a road. It's been a ride.
KC  32:08
I mean, just how much you describe your dad moving his shop. In the early days. It's a good
position to be into.
SC  32:17
Well, let me tell you this. You can make more money in real estate than you can make anywhere.
KC  32:24
You don't have to tell the woman with the folklore degree. I'm not so good at making money.
[laughs] We might have to edit that out.
SC  32:38
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
I hope y'all do edit this out. Yeah, my plan. I don't know what my plan is. I'm 59 years old. And I
want to tell ya, life is short. And I don't want to be 75 years old, ah, cause the older you get the
less tolerance you have of people. I mean, I had a guy here Saturday, stood right there hollered at
a woman because she didn't have her mask on. Where's your mask? You know, and I was stunned
and it still bothers me because I would like to tell that guy that lady is spending seventy five
dollars in here, you didn't spend squat. And you, and you and two other customers in here, they
left because of the--- I don't know why they left they might have been ready to go. But you
know, it's like I had two ladies come in here. And she said I ain't wearing a mask. I didn't ask
them to I said I ain't wearing a mask she says: my body my choice. So you know, that's, if you---
I'm not gonna tell anybody to wear a mask. If they want to wear a mask fine. I wear one most of
the time. 99% of the time I wear one because I don't want this [COVID]. It's real. But you know
that that is real--- I'd like to honestly, I'd like to go over there and hit the guy in the head with a
hammer. For, for, just to me that was rude.
KC  34:04
Well it feels like this is your space.
SC  34:06
It is. It's my store, my house, I set the rule. That lady was in her 70s. She put her mask on. You
know just, you know, she handled it right. I just I didn't say nothing. But I wanted to. It's very,
very I don't know it's a touchy situation. It's just best not say nothing and let him go on. You
know cuz he's not the mask police. You know, there's some people who will wear 'em and
there's--- the most people wear 'em.
KC  34:42
But you brought that up to say, like as a reflection of just, it's another layer of hardness on
already a pretty hard job.
SC  34:55
Yeah, you know, it's just, I don't know. It's you know, you see, a lot of people don't understand
is--- my wife, I've been married to her for 20 some years, she she don't understand what it takes
to run a business. Alright, I get up in the morning, I come to work, alright, I pay the bills, alright.
I make sure the bills are paid, I write the paychecks. You know, and I'm responsible for these
people that are working here. And I'm responsible for the world. You know, the guy at the front
says, you know, well sonny do something for yourself. I said these shoes ain't gonna be fixed by
themselves. And when you get people breathing down your neck on a pair of shoes when they
can buy a new pair of shoes, it's ridiculous. But they they want their shoes.
KC  35:46
So back to the psychiatrist comment.
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
SC  35:49
Yeah. You know, they're, they're shoes.
KC  35:54
I mean, besides the economic reality of you have to do this, where do you find the joy in it?
When it feels its best. Like where are your moments of satisfaction and...?
SC  36:09
When you finish--- when you finish something. When you, like I had a guy he had he had six
pair of shoes, ladies shoes that he brought in for his wife.  Had six pair of shoes it won't a big
job. Heels and insoles and stuff like that. And then he comes in, he left them two or three days
ago. But he comes in with two more pair. You know, and I did,  I've done all of them today.
KC  36:37
What did he need done on all these shoes?
SC  36:39
Heels, heels and insoles one pair. And just I mean, something probably should have been some
of em should have been thrown in the garbage. But...
KC  36:54
But then you'd go out of business.
SC  36:55
Oh, I wouldn't either [chuckles]. No.  But yeah, at one time, that--- I had boxes, I got one box of
shoes right there to be fixed [points at area with cardboard boxes]. I had boxes from this counter,
just like that, slammed full of shoes from there, all the way back to the slat wall. And I had that
shelf of men shoes fixed. I was out over....
KC  37:22
Why, because of  COVID?
SC  37:22
No, that was before COVID. I was out, like I said over a m--- it was over, it's probably six
weeks. So and when you're---- and then you get people calling in: Whe-where my shoes? My
shoes have been there so and so. You know, we hadn't told them it'd be over a month. And then
you'd have to dig through these boxes and find them. I tell people's work in the front. Because I
had like, I had Shirley, Robert, Ronnie and me that went on the front. That's four people wait on
the front. And I tell em to find this and when you find it there, I'm gonna fix them. And I would
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
fix them. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. You know, you'd stop what you're doing. Said I'm
gonna fix these shoes and get rid of them shoes, and out the door. You know that, to me tha'ts
stress. You know, when you....
KC  37:29
Is there a type of repair where people bring it in, and you just roll your eyes because it's like,
same old thing I have to do this again or....?
SC  38:26
No. I put thousands of ladies heels on, you know, over and over and over and over again. Then
you, you know I got pair of Louis Vuittons, that I put the red sole on you get--- you know you do
that. I mean, as my daddy said, if you don't do it, they'll find somebody else that will.  So that's
why he done everything. That's why I do everything that is, you know, some things are just
impossible to fix. It's just, you know, it's just impossible. The Pope can fix it. That's what I tell
them.
JG  39:05
So you're, I think you, you were saying that moment of joy is in the conclusion. So you like the
process and then having it kind of....
SC  39:15
Once you get through with it, it's like instant gratification. It's like, well, like like you get
somebody come in there that says I want heels on here. If I say if you can wait, you know, a few
minutes I can have this done. Or a rip, or something I can do real fast and get 'em out the door.
You know, the, you know, the more you fix the more money you make.  That's--- you know, and
if youcan do something within like five minutes and charge $10 or $12 or whatnot. And, and that
way it saves them a trip back and you don't have to write a ticket for it. You don't have to write it
in the book, you know, then you don't you don't have to call 'em, you know when they're ready
you don't have to call 'em up. Put 'em in a bag, look for 'em. You know.
KC  40:03
Because there's other jobs you lose money because it takes way longer than you thought.
SC  40:06
Yes. Well, yeah, well what I tell somebody---- Liz Ann who used to work here, I said, basically
my time's free cause I don't make a paycheck. You know, stuff that I do it's---- it ain't free but
you know what I mean it's, it's it's pretty much free If you can understand that, because I don't
draw a paycheck.
JG  40:33
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
How do you stay afloat personally?
SC  40:35
Well I do but.... I don't, I don't like---- I don't say you know, I made $500 this week you know or
whatever you know what I mean?
KC  40:45
Yeah.
SC  40:47
Yeah, I've made the least amount of money that I made forever in the last---- since this COVID
KC  40:54
Even with fewer people on the payroll?
SC  40:57
Yeah. Well, I got the PPP [Paycheck Protection Program], which I wished I never got, but I got
it. And I'm trying to, I'm getting out of it now.
KC  41:09
And why is that?
SC  41:10
I don't know, they could draw unemployment.
KC  41:12
Right and then they make more and don't come back?
SC  41:15
Right, yeah. Well I don't know. You know the Hernandezes you know, when they--- I paid them
six, ten weeks, he worked four days in 10 weeks. Then he got the COVID he was out of work for
three weeks. I said you know, I'm out of this PPP. You need to draw unemployment. He said he
was denied. But I think it was didn't do it right.
JG  41:36
It's pretty complicated honestly
SC  41:40
You believed me if I had to--- I can't draw unemployment. I mean,  I won't closed. I was here
every, every day I closed early one day at five o'clock.
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  41:49
You haven't seen a trend of people, like, being in their house and looking through all their clothes
and their shoes and finding you know stuff and bringing it in?
SC  41:58
Some people.
JG  41:59
So like some people are doing that and [inaudible]
SC  42:01
Some people. It's some--- I think some, honestly, I think some people feel sorry for me and bring
they shoes in.
KC  42:07
I don't think people are that kind [laughs]
SC  42:11
If they do. I think they're worried I'm gonna go out of business.
JG  42:14
Well do you have long standing customers that are very loyal?
SC  42:17
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got people that been coming in here for years,
KC  42:21
So are those the people coming in to [inaudible]
JG  42:27
Random people that walk by [laughter]
SC  42:29
Well I had a girl I ain't seen her in a while, she brought in four pair of boots, actually she brougt
in three pair of boots to be shined. In a couple hours later, she comes in with another pair to be
shined. So, and I aint seen her in, well since this COVID you know it sstarted about March. You
know I could tell a difference in business when it's in March.
KC  42:50
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Do you ever get sick of dealing with the public?
SC  42:53
All the time. In fact, I'm right sick of people. In general. I'm about like the guy was in the--- y'all 
need to edit this--- it was in, definitely need to edit this. This is off the record.
KC  43:12
Oh you made it official!
[redacted at request of interviewee]
KC  43:43
So, we're getting close to last questions, but I have to go all the way to the beginning for this one. 
Where---- where where are your parents from like, from right around the Raleigh area?
SC  43:54
No my mom and daddy's from Durham. Yeah, my momma's, my momma's daddy was Douglas 
Massey. And they lived--- they were farmers. And his mom and daddy actually had tenant 
farmers but they was on---they lived on Fayettville Road in Durham. You know where the Lowes 
is at and all that. They oww-- her, her daddy's daddy they owned all that land in there. They 
actually, they probably sold most of it within the last five, six years. They ain't get no the money 
from it. But that's where they're from. And my daddy---- I don't know where, I think he was from 
maybe, I don't know, he was from Durham. His daddy worked at the Liggett Myers.
KC  44:45
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
And so he got into shoe repair cause he worked forhis brother on the GI Bill?
SC  44:50
Yes.
KC  44:51
Ok.
SC  44:51
He actually was a carpenter. And they didn't, you know they--- my mama was a strict church
person and didn't believe in working on Sunday. And they was gonna build houses on Sunday
and daddy didn't show up. Next day daddy come work on Monday, nobody knew him. He said I
picked my tools and left. And that's how he got into shoe business. And shoe repair people are,
are--- I'm not this way. But shoe repair, he started working at the shoe shop at little five points in
Durham and the guy there that was repairing the shoes, and daddy asked him a question he says
you trim the heel? Guy looked at him, said, Well, if you don't know you don't know. He would---
he didn't want to tell my daddy how to do it, 'fraid he'd take his job. So from then on daddy says I
learned how to do it. But it's--- to me, why would you keep somebody from knowing something?
It they're teaching him something that could help you out? So, but to me that ain't make any
sense. And the same guy, the grandson who worked here, his name was Oliver Thompson, the
third.
KC  46:03
The grandson of the owner.
SC  46:04
Uh huh. His name was Oliver Thompson the third. They had a guy who worked in.... his daddy
tought--- his grandpa taught economics over here. And bought this shoe shop and he run it----
my momma and daddy bought it from him---- he run in til he was in his 80s. But the shoe repair
person he didn't want to tell Oliver everything in here. Because if he wouldn't have a job, it's just
nuts.
KC  46:30
And then Oliver came back when you [inaudible]
SC  46:33
Oliver was here when we bought place. He worked for momma and daddy because he didn't
know a lot. So he, he worked here with me. And he worked on Saturdays, and well, everyday, he
worked on Saturday. He was in prison for drugs after he was here about two or three months. It's
his second trip to Central Prison. And he got out, we got him out on work release. He was a good
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
worker when his own work release. But he would come in here and work. But he, he had--- he
also had a, he had a drinking problem and a drug problem. And so finally, you know, I called him
on it. Cause I didn't know I mean, I was like 21 years old. Sheltered pretty much all my life. And
he come in here and some days he would talk. You couldn't get him to shut up. You could not, I'd
say now what I said there's just something different. He was on speed. I finally figured it out. But
he--- I talked him into, there was a shoe shop for sale in Cary, which is still named Oliver shoe
repair. And he bought that. And he got out of here. But he still comes in here.
JG  47:48
Sounds like it's been quite a journey.... with the social side.
JG  47:52
I could write a book. I could. I could write a book on the ---- my brother and my cousin who
worked here. I could.
KC  48:03
Your said your brother was the one who would usually take the interviews or that was Ronnie?
SC  48:07
That was Ronnie. Uh, Ronnie [holds up a photo] that's Ronnie. That's Ronnie. I had the
Blundstone lady come in and took a bunch of pictures and she framed 'em and send 'em to us.
But that's my brother. That's Ronnie, course that's me.
KC  48:33
How many years ago was that?
SC  48:34
It won't that long ago. My brother went off the deep end. So that's a whole nother--- that's a book.
Oh my, this is a pitc[ture]--- that's my daddy. That's his obituary. And this, I had this when I was
the only one here, metal package. This is my daddy. Right here. That right there. This was when
he was at Northgate. This was something that he did about orthopedic work 19, that's 1957. In
fact, I got the, the papers if we bought the shoe the first shoe shop for $500. Edgemont Shoe
Shop.
JG  49:42
Any more questions Katy?
KC  49:43
afc2020009_013--Stephen Cash  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
I always like to end with asking the interviewee if there's anything else that you want to share,
either about your experience or to help people understand the shoe repair business, who might
stumble across this interview.
SC  50:03
I have no idea. I mean, I don't know.
JG  50:06
Fair enough.
SC  50:07
You know? Just only thing I do is one day at a time, one shoe at the time and hope I can--- I hope
I live long enough to retire at least two weeks. Before I keel over [laughs].
