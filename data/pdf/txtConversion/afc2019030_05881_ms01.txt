LG: 
At the University of Utah Neuro-Psychiatric Institute. So, thank you for agreeing to do an 
interview. And you know you’re being recorded, and we have permission to deposit this 
recording, unless stated otherwise down the line? 
 
JB: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Okay. Okay, well if you could just kick us off by talking a little bit about your medical 
background and training – where you went to medical school and residency, and all of 
that? 
 
JB: 
I went to medical school at Dartmouth, and I then did my training in a Triple Board 
Program at Brown University, which is a program in Child Psychiatry, Adult Psychiatry, 
as well as Pediatrics; and you kind of get all of those together, at once: all those 
specialties. So, you can go into anything, but I ended up going into psychiatry, with a 
good background in Pediatrics.  
 
LG: 
Nice. Can you give me the years for what years you did you’re –  
 
JB: 
Sure. 
 
LB: 
Medical schooling? 
 
JB: 
I did medical school from 1999, through 2000 – sorry, no that’s wrong. 
 
 
I did medical school from 1995 through 2000; during that time, I took a year off and I 
was doing some research on smoking cessation. I went to Russia and learned about 
Russia, but also brought a smoking cessation program over there. So, that was my time in 
medical school.  
 
 
 
And then in 2000, I went to residency at Brown, in Providence, Rhode Island. And I was 
there until 2005. 
 
LG: 
Okay, thank you. And was there a fellowship after that? 
 
JB: 
Nope; that included the fellowship. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LB: 
How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
[02:02] 
 
JB: 
Well I think it started when I used to be a ski racer when I was a little kid, and wanted to 
be in the Olympics. But then I found out that you didn’t get paid to be in the Olympics. 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 3 
 
So I decided I needed to get paid to earn a living in life. And I think I was like six or 
seven years old at the time.  
 
 
 
But in addition to that, my grandfather was a physician, and he was a general practitioner 
when they still had that title: GP. He was a physician when there were still swamps in 
Brooklyn, New York (and that’s where I’m from, is Brooklyn, New York). And we 
would spend weekends talking about his patients.  
 
 
 
He (when I knew him) was a psychiatrist. And so we would spend time fishing, and just 
talking about his patients – whether it was medical or psychiatric. And I just learned 
about it. I didn’t think I would be a psychiatrist, I thought I was going to be a 
pediatrician. But then, as time went on I realized I really wanted to be a psychiatrist, and 
that’s what I went into medical school wanting to be: is a psychiatrist. 
 
 
In medical school I found out that I wanted to learn more about the medical side of 
things, and that’s why I became a pediatrician as well as a psychiatrist. But the 
development of my interest was (obviously) my grandfather, and then just my propensity 
to science and math – those things interested me.  
 
 
And then the difficulty I had around history and English. I actually have a learning 
disability, and so those things took me – they were very difficult for me. But I also read 
very slowly; so, that was an additional hurdle to overcome. 
 
[04:02] 
 
LG: 
Do you remember any of those stories your grandfather told you? 
 
JB: 
Oh, yeah – I remember a story about a patient who almost completed his doctorate in 
neurobiology, but he was schizophrenic and so he couldn’t finish. And the story was that 
he believed that people were telling him things that they really weren’t. That they were 
coming down on him, that he was a bad researcher [laughs], that he was a bad 
neurobiologist. And he couldn’t overcome that. So he was something like two or three 
credits away from that, from finishing up. And it was very interesting. 
 
 
 
My grandfather was unusual in that there was once a family friend who had 
schizophrenia, and he brought that person into his home, to live with, because wanted 
that person to be successful. So I knew that person was schizophrenic, and I was able to 
understand who they were. And it was interesting, I had an early propensity towards 
being able to interact with people with disabilities and mental illness. 
 
 
I remember specifically realizing that I should just treat this kid (it wasn’t a kid – I’m 
thinking back to who he was [laughs], because I’m older) – but I remember thinking (at 
the time) this young man (24 years old), and I was only probably 12 or 13, that I was – I 
was just pretending he was like any other person.

And that’s actually what I actually continue to do with, today. These people are any other 
people, they just have some disease, just like we all do – whether it’s a foot injury, or a 
broken arm, or high blood pressure. 
 
[06:11] 
 
LG: 
Nice, nice. 
 
 
 
For people who don’t know, what’s medical school like? 
 
JB: 
I guess for me it was probably the closest approximation to hell that I could imagine 
[laughs]. Because I’ve never been to hell but I feel like I was there already. Some people 
feel that residency and internship is the closest approximation, but for me, it was medical 
school. 
 
 
There was just a volume of information. And I’m not sure if you’ve come across this 
statement before, but they describe medical school as opening up a fire hydrant and 
trying to take a sip. It’s just an overwhelming amount of information. And most people 
who go to medical school have gone through other schooling, recognizing and learning 
just about everything that a course has to offer, right? That’s how they succeed.  
 
 
It’s not even close to possible in medical school and that takes an adjustment. The 
amount of time you spend reading and learning and all of that is tremendous – it’s a lot of 
time. And it’s a lot of sit down on your own, alone time, doing that. 
 
 
There was plenty of time to do other things (not plenty) – there is time to do other things, 
like workout [clock chiming] and be energetic, etc. But unfortunately, just there’s a lot of 
time spent on studying and pressure on exams and getting through. 
 
 
 
I think residency is a little different in that it’s a lot of physical energy, as well as mental. 
But the physical energy (for me) kept me going, so I could use my mental energy. 
Because I had to go from one thing to the other.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit – what you mean by the physical part? 
 
JB: 
Literally, physically going from one part of the hospital to the other, to doing physical 
examinations, to looking up laboratory – to moving, and actually physically moving and 
having to stay up for hours on end.  
 
 
I was in residency before the work hour limits. So I was on every two days – I wouldn’t 
sleep for 24 hours. That would go on for a month or two at a time. And that sort of 
energy, to me, the physical energy output allowed me to stay cognizant of my 
surroundings and aware of them.  
 
 
I saw a lot of errors in that time – people making errors. I remember backing into a lamp 
post that I don’t think I would ever do if I wasn’t exhausted. 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 5 
 
 
[09:30] 
 
LG: 
When you say “on every two days,” can you explain, for people who don’t know, what 
that means? 
 
JB: 
Yeah, so I would have a shift that I’d be on call. So, I would start at six or seven in the 
morning, and then I would be on overnight – so, I would continue through the night. And 
then, you have a regular day the next day, so you go until six o’clock.  
 
 
So, that right there is from six a.m. one day to six p.m. the next day. You get off, you go 
to sleep, and then you come on and you have a regular day: six a.m. to six p.m. The 
following day you could have a regular day, or you could go again, from six a.m., 
through the next day to six p.m. So, it was a lot of fatigue. 
 
 
So, Monday morning you’d show up at six a.m., and you’d get off at Tuesday at six p.m. 
– and you’d be on the whole time. Then Wednesday, you’d be on from six a.m. to six 
p.m. (about, sometimes later). Thursday, sometimes you’d actually be on at six a.m., and 
then you’d be working again until Friday at six p.m. So, that would be every other day, or 
every two days – in that case you’d start again on Saturday and go through Sunday. 
 
LG: 
How did you survive that? 
 
JB: 
I think one of the things that we all go through (and I’ve found) is that we all just get it 
done. We just rise to the occasion, or lower ourselves [laughing] to the occasion, as the 
case may be.  
 
 
I always talk about people who have to do homework, and they’ve got it done. And the 
homework just keeps on increasing as you go through school, and you just keep working 
on it and just get it done.  
 
[11:36] 
 
 
You know, I knew I was there to work, and I had to work and learn while I worked. So, I 
just did it. And there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, it’s just really tiny. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
It’s really far away. 
 
LG: 
People always tell crazy stories about residency and that period of their training – what’s 
an example of something crazy that happened during your residency training? 
 
JB: 
So, are you referring to something crazy, as in a medical thing that came up, medically 
crucial? Or just funny, hilarious? 
 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 6 
 
LG: 
Whatever you want to tell – funny, hilarious is fine. 
 
JB: 
So, one of the funniest things that occurred was there was one of our residents got called 
– we were doing the neonatal rotation where you’re in the NICU, so intensive care unit 
for premature babies, and also you covered the newborn nursery (in case there was 
something urgent that occurred).  
 
 
But then there was this area in the basement of this hospital, called the ABC, which was 
the Alternative Birthing Center. And it was a black hole; we didn’t know what was 
exactly going on there, because it was an alternative birthing center.  
 
 
So, in the regular newborn nursery we knew what was going on, we might get a head’s 
up that there was a breech baby (coming out feet first), so that we knew that there might 
be a C-section, or there might not. So, we were aware of what was going on as residents 
and doctors.  
 
 
[Laughs] But down in the ABC, you had no idea what was going on. I mean, that was, 
you know – doctors were taboo, almost, down there. 
 
 
Well if you get called down there, it’s pretty scary, because it could be anything. And the 
resident was called down to the Alternative Birthing Center. So we ran down the stairs, 
and he threw open the doors, and he took three steps, and he said, “What the hell?” He 
couldn’t help himself. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
JB: 
And there was the mother, naked (obviously), the baby, naked, and the father, naked –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
JB: 
And he couldn’t comprehend. And the guy said, “Well I thought it was only fair.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Oh, my god! 
 
JB: 
That was one funny –  
 
LG: 
Awkward [laughs]. 
 
JB: 
Funny example of something that happened during residency. 
 
LG: 
During residency. 
 
 
 
So, you said you knew you wanted to go into psychiatry –  
 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 7 
 
JB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
From the beginning of medical school? 
 
JB: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about what it’s like to be a psychiatrist, and about your job now? 
 
JB: 
Yeah. What it’s like to be a psychiatrist – I think that there’s a lot of time spent talking to 
patients – more than in any other field. We don’t double-book our patients, right? We 
don’t have five-minute appointments – we have to see the patient for however long we’re 
seeing them: an hour, sometimes a half an hour, for unfortunate situations, sometimes I 
see them for 15 minutes. Unfortunate, meaning for the physician, because that’s not ideal; 
but there’s an incredible need for psychiatrists.  
 
[15:25] 
 
 
So, you learn a lot about patients and their lives, and who they are, and what they’re 
doing. It’s important to know about that. We look at three realms, probably, more than 
anybody else, which is the biologic:  
 
 
So, the medications, maybe some genetic disorders, or maybe it’s just a genetic 
propensity (or what we call diathesis), which would lead them to be depressed, or 
psychotic, or schizophrenic, or you name it. So, that’s the biologic side of it, like any 
doctor would do. There are also some biologic reasons for why people get depressed, or 
have other issues.  
 
 
Then there’s the psychologic, which you would also expect, which is the actual 
depression, or the anxiety, or the fear that someone’s experiencing, or the post traumatic 
stress. 
 
 
And then the third area that we look at is the social. And the social is what’s the 
environment that the person is in? Can they afford to live? Are they unemployed? Do 
they have housing? Do they have a relationship? Is that relationship okay?  
 
 
So, while I think family docs or internal medicine docs are probably the closest to that, as 
well as pediatricians – that’s our focus, is doing all three of those. And I think that’s a lot 
different than a lot of the other specialties.  
 
 
I also think it’s really interesting to find the common threads but also the uniqueness of 
the individual, and you get to learn about who they are, and what has made them who 
they are. And then give them some sort of a direction to go for them to help themselves – 
that’s important.  
 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 8 
 
 
I find that most people you can have an impact on an individual encounter. And I don’t 
know that I find that as often in other fields. I mean, even if you were to do surgery on 
somebody, they’re still recovering. You set their broken arm, they still have to recover. 
 
[17:41] 
 
 
I think if I interview with a patient and they’re in a very low and down place, that at the 
end of that interview they can come away with something that may have provided them 
some degree of change. And so, I think that is a little difference there. 
 
 
 
I don’t think it’s for everybody. Not everybody likes to spend that time; not everybody 
has that patience – I may be losing my patience, I’m not sure. But that’s something that I 
think people come to if they feel comfortable with that. 
 
 
In this day and age there’s a lot of doctors – I should say medical students who are 
wanting to do that now: who are wanting to go into psychiatry; it’s become a very big 
field.  
 
 
One of the statements is that psychiatry is the new derm –  
 
LG: 
Oh, really? 
 
JB: 
Psychiatry is the new dermatology – dermatology was very big, and it’s very competitive. 
Psychiatry is getting about as competitive. 
 
LG: 
Interesting. 
 
JB: 
There are so many people wanting to go into it because the lifestyle can be very nice, as 
well; it just depends on what you go into.  
 
 
I’ve been in a lot of different areas of psychiatry. So after my residency I started out in 
inpatient child; then I traveled – I wanted to travel a lot. I wanted to – I enjoy traveling (I 
have a little bit of a wanderlust). I don’t have a family. 
 
 
And so, I was in Rhode Island, and I was doing my child inpatient as an attending 
physician. And I decided I wanted to see what Oregon was like. I had never been there, 
didn’t know anybody there. So, I went to Oregon and got a job as an adult psychiatrist.  
 
 
And that was really enjoyable, and I was able to enjoy myself there and have a good job 
(for a while). I spent about six months there, to a year (I can’t remember exactly now) 
[laughs]. 
 
 
And after that I went to Montana, and I worked in a residential treatment center – a 
residential treatment center for children and adolescents. This was a place where people 
go (kids go) who are having problems. Usually they have problems such as severe 
depression, anxiety (with or without drug use), and often behavioral problems that mean 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 9 
 
that they can’t live at home. And it’s just something that they need to be in supervision 
24/7. So I worked there for another year, enjoyed that.  
 
 
And then I went to Colorado, and I worked in private practice in Colorado, for about 
eight or nine years. Which was very enjoyable – I got to ski 60 days a year, and that was 
great. I saw outpatient – I worked in a very small town of only about 6,000 people (the 
whole valley only had 40,000 people).  
 
[20:43] 
 
 
So that was a really interesting experience: rural medicine and rural psychiatry – it’s way 
different. And you walk down the street and five out of ten people you see, you know. 
You’re sitting with a patient who is complaining about somebody – they leave, and that 
person they’re complaining about, essentially –  
 
LG: 
Comes in? 
 
JB: 
Comes in next. So, it’s funny. It’s interesting – you really are like a small-town doc: you 
know everything, but you also know everything. So, that’s the good and bad of it. 
 
 
So, I’ve always loved teaching, because I used to be a school teacher before medical 
school. So, I really always loved teaching. And I got to the point where skiing 60 days a 
year and biking 80-100 miles every few days was not enough –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
JB: 
I wanted to do more. And I started to enjoy – and I’ve always enjoyed teaching, so I 
started to look for an academic position. And there were a couple places – I went back to 
my alma mater, actually (back to Dartmouth) where they offered me a position up in New 
Hampshire. And I thought that would be great, but I looked around and thought to 
myself, “Gosh, I remember these mountains were a lot larger when I was in college.” 
[Laughing] 
 
LG: 
It’s because you spent a lot of time in Colorado [laughs]. 
 
JB: 
I did; I spent a lot of time in Colorado. So I ended up here, where I could still enjoy 
myself, in Utah. 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Clearly, this is a challenging environment to work in. Can you talk about some of the 
most difficult challenges in your current work? 
 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 10 
 
JB: 
Yeah. So, there’s a lot of suffering that comes through here; a lot of suffering. There is 
suffering just from mental illness alone – whether that’s depression, or anxiety, pure 
sadness, schizophrenia – suffering that the families experience, but also the patients in 
schizophrenia.  
 
 
But there’s a lot of additional suffering beyond that – whether it’s financial: people living 
in cars, they don’t have enough money to see a dentist, and they’re losing their teeth. 
Sometimes they don’t have enough money for clothes because of the family situation.  
 
[23:25] 
 
 
There’s abuse, trauma – like severe trauma. Trauma to the point at times, where I won’t 
even let my medical student take the patient, because it’s such – I don’t want them 
exposed to that. If they decide to go into it, they’ll get exposed to it; but they don’t need 
to be exposed to that – people don’t need to be exposed to that. 
 
 
Things you don’t want to tell your loved ones. I’m a huge animal lover, and I have a lot 
of difficulty with people who abuse animals. In fact, our program is very good here and 
we have great colleagues, and they know that about me. So they avoid giving me people 
who have hurt animals – at least, that’s what their intention is. But sometimes it happens, 
and you have to deal with it. 
 
 
But there is a tremendous amount of suffering that goes on here.  
 
LG: 
And how do you then respond to that as a physician, given that it’s part of your job to try 
to help that in some kind of way? That sounds difficult. 
 
JB: 
Yeah, I feel there are different ways people deal with that. So, some people deal with that 
by talking to their colleagues about what they’ve been through. Some people talk to their 
loved ones – which is hard, because they have to mind what they say. Some loved ones 
are fine with talking about it, I think; others, you can’t talk fully about, you know, who 
that is, what’s going on – the actual what you’ve experienced or know. And you have to 
do it in such a way that you’re not breaking HIPPA – which usually isn’t a big deal, in 
terms of being able to do that. 
 
[25:28] 
 
 
Some people talk to therapists, like I said (did I say that?) [laughs] –  
 
 
 
So, some people talk to therapists about it. Some people deal with it by having a degree 
of separation – like you’ve really got to leave this stuff at work; you’ve really got to have 
the ability to leave it at work and go home and do whatever you want to do. Because it’s 
going to eat you alive if you don’t – it will eat you alive. 
 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 11 
 
 
I had a great friend in residency and she was in the program with me (in the Triple Board 
program). And we were doing pediatrics and everything was fine and then we did the part 
(which was psychiatry), and she got really down. She couldn’t leave it at work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
JB: 
She took that home with her. And it was constant, 24/7 for her. And it really affected her, 
and she just decided, “I can’t do this.” And so she stayed in pediatrics. [Laughs] The 
funny part is that she went into pediatric neuro-oncology, which is child brain tumors and 
death –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
JB: 
All over the place [laughs]. But that’s something she could separate from herself; it still 
affects her, but it something that she could separate from herself and be able to do her 
job.  
 
LG: 
I wonder if that was because it was more biological, in some ways? 
 
JB: 
It could have been more biologic, and it could have been maybe something that she had 
not experienced in life. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
JB: 
Also, there is a separation from there.  
 
 
And then there’s always – there’s anger. I sometimes get really angry at the insurance 
companies. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[27:29] 
 
JB: 
So, I will – I mean the absurdity of what they do is insane, in terms of you know, kicking 
people out of the hospital. They say they’re not doing it because they’re not discharging 
them; but it’s the same thing when you stop paying for their care.  
 
 
But that being said, I will get very angry at the insurance companies [laughs]. I’ll really 
push the ancillary services, social services if they’re not doing their job. So, I think I can 
take it out on [laughs] on them, as one possibility. 
 
 
I exercise a lot, and I change my focus: I distract myself, and I do some sort of activities, 
hobbies, things like that.  
 
 
And then of course, there’s humor. There’s just the humor part of things. And there’s 
some really good – there’s some good humor, good jokes that are out there, and there is 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 12 
 
also some pretty risqué humor, too, that I think might be on the edge. But when you’re in 
such an acute situation, sometimes that’s what’s needed to break the tension and kind of 
let it have a release.  
 
 
Most of the time, the humor I find is related to the idea of caring. So we care so much 
that there is this opposite, like this concept of joking around like you don’t care – but you 
do: you clearly do care. 
 
 
So, that’s (I think) most of the humor that I experience.  
 
LG: 
Can you give an example that you’d be willing to share? 
 
[29:30] 
 
JB: 
I’m trying to think of one that I would be willing to share [laughs]. I guess, I can’t think 
of any right now. 
 
LG: 
Okay. One of the things I am – I am sitting in your office and looking at all of these –  
 
JB: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Costumes that you have, and that seems to be related to humor a little bit – can you talk 
about your costumes? 
 
JB: 
Yeah. So, I am a child psychiatrist – I see children only in this hospital. And I wear hats 
everyday (or almost every day) for the kids. And they think I’m weird, they think I’m 
funny – if they think I’m weird, they still think I’m funny. I tell terrible jokes.  
 
 
I feel like all these things allow me to connect with the patients, at least to let them feel 
more at ease. And if they feel more at ease, then they’re more likely to open up, and I’m 
more likely to find out what’s really going on and what I can really help with.  
 
LG: 
Do you have a favorite hat? 
 
JB: 
I think my hat that is a pink pig with wings is my favorite hat. And you put a string under 
your chin, and when you open your mouth, the wings flap. And it’s supposed to be “when 
pigs fly.” So, if a patient asks me for something, I’ll say, “Oh, you can get it; you can get 
that when,” and I’ll just start opening and closing my mouth – and it’s supposed to 
indicate “when pigs fly.” 
 
 
I think sarcasm is another funny one. I often am sarcastic, or I’ll often be somewhat 
humorous with them (especially the kids), where they’re always asking, “When can I go 
home? When can I go home? When can I go home?”

And I’ll say – if it’s let’s say, July 4th, I’ll say, “How does Christmas sound?” And 
[laughing] they’re like, “What?! No, I don’t want to,” and so, anything, actually, after 
that sounds a lot better. 
 
[31:40] 
 
 
And so, and then often I’m like, “Well, are you ready to stay another two weeks, or three 
weeks, until Christmas?”  
 
 
So, it’s fun, and they laugh, and I’ll tell really bad jokes (“dad” jokes) – and they think 
it’s stupid, but they all smile and laugh. 
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LB: 
Of course. That’s cute. 
 
 
What does it mean to be responsible for a patient? (For people, again, who are not 
familiar with medicine, as a field.) 
 
JB: 
You are responsible for multiple aspects of a person’s life. I think in psychiatry, one of 
the hard things is that you’re having to evaluate a person’s level of safety. And so, if I see 
a patient, and they’re talking about suicide – what’s the point at which I decide that they 
are not safe to go home, and I have to ask them to go to the hospital? And if they won’t, 
then I have to make them go to the hospital. So, there is a level of responsibility there for 
someone else’s life, and whether they live or die. 
 
 
In psychiatry, that means (usually) whether they take their own life, or they take the life 
of someone else. And there is no certainty, no really good certainty in psychiatry. If a 
person doesn’t want to tell you, they’re not going to tell you. If a person really wants to 
kill themselves, they’re going to kill themselves.  
 
 
And I think one of the most important things about suicide is for people to recognize 
what they leave other people with. That is overwhelming. And whether it’s the person 
who kills themselves and their family is distraught, their kids are distraught, their 
siblings, their relatives are distraught – which also increases their first-degree relatives’ 
risk of committing suicide as well.  
 
 
But also, colleagues, and friends and all these other people. There was a person that 
stepped in front of a bus to kill themselves. And that bus driver came to see me (when I 
was in private practice), he was distraught – absolutely distraught. And he could not 
work.  
 
 
And I think those are the things that are hard to do when you’re suffering individually – 
to think of someone else. One of the analogies I like to give is if you have the flu, and

you just won’t even get out of bed to go make yourself some food: you’re feeling so bad, 
but if a child asks you for food, or your pet needs to be fed, or a best friend asks you for 
something that’s very important in their lives, some time – you can rise to the occasion 
for somebody else. And that’s, I think, an important thing for people to be aware of, and 
to think about the other people.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
JB: 
So, I think there’s a lot more aspects to being responsible for someone’s life, but I do 
think there’s also responsibility that people have for themselves, as well. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; um-hmm. 
 
[35:36] 
 
JB: 
And there’s only so much we can do.  
 
LG: 
How do you think not just psychiatry, but medicine (broadly) – physicians are, to some 
degree anyway, responsible for the patients’ health and safety (as we’ve been talking 
about) – how do you think that affects, or in what way might that affect their views on 
death? 
 
I’ve had physicians, for example, tell me that they feel like death is sort of an enemy, or 
something that they’re constantly having to fight against.  
 
JB: 
That’s an interesting concept. 
 
I think that there’s several ways it can go: fighting against that in all-out war, that may be 
their concept. I think there’s also the – there’s a lot of people that have become numb to 
it: they don’t see death as their all-out focus and war against.  
 
I know for me, I don’t think or focus on death. I focus on the person and their happiness. 
Maybe that’s my way of addressing it. But I look to the person – I’m always thinking 
about whether or not there is a safety issue. But I know that if the person is doing better, 
feeling better, that the option of that comes off the table –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
JB: 
For somebody.  
 
I also know that death is one of those ultimate control issues. So maybe if you give 
somebody back some degree of control, they feel less likely or intending to hurt or kill 
themselves.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm.

Do you ever feel like you have suffered personally because of your work? Because of 
dealing with difficult cases, or even just the physical demands of say, residency, or 
anything like that? 
 
[37:50] 
 
JB: 
Yeah, I mean the physical demands of residency – the physical demands of everyday 
work – it depends on what work you’re doing. When I was in private practice, my life 
was a lot easier –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
JB: 
In terms of time for myself and exercise. I’m in an academic environment now, students 
and classes and these other responsibilities – I don’t have nearly as much time. But I’m a 
lot happier. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
JB: 
Because I’m doing things that I really am enjoying and that fulfill me – it’s always a 
balance, obviously.  
 
 
But we get older – I’m getting older. And I get tired, and it’s easier to get tired. I think 
that that’s a big one.  
 
 
 
Psychologically – I think it impacts a lot of people: they get burned out. I don’t feel that 
way from the patients – I don’t get burned out from them. I have a good ability to 
separate their issues, and the time I spend with them, and move onto the next, knowing 
that things are getting done. I think that’s what I rely on – I know that things are getting 
better, or things are getting done, we’re utilizing medicine – that’s what I rely on, 
knowing that. And that’s how I can separate it.  
 
 
I know that if I just sat there with the patient and knew there were things to do but didn’t 
do them – yeah, I would be really burned out, because I couldn’t – it would be a helpless 
state.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
JB: 
That would be probably a bad thing. 
 
LG: 
How do people treat you when they learn that you’re a physician? Do they treat you any 
differently? 
 
JB: 
Are you asking when they learn I’m a physician or when they learn I’m a psychiatrist? 
Because those are two different things.  
 
LG: 
How about when they learn you’re a psychiatrist? 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 16 
 
 
[39:50] 
 
JB: 
Yes. There is, nine times out of ten, there is a change in their demeanor or – it’s not 
necessarily demeanor, there is just a visible movement that they have: either in their face, 
their eyes, their forehead –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
JB: 
Their body. They think I’m analyzing them, or they think that – I don’t know, that I can 
see into their souls? I don’t know what the deal is. But they also feel awkward with the 
idea of psychiatry, a lot of people, I think. 
 
 
So, when they learn I’m a physician, usually it’s a lot of respect. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
JB: 
A lot of interest, sometimes. When they learn I’m a psychiatrist, I see a degree of anxiety 
in them; I see a degree of reticence – but nothing I’m going to do about that [laughs]. So,  
yeah. 
 
LG: 
Do psychiatrists make fun of themselves? 
 
JB: 
Yeah, all the time – we do, I do. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
JB: 
Oh, I constantly say things like, someone says [laughs] – my old friend (he passed away), 
but he would talk about how something was aching him (like his knee was bothering 
him).  
 
 
And so I’d say to him, “Well how does that make you feel?” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And he’d say to me, “Well what good are you?” And I’d say, “Well tell me what you 
mean by that?” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
[??] 
 
JB: 
So, that’s one way we make fun of ourselves. And then another thing is the jokes about 
you know, you have medicine for everything, right? [Laughs]  
 
 
“You know, I can’t make dinner tonight, I’m just so annoyed.” 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 17 
 
 
 
“I have a medicine for that, don’t worry. You’ll forget it.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs]  
 
 
Some parts of the medical, you know, kind of the corpus of medical humor are 
stereotypes about specialties –  
 
JB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
What are some of the stereotypes about psychiatrists? 
 
JB: 
That we’re weird. 
 
LG: 
That you’re weird? 
 
JB: 
That we’re strange. That we’ve all had problems ourselves –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
JB: 
I think that one is probably pretty true. We’ve all had psychiatric issues at some time in 
our lives, so we can understand them – or, a loved one has. So, we have a different 
understanding and drive to do that. That’s probably a pretty good stereotype but also a 
real one. 
 
[42:40] 
 
 
But yeah, I think that we’re weird or we’re strange people – that’s a pretty common one. 
 
LG: 
Do you guys ever make fun of other specialties? 
 
JB: 
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah – like orthopedic surgery, you know – one of my best friends is an 
orthopedic surgeon (two of my best friends are), and you know, we just talk about them 
cutting and they don’t even know who their patients are, they just read on the chart where 
they’re supposed to cut, you know [laughs]? And they don’t know anything else.  
 
 
But that’s not true. Orthopedic surgeons tend to think about that, and think about the 
patient and they ask something about them, at least something. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
Maybe their name? 
 
LG: 
Orthopedics seems to be the one that –  
 
JB: 
People make fun of? 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 18 
 
 
LG: 
People make fun of quite a bit [laughs]. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. Yeah, there’s a joke about there’s a family doctor, an internal medicine doctor, a 
surgeon, and a (you’ll cut that I hope?) –  
 
LG: 
Oh, that’s fine. It’s hard on tape. 
 
JB: 
And a – I’ll remember it later. 
 
LG: 
Oh, that’s okay; I’ll come back to it. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Let’s see – we were talking about the stereotypes. 
 
JB: 
A pathologist. 
 
 
So, there is a joke about a pathologist, a surgeon, an internal medicine doctor, and a 
family practice doctor go hunting. And they hear a “quack, quack, quack.” And it’s the 
family doctor’s turn. So, the family doctor gets up there and says, “Sounds like a duck, 
looks like a duck,” bang, bang, bang – shoots the duck. 
 
 
So, it’s the internal medicine doctor’s turn. And so, they hear “quack, quack, quack.” And 
he gets up and he says, “Looks like a duck, sounds like a duck – could be a goose, maybe 
it’s a heron; maybe it’s an elephant with a cold.” And the duck flies by. 
 
 
And then, the surgeon’s turn. And they begin to hear a “quack,” and the surgeon goes 
bang, bang, bang! Looks at the pathologist and says, “Was that a duck?” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And what that means is that family doctors, you know, they have this understanding of 
what’s going on, and they treat it. Internal medicine doctors – they really like getting into 
the details, and understanding what’s behind it, and looking at all the possibilities. And 
it’s kind of a joke about how they think through those things endlessly. And the surgeons, 
the joke is that they just cut. They just go in and cut. And they just worry about what it is 
later. 
 
[46:06] 
 
LG: 
Later? 
 
JB: 
And that’s where the pathologist comes in. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] That’s the pathologist [??]. 
Physician Oral History: Jonathan Birnkrant 
Page 19 
 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Alright. Well I have about two more questions and you know, we can wrap up. 
 
 
What role do you think humor plays in your own life, as a physician? 
 
JB: 
I love humor; I mean, it’s great. I love telling dumb jokes and watching comedy on TV, 
and sitcoms. That’s another thing I do, is I escape to TV sometimes. Movies that are 
comedies, going to comedy clubs. 
 
 
I tend to be sarcastic at times. And I make jokes when I’m talking with people – just off-
the-cuff. So, it’s a big part of my personal life.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Do you feel it helps you as a physician in any way? 
 
JB: 
In the way that, as I had said, it allows me to make a connection to patients, things like 
that.  
 
LG: 
What else would you want the public to know about what it’s like to be a psychiatrist in 
the 21st century? That you think is important? 
 
JB: 
The most important thing is that a psychiatrist is there to help you, not to fix you; it’s not 
going to take away anything from you. It allows you to be who you are – not change who 
you are. And I think there is a lot of stigma around psychiatry and psychiatrists.  
 
 
We can’t read your minds [laughs]. You don’t have to tell us the deepest, darkest secrets 
you have. We can be in the present – it’s not about the Freudian couch, where you’re 
lying there telling us about your mother. It’s about the here and now, and how you can be 
happier in the moment.  
 
 
It doesn’t have to be about medication. Medication can be very helpful, but it’s only 
helpful – it doesn’t do it for you. You’re the one that has to do it yourself. Whether that’s 
taking the medicine, or doing the therapy, or doing the things that will make you feel 
better, which include your diet and your exercise, and socializing with people, and those 
sorts of things.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And what’s the best part of your job? 
 
JB: 
Helping people. Just helping people feel happier. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
JB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Alright. Well thank you very much.

Again, as a closing tag – this is Lisa Gabbert; and I’ve been talking to Dr. Jonathan 
Birnkrant. And today is November 1st, 2019.
