February 4, 1941, letter from Alan Lomax to H.M. Bond
Library of Congress Washington, D. C. February 4, 1941
Mr. H. M. Bond, President The Fort Valley State College Fort Valley, Georgia
Dear Mr. Bond:
I have just had the opportunity to read over your letter carefully—this month of January
has been so busy that I have neglected all my correspondence— and I find that I should
like to come to your festival very much indeed and bring with me a recording machine
to take down the music of all the participants. Let me hear from you as soon as you can
about whether it will be possible to record continuously throughout the festival and I will
recommend that the Library of Congress send me down for the occasion.
It may be possible, too, for my father, John Lomax, to come too. I suggest that you also
invite Sterling Brown of Howard University, whom you certainly know; Charles Seeger,
Pan-American Union, Washington, D.C.; Dr. Hodgson of the University of Georgia, who
has recently expressed an interest in collecting folk songs in Georgia on a statewide basis;
Dr. Howard Odom and Dr. Guy Johnson of the University of North Carolina; and Zora
Neale Hurston, who can be reached through her publisher, Lippincott, in Philadelphia.
I am not completely certain that I can come because my present schedule at the Library is
so full but this corroborating letter of yours would make it more certain, I believe. Thanks
very much for the invitation.
Sincerely yours, Alan Lomax Assistant in charge of the Archive of American Folk Song
