NH 
This is interview number one for the Archie Green Project. I’m sitting here 
 
talking with Prescott Vandervoet of Vandervoet and Associates here in Rio 
 
Rico. Prescott and his father Brian have a family-owned business here in Rio 
 
Rico; Prescott is based out of Nogales. Would you mind explaining things that 
 
you do on a day-to-day basis? 
 
PV 
Our company is a small family operated company, and we work hand in hand 
with growers/farmers in Northwest Mexico to market their crops. We 
market crops on a day-to-day spot market basis, as well as more long-term 
contractual agreements. But what we try to do here is we match the needs of 
the buyers—and the buyers we deal with are anywhere from Tucson to 
Toronto to Tokyo—with what’s being harvested and packed on a day-to-day 
level. So, what we really do is we match- we try to make the two fit- always 
focusing on helping the grower attain the maximum profit. Our primary goal 
is to help the growers sell their crops in the best way, and to make the 
business profitable on not only a day-to-day sense, but also long-term- to 
create long-term relationships- and help retailers, help food service industry 
provide for their clientele the best quality crops available at any given time.  
 
NH  
What is the sort of size of the number of growers that you’re work with? You 
said Northwest Mexico, Sonora- what’s the size of the group? 
 
PV 
We work very closely and intermittently with two growing operations: one 
based in the production region called the Coast of Hermosillo—which is a 
large alluvial plain between the city of Hermosillo, Sonora and the Sea of 
Cortez—and another region called the coast of Caborca, which is a little 
further to the northwest of Hermosillo. And then those are large, established 
operations- multi-generational farming operations. And then we work with a 
handful of smaller growers on a less concrete business relationship, where 
it’s more month-to-month, or season-to-season. So ourselves, as a small

business,  we’re kind of limited in how much we can do. Between the two 
large growers and the handful of small growers, everybody we directly work 
with is in the state of Sonora. Within the industry, when we refer to 
northwest Mexico, it tends to be Sonora and Sinaloa, and to some degree part 
of Baja [California]. 
 
NH 
You had said before that you work with folks that don’t have any facilities or 
use any chemical or insect control.  Would that be considered organic produce? 
 
PV 
The infrastructure and the technology related to controlling insect pests—
 
and to that degree, soils and their respective bacteria and different sorts of 
 
fungi—there’s a broad spectrum of techniques. For most specialized and 
 
capital-intensive would be glass and metal greenhouse structures- something 
 
you’re probably used to seeing in areas like Eastern Canada, Holland, [and] to 
 
some degree parts of the U.S. And then at the other end of the spectrum of 
 
what we call protected agriculture, it may just be as basic as a shadecloth, 
 
strung up over PVC or some aluminum structure. So it wouldn’t be so much  
 
of a temperature control but it would work to limit from insects. The crops 
 
that we primarily handle—honeydew melon, cantaloupe melon, 
 
watermelon—are all grown without any of those types of protections. So 
 
they’re in the open air, and being in the open air, they’re subject to not only 
 
the whims of the climate, but also any sort of insect pests that may happen 
 
upon the field. We operate in two seasons in the year: there’s the fall and the 
 
 spring season in the state of Sonora. In the fall season, crops are planted in 
 
late summer, and harvested in late fall. The weather is warm; there tends to 
 
be some amount of moisture that tends to happen, whether it be summer 
 
monsoons or tropical storms that came in in September. That creates a 
 
habitat that insects like. Heat and moisture, as well as diseases- viruses that 
 
insects pass around. So in the fall season, there tends to be a need for 
 
application of controlled pesticides. In the spring season, crops are planted in 
 
the late winter, and they really try to ensure that they’ll be planted after the 
 
last threat of freeze. That’s a general technique. And the harvest comes in late 
 
spring, early summer- April, May June. In the period of time that the plants 
 
are growing in February, March, temperatures tend to be cooler. There may 
 
or may not be precipitation, [but] the point is that there’s a much reduced 
 
amount of insects- insect pests. So the need and use of pesticides is also 
 
greatly reduced. So we kind of have, within these two seasons, very different 
 
techniques of dealing with insect pests. To be considered organic, you have to 
 
go through a whole series of checks and reviews to get organic certification- 
 
one of them being you can’t use pesticides. So none of the growers that we 
 
currently work with do that. But on a season-to-season basis, there are 
 
seasons in the psring when their pesticide use is nil, but in the summer, 
 
they’re using them again on that second crop. That’s why they don’t pay for 
 
that--[door opens; a worker enters]

PV 
[to worker] Come on in.  
 
 
--Also, the crops that we distribute [sound of door closing] are difficult to 
 
grow. You can’t really grow them vertically, say, a tomato, where you can 
 
create a greenhouse and create vertical structures that the tomato vine 
 
will grow up. Melons grow spread out, horizontally on the ground, and the 
 
area you need to enclose to get your normal acreage would just be massive. 
 
So for watermelons and honeydew melons, it’s not an option that very many 
 
people have explored yet- to create some sort of protection which would 
 
then obviously reduce your need for pesticides. If you keep the bugs out,  
 
you don’t have to spray the plants. 
 
NH 
I wanted to know a little about how you- your father also, since it’s a father 
 
and son operation- but tell me a little bit about how you decided to go into 
 
the produce industry. 
 
PV 
Well, growing up around it, it’s something that you see to some degree- not 
 
necessarily intimately- of coming into an office every day- you kind of get a 
 
feel for what it’s about to a certain degree. And it didn’t interest me much at 
 
all for quite a while, primarily due to some of the stress levels I watched- that 
 
was not attractive [laughs]. But how I got into it? I was working at the 
 
University [of Arizona], and the 2008 economic issues were kind of 
 
beginning to be felt, and a few years after that, I saw that it was going to be 
 
more and more difficult to continue finding new opportunities within an 
 
academic structure. And at the same time, I saw that I felt like get involved 
 
here, and have more energy to use [and be] more mature enough to handle 
 
stress issues. So I started working in this in 2011.

What were you doing at the university before?

Public policy studies in groundwater.

So were you in Environmental Studies?

The Udall Center.  
 
NH 
How long had you been involved in policy work before the recession? 
 
PV  
I worked there for about three years, which came after doing my master’s 
degree on immigration policy, but at the same time doing a project on 
groundwater policy. I was always interested in issues relating to the Arizona-
Sonora border region. Geographically, I’ve always been interested in this

area, but thematically, it switched. And also, the culture of the work of an 
academic institution versus an industry like this is radically different.  
 
NH 
[Could you] elaborate on what feels very different to you? 
 
PV 
Well, when you have to earn your paycheck [laughs], in a government-funded 
 
environment, you kind of work on yearly or multi-year cycles of assured 
 
funding. Our funding here is assured week-to-week. So if we don’t come to 
 
work, there’s nothing guaranteed, there’s no sick days or vacation. You take 
 
your vacation at the end of your fiscal year and look at your profit and loss. 
 
And if there’s no profit, there’s not much of a vacation. I would say that the 
 
work environment, in terms of hours and energy put, there’s probably a lot of 
 
folks in the public sector who work very hard, but there’s also a lot of room 
 
for folks who don’t work hard. And I found myself in that level of not working 
 
hard, and not being forced to work hard. I felt like I had more to give. Stars 
 
aligned, and for better or for worse, I made my way into this. I remember 
 
talking with my father about it, and I said “I’m not realizing my potential 
 
here, because I have more energy to do things.” Well, here in a small family-
 
run business, it’s basically you do what you want to do. There’s nobody that’s 
 
going to prevent from going in one direction or the other. But, at the same 
 
time, all those risks are calculated and you can’t just go and say “I’m going to 
 
start becoming a graphic designer of the most awesome watermelon box of 
 
all time.” That’s not necessarily going to sell you any more watermelons. 
 
There’s the freedom here to explore, but at the same time, there’s more 
 
restrictions because your primary issue at all times is generating the profit 
 
to pay yourself. 
 
NH 
When you started working here, was a lot of the background and the process 
 
of learning the trade- was it a lot of just hands-on working alongside your 
 
father? 
 
PV 
I think there’s a lot to be explained, but ultimately, and like in many fields, 
the only way to really learn it is just to do it. And in that sense, you can’t 
really learn it until you’ve spent a certain amount of time in it. And so I think 
in that sense, I’ve been able…and I would say that things evolve, businesses, 
industries, cultures evolve. So you’re never done learning. But there is 
definitely a level to try to get up to, to be on the same general plane as the 
other folks. And in my opinion- I’ve been here four-and-a-half, almost five 
years- and I feel that part of the aspect is that other folks who’ve been here 
for twenty, thirty, forty years have just seen so much. And there’s no way I 
will ever match up to them until they’re retired and out, and I’m in forty 
years.  And at that point, those forty years will be so different from the 
previous forty years, you probably won’t even compare them. But within five

years, I would say that I’m up to speed on a lot of issues, but you can never 
compare five years of experience to forty years of experience. 
 
NH 
Do you see parts of your background in public policy making an influence on 
the daily work that you have to do here. 
 
PV 
I’d like to say yes, but probably not.  
 
NH 
Like your background doing research on groundwater? 
 
PV 
No, not at all. The issues we deal with on a day-to-day scale are so minute and 
kind of precise. Public policy issues are large and overarching, that span both 
time and space. Our business here really deals with details on a day-to-day, 
hour-to-hour level. And the details that we spend a lot of time with are 
communicating evolving market conditions to the growers so they can make 
small tweaks in their production and take advantage of markets; explaining 
production issues to the buyers so that they can prepare to inform other 
folks through the supply chain about what is or isn’t coming up in the next 
two to three weeks on the expected pack-out. We deal a lot with logistics: 
Mexican trucks crossing the border, U.S. trucks coming in to pick up 
warehouse inventory rotation, exceeding warehouse space. Every day is a 
constant battle with trucks crossing the border because there’s this black 
hole where information no longer exists as the Mexican commercial loads are 
crossing through the border. And really, that black hole begins on the 
Mexican side (clears throat) and it doesn’t end until they back up here, or 
they pull into the parking lot here. And that’s a very frustrating thing because 
so much of what we do with our marketing is about supply chains, and 
inventory controls. And when your supply chain inventory has a giant black 
hole, it gets really tricky. And I think that’s just one of the unique facets of 
dealing with binational trade, particularly perishable commodities that are 
foods, right? So there’s a lot of government controls over what goes on, for 
food safety reasons as well as controls related to trafficking, because when 
you have a semi-truck making its way across the border, you have- in peak 
season- over a thousand a day, there’s a lot of potential for illicit trade. So 
there’s a lot of governmental controls; that’s a necessary part of what goes 
on. But for us, in the office here, that all equates to an uncertainty of when 
and how the product arrives here in Nogales. 
 
NH 
Do you have to go across frequently, to the border-into Sonora- for your 
work? 
 
PV 
We go maybe between half a dozen and a dozen times a year to visit with the 
growers and just have face-to-face conversations, go to fields. We’re not 
agronomists, so going to a field, we’re not going to be able to predict crop

yields four weeks out. But I think everyone- anyone- who’s marketing a fruit 
or vegetable ought to know where it comes from. Obviously some people 
market [at a] hemispherical level, so if you’re in an office in Philadelphia, it’s 
not necessarily convenient to visit a vineyard in Chile. For us, where it’s less 
than half a day’s drive or so, there’s no reason not to.  
 
NH 
There seems to be an increasing trend in people being increasingly aware of 
where their food comes from; they have to have that relationship with food, 
it seems.  
 
PV 
I think at the buying end, definitely. At the ultimate consumer. There’s an 
evolving interest and to that degree, conscience, of how food is produced, 
where it comes from, and under what conditions. Within the supply chain, 
the multiple levels of buyers and suppliers, I’m not convinced that there’s a 
real interest. I think their major interest is appeasing the end consumer, and 
trying to figure out how to make the consumer’s interest meld [to] their 
interest as a firm. So I don’t talk to end consumers; I talk to buyers who 
supply restaurants and supermarkets. So my information- I create 
information- and I try to explain it to the folks that I talk to. It doesn’t mean 
it’s getting to the folks who might actually be more interested in it. [slight 
pause] Like what I talked about with the two seasons of pesticides- I’ve told a 
lot of folks that and just as a basic level of understanding of how these 
melons are grown, what goes into them. I think that certain sorts of end 
consumers would be interested in that, but ultimately our—the foods that we 
supply—just make up a small percentage of anything and everything that’s 
on a supermarket display, a produce section. So parsing out that little bit of 
information from a multitude of information that’s behind every single item 
and piece of fruit. And then you [unintelligible] that with 365 days a year- 
there’s so much information potential there, it would be overwhelming; it 
would be a tsunami of information. So it’s probably too much to handle.    
 
 
NH 
There’s a well-known skit on the show Portlandia, where they ask if the 
chicken is local, and it gets to the point where they have the specific name of the 
chicken and what he ate for breakfast [PV laughs]. The couple decide that, rather 
than have the chicken, they decide to drive down to the farm themselves to see it 
[laughs]. I wanted to have you tell me a little bit about an average workday. On an 
average basis, describe what your work involves. 
 
PV 
The primary thing that this company does is we market-or-slash-distribute 
Mexican fruit. That’s how our company generates its revenue. We generate 
revenue by charging a commission—a percentage—of the sale. So the 
incentive is to sell for a higher price; therefore, your percentage is higher. So 
what do we do? When we are in our seasons—what we refer to as shipping 
seasons when the fruit is being packed and shipped out of the fields—here, to

Southern Arizona, to this zone of warehouses, cold storage warehouses in 
Nogales—and in these sales offices, we are marketing that fruit throughout 
the supply chain. What our day really entails is coming in early—say, 
between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.—looking at inbound inventories, because the 
products we work with, because they’re not geographically very far away, are 
picked, say, any day of the week. Tuesday morning. They’re packed Tuesday 
afternoon. When I mean picked, they’re pulled out of the field, off the vine. 
There’s a cleaning process, and then when I say packed, they’ve moved to a 
box. There’s a pre-cooling, which means you bring the temperature of the 
fruit down from whatever it was when it was sitting out in the field on the 
vine to a range of depending on what it is. For example, table grapes go down 
to the high 30s; watermelons might not need to be cooled at all. There’s a 
pre-cooling that happens after the stuff has been put in the box, and then that 
evening, it’s loaded onto a Mexican truck. It ships out. The next day, the 
Mexican truck transits toward the border, and the next day, the product 
crosses the border and arrives here. So within twenty-four hours of being 
harvested, it’s at our facility here. At which point we do our best job to move 
it throughout the supply chain, get it going, sell it, and get it moving out 
because these are perishable commodities; over time, they lose value. The 
fresher, the better, the more valuable. So we get in early, we look at what we 
refer to as the Mexican manifests. That tells us what was packed out the 
previous day, because fruit is graded by size or quality, right? So there’s 
watermelon. There’s four or five different sizes of watermelon, and that’s 
how we sell it; it’s watermelon by the size. Other items are sold by quality or 
condition grades. So we parse it out by the sizing, or the condition, and then 
we enter that into our sales database [phone call], and we start selling 
it…[phone rings again; PV stops to take a call] 
 
[phone conversation up to 26:59] 
 
So we come in early, we look at the Mexican manifests, and we populate our 
sales inventory database that tells us what we can sell. What’s coming in, we 
work off of a rule that we sell everything that’s in transit. If it’s coming across 
the border, we try to sell it. So then based off our market analysis, there’s 
market conditions; what we’ll do is generate what we call a quote. And we 
start calling buyers and telling them this is what we’re quoting on these 
items today. As I said earlier, these are spot market conditions, so the whole 
supply-demand field changes as it does, constantly. A valuable piece of fruit, 
depending on supply and demand conditions. So what we try to do is analyze 
that, and create a value on the item that’s most beneficial to the grower, but 
at the same time amenable to the buyer, because, heck I could quote an item 
of fruit for a hundred dollars, but if you don’t sell it, then what’s the point? So 
you’ve got to find that happy medium of what makes both parties happy. I 
could sell a lot of fruit for less than a dollar, but I’ll throw the grower out of

business, so what’s the point? The bulk of the morning is taken up by offering 
out and taking orders for day-to-day sales but also a lot of discussion occurs 
about what’s expected the next few days, until the next week. So we have a 
lot of communication going back and forth with the growers about how the 
crop appears to be coming up. We’re taking advanced orders with a certain 
level of certainty, because if the weather changes, the production estimate 
changes, so we can’t offer up a hundred percent certitude of what’ll be 
harvested seven days from now. But we do our best to do that, because it 
creates stability within the marketplace. And that’s a win-win. That’s most of 
our morning, and in the afternoon, a lot of the issues we deal with are 
logistical issues related, because then the Mexican trucks have made their 
way through the border facility and are unloading here. The U.S. trucks are 
arriving here to load out. So we’re watching the inventory as it comes in from  
the Mexican trucks; we’re looking at the quality. We’re parsing out- if we see 
that a certain truck has better quality than another, in our eyes, we might 
direct that towards a certain client, as opposed to another. So that’s what our 
afternoons are mostly made up of. And the work days here when the 
company is in what they would refer to as a shipping season are easily ten to 
twelve-hour days. 
 
NH 
Do you do five days, or six? 
 
PV 
I would say five and a half days a week, although what I’m referring to as 
being physically here, with technological advents of smartphones and stuff 
like that, we’re really working six to six and a half days a week, although 
we’re not necessarily in the office. And the work day isn’t ten to twelve 
hours; it’s twelve to fourteen because the moment you wake up, you’ll 
answer the phone. And you don’t not answer the phone until you go to sleep. 
And sometimes you answer the phone when you’re asleep (laughs). Because 
the warehouses work late. The warehouses will normally work until- 
depending on the seasonality and the crop- most warehouses don’t close 
until 8:00 P.M. Many warehouses stay open until 11:00 P.M. And for those of 
us who are getting there early, we’ll probably sleep, but if the warehouse 
calls and says “We have an issue,” you answer the phone. So the work hours 
between when you’re in the office, and when you’re on call, are different.  
 
[31:40] 
 
NH 
So I imagine there’s probably the occasional truck that gets at the border at 
1:00 A.M. or 2:00 A.M. in the morning? 
 
PV 
The border, for commercial crossings, is only open from 8:00 A.M. until about 
6:00 P.M.

NH 
Oh. 
 
PV 
So there’s a cutoff. But there’s issues (typewriter in background) related to if, 
for instance, say an insect is found on a load at the border facility. It’s 
detained, and it’s not going to be released. So while you worked off the 
assumption that that truck was going to come through, and then doesn’t 
show up, and the product is sold, and the U.S. truck is here waiting to pick it 
up, you have those sorts of issues.  
 
NH 
Going back to the folks in the warehouse- how many people work at this 
specific office, including the warehouses? 
 
PV 
So there’s a wide range in sizes of operations here. I would say our company, 
our sales office, is among the smallest of them, but there are one-person 
companies, sales offices. And the larger ones would have, say, between up to 
a dozen, between sales and sales assistant and accounting staff, up to maybe 
two dozen. And then warehouse crews- I’d say the smallest would have 
maybe three people and the larger ones would have fifteen to twenty. That’s 
kind of the range of what it takes to handle the workload.  
 
NH 
So it’s actually fairly- number-wise- fairly small in comparison to industrial 
operations.  
 
PV 
Yes and no. One thing that you have to remember is that these are sales and 
logistics operations. The amount of time and labor that actually went into 
turning and creating the product into a packaged item is much greater at the 
farm. And we see ourselves as being directly connected to the farm; when we 
do a good job, they benefit. When they do a good job, we benefit. But the 
farm’s got hundreds of people working the fields and working in packing 
facilities.  
 
NH 
Could I have you talk a little bit about the challenges that you find? You 
mentioned a few of them- the challenges that come along with your work. 
 
 
(PV steps away to speak to office worker; back at 34:57; typewriter noise 
stops) 
 
PV 
The challenges are just all over the place, all the time. The most basic 
challenge is matching the production quantities and qualities of the fruits and 
vegetables with the expectations of the buyers. And as an intermediary, we’re 
the ones that a lot of these conversations go through. But consumers and 
users of fruits and vegetables have expectations of how a piece of fruit or 
vegetable looks, how it tastes. When I say how it looks, its external 
appearance in terms of cleanliness, its size, its color, the taste, the sugar

levels, the firmness- that’s also kind of connected to the freshness. So you 
connect those things with the fact that so many of the fruits and vegetables 
that we market are grown outdoors, and they’re subject to the whims of the 
climate. And certain aspects of climate have an effect on the quality, and the 
quantity, of the fruit or vegetable that’s being grown. So, for instance, last fall 
in Sonora and southern Arizona, there were two or three tropical storms that 
made their way all the way up the Gulf- the Sea of Cortez, the Gulf of 
California- and dropped rain in the month of September on these agricultural 
production regions where the fruit, the crop, was already in a somewhat 
mature stage, and harvests were, if not beginning, about to begin. That had a 
detrimental effect on a large area of production on multiple crops for a 
season that was going to be coming up and last for a couple of months. So 
how do you explain that to the buying end? We just dealt with two to three 
major tropical storms that were completely unexpected, and aren’t normal, 
and there’s no control measures to handle two inches of rain in mid-
September, because it’s not normal. But the buyers are used to everything 
always…they’re used to normality. There’s a general current consistency of 
supply. And all of a sudden, that supply system breaks down because we’ve 
got those storms. So that’s just one example. Freezes- unexpected freezes- 
knock out crops. And when you think about a supermarket, a piece of fruit 
that’s on a shelf- the logistics to get that piece of fruit or vegetable on the 
shelf originated weeks, if not months, prior. They’re not thinking about what 
are we going to put the shelf four days from now- no. They’re thinking about 
what we are going to put on the shelf four weeks from now. Well, four weeks 
before a freeze, no one’s expecting a freeze- one of these weird freezes. And 
then the freeze hits, and it completely disrupts the supply. So I think that’s 
probably our major issue is balancing production regimes with consumption 
expectations.

To jump on the consumer side, consumers maybe don’t understand the 
weather patterns of southern Arizona--

--Well, so much of it is that we’re really a global industry. In this area, we’re 
definitely a binational. We’re multi-regional in the sense of ecoregions, right? 
The Sonoran Desert is very different than, say, Appalachia. But we ship, and 
the distribution networks extend throughout. I wouldn’t expect a consumer 
in Salt Lake City what’s to know happening in Hermosillo. But it’s quite 
probable that in certain months of the year, they’re consuming fruits and 
vegetables that came from there. And if you look at other supply chain or 
logistic networks, things are being moved all over the globe in all sorts of 
ways. And so it’s just normal that fruits and vegetables fit into that pattern as 
freight infrastructure evolves. If we can ship a box of fruit to Newfoundland, 
and make a profit on it, and make the consumer happy, we’ll do it. That’s just 
kind of a basic economic rule: always be looking for new opportunities and

ways to expand, and at the same time, we want to have as many potential 
consumers as possible because at any given time, one group might adjust 
their trends.  
 
NH 
Sort of like kale is the new green and something is the new kale… 
 
PV 
There are forms of dealing with potential risk. You want to diversify…that’s 
why we don’t work with just one grower- we work with a few, because a 
storm could knock out one region, so you want to have a backup plan. And 
the same with buyers- we don’t work with just one supermarket chain. Right 
now, the one on the East Coast, A&P…they used to be the largest 
supermarket chain in the United States, and they’re basically downsizing to 
the point where they may not exist anymore. You don’t ever want to have all 
of your eggs in one basket.  
 
NH 
I’ve heard some people talk about one of the challenges that might come up 
with the produce is that Interstate 69 is being built through McAllen; it is 
being built through my home state right now, and will eventually make its 
way down. There’s a sort of general concern that, once 69 is built through 
McAllen, that produce…things might change, and I wanted to know your 
thoughts on that, if that’s something that you’ve heard people talk about or 
something that you’ve thought about yourself. 
 
PV 
Right. I think there’s a few different factors involved; one is just basic 
populations- population distribution within the United States and Canada. I 
think most people kind of envision the regions in three sections: East Coast, 
the Midwest, and the West, right? There’s a lot of cities and a lot of 
population centers on the East Coast, and to a degree, in parts of the Midwest. 
Maybe more to the North, right? One of the costs that goes into the price that 
a consumer pays is transportation costs. So the more efficiently you can 
move something from Point A to Point B, reduces that side of the cost, which 
reduces the end cost, which makes the piece of fruit or vegetable more 
amenable to being consumed, versus someone who’s using a different freight 
route, and has different costs. Moving things from Mexico and particularly 
Northwest Mexico to the East Coast, is more efficient going through Texas if 
you only look at where you’re going from the border to your end spot within 
the East Coast or Midwest, whether that be Chicago or Boston. It’s more 
efficient for the point of origin to be along the border in South Texas, versus 
Nogales. Now, your freight with Mexico is a different issue because roads are 
different; there’s different directionalities and the actual intricacies of 
crossing the border can be different at different ports of entry. But what 
people are seeing- folks who market heavily to the East Coast, and 
particularly when they market from the state of Sinaloa versus Sonora- 
there’s a clear advantage of crossing at McAllen or some of the little ports

around there. If you’re marketing to the West Coast, you would go to Nogales. 
A lot of this also has to do with the fact that a new bridge was built in Mexico 
that connects two regions that, previously, weren’t connected very well. So 
when you’re producing down here (PV points to map of Mexico on the wall), 
in Sinaloa, and you want to get your stuff to Chicago or Boston or anywhere 
up there, it’s better to go like that. If you’re going to the West Coast- say 
Denver, west- it’s better like that. If you’re producing over here, in the Gulf, 
and you’re going to the West Coast, it’s better to go like that, right? But if 
you’re that way, it’s better to go that way. But so much has to do with where 
your end consumer is, where your population is, where your buying power 
is. For instance, Detroit doesn’t have a lot of buying power; you might say, 
“Detroit’s a big city,” but you compare it to Tucson, your buying power might 
not be that different. Where your point of origin is, are you in Sonora, are you 
in Sinaloa, are you in Veracruz- where are you in Mexico? And a lot of it 
narrows down to what’s your end consumer, where are they, and where’s 
your production originate? There’s going to be some diversification; there’s 
going to be some product moving more to take advantage of that new 
interstate because it’ll make things more efficient and faster, but if you’re 
going to those folks already, I don’t know if the interstate’s going to 
necessary pull more produce that way. If you’re already going to Chicago, 
you’re probably already crossing at McAllen. 
 
NH 
It’s something that I wondered about because people were talking about this 
interstate for twenty or thirty years in Indiana, and Texas as well. But so far, 
it’s only about twenty miles of being built in McAllen, but there’s some 
things— 
 
PV 
You know, the largest commercial crossing in all of Mexico is Laredo, because 
there’s so much commercial product there, like appliances, automobile-
related stuff, tech stuff. In that sense, if some of those industries are able to 
hold on and maintain themselves in the Midwest, the Great Lakes area, that 
type of road will really be crucial. For produce, I wouldn’t call it a game-
changer. It’ll have an effect, but I don’t think it will radically change things 
any more than they’ve already been evolving.  
 
NH 
So people will adapt. Things will adapt. 
 
PV 
People have already adapted. People already started adapting a few years 
ago as Texas started envisioning themselves as an importer, rather than a 
producer. South Texas used to be famous for a variety of items. They still 
have a few, but you see more and more product that’s going through Texas 
that’s being produced in Mexico.

NH 
 I was kind of wondering- I’m trying to think about this for a second- is there 
anything about your work in the produce industry that we haven’t talked 
about, that you think people should know? For example, somebody in Detroit 
wants to know about what’s the process of getting produce across the 
border. Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you think people 
should know? 
 
PV 
I think people should realize that produce that crosses the border into the 
U.S. is probably some of the most safe and clean produce that you can buy 
and consume, due to the fact that it has to go through so many checks coming 
across the border. Dozens of federal agencies are privy to the information 
and can look at it in one way or another in respect to the commercial load- 
what constitutes the commercial load. And [it’s] not just all about looking for 
marijuana. So much of it is looking at pesticides, looking for insects, looking 
for soil, anything that would be a violation of what you can move into the 
United States. And all of that ensures that the produce is of really high 
quality. So I’m not suggesting that domestic produce is not of high quality. 
But I think that people don’t realize that Mexican produce, due to the fact that 
it must transit through these federal and state agencies to enter U.S. 
commerce- that ensures and that forces the Mexican growers to produce a 
really high level of fruit or vegetable.  
 
NH 
There’s so much interest now in eating local, with books like the 100-mile 
diet—I once heard a radio debate with a professor that argued that the 100-
mile diet was actually not good, versus a local food activist, having the debate 
of what you’ve said now: is it sustainable. So I’m seeing a bit of those issues 
coming up because there is so much of a focus on eating local, or buying 
American. So you’re providing a little bit of a different perspective. It’s 
actually quite safer than to buy peaches or apples from somebody down in 
Willcox.  
 
PV 
Well, I’m sure the folks in Willcox grow good crops, but there’s not the same 
potential for so many enforcement entities to look at those crops. And if you 
have faith in the enforcement entities, then you should have faith in the 
Mexican-grown produce. I support locally grown products, and I support 
seasonably amenable production. But we’ve culturally become able to being 
used to getting anything at any time. And the price might fluctuate a bit, but 
we expect it to be there. That’s a real luxury, to be able to buy a watermelon 
in Toronto in January. Markets have evolved and made it possible. That being 
said, I think folks ought to recognize- I think conceptualizing local- it needs to 
be more nuanced, and I think that people think of it as a concentric ring 
concept of local, so you can have ultra-local, which is your backyard or your 
block if you live in a city, or you can have regionally local. You can have eco-
region local. And I think a lot of that ought to ignore international boundaries

because the products that we grow are subject to a lot of the same climactic 
conditions. The products that we market are similar to stuff grown, say, west 
of Phoenix. So I would say that Sonoran Desert production could range from 
Wickenberg down to La Paz, Baja California, down to Guaymas, Sonora. As an 
ecoregion; ignore the international boundary. I think that we would be 
another way of looking at it, if you were interested in issues that affect the 
ecoregion, like water supply, water use. That being said, some of the items 
that move the furthest, move the most efficiently, like ocean freight. The 
amount of tonnage that you can put on a boat, and the fact that you can move 
that so much for a certain cost. I think I heard that it’s more efficient to move 
a box of peaches from Chile to Los Angeles, than from Fresno to New York, 
because of the mode of transport. 
 
NH 
I heard something similar with beef from America versus New Zealand. 
 
PV 
Right. So what am I really interested in? Am I interested in business being 
done efficiently, if you assume that efficiency means less carbon footprint? 
Moving things from one hemisphere to another actually makes good sense. 
So there’s a lot of ways to look at it. But as long as we operate culturally as a 
society with expectations that we should always be able to get anything we 
want, if we’re willing to pay for it- somebody’s going to try to take advantage 
of that market, and will try to sell something to you. I would do it. 
 
NH 
I remember 2-for-$4 avocados in Newfoundland being the price because 
island. Winter. Ferry boats, and no road, no bridge. But people wanted it 
because people on the island wanted their guacamole--  
 
PV 
Right… 
 
NH 
--Because green vegetables don’t generally happen unless they’re frying 
greens.  
 
PV 
And there’s some items that are more amenable to moving long distances 
than others. Some go perishable real fast and others don’t. And if you’re 
interested in nutrition, and living healthfully, I think we ought to really focus 
on ways to move produce more efficiently, and supply more people with 
healthy food.  
 
NH 
I think I saw somewhere—it might have been on my professor’s door—that 
says “If you can’t eat local, eat regional; If you can’t eat regional, eat healthy.” 
The idea that it’s the consumer’s prerogative to do what they can; it’s not 
always easy to eat local. 
 
PV 
No. It’s not.

NH 
It can be very expensive.  
 
PV 
Right. There’s economies of scale; I was in the supermarket the other day and 
I was looking at craft beer. And you want to support Tucson-brewed beer. 
But it’s two dollars more than a craft beer from California, and you start to 
weigh those things; I want to support local, but at the same time, I need to 
support my own personal finances because if I don’t support my own 
personal finances, I’m not going to be able to support anybody. But there’s a 
give and a take, and prioritization involves what you value more. There’s 
maybe an aesthetic value to consuming local, more than just the pure value of 
 
what you’re consuming.  
 
NH 
So is there anything else that you think people should know? 
 
PV 
I would just go back to that. There’s a real value to Mexican-produced fruits 
and vegetables. I feel like it’s easy, whenever there’s an issue, it’s easy to 
create a broad headline that kind of broadly stereotypes Mexico, one way or 
another. Recently, there was an issue related to cilantro grown in the state of 
Pueblo. The identifiers of that headline were “Mexico” and “cilantro” in a 
negative way, because there was an outbreak. And that kind of resonates 
throughout the nation, throughout all Mexican produce. So it’s frustrating 
when that happens because somebody who grows table grapes can’t really 
go and try to be responsible for the cilantro growers across the country, on 
the other side of the country. But it affects the table grape growers too when 
the cilantro has an issue. So in a perfect world, all the consumers would be 
ultra-knowledgable. But that’s not going to happen; there’s just too much 
information to digest. I guess one of the issues is to parse out the headlines, 
and think about things, and recognize that Mexico has a very diverse culture 
of production, from very basic levels to very technologically advanced levels. 
And I think the evolution is from being one of those lesser-advanced folks, to 
becoming more advanced. And when you start to institute some of those 
advancements, the goal is to mitigate the risks involved with food safety 
outbreaks. So I think that the evolution of the trend is that things are going to 
get better. But in the meantime, it’s bothersome to see one sector of a 
production economy be affected by an issue completely unrelated. The 
Florida tomato growers sued the FDA because the FDA created a warning 
related to what they thought were Mexican tomatoes. And the Florida guys 
said “We lost market share because people just stopped eating tomatoes in 
general.” It has nothing to do with Florida or Mexico; it’s just media, and the 
fact that the consumer—I hate to tell people how to consume, but you want 
people to be a bit more knowledgeable about the decisions…

I know that, coming from my background as a folklorist, there’s always lots of 
urban legends and rumors about contaminated food from other places- it’s 
just like “Insert other country here.” 
 
PV 
Right.  
 
NH 
Whether it’s beer from Mexico, or meat from China, it’s part of a greater 
cultural trend— 
 
PV 
--It’s always easier to blame the voiceless. And a foreigner tends to be more 
voiceless than somebody local. And Mexico’s definitely dealt with those kinds 
of stigma in the past few decades, related to food and food safety and quality 
and cleanliness of food. I think it’s completely unfounded. The largest 
retailers contract a massive range of different varieties of fruits and 
vegetables grown in Mexico for their U.S. and Canadian retail outlets, because 
they know it’s some of the best.

From my own experience, I’ve had a much easier time eating at a taquería
