[0:00] AG: Hi, Terry, thank you so much for participating in these Library of Congress oral histories. 
Can I ask you to introduce yourself, please? 
  
TM: Hi, my name is Terry Mikovich. 
  
AG: Can I ask you where you grew up, Terry? 
  
TM: I grew up in Chicago. 
  
A: When you were growing up, did your parents work there in Chicago? 
  
TM: Yes, they both worked. 
  
AG: What kind of jobs did they do? 
  
TM: My father worked for the telephone company. Started out as Illinois Bell, and then they went 
through the big split, and then he finished at AT&T. My mother was a secretary. 
  
AG: What about you? Did you enjoy school? Were there any subjects in particular that you were drawn 
to as a young person? 
  
TM: As a young person, I always liked reading, so English was probably one of them. I loved history. 
  
AG: Were there any extracurriculars that you were involved in as you were growing up? 
  
TM: I was a cheerleader in grammar school. I played volleyball, I played softball. Of course, I was in 
the Girl Scouts. 
  
AG: Do you remember when it was that you decided to pursue nursing for your career? 
  
TM: I think I had always thought about it. The funny thing is is that when we look back at old family 
movies, as a little girl you can see me running around with my nurse's hat and my little bag [chuckles]. I 
think it probably wasn't, though, until high school-- I didn't go right to college. I worked for a year. 
When I got out of high school, I think it was then that I had decided. 
  
AG: What kind of work did you do in that in-between year? 
  
TM: I was a cashier in a grocery store. 
  
AG: And then where did you go to school for college? 
  
TM: I started at the community college, College of DuPage, which is in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, and I got 
my BSN from DePaul University in Chicago.

AG: So, while you were in college, at some point, you decided to pursue your BSN. 
  
TM: Yeah, well, I think it was before I went into community college. So, within the year off that I had. 
  
AG: Do you remember what about nursing attracted you? 
  
TM: Helping people. I was always-- I'm the oldest daughter, so I think by nature, I was a caregiver. 
Unfortunately I lost my mother when I was 17, so I had to help take care of my little brothers and my 
sister, so it kind of was a natural transgression in helping people and realizing that there are people that 
just need a lot. 
  
AG: Absolutely. The BSN, that's a bachelor's degree in nursing, is that right? 
  
TM: Right. 
  
AG: Then afterwards, are there still other steps? 
  
TM: Boards. We had to take the state boards. 
  
AG: Do you remember what your first job as a nurse was after completing the education and the boards? 
  
TM: My first job was on a medical floor. They always talked in school about reality shock, and boy, I'll 
tell you, it was reality shock [laughs]. 
  
AG: Was that also in Illinois? 
  
TM: Yeah. Yeah, the first hospital I worked at out of college was Northwestern Medical Center. 
  
AG: Is that in downtown Chicago? 
  
TM: Yeah. It's in downtown Chicago. 
  
AG: What kinds of issues would you see typically on the medical floor at that time in Chicago? 
  
TM: At that time, you saw a little bit of everything. People had strokes or cancer. TB was still an issue 
then, and so part of the floor was infectious disease. We took care of people with TB and other types of 
infections. 
  
AG: What kind of shifts did you work? 
  
TM: I rotated days, evenings and nights. Out of nursing school, there was a horrible nursing shortage, so 
you pretty much worked when you were scheduled. I did a lot of day-night rotation. A lot of times in the 
summer, I would do a lot of evening rotation. 
  
AG: How long were you at Northwestern Hospital?

[5:03] TM: I was at Northwestern, I think, a total of 10 years. Then I went into a community hospital, 
because it was a chance to kind of promote myself. 
  
AG: Did your role change when you moved to the community hospital? 
  
TM: Well, I was a nurse manager. The last five years or so at Northwestern, I worked in critical care, so 
I was a nurse manager in the cardiac surgical ICU. But to be perfectly honest, I did not get along with 
the person I reported to, so I decided it was time to move on. I got a job at a community hospital, and I 
was the head nurse of the coronary care unit. 
  
AG: Wow, that must have been a fairly intense job, to put it lightly. 
  
TM: Sometimes what they call it is, “59 minutes of boredom and a minute a panic” [laughs]. 
  
AG: That was also in Chicago, the community hospital? 
  
TM: Yeah, yeah. 
  
AG: When you're a nurse manager, how does your role change from say, being a bedside nurse or a 
floor nurse? 
  
TM: Well, you're in charge of the scheduling. It depends on the place where you work, and what kind of 
responsibilities they give you. Even though Northwestern was an academic hospital, I'll tell you, I 
learned much more working at a smaller community hospital. You're in charge of staff scheduling, staff 
competencies, continuing education, sometimes input into the budget, participation on different 
committees. 
  
AG: So, it is really a managerial position. 
  
TM: Yeah. Yeah, it is. 
  
AG: When you're a nurse manager, do you have patient contact, typically, or is it more overseeing the 
other nurses? 
  
TM: I would, because like I said, we were always really short, and so there were times I had to take 
patients as well. 
  
AG: Did you see any differences between the patient population at Northwestern to the community 
hospital? 
  
TM: Oh, a big difference. The community hospital was a Catholic hospital. It was in a largely Polish 
area. It served the surrounding neighborhood. A lot of people were, I don't want to say indigent, but 
were working class as opposed to the upper middle class at Northwestern.

AG: Right, that makes sense, because of the different [unintelligible] and stuff. Got it. How long were 
you in that role at the community hospital? 
  
TM: I think I was in that role three years. I went to graduate school. I didn't get my Master's in nursing; I 
got it in public services. I always had this thought in the back of my head, "But what if something 
happens that I can't be a nurse anymore? I need to learn different things." I got that, and then there was 
an opportunity to go into the home care department at the hospital where I worked as the director of 
home care. Not a good way to start your career in home care [laughs]. Oh, boy. But I did it, and it was a 
job I thought, "Well, I'll do this for a year or two to see if I really like it." But when I was orienting to it 
and I went out to see patients, I can remember one patient I saw, and I had seen he was a patient of ours 
in the coronary care unit, and he was sent home on a lot of cardiac meds. I'm going through his meds 
and I said to him, "Where's your digoxin? It's important for you to take that." And he says to me, 
"Honey, I can't afford that stuff." That was kind of like a moment of enlightenment, so to speak, in terms 
of, "What are we doing?" [laughs] 
  
A: You're sort of discharging people and they might not have the means to follow-- 
  
TM: But everybody agrees to it when they come, and you get home and-- 
  
AG: As the director of the home care services, you were also seeing patients in their home? 
  
TM: Yeah, periodically. 
  
AG: What role did you play when you went to the home? 
  
TM: Well, you go and you do an assessment. It's based on what you are needed for. Let's say, for 
example, if somebody was a diabetic, you'd go and check their blood, check their blood sugar, see how 
they're doing with their diet, take their vital signs, check their medications, that sort of thing. 
  
AG: It sounds like in this particular role, you saw a lot of patients who weren't sort of able to adhere to 
the medication or to the instructions. 
 
[10:22] TM: Right. I saw one patient who was a diabetic, and oddly enough, it was on Christmas 
morning when I saw him. One of the things you do is ask them about their diet, and they say, "Oh, I'm 
fine, I'm fine." One of the things you ask them, "Is it okay if I look in your refrigerator?" I open up this 
guy's refrigerator, all he had was a dozen eggs. I asked him about it and he just said, "Oh, it'll be fine. 
God'll take care of me." I was like, "How can you argue that?" [laughs]. 
  
AG: That sounds very difficult. 
  
TM: Yeah. 
  
AG: In that role, was there any way for you to connect them with other social services? 
  
TM: Yeah, we would do that. We always had social workers that would help with that as well.

AG: You were the director of home care services for how many years in Chicago? 
  
TM: Maybe about six or seven years. Then I left there, and I kind of started in home care at the wrong 
level. So, I got a different job, took a step down so I could learn what it was, which was probably the 
best thing that I could have done. Then after that, and that was for a couple years, and then after that, I 
got another job as the director of home care services at a hospital that did serve-- 45% of it were the 
indigent patients, but I did much better then. I think it was at that time, because it was a very mission-
oriented hospital, and I think that job kind of more or less defined who I was, that I'm not like the 
corporate type, but I am sort of the mission type thing. 
  
AG: You took a step back so that you could be more essentially, like, directly involved with the 
patients? 
  
TM: Right. So I could learn some of the basics that I really kind of never learned at first going in. 
  
AG: Contrasting the mission-based approach and corporate hospital, what did you see as some of the 
differences in like, healthcare delivery or patient interactions? 
  
TM: The mission-based, of course, they were interested in taking care of the patient. They worked 
harder. You worked with next to nothing, and the budget was always, always tight, but their primary 
goal was to take care of the patients, as opposed to working in more of the corporate-- I don't want to 
say corporate, 'cause hospitals weren't corporate, but when you work in one that's more financially 
driven to always make a profit, you just... 
  
AG: Some patient care is sacrificed in the private sector? 
  
TM: Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
  
AG: How did you make your way to working for them? 
  
TM: I went through about a two or three year period where things just didn't go well, and I just 
[chuckles] got jobs to pay the mortgage, so to speak. I was at this one job, and I was flipping through a 
magazine on my lunch hour, and I saw an ad for the VA, and they were looking for a program director 
for their home-based primary care. Now, the funny thing is, my dad was a World War II veteran, and he 
would always tell me, "Go to the VA. Go to the VA," [chuckles] and I would never do it, and I'm kinda 
glad I didn't, because it's such a different world. I saw that and I interviewed, and I started at Heinz VA 
in the Chicago area, and then decided on a change of scenery and was sat on my lunch hour and just 
thought, "Well, if I was going to move, where would I go?" I would just flip through the job sites, and 
the one in DC came up and so I interviewed, got it, and moved. 
  
AG: That's terrific. So, just kind of on a whim, you picked-- 
  
[15:08] TM: Well, it's funny 'cause it wasn't even the job I applied for. Then I got an email from my first 
boss that I had there, and she said, "With all your home care experience, wouldn't you consider this 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
8 
 
role?" At the time when they advertised it, they advertised for a nurse practitioner in the role and I'm not 
a nurse practitioner. So, I said it to her. She said, "Well, you know," and I think it was vacant for a long 
time. All my interviews were done over the phone. I never met anybody face-to-face until I moved here. 
  
AG: What a leap of faith. 
  
TM: Yeah, it really was [laughs]. 
  
AG: How long have you been at the DC VA? 
  
TM: It will be 14 years this coming December. 
  
AG: Quite a while. 
  
TM: Yeah. 
  
AG: When you were at the Heinz VA in Chicago, were you also doing home-based care at that time? 
  
TM: Right. That's what I was hired into. 
  
AG: What is the home-based care department like in the VA? 
  
TM: Right. Home-based primary care is different from home care in the private sector. Home-based 
primary care is a primary care clinic in the home. It's an interdisciplinary team that has nurse 
practitioners, RN's, social workers, psychologists, dieticians. We have one little physical therapist 
[laughs]. 
  
AG: ...as a team to visit patients, or is it more... 
  
TM: Yeah, but they don't go out together. It'll start with the nurse practitioner and the RN going out to 
make an admission visit once we get the referral. Then after that, the rest of the team goes out within, 
like, a 30-day period. 
  
AG: Got it. Typically, where do the referrals for home-based primary care come from? 
  
TM: They come from either the inpatient side of the hospital or other primary care clinics that are seeing 
people and they realize that the patient is starting to decline. 
  
AG: Someone might be discharged from an inpatient facility needing more care. 
  
TM: Right. 
  
AG: What are some of the typical diagnoses that you might see in a home-based care primary visit? 
  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
9 
 
TM: Heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, just your elderly person who's 
debilitated just because of age, Parkinson's disease, ALS. A lot of veterans have a lot of comorbidities, 
so some of them might have heart disease, lung disease and diabetes at the same time. 
  
AG: Are they typically more advanced in the primary care home-based sector? 
  
TM: It varies. It'll vary. 
  
AG: Now, in your current position, you're directing the entire DC home-based care primary division, is 
that right?  
 
TM: Right. 
 
AG: How many nurses or how many staff are under you in that role? 
  
TM: I have 10 nurses under me. Even though other disciplines work there, they report to their own 
discipline. The psychologists report to mental health, social work to social work, although we've all 
worked together for a long time, so everybody works as a team. 
  
AG: How many patients altogether would you say that your division sees? 
  
TM: The total census right now is 270. Each team has usually a panel of 70 to 75 patients, usually 
running around seventy, maybe one-- We have a rural health team that's in Southern Maryland, 'cause 
there's a clinic down there and that's like 50 miles away from the hospital, and they never had any home 
care. We were able to get a grant one year and we developed a team. 
  
AG: What is the geographic spread of your patients? 
  
TM: Northern DC, Northern Virginia, we see people within a 30-mile radius of the hospital, although 
the patients on the Southern Maryland team, because driving is so much different there-- Traffic in the 
DC area is terrible at best. The Southern Maryland team will go 50 miles out, 'cause it doesn't take them 
that long to get there. 
  
AG: As a director, what is your typical day like? 
 
[20:00] TM: If you'd been there today, you would have thought I was crazy [laughs]. I have to make 
sure everybody follows the Joint Commission standards. I have to make sure everybody follows hospital 
policies. I have to make sure there's enough supplies. I am kind of like the gatekeeper between patients 
who are referred and turned away, so to speak. Everybody does their own scheduling. I would have to 
say that the teams do really well at governing themselves. I kind of step in when I see that it's kind of 
going off the beaten path. Every week, we have interdisciplinary team meetings, and that's where 
everybody is in the same meeting, and they talk about the patients and we solve any issues at that point. 
  
AG: What kind of issues rise to the level of your intervention? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
10 
 
TM: It could be a caregiver that's not satisfied with the care, and you have to explain that. Could be a 
couple of people on the team aren't getting along, and so you have to figure that one out. Sometimes 
there might be a crisis on one team that requires another person to help, and so I have to intervene in 
that. 
  
AG: In your role, are you in the field? 
  
TM: Yeah, I'm pretty central. I'll go out with the nurses once a year for a supervisory visit. 
  
AG: Are you based in the hospital in DC, or do you work from your home? 
  
TM: We've been working from home a lot now because of COVID, but in normal times we're based in 
the hospital. I would go in every day. The staff wouldn't. They all have always been pretty remote, and 
that's, by and large, because they don't have the room. There's not enough space for everybody. But I 
would go in every day, but now, since COVID, I maybe go in once or twice a week, and the rest of the 
time is at home. 
  
AG: What are your typical hours? 
  
TM: Eight to four, 7:30 to four. But since I've been working at home, [chuckles] could be 7:30, 'cause 
that's a very easy thing to do, because you're not commuting or anything. I could take a break, I have 
dinner. I think, "Oh, I gotta finish this," but I get back online. 
  
AG: Right? It just kind of creeps into your life when you're working from home. 
  
TM: You know, and just this past weekend, I thought yesterday about getting-- "Nope, you are not doing 
it. Just leave it alone for a day." [chuckles] 
  
AG: In your role as director, what would you say is the most challenging aspect of this current position? 
  
TM: Oh, there's so many. I participate a lot on a national website with, 'cause the home-based primary 
care program is a nationwide VA program, so there's, like, 153 of 'em. We're all on the same mail group 
and we have monthly calls and all that other kind of stuff. I think the biggest challenge, taking care of 
the staff so they can take care of the veterans. That's always a big challenge, 'cause the veterans, they're 
a very rewarding population to provide care to but they also can be very challenging. 
  
AG: What do you think the most rewarding aspect of your current role is? 
  
TM: Well, [unintelligible], caring for the veterans. It's a big job, and it is a job that you have to care. 
You have to carry a lot of ethics with you and a lot of morals with you, and realize that the people you're 
taking care of are the people that fought for you. You just have to do the best you can to make sure that 
they get what they need. 
  
AG: Are there any lessons you try to impart, for example, to the staff that works beneath you about 
working with this particular patient population? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
11 
 
  
[25:12] TM: I think one of the big challenges especially is safety, safety of the staff. That's one thing 
that I always impart on them when they're making a visit. I could give them any referral I want, but if 
they walk into the home and in their gut, they feel like, "Something's really wrong here," they need to 
turn around and walk out. I always try to get that across to them. They are required to do so much 
training on their own, and they know they have to do it, and so, that becomes a challenge. I always try to 
enforce and keep-- I don't want to say force, more encourage or promote the value of teamwork and the 
fact that even though we're a small group of people, if we stick together as a team, we could get it done. 
  
AG: Have your nurses encountered any safety issues in the field? 
  
TM: Not any kind of threats towards them, but it's more like the neighborhood that they're in might not 
be the best. Sometimes family members might not be real nice, which really could be a safety issue. 
  
AG: Do you typically like going to work in this role? 
  
TM: I do, and I feel really lucky doing that, that I can honestly say, when I wake up in the morning, I do 
not dread going to work. When people always tell me that, I just think-- and they're like, "Aren't you 
like," and I'm like, "No." I've always liked what I've done, and if it got to the point where I really didn't 
like what I was doing, then I left, because then you don't do any good for anybody. 
  
AG: How long have you been a nurse? 
  
TM: Since 1978. 
  
AG: Oh, yeah. And not quite half, but a good chunk of your nursing has been with the VA? 
  
TM: Yeah, yeah. I think I'm typically-- I guess I'm old enough to be considered a battle axe. 
  
AG: Have you seen changes inside the VA over the course of your career with them? 
  
TM: Oh, sure. Yeah. 
  
AG: What kinds of things strike you as being the biggest changes you've witnessed? 
  
TM: The change to telehealth. Of course, COVID introduced a lot of changes, and very quickly. The 
change to more remote working. The VA has expanded a lot. They do a lot of great things. They get 
such bad press, but they do a lot of great things. 
  
AG: Did your role change significantly when the COVID quarantine started? 
  
TM: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was still going in, and then my boss said to me, "Do what you have to do, but 
go home and work." I was on calls pretty much every day with COVID updates and staff meetings once 
a week or more often, or emails, so people stay current with the information, 'cause there was so much 
of it out there, that we had to pick and choose who you listen to before you gave the information out.

Lots more time on the phone, lots more time talking to the staff, 'cause it was really stressful for 
everybody. 
  
AG: I imagine it must have been very harrowing to go into the field. 
  
TM: Well, everybody was remote pretty much for a long time. Because the veterans and the caregivers,  
they-- We would always ask them the question-- The staff would always ask them the question, because 
what we had to do was, some people needed their medication boxes filled, some people needed blood 
drawn, so we always had to ask if it was okay. Some people said, "No," and some people said, "Yes," 
but I have a very creative staff. I had a nurse who would call ahead and tell her patients she was coming 
over to fill the pill boxes, leave it outside the door. She would get it and she would go fill it up in her 
car, then she would call 'em and tell 'em, "Come and get your medicine." Another nurse had one 
particular patient who really didn't live in the best of areas, and so she would go over and pick it up, take 
it home, fill it up, drive it back. One nurse during winter was drawing blood. She had the guy sticking 
his arm out the door of the assisted living facility. She's got her coat on [laughs], but it was done. 
  
AG: Did they have to wear the same kind of protective equipment that [unintelligible] floor nurses 
would? 
  
[30:37] TM: Well, we had to wear masks, face shields, gowns if you were drawing blood, gloves. 
  
AG: In some places, there was some difficulty getting those. Those were available for the most part 
when you needed them? 
  
TM: For the most part. There were things I bought out of my own pocket, 'cause I would try to get them, 
they didn't have any. I would get online with Amazon. I thought, well, "Whatever it takes," 'cause I 
didn't want anybody sick on my watch. 
  
AG: Was there a big toll of COVID on the nurses? 
  
TM: In the hospital there was, but we didn't-- one person with COVID, but I don't think she got it from a 
patient. We did really good, and she did fine. She recovered. 
  
AG: How do you think COVID affected the VA system overall? 
  
TM: I think it pulled it together. The director of [unintelligible] runs the hospital, he was outstanding in 
his communication to the staff and with doling out the appropriate information and everything. What I 
saw was everybody really worked together, everybody, to get through it. A friend of mine asked me how 
I was doing afterwards, and I look back and I said, "That was the hardest year in my career." It was just 
hard [laughs]. That's all I can say. 
  
AG: For nurses-- 
  
TM: Yeah.

AG: It was this whole other experience. 
  
TM: It was. 
  
AG: Do you think that the COVID pandemic had a negative impact on nurses, like, leaving the 
profession [unintelligible]? 
  
TM: I don't know if anybody left. I'm sure people burned out. In terms of me, if people put it in for 
vacation, I gave 'em whatever vacation they wanted. The hospital itself has a wellness program who put 
out wellness exercise classes in the evenings, like Tai Chi and yoga, and put out things for people like, 
"Take a 15 minute break." I think that it did a lot for leadership realizing that everybody has to stay 
healthy. 
  
AG: You've been touching on this, but are there any lessons that you're gonna take forward from that 
COVID-19 period? 
  
TM: Oh, yeah. I work out with a trainer a couple times a week. Even when we were all locked down, I 
would do the online exercises. A lot of people talked about how they gained weight during COVID. I 
lost 20 pounds. I worked to do that. I thought, "I'm not gonna do that," [laughs]. What it taught me was 
to take a step back and take care of myself. In meetings that I was in and everything, they would always 
remind you, "You've gotta take care of yourself," and so forth. 
  
AG: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think the role of nurses is generally in 
providing patient care or patient advocacy. 
  
TM: Well, there are patient advocates, first and foremost, that really, in my mind, should be the biggest 
priority. I think the role of nurses, besides caregivers, are teachers to educate patients, to work to 
promote autonomy in people to take care of themselves, to stress the importance of taking care of 
themselves. 
  
AG: Has your approach to nursing changed over the course of your career, do you think? 
  
TM: Yeah, I think a lot. 
  
AG: Oh, yeah. 
  
[34:54] TM: When I first got out of school I was like Clara Barton and all these people [laughs], and 
then when you get a little bit older and everybody gets just a little bit jaded, but then when you start 
looking at the reality of things, you're just kind of like, "Hey, you got to help us here." Home care is a lot 
like that. That's one thing that I like about it, because one of the things is that you have to encourage 
people to be autonomous in their own care. It just kind of changes the conversation you have with 
people. It changes the way you help them out. 
  
AG: Are there aspects of being a floor nurse that you miss, or are there similarities between the role that 
you have now and roles that you had early on as an RN?

TM: Sometimes I miss the camaraderie, because being a manager can be a lonely job. But, I'm fortunate 
in the staff that I have that they all get along really well together. I kind of miss that camaraderie, and I 
have to step back sometimes and keep reminding myself, "They're the people that work together. They 
have to get along" [chuckles]. Some of it is similar, I would think, because I still-- I talk to a lot of 
people over the phone. I have to relay a lot of messages, relay a lot of patient symptoms. I have to keep 
up a certain level of knowledge, even though I'm not directly in it. 
  
AG: Is there anyone, or multiple people, perhaps, over the course of your career that you think of as  
professional role models or mentors? 
  
TM: No. I would say probably my current boss now, which is kind of funny, 'cause I've only reported to 
her for a couple of years, but I'd known her, and she was working in the quality department before she 
got her own promotion. I got to know her when we were getting ready for a Joint Commission, and she 
would help me out with the quality. She always had a lot of good advice. I will say, nursing overall has 
changed to be a much more respected profession than what it was then. Then it was just kind of like you 
did your job and that's it. You're a nurse; you're supposed to be responsible for everything [laughs]. 
Now, that is totally different. 
  
AG: Do you think that it's the implementation of these interdisciplinary teams that has changed some of 
the nursing role? 
  
TM: Yeah. Oh, definitely. Definitely, because everybody has to learn what everybody else does. You 
learn the difference in the roles and you learn how to collaborate as professionals with people, and that's 
one thing that I really like.   
 
AG: Having more people with compatible or different expertise has actually led to a circumstance where 
nurses as a profession have more respect in the workplace? 
 
TM: Yeah. In my experience, yeah, I think so. 
  
AG: Do you think that nurses have additional authority in the hospital, like the home care setting? 
  
TM: I don't know. It's been a long time since I worked inpatient, but I will say that in the home care 
setting, we're listened to a lot more, 'cause the nurses are the eyes and ears of the physician out there. 
  
AG: Are there any services that you would like to see either improved or provided for veterans that don't 
currently exist, or that exist but could be expanded? 
  
TM: Well, they do have an ALS clinic, and I think that would be a great thing to be expanded. In terms 
of services, gosh, they do so much. They have all of the primary specialty clinics. The telehealth just 
keeps growing and growing. I would like us to develop another team that goes further down into 
Virginia, because there is a gap down there between what we take care of and the Richmond VA takes 
care of. That's one of my dreams.

AG: What would you say for younger, newer nurses? What might you say are some of the benefits of 
pursuing a career at the VA, rather than perhaps like a private sector facility? 
  
[40:20] TM: If they go into the VA, as long as you get through the probationary period, you pretty much 
have a job for life, unless you really screw up, which rarely happens. I think that one of the advantages 
is learning a lot more physiology, learning a lot more pharmacology, because the veterans have so many 
unique challenges, so many unique health problems that you would never see in the private sector, and if 
you did, you would not understand the importance of them, like somebody that works in the VA does. 
  
AG: Could you give just a couple examples of some of the specific conditions that you? 
  
TM: You have veterans that worked in Vietnam that were exposed to Agent Orange, and so that in itself  
can bring a lot of chronic health problems, not only to the veteran but to their kids if they have kids. 
That's the [unintelligible] what studies-- studies find out. That itself is interesting. A lot of veterans in 
the Air Force are very hard of hearing because of the loud planes and everything. ALS. A lot of veterans 
get ALS. 
  
AG: Is that caused from some aspect of military service? 
  
TM: I don't think that they have anything really definite. Things that I've read, it could be a combination 
of things: exposure to toxins, severe weather changes. I even read an article one time that talked about 
some marathon runners are at higher risk of developing it because of the constant pressure on their joints 
and nerves. 
  
AG: What would you say, when you think back over the course of your career, what are some of the 
highlights that, if any, come to mind of working at the VA in particular? 
  
TM: I think just doing well in the Joint Commission survey. I think the highlight really came when I 
worked out here, because I had to build the program up from what it was when I started. It's now 
probably about three times as big as it was when I first started. I was able to participate with a physician 
who did his fellowship there, and he wrote a book on integrative medicine, so I was able to write a 
chapter with somebody else on interprofessional care. That was a really good experience. 
  
AG: That's really wonderful. This is like a textbook? 
  
TM: Yeah, yeah. 
  
AG: So cool! 
  
TM: I got a free copy and everything. 
  
AG: Well, I want to thank you so much for taking the time. 
  
TM: Oh sure. This was fun.

AG: Really fun. 
  
TM: It really made me think. It's just like wow, really, wow. I've been around a while [laughs]. 
  
AG: Gives you that opportunity to reflect [laughs]. 
  
TM: Yeah [laughs].
