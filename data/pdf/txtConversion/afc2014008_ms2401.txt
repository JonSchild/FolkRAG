Dear Johnny:
 
I have really tried to get letters written,
 
but I have not been able to find some ne who would come over
 
and let me dictate to them on the typewriter,  its just like
 
finding a yard worker,  imposslble ---- 
we hear about hard times
 
and unemployment, but as far as I can tell its just not wanting
 
to work.
 I have felt so rotten since aout ChristmasthT THAT I ha
 
have just dragged around, wanting only to lie down.
 Besides
 
that Tom has had five spells in the past six weeksl only onw
 
trip to the hospital thank goodnes.
 Have finally found an
 
arthritis medicine that doesn't aake me sick, and another doc-
changed the heart stuff a bit and I am no longer woozy every
 
step,  feel as tho I am falling.
 
Of course I was so sorry that I I could not get
 
to Houston.
 1 To me,  it was so wonderful how the whole family
 
rallied around to help you.
 When I watch through the years
 
how shabbily Tom's family care----money is their one concern.
 
He does not feel well enough to try to travel,  several of our
 
trips have been ruined by an attack of angina away from home.
 
I have not seen Susan and her family for a year and somehow I
 
will get there this summer.
 
I: am enclosing the letter your Mother sent to
 
me about the Lomax furniture.
 At the time we cleared out the
 
House in the Woods,  I was living in the dorm and my home leased;
 
Alan in a one bedroom walkup in the Village; Bess in a rental
 
which was to be dorn down for a freeway,  so storage was offered
 
in Houston.
 I had vis ted Joe twice and gone over that subject
 
with him on both occasions.
 I also sent him Mimi's letter and
 
his reaction to that was a query as to how I had the rig t  to
 
"take his bed from under his body".
 It was no more his than
 
Bess"s or mine.
 
I did want my h mosher's bed but I am sure it
 
went to someone else,  I was called by the storage people here
 
yesterday that I had something,  I asked what and they said it
 
was all crated and they could not tell.
 I'll get down there
 
next weeki and start paying storage until there is some;one who
 
can luse it.
 
Good luck on your new venture

Lovingly

T itie d
ear • I have s
eemed to heglest you this time •
 A l
etter vent to you
 
to Cambridge, but Miss Lar addressed i
t and sent it to 10 University Ha i
l
 
an
d although I
 took i
t to the train, the train was moving as I
 ran up to
 
i
t and I did
. not have time to change the address.  I
t had a special stamp
 
on i
t and i
t ought to have gotten to you in time. I do hope the one I sent
 
t. Charlottesville -
 I think I s
ent two there -
 esmiestod with you, and
 
I an sure unless the mails a
re all wrong that the one I sent to Kn xvi f
lo
 
connected.  New, this i
s the last, and I t
o want i
t to catch you and 80  I
 
an going to take i
t to the train again wjsolf at neon today.
 
I
 want you to be reassured about Allen.  He recovered rapidly after the
 
abee f
l was l
anced.  That i
s, 1e was f
ree of fever I
D the next morning and
 
has had none sino*.  After he got over the pain of the cutting he ha4l no
 
mere except sheeting pains through his e
ar at intervals, but no steady
 
aching or pain.  He was up yesterday f
rom about ten until abo t 5
:30.  But
 
I cannot say that he looks well yet an
d I am net going to s
end him to schpol
 
to
msrr.w, at least, and maybe not for several days and maybe net at all
 
before you some home.
 
But the chapter of accidents that seems to open whenever you leave i
s not
 
c
omplete with Allen.  Friday evening late a o
ar drove up and John's friends
 
lowered h
im out and helped him into the house with a sprained ankle.  B. has
 
not had his foot on the ground yet and Dr. Weller sapdit must not be s
tep-
ped on f
or three weeks.  Judging f
rom the fact that i
t is net very badly
 
swollen I c
res u
se i
t i
s net a very bad sprain.  S. f
ar nothing has been done
 
for i
t except rest.  Tomorrow Dr. Weller will bind i
t in a casing of ad-
hesive tape and he will be mere ccmf.rtablo.  He sprained i
t sliding for
 
hem..  I spent an hour yestertdy enquiring around and succeeded in bor-
rowing a
. apir of c
rutches  for his and in the afternoon drove him over and
 
I
 
parket him at the track meet ant went back for hin at six,  It i
s &*in& to
 
be a blessing that we have a car because John won't road more than about
