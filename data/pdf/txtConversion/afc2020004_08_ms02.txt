[Craig Santos Perez reads "Off-Island CHamorus"] 
Craig Santos Perez:  Thanks for listening to my poem. I wrote this several years ago, thinking 
about that memory: the first day at my new high school after migrating and being asked to 
point out my homeland on this large map. But because Guam and the Marianas are such tiny 
islands, it wasn’t actually on the map. So that’s why I’d make the joke about being from an 
invisible archipelago. And so much of my experience of being in the diaspora has been one of 
invisibility. But poetry, thankfully, has given me a space to make my story and culture and 
homelands more visible, and to really honor the experiences of those of us who have migrated 
away from home, who are still trying to cultivate a sense of belonging.
