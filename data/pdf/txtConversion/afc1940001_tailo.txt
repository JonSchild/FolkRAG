This is Boney Ford up in Central Valley, California, and I'll singya THE TAILOR BOY and my brother Pat
will sing ya in a minute or twoTHE KEYHOLE IN THE DOOR.
Oh, a tailor boy went out one night, some candles for to buy.He stepped into the candler's shop to
neither look nor spy.But he looked all around and he looked and he peekedBut no one could be
heard'Til he heard above him a (three knocks), right over the tailor boy's head.Now the tailor being
a nimble chap, he quickly ran upstairs,And there he found his master Jack and the candler's wife
so fair.His muster Jack had the candler's wife right up against the wall,And he was playing (three
knocks) any tune you're a mind to call.Now, the candler's wife raised up and said, "Young man, what
are you doing here ? ""Oh, I [?] have came some candles for to buy and not to interfere.""Now, tailor
boy, your secrets keep and tell no one [a tall?] at all ,And you shall have your (three knocks) any time
you're a mind to call."
