Interviewer: Okay. And how did you become a domestic worker? No, no, no, let me go 
back. What brought you to the United States, if you care to talk about that? Tell me 
what brought you to the United States? 
Well, I just came on a vacation, really, never really been interested to come here, but I

is about. Yeah. 
00:01:05 
Interviewer: And what did you find when you came? Really? How so? 
I was so disappointed. 
I don't know. Just the way the placed looked, everybody back home always talked about 
America this and America that, and then I come to America, and it's like, 'What?' Back 
home is better than this. You know you'd swear the roads were paved with gold or

something. Like really? Everybody lives in apartments, where are the houses? And it's 
like, yeah, just different. 
00:01:33 
Interviewer: Interesting. How did you become a domestic worker? 
Well, being here I came on vacation so to make a little extra buck my sister got me into 
it, you know, just to do a little something while I'm here. To babysit and then after when 
I went home and came back that is what I started to do. Babysitter and housekeeper, 
whenever I could get it. 
00:02:02 
Interviewer: I hear that. So how long have you done this work? How long? Too long as in 
how much? 
My god. Too long. Since 2000. 
00:02:18 
Interviewer: What motivated you to be a part of this project? Why do this? Why be a 
part of the chronicling or archiving of the voices of the women in the Library of 
Congress? Why just why? 
I don't know, just, well. Why. So that people could look back on years later and hear my 
voice and hear what we--what I have to say about my experiences, I guess. 
00:02:48 
Interviewer: So walk me through a typical daily routine on the job that you do as a 
housekeeper/nanny. What are you day-to-day responsibilities? So speak respectively to 
one at a time.  
Oh, in which one? I try not to do the both of them together. Okay, let me see. Well, if 
I'm a housekeeper, it depends, some people--well, I'm doing a housekeeping job now 
and I go in the mornings and I have to wash, which I hate [laughter.] I hate to wash but I 
don't like to wash for, you know, especially when they have three sets of stairs to go up 
and down, up and down. But the people are very nice. I can eat anything and drink 
anything, so that's a plus. 
00:03:35 
Interviewer: You could drink wine? 
I can drink anything they buy. I don't drink alcohol on the job, yeah, but what was I 
supposed to be--I forgot. Oh, typical day. I go in, put the clothes first to wash and then 
just start to clean--it's a big house. Yeah, I start to clean the bathroom, the kitchen, just 
be up and down, but it's difficult when you have to go in the basement and look at the 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

clothes, I have to come up on the first and go on the second floor, it's like, 'Oh, really?' 
Sometimes the money isn't even worth it, but you have to make a living so you just have 
to do what you have to do to pay the bills. 
00:04:15 
Interviewer: And the nanny job, what are the responsibilities? I mean I hear that you 
talk about housekeeping and laundry, but the nanny, what is the procedure what is the 
responsibility? Walk me through a day-by-day, yeah? What are the ages of your kids, if 
you care to say?  
Well, taking care of the child. You have to take them to school, pick them up; it depends 
on how old or how young the child is, first of all. Well, right now I do mostly 
housekeeping. 
Whenever I get babies I tell you what I do, but the job I used to have before, the girl she 
was three years so I used to have to go in the afternoon. She used to go to whole day 
school so when I'd go I used to clean, cook, I don't know who told me to tell that lady I 
could cook [laughter.] I so ever regretted that. It's true, when I went on the interview 
she just asked me and I like, '[inaudible.] and I'm a Trini, what do you mean if I can I 
cook?' and she said, 'Oh, you can cook,' I said, 'Well, that wasn't for you, that was just I 
can cook,' and well, I regretted that to this day. 
00:05:32 
Interviewer: Why? What do you regret? What specifically? What was it she wanted you 
to cook? Specify a dish, because you're right, West Indian cooking is not no easy feat. 
Well because she wanted me to cook this cook that and do all kinds of things-- I just 
used to cook Trini style for her--Well if she tell me like cook fish, I will do it like I know it 
from home, I season it like how we season it and cook it--she wants rice in the crock pot, 
what crock pot? I put on the rice, boil the water on the stove, and crock pot is like three, 
four hours, look, but I could boil rice in 20 minutes or 15. I never used to do it, and I 
used to tell her, 'I don't use that crock pot.' No. It's such a long work. You know, pick up 
from school, some days I used to wash the clothes first year and the mom when the 
grandmother come from India I used to have to wash for she too. I used to be like, 'Look 
all you paid me for all of this?' 
00:06:28 
Interviewer: Your folks, the folks you worked for were from India? 
Yeah, the mum, yeah, from India, but the daughter she's--looking at her you wouldn't 
know that the mom is from-- that she's half Indian, because she's just completely 
Caucasian. But the mom, she had it through, like she went up clinic and said, 'I want that 
[inaudible.] egg there.'

00:06:53 
 
Interviewer: I see. So tell me, what skill do you need to be a domestic worker? Is there 
skill? 
 
I don't think there's a skill, because I learn all this thing back home. I know how to take 
care of a child and you know clean, I could cook, so I don't think you really need a skill, 
you just have to be able to do what you're supposed to do, I don't think you need a skill. 
 
00:07:18 
 
Interviewer: And this might be a part with that--what training is necessary to be a 
successful domestic worker? In your mind's eye, what training? 
 
Maybe, like how to deal with a child, some of them could be difficult sometimes. I 
remember when I started with this particular child she used to give some terrible 
tantrums. Whine, whine. I'd be like look; I don't deal with this kind of thing. And if I 
speak once, that is it. You don't ask me something or do something more than once 
more than once, it's like, listen I tell the mother, 'Look. I deal with this time out and 
thing. I don't know what is that, what is time out? Time out of what?' you know, so I 
used to tell her, 'Look, if you say something once that is how it is supposed to be, she's 
not supposed to be asking you more than once and do this do that she can't have her 
own way' and the mom said, and I used to talk to her and ask her, 'Well what do you do 
and what do you want me to do? Because I don't want to do something that you're not 
satisfied with and you--' and she said, 'Hazel, whatever you're doing, that is what we're 
doing, so you discipline her however you want to.' And I say, 'Yeah, uh huh, you hear 
what your mummy say?' You know she really used to whine and one time, I think we 
were coming up on Park Slope and sometimes she never used to want to listen, like 
when we were crossing the road she don't want me to hold her hand sometime, and I 
said, 'Not on my watch. You can do that with your mother, but you see me? When I'm 
taking care of kids, don't ever try to do that,' and I saw two policemen, and I came up to 
them and I said, 'Excuse, officer So-and-So,' I saw it on his jacket and I said, 'You see 
this? This is Sawyer and I want you all to speak to her for me because she don't listen to 
me, her mother, or her grandmother sometimes, and sometimes when she's crossing 
the street she don't want me to hold her hands and can you speak to her? Or you can 
take her to jail. It's okay with me, you can take her to jail.' Yeah, you know sometimes 
you have to put a little fright into them, they have to fear somebody, because I mean 
she respected me but sometimes she still did things I didn't like and she was only three 
and I told her mother that I did that, and let me tell you. Any time she whined, she do 
anything, I'm just going to, 'Hello, Ms. Officer so-and-so, come and get Sawyer?' And 
she'll ask me, 'You going to call the police?' and I say, 'Yes.' 
 
00:09:46 
 
Interviewer: The mother had no problem with that? You know how mothers are so 
sensitive in this culture where-- 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
4
No, she didn't have a problem because--Yeah, no she didn't have a problem at all. But I 
did that once to the next girl, and they didn't like that. 
 
00:10:00 
 
Interviewer: So, on that note, is there any special skill that you might have taught your 
employer? Is there anything you brought to your employer that might have been new? 
You know that, I guess from your culture that, you know-- 
 
Yeah, well, sometimes I tell her, well like the cooking, sometimes I used to share my 
views, like things she could do with her and how she could talk to her sometimes, 
because sometimes she didn't even--when she speaks once, just tell her, don't keep 
talking to her about the same thing, the same thing, and the same thing. You know, just 
talk once and that's it. You know, if she don't listen--well, the situation you do 
something don't keep repeating yourself, she has to listen--learn to listen. And after that 
she would do what she was supposed to do, you only have to speak to her once and 
then you ignore her, she didn't like that. 
 
00:10:55 
 
Interviewer: So what conditions to you face throughout your work experience as a 
domestic worker in the industry? What conditions? You could specify one, something 
that really berated you or that you really had a hard time with and you couldn't grapple 
with it, because we all do, there's always that one thing that nudges, really nudges--you 
know you want to go home when you can't go home, what are the conditions? You 
know, sometimes certain foods you might eat that aren't in the fridge, or you have some 
of these employers that are kosher and they have specific types of food and you're privy 
to eat. 
 
Oh my god. Well, a lot of work, a little bit of money. Sometimes the hours.  
 
I used to work for kosher people already, and they used to say, 'Don't bring any food,' 
and I used to be like, 'Uh uh.' I used to bring in my food I just never used to let them see 
it. 
 
00:11:59 
 
Interviewer: Could I just say this? One of my friends had made a macaroni pie and she 
was working for some Jewish people in New Jersey, and they tell her don't bring your 
food, and she had to throw out her food, I asked her, 'How did that make you feel?' I 
mean, you make your Sunday lunch and you come in Sunday to work to begin your 
workweek and you have to throw it out. 
 
Yeah, I have a friend now, she's a nanny in Manhattan and she used to work for some 
Jews before, I think twin girls, she couldn't bring their tea, use their cups, had to bring 
everything Brooklyn, but sometimes you know you want the job you don't have another 
choice, you just get something and you want to hold on, because you have your rent to 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
5
pay, bills, whatever, you have a little child you're bringing up and you just have to deal 
with whatever and that is so unfair, because you're doing all this work and you're taking 
care of their precious, their most precious possession and sometimes they just don't 
care, you know? 
 
Chris Mule: That's a really interesting condition you talked about-- 
 
Interviewer: What is the condition? 
 
Chris Mule:  No, no, that was perfect. You both talked about kosher families. 
 
Interviewer: Yeah. But could you imagine cooking that Sunday meal and bringing that 
Sunday meal and having to throw it out because you're respecting another culture 
another religious right? And you have your rights too? 
 
Imagine I throw away my pie? No, uh uh.  
 
Interviewer: Your macaroni pie. 
 
Not me. I wasn't throwing away that.  
 
Interviewer: [laughter.] Macaroni pie is so precious to the Islanders. 
 
I would tell her, 'Try a piece.' Yeah, I would tell her, 'Try a piece.' 
 
00:13:45 
 
Interviewer: What is the best part of your job? And give an example. 
 
Going home. 
 
Interviewer: What?  
 
Going home. 
 
Interviewer: [laughter.] What?  
 
Going home. 
 
Interviewer: Is the best part of your job? 
 
Yes.  
 
Interviewer: So specify. Give me some--put some meat on the bowl. Give me some 
meat. You're going home.

What is the best part of my job? When the day is done I feel relief, yes, I can go home 
and lie down in my bed and then it just starts again tomorrow, but no, when I'm taking 
care of kids I really get to like the kids, but sometimes some of the parents don't want 
you, sometimes when you bond with a child they think you love the child more than 
them, how could you? You spending most of the day with the child, of course the child 
must bond with you, but some of them don't like that. Like come on, well if you don't 
like that then stay home and mind the child, you know, hello. 
 
00:14:40 
 
Interviewer: So would you say that is one of the best parts of the job? 
 
What? 
 
Interviewer: Loving the child. I mean not going home, but loving the child. 
 
Yes. Getting to know the child, yeah, that's the best part really. And some of the parents 
can be very nice also, like that same Indian lady I'm still friends with them. Yeah, 
recently they called me and we went to the park so she invited me to brunch so--she has 
some big job somewhere. When I told her I was doing the PEN she was so excited. 
 
00:15:13 
 
Interviewer: Give me an example of the worst part of your job. What is the worst part? 
What would you say? 
 
Being not appreciated enough. Like all the things you do, you know sometimes, well, 
you do so much things and the money is never enough. Sometimes you work, when you 
finish your work your body hurts you so much it's like you want to go and take, it's like 
me, I like to go to the spa plenty. So sometimes when I work, I just, like 'Oh my god I 
could go to the spa for three hours and just let somebody massage me,' but sometimes 
you can't because you have to pay rent, you have to put the money aside, you can't 
even get to do something that you want to, can't go to the movies because everything 
[inaudible.] have to put the money down to do this, you know so many things, it's not an 
easy life. 
 
00:16:09 
 
Interviewer: So you consider that like a worst part, not being able to do what you need 
to do? For you. 
 
--What you need to do, yeah. For me. Because you don't just want to work to death. I 
enjoy working, but at the same time I want to be able to enjoy it, not just work work-- 
 
00:16:34 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Interviewer: But let me stop you for a minute. You feel you're not being--and I don't 
want to put words--no I don't want to do that, you feel that you're working to the end of 
yourself and there's no kind of reward, I mean, because you can't go to the spas you just 
said, why, why you feel you can't go to the spas? 
 
Because of the money. Sometimes I don't have the money. But me, I'm a person I enjoy 
the simple things in life, I just make myself happy, I don't sit down and--even if I don't 
have money I'll go to Prospect Park, do things, always doing something or going 
somewhere. I don't like to sit down and just be inside and stuff, I like meeting people 
and enjoy life, smell the roses. 
 
00:17:20 
Interviewer: So you feel like, what, because you're not being paid enough to afford 
these amenities? Is it that you're not being paid enough to enjoy these luxuries that you 
talk about? 
 
And I don't even call that a luxury, just so-- 
 
Interviewer: No the spa, the spa is a luxury.  
 
Well, for some people it may be. 
 
Interviewer: As well as wellness.  
 
Of course, you have to take care of yourself, you can't just work, work. You have to take 
care of your health also. Sometimes you want to take a check up you don't even have 
the money to take a check up, you know, but what was the question? 
 
Interviewer: What is the worst part of the job? 
 
And sometimes not working enough. Sometimes you're in work every day, Monday to 
Friday, so that too, not having enough work to do what you're supposed to do. If you 
work Monday to Friday at least you could enjoy something, but when you do work every 
week or every day in the week at least for three days, it's like come on, you're just in like 
a stagnant like in some quick sand and you're sinking but you don't know what you have 
to do to pull yourself out. 
 
00:18:31 
 
Interviewer: What challenges or sources of tension do you face on the job? What 
challenges are there or tension and I think you talk about it somewhat before in terms 
of--and again I don't want to put words in your mouth but this is your story--you know 
you talk about the children and the bonding of the children and how some of the 
parents of the children don't want you to get that close. Speak to that if you may. You're 
loving on the child and you know it creates a tension, though.

Sometimes they think, you're telling them something, 'Oh no, you don't say that, don't 
tell her that, don't do that,' you know. They always want it their way, you're taking care 
of the child, but it's always about them and I tell them, 'Look, it's either I or you, 
because sometimes they tell the child something and you tell the child something else 
so sometimes the child doesn't know to go left or right, you know? 
 
Interviewer: Do you want to specify? Give an example.  
 
Like sometimes if she said--I may say like pick out her clothes, she might leave it for me 
to pick out her clothes, next thing she'll say, 'Okay no, any time she wants to go to 
school, let her pick out her own clothes,' sometimes she pick out whatever, it doesn't 
even suit the day, like if the weather is cold or whatever, but it's whatever and 
sometimes these kids are too big, they're too mature, like you tell them something and 
they're like, 'No, my mother said that,' 'Uh huh, well your mother is not here right now, 
I'm taking care of you so you have to listen to what I say.' Sometimes it's very 
challenging. 
 
00:20:16 
 
Interviewer: How would you say your relationship with your current employer is? 
 
Good. They like me, I don't know why, but they do.  
 
Interviewer: You don't know why? [laughter.] You think because you're doing the work? 
 
I'm very likable. And my personality also. 
 
Interviewer: Which is? 
 
I'm a people person, because I remember once these people they saw me in Urban 
Center. It was a biracial couple and they call me to come for an interview, so I told her, 
no it had a storm that day and it had a lot of sleet and stuff on the road but I didn't want 
to go, because it was really bad, but I went and stuff, I did the interview and I hate you 
know when you are so excited to get a job so you think it's only you alone going on the 
interview then to hear that, 'Oh, we'll call you.' Like, 'When?' 'Oh, we have to interview 
more people.' 'So why'd you call me if you have to interview more people?' I hate to 
hear that, so then some weeks after she called me and told me do a--some search, put 
my name somewhere with my social security. I said, 'I'm not giving my name to nobody, 
who?' Oh, to do a background check. I said, 'Woman, I never went to prison. My record 
is clean, I never even thieved something, I said, 'Hello, the only person who can do a 
background check is me. Just ask me anything.' The she said--I think she was scared, so 
then I said, 'Calm,' I said, 'Honestly let me tell you, I have no papers here. If you are 
going--give somebody else the job,' and she was insistent, 'No, no,' 'Why?' if I don't have 
any one, I said, 'What numbers I'll put?' She said, 'Just put all zeros,' so I did it and I feel 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

like two days after she said it might take a week but it was like the next day it came and 
she said she wanted me to--but it's not a permanent job, you know, like they call you 
whenever, so one day I asked them, 'What made you pick me from out of all those 
people?' and she just said, 'Your personality and something else,' and it was nice to hear 
that out of so many other babysitters they just choose you. That's a nice feeling, you 
know? Like you stood out. I stood out, you know, she said the way that I spoke and the 
way I interact with him and just the way I spoke to them, because we talked for a long 
time and after it wasn't even about the child it was just about us, just talk about 
everything Trinidad this that, it was just like a conversation like I and you now. 
 
00:22:55 
 
Interviewer: Yes. So those are the people you still have that relationship with? 
 
Yeah, and some weeks last I went away with them to Virginia for two weeks a time. 
Stayed in a big hotel with Jacuzzi, oh my god that is the life, hello, I could get used to 
that. [laughter.] Everyday you're eating at a different restaurant, she was like, 'Hazel, 
you want to go to dinner?' and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, yes.'  I say, 'What do I have to 
do?' and she said, 'You don't have to, but you could come and take care of [inaudible.] I 
said, 'I don't care if I get paid, I said-- I do care, but I would like to go somewhere 
different, you know, so I went. It was really nice. And she showed me the hotel room I 
said, 'This is mine?' I said, 'Jacuzzi, you know this is the kind of thing I like, but damn. 
When I saw her room, I said, 'Sure the rooms--some mix up?' and she said, 'No, that is 
for you.' 
 
00:23:46 
 
Interviewer: So that proves that kind of relationship that you all have, right? 
 
Yeah, they really liked me. 
 
00:23:52 
 
Interviewer: Are there relationships with previous children you have cared for that are 
particularly memorable? In a good or bad kind of way? So is there something that stands 
out in working with the children there's something that happened that creates 
something that you remember whether it's good or bad or indifferent, if you may, that 
stands out? We could always revisit that question. Yeah, you could think about it, 
because there's always something the kids make you feel. Yeah, think about it and we'll 
come back to it, all right? 
 
Hmm. Let's see. [pause.] Yes, revisit that, because oh my gosh I have to think. I'm 
looking for something. Okay, that same little girl the Indian--One time, I don't know, I 
think she had a cold and I was getting sick after and I was coughing, coughing a lot and 
then I went in the bathroom and I started to vomit for--I throw up, throw up, throw up 
so much and then she got so scared, so I said, 'Oh gosh, she loves you,' 'Are you okay?'

00:24:57 
 
Interviewer: How old she was? 
 
She was three. Yeah, she was. 
 
00:25:00 
 
Interviewer: And telling you that she loved you? 
 
Yeah, and oh my god she watching everything that I bring up, you bring up this, look--
look all the mushroom in there, look at the-- [laughter.] and I was like, 'Really? You have 
to be watching all of that,' I said, 'Come on.' She's like, 'Oh Hazel, you're not feeling well, 
come and lie down and let me put something, let me rub you down.' 
 
00:25:17 
 
Interviewer: And she was three? Wow. 
 
Yeah. So sweet. She's five now. She really really loves me, oh my gosh, yeah, so we write 
letters and stuff to each other. She's five now. 
 
00:25:28 
 
Interviewer: Presently? Oh that's nice and you like to write letters. 
 
Yeah, because I love to write so, you know, and she's a budding writer. Her mom is an 
author also, has a Ph.D. She's not a doctor, but she has a Ph.D. Yeah, she has some big 
job in Manhattan. 
 
00:25:42 
 
Interviewer: So any bad with [HL: Experiences really.] any of the kids? Because 
sometimes there's this little--one that pokes at you, you know. 
 
No. Oh, yes. Last year I got a little babysitting job, not--like in the afternoons picking up 
these two kids from school. It was really three sisters, one biological and two adopted. I 
think they were from Mexico, but they looked Caucasian, they look like they were 
Spanish anything. I think they were like sexually, physically, and mentally abused and 
they were very young so two of them-- 
 
00:26:18 
 
Interviewer: How could you tell that? 
 
Well, the parents told me. Well, they didn't really come out and say it, they just say that 
they don't know if I'll last a week. I say, 'Why?' she said, 'You'll see.' They didn't want to 
tell me, I guess, so but I used to go and pick up the biological who is five and the other 
one who is six, one of the adopted ones, because the other one I think she go to 
Roosevelt Island--is that an island? Roosevelt. Yeah, she used to go there so the father 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

and the mother would pick her up sometimes, so this six-year-old who was one of the 
adopted, she used to give some tantrums, sometimes she used to tell those two just 
thing, I'd go to pick her up she is all kind of something, I just used to ignore her really, 
because sometimes you know you bicker with children and then they say all kind of stuff 
so I never used to pay her no mind, but one time we were in the park and the--I used to 
always tell her don't interrupt with the bigger kids because they're too grown you know 
and you're so small, she's only six but she used to tell the kids she's twelve or ten. And 
one day when the parents tell me, because if the child go left, I go left, if they go right, I 
go right, so one day the mother tell me she said, 'Hey, you can just sit down, you don't 
have to follow them, it's a big park and it only has one exit so you can just watch them, 
you could read your book,' I said, 'Are you feeling well, really?' First I had a parent tell 
me that, really, you know. So but I still used to be like, because I don't want anything to 
happen to them on my watch so every like so often I'll watch her, not really the other 
one because the other one she is good, but this one. Next thing I see, one child slap her. 
Now I get scared, because 'What?' So I went to ask the child what happened she said--I 
think she cursed at her [inaudible.] And then I asked her--well, right away I call the 
parents because I don't want them to feel that because, you know, and it was a big thing 
because the kids and the mother came and she asked me what to do, I said, 'Well, talk 
to the child, let the child call their parent or something.' 
 
00:28:29 
 
Interviewer: So wait, your little girl slapped somebody? Somebody else slapped her? 
 
No. A bigger girl maybe twelve years slapped her. But the girl who slapped her said her 
parent told her that anybody that's being disrespectful to her she should hit them. I 
said, 'I don't think your mother told you that.' And for twelve years she was you know, 
but the little six year old was really being disrespectful and I said it doesn't matter that 
somebody's doing that, you shouldn't hit somebody because anybody could say 
anything, you don't have to you know hit somebody to prove  a point, you know. You 
could have come and talked to me or asked to see her mom or something like that and 
they are supposed to deal with it. So I called her mom and then all the kids were 
gathered around and she spoke to the little girl and then they punished her for a long 
time, but and then one times I was-- I went and picked them up from school and I 
brought them home, I think it was raining or something, but they never used to like to 
leave the two girls with me that had the autistic--not autistic--they had ADHD and all 
kinds of different problems so they never used to--they didn't think I could handle it--
but one day she wanted a smoothie, so I said no smoothie, because I wasn't taking 
down the blender to do this and they were getting their dinner I was preparing their 
dinner so I said no smoothie because if you get a smoothie you won't want to eat your 
dinner. Whatever. And this girl pull out one long knife for me. Yeah, that really 
happened and I was like, 'No, you're not supposed to do that,' and she jumped, she said, 
'Come on, I'll kill you,' and I said, 'Girl, I'll call the police. Kill me? Not on my watch 
nobody is hurting me, uh uh.' And she had the knife and, 'Don't come near me,' and 
when I said police she started to tremble. Yeah.

00:30:19 
 
Interviewer: She was troubled. 
 
Yeah, but I think they--I don't know whatever but the father told me they had a hard life 
and they were only six and eight. So you know, and their mom had a lot of children that 
I think the government doesn't even know where half of the kids are. So. 
 
00:30:36 
 
Interviewer: I see. And they were adopted? 
 
Yeah, and they are sisters so it's a good thing that they are sisters but they give them a 
really good life, yeah. Sometimes the mother and father used to come to me, 'Hazel, you 
think we're doing a good job?' I say, 'Yes. Because they're giving what parents can give, 
is love. You have to show them love. And you're all doing a lot. When they come home 
from school you have them with their homework you do everything and you're showing 
them that you love them and you care about them, you know? And I see it every day, I 
don't have to be in the household to see it, I see it all the time in the park, in the school, 
you know they help them with their homework. You know you can see they're really 
invested in these kids and they don't treat their daughter different from--they treat all 
three of them like [Interviewer: The same.] That's all they can do is love them and show 
them they care. That's all they can do. I say, 'After a while, I'm sure they'll grow to that.' 
 
00:31:30 
 
Interviewer: If they come troubled and they get love and care it might change the mind 
so it would help if they--eventually it would help.  
 
Yeah, time and love and care. 
 
Just time and love and care. It will happen. She used to come and asked me that, I said 
'You all are on the right road.' 
 
00:31:54 
 
Interviewer: Do you feel the amount of hours you work and your holiday schedules are 
being respected?  
 
Well, I don't no have holidays [laughter.] If I take off for the day my holiday? I mean, if 
I'm working another job on Christmas and other days, those are days that I'm not 
working for anybody unless the money is good I'm single and by myself, I work if--okay if 
somebody is calling me to work on a holiday then it's up to me if I want to go, but 
sometimes it depends on who it is. 
 
00:32:25 
 
Interviewer: Because your job is what, part time? 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
13
Uh huh. But not because they say part time, that doesn't mean you'll call me any hour to 
say, 'Hazel, get ready come.' Calling me ten minutes to 2 to tell me they're reaching 
Manhattan for 2:00, hello? Check me Monday or something, no, not because sometimes 
you have to let them respect you also and I just do that. Sometimes I want the money 
but I have to get up and change clothes and take the train, uh uh, I'm busy. I could do it 
for you tomorrow, but you know. Yeah. 
 
00:32:59 
 
Interviewer: So would you say that you or any worker that you know has been exploited 
due to immigration status? Has that been used against you or somebody you might have 
known? 
 
I know a lot of people they use that against them, but why tell them that your 
immigration-- unless they ask. Sometimes if they ask my papers pending. You know 
what, let them go and check up on it. But I heard a lot of people spoke about that 
before, but I hardly have people who ask me like over the years nobody ever used to ask 
me only like one or two like this, I say it's pending. And they want your passport 
pictures, I say, 'No, I don't give my passport picture to people. I don't know what you're 
going to do with that. Excuse me, no.' 
 
Interviewer: Your passport is yours to hold, right? 
 
Yeah. They want this and they want that. I say, 'Well you give me something of yours 
too.' 
 
00:34:00 
 
Interviewer: Do you ever share cultural things from your heritage with the family you 
assist? For example: food, language, folktales or beliefs about life and death? Anything 
cultural that you bring to that home or whoever you work for? Any sayings, any 
particular cultural nuance that you have that, you know? 
 
Yes, like sometimes I'll tell them our tradition like how we spend Christmas and stuff, 
food of course. My brain is not functioning now to say those things. I can't remember 
right now. 
 
00:34:41 
 
Interviewer: Well we could always revisit that too. Do you currently have any kids of 
your own or family or individual responsibilities that you are taking care of? Is there 
anybody? 
 
Only myself. I, myself, and Irene. 
 
00:35:03 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Interviewer: How do you manage balancing your personal life and your work life? Yeah, 
because you have a work life and you have your personal life-- 
 
Yeah, when I'm at work, I'm at work but when I'm off work I do the things that I love to 
do. 
 
Interviewer: Which are? 
 
Well, I like to be outside. I like nature, I love to walk. I can't walk too much now with my 
foot, I sprained it, but I love to read--always in the library. A lot of people think I work 
there, because I'm always there and I love to write, also, I've started going some writing 
classes. Growing up I always wanted to be an author, but I never pursued it but now I'm 
trying to. I don't know, just enjoy the little things in life. Go to the park, go to the 
movies, just you know talk to people. I love people. They might not love me, but I love 
people. 
 
00:35:59 
 
Interviewer: So you think your work allows you to do that? 
 
Yes, I've always been like that so work won't stop me from being me. Other people say, 
'You just do a lot of things, you have time to read, time to go to the movies, time to--' I 
say, 'Excuse me, what do you mean?' So I must just work work and do nothing with my 
life? You know you have to have an outlet, you can't just work work work. And 
sometimes we work for these people and they don't appreciate it or something--they 
might not appreciate it but you work so much and then you don't have time for yourself 
or do anything. You work from Monday to Friday, Sunday you just shop you clean your 
house you think Monday you're going back to work and you didn't do nothing for 
yourself, not for me. 
 
Interviewer: Not a life, right, not a life. 
 
Because I always know a good life in Trinidad so even my life here is very different from 
my life, but still I like to enjoy my life you know? I might not have a million dollars, but I 
still act like if I have a million dollars, hello. 
 
00:36:56 
 
Interviewer: Good for you, good for you, hello, you should do, because the rigors of the 
job demand that you take care of yourself, I would think, right? 
 
You should. You have to, yeah. Because on East 18 I used to live with my ex and have 
this guy, he owns a deli, he's Arabic, he'd call me Haja, he'd say, 'Haja, when I knew you 
you were like this,' size-wise, and he says, 'Since I met you all those years ago you 
always the same, I never see you one day frown, you're always smiling always talking to 
people sometime you don't know these people but you always have something nice to 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
15
say. Sometimes you'll come, you'll buy something for somebody you don't even know 
the people, I never hear you say damn, you're just so different from these people.' I say, 
'Well, that's just me.' And that is a compliment, you know? That made me feel so nice. 
 
00:37:55 
 
Interviewer: Are you a member of other groups? Domestic Workers United. Well you 
talk about the library, you do work at the library, I think? 
 
What? Besides what? Oh. Well, not really. Well, I joined--Well, I don't work there, 
people just think I work there, but I recently joined--well, I think I joined the New York 
Coalition Writers, I think I did join that, yes, because as I said, I love to write so anything 
that is free that I can write, yes, any story, poetry, anything, I'm there. So I'm in the one 
the one at Grand Army Plaza and I'm in one kind of in Lindon, but the one in Grand Army 
they have that every Monday from 3-5, but the one in Lindon is just I went to one class, 
but hopefully I'll go to the next classes in May. And the— 
 
Interviewer: PEN American World Voices. 
 
Yes, I'm in that too. 
 
Interviewer: Okay, oh wow. 
 
That is the best one, yeah, you feel so at home there.  
 
Chris Mule:  Can you explain that a little because I don't know--I'm curious. 
 
00:39:03 
Interviewer: Yeah, What's the PEN American World Voices? Literature. But what do you 
do there? Tell us what you do. What it entails. What you do when you belong to that 
group, yes.  
 
I don't even know. I don't even know what P-E-N stands for. Poetry and writing, like to 
create stories from your head. The teacher, he might just give a prompt and say [pause.] 
Oh one time he told us to write something that we remember from our childhood that 
we love. Something either inside the house or outside the house and I wrote about a 
swing, because back home one time we used to live at this--it's called Carenage, it's near 
the sea and we had like our own private beach. Upstairs and downstairs four 
apartments, it was so beautiful, but in the yard it had this too big almond tree--I think 
that's why I'm so addicted to almond nuts right now. The real fruit and they tied a swing 
and a seesaw and an old boat, but I used to go on that swing like every day and just 
swing and when you swing there's a little wall and the beach and the sea and I used to 
see the beautiful sunsets so I wrote about that. 
 
00:40:26 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Interviewer: I also think--I want to believe it's workers-writers too, because the idea is 
for what? To be able to tell our story, right? 
 
Tell our story, yes, tell your story. Whatever you think your story is, you have to tell it in 
your true voice. 
 
00:40:43 
 
Interviewer: Yeah. From where you work too, I mean as a domestic worker, to be able to 
tell our story.  
 
Yeah, I like that class.  
 
Interviewer: I'm not sure what the 'PEN' means, but I know that it's worker-writers.  
 
I must ask, I don't know. 
 
Interviewer: I think you're writing with what, the Taxi Alliance, Picture the Homeless-- 
Picture the Homeless. 
 
Interviewer: Street Vendors. 
 
Street Vendors, yes.  
 
Chris Mule: So it’s all people in that class that are writing [inaudible.] That's interesting. 
Yeah. A lot of people sometimes and sometimes you meet interesting people. 
 
00:41:17 
 
Interviewer: But clearly it's worker-writers. Grassroot writers, from the ground up sort-
of-speak, yeah? 
 
Worker-writers, yeah. 
 
00:41:28 
 
Interviewer: I know that you say you don't have a family, it's you, yourself, and Irene, 
and Irene is you [laughter.] 
 
Well, I live by myself, but I have family here. 
 
00:41:37 
 
Interviewer: Let me re-visit this question. How does being a domestic worker impact 
your own family life? Are you able to see your family because of the job that you do? 
You know these jobs are so grueling. 
Like in what way? Yeah, well, I think if just being in this country too is not the same as 
back home. Sometimes back home you live far from somebody but you'll see them like 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
17
weekly, but here you'll live like in the same apartment the same street--two streets 
from each other here and you wouldn't see the people in months or a whole year will go 
by you won't even see them, but it's very difficult because everyone has different work 
schedules, and I'm not a good phone person, but I try to see my family as often as I can 
because we live so close. One of my brothers lives in Atlanta, but my sister we are close. 
She's a nanny also, but the people she works for people cannot call her a nanny because 
the woman, her employer, gets very offended. 
 
00:42:56 
 
Interviewer: What should they call her? 
 
She's part of the family, she's not--yeah, but I call them like Uncle Patrick and Auntie 
Jema. 
 
Interviewer: Okay, interesting. 
 
Yeah--Laura, I mean, sorry, the child is Jema, she has a Caribbean name, Jema, but they 
are very nice. They are very nice, yeah. I met them the first time I came. They are really 
really nice people.  
 
Chris Mule: So they don't let her call herself a nanny? 
 
No, well, people cannot--if she introduced and some people say, 'This is my nanny,' or 
'This is my babysitter,' they're like, 'Excuse me,' and they'll call them out now, 'No this is 
Carlita, she's part of the family, she's not no babysitter or nanny,' yeah, uh uh, they 
don't accept those things, they are just so down to earth. Yeah, really nice, and if my 
sister is having a party on the beach, anything, they're always there shaking what their 
mama gave to them. They're really really so cool so really--you hardly meet people. 
Since I came to this country it's tough, you rarely meet nice people to work for. Some of 
these people, uh uh. It have some--they are few and far between. Not all of them are 
very nice to work for, but I really have some nice nice families. 
 
00:44:15 
 
Interviewer: So could I say something culturally to what was just said? You know where 
we came from we call everyone Mr. and Mrs. and Auntie and Uncle, yeah? So it was 
hard to work in the house and kind of get close to them and call them by their name, 
like if their name is John, say 'John' or if your kids visit, it was hard for my daughter to 
say, well, 'Meet Annie,' it was kind of like wanting to say, 'Auntie Annie,' because 
everybody where we come from was an Auntie, but respectfully it was Auntie, Uncle so-
and-so, so yeah, so as you say what you say about your sister, she was considered part 
of the family, people were offended when they say when she called nanny. 
 
Yeah, 'This isn't my nanny, this is my-- 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
00:44:57 
Interviewer: Culture seeps into that. 
 
Even that--the last child I used to work for, the mom told her not to call me Hazel, 'Call 
her Auntie Hazel,' yeah. 'She didn't have to,' I said that, she said, 'No, that's a form of 
respect,' I said, 'I know, I saw--' and she used to say it sometimes she used to say, 
'Hazel,' she'd forget, I'd say, 'Excuse me, Hazel?' 
 
00:45:24 
 
Interviewer: Interesting. So when you're doing domestic work, do you feel supported or 
have you felt like you're working in an isolated environment? Have you--do you feel 
supported? Yeah, wherever that is? What is your feeling? Do you feel isolated or do you 
feel supported? Do you feel like you have support from I guess the Domestic Workers 
United or when you're working in those homes do you feel alone because it's one-on-
one? We all know that-- 
 
Domestic work? In the house itself? With the people? Well it's one-on-one, but now we 
have the Domestic Workers United so you're not alone. When you're in the house 
you're alone but with the group everybody more or less doing kind of the same kind of 
work or at least have the same kind of experience that you're going through and 
everyone has a different story to tell so you could learn something from it. 
 
00:46:22 
 
Interviewer: So you feel supported then? 
 
Yeah, because it's always good to listen to people's story and then the other things 
they're going through, and sometimes some people are going through some horrible 
stuff and you know. And I appreciate it because I know this girl, she works in a 
restaurant in Flatbush. I never know she said she had a good job, but I guess she really 
didn't know how much the money was and she fell down in the basement recently when 
she went down to get some stuff she went to bring up--normally that's not her job--and 
she went down there and she was down there for a good while calling but there were 
playing they music so hard they didn't know that she fell and so I told her she should 
have called an ambulance, why did you get up? And she got in so much pain but I called 
her recently and when she came to tell me she was only working for $5.05. I said, 'Girl, I 
don't care how desperate I am, I'm not working for that because it's not worth it. From 
all hours in the night, sometimes she came home 12, 1:00, 2:00. And the owner of the 
restaurant, he has a kind of, I don't know what it is but the workers are afraid to talk 
against him or something and say what he's doing so I told her, well she should come 
and join or hear what DWU has to say, yeah. No matter how desperate I am-- and I will 
put my foot down, because no one is taking advantage of me. 
 
00:47:55 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
19
Interviewer: So in other words, then, you feel like you have a community of people you 
can come and share with, right?  
 
Yeah, and if something is going wrong you can always talk to somebody and tell them, 
well, I don't think this is right, or get some advice or something, because I wouldn't 
know everything, but you know you can always talk to somebody and hear what they 
have to say. I might think something and you might have something better to offer--you 
know, some word of advice, always dumb, you know. 
 
Chris Mule: [inaudible.] Can I--I'm sorry, but the story you just told was fascinating. 
What do you guys think? Why would someone stay in that position, like that girl? Why? 
 
Well, she was cleaning somewhere before with a girl I know--well, okay, I met her 
cleaning that house I was cleaning on a Friday, well I don't know why she is not there 
anymore, but I know I'm there now, but actually the girl has this company and she is 
Trinidadian it's sad to see, but she don't pay her workers, because--okay, these two girls 
working this house cleaning business.  
 
The Trinidadian, she owns the business and apparently she has a lot of jobs, she has a 
lot of business places, gyms and all kinds of things, so one day I--well, when I went to 
take care of the boy I said, I’m cleaning and they're talking so I ask the girl, I say, 'This is 
a business you all have, you're all working for a company?' Because I'm trying to get 
more jobs and she said, 'Yeah, this girl owns the business,' so I said, 'You can hook my 
up,' gave her my number, whatever, so I talked to her and said any time you're looking 
for a cleaner, I'm very good, hello, I learned from my mother. So one day some weeks 
later she called me and we went to clean some businesses in Manhattan. Now, okay, 
you're going on work. If it's five hours she's paying you $50. And we're going three big 
business places. Some of them had three or four floors--went into the big business with 
print factory graphic design place, fabric stores, so I was like wait, $50? You know what I 
could have--I was like, okay, I went that day, I think I went twice or three times and I 
told her, 'Look. I'm just being honest. Yes, I love to work, I love to make my own money, 
but me? If I have a business, I have to treat my workers fairly.  
 
Now, all of us the first business we went in all of us worked and after 8 you have this girl 
going by herself to work some other job to come home at like 3:00 in the morning to 
come home by herself, so why all of us don't go, do the job, and then all of us go home 
together?' I say, 'Now what you need to invest in for your workers? First of all, you don't 
pay enough. I'm not telling you this to get mad, but let me tell you, I grew up with a 
mother who was a good business woman, you need to get a vehicle so you can drop 
your workers here and there whether it's day, morning, or night.' Because in the first 
place they're not working for enough to even metro card, $10 an hour, if you work five 
hours from five different places you do so much--but I say I can't work for that, yes I 
need work but I don't want nobody to make me a fool. When I finish one job I'm so tired 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
20
I said no and I heard she was upset about that because I told her that, 'No you have to 
treat your workers properly.' And I tell her uh-uh. 
 
00:51:21 
 
Interviewer: But to revisit the question that Christopher asked, what makes people stay 
in those jobs? Like the girl who went down to the basement? Or even some of us who 
get ill treatment. What makes us stay? 
 
Well, because I think the recently got an apartment and the husband alone was working, 
he was living in another state with the kids and he came and then the daughter going 
into college so you know sometimes it's not that we want to work for that money, but 
sometimes to make ends meet we have no choice, you know you have to pay the bills 
living in America. You want to pay the bills so you just have to take what you get at the 
time, because in Trinidad I never--I worked hard in Trinidad, but I never worked so hard 
in my life, you know, and I work hard at home, and home you can enjoy and see the 
rewards, because you don't even have to work so hard you have your parents, you have 
all sort of family--the way of life is just different at home and a lot of people think that 
because you come to America like you don't have a life where you came from like it was 
suffering and you know, but when you look at it sometime our life is way better than a 
lot of the folks in America whether they're rich or not. Yes. 
 
00:52:41 
 
Interviewer: Well and to also answer that part of the question the college too. The 
mother who has to send it home that $5 send--if the husband is working to send the 
daughter to college. College is more than house and land and working for that measly 
$5 falling down that basement. 
 
And like you fall down and that money you work for it can't help you and she didn't go 
to the doctor so I said, 'What did you pay with your life?' I said go to get a doctor's 
report and do what you have to do, I sort of--Oh you thank the people, thank the 
people, I say [inaudible.] is your health, your health comes first because if you don't 
have health you can't do a job so you go and take my advice and do that because yes 
you could fall down some steps, you might feel no pain and the physical but you don't 
know what will happen tomorrow or a month from now what could happen. Blood clot, 
any kind of thing. People play with their health too much, yeah. 
 
00:53:36 
 
Interviewer: So when and why did you become a part of DWU and how did you hear 
about it? What made you want to be a part of it? How did you hear about it? 
 
One day I went, I was invited to breakfast at the Brooklyn Public Library and then that 
branch they love me there, I don't know why [laughter.] I don't even know what the 
breakfast was for. I remember I was going home one day and this, Miss Josephine she 
told me, 'Hazel, Mrs.--' she always called me Miss Hazel, I feel so old--anyway, 'You 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
21
could come to our breakfast,' but I was so busy talking to somebody I didn't even ask 
what the breakfast was about so I just went on that and the next morning rain was 
pronouncing, 'I'm not going for no breakfast, no, look at the rainy day,' but then I say, 
'Look, go for breakfast because you never know,' because I had to make breakfast and 
oh my god I was so glad I went, but when I went everybody was dressed up, I was like, 
'Oh my god, you didn't tell me it was this fancy thing,' but I was looking decent but I 
didn't know these--the photographer like paparazzi and I was like, 'Oh my god, I hope 
nobody does get me.' Yeah, and then I didn't even know what it was for really and then I 
met a lot of ladies and then I don't know what I was saying, somebody was telling me 
about the DWU and I was like, 'What is that? I don't even--I never even heard about 
that, what is that?' Domestic Workers United. I didn't know about it but I was like, you 
know what? I always want to learn something. I'm a person who always likes to find out 
things and know things, and I was like why not go to a meeting, so that's how it started. 
And then I think I was talking about writing or something that's when the person must 
have heard that and asked me. 
 
00:55:26 
 
Interviewer: --you and your work that the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights was pass in 
2010? What it meant for you, but what it meant for you do, but in your own way what 
do you think it means for you that now there's a domestic workers Bill of Rights? Even if 
you don't know, even that you don't know that there's a passage of a Bill of Rights, but 
knowing now that you came to DWU and you know that is something to do with rights 
in some and fashion, so kind of self-explanatory, what does it mean for you? Even 
though as you say it's not implemented. What do you think it should mean for you and 
others too? 
 
Well, I don't really know much about the Bill--I never even heard about it until I came to 
that meeting, the Bill of Rights. It's like what? The who of what? [laughter.] It's the $15 
an hour but everyone doesn't even get that, but I don't think it's really implemented. It's 
passed, but a lot of people don't even get whatever that $15. What was the question? I 
forget. So that we can get our--what we are worth, you know? And the employers are 
supposed to respect us and give us what we're due and they should do the right thing, 
you know? 
 
00:56:52 
 
Interviewer: And what does that right thing do? 
 
Well, when we work pay us what we're due and pay us what we're--you know 
sometimes you do so much and you get so little, like give me what I'm supposed to get, 
give me my due, I don't like to--I'm mortal and I don't like to work and get a little bit of 
money when they day's finished, not that because I know I did a lot and I did the best 
darn job I could do when I'm at a job I do the best I can do, you know? And I know I put 
my heart and soul out there, so I think when I'm finished I should say, 'Yes, this is worth 
it,' you know? Or some days it's like--I guess I didn't come, [laughter.] truly.

Interviewer: What would you like to see happen in the future with the Bill of Rights? 
Really? And considering that you just said it's really not implemented, what would you 
like to see?  
 
Well I hope it will be implemented and that all the employers could pay whether it's a 
childcare, housekeeper, baby sitter, nanny, I don't care whatever. Everybody could get 
what they're supposed to and more. Because it's not right to be doing all this and you're 
just not getting your worth. 
 
00:58:15 
 
Interviewer: So from your perspective, why is Domestic Workers United important for 
domestic workers? 
 
So that we can help out one another and we can tell each other our stories and if we are 
being treated unfairly, then they can do something or try to do something or we can 
each--we can help each other in some sort of way, you know? 
 
00:58:43 
 
Interviewer: So if you were to speak to a legislator, right, people who make these bills 
who are able to help these bills pass, what would you want him to know, what would 
you say to him if you were go to Albany and talk to that legislator in Albany, what would 
you say to him? 
 
Look man, let me tell you something, no. We make up this country. If we didn't do this 
job, these people wouldn't do it. Immigrants make up well the domestic workers. I think 
immigrants run America with all this work, because these people don't do it, they hire 
their babysitter, nanny, housekeeper, come and see about my parents, and if you didn't 
do it who would? They're not staying home and minding the children or you know, I 
mean everybody has to do what they have to do, but you have to pay the people what 
they're due. 
 
Interviewer: So that's what you'd tell them? 
 
Yeah. Once I start I might not be able to hush. 
 
00:59:44 
 
Interviewer: Are you happy with the Bill's impact? The Bill of Rights? As we say, again, 
considering that you say it's not really implemented, are you happy with-- 
 
No. Well, that they get it passed yes, but I think it should be more enforced so--because 
I don't think a lot of people really know about it. Because I tried to tell people, but I 
don't really know too much so sometimes when they ask me I'm like, 'Look, you'd better 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
23
join DWU to hear more about this thing because I cannot explain it, but you will need to 
come to the meeting and hear about it.' And sometimes when you tell people about the 
meeting they say--you know they're so negative, they've never been to it so, you know, I 
came so why don't you just? But a lot of people are very close-minded. They want 
change, but they're not doing anything about it, they're just like 'Uh.'  
 
Sometimes it only takes one and then when you're voting it takes one vote to change 
things, but a lot of people don't, they only talk among themselves, 'Oh you know, this 
woman isn't treating me right, or this man or go to your thing--' but if you don't say 
anything and speak up nothing will change. Like sometimes when the price of tomatoes 
maybe 99 cents for one so people stop buying it and it drops down. Hello, you have to 
do something. Say something. 
 
01:01:03 
 
Interviewer: What area of education/skills are you looking to gain? You just said it, you 
said it before. If you're striving to advance something what would that be? And you just 
said it and again I don't want to put words in your mouth, you just said author. 
 
Area of education/skills? Well, I just--Anything? My passion was always to be an author. 
Growing up I always liked to write, which I do. I maybe write a million people all over 
the world. I live in the post office. The only thing I don't have is a bed. 
 
Interviewer: What makes you live in the post office? Why? 
 
Always posting letters to somebody. I always at the post office so the post people they 
know me by name. You know when in line they will say 'Next'? They say, 'Hazel, your 
turn.' Everybody [inaudible.] [laughter.] 
 
01:01:53 
 
Interviewer: But why though? Why? What do you have around the world that? People 
still do that though? 
 
Oh, pen pals, I love-- Well I don't know about people, I know about me. I started when I 
was twelve and I never stopped. I love people genuinely, I just love people, I don't know 
why. I think it's a gift, though. A lot of people don't--everybody on the Internet now then 
the game, nobody--look, writing is becoming extinct like the dinosaurs, and I never even 
saw one. Yeah, writing is important. Everybody [inaudible.] only get bill, bill, bill. People 
don't even--everybody texting, they're not even taking up their phone and calling you, 
only texting you. No, but I love to write. It's important. 
 
01:02:39 
 
Interviewer: Interesting. But what other skill if you had to-- 
 
I want to be an author, really, since I was small I always wanted to be an author. Truly, 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
24
but I never pursued it at home. I never really--I mean I used to study it, but sometimes 
you don't hear people talking about being an author, but I always loved to read and I 
read a lot, but I think this is my time now to shine. I mean I shine every day, hello, but I 
mean I should have written. I love to be-- 
 
01:03:16 
 
Interviewer: So what skill if any did DWU teach you and what type of training? When 
you came to DWU what skill you think? I know you're a newer member so it's kind of 
hard to pinpoint but what when you came around DWU did you think that they give to 
you? 
 
Well, I don't know, I like to hear the way the women speak. They're so passionate about 
the DWU, only sometimes when they're talking I don't know really what they're saying 
because I now join so some of the things I really don't know what they're speaking 
about, but I always study, 'Oh, that could be me one day speaking like that.' 
 
01:04:00 
 
Interviewer: So, what, orator? Being an orator? 
 
Author, an orator, or any kind of 'ator' and I like to talk, so. 
 
01:04:10 
Interviewer: So how is cultural expression used as a tool for advocacy and outreach of 
Domestic Workers United, such as music dance, poetry, or proverbs? And that's 
important. 
 
Well, how it's used? Well, I joined in Domestic Workers United I get to go to--well, to 
PEN, the writing class, I get to go to plays and all different kinds of functions, meet 
people I never knew. Look, I didn't know what DWU was for and then I go--I didn't even 
know what the Taxi Alliance, Homeless Shelter, this--and then you meet people like, 
'What?' I didn't even know about all these things, but you don't know about something 
until you're in something, and then you know about something and you hear about 
something, and it's like, 'I lived in America so long, I didn't even know all of these things 
going on.' I love to write so much, I didn't even know for so many years they have this 
program in Grand Army Plaza, it's like, 'And where was I?' but everything happens in it's 
own time and it was my time then, I guess. 
 
01:05:18 
Interviewer: So then DWU--the cultural expression is like a bridge? A form of activism--a 
bridge, right? 
 
Yes and I love it, because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be doing the writing and plus 
going to the theater and I might even act this year if [inaudible.] hello. [laughter.] You 
never know where you could reach, because sometimes you never know who could 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
25
hear you say something and like that or see you act somewhere and then you know. I 
used to do a lot of acting when I was going back into--when I was in school I was very 
shy, but I used to be in everything, any acting and stuff, but I like it. DWU it broadened 
my horizons also, because I love a plays and stuff like that and now to go on Broadway is 
so much money I know to get a Broadway ticket and to go to a play for free and sit 
down and watch people do their thing. That is awesome, I like that. 
 
01:06:18 
Chris Mule: Can I just ask--what do you write about? Can you just tell what you write 
about? Do you write about being a domestic worker or is it writing about anything? 
 
No, I just write well. I'm so confident in some things, but I think always wanting to be an 
author sometimes I doubt myself if I'm writing, especially--and I really never write about 
the domestic workers, because sometimes when you're in a writing class they give a 
prompt and you have to write to the prompt only in Grand Army Plaza you don't have 
to, but I just write what comes into my head. Sometimes I'll go to the class and people 
are there writing and I'm like, 'What are people writing about?' I was still on ten minutes 
and nothing coming into my head, and just so the pen will just start to move, but I've 
heard that I have a good eye a good arm. They like how I describe stuff, because one 
lady--I went to the class last week and this lady she came out of this office and she 
asked me, 'Do you want to go in there?' and I said, 'No, I'm waiting for this door to 
open.' She said, 'What class is that?' I said, 'Writing class.' And she wanted to tell her 
mom and stuff we just started to talk and stuff and then she said, 'Do you know the first 
thing that you wrote?' So I said, 'Yes,' she said, 'Can you read it to me?' It's like, 'But I 
don't even know this lady, why does she want?' She said, 'Don't feel shy, just read it.' 
And I read it to her and she said, 'You know what? Just hearing you read that I could just 
visualize it and I could just make a movie out of that, because everything you talk about 
you could just picture it. You were talking and I just put myself in that story.' And that 
made me feel so good, because sometimes I don't have confidence in my writing. Not 
that I'm not confident, but I don't know if it's how I always wanted to be an author and 
now that I'm getting to go to the--I don't know-- 
 
01:08:16 
 
Interviewer: So could I say and to answer Christopher's question, through the PEN 
American World Voices the slant is more on worker-writers, is that what they do? 
Worker-writer. The poems that you're doing now, the rengas, are they not based on the 
work? It's a style of poetry, right? That speaks to your job. Speak a little more on that. 
 
What? Oh yes, sorry, I didn't think about the renga. I forgot. Poetry, yes, I love that. Our 
professor he tells us to do this renga. Renga is a form of Japanese stanza poem. You 
alone don't do it. I might do three lines, the person after me will do the two, and the 
person after will do three, three, two, three, three. Could be a hundred--some of the 
rengas are a thousand lines, but we wouldn't do a thousand. So he just said write 
whatever and one of the poems we did, well, some of the pieces I wrote like when I 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
26
work, things I feel, how I'm feeling so that's what I wrote and that's what I'll be saying 
on Saturday for PEN World Voices. I'm getting to say two of my pieces. 
 
01:09:57 
 
Interviewer: So before we go, do you have any words or parting shots you'd like to 
share? Anything you would like to put out there concerning DWU and the work you do? 
Anything you'd like the listening people who are going to listen to this to know? And 
they should know. There should be something that you should be able to say. 
 
We just all have to come together as one and stop-- They have a lot of workers out here 
like domestic and baby sitters, but sometimes even as babysitters, like sometimes you'll 
go in parks, different places, and if you're a nanny you'll feel like a sudden--like you're 
an outcast. They watch you funny like they have their own congregation and you are the 
outcast and you feel a certain way. I don't know if that ever happened to you but it 
happened to a lot of people, but I think it should have even a nanny--you know besides 
like domestic workers it should have--well, it's like this, like a nanny something where 
everybody could--well it is this--come together, help each other. 
 
01:11:18 
 
Interviewer: But wouldn't you say that's what DWU is about, though? 
 
Yes, well, that's what I mean, it is this, but like the nanny could come together and join 
DWU and find out what everything is about and what your rights are and everything so 
they could have a better understanding. 
 
01:11:38 
 
Interviewer: Thank you, thank you, yes.  
 
Chris Mule: That was great. 
 
I never knew I could speak--oh my gosh. Thank you. I never knew I could speak like this 
[Laughter.] and it's like oh my god the questions--
