raised end of the chute and secured with a heavy chain. Then the 
box 
is slowly tipped up by machinery so that the berries pour 
gradually onto the conveyor belt, which has a rough texture that 
catches the small wet leaves and bits of grass mixed in with 
them. The berries drop into the hopper shown 
in frame 16, while 
the conveyor belt continues up a second slope and turns under the 
belt, at right angles to and below the first (frames 17 and 18), 
catches the berries as they drop from the hopper and carries them 
into the next room, where they pour through a chute (19) into a

7-9: Front steps and door of church, showing inscription 
scratched in concrete with a stick or something (these photos 
would have to be judiciously cut). Inscription reads: "For 
Whoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved," 
Rom. 10:13. (This church places a lot of emphasis on standing on 
the Word, metaphorically as well 
as -- here -- literally.) 
TX02: 10-12: Yardscapes G—Brown's Mills; 21GT across the road from 
the Landmark Baptist Church church, showing the juxtaposition of 
a new and fairly expensive—looking house surrounded and hidden by 
trees (with a red fescue grass lawn, nicely rolled and mowed, 
making the natural vegetation seem more genteel) and an older, 
smaller home surrounded by flowerbeds and assorted household 
repair projects. This is about 2 miles off Lakehurst Road, the 
main drag coming northwest into Brown's Mills, and about 4 miles 
from the center of town.

living room fireplace, built by Mr. Kenneth 
Yates and his sons out of old brick from a Philadelphia house. 
Fried flower arrangement by Mrs. Dorothy Yates on hearth; black 
hearthrug showing American eagle design popular in the area. 
3: Long shot of 
living room. 
4-7: Dried-apple face dolls made by a local dollmaker. Portrayed 
here are Indian Ann (center), the last Lenni Lenape Indian to 
live 
in the Pines, who 
is buried 
in Tabernacle Cemetery, with the 
baskets she used to make and sell door to door; an old woman 
churning butter; and a farmer wearing the old-fashioned tin 
bucket strapped around the waist for picking blueberries, 
in use 
about twenty years ago and still employed by some pickers today. 
8-9: Mr. Kenneth Yates points out a detail 
of construction he 
built in the doorframe leading from hallway to living room: the 
framework is built solidly into the wall 
itself, extending its 
support of the upper boards between the ceiling and the top of 
the doorway from one supporting stud on one side to another on 
the other side. Contractors sometimes make less durable 
doorframes; he generally outdoes the building code on matters of 
strength and solidity when he builds a house. 
10-11: Buck shot by Kenneth Yates, stuffed by a local taxidermist 
and mounted in his front hallway. His deer gun rests on the 
hooves of the deer below the head. 
12-20: Kenneth and Dorothy Yates chatting with Christine 
Cartwright at their dining room table, where the paperwork for 
their hardware business is done. A portrait of the family when 
their grown children were young, a painted enlargement of a black 
and white snapshot, 
is framed on the wall behind them.
