Speaking To Teachers
  
11 
Most of the teachers  I know have much too much to do and
 
many too many issues to address.  Their basic response to new
 
material nearly always concerns:  why should this be added to
 
an already over-crowded curriculum;  how will  it enhance or
 
stimulate the act of learning;  and where will it  integrate
 
with other required topics? The  following essay will attempt
 
to address all these  issues but,  since they are closely
 
intertwined,  the pathway may at times  seem indirect.  However,
 
With One Step.  a Journey Begins.   
And throughout all that  follows,  the underlying hope is
 
to make "Musics of Hawai'i:  It All Comes  from the Heart"
 
this remarkable collection of diverse sounds,  impeccable
 
research and deeply moving performances -
-
 come alive  in the
 
infinitely varied classrooms of Hawai' i.
 
At  first glance,  this may seem a formidable
 
undertaking.  One can predict with total confidence,  however,
 
that every teacher and every listener,  child or adult,  will
 
find somewhere in these tapes at  least one piece of music
 
that  is memorable,  haunting,  and personally evocative.
 
Likewise,  each one of the performances on these tapes will
 
sound like home to someone.  A little exploration here,  a bit
 
of risk,  daring to confront the possibly unfamiliar or
 
unfriendly,  and you will find your own particular piece or
 
pieces within the larger picture of the many musics of
 
Hawaii.
 
The harder part  is to learn how to follow one's friends
 
and neighbors into their music.  Musical  literacy is not
 
really especially helpful on this  journey,  and a lack of such
 
training should never disqualify a teacher from using these
 
materials.  The  later essays on each of the taped cultural
 
groups will open many doors.  But there are also some broad
 
ideas and perspectives that may prove helpful  in planning how
 
to experience and justify the entire project.
 
Recalling Earlier Journeys  in the History and Geography of
 
Music
  
More than 50,000 years ago, mankind embarked on perhaps
 
the greatest of all human adventures -
-
 the exploration of
 
Oceania,  during which generation after generation of voyagers
 
carried human beings onto almost every one of the myriad
 
islands scattered throughout the Pacific.  But these voyagers
 
were not  just explorers or tradesmen,  they were settlers as
 
well.  A great many of them stayed in the places they came to
 
and began to make new lives according to the new
 
circumstances they found.
 
Over the centuries,  the peopling of the Pacific made an
 
unparalleled contribution to the great human reference
 
library of things that had never been before,  creating an
 
enormous number of new languages,  designs,  chants,  stories,
 
star charts,  musical  instruments,  choral styles,  the whole
 
range of things and special ways to do things that make
 
people human.  The raging creativity of this  region is one of
 
the  first points to emphasize.
 
Nowadays there are few uninhabited places  left on earth,
 
and almost nowhere where no one has ever been.  But the human
 
impulse to explore continues  in the ever-restless  journeying
 
of peoples over all the earth's  surface,  sometimes pulled and
 
sometimes pushed.  Indeed,  it  is almost  impossible now to find
 
a place where only one kind of people  live,  for so many
 
travellers  still go on wanting to settle down in the places
 
to which they have come.  And after a while they bring their
 
families and friends  in too.
 
So matter where we live today,  we are always neighbored
 
by people of different backgrounds,  ideas,  experiences,  and
 
know-how,  for no traveller has ever arrived anywhere empty-
handed.
 
Each new settler has already learned as a child the
 
repertory of hand and mind skills essential to being whoever
 
he or she  is,  and these particular skills then become
 
developed,  amplified,  twisted into other shapes,  combined,

in the History and Geogr phv of
 
More than 50,000 years ago, mankind embarked on perhaps

the first points to emphasize.
 
Nowadays there are few uninhabited places left on earth,
 
and almost nowhere where no one has ever been.  But the human

of peoples over all the earth's surface,  sometimes pulled and

a place where only one kind of people live,  for so many
 
travellers still go on wanting to settle down in the places
 
to which they have come. And after a while they bring their
 
families and friends in too.
 
So matter where we live today,  we are always neighbored
 
by people of different backgrounds
 ideas,  experiences
 and
 
know-how,  for no traveller has ever arrived anywhere empty-
handed.
 
Each new settler has already learned as a child the
 
repertory of hand and mind skills essential to being whoever
 
he or she is,  and these particular skills then become
 
developed
 amplified
 twisted into other shapes,  combined,
 
passed on,  or forgotten,  as new circumstances dictate.  And
 
when other new peoples arrive,  everybody -
-
 natives and old-
family-newcomers and absolutely-new-newcomers alike -
-
 has to
 
get busy learning how to accommodate to the new situation.
 
This whole process has been going on for so many
 
thousands of years that one would think that the human
 
species would have caught on to the hang of it by now,  and it
 
would be considered the normal state of affairs.  Not so.  We
 
worry and complain about the results of human migrations in a
 
thousand guises.
 
We worry about  cultural purity,  we worry
 about the
 
economic impact of tourism and immigration,  about ethnic
 
representation,  about bi-lingual education,  about multi-
culturalism,  about political,  social and cultural equity.
 
There are even times when all this migrating around is
 
thought to be entirely negative in result,  and regulations
 
and laws  are concocted to prevent  it.  They never seem to work
 
for  long.
 
We may have to reconsider the entire issue.  It may turn
 
out,  indeed,  that the next great human adventures will not be
 
geographic but  spiritual -
-
 voyages  into the mysteries of
 
people-to-people contact.  Instead of discovering new places
 
to move to,  we may need to discover new levels of stimulation
 
and excitement at home.  How varied groups of humans can live
 
peaceably as neighbors  is a question for which we do not yet
 
know the answers.
 
How can differences be relished instead of resented? How
 
can this particular odd behavior be overlooked  (Or at least
 
tolerated,  as  in any family)  in view of the amusing,  lovely
 
or useful other things those folks do?
 
And here  is where art becomes  important,  indeed vital.
 
Almost all art  is a form of public statement,  and when an
 
artistic practice is common to a particular group of people,
 
it generally is designed to represent not only their especial
 
ideas of beauty but what they most  like to display about
 
themselves,  the best  foot they have to put  forward.
 
 
I
 
Even an unfamiliar art  form can become an area in which
 
explanations can lead to understandings,  and understandings
 
to friendships,  because most people feel intuitively that art
 
is a non-threatening area,  infinitely less  sensitive a forum
 
for contact than politics or economics.
 
Music is especially important  in this kind of cultural
 
interaction because it  is not totally language-based and can
 
therefore cross  cultural barriers more easily.  Indeed some
 
people have suggested that an improved way of communicating
 
between peoples might be through some yet to be invented
 
international multicultural music,  through which everyone on
 
earth could sing the  same  songs together.
 
That's a glorious picture,  but one should be mindful of
 
the old saying that you must be careful what you pray for
 
because you may get  it.  It  is not at all clear that a uniform
 
communication model such as a "world music" would survive
 
what  seems to be the absolutely universal desire of humans to
 
be different,  special to themselves.
 
It  is worth noting that as peoples have roamed about
 
the world,  carrying with them various highly developed
 
musical styles and repertoires,  both the new and the old
 
musics often persevere side by side.  Co-existence does not
 
necessarily lead to the kind of all-out competition where one
 
music wins and the other is never heard of again;  musics can
 
and usually do co-exist  in a kind of sensitive changeable
 
balance.
 
Their interactions can also  lead to new musical
 
inventions.  Occasionally an explosion of human creativity at
 
particular cultural crossroads has produced an entirely new
 
kind of music.  Jazz  is the  standard example,  though one can
 
cite dozens of others  including the still-evolving Polynesian
 
"himeni"  (hymns)
 
And Now Inside the Classroom.   
Music Can Be a Window Into Many Subjects
  
The human voice not only produces beautiful  sounds;  when
 
words are added,  it  sends messages.  The function of song as
 
poetry or literary communication can be explored on many
 
levels beginning with the simple personal statement of the
 
Owl's Lullabye  (Tape  h A)  or the chanted lament Mele A Ka ehu
 
(Tape  I A)  and continuing to the  larger mythological accounts
 
of the affars of the gods or the voyages of heroes as heard
 
in Oaka Kalani by Halau 0 Kekuhi.
 
It  is of real importance,  however,
 that the songs in
 
these tapes be utilized not only in music and literature
 
classes but in history and current affairs classes as well.
 
The testimony of popular belief which is contained in the
 
songs that people make up to sing about events,  is actually
 
part of the historical record.  It tells us what people  felt
 
at the time about what happened,  and even if they may have
 
gotten it a bit wrong,  their views may prove to be of
 
ultimate  significance  in terms of what they did next.
 
Music Can Advance the Practice of Careful Listening
 
For many adults as well as young people,  careful
 
listening is a heavy labor and requires conscious practice.
 
Teachers may be surprised to find that many students rarely
 
engage in it,  even though they may be continuously surrounded
 
by sound,  from the Muzak in the grocery store to their own
 
personal Walkmans.  And every adult knows how easy it is  for a
 
child to "tune him out",  even if the information being passed
 
on  is of great  importance.
 
Some children even "study" to music,  using it as a sound
 
baffle to block out casual  interruptions and ambient noise.
 
Thereby many listeners have come to regard hearing music -
-
any music -
-
 as a signal to start doing something else -
-
anything else.  Learning to pay strict attention to what  is
 
coming through the ears only,  may often be a new and complex
 
experience,  one that varies  in intensity according to whether
 
the particular music or speech is familiar or not.
 
Music Can Show We are All the Same and All Different
  
Especially for older students  it may be surprising
 to
 
discover that the musics on this album exemplify a basic
 
principle announced by anthropologists many years ago:
 
Every human being is  like all other human beings in
 
some ways:  (e. g.  in biological or physiological needs);
 
Every human being is  like some other human beings
 
in  some ways:  (e.g.  speaking the  same language);  and
 
Every human being is  like no other human being in
 
some ways;  (e. g.  even identical twins never share
 
identical  clusters of personality traits or experiences)
 
This plain-spoken and useful  formula,  which co-ordinates
 
the approaches of the biological/physical,  the social,  and
 
the psychological sciences,  can be applied to many things
 
besides human beings.  It  is certainly helpful when
 
considering music,  for every musical performance can be
 
discussed in any or all of the foregoing ways.
 
The First  Level -
 Every Music is  like All Other Musics
  
in Some Ways.  
Here students can be helped to discover by
 
experimentation the fascinating physical properties of sound,
 
for there  is no music without  sound,  no sound without
 
vibrations occuring at a range and speed suitable to the ear,
 
and no vibrations without movement.
 
Proving the truth of this  statement requires action
 
(always a delightful event  for children) : a vocal chord or
 
column of air in a trumpet or conch shell has to be set
 
vibrating by a breath,  or a string by a plucking finger,  a
 
drum-head by a hand or a stick,  a metal plate by a mallet.
 
The Second Level -
 Every Music is  like Some Other Music
  
in Some Ways.  
At this  level,  students can begin a lifetime's
 
exploration of the fact that although the physical  laws of
 
sound are universal,  every group of people has always,
 
because of a complex of geographical,  historical and cultural
 
factors,  emphasized and elaborated certain musical sounds and
 
played down and even eliminated others.  These combinations of
 
group aesthetic choices are usually called musical style,  and
 
they are due to the  infinite intertwining of geographical,
 
historical and cultural factors that each group of people has
 
experienced.  Certain scholars have been exploring these areas
 
for many years.*
 
The Third Level -
 Every Music is Like No Other Music in
  
Some Ways
  
And here we confront the artist,  the remarkable
 
individual human being who has comprehended and incorporated
 
the physical and cultural levels  (1 and 2)  into the act of
 
making music in such a personal and private way that an
 
experienced  (educated)  ear can often tell without other cues
 
just which particular singer or instrumentalist is giving a
 
particular performance.  Most of the time,  most artists are
 
working within the cultural  style their own group has
 
developed,  but  some few will be playing about on the outer
 
edges of that  style,  pushing the rules a bit,  adding
 
something new.  It  is a daring role and an important
 
responsibility.
 
Ideas  for Exploring the Second Level:  
In the schoolroom,  the second  (cultural)  level is
 
probably the one at which these tapes can best be enjoyed and
 
discussed,  for the cross-cultural exposure they provide is
 
possibly their most  important gift.  Here students can learn
 
to:

*  Appreciate the  Importance of Time-Depth
  
All the musics  included on these tapes,  even those of
 
relatively recent  immigrant groups,  have been in active
 
existence  for a very long time.  Present day listeners,
 
especially the young,  are all too well adapted to novelty and
 
rapid change,  and often pass by unhearing anything that  is
 
not  in current vogue.
 
Age,  however,  must be respected,  for the "test of time"
 
has always provided us with art of enduring value.  One does
 
not dismiss purely as  "old stuff" either an ancient Hawaiian
 
sacred mele or an eighteenth century string quartet,  for
 
generations of music makers have poured their creative
 
energies  into these sounds,  and generations of careful
 
listeners have selected them to remember and ask for again
 
and again,  so that they have survived the centuries and now
 
reward our privileged ears.
 
Even the apparently more contemporary musics on these
 
tapes utilize musical  styles that were generated in much
 
earlier periods.  Imaginative listeners experiencing all these
 
musics can liken them to windows  into antiquity,  when time
 
itself was probably experienced in very different ways.
 
*Accept that Differences Are  Indeed Different
  
Some of the sounds on these tapes may well be completely
 
opposite  from those we have been taught are appropriate  for
 
music-making.  Those of us  from Polynesian backgrounds,  for
 
example,  may feel that the human throat  should be open and
 
the vocal chords  should vibrate widely for the most
 
"beautiful"  sound to be produced.  Those from Asian
 
backgrounds,  on the contrary,  may find that  "beauty" lies  in
 
the voice when it  is at  its most  intense -
-
 narrow and pure,
 
uniform in color and volume,  disembodied,  piercingly
 
emotional.  Some orchestras,  also,  are composed largely of
 
struck membranes  (Polynesian drum choirs),  some of bowed
 
strings  (European symphonies),  some of metal gongs
 
L
 
(
Indonesian gamelans) .
 Each group may feel the other is a
 
bit bizarre,  even a bit non-musical.  This  is worth examining.
 
*Open Up the Ears to a Palette of New Sounds
  
But  it  is not necessary that we  "like" the music of our
 
neighbors and our friends.  Our lives will be enriched if we
 
can simply learn to consider and savor these musics and these
 
unfamiliar styles,  looking for their particular qualities and
 
their especial reasons  for being.  It's a little like learning
 
to enjoy a new food;  the first olive or bite of raw fish may
 
be distasteful,  but repeated and varied exposure may very
 
well produce a gourmet.
 
In the same way,  careful attentive  listening and re-
listening is the primary solution to appreciating those new
 
musics that may at  first seem totally unapproachable.
 
Learning about the music is another route to appreciation;
 
the  strangeness of a particular set of sounds may prove to be
 
because it was  created for a purpose particular to a time or
 
place or people that we are not  familiar with.  The more we
 
learn,  the more we will understand,  the more we will enjoy.
 
Some Hands-On  Ideas  for the Classroom
 
I believe that the teacher who has the opportunity to
 
use these remarkable tapes  in the classroom has a great
 
opportunity to educate in the original sense of the term -
-
to help lead students out of ways of thinking that are no
 
longer very fruitful,  to open up new visions and new
 
possibilities.  Of course,  there are tricks to the trade.  A
 
few ideas  follow that  can be dressed up or down according to
 
the age of the students and the  focus of the class.
 There
 
are hundreds more.

)  Make Some Music
  
*
 Sing Some Songs
  
The primary way of learning about music is always to try
 
one's hand at the making of it,  though a few cautions are
 
necessary here.  Traditional music is often thought of as
 
"simple" and something that  "everyone can join in on",  and
 
indeed almost every culture has a repertoire of musical
 
activities especially for children -
-
 singing or clapping
 
games,  for example -
-
 as well as a repertoire of social,
 
often party-time,  songs that are intended for everyone,
 
skilled and unskilled.
 
But overall,  we  find that all musical systems require
 
dedicated,  well trained,  and highly experienced artists  in
 
order for their true values to sound out clear,  and it  is
 
unwise to suggest to children that making some people's music
 
requires effort while other people's does not.
 
Cultural respect and tact enter in here;  for some
 
classes,  learning a childrens song from another culture may
 
be a good idea,  or joining in the singing of semi-official
 
songs  like  "Hawaii Aloha".
 
*
 Create Your Own Percussion Orchestra
 
Experiment with body slapping  (cf.  Sasa,  the Samoan
 
Seated Dance,  Tape
 )
 .
 The human anatomy is charmingly
 
variegated in pitch possibilities.  Try the difference between
 
slapping the forehead and the upper arm and the thigh.  Which
 
is higher in pitch? Which lower? Childrens'  clapping games in
 
many cultures emphasize these tonal possibilities.  Do any of
 
your students know any such games?
 
Oceania is an area where percussion is  generally
 
important;  there are many different kinds of drums and
 
clappers.  Some percussion traditions emphasize pitch
 
variation;  some  feature rhythmic variation and complexity.  In
 
listening to these tapes,  the relative  importance of these
 
two approaches  is observable and comparable between cultural
 
styles.
 
This could interest older students,  who might also look
 
into the relationship between the musical instruments used on
 
particular islands and the availability of the natural
 
materials  from which they are made.  The wide variety of
 
percussion instruments  in the Pacific is  in part a function
 
of whether or not an island contains  forests,  bamboo stands,
 
shell beaches,  coconut groves.
 
*Experiment with Time and Timing
 
Today's electronically-driven fast-paced communication
 
system divides  itself into ever shorter and brisker units,
 
from television sound bites to paragraph headings  for essays.
 
Since many of the musical examples on these tapes take the
 
listener into more reflective and prolonged experiences,  some
 
practice  in adjusting to the different usages of time may be
 
necessary.
 
Many children can benefit  from experiencing the
 
trickiness of estimating elapsed time:  holding a note and
 
guessing how many seconds  it  lasted,  for example,  or judging
 
the  length of a particular selection from these tapes.
 
Relativity enters  in too:  how can music that  is very fast-
paced last a long time?
 
Here is another area where active music-making can be
 
dramatically informative.  For example,  see if an entire class
 
could play a familiar clapping game exactly together on the
 
beat.  It will soon emerge that this  is a difficult task for
 
even two players.  But trying for simultaneity will not only
 
add to the class'  appreciation of the  "sasa" but  increase
 
their respect  for the accuracy required by many musics of
 
their experienced instrumentalists.
 
*Compare and Contrast
  
The qualities that make up musical styles can be
 
considered even on the primary level.  Some singers sing on
 
one pitch for one syllable;  others in many different pitches,
 
swooping the voice up and down,  using only one syllable -
-
"A-a-a-a-a-a-
N!" Similarly,  some singers may like to sing a
 
particular note and decorate it with trills or little
 
slidings up and down,  or perhaps they don't.
 
The important thing is to recognize that these effects
 
tend to be emphasized or not emphasized by singers not  just
 
because of their own individual feelings but because of the
 
general preferences of their own group.  In other words,  most
 
people in their home audience like to hear their songs done
 
in their own special culturally approved way.  Exactly what a
 
musician plays and how a singer uses her vocal chords is not
 
just a question of physical structure or technical agility;
 
it is primarily a matter of cultural identification informed
 
by personal taste.
 
It can be a fascinating exercise to list the ways in
 
which one performing group or one musical style differs from
 
or is similar to another.  Each performing group in these
 
tapes shares certain stylistic characteristics with some of
 
the other groups and is quite different from others;
 
comparing two or three in terms of frequency of vocal
 
ornamentation or other observable features would be an
 
interesting analytical project for older children.
 
It would also provide a perspective that may encode a
 
crucial point for students of any age who can thereby learn
 
to think of other groups not as  "those people who make those
 
funny noises" but as  "those people who generally sing by
 
themselves or one at a time" or "those people who mostly sing
 
all together" or "the ones who generally decorate the notes"
 
and "the ones who generally don't".  More technical terms for
 
musical description are of course,  available,  but have not
 
been used in this essay in order to reinforce the point that
 
/1
 V
 
a standard musical education is not essential for teachers
 
who wish to use these tapes  in the everyday classroom.
 
*Experiment with Ways to Show Appreciation
  
Investigating and practicing good multi-cultural
 
audience manners can help develop childrens'  individual
 
sensitivity and show them ways to make bridges between
 
groups.  Musicians from certain cultures like to have
 
audiences  clap along and interject shouts of approval,  while
 
others prefer a respectful  silence;  whistling may mean
 
pleasure or dislike depending upon the culture;  and everyone
 
can  learn a complimentary phrase  in another language.
 
*Explore Your Classroom's Resources
  
Since most  schoolrooms are multi - cultural,  some of the
 
musical styles  included on these tapes may be unfamiliar to a
 
particular teacher but very comfortable,  even "down-home",  to
 
individual class members.  In fact,  certain students might be
 
pleased to act as class  "experts" in the music of their own
 
backgrounds.  It  is also possible that particular students may
 
have relatives who are authorities in or practitioners of
 
musics included in these tapes;  it  is always exciting to
 
invite real musicians  in for demonstration and inspiration.
 
These are  fine tapes and well recorded,  but  for lasting
 
memories,  there  is nothing like living sound and living
 
musicians.
 
There may also be students  in class who come from
 
musical backgrounds that are not  included in these tapes;
 
this could provide an exciting opportunity for research and
 
amassing new information.  Put all the musics  in. It  is a
 
multi-cultural world we live in,  and the Golden Rule for a
 
multi-cultural world is to make sure that every single group,
 
no matter how tiny,  gets  some time and some recognition
 
In Closing
 
These tapes are tools.  They are of themselves excellent
 
in quality and therefore can be used without  fear,  without
 
any one of the preceding suggestions or ideas being put  into
 
effect.  Just having this music around,  being played every
 
once in a while,  taking its place in the school's overall
 
atmosphere,  will,  as Dr.  Trimillos points out  in his
 
Foreword,  have a positive effect.
 
So be of good heart.  Play these  remarkable tapes,
 
delight  in their variety,  and be proud of the complexity and
 
depth of the artistic resources that mark the beautiful  state
 
of Hawaii.
 
I wish you  joy in this new adventure!
