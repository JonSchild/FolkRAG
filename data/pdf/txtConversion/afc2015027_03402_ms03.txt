Interview afc2015027_03402_ms03 
00:00:00  Christine Lewis asks Darlene Flores her name, current occupation (unemployed), 
where she’s from (Trinidad and Tobago), currently living in New Jersey. 
00:00:30   How Darlene came to be a domestic worker.  Took care of siblings. Always loved 
taking care of children.  Arrived in America without documentation so babysitting didn’t require 
this. 
00:01:30   How she got her first job, friend of hers recommended her.  First job was a live in job.  
Has been doing babysitting for 18 years, six or seven positions. 
00:02:30   The daily routine on the job.  Different kinds of jobs.  Only indoor work. 
00:04:00   The day’s routine step by step.  Depends on ages of children.  Activities with children, 
going to park, bookstore, libraries, sings.  Basic mothering skills. 
00:05:30   Safety is number one.  Patience also important. 
00:06:30   Whether training is important or not.  What cultural approaches does she bring to the 
job.  Importance of hygiene. 
00:08:17   Any specialized skills—what you do on job is what you do at your own home.  
Christine provides several examples from her own work that she brings. 
00:09:00   Reading, sing, keeping children active. 
00:10:00   Singing, dancing, having fun.  Children don’t always like what you bring for them to 
do. 
00:11:00  What kind of clean environment practices Darlene inherited.  Sterilizing bottles. 
Washing dishes.  Rewashing pots that were not clean and setting a higher standard for “clean” in 
the home she worked in. 
00:12:30   Tensions around being a “clean freak.”  Humor in washing various things over.  
Dishwashers often fail. Food gathers in the bottom if dishes are not rinsed first.  Rocking 
children to sleep.  Taking walks in stroller.  Singing to them. Ways to make them eat vegetables.  
Bribes.  If/then statements, positive or negative.  You will never see the doctor if you eat healthy 
food X.   Rocking them. 
00:17:00  Taking them for a walk is a favorite activities.  Parents allow certain activities and 
disallow others.  Reading live, or using tablet for stories before bed.

00:17:30  Home remedies and cultural medicines. Rocking helps for teething as well.  Epsom 
salts, pumpkin stems, ice. Baking soda for itch.  
 
00:19:30   Difficulty of hearing children cry, remembering it.  Bonding with children. 
 
00:20:00   Children calling babysitters “Mama.”  Darlene recalls an incident where child was 
cutting a tooth and parents didn’t know.  Child was crying and drooling a lot. 
 
00:21:30   Medicines good for rashes.  Child with a rash that looked like ringworm.  Fixed with a 
cream she bought herself. 
 
 00:23:14  Rash never came back.  Ringworm versus eczema.  Ringworm is not only a “third 
world thing.” Children get it from other children. Doctor called ringworm a third world thing. 
 
00:24:00   Debate about putting babies to sleep on their stomachs versus on their backs or to the 
side. 
 
00:26:00   Babysitters know the sleeping patterns and other habits because they are there most of 
the hours. Her specialty was healing the rash with Candid B cream.   
 
00:27:00   Provided advice about finger feeding before they eat on their own.  Darlene’s favorite 
part of the job is spending time with the baby.  Parents can be a nightmare.  
 
00:28:30   Seeing babies growing up is enjoyable.  Worst part of job is not having a good 
relationship with parents. Lots of “don’t do that” statements. Jealousy. 
 
00:29:30   Sometimes Darlene holds off on hugging a baby to avoid creating tension.  Consent 
from parents is important regarding hugging.  
 
00:30:00  Darlene’s friend reporting being told not to kiss the baby goodbye.  “If he ever calls 
you “Mama,” I’m going to die.”  
 
00:30:30   Conflict at another job where father asked for his son.  She clarified she loved his son 
in a different way than she loved her own.   
 
00:31:30   Relationship with most recent employer was terrible.  Interviewed for job while she 
was in Trinidad taking care of her own mother.  Mother of baby was very ill.  Father informed 
her her first three weeks would be unpaid.  She asked what she should tell her landlord. 00:33:30 
Father was a stay at home Dad and mother had cancer. Husband labeled all their food so that 
Darlene would not eat it.  Worked 10 hour days. 
 
 00:35:00  Found food labeling offensive.  Families that don’t want worker’s food in their fridge 
either. Darlene explained that in her country neighbors regularly shared food.

00:36:30   Shame felt about the food labeling.  Other problems escalated but she stayed because 
she fell in love with the baby.  She stayed in the job during January 2016 because they had no 
help, no family.  Day and night job.  
 
00:37:00   Two week live-in.  The worst job she had in 18 years.  Took the abuse for six months 
until it got out of hand. 
 
00:38:00   Other jobs were memorable.  Lived with a family for four years, good times traveling 
and seeing kids grow up. Still sees them and uses them as primary reference. 
 
00:39:00   A lot of trust with this family. Good feeling to be trusted. 
 
00:39:30  Emotions around working with children.  Patience is important. 
 
00:40:00   Importance of staying in contact with own family.  How she coped with the worst job 
situation.  Avoided the husband.   Wife told husband to leave Darlene alone. Other family 
members were very appreciative to her.  Darlene did it for the mother and the baby, ignoring 
husband. 
 
00:42:00   Patriarchal cultures, male dominance. How husband’s mother came and was cooking 
for him, not for the wife. Her final days on the job, objecting when they let the baby become 
filthy and let her clean baby up.  She calls father a “monster.”  Kitchen was also left super dirty. 
 
00:44:30   How it was a pleasure for her to clean the child (part of what she said to the father). 
 
00:45:30   Mother in pain because she had had radiation.  Tells woman with cancer that it’s 
ridiculous her husband and mother in law had not helped when she couldn’t do it herself 
(because she was ill). Mother cried. 
 
00:46:00   Darlene realized it was an abusive relationship.  Abusive to his mother, abusive to his 
wife. 
 
00:46:30   Experiences like these make us stronger.  Were Darlene’s hours and holidays 
respected?  (No.) 
 
00:47:00   Husband never threw out the trash.  Left it in middle of room or let his sick wife do it.  
Finally Darlene was dismissed without pay and shoved around, and called the police on him.  
Wife was Greek, husband Turkish.  Worst job experience.   
 
00:48:30  Full version of the departure incident when police were called.  Man locked his wife 
and baby in a room and fired Darlene, not allowing her to come inside to claim her possessions.  
Husband shoves her, and she asks doorman to call the police.  Cops brought down her salary.  
She makes a report and gets hell from lawyers. 
 
00:53:00  How it took different signs for Darlene to realize it was an abusive marital 
relationship. Bruises, baby afraid of noises.

00:54:00 Any other stories of other workers’ exploitation?  (No.)  Darlene agrees undocumented 
workers are more likely to be taken advantage of.  Darlene looks forward to going home (to 
Caribbean) anyway. How America is not what it’s made out to be. 
 
00:55:30  How she missed her grandmother’s funeral.  Difficulty of leaving family, especially 
children, behind. 
 
00:56:30  The fun of carnival in Caribbean culture.  Beauty of Caribbean life on the water, steel 
pan music, macaroni pie.  Importance of not volunteering to cook too many things because you 
become the cook, another job on an already small salary. 
 
00:58:30   A friend who got stuck repeating her chicken and meatball recipes. 
 
00:59:00   If people are appreciative, she does more.  The work is not all for money. 
 
00:59:30   Darlene’s own family unit, sibling she lost.  Family members. 
 
01:01:00   How to balance personal life, family life, work life.  Technology keeps her close to 
her son. 
 
01:01:30   Family gets sacrificed though. 
 
01:02:00   How did Darlene survive the first two weeks, live in, for the Greek/Turkish couple?  
Avoidance, walks with baby, reads books, plays games on tablet. 
 
01:03:30   Nothing is forever as her grandmother used to say.  Takes job seriously but vacations 
are a relief.  
 
01:04:00   Talking to family also helps.  Does not belong to organizations.  
 
01:04:30   How Darlene explains her job to her son.  Points out that she’s coming back and some 
people don’t have any parents at all.  It’s a sacrifice. 
 
01:05:30   Darlene’s Mom, how she enjoys being with her, going to the beach.  It’s hard for 
everyone.  Her mother is ill.  She visits whenever she can.  
 
01:06:00   How does Darlene stay active?  Christine provides examples.  Darlene goes out with 
friends on weekends. Found DWU online.  Girlfriend told her about the Bill of Rights.  How 
DWU addressed the rights questions she had been thinking about for years. 
 
01:08:00   What needs DWU addresses.  DWU Bill of Rights is just a start.  Needs building.  No 
job security.  
 
01:09:30   DWU is like a barrier protecting from a tsunami.

01:10:00   Hopes Bill of Rights will become bigger, that equality will prevail.  Why is the 
movement important?  It’s the only way to build.   Helps people work better, helps the work get 
more appreciated. Legislators should know that they’re human they have a hard job, should be 
treated equally. 
 
01:12:30   Skills she looks forward to gaining?  Likes to sing and travel.  Likes to socialize.  
Would study cosmetology, likes that.  Likes the idea of little outings with DWU.  
 
01:14:30   Coming together with ally groups is also part of the outings.  The bigger the group the 
better. 
 
01:15:00   Any final words?  Darlene is happy she was introduced to DWU.  Appreciates the 
group’s efforts to make things better for domestic workers.  
 
01:16:00   Darlene will share her friends’ contact info so they can participate.
