TXO1: G-Pemberton; 21GT Sue gives brief background to Banish on the 
work of the American Folklife Center and the Pinelands Folklife 
Project. There is a slight interruption to discuss plugging in 
the recorder versus using batteries. Mary introduces the 
interview and Banish. Some lapse as the microphone situation is 
reassessed, tie clip mike versus condenser mike. Sue continues to 
introduce the project, discusses our relationship to the 
Pinelands Commission, Dept. of the Interior, potential 
results 
of their project. Stresses relationship between people and the 
land. Interrupted by another office worker who asks if we 
left 
some Great Adventure flyers; that issue 
is 
resolved (we didn't). 
Mary asks Frank for help 
in 
locating Black, Hispanic, Oriental 
communities in Pemberton Township and 
in giving us contacts in 
the communities. (5 minutes) Frank thinks this is very 
interesting and sounds like a fun job. Asks about our 
professional backgrounds. Is amazed that there are such things as 
Ph.D.s in folklore. Mary explains ethnobiology. Frank asks about 
the Rhode Island project that I mentioned earlier. Mary comments 
on the variety of groups of people in the area that could be 
documented. Frank mentions sneakbox builders. He also works 
in 
Cape May County and how Dennis Township is an old boatbuiIding 
center. Mary asks for contacts. 
Mary and I bring out the USGS quadrangle maps. Frank 
mentions that in few months he will have a census breakdown of 
the various populations of ethnic groups such as blacks and 
Hispanics. He starts to point out various areas. 
The first is 
Lake Valley Acres, sometimes referred to as Death Valley Acres. 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 1 
He thinks it 
is a misunderstood neighborhood. It 
is progressively 
designed with rear access through alleyways. Early example of 
suburbanization of this portion of the county. Nice looking 
neighborhood, not much blight. Mainly black, a few Hispanics. 
Some apartments, police say they are the hell hole of the 
township. 
Blacks are the most significant minority in the area. Mary 
asks what brought them there. Frank says an affiliation with Fort 
Dix. They take good care of their property, are oriented towards 
education, more disciplined with their 
kids, mostly from the 
south, not northern urban blacks. Some mixed marriage. Sunbury 
Village is predominantly minority occupied. Many retired people 
from Fort Dix. Have kids who are done with school and become part 
of 
local unemployment 
problem. Typical guy 
is 
in his 50s. Heavy 
civilian employment at base. Employment orientation is toward 
riverfront (Rancocas) corridor starting at Mt. Holly. There 
is a 
network of highways out Rt. 38 where industrial opportunities 
start to come along. 
(10 minutes) Mary asks about churches. Frank thinks there 
are 10 or 15 Black churches. There are more churches here than 
any place he's ever seen. A variety of minorities are 
represented. Recently gave a permit to a Korean Baptist church. 
Lots of Hispanics in Lake Valley acres. They 
speak Spanish 
and many Puerto Rican people are not far removed from the old 
country. No English as 
a Second Language program in the schools. 
Orientals are harder to target in terms of specific 
neighborhoods and have more of a tendency to blend into the 
suburban area. They don't stick out. Mary talks about the 
Oriental Food and Gift shop 
in Browns Mills. They associate as a 
group. Frank talks about a recent "Oriental takeover" (not in a 
derogatory way) 
in Browns Mills in the strip shopping areas along 
Lakehurst Road. Harukos is 
long established in the community, 
able to supply cooking needs. One store was owned by an Irish 
immigrant, sold it to a gentleman named Kim from New York City. 
Former Cintron's market, used to be Spanish center, now purchased 
by Mr. Kim. 
(15 minutes) Sue discusses a Philadelphia Inquirer article 
about Oriental truck farmers in New Jersey working here 
in the 
warm months to supply the Chinatowns of eastern cities and then 
going to Florida in 
the winter to farm down there and send the 
goods north. Speculates on mercantile ties. Mary mentions 
imports. 
Frank discusses the manmade lakes 
in Browns Mills. Created 
in 
1917 as a resort community. Influence of automobile made shore 
more accessible and left the resort lakes out on a limb as they 
had been dependent on the railroads to bring people in. But prior 
to the Depression Browns Mills was a pretty jumping place. Free 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
lots for subscribing to the Atlantic City Press, 20 foot lots. 
Insubstantial summer bungalow structures, filter down kind of 
housing market. Winterized, upgraded. Some neighborhoods have 
certain ethnic complexions. Mentions several remnant 
architecturally interesting structures, two—story cabin, an old 
hunting lodge. Bank building on corner used to be sanitorium. 
Talks about Deborah hospital and other sanitoriums. Trenton Rd. 
has lots of old houses, a former hotel/tavern just below Deborah. 
(20 minutes) Pictures exist of old wood palaces built in 
19th century, before the resorts got developed, along Rancocas 
Creek. Topographic quirks of creek, drainage area. Streams, as 
they get to New Lisbon are less meandering and shallow and become 
deeper and wider. North branch was impounded in New Lisbon but 
the dam no 
longer exists. Surprising topography. You know when 
you're leaving the Pinelands because of the changing vegetation 
and relief. Rancocas is sort of boundary. It 
is also the 
inspiration for tourist attractions which rely on natural 
resources but in updated contexts. The resources are a unifying 
thread. Tourist interest came along very early. 
Mary asks about connection between Hispanic population 
associated with Fort Dix and migrant workers. Do migrant workers 
stay? Frank talks about Italians as old migrant workers. 
Mechanized equipment came along but even so 
many workers 
remained and subsisted on the 
local economy, availing 
themselves of 
local natural resource and becoming an 
indigenous 
core of (Frank says) "people that 
we refer to as Pineys". Local 
residents were also seasonal farm workers, have always subsisted 
at, 
lowest level 
of economy. High welfare rate. Piney lifestyle 
has been shaped by 
lack of significant employment opportunities. 
"They've adopted it because they haven't had a lot of other 
choices." 
(25 minutes) Points out Black enclave, remnants of a former 
economy, along Browns Mills/Pemberton Rd. just as you come into 
Browns Mills from the west. Doesn't really have a name. Lots of 
little houses, charming area, storybook houses, now poorly 
maintained. Remnant of earlier resort economy, that's what the 
cottages were built for. Not upgraded or expanded. 
Mary asks 
if Pemberton Blacks are connected to older Black 
settlements in Cookstown or Whiting. Frank doesn't know. 
Sue points area on map near Browns Mills and asks for names. 
Frank identifies as Oak Ridge Estates and Blueberry Manor. Tract 
housing. Mixed occupancy. Some bigger and newer homes. Upper 
middle class. And also some smaller homes with white families 
how've been there 30 years. Big problems with absence of 
maintenance have incorporated some property maintenance 
regulations about painting roof repair, cut grass. 
Mary asks about gardens. Frank says they are not very 
Samuelson--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 3 
successful because of the sandy soil. Although one person 
in 
Browns Mills has spent a lot of time putting nutrients into the 
ground over the years and 
is now quite productive. 
(30 minutes) Mary asks about ethnic differences in gardens. 
He didn't know. Mary asks about Italian enclaves but Frank says 
they're pretty Americanized; "they're all over." 
We talked about the evolution of the lake communities. The 
part in Browns Mills 
is the oldest, then Country Lakes, then the 
Presidential and Lebanon Lakes developments. Talks a little about 
the kinds of people that live there. Part of post—World War II 
suburban sprawl. Youth problems in Presidential Lakes. 
Frank gives a little background on Ft. Dix and Hanover 
Furnace. I ask about local appreciation of the furnace area. He 
wants planning board to capitalize on 
its presence. (35 minutes) 
Old cannoballs used to be unearthed in the area. Lots of bottle 
digging but no clubs. People tend to mind their own business 
except for civic and ethnic affiliations. 
Where Pineys live: Junction Rd./Mt. Misery Rd. Alfred 
Anderson, who works 
in the township garage, 
lives here. 
Connotations of term Pineys, derogatory or in—group use. "Many 
people who have no respect for Pineys consider themselves Pineys 
because they've been here for generations and generations and 
they farm the 
land. These is the Pinelands and they have a right 
to be."(40 minutes) Landed gentry Pineys and back to nature 
Pineys. Tom Darlington is a Piney but has greater aspirations 
too. 
Points out Magnolia Rd. as a good area. Seasonal traffic, 
shore route. Farm stands. Where Earl Piper lives. 
(45 
minutes) Mary asks for contacts in Southampton 
Township. 
Agricultural networks. Leave Pinelands with its poor soils, 
berry agriculture then will find better farmland and upland 
agricultural character. Both areas tied into same marketing 
network. 
(50 minutes) Pemberton Borough. Postmasters. Township 
population is 30,000; 1970--19,000; 1960--13,000; 1950--4500. 
Before the suburban boom there was a small nucleus of people who 
all 
knew each other. Fort Dix 
is principal reason minorities are 
here except for a few earlier blacks engaged in agricultural 
occupations. Being a post town isn't easy. 
Frank's impression of this area as 
isolated. Country music 
events brought in a lot of people. The audience though has 
changed 
in ten years, from locals to outsiders, younger group. 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 4 
Old buildings burned down. Old hotels. Influence of 
railroads, now abandoned. Elevated crossing in New Lisbon. 
(60 minutes) Different types of Pineys in south Jersey. 
Those 
in Bass River/New Gretna are very different from those 
in 
Pemberton. Baymen approach. Western--agricultural, eastern--bays 
and oceans. People don't move around that much. 
Earl Piper interrupts. Frank tells him he would be good 
contact. 
Earl says he's a storyteller (maybe a self—described 
"liar" too?). Talks about women who would have a baby one day and 
be back 
in the bogs the next day. People had to work hard 
in 
order to 
live. 
More background on the project for Earl's 
information. Talks about this 
last year, bad for blueberries. 
(65 minutes) Mary gets contacts from Frank as I talk to Earl

TX01: Kimberly's background. Living in Ft. Dix G—New Hanover; 19GT 
She hates New Jersey; "I think New Jersey's bad." It's boring. 
She prefers California. 
General discussion of Korean community in area. Mainly wives 
of servicemen or "retired Army." Church is 
important as gathering 
place. History of Korean Baptist Church in Browns Mills and 
Pemberton. Good chaplain, Rev. 
Im. Congregation of about 100. 
Services at 2:00 P.M. because another church has services in the 
building in the morning. Get togethers and parties 
at Christmas 
and Easter, parties. Celebrate Korean Independence Day on August 
15th. Would sing country songs as part of celebration. 
Thanksgiving celebrated too. 
Eugene's Oriental Food Store 
serves as 
informal gathering 
place. Another store 
in Wrightstown, Young Jin, 
is where most of 
the church people go because owner is a member. Her name is Mrs. 
Yu. Haruko's is Japanese. Most of the Japanese go to Haruko's. 
Some Filipinos go to Eugene's and Young Jin. (Its Yellow Pages 
advertisement says 
Korean/Chinese/Japanese/Phillipino(sic)/Thai— 
land/Taiwan.) 
Again, women married to servicemen. 
(5 minutes) Japanese don't congregate much. She doesn't like 
the Japanese because they conquered Korea in the past. Eugene's 
owner says Chinese come into the store but Kimberly hasn't seen

Shows me some artifacts such as a 7 panel embroidered screen 
(present from a lady 
in her church 
in Korea) with writing on 
back. Kimberly thinks the writing is a poem in Chinese 
characters. Pauses while I photograph. She points out places 
where cats have scratched it. 
(10 minutes) Photograph back of screen. Lots of Korean 
people have these screens 
in their houses. How she met her 
husband. How he doesn't let her do anything. 
While he 
is away at 
Officer Candidate School she will stay 
in Pemberton. She's been 
tied down for 6 years. Photograph her, then Chris. 
We go upstairs. She shows me wall hangings, bedspreads, baby 
blankets. I photograph. (15 minutes) One 
is called a mink 
blanket, very warm. Discusses cost of some of these items. 
(20 minutes) She brings out some Korean clothes, a white and 
blue skirt and jacket. Worn on January Ist to go visiting. She 
models it and I photograph. Also worn at Christmas and other 
special occasions. In Korea older women wear it. 
(25 minutes) Go downstairs. Kimberly shows me a calendar 
from Eugene's Store which has beautiful pictures of women 
in 
traditional Korean costumes. I ask 
if 
local women do any 
embroidery, blanket making. Mostly the stuff 
is ordered from 
Korea or bought over there and 
Eugene's sells a lot of stuff.

TXO1: G—Magnolia Road; 21GT Blueberry farming. Bush family--
blueberries and turkeys (40,000). Everything is volume. Piper has 
100 acres, 30 in blueberries{Pemberton: 051. New varieties. 
Produce more, easier to maintain, might not taste as good. 
Demand for cranberries low in 
1920s and 1930s. Blueberries 
were coming in. Now more cranberries again, especially if water 
is available. Wet machine is 95% efficient, dry scoop 
is 70% 
efficient. Rooting vines. Cuttings. 143,560 plants per acre. Lots 
of work. Lettuce planter can be used. Phil Marucci, county 
agricultural agent, 
is a great guy. 
Price range for cranberries, past and present. People's idea 
that cranberries are only for Christmas and Thanksgiving. Piper's 
brother—in—law would eat them at every meal. Piper eats cranberry 
sauce with pancakes, 
loves cranberry pie 
(5 minutes) Talks about the Bush family. Several members 
have blueberries. Original name was, Bushan, French—Canadian. 
Victor Bush (Piper's wife's grandfather) was head of family. Sons 
were Brandon, Russell, Delbert . A cousin, Harry, was also 
mentioned. Some people do all 
cranberries, some all blueberries, 
and some both.

Lots of rustling of 
papers as he tries to find a handout on the history of the area. 
(5 minutes) Long period of silence as tape recorder is 
left 
running while mayor leaves room to find this handout. 
Geographical description. which townships form its 
boundaries. History, especially its renaming from 
Coa.xen, 
an old 
Lenni Lenape Indian name. (Town was also called Quakertown and 
Vincent.) 28,833 acres of 
land, 43.31 square miles. 
1880 
population was 2,269; 1980 was 8,888. Town meetings used to be at 
somebody's house, on the porch or 
in the street. (10 minutes) 
Read minutes of town meeting when town named was changed from 
Coaxen to Southampton. Dog taxes, school fund. If politicians 
spent more money than was allocated they paid it out of their own 
pockets. Name changed in 1845. 
Changes in township committee because of population increase. 
119 miles of roads, mainly asphalt. 
Vincentown is nucleus of township, postal address. But parts 
of other townships use Vincentown as postal coverage. Southampton 
Township is served by five different post offices. (15 minutes) 
Trying to get the situation straightened out. 
Primarily agricultural area. Used to be mostly dairy farms. 
Now only two left and they're not large. Most of township has 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 9 
been bought up by speculators. Political make-up of town has 
never been too much for speedy growth. "We've never had too much 
of a problem saying no." Agriculture ground is now sod farms. 
County takes some development rights, safe from housing. Some 
horse farms, both hobby and professional. Cameron raises horses 
for sulky racing. (20 minutes) 
I get out USGA maps. Agricultural and wooded areas. 
Southeast section of township is the real wooded area, where they 
get into the Pines. Years ago the whole section used to be pines, 
people who lived in 
it were called Pineys even if 
you didn't work 
in the woods. Rarely did people travel far to go to work. Worked 
in cranberry bogs. Summertime collect wild huckleberries, 
in fall 
helped harvest cranberries, then pruning blueberries. Part of the 
year work for someone for wages and part work for themselves. His 
grandfather had small farm, raised horses, chickens, corn, garden 
crops. In summer he and wife picked huckleberries by hand. 
Corn 
was to feed horses and chickens. (25 minutes) In winter he just 
hunted. Made wine from grape arbor. Maybe made only $700 a year 
but 
in good shape. 
Didn't have any expenses. Went to bed when it 
got dark and got up when it was light. Still a few people who do 
different kinds of jobs. Some blueberry farmers are carpenters in 
winter. Kind of 
independent, work when they feel 
like 
it. Not big 
spenders or big travellers. 
(30 minutes) Return to maps. History of Leisuretown, began 
in 1972. Always has done pretty well. Its impact on township, 
somewhat of an asset. Require fundamental services that don't 
cost a lot of money. Streets, garbage collection. Little 
problems. Years ago, different attitude, If you had a problem you 
didn't call the township but took care of 
it yourself. 
Government does everything for you. 
His father used to camp and 
work 
in the charcoal pits in the area that now is Leisuretown. 
Stayed in a wagon. 
Points out other concentrations of population and housing 
developments. 
(35 
minutes), 
including Medwick (a new housing 
development, 1-acre lots). Ask about Buddtown. Mostly farmers or 
farm tenants. Points out some racetracks and other little 
population pockets. No ethnic enclaves. A German family here, an 
English family there. Most people are 3rd or 4th generation 
"that really didn't know what their backgrounds were." Couple of 
old French farmers, points out their farms to me on the map 
(marked French farmer #1 and French farmer #2 on 
Pemberton 
quadrangle map). One was called Fauncy, can't remember the other 
ones name. Laughs about "the old French kiss job, one side and 
the other, when you left and when you stopped. You got it both 
times. That was, when we were kids, that was really something. 
(He 
is referring to the French greeting and leaving taking 
formula of kissing people on each cheek.)... We'd just stop and 
talk and he would give you the old French job. We couldn't get 
over it." No descendants. 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 10 
His grandmother's family came from Alsace—Lorraine. One week 
they were German, the next week they were French. "So we just 
never claimed to be anything or anybody... We're thoroughly 
Americanized in 
this area where we are." There was a Polish 
family (indicated on Pemberton quadrangle map, on Buddtown Rd.) 
descendants still around. One lives on New Rd. Their name was 
Gazinsky. (40 minutes) 2 sons, one lives 
in Pemberton, and Loui 
Gazinsky lives 
in Southampton. 
Lots of Poles in Hainesport. 
s 
Churches not places to socialize. Grange Hall 
is still 
active. It's 
in Vincentown. One of the central farm meeting 
area. Meals. Something going ion there every week, Friday, 
Saturday night, during week, crowds of cars. Contact person: 
Til 
Ostner (lives 
in Buddtown). Runs most of their dinners and 
things. Been active ewver since he can remember (he's 57). 
A few hunting clubs. One on Hawkins Rd. One at Red Lion 
Circle. Volunteer fir companies, one 
in Vincenton and one 
in 
Hampton Lakes. Another one 
outside of town but subsized by 
Southampton. 
(45 minutes) Catch pike and bass 
in Rancocas Creek. 
Stream 
and kake in town--catfish and pickle pike. 
Lake is a millpond 
but a natural 
lake. Two mills, sawmill and flour mill. One 
building left, 
is a service station. Ice house, used to take 
ice 
off the pond. Mills active up until he was 13 or 14. 
30 years ago Vincentown was really a pretty town. Big trees

Lisbon; 21GT in my map files for location of buildings discussed 
in this interview. 
House on New Lisbon Rd. Moved during World War II. Used to 
be on a dirt road leading to Ft. Dix, called Lemontown Rd. A few 
houses there, possibly a school. 
Area settled a little before turn of the century. 
House with big porch. Three 
in a row with the same owner, 
Leeds, one of the founders (?founding family) of New Lisbon, 
in 
blueberries and cranberries. 
Another house, connected with the old Methodist church. 
Church was Episcopalian at one time, then a Black church. Bell

like 
in New England. 
Green house north of post office used to be a boarding 
house. 
Harris family lives 
in former general store house. (144) 
Buildings of Tru—Blue Blueberry Coop, started sometime 
around World War II. Cranberries were being phased out and 
blueberries coming in. Now has half the membership as 
in old 
days. Used to have 400 members, today about 200. Used to be 
thriving place until about 10 years ago. (208) 
Can't move into New Lisbon. Hard to buy land. Safe, can 
leave houses and cars unlocked. Population. 200 houses but 30,000 
people because of 
institutions. Houses off of roads. Some 
seasonal people. Philadelphia and New York people used to come

fires allowed." Rare weed. Want the forest to be 
left alone.

Most came from Philadelphia, north Jersey. Legal 
rights to 
enforce sanctuary.

House directly across street from post office. Old bachelor 
(70 years old, black hair) used to 
live there, had a pipe organ, 
Doyle used to play it. House has stone front. 
(535) 
Green house that used to be boarding house. Used to be twice 
as big. Like a hotel. Pavillion back in the woods for Saturday 
dances. 
More recently, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts used it as a 
day camp. Owners of 
land were connected to Elizabeth White. 
Points out flag pole and foundation of old post office, now 
overgrown. (573) 
Talk between Elaine and I as we wait for Doyle to return 
from putting coats in his car.

Burrs, stuck on 
me and on him. Not dangerous. Only get them 
at this time of year, when they turn brown. 
Motorcycling back 
in woods. Owner tries to keep them out. 
Lake. Water, boats, fishermen. (703) Dam broke. Owner fixed 
it once, cost too much. State wouldn't help. Asked people in area 
for support, but they wanted state to carry it. Beautiful when 
full 
of water, especially in autumn, Water still, reflection. 
Hundreds of cars would stop on bridge to take pictures. 
reflection on three sides. Old iron pipe used to be buried under 
road, for a fountain. He 
is amazed at how things disappear so 
fast. 
Darlington's land. Doyle owned part of 
it at one time. He 
was going to build a house and dock at one time.

Mrs. Macumber, 
life saving expert, from California, stayed 
at boarding house, used to teach everyone life—saving. Story of 
how Doyle saved someone's life when they were drowning. 
New Lisbon is 
in Pemberton Township "but everybody says it's 
really not part of the township, from all around us it's 
different." Still the same as 
it was 30 or 40 years ago. 
Pinelands Commission office is part of old White estate. Houses 
painted, basically the same. Some the same inside, some 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs

modernized. (888) Can't buy your way in, primarily a few people 
have bought it up, Whites and Darlington, pass it on from 
generation to generation. 
Mr. Darlington, nice, good attitude, 
is for New Lisbon. 55 
years old. 
New Lisbon as border town between forest and agricultural. 
Pemberton and Browns Mills people think New Lisbon is 
like a 
dump. To everyone else it's beautiful place to be. People think 
there's nothing going on, 
no commercial business.It's 3-4 minutes 
from Pemberton and Browns Mills. 9 shopping malls within 30 
minutes. 30 miles from shore, 30 miles from Philly, 90 miles from 
New York. People in Cherry Hill who think they're (people in New 
Lisbon) hicks, out 
in the country. He doesn't think anything of 
going there (to Cherry Hill) but they think it's a trip to the 
country to come here. 
"What it really comes to 
is they're the 
hicks. They won't get out. When they get out of town they're 
lost. When they get out of Philly they think Jersey is...We get 
around more than them. We think nothing of going down there every 
night for dinner. Miriam (his wife) and I have driven that far 
for lunch. It's a half hour drive. It's no big deal. Times have 
changed. But they'll say to me, "We can't get up to see you 
because it's such a big trip up there." So you see who's behind, 
and it's not us."(910) Has friends who get up early to come see 
them and 
it only takes 45 minutes. Come to see them 3 or 4 times 
a year and it's a big trip. 
His father came from Harrisburg, mother from Trenton and 
Bordentown. He was born in Bordentown. Started school here. 
Little red schoolhouse in Browns Mills. High school 
in Pemberton. 
Left during war. Wife from Mercervi lie. Lived there for a while.

TX01: Note: Sound on this tape 
is very bad at times because of 
passing trucks and planes flying overhead. 
Airplanes, flying into Ft. Dix/Maguire. Flight patterns, low 
flying. Jet crash nearby, 10 years ago. Pilot lived in G—New 
Lisbon; 21GT, purposely missed his house and died only a couple of 
hundred yards away. Gave up his life to save his family. 
(28) Brother's house, the old boarding house. Used to be 
much bigger, very impressive. Other sections on various sides. 
Seeds for trees, Like punk, 
little things that grow out of 
water, like brown cigars, 
like cat of nine tails. Kids would 
light them up. 
Wild blueberries. Can't eat at this time of year. 
Another berry, very dark, "black as coal." Can't eat, 
poisonous. 
Old dam. Water level. (Water rushing in background.) (87) 
Poisonous berries, called ink berries. 
Horses near Pinelands Commission. Darlington owns land, 
leases land to people with horses. 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 16 
Local kids go swimming in pond on north side of town. Always 
a great summer place. Name of streams and pond was just "the 
Rancocas," no special name. 
Mail coming through the office, for Lebanon Lakes, Country 
Lakes. 
How he got to be postmaster. Go from small office to 
large 
office. Small postmaster has to know it all, not a hick. 
Constantly being trained. (214) People like him, stand at the 
window. Other postmasters would ask for him when he was working 
as a kid. Navy mail specialist for 
6 years, went way up 
in 
command. Kept getting promoted. Went all over. Set up post 
offices. All over US, NY, San Francisco ,Honolulu, mail ship, go 
around and meet the fleet, Marshalls. Handled a lot of money, 
more than any person 
in the world. 30-100 people at windows. 
Minimum of a million dollars a day, disbursing office, guards 
followed him around. 
Holding New Lisbon together with the post office. (292) 
Constant threat of being closed down. Offers to upgrade himself. 
Thinks maybe he should've done 
it. Close it down and not have a 
New Lisbon. Browns Mills has rural 
routes through town. Christmas 
parties, famous. 100,000 people, 50,000 people through the post 
office at the parties. Local, regional and national attention for 
the post office. 
Mail 
rates. People here don't mind, they get service. (340) 
Everybody knows the postmaster (as he's waving at passing cars). 
How Pinelands Commission got the house they use as their 
office. State bought the house and was going to use it as a 
"prison," a home for troubled teenage boys. Township objected. 
Took 
it 
to court. Through Darlington and "people like that" and 
courts, the Pinelands Commission got it. People don't mind having 
the Pinelands Commission around, especially compared to what 
could have been there. 
If they had moved 
in "cold," there 
could've been a comment or two. Detention centers and homes moved 
to this part of county. Land values go down. (438) 
House with stone sides across street from post office. The 
stone facade was blown on with machines. 
Dirt roads, permanent and temporary homes. Some reasonably 
nice. Semi—permanent residents. 
Holly and yew planted around post office. He cuts the grass. 
Doesn't have to do 
it but wants to. Changes in post office, used 
to be open from 8 A.M. to 7:30 or 8 P. M., sometimes 7 days a 
week. People could get their mail out 
of their boxes at 8 or 9 
at night. People wanted boxes, waiting list. Post office was 
cute, easy parking, no traffic. (537) People wanted same services 
elsewhere, "you let that guy 
in the woods stay open." 
Samuelson--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 17 
He does inspections, 
lobby, service, attitude. Quiz 
employees, Many don't know what express mail 
is. He gets a 
commendation and nothing happens. People assume this 
is the only 
post office he ever worked in. Treat customers nice, they'll fall 
all 
over you. They'll help. One guy helped fix his car. 
(595) 
Young men signing up for the draft. Problems with their 
girlfriends when they come into the post office to sign up. Doyle 
tries to make it easy for the boys. 
People take things from granted. Deal with them 2 or 3 times 
a day. 
He also has a health food shop. Daughters' 
involvement in 
it. One manages the store. 
Christmas party. rewards, problems. (676) Done a lot of 
good, proud of 
it. Orphans, young kids, older people from homes. 
This 
is 
it, the only thing they have all 
year. Refuses to charge 
for it. Postmaster general, regional officials. Reporters didn't 
want the bigwigs but Doyle, the one who was doing it. Never see 
anything done to the post office because all 
the kids like him. 
People don't want him to retire. 
(749) People tell him he's 
like their father.

(54) He 
likes the smell of new wood. This is fir. Deep, so 
it 
won't freeze. Well, 42 feet to water. 
Native American holly, wild. Doesn't do too well, 
last year 
had no berries, some years the blossoms freeze. Birds eat 
berries. Maybe a flock of robins

if you bring it 
into the 
house. 
White pine seedling. Jersey bull 
pine, native. Short needle

dead. Teaberries, Mrs. Zimmer likes the leaves, "get a bigger 
mouthful." Doesn't know much about mushrooms. Native white cedar. 
Always comes back with an armful of kindling. Laurel, a branch 
that the fire destroyed. Some were huge. People collect sphagnum 
for florists, rob 
it. Can't blame them (the collectors), they 
Samuelson--$3 Audiocassette logs

have to do something. 
Partridge in swamp. When things get rough they eat 
(tea?)berries. Sour gum or black gum trees. Sassafras. (531) Eat

into area and birds 
brought it here. Milkweed and milk pods. Rose hips also 
brought 
into area by conservation officers and has taken over. Multi— 
flora rose. How they threw seeds along the roads. She thinks 
that's not fair and a conservation officer friend said, "The 
farmers and the agricultural agents do their thing, and we do our 
thing, and you're doing your thing." 
Verburnum buckwoody (She later calls it buckwoody 
verburnum.), part of snowball family. Nice in an arrangement, dye 
it (yellow, orange, red) with Rit dye (not clear whether she's 
referring to goldenrod or verburnum). (97--second round on 
counter) Indian pipes, have them in August and September. Don't 
last very long. Sweet fern.

Christmas trees?). Planted too close together, looks like the 
Black Forest. Mrs. Z: 
"I 
like when somebody tells her (her sister
