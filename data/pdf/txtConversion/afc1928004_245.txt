The Song of the Flags. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, at the Opera House.. 
And by JENNY HuouEs, at the Metropolitan Theatre. 
'HERE'S a 
nation of brave people held in 
bond against their will, 
But to them will come a 
day of liberty, 
When to the world they can proclaim their 
little Emerald Isle, 
As added to the nations of the free, 
Our sympathies are with them for Americans 
believe, 
That the laws of God and mau have been pro-
faned, 
When the governed have to suffer and are held 
in cruel bonds, 
By laws against their interest maintained. 
(Irish Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, a 
flag of liberty, 
All friends of Erin Dow do drink a 
ruby toast 
to thee. 
There's a nation of brave people from the 
storied river Rhine, 
Whose emigrants are welcome to our land, 
They are law-abiding citizens, the very last in 
8 
And in peace the first to give a 
friendly hand, 
Of Europe's tivilization they are the greatest 
nation, 
I 
hope a 
Republic they'll soon be, 
For they're people that we love, and will like 
to see them free, 
As those in this great land of liberty. 
(German Flag) 
Then here's the 
flag 
at Germany, floating 
proudly free, 
May `• Re Wache am Rhein." be one day sung, 
in the Halls of Liberty. 
There's a 
band of noble patriots by Spanish 
tyrants ruled, 
Who are fighting to gain their liberty, soon 
with victory they'll lie crowned. 
For they've many honest friends in America. 
- 
the home of the free, 
Our flag has been insulted, and we'll show these 
Spanish dons, 
That the time has now arrived we're not afraid, 
The Virginius and her crew we'll speedily 
avenge, 
And to poor suffering Cuba lend our aid. 
Otthan Flag.) 
L'Ilien here's the tla• 
f 
Cuba, so very dear you 
are. 
9 
May soon in freedom proudly float, the flag of 
a 
single star. 
There's a 
conntry of brave people, 
Who stand head upon the list. 
or any throughout this mighty world, 
She's a 
refuge for the oppressed, 
From every other land. 
And for freedom her banner is unfurled, 
Our centennlal anniversary, we shortly hope to 
write, 
Upon the immortal scroll of fame, 
In memory of the blessings bequeathed by 
Washington, 
Then for ever revered be his name. 
(American Flag.) 
Tlien here's the flag of America, the flag of 
Washington, 
The greatest flag throughout the world, that 
e'er the sun shone on.

The Jolly Miller; or, 
As 1V4co9ne as the Flower' in May. 
LIVE at the mill, at the foot of the hill, 
Where the stream runs rippling by; 
For ten miles round, there cannot be found, 
A 
merrier fellow than I: 
For I 
laugh and I 
sing, and I 
drive away care, 
I've enough for my wants, and a 
little to 
spare; 
If a 
poor old friend should pass my way. 
I 
make him as welcome as the flowers in May.

For I

drive away care, 
I've enough for my wants, and a 
little to

If a 
poor old friend should pass my way, 
- I 
make him as welcome as the flowers in May. 
The jolly old mill, it stands there still. 
As it did in my father's time, 
Who often used to sing to me, 
This little bit of rhyme; 
Remember, my boy, don't turn up your nose 
At poorer people in plainer clothes;

But think, hr the sake of your mind's repose, 
That weal h

For I 
laugh, etc. 
I 
never saw the pleasure yet 
Of dressing very loud: 
I 
think there's little good to get, 
By looking very proud— 
Or crossing over, when you meet 
A 
poor acquaintance in the street; 
I 
may be wrong, but then, you know, 
That's merely the style of the miller—just so, 
For I 
laugh, etc. 
I 
think it just as well to try 
To pay your tailor's bill; 
To pay a 
wrong or injury 
With good, instead of ill. 
In fact, I 
think it best to do 
As you'd see others do to yon; 
I 
may be wrong, but then, yo. , now, 
That's merely the style of the ro... er—just so.

Who'll Buy My Violets? 
e A 
DIES, dear ladies, and gentlemen, too, 
e4iFor one single moment pray listen—ah , 
do. 
To a 
wandering florist, with my little few 
Of sweet-scented beauties to sell unto you; 
I'm far, far away from my own native France, 
Where the gayest and fairest exquisitely dance, 
With garlands of flowers of various hues--
Will yon from my basket, will you please to 
choose ? 
CHORUS. 
q' my violets, roses, sweet-scented posies, 
All of them sparkliiig and dripping with dew:

Violets, roses, sweet-scented posies— 
Who'll buy my roses all sprinkling with dew ? 
Deserted, ah, me, not one single sou. 
Then. charming ladies. I 
ask of you. 
To look at my roses and lilies so fair. 
Like diamonds they sparkle and shine in your 
hair; 
13 
I 
have violets and roses, and pansies as well, 
The blue bells of Scotland, the Scottish blue 
bells, 
The shamrock so green; I have also sweet 
rose— 
Will you from my basket, will you -please to 
choose. 
Of my violets, .ize. 
Will you buy, if you please, if you please will 
you buy ? 
I've come a 
long way, my fortune to try, 
I've come from my France, my once sunny 
land— 
They make you look hAndsome, they make 
you look grand; 
I've some for your coats, I've some for your 
rooms, 
The odor is delicious and all in full bloom; 
If you will not buy them they will wither and 
die, 
And leave me to wonder and pitiful cry:—

Our Native Land is Green. 
ERE what yees call green horns, 
We're only just landed 
From the City of Dublin, 
Afar over the sea; 
Though to be called green, 
We will not stand it. 
Tho' foolish we look 
We know all your ways. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' our native land 'tis green, 
0,11, that's no reason why, 
That we should be called the same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want, nor starvation, 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see, 
For at home we had plenty, 
'Tis the truth that I 
tells yees, 
But we Ion 2ed for to see,

HOW COULD I

As sung by Miss K1TTY BROOKE. 
'NE evening I 
met a 
party gay, 
A beau so charming fair, 
Such a 
Bowing mustache he did display, 
And raven locks of hair ; 
So noble, line, he danced divine. 
His partner me did choose, 
With such a 
glance asked me to dance, 
Now how could I 
refuse? 
CHORUS. 
4)f love at first sight I 
have heard. 
And often too we see, 
Although it might seem quite absurd, 
It was the case with me; 
For I 
felt love's power in my heart, 
It was no idle ruse. 
For such a 
winning bean to have, 
.N‘v how could I.refuse? 
In a 
garden a 
quiet stroll we took.

Oh, 1'11 ne'er forget his pleading look, 
So modest, graceful too 
Forget! by Jove ! my early love, 
Said he, it is no use 
So hear me pray: what could I 
say, 
Now how could I. refuse ? 
Of love at first 's42,1it, etc,

The Boston Fire. 
Song uni Chorus, 
Written by JOE A. 
Gruen. Arrarged by T. VAX. 
Alup:c to be had 
BErlo. 
of BALMER at WEBER, St. LOOI
F, 
Price, 3Ce. 
cjgT was only in the month of last November, 
tft 
That we heard the news we ever shall 
remember, 
That the Fire King had cast his burning ember 
O'er another fated city in our land; 
As the woful tidings flashed along the wire, 
At the terrible catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston's beauteohs city was on lire, 
And was sinking ' neath the fiend's relentlese, 
hand. 
CHORUS. 
Fire! lire! was Leard the ciy, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world beav'd one great sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish pray'd, 
Fervent pray'r to .heav'n for aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laidiFair Boston's fated 
city. 
And all thro' the terrible commotion, 
The wir.d blew a 
Kale from off the ocean, 
28 
Tho the brave firemen toiled with all devotion, 
To laugh at the efforts yet it seem'd; 
And soared with its fiery tongue still higher, 
O'er chimney-top, steeple and spire, 
Till all was one vast wave of fire, 
As the light round the, horizon gleamed. 
Fire! fire was heard the cry, etc. 
But who saves a 
city in her panic, 
From the rule of the Fire King so tyrannic, 
But the brave-hearted fireman and mechanic, 
The best and t!.e noblest in the land. 
Far brighter than the soldier's record. gory 
Are the names of those who live in song and 
story, 
Who restore a 
city to her former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
For soon will no trace remain, 
Of all this sea of flame, 
For Boston will rise again, remember ! 
Like Chicago from the ground, 
And brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town, before the next 
November,

(This swig has been called for nigiJiy for months 
In succession, having been sung by Mr. PASTOR in Ilia

No fun in that I

For when I

The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes, 
you may talk about yout 
Broadway belles, your Fifth Avenue swells, 
your exquisitely-dressed creatures, with their 
lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what 
do they know about enjoyment.? 
They are 
afraid to go in for a 
little fun for tear of disar-
ranging their toilets: and then what w( aid Mrs. 
Grundy say ? " Charles Frederick Augustus is 
getting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina Emelia is 
positively shocking!" 
But here hi the Bowery 
people enjoy themselves just when they feel like 
it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful gir's with bright eyes and ( lark 
'In the Bowery, in tile Bowery, 
That's where 
reside when Fin home, 
No butterflies of fashion there. 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearts and hands. 
With honest labor browned: 
Lai 
31 
Men who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks, 
But earn the cash they spend, 
Spoken. — Yes, there is no place in tae Bow-
ery for those well-dressed corner statues to try 
to look like 
millionaire's sons. while their 
mothers are out scrubbing for a 
itoliar a 
day to 
support them in idleness. 
A feilow na,s no 
business on the east side of town unless he 
wants to work and earn his own living. 
What 
fortune is there more honorable tam] that of a 
working man. 
There was Washington, he was 
a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
Printer . Warren a 
doc-
tor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lincoln 
a 
rail-splitter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you 
want to see men who make our country great, 
who add to her wealth, develop her resources, 
maintain her strengtii and prosperity, you will 
always find them— 
In the Bowery. &c. 
32 
The other day a 
well-dressed top, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom be chanced to meet 
A 
youn ,- mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said, 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on hlm put a 
head. . 
Spoken.—Ye, In laid the cowurdly rascal 
out. " Now," he says, " git up and git, and 
if ever I 
catch you insulting a 
female again I'll 
add a 
Fren,li roof to that head I've put on you. 
The dandy quietly sneaked away: the young 
lady turned to her preserver, with tears in her 
eyes, and said; 
My dear sir, how can I 
ever 
thank you for the kindness which you have 
shown me in protecting me from the insults of

rhen dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'er spread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys 
Spoken.—When the call came for soldiers in 
the hour of danger, the Bowery was the first to 
send its voluntecrs, and nobly did they do their 
duty. 
Who does not remember that incident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy 
charged in full force, one brave regiment brave-
ly stood its ground, under a 
terrific fire and 
changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of

Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world

Love is certain to be known, where a

When one has the first attack it's like raspberry

CRIME. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
'VE been thinking of late, I've been think 
n . 
mg, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries Old Uncle Sam, it's a "poser," 
There's something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
/m sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
0Air banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mluldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
guarded by night and by day; 
Ve Vie you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
33 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, slr, 
- 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole 
While the poor man, with 
may rot, sir, 
And still you wonuer at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting ft poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling. 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still, you wonder at crime. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send fc,r them to get brea ,l; 
39 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir. 
Sila sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll n',A'er more wonder at crime.

It's Funny when you Feel that Way. 
SIIA'N'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
IIer lovely hand W.ts hi it as I 
danced with her so 
gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when 
you feel that way. 
CHORUS. 
I 
felt as tho' Pd tumbled into honey, and some 
one had left me all their money, 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny 
when you feel that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her 
side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and fined her glass with 
pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me 
with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers,

I 
felt as thougi

We met again one afternoon, and as we were 
alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd 
be my own; 
3• 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if 
I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room,. it's funny 
when you feel that way. 
I 
felt as though, & c. 
The old man said we might wed and so he crown-
ed our bliss, 
And I 
shar_ be a 
married man in about a 
month 
from this, 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would 
never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, 
it's funny 
when you feel that way. 
I

THE KISS BE hI ND THE DOOR. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn; 
But now clean through my heart, 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole in it

CHORUS. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the 
kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeeze my darling's little 
finger 
any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until 
t's 
rather sore,

I'm sure no other maid 
Would equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck;

Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
Tie's a 
disagreeable tanner 
And he's ofte:. promised faithfully. 
He'd dislocate my neck.

where's Rosanna gone? 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his 
baeca,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot; 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
rL:e I'd jump over the garden wa 
As tho* I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never, km. 
\ 
I'd jurnpid over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
44 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her Dad, the tanner, 
Oh my teeth they rattled like dominoes 
And my legs doubled up with fear.

14P) Your promises all would you break; 
Do you think it is kind thus to grieve me, 
When you know I

don't ask yon to live upon pottage, 
Or anything. mean, ' pon my word. 
.7ENNIE. 
The idea of love in a 
cottage 
Is decidedly very absurd. 
TONY. 
There's some soldiers away in the village doge 
by, 
I'll go and enlist; in the wars I 
will die 
Like a 
warrior bold, and the story you'll hear 
That your Tony he died like a 
brave cataiisr.

So make up your mind, Miss, as so 
as you 
can. 
And take me for better for worse, " I'm the 
man." 
To render you happy as happy can be, 
If not to the wars, I'll co over the sea. 
TONY. 
JENNIE. 
Yes, march, march, for one and a 
penny a 
day. 
Don't talk of marriage, 
JENNIE. 
Unless in a 
carriage. 
March, 
march, come right about, face this 
To church you can take me and make me your 
way; 
wife. 
After you face, 
You have not a 
shilling. 
Right about lace, 
on; oft, and away. 
TONY. 
49 
TONY. 
Why not? 
JENNIE. 
Because you must march, march, come right 
about, face this way. 
Then wretched I 
he all the days of my life, 
My sorrows I'll bury 
Become military, 
Enlist for a 
soldier, and off to the wank 
JENNIE. 
Make haste— be going, 
Your valor be showing; 
But you'll never do so. 
TONY. 
Good-bye, Jennie, lear, I'm off now in a 
crack, 
I'll go and be a 
warrior. 
You'll never see me back ? 
This is the last time you'll look upon Bill ; 
I 
go to fight the foe and fight against my 
will. 
JENNIE. 
Don't be BO provoking I 
was only joking 
Then it's very cruel, for with grief I'm tem 
choking. 
You mean to wed with me, then 
How happy I 
shall be, then: 
I'll never be a 
soldier if you'll marry me; 
Oh, I'll stay at home, I 
never will roam. 
JENNIE . 
'Twould be very wrong if you to do so. 
TONY . 
I 
might stick on an island, 
And never see dry land, 
Like a 
second young Robinson Crime. 
JENNIE. 
Never mind Robinson Crasoe. 
TONY . 
No, because I 
love you so. 
You shall be my man Friday, 
And keep my house tidy;

pretty girl

smile so sweet, and a 
step just like a

We courted long my love was strong, how I

sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, I 
took her otd

How quick time flies when love and sighs, asv 
with the hours gliding;

A 
fival was my only fear, and I 
couldn't think to 
save me, 
That when I 
asked her who he was, a smile was 
all she gave me. 
Yet she was fair, & c. 
At last a 
note I 
got one day, and dreadful news it 
carried, 
Inviting me to come and see herself and rival 
marrigd, 
Now off I 
went, on iheath was bent, resolved Clat 
none should save me, 
But I 
am not dead though she got wed, and a 
smile was all she gave me.

Oh! how I 
love her, none can tell, 
My 
little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
8till by my side did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
CHOlib 
May heaven protect me for her sake, 
I 
pray both night and day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
I 
oft- times think of the running brook, 
4.nd my little Maggie May.

THE GRECIAN BEND. 
AS SUNG BY THE GREAT UNGAR% 
OOD evening to you, one and all; 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dressed in this quiet fashion: 
Prey. do not think me rude. 
I 
always study Le Follet, 
The fashion to amend ; 
So, I 
introduce you, ladies, too, 
This graceful Grecian Bend. 
Cnonus—The Grecian Bend, as I 
now show, 
You must admit is all the go ; 
The head well forward, and the body you' 
extend, 
To be perfect in the Grecian Bend. 
'Twas raining hard, the other day : 
So I 
got into a 
stage. 
Some little boys began to shout, 
Which put me in a 
rage. 
The driver, too, said : Really, Miss, 
You've room enough for ten ! 
And actually charged me double, 
On account of my Grecian Bend. 
SPOKEN—I wouldn't mind it so much, 
only there was Ann Jenkins, who lives next 
door to me, in the seine stage; she began to 
laugh at me; she's been practicing the Gre-
cian Bend for three weeks, but she can't do 
It; she's jealous of me, because I 
took her 
young man away. 
One gent had the auda-
tity to tell me that the Grecian Bend was 
ilothing more or less than a spasmodic 
movement of the third rib in connection 
with the left shoulder. 
In fact I 
need not 
tell you that—

Thinking of the weather, 
I

pair of roguish eyes, 
'Neath a 
hat and feather; 
She looked at me, 1 ; aeked at her, 
It made my heart pit pat, 
Then turning round she said to me, 
"how do you like my hat ?"

Oh! I 
said it's gay and pretty, too, 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat 
With a 
rooster's feather. 
*Km wore a 
handsome broadcloth basque, 
Cut the latest fashion, 
And flounces all round her dress, 
Made her look quite dashing; 
Her high-heeled boots as she walked on 
The pavement went pit pat, 
I'll ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jockey hat. 
Oh ! I 
said it's gay, du 
She kissed her hand and said " Au revolt,*

Before I'd time to say " Good bye,"

' gone round, 
The Shamrock is by law forbid to grow

For there's a 
bloody law against the wearing 
of the green.

met with Nepper Dandy, he took me by the. 
hand, 
He asked me how old Irelanet was, and how 
did it stand. 
It's the most distressed country that ever yet 
was seen, 
For they're hanging men and women, for the 
wearing of the green. 
Then if the color we must wear, by England's 
cruel red, 
Let it remind us of all the blood that Ireland 
has shed. 
Then pluck the Shamrock from your hat, and 
throw it on the sod, 
For never fear it will grow there, though un. 
der foot it's tord. 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from 
growing as they grow, 
When the flowers of the summer time their 
colors do not show: 
Then I 
will change the colors I 
wore in my ca-
been, 
ut until that day, please God, 
I'll stick 
a-wearing of the green.

THE CAPTAIN AND HIS WHISKERS.

S 
they marched through the town with 
their banners so gay, 
1 
ran to the window to hear the band play; - 
I 
peeped through the blinds very cautiously 
then, 
Lest the neighbors should say I 
was looking at 
the men.

I 
heard the drums beat, and the MUSIC 50 
sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much greater 
treat, 
The troop was the finest that I 
ever did see, 
And the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly 
glance at me. 
When we met at the ball I 
of course thought it 
right 
To pretend that we never had met till that 
night 
But he knew me at once I 
perceived by hit 
glance, 
And I 
hung down my head when he asked rue 
to clance;; 
87 
86 
Oh! he sat by my side at the end of the set, 
And the sweet words he said I 
never shall 
forget; 
My heart was enlisted and could not get free, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly 
glance at me. 
But he marched from the town and I 
saw him 
no more, 
Yet I 
think of him still .and the whiskers he 
wore ; 
I 
dream all the night, and I 
talk all the day 
Of the love of a 
Captain who has gone far away; 
I 
remember with superabundant delight 
When we met in the street and we danced all 
the night; 
And 1 
keep in my mind how my heart jumped 
with glee, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly 
glance at me.

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET, 
WHICH HUNG IN THE WELL. 
gtow dear to this heart are the scenes of 
my childhood, 
When fond recollection recalls them to view 
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled 
wildwood, 
And every loved spot which my infancy 
knew; 
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill which 
stood by it, , 
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract 
fell, 
The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it 
The old oaken bucket—the iron-bound bucket 
The moss-covered bucket, which hung in the 
well. 
That moss-covered vessel I 
hail as a 
treasure, 
For, often, at noon, when return'd from the 
field, 
1 
found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, 
The purest and sweetest that nature can 
yiled; 
llow ardent I 
seized it, with bands that were 
glowing. 
111 
And. quick to the white-pebbled bottom , h 
fell, 
; 
Then soon, with the emblem of truth oven 
flowing. 
And dripping with ocoolness, it rose from the 
well— 
The old oaken bucket—the iron-bound bucket, 
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well 
how sweet from the green mossy brim to reo 
ceive it, 
As poised on the cord, it inclined to my lipci 
Not a 
full-blushing goblet could tempt me to 
leave it, 
Though filled with the nectar that Jupitel 
sips. 
And now far removed from the loved situation, 
The tear of regret will intrusively swell, 
As fancy revisits my father's plantation. 
And sighs for the bucket which nangs in his 
well— 
The old oaken bucket—the iron-bound bucket, 
The moss-covered bucket which hangs in hit 
well.

When You and I

p
wandered to- day to the hill, Maggie, 
To watch the scenes below; . 
The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie, 
As we used to, long ago. 
The green grove has gone from the hill, Maggie 
Where first the daises sprung; 
The creaking old mill is still, Maggie, - 
Since you and I 
were young. 
Chorus. 
And now we are aged and grey, Maggie, 
And the trials of life nearly done; 
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young. 
A. city so silent and lone, Maggie, 
Where the young, and the gay, and the best, 
In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie, 
Have each found a 
place of rest. 
Is built where tile birds used to play, Maggie, 
And join in the songs that were sung, 
For, we sang as gay as they, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young.

They say I 
am feeble with age, Maggie, 
My steps are less sprightly than then 
My face is a 
well written page, :Maggie, 
But Time alone was the pen. 
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie, 
As sprays by the wild breakers flung; 
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young. 
Chorus. 
AS SUNG BY E. J. MURRAY. 
,ut in this cold world, out in the street, 
..Asking a 
penny of each one I 
meet, 
Shoeless I 
wander about thro' the day. 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
No one to help me, no one to love, 
No one to pity me, none to caress, 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
A 
child of misfortune, I'm driven from home, 
CHORUS. 
No one to help me, no one to bless; 
No one to pity me, none to caress, 
Fatherless, motherless. sadly I 
roam, 
Nursed by my proverty, driven from home. 
The flowers that bloomed that I 
loved to see, 
seem bowing their heads as if pitying me, - 
The music th it mingles with voices ofmirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and 
poor, 
And I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock on the door, 
Turn a 
deaf ear, there's no one will come, 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from home. 
()11, where shall I 
go or what can I 
do, 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue, 
m weary and footsore, I'm hungry and weak, 
I 
know not what shelter to-night I 
may seek, 
The Friend of all friends who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me, 
wander about till his messenger comes, 
To lead me to father and mother at home.

Read what a 
Leading Journal says of it: 
An ingenious little book of the thauma-
tingle order has been sent us, called "HUMPTY 
DOMPTY," and bound in such a 
way as to give 
opportunity for a 
decided puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
Child's picture book, gayly printed and col-
ored, it is so bound that a 
practised manipu-
lator taking it up and flirting the leaves rap-
idly over, can make it appear to be filled with 
copies of only one picture, or with blank pages 
or with any one of quite a 
succession of fig-
Mos. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly 
ii-Jribed, appears to contain nothing but por-
traits of Harlequin in his tesselated suit; the 
next, only Columbine; then, nothingbut Pan-
taloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistopheles. 
A 
little practice and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in 
the handling of it."—Philad. Evening Bulletin
