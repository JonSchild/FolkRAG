I GOT A PURTY GAL DOWN DE ROAD
I went, home to my supper last night, I looked in de winder; didn' see no light.
I went to de do' an' de do' was shut; I looked in de yard an' I looked in de lot.
Under de house an' all aroun', But my gal, Hannah, jes' couldn' be foun'.
I axed de neighbors to see if dey knowed, Dey said de las' time dey seed her she was
down de road.
I got a purty gal down de road, down de road, Purty gla down de road. She sees to my
washin' an' paid my boa'd, I got a purty gal downde road, Purty gal down de road, down de
road.
