DAYS OF FORTY - NINE from Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, John Lomax, 1931
We are gazing now on old Tom Moore,A relic of bygone days;'Tis a bummer, too, they call me
now,But what care I for praise?It's oft, says I, for the days gone by,It's oft do I repine,For the days of
old when we dug out the goldIn those days of Forty Nine.My comrades they all loved me well,The
jolly saucy crew;A few hard cases, I will admitThough they were brave and true.Whatever the pinch,
they ne'er would flinch,They never would fret nor whine,Like good old brick they stood the kicksIn
the days of Forty Nine.There's old 'Aunt Jess', that hard old cuss,Who never would repent;He never
missed a single meal,Nor never paid a cent.But old 'Aunt Jess', like all the rest,At death he did
resign,And in his bloom went up the flumeIn the days of Forty Nine.There is ragshag Jim, the roaring
man,Who could out-roar a buffalo, you bet.He roared all day and he roared all nightAnd I guess
he is roaring yet.One night Jim fell in a prospect hole, [md] It was a roaring bad design, [md] And
in that hlle Jim roared out his soulIn the days of Forty-Nine.There is Wylie Bill, the funny man,Who
was full of funny tricks,And when he was in a poker gameHe was always hard as bricks.He would
ante you a stud, he would play you a [ [?]?] (drawHe'd go you a hatful blind, [md] In a struggle with
death Bill lost his breathIn the days of Forty-Nine.There was New York Jake, the butcher boy,Who
was fond of getting tight.And every time he got on a spreeHe was spoiling for a fight.One night Jake
rampaged against aknifeIn the hands of old Bob Sine,And over Jake they held a wakeIn the days
of Forty-Nine.There was Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forgetThe luck he always had,He would [eal?] for you
both day and nightOr as long as he had a scad.It was a pistol shot that lay Pete out,It was his last
resign,And it caught Pete dead sure in the doorIn the days of Forty-Nine.Of all the comrades that
I've hadThere's none that's left to boast,And I am left alone in my miseryLike some poor wandering
ghost.And as I pass from town to town,They call me the rampbling sign,Since the days of old and the
days of gold,And the days of Forty-Nine. 1 1 of 2

The Days of Forty-Nine"Oh, here you see old Tome Moore, a relic of by-gone days,And a bummer,

who loved me well, a jovial, saucy crew.There were some hard nuts I must confess,But still they were
brave and true,Who'd never flinch, whate'er the pinch,Would never fret nor whine[,?]But like good old
bricks, they stood the kicks,In the days of forty-nine.There was Kentuck Bill, I knew him well,A fellow
so full of tricks,At a poker game he was always there,And as heavy, too,as bricks[:?]He'd play and
draw, he'd ante a slugAnd go a hatful blind[,?]But in a game with death, poor BillLost his breath, in
the days of forty-nine.There was Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget,For the luck he always had,He'd deal for
you both night and day,Or as long as you had a scad.One night a pistol laid him out,'Twas his last 'lay
out,' in fineIt caught Pete sure, right dead in the door,In the days of forty-nine.There was New York
Jake, a butcher-boy, soFond of getting tightAnd whenever Jake got on a spree heWas spoiling for a
fight,One day he ran ag'in a knife in theHands of Old Bob Cline[,?]So over Jake we held a wake,In the
days of forty-nine. 2 2 of 2

There was Hackensack Jim, who could out-roarA buffalo bull, you bet,He roared all day and he roared
all night,And I guess he's roaring yet.One night he fell in a prospect hole [md] 'Twas a roaring bad
design,For in that hole Jim roared out his soul,In the days of forty-nine.There was poor lame Jess, a
hard old Case,Who never would repent,Jess never missed a single meal,And he never paid a cent:But
poor old Jess, like all the rest,Did to death at last resign.For in his bloom he went up the flume,In the
days of forty-nine."

"The Days of Forty-Nine""We have-worked out our claims, we have spent our gold,Our barks are
astrand on the bars;We are battered and old, yet at night we beholdOutcroppings of gold in the
stars.And though few and old, our hearts are bold;Yet oft do we repineFor the days of old,For the
days of gold [md] For the days of Forty-Nine.Chorus:And though few and old, our hearts are bold,
etc."Where the rabbits play, where the quail all dayPipes on, on the chapparal hill, [chaparral?] A
few more days, and the last of us laysHis pick aside, and is stillThough battered and old, our hearts
are bold;Yet oft do we repineFor the days of old,For the days of gold [md] For the days of Forty-
Nine.Chorus: [md] And though battered and old, our hearts are bold, etc.

The Days of 'Forty-NineFresh laurel [md] wreaths we bring to-day,To crown the Patriarch,Whose
hand unlocked the golden oreIn gulch and canon dark.Old Pioneer, thy name we stillIn all our
hearts enshrine;God's blessing rest upon thy head,Dear friend [of?] old lang syne!Chorus: [md] Oh,
cherished by forevermoreThe days of old lang syne;Those golden days, remembered daysThe days
of 'Forty-Nine!Hillside, ravine and tule marshNow blossom as the rose,And round Diablo's verdant
baseThe crystal steamlet flows.Now glory be to God on high[,?]Let this our [pacan?] be,And peace on
earth, good will to men[,?]Our prayer, O God, to thee! 1 1 of 2
