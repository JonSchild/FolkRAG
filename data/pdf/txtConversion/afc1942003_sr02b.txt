"Dear Mr. President", Bloomington, Indiana, January 8, 1942
AFS 6399B
Dorothy Duggdale: I am Dorothy Duggdale of the Bloomington office of the United States
Employment Service. Our office has been busy with the recruiting of labors in the war industries
for more than a year, particularly in finding workers for the Naval Ammunition Storage Depot at
Burn City and the Charleston Powder plant at Charleston, Indiana. We are making every effort to
take care of the workers displaced because of the priorities in materials and to transfer or upgrade
persons now employed whenever such changes will make for greater service to our country. Since
Bloomington is in the heart of the world's greatest limestone area and since the war has brought
about a decrease in building, we are busy transferring these workers to the warring industries. We
are trying to do this with speed and understanding both as a matter of war effort and local morale.
