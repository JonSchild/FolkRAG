Down in Nigger Alley, 
Oh, -.
Number 44; 
Stands an occupied empty house, 
With Diddimus on the door; 
There is going to be a 
party, 
You bet we'll be the figures; 
A 
107 wenches, dance with 
42 white niggers. 
C 
HORUS: 
The Coons will play the banjo, 
Sing, dance like Irish McCarthy; 
12 sponge cakes will be raffled off, 
At Mrs. Diddmus' Party. 
Tommy Granger and Frank Lum., 
Dick Parker and Joe Lang; 
Will do an Irish stovepipe song, 
Introducing Chinese slang; 
There'll be a 
prize, 4 
silver doughnuts. 
For songs learned off by heart; 
Hurrah for Mrs. Diddimus, 
I'm sure I've won her heart, 
Sung with great success by ScnooLeaArr & COES. 
Come by telegraph from New Orleans, 
I 
am Wm. Henry Pork and Beans, 
I 
was raised and imported here by steam; 
I 
am old enough to vote, 
My grandfather was a 
goat, 
Stop your fooling, or I 
kick you in the shins. 
CHORUS: 
I 
am working now in a 
three cent hash factory, 
From the butter I 
am chasing fleas; 
I 
have hard work, a 
skinning cream off water, 
And to shave the skippers off of cheese. 
I 
was married in a 
trunk, 
When I 
was foolish and I 
was drunk, 
I 
was working in a 
drug store blasting rocks; 
My family they all live in jail, 
I 
am only out on bail, 
I 
was serving seven years for stealing a 
pair 
of socks. 
UNFORTUNATE COONS. 
Written by LUKE SCHOOLCRAFT, and sung with great success at 
HARRY MINER'S THEATRE. 
Ten little Niggers sat on a 
bottle of wine, 
One got killed and then there was nine; 
Nine little Coons looking for a 
date, 
One catched on, and then there was eight; 
Eight little Niggers trying to go to Heaven, 
One had a 
ticket, and then there was seven; 
Seven little Niggers playing with bricks, 
One got stabbed, and it just left six; 
Six little Niggers robbing a 
bee- hive, 
One got stung to death, and left only five. 
Five little Niggers hanging on a 
door, 
One fell off, and left only four; 
Four litile Niggers standing on a 
tree, 
One fell off, and left only three; 
Three little Niggers tried to kill a 
Jew, 
One got arrested and left only two. 
Two little Niggers sleeping in a 
gun, 
One got shot, and then there vas one; 
One little Nigger sat eating pie, 
The whole ten are living, it's only a 
lie.

THE 2 
LA-DE-DAHS. 
Written by GEO. H. 
COES. 
Sung with great success. 
-: 
0 : - 
We are two la-de-dahs, 
We carry Walking Sticks; 
We wear false Moustaches, 
And live on Tooth-picks; 
Our clothes are second-handed, 
To pay our board we are not able; 
We eat one meal, and that's on Christmas, 
And sleep in the stable. 
CHORUS: 
We are the two la-de-dahs, 
We're mashers of a 
Bank; 
I 
am Book-keeper on a 
Fish-stand, 
He is a 
Brick- layer in a 
Bank; 
The idol of the ladies, 
We drink nothing but wine; 
We're the Jumping-Jack Statutes, 
Dressed up so tine. 
Our people are Lords in Italy, 
We are as bill...tit-toned a they; 
Sent us a 
postal-card by telegraph. 
To eat rain and drink hay; 
Some call us the Cigarette Brothers, 
Tell us to go in swimming in Malt; 
They say we are fresh, not t( ,o 
fresh, but just 
fresh enough, 
To be preserved in a 
barre: of salt. 
(Chorus). 
TEMPERANCE.

:0:— 
Good-bye, ladies and men. I 
am glad I 
kept you wait-
ing for me to arrive, but I 
could not get here any slower. 
Now, temperance, like the orator, is no good—or, I 
mean, 
intemperance. 
There are flexible methods which con-
cerns this disease, yellow fever or dog— no, I 
am wrong. 
Now, drink is a 
thing no man should use—when he is 
broke. 
I'll show you an example: A man, a 
son of it 
woman, signed the pledge for twenty years, and broke it 
in nineteen years, three hundred and sixty-four days—one 
day more. 
He went in to a 
blacksmith shop to get a 
drink and got stabbed dead with a 
horse. [A 
parable. -I 
A Nigger woman slept with a 
bottle of whiskey, and it 
got hot in the middle of the night, and the whiskey 
eatebed tile and burned —. Well, for instance, 
take tlw pledge, or take a 
drink. 
This meeting will ad-
jawn till—not John till next Foursday, the 28th, when an 
.example will be present. 
No mashing, please. 
You 
want me? 
Yes! 
Well, I 
am married.

SADDLE ROCK OYSTER, 
Written by GEo. IL GOF.S, expressly for LI•KE Scnoor.crurr. 
I 
WAS as happy as a 
Saddle Rock oyster, 
What's made up in a 
stew, 
And as merry as quail on toast, 
The reason I 
will tell unto you— 
I'm a 
going to see my little Katrina, 
Mit her I 
am in love, 
She's as pretty as a 
big sunflower, 
And as fascinating as a 
turtle dove. 
We met, ' twas in the Bowery, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
The weather it was showery, 
So we stepped into a 
lager bier saloon; 
It was there we told our tales oi love, 
She said she would be mine, 
I 
was a 
happy little Dutchman th3n, 
As ever came from Bingen on the Rhine. 
You talk about your fascinating Dutchmen, 
Now 
-
just observe my style, 
Mit dis hand-me-down coat of mine, 
I 
wear dot all the while; 
De ladies dey are all in love mit in?, 
Whenever I 
go out, 
Dey wink and make dere eye dot way. 
My gracious, I 
don't know what Fin about. 
On Broadway I 
was walking 
The other afternoon, 
One pretty girl she passed me by— 
She vos lovely as the flowers in June, 
She wore a 
hat just three feet 
And two curls down her back dat long, 
She had buttons all over her dress, 
Just as big as a 
Chinese gong. 
BIG LONG JOHN, 
As sung by L. SCHOOLCRAFT. 
BIG long John was a 
Chinaman, 
And he lived in the land of the free, 
He peddled cigarettes on the upperland, 
Way out in Milwaukee. 
Ile could eat more hash than a 
free lunch cadet, 
And he never was late to his meals,' 
lie wore a 
long tail from the top of his head, 
Which hung way down to his heels, 
CHORUS. 
Ching, ching, chum, chow cling a 
ring a 
rue, 
'Jong John was a 
Chinaman, 
He is a 
barber by birth and a 
butcher by trade, 
I 
tell you he oil from the can. 
He went to San Francisco for a 
Chinee gal to see, 
Feeling tired, he laid down to rest 
Beneath the shade of a 
huckleberry tree, 
Ile feeling very warm soon feel asleep, 
And he laid his head on a 
plank, 
Along came an Indian with a 
big tomahawk, 
And chopped off a 
piece of his scalp. 
Ching, Ching, Chum, ktc. 
Now when he awoke he felt so bad, 
That he hollered with all his might, 
ra his hand to his head and it made him so sick, 
That he died that very same night. 
He Was found next day about 12 M. 
By the captain of a 
Hong Kong crew; 
lie wrote to his sweetheart, Chum Churn Fee, 
That be died from loss of his cue. 
'END- SONG; 
' 
AIR.--LJoe Bowers. 
As sung by L. ScirooLcnAvr. 
OLD Mother Proctor, she went to the doctor, 
To save the poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a 
wooing go, 
Was in the level ground laid, 
Johnny I 
hardly knew you, 
Since you joined the lunch brigade. 
(Repeat last four lines for Chorus., 
Snpposen now that I 
was you, 
And supposen you were me, 
.Supposen I 
was somebody else, 
I 
wonder whose brother you'd be. 
Oh! put me in my little bed, 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother croaked, 
And so is Captain Jinks. • 
! 
Mary had a 
black and tan, 
As white as Pittsburg snow, 
He'd stand on his head for a 
peck of bread, 
And whistle not for Joe. 
Old mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard, 
To draw a 
pail of water, 
When she got there the cupboard was bare, 
And so was the ratcatcher's daughter. 
AUNT gUSIE. 
As sung by L. SCHOOLCRAFT. 
OH! the bells did ring when massa went and died, 
Oh ! how'dy Aunt Susie, 
I 
golly how de darkies hollered and dey cried, 
Way down south in Georgia. 
Dey cried all day till their eyes were very red, 
011! yes go tell the people how'dy, 
ney cried so long it took all the wool of their heads, 
Way (low in de cotton land.

CHORUS. 
Oh ! my don't cry, there's a 
heap of trouble brewing all the 
iira 
And we'll have good times when we.go to join the band, 
‘

4.y down in the cotton land. 
Oh ! go way old Peter don't you bother me, 
Oh ! how'dy Aunt Susie, 
I 
look at de clouds to see what I 
could see, 
Way down south in Georgia, 
And I 
see black angels flying in de air, 
Oh 1 
yes, go tell de people how'dy, 
Dey got bumble bees a 
sticking in der hair, 
Way down in de cottOn land. 
Oh! my, don't cry, & c. 
I'll go to work with all my might and main 
Ohm! how'dy Aunt Susie, 
And I'll take my time for I 
know it's going to rain, 
Way down south in Georgia, 
That nigger, Pete, he's a 
brother to a 
hog 
Oh: yes, go tell de people how'dy, 
lie looks like a 
bull frog sitting on a 
log, 
Way down in the cotton land. 
Oh ! my, don't cry, ite. 
I'VE been walking around this big city, 
I'm so tired I 
scarcely can jog, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
When ever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order me out there and then, 
And say that I'm drunk and had my fill, 
And they've nicknamed me Old Snoozer Ben. 
Once I 
was in good circumstances, 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
lot all by taking the chances, 
And bad luck struck Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
I'm looking for some friends to come, 
It's provoking—I'm choking, 
I'm shaking for one glass of rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
But they never do so any more, 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
As they had many poor fools they meet, 
tlut now-a-days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I've noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and aint any dimes now, 
He's as bad off as Old Snoozer Ben, 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
In hopes that some old irk n 
I 
I'd meet, 
Only think now—One drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat. 
I 
feel that I'm fast growing weaker, 
If only I 
had just a 
drop, 
My poor wife, oh ! how can I 
seek her, 
Oh ! ram—rum, oh ! why can't I 
stop.. 
What figares are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and child, 
They are starving at home—oh! dear me, 
Give me Brandy or I 
shall go wild— 
But no, I 
must banish this madness, 
Aud try be a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladness, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must bear it—I 
swear it, 
No liquor for me e'er again, 
No shrinking— or drinking, 
So pattern froig.Z1 Snoozer Ben.

Grandmother Pratt's Wonderful Cat. 
Written by Billy Carter, and sang by him with great success. 
Old Grandmother Platt owned a 
fine Thomas cat, 
A 
beautiful sky-blue Maltese, 
And this wonderful cat often went on a 
bat, 
A 
tearing, high old jamboree. 
I'm going to show that this cat wasn't slow— 
He was ringboned in one of his eyes— 
One day he did go down to Stetson's cat show, 
And he drew out a 
golden first prize. 
This wonderful cat he was hairy and fat, 
One ear was chewed off in a 
row, 
And his nose was as flat as the crown of my hat, 
It hapyened I 
can't tell you how. 
He was heavy and strong, but his tail wasn't long, 
It was ate off all but a 
short stump, 
And I 
hope it ain't wrong for to tell in my song, 
On his back was a 
three-cornered hump. 
He could sing like a 
lark, every night after dark 
He would get onto my back-yard fence. 
My watch-dog would bark like a 
man eating shark, 
When this cat his sweet song would commence. 
In a 
moment the ground would be covered all round 
With cats from the neighboring streets, 
Not a 
cat could be found that dared utter a 
sound, 
But they'd quietly sit in their seats. 
About midnight one night he got into a 
fight— 
fie was fond of disturbing the peace— 
Through the dimness of sight of the eye on his right 
He fell into a 
pan of soap-grease. 
He squeled like the deuce, but it wasn't no use, 
lie couldn't get out of the pan, 
The grease held him fast, he died game to the last, 
As only a 
Thomas cat can.

THE MAID AND THE. MAGPIE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success in HARRIGAN c't HART'S 
New Play, " Mulligan Guards' Nominee," 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
0 :-------
Now once there was a 
maid kept an old magpie, 
And a 
parson who prayed lived very close by; 
When this maid met the parson they both stopped to talk, 
And often on the quiet go for a 
cosy walk; 
But her lover was a 
sailor who sailed across the main, 
And he promised she should be his wife when he returned 
again; 
Still she let this parson see her home from church. 
And kiss her, never thinking of the magpie on the perch. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie would talk all the day, 
The maid would believe all the magpie would say; 
She said I 
love the parson, don't you tell the tar, 
When the old magpie only said " guar! quar!" 
IN ow, whilst this sailor was away, so the story goes, 
This maid flirts with the parson, but, of course, nobody 
knows; 
Until she tells the magpie when talking one day, 
She'd rather have the parson now the sailor was away; 
But she said don't tell this secret, or I'll give you the birch 
Every night at nine, I 
meet the parson near the church; 
The magpie only guar, quar'd as he had done before, 
But he meant to tell the sailor boy when he returned on 
shore. 
(Chorus). 
21 
TIIE MAID AND THE MAGPIE.-CONTINUED, 
Whilst stationed at Gibraltar, this sailor, so it seems, 
When sleeping in his cosy bunk, he had some funny dreams; 
lie dreamt the girl he'd left behind on dear old England's 
shore, 
Would, whilst he was away, flirt with half a 
dozen more; 
So he made his passage homeward as quickly as could be, 
Landed safely at her house, but no maiden could he see; 
lie then talked to the magpie who was dancing on the perch, 
And the magpie told him all about the parson at the church. 
(Chorus). 
Now when the sailor met the maiden, he passed her with 
disdain, 
So she sued for breach of promise, tried five hundred to 
obtain; 
But he brought the magpie into court, which told the 
truthful tale, 
So to get what she required, this maiden did fail; 
She then went for the parson, but in vain for him did 
search, 
For he knew which way the wind blew, so he booked it 
from the church; 
The lawyers couldn't find him, so the case went on the 
shelf, 
And this tricky little maiden had to live by herself. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie ne'er talk all the day, 
Foi the jolly little sailor took the knowing bird away;

And now with all his shipmates, this rare good hearted tar, 
While the magpie tells the truthful tale, he sings " guar! 
guar!" 
Written by ARTHUR LLOYD. 
As Sung by NED BARRY at the THEATRE COMIQUE, N. 
Y. 
Perhaps you may have heard of Captain Ladidadidoo, 
Who for his Queen and Country all her enemies would 
slew; 
A 
British Soldier with a 
foe would fight till all was blue, 
And there's no exception, boys, in Captain Ladidadidoo. 
Orronus: 
Ladida, Ladidoo, fighting, slaughtering, my trade is, 
No doubt you all have heard of Captain Ladidadidoo; 
Ladida, Ladidoo, I'm the pet of all the ladies, 
The darlings love to flirt with Captain Ladidadidoo. 
)ur soldiers in their uniforms are splendid men to view, 
But it's not alone the look because we know what they 
can do; 
I 
think we should be proud of them, I 
do, indeed, don't 
you? 
And their Officers, of course, including Captain Ladida-
d doo. ( Chorus). 
If I 
could go to Zululand, I'll tell you what I'd do, 
I'd be revenged on those who our courageous soldiers 
slew; 
For with my gleaming sword I'd run each savage Zulu 
through, 
And make them all remember Captain Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus). 
The. 
ladies are so fond of Captain Ladidadidoo, 
That upon my word I'm puzzled which delightful one to 
woo; 
But whoever I 
select, to her I'm certain to be true, 
She'll be a 
lucky girl who catches Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus). 
I 
think you're glad to see me thus, you would be pleased 
I 
know, 
But I 
cannot stop much longer as I've somethiag else to do 
I 
mat- see you main and so I 
will not say adieu, 
So ta t:t, kind regards to all from Ladidadidoo. 
(Chorus).

The Poor Serio-Comic. 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Win. Carter, and sung by him with y 
ea 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," - You've children of your own, 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-coniic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street. 
she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay. 
Who tol d 
her she was charming and neat,

THE POOR SERIO-COMIC—Continued. 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more, 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if ybu can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with Wicks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
NoN., these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except arbses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enoufy: and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
man's 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back.

MY LAST FAREWELL. 
A Beautiful Ballad. 
Tritten expressly for Miss KATE M ONTROSE, by FRANK LAVARNIE, 
EN., and originally sung by her with tremendous success 
in all the leading Vaudeville Theatres in the country. 
'Tis strange, tho' I 
cannot forget, 
'Twas just one year ago; 
To better lands, tho' far away, 
My little pet did go. 
Tho' cherished with the fondest hopes, 
Her love I 
ne'er could tell: 
Until I 
left hcr one bright morn, 
It was my last farewell. 
CHORUS: 
Oh. yes, 'twas but a 
year ago, 
Her lovZ, I 
know it well; 
It seems to me but yesterday, 
I 
took my last farewell. 
She's left this world and gone above, 
With angels to rejoice; 
Where they will welcome her with love, 
On hearing her sweet voice: 
When e'er I 
pass that little cot, 
That stands beside the dell; 
I 
often think of days gone by, 
When I 
took my last farewell.

Where we parted and I 
whispered—.

You'll forget me not!"

We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: -

She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up--
A sweet forget-me-not!

At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes ! " 
And shortly we were wed. 
A

And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called—. 
sweet forget-me-not!

IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written and sung with great success by CHARLES H. 
DUNCAN. 
Published by GEO. D. 
NEWHALL, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 4o cents. 
There's a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could admire 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where everything's 
snug, 
Her furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
one evening at the window sat as her invited guest. 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud of 
Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.— It struck the girl bang in the eye, the old yellow 
Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize with her, 
when one of those young devils yelled— 
Johanna I,ou4a McGuire, 4:c, 
Johanna Louisa McGuire.

The Man that Knew the Actors. 
Written and sung by JOHN MCVEIGH. Dedicated to my friend 11Auftv 
McAvov. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to tell, 
And every one of you know him well; 
He's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best ; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys" silly 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of Mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine," 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards.

THE MAN THAT KNEW THE ACTORS. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends ; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, arid of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to-day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A 
Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: " Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Power'?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: " Ve're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street ; 
And now he knows no actor.

"Father, who travels the road so late?" 
"Hush, my child; 'tis the candidate.' 
Fit, example of human woes— 
Early be comes and late he goes; 
lie greets the women with courtly grace, 
Ile kisses the baby's dirty face, 
He calls to the fence the farmer at work, 
lie bores the merchant, he bores the clerk, 
The blacksmith, while his anvil rings, 
lie greets, and this is the song he sings: 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Aui! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
" 
Husband, who is that man at the gate?" 
"Hush, my love; ' tis the candidate." 
"Husband, why can't he work like you! 
Has he nothing at home to do?" 
My dear, whenever a 
man is down, 
No cash at home, no money in town, 
Too stupid to preach, too proud to beg, 
Too timid to rob, and too lazy to dig, 
Then over his horse his legs he flings, 
And to the dear people this song he sings:

" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
flow is you;' wife, and how are you? 
Ah! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
13rothers, who labor early and late, 
Ask these things of the candidate: 
What's his record? How does he stand 
At home? No matter about his hand, 
Be it hard or soft, so it be not prone 
To close over money not his own. 
Has he in view no thieving plan? 
Is he honest and capable?—he is our man. 
Cheer such a 
one till the welkin rings, 
Join in the chorus when thus he sings: 
"Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Aim! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman."

McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule. 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At. the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
lie broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule, 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School; 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass. 
Written by JAmEs Dia:w, and sung with great success by I)oNNELiS 
DREW, at Tony Pastor's Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Parody on Scotch Lassie Jean. 
I 
once knew a 
maiden who in New York did dwelt; 
She was ugly and cranky all the time; 
She was struck on a 
baker and a 
dizzy undertaker, 
And a 
butcher in Cincinnati over the Rhine; 
One night the butcher called with a 
couple of pork 
chops, 
11 is love he tried to explain; 
lie gave her a 
squeeze, and off came his nose, 
From the breath of this Scotch Terrier Jane. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, I've got you on the brain, 
You have no reason to explain; 
Your teeth they are false, from taking epsom salts, 
You're my liver- lip Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeal). 
She's lovely and fair, and her feet they were bare, 
Iler bustle it stuck out twenty feet; 
One day in the house she happened to eat a 
mouse, 
It gave all her lovers a 
treat; 
The butcher and the baker, and the dizzy undertaker, 
They went crazy when they all heard the news; 
I 
often heard them say, when she was put away, 
She died from hoisting Mott St. Booze. 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, my club-footed Jane, 
With tears I 
have cause to explain; 
You're a 
la isy that was lazy, your lips they were greasy, 
You're my sweet-scented Scotch Terrier Jane.

There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road. 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
etroitus: 
hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewash et I 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright Copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Sinoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for man3 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
it is the earnest wish I 
give to you. 
Written and sung by JOHN McVElint with great success. 
The Chinese in this country, 
Are getting awful thick; 
With long pig tails down back, 
Complexions like a 
brick; 
They cheat the poor washerwoman, 
Because they work for cheaper price; 
It doesn't cost them much to live, 
They eat onions, rats and mice. 
CHORUS: 
Hi, yi, ki, ching, chang, chang, 
When you get a 
Chinaman, kill him if you can; 
Kill him with a 
razor, stab him with a 
brick. 
Then you're sure to settle a 
Chinaman. 
They wear their shirts outside their pants, 
'Cause they're got no coats; 
They shave their hair all off in front, 
They look like Wm. Goat -
,; 
The men and womcn look alike, 
As all of you do know; 
They're a 
mixture of a 
bull dog, 
A 
wolf and kangaroo. 
(Chorus). 
May the man who brought them to this country, 
Be stung to death with flies; 
May mosquitos bore a 
hole through him, 
May boot-blacks bang his eyes; 
May Old Nick come after him some day, 
And take him down below ; 
May a 
pig tail grow on the end of his nose, 
By the Jerry, Jehosophat .Toe.

drop in for to make us gay, 
When a 
policeman nabbed me, and as he grabbed me, 
lie says, old man youv'e been led astray. 
With great vexation and botheration, 
Me to the station he then dragged along, 
With consternation and indignation, 
I 
was the sole attraction of all the throng, 
But I 
wasn't long getting to where the judge was sitting. 
And he looked c-
. _ r 
at me in a 
serious way, 
Yarn, says I 
don't mind me, but by gob he tined me, 
And says he old man, you have been led astray. 
Then with humiliation and botheration, 
To my habitation, I 
then took my way, 
And with great vexation as to what narration, 
Would drive the anger of my wife away, 
I 
met her standing upon the landing, 
And the broom a 
handling in a 
threatning way, 
With a 
profound ovation upon dissipation, 
Says I, stop it darling, you have been led astray 
Then I 
felt a 
pushing and I 
heard a 
rushing, 
And a 
great concussion like a 
heavy fall, 
Then madly stumbling and blindly tumbling, 
Bang! I 
went up against the wall. 
I 
looked all over for to discover, 
What tramp or loafer had been used that way, 
it soon was shown me, that down stairs she threw me, 
And I 
knew by gorra, I 
was led astray.

I 
wish my love and I 
was sailing, 
As far from land as far could be, 
Var, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me. 
CHORUS— 
Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am, slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, &e 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy, 
The reason I 
will tell to thee, 
Because when drinking, I 
am thinking. 
Does my true love remember me. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, &c.

I WOULD ask of you, my darling, a 
question soft and low, 
That gives me many a 
heart-ache as the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, but the truest love grows cold I 
t 
is this that I 
would ask you: will you love me when I'm old ? 
It is this that I 
would ask you: will you love me when I'm old ? 
CHORUS. 
Life's morn will soon be waning, and its ev'nings bells be toll'd; 
Life's morn will soon be waning, and its evinings bells be toll'd; 
But my heart will know no sadness, if you'll love me when I'm old. 
But my heart will know no sadness, if you'll love me when I'm old. 
Down the stream of time together we are sailing side by side, 
Hoping some bright day to anchor safe beyond the surging tide. 
To- day our sky is•cloudless, but the night may clouds unfold, 
And its storms may gather round us: will you love me when 
I'm old ? 
And its storms :nay gather round us: will you love me when 
I'm old ? 
Life's morn, etc. 
When my hair shall shame the snow-drift, and mine eyes shall 
dimmer grow, 
I 
would lean upon some loved one in tke valley as I 
go. 
I 
would claim of you a 
promise, worth to me a 
world of gold: 
It is only this, my darling, that you'll love me when I'm 
old ? 
It is only this, my darling, that you'll love me when I'm 
old?

Why Did My-Josie Go? 
Written by Wm. J. SCANLO, of SCANLON kNni. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my I 
wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to- morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
(Chorus.) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None In thisoluriLlike my own little Joe.

She was raised on corn and beans, 
Tell us what's her name, 
Rebecca Lawton don't like her, 
Tell us what's her name, 
With jealousy she dasn't stir, 
Tell us what's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why it's Mary Matil Ma Tibia,

Tell as what's her name, 
Her lips am like the morning dew, 
Tell us what's her name, 
She's got a 
bile upon her nose, 
Tell us what's her name, 
if ever it busts Lord help her clothes, 
Tell us what's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why it's Mary Matil Ma Tilda, 
Mary Matilda that's her name.

Sang nightly by W ILL. H. 
MORTON, with HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Combination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time. 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject I'll mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A 
r .an may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He struggles his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To such worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
g 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my srrg, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A 
man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how soon things may turn; 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return.

In martial array we see each day 
Our soldiers on parade, 
With music sweet and tramping feet, 
Bright uniforms arrayed. 
But I 
know a 
soldier fair, 
Who is handsome, brave and gay, 
The ladies faint with love's complaint 
When he gets in their way. 
CHORUS. 
Major Majolica, he is a 
rolllicker, 
Brave and handsome, dashing and gay, 
Ile is a 
stifler, and such a 
trifler, 
The major is mashing' the ladies all day.

When cannons go off he gives a 
laugh, 
Says, " Load ' ern and go it again !" 
When bullets are thick he always is (pick

And then goes to the rear.

Isaac and Moses. 
Written by DAVE H OWARD, and sung by HOWARD and THOMPSON 
nightly at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
We keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that come to us, 
He wanted to buy a 
coat; 
So help my Jimmy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
CHORUS. 
Isaac and Moses sells old clotheses, 
Down in Baxter street ; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say: 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two. 
He made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store; 
NVe pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
He brought in all his gang.

Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All 0.1e darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old ma.ssa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn field Sx. 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates,

r many would suppose them to be 
thusiastic Highlander ; the absence of

generally ascribed to the accomplished Author-
ys from Strathern." The music is original and very 
ere's many a 
man of the Cameron Clan 
That has followed his chief to the field, 
He has sworn to support him or die by his side, 
For a 
Cameron never can yield. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hear the Pibroch sounding, 
Sounding deep o'er the mountains and glens, 
While light springing footsteps are trampling the heath, 
'Tis the march- of the Cameron men. 
Oh, proudly they walk, but each Cameron knows, 
He may tread on the heather no more; 
But boldly he follows his Chief to the field, 
Where his laurels were gather'd before. 
I 
hear, &e. 
The moon has arisen, it shines on that path. 
Now trod by the gallant and true, 
High, high are their hopes, for their Chieftan has said, . 
That what ever men dare they can do.

DANOE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Let% 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childisk joys, 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say: 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
DANCE M E 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
• 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, Sz.
.c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never 'nave to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, arid heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee.

CABIN FLOOR. 
An original Song and Dance, sung by BARLOW BROTHERS it 
Harrigan & Hart's and Tony Pastor's Theatres. 
W HEN we were two little coons, 
On old Virginia shore, 
The old man showed us how to dance 
Upon the cabin floor; 
The steps he learned us how to take, 
We'll show them now to you, 
And this is how we done it, 
Before we wore a 
shoe. 
CHORUS. 
The old man learned us this rap, 
[Sm.] 
He made our toes fly flip- flap, [Spa.] 
Our education we did get: 
In happy days gone by, 
Old mother she would laugh at us, 
Until she'd almost cry ; 
wish those days would come again, 
Thosi happy days of yore, 
When first we learned how to dance, 
Upon the cabin floor. 
When we hear the music play, 
We like to get a 
dance, 
To knock the dust out of the cracks, 
Because we love to dance; 
And when we get so very old, 
That we can't dance no more, 
We hope our bones will get a 
rest, 
Beneath the cabin floor. 
The old man, etc. 
LOCK DAT LION'S JAW. 
As originally sung by Goss and Fox. 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw,

Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll get on Canaan's shore,

Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
Hold your light, Monday morning,

We'll hold old Jonah down,

We'll get home by and by,

We'll land on Canaan's shore,

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is thetold-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia, 
mends and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
aod K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under, 
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and yr 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courtin,: Cards.--This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means ot 
expressing one's sentiments in such s, way as to be non-
committal 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
ty, and beingan the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Charlotte Temple.—To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures, 
sympathized and wept with her in her aorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet's lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame." 
Handsomely bound, boards, 165 pages 
Price 30 Cents.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a leac simile of a Trick practiced by att 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordei, 
has been sent us, called HumPry DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet; quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or -
Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
