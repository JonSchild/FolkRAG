The ladies wave their little hands to see our grand array.

The drums and trumiiets play, and till us with delight; 
When we meet to march or fight, we take the lead—we do

BRUNO, by H. BIN:NETT, 
Oh ! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs ; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs ; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all Ile darkics sing awl crack their jokes , 
But if you want to burst yourself w

Watch de motion of glebe Indian I

We are doubl 2-breaste(1 Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh ! the boys were always jealous of these darkics, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around ; 
Oh ! we used to set do Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found ; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist ; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we clone our dortble-twkt, 
Were sure to make you; lc.

Still my meary will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of dc sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord lie praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
3 I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknops, toil and Forrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days, 
Performed by BILLY CHASE, of McKee A- Rogers' Gombination. 
OH, I 
once did love a 
yellow gal, 
And I 
thought that she loved me; 
She had coal- black eyes, her name was 'Lim, 
And none could sing like she. 
I 
courted her for seven years, 
But found it was no go, 
For she ran off with another nig, 
Called Alabama Joe. 
CHORUS. 
But in spite of that I 
often think about her, 
My heart, is sad since she has gone away; 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that l 
don't believe, 
I'm a 
happy nig and bound for to be gay. 
One night I 
took her to a 
ball. 
And danced with all niffht, 
I 
paid her all attention, 
And done everything that's right, 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite, ,Ve. 
The last T 
heard of Lize, 
And her tar heel colored moke, 
She was doing washing, 
Her darling .Toe was broke. 
SO 
he has gone to blacking boots, 
To try to get along, 
Site often wished she'd married me., 
For now she knows sho'8 wrung. 
But in spite, &o.

UNDER THE DAISIES, 
I'VE just been learning the lesson of life, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving ; 
Anti all that's left of the bright, bright ireain, 
With its thousand and brilliant phases, 
Is a 
handful of dust in a 
con' hid— 
A 
coffin un kr the daisies, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And thus forever throughout this wide world, 
Is love a 
sorrow proving, 
There are still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the saddest of all is loving; 
The life of some is worse than Death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
And far better than life with two hearts estrange-ti, 
Is a 
low grave st arr'd with daisies, 
The beaut.ful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And so ' tis better we liv'd as we did, 
The summer of love tog-ether, 
And that one of us tird and lay down to rest 
Ere the comieg of wintry weather; 
For the saddest of love is love grown cold, 
And ' Us one of . ts surest phases, 
So I 
bless my .01, though with breaking heart, 
For that grave enstarr'd with daisier, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies,

'rho Old Itome Ain't What it Used to Be 
By C. A. 
W HITE. 
011, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo mid the liddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and foloru, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
Igo, the old home ain't what it used to he. 
The change makes ma sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing

thought 'twas 
But night bro'r its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
they are scattered now and o'er the world they 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the i,1(1 hcane,

As sung by Jon NNY W 
1,1). 
r_ had a 
donkey what wouldn't go, 
D'ye think I'd wallop him? no, no, no; 
By gentle means, I'd try, d'ye see, 
Because I 
hates all cruelty; 
If all had been like inc in fact, 
There'd ha' been no occasion for Bergh, 
Dumb animals to prevent getting cpuckt 
On the head. 
Ciroutts. 
For if I 
had a 
donkey wot wouldn't go. 
I 
never would wallop him, no, no, no, 
I'd give him some hay, and cry, " Gee wo," 
And " Come up, Neddy " 
What makes me mention this, this morn, 
I 
seed that cruel chap, Bill Burn, 
Whilst he was out a-crying greens, 
His donkey wallop with all his means; 
lie hit him o'er the head and thighs 
lie brought the tears up in his eyes— 
At last my blood began to rise, 
And I 
said--
If I 
had a 
donkey, (tIre. 
lull turn'd and said to me, " Then, perhaps, 
You're one of these Mister Bergh's chaps, 
Vot now is seeking for occasion 
All for to lie au information." 
Though this I 
stoutly did deny, 
Bill up and gave me a 
blow in the eye, 
And I 
replied as I 
let tly 
At his head, 
If I 
hind a 
donkey,

As Bill and I 
did break the peace, 
To us came up the new police, 
And hiked us off, as sure es fate, 
Afore the sitting magistrate. 
I 
told his worship all the spree, 
• 
And to prove the veracity, 
I 
wished he would the animal See; 
For I 
said— 
Bill's donkey was ordered into court, 
in which he caused a 
deal of sport; 
He cock'd his ears and ope'd his jaws, 
As if he wished to pleail his cause. 
I 
proved I'd been unconnnonly kind, 
The ass got a 
verdict— Bill got tined; 
For his woeship and I 
were of one mind; 
For he said---
If I 
had a 
donkey, Asc. 
Bill said, " Your vorship, it's very hard, 
But lisn't the fine that I 
regard, 
But times have v,ome to a 
pretty pass 
When you mitsn't beat a 
stubborn as." 
His worship said nothing, but shut his book, 
So Billy off his donkey took, 
The same time givinc, me such a 
look ; 
Foe I 
said—Bill, 
I 
had a 
donkey, & c. 
As sung by Charlie Melville. 
Conic sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us, 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
Your hands are as fair as the lilies, 
That blossom in the shadows of _,:

And their touch has a 
magical power 
My heart from all sadness to wean.

Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my brew, 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
I

That life is an infinite calm, 
Your kiss has the spell of a 
charmer, 
Your kiss that is sweeter than balm. 
Oh what could be sweeter than dreamiw , 
This dream that is on us to- night ? 
Lot us think of the present, my darling, 
The future is out of our sight. 
Come sit by my side, &C. 
Sing low in the twilight some ballad, 
As sweet as the smile on your face, 
That shall thrill me with melody's sweetness, 
And touch with its words' tender grace. 
And I'll give you a 
kiss when it's ended, 
A 
kiss that the singer shall earn, 
And perhaps, do you hear, little darling 2 
I 
shall ask flit. a 
kiss in return. 
Come sit by my side, &c.

A_M getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
I 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
C.:LI Massa and old Mh-sus they'ie sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest; 
Things are changed about the place, the d.akies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Then) was a 
happy time to me not many years ngo, 
When the darkres used to gather round the door, 
rhey used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banji. 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling clown, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh ! the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
BOY. 
Oh! daddy, don't you be so sad and melancholy now, 
For you there's many happy days in store, 
Although you're old and feeble, your boy is young and strong, 
And will love and cherish you for evermore;

'THE HALLELUJAH BAND. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I WAS an artful dodger once, but now you'll understand, 
I'm a 
most excellent member of the Hal elujah B nd; 
Our doings are notorious, and here I 
may remark, 
We've lately held a 
picnic in the ground of Greenwich Park. 
It was a 
glorious morning and we made a 
jolly start, 
Like a 
gels going to Dixie in a 
covered canine cart, 
So brotherly anesisterly, of friends about a 
score, 
And such a 
jolly lot of loving lambs you never saw before. 
CHORUS. 
Then you may go to Blackpool, Isle of Man or Harrowgate, 
Southport, Scarborough, or search through the land, 
But if you want a 
spree that a 
saint can only see, 
You must join a 
jolly party in the I 
lallelujah Band. 
We reached the park at 2 
p.m., and wandering we went 
On where to find a 
shady spot that we might pitch our tent; 
And soon we found a 
quiet spot, where we could sit unseen, 
To smoke a 
pipe, to sing a 
song, or to dance upon the green; 
We introduced the eatables, the bottled stout and beer, 
With sundry drops of sotneang short, our sinking souls to 
Cheer, 
When Sister Sarah Spriggenbot om begged that Brother Prim 
Would sing her " Champagne Charlie" and she would sing a 
hymn. 
Chorus.—Then you may go, S7,c,. 
Now, when we'd done with Doctor Watts we took a 
turn at 
Bass, 
And drank success to temperance in many a 
flowing glass; 
1Ve pledged each other manfully in wines o. ev,ry sort, 
The women doing ditto in a 
drop of something short. 
We satisfied the inner man, then cleared the crumbs away, 
We danced and sang, declaring we had spent a 
happy d.ly; 
Then had a 
game at kiss in the ring, and kissed each others 
wives, 
And vowed it was the jolliest day we'd spent in all our lives. 
Chorus.—Then you may go. &e.

Some lovers are so bashful, 
They will never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure„ absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why ; 
But when my charmer'S pa is near— 
These words are her reply--
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa; 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, dear, but not before pa. 
I'm .
very fond of flirting, - 
But there's one I 
love best; 
I'm sure I'm rot too bashful 
In seeking love's request.

We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lovers' seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze ;

And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day," 
These words were her reply—

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
AIR. — Castles in the Air. 
While thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated.at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fir& began to fade—a 
shadow o'erit.grew ; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave 
me pain ; 
Oh ! may I 
never see them in reality again ; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case ; 
The family of a 
workingman, hunger stared them in the face 
The mother and their children gather'd round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread, 
Though honest, he is forced to steal and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court ; two prisoners in were led ; • 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill-fed ; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat. 
He said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat; 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran 
down his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good grace; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him 
through— 
That ends the ease, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin, dastardly and cold! 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm 
told; 
The murder of' Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all. 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolling kept the 
ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace, in this dissolving view. 
As sung by Tosy PASTOR. 
THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free, 
I 
wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea, 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink was pure, and not 
Adulterated stuff, 
They'd no Good Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court laid they got, 
And they never read " The Englishman," 
0 I 
they were a 
happy lot. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be 
They'd ne'er had an " Odger," no claimants' Sir Roger,; 
ritty miles under the sea. 
They'd never had a 
national debt, 
They never were troubled with w rs, 
They never had a 
man for the rat 
Come knock, knock, knock at I : dr doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and c, ns 
. 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CHORUS. 
I 
his is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
A. plain, as plain could be, 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jail, 
Fift) miles under the sea. 
Never a, tine had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
fhe mothers-
in-law all lived by themst Ives 
Ten thousand miles away; 
.No pater was troubled with milliners' 
Their children ne'er numbered a 
score, 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each should have two and no more. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
I 
then heard a 
knock, and it's past ten o'clock, 
I' came up then from under the sea. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that Mymoth'er taught CO me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take moon her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed. me to her breast I've heard my inoth 
say— 
Waste not, Want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," am l 
practice what yoo 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, „likil:sunbeatn, pass 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry,

Is, waste not. 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Listen to the water- null, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never comimg back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, lose no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this--to-day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with the -
ci.:ter that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lort without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh ! hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
• Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire i 
the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc.

Written expressly 
for TIERNEY &" CRONIN. 
Oh, let ye stand from under now and open wide your cars, 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West thay made us go 
And we worked at canalling in the State of Oh-ho-ho. 
But when the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
Company and wint into the fray ; 
We fought the ragged rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they could'nt bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our ha, ha, ha, ha, hayfoot, straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many's the time we thought we'd thought we'd never 
see our homes again; 
The rebels fought like devils, but their fighting, was in vain, 
For they could'nt bate the Sligo Musteteen. 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and wid Grant wt. 
took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, though he was small, our gallant little 
Mac ; 
Faith ! if they'd let him have his way, he'd surely drive 
thim back, 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers. 
Sure, he knew how to Engineer, likewise to command ; 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c. 
But now our lave of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd ax you all to take a 
ball, but we're without a 
chit ; 
On Erie shares, and all such snares, our money it is lint— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers. 
We'll say Good Evening, one and all, your pardon, too, 
we crave, 
We did our duty, manfully, this country for to save ; 
May the Shamrock and the Stars and Stripes in triumph 
ever wave, 
O'er the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, Sr,c.

Last night I

'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears ; 
Oh: he cried, it's a

And she scratched both my eyes and my ears 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain.

Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love ; 
Don't think for a

I'vc. only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark ; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, &c.

And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
Awl tried to enjoy my cigar.

If she'd let me alone for a-while ; 4 
Then I gave her a

And I

THE HAPPY HOTTENTOTS. 
:Written by W-II.'DELEIIANTiY. 
WE 
are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name; 
We 
used to gather Buchu leave; 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came, 
He paid us for the same. 
Crtotttra. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu; 
We are happy Hottentots. 
Happy, happy, happy Hottentots 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got- our name. 
Every night when work is done, 
.Day time, night time, always full ot fttsr, „ 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Hottentots, 
sing and dance most all the day, 
singing, dancing, pass the time away. 
All our troubles come and 0, 
We eend them down below. •

'TWAS a 
lovely summer's day, 
And the birds were singing gay, 
While the flow'rs filid the air with odor sweet, 
Strolling leisurely along, 
humming some old plaintive song, 
A 
charming little maiden I 
chanced to meet, 
She had eyes of bonny blue, 
And her cheekE a 
roseate hue, 
Like a 
fairy flitting. thro' a 
garden bower, 
Oh ! she looked divinely fair, 
Picking posie'E. here and there, 
While indeed she was herself the fairest flower. 
Chortng: 
Pretty eyes of bonny blue, 
All my heart I 
give to you, 
Oh! she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders bare; 
And my happy heart her image still embower, 
1 
am like the littic bee. 
Kissing every flow'r I 
see, 
Since the day I 
met my love among the flowers. 
I
Ml enraptured I 
stood there, 
Nnd I 
know it wasn't fair, 
For the blush went from the rose into hur cheek 
Turning round she seemed to smile, 
But with modesty the while, 
- 
And respect and duty bade me then to speak, 
Pray excuse me, Miss, said I, 
But as 1 
was passing by— 
Oh ! I 
found this plain gold ring, and thought ' twas yours 
Then she smiling, answered, no, 
Still she never bid me go, 
So we stood and talked awhile among the flowers. 
Pretty eyes, j'.

Then we

the rising moon, 
Sittin 
du by side upon the portico, 
Whge , pon her little hand— 
1 
had placed the golden band, 
And was waiting for her answer, yes,or no, 
Surely love was on the wing, 
Cupid there came wandering, 
And was seeking shelter from the dewy showers, 
When he saw each loving heart, 
Loathing evermore to part, 
Then he tied the knot of love among the flowers.

SOUTH CARLINE. 
Song and Dance, composed by JAS. NILES. 
Performed by NILES 
EvANs with success. 
Oh, when we were two little boys 
Way down in South Canine ; 
We used to sing and dance about, 
And with our hands keep time. 
But when we grew up bigger 
We had to work all day, 
And then we never had a 
chance 
To fool around that way.

But, Oh! my! when our work was done—Sym, 
Then was the time that we all went in for fun ; 
We used to sing and dance about 
Till Massa made us run.

But now the times have changed you see, 
Down in our Sunnily Home; 
The Rebellion broke the country up, 
So now we have to roam.
