Hum an  b e ings  
lea rned how to take an oak tree and make out of it not
 
only something useful but something beautiful - a carved front door,  a woven
 
basket.
 Human beings long ago learned how to take a melody and make of it a
 
hymn
 
into a classic joke or an epic ballad.
 The particular ways all these things
 
are done depends upon the particular traditional
. stream within which the
 
artist has developed.
 Our artistic trades go far back in history,  each
 
Being host to an extraordinary number of human beings from different parts
 
of 
we in t
he United States are thereby hosts to an extraordinary
 
number of matured and developed artistic and technical traditions.  What a
 
privilege.

t is this that the Folk Arts Program of the National Endowment
 
for the Arts celebrates t

will greet, salute, and honor Just a few examples of the dazzling array of

and traditions.  We believe t

the American experience.
 
For this year of 1982 we commend t
o your attention:
 
Dewey Balfa, a Louisiana man, an eloquent musician and spokesman for Cajun
 
culture.  His people, exiled centuries ago from French Canada, carved a new
 
homeland in the swamps of the Mississippi Delta and over two hundred years
 
gradually created a new music t
o celebrate their achievement.
 
Joe Heaney, an Irishman and a fabled sean nos singer of great range and
 
depth.  As Irish workmen helped push the expanding system of canals, roadways,
 
and railways across the young nation, Irish tunes became part of the country's
 
standard repertoire.  Joe Heaney is one of a long line of Irish bards whose
 
songs speak to our deepest remembrances.
 
Tommy Jarrell, a North Carolina countryman and a mountain fiddler of
 
storied repertoire and technique.  The home-made fiddle was the most important
 
instrument of the frontier, easy to carry along and an orchestra all by itself.
 
In Tommy Jarrell's wise and experienced hands, i
t still it.
 
Bessie Jones, a Black woman from rural Georgia with a head full  of the
 
oldest and strongest songs of her people.  Like Joe Heaney, Bessie Jones sings
 
the "deep songs"; like him, she usually, sings without accompaniment
 unlike him,
 
her tradition calls for her children and neighbors t
o sing in harmony with her,
 
t
o bear her up, and so make her joyful sound the more joyful.
 
George Lopez, a sixth generation woodcarver from the village of Cordova
 
in the Sangre de Cristo mountains of northern New Mexico.  His santos, or religious
 
figures, are simply carved; their purity of line reflects the purity of spirit
 
that informs this ancient devotional tradition.

Brownie McGhee's singing lays bare the wit and ironic detachment that
 
characterize the blues of the upland south.  His brilliant guitar work is
 
almost casually tossed off; his musicianship is impeccable.  Together with his
 
long-term partner, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee has influenced many generations
 
of bluesmen and musicians.
 
Hugh McGraw has labored tirelessly on behalf of his beloved Sacred Harp
 
music, an American choral religious tradition that dates back at least two
 
centuries.
 A song leader and singing school organizer beyond compare, Hugh
 
McGraw's dedication, knowledge, and musical skills have inspired Sacred Harp
 
singing conventions across the entire south.
 
Lydia Mendoza began singing in her family "conjunto"  (
musical group)
 
as they entertained in small towns along the lower Rio Grande Valley a
 
generation ago.
 She was only six when she began, but her vibrant personality,
 
strong singing voice, and vigorous twelve-string guitar work brought her into
 
early prominence, and many songs now considered standard in the Mexican-American
 
repertoire were first recorded by Lydia Mendoza.
 
Bill Monroe, song-maker, mandolinist, and father of  bluegrass.
 
Once described as "folk music in overdrive", this brilliant musical style
 
takes the familiar American country string ensemble of fiddle, banjo, guitar,
 
and mandolin into a new dimension.
 Bill Monroe is one of the few living
 
American musicians who can justly claim to have created an entire new musical style.
 
Elijah Pierce began to carve with a pocket knife at the age of nine.
 
Beginning with traditional forms, such as walking sticks, Pierce later came
 
to carve free-standing figures and then large elaborate bas-reliefs of Biblical
 
scenes and personal experiences.  His "sermons in wood" reflect the importance
 
of traditional religion in much Afro-American folk expression.
 
Adam Popovich, senior musician and a principal shaper of the American
 
tamburitza, the most important. form of traditional music in older Serbian and
 
4
 
Croatian-American communities.  Like bluegrass,  t
amburitza music i
s played
 
by small ensembles of stringed instruments improvising endlessly and brilliantly
 
around traditional melodies.  Unlike bluegrass, tamburitza singing is full-
throated, liquid and choral.  Adam Popovich i
s master of both voice and instrument.
 
Georgeann Robinson is a member of the Deer Clan of the Osage Tribe and
 
one of the most skilled practitioners of the Osage art of ribbonwork, a needlework
 
tradition that features striking geometric designs executed in brilliant bands
 
of  contrastive color. Mrs. Robinson works from designs she has learned from
 
old Osage women and researched through family and museum collections, becoming
 
both scholar and artist of this almost lost tradition.
 
Duff Severe, saddleinaker and rawhide  W
orker.  His work occupies a central
 
place in contemporary Western folk art.  Well-made, well-crafted saddles, reins,
 
bits, and bridles are the occasion not only for expert craftsmanship but for
 
the expression of an aesthetic dimension in silver inlay and engraving, in leather-
work and design, in rawhide and in horsehair work.  Duff Severe is legendary
 
throughout the western states for his mastery of all these crafts
 
Phillip Simmons, a blacksmith and ornamental ironworker from South Carolina
 
exemplifies skill, excellence and a deep knowledge of traditional design.  The
 
lacy tracery of black iron spearpoints, leaves, and scrolls decorating homes
 
and gardens through Charlestown and other fortunate southern cities are owed
 
to the work of such skillful artisans i
s Phillip Simmons, his many apprentices
 
and fellow-workers.
 
Sanders (
Sonny) Terry, master musician, peerlessly inventive, has developed
 
his tiny instrument, the simple harmonica, into a mini-orchestra.  When Sonny
 
"whoops" the blues, one often does not know which voice is speaking, the
 
instrument or the man.  The balletic movements of his hands, the constant interplay
 
between voice and instrument, the i
nfectious beat of his music distinguishes
 
him among all American f
olk musicians.

The foregoing f
ifteen master t
raditional artists have each taken their
 
respective art form t
o a new height.  Each one has built upon the inventions,
 
the perfected techniques, the aesthetic experiments of countless artists in
 
the same tradition who have gone on before -
-
 singers, musicians, artisans
 
whose names we will never know.  As we honor the winners of the National
 
Heritage Fellowships in 1982, we honor their artistic forebears as well.
 It
 
is this, perhaps, t
hat truly distinguishes these awards -
-
 that in the persons
 
of these outstanding individuals, we can honor an entire tradition and the
 
long line of earlier artists who have helped invent t
he many folk art forms
 
that grace our land  and our people.
