0:00:03 Sebastian Zutant: Alright. Let's do it. 
0:00:04 KS: Alright. So, this is Kim Stryker. Today is Tuesday. 
0:00:10 SZ: The 12th of the 12th. 
0:00:12 KS: The 12th of the 12th month, December 2017. It's about just almost 11 o' 
clock in the morning, and I'm sitting in Primrose Restaurant with Sebastian Zutant. 
0:00:26 SZ: Good job. 
0:00:27 KS: Did I say that right? 
0:00:28 SZ: You did. You nailed it. 
0:00:28 KS: Oh, good. And so tell me a little bit about where we are right now. 
0:00:33 SZ: We are in Northeast Washington, DC, on 12th Street, in the 12th month, on 
the 12th day. 
0:00:42 KS: My God. 
0:00:43 SZ: Some weird shit. 
0:00:44 KS: Yeah. 
0:00:48 SZ: It's called "The Little Vatican" here. 
0:00:48 KS: Really? [chuckle]

0:00:49 SZ: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's the... Whatever that giant church 
is called. 
0:00:55 KS: The Basilica. 
0:00:55 SZ: The Basilica. 
0:00:55 KS: The shrine of the... 
0:00:56 SZ: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
0:00:58 KS: Immaculate... 
0:00:58 SZ: Something. Something. 
0:01:00 KS: Something. 
0:01:03 SZ: If you haven't been, it's amazing. So there's that, and then there is the 
Monastery, the Franciscan Monastery right over on 13th Street, and then there is also 
Trinity College. So yeah, it's a pretty holy place. 
0:01:12 SZ: Catholic University? 
0:01:13 SZ: Catholic University. Yep. Yep. Yep. 
0:01:16 KS: A shrine to John Paul... To whatever its name is. 
0:01:19 SZ: That's my birth name, John Paul. 
0:01:24 KS: See? 
0:01:24 SZ: I made up Sebastian when I was 21. 
0:01:26 KS: Just glad we're getting this all on tape. 
0:01:32 SZ: We might as well, right? So yeah, we're in Northeast DC, we're just a 
spitball away from the nation's capital, from the actual Capitol Building. A cool, little 
diverse neighborhood. 
0:01:40 KS: Yeah, it's... 
0:01:41 SZ: Full of the upwardly mobile, highly educated. 
0:01:47 KS: It's strangely... Like when I do the MapQuest, or whatever, to get here, even 
though it takes like basically a full hour from my house to get here, it's 11 miles.

0:01:58 SZ: Yes. 
 
0:02:00 KS: If we could do a straight line, it would be 11 miles. Isn't that crazy? 
 
0:02:03 SZ: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very, very close... 
 
0:02:04 KS: I don't think people are outside of DC really understand how insane... Like 
the small distance takes so long to get anywhere. 
 
0:02:11 SZ: Yeah. I think everybody thinks that DC is... Everybody that's in DC, 
everybody that lives here, has this idea that I'm in the suburbs, but it's really close. 
 
0:02:21 KS: Yeah. It's super close. 
 
0:02:22 SZ: DC is very small comparatively. 
 
0:02:26 KS: Right. 
 
0:02:27 SZ: If you're on the Lower East Side and you're trying to go to the Upper West 
Side, it's gonna take you an hour. 
 
0:02:34 KS: Right. Yeah. 
 
0:02:34 SZ: Well, maybe not an hour, but it's gonna take you a half hour. 
 
0:02:38 KS: Yeah. A good amount of time. Well... And so there can be a big divide too, I 
think sometimes, between... Like I have friends that live in the city who think coming to 
Falls Church, which is, like I said 11 miles away, is like going to Kentucky. 
 
0:02:53 SZ: Well, I mean it is in Virginia. 
 
0:02:56 KS: Yeah. [chuckle] 
 
0:02:57 SZ: So yeah, that's kind of hard to actually go to Virginia. 
 
0:03:01 KS: And why is that? 
 
0:03:08 SZ: It's just scary. 
 
0:03:10 KS: Scary? [chuckle] Scary? 
 
0:03:11 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:03:12 KS: What's scares you about Virginia?

0:03:13 SZ: White people. [chuckle] 
0:03:15 KS: Oh, there are a lot of them. 
0:03:16 SZ: Yeah. 
0:03:16 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:03:17 SZ: I get nervous around a lot of white people. [chuckle] 
 
0:03:20 KS: Yes, I know the feeling. There are a lot of them, us, out there. 
 
0:03:27 SZ: They? 
 
0:03:28 KS: They. I try not to be them, but there you have it. So we're here at 
Primrose because you own this place. 
 
0:03:37 SZ: I do. 
 
0:03:38 KS: Yeah. And it just opened fairly recently? 
0:03:41 SZ: Yep. Third week, we're gonna be starting. 
0:03:44 KS: That's bananas. 
0:03:45 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:03:46 KS: And... [chuckle] So we're in a restaurant where someone is measuring 
something with a measuring tape, if you hear that sound in the background. So how did 
you... What is your connection to wine?

#startingout 
 
0:04:06 SZ: It's just happenstance, really. So I opened a restaurant... Well, I guess, okay. 
So I worked at Nectar. Yeah, I was also a back waiter, a server's assistant, at Nectar, and 
then they had a very intriguing wine program, and I think that was really my first 
introduction to it. Jarad Slipp put on a really cool wine program, and I... 
 
0:04:30 KS: Could you spell his name? 
 
0:04:31 SZ: Mm-hmm. J-A-R-A-D, S-L-I-P-P. 
 
0:04:40 KS: Okay. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

0:04:40 SZ: And he was just pouring really intriguing stuff. He was pouring Grüner 
Veltliner before anybody was pouring Grüner Veltliner. And yeah, it was a really 
engaging wine program. It was a very, very small staff. You didn't really have much of a 
choice, you we were in it. And so that was my first introduction to it. And after that, I left 
there to open up Komi. And Johnny was just learning to be a chef, and I was the front of 
the house, and so I just learned how to be a sommelier. 
 
0:05:13 KS: What's Johnny's full name? 
 
0:05:14 SZ: Johnny Monis. J-O-H-N-N-Y, M-O-N-I-S. 
 
0:05:21 KS: So were you partners? Were you... What was the relationship? 
 
0:05:25 SZ: No, no, no. He was and still is just a good buddy. And so, we were just two 
kids kinda like winging it. 
 
0:05:35 KS: Nice. 
 
0:05:36 SZ: And that's what happened. So I didn't really have much of a choice. I was 
just the sommelier. 
 
0:05:41 KS: Right. 
 
 
#training #onthefly #DIY #education #school #art 
 
0:05:43 SZ: On a pretty tight budget. So I bought a lot of really cool shit and it was 
cheap and I figured out a way to run a wine program with zero training. 
 
0:06:00 KS: Yeah. So that was it. You didn't have any... You didn't go... 
 
0:06:04 SZ: Nope. Nope. 
 
0:06:05 KS: To correspondence school. You didn't do something out of the back of a 
magazine, anything. 
 
0:06:08 SZ: Nothing. 
 
0:06:09 KS: Culinary school, anything? 
 
0:06:10 SZ: Nope. 
 
0:06:11 KS: Wow. Okay. That is different. 
 
0:06:13 SZ: Art school. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
6 
 
0:06:14 KS: Art school? For what? 
 
0:06:17 SZ: I graduated with a degree in Photography and I minored in sculpture. 
 
0:06:22 KS: Where did you go to school? 
 
0:06:23 SZ: The College of Charleston in South Carolina. 
 
0:06:26 KS: Oh yeah. They have a very good program there, don't they? 
 
0:06:29 SZ: Mm-hmm. 
 
0:06:33 KS: And so when was that? When were you in art school? 
 
0:06:35 SZ: I graduated in 2000. The millennium, the turn of the millennium. 
 
0:06:41 KS: Okay. So then when were you at Nectar? 
 
0:06:48 SZ: 2003. 
 
0:06:50 KS: Okay. 
 
0:06:52 SZ: And then Komi opened in 2004. 
 
0:06:54 KS: Okay. And was Nectar in DC or... 
 
0:06:58 SZ: Yeah. It was down in, I think, I wanna say the George Washington Hotel 
right near the Kennedy Centre. 
 
0:07:08 KS: Okay. 
 
0:07:09 SZ: So down in Foggy Bottom. It was in a basement. It was a real shitty 
location. It was only like 30 seats. It was not a very good space. 
 
0:07:17 KS: Not for successes. 
0:07:19 SZ: Not built for success. 
0:07:20 KS: No. 
0:07:20 SZ: Had like... Minimal accoutrement. 
 
0:07:27 KS: Yeah, which probably could work now. 
 
0:07:30 SZ: Totally but it was pretty damn expensive. It was neat though. Jamison, who 
is coming and staying with me next weekend, incredible chef. So...

0:07:44 KS: Jamison... What's his name? 
 
0:07:45 SZ: Jamison Blankenship. 
 
0:07:48 KS: E-S-O-N or I-S-O-N? 
 
0:07:51 SZ: I-S-O-N. 
 
0:07:52 KS: Blankenship... Any relation to the coal family? 
 
0:08:00 SZ: Not that I know of. 
 
0:08:03 KS: Okay. Blankenship Coal Company. 
0:08:04 SZ: Yeah, I dunno anything about coal. 
0:08:04 KS: Yeah [chuckle] okay. Alright. So, Komi. 
0:08:08 SZ: Yeah. 
0:08:09 KS: Then, so... Art School, 2000, Nectar, 2003. 
 
0:08:15 SZ: Mm hmm. Komi, 2004... 
 
0:08:18 KS: 2004. 
 
 
#career #food #restaurant #DC #Rasika 
 
0:08:19 SZ: To 2006 and then I went to Rasika and I opened up Rasika. 
 
0:08:27 KS: When was that? 
 
0:08:29 SZ: I guess it was 2000... Okay, so I'm missing a year 'cause I moved to 
California in 2006. Okay, so I did not stay at Rasika very long. 
 
0:08:40 KS: Okay. 
 
0:08:40 SZ: It was a very short stint. 
 
0:08:41 KS: Okay. 
 
0:08:42 SZ: I wanna say like seven months. So I guess that makes sense. 
 
0:08:45 KS: So it was in 2006 though.

0:08:46 SZ: It was in 2006 and then I bolted for California and I went to make wine. 
And... 
 
0:08:54 KS: Where did you go to do that? 
 
0:08:55 SZ: I went and moved in with... Or lived part time with a guy named Greg 
LaFollette who... I can't remember Bryan's last name, but Bryan is now the wine maker at 
DeLoach. But I worked with both of them hand in hand in 2006 vintage and I worked at 
DeLoach and I worked at a custom crush facility. 
 
0:09:22 KS: What's DeLoach? How is that spelled? 
 
0:09:25 SZ: Capital D-E. 
 
0:09:26 KS: Capital L. 
 
0:09:27 SZ: Capital L-O-A-C-H. 
 
0:09:36 KS: That's not how I spelled it. Alright. Good job and that was where in 
California? 
 
0:09:38 SZ: Sonoma. 
 
0:09:39 KS: Okay. 
 
0:09:40 SZ: So, I was living in Calistoga and then I was driving over the Mayacamas 
every morning at like 3 AM. 
 
0:09:45 KS: Oh. Lovely. 
 
0:09:46 SZ: Not so bad. And working in Sonoma. It was a pretty fantastic time. It was a 
really really difficult time. It was a really bad vintage. 
 
0:10:00 KS: And you were doing, also, a custom grape... What did you just call it... A 
custom crush... 
 
0:10:03 SZ: Custom crush facility. Yeah, where you basically make wine for a bunch of 
different people. But this custom crush facility was super cool 'cause it was all like the 
kinda badasses in Sonoma at the same time. Like Merry Edwards was making wine 
there... And Greg was like really hot on the scene right then. He was making Tandem and 
Tandem was really highly regarded. So I was helping all those people out too. So it was 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

really neat. It was a really neat time to be part of that. It was difficult though. I mean 
you're working like 18-hour days and it's rainy and cold. 
 
0:10:36 KS: So you didn't have any previous experience with it. You just jumped in? 
 
 
#opportunity #internship #marriage #moving #LearnByDoing 
 
0:10:39 SZ: I met Greg at a lunch. I said "Man, I would really like to go out to California 
and make wine with you." He said, 'Well if you really want to, you can have an internship 
and you'd need to be out there in three weeks. 
 
0:10:56 SZ: And so, I quit, I told my then wife I was doing it, I bought a plane ticket and 
I left. 
 
0:11:04 KS: Not so not a big deal. 
 
0:11:06 SZ: Zip zip. 
 
0:11:07 KS: You sort of shrug like it was easy, but that must have been very tumultuous. 
How did you live your life, get out of your rent? 
 
0:11:17 SZ: Well my wife and I... My then wife and I weren't living together. And so... 
 
0:11:21 KS: You just said, "Hey, see you later."? 
 
0:11:23 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:11:24 KS: "I'm going to California." Okay. And she was okay with that? 
 
0:11:27 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:11:27 KS: Okay. 
 
0:11:28 SZ: I mean it was for a specific period of time. 
 
0:11:30 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:11:30 SZ: Like it was always like I was coming back. I didn't really want to, but... 
 
0:11:35 KS: Yeah. So how long were you there for? 
 
0:11:38 SZ: Like 8 months. 
 
0:11:40 KS: Okay. And so, in that process, how did the internship work? Did you... 
Were you trained? Did you just follow somebody around or did you...

0:11:53 SZ: No, you just get thrown right into it... 
 
0:11:54 KS: So they were like, "Do this." 
 
#punchdowns #physicalwork #pump-overs #jargon #ferment #juice #winemaking #safety 
#workdangers #intense #urbanlegends 
 
0:11:55 SZ: And you're like 100%. Yep, like 100% day to day. I was the guy that woke 
up because I got there so early I was doing the punch-downs every morning. I was doing 
the pump-overs every morning. It's a tough job, really is. It's a lot of physical labor. 
 
0:12:08 KS: Okay. Tell me what a punch-down is. 
 
0:12:11 SZ: A punch down is when grapes start to ferment, they form a cap, so the juice 
and the must separates. 
 
0:12:19 KS: Right. You get like a goo on the top? 
 
0:12:22 SZ: Mm-hmm, but it's eight inches thick and really difficult to push through. So 
you have to get these punch-down sticks, and basically push down through it, so that you 
can continually expose the juice to the skins, so that everything is uniformly taking color 
and tannin, etcetera. 
 
0:12:42 KS: What's a punch down stick look like? Can you describe it? 
 
0:12:47 SZ: Like a pogo stick with a wide, flat bottom... With a plate attached to the 
bottom. 
 
0:12:55 KS: Is it kind of like when you're tamping the grounds? Like one of those 
things? 
 
0:13:00 SZ: Exactly, except they're five feet long, so you have to stand on them. It's very 
pogo-sticky. 
 
0:13:04 KS: Is there a ramp over the tank, or something? How do you... 
 
0:13:08 SZ: There's a ladder over the tank. 
 
0:13:09 KS: And you're balancing up there and shoving this thing down? 
 
0:13:13 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:13:15 KS: Yeah, that sounds scary. 
 
0:13:16 SZ: It's not very safe because there's so much CO2 that if you fall in, you'll pass 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11 
 
out and eventually die. 
 
0:13:19 KS: But that's the a... 
 
0:13:21 SZ: But, it's not like that happens all the time. There's like... 
 
0:13:22 KS: There's a lot of urban legends about people falling into tanks and dying... 
 
0:13:26 SZ: It happens once a year. As far as I know. I don't know. That may be urban 
legend also. I didn't know anybody who died. 
 
0:13:33 KS: But you always hear about it. 
 
0:13:35 SZ: You do always hear about it. Yeah, it was an intense time of my life. 
 
0:13:41 KS: So you were working, you said 18-hour days... 
 
 
#harvest #18hourdays #adrenaline #workenvironment #immigrants #co-workers 
#Spanish #SouthAmerica #winemaking #migrantlabor #internships 
 
0:13:44 SZ: Not every day was 18 hours, but during harvest, hell yeah. 
 
0:13:45 KS: During harvest it's crazy. 
 
0:13:46 SZ: Yeah, it's wild. It's a lot of adrenaline, though. 
 
0:13:51 KS: So who... What was your work environment like? Who else was in there 
with you? 
 
0:13:55 SZ: My work environment was interesting 'cause it was me and two Chileans, 
two Uruguayans, and five or six Mexicans. Then of course the upper management of it 
was all white boys and girls. But I speak some pretty broken Spanish and I really like... 
There's an organic garden on the grounds of DeLoach, and I can't remember his name, 
but the gardener was super rad, and he always had these amazing chili peppers growing. 
So I would have a lot of chili pepper-eating contests with all the Mexicans. 
 
0:14:30 KS: Oh geez. 
 
0:14:31 SZ: Yeah, the Uruguayans and the Chileans did not care for it. 
 
0:14:33 KS: No, they do not like spicy... No. 
 
0:14:36 SZ: They were a funny bunch. I really enjoyed their company. They were pretty 
fun. They're all pretty wild. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
12 
 
0:14:43 KS: I'm surprised and I'm not surprised that there were Uruguayans and Chileans 
down there. Obviously, there's wine... 
 
0:14:51 SZ: They're all learning American wine-making, yeah. 
 
0:14:53 KS: So they were doing internships? 
 
0:14:56 SZ: Mm-hmm. 
 
0:14:57 KS: Okay. For taking those techniques down... 
 
0:15:00 SZ: Totally. Yeah, exactly. 
 
0:15:00 KS: And making wine back at their home. But the Mexican workers were, I'm 
assuming more... 
 
0:15:04 SZ: More migrant workers. Yeah. For sure. 
 
0:15:07 KS: Yeah. Okay, okay. 
 
0:15:08 SZ: Half of them had permanent jobs there. 
 
0:15:11 KS: Well there's a lot... But there's also a lot of... Now there's a lot of wine- 
making happening in Mexico. 
 
0:15:15 SZ: Totally. 
 
0:15:16 KS: But in your situation, the Mexican workers that were there were hired to 
work the facility. 
 
0:15:23 SZ: Yeah, exactly. 
 
0:15:24 KS: They weren't there for an internship. 
 
0:15:25 SZ: No, no, no. 
 
0:15:26 KS: Okay. Fascinating. You're staying in Sonoma, but you're travelling over to 
this place? Where were you staying? 
 
0:15:38 SZ: I was staying in Calistoga. 
 
0:15:42 KS: Calistoga. Sorry. 
 
0:15:42 SZ: Like the North part of Napa. And that was when I was living with Brian, 
who is now... Oh, shit, what's his last name? I can't remember, anyway, he's the wine- 
maker at DeLoach now. He's done great. Brian Maloney. M-A-L-O-N-E-Y... And his 
Winery Workers in Virginia

wife, Erin, and now they have a baby. I stayed with Brian primarily until the end. 
 
0:16:08 KS: How did you... You already were friends with Brian, or... 
 
0:16:10 SZ: No, no, no, it kind of all just happened. 
 
0:16:12 KS: It all worked out. 
 
 
#lifecrossroads #intense #winemaking #leapoffaith #serendipity 
 
0:16:14 SZ: It was kind of a wild situation. It was probably the most intense, I was 
thinking about this the other day, it was probably the most poignant crossroads of my life. 
So I got off a plane... My best friend lives in San Francisco, so I went and stayed with 
him for a couple of days and it was Burning Man time. And so I helped them build their 
bus and they were going up the same day that I was leaving and it was a Tom Waits bar 
they were building and I love Tom Waits. And it was like this really intense thing where I 
will never forget. Dan Stone was like, "Hey man, so are you coming with us? Or are you 
gonna just go to Northern California?" And it was kind of like, this didn't actually 
happen, but in my brain it happened. I can see them just driving off and me throwing my 
bag on my back. But in truth, I basically took a bus up there and just got dropped off in 
the middle of fucking nowhere, and some random dude named Brian Maloney just came 
and picked me up. And I was, like, "hey". And then we made wine for a while. 
 
0:17:19 KS: Wow, that's crazy. 
 
0:17:22 SZ: It was fun, though. 
 
0:17:23 KS: So that wasn't a guaranteed thing, that you would have a place to stay or 
anything? 
 
0:17:25 SZ: No, it was. Greg had set it up. 
 
0:17:27 KS: Greg had made the arrangements, but you didn't know him before that. 
 
0:17:30 SZ: No. 
 
0:17:31 KS: Okay. Wow, that's great. How likely is something like that to happen? Is it 
still that kind of atmosphere out there or is it so competitive now that... 
 
0:17:42 SZ: I would like to think it's still that way. 
 
0:17:51 KS: Where did you grow up? 
 
0:17:54 SZ: I grew up right outside of DC.

0:17:57 SZ: Mm-hmm. 
 
0:17:58 KS: That's why you're so besmirching of Virginia. 
 
0:18:00 SZ: That's why I hate Virginia. 
 
0:18:00 KS: And I hate Maryland for the same reason. 
 
0:18:02 SZ: Well just for the record, I make wine in Virginia, so obviously, I don't hate it 
that much. 
 
0:18:05 KS: Just for the record you need to learn to embrace Virginia. 
 
 
#Virginia #notNorthernVirginia #Maryland-VirginiaRivalry #Rockville 
 
0:18:09 SZ: I do embrace Virginia, just not that bullshit in Northern Virginia. [laughter] 
Northern Virginia's only good for one thing. 
 
0:18:14 KS: What's Maryland's motto? We're Virginia is for Lovers. We're like 
awesome, and Maryland's like [0:18:19] 
jousting... 
 
0:18:19 SZ: My friend made a t-shirt that said Virgina is for losers. [laughter] It's the 
best t-shirt ever. 
 
0:18:26 KS: Yeah, this is a strange thing that is only people in this area really 
understands, the hatred that we have for the people that live many, just like seconds away 
from each other but... 
 
0:18:37 SZ: I know. My brother has a real hard time with the fact that we make wine in 
Virginia. 
 
0:18:42 KS: Oh, really? 
 
0:18:43 SZ: Yeah, he's a Maryland boy, like went to Maryland, a hardcore Maryland fan, 
hates it. 
 
0:18:47 KS: Wow. 
 
0:18:48 SZ: And I'm like, "Listen, dawg." 
 
0:18:48 KS: "That's where... "

0:18:50 SZ: "Sorry." 
 
0:18:50 KS: "My jam is." 
 
0:18:52 SZ: "Maybe we can make some wines with Westminster next year." 
 
0:18:55 KS: Yeah. Alright, well so... Still, Virginia's better. [chuckle] So if you grew up 
in Maryland, what town, what area? 
 
0:19:07 SZ: Rockville. 
 
0:19:09 KS: Rockville, don't go back to Rockville. 
 
0:19:10 SZ: I know. They wrote a song about it. 
 
0:19:12 KS: So you know it's gotta be good. And your family was composed of who? 
 
0:19:18 SZ: My dad, my mom and my two brothers. 
 
0:19:20 KS: All boys. 
 
0:19:22 SZ: Yep. 
 
0:19:23 KS: Poor mama. 
 
0:19:24 SZ: All boys, Jeffrey, Jason and Jonathan. Yeah. 
 
0:19:29 KS: Wow! 
 
0:19:30 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 
0:19:32 KS: And did you go to public school? What was your... Private school, prep 
school? 
 
0:19:38 SZ: Yeah, I wasn't really... 
 
0:19:40 KS: What, you didn't go to school? [laughter] 
 
0:19:43 SZ: No, I did. I don't wanna say I wasn't allowed, but I wasn't allowed to go to 
public school. 
 
0:19:47 KS: Oh. Problematic? 
 
0:19:50 SZ: Yeah, but I only got more problematic in private school. 
 
0:19:54 KS: Okay. But then you're paying them to keep you there, so...

0:19:58 SZ: Yeah. I went to Good Counsel, so like right on the border, so I would... 
Luckily, I was able to jump out of school and come down to DC and party. 
 
0:20:09 KS: Good. 
 
0:20:10 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:20:10 KS: That helped. 
 
0:20:11 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 
0:20:12 KS: Helped with whatever is going on. So you graduated from there? 
 
0:20:17 SZ: I did. 
 
0:20:17 KS: Did you go off to college? 
 
0:20:18 SZ: I did. 
 
0:20:19 KS: What did you... Oh right. You went to art school. 
 
0:20:19 SZ: College Of Charleston. Yeah, yeah. 
0:20:20 KS: Right. So it was straight to art school. 
0:20:23 SZ: Straight to art school. 
0:20:23 KS: How did you parents feel about art school? Some parents are cool with it, 
some parents are very not cool with it. 
 
0:20:28 SZ: I mean, my dad is pretty traditional. He's like businessman, blabbity blah 
blah. So I don't think he was super stoked about it, but my mom was super duper artsy, 
so... 
 
0:20:38 KS: Oh, okay. So you were maybe fulfilling something that... 
 
0:20:43 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:20:44 KS: She wanted? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
17 
 
 
0:20:44 SZ: Correct. 
 
0:20:45 KS: Cool. 
 
0:20:46 SZ: Yeah.

#wine #Proof #openingrestuarants #winedirector #managinginventory #RedHen 
#AllPurpose 
 
0:20:49 KS: So, how did you end up getting involved with Virginia wine? If we left 
California after eight months? 
 
0:21:01 SZ: So I came back, I opened Proof, and I was a wine director there for like six 
years or something like that. 
 
0:21:08 KS: Which is a very wine-centric place as well, isn't it? 
 
0:21:12 SZ: Yeah, it had like 1,200 bottles almost. Which is god-awful, by the way. 
Having to manage that kind of inventory is just brutal. 
 
0:21:21 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:21:21 SZ: So I left there and opened the Red Hen and All Purpose, and then left that 
company and opened up Primrose. 
 
0:21:34 KS: So, Proof was when? 
 
0:21:38 SZ: 2007 to 2013. 
 
0:21:44 KS: Okay. And then Red Hen? 
 
0:21:46 SZ: Well, yeah, so I guess it was 2007 to 2012. 'Cause there was like... 
 
0:21:53 KS: Some overlap there or... 
 
0:21:58 SZ: There's some overlap there 'cause I was at Proof for a little while and then 
Red Hen had opened, and Red Hen opened in April 2013, I wanna say. That sounds right. 
 
0:22:06 KS: Okay. And then All Purpose was more recent? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
18 
 
0:22:10 SZ: Mm-hmm. That was like 2016. 
 
0:22:15 KS: Okay. And then left... 
 
0:22:16 SZ: Yep. Maybe All Purpose was 2015, I don't know, something like that. And 
then... 
 
0:22:21 KS: Okay. 
 
0:22:22 SZ: Primrose opened three weeks ago. 
 
0:22:24 KS: Three weeks ago. So, at what point did the Virginia part come in?

#winemaking #MichaelSchaps #EarlyMountainVineyard #BenJordan #partner #winebar 
#familybusiness #financier #brother #TheLightwellSurvey 
 
0:22:28 SZ: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. So I lost that part. So I started making in 
conjunction with Ben Jordan who is now my business partner. He was the winemaker at 
Michael Schaps. And I started, let's just say, working together on a rosé for the Red Hen, 
then we made it at Michael Schaps the first year. And then the following year, Ben and I 
had already agreed to do a project together, and I knew the people from Early Mountain 
Vineyards, and I was trying to get involved with them. I was trying to establish a 
situation where maybe there were gonna open up a wine bar or provide me the 
opportunity to open up a wine bar here in the District. So I was already in cahoots with 
them. And then as it turned out, Ben ended up getting hired by Early Mountain 
Vineyards. So he is their wine maker currently. But thankfully, Ben and I had both 
established the fact that we were already business partners and they were cool with it. So 
we moved the rosé project over to Early Mountain, and we continued that. I was a 
consultant on the project. Does that make sense? Even though it was Ben and... I don't 
know. I don't know how to describe the situation. Ben was the winemaker, I was giving 
direction... 
 
0:24:00 KS: Right. Kind of fine-tuning what it was that you were looking for. 
 
0:24:02 SZ: Right, right, right, right, right. And then my brother came along, and he was 
like, "I wanna do some cool shit." And he had a bunch of cash. [chuckle] 
 
0:24:14 KS: Oh, that helps. 
0:24:16 SZ: So he is our financier. 
0:24:17 KS: Which brother? Jason? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
19 
 
0:24:19 SZ: Jason, the eldest, yeah. And so, yeah, in 2015, we started the Lightwell 
Survey, and then... 
 
0:24:30 KS: The Lightwell Survey? 
 
0:24:31 SZ: Uh-huh. 
 
0:24:33 KS: What are we talking... 
 
 
#winery #distribution #license #wholesale 
 
0:24:34 SZ: The Lightwell Survey is the name of the winery. 
 
0:24:36 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
0:24:41 SZ: So we've got three vintages under our belts, and just became legal 'cause we 
did everything ass-backwards. 
 
0:24:46 KS: Oh. 
 
0:24:47 SZ: Yep. So our wines are available for purchase here at Primrose and a number 
of other restaurants around the city now. 
 
0:24:55 KS: Nice. 
 
0:24:56 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:25:00 KS: And are you looking to do distribution, or... I know distribution's a really 
complicated thing. 
 
0:25:03 SZ: We are distributed... 
 
0:25:04 KS: Okay. 
 
0:25:05 SZ: But we just received our commercial winery license, and we are going to be 
distributing ourselves from here on out. 
 
0:25:17 KS: Yeah, because it's better... Yeah. 
 
0:25:20 SZ: Mm-hmm. 
 
0:25:23 KS: Yeah, no, I'm glad... I mean I think that's one of the unusual things, I guess, 
about the Virginia wine industry is that because of the way the laws were and everything 
was [0:25:34] , that they... A lot of people just sold directly to the public and 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
_PM 
20 
 
thought, "Well, in the future, someday we'll distribute," and then they were like, "This is 
making us way more money, why would we... " 
 
0:25:47 SZ: Exactly. Exactly. 
 
0:25:48 KS: "Why would we distribute? I don't care if it's on every liquor store shelf, it's 
gotta be... " 
 
0:25:53 SZ: Right. "It's making me a shit ton of money." 
 
0:25:54 KS: "It's making me a shit ton of money if I sell it for 30 bucks here at the store, 
or at the location." 
 
0:26:00 SZ: Versus $15... Yeah. 
 
0:26:00 KS: Yeah, exactly. And giving wholesale pricing to somebody else for your 
wine to sit on their shelves. 
 
0:26:04 SZ: Correct. 
 
0:26:06 KS: Which is a very interesting part of it, because it's a whole new dynamic in 
America's history with alcohol, which is so crazy. So the Lightwell Survey, is that... So 
that's the name of the winery. Is there a physical thing at Early Mountain? Are you on the 
same land as Early Mountain? 
 
 
#leasedland #Waynesboro #Virginia #Charlottesville #textilemill #blacksmith 
 
0:26:30 SZ: No. So we just signed a lease in Waynesboro, Virginia, which is about 30 
miles west of Charlottesville. 
 
0:26:38 KS: Okay. 
 
0:26:38 SZ: It's a hike. 
 
0:26:40 KS: Waynesboro? 
 
0:26:40 SZ: Mm-hmm. 
 
0:26:41 KS: B-R-O... B-O-R-O? 
 
0:26:44 SZ: I think so. 
 
0:26:44 KS: Or G-H at the end? 
 
0:26:46 SZ: I don't think there's a G-H. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
21 
 
 
0:26:47 KS: If you signed the lease, you should probably know where it is. 
0:26:49 SZ: I'm just spitballing. I think it's "boro", not... I think it's "boro", just Os. 
0:26:56 SZ: Okay. 
0:26:56 SZ: I don't know. [chuckle] So it's inside a old textile mill, and it's like this weird 
artist's studio where people are doing... There's a blacksmith next to us, and it's a real 
blacksmith, like... 
 
[vocalization] 
 
0:27:13 SZ: So we have our own space inside that building. 
 
0:27:16 KS: Might sound a little more manly than that. 
 
0:27:20 SZ: Maybe. 
 
0:27:21 KS: So it's like a... [chuckle] Sorry, your impersonation of a blacksmith, I think 
it's just... 
 
0:27:27 SZ: Too effeminate for you? 
 
0:27:27 KS: It was, a little bit. 
 
0:27:30 SZ: Hmm. Any whosie-whatsies. So yeah, so there's like... 
 
0:27:34 KS: So is it like a Torpedo Factory kind of place where there's different... 
 
0:27:37 SZ: Something like that, just less nice. 
 
0:27:38 KS: Workshop-y things? 
 
 
#oldpress #winestorage #winemaking 
 
0:27:39 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's kind of a shithole, but I love that about it and we've 
got a little space in there, and right now we're gonna be storing wine there. And we've got 
some old junky press that we have to throw in there, and a couple of barrels just to make 
us legal, 'cause Virginia's funny about that kind of stuff. So you have to show that you 
can make wine so that you can get a commercial winery license. 
 
0:28:09 KS: Gotcha, gotcha. 
 
0:28:10 SZ: But we're not gonna be making wine there quite yet. But eventually we will, 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

hopefully next year, hopefully in the 2018. 
 
0:28:17 KS: So where are your grapes growing? 
 
 
#winemaking #buyinggrapes #EarlyMountain #BearRidge #CabernetFranc #Riesling 
#OxEye #altitude #Shenandoah 
 
0:28:20 SZ: Well, we made everything at Early Mountain. 
 
0:28:22 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
0:28:22 SZ: Yeah, so essentially... 
 
0:28:26 KS: So they were able to... They're all their grown grapes, or did you bring any 
grapes in? 
 
0:28:31 SZ: No. Yeah, we brought grapes from everybody, so... 
 
0:28:33 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
0:28:33 SZ: Bear Ridge, which is pretty far down south, we bought grapes from... Bear 
Ridge provided the Cabernet Franc. We bought Riesling from Ox-Eye, which is really far 
down south. 
 
0:28:46 KS: I haven't even heard of it, yeah. 
 
0:28:48 SZ: But they're pretty high altitude for Virginia, they're like 1,400 feet, maybe 
1,200, give or take. 
 
0:28:55 KS: So way southwest? 
 
0:28:56 SZ: Uh-huh. Exactly. Just follow the Shenandoah down and it gets a little high 
altitude eventually. 
 
0:29:06 KS: Yeah. 
 
 
#grapebuying #family #PetitManseng #NameMeaning #wine-growingareas 
 
0:29:06 SZ: Some of the grapes came from Ben's family. His family has a vineyard. So 
the 2015s, the Petit Manseng came from Ben's family. And yeah, we bought some grapes 
from Early Mountain also. But yeah, that's the toughest part. And that's why the word 
"survey" is in the names, because you're kinda hiking all over the damn place trying to 
find vineyards that'll sell you grapes. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
23 
 
  
 
0:29:33 KS: I think this is one of the things I've been talking about to different 
winemakers, and one of the ideas is that, yeah, it's nice to have the wine bars and the 
tasting rooms and things close into the city, because you can get the foot traffic or the car 
traffic or whatever of people coming through, but for actually growing, just the price of 
land anywhere within an hour of DC is brutal. 
 
0:30:00 SZ: Yeah, I mean when you get to that Northern Virginia area, like the wine- 
growing area...

yeah. 
 
 
#quality #RdV #Linden #vineyards #DepartmentofAgriculture #retraining #poverty 
#SWVirginia #demandforgrapes 
 
0:30:06 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like where RdV is, for example, and Linden, that shit is 
no joke. Once you start jumping a little bit further south, it's not so bad. 
 
0:30:18 KS: So this is one of the things that I just kind of play around with in my mind 
that if I could just take over the world, as I mentioned, is somehow working with the 
State Department of Agriculture to retrain maybe tobacco farmers or different kinds of 
farmers into... 
 
0:30:36 SZ: Well, that's happening. I don't know that the... I don't know that the people 
from the government are doing it but I mean there's a ton of vineyards being planted in 
Virginia. 
 
0:30:49 KS: Yeah. Because I think it's just... 
 
0:30:49 SZ: But it's not gonna be ready for five years. 
 
0:30:49 KS: Yeah. I just think there's... Yeah, it's... Everything will outgrow its space 
and then you're gonna need... But you have so much of Southwestern Virginia that could 
be potentially nice for growing grapes. 
 
0:31:00 SZ: Totally. 
 
0:31:01 KS: And it would bring a lot of benefit to that area... 
 
0:31:05 SZ: Tourism, yeah. 
 
0:31:05 KS: For sure, 'cause it's pretty desolate down there. 
 
0:31:08 SZ: Boring.

0:31:13 SZ: Broke-ass region. 
 
0:31:14 KS: It is a broke-ass region. It's really poor. There's no job opportunities. People 
don't have anything to do down there. 
 
0:31:20 SZ: Yeah. Waynesboro's pretty depressing. 
 
0:31:22 KS: Yeah. Yeah. So do you have... 
 
0:31:26 SZ: Except they have a hotdog stand, which is rad. 
 
0:31:28 KS: Oh. Well, there you go. 
 
0:31:29 SZ: I mean, a good hotdog stand? How frequently do you see that? 
 
0:31:31 KS: Not often. 
 
0:31:32 SZ: Nope. 
 
0:31:32 KS: Nope. Not in this day and age. 
 
0:31:34 SZ: I mean like $1.75 a hotdog? Fucking great. 
 
0:31:37 KS: So, why haven't you just transplanted your life there? 
 
0:31:41 SZ: It's too far away. 
 
0:31:42 KS: That's far, right. That's Virginia. 
 
0:31:44 SZ: No. I mean our goal is to buy a property in Virginia. That Bear Ridge 
Vineyard, where we get the Cabernet from, is up for sale. It's like 40 acres though. 
 
0:31:56 KS: That's not much. 
 
0:31:58 SZ: 40 acres? It's a lot. 
 
0:32:00 KS: Not much if you wanna make a business out of it. It's close enough to 
Charlottesville? 
 
0:32:09 SZ: A half-hour. 
 
0:32:11 KS: That might work. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
25 
 
0:32:12 SZ: Yeah, definitely. 
 
0:32:15 KS: How much is they selling it for? 
 
0:32:17 SZ: I wanna say like 400 grand, which is like nothing. 
 
0:32:21 KS: That's nothing. 
 
0:32:21 SZ: That's what I'm saying. Down there the properties are not expensive. 
 
0:32:26 KS: Let's buy it. 
 
0:32:27 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:32:27 KS: Let's go. 
 
 
#investment #sellwine #makingmoney #debt #planning 
 
0:32:28 SZ: I think we need to sell some wine. I think my brother is like, "Hey, we're 
like 100 grand deep, and I haven't seen no dollars." 
 
0:32:36 KS: Yeah. Well, like what they say, "If you wanna make a small fortune, put a 
big fortune into wine." 
 
0:32:42 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:32:43 KS: Yes. 
 
0:32:44 SZ: Yeah, they do. 
 
0:32:48 KS: Okay. So you're in Waynesboro. 
 
0:32:51 SZ: Yep. 
 
0:32:51 KS: You have a leased space in this odd textile mill, blacksmith shop in 
Waynesboro where they have good hotdogs. 
 
0:33:00 SZ: Uh-huh. 
 
0:33:00 KS: And then... So is that gonna be... That's where it's gonna be like a tasting 
room where people can come in or just buy? 
 
0:33:07 SZ: I don't know. We haven't really figured that out yet. 
 
0:33:09 KS: Okay. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
26 
 
 
0:33:09 SZ: So much like the last bit of the plans, were sort of just spitballing. 
 
0:33:15 KS: Okay. [chuckle] Alright, then. 
 
0:33:17 SZ: I sort of live my life that way. 
 
0:33:18 KS: I'm catching on to this. Okay. So then... In your imagination, where is this 
going? Eventually, you would like to buy more land down there... 
 
0:33:31 SZ: Eventually, I would love to have a physical space, a physical winery, 
whether that includes a vineyard or not, I don't know, but it would be great to have a 
place where we make wine. That's my little guy right there. Oh no, that's a girl. He looks 
like a girl. He's got long hair. I love kids on a rope. [He points to kids at the day care 
across the street.] 
 
0:33:58 KS: I know, it's pretty good. 
 
0:34:00 SZ: It's pretty good. 
 
0:34:01 KS: I like it when they have those carts too. They're like four kids across. 
 
 
#longtermplan #winery #vineyard #family #homebasedbusiness #wife #restaurantdesign 
 
0:34:05 SZ: Yeah, it's good. So yeah, the goal is to eventually have a winery, and make 
our wine there, and I would like to live there. 
 
0:34:17 KS: Oh really? 
 
0:34:18 SZ: Yeah. I don't... I could see myself spending four days a week in the city and 
three days a week out there, or vice-versa. I prefer it vice-versa. 
 
0:34:33 KS: So what would you see it like? You'd have the restaurant here and things 
going on here, and would your wife and son live down there full-time? 
 
0:34:40 SZ: No... 
 
0:34:40 KS: Or would you both... 
 
0:34:41 SZ: She's got her on business, so that wouldn't work.

0:34:44 SZ: She is a restaurant designer.

0:34:47 KS: Oh, fabulous! Yes, I guess you did tell me that. Restaurant designer. 
 
0:34:51 SZ: And architect, yeah. 
 
0:34:52 KS: And architect? 
 
0:34:53 SZ: More architect/restaurant designer. She builds other shit. 
 
0:34:58 KS: Okay. Good girl. What's her name? 
 
0:35:01 SZ: Lauren Winter. 
 
0:35:04 KS: Winter. Okay, so... Where am I with this? Just we're not following any of 
my normal ways of doing things. [chuckle] 
 
0:35:18 SZ: That's alright. 
 
0:35:18 KS: So what's the hardest part about winemaking? 
 
 
#challenges #winemaking #sommelier #nature #risks #farming 
 
0:35:21 SZ: You're at the whim of nature and being a sommelier, you're always like, 
"Oh, that's crazy." But until you're actually involved in making wine and half of your shit 
gets destroyed by hail, you don't really take it too seriously. It's like hearing about the 
wildfires in California. You're like, "Oh, that sucks," until your friend calls you and 
they're like, "Everything I've ever owned just burned in the fucking flames." 
 
0:35:51 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:35:52 SZ: And you're like, "Oh." 
0:35:54 KS: Did that happen to... 
0:35:55 SZ: No. 
0:35:55 SZ: Anybody you know? 
 
0:35:57 SZ: Not yet. 
 
0:35:57 KS: Yeah. But you're... Yeah, my friend grew up in Santa Rosa, and her whole, 
not her family home, but the neighborhoods and everything around her all burned up. 
 
0:36:10 SZ: It's wild. 
 
0:36:12 KS: It has been wild. So yeah, and it's particularly challenging with weather 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

patterns and climate change and all of these things. 
 
0:36:17 SZ: Yeah. So the Syrah that we bought last year from Early Mountain got 
completely destroyed by hail last year, so we didn't get any Syrah. 
 
0:36:26 KS: So you have to just re-calculate your plans for what you wanna do and... 
 
 
#adaptability #creativity #wineblend #aromaticboost #Syrah #Riesling #winemaking 
#aromatics 
 
0:36:30 SZ: Totally. And you have to figure out another way. So we didn't get to make a 
wine, it's called "Los Idiots". That is probably our most creative wine. It's a 
Riesling/Syrah split. We didn't get to make it this past year. 
 
0:36:42 KS: Riesling and Syrah? 
 
0:36:44 SZ: Yeah, 51% Syrah, 49% Riesling. 
 
0:36:49 KS: That is different. 
 
0:36:51 SZ: It is different. 
 
0:36:53 KS: Has anyone done that before? 
 
0:36:53 SZ: Not that I know of. Not that dramatic. People put white grapes in red wine 
all the time to boost aromatics and stuff like that, but this is a deliberate attempt on a half 
and half. 
 
0:37:05 KS: So my friend, who's also a sommelier, was talking about how you have in 
wine making, you have this post-production work that you can do, and then there's like 
what's coming off the vines; how you combine it and what you grow and what's going on 
with it and what the levels of different things are, flavor-wise, and then there's the 
manipulations that happen after the fact. 
 
0:37:39 SZ: Yeah. 
 
[chuckle] 
 
0:37:41 KS: Why do you shake your head? 
 
#NaturalWine #manipulation #winemaking #noaddedsugar #yeast #terroir #filtration 
 
0:37:41 SZ: Well, it's an I-own-a-natural-wine-bar, so I am against manipulation in 
general. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
29 
 
0:37:47 KS: Okay. 
 
0:37:50 SZ: And the wines that we make are not manipulated. 
 
0:37:55 KS: Can you describe what that means? 
 
0:37:58 SZ: It means exactly what it is. So... 
 
0:38:00 KS: But to somebody who doesn't know what you're talking about? 
 
0:38:03 SZ: Okay, so for example, when I moved to California, the first thing that I was 
made to do was climb up a ladder and dump a bag of sugar in the wine. And I was like, 
"But why?" And you learned very quickly that people dump sugar, people dump acid, 
people dump grape juice, people dump all kinds of shit. I mean utilizing a specific kind of 
yeast strain is manipulation. If you're using a champagne yeast, you're trying to get a 
certain flavor out of that wine. So natural wine is literally avoiding all of that stuff. To 
utilize what is known as ambient yeast is just yeast that exists in that particular place. 
Now, of course, that yeast was, at some point... 
 
0:38:45 KS: Came from somewhere. 
 
0:38:45 SZ: Came from somewhere, but there's no fining, no filtration, there's no 
acidification, no chaptalization, all of those "-tions". There's no... 
 
[chuckle] 
 
0:38:58 KS: What was the last "-tion" you said? 
 
0:39:01 SZ: Chaptalization, adding sugar. 
 
0:39:03 KS: Chaptalization? 
 
0:39:05 SZ: Chaptalization. 
0:39:09 KS: Okay, so spell. 
0:39:09 SZ: Chaptal. 
0:39:10 KS: Like "capital", but "chaptal"? 
 
0:39:11 SZ: Yep. -Ization. [chuckle] That's my spelling. 
 
0:39:17 KS: That's the adding sugar part. 
 
0:39:18 SZ: That's the adding sugar part. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
30 
 
0:39:19 KS: Okay. So your ideas, and this is something that's quite popular now in 
Europe as well, is the natural wine thing, but it's not really terribly big here in the US. 
 
0:39:33 SZ: No. 
 
 
#philsophy #naturalwine #organic #pesticides #bio-dynamic 
0:39:34 KS: What's your philosophy about why it's good, good-er? 
0:39:40 SZ: It is good-er just like organic food is good-er. 
0:39:44 KS: Okay. 
 
0:39:45 SZ: Just like avoiding putting pesticides in your body is good-er. 
 
0:39:51 KS: But it's not the same as organic. 
 
0:39:53 SZ: Yes, it is. The grapes have to be farmed either organically or bio- 
dynamically. 
 
0:39:58 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
0:40:00 SZ: It's specifically what you were talking about. It's the post-production work, 
where it's really kind of kicked around, wine is. But yeah, in order to be a natural wine, 
you have to be farmed organically or bio-dynamically as well. 
 
0:40:18 KS: Is that what they're doing at Early Mountain? 
 
0:40:20 SZ: No. So that's part of the problem is that it's somewhat unavoidable in 
Virginia right now. 
 
0:40:29 KS: So it's the fungicides, isn't that really mostly what it is? It's not so much 
pesticides, but just 'cause of the moisture Virginia are really susceptible to. 
 
#organicchallenges #risk #BlackAnkleVineyards #Maryland #quality #vineyard #dream 
 
0:40:40 SZ: Yeah, and you don't see a lot of desire to do that, desire to push it, because 
it's dangerous. And so people are protecting themselves, which I understand totally. I 
mean it's very, very difficult to think about the potential for your entire crop to get ruined 
because you decided you wanna be organic. But there are people that do it; Black Ankle 
in particular in Maryland. 
 
0:41:10 KS: Black Ankle? 
 
0:41:10 SZ: Black Ankle. And they make some of the best wines around. Maryland, 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
31 
 
oddly enough, has... I don't know why I said "oddly enough", but there are some really 
fantastic wineries in Maryland. 
 
0:41:22 KS: Did you do research? Did you go talk to a bunch of vineyard people, or was 
it just your experience between designing wine programs at different restaurants and 
helping open up these different restaurants, and what you did when you were in 
California that led you to, "I need to make my own wine"? 
 
0:41:45 SZ: Yeah, I mean it was always a dream. So here we are, living the dream. 
[chuckle] 
0:41:53 KS: Living the dream. I love it. Okay. So, eventually, you would like to try to 
grow organically, or do you think that you have to just put up with a little bit of on the 
side? 
 
0:42:03 SZ: We'll see what Ben says. 
 
0:42:06 KS: Yeah. And Ben's background is what? 
 
 
#partnership #Charlottesville #winemaker #amaro #family #relationship 
 
0:42:08 SZ: Ben made wine in California as well. He learned how to make wine at 
Anthill Farms, which is one of the better producers of Pinot Noir in the country. When he 
told me that, I knew he was the right partner. 
 
0:42:28 KS: And you're also friends? 
 
0:42:30 SZ: We are buddies. We met for that rosé project and I brought some amaro that 
I was making at that given time. And he was like, "I make amaro." And so we tasted our 
amaros together. And he has two babies that are almost exactly the same age as my 
babies. And he is... I think we're almost the same age. So we just had a lot of things going 
for our relationship right off the bat. And he's a creative kid, and so... 
 
0:43:04 KS: He's also based around here? 
0:43:06 SZ: No. He lives in Charlottesville. 
0:43:07 KS: Oh, he lives in Charlottesville. 
0:43:10 SZ: And so, it was sort of a natural project. It was totally organic. 
 
0:43:19 KS: You're really into this organic thing that's happening. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
32 
 
0:43:20 SZ: Yeah. I do like things just happening the way they would. 
 
0:43:23 KS: Yeah. Which can be a little tricky for big investments and things that take 
years to grow and stuff like that. 
 
0:43:34 SZ: And relationships. 
 
0:43:35 KS: All the things. 
 
0:43:36 SZ: All the things. 
 
0:43:38 KS: Okay, let me see what else is in here. What do you see happening in 
Virginia wine as someone who's... 
 
0:43:48 SZ: What do I see or what would I like to see? 
 
0:43:50 KS: Both, either. 
 
 
#Virginia #wine #industry #changes #growth #buyinggrapes #DC #winecountry 
#ThePlains #friedchicken #wealthypeople 
 
0:43:52 SZ: So the industry is growing rapidly, but there's not a lot of... As far as I know, 
we're the only people doing what we're doing. And what I mean by that is we're not 
growing grapes, we're buying grapes, and we're making wine at a facility that is not ours, 
which is extremely common in California, extremely. So I would like to see that happen 
more frequently, but it's not an easy road. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to do 
it. So I'd like to see the laws sort of lighten up. But Virginia doesn't seem terribly excited 
about people coming in from outside the state and sort of winging it and just kind of 
having fun. So yeah, I would like to see the laws loosen up a little bit. And I really hope 
that DC sort of wakes up to the fact that they have a wine country like 45 minutes away. 
It's pretty damn cool, and it's really stunningly beautiful, and there's some really cool 
little towns out there. The Plains is like the cutest little town ever. 
 
0:45:05 KS: It is, yeah. 
 
0:45:06 SZ: The gas station has amazing fried chicken. 
 
0:45:09 KS: The gas station in The Plains. 
 
0:45:12 SZ: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really good. 
 
0:45:14 KS: Oh, alright. 
 
0:45:16 SZ: They make big bad spicy chicken sandwiches. I mean they're total dog shit, 
but they're amazing. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
33 
 
 
0:45:18 KS: Yeah. Oh, I'm gonna have to try that then. 
 
0:45:21 SZ: You should, it's great. And then that little Italian deli across the street, which 
is ridiculously overpriced, but quite delicious. 
 
0:45:26 KS: Yeah. Well, when your neighbors are like Mrs. Fleischmann from 
Fleischmann Yeast Company... 
 
0:45:33 SZ: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Steve and Jean Case. [chuckle] They don't 
care. Exactly. 
 
[overlapping conversation] 
 
0:45:36 KS: They don't know. They don't know how much things cost. They're like, 
"Whatever. $27? Sure." 
 
[overlapping conversation] 
 
 
#sustainablegrowth #wineries #Virginia #vineyard #turnover #thinningtheherd #quality 
#hobby #wealth #dabblers 
 
0:45:40 SZ: "Just picking this up in my Lamborghini." I see the industry itself really 
expanding pretty rapidly. I don't know how much more rapid it could be. I mean the 
wineries are popping up really quickly now. It seems sustainable at this juncture. I mean, 
winery sales have risen every year dramatically. 
 
0:46:14 KS: Well, I think for people who have been in it for a long time, they sort of 
have this... The people who I've talked to who have been in it longer have had this sort 
of... They're like, "Well, if they're not meant to be in it, it won't work out, and then 
someone else will buy their vineyard and do a better job." So they see it all like the 
people who are just thinking of it as a fun hobby or something will eventually... The herd 
will thin out and more quality people will... 
 
0:46:43 SZ: There's a lot of people that think it's a hobby. That's always been the 
problem of Virginia, actually. There's a reason why there's a lot of dubious vineyards and 
dubious wineries is because it's a wealthy state and there's a lot of wealthy people there 
and there's a lot of people who are just like, "Man, I wish I had a winery," and so they 
just threw a bunch of shit in the ground and were like, "Oh, this grows." 
 
0:47:09 KS: Right. 
 
0:47:10 SZ: But they don't have great wine makers and they didn't find their site well. 
 
0:47:13 KS: Yeah. They maybe didn't even know what they were supposed to be doing... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
34 
 
 
0:47:17 SZ: No, they definitely know. 
 
0:47:18 KS: What they were supposed to be looking for or testing soil or whatever. 
 
0:47:21 SZ: Correct. Everybody should go to the school of Jim Law and listen to Jim 
Law. And Jim Law should just teach... 
 
0:47:25 KS: I know. Everyone loves Jim Law so much.

0:47:27 SZ: I mean he's amazing. The wines that he makes are amazing. So if you have 
that opportunity right in front of you to learn from someone who really gives a shit, you 
should take it. [chuckle] He teaches. You can do an internship with him for two years. He 
was gonna let me do it for one year, and I had to open right then, and I was like, "Gosh, 
that would have been awesome." 
 
0:47:50 KS: Yeah, I need to interview him. 
 
0:47:53 SZ: That's where the guys from RdV learned. 
 
0:47:55 KS: Yeah, and they do great stuff. 
 
0:47:57 SZ: Yeah, they do. Just costs a lot of money. 
 
0:48:00 KS: Yeah it does. That's the thing, I mean, there's some good Virginia wines, but 
the ones that are pretty good do cost a lot, and I could... 
 
0:48:12 SZ: Mine don't. 
 
0:48:13 KS: How much are you selling yours for? 
 
0:48:16 SZ: My high-end wine is on my list at 60 bucks. 
 
0:48:18 KS: Okay. But still, that's not everyday drinking wine. 
 
0:48:22 SZ: My less expensive wine is 50 bucks. At a restaurant, that's pretty cheap. 
 
0:48:27 KS: Oh, at a restaurant? Oh yeah. 
 
0:48:28 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:48:28 KS: But if I was gonna buy it... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
35 
 
 
0:48:30 SZ: How much it would sell in the store, I think it's like 24? 
0:48:33 KS: Okay. That I could do. [chuckle] I could talk myself into that. 
0:48:37 SZ: Yeah. 
0:48:37 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:48:38 SZ: Making wine ain't cheap. 
 
0:48:38 KS: No, I know. 
 
[chuckle] 
 
0:48:40 SZ: Especially in Virginia. 
 
0:48:40 KS: I know, I get it, but I think that's the big thing that everybody debates over is 
the price per bottle. 
 
0:48:50 SZ: Oh it's ridiculous. I mean the thing is, they know they're gonna sell it. 
 
0:48:58 KS: Yeah. That's what's so surprising is... So I did an interview at Barrel Oak, 
which is sort of a... You're making a face, stop it. 
 
0:49:10 SZ: No, I'm not. I didn't make a face. 
 
0:49:11 KS: No, you didn't make a face? 
 
0:49:11 SZ: No. 
 
0:49:13 KS: But it's like a big-box store of wine kind of place and they know it. I mean I 
don't think they have any...

0:49:28 KS: Yeah, cornhole.

afc2017/017
36 
 
 
0:49:28 SZ: They have like 35 cornhole boards. 
0:49:30 KS: They do. They have a lot of cornhole. 
0:49:32 SZ: It's buses and buses and buses of people. 
0:49:34 KS: It makes me uncomfortable saying that word too, "cornhole". It's just a gross 
word. It sounds gross. 
 
0:49:38 SZ: It's a fun game though. 
 
0:49:40 KS: Anyway, but I think they... When I interviewed folks there, they were 
saying they run out of wine. They sell out completely. They don't even have time to age 
wine or do anything because they are barely able... And they bring in grapes from 
California and all of these different places... 
 
0:50:00 SZ: So insane. 
 
0:50:01 KS: And they still sell out of everything they have. 
 
0:50:04 SZ: Have you been on the grounds there? 
 
0:50:04 KS: Oh, yeah. 
 
0:50:04 SZ: It's fucking incredible. 
 
0:50:06 KS: It's huge. 
 
0:50:06 SZ: It's like a castle. 
 
0:50:07 KS: It's like Disney World of wine place. 
 
0:50:10 SZ: Yeah, it's weird as shit. 
 
0:50:11 KS: Yeah. So... 
 
0:50:14 SZ: That place is like $10 million. 
 
0:50:16 KS: I can believe it. They've just opened a brewery as well... 
 
0:50:20 SZ: Of course. 
 
0:50:20 KS: On site. 
 
0:50:22 SZ: Why not? 
Winery Workers in Virginia

0:50:27 SZ: Yeah, they're selling like $40 Petit Verdot and they can't keep it. 
 
0:50:31 KS: Yeah. 
 
0:50:32 SZ: All of them are.

0:51:12 KS: Okay. [chuckle] 
 
0:51:14 SZ: They're on the top of the Shenandoah Mountains. I guess they're called the 
Blue Ridge Mountains, right? 
 
0:51:24 KS: We have both mountains. We have Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. 
0:51:28 SZ: Yeah, I guess I would assume they're on the top of the Shenandoah then. 
0:51:31 KS: Okay. 
0:51:31 SZ: I think they're on the other side of it. I should know this, I sell their wine. 
Anyways, this stuff is awesome. 
 
0:51:39 KS: Okay. 
 
0:51:40 SZ: You Google it. 
 
0:51:41 KS: And they do... You said they do Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, which just is 
so weird for this area. 
 
0:51:45 SZ: Yeah it's pretty cool.

have an opinion on it or anything.

0:52:24 SZ: You see some Syrah. I would love to see more Syrah planted 'cause I think it 
would do well.

so good.

most romantic thing ever. There's really nothing romantic about it. It's a shitload of work. 
I mean it's romantic when you're drinking your own wine and that's cool, that's super rad. 
 
0:53:28 KS: Yeah, it's great to be able to make something and grow it and then combine 
it and do it... 
 
0:53:32 SZ: Consume it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 
0:53:33 KS: Yeah, it's amazing. 
 
0:53:34 SZ: It's like growing pot and then smoking it. It's pretty rad.

0:53:36 KS: I've done hard cider, that's... And then even that I didn't do everything start 
to finish, but it was really fun. 
 
0:53:43 SZ: Yeah. 
 
0:53:44 KS: And then you're like, "Yes, we made this! It tastes awesome!" 
 
0:53:45 SZ: "We made this," and that's pretty cool. That's the romantic part about it. 
 
0:53:50 KS: Yeah. But the reality is... 
 
0:53:53 SZ: The reality is it's a shit ton of work, and it's really hard, and it's really 
expensive. 
 
0:53:58 KS: And risky. 
 
0:53:58 SZ: And risky. And when you're pulling hoses all over winery floor and it's 50 
degrees and wet... 
 
0:54:09 KS: That seems to me the most disagreeable part of it. It gets really cold in those 
rooms and on the hard floor... 
 
0:54:17 SZ: Yeah, I mean you're harvesting in... [0:54:19] 
harvesting in August, 
but in general, you should be harvesting in September, October when it's pretty damn 
cold and... 
 
0:54:27 KS: But also bringing it in and processing and doing all that stuff in these cold 
spaces, yeah. 
 
0:54:32 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0:54:32 KS: Damp, musky, funky. 
0:54:34 SZ: Yep. 
0:54:35 KS: But you like funky. 
 
0:54:37 SZ: I do.

0:54:38 KS: So what would be your dream wine that you would be able to make 
yourself, like barring nature [chuckle] and actual possibility? What would you love to be 
able to grow?

0:54:50 SZ: I would love to be able to grow Pinot. I love Pinot Noir. It's delicious. 
 
0:54:57 KS: Merry Edwards, she does a nice Pinot Noir. 
 
0:55:01 SZ: She does. 
 
0:55:05 KS: Dream. And where do you see yourself with this in the future? 
0:55:14 SZ: Splitting my time between here and the winery, I hope. [chuckle] 
0:55:20 KS: If everything goes nice. 
0:55:24 SZ: Assuming everything goes according to plan. But I got to set both things up 
at the same time. I launched both businesses within three weeks of each other, so I'm at 
least on the right trajectory. And my wines are selling like gangbusters, so... 
 
0:55:40 KS: Oh, great. 
 
0:55:41 SZ: That's good. 
 
0:55:42 KS: So how much did you produce? 
 
0:55:44 SZ: First year was like 300, 250 cases. The second year was 350. This year it 
will probably be around like 425. I hope that we could... 
 
0:56:00 KS: That's a good amount for Virginia production. I mean some of these places, 
they don't make that much. 
 
0:56:05 SZ: Right. It's just all about where we're gonna find the grapes. 
 
0:56:09 KS: Yeah. So you would like to see that keeping pace and increasing year to 
year. 
 
0:56:14 SZ: I'd love to get to a few thousand cases so it's actually a sustainable business, 
so that I can consider it to be an income. 
 
0:56:22 KS: Yeah. Are you holding stuff back to age at all?

#loophole 
 
0:56:25 SZ: Well, we didn't become label until this year, [chuckle] so we actually have 
two vintages in bottle already. So we're not holding it, so to speak, but...

0:56:33 KS: Right. You didn't have a choice. 
 
0:56:33 SZ: We're stupid. [chuckle] 
 
0:56:36 KS: So the state of Virginia decided that you were going to age your wine a little 
longer? 
 
0:56:40 SZ: No, we did. We just never even did the paperwork in the first place. But yes, 
the actual paperwork ended up taking a better part of the year, so yeah. But we're selling 
it now, so it's good. 
 
0:56:50 KS: Yeah. I mean do you think that's... Besides cost, which is obviously a huge 
threshold for most people, is it the regulation that is the biggest kind of hindrance or pain 
in the neck? 
 
0:57:02 SZ: Totally. 
 
0:57:03 KS: Yeah. And what in particular is the part of it that's so trying? 
 
0:57:11 SZ: The part that you can't control the destiny of your wine unless you have a 
commercial winery license. Otherwise you have to sell it through a distributor and 
basically not make any money. So the only way you can control like... The only way that 
we are capable or will be capable of selling our wine to both private consumers and 
restaurants is by getting a commercial winery license. The only way you're able to do that 
is by finding a space that has correct drainage, has winery equipment, shit like that. 
 
0:57:48 KS: Mm-hmm. So you have to check off all these boxes. Whether or not there's 
actually winemaking happening there is a minor detail? 
 
0:57:56 SZ: It's a bit of a loophole. Yeah, it's a bit of a loophole. 
 
0:57:58 KS: That's funny. 
 
0:58:00 SZ: Gotta find loopholes. Otherwise it doesn't work. 
 
0:58:04 KS: Like our president says. So... 
[laughter] 
0:58:07 SZ: I think he says "Gotta find the holes." 
 
0:58:09 KS: Right. And I think I've gotten most everything I need to get from you. Is 
there anything else that you... I mean, so you're also a papa? When do you have time to 
look at your child or see your wife?

0:58:26 SZ: Right now there's not a whole lot of that, but there will be, eventually. We 
knew it was gonna be tough time, so... 
 
0:58:31 KS: Right. And so you feel like balancing all of this stuff is possible, good? 
 
0:58:38 SZ: It'll pay dividends, I hope. 
 
0:58:40 KS: Yeah. Could you be any other way? I don't think so. Maybe. 
 
0:58:44 SZ: No, I gotta have a lot of stuff going on at all times. 
 
0:58:47 KS: That's good. That's the feeling that I get from you. I see sticks with plates. 
 
0:58:50 SZ: Yeah, I mean there's already six plans for the next six places. 
[chuckle] 
0:58:57 KS: Well, what would those be? Are there restaurants that you wanna open? 
 
0:59:00 SZ: Yeah. I wanna do... I didn't mean to open a restaurant. I meant to open a 
wine bar. So I wanna actually open a wine bar. I wanna open a bakery. 
 
0:59:09 KS: 'Cause I feel like you said something about this... 
 
0:59:13 SZ: Most likely. 
 
0:59:13 KS: Maybe at Johnny's dinner... 
 
0:59:15 SZ: It could be. 
 
0:59:16 KS: At [0:59:16] 
? 
 
0:59:17 SZ: Yeah, it could be. 
 
0:59:18 KS: I think a wine bar or something like that. 
 
0:59:20 SZ: Well, this was supposed to be wine bar, but it's just too big. 
 
0:59:23 KS: Is there any place in DC that's featuring all regional wines, like bringing in 
stuff from all the different Maryland, Virginia producers, or... I mean I know some places 
tried to at least have stuff included on their menu, but...

0:59:41 SZ: Not that I know of. I tried. That's what I tried with Early Mountain. I was 
like, "You pay for it, I'll do a Virginia wine bar." [chuckle] 
 
0:59:50 KS: "I'll make it great." 
 
0:59:51 SZ: "I'll feature all Virginia... " 
 
0:59:53 KS: "There'll be ostrich feathers." 
 
0:59:55 SZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it has to be some sort of bird from Virginia. 
 
0:59:57 KS: Pheasant? 
 
1:00:00 SZ: Sure. 
 
1:00:00 KS: Turkey. 
 
1:00:00 SZ: Turkey. 
 
1:00:00 KS: We have a lot of turkeys. 
 
1:00:02 SZ: I'll just hang turkey vultures upside down and then put lights on them. 
 
1:00:06 KS: That would be a very goth bar. 
 
1:00:07 SZ: Yeah. I was goth. 
1:00:09 KS: That would be intense. 
1:00:10 SZ: Yeah. 
1:00:10 KS: Were you? 
 
1:00:11 SZ: Yeah. I was all things. 
 
1:00:13 KS: Yeah. 
 
1:00:14 SZ: Yeah. 
 
1:00:14 KS: You tried 'em all out? 
 
1:00:15 SZ: I did. 
 
1:00:15 KS: Yeah. So, in your family, was wine a thing? 
Winery Workers in Virginia

1:00:21 SZ: Nope. 
 
1:00:21 KS: You have any history with wine before or... 
 
1:00:26 SZ: Nope. 
 
1:00:26 KS: No. Just completely, this was your... 
 
1:00:28 SZ: It was my... 
 
1:00:29 KS: If your path hadn't crossed with Nectar, who knows where you'd be.

1:00:33 SZ: Well I mean, when I got out of art school, I was like, "This isn't gonna 
work." [chuckle] And so I found a creative side inside of restaurants. 
 
1:00:40 KS: Yeah. What is it about restaurant work and the winemaking work that gives 
you outlet for creative? 
 
1:00:50 SZ: Well, I'm pretty bipolar. I'm completely bipolar. 
[chuckle] 
1:00:54 KS: Yeah. Can you just be a little bit? [laughter] 
 
1:00:56 SZ: Yeah, it can be kinda... I'm just kinda bipolar. So restaurants are also 
bipolar. 
 
1:01:01 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
1:01:02 SZ: So it fits well, generally, except when we're both in bad moods. 
 
1:01:07 KS: Right. 
 
1:01:10 SZ: And I hate to say this 'cause it sounds really snobby, but... Just the way I 
said snobby sounded snobby. But it's sort of like a curator job. You're explaining other 
people's art. And I grew up reading comic books and always liked the weird ones. And I 
grew up intensely attached to music, which I still am. And I always liked the weird shit, 
lots of punk rock and lots of indie rock and stuff like that. And so for me, I just went 
down that path with wine. I had found the really creative side of it. I found the people that 
are doing really weird stuff and it excites me. So same kind of process. When I was in the 
art school, I did some really weird shit.

[laughter] 
 
1:02:00 KS: And now you can put it in a bottle. 
 
1:02:02 SZ: Yeah, exactly. Now I can make really bizarre wines and... 
 
1:02:06 KS: What is kinda interesting to think about, I mean the way you experience art 
versus the way that you experience something like food or wine that you can consume, is 
that whole other... 
 
1:02:18 SZ: Layer. 
 
1:02:20 KS: Phenomenological experience that happens besides... You can go look at 
something in a gallery, but you can't eat it, [chuckle] you can't smell it, taste it, have 
energy from it and all of that. Very cool. Alright, anything you wanted to add? 
 
1:02:39 SZ: Not that I can think of. 
 
1:02:41 KS: Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. 
 
1:02:43 SZ: My pleasure. 
 
1:02:44 KS: We did one hour, two minutes. 
 
1:02:47 SZ: Wow. Nailed it. 
 
1:02:48 KS: Yeah, pretty good. Alright, I'm gonna turn this one off.
