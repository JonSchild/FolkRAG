BONNIE BL^I2 - field,, crker, part-ti 
r c 
in beginning fieldwork in the Hispanic communities in* the Pinelan ds 
National Rejerva, .y was =ortunate to have had a few names to call to 
start with, referred to me by Nary Huffcrd who knew of then from her 
prior experiences in the area. 
It is always -. b.-1t awkward to be an 
outsider to a place and to approach strangers with a list of what may 
for their, be ver- personal questions, and this awkwardness is even more 
complex when i' involves a negotiation: of 'the rules of Anglo-Hispanic 
politeness. 
T.r,,, situation is more delicate still if -the inqu;-rer re-
presents the go -- m 
errent and is inquiring among people who have reasons 
to want to avoid government inquiry into their activities; this is by 
no.means the ca:a? of Hispanics or Puerto aicans as a group, or even 
of Hispanics in -the Pinelands - but it. i, often the case wit-.h Foorer 
, 
people e.who are using every strategem -to mane ends meet, and many of 
the area's Hisp i-nics do f^11 into that- category. 
The first t.,vo people I contacted referred me to others to wnom 
they thought I should spe- - 
, 
so the chain of referrals begari which 
is the basis of fruitful field interviewing. 
Orlando Torres, w:ho w 
s 
very forthcoming and willing to speak at length on a. wide range of to-
pics, referred me to 
^wee other people, in ;,he Ch-ats%,orth area, whc 
all also nappenr.d to be siblings of his. 
I did not set in tough :1i th 
any 
of them, as it tarried out. 
As a part- tir:e f 
,-eldworkel on a short-
-term. project, I wanted to make the mcst of my scant time to try to 
get some kind of impression of a number of Hispanic communities in the 
Pines area, so I chose not to follow sap on Orlando's referrals right 
away beca.•_,se 1 (:,.dn't want to end up with an extended family study 
instead of the more, general survey. 
As starting points for towns in 
which I had no names or referrals, I went through the telephone books, 
looking; under a number of English and Spanish key words for organi-
zations, clubs, or agencies which might be likely to serve Hispanic 
groups. 
This search netted me the Hispanic Association. of Atlantic 
County, in Lakewood, the Puerto Rican Social Action Club, in Vineland, 
and the Puerto Rican Civic Association in Hammonton_. 
I also called 
Msgr. Reynolds, on the advice of Jens Lurid, and he gave me names of 
priests in the area who conducted Spanish masses in certain townp, and/ 
or who had been involved in Hispanic activities in the Camden Diccese. 
All of these turned out to be entry points, and all had the_­ 
limitations as to which parts of the Hispanic porj lation they wot_id 
lead to. 
Offic :al social service agencies , 
'such as the one in Li.,
-1:e-
wood, tend to refer the researcher to.other.agencies like themselves 
and to their heads or more active staffpeople. 
These people are like-
ly to 1e eery politically conscious, well educated, quite fluent :Ln 
both Spanish and English, vefy dedicated to th:. 
'-,etter?-:Ent of th( 1c 
of Hispanics in their area, aria fairly angll'17- 
- 
at- least in C('.rt in 
respects. 
They are well a'aare that becoming anglicized is ofterl syn-
onymous with becoming educated and/or becoming more economically and 
socially comfortable. 
They have thought a great deal a'Oout the prob-
lems Hispanics face in their towns, and have a lot to say on the sub-
ject. 
It is not unusual to find that they can't refer you to-someone 
else to talk to in the community who isn't in a position very similar 
to their own; they find it problematic that so many Hispanics are "un-
educated, and don't really feel that an uneducated member of the commu-
nity can further your research effort significantly. 
I did not succeed 
in getting a single non-agency-staff name in this way. 
The Catholic church is an invaluable resource in working with a 
population with a high percentage of Catholics, but like the social 
service agencies, they have their own fish to fry, and their perspec-
tive is a very particular Ione. 
They are a very well-organized insti-
tution, however, and can supply a tremendous amount of background in-
n 
, 
formation for a community - history, problems, changes, leaders,
-and 
so on. 
Msgr. Reynolds and the priests to whom he referred me were ex-
tremely helpful in this regard. 
In addition, local priests can often 
give the names of local lay community leiders - people who are active 
in church groups and in other organized, but non-church, social activi-
ties. 
In Hammonton, I found the same reluctance on the part of the 
priest to refer me to community members gs I had found in Lakewood 
in the social service agency, and for the same reason - he couldn't 
think of anyone who was really "educated.. 
enough to be what he thought 
of as truly informative. 
Fortuna rely, I had gotten a few names

he agreed that one of them, anyway, was probably well worth talking; to, 
and after he checked with the man (who had an unpublished telephone 
number) he gave me his number and said he had told him that T •
,.rould 
call. 
Perhaps he was also trying to protect his charges from a bother-
some outsider in hi s hesitation to recommend people to me; ma.:-
'-es Sense. 
The Civic Pssociation and Social Action Club gave yet another, 
perspective on the Hispanic co::•unities. 
These are self-organized, 
self-maintained clubs which are dedicated to bettering the situation 
of Puerto Ricans in their towns, and to promoting better relations 
between the Hispanics and the rest of the town, as well as to celebrat-
ing Hispanic heritage and sponsoring L-crd. ; Latin-style social events. 
They are the grass-roots service organizations, and they have a more 
down-to-earth, less beleagy4ud.approach to their goals. 
Members. will 
by definition be those people in the community who are very dedicated 
to helping others, to maintaining their heritage and passing it on to 
their children, to recognizing the common thread in all their difficul-
ties and helping newcomers who are facing the same hardships that they 
themselves have been through in the past. 
They will also be -those who 
have some time - either because of present unemployment or partial em-
ployment, or because their financial situation is secure enougi t".at 
work doesn't occupy their every waking moment - and .are willing tc, de--
vote that time to these sorts of pursuits. 
A strong sense of Hispanic 
identity and pride of heritage typifies these clubs and their social 
and charitable events. 
Many more people are beneficiaries and sc^-e-
time participants`in club activities than are actual dues-paying mem-
bers; t,-:e event; become a sort of focal point for Hispanic identi ty 
and pride, and sometimes a display c.-
L" 
that identity and pride to Lhe 
larger community - as during 7uei"to 
-Z`' lcan week, or the Hispanic L•,y 
parade which many to ,
,ti,ns hav e. 
The people I did not really reach through these channels were 
younger people - those who were born in the US, and are ne•v in high 
school or early college or vocational school, for instance - and older 
people - the grand arents who probably didn't coIlle here themselveS tc 
work, but joiner' sons and daughters who ('id: 
They are not so*likely 
to be members of the clubs or clients of the social service agencies 
(most iii.sranic families take care of their own elderly, who might other-
wise be clients of the social service agencies; these will instead be 
dealing with the "middle" generation, whose job it is to be the pro-
viders) . The v-,.y to come to know these groups, I think, is t?iro,.gh

their families, and that takes much lower than part-time (spread out 
among several communities) for -two months. 
I also did not get to know 
very many women, and this is also partly a function of the short time 
together with the cultural fact that the proper order of introduction 
in a family is through the man, who is the public figure, and the screen-
er out of unwanted intrusion. 
As•I mentioned on several_ occasions in 
fieldnotes, I generally met with men, and that mostly in public places 
- the club building, the parish hall, the workplace. 
Entry into the 
home, for an outsider who is anything other than guest, is a slow pro-
cess, and involves a lot of getting to :k ,.ow people first. 
I think this 
is a general rule, though I suspect that a Puerto Rican fieldworker 
might have a shorter calibration time than an Anglo. 
A duo in the 
field could obviate some of the chaperon••tge restrictions I mentioned 
in fieldnotes, but might also run up against the additional problem of 
being held at a distance because of "ou"Un,,-nberir.g". 
I don't really 
have a

I didn't get very deeply in to the community patterns, because I kept 
needing to move into other areas, to try to get some sense of a survey; 
I could easily have spent the entire time in Hammonton, or with Orlando's 
-6-
family, or. trying to get anywhere at all in the Puerto Rican community 
in Woodbine - which has a reputation in other Puerto Rican communities 
(even as far north as Lakewood) for its unity and economic success 
and undiluted Hispanic identity. 
I never did find a contact in Egg 
Harbor, which has enough of a Hispanic community to warrant a Spanish 
mass, or in Jackson -, 
or in Tabernacle. 
I did not follo 
up Lakewood 
or Vineland after my initial interviews, because they are not properly 
within the Pinelands Reserve area, though they both have social service 
agencies which serve the needs of Hispanics within the Pines, and may 
also be centers of economic and social activity for t 
:eri 
(as i.t aUpears , 
though I couldn't be sure on the basis of what I did pursue in these 
two locations). 
Vineland at least is a center of some importance for 
some Hispanics iri the southeastern part of the Pinelands, because of 
the almost wholly•Hispanic Vineland Softball League, and because it is 
a large enough cLty to have many suppliers of Hispanic foods and h=al-
ing salves and herbs, religious articles, and healers and santeros for 
those who wish to seek the-;r 
5., e-ry ices . 
Even on the basis of this, scant inf cr'mat, on, Ih-- iev 
, certai 
patterns did begin to emerge. 
Foremost among these is the recognition

There are discernable differences in expression of 
Hispanic identity between the rural and urban areas, for eyample , and

as the Charismatics or.

or members of different denominations altogether, people from the same 
town or general neck of the woods within the Pinelands, members of the 
local social action clubs, members of . the domino or softball leagues, 
local businesspeople and "official" social service agency staff. 
These 
are, I'm sure, but a few of the groupings and networks of people that 
could. and should be studied in order to gain any sort of full picture 
of Hispanic culture in the Pinelands. 
As many fieldworkers could pro-
fitably be assigned to the Hispanic population as have been assigned 
to the entire research project; certainly more than one would ha-q= to 
be, if a very complete study of this active and changing immigrant 
i 
culture were the desired outcome of further fieldwork.

, 
was Orlando Torres; he was also the only person I spoke .with who vas

designated "Pinelands" and that it has something to do with the area 
in which they live, but for almost no one was it a significant poli-
tical, social, personal or cultural entity. 
I met no one besides Tor-
res who i 
dent _i -_e.. with "the Pinelands
,. zt all; for those 
what is most significant about the Pinelands is its insignificance. 
I met no Hispanics who hunt for sport, and only 0. Torres who some-
times hunts purely for food, and that irrespective of season, papers, 
and other legal creations. 
Fernando Melendez did give me to under-
stand that in the southern region of the Pines there a quite a number 
of Puerto Ricans who fish and crab, and that they are mainly those who 
have come from coastal •areas in Puerto Rico, where these activities 
were central to their lives and perhaps to their livelihoods. 
In this 
sense, they are maintaining a customary activity in new surroundings, 
perhaps more than they are responding merely to what the local resourc-
es have to offer - though the two notions are obviously inpossible to 
separate in pra::tical reality. 
I did not myself meet any Puerto Rican 
fishermen, or at least not any for whom it was something w'hich came 
up in conversation. 
By and large, the sense of home - Rral Home - is still tied to 
Puerto Rico , 
and in many cases to the sr:,ecific town of origin there. 
Personal senses of identity seem to be mainly senses of Puerto Rica'_ 
citizenship and loyalty, and of attachment to the ho-metown - not neces-
sarily in that order. 
Ivan Arpaya, in Vineland, told me that it is

.
,ere is not, for a nu:nbe;. of

reasons. 
Most obvious of these is that not only are the vest majority 
of the Puerto Ricans in the area not homeo ,aners, they are not renters 
of houses mostly, either. 
Most of the housing available to people 
in the income bracket into which most of the area's Hispanics fall 
is project-house apartments and second and third story apartments in 
the downtown areas, above businesses. 
There aren't that many yards, 
or gardens, or 
that the Puerto 
even front porches, for a lot 
Ricans I met 
of people. 
The other is 
during the study strike me as in the main 
a private people, especially with respect to those features of their 
culture and lifestyle that may make them more highly visible, and/or 
more subject to exclusion o^ discrimination by the larger community. 
N 
ati Rodriguez, in Woodbine, has many "typical" Puerto Rican items on 
display; but I only saw her living room briefly, and we weren't able 
to keep our last scheduled appointment. 
I don't know if it is repre-
sentative of living rooms in Woodbine (wh-ch has the repo to_ti o-_ fc 
having' very "ty_Dical" Puerto Rican interior decor) or not, or of living 
rooms in other Puerto Rican communities. 
Too little contact in mouses 
to tell. 
There are community wide: public cultural displays made in ell 
the urban areas in which I contacted people.

areas, of Hispanic 
.history in the area., and a pride of cultural heritage. 
Most Hispanics 
I spoke with gave much higher estimates of the size of the Hispanic 
population in their towns than did Anglos in the same to`.,rns; who sees 
whom here, and how much and why? 
The sense of the immediacy and prox-
imity of Puerto Rico is strong, and travel back and forth is frequent. 
Current air fares from Newark, New York, or Philadelphia to San Juan 
average between $280 and 
300, round trip - not a prohibitive sum, but 
not inconsiderable, either, especially on a straitened budset. 
Access 
to relatives at home has a high priority, and one gets the sense that 
many Puerto Ricans who live in the US ar n't altogether here, in their 
own experience of themselves. 
On the theme of insider/outsider re-lations in the Pinelands, the, 
Puerto Rican population plays an especial. variation.

It also occurs to me that there is a scheduled flow of 
outsiders into the Pines, some event-centered (as for hunting, or the 
Hammonton festival of Our Lady of Mount Carmel), some seasonal (as in 
the harvest times) and some daily during the harvest time (as the crews 
who come in from Philadelphia daily to work on the cranberries); His-
panics participate in at least these last two, and they form a differ-
ent group (or groups) from the premanent residents. 
In terms of policy implications, I am most ignorant, since -- 
am 
not very familiar with the range of land-use regulations. 
Hcwever, 
it is'clear that the minimum acreage requirements for obtaining build-
ing permits have an effect on those Hispanics who are upwardly mobile

If these reauirements did not exist, or spe-
land as the minimum building lot, more H4_span-
ics would likely be sooner able to make the switch from renting to 
ownership. 
In this respect it seems likely 
hit existing regala ion: 
may in fact play a part in enforcing an exi sting lifestyle for m,,ny 
Puerto Ricans in the Pinelands. I suspect, without having sufficient 
knowledge of the subject 
subJect to assert it, that the Puerto Rican res_J n*.. 
may have settlement natter.-s ''i:._c'^ 
c..11- for a much closer snatia._l 
grouping of homes and family members than the 5-acre zoning regulation 
would permit; if this is so, then the existing regulations would also 
ally break down important patterns of association. 
Few people that I 
sooke with felt that the regulations had a direct impact on them, how-
ever, mostly '_ez i:use few, are in the pcs•.t! on to buy, build, or

.properties. 
The greatest -frustrations of my research experience had to do 
with the short duration of the entire initial -chase of the Project, 
together with the fact that I was working only part-time. 
The area 
to be covered is vast, and the communities so different, so self-
contained in many ways, and so inscrutably int-rconnecte'd, that I have 
gotten only the merest glimpse of what is realiy sit work h re.

the Civic Association in Hammonton also bear further study, as volun-
tary organizations muth concerned both with fostering a Hispanic iden-
tity and with easing problems of assimilation and acculturation_. 
These 
organizations are engaged in a paradoxical pursuit, since their two 
goals in many respects seem to turn out to be mutually exclusive. 
More research needs to be done in all the places I have already been, 
as well as in places where I did not get very far at all - such as 
Egg Harbor, Chatsworth, Tabernacle, and Jackson. 
There are many cultural themes which merit further research: the 
"lines of authority" which must be followed in gaining access to the

owing to the legal ease and actual frequency of travel to and ,fro-:, 
Puerto Rico, which allows for the maintenance of active contact with 
the parent culture, as does the continuous influx of new arrivals? 
US-Puerto Rican political relations (such a.s the territorial sta6,us, 
the movement for independence, Operation Bootstrap, American invest-
ment in Puerto Ricc and the subsequent economic rearrangement there) 
figure heavily in the very fact of the Puerto Rican presence in Ameri-
can agricultural and factory work; much more needs to be known about 
just how this figures in. 
A study should be made of the history and 
operations of tvie Glassboro labor camp, and others like it that used 
to be in the area. 
More needs to be learned about the Puerto Rican 
sense of identity in the US; Puerto Ricans are legally American citi-
zens, yet they consistently refer to "Am ,.ricans" as other people than 
themselves.

More should also be known about how customs function in Puerto Rico, 
in contrast to horn they function l.ere. 
I would be quite interested, -_Iven ta_::Ze and funds 
or furtt-e_- 
research, in developing an article on the Puerto Rican sense of place, 
probing especially the questions of Koine-town id^ntity and patterns 
of affiliation in the US wi th ethers from one's ow.-I home town in PI,er -,o 
Rico, and the phenomencn of frequent travel to and from the island. 
Other possibilities include an investigation into the experience and 
c 
workings of time in Puerto Rican communities, and the existence of 
these grass-roots and "official" organizations which promote and try 
to maintain cultural identity and practices in the immigrant -communi-
ties, while simultaneously trying to coL--.ter stereotypes which others 
may formulate on the basis of some of these ver.1 2.cti• hies and cultu- 
ral characteristics.
