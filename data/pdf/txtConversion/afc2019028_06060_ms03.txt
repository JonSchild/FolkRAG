 Abstract: Barbara James Norman is a 4th-generation blueberry farmer in Covert, Michigan. 
Covert, Michigan is a small village in rural Covert township in southwestern Michigan. Covert 
has an unusual history of racial equality dating back to its founding around the Civil War. 
African Americans have owned land, farmed and been elected to high political office in the 
community since the 1860s (before it was actually legal for them to vote in the state of 
Michigan). Ms. Norman grew up in a completely racially integrated public school system. In 
2003 the USDA gave her the national small farmer of the year award. She has been a leader in 
the USDA small farmers association, as well as organizing with schools in Detroit and Chicago 
to bring large groups of inner-city children to her farm.

ALC: And it's an honor to be here.  
 
BN:Thank you.  
 
ALC: Okay, and this is working. Alright, alright okay, first just because no one knows you or 
how wonderful you are or anything else, um, how long have you been farming and how many 
generations do you represent of farmers in Michigan cause we're here in Michigan.  
 
BN: Yes I've been farming a lifetime which is 71 years and I'm not ashamed to say. I'm fourth-
generation on our land but I'm third-generation on it I worked our land with my great-grandfather 
and my grandfather but my grandfather owned the land so I'm third-generation owner and I'm 
fourth-generation farmer and this year we're celebrating the land has been in my family legally 
75 years. 
3 
 
ALC: Wow, wow.  
 
BN:He's been on the land longer because they leased it for several years. 
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm, and this doesn't have a camera or anything else so you don't 
need to worry about that. Umm that's good! [laughs] And oh here's the other thing I forget to say, 
we can cut anything we don't want to have in here. 
 
BN: Okay.  
 
ALC: So just talk to me and if there's something you need to say and you're like, I don't want this 
in, I'm going through and editing all of this and cutting it out so. Um, and uh what is the main 
crop on the land? 
 
BN:The main crop is, I grow farmers, I grow students, I grow the future but I make my money 
off blueberries. 
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
BN: I have 25 acres of producing blueberries 1 acre certified organic the other 24 acres will be 
certified this year. 
 
ALC: And why did you decide to go organic? 
 
BN: Because I grew up when organic wasn't the cliche. 
 
ALC: Mmm.  
 
BN: I grew up my grandfather didn't use a lot of chemicals, the bugs wasn't as resilient to 
chemicals as they are now, and I grew up eating and off the land and so and I'm healthier for it. 
 
ALC:  Oh so when you say you ate off the land does that mean your family, in addition to 
blueberries had a garden? 
 
4 
BN: We had we grew where what needed we pretty much ate yeah whatever we grew. At one 
point we had a cow or two for the beef we had pigs and then we gardened we grew yeah 
vegetables. 
 
ALC:  Wow so tell me about the vegetable garden who would work it? 
 
BN: Yours truly. 
 
ALC: Were you an only child or were there others? 
 
BN: No my grandparents raised me I'm the oldest of three two other sisters but I've lived on this 
land all my life.  So I farmed all my life and we grew corn to feed the pigs whatever crops. 
We've had red raspberries, black raspberries, we had a pear orchard, but I have corns that will 
take me to my grave from shelling corn in the fall.  
 
ALC: Mmm.  
 
BN: To Shell and do for the pigs. 
 
ALC: Wow by hand.  
 
BN: By hand but the blueberries came in in 1956 and my grandfather knew that this was the 
evolution it was you know like  they think it's blue gold now, but there wasn't any hard books 
written about the science of blueberries so I grew up learning as the world or the land 
[unintelligible] as you learned so.  It became the steadfast crop and it could grow while we were 
asleep so. 
 
ALC: And how did he learn about blueberries and where did he get his first plants do you 
remember? 
 
BN: Yes because we even propagated at one time there was a, at one point my grandfather and 
older white guy Mr. Rood [presumed spelling] was the only full-time farmers in Covert.  
 
ALC: The only full-time blueberry farmers.  
 
BN: Only full-time farmers Mr. Rood is a fruit farmer.  
5 
 
[4:44] ALC: Oh Rood! R-O-O-D right I know about the Rood family.  
 
BN: Yes excuse my voice.  
 
ALC: No that's okay yeah cause it's um, I wrote about them a bit in my first book A Stronger 
Kinship. 
 
BN: Okay. 
 
ALC: Yeah yeah.  
 
BN: Okay, well blueberries was in Grand Junction a little small town in our County maybe four, 
five miles away, and they were out there but they weren't so much in Covert. So, As we knew 
about it and there were a couple of other Black farmers that were farming before my grandfather,  
and we got our some our first plants from a Charles Jones, and Mr. Freeman.  
 
ALC: And he was white?  
 
BN: No they were both Black.  
 
ALC: Okay, oh they were both Black okay.  
 
BN: Mmm-hmm and so... 
 
ALC: And were they in Van Buren County?  
 
BN: They were in Covert 
 
ALC: Oh they were in Covert okay,  
 
BN: And my grandfather was a minister so after it got going, this was '55 and '56 before he left 
being a minister, being a pastor, every person and every Deacon in the church had a small 
blueberry patch, we taught as we went along.  So planting them and then we learned about 
propagation. 
 
6 
ALC: Well that, I mean the thing about fruit is that it takes a while, that's a slow crop it's not like 
you can just put it in the ground like corn and then next year you've got a crop.  
 
BN: Right.  
 
ALC: It takes some patience! 
 
BN: But the benefit is whereas as corn or row crops or vegetables you have to do this process 
every year.  Once you put a blueberry in the ground it's like the other fruit trees, you never have 
to plant again, you just have to keep maintaining it you know feeding it and trimming taking out 
the dead so there's new growth or whatever. So there's an advantage to it. Yes it it does take 
maybe, it used to back then it would take five years for a plant to mature. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: It was a longer process so. But now with what we know you don't have to do that. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: So but in the meantime yes it would take five years but we were planting the field and we 
were learning while we plant. But we had the gardens and whatever and we weren't exactly poor 
you know never we wasn't waiting on these blueberries for us to eat.  
 
ALC: Right 'cause you had the food. 
 
BN: We had the food and we did the gardening plus my grandfather was an entrepreneur. So he 
we had a business in Chicago. He had a cab company. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: And I grew up learning that  everything he did made money 24 hours. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: So I grew up with him saying baby while we're asleep those cabs the wheels are turning. 
 
7 
 
 
BN: So I grew up with him saying baby while we're asleep those cabs the wheels are turning. 
When we got the blueberries he says baby while we asleep those plants are growing. 
 
ALC: What was your grandfather's name? 
 
BN: Stanford Lee Simmons.  
 
ALC: Stanford Lee Simmons, okay and so he owned a cab company in Chicago but he wanted to 
live here in Covert...  
 
BN: Well he was born in Mississippi. 
 
ALC: Okay  
 
BN: He's the, he's from a family of twelve. My great father and grandmother had, great 
grandmother they had twelve children, nine sons and three daughters. So he migrated to Chicago 
with an uncle for college and getting out of the South. 
 
ALC: Did he go to college? 
 
BN: Mm-hmm I could think of it in a minute, but anyway yes, didn't finish but he was a self-
made man. He did not have a Social Security number until he was seventy-five... 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: And I lived well. So coming there with the uncle he wind up, it was nine boys and so as they 
got older and married he would migrate them to Chicago them and their family, and if they find a 
house all of them would put in so wouldn't, say if it was a thousand dollars, everybody would 
give their ninth of a thousand dollars. 
 
ALC: Right, right.  
 
BN: So it wasn't a hardship and this is what I grew up under. 
 
8 
ALC: 'Cause that's one of the things I noticed in interviewing some of the other African 
American farmers around the midwest is that getting loans from what we think of just the 
traditional places rights, banks, later the USDA, that was a real challenge um... 
 
BN: And it was the downfall to losing your land it winds up it being in the 21st century a 
problem. 
  
ALC: Okay tell me about that. 
 
BN: Um because of the way it takes to get a loan, what it takes and the rigor and like now they 
want two-hundred percent of anywhere from a hundred and fifty percent to two hundred percent 
collateral. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: And the rules are different the playing field is not level, but that's a different story because 
my grandfather didn't grow up with that feeling, even though there was racism in the south.  
 
ALC: Mmm.  
 
[9:44] BN: He says he was around working and making a living even before any of those social 
programs GPA and PA whatever it was and that they were taught, do what you, only count on 
what you could do yourself type attitude. So as he came up and got a house and whatever then 
bringing their father and mother from the south by the time the children got grown and married 
and they'd buy a house and then he'd move and give that house to one brother and his wife or 
whatever the three sisters. Uh when it was time to bring my great-grandfather from the south he 
was not feeling Chicago. 
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: He was not feeling any of that so that's how we wind up in Michigan because they had to 
find some place that Papa was comfortable with he had to fool with the soil he had to plant a 
garden he could not stand the confinement of... 
 
ALC: The city.  
9 
 
BN: The city, so they found this farm this... 
 
ALC: How did they find Covert how'd they find? 
 
BN: Well it was only an hour and a half well it used to be 2 hours or so then because as a kid we 
didn't have 94... 
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: When I was growing up 
 
ALC: Mmm the highway 94 right.  
 
BN: Van Buren county is, produces more fruits and vegetables than anywhere else in the state.  
 
ALC: Wow, wow.  
 
BN: As far as the diversity of crops, specialty crops, now like Traverse City might be known the 
cherry capital or whatever, but far as diversity of crops and specialty crops it was Van Buren 
County. 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: And it was Covert, that's how blueberries are just so great here because our soil is perfect 
for it we're right on Lake Michigan. So, in finding these places for him to come up here they 
leased this land. My grandfather says if he had bought at the time, he bought the farm in 1945, he 
could have bought the whole road for two-thousand dollars. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: But not seeing the future  whatever butt. 
 
ALC: So he came here before World War II. 
 
BN: Yes. 
10 
 
ALC: Okay do you know 'bout when? 
 
BN: They started coming eight years before '45 so he was very young but he helped his father, 
uh because they bought the farm in August of, 'scuse me, 1945.  
 
ALC: Wow and so they're... 
 
BN: but they leased it for fifty dollars or a hundred dollars a year for six or seven years.  
 
ALC: Yeah.  
 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
ALC: Yeah and that was during the Great Depression. 
 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
ALC: Wow and so they are thriving raising family in the country, now had they, did they come 
from the country originally? 
 
BN: They came from Mississippi. 
 
ALC: From but rural Mississippi not Urban Mississippi. 
 
BN: Rural Mississippi yes and they came one family at the time my grandfather was like the 
leader the Beloved, and even with the farm that I'm on right now it mostly forest or whatever. 
None of this stuff was carved out, they carved piece at the time.  But growing up all my uncles 
came, they hunted there they did, my grandfather was there I learned to skin animals with 'em, 
do all the things that you do in a rural thing.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: And they, the family network I am so honored and I am so thankful Anna, of the family I 
was born into. Because they had those family values. They were strong, it was family first, they 
11 
believed in the system that they had of helping each other. Everything that each one of my uncles 
wanted to do they could count on everybody being in. 
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: You know they weren't able to come as a young married couple one at the time from 
Mississippi to Chicago and buy a house, even how cheap they were back then. But when they 
find a house, like I say, if it was nine-hundred each brother was gonna give a hundred.  
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: but that was... and some of my uncles and aunts and family members still have, we still have 
the same two buildings in Chicago now.  
 
ALC: Really I did not know that! 
 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: I have cousins who living there. I can still go on the same block that my mother grew up on, 
my mother went to school here too, all my life we've had land in two states. 
 
ALC: Oh my. 
 
BN: So I know that I'm blessed oh, I know that my outlook is different. 
 
ALC: Mmm-mmm. 
 
BN: And then growing up in Covert where the diversity was so good, and we, we didn't know 
about racism until you either went to college or moved away and got a job. 
 
ALC: so there is, and you know obviously I've written about it a bit, but for people who haven't 
heard about my book A Stronger Kinship, you were the one, you're someone who actually 
experienced this. So there was a very high level of diversity and racial integration particularly in 
the educational system and the... 
 
12 
BN: The whole Township. 
 
ALC: But also would you say equality? 
 
BN: Yes, yes.  
 
ALC: Cause there's the...diversity and integration are kind of catch words right, don't always 
come with equality. 
 
BN: Right. 
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: And that's the thing and I'm glad that you brought that up and then don't, if I get too on a 
soapbox or something stop me because all of that is so important to me. That word equality, If I 
grew, if I came to your house as a kid and we did something and you was going to get a swat I 
got it, nothing was said. Vice verse if you came to mine you'd be in heaven 'cause I never got a 
swat. [laughter] you would get that, my grandfather was so good with his words. You would get 
the same tongue lashing or whatever... 
 
[14:44] ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: I got, and with that being said it's so different when you grow up on your own land. You 
don't have as many restrictions . We could go in the woods, we could see the birds, we could do 
nature. And when you're dealing with nature and soil and stuff oh, it's not that much trouble you 
can get into! 
 
ALC: See Shikara Tyler [presumed spelling] and I were just talking yesterday, and she's now Dr. 
Shikara Tyler. 
 
BN: Mmm-hmm and I'm glad [voices overlap] 
 
ALC: And congratulations to her, congratulations to her but we were talking about the work of 
Dr. Monica White and others who are studying the broken relationship with the land within the 
African-American Community because of the legacy of enslavement, tenant farming. For a lot of 
13 
African-Americans land, and work on land work on farms um is acquainted with something 
negative. It's equated with victimization and Shakara Tyler really wants that vision to change. 
For you and your family, 'cause you were saying your grandfather wanted to come he wanted to 
get his hands in the soil,  
 
BN: My great-grandfather. 
 
ALC: Your great-grandfather too, um, what, how would you feel, how did they feel about, what 
did the land mean to them? I mean did it mean independence, I don't want to put words in your 
mouth, what do you feel the land meant to them? Being on the land farming the land working the 
land. 
 
BN: Okay let me say two things first, that broken relationship with the land is the. First off all it 
is far different with the Blacks in the Midwest than it is with the Blacks in the south.  
 
ALC: Okay. 
 
BN: They have still more of the family structure. They still own more of their land and they did 
it themselves. The Midwest what happened when some of the Blacks left the south for jobs in the 
big cities like Detroit for the car industry, they made more money and they got, that they thought 
they were getting freedom, but they lost some of their family values, they lost some of their, 
some of 'em. Because with the bigger families two or three of them would come to the north and 
maybe work in the industry or whatever but two or three stayed on the Land. So that's where 
their advantage is. 'Scuze me, but that's where their advantage is, they kept the land. And as they 
retire from here they go back so that's one thing. But with us and being in the Midwest a lot of 
them came for the jobs and they gave up the feeling of needing land and the feeling of families.  
Because in those big cities they wind up moving to a concrete jungle. 
 
ALC: Mmm.  
 
BN: As they went from the Agricultural Age to the Industrial Age, they gave up a lot. They 
might've bought a nice home and had a new car when coming home every year for everybody to 
see, but they didn't have the land.  
 
14 
ALC: What does, one of my questions and just I'm intrigued, do you feel that land is 
independence in some way? 
 
BN: Listen, and I always talk about my grandfather so if it gets redundant to you tell me.  
 
ALC: Mmm-mmm.  
 
BN: But I grew up learning oh, my grandfather taught me "he who owns the land makes the 
rules."  
 
ALC: Wow that's a great, "he who owns the land makes the rules." 
 
BN: And it's not work until you don't want to do it. Now to me they were separate things but they 
go together as I grow... 
 
ALC: What's the other phrase, it's not working... 
 
BN: Work until you, it's not work until you don't want to do it. That means if I'm going out to 
plant me some tomatoes or whatever, but I don't want to get up and leave the TV, or I don't want 
to get out of the swing, come down out of the tree and plant this tomato that I love and that I'm 
going to eat...than that's when it becomes work. But as long as I want to do it, it's not work. 
 
ALC: Mmm interesting! 
 
BN: And to show with me what happens is I'm a nature person I love outside. I'm going out 
everyday all my life with my grandfather I know every inch of the land. My grandmother was the 
homemaker, the cook, uh almost what they call those OCD now.  
 
ALC: [laughs] 
 
BN: Everything was always perfect, everything was in place, she knew everything in the house, 
we got three meals a day, sharpest kid in town or whatever. That wasn't me. I'm not a home 
person like that. And um I'm gonna be neat and clean, but I need to be outside.  
 
ALC: 'Cause it's fairly unusual to have, even in this day and age, a woman doing farming. Did 
your grandfather encourage you?  
15 
 
BN: No one had to. 
 
ALC: [laughs] 
 
[19:44] BN:  No one had to. 
 
ALC: okay.  
 
BN: I could hunt, now one of, okay my first real job was taking my family that wanted to come 
up from the city there I learned that highway there but that don't count. My first job was from my 
great-grandfather because when the guys, all of them hunted, and my great-grandfather could 
outshoot his sons. He could out chop them up there. I have a video and pictures of my great-
grandfather chopping... 
 
ALC: I would love to see those, I would love to see those.  
 
BN: Um so and... 
 
ALC: Chopping wood, chopping wood.  
 
BN: No! 
 
ALC: No! 
 
BN: Chopping in the field, chopping in the field... 
 
ALC: Oh! 
 
BN: And the garden because they did... I was farmer, National farmer of the year I think 2003 or 
something like that and so I had him on the video. 
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: So um, which led to me being on the tractor. , but my first job when the guys when my 
uncles would come up and hunt my great-grandfather would skin the squirrels and the rabbits up 
16 
on the back porch. I got a quarter for each animal and I would hold the feet or the legs as he 
would skin 'em so therefore I learned how to do that. 
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
BN: And that was one, that was my first job... 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: With my great-grandfather. 
 
ALC: How old were you? 
 
BN: I don't know 6, 7, 8 I don't know. 
 
ALC: Okay, okay.  
 
BN: But if yeah 'cause whatever they were doing, and one of my other uncles, he's the first one 
gave me a 22 rifle that my grandfather was teaching me how to shoot. 
 
ALC: Mmm-mmm.  
 
BN: Um and then we had a when they train, they train the dogs to hunt they had a coon they 
would put him in the barn. I would hold the doors and then they they drag the hat across the 
ground and then they put him up on the barn or in a tree.  
 
ALC: Oh you wanna pause this real quick gimme just a second.
