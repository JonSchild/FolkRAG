When meadows bloom with sun's bright rays, 
And birds are singing sweet; 
It's oftitnes we have holidays, 
And go our friends to greet. 
Some folks like strolling on the land, 
It fills some with delight, 
But our pastime oft enchants, 
'Tis footsteps in the moonlight. 
(Cornet echo, picture.) 
CHORUS. 
Waltzing, singing, all day long (Break.) 
All the folks join in our song, (Break.) 
Aint it it nice to move around, 
It fills me with delight; 
No dancings equal can be found, 
Like footsteps in the moonlight. 
(
Dance.) 
Sometimes we sing and dance for fun, 
Tis pleasure to us two; 
We're sure to please the old and young, 
As well as we please you. 
Our dancing is so easy, and 
Our steps are all so light, 
But we are here to do the grand, 
With footsteps in the moonlight.

We're a 
couple of eccentric individuals, 
And we're known throughout the country everywhere; 
We break the hearts af all the pretty colored belles, 
When we're on the promenade we make them stare. 
We go around to all the great athletic sports, 
At a 
wrestling match we never lost a 
fall; 
We take the cake from all the other dandy coons, 
While dancing at the colored fancy ball. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout, boys, sing, and have a 
jubilee, 
For we can't be with you but a 
little while; 
So watch us now and we'll introduce to you, 
Some dancing in our own peculiar style. (Repeat.) 
At all the fancy picnics and the jamborees, 
You can bet your bottom dollar we'll be there, 
And if any of the cranky mokes they can't agree, 
We will set the razors flying in the air; 
For we travel on our muscle and shape as well, 
When we get left 'twill be a 
rainy day; 
And you bet your life we always make our figure tell, 
We're the pompey coons so all the people say.

Away down south in Dixie, 
The place where we were born; 
We used to hoe the cotton, 
The sugar cane and corn. 
Oh! it's then boys, we had a 
happy time, 
On the old log cabin floor, 
And we used to keep it up till the breaking 
of the dawn, 
And dance till our feet were sore. (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark! listen to the sound 
Of the overseers horn a 
blowing in the morning, 
Shout, shout! and throw our feet around, 
Happy colored children from the 
good old cotton land. (Repeat.) 
We used to meet at sundown, 
When all our work was done, 
The darkies would gather round the door, 
To see us dance for fun. 
Oh! happy nigs singing all the day, 
We dance the whole night long; 
And now we've tried our best 
To please you with our little song.

Oh! just give us your attention for a

And a 
story we will tell to you; 
We're two congressmen, we're trying to get I'm office, 
And we stick to each other just like glue. 
We've tackled every free lunch in the country, 
From Sacramento down to San Jose, 
And now that we have just dropped in among you, 
We hope you'll treat us in a 
pleasant way. 
CHORUS. 
For we're cranky, we're mischievous and eccentric, 
And if by chance an office we do get; 
We'll emigrate the Chinese back to Ireland, 
That's the greatest thing :hat's ever happened yet. 
(Repeat.) 
We're sorry, but we can no longer linger, 
If we could linger longer we would stay; 
But we're going to double up with Dennis Kearney, 
And by to-morrow we will be away, 
And when we are in some foieign country, 
• 
And our work of glory it is done, 
Our gall we'll sell to other politicians, 
And then our lot will be a 
happy one.

MY PRETTY RED NOSE. 
PAB,
ODY 
BY CHARLEY CROSBY, OF CROSBY 
& 
MARTO. 
He gave me a 
bang on the nose, 
Oh! Heavens what stars I 
did see; 
And said, as he swiped me again, 
Wear this on your face love for me. 
Oh! Lord, don't it ache and feel sore, 
Just like a 
bull bumble bee's sting, 
While lonely I 
sigh, with a 
lump on ray eye, 
Of my pretty red nose I 
will sing. 
Chorus. 
Onouus. 
My pretty red nose, my pretty red nose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little blossom, my pretty red nose, 
Like a 
big scarlet bunion, still larger it grows. 
As I 
sing of my pretty red nose. 
It looks like an overgrown beet, 
As bright as a 
red flannel shirt; 
They tell me to go get it lanced, 
And say that it never will hurt. 
But I 
think I 
will bathe it with gin, 
And swear as I'm howling:with pain, 
That, well, hardly ever, as long as I 
live, 
Will I 
say you're a 
liar again. 
Chorus.

DO ACTORS EVER EAT. 
DECITATION BY TOM MARTIN, OP CROSBY dc MARTIN. 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LIEDER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
It is strange, yes, very strange, 
How by-words get about, 
You are sure to hear a 
new one, 
Each day that you go out. 
But the latest one that I 
have heard 
From a 
friend I 
chanced to meet, 
As she shook me by the hand and said— 
Do actors ever eat?. 
At this remark my blood turned cold, 
I 
knew not what to do; 
I 
thought of good old days gone by, 
And of actors that I 
knew. 
I 
answered his conundrum, 
As if on the point of death, 
And told him that I 
always thought, 
That every actor eat. 
It is true they don't eat turkey, 
Or tackle chicken pie; 
But over a 
plate of boarding-house hash," 
I 
have seen an actor die. 
I 
have seen them chew the hinges off 
An old sole leather trunk, 
And fancy it was beef steak, 
Or the ear of Barnum's monk. 
I 
have watched them eat red herring, 
Until their gums were sore; 
And when the dish was empty, 
They would quietly kick for more. 
But when that dry of reckoning comes. 
And above we all shall meet, 
I'll bet my old suspenders, 
That here's two that always eat. 
HAPPY OLD MR, MALONE. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY WALTER MACS. 
Bind friends give me attention, 
While I 
sing a 
little rhyme; 
And tell you of my youthful days 
When I 
was in my prime. 
I'm growing old, yes very old, 
You can see that at a 
glance; 
But there's very few here could bate me now, 
In an Irish song and dance. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm happy old Mr. Malone, 
As gay as a 
king on his throne; 
I 
sing all the day and drive care away, 
I'm happy old Mr. Malone. 
So now young folks, take my advice, 
As this wo-rld you go traveling through, 
Always do unto others as 
You wish them to do by you. 
To care and sorrow don't give way, 
Let other folks business alone, 
And then you'll be happy and free from all strife, 
Like happy old Mr. Malone. 
Chorus.

HUNGRY ACTORS. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CROSBY & MARTIN. 
mr THEIR GREAT SKETCH ENTITLED " THE TRAMPS." 
Oh ! here we are two hungry actors, 
We started on the road last fall; 
We are known all round the country, 
For we travel on our gall. 
Eating is our occupation, 
At‘that we were never known to fail; 
We've been fed on cheese and water, 
That's what makes us feel so pale. 
CHORUS. 
Take this message to our relations, 
Tell them we are eating soup, 
Say that we've been struck by lightening. 
What's the matter with the troupe. (Reyeat.) 
Say we're walking on our uppers, 
And our trunks are held for chuck; 
And if in Kansas we should meet them, 
We hope we'll be in better luck. 
Say we got the epizootic, 
Scarlet fever, and the croup, 
But if we die we still shall murmur, 
What's the matter with the troupe. 
Chorus, 
ERIN, THAT'S THE LAND FOR ME, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY PALLAS & CUSICE. 
Now if you'll pay attention, 
And listen for awhile; 
Our voice we'll raise, and sing in praise 
Of dear old Erin's Isle. 
The land all Irishmen adore, 
No matter where they be, 
Then give a cheer for Erin, 
The green isle of the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's Erin, Erin, as charming as can be, 
That's the land, you'll understand, 
For fun and jollity, there's all sort of fun and sport. 
Combined with harmony, 
Then Erin, Erin, acushla machree. 
Her sons they are all handsome, 
They're generous too, and kind, 
Her colleens are true hearted, 
If you go there you will find, 
They're full of hospitality, 
I'll lave you understand, 
Then Erin, Erin, 
Our own dear native land. 
Then here's to the harp, 
And shamrock of our isle, 
We hope peace and prosperity, 
May soon upon her smile. 
It's then we will go back again, 
To our dear native shore; 
That's Erin, Erin, 
The land that we adore. 
Chorus.

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME - 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a :004 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me; 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking (. ut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
Tie says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
Cnoaus. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dal, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But litde they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew oil, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
iielot. Lf 
to me.

THE DAY I 
PLAYED BASE BALL. 
SUNG BY PAT ROONEY WITH GREAT SUCCESC. 
kly name it is O'Halloher, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few and small. 
Some blackguards 'tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
And they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game ef ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out in " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all. 
I 
put up my hands to catch a " fly," 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball, 
I 
thought to Sanfrancisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all. , 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said ould man you made a 
fowl. 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know my name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for my photograph 
To hang upon the wall, 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Though my head was broke and my 
shoulders lam% 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train. 
The day I 
played base ball.

In Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
in looking at the lads and lassies on the green ; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her corning, but she hasn't come anyet I. 
he tiuth seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe 11 ,
2r true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS, 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie 
once again! 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean, 
She mild you would meet me, but I've waited long in vain—. 
In lands far away she does rosin ; 
Her promise she will keep— oh I 
break it not my Jean 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh I 
then let me long not wait, let me meet thee 
soon, my Jean, 
And the Heavens will smile on our love. 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Of a 
pretty Irish girl, her teeth as bright as pearls, 
And such rosy cheeks, I 
never saw before; 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night, 
Sure she is the only girl that I 
adore. 
She is like the birds of May, singing all the day, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lane, 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen, 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen that's her name, and she lives down 
in the lane, 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the well 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
'With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
I'll present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will away, 
And I'll marry my pretty Irish Queen.

Shure I'm a 
high-toned 'ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand, 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS. 
He's well educated and toney, 
His influence is great, 
Shure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
But if the boys make fun of me. 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land. 
So if you want an honest friend. 
Then. Maloney is the man.

When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
wozkingthan's poor family. 
'Twits at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapded at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave me bread and tea, 
lie was a 
son of Eriu's Isle, 
Toiling for his family. 
CHOIMS, 
I 
shook his hand so hard and tough, 
And the tears rolled fast down my fate, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
For you're welcome always at his Dines

A man well known to fame. 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of p'uck and game 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face. 
And the stylish way I

With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education 
decomplislied in all arts, 
I 
tan swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a

I 
can pull a

I'm a 
crack shot on the wing.

Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride,

Feel proud to shake my had.

By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
'ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A- de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains; 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-do, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountainfil 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A-de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian moultaina, 
Seem to watch and wait alwily.

Sure I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whaie always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
CHORUS. 
Paddy Duffy is my name, 
I 
will always be the same, 
Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy, 
A 
bold specimen am I, 
Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh ! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be all 
to- day, and doing well

The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot.where my mother and my father used to dwell, 
Oh! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of 
growing corn, 
Near the old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that.stood on the hill, 
But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well, 
As the old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
My home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
how I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
I 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it fills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Many years now have passed since I 
left 
my dear old home, 
To wander abroad thro this wide world to roam. 
rine spot has grovTei lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-nig 
Oh! how merry the birds sang their sweet songs 
of yore, 
As they peroh'd on the maple near the old cottage door.

THE TRAMP. 
BCixD BY FRANK LIM. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; • 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clotheR„ 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had em from 
near and far. 
But they were mostly farmers, -none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
Ile was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing. 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day,

Just look at my eye, you will see that I'm fly, 
I'm a 
man of influence and great education; 
I've studied in college, I've a

Of things as of they go every day. 
I 
never play cards, I 
sinke no cigars, 
Unless they are " Henry Clay;" 
I

Of course I 
take command; 
They come to me, and speak to me, 
And give me a 
shake of the hand, 
Sure President Grant is married to my aunt, 
I'm a 
distant relation to Henry Ward Beecher; 
I 
wear a 
pin on my breast, it is Tiffany's best, 
It was presented to me t'other day. 
By a committee from Tammany 
To which I 
do belong; 
The girls all say, I

And they are mashed on Alderman Fay.

It would break my poor mother's heart if 
from her I

And go roaming with you, Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, dm

Just as sure as there's a

You will never see your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, Ico.

}Tow since I 
appear here before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
And I'll sing of old lreland, the land of' my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old El 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moors 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great nien have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the bill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blov 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

The girls I 
amaze, when at them I

And my beautiful form I

I 
love the dear creatures so well, 
That they don't my attentions repel, 
I've got a

And in a

CHORUS. 
Law de claw, law de daw, 
With the girls let me live and die, 
For they are such charming creatures, 
Much sweeter than kokenut pie. 
I'm the pet of my mamma, also,

I'm soon trotting her on my knee.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NHL 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LUX. 
I am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Cnonus. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mark 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or a.me love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night. 
Chorus.

The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my encl. song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my dame; 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A 
father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
He called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connectional 
. Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinctiou, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell,that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
Only. a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh! how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
I 
shall there meet my old friends,

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
- Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mae, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
Chorus. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you,

When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in viotory,

wander alone,

There's no one to welcome me home, 
There's no one to welcome me home, 
Gone are the dear ones who loved me of old,

Cold is the hearthstone, deserted the hall; 
Once filled with gladness and joy, 
Father will ne'er again answer my call,

Aged and bending he sank to the grave,

Though in its mercy Heaven answered to save, 
There's no one to welcome me home.

Oh ! how forsaken and lonely and cold; 
Everywhere darkness and gloom, 
Will ye not come to me dear ones of old, 
And welcome your wanderer home.

wrote you I 
surely would come, 
Naught do I 
hear save the wind's plaintive morag !

KALAMAZOO, 
RECITED BY JOE HART. 
A 
bum in fi7ont of the theatre stood, 
Waiting to get a 
check; 
The police tried hard to drive him off, 
But he firmly stood on deck; 
Then longing for an old time lunch, 
He entered near by, a 
saloon, 
But he no sooner stepyed inside the door, _ 
Than he got hit with a 
big spittoon. 
The weary old bum faltered, 
And -nut-inured slow but sure, 
Gentlemen, you wouldn't thus ill treat me, 
But you know that I 
am poor; 
Why, I've been taken for Commodore Vanderbilt, 
But you see I'm not the man, 
For I 
was born in Kalamazoo, 
Kalamazoo in Michigan. 
Then he started to tell a 
story 
Of days when he was a 
boy, 
When he and Daniel O'Leary, 
Walked from Chicago to Illinoise; 
Ile then attempted to do an old time jig, 
For he said he was dancing mad, 
The bartender then grabbed a 
beer tumbles, 
For as a 
dancer he was terribly bad. 
He then made for the cheese and crackers, 
For he was a 
lunch demolisher, 
The proprietor seeing things suddenly disappear, 
Reached for the fire extinguisher; 
The old bum paused, and falteringly said, 
Why don't you set out some ham, 
Like they always do in Kalamazoo, 
Kalamazoo in Michigan. 
He then braced up and smilingly said, 
'Tis very seldom I 
drink, 
But on this auspicious occasion, 
A 
drop wouldn't hurt me do you think, 
Says he, I'm an old time actor, 
Have played many years on the boards, 
And pocketed many's the dollar, 
Have played before kings, queens, and lords, 
The proprietor then locked the money drawer, 
And kept his eye on the billiard table, 
And what do you think the old bum tried 
To buy a 
beer with a 
cigar box lable; 
The barkeeper then made desperate, 
And with a 
club in hand, 
Knocked him into Kalamazoo, 
Kalitmozoo in Michigan.

it roeked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs tilled my heart with deliglik 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
But mother has told we again and again, 
How c,dmlv she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy they say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she lef to our care. 
The best of all treasures her oid willow chair. 
M GM, 
It stood in the kitchen, long long years ago, 
Through inativ a 
season of sunshine and e 
now, 
The old will w 
chair that our grandmother made, 
And wi,ere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured of all ; 
BEG Bow in the garret a 
relic so rare, 
All wavered with wails stands the eld willow chair.

There is a 
lad lives upon our floor, 
He sings a 
song called the Hallway Door; 
He can beat Levy's Cornet; or Gilmore's Band, 
When he's singing The Sheeneys in the Sand, 
With my daughter Mary he cuts a 
dash. 
She told me last night he was her " mash;" 
She says to him, Tommy, you son of a 
gun, 
Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some fth3. 
Last Sunday when I 
came from masa, 
He asked me over to have a 
glass; 
Says I, I'll take a 
drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again. 
I 
sang a 
song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the tuottk 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fun. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
GreacoRoman fall. 
If he comes to the house next Sunday night 
I 
will fire him down a 
a 
couple of flight, 
And get the police to give him a 
run, 
For setting me drunk to have some ilia.

In a

Where violets sweetly bloom, 
Neath a 
shady arbor sweet, 
One lovely day in June. 
Strolling just for pleasure 
Down in a 
quiet nook, 
I 
Data my hearts delight there, 
On the bridge that crosses the brook. 
13Ies's the fairest one I've seen, 
My pretty daisy little queen; 
ne'er forget that day, 
The pleasant walk we took, 
When I 
met my heart's delight, 
On the bridge that crosses the brook. 
Nesse 
We talk4and laughed togethor, 
She smiled on we so sweet, 
blushed, my heart did flutter, 
When our eyes did meet, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
'Now together we do cherish—yes, 
The bridge that crosses the brook.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see, 
flowers of the wild wood and home by the river. 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Books that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wildwesed. 
Live only in memories chambers to- day. 
CHORUS. 
Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see; 
Flowers in the wild wood and borne by the riv , 
r, 
Yes, gone erre the joys that were once dear to me. 
Hours of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vale and hill, 
That flowing strearnlet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old mill. 
Forest of oaks where the sweet birds were singing. 
And roses abloom ' neath the fair summer sky, 
in dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
Of days I 
once cherished forever gone by. 
Chore& 
Days of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the past with their merry good cheer ; 
Bloom of the valley from. slay to December, 
he snow flakes which heightened the rust of the year. 
Then in the fall, picking apples so golden, 
Or making the sugar when springiime had come, 
We love to recount jcys of childhood so olden, 
When bunbetuns shine brightly on dear ones at home. 
Olho 
.Zione are tile days that my heart fondly cherished, 
And past are the charms I 
wiJuld love to recall 
Dear ma the thought that when childhood's joys perished. 
The bliss of remembrance was left to us all 
'row as down life's winding pathway I 
wander, 
My memory clings to its past treasures yet, 
The eunshine which brightened my childhood's homAonwi
yea_siee 
And friends ever patient I 
cannot forget

Oh my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me; 
Such a 
lovely girl with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She's the prettiest and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me; 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just a 
cage where little 
birds are singing, 
the's the sweetest and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me; 
such a 
lovely girl with teeth of pearl„ 
An angel without wings. 
PRETTY AS A 
PICTURE, 
CONTINUED. 
As we strayed along, the birds sweet song, 
Was ringing o'er the meadow; 
And I 
culled a 
rose you may suppose, 
To give my charmer fair. 
So we'd gaily chat while her Gipsey hat, 
Half hid her face in sliadow. 
But when e're I 
sighed her eyes replied, 
They shone like diamonds there; 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And you never miss the sun whenever she 
is near yon, 
If you saw her, you'd adore her, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
Chorus. 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so low, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport 'twas cupid caught, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
told her so as I 
turned to go, 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she drooped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you ' au revoir." 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart's a 
golden frame, whenever 
you may find hes, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
she's as pretty as a 
picture 21 the while. 
Chorus.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, - 
rye a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of e. job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you'don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you den't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney AlcGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, • my Bpalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
my eyes, 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

THE DAY I 
TOOK MY PEGT3 CONEY ISLE.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fah, 
She is from the County I ) own, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the whIle. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never go to swini 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
They all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " bat her pat," 
The day 1 
brought my Peg to Coney 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went, and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with !; arnutn's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang commenced to guy us, 
My bosom was on fire, 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hur
ray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
•'Beheave us" shouted out, 
(
Chorea 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feel maer,. after listening to that lad,, 
Of eourse be thought that he was awful smart, 
But If I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say Pm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter 
r.ut I 
can tak. my own part all the while. 
Arrah-musha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head. 
Dame I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
