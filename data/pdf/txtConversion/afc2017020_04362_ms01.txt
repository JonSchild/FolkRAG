Interview Index 
00:00:00 -- Introductory Slate // Interview Lede 
00:01:25 -- Early Life, Childhood & Upbringing -- Columbus & North-Eastern Ohio 
●
Born in Columbus, Ohio (1977) ; parents were not together, and mom moved family to 
Canton, Ohio; and, eventually, between Canton and East Canton // Kent
●
Mother passed away when Estella was 15; after having her own child, Estella moved back to 
Columbus about ten years ago, to be closer to her father, with whom she’d stayed connected 
to throughout most of her life
●
Growing up, Estella’s family was especially tight; spent alot of time in the family home with 
her siblings (4 sisters and 2 brothers), mother and grandmother; lived in Canton, East 
Canton, and in Kent, where her mother went to school shortly before she passed
●
Early memories of working in the garden with her grandma, who did most of the food prep 
and cooking for the family (00:05:00); most of her signiﬁcant family memories are centered 
around food; Thanksgiving and holidays centered around “what came out of that kitchen, 
and what was on that table”
●
00:07:30 -- Signiﬁcant childhood memories from her grandma’s repertoire: home-made 
potatoes and gravies; “orange cups,” cakes and pies and desserts; grandma and family started 
Thanksgiving prep “on Tuesday, not on Wednesday”; kids were allowed to look into the 
kitchen, and to wash the dishes; but grandma and her sisters did all of the cooking, whether 
for daily meals, after-church meals, or on holidays
●
00:09:30 -- High school/teenage experiences; a diﬃcult time (right after her mom passed 
away); “really just wanted to do whatever I wanted to do; my dad was in Columbus, and I 
didn’t have a mom.” Estella went into cosmetology (wanted get her hair done everyday, “and 
because I thought I was cute!”); she had been raised in the Church, and had a strong 
relationship to religion, which helped her get through losing her mom. 
●
00:11:32 -- After high school, Estella moved to Columbus “very, very brieﬂy” to come to live 
with her dad (“and to see what I could get away with,”); and then moved in with a friend in 
town; and then moved back to Canton, where she worked in the fast food industry, was 
involved in Church, and “lived a life that I wanted to.” On a dare, she accepted a friend’s 
challenge to go live into Little Rock (“to take them God”); and she moved there the next day. 
●
00:13:15 -- When Estella moved back to Canton, she had a baby. She worked as an assistant 
manager at a fast food restaurant; and then worked for a Quick Lube -- “I made really good 
money; you don’t see many African American women changing oil!”; and then asked to be 
relocated to Columbus, to be closer to her father. About a year later, she started working at 
her current job, with a corporation, as a supervisor; “... I like what I do; but it’s not my 
passion.”
00:15:00 -- Worklife // Passions; and Origins of Estella’s Labor of Love [Vegan Catering // 
Pop-Ups] 
●
There’s no tension, per se; but Estella’s main job is not her passion. She says she’s good at it; 
it’s not that it’s a place she doesn’t want to be; but she wants to be passionate about what 
she’s doing 
●
00:16:00 -- Estella discusses what makes her passionate; she comes from a family of social 
workers. She “enjoys seeing people be happy, and make an impact.” 
●
00:17:20 -- Origins of Estella’s vegan catering company. Estella had tried to stop eating 
multiple times; and it didn’t work. About a year and half previously, Estella’s dad was 
diagnosed with stomach cancer; her family started to look diﬀerently at what and how they 
ate -- “because, again, everything we do is surrounded by food.” She watched a documentary, 
What the Health, that made her realize that she and her family needed to make a change. She 
tells a story about setting a date to give up meat -- which happened to be the date just after 
Columbus’s Bacon Festival. She didn’t want to eat beans and rice every day of her life, and 
started looking at other things vegans ate via social media. “That’s where the passion came in 
… I’m back in the kitchen.”
●
00:20:20 -- Estella describes cooking and creating vegan food as her “prescribed therapy”; 
she describes the passion of creating these new dishes; she had already been known as being 
a good cook in the family; but she wasn’t necessarily setting out to start a catering company 
or open a restaurant. The call to open a public-facing vegan food establishment came 
towards the end of her dad’s battle with cancer; her dad loved a mock-meat dish she made, 
and had her cook a meal for his friends to try to trick them. And he looked at her and said, 
“You could be really good at this.” This was Estella’s last non-hospital fond memory with her 
dad; and she feels strongly that he told her to do this work.
00:23:00 -- Recipe Development, & Building Out Estella’s Labor of Love 
●
Estella discusses trying to make vegan versions of the dishes she and her dad loved 
throughout his lifetime -- including ribs, which were her dad’s especial favorite. She tried the 
brands in the store and didn’t like them, and then looked at diﬀerent YouTube videos, and 
tried to make small batches of the diﬀerent dishes to see what she liked the best; “and so, I 
would develop my own style, based on three diﬀerent people I had seen -- what they thought 
was their greatest.”
●
Ribs were the ﬁrst dish she created; then vegan cheeses -- “which is sometimes hit-or-miss!” 
Her technique is to make small batches; and test what she likes.
●
Slogan for her work is “U2CanBVegan” -- goal is to make a plant-based life-style accessible 
for people, starting with family and friends; this is a hash-tag she uses on social media posts 
of dishes she creates
●
00:28:10 -- Estella shares the story of her unique “chicken rolls”; “I haven’t met a person yet 
that doesn’t love it!”
00:30:50 -- Becoming an Entrepreneur: the Estella’s Labor of Love Pop-Up // Meal 
Service 
●
Estella discusses how Estella’s Labor of Love has grown out of her period of grief and 
diﬃculty going back to work after her dad’s passing; not sure what the future of the endeavor 
will look like -- “it might just be a pop-up forever”; no concrete plans to scale-up
●
First-ever event outside of with her friends and family: pop-up event in Columbus’s 
Whetstone Park of Roses, on Sunday, June 10th, 2018; “I had no idea it would be as 
successful as it was … I’m still in awe.” (00:34:28) Estella describes the wave after the the 
pop-up event.
●
00:35:12 -- Connections with the Economic Community Development Center [ECDI] // the 
Women’s Business Center; accessing their shared commercial kitchen space for cottage-
industry style producers (membership allows the space to be rented) -- Estella joined in May 
2018
●
00:37:00 -- Previous connections to the “food scene” in Columbus, before Estella became 
vegan; she didn’t have any particular relationship until she became vegan, “for the sole 
purpose of: is it really vegan? When I became more aware of what I was putting in my body, 
is when I had more questions”; and transitioned to more mom-and-pop restaurants, like 
Portia’s, where the owners are around and present. 
●
00:39:00 -- What’s next for the business? Brick-and-mortar dreams; placing products in local 
grocery stores; but also interest in learning how to teach vegan cooking -- “I would love for 
that to be a part of who I am, when people see me.” 
●
00:41:00 -- Day-to-day process of running Estella’s Labor of Love and imagining an 
emergent pop-up concept with Estella’s navigation of therapy and grief/mourning, which has 
been ongoing since her father passed away in March 2018. Discussion of how this work with 
vegan food as a therapy for Estella
●
00:42:51 -- Processes of creativity in the kitchen; experiments with making meat-based 
dishes vegan happen on Wednesdays and Thursdays; currently working on a vegan eggplant 
ravilio and cornbread; and a home-made ketchup
●
00:45:04 -- Selling/creating meal plans for the Columbus vegan community, beyond her 
immediate friends and family; emotional impact of seeing people she didn’t know come out 
to eat at her pop-up: “It makes me feel like I have purpose.”
00:49:20 -- The First Pop-Up: June 10th, at Park of Roses 
●
Family members and friends encouraged her to do a pop-up; someone suggested Park of 
Roses, when Estella was struggling to ﬁnd a place to host it; she was in a deep depression, 
but got an email from someone calling her tasting a “pop-up”; the person in the email 
reserved the park for her, on June 10th. The person who did this didn’t even live in 
Columbus. This was seven days before the pop-up.
●
00:51:00 -- Estella discusses responses to her pop-up; seeing vegan teenagers come out to her 
pop-up
●
00:53:40 -- “HOLY SHIT!”; or: Estella discusses the “no going back” moment! “You don’t 
have to be who you were … process it now. Process it now.”
●
00:56:50 -- Being ready for the steps ahead 
00:58:50 -- Inﬂuence of Estella’s Switch to Veganism // Reﬂecting on Her Life in Food 
●
Losing weight; changes in body structure and body pains
●
01:02:40 -- Reconsidering how she grew up eating; “we ate as healthy as we could for an 
African American family at the time”; family did not eat out much, and spent lots of time at 
a U-Pick farm in East Canton; lots of fresh vegetables and clean meat from the local butcher; 
“I have never realized it until now, but I believe they probably did the best they could to 
make sure we had the highest-quality food as we could.”
●
01:07:00 -- Reﬂecting on her time in the fast-food industry (from 14-26)-- she has a sense of 
how much it costs when ﬂour and seasoning get spilled! Estella also reﬂects on the good 
friends she met in the fast food industry; and how she was able to make very good money. 
Family on her mother’s side, however, was not thrilled that she was in the fast food industry: 
“So, I knew that I wasn’t going to stay in fast food. But I enjoyed it. I don’t have horror stories 
… I just don’t.” 
01:11:16 -- Sustainability & Business Planning // Between “the Dream” and “the Reality” 
●
01:11:40 -- Realities of economic struggle in imagining a future for Estella’s Labor of Love; 
“there has to be more than just the restaurant … I need to be able to educate for a small fee; 
I need to be able to have this product in the store … because nothing comes easy … at some 
point, I am going to be able give 110% for the dream, and make it happen. Or I’m gonna 
have to go back to the reality. I honestly believe that the dream is sustainable. And that’s why 
it brings me so much joy … because it’s pure. It’s work; it’s labor. But it is sustainable. And I 
believe that if you have a pure heart about what you’re doing, you can make it sustainable.”
●
01:14:00 -- Origins of the name, “Estella’s Labor of Love”; wanting customers to feel like 
they’re interacting with a higher power -- “This is something that has been happening for 
me, emotionally and spiritually, on a level that … I’m not even sure I’ve seen it all yet.”
01:18:00 -- Concluding Slate, Thanks & Goodbyes
