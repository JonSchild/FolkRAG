DON'T GO, MOLLIE DARLING. 
Words by FRANK D UMONT. 
Milsie by J. HENRY W HITMORE-
Oh ! 
Mollie, darling. the anchor is weighed, 
The s 
dp is now 1
-eady to sail o'er the sea. 
Each moment is precious and time will not wait, 
Oh ! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
011 to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh I 
listen to me. 
Oh ! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still lie has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh ! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, Sze. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But nh ! many evils will lurk at your side ; 
Let we kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days are but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go— 
lleav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you.' 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c.

Won't you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me. 
0! tell me. (lading, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up. darling, tell me this; 
Do you love me. Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mystic veil of night ; 
They seem laughing. Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light. 
0! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest. Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie. fairest, &c. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Tito' the parting gives me pain ; 
When the stars shine. Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
0! good- night. Mollie, good-bye, loved 
happy may you ever he. 
When you're dreaming. Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me.

DO THEY MISS ME AT HOME. 
Do they miss me at home, do they miss me. 
'Twould be an assurance most dear, 
To know that this moment some loved ones 
Were saying, " We wish he were here." 
To feel that the group at the fire-side, 
Were thinking of me as I 
roam : 
Oh yes, 'twould be joy beyond measur., 
To know that they miss me at home. 
To know that they miss ute, 
When twilight approches the season 
that ever is s.tered in song, 
Does some one repeat my name over, 
An I 
sigh that 
tarry so long; 
And is there a 
chord in the music. 
That's miss'd when my voice is away, 
And a 
chord in each heart that awaken's 
Regret at my wearisome stay. 
Regret at my wearisome stay, 
cte. 
Do they set a 
chair near the table, 
When evening's home pleasures are nigh, 
When the candles are lit in the parlour, 
And the stars in the calm azure sk v ? 
And when the " good nights," are repeated, 
And all lay them down to sleep, 
Do they think of the absent, and waft me 
A 
whisper'd " good night" while they weep ? 
A 
whisper'd " good night," dzc. 
Do they miss me at home, do they miss me, 
At morning, at noon, or at night ? 
And lingers one gloomy shade round them, 
That only my presence can light ? 
Are joys less invitingly welcome, 
And pleasures less hale than before, 
Because one is miss'd from the circle, 
Because I 
am with them no more. 
-Because I 
am with them, & c. 
MOTHER'S DEAD AND GONE, 
SONG- AND CHORUS. 
Dedicated to my old friend, Semi DOUGHERTY, of Philadelphia. 
Written by Pim. H. MOWREY. 
In the gray o'd vilia_e church-yard, 
There is seen a 
grassy mound; 
There is where my mother's sleeping, 
Beneath the cod turf-covered ground. 
Brig test flower: duster round it, 
Feathered warblers sing their song; 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone. 
Gently waves the weeping willow, 
Feathered songsters sing their song. 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother s 
dead and gone. 
I 
was young, yet I 
remember, 
That sad day when mother died; 
I 
sat watching, waiting, weeping, 
When she cailed me to her side. 
Whispering. I'll not see the morning, 
Angel voices bid me come; 
Trust in God, we'll meet in Heaven, 
When life's cares all are done. 
Gently waves, d
re, 
Oft I 
wander to the church-yard, 
Tenderly I 
nurse the flowers; 
There beside my n-r 
tiler's grave, 
I 
pass many, many, hours. 
Looking on the sky above me, 
Wondering if it will be long; 
Ere the angels come to take me, 
To the place • where mothers gone. 
Gently waves the weeping willow, 
Feathered songsters sing their song; 
While my heart is sad and lonely, 
For my mother's dead and gone.

CALL HI I BACK, etc.,—{CONCLUDED. 
CALL HIIT BACK BEFORE TOO LATE. 
Words by CRAS. LINDA. 
Music by CARLO ILLNASI. 
Sung by A LICE D UNNING LLNGA.RD. 
A man ' tis .said is woman's lord, 
Sometimes Inr lord and master. 
We women know how loving one, 
Will make the heart beat faster ; 
We also know that courtship•s smooth, 
That man's a 
willing martyr. 
Then why should marriage change him, so 
And make him turn a 
tartar ? 
Spaken—Ali—run afraid that we daughters of Eve have 
much to answer for—of course we are terrible teases to 
the men, but we can't help that, besides the dear, fellows 
like it— how our first mother teased our first father— every-
one knows. 
But be advised, my fair sisters, beware of 
domestic squabbles they are the root of marital misery— 
but if you shom/I have a 
little difference with your darling 
George, don't allow him to leave you in a 
passion—Oh, 
no— let him dash into the hall in a 
high state of despera-
tion if he will — but when he has seized his hat— 
CHORUS. 
Then call him back before too late, 
In anger don't dismiss him, 
And vhen your arms are round his neck, 
What can you do, but kiss him ? 
A ‘voman's weapon is her tongue, 
She knows well how to use it, 
For evil or for good— then be 
Discreet, and don't abuse it ; 
A loving word vill always turn 
The tide of wrath. so mind yon, 
Curb well the rebel. and take care, 
That passion does not blind you. 
(1) 
1. 
Spoken—Discretion is the better part of valor in love ai 
it is in war, so be careful not to turn victory into defeat— 
teach your tongue to speak loving, rather than harsh 
Ivords, but should it betray you into a 
little saucy badin-
age when the husband of your heart has forgotten your 
commission as to that last sweet thing in bonnets—the 
moment you find him disposed to commit himself to the 
bolting policy,— 
Then call him back, &c. 
Don't let the green-eyed monster take 
Possession of your lover, 
The early germ of jealousy, 
"ris best I'm sure to smother; 
If you have won a 
manly heart, 
Don't be ashamed to own it, 
The harvest of his love you're sure, 
To reap as you have sown it. 
Spoken—Men are sometimes jealous without sufficient 
cause and make themselves wretched about nothing—tho' 
atter all there is something so nice in having just a 
little 
quarrel— making it up is so delightful ; but mind, when 
you have tenzed dear Adolphus up to the proper mark and 
he is about to seek solace at his club— 
Then call him back, &c. 
We women always have our way, 
For that no one can blame us, 
'Tis said that we're the softer sex, 
That love is sure to tame us; 
Be gentle. kind, and true to man, 
There is a 
charm about him, 
If man loves woman, she loves man, 
And cannot live without him. 
spoken—My advice is. if you wish to live happily don't 
make troubles of trifles, or mountains of mole hills— live 
in a 
give and take spirit, remember that a 
man is often 
what a 
woman makes him—so after every nice little quar-
rel—

POWER OF LOVE, 
RECITATIVE. 
Myself once more the page I 
cease to play, 
Ah woman now, my soul resumes her sway. 
Though conscious love his wakeful heart denies, 
In blissful visions let me charm his eyes, 
Be love enthroned, his fancy's worshipp'd Queen. 
AIR. 
There's a 
power whose sway angel souls adore, 
And to lost obey, weeping evermore; 
Doubtful mortals prize smiles from it above, 
Bliss that never dies, such is thy power, oh, love I 
Source of joy and woe, foiler of stern hate, 
Lord of high and low, women call thy fate; 
Fierceness own thy spell, vulture, thou, and dove, 
Language cannot tell half thy power, oh, love! 
OVER THE SEA. 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
Hear what a 
little bird whispers to me— 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
Somebody's coining ere long. 
Then march, march, march, 
Ye lads of the heather, 
Come trooping together, 
Come march, march, march, 
Gallant hearts, valiant and strong, 
Oh! its over the sea, over the sea, 
Hear what a 
bonnie bird whispered to me— 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
Somebody's coming to me. 
Over the sea, over the sea, • 
Too long my laddie has wander'd trao me, 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
Now he is coming once more. 
Then we'll march, march, march, 
To greet him once more, 
On his own native shore ; 
Let us march, march, march, 
And bear him in triumph along. 
Oh ! its over tho sea, over the sea, 
Hear what a 
bonnie bird whisper'd to me— 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
Charlie is coming once more. 
THE HEAVENLY GOLDEN SHORE.

is published in De Wiles Half Dime Series of Choice Music. For sale by

Price five cents.] 
A halo of glorious light, surrounds 
That bright and happy land, 
Immortal souls are gathered there, 
A pure and holy band ; 
Above the earth, beyond the sky, 
The spirit longs to soar. 
For in tho- e 
regions we descry, 
That heavenly golden shore, 
That heavenly golden shore, 
That heavenly golden shore, 
For in those regions we descry, 
That heavenly golden shore. 
CHORUS 
That heavenly golden shore, 
That heavenly golden shore, 
For in those regions we descry, 
That heavenly golden shore. 
There God in all his glories clad, 
_Exalted on his throne, 
Jesus sits at his right hand, 
Ia that far and happy home; 
Gazing upon this world below, 
Thinking what the Savior bore, 
When from above lie came to show, 
How to reach that golden shore, 
How to reach that golden shore, 
How to reach that golden shore ; 
When from above He came to show, 
How to reach that golden shore. 
That heavenly, cke. 
When lingering on in sickness here, 
And thoughts of death arise, 
Trust but in Christ, there's no; gilt to fear, 
The soul it never dies ; 
But high above it wings its course, 
To dwell tilt re ever more, 
To meet those friends before us gone, 
To seek that golden shore, 
To seek that golden shore, 
To seek that golden shore, 
To meet those friends before us gone, 
To seek that golden shore. 
That heavenly, cEe.

FAREWELL! MY GENTLE HARP. 
Farewell my gentle Harp, farewell; 
Thy master's toils are nearly o'er ; 
These chords, that wont with joy to swell, 
Shall thrill no more. 
My faithful Ilarp ! the wild, the gay. 
And plaintive notes were all thy own ; 
Though now my trembling hands can play 
The sit' alone. 
And these, alas ! must die away 
When I 
am gone. 
And oh ! ' tis well that age and pain 
May find a 
home where mercy dwells, 
For here the wounded heart in vain 
Its sorrow tells. 
No more my soul can o'er thee shed 
The light of song that once it knew; 
The dreams of hope and joy have fled, 
That fancy drew. 
My faiti.ful Harp ! when I 
am dead be silent tool 
IT IS NOT THE TEAR 
AT Tins MOMENT SITED. 
It is not the tear at this moment s'ied, 
When the cold turf has just been laid o'er him ; 
That ean tell how beloved is the friend that's fled, 
And how deep in our hearts we deplore him. 
is the tear, through many a 
long day wept. 
Throwjh a 
life by his loss all shaded; 
'iris the sad remembrance, fondly kept, 
When all other griefs have fail i

And thus shall we mourn, and

As it shines through our hearts, shall initwove them; 
And worth shall seem fairer and truth mme I

When we think how he lived but to love theta. 
And as buried saints the grave perfume.

YOUNG OLD MAID. 
Serb o 
Comic Song for Ladies. 
Written, Composed and Sung by W ILLIAM IrORACE LINGARD. 
SPOKEN.—There, go away 
Go away, I 
say, I shan't 
give you another penny. 
Fifty cents and my feet on the 
seat. 
Just as if I 
couldn't put my feet on the seat if I 
like. 
Oh ! them ' acktnen, them 'orrid 'ackmen, they are so 
insolent to us poor unprotected females. 
And. I 
don't see 
why they should be so to me, for I'm not what you'd call 
bad looking, and I've only just turned twenty-two. 
Well 
I'm sure, I 
looks as good as a 
few years older, but trials 
and sorrows don't make good comestics, I 
can assure you. 
I 
don't suppose I 
shall ever have the heart to marry now. 
:Not for the want of a 
chance, oh ! dear no, for I've had 
more offers—but somehow they've all turned out unfor-
tunate. 
As I've a 
little time to spare I'll just sit down, and then 
I 
shall be able to tell how it ware. 
Ahem! My first proposal cow from a 
young man who 
belonged to a 
very high family, but his eddication had 
been most awfully neglected, for he mispronunciated al-
most every syllables in the Hinglisli language. 
And of 
course I 
could not overlook no such important pint as 
that, for I'm quite looked up to in our neighborhood, yes, 
and for miles and miles around the shrubbubs and out squirts 
of our town. So I 
say to him one day, I 
says, " John James 
Pollwiddy, our tastes does not at all agree, and under them 
circumstances we can never ' ope to be 'appy." and then I 
waited for a 
answer. 
And he turns to me and says, " Sa-
lina Ann. 
It that's the case, you may go to Jericho." He 
did, upon my word. 
And I 
wouldn't a 
believed of it of 
that young man, if I 
hadn't heard him distinctually with 
my own eyes. 
Ahem my next proposal came from a 
young man which 
played on the flute. 
But the least I 
says about him the 
better, for to my mind he ware the disgustinist, he ware 
time most indelicatest person I 
ever came across. 
[1] 
YOUNG OLD MAID.—[GONCLIMED. 
You must know, he took me to see Lingard, and when 
we came home it commenced to rain. 
So when we got 
into the 'ouse he says, " I 
opes you'll change your stock-
ings." 
Well I 
can assure you, (Spoken with disgust.) 
But 
he wouldn't be still, he went on worse than that, and he 
says, " Tell me truly, dont be bashful. 
Don't you feel a 
shivering all down your back ?” Well I 
really thought I 
must have fainted, but I 
turns to him and says, " What 
are the meaning of' such language as those ?" And then I 
addresses him in this wise, Sir ! If you don't know the 
respects which is clue my sect, says I, " you are a 
low fel-
low, and I 
shan't have nothing more to say to you. 
Amid 
I 
wouldn't speak to that young man again, not if he came 
on his bended knees before me, I 
never were so horrified. 
(rises) I 
don't think I 
shall ever marry now, but I 
might 
though, if some nice young man should offer. (sympho' y) 
The ups and downs and trials us young girls often see 
Is really quite distressing, and most unpleasant- lee 
To live in single blessedness I'm forced to by my Aunt, 
For I 
really want to marry, but somehow find I 
can't. 
A musician from the hopera paid his respects to me 
And always when my aunt was out, came to our house to 
tea, 
IIe vowil he loved me clearly, which caused my heart to 
pant, 
For I 
really want to marry, but somehow find I 
can't. 
One day he came to see me quite unexpectedly, 
My aunt came rushing in the room, and the fiddler she 
did spy 
He said he'd marry me right away, said she " I'm sure 
you shan't," 
For I 
really want to marry, but somehow find I 
can't.

THE BEAUTIFUL MAID OF MY SOUL. 
I 
seek her on every shore, 
But seek her, alas, still in vain, 
In the cabin where oft we have met, 
On the waves of the white-crested main, 
wander alone through the world. 
My anguish I 
cannot control— 
She is gone—she is lost—she is dead— 
The beautiful maid of my soul. 
I 
see in her desolate bower, 
The lute that she loy'd so to play— 
The vase, too, she treasur'd is there. 
But the flowers are all faded away. 
So tuneless, so withered my heart, 
1 
ts anguish I 
cannot control— 
I 
shall only behold her in heaven, 
The beautiful maid of my soul. 
MY HEART AND LUTE. 
I 
give thee all, I 
can no more, 
Though poor the offering be, 
My heart and lute are all the store 
That I 
can bring to thee. 
A lute whose gentle song reveals 
The soul I 
love full well ; 
And, better far, a 
heart that feels 
Much more than lute can tell. 
I 
give thee all, eize. 
Though love and song may fail, alas ! 
To keep life's clouds away, 
At least twill make them lighter pass, 
Or gild them it they stay. 
if ever care his discord flings 
O'er life's enchanted strain, 
Let love but gently touch the strings, 
'Twill all be sweet again. 
I 
give thee all, &e. 
WE YET MAY MEET AGAIN. 
Though sorrow's cloud is o'er me now, 
And I 
must soon depart, 
Perhaps for years in foreign lains, 
To roam with aching heart ; 
We still may hope that happier days 
In store for us remain, 
And though we part in anguish now 
We yet may meet again. 
Alt! w 
11 I 
know when far away 
You oft will think of me, 
The truth is in thy gentle voice 
And breathes I 
live for thee 
Then Mithful still in every clime 
We'll wake the cheering strain, 
Tho' distance may divide us now, 
We yet may meet again. 
THE THORN. 
From the white blossom'd sloe, 
My dear Chloe requested, 
A sprig her fair breast to adorn 
"o, by Heaven,' I 
exclaimed, " may I 
perish 
If ever I 
plant in that bosom a 
thorn." 
Then T 
showed her the ring, and implored her to marry ; 
She blushed like the dawning of morn, 
" 
Yes Ill consent," she replied, " if you promise— 
That no jealous rival shall laugh me to Scorn."

SHE SAID, YOU MUST BE QUICK ABOUT IT, 
A IR.-"NO RA CREINA." 
Sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
I 
was takin in, and done brown, 
There's mistake in it gainsaying, 
In love affairs some funny tricks, 
Ladies always will be p'aying. 
The girl I 
love she was divine, 
Her patience tired, I 
had to route it, 
When I 
resolved to make ha. mine 
She said, you must be quick about it. 
CHORUS. 
So gentlemen take my advice, 
Or lovers sharp will make you route it. 
Pop the question in a 
trice, 
Don't delay, be quick about it. 
The first time I 
beheld Miss Prout, 
With her beauty I 
was smitten, 
She could waltz, and polka too, 
Active, lively as a 
kitten. 
One night whilst waltzing to her said 
In a 
whisper, didn't shout it, 
I 
love you, dear, would marry you. 
She said you must be quick about it. 
So gentlemen, &c. 
One day I 
screwed my courage up. 
Went to her father for proposal,

SHE SAID, YOU MUST BE, & c.--[CONCLUDED. 
He said that nothing he would say, 
She was at her own disposal. 
I 
then asked her consent, 
She accepted, do not doubt it, 
Then to fix the wedding day, 
She said I 
must be quick about it. 
So, gentlemen, &c. 
A 
present of a 
bridal dress, 
A 
gold wedding- ring and keeper 
I 
gave her for my love for her, 
Nothing ever could be deeper. 
A week before the wedding day 
To another whisper'd, didn't shout it, 
I 
am ready, do make haste. 
Said she, you must be quick about it. 
So' gentlemen, 
Off she went that very night, 
With my wedding ring, and bridal present, 
Another wedded in my place, 
For me you'll say, 'twas very pleasant. 
An explanation did demand, 
Declared I 
would not go without it, 
Her answer was, you are too slow, 
I 
told you to be quick about it.

OH, I WEAR THE DOLLY vARDEN. 
Written by A RTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by FRED. W HITE. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Oh, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
Every day I 
promenade along the street, 
While my friends they stop and say, " I 
beg your pardon, 
Really, do you know, you look so very sweet ?" 
And the gentlemen give me such admiring glances. 
Smiling sweetly as I 
swiftly pass them by, 
While I 
hear them whisper, " I'm going for my chances, 
For that Dolly Varden suit just takes my eye." 
CIIORUS. 
Yes, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
In the fashion I 
am always sure to he, 
So I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
For it suits, I'm sure, a 
dashing girl like Inc., 
Oh, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
To the church and opera, it don't matter where, 
For I 
know it always is the height of fashion; 
You would think so could you see the people stare, 
All the girls with jealousy are nearly dying, 
Just because I've beat them in the latest stye ; 
Everywhere I 
go I 
find that they are trying. 
To imitate me, how it makes me smile. 
Yes, I 
wear the latest style, cte. 
Oh, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
And I 
had it on the other pleasant night, 
When I 
wandered in the shadows down the garden, 
'Neath the shining of the moon, so clear and bright, 
Some one softly whisper'd that he had learned to love me, 
When he saw me wear that fascinating style ; 
Some one made me promise by the stars above me, 
That I'd be his darling then and all the while. 
Yes, I 
wear the latest style, ctc. 
WHEN I 
HEAR MY LOVE KNOCK AT THE DOOR 
I've it beau you must know, who it is I'll not tell, 
So don't ask, for you'll get no reply ; 
A dear dashing fellow, altho' not a 
swe:1, 
For s'vells I've no fancy, not I, 
lie's a 
true gentleman, and that is a 
rank 
Above titles, which some girls adore ; 
Alt, how my heart beats \\Then I 
hear my dear Frank, 
Give his darling rat-a- tat-at at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how my heart beats whenever I 
hear, 
His rat-a- tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a- tat, tat, tat, tat, 
No music's so sweet, with joy my heart beats 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pic-nic we met, one bright summer's day. 
A day I 
ne'er shall forget ; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods, and somehow lost our way 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet : 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
And of it may he ne'er be bereft, 
After all we've concluded ' tis but an exchange, 
And ' tis said that exchange is no theft. 
Oh, how my heart beats, &c. 
He has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down ; 
lie has vow'd to he mine, in fact we both vow'cl, 
Each other to love evermore; 
Alt ! where's there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, eze.

THE PIC-NIC PARTY. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL 
Of all the pleasures on this earth 
For fun, and frolic, joy, and mirth, 
Laughing, riding, walking, talking, 
Give me a 
pic-nic party. 
Girls so pretty, men so witty, 
Rushing from the crowded city. 
List, I 
pray, to this my ditty, 
About the pie-nic party, 
So lets be merry and contrive 
How to keep the game alive; 
On fun and frolic lets us thrive, 
At this our pie-nie party. 
Now there's the dinner on the grass, 
The spread, the knives, and forks, and glass, 
With pigeon pies and joints en masse, 
To feed the pic-nic party. 
'Tis true they leave the salt behind, 
The corkscrew they can never find, 
But to complain 'twould be unkind, 
So everybody says " Never mind." 
Now all are seated, they begin, 
When shrieks are heard a 
horrid din, 
For a 
nest of ants they're sitting in, 
Oh, the joys of a 
pic-nic party.

THE PIC-NIC PARTY, [CONCLUDED.

When other sports have all been tried, 
A lady seated at your side, 
Says " She would like to a 
donkey ride," 
It's so nice at a 
pic-nic party. 
When all mounted off you go, 
But Miss tiemima screams out " Oh, 
My donkey's laying down, please wo." 
011, the joys of a 
pic-nic party. 
You use stick, throw stones and other missiles, 
The driver sets up shrieks and whistles, 
When donkey lays down in a 
lot of thistles, 
That's nice at a 
pic-nic party. 
You perhaps suggest a 
little walk 
With a 
charming girl, and as you talk, 
There's no one near your joy to baulk, 
Oh, that's nice at a 
pie-nie party. 
She want's a 
flow'!', you try to leap 
A ditch, whose bank is very steep, 
And soon find out you've cause to weep, 
For you tumble in all of a 
heap ; 
You howl with pain in madd'ning grasps, 
The girl with terror her hands she clasps, 
For you've roll'd into a 
nest of wasps, 
Oh, the joys of a 
plc-tile party. 
So let's be merry and contrive, 
How 
to keep the game alive, 
On tun and frolic let us thrive

SHE SAID ' TWAS DELIGHTFUL, 0, VERY. 
Sung by Miss JENNIZ ENost.. 
Ain--'' Think of your head in the Morning" 
Now I 
fell in love with a 
charming young gal, 
Her name it was Arabella., 
The first time I 
met her, forget it I 
no er shall, 
As I 
carried her blue silk nmbrella; 
ller father a 
baker, in Jersey lived, 
Free, open-hearted, and merry, 
Whenever I 
called Arabella to see, 
She said 'twas delightful, 0, very. 
To Cape May one day, 'twfv; arrange] we should go, 
Which pleased very much Arabella, 
Would it rain she asked me, wishing to know, 
Should she take her blue silk umbrella: 
If you wish I 
replied, tho' a 
very tine day, 
By omnibus started so merry, 
Were chatting and laughing the whole of the way, 
She said ' twas delightful, 0, very. 
At Cape May arrived, first the Hotel went through, 
In a 
skiff then I 
rowed out my Bella, 
When she sal I 
for a 
sail suppose that we do, 
Open the blue silk umbrella ; 
We were sailing but slow, when of wind such a 
gust, 
Came as we were singing so merry, 
Upset the skiff, the moment when just 
She said, "twas delightful, 0, very. 
An oar about floating I 
luckily found. 
But alas! of my dear Arabella, 
No a 
glimpse eon d 
I 
see nowhere around 
Of the blue silk umbrella ; 
A boat from the shore to my rescue soon came, 
Whilst dragging me into the wherry, 
How do you feel ? all did exclaim, 
I 
said not delightful, 0, very. 
Some drags were obtained, two boats were manu'd 
To search for my lust Arabella; 
From the bottom they dragged, grasp'd in her hand 
Was the ill-fated blue silk umbrella; 
In blankets they rolled her, gave brandy hot, 
'Till her face was as red as a 
cherry, 
When rolling her over, to her senses she got, 
She said tis delightful, 0, very. 
Home we returned, of the accident spoke. 
That it was'nt no worse, were delighted, 
Then laughed as they thought it a 
capital joke, 
To strengthen it we were united. 
Since married, we've bless'd been by children three, 
With faces so rosy and n:erry, 
As each one is born, Arabella to me, 
Says this is delightful, 0, very.

WHY AM I LEFT SINGLE? 
Written by C. H. Wire. 
Music by CARLO M INAFIL 
Suag by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Oh ! why am I 
left single at the age of twenty-two. 
A proposal I 
have never had, oh ! dear what shall I 
do, 
My bashfulness the better of my judgment I'm afraid 
I've allowed to get, and fate seems bent on calling me old 
maid; 
It's not because 1 
have not tried, of that I 
feel assnr'd, 
And aware I 
am that sweethearts cannot always be pro-
cured ; 
But when I 
see companions, some, too, plainer than my, 
self, 
All going off it seems a 
shame to leave me 3n the shelf. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, here I 
am left single, 
In this cold word to mingle 
Without the smile or warmth of love divine. 
And any gent who lonely, 
A true heart searching only, 
Would very much oblige, oblige by trying mine. 
For every Jack there is a 
Jill, at least so poets say, 
I 
sometimes think the poets wrong, in theirpeculiar way ; 
I 
think it likely that the Jacks more wide awake may be. 
And yet there seems a 
blindness in their overlooking me , 
I 
sing, I 
dance, I 
play, I 
draw, to which I 
can annex, 
Accomplishments most usual appertaining to my sex ; 
And thanks to schools of cookery, where lessons I 
could 
take, 
I'm sufficiently domesticnow; to cook or pastry make. 
Then why am I 
left single, & e. 
Oh ! is it that I 
cannot boast of wedding portion great, 
Or riches, such a 
bye-road to the matrimonial state; 
If so, let money-hunters go, for I 
am very sure, 
That men who marry but for cash their love must be im-
pure; 
No, better far be as I 
am, than linked in hymen's chain, 
With one who selfish pleasures take and 5N ill not share 
the pain ; 
But why sing thus pathetic, when our life is but a 
trance. 
In truth I 
want to change my name, but have not had a 
chance. 
Then why am I 
left single, &c.

Oh, don't you remember the pleasant old meadows, 
Where we in our childhood delighted to stray; 
Where we gathered the cowslips, and chased our own shadows, 
Or sat down to rest on the sweet scented hay ? 
Don't you remember, love ? don't you remember ? 
Oh, (Ion t 
you remember the merry May-blossoms, 
That your loving hands twined in my long flowing hair; 
And the path through the woodlands, with primroses bordered, 
Where you told of brave knights, who defended the fair ? 
Don't you remember, love ? don't you remember ? 
Oh, don't you r 
member the vine-covered cottage, 
And the small wicket gate, 'neath the moon's gentle rays; 
Where we vowed to love truly, till death us should sever, 
And to live for each other the rest of our days ? 
Don't you remember, love P 
don't you remember? 
Oh, don't you remember the village bells ringing, 
As you brought me away to your snug little cot, 
'Where the children's sweet voices recall, as I'm singing, 
The joys that are past, but can ne'er be fora-ot ? 
Don't 7ou remember, love? don't you remember ?

A SMILE WAS ALL SHE GAVE ME. 
THE TWINS, 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Not long ago, I 
was the beau, 
Of a 
pretty girl named Mary, 
With a 
face so sweet, and a 
style so neat, 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong : 
How I 
wished that she would have me, 
But when I 
did the question pop, 
A smile was all she gave me. 
CHORUS. 
And she was so fair, I 
do declare, 
How !, wished that she would have me ; 
But when I 
did the question pop, 
A smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, 
I 
took her out a 
riding, 
flow quick time flies when love and sighs, 
Are with the hours gliding, 
A 
rival was my only fear, 
And I 
couldn't think to save me., 
That when I 
asked her ivho he was, 
A smile was all she gave me. 
And she was so fair, &c. 
At last a 
note I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married, 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile was all she gave me. 
And she was so fair, &c. 
Sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
In form and features, face and limb 
I 
grew so like my brother, 
That folks got taking me for him, 
And each for one another; 
I 
puzzled all our kith and kin, 
And reached a 
frightful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin 
But not a 
soul knew which. 
One day, to make the matter worse, 
Before our names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse 
We got completely mixed ; 
And so you see by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John got christened me 
And I 
got christened him. 
This fatal likeness even dogged 
My footsteps when at school 
And I 
was always being flogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool! 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one I 
knew, 
What would you do if you were me, 
To prove that you w re you. 
This sad resemblance turned the tido 
Of my domestic life, 
And somehow my intended bride 
Became my brother's wife; 
In fact, year aftar year this same 
Absurd mistake went on, 
And when I 
died the neighbors came, 
And buried—brother John.

W HO WANTS A WIFE AS A PARTNER FOR 
LIFE . 
AIR.— " 
The Mouse Trap Ilan." 
Who wants a 
wife as a 
partner for life? 
Young men speak out, while the chance you obtain, 
Boldly come forth, and your passion declare, 
Quick you must be, if my hand 3 
ou would g.itl ; 
Never be backward in so good a 
case, 
Mock-modest people we girls always shun; 
Don't be so bashful, my offer embrace, 
For faint heart, you know, never fair lady won, 
CHORUS. 
Young men, young men, take care. 
Speak, speak, you've no time to spare; 
He that speaks first shall claim me as wife, 
Take me at once as his partner for life. 
On my perfections 'rye no need to dwell, 
That I'm accomplish'd you all can discern; 
Pay great attention, for now I 
will toll, 
What sort of beau I'd prefer in return: 
He must be handsome, and he most be fair. 
Quiet an Adonis in figure and face; 
Eyes azure blue, and have rich auburn hair, 
With whiskers to match, trimzu'd with exquisite grace , 
Young men, & c. 
Out by himself he, of course, must not roam, 
(Wives who allow such are certainly wrong), 
He must content himself stlying, at home, 
Hand and foot wait on me all the day long; 
If to avoid having '• family j 
rs" 
He is desirous, there's one thing quite clear, 
He must abstain from his pipes and cigars, 
Giving up drinking " Cooper." likewise '' bitter beer." 
Young men, & c. 
Still no reply ! what alas shall I 
do ? 
Fair men to speak out are not in the mind, 
They've lost a 
chance which I'll never renew, 
I'll wed a 
dark man should he be inclin'd ; 
All the fair men in my eye appear small, 
Ev'ry one here I 
have put to the test, 
That dark man wink'd (
points) so I 
think after all 
'Tween fair men and dark men, the dark are the best. 
Young men, & e.

Oh, he whispered of devotion, of devotion pure and deep,

To go hand in hand together, but I

He has told me of a

And don't you think the fellow tumbled down upon his knees; 
While the tears the creature wasted were enough to turn a

And he begged me to accept him, but I 
hardly think I 
will. 
Ile was here last night to see me, but he made so long a 
stay, 
I 
began to think the blockhead never meant to go away, 
At first I 
learnt to hate him, and I 
know I 
bate him still, 
Yet he urges me to wed him, but I 
hardly think I 
will. 
I 
am sure I 
would not choose him, but that I 
am fairly in it! 
For be says if I 
refuse him he could not live a 
minute; 
Now you know that the commandment plainly says we must not 
kill, 
So I've thought the matter over, and I 
rather think I 
will.

A PACK OF ALL JACKS. 
Air,—" Man in the Moon." 
Sung by Miss, JENNIE ENGEL. 
I 
speak by the card, just to tell you sonic facts, 
In life's little game we are all of us Jacks ; 
Upstart-Jacks-in-office, some fellows we see, 
And Jacks-hi- the-water, teatotallers on tea. 
If the poor got rich Jack-Puddings all the year round, 
As fat as Jack Falstaff they'd always be found, 
All Gulliver's travelers, of course, are Jack Brag-14-s, 
And paupers in tatters, why, they are Jack Rags. 
CIIORUS. 
We all play our cards, to win money and fame, 
'Tis pity, but true, there are knaves in life's game, 
But no Jacks of trumps on the Queen ur.i their backs. 
Hold your whist while I 
deal out my pack of all Jacks. 
A 
general dealer's a 
Jack-of-all-trades. 
The gravedigger I 
may denote Jack of Spades 
Jack ot Diamonds, the jeweller, who precious stones robs, 
And John waiters at Pall Mall Hotels, Jack of Clubs. 
A man of artistic attainments and parts, 
A painter sr sculptor is a 
Jack of Arts (hearts), 
And a 
Johnny in emerald livery seen, 
I 
think I 
may call him a 
Jack-in the -Green. 
We all play, 
rich grocer, in as Jack Horner, may come, 
Who puts in his finger and pulls out a 
plum ; 
The B , bby's Jack Ketch chasing fellows who rob, 
When he catches, and gives the prig one for his nob. 
Old misers are Screw Jacks, with hearts hard as rocks,

A PACK OF ALL JACKS.—[CONCLUDED. 
Undertakers get here, British Jack-in-the-Box; 
But the old way they bury's, so queer, and so dear 
We really do want Jack of New-bury here. 
We all p'ay, & c. 
John Bulls in the workhouse are all Union Jacks, 
Our sailor Jack Tars fear no despot's attacks. 
In Lancashire starving Jack Bull's don t 
despair, 
Tho' too many have Jack-o-lantern jaws there. 
They are all game cards, too, and let us hope, that 
Their dinners may not be confined to Jack Sprat: 
And wish, tho' their savings and chattels they've lost, 
They may not, feel too keenly the country Jack Frost 
We all play, & c, 
In my pack of all Jacks, I 
could pick as I 
pass, 
On the Continent, many a 
royal Jack ( donkey), 
Who envies old England her commerce and tin, 
And a 
la Jack Sheppard would like to break in; 
There's one Johnny Crappaud, son.ethnes called Jack Frog, 
Would very much like to steel here in a 
fog; 
But the Jackanapes step it quick, would be his plan. 
And, in doing so prove he's allied to Jack Ran ! (n)

or Jack Straw's Castle my purpose suits 
I'd sooner come out in a

THE GIRLS DON'T CARE. 
Ant.—" Peddy don't Care." 
As sung by MIAs JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'm ashamed of the times, I'm ashamed of the swells, 
They think they're superior to all us belles, 
I'm ashamed more attention to us they don't pay, 
We're " dooced nice girls," that's all they can say. 
Gents, you put on yourselves a 
precious high figure, 
And, Lord Dundreary like, simper and snigger; 
But your speeches and trickery are wasted on air, 
For you, tho' you think they do, the girls don't care. 
CHORUS. 
You may grow your moustachios, and blow your cigars, 
You may ogle the girl at the luncheon bars: 
You may live all your lives upon bachelor fare, 
You may go to the deuce, for the girls don't care I 
Our hats and our hoops you affect to despise, 
But I 
say young fellows, don't you look guys, 
in peg-top trousers and Puzeyite coats ? 
nd how's your poor feet in ycur tight boots ? 
There's taste in our dress, but little in yours, 
Out about in the (h)air, don't you look cures? 
You ape the gorilla, the monkey, and bear, 
so say what you like, for the girls don't care ! 
Spoken. 
No, 
You may grow your, (kc. 
You go armed for fear of a 
broken head. 
But what's in your skull that a 
cracked one you dread. 
If you'd as much sense as you'd make us believe, 
Such tissues of falsehood you never would weave. 
[1] 
55 
Spoken—No, 
THE GIRLS DON'T CARE.—[CoNcLuDrn. 
You pay more devothion to -" old Aunt Sally," 
The billiard board and, the skittle alley, 
To a 
horse or a 
dog that you do the fair, 
So for your protestations the girls don't care. 
Spoken—Not a 
bit, 
You may, 41:e. 
You'll walk with a 
nice girl in full dress 
For her beauty's a 
foil to your ugliness, 
When wives look in windows at a 
bonnet or shawl, 
You cry, " My dear, how slowly you crawl," 
But if at a 
meerschaum pipe you gaze, 
You don't hurt yourselves on your ways, 
Man, single s 
a 
leaf; when wed he's a 
hear, 
And for him a 
farthing the girls don't care. 
You may grow, & c. 
Now don't you think I 
mean all I 
say— 
Not a 
bit of it, gents, it's only my way; 
We each are dependent on each it is true, 
You can't do without us nor we without you. 
If it's John Bul.'s privilege to grumble away, 
Miss Bull has the same right too I 
say; 
l'm certain there's none here will take offence, 
I'm sure this company have better sense. 
LAST CHORUS. 
You're nice young men, and I'm only in fun— 
There's wives, if you like, for you every one ; 
So don't be downhearted, and never despair, 
And don't hang yourselves for the girls do care.

SAMIVELL SIMMONS, THE MODEST YOUNG 
M AN. 
AIIL—" Getting up Stairs." 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Talk about modest girls, I 
knew a 
young chap, 
Too modest to kiss a 
girl sitting on his lap, 
Tho' he was twenty-five, he no girl did adore; 
In fact didn't know what the girls were made for! 
CHORUS. 
Such a 
very modest young man was Samivell Simmons, 
Such a 
modest milksop no one ever saw. 
So modest was this this nice innocent youth, 
That he couldn't bear to look at the naked truth ; 
He went to the great Exhibition, one day. 
And, at sight of the " Greek Slave," he fainted away. 
Such a 
modest, & c. 
He'd blush to the eyes and looked round askance 
pret!y girl cast upon him a 
sly glance ; 
The ladies all said, he would never get wed, 
He could sooner court danger, than any fair maid. 
Such a modest. & c. 
For a 
juicy steak, if to the butcher he went, 
The sight of bare legs, Sammy into fits went ; 
To say the right word, his mind up he couldn't make, 
So asked for a 
pound of bull's latter-end steak ! 
Such a 
modest, &c.

SAMIVELL SIMMONS, &C. 
[CONCLUDED. 
When down by the sea-side he was such a 
flat, 
The bosom of the ocean he couldn't look at ; [T 
He would have been a soldier and fought Greeks or 
But he was afraid of looking at uncovered breast- works. 
Such a 
modest, & e. 
At a 
picture of " Venus rising from the sea," 
He called the police, and Samivell, said he, 
It was very immodest, and he'd write to the Times," 
For such indelicate paintings must lead to crimes. 
Such a 
modest, &c. 
Crinoline horrified him, he'd go round a 
mile, 
Than meet a 
girl in the hoop-de-dooden-do style ; 
He always turn'd red and with pain was attack'd, 
When anyone was talking about the bare fact. 
Such a 
modest, & c. 
Now, Samivell's mamma had money, and said 
She'd not leave him a 
pennv, if he didn't wed ; 
He blush'd, but the thought of losing the tin, 
Made him resolve on courtship and going in to win. 
Such a 
modest, & c. 
He made up his mind to take up to a 
lass, 
When he once began, he went on as bold as brass; 
Soon found one, got wed and his friends have since sworn 
Ere the honeymoon was done all his modesty was gone ! 
Such a 
modest, 6:c.

SHE WORE A MONKEY JACKET. 
AS 
sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
Though its evident a 
landman's life's the life for me, 
For in managing a 
yacht, I 
am very much at sea ; 
Yet I 
once went out a 
cruising, and I 
think that you'll 
agree, 
I 
was very badly treated, as you soon shall see. 
I 
was staying at Cowes, and I 
walked on the pier, 
1V-hen I 
met a 
pretty girl, such a 
nice little dear, 
And fell right over bead and ears in love with her, I 
fear, 
'Twas the saucy little yachting dress that settled me. 
CHORUS . 
For she wore a 
Monkey Jacket and a 
neat straw hat, 
A pretty little ribbon and a 
sweet cravat, 
For she wore a 
Monkey Jacket and a 
neat straw hat, 
And was so found of yachting. 
Very soon an introduction to this pretty girl I 
got, 
Her father was the owner of a 
smart little yacht ; 
And on a 
summer's morning when the sun was very hot, 
IIe asked me if I 
should like to take a 
trip to sea. 
I 
very soon consented, for I 
thought I 
saw 
A famous opportunity, I 
hadn't had before, 
Of proposing for her hand, for I 
loved her more and more, 
For the saucy little yachting dress had settled me.

soon rigged myself out in a 
nautical style, 
For when you go out yachting you cannot do less ; 
Though I 
felt rather awkward in the clothes, I 
must con-
fess ; 
Like a 
swan upon a 
turnpike road, von see, 
The water was rough, and I 
didn't feel grand, 
But it wouldn't do to own it, you must understand, 
And on my knees I 
offered for her heart and for her hand, 
For the saucy little yachting dress had settled me. 
For she wore, & e. 
Though I 
felt so very wretched, I 
could hardly speak, 
And knew that my appeal was most excessively weak; 
I 
saw a 
pretty smile upon her dimpled little cheek, 
And thought myself accepted on the briny sea ; 
But in trying to get up, for I 
telt assured, 
My head it went to windward, and my legs went lee-
ward; 
I 
tried to say " My dearest one ! " but only called out 
" 
Steward !" 
Oh, that saucy little yachting dress had settled me. 
For she wore, (ke. 
The sailors quickly picked me up, and carried me below, 
For the rest of the trip, I 
was too unwell to show ; 
But when I 
got on shore again, I 
determined I 
would go, 
And conclude the declaration, I'd commenced at sea. 
I 
ran down to the pier the next day in great haste, 
And there she was — but agony, alas, for her taste ! 
A chap had got his arm around the pretty little waist 
Of the saucy little yachting dress that settled me.

WHY CHIME THOSE BELLS SO MERRILY. 
Why chime those bells so merrily, why seem ye all so gay 
Is it because the new year's come, and the old has passed 
away ? 
Oh ! can you look upon the past, and see no sorrow now, 
That thus ye sing so joyously, and smiles light every brow, 
Oh ! if you can be blithe and gay, the song troll gaily on, 
And the burthen be, the new year's come, and the old 
year's gone. 
And the burthen, &c. 
The old man gazes on the mirth, he smiles not like the 
rest, 
He sits in silence by the hearth, and seems with grief op-
press'd ; 
He sees not in the merry throng, the child who was his 
pride, 
He listens for thejoyous song, she is not by his side. 
But search a 
twelvemonth, she was there, and now he is 
alone, 
Yet still ye sing the new year's come, and the old year's 
gone. 
Yet still ye sing, &c. 
Dance on, dance on, be blithe and gay nor pause to think 
the while, 
That ere this year has passed away, ye too may cease to 
smile, 
For Time in his restless flight brings changes sad and 
drear, 
The many hopes of youth, so blithe with every coming 
year; 
But still be happy while we may, and let the dance go on, 
Still gaily sing the new year's come, and the old has gone. 
Still gaily sing, &c.
