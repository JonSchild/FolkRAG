Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Mai Nguyen 
February 22, 2021 
Interviewed by Katelyn Reuther 
Mai Nguyen is a 
grain farmer in Sonoma County, California. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mai Nguyen joined the 
interview from Sonoma County, California, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, 
Massachusetts. 
Interview Log 
00:00:00 
Introductions 
00:00:31 
Mai describes their family's food culture as one of abundance and rich, deep 
flavors. Mai grew up living with their parents, maternal grandmother, and cousins. 
Additional family members made a 
full house. The whole family always sat down 
together for dinner, no matter what, and ate five courses: a 
protein, a 
vegetable, a 
pickle, clear broth soup, rice, and a 
fresh greens salad. If they had dessert, they 
would eat fruit as a 
palate cleanser. As Buddhists, Mai's family would pray at the 
beginning of each meal for farmers, the land, and their ancestors, giving gratitude 
for how they got the food. 
00:04:35 
Mai recounts how their grandmother would carefully prepare and present sliced 
apples and freshly squeezed orange juice after school, indicating that the 
preparation and appearance of food are important to our enjoyment of it. This 
comes from the Hue imperial city food culture that Mai's grandmother is from. 
Mai has come to appreciate the multi-sensory and aesthetic pleasures of food, in 
addition to its origins. Their grandmother had a 
garden with herbs, where 
she taught Mai about fresh flavors. She also taught them how to compost, and to 
welcome whatever grows in the garden, even weeds. They grew food for 
themselves and also to share with others in the Vietnamese community. 
00:06:56 
Buddhist temple was an extension of their family. Mai's grandmother would 
prepare food there and sell eggplant. Food was a 
way for them to support their 
community and connect refugees and immigrants with something familiar, deeply 
comforting, and helpful in a 
time of resettlement.

00:08:35 
That kind of food culture was normalized for Mai, but looking back, they 
appreciate the routines of making food from scratch, growing food, and 
understanding when to harvest foods at their peak ripeness. The relationships to 
food that their family established have been a 
healthy foundation for Mai, and 
gave them a 
greater appreciation for the broader environment and agricultural 
workers. As Mai reflects on the food their grandmother prepared for them as a 
child, they now see the deep love that came in those acts of nurturing. 
00:10:36 
In college, Mai was interested in waste management from an environmental 
standpoint. They were the waste reduction coordinator for a 
fifty-person house, 
and then for a 
fifteen hundred-person housing network. Living in a 
city with a 
composting bin, Mai learned more about organic matter and how it cycles. Mai's 
touchpoint with thinking about food and where it comes from was actually 
thinking about it from the waste management end. 
At university, Mai was involved in the student garden to process compost, and 
was fixated on the technical aspects of composting. Mai recalls eating especially 
flavorful raspberries in the school garden one summer, where they realized the 
flavor came from the compost and soil work they had done. This made Mai 
appreciate the connection their grandmother fostered since they were young. The 
flavor comes from both growing food yourself and tending to the inputs and 
ecosystem around it. 
Since then, Mai has become increasingly appreciative of the many ways we tend 
to the land; the millennia of tending by indigenous peoples; the people who 
steward soil in ways that can bring us more healthful food; and that healthy food 
and soil rely on a 
diversity of crops that have been saved by many people over 
millennia. 
00:14:21 
Mai mainly learned about composting on their own through teachers and reading. 
They enjoyed talking to people doing community gardens and composting at 
different sites. At that time, the touchpoint was around the pragmatics of 
composting and looking at its sources and microclimates. The curiosity around 
learning from other people helped Mai appreciate where people's food came from 
and what foods people wanted to eat to begin with. Mai began to trace food back 
to its source, and gained greater understanding of different food systems at the 
local, state, national, and global levels. 
00:15:56 
After graduating from college, doing climate research, and working in refugee 
camps, Mai returned to San Diego to work in refugee resettlement. They joined a 
grassroots-oriented department working in food security, and found that people 
wanted a 
place to grow their own food. It was often challenging for these refugees 
to find work, and they were used to providing for themselves not through 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021 
2 
financial economies necessarily, but through economies of care, spirituality and 
independent production. 
Mai secured a 
two-and- a-half acre site and converted it to an urban farm, enabling 
thirty-six plots to be created for refugees to grow culturally relevant foods. This 
was an important part of people's mental health and gave them agency over their 
lives. Mai started running a 
farmers market in connection with that site, focusing 
on local and culturally relevant food. Because of higher prices at the market, Mai 
helped create a 
program to match federal assistance dollars so that people could 
double the amount they spent at the farmers market. 
Despite the increased affordability of the produce, cultural relevance and 
production practices drove people's purchasing. A 
box truck of Southeast Asian 
crops would sell out within an hour. Seeing the high demand within the 
community made Mai want to meet that demand. With background in climate 
change and geography, Mai wanted to use organic, natural methods, no herbicides 
or pesticides, and no chemicals involved in the wars that destroyed forests and 
caused disease in their homelands. 
00:21:43 
In graduate school, Mai started a 
farm-to-table cafe/restaurant and through that, 
met many farmers and began working on farms. This allowed Mai to gain farm 
experience and learn about ways of farming outside of the United States-dominant 
system. Back in California, Mai wanted to invest in growing food for their 
community using ecological practices based on Buddhist philosophies and their 
rootedness in the state. 
00:23:05 
Mai was twenty-four years old when working at the farmers market in San Diego. 
00:23:18 
In graduate school, Mai was interested in the diversified operations of young 
farmers around their age. In California, you often see long stretches of the same 
crop. Mai wanted to see forty-acre farms with animals, vegetables, herbs, roots, 
flowers, bees, and grains. Mai was attracted to the idea of growing the full diet in 
one place. In particular, there were two farmer friends that established their farms 
on the same road. Despite having separate operations, they cross-promoted and 
brought everything together in a 
micro-ecosystem. Mai saw both the 
diversification on one site and the diversification possible when you collaborate 
with others. 
00:24:47 
Mai went to graduate school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They went from eating 
a 
local diet in California to eating a 
local diet in Canada, which consisted of beets 
and barley in the winter. 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021

00:25:19 
After finishing graduate school, Mai immediately went into farming. Thinking 
about growing a 
full diet locally, Mai found their knowledge about grains lacking 
and went to apprentice on a 
grain farm. Grain is a 
staple crop; it lasts a 
long time 
and is a 
foundational part of meals. Mai went on to work on a 
vegetable farm that 
had a 
Community Supported Agricultural market system and sold at farmers 
markets, which appealed to their desire to serve communities and have 
relationships with people. That experience enabled Mai to start their own business 
producing grains and Vietnamese crops for seed and food. 
00:27:42 
Mai wanted to build experience on other farms with the intention of starting their 
own. Their parents said this was in line with what Mai wanted as a 
child: to have 
a 
farm and live communally with other people. When Mai came to farming, it was 
as if they had finally arrived. Farming engaged the skills they had cultivated 
around community building in the cooperative sector and cooperative housing; 
allowed them to be in community and take care of community logistically; excited 
Mai as a 
mechanically-minded person interested in troubleshooting and making 
repairs to equipment; activated Mai's background as a 
geographer and physicist to 
read landscapes and weather maps; and fit with Mai's waste management and 
compost experience. All of these seemingly disparate elements came together 
when Mai was farming. The apprenticeships Mai did acted as the missing pieces 
of their lifelong trajectory. 
00:30:45 
In the winter of 2014, Mai established their own farm. 
00:31:15 
Mai describes the process of starting their farm business. A 
Buddhist monastery in 
Mai's county offered to support someone financially to farm on their land, a 
five-
acre piece that had been fallow for decades. The monastery wanted someone with 
a 
desire to farm, who knew the area, and who could respect Buddhist traditions. 
With a 
monthly stipend and small residence provided, both of which are 
fundamental to farmers who do not get paid until they have a 
product to take to 
market, Mai got started. 
Community support was also critical, enabling Mai to borrow equipment and 
clear the land. Mai spent time at the beginning preparing new ground and trying 
to find the right tools while relying on networks that they had cultivated earlier. 
00:35:20 
Mai's identity as an Asian American female both cuts them off from opportunities 
and allows them to gain access. 
00:36:12 
Mai committed early on to the idea of growing grains as part of a 
full-diet farm, 
but wanted to try it out first to see how it would fit into the larger farm plan. They 
saw on other farms how much straw was bought for weed suppression and 
thought about how they wanted to use straw to protect their farm from the 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021

wildfire/flood cycle instead. Crop diversity is not just about what we eat, but also 
about the land having greater resilience. 
00:38:02 
Mai looked at what we eat and what is available, and realized that they did not 
want to bear the cost of buying seed every year. However, seed patents prohibit 
growers from saving seed and replanting it. As someone who is growing for 
climate change adaptability, Mai knows that adapting seed to your climate 
requires re-planting it year after year so that it can acclimate to its particular 
environment. Growing seed from different conditions means a 
lack of adaptability 
and resilience. Having to buy it from somewhere else means a 
lack of security. In 
2020, many people started panic-buying seeds, causing a 
seed shortage for 
farmers like Mai. This illustrates how important it is for farmers to be able to save 
their own seed. 
When selecting varieties, Mai takes into account: restrictions on being able to 
save, regrow, share seed with other farmers; yield; germination rate; tillering; 
disease resistance; nutrient content; and balance of health and enjoyment/pleasure. 
They have been focusing on soft white wheat varieties that are well adapted to the 
north coast California climate, including Chiddam Blanc de Mars and Whit 
Wolkoring. These wheats become a 
pillowy flour that can behave like all-purpose 
flour, giving people a 
nutritious, flavorful whole food that they can use without 
having to create new recipes. Mai wants them to become household names like 
Fuji apples or Fuyu persimmons, and that these identities for our foods will help 
people gain greater appreciation for the diversity and fullness they bring to our 
lives. 
00:45:02 
Since the start of the farm, Mai has grown wheat, barley, and rye and trialed millet 
and rice. To adapt to living here as a 
Vietnamese person, Mai wants to have crops 
that nourished their ancestors and made them who they are, while also thinking 
about what their child and community will eat in the future. It will probably be a 
mix. Also, what can grow in California, and what staple crops are relevant to our 
climate future? Because Mai uses no irrigation, they tend to choose grains that are 
drought-tolerant, such as wheat. Because of their drought tolerance, wheat, barley, 
and rye have all been strong, whereas water-intensive crops like millet and rice 
have not had good yields. Thinking about the future, Mai is investing in trials, 
production, and infrastructure for wheat, barley, and rye. 
00:47:46 
Mai grows over twenty-five different varieties, and they source seeds from people 
as much as possible. This includes seeds from other farmers, all of which connect 
back to Monica Spiller, a 
whole grain advocate, and from Middle Eastern and 
North African refugees. Some seeds have also come from the USDA (United 
States Department of Agriculture) germ plasm. 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021

00:50:03 
Mai is saving seeds, but needs scale-appropriate grain cleaning equipment. Grain 
cleaning is key for getting the grain from farms to eaters. Most grain cleaning 
facilities in California have a 
minimum of twenty thousand tons. Mai only 
produces up to eight tons of one variety. They are trying to build their own facility 
to preserve seeds at the scale at which they are growing. 
00:51:09 
When Mai got into farming, they wanted to sell to the Vietnamese community. 
However, when doing a 
delivery, Mai was hit by a 
semi-truck. This limited their 
ability to farm as they had before, especially bending over and doing repetitive 
motions. Mai has focused on grain farming as they heal, because it does not 
require on-farm work between planting and harvesting. Mai hopes to get back to 
growing Vietnamese crops again, but for now, has very enthusiastic Vietnamese 
American and Asian American customers who use their flour in bread, dumplings 
and noodles. 
00:53:50 
People like knowing that Mai exists through their social media and website. 
Having transparency around who Mai is, what motivates them, how they farm, 
and knowing that Mai will respond is all of value to customers. Transparency is 
accountability. Young Asian Americans and Vietnamese Americans appreciate 
seeing a 
young, female-bodied Asian American person out there farming. It makes 
people feel like it is more possible for them. Mai is upfront about their social 
justice values and environmental principles, and believes that people see Mai 
manifesting the values that they have. 
00:56:13 
Mai primarily sells through flour shares. People pay upfront for a 
six-month flour 
subscription in Sonoma County and southern California. During the pandemic, the 
flour pick-ups have provided people with an opportunity for connection despite 
physical distancing. 
00:57:15 
Early on, Mai sold through farmers markets, to small bakeries, and through a 
mill 
that made their flour available at the retail level. As bakeries started to drop off, 
Mai began focusing on the mill that got flour to more home bakers. Now with the 
flour share, Mai is directly connected with share members and can offer them 
additional resources, like classes and talks. There is more opportunity for sharing 
knowledge and inviting people in to build the new grain economy together. The 
pandemic brought a 
lot of chances for us to evaluate what kind of relationships we 
want to have with each other, and has enabled Mai to connect more directly with 
people interested in their business. 
00:59:15 
Mai is not growing on the same land they started on. They moved three times in 
six years. Land tenure has been the greatest challenge. Leasing land makes it 
difficult for someone who wants to grow perennial crops and build soil. 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021

00:59:44 
Mai leases three different properties, which totals seventy acres, all in production. 
1:00:14 
Mai produces, on average, about one thousand to fifteen hundred pounds per 
acre. For context, irrigated modern varieties of wheat usually yield about six 
thousand pounds to the acre. In Mai's area, other people growing similar varieties 
typically yield six hundred to nine hundred pounds to the acre. Mai attributes 
their higher yields to selection and the use of animals for fertilization and building 
soil health. Beyond harvest yield, a 
lot happens afterwards, including events like 
wildfires that delay getting the grain to the cleaners, or wet weeds that can cause 
rot. The landlord situation and climate change-related events both have a 
big 
impact on post-harvest yield. 
1:02:45 
During their childhood and even now, Mai has always liked to know the root of 
things. Mai likes to start at the beginning and figure out how things work before 
using them. Growing up in a 
refugee community, Mai saw a 
lot of inequality and 
poverty and wondered: why can't people just have food? Why can't we just feed 
everyone? That concern for others comes from Mai's family. 
1:04:50 
Before they started farming, Mai saw and knew Asian American farmers who 
came to the farmers market and sold Southeast Asian crops. 
1:05:30 
It helped to see other Asian American farmers out there growing Southeast Asian 
crops and selling out. Knowing other Southeast Asian farmers of a 
similar age and 
with a 
similar migration history as Mai's own community helped Mai see that it is 
possible, and that they will not be alone. Later, Mai found out that although those 
farmers exist, they are in very concentrated areas. Now, it is promising for Mai to 
hear from a 
lot of young Asian Americans who read about Mai and the Asian 
American Farmers Alliance and feel that this is also possible for them. 
1:07:08 
When Mai first got into farming, other than thinking about wanting to serve their 
Vietnamese community, they did not think about their identity and what it meant 
for their ability to farm, their safety, and their access to farming resources. In 
college, Mai found spaces that promised a 
welcoming environment, but when 
farming in the same area of northern California later, it soon became clear that 
people did not see Mai fitting in. 
1:08:55 
Mai recalls stories of feeling out of place or alienated in farming because of their 
identity, including while apprenticing on a 
grain farm and while participating in 
different parts of the farming community at the state and national levels. Within 
some groups, Mai experiences being seen not as a 
contributor in any way aside 
from having the potential to indoctrinate and assimilate other people of color into 
these white supremacist spaces. In community-oriented spaces, the baseline 
assumptions about people's backgrounds diverge significantly from Mai's 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021 
7 
experiences, leading to narrow conversations and perspectives that are hurtful to 
people of color. Mai saw a 
state entity fail to recognize that it was lifting up a 
past 
that was even more dangerous for people of color, and heard conversations at the 
national level that objectified bodies and commented on their worth in the world. 
Mai notes that this is a 
reflection of our broader agricultural system and how we 
see Black and brown bodies as disposable in the fields. This also connects to the 
racist legacy of agriculture in the U.S. 
Witnessing and hearing those conversations made Mai want to create their own 
farm as a 
haven for Asian Americans who want to engage in farming. Specifically, 
Mai wants to use their experiences to prevent other people from having the same 
kind of pain they experienced. 
1:17:10 
Since Mai got into farming, there are more Asian American farmers visible on 
social media. Mai hopes they use their platform to lift up those who are not 
English-language proficient or who do not have the same kind of social capital 
connections. Although the national conversation has also shifted, the changes on 
the ground are less clear and slower to come. It is unclear what the conversation 
shift means for Asian Americans, as race in the U.S. is often seen as a 
Black/white 
issue. Because of the model minority myth, Asians are seen as adjacent to 
whiteness. The racism against Asian Americans is still overlooked, and may not 
be addressed in equity action plans anytime soon. The pandemic and President 
Trump's reference to the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu" heightened anti-Asian 
harassment and violence, including recent attacks on elders, all of which lacked 
significant coverage in mainstream media. 
Mai also mentions that there is a 
greater movement for farming justice, much of 
which is Black-led. There is also more attention on Indigenous sovereignty. For 
Asian Americans who feel an alliance with Indigenous people because of their 
own forced displacement, there are promising new relationships surrounding that. 
The Asian American community has a 
lot of work to do surrounding anti-
Blackness and conflict with the Latinx community. With a 
new generation 
focused on justice, healing, and figuring out how we can all belong, Mai feels 
they are now with more people like them compared to when they first started 
farming. 
1:21:31 
The Asian American Farmers Alliance started when Mai began to realize 
increasingly how alone they were. Mai reached out to Asian American farmers 
and advocates for connection and support. Mai found they all felt alienated and 
wanted to fight that by being in conversation with each other. Their relationships 
have been strengthened by a 
mutual sense of care. The Alliance is committed to 
being in solidarity with Black farmers in their fight for justice; engages in seed 
saving of cultural crops; connects with groups across the country growing Asian 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021 
8 
crops; provides mutual aid during the pandemic; helps members tap into their 
respective heritages and community experiences; and helps them remember the 
knowledge and wisdom they carry with them to be resilient. It is not about the 
larger politics, but about really embracing each other with the warmth, 
connection, and support of a 
family. 
1:24:31 
The group has been in existence for about six years. Recently, it got more 
attention because of the movie Minari, which focuses on a 
Korean American 
farming family. Trying to retain the feeling of family is most important for the 
Alliance members at this time. 
1:25:37 
Mai talks about common themes in the Alliance. There is one contingent of 
farmers that are first or second-generation Asian American and still have strong 
ties to their culture. For them, it is very much about how to run a 
farm business 
(how to afford labor and access markets, stable market channels, and fair prices). 
There is another group of farmers who are maybe mixed race or feel disconnected 
from their Asian American heritage and are farming because they want to 
understand more about themselves and their lineage. They are using farming both 
as a 
means to have food that was a 
part of their lives, and to build community 
with other people who find that food culturally significant. 
Everyone shares a 
feeling of being the one, lone Asian American wherever they 
are farming, and also in the farm advocacy spaces in which they are engaging. 
There are shared challenges around farmland security, wanting people to 
understand their crops, and having the seeds they need to grow their full diets. 
The land is a 
way to be connected to each other and to history, and people are 
excited to have a 
forum with those who have more similar experiences. What is 
their shared experience as Asian Americans when some people are multi-
generational Asian Americans and some are newcomers? What are their cultural 
or historical relationships to each other? What does it mean to be Asian 
American? There is not a 
monolith. They are all coming from a 
place of wanting 
justice, and that starts with caring for each other. 
1:29:47 
Communities that have sustained Mai as an Asian American farmer: the 
community immediately around Mai that will show up; the network of Asian 
American farmers and advocates that help Mai feel seen and understood; in the 
grain world, customers, bakers, and millers who understand how challenging it is 
to grow a 
whole different grain economy and appreciate the flavor of Mai's 
grains; the community of activists who understand that racial equity is about 
supporting each other every step of the way and paying attention to those who are 
not tended to. 
Mai Nguyen Interview Log, February 22, 2021

At the beginning of the pandemic, Mai gathered together a 
trusted group of 
Latinx, Asian American, African American, and Indigenous people to fundraise 
and get resources out to communities in targeted ways. Mai has been heartened to 
feel that they are not alone in their concern for community. There is a 
whole farm 
ecosystem, and in a 
time of urgent need, all of these people were already in place 
to serve the whole community. We are affected by what happens to our 
communities, so serving them makes us all more resilient. 
1:35:13 
Mai advises new BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) farmers to think 
about the place you want to take care of and that will take care of you. When you 
think of that place, where do you want to be in the long run? Is your family there? 
Is your community there? We are a 
part of the land, so in part, the land determines 
where you will be. Think about where you want to be in the long run and if the 
land will receive you. 
1:36:27 
Through hard experiences where there was an immediate threat of physical 
danger, Mai began to realize how much harder it was going to be than they 
thought. These experiences were a 
part of Mai changing their situation and trying 
to shift more toward being close to their community. 
For listeners who are not BIPOC, it is also their role to make it possible for 
BIPOC to be accepted anywhere. It is not the job of BIPOC to do that. The 
acceptance is done by the rest of society, and they need to do that work so BIPOC 
are welcome and safe. 
1:38:43 
Mai says it is nice to focus on the farming experience. Much of their work focuses 
on farmer advocacy, which is supposed to be high-level impact work. Mai hoped 
that having conversations about racial equity might have a 
greater impact at a 
larger scale. However, it has been very disheartening to see how at those scales, 
so much racism still plays out (for example, not including BIPOC in decision 
making around polices that have the potential to make faster and more sweeping 
changes toward racial equity). 
"While we're talking about the experiences of Asian American famers, these 
experiences are in relationship to the rest of society, and ... the rest of the 
society has a 
responsibility in shaping our conditions so that we can thrive."
