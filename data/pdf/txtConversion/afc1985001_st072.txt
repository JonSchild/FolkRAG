Maple on the Hill
MAPLE ON THE HILL 4093 6B2
Nathan and Lois Judd Arvin, 1940
In a quiet country village Grew amaple on the hill Where I sat with my Anita long ago As
the stars were shining brightly We could hear the whipoorwill As we sat beneath the maple
on the hill
Don't forget me little darling When they lay me down to die Just a little wish my darlin' that
I crave - As you linger there in sadness You are thinking of the past And your tears shall
kiss the flowers on my grave.
We that sang lovesongs together When the birds had gone to rest We would listen to the
murmer of the rill. Will you love me little darlin' As you did that starry night When we sat
beneath the maple on the hill.
Don't forget me little darlin' When they lay me down to die Just a little wish my darlin' that
I crave - As you linger there in sadness You are thinking of the past And your tears shall
kiss the flowers on my grave.
Love I'll soon be with the angels On that bright and happy shore Even now I hear them
coming o'er the rill It's goodbye my little darlin' It is time for us to part I must leave you and
the maple on the hill.
