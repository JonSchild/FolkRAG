"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6406B
Martha Casper Berry: I am Martha Casper Berry, a school teacher in the Austin Public Schools at
Austin, Texas. I certainly hope that America will win the war and I think that she will. I am glad that all
of us have the opportunity of buying bonds for two reasons: One, I think that it is ideally to help our
country out. Our country that has done so much for us; And secondly, I think if we all have to buy
bonds that we will be more interested in our government in the future to keep it out of war and will
keep a better eye on the international situation because it will affect us more deeply than it has in
the past.
