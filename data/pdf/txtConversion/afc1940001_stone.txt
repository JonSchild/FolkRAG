The Stone That Goes Rolling will Gather No MossSince times has been hard, I'll tell you,
sweetheart,I've a notion to leave off my plough and my cart,Away to California a journey pursue,To
double my fortunes as other men do,For here we must labor each day in the field,And the winter
consumes all the summer doth yield.O husband I'll tell you with a sorrowful heart,You've now too
long neglected your plough and your cart,Your horses, sheep, cattle are scattered aroundAnd you
use Sunday's jacket most every day on,So stick to your farm and you'll suffer no loss,While the stone
that goes rolling will gather no moss.O wife let's be going, O don't let us wait,I long to be there, I
long to be great,And you some rich lady! and who knows but IMay be some great governor before
that I die.O husband remember your land is to clearIt'll cost you the labor of many a long year;Your
horses, sheep, cattle are all for to buyAnd you'll hardly get settled before you must die.So stick to
your farm and you'll suffer no loss,While the stone that goes rolling will gather no moss.O wife, let's
be going, O don't let us wait,I'll purchase a farm all clear to our hand,Where horses; sheep, cattle are
not very dear,And we'll feed on fat buffalo one half of the year.O husband remember your land of
delightIs surrounded by Indians who murder by night.Your house they will plunder and burn to the
groundWhile your wife and dear children lie bleeding around.So stick to your farm and you'll suffer
no loss;While the stone that goes rolling will gather no moss.O wife you've convinced me, I'll arguer
no more,I never once thought of dying before.I love my little children although they're but small,But
you, my dear wife, I love better than all.I'll stick to my farm and suffer no loss,And the stone that
goes rolling will gather/ no moss.
