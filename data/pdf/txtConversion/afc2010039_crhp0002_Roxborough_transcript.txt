5 [phonetic], Mr. Bond, I'm recording. 
6 Begin the interview. 
7 INTERVIEWER: Ready to go? 
8 FEMALE VOICE: Yes, sir. 
9 INTERVIEWER: Ms. Roxborough, you 
10 were born into an African American 
11 family that was aware of the need to 
12 do what was necessary to improve the 
13 quality of their daily lives. 
14 01:00:32 Can you share with us how your family 
15 made changes in their lives to 
16 improve their situation? 
17 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, we lived in 
18 one of the three counties in the 
19 State of Tennessee, in which blacks 
20 did not vote. One of the things my 
21 parents felt which would be of 
22 paramount importance was to get the 
23 right to vote. They proceeded to 
24 campaign for that purpose by getting 
25 
01: 00 : 55 
other people in the community to join 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 3

26 them to go to the county courthouse 
27 to register to vote. That was a 
28 primary ingredient. This is before 
29 01:01:13 they organized a branch of the NACP. 
30 Of course, they also felt that the 
31 community of blacks in the county-- 
32 Hayward County was the county in 
33 which we lived. The county was 
34 Brownsville in which I was born. 
35 Of course, they felt that it was 
36 important to organize our black 
37 citizens because they outnumbered the 
38 01:01:42 white citizens about 3 to 1. If they 
39 could marshal the black citizens in 
40 greater strength, they could change 
41 the quality of our lives to some 
42 extent by exercising political power. 
43 INTERVIEWER: Did you ever hear your 
44 parents talk about organizing the 
45 first NAACP chapter in Brownsville? 
46 Did you ever hear them discuss it? 
47 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. 
48 01:02:05 INTERVIEWER: What did they have to 
49 say? 
50 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, they said that 
4 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
51 we needed to have people who would be 
52 able to withstand the pressures which 
53 01:02:14 they anticipated would be applied 
54 when they started formally organizing 
55 a group together instead of having an 
56 individual who would join them on 
57 certain occasions. In order to do 
58 this, at that time, as I recall, 
59 Walter White was executive secretary 
60 of the NAACP. I would hear his name 
61 frequently, saying we've got to get 
62 Walter White to authorize a charter 
63 01:02:55 for our unit. Then they rode away to 
64 get enough information about the 
65 number of people who would be 
66 required. 
67 There was much discussion when I was 
68 a youngster. I suppose about this 
69 time I was about 7 years of age, 
70 having been reading The Crisis 
71 because they subscribed to it. I was 
72 well aware of what the NAACP was in 
73 01:03:21 my own perspective.

NAACP. What led you to be willing to 
sell The Crisis, to sell 
subscriptions? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Both my parents 
would teach us. My mother, there 
were three of us, of which I was the 
youngest. My mother or my father 
virtually every evening before I went 
to bed would read poetry, excerpts 
from history, and events to my 
sisters. I would be sitting on my 
mother's lap. Oftentimes, in reading 
poetry, she would quote to them 
saying that this is a piece by 
Langston Hughes, which was published 
in The Crisis Magazine. Of course, I 
wanted to know what The Crisis was 
after having heard her say that so 
often. She said, "You'll see it. 
It's here on the desk," or wherever. 
I would start looking for The Crisis 
after hearing my mother mention the 
fact that they actually were reading 
excerpts from things that appeared 
100 
therein. That's how I learned about 
6

101 The Crisis. 
102 INTERVIEWER: How’d you come to sell 
103 01:04:33 subscriptions? 
104 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, I noticed they 
105 had in some ad in the paper 
106 indicating that subscriptions were 
107 available. I said one day, "Can I 
108 write to Roy Wilkins [phonetic]," who 
109 was the editor of The Crisis, "and 
110 ask him if I can sell The Crisis?" 
111 After all, if you're going to have a 
112 chapter of the NAACP, then--my 
113 01:05:01 language wasn't as it is today, as 
114 you can appreciate--they said, "By 
115 all means, but you must write the 
116 letter yourself." I said I'll do 
117 that, so I did. 
118 INTERVIEWER: Did he write back? 
119 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I heard—I don't 
120 know if it was from him--saying we 
121 will be glad to have you sell The 
122 Crisis Magazine. In any event, it 
123 was typed, but it had his signature 
124 01:05:23 on it and under his name it said 
125 
editor. I was so proud to get that 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 7 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
126 letter from the editor of The Crisis. 
127 I was beside myself. 
128 01:05:35 INTERVIEWER: I bet. Can you share 
129 any details with us about what 
130 happened to your father as a result 
131 of his civil rights activities in 
132 1939? 
133 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, by 1939 the 
134 branch had been organized. He was 
135 the president and my mother was 
136 secretary. During those intervening 
137 years, my father had been arrested 
138 01:06:01 and taken to jail a few times, but 
139 not formally charged. He was usually 
140 let go. However, one evening he was 
141 brought home having been rather badly 
142 beaten. The sheriff and a deputy-- 
143 anyway, they were law enforcement 
144 officials--brought him home and 
145 opened the front door, which wasn't 
146 locked because in those days you 
147 didn't lock your door until you went 
148 01:06:32 to bed at night I think. I was home 
149 alone. My mother was at a meeting. 
150 They brought him in and dumped him on 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 8 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
151 the couch really. They said, "Take 
152 care of your pa. He's been hurt. If 
153 01:06:45 he had not had connections, he would 
154 be in jail." I was of course 
155 frightened. I was about 9 at the 
156 time. When my mother came home, I 
157 said to her these two men brought 
158 them home and they said to me if he 
159 did not have connections, he would be 
160 in jail. I said what does that mean? 
161 She looked at me. She said I guess I 
162 should tell you the county coroner of 
163 01:07:20 Haywood County--his name was John 
164 Severe [phonetic]--was a doctor. She 
165 said Dr. Severe probably asked them 
166 not to do anything to your father 
167 because he's your grandmother's half 
168 brother. He was white and of course 
169 my grandmother was black. She said 
170 that Dr. Severe is widely respected 
171 and they tried to be as accommodating 
172 to him as they could. 
173 01:07:53 INTERVIEWER: When you were a student 
174 at Howard and later Washington Square 
175 Campus of NYU in the '50s, you recall 
9 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
176 how you and other students felt about 
177 segregation and the lack of civil 
178 01:08:03 rights that most African Americans 
179 endured? 
180 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, I recall that 
181 we went to I think it's the Howard 
182 Theater in Washington. You weren't 
183 welcome in the other theaters as 
184 such, except on a segregated basis. 
185 We were concerned about that. This 
186 was during World War II that I was at 
187 Howard. During wartime, we were 
188 01:08:38 concerned about our good and welfare 
189 as students. Also, why couldn't we 
190 go into many of the places, which 
191 were still segregated in Washington? 
192 There was much discussion about that 
193 among us. We probably didn't do very 
194 much, but periodically a few of us 
195 would undertake to go into a 
196 restaurant and be denied entrance. 
197 But it never became an issue in the 
198 01:09:11 sense of escalating into arrest at 
199 that point in time. That was a 
200 
little early. This was 1943. From

'43 to '45, I was at Howard. 
Of course we were also concerned 
about our studies. There were a lot 
of uniformed young men on the campus 
as a part of the training program 
that the federal government had at 
that point in time. 
INTERVIEWER: You joined the NAACP on 
the staff in 1953 right before the 
Brown decision and a little more than 
a year and a half before Emmett Till 
was murdered. Share with us the mood 
of the NAACP staff and leadership, 
and tell us about some of the 
personalities you met. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, I don't want 
to give you a wandering answer. I 
started work in the fall of 1953 to 
do a special project for Gloster 
Current, director of branches in 
Baltimore, Maryland, which was one of 
our largest branches in the country. 
It also had as its president a Dr. 
Lily M. Jackson, who was very well 
225 
known throughout the country because

and aggressive NAACP leader well 
respected in Baltimore, and difficult 
to please. 
Gloster Current at a staff meeting 
Introduced me as a temporary field 
secretary, and that I was going to 
Baltimore to do a six-week membership 
campaign for the Baltimore branch. 
Thurgood Marshall, who was sitting a 
couple of seats away from me laughed 
loudly and said, "Gloster, why are 
you doing that to that girl? You 
should be ashamed of yourself." 
I did not know what that meant until 
I got to Baltimore and found how 
demanding and difficult it was to 
work for Ms. Jackson, but I did. We 
had a membership campaign which ran 
for six weeks. Her daughter, Juanita 
Jackson Mitchell, at that time, was a 
first organizer of the youth program 
for the national NAACP. 
She worked with me and we survived 
250 
each other. I was baptized in that

worked. At that point, there was a 
man who was the president of Parks 
Sausage, which was an early black 
corporation which was if not the 
first of its kind, was one of the 
first of its kind. One of the great 
founders was a locally well-known man 
whose income supposedly was derived 
from numbers and that type of thing. 
I became very friendly with those men 
and was able to get them to support 
the NAACP. Those were the extremes. 
Ms. Jackson was a great church leader 
and these men were on the other side 
of the spectrum. They came together 
for the purpose of supporting this 
common cause. 
INTERVIEWER: Would that have been 
Henry Parks? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, Henry G. Parks. 
The man was William Adams.

Henry Parks. I was quite young then. 
INTERVIEWER: Let me take you back to 
the New York office and the people 
you met there. Thurgood Marshall, 
whom you just mentioned a moment ago, 
obviously you knew of him because 
you'd been active in the NAACP as a 
young girl and in later years. What 
were your impressions of him when you 
met him? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, first of all, 
I had to get accustomed to his 
language. I never heard so many cuss 
words in my life, which was colorful. 
Nobody minded. He was a wonderful 
raconteur. He had a tremendous sense 
of humor. I said this is Thurgood 
Marshall? 
He was also very effective in getting 
you to do things and making difficult 
subjects sound easy. He said we'll 
be going to Hoxie, Arkansas. He said 
you'll be able to do that. It'll be 
a good first experience for you to 
14 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
301 get to know the parents there and the 
302 children. It'll be something that 
303 01:13:54 you'll remember for years to come. 
304 Of course, he was right, but it 
305 wasn't pie like he claimed that it 
306 would be. But he was good at getting 
307 people to do things and also 
308 inspiring them. He's an 
309 exceptionally bright man, but it was 
310 all beneath this demeanor of 
311 roughness and semi-crudeness. It's a 
312 manner he affected, and he did well 
313 01:14:19 with making you comfortable with him. 
314 INTERVIEWER: What were your 
315 impressions of Roy Wilkins? 
316 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Very elegant man, 
317 one who was extremely similar, 
318 concerned about the language and its 
319 use, the syntax and sentence 
320 structure. Of course, I learned much 
321 about grammar and composition from 
322 Roy Wilkins, who wrote beautifully. 
323 He also was a very unpretentious 
324 01:14:47 person. He did not want any 
325 
ceremony. He rode the subway, which

coming to work. He did not want 
bodyguards or attendants. 
He was a purist when it came to 
commitment to the association. He 
wanted the staff to dedicate 
themselves to achieving the goals 
which were set out for them in terms 
of their work and to at all times be 
properly attired and achieve the 
right demeanor to present the NAACP 
as a wholesome, serious organization 
who had intelligent people as its 
representatives. 
INTERVIEWER: Walter White? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Walter White was 
colorful. He enjoyed people. He 
embraced people and he enjoyed the 
social interaction. He also liked 
the spotlight. Wilkins, on the other 
hand, did not seek the spotlight. He 
tolerated it, but Walter White 
349 
01: 15:58 
thrived in the spotlight. Also, 
350 
because of his people skills and his 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 16 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
351 ability to interact, he was able to 
352 get certain information in terms of 
353 doing his research. He was very 
354 01:16:14 fair. He would be presumed to be 
355 Caucasian, unless you would know 
356 otherwise. He was successful in 
357 going into places like Mississippi, 
358 Georgia, and Arkansas and 
359 investigating lynchings and other 
360 incidents, and coming back without 
361 having been assaulted or thrown in 
362 jail. He enjoyed that kind of 
363 activity and the fact that he could 
364 01:16:41 live in these two worlds. It was 
365 effective. 
366 INTERVIEWER: A moment ago you 
367 mentioned Hoxie, Arkansas, and that 
368 took, you into contact with Daisy 
369 Bates. What do you recall about 
370 Daisy Bates? 
371 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Ms. Bates was a very 
372 dedicated civil rights worker, but 
373 she also had a sense of style. She 
374 01:17:03 enjoyed the spotlight as well. She 
375 was not ever shy. At that time, the 
17 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE

Line# Timecode Quote 
376 governor of Arkansas was Orval 
377 Faubus. He was known to be anti- 
378 black, a segregationist, and was 
379 01:17:24 determined to keep the schools in 
380 Arkansas separate. Of course, Daisy 
381 Bates on the other hand--this is in 
382 the '50s now. This is just before 
383 '56. This was 1954, when I first 
384 went to Little Rock. Then I went 
385 back two or three years after that 
386 during this period leading up to the 
387 integration of Central High. 
388 Daisy was colorful, aggressive, and 
389 01:17:54 she didn't mind the spotlight. She 
390 was very talkative. She too was a 
391 people person. She was able to get 
392 branches and what we call the little 
393 people and the simple people, many of 
394 whom were very literate to follow and 
395 come in to the NAACP. At this point 
396 in time, we were focusing on 
397 education to get their children, who 
398 were students, a better education.

who had never been active before. 
INTERVIEWER: A moment ago, when you 
and I were talking, we mentioned Rosa 
Parks. What are your memories of 
Rosa Parks? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, Ms. Parks was 
a very charming and gracious lady. I 
think I said at one point laconic. 
She was of few words, but when she 
spoke, you listened to her. She was 
very kind. In those days, when you 
traveled as a field secretary as I 
was, you would stay in the homes of 
NAACP people in various parts of the 
country. Usually they were officers 
of the branch. Once when I first 
went to Montgomery, I stayed with Ms. 
Parks. This is before of course she 
left Alabama. She and her husband 
both were very pleasant and 
comfortable people. They were 
quietly militant. They weren't 
bombastic. They didn't make a lot of 
425 
noise about it. They just would act. 
19 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
426 At that point, she was still 
427 secretary of the branch. She was 
428 very determined that we should do 
429 01:19:50 more with our youth. She was 
430 focusing at that time a lot in 
431 getting the youth in Montgomery to 
432 organize and to take certain steps in 
433 terms of preparing them to move 
434 forward in the integration movement. 
435 INTERVIEWER: Do you remember E.D. 
436 Nixon, the president of Montgomery 
437 Branch, a Pullman car porter. 
438 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, I do. 
439 01:20:14 INTERVIEWER: What do you recall 
440 about him? 
441 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, he was a very 
442 dedicated person with a strong 
443 commitment to civil rights. He was 
444 committed to the NAACP and the way he 
445 believed that we had to have an

450 
the pressure in Alabama to take a

451 stand. He refused to give up the 
452 membership roles of the NAACP in 
453 Alabama when the Attorney General 
454 01:20:56 demanded it. After that period, you 
455 may recall, the NAACP was banned from 
456 operating in Alabama. 
457 INTERVIEWER: You had been at the 
458 NAACP about a year and a half when 
459 news comes that this boy, Emmett 
460 Till, has been found dead in a river 
461 in Mississippi. Do you remember 
462 hearing the news about that and what 
463 the reaction of the people in the 
464 01:21:20 office here were? 
465 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. I remember. 
466 It was considered in our office to be 
467 a great tragedy because just before 
468 then--I'm sorry I can't remember the 
469 town--one of our branch presidents 
470 had been killed in Mississippi. 
471 INTERVIEWER: Gus Counch [phonetic]. 
472 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I think yeah. We 
473 were in the throws of that. Because 
474 the NAACP was encouraging them to 
475

continue the voter education

476 registration campaign, this brought 
477 about his death, the branch 
478 presidents. This one child, as he 
479 01:22:07 was presumed to be, was killed. It 
480 was felt at that point that 
481 Mississippi was completely going out 
482 of bounds, and that nothing was 
483 sacred or safe in the state. The 
484 NAACP really had to stay behind its 
485 people to help them and to keep them 
486 from having to cave in or to become 
487 too intimidated to keep the movement 
488 going. If the NAACP didn't continue 
489 01:22:42 to function, then we would not be 
490 able to do anything about an Emmett 
491 Till. This was the great concern, 
492 whether this would stop the movement. 
493 INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any 
494 interaction with Mamie Bradley, 
495 Emmett Till's mother? 
496 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. I arranged a 
497 tour, I guess, of NAACP branches for 
498 Ms. Bradley to visit. Actually, I 
499 01:23:14 accompanied her for some of the time 
500 
to some of the cities, which we 
22 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project

501 arranged for her to visit. She was a 
502 woman who was very articulate. As 
503 she campaigned or visited the units 
504 01:23:33 across the country I should say, she 
505 grew more militant and more informed, 
506 and became more involved. Then of 
507 course she started speaking more 
508 forcefully and making demand which 
509 should be met in terms of acquisition 
510 of civil rights and justice for her 
511 son. She insisted, for example, on 
512 opening the casket when he was 
513 funeralized in Chicago, which was 
514 01:24:06 quite an experience for one to have 
515 to see him lying in the casket and 
516 showing the evidences of him having 
517 been killed. 
518 INTERVIEWER: Before we began this 
519 interview, you and I were talking 
520 about Clarence Norris, one of the 
521 Scottsboro Boys. Tell that story 
522 once again, how you came to know him. 
523 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Our office moved to 
524 
01: 24 : 32 
1790 Broadway, off Columbus Circle. 
525 
One day this man came into the office 
23 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
526 and the switchboard operator called 
527 me to say we have a man here who 
528 needs help, which often that 
529 01:24:45 happened. At that point I was I 
530 think executive assistant to Roy 
531 Wilkins or assistant director between 
532 Mr. Wilkins and Dr. Marcel 
533 [phonetic]. I went out to see this 
534 man and it developed his name was 
535 Clarence Norris. 
536 INTERVIEWER: Did you recognize him? 
537 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Not at first, but 
538 then after he started talking I 
539 realized 
540 01:25:12 that I had seen his pictures, and 
541 that he was one of the Scottsboro 
542 Boys. He said-- 
543 INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] He was a 
544 fugitive, was he not? 
545 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, he was. He had 
546 been for several years, so this was 
547 not new. We knew this in the NAACP 
548 that he had escaped. 
549 INTERVIEWER: But you didn’t know 
550 
01:25:30 
where he was and didn't know he'd 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 2 4

Line# Timecode Quote 
551 walk into the office, did you? 
552 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I didn’t have the 
553 faintest idea he was in the New York 
554 area. This had to be I guess in the 
555 01:25:40 late '60s. He said, "I went to the 
556 old office years ago," meaning 20 
557 West 40th Street, "and I met the lady 
558 who was the office manager. He 
559 described her. I said, "Ms. Branch?" 
560 He said yes. He said, "If she's 
561 here, she'll help me." I said, "You 
562 need help?" He said yes. I called 
563 Bobbie Branch and asked her if I 
564 could bring him around to her. She 
565 01:26:11 said yes. She remembered him. 
566 Our officer manager then, as you 
567 might recall, Bobbie Branch, embraced 
568 people. She was very gregarious. 
569 She welcomed him and said, "I'll help 
570 you. What do you need?" He needed 
571 some money of course. He said his 
572 wife, I believe, that first time--I 
573 think his wife was ill. She said, 
574 "Well, let me see if Mr. Wilkins is 
575 
01:26:43 
here and I'll take you over to meet

but Dr. Marcel was. 
He met Dr. Marcel and they talked. 
Dr. Marcel was a very thoughtful-- 
[break in video] --if we had provided 
some further assistance. Willie 
Norris said, "Yes, I need assistance. 
I want to clear my name before I 
die." That's how this relationship 
again with him was resumed after the 
NAACP many, many years ago had been 
instrumental in helping them until a 
political problem arose where the 
communist party became involved and 
the NAACP stepped aside. That was 
when he was a much younger man, 
shortly after having been arrested 
for the rape to begin with. 
INTERVIEWER: He escaped and came to 
New York City, and now he's coming to 
the NAACP and making a request for 
assistance for pardon. How did that 
follow through? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Actually, for money 
it was his first request. When he 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 2 6 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
601 01:27:50 met and talked with John Marcel, 
602 Marcel said we want to see how we can 
603 provide some meaningful assistance 
604 for you, meaning to try to get him 
605 01:28:07 settled into a job and whatever. He 
606 said, "I want to clear my name before 
607 I die." That's really when our 
608 general counsel--not that visit--but 
609 it was arranged to give him some 
610 money and for him to return. When he 
611 returned it was then he talked 
612 without general counsel. 
613 Mr. Wilkins had spoken to Nathaniel 
614 Jones, who was our general counsel at 
615 01:28:35 that point, and asked if you would 
616 join Wilkins when Mr. Norris came 
617 back into the office. From that 
618 point on, Nathaniel Jones became the 
619 person who was exploring how our 
620 legal department could help him. He 
621 assigned one of the bright, young 
622 attorneys, whose name was James 
623 Meyerson [phonetic], to work on the 
624 issue of getting a full pardon for 
625 01:29:04 Willie Norris.

INTERVIEWER: Jones and Norris go to 
Alabama and secure his pardon. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Meet the governor 
and the attorney general and get a 
full pardon from then for Willie. 
INTERVIEWER: That’s a wonderful, 
wonderful story. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Following that, the 
book was written. The Last of the 
Scottsboro Boys. 
INTERVIEWER: Many young people 
became involved in the NAACP through 
youth council. For a time you worked 
as field secretary and director of 
education. What were your goals for 
the programs that involved young 
people? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, first I should 
say I was never director of 
education. June Shagaloff was. I 
was director of a lot of things. I 
can't remember all of the jobs I had.

651 Every five years I would transfer to 
652 a new job. I was an assistant 
653 director to the executive and a 
654 director, and then finally director 
655 01:30:07 of operations and director of 
656 programs, under which education fell 
657 at that point. I'm sorry; I forgot 
658 the other part of the question. 
659 INTERVIEWER: What were the goals 
660 that you worked on that involved 
661 young people? What were the programs

663 young people? 
664 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, the programs 
665 01:30:29 which involved young people and which 
666 I worked early on were ACT-SO, which 
667 is the Academic, Cultural, Scientific 
668 Olympics. They subsequently added 
669 Afro to the title. That was for the 
670 purpose of developing academic 
671 excellence and general achievement as 
672 far as youth were concerned. It

general, and the youth were organized

676 on a local level according to the 
677 program. 
678 This program was founded by Benjamin 
679 Hooks and Vernon Jarrett, who was a 
680 01:31:24 newspaper reporter from Chicago. 
681 Benjamin became the successor to Roy 
682 Wilkins. We organized units across 
683 the country such similar to youth 
684 units with an advisor for ACT-SO. 
685 The idea was to recruit those who 
686 showed promise locally. They do have 
687 local competitions, then regional 
688 competitions, then national 
689 competitions. The program is still 
690 01:31:50 going strong today. There are some 
691 600 ACT-SO units across the country 
692 which are actively engaged. One here 
693 in metropolitan New York, where we 
694 are at the moment, is the largest one 
695 because there are some 17 branches 
696 who participate. 
697 INTERVIEWER: If you count the local 
698 branch participation, this is 
699 probably the largest African American

702 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, and the most 
703 enduring. Scholarships are given; 
704 rewards are given; medals are given 
705 01:32:29 at the national convention. We have 
706 had such people as I was trying to 
707 think of some people who have come 
708 through the ACT-SO program. I think 
709 there's a young man who was the 
710 conductor of a symphony who appears 
711 at Lincoln Center, who was an ACT-SO 
712 graduate. We have others. I don't 
713 want to try to name names because 
714 I'll leave out some who-- 
715 01:32:59 INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] They're a 
716 distinguished group of achievers. 
717 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, absolutely. 
718 INTERVIEWER: A moment ago you talked 
719 about Roy Wilkins succeeding Walter 
720 White. Walter White died. 
721 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, he did. 
722 INTERVIEWER: Roy Wilkins was named 
723 to succeed him. Do you remember any 
724 discussion whether or not Roy Wilkins 
725 
01: 33 : 19 
should have succeeded him or was 
31 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
726 there another candidate? 
727 MS. ROXBOROUGH: No, not at that 
728 time. Walter White died in 1955 
729 suddenly. He had been ill and on 
730 leave. He had 
731 01:33:39 a leave of absence, Walter White, and 
732 Roy Wilkins had been serving as 
733 administrator. In his absence as 
734 executive, he took over the duties of 
735 executive secretary. When Walter 
736 White died while on leave, Roy 
737 Wilkins--after the funeral of course- 
738 -at the next board meeting I believe 
739 it was, at the spring board meeting, 
740 was named his successor. There had 
741 01:34:09 been some earlier discussions prior 
742 to this. When Walter White had a 
743 leave of absence before, he went 
744 around the world I believe a few 
745 years before that. There was some 
746 discussion then about whether Roy 
747 Wilkins would be his successor. 
748 INTERVIEWER: Succeeding Roy Wilkins 
749 was Benjamin Hooks. 
750 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. 
32 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
751 01:34:30 INTERVIEWER: Describe him. 
752 MS. ROXBOROUGH: He was a Baptist 
753 minister, and a dramatic Baptist 
754 minister. His oratorical skills were 
755 great. He enjoyed demonstrating as 
756 01:34:45 he spoke. He inspired our 
757 constituents. Whereas Roy Wilkins 
758 was an intellectual-type speaker who 
759 would lay the facts out in elegant 
760 prose, Mr. Hooks demonstrated his 
761 speeches frequently by his physical 
762 activities at the podium. He used 
763 shall I say the gospel approach in 
764 terms of inspiring our constituents. 
765 He was effective. He got the kind of 
766 01:35:19 visceral response which people enjoy 
767 during the course of speeches. He 
768 could inspire them also not just to 
769 respond to him, but to become 
770 actively engaged in the work of the 
771 NAACP. 
772 He kept our constituents committed in 
773 the units across the country. He 
774 tried to travel as much as he could 
775 because they are the connection 
33 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
776 01:35:43 between the national office and the 
777 constituents. If they aren't 
778 actively engaged in the 50 states 
779 across the country, then the NAACP's 
780 presence is not being brought to the 
781 01:35:55 fore as it should be and to show how 
782 forceful it can be. It is the only 
783 organization of its kind which has 
784 shall I say 1,700 units in the 50 
785 states for some 500 youth and college 
786 units. 
787 INTERVIEWER: Why do you think it is 
788 that the NAACP's accomplishments and 
789 achievements are not as well known as 
790 one would think they'd be? After 
791 01:36:21 all, the organization's 100 years old 
792 plus, and has a remarkable record of 
793 achievement and accomplishment. Yet 
794 it doesn't seem to be as well known 
795 as one would think it would be. Why 
796 do you think that is? 
797 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I have no idea 
798 except that we as a people don't 
799 focus on our history and our 
800 heritage. The NAACP was here before 
34 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
801 most all of us 
802 01:36:50 were here at this point. As it has 
803 achieved many accomplishments, 
804 actually, it has affected the order 
805 of life for all of us, whatever color 
806 we are. What is more for our 
807 01:37:07 reaching than the interstate travel 
808 bill, for example, the desegregation 
809 of the public schools or the public 
810 accommodations laws where everybody 
811 could get access to places? What 
812 happens I believe is we forget our 
813 history. 
814 We live in the period and then we 
815 take for granted what there is, and 
816 do not retain it as an achievement 
817 01:37:36 which had been caused by the hard 
818 work of those who came on before us. 
819 We don't really as a people in this 
820 country--not just the black people-- 
821 we don't really focus on our own 
822 American history, what has happened 
823 at various periods, and the 
824 transitions through which we have 
825 gone. We forget. Then we take for

Line# Timecode Quote 
826 granted this is my right. It's here 
827 01:38:05 now. We don't think about how it was 
828 in the past. The NAACP has been 
829 actually forgotten a lot of times 
830 when it was the only instrument which 
831 was able to achieve certain things 
832 01:38:20 which we now enjoy. I don't have an 
833 answer. 
834 INTERVIEWER: I don't either. Let me 
835 mention some organizations, some of 
836 which have come and gone in the span 
837 of the NAACP's history. Give me your 
838 impressions of them. The Southern 
839 Christian Leadership Conference. 
840 MS. ROXBOROUGH: SCLC? 
841 INTERVIEWER: SCLC. 
842 01:38:41 MS. ROXBOROUGH: My impression? 
843 Well, I think the SCLC was an 
844 effective organization in the sense 
845 that it brought to the fore in the 
846 minds of the public that the 
847 religious leaders in this country 
848 were engaged in and active in terms 
849 of passing the word of our civil 
850 rights and providing inspiration and 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 3 6 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
851 leadership to their congregations 
852 throughout the country. 
853 01:39:15 We should be mindful and become 
854 engaged in this struggle, and we can 
855 do by showing ourselves and lending 
856 our voices. SCLC was flexible 
857 because its leaders could go from one 
858 01:39:31 community to the other and call 
859 together the religious leaders in a 
860 given community to provide a voice 
861 for a particular cause and a 
862 particular action. I think it was 
863 helpful in that respect in terms of 
864 setting before us actively through 
865 the pulpits what it was we needed to 
866 do and what we must do. 
867 INTERVIEWER: What about the Student 
868 01:39:57 Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, my 
869 old organization, SNCC? 
870 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. Well you know 
871 more about that than I do. I 
872 certainly think that the sit-ins were 
873 extraordinary in the sense that they 
874 opened the eyes of the old folks, the 
875 adults in the country. This I can do

That's something all of us could do. 
The students demonstrated that this 
is something that had not been done, 
01:40:35 and that we're going to do it. They 
did and it was impressive. It 
inspired us as older people to really 
go out and demonstrate. If our youth 
can do it, our children can do it, 
then why won't we do it? 
INTERVIEWER: What about the Congress 
of Racial Equality, CORE? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: CORE was a little 
more intellectual. It had an 
excellent 
01:40:57 leader in James Farmer, who formally 
worked for the NAACP as our program 
director. Many of these leaders by 
the way of the other organizations 
had gotten their grounding and their 
foundations in the NAACP, such as 
Martin Luther King, Jr. did. His

integrated than the other groups were 
in terms of racial integration. It 
appealed to a younger group in 
general, students and young adults, 
and they were concerned about 
demonstrating in black and white the 
acquisition of the goals they wanted 
to achieve. They had certainly an 
impact--! believe CORE did--in terms 
of encouraging non-blacks to 
participate actively in the civil 
rights movement. 
INTERVIEWER: What about the Black 
Panther Party? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, the Black 
Panther Party I believe had the 
energy and the ambition, and a sense 
in my judgment of misdirection 
eventually. It started as a militant 
group wanting to use its power and 
apply it actively. Then it veered 
towards separation and separatism. 
Black power became an instrument, in

926 my judgment, to shall I say encourage 
927 and focus on black separatism, which 
928 I believe and am convinced was then 
929 01:42:47 self-defeating and would be today. 
930 INTERVIEWER: Back to the NAACP for a 
931 moment, I think many people think of 
932 the NAACP primarily as a legal 
933 organization. It's an organization 
934 01:42:59 that achieved change through legal 
935 means through the courts. Do you 
936 think this fairly characterizes the 
937 NAACP? 
938 MS. ROXBOROUGH: No. 
939 INTERVIEWER: Why not? 
940 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, one of the 
941 first executive orders that President 
942 Roosevelt--not one of the first ones, 
943 but an executive order that President 
944 01:43:22 Roosevelt issued about the arms 
945 services, the preliminary one, was 
946 done as a result of the NAACP's 
947 lobbying and campaigning and the fact 
948 that Ms. Roosevelt was on our board 
949 of directors. Walter White and Ms. 
950 Roosevelt had a good relationship.

Roosevelt to work with Walter White 
and Phillip Randolph, and to get 
President Roosevelt to understand 
that an executive order desegregating 
federal installations should be 
issued. Of course that wasn't 
integration, but it was a first step. 
That was done without any legal 
action. 
The first civil rights law was 
achieved primarily through lobbying 
and under the aegis of Clarence 
Mitchell, the Washington Bureau. 
Again, that historic was passed by 
congress as a result of lobbying. It 
was within the confines of reality, 
but it wasn't an illegal act. I 
think the public accommodations are a 
lot of the same things. There are so 
many things which widely affect our 
society, which the NAACP inspired, 
led and accomplished, which were not 
legal actions; such actions as far as 
litigation is concerned.

INTERVIEWER: Again, this may be 
redundant. Why is it that many 
people think of the NAACP as 
primarily a legal organization and 
these other activities that you've 
mentioned aren't associated in the 
public mind with the NAACP? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: I suspect one of the 
reasons is our lawyers appeared 
before the Supreme Court so many 
times. Former general counsel Robert 
Carter had made some 36 appearances 
before the Supreme Court and won 
about 30 of those cases. Before 
that, Thurgood Marshall, before he 
became a justice when he was NAACP 
counsel, appeared before the Supreme 
Court. I can't remember the exact 
number now, but it was more than two 
dozen times and of course most of 
those cases were won. This of 
course, the publicity of these cases, 
set in the minds of people that legal 
action is responsible for our 
1000 
progress in this country, and to an 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 42 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1001 important extent it is. Without the 
1002 grass roots lobbying and without the 
1003 meticulous work of putting before our 
1004 01:46:22 congressman both on local, state, and 
1005 federal levels the need to enact 
1006 certain laws and the pressure from 
1007 the grass roots, we would not be 
1008 where we are today. 
1009 01:46:36 INTERVIEWER: Skipping to another 
1010 personality, do you think Malcolm X 
1011 had any effect during his life on the 
1012 NAACP or civil rights generally 
1013 speaking? Did his death or his 
1014 murder have an impact on the NAACP, 
1015 particularly in northern cities, 
1016 northern communities? 
1017 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, this is one 
1018 person's opinion. I think certainly 
1019 01:47:04 he demonstrated the fact that 
1020 discipline could be achieved in 
1021 leadership. He exercised discipline 
1022 in the sense of the followers who 
1023 became committed to the movement 
1024 which he lead believed and committed 
1025 themselves to conforming the 
43 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1026 guidelines and expectations. These 
1027 were in so many instances young men 
1028 who had been street people, who had 
1029 01:47:40 no commitment as such except to 
1030 survive the best way they could for 
1031 themselves. They became part of a 
1032 cohesive group, interacting with each 
1033 other, and willing to help each 
1034 01:47:52 other, and then project this on to 
1035 the community. I think that's one 
1036 excellent cause he served. 
1037 I believe that his death did have a 
1038 serious impact because of the fact 
1039 that it represented the death of a 
1040 leader who had a following over whom 
1041 he had shall I say such vast 
1042 experience that they could be 
1043 effectively banned together to 
1044 01:48:27 achieve progress by folks who have 
1045 been formally on the streets and who 
1046 have formally not been engaged in any 
1047 meaningful activity. This was 
1048 important example it seems to me for 
1049 those of us in civil rights, not that 
1050 we agree with all of his philosophy.

INTERVIEWER: Do you think you could 
feel a measurable impact that he had, 
particularly after his death, that 
there were people within the NAACP 
perhaps who said perhaps in some ways 
we should emulate his dedication, his 
conviction? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: I think there were 
some people like that. Measurably 
there were, especially among our 
youth. They felt that he had the 
right idea in terms of his discipline 
and his rhetoric, which became more 
bland before he died than it was when 
he began when he was preaching almost 
anarchy at one point in time. He 
modified his position to develop 
pressure on what he called the power 
structure by threatening and also 
showing that he represented a force n 
the community--in the society I 
should say, not just the community. 
I think this impressed especially our 
younger adults and youth in the 
1075 
NAACP. You had a reaction that they 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 4 5 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1076 believed that he was on the right 
1077 track or he's a good example for us 
1078 to follow. 
1079 01:50:16 INTERVIEWER: You were married to an 
1080 attorney who worked with the NAACP to 
1081 effect change. How did his work 
1082 construct your lives together? 
1083 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, before I knew 
1084 01:50:28 him, John, he was Chairman of the 
1085 Legal and Redress Committee of 
1086 Detroit Branch, having been born in 
1087 Michigan and reared in Michigan. 
1088 When I first went to Detroit to work 
1089 with the NAACP branch there and 
1090 Arthur Johnson as executive 
1091 secretary, we were organizing the 
1092 first Freedom Fund and Life 
1093 Membership dinner. 
1094 01:50:56 At that point, the Legal and Redress 
1095 Committee of the Detroit Branch was 
1096 very active, and they had won two or 
1097 three cases in Michigan before the 
1098 Michigan Supreme Court involving 
1099 housing and education. John was the 
1100 lead lawyer in those particular 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 4 6 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1101 cases. It was after then that I got 
1102 to know him. I always felt that the 
1103 Detroit Branch was an excellent 
1104 01:51:30 example of the kind of activities and 
1105 accomplishments that an NAACP branch 
1106 should undertake. 
1107 Of course, the work of the legal 
1108 committee actually got commendations 
1109 01:51:46 from the national office and Thurgood 
1110 Marshall, who was then our general 
1111 counsel. That kind of thing 
1112 impressed me about the importance of 
1113 having a varied scope of activity in 
1114 the civil rights movement. Of 
1115 course, he on the other hand was 
1116 supportive of the Detroit Branch's 
1117 other activities. We were, shall I 
1118 say, compatible in the sense, and we 
1119 01:52:12 share an interest in terms of civil 
1120 rights. That wasn't the reason we 
1121 married, but that was one of the 
1122 reasons of the common interest in the 
1123 early days. 
1124 INTERVIEWER: Thinking about the 
1125 Detroit Branch from your perspective 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 4 7 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1126 and what you've seen over the years, 
1127 what is it that makes branch A 
1128 effective, efficient, hard-fighting 
1129 01:52:34 and so on; and branch B lackluster, 
1130 sleepy, do-nothing? 
1131 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Its leadership. I 
1132 believe it's the leadership. The 
1133 extent which your leadership 
1134 01:52:45 inspires, the board, and the members 
1135 will be the extent to which they 
1136 respond and become creative and are 
1137 inspired to become creative and do 
1138 things in a more positive and 
1139 forceful nature. I think the key is 
1140 in the kind of leadership branches 
1141 have across the country. 
1142 INTERVIEWER: Let me ask you to talk 
1143 about some occasions in the past over 
1144 01:53:12 time when the leadership of the NAACP 
1145 has faced real challenges or 
1146 difficult circumstances. I'm 
1147 thinking about the barring of the 
1148 NAACP in Alabama, the lawsuit against 
1149 the NAACP in Mississippi because of 
1150 the boycott. Let's talk about those

INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] I mean 
New York, in the New York Office. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: About the national 
office. 
INTERVIEWER: National office. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: First of all, they 
were defiant, one. We are not going 
to give those membership lists up. 
That was the first thing. Second, 
we've got to find a way to work 
around this and continue our work. 
We had employed recently Ms. Ruby 
Hurley [phonetic] who was sent to 
Alabama to organize units of the 
NAACP in the southeast region, which 
is the confederate states. Ms. 
Hurley had been in Alabama not too 
long--I guess probably less than a 
year--doing this and organizing units 
headquartered in Birmingham, as I

1176 recall. 
1177 She moved after the NAACP was banned. 
1178 The office there was moved to 
1179 Atlanta, but as a result of that, she 
1180 01:54:36 and some other NAACP volunteer 
1181 workers would visit these states in 
1182 which the NAACP had been banned, 
1183 Alabama and I forget the other state. 
1184 There were two states whose 
1185 01:54:59 membership roles were taken, would 
1186 not be given up I should say. In any 
1187 case, the thing I wanted to say is 
1188 Ms. Hurley and other volunteers went 
1189 almost surreptitiously into 
1190 communities to work, again, 
1191 memberships with the NAACP and to 
1192 organize certain things like getting 
1193 petitions signed and to get them to 
1194 get organized to go to the polls to 
1195 01:55:32 register, go to the courthouse or 
1196 wherever to register and vote. 
1197 It was done under the cover of night 
1198 so to speak without the banner of the 
1199 NAACP in the daytime having these 
1200 meetings. It made it shall I say 
50 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1201 dangerous. Ms. Hurley was threatened 
1202 many times. Her life was threatened 
1203 and she was in danger doing this, but 
1204 she was a 
1205 01:55:56 spokesperson who was able to get 
1206 these groups in these various states 
1207 in Alabama and Georgia and 
1208 Mississippi to come together to agree 
1209 to do certain things in terms of 
1210 01:56:09 continuing the fight for civil rights 
1211 in their communities. 
1212 INTERVIEWER: What about when the 
1213 local leadership would be under 
1214 attack, as in the case of Medgar 
1215 Evers assassination? What was the 
1216 New York Headquarters' response? 
1217 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, its response 
1218 was to send people into Mississippi 
1219 to fill the void; actually, to 
1220 reassure 
1221 01:56:30 the people that the NAACP was 
1222 continuing its fight with Medgar's 
1223 death. This was just even more 
1224 important that we demonstrate that we 
1225 
were not intimidated by the fact that 
51 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1226 he was killed. 
1227 Actually, his brother took over the 
1228 position of field director for the 
1229 State of Mississippi and he's still 
1230 there in Mississippi. He eventually 
1231 01:56:57 became Mayor of Philadelphia I 
1232 believe it was, Charles. This is the 
1233 kind of thing the NAACP was forced to 
1234 do in order to make sure its 
1235 constituents had examples of our 
1236 01:57:14 continuing the work of the 
1237 association one way or the other. 
1238 INTERVIEWER: What was Medgar Evers 
1239 like? You surely knew him. 
1240 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes, I worked with 
1241 Medgar. I was sent to Mississippi in 
1242 the ' 60s to interview farmers who had 
1243 been denied credit, who were 
1244 subjected to economic reprisals 
1245 because of their NAACP activities, 
1246 01:57:41 continuing to go to the polls to 
1247 register and vote. 
1248 Medgar and I, as a field director, he 
1249 would drive to the various places 
1250 because that's the best way to get 
52 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1251 there. We went into the Delta area 
1252 to interview the farmers so I could 
1253 take these reports back to New York 
1254 to see how we could help them to 
1255 survive the winter. Being denied 
1256 01:58:08 credit over the winter season, it 
1257 meant they had no means of getting 
1258 food because that was the tradition. 
1259 You get credit for the next four 
1260 months, and then when the spring came 
1261 01:58:20 you were able to start planting and 
1262 you would be able to start paying the 
1263 bills again. All of that credit was 
1264 cut off. 
1265 We traveled. I guess we spent at 
1266 that point about two weeks doing 
1267 this. One particularly difficult 
1268 time when our farmers were being 
1269 economic reprisals, we had had two 
1270 branch presidents who had been killed 
1271 01:58:52 just before this particular time. It 
1272 was difficult to believe that these 
1273 people would continue to carry on 
1274 like this because the situation was 
1275 
so oppressive in Mississippi. We 
53 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1276 were driving one night and I had 
1277 taken off my shoes and felt something 
1278 on the floor which was cold. I said 
1279 to Medgar, "What is this? Maybe I 
1280 can move it." He said, "Well, that's 
1281 01:59:22 my shotgun you have your feet on." 
1282 Of course my feet flew up. But this 
1283 is just to give you an idea of the 
1284 sense of the environment. 
1285 We would drive each night from 
1286 01:59:35 wherever we went, Yazoo or whatever 
1287 town, into which we'd gone at night 
1288 again--not to further endanger the 
1289 farmers and the people who were being 
1290 subjected to these reprisals--and 
1291 drive back to Mound Bayou, which is a 
1292 black town in that area, in which 
1293 there was a motel. We would go back 
1294 to stay at that motel and then start 
1295 out the next day, planning to arrive 
1296 02:00:03 in sort of the evening to visit the 
1297 farmers. This is the way in which 
1298 you had to function in those days out 
1299 of Jackson where you walked around in

the daytime and did your interviews.

MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, I really met 
them at first at a meeting. Ms. 
Bates would plan to have them gather 
not necessarily an NAACP meeting as 
such, but just to meet with them, to 
talk with them, and I would say to 
inspire them and to sort of inject 
discipline. To keep them together in 
other words. They were individual 
personalities. I did not get to know 
55 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1326 them well. I only knew them as a 
1327 group in the course of the meetings 
1328 because they were carefully tended in 
1329 the sense of for their own security. 
1330 This was year before the Central High 
1331 01:00:59 School began, the actual process of 
1332 integration. I forget the year, but 
1333 it was '55 or '56. Then they 
1334 actually entered the next year in the 
1335 fall. 
1336 01:01:18 The thing that impressed me was the 
1337 quiet determination of Ernest Green-- 
1338 I remembered him--who later became a 
1339 member of the NAACP Board of 
1340 Directors. Another one whom I 
1341 remember is Minnie Jean Brown, who 
1342 had a special assertive personality. 
1343 INTERVIEWER: Yes, she did. 
1344 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Some of them were 
1345 quiet. Others, they were sort of 
1346 01:01:45 followers in this sense. I'm sure 
1347 they had their own individual 
1348 personalities outside of the group, 
1349 but those are the ones I remember 
1350 
most particularly as being responsive 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 5 6 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1351 and actively ready to go forward with 
1352 the process of going to school. 
1353 The others, I wouldn't say they were 
1354 followers, I would just say they were 
1355 engaged in a quieter fashion. They 
1356 01:02:20 were less vociferous or less active 
1357 in the process, except that they 
1358 wanted to finish their schooling. 
1359 They all had that.

1365 Bernice Robinson. They're cousins I 
1366 believe. 
1367 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I met them, but I 
1368 didn't really know them, except by 
1369 reputation that they were very active 
1370 and engaged. But I really didn't 
1371 01:02:59 know them. 
1372 INTERVIEWER: What about Ella Baker, 
1373 who worked at the NAACP? 
1374 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. After she 
1375 worked for the NAACP is when I met

1376 her because she was a very forceful 
1377 personality. She became focused on 
1378 our youth if you recall and actually 
1379 was involved in the founding of the 
1380 Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
1381 01:03:22 Committee. She worked in our 
1382 Department of Branches before I came 
1383 on board to the NAACP. She spent 
1384 considerable time traveling around 
1385 the country organizing branches, 
1386 01:03:33 eliciting memberships, developing 
1387 membership campaigns, and instructing 
1388 our branches how to do that. She was 
1389 a very forceful woman. I was always 
1390 impressed by her determination and 
1391 her aggressiveness. 
1392 At the time when I first started to 
1393 work for the NAACP, you didn't have 
1394 that many women who were working in 
1395 levels up beyond the support levels 
1396 01:04:06 in the work arena, period--in other 
1397 organizations as well. Most of the 
1398 females were assistants or 
1399 secretaries or that type of thing in 
1400 the NAACP. For example, Lucille

secretary, she worked her way to 
become membership secretary it was 
called then of the NAACP. Bobbie 
Branch came in as a clerk wound up as 
office manager. Obviously, in NAACP 
in the legal department, there were 
always one or two females. Then when 
I came on board, one of the few 
female executives was June Shagaloff, 
who was a field director in 
education, who traveled and worked 
providing information and support for 
the legal department and our legal 
programs. 
INTERVIEWER: Not a woman, but Jack 
Greenberg. What do you remember 
about Jack Greenberg? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, he was a young 
lawyer. He was on board about a year 
before I came on. I got to know him 
quite well. Very active. We were 
contemporaries in terms of age also. 
We were about the same age. He 
1425 
worked well with Thurgood Marshall.

1426 I believe they were called either 
1427 associate or assistant counsels 
1428 during that period, the young lawyers 
1429 who were brought in. 
1430 He was focusing a lot on the 
1431 01:05:48 education cases. That was one of the 
1432 things that Jack focused on during 
1433 the period when they were putting 
1434 together cases in the various 
1435 commun!ties--about six or eight 
1436 01:06:00 communities primarily in the south or 
1437 as far west as Kansas, which 
1438 eventually became the group of cases 
1439 led by Brown to go up through the 
1440 process on to the Supreme Court. 
1441 INTERVIEWER: What about Robert 
1442 Carter? What do you remember of him 
1443 in those days? 
1444 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Yes. Well, Bob was 
1445 the associate I guess. He was a 
1446 01:06:27 second attorney to Thurgood, who was 
1447 still NAACP counsel at this point 
1448 when I came on board and remained so 
1449 for the next few years. Bob was the 
1450 
quieter one, but he also was the one 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 60

Line# Timecode Quote 
1451 who reached out in the communities 
1452 and spent a lot of time and effort 
1453 putting together the South Carolina 
1454 cases, for example. He eventually 
1455 pled in a couple of instances during 
1456 01:07:05 those trials before the Supreme 
1457 Court. 
1458 He has as wonderful time. He was 
1459 meticulous and concerned about 
1460 amassing the information in an 
1461 01:07:18 orderly way. He spent a lot of times 
1462 questioning and really you got the 
1463 feeling that he was being too 
1464 meticulously difficult, but it wasn't 
1465 at all. He had this commitment to 
1466 make sure that nothing was left 
1467 unturned and no I was undotted. As a 
1468 result, it became sort of laborious 
1469 sometimes, the work for the people 
1470 that were working for him; that is, 
1471 01:07:47 the assistants and the researchers. 
1472 In the final analysis it was what had 
1473 to be done. It was not easy, but he 
1474 was willing to put himself into the 
1475 task of getting this part of the work

1476 done. 
1477 INTERVIEWER: Do you want to stop

1480 MALE VOICE: Yeah, I can hear it.

1482 MALE VOICE: Cameras rolling. Ready? 
1483 INTERVIEWER: A moment ago, you 
1484 mentioned that when you began working 
1485 here at the NAACP the employment sort 
1486 01:08:23 of paralleled what we saw in the 
1487 larger society. That is, women in 
1488 clerical roles and men in the 
1489 executive roles. Over time I guess 
1490 that's changed, but it also strikes 
1491 me that it contrasts with a different 
1492 picture in the branch system. In the 
1493 branch system, women are presidents. 
1494 Women do serve in roles that maybe 
1495 they weren't expected to serve in. 
1496 01:08:45 How has the situation changed over 
1497 time? 
1498 MS. ROXBOROUGH: You mean in terms of 
1499 the--

1501 in the NAACP. 
1502 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, actually when 
1503 you think about women's contributions 
1504 to the NAACP, without the women we 
1505 wouldn't have an NAACP. The person 
1506 01:09:03 who was responsible for generating 
1507 the organizing meeting was a woman. 
1508 Of course, ever since then we've had 
1509 women in key roles--not in the 
1510 majority, but in the very key roles 
1511 01:09:19 which were responsible for the 
1512 evolution of the NAACP. 
1513 I think in terms of people like Daisy 
1514 Lampkin, who was a member of our 
1515 national board from Pittsburgh; she 
1516 traveled around the country garnering 
1517 memberships and helping to organize 
1518 branches. That was back in the '30s 
1519 and '40s before it became fashionable 
1520 or popular for women to travel. You 
1521 01:09:52 have women who subsequently held 
1522 positions in the NAACP nationally as 
1523 program directors and as leaders of 
1524 various divisions. For example, 
1525 Althea Simmons actually succeeded

Washington Bureau. We had Constance 
Baker Motley in the legal department 
who eventually moved up to the 
leadership role in the NAACP Legal 
Defense Fund subsequently. 
Women had no defined place in the 
organization and Ms. Frances Hooks, 
the wife of Benjamin Hooks, founded 
when WIN, Women in the NAACP, which 
gave them a structure in which to 
function and reach out and do the 
things in the NAACP that they had 
been doing, but in an organized and 
recognizable fashion. You wound up 
having Margaret Bush Wilson become 
the second female to be Chairman of 
the Board of the NAACP. Then the 
vice chair has developed Roslyn 
Brock, who has succeeded you as 
chair. 
As a matter of fact, I don't know if 
you know this in your research of the 
NAACP, but the 19 march in New York 
here in protest to lynching, the 
64 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1551 silent march, the research in 
1552 Arkansas of the lynchings and then on 
1553 to Georgia was done by a female. She 
1554 brought the report back for Dr. 
1555 Dubois, who was involved at that 
1556 01:11:52 point in terms of amassing the 
1557 information, which was the basis on 
1558 which that march was constructed and 
1559 held as a result of that report she 
1560 brought back in 1918. The march 
1561 01:12:10 subsequently was held in 1919 after 
1562 the information on the lynching and 
1563 the murders that she had investigated 
1564 was submitted really through our 
1565 Washington Bureau to the federal 
1566 government. It was felt that nothing 
1567 would be done, so this march evolved. 
1568 Of course Dr. Du Bois was given the 
1569 greater publicity for having been the 
1570 leader. Actually, the responsibility 
1571 01:12:40 of putting that together and causing 
1572 it to happen was the report done by a 
1573 female.

before my time. 
INTERVIEWER: I mean do you ever run 
into him? You both live in New York. 
I know it's a big city. 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: I met him and had 
written him for a copy of one of his 
documents, one of his papers. He 
wrote back saying he'd be delighted 
to send it, to send $5. I sent the 
$5 and got the paper. He was 
interesting I gather from those who 
knew him in our office. They would 
relate stories about Dr. Du Bois and 
how acerbic he could be. 
INTERVIEWER: Can you share a story? 
MS. ROXBOROUGH: Well, I don't 
remember them well enough to tell, so 
I won't undertake to do that and 
mislead the history. 
INTERVIEWER: What would you like the 
public to know about the work you've 
done here at the NAACP?

never thought about the public

1601 knowing much about what I do. My 
1602 concern as far as my being a part of

1605 leaders and that's my satisfaction.

1611 here that you've done here that you 
1612 are proud of among other things. 
1613 Among all the things you've done 
1614 here, there must be things that stand 
1615 out, something that you're happy that

1617 MS. ROXBOROUGH: I'd have to give 
1618 some thought to that. I can't... I've 
1619 had to do a lot of different things 
1620 over the years. I wound up getting 
1621 into that position where it was felt 
1622 01:14:36 that I was flexible and I could fit 
1623 into a lot of different places doing 
1624 a lot of different jobs. 
1625 The reason I'm still probably at the

full-time person until 1997--was 
every five years I moved into a 
different department or different 
job. I have held, let's see, 
probably about 8 or 10 jobs in almost 
every department in the association 
except its accounting department. I 
can't count. 
The satisfaction I got was learning 
how the NAACP functions and how I 
could make it more effectively 
function in that particular area. 
For example, I went from the branch 
department as an assistant to Gloster 
Current and a field secretary at 
large. Now that was my baptism. If 
you traveled in the early '50s, and 
as a female, a young, unattached--! 
wasn't married then female--it was 
quite an experience. First, you had 
to be sure in the cities where you 
went and the meetings and whatever, 
that you were properly on your guard 
in terms of the male-female 
68 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1651 interaction. Then you had to be 
1652 concerned about the branch president 
1653 who was an authority, but you were a 
1654 young female. You had that as a 
1655 thing, traveling in those days. It's 
1656 01:16:06 no issue in later years, but it was 
1657 unusual apparently for young, 
1658 unattached women to travel into the 
1659 kinds of byways I traveled. 
1660 That was an education. I thank the 
1661 01:16:21 NAACP for educating me, giving me the 
1662 experience of being educated. Each 
1663 time you had to be careful. You had 
1664 to learn diplomacy. You had to learn 
1665 self-protection, and you had to do 
1666 your job. Now all of that was 
1667 combined in the process when I 
1668 started work for the NAACP. I won't 
1669 go into all the departments, but I've 
1670 worked in virtually every department. 
1671 01:16:46 For me, it was always a good female 
1672 when they said to me, "Well, you've 
1673 done the basic organizing in the 
1674 membership department. We need you 
1675 
as an executive assistant to the 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 69 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1676 executive secretary. We would like 
1677 to get you to move into the executive 
1678 department. So I did. I was 
1679 director of operations at one point, 
1680 director of programs, and I wound up 
1681 01:17:20 being development director. 
1682 With the education I got at the NAACP 
1683 and the knowledge, I could use that 
1684 for marketing. Then I of course 
1685 wound up going to school taking 
1686 01:17:35 courses so that I would know the 
1687 technical side of fundraising. Then 
1688 you had to learn how to respect 
1689 confidences. I've learned an awful 
1690 lot about the leaders of the 
1691 association, the executive directors 
1692 primarily; and what makes them tick 
1693 and how they do this, that, and the 
1694 other, or what they shouldn't do, 
1695 what they did do, and shouldn't 
1696 01:17:59 happen, whatever. It was a part of 
1697 the education in terms of 
1698 understanding what the NAACP needed 
1699 and what they needed is leaders. 
1700 It's hard for me to say to you I'm 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 7 0 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1701 most proud of this or that or the 
1702 other. There's probably something I 
1703 am most proud of. But I guess I'm 
1704 proud that we were able to keep the 
1705 parents inspired in Hoxie, to keep 
1706 01:18:25 the children, walking the children to 
1707 school every day, and getting them. 
1708 That school board voluntarily 
1709 desegregated its schools, but the 
1710 parents needed support and help. I 
1711 01:18:37 got a sense of satisfaction of 
1712 walking with these children, holding 
1713 their hands, going to school with 
1714 them. Then they are persevering so 
1715 that they wound up not being forced 
1716 out of the school. 
1717 It's hard for me to pick an item like 
1718 an accomplishment. I don't know what 
1719 accomplishment I might have achieved 
1720 that would be worth talking about in 
1721 01:18:59 the sense of an event. It would be 
1722 cumulative the fact that I've been 
1723 able to serve. I'm not answering 
1724 your question, I know. 
1725 INTERVIEWER: It's okay. Let me ask

1726 one more. In Hoxie and in other 
1727 places where you went traveling for 
1728 the NAACP, were there times where you 
1729 felt in fear of your life? 
1730 MS. ROXBOROUGH: Afterwards, yes. A 
1731 01:19:20 funny thing about it is when you're 
1732 in danger--like Medgar and I were 
1733 traveling around and I didn't realize 
1734 I had my feet on the shotgun there-- 
1735 and being intimidated and going 
1736 01:19:32 across cotton fields and other fields 
1737 at night to get to a local meeting 
1738 which was being held, and the fact 
1739 that there were police patrolling in 
1740 the Delta area, my reaction of fear 
1741 has come after I've gotten through 
1742 it. Because you don't have time to 
1743 be afraid. I have found that after I 
1744 said you're stupid. How could you 
1745 get into such as situation out in the 
1746 01:20:03 middle of nowhere and nobody on whom 
1747 to call. But the fear comes as far 
1748 as I can recall after you've gotten 
1749 out of that particular physical 
1750 
situation. 
It does come, but later.

1751 I think if you're pushed to do 
1752 something or have to do it, you're 
1753 more focused on "How can I get this 
1754 done?" That's just been my 
1755 experience. 
1756 01:20:30 My parents always had said to me 
1757 you're an idiot if you get afraid 
1758 while you're doing something because 
1759 you're becoming your own worst enemy, 
1760 and you act without logic or reason. 
1761 01:20:43 You don't want to do that. You want 
1762 to plan and try to do what is the 
1763 most appropriate to safeguard 
1764 yourself and reach that goal, 
1765 whatever it is. Some things I look 
1766 at now. As I said, some of the 
1767 travels in the '50s, say I spent a 
1768 summer in Arkansas traveling to the 
1769 various branches--El Dorado, Arkansas 
1770 and Cotton Plant, Arkansas, I never 
1771 01:21:15 heard of it until I went there--and 
1772 places where the white citizens in 
1773 the town, the power structure, the 
1774 worst thing that they could learn was 
1775 that a visitor for the NAACP branch 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY & CULTURE 7 3 
Civil Rights History Project 
Line# Timecode Quote 
1776 from New York was coming in to stir 
1777 up trouble. That was the kind of 
1778 environment in which I worked, so 
1779 many instances, during that five-year 
1780 period that I served as a field 
1781 01:21:53 secretary. 
1782 I guess I must've worked in about 40 
1783 states. Some of them, the western 
1784 north, were not as intimidating as 
1785 the south, but I traveled frequently 
1786 01:22:06 in Mississippi, also in Georgia, also 
1787 Alabama. Those states were where the 
1788 tensions were greatest and the people 
1789 were most fearful, including the 
1790 local units were exceedingly careful. 
1791 That was a learning experience for me 
1792 about people and how you could 
1793 survive and accommodate yourself to 
1794 staying in their homes and feeling 
1795 that you were bringing them danger, 
1796 01:22:40 the fact that I was there sleeping in 
1797 their room. There was nothing secret 
1798 eventually. The town knows what the 
1799 folks are doing. 
1800 Those experiences have I think made

1802 me understand that people are

1806 01:23:17 think the NAACP has had that kind of 
1807 an effect in communities where it has 
1808 functioned as an entity. People have 
1809 felt that they could get help going 
1810 to the NAACP, that there would be 
1811 01:23:33 something done in their behalf. I 
1812 think they believed that. I believe 
1813 in large measure they still do. We, 
1814 on the other hand, should be 
1815 accountable and responsible and our 
1816 leadership should be effective in the 
1817 sense that they should be able to 
1818 reach out to people and inspire their 
1819 confidence about what they do as an 
1820 example. Any help you can give to 
1821 01:24:01 make that happen should be given. I 
1822 still haven't answered your question, 
1823 have I?
