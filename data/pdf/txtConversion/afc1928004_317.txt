"OUR BOYS." 
An American Patriotic and liumorous Song, wiitien. and 
Sung by .Toms NASH. 
[Copyrighted 1E75, byW. PoAD & CO. Music Pub., 547 B'way, N. Y. 
Uncle Sam he was once at a 
festive affaii, 
And they called upon Sam for a 
strain`; 
So he put out his weed and toss'd off his glass, 
And then he commenced this refrain : 
I'll sing of " Our Boys" who have made a 
great name 
Their is Captain Bogardus, said he, 
I t 
In Europe he showed them how well we could shoot. 
His equal you will seldom see. 
CHORUS. 
He is one of " Our Boys," he is; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
If he is honest and trite; we give him his due; 
We are prou'd of' " Our Boys," HUtiah! 
We have got a 
verY'good'Rifle Team; 
They cross'd the wide ocean, you knoicr 
1 
And defeated the Dollymount marksmen with ease, 
And won all the prizes, that's so! 
They've defeated, sines than, the Canadian Team, 
And althmigh they dOn't make a 
great noise, 
They could easily beat any marksmen on earth— 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
They belong to " Our Boys," they do, So.

When Old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair, 
It was one of " Our Boys ,"—Jim Bennett, who said— 
For the Doctor I'll now have a 
care. 
It was one of " Our Boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found; 
All honor to Stanley! may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
He is one of " Our Boys," Zzo. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame, 
Is one we must never forget; 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished the world you may bet! 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring, as we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty good man. 
Camas. 
He was chief of " Our Boys," he was ; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
He was honest and true, so give him his due; 
We aro proud of " Our Boys," we arQ.

OUR BOYS."

Imsn VrRAION. 
Sung by JOLLY NASH• 
You may talk of your Poys ; and your heroes of old, 
By the powers, Old Ireland can boast 
A 
long list of Heroes, of Erin the pride; 
We number " Our Boys" by the host. 
Saint Patrick, the first on the list I 
shall place; 
Then I'll name quite a 
lot great and small, 
From Brian Born and the great Don aghue. 
To O'Connell, the pride of them all. 
CHORUS. 
He was one of " Our Boys," he was! 
And we are proud of such Boys, we are 
He was honest and true, so give him his due; 
He was one of " Our Bo5s," Hurrah! 
To speak of the year Ninety- Eight, we don't fear, 
We had many many brave boys, then, I 
vow! 
And in Forty-Eight, too, we had heroes a 
few; 
With pride we remember them now. 
Robert Emmet. McManus, O'Brien, O'Niel, 
O'Donovan Rossa O'Moore, 
O'Connor and Martin, and one more I'll name— 
John Mitchell! whose 1°,8 we deplore. 
He was one of 
Our Boys," Sze. 
Sam Lover and Moore were " Our Boys." to be sure, 
They were Irish. there's divil a 
doubt ; 
Your soldiers are Irish wherever they show, 
They soon put the foeman to rout. 
In this land of the free, where we happen to be, 
We are modest and don't make a 
noise; 
But your Generals and Statesmen, and all solid men, 
Belong to our own Irish Boys. 
Caonns. 
They belong to " Our Boys," they do, 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
If they are honest and true, it's love them we do 
We are proud of " Our Boys," Hurrah!

Oh, Bob! Wha't will Peiiple Say? 
As sung by JOLLY Newt. 
Last Easter Monday, for a 
spree I 
went to Central Park, 
And there a 
petty girl did see dressed quite up to the mark 
She took my hat from off my'head and. away with it she ran ; 
I 
thought, well, that's quite good enough. so! I 
chase& her 
like a 
man. 
DIALOGUE. —I 
chhsed her round the treed, at last I 
caught 
her, put my arms around her waist, and was just going to 
give her a 
chased embrace, when she exclaimed— 
CHO/M13. 
O1, Bob' ! don't Bob! mind what you're about, 
If you come any closer Bob, I 
certainly shalt shout, oh! 
Oh, Bob! don't Bob! let me go, I 
pray. 
If any one should see us Bob, oh what would peop e 
say? 
I 
said you seem to know my name, say t 
she I

You used to kncrvi me ' very well and call me darling Sue;

Oh, Bob! don Bob! &c. 
We sat beneath a 
shady tree, I 
talked of love and bliss, 
I 
looked at her she smiled on me, I 
longed to steal a 
kiss; 
She said, oh, Bob! I 
love you ranoh, but with you I 
intis'nt 
stay. 
For I 
am already married, and what would my husband say. 
YID 
SPow.--Judge of my ‘horror and dismay. I 
tore my 
hair and went mad, and in my fury I 
ex-claimed, thus am I 
revenged; I 
seized ...913°a a 
.vfalking stick, I 
rushed upon 
her, but as she ran away, she exclLmed— 
.,, 
Oh, Bob!, don't Bob! &c. 
My Susan was another's, , she had treated me unkind, 
But when she saw how I 
was grieved, it prayed upon ia.er 
mind; 
And in the middle of the night she started up in bed, 
And .ri.zed her husband with affright, and this is what she 
said—

FAIR PLAY. 
As sung by JOLLY Nam. 
To do as you would be done by, is good advice, you'll own. 
Do everybody that you can, is a 
maxim better known. 
I 
do not envy other men live and let live, I 
say, 
The world is wide enough for all, if all could have fair play, 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't care a 
pin what the world may say, 
I'm always rough and ready, and I 
like fair play. 
Give a 
man a 
fair chance, and stand out of the way, 
Fair play's a 
jewel!, and I 
like fair play. 
How often in our law courts we see justice really blind, 
And many a 
poor man sent to jail when a 
rich man's only 
fined. 
Their faults, perhaps, may be the same, but one the fine 
can pay. 
The other can't, so goes to jail, I 
don't call that fair play. 
I 
don't care a 
pin, &o. 
'Twixt masters and their workingmen. good feeling we 
should like; 
Good masters make good workmen, ' tis bad ones cause a 
strike; 
And if they only give the men a 
little higher pay 
When higher profits they obtain. I 
should call that fair play. 
I 
don't care a 
pin, &a. 
To get fair play for one and all then let us all combine 
And now I 
think I'll make an end of this long song of 
mine; 
So join me in the chorus now before I 
go away, 
And let your motto always be, for one and all fair play. 
I 
don't care a 
pin, &o.. 
LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
My wife and I 
live all alone 
In a 
neat little cot we call our own; 
She loves gin and I 
love rum, 
I 
tell you what we have lots of fun. 
CHORUS. 
Ha, ha, ha! you and me, 
Little brown jug don't I 
love thee. 
"'Pis :mu that makes me wear old clothes, 
'Tis you that makes my friends my foes. 
.ere she is beneath my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 
Ha, ha, ha! fre. 
When I 
go toiling to my farm, 
I 
take little brown jug under my arm. 
I 
put her under a 
shady tree, 
Little brown jug don't I 
love thee. 
Ha, ha, ha! &a, 
I'd a 
cow which gave such milk, 
I'd clothe her in the finest silk; 
Id feed her on the sweetest hay, 
And I'd milk her forty times a 
day. 
Ha, ha, ha.! &a. 
ne rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violet's blue, and so are you ; 
And yet I 
guess before I 
stop, 
I'd better take another drop. 
Ha, ha, ha! &e.

The Merry Little Fat Grey Woman. 
Sung with great success in England and America, 
By JOLLY Ne.sst. 
A 
merry little woman with a 
funny little eye, 
Fe, he, he, he, he, ha! 
A 
very merry fattish man was sitting very nigh ; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
And got a 
little nearer, just to have a 
little chat, 
When both began a 
laughing and they never knew what at. 
Ha, ha, ha. ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he, he! 
A 
funny little dumpling shape the lady was in make, 
And he a 
double dumpling seem'd, which did her fancy take 
And with a 
chuckle, said at last, I'm thinking Sir, that we— 
Are very like each other in our figure, he, he, he! 
He, he, he, he, he, he, he! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my merry little fatty. fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny little eye, ha, ha, ha, ha, with a 
funny 
little eye, he, he, he. 
They really shook with laughing, and their laughing shook 
He, he, he, he, he ! [the floor. 
And striving to restrain themselves, it made them laugh 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! [the more; 
The glasses jingled, bottles clink'd, at which the company 
Began to mingle in the laugh, and never was such glee; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he, ! 
He always took a 
pinch of snuff, whenever pleased or vex'd 
And taking out his box for one, it somehow gave prrtext 
For titt'ring anew, and his fair neighbor with a 
cry 
Of joy, exclainfd, do you take snuff, how funny, so do L 
He, he, he, he, he, he, he! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
Oh! my merry, &a 
This pleasant little lady he escorted home that night, 
He, he, he, he, he, ha! 
And on the next he took her to the Op'ra, with delight; 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! 
But when the dancers did appear she whisper'd as they sat, 
What fairy forms and figuring, we should not do for that! 
Ha, ha;, ha, ha ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he, he! 
Why, No, said he, but we should do, I 
think, for man and 
wife— 
I've thought the same, she laughing said, I 
have upon my 
life ! 
And so this merry dame and he, (my story to condense,) 
Got wedded soon, at which they've been a 
laughing ever 
since. 
He, he, he, he, he, he, he! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! 
Spommr —And they've got a 
funny little baby, with a 
funny little eye—just like its funny little Mama's, and 
When its funny little Papa looks at it, he exclaims-
Cuoaus, 
Oh! my merry little fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny, funny, funny, funny, funny little eye, 
With a 
funny little eye, ha, ha, ha, ha, with a 
funny 
little eye, he, he, he!

-• BOMB people are born disconten.ed I _think,

They're sure to find fault with the most trivial things-
And they alwa, s

But its best to be cheerful and ha py like me, 
And laugh all your troubles away. 
CHORUS. 
It's best to be cheerful and happy like me, 
-,It's best to be merry and gay, 
It's best to take things just tbe same as they come, 
-And laugh all your troubles away. 
Some grumble because things are not to their minds, 
And others at what they have got, 
Apple grumble at trouble they've brought on themselves, 
..And.others at no matter what; 
,They're,always in trouble [for trouble they make, 
And they meet trouble more than half way,

'JOHN DOBBS. 
Sung with great success by JOLLY Nam. 
JOHN DOBBS was tickled when a 
child, 
By a 
nurse who drove him almost wild, 
And Johnny laugh'd he, he, he, 
And shook his little sides with glee; 
lie laughed so long, he laughed so loud. 
The neighbors gathered in a 
crowd, 
They turned poor Johnny upside down, 
They poured cold water on his crown. 
They bit his fingers, pinched his ear, 
And tho' it may seem very queer; 
He still laughed on, and some folks say, 
He'll laugh until his dying day. 
Now John grew up a 
fine young boy, 
His father's hope, his mother's joy, 
His smile was bland, his laugh was clear, 
His mouth it stretched from ear to ear; 
His nose turned up, his hair was brown, 
And John was known throughout the town, 
And if on him you turned your chaff, 
He quite convuls'd you with his laugh; 
A 
parson once the task essard, 
TO 
make him grave and did upbraid. 
But Johnny made a 
wry grimace, 
And sent the parson from the place. 
When John went courting, people say, 
lie went in such a 
funny way, 
He said, my dear, will you have me, 
And be my wife, he, he, he; 
The maid reply'd ho, ho, ho. 
Well, ,John, you, see I 
can't say no, 
And so they married very soon, 
And had a,happy,honey-innon, 
Jgbiatanghs at gary, EO Alley ,f,iay, 
And Mary tickles John all day, 
The more the , ickles John you see, 
The more he laughs he, he, he, 
And now this merry little lair, 
Have children ten, but they don't care 
The children laugh just like ,their ;dad, 
They drove their poor old granny inad; 
And John he gave a, loud guffaw. 
;As he parted with his mother-in-law, 
For they laughed so much she could'nt 
But went to distant parts away, 
And now this happyfamily, 
'Spend all,their,timein ,merry glee, 
And when he dks,some epec-pie,doubt, 
If John will even then give out.

COTTON PODS. 
As sung by the LA 
VEEDE Children. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell the village Belle--
The idol of my lay; 
And when evening casts its shades, 
0! what a 
happy Southern sod, 
We wandered forth in hand and hand, 
To pick the cotton pods. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
first saw Nell, the village Belle, 
The idyl of my lay. 
Cuonus. 
Cotton pods, snow white, 
Beaming in starlight! 
Emblem, sweet Nellie, of my love for you. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I 
first gave you the heart that was true. 
Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same ; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again. 
Boy.--0 ! 
here you are, my own sweet love, 
0! come and sit down by my side, 
And answer, darling quickly, do! 
And say you will be my bride. 
Beth.—I 
see the love light in your eyes, 
Of when we first did meet; 
And now we are happy with our joys, 
In love and kisses sweet.

We'd not set sail six weeks or more, 
When lor, the winds began to blow; 
For Mary Anne my heart felt sore, 
I 
wished myself at home with her in Pimlico, 
The sea behaved uncommonly rough, 
To the gallant " Timbuctoo," 
And gave her a 
shock that sent her on a 
rock, 
All amongst the Chunkumchoo, 
'Mongst the horrid Chunkumchoo.

They made me captive, dressed me up 
In nothing but top boots, feathers and paint, 
You would not be surprised to hear,

Their interesting Queen proposed 
Her husband I 
should be, 
But as she'd nine, I 
begged to decline 
Her making the tenth of me, 
Very kind, but not for me.

Contrived to reach dear America's shore, 
Rushed off to find my Mary Anne. 
I 
soon beheld the one I 
loved, 
Also her children three; 
And her husband, oh lor I 
showed me the door, 
Said " there was no room for me," 
He " regretted" he'd no room for me.

CHORUS. 
Since Mary Ann learned how to dance, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
She's out all night 'till broad. daylight, 
A 
dancing the Tra-la-la-loo! 
On every moonlight pic-nic sure my daughter can be found, 
And when I 
bid her stay at home she says, `• Go feel around ;" 
And on starlight excursions, where the band plays Flewy-
come-fiew, 
'Tis there I'll find my Mary Ann a 
skipping the Tra-la-la-loo! 
Since Mary Ann, &c. 
Bad luck to moonlight pic-
nics, they have ruined Mary Ann, 
Since first she learned to pivot with young Terry and his 
gang; 
But if I 
find her there again I'll beat her black and blue— 
She's gone to the divll intirely, since she learned the 
Tra-la-la-loo 1 
Since Mary Ann, &c. 
GLITTER. • 
As sung by Miss ELLA IVEsNE.n. 
They're not all gems that glitter, no! 
Attractive though they seem, 
For tinsel has a 
spurious glow, 
A 
bright but transient gleam; 
The thoughtless oft aro caught by this, 
And most men may be sold; 
Be careful that you don't get dross, 
Instead of shining gold. 
CHORUS, 
Glitter and glare may make people stare, 
But howe'er dazzling bright it may be. 
Glitter and gloss are nothing but dross; 
Pure gold, pure gold, the metal for me. 
Be ye as chaste, as pure as snow, 
You'll not escape the touch 
Of slander's tongue—be guarded—and 
Itv-'11 not harm you much. 
Be upright, just, and always fair, 
Each debt of Iindneas pay; 
Let deeds, not words, reflect your worth, 
And bear the light of day. 
Glitter and glare, itcl. 
Pure gold with some is very scarce, 
But wealth's a 
heeting joy ; 
The wealthy, like the poor, oft have 
Their share of life's alloy. 
Let each look round, and if he can, 
Extend a 
helping hand; 
The peasant thus may vie the peer— 
"le richest in the land. 
Glitter and glare,

HOME RULE. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. Composed by MARY 
LENNS11,, 
Copyright, 1875, by JOHN ROACH. 
IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of..Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
in England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this yew 
right, 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, &e. 
47 
There's one 'now in his grave wno struggled hard to gave, 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name and may Heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, AA 
• 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now, 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the hut8, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

Through eating pickled salmon 
Before I 
went to bed, 
A 
flight of wildest fancies 
Went booming thro' my head! 
The world seemed topsy turvy, 
And people of renown, 
Were doing the most outrageous things! 
When the world turned upside down! 
The Pope was dressed as Harlequin, 
And danced a 
Highland Fling; 
Queen Victoria came from England, 
A. comic song to sinr; 
Old Barnum acted Hamlet, 
And Booth was playing clown, 
And Bismark war an acrobat 
When the world turned upside down. 
Jay Gould he was a 
Quaker, 
And " bossed" a 
gpelling match; 
Vanderbilt had a 
railway scheme 
He could'nt somehow hatch; 
Mr. Tilton was an Emperor. 
And wore a 
gulden crown, 
And Beecher danced the can-can 
Vben the i
worl(:',,-nrned twide dove. 
Brigham Young was a 
batchelor 
Who wished a 
wife to win; 
John Gough opened a " Sample room," 
A_nd served out beer and gin; 
Old Tweed was at his Island home, 
Dressed in a 
suit of brown; 
Ben Butler had joined the Shakers 
When the world turned upside down. 
The shining Truth gleamed o'er the lanc14 
And Virtue—more or less ;—

Thought to vanity or dress;

Wives never wore a

And U. S. Grant said, " No Third Term, 
Or the States are upside down." 
Brooklyn had changed into a 
sort 
Of Paradise on earth ; 
For it had some trials, 
And one heard no ribald.

THE ROMAN FALL 
As sung by MISS ELIA W ESNE.B.. 
You've heard of the " Grecian Bend," 
And you know how the iadies appear; 
On the tips of their toes, with their high head shoes, 
It's amusing to watch them all. 
Without wishing to offend, 
I've invented a 
fashion, I'll swear— 
Will be followed out, too, as its something new, 
And I 
call it the " Roman Fall.' 
CIIORUS. 
For if ladies still intend 
To follow out the " Grecian Bend," 
Take notice, you men, all, 
The latest thing's the " Roman Fall l" 
Head back, the chest well out, 
A 
walk between a 
shuffle and a 
crawl; 
The long, the short, 5he lean, the stout, 
Must try the " Roman Fall !" 
Now you know as the ladies, of late, 
Have so very ridiculous grown; 
Made themselves such guys, to appear in the eyes 
Of the gentlemen, all in all. 
They will not be at all elate 
At the fashion we have of our own; 
For I 
quite intend to out-do the " Bend,' 
By the beautiful " Roman Fall !" 
For if ladies, &C. 
A 
girl with the " Grecian Bend," 
Has a 
terrible trial to endure ; 
She must walk on her toes, and perhaps her nose 
May come bump up against a 
wall. 
53 ' 
With the fashion that I 
recommend 
Our noses are safe I 
am sure; 
For you'll find instead, it's the back of the head 
Will be hurt by the " Roman Fall." 
For if ladies, iza. 
Now I 
hope what I've said to night, 
Will sink in your memories deep ; 
That you'll clearly see the necessity 
Of adopting it, one and all; 
'Twill serve the clear ladies right, 
And prove that we are not asleep, 
, 
If we boldly show there are none of us slow 
In producing the " Roman Fall !" 
For if ladies, Sm. 
SPOKEN. --When the ladies bend before us .it shows they 
are inclined to stoop to our superiority, and such a 
feast of 
humbleness invites us to fall to. 
And the "Raman Fair 
shows we are Beaux to the back-bone. 
And by extending 
our manly breasts, " Chestify" ourselves in receiving the 
little benten forms on our lordly protuberances, and pil-
lowing their heads on those ribs from whence they sprung. 
Yes, gentlemen, we must show the dear girls that we can 
adopt fashions as ridiculous as their own. 
But really, the 
ladies have become o 
forward of late, that it 
not surpri-
sing that we should be a 
little backward. A good figure 
is always admired, and a 
fall ti). the back I 
consider espe-
cially graceful. 
The ladies always admire a 
fall in the 
back. 
And without conceit, I 
think I 
may say I've got it 
But don't be envious, don't be envious, gentlemen ; only 
take my advice, and you'll be as fascinating as I 
ain. 
For if the ladies, ZGo.

They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
That no one with me can compare; 
You can tell by the style that I

If you meet me, wherever you are; 
The ladies all smile on me sweetly, 
A 
thing that I 
most dearly love; 
You can hear them remark as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove 
CHORUS. 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, he's handsome and winning, 
The dear little fellow I 
love ; 
The ladies all say as they met me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove I 
I 
am counted sweetest of waltzers, 
At boating they say I'm immense; 
I 
bet on the favorite horses, 
I 
am gifted with lots of good sense; 
I 
move in the bon- ton society, 
I'm counted a 
lucky young cove; 
Its a 
saying wherever I 
wander, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, dr.t. 
I 
go to the watering places, 
To live through the hot weather spell; 
Make love to the sweetest of faces, 
A 
pastime I 
like mighty well; 
My lot in this life is a 
nice one, 
In fact it has long been the case; 
I 
have really more fun than the next One. 
Don't you wish you could step in my place? 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, to.

By Killarney's lakes and fells, . 
Emerald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells. 
Mem'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all land; 
Beauty wanders every where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'd shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest • 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's spew, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

PULL DOWN THE BLIND. 
As sung by TONY PAsToL: 
DID you ever make love ?, If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing.and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say: 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind, 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
Ilow loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
'With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad; 
With laughing* and"chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney.on me. 
SPOKEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
.57 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
A.nd when we got home she was awfully gay, 
he saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," .and suited her one; 
She called me her rose- bud, her dick, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc.. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little w:fe. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with 
meek smile on her face shell exclaim: 
PERFEOTION.

STYLE OF TR 
DAY. 
As sung by JENNIE LINDSEY. 
rm a 
jolly young leader of fashion, 
A 
belle that's so festive and free; 
Of course you will say I 
am dashing, 
For nothing but style suits me; 
With young swells I 
often go driving. 
They call me so charming and gay, 
That I 
try to outdress all the others, 
.And bring out the style of the day. 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
laugh and I 
wink at the fellows, 
Who oft on their knees to me pray; 
But I 
think I 
will have to stay single, 
To bring out the style of the day. 
I 
have many rivals who try to 
Outshine my gay style so fine; 
But then I 
always can beat them, 
For my Pa he owns a 
gold mine; 
If I 
owe a 
V, X, or a 
50, 
And havn't got it to pay, 
I 
just send my bill to my parient, 
And he pays for the style of the day. 
Then I 
laugh, and I 
wink, &c.

Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgio order has 
been sent us called HIIMPTY DIIBIPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture-
book 
printed and colored, it is so bound that a 
prac-
tised-manirl -tor taking it up and flirtinft the leaves rapidly 
wer, can mak: t 
appear to be filled with copies of only one 
picture, or vriai blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
sue-
session of figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumb-
ed, appears to contain nothing but the portraits of Harlequin,

'Nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles.

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes cf Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Teranle. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and ruir resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in :ant attention to the end.

The New

A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. :Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
atcy that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h- bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining"how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod 
us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tonable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers. •

First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
tho units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chwiics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tice--; in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a 
work 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be unle to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white liver, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
