Madeleine Hall-Arber: Okay, so, what I need you to do is just introduce yourself, and that way I 
can make sure that the sound is up high enough. 
Bob Bowers: Okay. Hi my name is Bobby Bowers and I'm a tankerman down here on the 
waterfront. New Bedford waterfront. 
MHA: Terrific. I'll give you a little formal introduction. If s more for the purposes of the tape 
than anything. It’s March 8, 2017. This is an interview for the New Bedford Fishing Heritage 
Center funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of Congress. As part of this 
project we are interviewing shoreside workers in the New Bedford/Fairhaven fishing industry to 
record their stories, document their skills and knowledge and better understand their important 
role in the fishing industry. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent 
collection at the Library of Congress. I am Madeleine Hall-Arber and today I'm speaking with 
Bobby Bowers at Twin Piers, right? It’s, now it’s about noon. Ifs 12:15 actually, and you have 
given us permission to record this story. 
BB: Mmhmm. 
MHA: Oay, great. You can introduce yourself again... 
BB: Okay, Bobby Bowers, worked down here on the waterfront, on fuel barges. This year will be 
30 doing, just fueling up boats and whatever comes around, we fill it with fuel. 
MHA: 30 years?! I didn't realize that. And where you bom down here? 
BB: I was bom in Dartmouth, next town over. Right on the line. New Bedford/Dartmouth line. 
Eight miles from here. 
MHA: And when was that? 
BB: 1960. 
MHA: Okay, And I assume you grew up here. 
BB: Well I grew up down, basically I was down here most of my whole life. My father was a 
fisherman and I was always down here with him. When he was in, I was down here and then, I 
worked at Almas dock on a ferry back in '78. It was a ferry that used to mn. I worked there for 
the summer. Back to school. And then when I got out of school next year, I went fishing for 
about three or four years. I got out of that racket. I just ended up buying a skiff, a bull rake and a 
tongs, and that's what I did for four years. Called bull raked and tongs for four years straight and 
that business was going down hill because of the pollution going into the water and everything 
and it was, it wasn't worth going. Every time it would rain out and you couldn't go out for five 
days, so, that's when I just came down here and I got my tankerman and started working on the 
fuel barges down here, been here ever since. 
MHA: So, the tankerman. Can you explain a little more about what that is? 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

BB: Well, a tankerman is somebody that is licensed to pump fuel, run the barge around the 
harbor and, you know, knows what to do. Because, if you don't know what you're doing, you 
could be pumping fuel and not [unintelligible], and fuel’s coming out. You got to know how 
to... You got to know the boats, cause if you don't, you got serious problems. And big fines. So 
if s kind of like, when you do it a long time, you kind of know what boats you got to watch out 
for and ones that you can have no problem with it. But if s basically simple, but it can be, your 
heart can beat a lot, cause you don't know what's going to happen when, you're scared something 
happens, something lef s go, but so far, so good. I've nothing. Never had nothing big happen to 
me, so far. 
MHA: Good! So who gives that license or permit? 
BB: Well you go through, the Coast Guard gives you that. You have to go to the school for that. 
You do so much on there and they um...take a test. You go to Boston, you take a test, when you 
pass that you got it. It was good for like five, ten years, you wouldn't have to do nothing. Now all 
of a sudden, they make you do a physical every two years. Its, um...you got to renew eveiything 
and it's all money. Got to every two years it's a physical, they check your eyes, they check your 
reflexes, they check everything on you. Make sure you're sound for doing the job, you don't have 
no, any problems with you. You don't want to have a bad heart pumping fuel and the next thing 
you know, you have a heart attack and nobody's around, and the fuel's coming out! By the time.. 
So thaf s basically, they want to make sure that you're in tip top shape. You don't have nothing 
wrong with your eyesight, has to be good. You can't be colorblind. And if s all little stuff 
MHA: Why color blind? 
BB: Well I guess they figure the colorblind oufbecause if you're on the boat and colorblind, 
there's lights. A lot of boats they work at night around the harbor, they use lights. Red on one 
side and green on the other. One light on top of two white lights, and if you don't pick those 
lights out, there could be a boat coming this way, and could have a collision. 
MHA: Interesting 
BB: The lights at night, that's when you got to pay attention. You got to know your lights, your 
buoys, you're coming in at night or whatever, you got make sure, your red is on your right and 
your green in on your port, so you got to know your lights. That's how you see at night. 
Nowadays everything's with GPS, so ifs kind of like you can follow, the channel with the GPS, 
you know go right in but, a while back its was just all lights. You used to get in the harbor, 
whatever you could, follow the lights. That's how it went. 
[5:24] 
MHA: So the kind of things that could go wrong, that they train you to watch out for, like what? 
BB: Well you got to make sure you tie in, tie your barge right. Make sure ever3Thing is good, and 
um, tie everything right, because surges. Don't forget when you're filling, your pumping from 
one to another, you're going to go up and the boat along next to you is going to go down. You 
got to kind of keep an eye on everything. Because if you're going up and he's going down, your 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

lines are going to go slack. And you're going to have a big gap between there, in between your 
boat. And you don't want the hoses to get in there, and if somebody comes by with a big wake 
and starts, you got a big a surge, it'll pinch the hoses and things can happen. You want to keep 
everything, everything snug. You don't want everything loose and let it drift away cause you can, 
thafs when accidents happen. Lines could snap because of the slack. You just want to keep 
everything, keep your lines, just enough— not too tight, not too loose and you'll be all right. Just 
keep an eye on everything. If it starts lighting, thundering and lightning, you have to shut down 
and you can't, when you got a bad lightning storm you can't pump fuel because it'll um, anything 
can happen. A big time bomb, but so far I haven't seen that yet. I hope I never do. 
[Both laughing] 
MHA: And you mentioned that some boats are a little trickier than others. What kinds of.. 
BB; Well some of the old time boats were made with manifolds, that you, the pipe goes down on 
deck and it goes down, and if s a long pipe it goes in the engine with the manifold on it. And if s 
all, could be six, eight tanks and if s all manifold valves and you have to adjust all them while 
you’re filling it. There's not too many around no more like it. Yeah, there's only a few down 
here. The one's basically around here are pretty simple to fill up now. But the old type is, you're 
down in the engine filling them. You have six tanks and you're filling them all, and your nozzle 
up top is screwed in. That's how much back pressure there is and you got to, one guy up top and 
one guy down below. The other guy’s up top you got to have, bucket around the vents so in case 
anything happens. And thafs uh, that's probably, those are trickiest ones and you, thafs the ones 
that nobody wants to do because they, anything can happen. If the boat's laying over a little bit, 
that when stuff can happen. So you just got to pay attention on that. That's the scariest part, you 
know. You have to fill the boat even, while if s filling. You don't want to open everything up and 
all of a sudden the boat starts laying over to one side and you hear screaming, there's fuel coming 
out top. So if s basically, the boats made now are all simple. They're not the old style. Everything 
just put right in the pipe and let it go. 
MHA: So when you, can you explain a little more about what manifold is? 
BB: Manifold, okay, lef s just say like, ifs a long pipe you screw on your nozzle on and on the 
end them there's probably eight valves or ten or whatever, how many tanks you got. And then 
there's valves you open up to fill certain tanks. So you got eight tanks, you got eight valves and 
on all these tanks down there, they all have sight glasses. And you can watch them while they're 
filling. So you open the manifolds up and if one's starting to fill a little too fast, starting to lay 
over, you just choke the valve a little bit. You try to fill the boat even. Pretty simple, ifs like, like 
somebody who has a, I don't know the back of your house, on a spigot, the hose with two hoses 
going off it. Sometime you have two or three spigots you can run a garden hose off of Basically 
almost like that. And then that, each one goes to each tank, they're all lettered, so it will tell you 
which one is going to fill. Say it’s the port forward, you can slow the port forward down. It’s 
pretty simple once you get it all down. It's not that hard. Nothing to worry about. There's only 
like one down here. The rest of them are all gone. They're all, there's none around no more. The 
boats here are all simple; they're not, ifs not hard like it was back when I first started. There was 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

some down there that was scary. You had to watch out. 
[9:40] 
MHA: Those, were they steel boats? 
BB: All steel. Well, there was a lot of steel, but there were a lot of wooden ones. And the 
wooden ones they were, it was the same thing. It was a manifold, but the manifold stayed open, 
you'd fill it up and you did that buy sound. You'd stay up there and sometimes you'd be up there 
for an hour, two hours just sitting by there. You could tell by the sound. The sound, it makes a 
certain sound when it gets close and as it gets closer, you just slow the nozzle down. It makes a 
weird sound, and what its doing, it’s filling from underneath. It's not filling from the top so it 
gives a sound. And you tell when the sound starts disappearing, you just keep going back slow 
on the valve and all of sudden if 11 come up the pipe and it’s full. If you didn't fill them all the 
way back then, and the boat left, went out fishing, normal eight, nine, ten day trip, if he ran out, 
it was you that ah, didn't fill it all the way. So you made sure that when the boat got in, it was 
filled either to the mark or right to the top. So back then, the boats only held so much fuel. These 
here, now they hold plenty of fuel. They can go a long time without running out. But back then, 
the old type was fill it, sometimes you'd be five, ten degrees out. You'd be there, just standing by 
the pipe. You couldn't move! You didn't want to move, because you didn't know when it was 
going to come up. You had buckets under the vents in case anything let go. And you had 
everything there, you know, spill pad. But there was never, no nothing. It might, a little come 
out, not much at all. It never went into the water. There was never none of the spills in the water. 
A couple here or there but it was just something freaky that happened, that would happen back 
then, but them days are over with them boats. Those boats are all gone. Everything here now is 
steel and it’s simple. It's not, if s just two guys. You don't need three guys no more to fill a boat. 
If s just, basically simple now. Ifs nothing. 
MHA: So when you started out, you said you went fishing for a bit. 
BB: Yeah. 
MHA: Did you go with your father? 
BB: I went with my father in '77. My father in '77, a brand new steel dragger. And he just started 
to get into the steel draggers, because it was all the eastern rigs, the old types and he went on 
there. It was his first trip on there. His boat was brand new. And I went with him and he just 
couldn't believe how something like this, how from his style of fishing to these over here, like 
what you're seeing over there. He couldn't believe it. He just said, "Wow, all the years I worked 
like a slave, and I come on this thing and I don't even have to come on deck, ifs all, everything is 
right there. The guys do everything." He fell in love...he fell in love with the boat. He'd always 
used to talk about the boat, was Big Blue. He was, that was the name of the, he used to call, it 
was the Captain Mannow. He fell in love with that boat. And then he started, you know, my 
father's been gone ten years now and so, but he started, he worked until in the '60s, late '60s. He 
kept going, then he got sick of, what's that, 2007, right around there. Yeah, 2006 he started to get 
ill, and that was it for him. He stayed home and loaded with arthritis. His hands were 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
8 
humongous, his knees, everything was humongous on him from the arthritis. From that old style 
of fishing on the old, old eastern rigs. Those, that was, whew... 
MHA: That was tough fishing. 
BB: Oh, yeah, cause they had no shelter. Them, the boats back then had no shelter. These here 
have shelters on. They go through the wind and then, but them guys had nothing. There was 
nothing. There was spray coming over all the time. It was wet. These over here, they are all, you 
got shelter. You know what I mean. You get out of the cold weather. Them, the boats back then 
went a lot more than these guys did. They go in any weather, these guys don't go anymore. 
They'll wait another day and then they'll go out. But back then they had, it was eight days out and 
three days home. Eight and three, it was round, year-round, I can remember that when I was kid. 
My father's be going out, there’d be a storm coming, he's going. I'm like...I don't know. He loved 
it, I guess. 
MHA: So you only actually stayed fishing for a while, and then you did the... 
BB: Yeah, well, I got out of school '79 and I got out early in April cause I had a job with, in the 
shop I was in. You went to Voc, you had a job in your shop, you could get out of school early. I 
was in marine industries, and I got out April 2nd, and I went the 3rd, I went out. I had a new 
boat, I went on there, I fished there all summer, then I went on another one in the winter. Then I 
went back on there in the summer. Like, '81, '82 until my son was born, I didn't, I decided I 
wanted to stay home with him. I'd rather grow up with my kids and just pull, and stayed home 
and did what I had to do. But, there was, yeah till like around '86, thaf s when it, they just started 
shutting everything down for us, you know. I guess it was a lot of stuff run off, going around in 
Dartmouth and all through there. And they'd shut eveiything down. You couldn't do it no more. 
They'd shut the area for five days, you can't go. So what do you do, five days you got nothing. 
You have to go everyday or it's not worth it. That's when I decided to come down here, and here 
I am now. 
MHA: So how did you decide to do the oil delivery? 
[15:18] 
BB: What I did was, true story on that was, I was painting this guy's house and when we got all 
done painting the house, when I got all done with it. It took me all summer because I had a 
regular job, just a regular job and I went and did that. And when I got done, he said, "How much 
do I owe ya?" and showed him the price and he says, "Thaf s there's something's wrong with 
that." "Whaf s wrong?" He says, "If s got to be more than that." Now I told him, "Now I want you 
to get me job at the co-op." He says, "alright". Cause he was, he was... he was a big shot over 
there. So he says, "I'll get you a job there" and I ended up getting a job there. What it really was, 
I wanted a house. I wanted to buy a house. And what I was doing, I couldn't. The jobs I had, you 
know, with a bull rake and any of that stuff, self-employed, they're not going to give you a loan 
for a house. So what I did was, he got me a job there I waited a year and then I bought my first 
house in '88, ‘87 '88, whatever, '88 I think I bought it there and that's what got me going. 
Because I got nothing. You know back then, they wanted you, if you wanted to buy a house, you 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

had to have a stable job and they... that was my first house I ended up on that one. And that was 
it. But that was, and I ran the water boat for like ten months. Right before I went to the, right 
before I went to working at the co-op as a tanker, I ran that water boat for like ten months. You 
just water the boats around here. They all got water, you do them all, you do the whole 
waterfront. That was an early, four o'clock every morning I was down here until six, seven, eight 
at night. 
MHA: Does that require any kind of..? 
BB: No, there's nothing there Because it's not... 
MHA: It's not dangerous? 
BB: Because its not.. No it's just, you got to be careful. That's a very dangerous job. that one. 
That's more dangerous than this in the winter. Cause it gets icy on there, you fall in and..., you 
fall in there and it's all over. It happened to me once. Right on here. Right on the dock here. 
February fifth. I'll never forget. I went in and I went whoooh! I thought it was all over with. I 
saw my whole life go ahead of me and all of a sudden I felt somebody, the back of this pull me 
out. There was three guys on a boat. They heard me screaming. It was around... it wasn't light 
yet. It was around 5:30.1 slipped on a piece of ice. I fell right off the bow and I went right in. 
That was on the water boat. And that was a very dangerous job. 
MHA: Yikes! So, what kind of ethnic heritage, what... where are you folks from? 
BB: Well my father originally was from Canada. He was from Nova Scotia. And my mother , my 
mother she was from the city here. My grandparents were born in Portugal. Madeira. And they 
came here and they worked at the rope place, I forget what it was called. He had his family over 
here in New Bedford, up off Rockdale Avenue. And that's my mother. There was four of them. I 
guess my mother met my father and the rest is history. Five kids. They had five. Five kids. 
MHA: Are any of the others in the fishing business? 
BB: Not really no. My brother does alarms. My two sisters work in a ticket office and my other 
sister, she's um, she's a round somewhere, doing, I forget what she does now, but they're not 
really. I'm probably the only one. My wife's family, they're, she has a big fisherman family. 
They're all fishermen. On my wife's side. But not too many on mine. 
MHA: How did your father end up in fishing? 
BB: Well, I guess, back where he lived growing up there was, up in Nova Scotia, was a hard way 
of, I mean you're on your own at 10, 12, years old. You're on your own. You got to keep things 
together. You want to eat, you got to go hunt something. I know when he was young, he jumped 
on a schooner boat and you know, tried to make some money on there, and that way, what do 
you call it? And then he went into the Merchant Marine, I believe during the war. He was on 
there for a little while and when he came back he got off and I think he made his way to 
Gloucester. Worked out of there. I believe he worked out of Gloucester for a little while. And 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
10 
then he made his way down here and dragged out of here and then he worked his way up to 
captain and then he, around 1960 a guy had a new dragger made, a wooden one. He ran that for, I 
don't know, 15, 16 years, he had that. And he had that for, nobody ever took it out. I think he had 
it for the book was wrote was called The Dragger. Did you ever hear of that? The Dragger, the 
book. Well it was written on, back in '69. A guy went out on it and he did a story on the living, 
you know, what it was like living on a dragger. These guys working and... there's a book, I might 
have one in my, I have a copy in my truck if you want, to have a look at it after. But you'll like, 
if s a lot of pictures, you'll enjoy that book. Very good book to read. 
[20:50] 
MHA: So I imagine growing up here, you probably knew other fishermen...kids... 
BB: Oh yeah, you meet a lot of people down here. You meet a lot of people down here. Every 
day you, you meet a lot people down and they come and go. They just, wow, you can be talking 
to a few guys and every, once and while you talk to them and next thing you know they're gone. 
If s just a lot of drugs down here. You see a guy one day and the next day he's gone. A lot of guys 
I've known down here just... 
MHA: Really? 
BB: Yeah, if s, there's a big drug problem down here bad. It’s just... not good. 
MHA: Yeah it's all over. But I have heard that about here. And what do you attribute it to? Some 
people were saying that if s because there's so much money coming in with scallops that people 
don't know what to do with the money... 
BB: Well, I'll tell you what. Back when I was a kid there was a lot of, I mean a lot of fishermen 
would drink a lot, but that, it was whatever. They were tired. They worked for it. They deserved 
it. But if s nowadays, these guys here, whatever pills they're doing it's to keep them up. Taking 
pills or heroin. But they're doing the pills to stay up to keep up, to keep up. If you don't keep up 
you don't have a job. And once you're hooked on that, you're hooked on it. When you come 
home you're still going to be on it. It keeps you all... keeps you going all the time and that's the 
problem down here. There's young kids in their 20s, late teens, 20s that are on it. You look at 
them... I've known guys down here that I've seen them. I haven't seen them in 10 years and I look 
at them know and I'm like, "Wow!" I mean they come down the boat, they don't even have a car, 
they're walking. They have nothing; they have no gloves, looking for a job. These guys have 
been fishing 10, 15 years and they don't even have enough money to buy gloves. They have 
nothing...to go fishing with. There's a lot of that around here. A lot of it. 
MHA: It's' discouraging. 
BB: Yeah. You got to use your head right. If you get into this racket here, you have to use your, 
you're going to have to use your head right. You get in you take off, you get your check, go 
home. Don't be hanging around with the boys. You start hanging around with the boys, you start 
hitting the bars and the next thing you know, go the wrong way. I've seen it. I've seen these guys 
do it. 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

MHA: So when did you get hooked up with Bay Fuels? 
BB: I've been, Fve been, I don't know, it’s been what 13, 14 years I've been over here. I worked 
for another guy on the other side. I ran his barge for like eight years. And, it was just too much 
over there, too much headaches over there, so I... 
MHA: In Fairhaven? 
BB: On the other side of the bridge. And this is five days a week. This is nice five days is enough 
down here. I was working for that guy for six, seven days a week and it was just like, I mean 
early in the morning till night. It was just like, there was no time to do nothing. You know what I 
mean? Yeah, it was just too much. Over here is nice. Its five days, the way I like it. Leave me 
alone on the weekend. Do my thing, go camping with my trailer, just...got to relax. 
MHA: So do you know how most people learn how to become fuel oil...I mean obviously have 
to have the.... 
BB: There's not too many around anymore. There's not too many guys that, these guys, let me 
think now. There's not too many young guys coming in this. I mean there's another guy, Ray. 
He's old. He's probably got about 25 years in. Al's been at, 20, 20 something years I'd say. And 
there's, and the other guys, let me think...a young guys, but one guy's... there's not many guys 
getting into this down here, anymore. It's not a, it's not. You don't know what's going to happen. 
And on the other side of the bridge, thaf s all done by trucks. There's a lot of trucks. They do a lot 
of fuel up there, but ifs all done by truck. It's not, you really don't need a fuel barge for a... they 
figure ifs cheaper to do with a truck than a barge. Cause a barge is a lot of maintenance and a lot 
of insurance, liability. You never know what happens, so you got to... 
MHA: You need the double hull... 
[25:19] 
BB: Yeah, It's a lot easier on one of these than with a truck. It’s, you can do a scallop in less than 
an hour, thaf s moving. I mean you don't want seven, eight thousand an hour. That’s good, let’s 
get it done, because the faster you get these done, the faster the guys get paid. Because they don't 
get paid until the fuel everything comes on, all expenses come in and it's all deducted off and 
thaf s when they get their check. Thaf s how it works on the scallops. Draggers, ifs a little 
different on there. But the scallopers, let’s just saw, its 8500 gallons, whatever the price, two 
dollars, just whatever. You deduct the grub, whatever expenses they got that comes off there. 
Whatever's left, split 7 ways, or whatever, and that's how they make their money. They don't get 
paid until the fuel’s on. Thaf s how it works. So thaf s why you kind of like got to hustle down 
here to get, these guys start getting mad, they don't want to wait. 
MHA: How about the...you said the draggers are different? 
BB: I believe the draggers, the owner pays for half and they pay for the other half I believe that's 
how it goes on there. Scallopers, thaf s off the percentage and I believe that fuel comes off the 
top. I believe the owner pays for half and the gang pays for half I'm not sure on that. You never 
know, it might have changed. So ifs not.... 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
12 
MHA: It's kind of a moving target 
BB: Yeah... It’s... 
Mha: And how has your job changed over time, if it has? 
BB: If s definitely a lot less than what it was for... When I first started down, we were starting at 
4:35 in the morning. We were doing 11, 12 hours a day, five days. And that was four barges 
running. Nowadays, if s just like us. There's one barge, you can be done by 11, 12 o'clock. These 
scallopers, they only have so much, so many days a year to fish and then thaf s it. They're all 
over... you can be done in four months if you went right on it, you got all your trips done. You 
could be done in four months and thaf s it till next year, till March 1. So thaf s why if s, if s really 
cut a lot down. A lot of gallons are cut because what they, cutting all the time back, and days at 
sea for these guys, closed areas. If s really... years back it was average, two trips a month. So 
figure 22, 23 trips a year, now if s what, 5? Three closed areas, four closed areas. Yeah, it's like 
four, five. Thaf s it! Thaf s all they get now. 
MHA: What do people do the rest of the time? 
BB: Collect. Or they jump on another boat. A lot of them just jump on another one. Like say 
some guy has four or five boats, he's got two captains. They'll take the two. They'll run the two 
boats and then they'll just jump on the next boat, and then the next boat. They'll go two or three 
boats. Thaf s how if s done. But a guy with a single boat, a guy that owns a boat, he'll be... If a 
guy owns a single scalloper, those guys go on, and they'll jump on another one. And then they'll, 
somebody else will, there's always somebody with time left. They'll jump on there. They'll still 
make money. If s... You just got to be a good guy and you now you got to use your head, and you 
can fish year round. If you lose your head, you're gone. Fishing down here... because they come 
and go right through here. 
MHA: Do you ever regret, not continuing with either fishing or scalloping? 
BB: Well, the money now, kind of like, I see that and I just like, I shake my head. Phew...If I was 
younger, but yeah. That was... These guys, it’s big money now. But I see these guys making 
checks, 20 grand. 15, 20 thousand dollars and I see them coming down the dock, they got 
nothing. Three days later they're broke, no thanks. I'd rather be broke than get like that. 
[29:54] 
MHA: So, you mentioned kids 
BB: Yeah, I have a son and a daughter and they're in their 30s. My son works up at dockside and 
my daughter works up at Taunton State Hospital. They got good jobs. They are, my son made a 
trip fishing, he wasn't into it. So he works up at East. He's got a good gig up there, up at Eastern 
Fisheries. You know where that is? On the other side? He's got a good gig. He's been there, I 
don't know, 12 years? My daughter started about a year ago at Taunton hospital. She’s got a nice 
job there. Hopefully it'll pan out good for them. Thaf s all what if s for, I guess. 
MHA: Yeah. So, what kinds of, do you have any special tools that you have to use? 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
13 
BB: For this? Just your head. And hands! [both laughing] Just your head and hands! No, it's not 
really. Do your thing, just plan ahead what you're going to do. And think ahead before you do 
anything. That's the main thing down here. Its wintertime, there's ice on it. You come down the 
morning. You jump on a boat. There could be frost or ice, and you don't even know it. Thaf s the 
main thing, you got to think ahead when you come down here in the morning. You could jump 
right on in the morning and all of a sudden you're gone. You don't even know it’s there. A little 
bit of frost. That’s the main thing, you come down. I’ll play the temperature. If you see the 
temperature, if the temperature's below, like 30, watch out. Whenever, 40s, 50s, you're fine. But 
you start getting below 30, you jump off the dock on there...so far, so good. 
MHA: Well, knock on wood. So, what was I going to ask? Oh, I know that you work also in the 
shop... 
BB: Yeah, in the back. There's not much goes on back there. Everybody's in the back working on 
little stuff There's not much...after 12 o'clock, there's nothing going on around the waterfront. 
Everything, after 12, everything's...The waterfronf s basically early in the morning till 12 o'clock. 
If you come down here early in the morning you'll see guys working on nets. But after that...after 
12 o'clock if s all over with. If s always been like that. The afternoon, you see welding going on. 
A little painting, stuff like that. But after like 12 o'clock, lots, its starts, it’s slowing down. If s not 
much. Like this guy here'll have his welders or painters, you know, guys working in engine 
rooms, little, little stuff As you can see, look at how dead it is. Look, there’s nothing going on 
down here. In the summer time it will pick up a little bit. 
MHA: Whaf s your favorite part of your job? 
BB: whaf s my favorite part of the job? Down here in the spring, early in the morning. If s nice. 
Right, get around, April, May. Early in the morning, you come down here, it's nice down here. 
Early in the morning. You start getting in the summer when it's dead hot. Around noontime and 
you're out it gets hot. It gets very hot. You wouldn't think so, but it does. But early in the 
morning like five, six o’clock, coming down here, not much going on. You can go from one boat 
to the other. Nobody's moving around, and get the stuff done. Before, because once they start 
moving around. One those boats start moving around, you're all done for the day. "Oh, we're 
going to move! Can you move?" Here we go... 
MHA: So how many boats do you typically handle in a day? 
BB: Like today, we had, well, we only had two or three. Usually, six, seven. On a good day, 
seven, eight. It depends if there's a storm coming. Like if there's a storm, and they all shoot in 
together and they all unload the night before, we'll end up filling them the next morning. Thaf s 
probably whaf s going to happen Tuesday. There's a storm coming. They'll all be in Monday and 
Tuesday and we'll be right at it again. But if s not, not like it used to be, when there would be 60, 
70 boats in a day. That’s what we did over there. But over here you get 10; that’s probably the 
max you're going to get for, eight, ten a day. That's it. At the co-op with the four barges, we 
have, we did a lot of them. We could get a lot done in a day with four barges running. And there 
was three guys on each barge, so it was nice. It helped out a lot. It was good. Because when you 
are two or three boats in, its a lot easier for that guy to pull the hose to you, to the other one. It 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
14 
wasn't as hard. But once you plan everything, plan everything You'll be fine. You just got to plan 
what you're going to do. 
MHA: So, where is the inlet, or I don't know even what you call it where you put the hose in... 
BB: Oh, the fill pipes? Yeah, they're on the sides. Basically, all these here. There's either two or 
four. Or there might be another tank, but they're all on the side. They’re simple now, they're 
not... And then you go down to the engine room and there's sight glasses and you just watch 
them as they come up. And they're all marked. Basically we have them all marked so we know. 
Each at a thousand gallons, there's another thousand, another. So we know where everything's at. 
So you know, well it's going to be at least 3000 here, 4000 there. At least we know, when it's 
going to get close to, so we can stay on deck and we can make sure eveiything is cool and then 
we run down and check it. Another 500 there on this side, then we’re done, that's how it... Every 
thing's marked. To tell you know what's going on. Its simple now, is not bad. Very, it’s simple. 
Anybody can do this. 
[35:07] 
MHA: And what is your, and what do you like least about the job? Ice? 
BB: What do I like least? I don't know. Not really. It’s... I don’t think there’s anything... least 
about the job. I don't know. I don't have nothing. But I think probably the worst would be just 
start filling a boat and the guys got to move. That's probably like the, you know, the worst. You 
know if you pull the hoses two in and you just start and the guys says I'm going to move. That's, 
kind of like a, can be a pain, but like anything else. You get used to it. 
MHA: So is it, when you think about the waterfront now, and you can tell me about the old days 
and then, now. Is there a lot a competition? 
BB: What do you mean? Between fuel barges? 
MHA: Fuel barges, and even... 
BB: These boats work? Oh, I'm sure there is with these boats working there. There's 
competition. Skippers on skippers, definitely. One's got to have more than the other. That's 
always been like that down there. That's always been like that down here. It’s, but no, it's not 
with the barges. You know, you have your own boats, everybody has their own. Everybody's got 
a piece of the pie, so there’s no, there's nothing on that. It's just do your barge... I mean do your 
stuff with your barge and them guys do their, and everything. 
MHA: How do, I guess why do some boats choose one company over another? 
BB: I don't know. Everybody, it's weird. It depends who you like. That's what it amounts to. 
Everybody basically stays where they're at for years. They don't move too much. So everybody 
stays with their... I don't know, they take care of them, got problems, we'll tow you around, we'll 
move you around. You need to move a boat and you can't start your motor, and we'll tow them 
around. Or somebody else might do this. Everybody has their own boats. There's no, there used 
to be, try to get but, it doesn't...You got to be well-liked down here on the waterfront. If you're 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
15 
not, you're not going to make out. You know what I mean? You're always crying the blues, 
nobody's going to come to you when you have money. Some people cry the blues and they got 
no money. And then they got plenty of money that's the ones. ..Crying games. 
MHA: So have the regulations effected, well, you mentioned, actually... 
BB: Definitely, definitely. That's ...definitely knocked out a lot. All the draggers are gone. There 
are no draggers left. That was... the draggers would, when they started in the 90s with the 
scalloping, different rings and stuff like that. Boats would tie up or whatever, the draggers would 
keep you going for the winter because they went all the time. But they're starting on them too. 
These guys have to pay for quota to go fishing, to go dragging, you got to pay to go fishing. I 
don't know whaf s going to happen. I have no clue whaf s... it's going to be very small the way it's 
going. If the scallopers where out of here, this waterfront, there would be nothing here. Thaf s 
what keeping everything going. 
MHA: I'm curious about one thing about the scallopers. I know the old days when I first started, 
I dealt mostly with the trawlers and there were a lot of family boats, and I don't know if that's 
true of the scallopers. Or even if if s still true on the draggers? 
BB: Well, um, there's a lot of family, especially on the other side. Not much here. Because this 
guy owns all these here. But in the other side, there's still Norwegians that have passed down to 
their sons or nephews and they run, there's a couple of them over there. Let me think...There's 
just a few guys that they're just in their 50's. They just sold out their scallopers. They got big 
money for them. But there's a few around. There's still a few around from generations that passed 
it down to their sons or nephews, but ifs not, I don’t know. The dragging... thafs, a... that's 
dying... that's going fast. It's not good, the way it looks. 
[40:05] 
MHA: So has that affected the sense of the fishing community? You know, is there still people 
feeling like it is a fishing community and... 
BB: Well the... I think what puts it together is the scalloping keeps, you know, all these young 
guys, and guys in their 40s or 50s, they're scallopers, they're making a decent amount of money. 
And the draggers, these guys that are in their 50's and 60's, they can't really go scalloping, they 
don't know nothing else. They just got to finish, finish their time, what they have, working and 
thafs going to be the only way. There's no... It’s not like it used to be years down here when I 
can remember when I was a little kid there would be... we'd be down with my father and there 
would be the other boats down here, and their kids would be on the boat, they were like our age, 
eight, nine, ten years old. They'd be jumping up on the rigging, they'd be all over the boats 
having, eating whatever they could. But you never see that no more. You don’t see too much of 
the young kids, young, ten, twelve, eight years old, come on the boat anymore and just play 
around, you don't see that no more. I can remember when I was small I would, if my father was 
in it was the summer. I’d paint, whatever, paint boards, or I used to paint the wheelhouse floor, 
the grates, I used to clean and but, that, them day, they don't see that no more. There's no 
bringing the family down to the boat anymore. I haven't seen that in years, oh in years! It's all 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
16 
changed. Definitely has changed. 
MHA: Do you think it's that the kids aren't interested anymore? 
BB: I think it is, yeah. Well you got to remember, kids now, back then, we didn't have nothing. 
Back then there wasn't really much. Nowadays its all computers, all this stuff to fool around 
with. They don't want that, that's what they want. They don't want to come down here to these 
stinky boats, they’re all rusted up! You know they don't want to go on that. Kids don't find that 
interesting. But you know, its definitely has changed, that's for sure. 
MHA: What would you give, what advice would you give somebody who is just starting out? 
BB: What to go fishing? Or to... 
MHA: Whatever even, you know... 
BB: Working on the barge? 
MHA: Yeah 
BB: Well, just use your head. Don't get into trouble. Go home every day. Don't go to the bars! 
[Both laughing] Just use your head, get yourself settled down, buy yourself a house and then you 
know, there's something to work for. You don’t get in trouble. Because you know. I’ve seen a lot 
of them come and go down there. Even guys that worked on the barges with me. They’re all... 
got into the wrong stuff... gone! Nope 
MHA: So, does everybody who works on the barge have to have the tankerman? 
BB: You could... As long as the guy in the wheelhouse has or the guy operating the barge has 
that, and you could have a kid on there and he’ll take care of the boat; he can fill it up Because 
you really don't need anybody on the boat to fill it, with the license. But it's good to have two 
guys on both ends. Because if you was to come to a boat and you gave this guy who just came in 
fishing, been out for twelve days, and you gave him two nozzles, you tell him, “here you go!”. 
That guy's going to stick them in the pipe, open them up. He's going to walk away; he's going to 
go in the shower... Next thing you know the fuels coming out. So you're better off having 
somebody come in and do it, they know what they're doing, jobs done and it's over with, because 
you can’t just give these guys believe me! They'd take right off Or they'll put in the wrong tank, 
or they'll put lube in the water tank. I've seen that. I've seen lube go in water tanks. I've seen 
water go in fuel tanks. But it's, you got...Best to know somebody who knows what they're doing. 
Let them do it. Less aggravation. 
MHA: What happens when something like that, when they do screw up like that? 
BB: Well, I did it once, long time ago. But it was nothing. It was, it was when I was on the 
waterboat, I had a booklet on there and it gave every boat where the fill was. Everything and you 
open up to that page and it said to pull it forward. And there was a pipe there so I stuck the hose 
in there and I started filling, and I could smell fuel, I had it running for like minute or so. I shut it 
off, and somehow or another, they put, they moved the pipe around and in the booklet they never 
changed it. So I ended up putting 100 gallons, but it was no problem. I called the owner up. He 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
17 
said, I'll be down there at 8 o'clock. We'll straighten it all out. I went down at 8 o'clock and he 
says, "just open that valve up, leave that open, and when the fuel starts coming out, it's all set.” 
Cause it separates. 
MHA: Ah, right. Of course 
BB: So it all came out and that was it. Thaf s the only time I've ever had a, had a something like 
that happen. But that was running the waterboat when I put water, you know, in the pipe. 
MHA: Yeah. 
BB: It was just one of them, the booklet was never changed. They never changed the booklet. 
But the booklet came with the boat, where the fillers are —starboard bow, forward pipe, stuff like 
that. And they never changed that one. And by the way, that's the guy that gave me the job for 
the co-op. That was his boat. That’s so it wasn’t, he was cool. "Thaf s nothing. Just open it and 
ifll all come out. Just stay right here till you see fuel. And when you see fuel just shut the valve 
and thaf s it! And I did it. There was no problem. No problem at all. 
[45:37] 
MHA: Is there any special terminology that's part of your work? 
BB: Not really. Just, not nah, nothing. 
MHA: How about nicknames? 
BB: Well everybody has a nickname down here, just about. A lot of these people don't even 
know how to say a Portuguese name, so they give him a nickname. Even when I was a kid, I 
could remember that. And there was nobody, everybody had nicknames down here. It's just some 
of these people are from different countries, Polish or Norwegian. You couldn't remember their 
names, so you just give them a name. So that, thaf s how anybody remember it. Thaf s how, you 
can't, I mean, sorry, if s Tom, Billy, Joe, you remember that, but you get this guy, whaf s his 
name, I forgot how to say it, just give him a name. Everybody knew that. Everybody would call 
him that. Every body would, I know at the co-op how we used to. We didn't know. We used to 
do a lot of draggers, Portuguese draggers and we'd forget the guy's name and we'd just kind of 
see who he looks like and we’d give him a name. And that’s how we, the next guy, “Hey what's 
up, Tony" His name wasn't Tony. We used call him Tony Danza cause he looked like Tony 
Danza. Thaf s how he got the name. And still till this day when he's around, everybody calls him 
that. Tony Danza. If s all, everybody has a little nickname or something to. I'm sure if you go up 
to the Heritage Center, you'll see a lot. In the back. There's a ton of them. There's a few hundred, 
two or three hundred up there. Even more. 
MHA: So how did you get into your drawing? 
BB: Well, When I was a kid, thaf s all I used to do was draw on my desk in school and I 
remember the teacher saying to me, she says, “if you paid attention more to your work than your 
drawing, you'd be the teacher here." I'm like, yeah I know. I used to tell, "yeah this is boring I'd 
rather draw!" She's "No, you got to learn this first." And I can remember in seventh grade we had 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
18 
this, it was an hour and a half, different like, math hour and a half, then on Fridays you had 
drawing for an hour and a half And I remember sitting at the desk we went to the art teacher, 
went to her class, start drawing this thing. Next thing you know she tapped me on the shoulder, I 
was all done and she says, get up. I'm like, "What?" “Get up.” She sat in my chair and she says to 
me. Now you teach the class. Because I just went to college to learn how to draw and you just 
drew that in five minutes. You teach the class! I'm like, Nah, nah! Give me my seat back. I've 
always enjoyed drawing. It’s just relaxing to draw. I'm sure you seen the shells, and like that. I 
like. I’ve got to be in the mood to do it. It's like anything else. If I'm in the mood, I love drawing 
this stuff It's not a... I got to be in the mood to do it. I've always fooled around. Drawn murals 
and all little stuff like that. The shells I enjoy doing. I've done all right with the shells. Stuff like 
that. 
MHA: So do you, either of your kids draw? 
BB: Nope. 
MHA: Isn't that interesting 
BB: Nope, they won't even, won't even pick up a pencil or nothing to draw. I try to show them. 
Nope, they're not. Can I put this down a little bit? [fiddling with the mic] 
MHA: Oh, yeah, let me. I'll get my keys. It is getting hot in here. 
[keys jangle, door opens, and vehicle beeps] 
BB: There we go. 
MHA: All right. Okay. I'm going to just review the questions here and see if there is anything I 
forgot to ask you. What do you see for the future of the fuel barges? Do you think everybody's 
going to turn to trucks eventually? Especially if there are no young people coming in. 
[49:47] 
BB: Well we just got to, see a lot of these barges down here they're all basically new. So they got 
a long time to go on them. 
MHA: Right 
BB: Just get the guys to run them, if s fine. But do it with the truck, it you tie up a truck, you can't 
tie a truck up that long. A truck has to make so much money per hour. If it doesn't it's not worth 
it. If you put a truck down there filling a boat and the thing's there for a long time. I'm talking 
about an 18-wheeler, he’ll come down with eight, nine, thousand. For him to get rid of that, he's 
going to be there a while. But for him to drop that somewhere, it's 22 minutes. Say a gas station, 
thaf s gasoline, you can't tie, hang on second. 
MHA: Sure. 
BB: You can't tie a truck up that long. Cause then you're... These are all moving barges, as long 
as there's boats around, its fine. It doesn't take much to get it. Just take the course for that and just 
work your way in. There's probably, one, two...There's probably eight guys down here. One, two. 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
19 
six, eight guys that have a tankerman. Other than that, there's nobody. Once you’re in, what 
happens if you don't use your tankerman, if you don't use your tankerman, in like five years, 
when if s time to renew, and you got to have a letter where you worked. You lose it. So you have 
to work in it. You have to work in that field. So somehow or another within five years, or you 
lose it. Yeah, they just don't. If I left here for five years, six years, and came back, I got to renew 
everything. I mean you got to do everything over again, not renew it, do eveything over again, 
that's the hard part. 
MHA: So taking the test and going up and getting your physical. You got to get your physical 
anyway though... 
BB: Yeah, well the physical isn't too bad. Just go to Fairhaven and they, just I went last week. 
Renewed everything, the physical for two years. Now I got to do it in another two years. I want 
to hit the lottery! 
MHA: Yeah! I think I asked you everything I planned to ask you. Can you think of anything that 
I haven't asked that I should have asked? 
BB: You pretty well got it all down. You pretty well got it all down, the way it works down 
there. 
MHA: Are you, do you see, are you mentoring anybody, coming up? Do you see anybody 
maybe, you think, eventually...? 
BB: What, to work down here? Not really. No, it's not, if s I don't know, if s very hard to... I 
mean it’s the fuel. Who knows whaf s going to happen to this place here, if that place gets shut 
down. If they end up taking that place out of there. That's the fuel right there in that whole 
building, if s all connected to them, if something happens there. The only place you're going to 
get fuel is right over here. By the Ice House and thafs... 
MHA: Yeah, I didn't know this was still active. 
BB: That one is too, and there's another tank with 2-oil. And there's another tank that's shut 
down. But this is, this tank you see right here, this tank is marine fuel. 
MHA: Okay, I didn't even realize that. 
BB: I would say, I was told, in ‘ 18, that all the fuel is going to be the same. Boat fuel and house 
fuel. Because it’s the sulfur they're trying to get rid of, pollution. And this fuel right here, it 
bums clean. Not, it’ll give you the... stop pollution going in the air. 
MHA: Yeah 
BB: This is different fuel from what goes in your house. 2-oil is, doesn't bum good. It throws a 
lot of stuff in the air. That's what the fishing boats used to bum. Now they switched them over to 
this. This is a cleaner fuel. It burns hot, it burns good. So thafs the... 
MHA: Is it more efficient for the boats themselves? 
BB: If s a better fuel. Yeah, thing with that, if s a better fuel, it's cleaner, it doesn't have much 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017

lubricant in it, but it's better for your engine. It'll bum cleaner. You can tell by some of these over 
here, if they're not. All the rigging turns black from this stuff right here. It doesn't... The old stuff 
they used to have would turn all the mast, the boom, everything would turn black from the way it 
burned. Thaf s not, there's definitely a lot changing down here on the, down around this side here. 
I don't know whaf s going to, what's going to go on. 
MHA: We were talking about, for a minute, about community and I want to go forward with that 
a little bit more. I know there used to be a blessing of the fleet that was pretty active... 
BB: That was big. Now they have it. It's not... If s not like it used to be. Back in like the 70s, late 
‘60s and ‘70s, There was a lot of these Portuguese draggers, just about all of them used to go out. 
But now, nope you don't see that no more. It’s all the past all that now. It's all changed. Nope 
they're not into it no more. 
MHA: So do you think that the Heritage Center will become a good collecting place? 
BB: Sure! Just keep loading that place right up with stuff People like looking at stuff They love 
just going in there and staring at things. That’s what they like looking at, from the years back. 
And the more pictures up there. People like staring at that. 
MHA: Yeah. 
[55:47] 
BB: And you'll... I was there a few times and I was watching some guy and he was just staring at 
a picture for like five minutes, and I'm like, "Wow, what is this guy looking at?!" [both laughing] 
I says, "Hey what are you looking at?" He says, "No, I just thinking, if that was me at the time. 
I'm just thinking, wow, they went through a lot." It was a picture of something they had hanging 
on the wall, but that picture's gone. The guy’s expression in the wheelhouse... he was very 
attached to it and he... That place, as long as they keep that going and get more things in there, 
get some movies, some old stuff, I think that'll turn out. 
MHA: Yeah, I think they are trying to also do more events, so that people will come for those. 
BB: Yep 
MHA: Make it a little community center or something. 
BB: Yeah, if you get more stuff in like the Whaling Museum... You go into the Whaling 
Museum, everywhere you look, there's something. There's people just hooked on that. Got to get 
more stuff I'd like to find an old dory to put in there. There's supposedly one around with my 
father's boats. Supposedly down at the Cape, and if s still around. I'd like to put that in there. That 
would look real nice in there. Nice orange-painted up. Put that right in there. Even if you could 
hang it. Whatever. Just put it up in there. That's what people want to look at, they like looking at 
stuff Hey, hopefully it will stay there. 
MHA: Yeah, I hope so. Well, lef s see. I think I've asked you everything that I...I'm sure I'll think 
of something as soon as... 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
21 
BB: Well edit it in! 
MHA: I might have to give you a call or something. 
BB: Yeah, no problem. You can see how, look how dead it is here. 
MHA: Yeah 
BB: Just look at this. There's nothing going on. Ever3hhing’s, all the rules, regulations just wiped 
everything right out, there's nothing. 
MHA: Well they almost did that to the scallop industry too. 
BB: Yeah, well back when all that scalloping was getting bad in the early ‘90s. These guys 
were... well they had to. They had mortgage to pay for on these boats and they weren't doing 
nothing. They did everything and they just... They took all the small ones, they had to do it. They 
had to do it. That’s the only way they made it. What they did, when they started coming around 
with the big rings, so the small ones would fall through, that's what kind of got it going. Now 
they've been using them for a long time and I think thaf s what helping it. What happens when if s 
rough out and the dredges are coming up off the bottom, a lot of the small ones fall through the 
rings and they...you know what I mean? And thafs what bringing it around. If you get even a 
little, if you let it settle a little bit down here. A few months, five, six months, it’ll come back 
again. But if you have these guys, they'll just take everything. Thafs what happened before. The 
way they got it now, if s just perfect. Just regulate it and the boafs done for the year. If s done. 
Thafs it. It's the best way to do it. These guys will always make...this will be here for a while. 
MHA: So what about the finfish? Now, there have been so many regulations, so many cutbacks 
but there's still a lot of fish; well the haddock's come back, but the cod... 
BB: The cod's around, they just can't go to the area's where cod is. 
MHA: Ah. 
BB: Yeah it's all, there's stuff out there. There's guys that go out there with cameras and their 
nets and shows the cod going through it. And thafs open just to see, it’s a monitor. It's like a big 
cone on top and it just watches. It's got lights on it and watches the fish go through. The yellow 
tails, it watches everything. It watches everything go through. The cod end’s open, and then it 
just goes back out. They don't, they're not there to kill the fish, they're there just to watch whafs 
in there. And it shows it, whafs in there. There's different areas that you can't go in. They don't 
want you there. So they’re, thafs the problem. But ifs like anything else. You start opening up, 
these guys will just tear it right apart, fast. These guys got big nets, big power, they'll rip it right 
apart and all the work they've done, if s all gone. They'll rip that apart in no time. 
MHA: So there has to be a happy medium though. 
BB: The happy medium is going to be the fish swimming out of a closed area. They're picking 
them up. Thafs probably about the only way. You can't, those fish are in there breeding. You 
start going in there tearing it apart, it's all over. It's tough; it's hard. The nets are bigger than they 
were years back, so they're catching all, these nets humongous. It not like years, 30 40 years ago. 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
22 
they had small nets. These nets are three times as big and they're wide and they're taking 
everything. And that's, its takes, it destroys everything. Yeah, little by little it's tearing apart. If it 
ain't rules and regulations, it's taking everything. If they gave these guys good money for there 
stuff, you wouldn't have the problem. 
MHA: Right, right. 
[1:01:00] 
BB: But they don't give you. everybody comes in at one time the price is junk. You got a day 
when there's only two boats in, they get three, four dollars a pound, and two days later it's 60 
cents, 80 cents a pound. I mean come on, how do you... And these guys wouldn't need to go 
back out again and tear ever3Thing apart. You give them a set price on everything it would... I 
think, I don't know, what do I know? I'm not... Thafs my honest opinion. Everybody gets a set 
price and that's it. If s definitely not a... I don't know, [unintelligible] I guess. 
MHA: Well it is true. I started going, I went out on boats out of Provincetown when I was grad 
student and it seems like some of the prices are the same now as they were then and that was a 
lot of years ago! 
BB: Oh yeah! definitely. Definitely. Well they, what do you got, there's no body there to back 
you, they can do whatever they want. These buyers can do whatever they want. "Hey, if you 
don't like it, I can get it somewhere else. The problem down here is that there's fish they can get, 
it comes in, they can get it frozen, boxed up ready to go. When if s ready. Like McDonald's or 
where do you think there fish comes from? It doesn't come from here! There's no market. There's 
not enough fish coming in. When big ships come in, comes right off the ship, its boxed, if s ready 
to go, ifs going wherever it...California, wherever, it’s all, not here. There' not enough here to do 
anything. There's not enough fish coming in, they couldn't keep up. They can fish in the Bering, 
Sea, or where ever. North Sea, wherever, that they get two or three million pounds and they 
come home and ifs all, forklifts right off the side onto reefer trucks and ifs gone to wherever it's 
going. Over here, you're not going to get that. 
MHA: That's why they have started trying to push local catch and the community supported 
fisheries and that sort of thing for at least a few people to get better prices. 
BB: Yeah, I mean if you had fish around here that you could sell to a fish market, but ifs, I don't 
know. I'm sure like down the Cape and up in Maine where all the tourists go in the summer, 
thafs from people like fish. I'm sure you can move a lot of fish. But in the winter, you're not 
going to move, you're not going to move nothing. You know what I mean. The scallops...! don't 
know who's eating all the scallops, but there's a lot that comes through here. I do about 20 of 
them a month and thafs it. Basically thafs... 
MHA: So what do you think they'll do with Carlos' boats? Will they keep going do you think? 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
23 
BB: I don’t know. I don't think they'll touch the scallopers, I don't think. I think that if anything 
it'll be the draggers. I don’t know. I don't know what. There's nothing on the scallopers, because 
they didn't do nothing! Guess if it is, if s just the draggers that are... It was in today’s paper. 
There's an article in today's paper. Did you see today's paper? 
MHA: I haven't seen it yet 
BB: Well, yeah. 
MHA: If s in the Standard-Times? 
BB: Yeah. 
MHA: Well, I'll take a look. 
BB: Yeah, thafll, domino effect! Greed! Thafs what happens. You just, you know, you're 
hurting, you hurt more than other things, you're doing a lot. You know, a lot of people that work 
down here. You know what I mean it all adds up to, it comes down to everybody. 
MHA: Yep. Yep. 
[1:05:10] 
BB: Yeah. Now what, did you go out of P-town on a boat when you went out? 
MHA: Yeah. 
BB: What one you go out on? 
MHA: I went out on a bunch of them. I'd just go down at 4 o'clock in the morning and I'd hail a 
captain... 
BB: Oh yeah!? What year was that? 
MHA: Oh, that was in summer of ..it was just summer! I had it easy. It was summer of'75. And 
I’d just hail a captain going out and just ask if I could go out with them for the day and almost 
always said yes. There was one guy that didn't. It was just as well, the wind was really blowing 
and he was Portuguese-speaking almost entirely, so I would have had a hard time 
communicating with him. 
BB: See, did you ever take picture of that or anything? 
MHA: Oh yeah. 
BB: Yeah, see that. Thafs history you got right there. Because you don't see that no more. Have 
you ever had those pictures? Ever had them blown up and put them over here? People like 
looking at that. 
MHA: Yeah that, there were a couple of pictures that really were kind of fun. I mean I wasn't a 
fantastic photographer, but there was one that I took of a dory on top of the... 
BB: The wheelhouse. 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
24 
MHA: The wheelhouse. And it was one of those wooden dories and it was filled with those 
wooden fish boxes. Oh if 11 do a lot of good... 
BB: That was all just for show...that was all just for show. 
MHA: But it didn't occur to me! yeah! Well they had to have them I think. 
BB: Yeah they had to have... and back then, if I can... They had, a lot of them they had to have 
orange masts, so you could see from a distance if something was wrong, if the Coast Guard had 
to come out, orange goes a long way, with blue. Thaf s, Td often ask my father, how come the 
masts are all orange down here? He says " that's if something happens, if the Coast Guard or 
somebody's coming up.” Cause back then there wasn't much communication, it was a like a radio 
that was all static. He said they'd look, they could tell by the masts, there's a boat over there. 
Let's go to that one. That's how they, that's why they had the orange color. It would show 
everything. I remember him telling me that. 
MHA: When you were, when you first started when you were out on the boats how many crew 
members where there? 
BB: 12. 12, 13 guys. It was a six and six. On deck for six hours, off, and now if s seven. These 
guys work hard. There's only seven guys. You can't go more than seven. But back then it was, 
you had four guys on deck all the time, you had a cook. Cook would get up early in the morning 
and cook breakfast, he'd go out on deck around nine, ten o'clock till 11:30, he'd cook lunch and 
he’d come back in the afternoon and after supper, he'd sleep to the next morning. And the 
engineer would watch everything, down the engine room. Then you had the captain, the mate. It 
was easy going. But these guys, no. It's a lot of cutting, for seven guys, the trips that are coming 
in. But it’s not, thaf s the way they figure. If they were to let these guys go, 12, 13 guys go out, 
they would have wiped up right out. Instead of having 40 thousand they would have 60 thousand 
and thaf 11 just wipe it right out. I think the best thing down here is putting the closed areas 
18,000, that’s the best. Because then it’s it, it’s all over with. You give these guys, six trips, 
seven trips a year in a closed area, whatever, and that's it for the year. You don't go out and try to 
make a big trip in 40, 50 thousand, then you're cleaning everything out. You're wiping 
everything out fast. I don't know. What do I know? I’m just a tankerman. 
[both laughing] 
MHA: Well, You’re around, and you hear things. 
BB: Yeah, I just been around a long time. 
MHA: Oh I know...that was one thing I was curious about. Do you have much interaction with 
the boats, with the crew? 
BB: The crew, oh yeah! Yeah, I do and a lot of guys to talk to. And every boat you go on 
especially like on the scallopers, the guys always talk to you and they want shells. Or draw 
something for them. A lot of that! All these guys will talk. When they're unloading, it’s, that's 
usually the best, when they're unloading. You can talk to guys when they're unloading the boat. 
Makes it go by, you know, the time goes by faster, than sitting there with nobody there. Its... I 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
25 
mean seen these faces down there for a long time. A lot of guys. Basically. 
MHA: We should have you be doing some of the interviews! 
BB: Oh, I can't do that! This is all right like this. I can't get in front of people. Nope. nope. Yep, 
so I don't know what's going to happen down there next week, whenever this thing goes on. Or 
what they're going to do. So where do you go from here? You go up to the Fishing Heritage? 
MHA: Yeah, I'll do that. They have an event tonight. They're going to be talking about 
superstitions. 
[1:10:00] 
BB: Yeah, Laura was saying something like that. Yeah, there was a lot. My father was bad on 
that. You couldn't whistle in the house, it was weird stuff on the boat. I had to go, you could 
never say "pig" on a boat, well whistling in the house was the worst. 
MHA: Thaf s interesting, I wonder why the house? I mean I... 
BB: I don't know why... 
MHA: Usually the ones Fve heard on the boat you can't do... 
BB: But no, it was in the house. I can remember as a kid, "Aw don't be doing that!" I'm like 
why? "Ah if s bad luck.” I'm like, come on! 
MHA: Well, they also, when I was going out on the boats even then, there were some people 
who didn't want women on board. 
BB: Same thing. I remember that. But when, you could go on a boat when you tied to the dock, 
going out, unloading, or whatever, thaf s fine. But to go fishing... that was like the... it was like 
an omen. But hey, there's been a lot of girls that fished out of here! I don't know. I've never heard 
of any, you never see any boats going out with girls on them, do you? 
[both laughing] 
MHA: Yeah, and then now, with a bunch of the observers, are females 
BB: Yeah, some of that stuff, some of that stuff ..foolishness, definitely foolishness. I don't 
know. All I could tell you about something, when something goes wrong, three things are going 
to go wrong. And if something's going to right, three things are going to go right. That's my 
honest belief You got a flat tire here today, you get that fixed, two more things are going to 
happen. And that's definitely true. I believe in that. 
MHA: Trouble in threes. 
BB: Yep definitely. Most definitely. Yeah, I'd like to see if I can get that dory. It’s supposedly 
down at Hyannis. 
MHA: Well, thaf d be fun. 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
26 
BB: It was built in 60, or '59? It was on the Olamarie. That'd be nice to put that up in there 
MHA: Yeah, it would be great 
BB: So who’s going up there tonight? Do you know? Is there a lot of people going up? 
MHA: I don't know. I haven't, I don't know if they have any kind of sign up for it whether they're 
just hoping... 
BB: See, all the old timers are gone, if s too bad, I mean there's probably a handful. And maybe 
three or four or five fishermen that are in their 80s, that are still around. My step father-in-law, 
he owned a boat and he's in his 80s and he's not doing good right now. He's like the last of them, 
he's in his 80s And then there was another guy I sent, he finally went there two weeks ago. Leo 
Tuttle. He was a captain. He was from the old school. And other than that there's really, there's 
not that many old-timers that are around to, you know what I mean, its tough. 
MHA: Well, I know that we’re trying to make sure that we get some oral histories from people 
that are getting up there. 
BB: Yeah, there’s a few around. I’m trying to... And the thing is down here, there's not many 
places where fishermen can go to anymore. I mean years back there were hardcore barrooms but, 
the Harborside, the Cultivator, the National. And Fairhaven, there's two over there. Those were 
hardcore barrooms; if you went in there, those were the old-type fishermen. You come in there, 
have a couple of pops, whatever and go home. Those were the guys you wanted, they would tell 
you the old stuff Nowadays, you got to watch out. Nope, back in the late 70s, early 80s thaf s 
when they were, the old... those boys are all gone. 
[1:14:58] 
MHA: Yep, even in... I spent a fair amount of time in Gloucester and they used to have, well 
they still have the St Peter's Club but that used to be the place where fishermen would go. 
BB: Fishermen would go... 
MHA: Hang out, yeah. 
BB: I remember back in '75, the guy that owned the Olamarie he came and got me and my 
brother, it was like a couple weeks before school. They come up to the house on a Sunday, got 
me and my brother, we went all the way to Gloucester in his Cadillac, the boat, my father's boat 
was up on the railroad, railways, I think it was called Rocky Neck. 
MHA: Oh yeah. 
BB: It was a shipyard. So we get up there, we're scraping and painting, whatever. We thought 
we're going home at the end of the day. Nope. Sleep up on the boat, same clothes, next morning, 
get up, scrape, prime, paint. Thought we were going home that day. Nope. We got there Sunday. 
We were there Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We left Saturday. We 
were there for the whole week on the boat. Brought no clothes with us, the boat, it was, he took 
us out to eat every night... whatever, how do you... 14, 15 years old and you're... I'll never forget 
Interview with Bob Bowers, March 8, 2017 
27 
that. We got paid, but we never saw the money. My mother got it. She claims she bought school 
clothes, ril never forget that. I even took pictures of it. I brought a camera with me and I took 
pictures of the boat on the rails. They were doing work on it. We just painted the wheelhouse, all 
the inside the wheelhouse and a few things here and there and inside for a whole week. Well, you 
haven't seen the book The Dragger yet? 
MHA: No. 
BB: I tell you what. Take a ride over there, and let's see if if s in my truck and you can look. You 
know I had it in there. I don't think I let anybody borrow it. 
MHA: I'm going to turn this off now 
BB: Thafs fancy! 
MHA: Yeah! 
BB: Is that yours? 
MHA: No it belongs to the, actually they bought it with the grant...
