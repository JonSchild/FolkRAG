Pre-Interview 
As this was our first remote interview we’d be doing for this project, the time leading up to the 
interview consisted of a bit more technical prepwork than I usually do for in person interviews. I did 
some research in the days leading up to the interview looking into what program to use for VOIP 
recording, starting from a list / some mentions brought up from an Archie Green Fellows happy hour call 
organized a few months past. I eventually settled on Zencastr as it allowed for .wav recording, and it 
seemed somewhat user friendly. After settling on that software, I went to Youtube to watch a tutorial 
video to make sure I knew how to setup / manage the recordings, which was extremely helpful. It 
mentioned that one of the main things was making sure not to leave the window / close the interview 
until the recordings finished uploading from both sides: Zencastr records the audio separately on two 
channels (so one for me and one for Jayme) that then have to get mixed together in post, and closing 
out early / before it is ready means it might  
I sent the link to Jayme over Facebook for getting into the same recording session, and then went into a 
weekly staff meeting that morning, leading to me being slightly late to the time we said we’d start 
(11am), but we both joined up in the Zencastr ‘episode’ room and got started. I walked through how 
Zencastr works, and checked that the ‘health checks’ it runs were all set: i.e. internet connection, 
microphone etc. Jayme was using a microphone we had sent to her, to ensure that the recording quality 
on her end was good, and it sounded a bit quiet so Jayme bumped up the input volume on the 
microphone so it was a bit more even. I ended up using the Zoom H5 as my mic, using it over USB on the 
audio interface setting.  
Before we got started with the interview Jayme and I chatted a bit, and about the release form, how the 
interview was structured. Then we jumped right in. 
Interview 
During the interview, Jayme talked about coming from a family of racers, with her father racing, and her 
grandfather as well. She traced back her start to seeing her friends Greenley and Abby race, and thinking 
of giving it a shot as well: starting out in kart racing around 2015, which she currently still races in. 
Jayme currently races in the adult / top division despite being sixteen, and explained how the different 
divisions worked – with it being mostly divided by age. Jayme described the different parts of the kart, 
the gear she runs, and differences between chassis and technology: her kart now actually can hook up to 
a laptop to show / review her performance in the previous week(s).  
Jayme walked through how she prepares for a race during the week, and shined a light on some of the 
most important skills/things to know within a race – and outside of a race, and closed by discussing / 
talking about what she enjoys most about it and what keeps her interest in racing (primarily the 
competitive side of it). Jayme also shared advice for others thinking about getting into it and one of the 
major challenges being dealing with frustration – sharing sometimes it can get really frustrating when 
not performing as well as usually do, and easy to lose your head / get stressed out.  
Post Interview 
After the interview, Jayme and I talked for a little bit while the interviews finished uploading, and 
thanked her for taking the time to do the remote interview and signing and mailing the release form: 
since Jayme’s under 18, her parents have to sign it (though I indicated she can sign it as well on the 
side). 
As we were talking, it occurred to me that we never really got into, or expanded on talking about Jayme 
being a women racer in an occupation historically done mostly by men, in that it never really came up, 
asides from her mentioning that her mom sometimes teases the guys when she does better than them. 
Jayme shared that she does see more girls / women racing now wherever she goes to races.  
We record a little minute section discussion afterwards on that topic, with the intention of thinking of 
contributing it to the interview / record in post, but the more I thought about it after we had finished 
the interview and gone our separate ways, I decided since it didn’t come up organically / within the 
interview itself, that it doesn’t make sense to include the ‘addendum’ recording.  
Jayme herself had mentioned in the interview that she never really had thought of it that way either, so 
in order to make sure the interview really stuck to her voice and thoughts (including on that issue) 
relating to racing, I felt it best to leave the additional part we recorded out. If I were to include it, I felt 
that it would skew more towards tacking on a topic I thought was important, rather than one the 
interviewee felt was critical / important to sharing her knowledge on kart racing.
