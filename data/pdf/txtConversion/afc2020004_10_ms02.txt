[Denise Sweet reads “Palominos Near Tuba City”] 
 
Denise Sweet:  In order to talk about “Palominos Near Tuba City,” I have to reflect back on a 
time when I was traveling through the Southwest to teach Hope and Navajo students about 
creative writing, particularly poetry and drama, playwriting and so on. My first episode of that, 
those years of experience, began in Tuba City on my way to Greyhills Academy. It was in that 
journey that I pulled over on the road to stop at the Painted Desert, not only to stretch my legs 
but also to have sort of a first-hand experience with that geography: not only from the 
observation of the night sky and the beauty that that holds and that the constellations were 
shaping and forming themselves just for me that night, but also the desert floor, something that 
was so spectacular and so flamboyant in its design, something that I just had never seen before, 
having come from the Great Lakes region.  
 
At that moment, too, I remember thinking to myself, “Here’s a poem in my back pocket. I better 
remember every detail, every image, every metaphor that I could think of.” I needed to store 
that in my memory. And then, suddenly, across the vista I see a herd of horses, perhaps wild 
horses, that were sauntering towards me and then breaking into a trot, and then a gallop. Now, 
I know a little bit about horses, since I come from a horse family, but these are horses that are 
likely to be wild, and I didn’t know what to expect, and so I braced myself. And at that moment, 
too, I have to reflect upon the teachings of N. Scott Momaday and the poems and the prose 
poem that he wrote about horses. I sort of folded that into my thought pattern when I wrote 
this poem. “The horses of white lightning galloped toward me, afraid of nothing” was a phrase 
that Momaday used to describe horses. And even though I realize that they do have fears 
themselves, being raised around horses, they rush for an eye for hesitation. Any sort of body 
language that you transmit to them as you write them, they are acutely aware of how you feel. 
And so I wanted to join those ideas together in this poem, and I hope that I did a job of it that is 
appreciated by the reader.  
 
In that final moment and in that final stanza, I talk about the rider—the rider of horses and the 
rider of poems. The rider stands his ground and waits and she is ready to hold on for dear life, 
for that next poem, for that next experience, for that next journey that will take her away and 
into a new life and into a new landscape. That’s what I hope the rider can follow in this poem, 
“Palominos Near Tuba City.”
