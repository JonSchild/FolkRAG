Abstract: David Butcher farmed land in the area where his family has lived and farmed since the
1830s. He has been doing research on his family, as well as the community of Tablertown, and
runs a small history museum on his property.
David Butcher and his wife both work jobs outside of farming, and in the end they could not
afford the taxes the county kept raising on their land, and David had to sell much of his land and
stop farming.
David had a small diversified farm of good river-bottom land. He raised goats and sheep, and
was the only farmer I interviewed who created a farm-direct business relationship with African
immigrants in a nearby city, who he sold his products to.
David Butcher and his wife raised four children on their farm, and are both community leaders
who are justly proud of their heritage in the area. They are of African, German and Native
American descent.
