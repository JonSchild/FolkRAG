THE FROST
The frost looked forth vun still clear night, And whispered now I shall be out of sight; So
through the valley and ho-ver the heights, In si-lence I take my way.
Hi vill not go on like the blus-ter-ing train, The wind and snow-y hail and rain, Which makes
so much bustle and noise in vain, But I'll be as bu-sy as they.
'E flew to the win-dows of those who slept 'E lit on the trees and the boughs, 'E dressed in
dia-mind beads, And ho-ver the 'ills like a coat of mail 'e spread.
2
'E need not fear the down-ward point Of many a spear which hung on the mar-gin far and
near, Where a rock could rear its 'ead.
But 'e did one thing that was 'ardly fair, 'E peeked in the cupboard and found in there That
all 'ad for-got-ten for him to pre-pare.

Now just to set them a-thinking, I'll bite this basket of fruit, said 'e: This costly picture I'll
burst in three, And a glass of water they left for me, Shall Chick go tell I'm a-drinking? . . .
