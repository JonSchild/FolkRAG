1.   Thinking back, what are your very earliest memories of, or about, weaving?

Interviewee in English:   I knew how to make the warp.  When I think back, I learned 
warping first, then I learned to weave. I knew how to fix 
something when it broke.  But right now, it’s been a long time 
since I’ve woven. 
Interviewer in Ulithian:  
00:50 Iwe ngo yath la hola gula… hosa kai doh deur iyang ngo 
chil laloh ngangal fuyach? 
Interviewer in English: 
So, when you were learning how to weave, people were still 
weaving in the local style? 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
00:56 Yab, tor yengangal fulyach. Ima dedeur chog mol ka.  Ite 
ma dedeur mul fulyach bo itugla farol. 
 
Interviewee in English:   No, I wasn’t weaving with local fibers, only thread. I don’t know 
how to weave with local fibers. 
 
01:18 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why?

Interviewer in English: 
Who is the one person that you most associate with weaving, 
and why? 
 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
02:13 Irel mala ye reli mala mangai. Ngo ila yaramtala yetitipingi

yebe hayayali yei. 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
She married my brother. She was the one who taught me and 
helped me learn how to weave. She was the one who made 
me wear lavalava when I reached maturity.  I had to learn how 
to weave because I had to weave my own lavalava.  So, 
women must know how to weave lavalava. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian:  
02:24 Ngo yir mele rehayayalug? 
 
 
Interviewer in English: 
There were people who made you wear lavalava?

deur bo ila mala hapalech gich refuluka le gel semal fafel sew 
must le gel hobe gula farul deur. 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
Yes. They were people who made me wear lavalava.  I had to 
know how to weave because that is what we wore.  A woman 
must know how to weave. 
 
02:47 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you? 
A.   Ulithi: Mada mele dedeur ye kael yal palengpelal ngalug iyang? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
02:59 Paleng pelal ngal yei bo ikla meka ibe taptap, ibe yaya,

loch, irel makla hare rebe hafoi wolfului, ngo siffang irel chael 
metal semal le hare loch ro hawasui hare, iwe mo mes. 
 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
Weaving lavalava is important to me because that is what I 
wear. And, that is what I use to make peace if one of my kids 
has caused some disrespectful behavior in the community or 
has caused bloodshed, or if there is a death. 
 
03:32  Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you?

meka hapaler reindian hare meka howiri mo mengag ka. 04:21 
Bo gich le sew formel le ye hassorow mala dulol gow mo 
wululul yam be yaya. 
Interviewee in English: 
There have been big changes because lavalava is what the 
women wear and the colors, designs, and patterns are all a 
created in a certain way that is acceptable and respectful 
within the community environment.  At present, the young ones 
come up with all kinds of colors.  They use colors like they see 
used in India, or the colors they see from new shirts. The color 
of a lavalava and how you wear it must be respectful. 
  
04:31 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her? 
A.   Ulithian:  Hare wochog bo hobe malili ngal lol lom tarfefel irel deur, mada mele hobe 
kangalur hare hodipli hobe kangalur? 
Interviewee Ulithian: 
04:45 Idipli bo ibe kangalur wulullul farul gow mo wululul yayal 
gow bo rebegula bo sew formel le gel semal fafel hobe 
haskuna ngal lom bo towe mal le lom betogla farul bo ila mala 
gel hobe yaya, hobe taptap irel yodla hobble fafel iyang. 
 
 
Interviewee English: 
I would like to teach them how to weave lavalava, and how to 
wear lavalava because it’s respectful.  Each woman should 
teach her kids how to weave because it’s very important to 
know how to weave. A woman cannot go without knowing how 
to weave because that is what you will be wearing when you 
reach womanhood.
