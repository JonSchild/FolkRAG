Dear Bess:
 
Having just written you a business-type  letter,  I
 
thought I'd follow it with a more friendly one.
 
Mostly I wanted to send you the rest of  the transcripts
 
from our interviews. These were,  as you can see,  quite
 
a job in transcription,  but I did it to help with  the
 
programs on the Almanacs,  Pete,  and Woody.
 
Do you have a model release form. which I should
 
have people sign for broadcasting portions of their
 
interviews ? Could you sign one and return an extra ?
 
J
hereever possible I have tried to provide at least
 
partial transcripts,  and discuss if  there was any
 
material people wanted off  the record.  There is one
 
such statement in the enclosed pages.
 
Anyway,  I thought you'd want to keep these pages  to
 
pass on to your children and grand-children,  a bit
 
of  as yet unpublished history. Also find a bibliography
 
I thought you'd find interesting to keep in your files.
 
Best wishes  in  the new year,

race that in mid 1937 then,  or Christmas,  1937?
 
I don't think he was playing when I first met him,  or I don't
 
think he played -

 though he might have already st rted.  My husband
 
Pete.
 They were in third or fourth grade together.
 
J
:
 At Spring Hill?
 
ELH:
 Yes, at Spring Hill.  They belonged to the Ukulele Club there.
 
In point of fact, Pete gave my husband his first instrument.  He got
 
a better ukulele,  or a tenor banjo, or something like that,  and passed
 
his ukulele onto my husband Butch.
 They played together for quite
 
some time.
 At that time it was mostly pop and sing-along songs of

 Did you hear him play any music on that vacation?

 I don't think so.
 I don't remember it at least.
 He may have
 
already started, but I don't think he did it really seriously until
 
the following summer.
 
DD:  That would be mid 1938?
 
LH
 Yes, when he went on the road.
 I think that was it, you'll
 
have to check that out with Pete.
 I think that was the summer that
 
he took off and went on the road and met banjo pickers.
 He had
 
a
lready decided to learn by then.

inger on  the side of the record.
 
DD:
 That was when you first knew him, that he was very interested
 
in folk music?
 
BLH:
 I would say in late '
37, '38 he had already started.
 
DD:
 Do you recall any other features about him?  Can you give me a
 
physical description of how you remember him?
 
BLH:
 Tall, thin
 
DD:
 Boney?
 
BLH:
 Boney, yes.
 Big Adam's Apple.  Very blonde,  fair skinned, pink
 
cheeked.
 Very charming boy.
 He had a kind of tremendously youthful
 
enthusiasm about him.
 He really sparkled as somebody to be around.

He was not/all at that time moody -

 not saying that he was later -
-
his personality seemed very cheerful and open to me at that period.

 Did he seem young to you?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 Of course, I was younger (laughing).
 
DD:
 But you had already gone to college?

 Yes.

DD:
 
Pete was still,  at that time, playing constantly?
 
BL}{:
 Yes.
 Pretty constantly, not quite as interminably as before,
 
but he was working very hard at it.
 He was thinking about redoing
 
songs at that time.
 The first song idea that he told me about was
 
taking the "G r ound Hog" tune, slowing it down and making it into
 
"Jim Crow."
 He was talking about how tunes change their character
 
so tremendously if you alter their tempo and gave that as an example.
 
He said that he had decided to write a song using this and the refrain
 
line would be "Jim Crow."  He hadn't gotten any further with it at
 
that time.  He was clearly beginning to think about that kind of
 
creative development, musically speaking.
 
DD:
 Lee also had that kind of background didn't he?  From his work
 
in the South in Commonwealth College?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 In fact, Lee may have kicked Pete
 
know,  in terms of giving him that idea.
 As a
 
was -
-
 much more creative a musician than any
 
over into this.

song writer, Pete always
 
of the rest of the group
 
that later began adopting songs.  What Lee did, typically,  and what I
 
did and what Woody did in many respects was basically write parodies.
 
Woody's songs were not as parodish as Lee's and mine.  We had a ten-
dancy really to write parody,  but Woody would simply take an old tune.
 
Pete was always doing things with the tune,  or making up new bits or
 
changing them around in some fashion.  He was much more musically

inventive,  in fact was the musical spark plug for the whole group
 
when it eventually formed.
 
Later on that year, by the way,  I went down to New York and called
 
Pete up.
 I do not remember again where or when this was, but he
 
invited me to come over and help in the recording of their first
 
album --"John Doe."
 I sang in on the chorus.
 I didn't even know
 
the song.
 
DD:
 Which song?

or Conscription"
 or "I Hate War And
 So Does El 2
.nnr?"
 
BLH:
 That one I think.
 No,  "
'C'for Conscription" was a solo.
 I
 
was simply one of the voices in the pack.
 I never even heard the
 
songs before and didn't know that they were doing such a complicated
 
thing.
 
DD:
 Yesterday in the afternoon we were talking about two things
 
that I wanted to be sure and follow up.
 The first was the dialectic
 
that you suggested that the student movement was going through in the
 
mid 1930's with a basic tension between an interest in peace and an
 
to
 
abhorrence of war on one hand and the desire/fight fascism.
 I was
 
wondering if we could just briefly go over that.
 
BLH:  Well, I think you have to think of it in terms of the student

generation of the '
30's.
 Those people would have been born from
 
1910 to possibly 1915.
 
That is, they would not have had direct
 
experience with World War I.  They grew up immediately afterwards
 
into a world that was certainly horrified and  regretful of the
 
incredible destruction of World War I and which suffered from the
 
loss of so many young men and so on for years and years.
 But that
 
generation had not had direct experience with World War I or the
 
horrors of war, they just sort of heard about it from their parents.
 
So there was a very strong anti-war feeling,  but,  it was more remote
 
I think f
or most people.
 A kind of vague notion that there must be
 
some other way of handling it.
 I remember as a teenager talking to
 
a member of my older sister's generation who had -
-
 he was perhaps
 
20 years
 
,
sl
 
than
 
T
 
He had been a sergeant in World War I and
 
he was very cynical about my anti-war feelings, saying,  "You weren't
 
around at the time, you don't know what the problems were, you don't
 
know how bad it was, how difficult it was to settle without the War.
 
You have to have that experience before you really can commit your-
self to being either pro-war or anti-war in any set of circumstances."
 
I thought he was being very naive at the time and told him so and he
 
thought I was being very naive at the time and he told me so.
 
In any event, I think the anti-war feeling,  which was extremely deep,
 
was not informed with the kind of experience of having been through
 
it, that say the present anti-war generation is.
 Where you see every
 
night on the television the bodies and you read the body count in
 
the paper and you yourself are possibly going to be involved.
 It
 
was
 
more remote and more intellectual.

The literature of the period,John Dos Passos was extremely important
 
and informative, those series of books that he wrote on social con-

 let's see, I was born in 1921,  I was about 7 or 8 . it
 
was right after the crash, and the beginnings of the depression.
 i
 
remember my father coming in from the pit and sitting down at the
 
table and saying to my mother,  "I don't know what the country is
 
com
ing  to. ,
, 
it was a car trip across Texas.
 He said, "Every train
 
I went by was black with men hanging on, to the top,  to the sides,
 
to anywhere they could get.
 And the railroad police aren't even
 
trying to chase them off anymore.  There's too many of them.
 I
 
don't know where they are going and I don't think they know where
 
they are going either.  They are just looking for some place where
 
they can find a job.
 If it's this way all over the country, how
 
are we going to handle it?"
 It was an extremely impressive moment
 
for me.
 
DD:
 In thinking about the split that you suggested -
-
 I wonder why
 
it wasn't that there were individuals who were consistent in one
 
position or the other.  Rather than having groups and individuals
 
within groups moving .

ELH:( Seeger took a pacifist position and maintained it right through
 
World War II.  He was a Conscientous Objector, I forget what he wound
 
up doing, some sort of alternative service, because he maintained a
 
Pacifist position exactly all the way through.

Those were serious moments.
 I think for almost everyone they were
 
serious moments.
 I think that's why there were so many attempts -
-
and goodness knows it was going on all over the world -
-
 there were
 
a lot of complex attempts to find some sort of solution to the proh1e:-
other than going to War.
 I suspect that some of those were quite
 
viable if we'd been able to muster enough support.
 I think collective
 
security probably could have worked.
 I think boycotting Japan could
 
have worked.

 that maybe they were right all along.
 I mean that there
 
really was a phoney war and that in many ways the position which was
 
a kind of extreme sectarian position taken between '
39 and '
L
IO was
 
not that inaccurate,
 in terms of the forces and why the war existed
 
in the first place.
 
BLH:  That makes a good deal of sense to me.
 It may very well have
 
been yet another of the many maneuvers to avoid a major world conflict.
 
To  have a pretend war and which would give time for the kinds
 
'f negotiations to take place that might have produced a world in
 
which we could have stood to live (laughing).
 Nobody was asking for
 
protection (laughing).

BLJ{:
 Right.  Again, I
'm not quite sure when that was.
 I think that
 
it was during the period when I was in Washington.
 It might have
 
been the year before because I did make several trips from Texas up
 
to Washington and New York at that time.
 So it was somewhere in '
38,
 
'
39.  No wait a minute,  p
37, '
38 or maybe '
39.  She was,  as you know,
 
a Kentucky coal miner's wife.
 She had come up-to New York to get on
 
relief,  as did an awful lot of people at that period.
 Relief in Ken-
tucky was almost non-existant.
 She was an elderly lady at the time,
 
really couldn't support herself.
 She had married her second,  or
 
possibly her third husband who was a Greek cook, chef by profession,
 
and he was out of work and he was on relief.  They had an apartment
 
in the lower East Side somewhere.
 
DD:
 Was she in good health?
 
BLH:
 Not very.
 She was an awfully tough old lady (laughing).
 I
 
think maybe she could have worked,  it's possible, but she never did
 
during the period that I knew her.
 She was certainly beyond normal
 
retirement age.
 I don't. recall her being ill or feeble.
 She was a
 
very dynamic woman.
 Of course her stories and her songs fit right in
 
to the whole Lafollette report.
 In fact she was -
-
 I think she was
 
one of the people who testified if I'm not mistaken,  or some of her
 
family at least.
 She was an extremely impressive figure.
 
DD:  How had you heard of her?
 
BLH
 Through Alan and through Mary Elizabeth Barnacle who was a
 
folklorist at New York City.
 She had been pretty well collected.

Alan, I think, recorded her in Kentucky.  They went back to see her
 
,
,
hen she got up to New York and recorded in her apartment quite a
 
number of times; her life history, her reminiscences, plus her songs.
 
She was still composing at that time.
 I went and sat in on a number
 
,
f those sessions.
 (Pause)
 I was trying to remember if Pete knew
 
Aunt Molly particularly well or not.
 I don't recall his being there.
 
DD:
 He got to New York in the Spring of 1938 after leaving Harvard
 
and he spent  a few months there before he took that trip -
-
 he
 
spent the summ er travelling around on hi .s bicycle painting, I under-
stand?  I don't know whether he knew Aunt Molly then, or whether he
 
met her the second time around when he came back in 1939.
 
BLH:
 I think it was probably more the second time around.
 I
'm sure
 
that it was in part from her, plus the various other members of her
 
family.
 Her nephew whose name is Jim Garland was also there.
 Jim
 
Garland had developed the eye disease that comes from malnutrition
 
in part and was never cared for, he's almost blind now and he was
 
pretty well blind then.
 
DD:
 Was he playing guitar?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 He had composed quite a number of songs by that period.
 
DD:
 
"I Don't Want Your Millions Mister?"
 
BLH:
 Right.
 Aunt Molly sang that and Pete learned it from her and
 
3 0 on.

good songs coming out
 
Jim were in the fore-
DD:
 How much were the songs that they were singing based on what
 
they recognized as traditional old time tunes?
 
BLH:
 Almost all of them were based,  I don't know whether they recog-
nized it or not.
 The process of song composition varies, it seems
 
to me, from your taking an already existed song and twisting it so
 
that when you hear it, you sort of half way think of the other song
 
to begin with.
 You're doing sort of a play on the original song.
 
Which is what I think parody is.  But there is a whole other process
 
involved in which you start to write a song which you are using the
 
melodic formula that's in the back of your head, that this is the
 
way a song is, and you start writing words for it.  Afterwards you
 
come out with a song -
-
 and I frequently did this with Lee -
-
 told
 
him the name of the tune that he had used.
 He was never conscious
 
of having used it.
 He was always surprised.
 He had simply started
 
from a tune, but not a tune with words that he was playing on.
 
That process I think is far more common on the folk level.
 Pete,  on
 
quite
 
the other hand, very deliberately selected tunes and was/aware of
 
the tunes that he was working from because he is much more of a
 
musician.  Woody was a words man.  Aunt Molly thought about the
 
text, that's what she was interested in.  When she wrote a song,  it
 
was in effect writing a poem.

DD:
 
With oral phrasings?
 
BLH:
 Right,  she would never say it as a poem, she would always sing
 
it.  But the part that she was writing were the words and she sort of
 
put them to the rhythm structure that she had in the back of her head
 
to some sort of an old tune that was k
nocking around in there.
 She
 
could sometimes identify it, but sometimes not.
 But I think that's
 
a very common process of folk composition.
 
DD:
 Alan, I understand, pretty early on developed a sensitivity for
 
progressive political causes.
 I talked to one person who knew both
 
John and Alan at Harvard and said even then.in the mid 193O's he was
 
working in that vein.
 How did that come about?  I gather

BLH:
 Father was a political conservative, but a social radical
 
(laughing).
 He would have given me the back of the hand if I ever
 
said such a thing (laughing).
 In fact, I doubt if I would have even
 
thought of it at the time.
 But, thinking back on him, he came out of
 
a very much earlier period,  a sort of grass roots progressive movement
 
that, particularly through the midwest and the southwest was the
 
earlier Lafollette
 period that informed him.  He was very very deeply
 
concerned about the voice of the common people and that's why he
 
collected folk songs.
 He felt everybody should get into the demo-
cratic act.
 I remember every election day when I was a child,  father
 
would go around in the car and pick up all of the black people that
 
worked in the houses around where we lived and any other blacks that
 
he knew.
 Of course at the time you said negro,  or colored.

them down and paid their poll tax and marched them in to vote.
 It
 
was a very paternalistic action from the point of view of contemporary
 
times and I think they all thought it was kind of funny because they
 
all knew there wasn't anybody to vote for anyway.  (laughing).  But
 
he was going to be damned sure that everybody voted.
 
At the same time, he had equally strong convictions that government
 
shouldn't mess around in people's lives.
 People should be in charge
 
of the government and the government should do it  chores and not
 
take over.
 He was very much opposed to governmental interference of
 
any variety.

 Alan was certainly steeped in folk music very early.
 As you
 
say, he was a large influence on Pete.
 Did he make that connection
 
that Aunt Molly and Jim Garland made out of their own experience?
 
That is to say writing in their own folk terms, a political statement
 
and song?
 
BLH:
 You mean,  did he do that himself?
 
DD
 
Did he see that as a desirable goal, a way of meshing his poli-
tics with his interest in folk song?  Back in the mid '30's, before
 
the Almanacs?
 
and a writer?
 
Or were they separate?  Was he a folk song collector

traditional communities.
 
DD:
 I
'm interested in exploring this because I think its certainly
 
important in considering the roots of the Almanacs.  When Jim Garland
 
took, "Green Back Dollar" and kept the same tune and same rhythm and
 
simply para phrased the words and the tune is so simple.
 I
'm sure
 
you saw the similarity there.  when he did that and Pete did a simi-
lar type of operation with "Jim Crow" as you mentioned yesterday.
 
There is a difference between the two processes.  When you were
 
thinking about doing "Jim Crow" or writing your own "Ruben James,"
 
wasn't there,  even in the beginning, a consciousness that others had
 
done that before you?
 
BLH:
 Oh yes, sure.  We were basing our song composition on the
 
process, as we understood it, that occurred with Jim and Aunt Molly
 
and people of that kind.  We also, by the way, sang their songs quite
 
a lot.
 I
'm suggesting that the process actually was different,  although
 
we didn't think it was at the time I suspect.
 
DD:
 Because of your city roots and the diversity of the sources
 
that you took?
 
BLH:
 Right.
 Plus, I don't know, it seems to me there is something
 
a little bit different there.  There would be a tendency in the
 
Almanacs to say, "We ought to have a song about this."
 Then some-
body would sort of mull over that for a while;  somebody else would
 
come up with a couple of ideas and somebody would say,  "That's a good

one," and somebody else would work on  it.
 I don't exactly think
 
that Jim Garland thought there ought to be a song about this (laughing).
 
DD:
 I know that Aunt Molly was very much associated with the Commu-
nist organizing movements in the south, the NMU and the 010.
 I
 
understand from Archie that it was only very late in the history of
 
that particular song that she joined the CIO.
 Before during the
 
dual trade union period it was joining the NNU.  To a certain ex-
tent there must have been,  "Why don't we have a good old song for
 
the NNIJ that we could sing in the meetings."
 
BLH:
 There may have been.

BLH:  Well, I didn't ask that question
', Alan may be able
, to tell
 
you that.
 I was never there when she was discussing that,  it was
 
always sort of, "This terrible thing happened, so I wrote this song."
 
That's the kind of thing I remember her saying, rather than,  "I wrote
 
a song for a particular situation."
 Now,  she may have done that.
 
The Almanacs however, were very conscious of the need for
 particular
 
songs for particular occasions, the need for songs in reaction to
 
news events, some of which were very remote from us.
 It always
 
eemed to me that Aunt Molly's songs were
 
personal experiences at first hand.  Even

 To go back again to the roots
 were you conscious at all of

 Who introduced that kind of song?  Whose main interest was that

 I think it was Lee.  Woody knew a couple of them, he had picked
 
a couple of them up.  They were sort of his style songs.  They are
 
really a little bit more western than southern in style, but I think
 
Lee knew some of them from his earlier organizing days and ministerial
 
days.  Lee's best repertoire were sort of hymns, religous songs, but
 
he knew some of those.

worker.
 Because these were not musically sophisticated songs.
 He
 
probably did and Michael responded to that.
 Did you know anything
 
about a group called the Composer's Collective then?
 
BLH:
 I had heard of it I think through one of the left magazines of
 
the period, New Masses or maybe The Daily Worker or something, which
 
I saw reasonably regularly and I had heard about it.  There was a
 
journal they put out wasn't there?
 
DD:  There were two songs books they put out and maybe you...
 The
 
Worker's Song Book, Volume I and Volume II.

 Pete, I think, had those,  or perhaps I saw them
 
at Charlie's and Ruth's.  Charlie,  of course, had written some rather
 
sophisticated songs for...

 Rounds.

 "The Rounds,"
 yes.
 He was also in touch with some of the
 
European composers who were working, Eisler  and so on.
 I don't

 He
 
sang some of those and Ruth sang some of those,  just around the house

BLH:
 I learned some of them.
 Never sang them very much,  occasionally
 
but not often.
 They seemed to me too European,  or too intellectual,
 
or something.  They never spoke to me very deeply.
 I didn't think
 
that they were that interesting for American audiences.
 I thought
 
they were high toned, I guess.
 I
'm not sure I ever really thought
 
about it in much detail, but I remember not singing them (laughing).
 
Knowing them but not singing them.

 Was your contact limited to the ones like, "J.P. Morgan Didn't
 
Pay His Income Tax, Pity Poor Morgan," or "Schwab, Schwab, Charlie
 
Schwab, Life And Happiness?"  Were those the ones you were talking
 
about, or the more elaborate ones?

 professional recording equipment, I was used to the kind

 As I remember, we mostly sang the "1 Hate War Song"
 
and there was one other, but I don't remember.  Was there some sort
 
of a train song on that one?  Some sort of large group song.
 I later
 
heard Pete sing...
 I believe Pete recorded "The Ballad Of John Doe"

at that time, at that particular session.
 But that was a solo and
 
we were just sitting around listening.
 
DD:
 What was your reaction to hearing Pete do this?  Did you have
 
a feeling,  "Here's someone who's obviously getting better on the
 
banjo?"
 
26
 
BLH:
 Well, he  as turning into a very good musician at that point.
 
His instrumental skills had developed enormously.  His voice was still
 
rather frail,  but it was enormously moving, he was turning into a
 
singer and he was using it very well.
 I think Pete's voice really
 
only- developed after the war.  Maybe It was something to do with
 
simply physically maturing.
 But when he came back from the Army
 
many years later, having been in World War II, he was

as a singer, his voice had really grown up to the size of the musi-
cian within him.
 
during
 
I think/the John Doe period he was becoming a good singer and an
 
experienced singer, but he did not have the power that he developed
 
later.
 
DD:
 But that's quite a change from your discussion five or six
 
months before when he was barely maintaining himself on the CBS
 
program.  What happened in the interim?

DD:
 He performed in public perhaps?
 
BLH:
 Maybe that was part of it.  Maybe the experience itself on
 
radio was good for him.
 He worked all the time.
 I think even that
 
CBS period they weren't so much worried about his instrument as they
 
were about his voice and the fact that he had had relatively little
 
experience, so it was a little chancey.
 Radio those days was live,
 
and you know they went like that (indicating) and you were supposed
 
to produce instantly (laughing).  There was a slight professionalism
 
that Pete lacked at that time,  from just not having had the experience
 
of being able to turn on on the instant demand.
 I suspect that was
 
more it.
 
As I remember, he was playing pretty well for the previous year.
 I
 
think the Almanac association also was extremely important to Pete's
 
development.'  He learned a lot from Lee.
 He sort of had begun to
 
come into his own.
 He had matured to the point where he could do
 
what he thought in his head pretty quickly.
 He had heard enough by
 
then.
 Lee's repertoire I think was very crucial for him and Lee's
 
singing style.
 He had heard enough and had enough technical skill
 
so that he could do what he conceived of.

 To go back to the scene in the recording studio, were these first

fell down (laughing)  or the mike fell over,  or somebody forgot the
 
words.
 
DD:
 What was the feeling surrounding it?  Was it enthusiasm?
 
BLH:
 Very.  Very enthusiastic.
 It was very exciting and everybody
 
was very stimulated by the whole experience and by this new material.
 
I think the songs were pretty much new for everybody concerned,  ex-
cept Pete and Mill and Lee and the other Pete.  That's my impression.
 
I suppose some of the people there had heard them before.
 But it was
 
Very exciting and it was very...
 I think there was also a feeling
 
of stimulation at how daring it was as an enterprise.

 Well, those were very tough songs,  extremely tough.
 I think
 
tougher than anything the Almanacs ever wrote after that, almost.
 
The most outspoken, the most kind of thumb to the nose.
 They weren't
 
very persuasive, they were more kind of come and get me, defiant.
 
DD:
 Did you feel at all funny singing songs about FDR who would
 
have probably been, to a certain extent, the hero of your generation?
 
BLH:
 Yes, as a matter of fact, that song always kind of bothered me,
 
at the same time I like to sing it.
 I think it was the song that
 
most people felt the most ambivalent about.  But it was so extremely
 
catchy.  The "I Hate War And So Does Eleanor" phrase was a stroke of
 
song writing genius.

outspoken, how would he present them?  With great earnestness?

BLH:
 Exactly.
 He presented them with great earnestness.  Well, that
 
one was funny and everybody always laughed about it.
 Peter was
 
totally sincere and totally dedicated at all times, he never did any-
thing in his life I don't think that he didn't mean to do.
 He was a
 
very thoughtful guy and completely concerned about what he was doing.
 
He was concerned about the impact of it and whether or not it was the
 
right thing to do.
 He was a worrier in that sense.
 He was also ex-
tremely brilliant.
 
DD:
 Were you conscious  of this?
 
BLH:
 Imaginative.
 I would say he was the creative spark of the
 
group. -He was always the one with the outrageous idea.
 The inter-
esting new notion of doing this or doing that.
 He sparked all the
 
time, musically and intellectually.
 
DD:
 In a throwing out ideas fashion,  or in a

BLH:
 Yes.  The Almanac process was to throw things around a lot.
 
Everybody was encouraged to sort of spit out anything that occurred
 
to them that would be an interesting thing to do or an important
 
subject to write, or something that there ought to be a song about.
 
Then how would you go about doing it would also be kicked around.
 
Occassionally people would volunteer to work on an idea,  or occassionall

it would just be dropped and then two days later somebody would come
 
up and say,  "I figured up a couple verses for that song" and sing
 
them and then there would be a lot of discussion about whether it
 
should be that way or this way.

 To take a step back here in chronology, before we actually get

gentle.

of the country.

 Was he accessable?

 Socially speaking, yes.  When I got to know him better later,

much older than I was as he acted.

BLH:
 He sort of slotted in to me.  This was a period during which
 
kinds of
 
I knew a lot of people who had done various/organizing work in the
 
south.
 1 had already met Miles and Zilphia Horton and Don West and
 
people like that who were doing the same general kind of work that
 
Lee had been doing in the south.
 I was kind of impressed that he
 
had been a preacher I remember.
 His voice was fine, he was an
 
excellent singer.
 
DD:
 Did he have any mannerisms of the preacher?
 
BLH:
 Only when .
he sang.
 
DD:
 He was not a reverent...
 
BLH:
 No.
 No way.
 No, he was just a nice guy.  Very much of that
 
general common stripe of the people I just named.
 I remember liking
 
him and thinking that it was interesting that Pete had tied up with him.
 
Mill was a little bit more of a character to me ; 
he was diff-
erent from the kind of people I had known very well before him.
 He
 
was sort of a sharp, slick, young New Yorker type and he seemed
 
the oddball
 in the group at the time.

 He was living with Lee and Pete

 type.  He didn't seem

and southern and slow, comfortable going.
 
DD:
 Pete at that time was wearing dungarees or blue jeans or...
 
BLH:
 I imagine.
 Or corduroys.
 
DD:
 And Lee the same?
 
BLH:
 Yes,  and work shirts.
 
DD:
 Sort of the proletarian dress perhaps you can call it?
 
BLH:
 Right.
 And Mill was sports jacket and coat and tie and...
 
DD:
 How did they coexist, being literally in the same space,  of
 
the same age?

BLH:
 (laughing).
 It was a little tense.
 In fact, Lee moved
 
out at one point and got his own apartment.
 He was very much inter-
ested in girls for one thing and  it's  a little difficult to have
 
many many romances with three guys living in the same room (laughing).
 
Mill
 kind of played  with the proleteriat
 you see, and
 
enjoyed identifying, but whenever he put on work shirts and jeans
 
he always looked like he was dressed up for the occasion (laughing).
 
Didn't fit him as well.
 I think there was a good bit of tension
 
there and as a point in fact, Mill  got his own
 
apartment after a while.  Then he sort of dropped away from the group.

Then he began doing...
 
DD:
 That was later on?
 
BLH:
 Yes, that's later on.
 He was one of the earlier drops however.
 
DD:
 He was living with Alan Sloane?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 I think at that time he moved in with Alan Sloane when
 
he moved out from the Almanacs, I forgot about that.
 Alan was, again,
 
much the same sort of person, much more compatible to Mill's style.
 
DD:
 Was Alan at that first "John Doe?"
 
BLH:
 I don't know, he could have been.
 He sang with us occasionally
 
but was never a real member  of the group, as I recall.
 
DD:
 Was Mill a singer?  How did he belong there with one dedicated
 
singer and one dedicated musician?
 
BLH:
 He sang, he was never a good singer.
 He never sang important
 
leads.  He sang in choruses and he sang in the improvisational songs
 
that we used like a Leadbelly song,  "Bottle Up and Go."  We had a
 
few songs like that where we made up verses as we went along to suit
 
the occassion.  That was very much Mill's style, he did that kind of
 
thing awfully well.
 He was a fast-thinking rhymster.  He and Woody
 
used to get into terrible arguments.
 They were completely opposite

in style.  Mill was,  I think,  attracted to the group because of its
 
political position.
 And because he saw this as a very viable way of
 
getting,a political message across and he thought the tunes were good
 
and things like that.
 He enjoyed making up songs.
 He was a good man
 
with a lyric.
 But, his style was -
-
 to use a term from the period,
 
which sounds very old fashioned now -
-
 he was really agit-prop. His
 
contributions were very much in the line of
 political slogans.
 
He was a good sloganeer.
 
Woody disliked that very much.
 He regarded those songs as eminently
 
forgettable, which I think he was right about, ultimately.
 Although
 
Mill added a lot to the group at that period, he was very important
 
to the group.
 
DD:
 Mill, I gather,was Jewish and
 a product of that long time
 
tradition of Jewish radicalism.
 And yet  neither you nor Pete nor
 
Lee had that kind of background.
 
BLH:
 Right.
 I think it was a function of the alliances that were
 
joined between students at that period.
 Certainly there were a lot
 
of different kinds of people in the student movement and in the
 
various youth movements.
 And a lot of them were led by people of
 
Mill's cultural and social and intellectual background.
 So it's very
 
logical to have somebody like that in such a group.
 I think
 
it may have represented for Mill, an attempt to get away from his
 
heritage.

BLH:
 Yes.
 I don't know for sure,  at all.
 You'll have to ask him
 
about it, but I think that that was one of the things that was maybe
 
going on.  There were a lot of people who occasionally  sang with
 
the group who were Jewish or Central European.  The youngsters.
 
DD:
 Like who?
 
BLH:
 There was a young woman,  I remember we had a lot of arguments
 
with her because she had a very very strong Bronx accent (laughing).
 
And it kind of stuck out in the group and this was discussed a couple
 
of times and she maintained very passionately that it was her accent
 
and she was damned if she was going to start talking southern (laughing).
 
Nobody quite knew how to handle that one.
 
DD:
 That wasn't Ruth Rubin? (Jean Rogovin)
 
BLH:
 I don't think it was.
 Pete might remember her name,  I remember
 
what she looked like.
 She had a good strong voice and that was part
 
of the problem, she never could blend.
 Her singing style was really
 
very kind of Polish, she had a big blarey voice and sang very loudly
 
as Poles always do.  They sing  the loudest of anybody in the world
 
practically.  With this extremely urban accent, it really presented
 
a very odd total effect when she was,  say, backing Woody.  (laughing).
 
It never kind of worked together, but at the same time nobody really
 
wanted her to not talk the way she wanted to talk (laughing).  We
 
never did lick that problem.

BLH:
 Right.
 
DD:
 When did you next come in contact with the Almanacs?
 
BLH:
 Off and on for the next two years.
 The summers in that
 
period  I spent
 counselling at a camp for children in
 
north Michigan.
 I was there for the two summers that I was in college
 
in Bryn Mawr; in between times I went home to Texas, when the camp
 
wasn't in session.
 
I
 would go to see Pete, Lee and
 
Mill when I drove down to New York on the weekends during the academic
 
year.
 I graduated in 1941 and went to New York to look for a job.  My
 
father was very mad about this, he wanted me to go to graduate school
 
but I was fed up with school at the time and decided to try my way
 
into New York.
 
I suspect through Alan or Charlie,  or maybe both,  I got a job working
 
for Carlton Sprague Smith.
 Can ton was conducting a program for
 
elementary school children called the School of the Air, which was
 
broadcast nationwide by CBS at that period.
 
DD:
 Alan was working on that wasn't he?
 
BLH:
 He worked on it at an earlier period.
 I think Carlton Sprague
 
Smith took over from him when he decided to do something else.
 Dr.
 
Smith had a secretary for each of the functions and I was the one for
 
the School of the Air.
 Ran around and found singers for him and got
 
repertoire together and helped him pick out songs and so on.
 I remem-
ber my salary was $25 a week which you could live on in New York at
 
that time.
 Not very elegantly, but you could.
 I got a very small

apartment,  it was really one horrible little room with a bath.
 I wa
 
working away there and then I began singing
 with the Almanacs in the
 
evenings and on the weekends that was the time that I joined the group
 
officially.
 
DD:
 Okay.
 Then when you first joined the group they had just come
 
back from their nationwide tour with the CIO?  The summer of '41.
 
Were they living in the Almanac house?
 
BLH:
 Yes.

began singing with them regularly and going down to the house for
 
an evening and for meetings and such and also for the weekend per-
formances.  As you remember, the Almanac house was an apartment.
 
No, wait a minute, no, the first Almanac house waz a house-house,
 
with an upstairs and a downstairs.
 
DD:
 The Almanac house on 6th Avenue and 10th Street?
 
BLH:
 Yes, I believe so.
 I remember one night I had to go home late
 
and Pete Hawes gallantly took me home and insisted on going in to see
 
my room which I didn't want to show him because it was very ratty.
 
He came out and said,  "You really shouldn't be living here Bess,  it's
 
a dangerous neighborhood and I
'm worried about you:'  (tape ended).

BLH:
 I thought about it and decided to do it because I was spending
 
all my time going back and forth.
 It was hard on  he budget with
 
the subway fares and it also wasn't very much fun (laughing).
 
DD:
 You left the good stuff behind.
 Could you describe that Almanac
 
house, how it was laid out from top to bottom?
 
BLH:
 It was a mess (laughing).
 It was
, a terrible mess (laughing).
 
I thought a lot before deciding to move into it.
 There was a living
 
room and it had very very ratty furniture throughout.
 There was a
 
living room and when you came in,  it went up some steps, sort of
 
New York brownstone type  came into a hall,  on your left was the
 
living room which had some old junky furniture in it -
-
 a couple of
 
couches and a couple of broken down easy chairs and so on -
-
 you went
 
from there directly to the back of the house.  There was a dining
 
room with a big dining room table in it and sort of kitchen chairs.
 
Behind that was the kitchen.
 The hail where you first came in, you
 
could go to your left and go into the living room or you could go
 
down to the end of it and it went into the kitchen.  The kitchen was
 
small,  inconvenient and dirty.
 On your right as you come in you
 
could go up the stairs and on the stairs up top there was a front
 
bedroom and a middle bedroom and as I recall, a back bedroom.
 And
 
then there was another room, I think, on the third floor.  There was
 
a third floor and that's where Woody was.
 
DD:
 Sort of an attic?
 
BLH:
 Kind of an attic room.
 It was pretty crowded when I was in

there.
 Lee had the middle bedroom with a double bed.  Lee was always
 
ailing.
 I don't know if anyone has talked to you about this but Lee
 
may have had emphysema, I don't know.  He was a wheezey man and coughed
 
a lot.
 He was continually becoming ill at moments of crisis.  Typi-
cally  before we went out on a booking. Especial ly if it was a hard
 
night,  it was very irritating.
 
I remember one scene where Lee was lying on his double bed and an-
-
:
 
nounced that he was prostrate  and
 unable to make the bookings
 
that evening.  He very dramatically let his right arm fall off the
 
edge of the bed in total exhaustion (laughing).
 Pete pulled his
 
recorder out of his pocket and stood at attention at the foot of the
 
bed and played taps (laughing)  over his recumbent form, it was terri-
bly funny seeing it (laughing).  Lee was lying there trying not to
 
be mad because if he had gotten mad  then he was clearly strong
 
enough to manage to stagger out to the bookings.
 
DD:
 Did Pete get mad for that?
 
BLH:
 Well, he was kidding him.  Eventually Lee got pretty impossible.
 
He had many personal problems.  This was beginning to boil up when I
 
first moved into the house.
 
DD:
 Right.
 Lee was only there for a couple of months I believe
 
after you moved in.
 
BLI
-I:
 Right.
 I was never totally clear as to what those problems
 
were.
 They were manifested, as I say,  in these illnesses that he

had -

 which may have been real.  They never seemed to be real, he
 
was not a very good actor in that sense,  but he may have been more
 
ill than we realized.
 He certainly was more unhappy than we realized,
 
and manifested this with
 disruptive
 behavior.
 I did not wit-
ness too much of it but Pete was already upset about it when I moved
 
in.
 He felt that Lee was pitting people against each other in the
 
group.
 
Lee would get me off from time to time and give me long serious talks
 
about the problems and the group.
 I don't recall ever thinking that
 
they were very serious.
 
DD:
 What types of problems would he address?  Musical?  Political?
 
BLH:
 Personal.
 
DD:
 Oh, personal.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 The group was not divided politically at that time at all.
 
It was a strange combo, I must say.
 Woody was living up on the third
 
floor in relative isolation, playing records on his own little record
 
player that he had upstairs.
 He had about 8 records that he listened
 
to absolutely continuously.
 You would hear him pick up the needle
 
and start it all over again and when it got to the end, he would pick
 
up the needle and play it all over again.
 He would play it possibly
 
150 times (laughing).
 
DD:
 
What records?

BLH:
 The Southern"Casey Jones" was one of his favorites, sung by
 
a black guy that played the piano.
 I cannot think of his name at
 
the moment.
 Pete would remember.
 It is a hell of a fine recording.
 
There was one verse in it which ended up,  "You got another pappy on
 
that same damn track,  on that same track."  Woody would play that
 
particular line"on that same track" over and over and over again.
 
I remember his saying if he could ever get that tone. - 
it was a quality of penetration in the voice at the same time the
 
guy had a lot of rasp and huskyness in his voice and it was a beauti-
fully given line.  Woody would come down the stairs singing,  "on that
 
same track" trying to get it, over and over and over again.
 
Some Carter family recordings.
 Some J
.E. Mainer recordings.
 
He was working,
 he wasn't amusing himself, he was
 
studying singing.
 He thought more about singing than anybody else
 
in the group.
 He worked on that and it kept him isolated a lot and
 
then he would come downstairs at night and put the typewriter on the
 
sit there and
 
dining room table and/dri
.nk coffee and write all night long.
 You'd
 
come down in the morning and he would be asleep over the typewriter
 
and the floor was covered with sheets of typewriter paper -written on.

ID:
 It sounds very romantic, but it must have been very difficult
 
to live with, you had to eat breakfast on the same table.
 
BLH:
 (laughing).
 Yes,  it was a bizzare household in the extreme.
 
With Lee being passed out upstairs and Woody working his own particu-
lar way, totally individualistically.
 Pete Hawes, who lived in the
 
back bedroom,  a rather elegant figure, Bostonian elegance, upper
 
class elegance -
-
 he relatively lived to himself.
 He had two Siamese

cats at the time and Siamese as you know,  scream.
 Woody referred to
 
both of them as "sexy", that was his name for them.
 He said that
 
Pete should release them, in fact, threatened to throw them out of
 
the house and Pete,  of course, had bred them very carefully, this
 
was one of his hobbies at the time -
-
 constantly getting into battles
 
with Woody over that issue.  Woody would threaten to open the window
 
and let the cats out.
 It was a very strange household.
 
Meanwhile, Pete and I
 shared the front bedroom in perfect sobri-
ety and isolation and being very careful to not impinge on each other
 
and be private from each other.
 
DD:  Wasn't that difficulty
 
BLH:
 Yes, it was (laughing).
 As I say,  a very bizzare household,
 
but exciting to be in at the same time.
 There was a tremendous
 
amount going on.
 There was always somebody to talk to about some-
thing interesting.
 It was only the physical details of life that
 
were almost impossible.  We were young and it didn't matter that
 
much.
 Plus  I was working,  I was the one who got up every morning
 
and went forth to a job and came home about six.
 So, I was gone
 
a lot of the time.
 If I had really been there the whole time like
 
the rest of the guys,  I probably couldn't have stood it.  They were
 
rubbing on each other all the time and I was out on my job.
 
DD:
 Did you find any contradiction in your being the only one of
 
this working class group of singers who was working?

out some money and bought them.
 Nobody argued about that.
 
DD:
 Of course, you didn't have any place to change into the clothes.
 
BLH:
 (laughing).
 Pete and I rigged up a curtain (laughing).
 I
 
don't think I ever talked to anybody,  even my own kids, about this
 
as odd
 
whole period of life, matter of fact.
 It didn't seem/at the time as
 
it does thinking about it now.  The group was very much focused on
 
the
 
what they were doing and the idea of/living arrangements was to make
 
it possible for you to do it more than anything else.
 It was really
 
set up for that.  We rehearsed,  or wrote songs or practiced,  or what-
ever needed to be done every evening.
 
DD:
 You had a specific tirri ?
 
BLH:
 No,  it just went on all the time.  We'd call rehearsals if we
 
thought we needed them for a new song.
 But, it was really set up to
 
bring people together in a productive, working relationship to produce
 
new songs and to learn new songs.  We had a record player downstairs
 
and we used it all the time.
 People were bringing in recordings all
 
the time.
 
DD:
 What types of recordings?
 
BLH:
 Mostly folk recordings.  This was a period when the regular
 
recording companies, Bluebird and Decca and so on were putting out
 
excellent
 
tremendous numbers of/recordings.

 The Race series?
 
BLH:
 The Race series  and  the Hillbilly series,
 I forget what
 
they called them at the time.
 Carter family recordings were avail-
able in New York and so were all kinds of great blues performances
 
and we worked from those a lot.
 
DD:
 Who were your folk idols?  I mean, -the people that were the
 
favorite artists that would get played the most?
 
BLH:
 I think probably Carter Family were the ones I remember hearing
 
the most, and the Mainer recordings.
 
DD:
 With the Mountaineers?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 
DD:
 "Maple on The Hill" and "Lights In the Valley?"
 
BLH:
 Yes, and the fiddle tunes.
 We worked a lot from fiddle tunes
 
actually.
 Pete was learning them on the banjo, nobody was playing
 
fiddle but Pete was playing them on the banjo and Woody on the mandolin.
 
Woody,  I think, was really developing his mandolin style at that time
 
so that sort of beginning early bluegrass stuff was very interesting
 
to us.

 You listened to Bill Monroe and Charlie?

BLH:
 Yes.  Woody was writing absolutely constantly during that period
 
and we were all working with Woody.
 
DD:
 This was Bound For Glory?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 He was doing the Bound For Glory material, which as you
 
know was edited down from about a tenth of what he actually wrote
 
came out in Bound For Glory. 
He was absolutely unstoppable.
 
DD:
 Did he rewrite?
 
BLH:
 Never, never (laughing).
 He never even crossed anything out.
 
Pete made up a song about him at the period,  "My name is Woody Guthrie,
 
I
'm thc great hysterical bum, highly saturated in whiskey 1 rye and r
u m.
 
I
've wrote a million pages and I
've never read a one.  (laughing).
 I
 
think that's about the biggest thing that man has ever done.  (laughing).
 
And  it was absolutely true. I picked up the pieces of paper off the
 
floor and put them in order and read them.  Woody never did.
 
DD:
 Did you comment back to him?
 
BLH:
 We talked a lot about it.
 But  he wasn't the kind that you
 
could edit.  He wasn't in an editing state at that point,  it was  just
 
all coming out.  Kind of maniacally.
 He wasn't writing a book, he
 
was writing his life and what would happen to it was absolutely not
 
of any interest to him whatever.
 It was the process, not the product
 
that he was involved in.  So, we would talk about it, but just in
 
terms of his experience, not in terms of,  "You ought to cut it here,

or move it around there."
 
DD:
 There was no idea of a literary standard being applied then?
 
BLH:
 No, not at that time.
 Eventually,  of course, he did begin to
 
think about that.
 
Some  editor
 really
 
struggled on that for months.
 It was almost a trunk full of manu-
scripts.
 It was like doing it with Tom Wolf.
 And whoever edited
 
Bound For Glory, I heard later, was almost knocked out of sanity for
 
a long period of time afterwards (laughing).
 I think Alan finally
 
told Woody that he just simply had to stop and get some of this
 
taken care of and managed to get him to go to an editor,  I believe
 
that was Alan.
 
There was a lot of tension within the group because of these extremely
 
different personalities, but there was very little tension when we
 
were working; because it was personal tension, not artistic tension.
 
DD:  What I want to know is, whether the personal tensions ever mani-
fested themse Utes -

in political or in musical -

 the way in which someone says,  "Well,
 
that's not the right thing to do" when really what they mean is,  "You
 
didn't do your dishes this morning."
 
BLH:
 I think that happened somewhat.
 Not as much as you would
 
think.
 There was this sort of bizzare policy that we had that if
 
you really didn't want to go on a booking, you didn't have to.  That
 
gradually turned into a source of conflict.
 At first it was a safety
 
valve,  so if you were really sore at everybody,  or fed up, you just

simply didn't go.
 But, it began to be abused and the ones who always
 
went, like Pete Seeger and me and I think Pete H
es was pretty regular
 
also -
-
 began to feel exploited and abused.
 
DD:
 After all, the money was going  into the commune.
 
BLH:
 Right.  We would have to divide up occassionally, there would
 
be double booked and all those dumb things.  And we would find we
 
would be arriving at places and people would be sore because they
 
thought they would get the whole group and there was just two or
 
three.
 It was embarrassing and difficult.
 
DD:
 Was that a great problem with Woody?
 
BLH:
 It wasn't as much as with Lee.  Lee was really getting to the
 
point where he was really malingering,  in terms of performance.
 
Woody was much more disciplined really than Lee at that period.
 Now
 
I think Lee had been very disciplined for a period beforehand.
 But
 
this was when he was really breaking up.
 In point of fact, I think
 
what happened was that we really finally kicked him out.
 
DD:
 Right,
 
BLH:
 They kind of made an effort not to involve me in it too much
 
because I hadn't been there for the whole period.
 I was sort of new
 
into it and so I don't remember the whole meeting, I think I sort
 
of boiled out after a while.  We were really very short handed and
 
that was a big problem for us because most of your bookings came along

on Friday and Saturday night.  We really needed enough strong singers
 
that we could divide the group up into two and still put on a reason-
ably good performance, we just didn't have them.
 We were looking
 
around for more people all the time.
 The other th5
Jng we didn't have
 
was any kind of stable income and that was one of the reasons for the
 
move to the apartment where we could rent the hall next door for
 
regular performances.
 
DD:
 Instead of the basement?
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 That eased the situation a great deal.
 Lee's leaving,
 
moving into the apartment, adding Sis and Gordon who came up the
 
same time,  and having the regular income of the Sunday afternoon
 
Hootenannies.
 
DD:
 Didn't they begin when you were in the Almanac House?
 
BLH:
 We did a little bit, but it was too small and cramped and we
 
got too big crowds.  We had them in the basement room and it wasn't
 
big enough,  it really wasn't, and it was kind of unpleasant.  So,  it
 
was obvious we were going to have to hire a hall to do them and it
 
was also obvious that they were going to be very successful and that
 
we could count on them for the rent money.
 So that's the move to the
 
apartment, the loft apartment, though it was not as roomy a house,
 
and the living conditions were a little  worse.

contradiction to have a maid work in the Almanac house?
 
BLH:
 I remember that there was one.
 
DD:
 Because Gordon very clearly remembered someone came in and from
 
time to time came in and . .
.
 perhaps that was in the next house?
 
BLH:
 Well, it must have been in the next house because Gordon wasn't
 
in the first Almanac house.
 It was a big problem just keeping ordinary
 
sanitation in that house because there were five guys and one me.
 
DD:
 Five?  Let's see, PeterHawes, Woody, Pete, Lee...
 
BLH'
 Wait a minute, Pete, Woody, Lee.
 I guess you're right, there
 
were just the three of us living there.
 People spent the night from
 
time to time and the house was always full of other people.
 But, I
 
guess there were just the three guys living there (laughing).
 
DD:
 Mill never lived there?
 
BLH:
 No, he never did, he was over all the time, but he never lived
 
there.
 Alan Sloane was over there a lot and I think that's why I
 
thought of it as five guys because that was the basic performing unit.
 
Everybody took turns trying to clean up and all that.

 No,  it was just casual.
 Whenever anyone would get absolutely
 
desperate about something, they would get up and do it (laughing).
 
DD:
 I understand Lee was a cook?  Lee did a lot of the cooking?
 
BLH:
 Lee did a lot of the cooking, he was an excellent cook.
 So
 
the rest of us, kind of informally did the housekeeping and house
 
cleaning.

 Pete Haas was very good at it.
 He was a very immaculate kind

politics and their living style?

 Oh, yes, I think there was a reasonable amount of consciousness
 
of that.
 It was certainly discussed.

 There was a good deal of discussion of the variance

 A lot of
 
tolerance.

BLH:
 I don't think we were that self conscious about it.
 It was
 
pretty clear the performing style was sort of southern/south western.
 
I remember Pete Hawes and Butch later on talking about noticing that
 
their Boston accents had shifted when they sang without their particu-
larly being conscious of it.  They hadn't made a conscious effort to
 
drop the Boston 'a' or anything,  or stop clipping their...
 And they
 
maintained their speech style, but when they sang they were aware
 
that they had moved into slight southernisms.

 you were essentially from
 
upper middle class backgrounds? Or at least professional,
 
in some cases?
 
BLH:
 Well, they were all very different.
 I had been brought up
 
during the period when my father was vice president of the Republic
 
National Bank.
 However, we lived in a very comfortable house out
 
in the suburbs, in the wooded area before it became part of Dallas.
 
We lived a very comfortable life, it was deliberately kept somewhat
 
simple.
 Father was never one to spend a lot of money on anything,
 
he wasn't a miser, but both he and mother deliberately lived fairly
 
simple lives -
-
 they didn't spend what they could have.  Mother made
 
all my clothes for instance, that sort of thing.  That was partly

Pete Hawes was the son of a children

BLH:
 He left his widow with two small boys.
 She had to struggle
 
pretty hard for quite a few years there and they lived in an apart-
ment in Cambridge and she managed to get them scholarships to boarding
 
schools.
 She had no preparation for earning her living, which was
 
typical of that period.
 She was the daughter of George Washington
 
Cabole, the southern writer and had some income from her father s
 
estate, but not enough to keep herself and two little boys going.

But she had not been brought up to be a worker so she had to fight
 
pretty hard and had a very rough time for a few years.
 She studied
 
landscape gardening and became a consultant and she helped out at
 
boarding schools in return for tuition and so on.
 She then married,
 
remarried a second time, the Dean of Sophmores at Harvard.
 But again,
 
Butch and Pete were brought up in the common way that intellectuals
 
of that period lived, in a rather simple life.
 They were not...
 
DD:
 Not  ostentatious?
 
BLH:
 It was not  ostentatious, right.
 Pete, however,  an odd thing
 
happened to him.
 He had met an older woman who was a Houghten of the

basically supported him in the style to which one would like to be-
come accustomed.
 He spent all of his summers on her estate being
 
the young man of the household.
 Oh, he bred and raised racing pigeons
 
and he bred and raced the finest Siamese cats and whatever else his
 
fancy took-to.
 
Butch, in the meantime, was living at home and not getting all of
 
these goodies.  But Pete had developed a very aristocratic style
 
and was
 one of the odder ones in the whole Almanac picture
 
for this reason because he was really very fastidious and very...
 
D
ID:
 Where did his politics come from?
 
BLH:
 Well, I don't know.
 To be absolutely honest with you,  I don't.
 
I think it was an intellectual commitment that he made sometime well
 
before I knew him.  But he was quite left wing in his theories.
 He
 
didn't seem to find any discrepancies in terms of his personal style.
 
He was attached to the Almanacs out of intellectual conviction.
 He
 
was a strong singer, but not a good singer, not a reliable singer.
 
He rarely sang lead.
 His instrumental work was rather weak.  He was
 
more concerned and more active in terms of what we ought to be doing.
 
He was politically very interested and extremely well read and kept. 
very
 
up with the news and so on.
 I think he was/responsible for- a lot of
 
the political positions we took.
 
DD:
 This issue I wanted to raise here is, it seems to me that the
 
Almanacs were, to some degree,  intellectual proletarianazation,  if
 
that's not a mouthful.

BLH:
 Yes, I think so.
 Basically, we were all middle class,  except
 
for Woody, who had, as you point out,  a period of his time when he
 
was...
 
DD:
 In some ways, did you find yourself follo*ing Woody's lead be-
cause he was close to being the only folk among you?
 
BLH:
 Woody never blended, Woody was Woody.
 In personal behavior,
 
compositional style and singing style.
 It was a different group
 
when Woody was with us because he didn't sing, or particularly like
 
the prior repertoire.
 He would back up on guitar, but his stuff was
 
southwestern style and southwestern tunes and quite different from
 
the kinds of things that the other members of the group both per-
c
v1
 
So that we were dealing,  in a sense, with
 
two repertoires when Woody was with us.
 We had enormous respect for
 
Woody and his songs were clearly superb.  We did battle with him a
 
lot.
 Woody had his own personal dream which was very much involved
 
with his understanding of how songs worked.
 
He felt that the ballod was the perfect form and he always tried to
 
write ballads.  He felt -
-
 I remember his saying to me that you can't
 
be sorry for a million people, you can only be sorry for one person.
 
I thought about that a number of times, it's a very profound state-
ment I think.  He said,  "You can't even care about a million people,
 
you can only care about one or two or three people, so what you really
 
have to do is talk about one or two or three people."
 He was violently
 
opposed to depersonalized songs that simply talked about issues.
 He
 
didn't like slogan songs and resented them, but he occassionally
 
would sing them.
 But, he and Mill fought very hard over that issue.

really care if it had an immediate,  political moral or not.
 And he
 
would just as soon you wouldn't come in with the identifying slogan.
 
He was really working very very hard and very deeply all the time.
 
More as a novelist, basically I think than as a straight political
 
singer.  He was very important to us for that reason, I think he got
 
people thinking in a very different and deep way.

 agit-prop, to drama,  from

those things don't matter.
 What matters is that people should them-
selves be able to react against oppression when they see it because
 
they are that kind of people.
 His idea was that art changed you in
 
a moral sense.  He was an extremely moral man, though addicted occa-
ssionally to immoral behavior (laughing).
 In terms of his art, he
 
wanted it to have a social point and not necessarily a political
 
point.  He wanted to change people's feelings.
 
That was something we
eally hadn't thought about I think until
 
Woody came on the scene.
 And his repertoire really was quite diff-
erent from the kinds of things that we had done before.
 He thought
 
a song like "John Doe" was a very good song.

 Because it was just that.

 That's right.

 But he wouldn't like the "I Hate War Song" perhaps?
 
BLH:
 Not that much, I don't think, though he himself wrote the
 
Franklin Roosevelt...

 "You Ain't Gonna Send Me Across The Sea?"

 No.
 He wrote the one about Roosevelt speaking to the ASU kids

 "I see you standing in the rain, why are you standing in the rain?"

 That was one of his
 
songs and it was a very very good song.

 I don't know of any recordings of it, unfortunately.

 Really?  Hmmm.
 It was a very moving song, particularly if
 
you'd been there.  That was really the way you felt and Woody wrote
 
it the way he -felt it.
 
DD:
 I think that's very well said.  What I was also trying to get
 
at was whether there was any actual deference to him in terms of his
 
life style, which was, as you said, was rather eccentric.
 
BLH:
 No.  There was a tremendous tolerance,as I say, and Woody was

regarded as just as nutty as anybody else and
, just as entitled to his
 
share of nuttiness if he didn't impinge on you beyond the point of
 
being able to bear it.
 He was a little erratic about going out on
 
bookings, but certainly not as erratic as Lee had been and he was
 
tolerated on that problem because when he went on
 
very good and he worked hard.
 But  we recognized
 
a
.
 lot of personal problems too.
 
bookings he was
 
that he was having
 
Let me expound just a little bit more on Woody's writing business
 
because I think something that hasn't been commented on about Woody
 
was -
-
 he grabbed onto the name as a symbol of the story.
 His first
 
version of "Reuben James" he wrote from the casualty list.
 It was
 
about 150 verses (laughing).
 He got the casualty list and he wrote
 
everybody's name that got drowned into it.
 I came downstairs one
 
morning and there it was -
-
have the chorus.
 It was to

this incredible long poem and it didn't
 
the tune of "Wildwood Flower" and he
 
It was simply a recounting of the inci-
dent and we all thought it was great, but we all thought it was com-
pletely impossible to sing; in the first place, no one else could ever
 
learn it.
 In the second place, no one would ever listen to it, though
 
it did have an incredible effect -
-
 you would reel off that many names.
 
How many people got drowned, L
.50?
 And he had them all there.
 I
 
think it was Pete -
-
 and Woody was passionate about this -
-
 he wanted
 
that song sung and he wanted to sing it and he was prepared to stay
 
the next six weeks and learn the thing.
 
I think it was Pete who finally came up with the "what were their
 
names" idea, and that Woody finally conceded on.  But we had to come

up with that formula before he would consent to cut out that listing.
 
Because he felt that you ought to know who it was that went down on
 
that ship and that's why you would care about it.  But then I think
 
he recognized the artistic validity of the line,  "What were their
 
names" and that spoke to the concern that he had; t at there were
 
that many individual human beings involved.
 He accepted that as a
 
symbolic statement, but that remained with him as a kind of leit
 
motif for his writing.
 
He thought a lot about people's names and if you remember the later
 
song he did about the farm workers, "Good-by  to my Juan, good-by
 
Rosalita, you won't have no name when you ride the big airplane."
 
He had read a sto ry in the paper about this...
 
DD:
 In the Times was it?
 
BLH:
 I think so.
 In which the names of the people were not listed,
 
and that was what he saw in the story -
-
 that they didn't even care
 
enough about those folks to list their names in the paper.
 And
 
that's what caused him to write the song,  it wasn't just the accident.
 
It was the neglect of the individual human being implicit in that
 
story.
 So that this fits into his notion about what songs are about,
 
that they tell about individual people; that that's the thing that
 
move€i people artistically and emotionally.
 
I think it was the problem that he was working on all his life
 
how to make a general statment about the particular.
 Because he
 
thought that's really what art was, and I think he's right.
 I think
 
he was much more onto it than any of the rest of us were.
 He was much

more the really creative artist.
 Of any of us,  except maybe Pete,
 
and Pete not as deeply.
 
DD:
 He accepted, though,
 that your inspiration could
 
politics
 
come from/-- in other words, you could write a song to suit a mood,
 
a moment, a cause; but that that had to be transformed into someone's
 
life.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 I think he wrote out of general feeling, he wrote out of
 
a general reaction to something.  Again, the story of the farm workers
 
-
-
 he wrote the song because he felt it was so outrageous that these
 
people were simply called farm workers and were not identified as
 
human beings and that was what made him write the song.
 So he re-
sponded to general principles that he observed being mishandled
 
around him.  He wrote out of intellectual convictions on certain
 
things, but he felt that the work of the artist was to make these
 
statements so well that you never could forget them.  And the way
 
he
 felt that you did this was by personification in one way or
 
another.

 I
've talked a little bit
 
about Woody in classes -

 and typically, people seem to react that
 
woody was a collectivist and thinking about groups all the time,  and
 
how could he think about individuals.
 But that was what he thought
 
a group was, was a bunch of individuals,  and that was really what he
 
as saying a lot of the time:
 "These aren't just union members and
 
as long as you call them union members, you aren't saying anything

 These are collections of 7

and they are all different and they/all interesting and they come

 And Woody himself, God knows, was an individual.
 
DD:
 I'm going to have to absorb that.
 I think that you may have
 
said something that actually has some significance for me and what
 
I'm doing too.

that we have faced, not only in that period, but today.

 Yes.
 
D
I):
 I would like to go to Pete now if I could.
 I would like to
 
get some idea of what he was going through in his contacts with the
 
Almanacs:
 when he moved in there, how he was being transformed by
 
was
 
the experience from where he started -
-
 which I presume/an almost
 
sheltered, but dedicated and energetic individual with a commitment
 
to both music and folk music;  but without really a lot of inter-
personal exposure.
 
BLH:
 Pete's a tremendously talented person.
 He always was and I
 
think he still is.  There were enormous walls of reserve around him
 
at all times.
 I think in work sessions was when he showed up his
 
-  — ' i x
,r r
 
personality the most.
 In between times he was by himself,  either
 
physically or metaphorically.

DD:
 Was Pete given to fights?
 
I
 
BLH:
 No, no, afterwards in conversations.  That's when I
've seen
 
Pete mostly is
 after concerts.  This is in the,last few years,
 
last maybe 20 years actually.
 I
've seen him mostly when he's come
 
out to L.A.  on a concert tour or something.
 So we usually get to-
gether afterwards -
-
 or maybe the day before -
-
 and he's clearly
 
exhausted.
 Backstage he's usually surrounded and mobbed and every
 
once in a while he blanks out.
 All performers that I know do this.
 
But Pete wa  always this way a little bit.
 I think his tremendous
 
public success has forced him into having to retreat,  I mean you go
 
crazy if you don't.
 
DD:
 Oh back there you have a real dialectical situation 5sharing a
 
bedroom with a man who has walls of reserves, but barely a curtain...
 
BLH:
 Yes (laughing).
 Well I have a lot of reserve and certainly did
 
at that time so it was fairly simple for us actually.
 If we'd had
 
any kind of intense personal relationship at that period,  it would
 
have been impossible.
 But, it was like a dormitory or like a tent
 
in a camp or something.
 You know, where you really do keep your
 
reserve up and your things separate and you make your own little
 
world out of just your own particular physical space.  Because if
 
you have to interact too much, you get into a fight.
 So,  it was not
 
particularly difficult because  Pete and I were so much the same
 
kind of people in that respect.

BLH:
 No.
 Absolutely not.  He only blows up -
-
 like I said, I
've
 
only seen him blow up twice in all the years I
've krown him.
 It's
 
very scarey because he's so non-fighty.
 And when you are around
 
somebody that you don't expect a strong reaction from, and they give
 
you a strong reaction, it's multiplied by 17 in effect.
 One of the
 
occasions,  we were driving on one of the tours in Detroit.
 I think
 
Pete Hawes was driving and Butch and I,  or somebody else, was sitting
 
in the front.
 
They had taken down the back seat,  it was a station wagon, and Pete
 
was lying in the back.
 No,  I think it was Arthur Stern  or somebody.
 
Someone was sitting with Pete and Pete was
 half way lying on
 
the floor.
 It was a very strenuous tour and everybody was tired and
 
cross and there had been an awful lot of bickering about something
 
stupid -
-
 where are we going to stop to eat,  or are we driving all
 
the way through.
 It had gone on for about an hour and everybody was
 
kind of (indicating)  -
-
 not on their best behavior and we were all
 
very tired and antsy with each other.
 
All of a sudden there was this crash in the back seat and Pete had
 
put his foot through my mandolin.
 Just smashed it completely.
 No-
body said a word for the rest of the trip, there was complete silence.
 
(laughing).  And the next morning, I fixed it up and put it back
 
together (end of tape).

under iron control.
 But, the details, I would just as soon not have.
 
DD:  What was the second time?
 
BLH:
 Actually, that was the second time I was thinking of.  Although
 
I have seen him simply get up and walk away, over and over again with
 
the Almanacs -
-
 he would just leave the house in the middle of a dis-
cussion, he would get up and walk out.
 It was very clear that it had
 
gotten to the point where he couldn't control it,  or thought he
 
couldn't and was simply getting out of the situation.
 Everybody knew
 
this about Pete.
 Pete was such a rock (laughing) that when he would
 
get up and leave,  everybody would realize that was what was happening
 
with him  and would try to fix it up before he got back so that the
 
problem would be solved or we would at least shut up about it.
 
I think that people with that kind of vast, passionate energy have
  
to find control mechanisms.
 One of them is, of course, art.  That's
 
why Pete is such an extraordinary artist.
 I think it's because of
 
the fires of passion that burn in him all of the time which he ex-
presses in art and releases in his performances.
 I think that's why
 
he's always been the most magnetic singer of the period.
 Pete's
 
early concert periods were simply stunning for solo performances
 
they just rocked you.
 There was just one little skinny old guy with
 
a banjo.
 
I remember taking -
-
 I persuaded somebody fairly important, a musician,
 
to go to one of Pete's concerts.
 I can't think who it was, but it
 
was somebody on the level of Aaron Copeland,  or somebody like that,.

He turned around to me after the performance and said,  "I never, ever
 
heard somebody do so much with so little.  That man
 sings without any
 
voice, he doesn't have a very good instrument (laughing) but, you
 
simply cannot gain
' T
hay the fact that he is an extr
 
ordinary communi-
cator."
 So, I think Pete handled this extreme passion that he
 
I think-- has been deviled with all of his life
 by becoming an
 
artist and also by building this wall.
 I never,  ever felt that I
 
was behind it with Pete.
 He had a wall, of reserve that was really
 
the
 
very very strong.
 I'm sure he let down/bars with Toshi and maybe
 
his brothers,  I don't know, but I don't think anybody else.
 
Learning a social manner that wouldn't allow him to seem to be as
 
reserved as he is *
-
-
 if that makes any sense.
 
DD:
 Could you expand on that?  You're in an unusually good position
 
from your own...
 
BLH:
 Well, I think Pete looks very sociable,  and acts very sociable.
 
That allows him to be very private.
 I do the same thing.
 I'm an
 
extremely private person.  Most people, I think -
-
 it's hard to tell--
but I think most people think of me as. an extremely sociable human
 
being.
 But, I can get along by myself better than most people I know.
 
I do not need people as much as I seem to need people, put it that
 
way.
 I think Pete is the same way.
 I think that's one reason that
 
we were able to live together in such extraordinary physical intimacy
 
without ever impinging on each other at all.
 Because we never crossed
 
those lines with each other.

I think that Pete has a deep interest in people,  just as I do.
 So-
,
 
when he is interacting with people, he's really all there, but his own
 
reactions to it are walled off.  When he gets to a point where he
 
can't avoid doing something that he thinks is socia ly wrong to do
 
which is have a quarrel -
-
 he doesn't like to quarrel, he simply
 
leaves.
 He either leaves physically, which is the way he used to do
 
in the Almanacs,  or he leaves mentally -
-
 as I see him do in social
 
situations, where all of a sudden, Pete's off in another world;
 
DD:
 Somebody like Woody though -
-
 it must have been very hard to
 
turn off to somebody like Woody.
 How did that...
 
BLH:
 He would leave if Woody got on him too badly.
 
DD:
 Did Woody tease him?
 
BLH:
 Some.
 Pete teased too.
 Pete kidded Woody a lot, we all did.
 
Woody kind of liked it.
 It .
vas very brotherly and sisterly teasing,
 
it was very fond teasing.  Woody also was extremely reserved.
 I have
 
a hunch that was one of the ways that we managed to live in a collec-
tive like that.
 It was extremely uncomfortable in any physical sense,
 
and no privacy.
 In the second apartment, my bedroom was the dining
 
room, I had a couch in the corner and worked up a screen.
 The people
 
were tromping through there all of the time.
 
I suspect one of the ways we were able to maintain ourselves under
 
ridiculous conditions -

really that we were terribly intere t d in what we were doing and that
 
was absolutely basic and prime.  When you got uninterested, then you
 
quit and went off and did something else.
 But, assuming the interest -
-
I think the other thing was that we maintained a lot of private re-
serve and simply led our personal lives elsewhere.  Woody was courting
 
Marjorie during that period.  Margie hardly ever came up to the
 
Almanac house, Woody met her at other places, or went over to her
 
place, or they met at the Jefferson Diner which was our big hang
 
out at that time.
 
When everybody wanted to talk personally to anyone we went over to
 
the Jefferson Diner and sat and had coffee and hamburgers.  Woody
 
taught the Jefferson Diner folks to put lettuce, tomatoes and onions
 
on hamburgers -
-
 which was not done in New York at that time.
 He
 
referred to it as an Oklahoma hamburger (laughing).  We would all
 
govover and order Okiahomas and the Jefferson Diner folk knew us
 
well -
-
 and drink coffee.

BLH:
 Yes, sort of an ethereal creature from somep:Lace else, a kind
 
of a Peter Pan kind of figure.  Though he would, I think, not re-
always
 
spond well to such statements (laughing).
 He was/extremely inven-
tive and imaginative and humerous and you never knew what he was
 
going to say next kind of person.
 Kind of out of left field sort
 
of person.
 An awful lot of fun and very interesting and very indivi-
dualistic.
 He maintained some of that quality, but he really was the
 
central figure in the group and he knew it and he knew it depended on
 
him.
 If he pulled out, there wouldn't be anything left.
 He took that
 
responsibility extremely seriously.
 
7

He tried to figure out how to handle all of these crazy personalities.
 
He was the sort of organizing force.  We could have a meeting without
 
Woody, or without Lee,  or without Sis,  or without me; but you couldn't
 
have a meeting without Pete.  He was essential.  He really grew up
 
and took on that responsibility and thought a lot  about it and
 
worried over it.
 He was the one that really thought about the group
 
in a creative way.  Thought about who ought to be added, thought
 
about what kinds of performances we ought to be doing, thought about
 
if we should start trying to sing to different groups in the city, or
 
worried about the repertoire and that kind of thing.
 It was his life
 
and his real passion.
 
DD:
 Someone told me a story one time about coming back to the Almanac
 
House and Pete was at his desk -
-
 he apparantly had some kind of desk
 
where he used to keep his files and the books -
-
 him simply being
 
crying because there hadn't been any bookings coming in and saying,
 
"Nbbody cares about the Almanac singers."

BLH:
 I don't remember that episode, myself, but it seems quite
 
characteristic, yes.
 It was very hand to mouth.
 O
f course,  as the
 
war began,  it got even worse.
 It got better in some ways, we got
 
that big job singing on Norman Corwin's show,  and 1egan to be used
 
by civil defense groups,  and so on.
 The group morale began to go
 
the
 
down because/guys would say they were going to be drafted, or they
 
felt like they should go in and enlist.  They were still worried
 
about what would happen to the group if they did.
 
Woody got antsy and thought he should join the war effort in some
 
way or another and so did Pete.
 It was a very hard scrabble the
 
whole time.
 Pete really born the brunt of it.
 
DD:  Why was it him?  Why didn't Lee sit down and keep accounts, or
 
why didn't Mill?
 
BLH:
 Well, Lee was really out of the group after the first bit. I
 
a
 
saw him only a few times after that.
 It was/very deep emotional
 
wound he suffered then.
 I don't know quite when or how he got over
 
it enough  to start in with the new group.
 So that  after he moved
 
then
 
out, I don't think I saw him more/once or twice.  Mill, kind of dis-
appeared also.
 He would come along on bookings, but he didn't hang
 
out at the house.
 
Sis and Gordon sort of helped take over on the responsibilities on
 
maintaining the house and paying the bills and so on.
 
DD:
 Do you know when they moved in?

BLH:
 They moved in when we moved over to the place  with the loft.
 
That was on 6th Avenue, I believe.
 As I say, I think Mill was still
 
going with us on bookings from time to time, but he. didn't hang out
 
at the house as much.
 He was beginning to develop  his radio and
 
writing career at that time I think.
 
DD:
 People have described him as very much of a sort of opportunist,
 
or -
-
 I don't know if this in hind sight or -
-
 I think hustler was
 
the term...
 
BLH:
 Lee had that personality, but I never felt he exploited the
 
Almanacs..  I think he was sincere when he was there.
 I think he
 
began to lose interest and wanted to develop his personal career.
 
He wasn't as dedicated qs the rest of the  rou . but as I say, I
 
didn't think his relationship was exploited.  He wasn't standing
 
on the Almanacs in order to get ahead, personally.
 He was getting
 
ahead on his own.
 Those interests were more important to him than
 
the Almanac interests.  That was my feeling about him.  He did lose
 
touch, he didn't keep in touch, as the rest of us did.  Maybe he
 
turned against the group at some point.  But, it's interesting to
 
me that I really never saw Mill after the Almanac period,  and I've
 
seen everybody else, you know, with Christmas cards and things like
 
that.  We kept in touch and considered ourselves as old personal
 
friends and somehow or another that didn't happen with Mill.
 
DD:
 I
'd like to know a little bit about the relationship that Woody
 
had with Pete.

A woman, Irene Paul was her name, she organized lumber workers.
 Shp
 
gave me the very clear impression that Pete and Woody had a very
 
strange relation;  a very complicated one.
 In many respects, Woody
 
depended on Pete.
 In fact, it might not have been s  different from
 
the relation we were discussing yesterday with Pete and Toshi.
 
BLH:
 Woody did depend on Pete quite a lot.
 He also depended on my
 
brother Alan quite a lot.  He was a very torn person in a number of
 
respects.
 He knew he was good and he knew he could make it and he
 
knew he couldn't make it because he wouldn't accept the terms.  He
 
tried a couple of times to take radio shows and things like that and
 
he would always kill his own chances.
 So that he was very dependent
 
on other people getting him jobs.  He blew too many of them and he
 
would blow them when we weren't with him to keep him under control
 
or to get him out of there when he started to blow up.  He would be
 
invited to bookings and to private homes and then behave outrageously
 
-
 if he thought they  :
ere upper clas .
 
Whenever you were with Woody, you had '
to keep a weather eye out for
 
whether or not Woody was going to start reacting to the circumstances
 
that he disapproved of in the particular environment.
 So that every-
body that worked with Woody  in a way was keeping care of him.  We were
 
also trying to get him jobs that we thought he could hang on to.
 One
 
of the tensions between Woody and Pete was that Pete was,  at the time,
 
quite puritanical.  He didn't approve of liquor, cigarettes, coffee,
 
sex, anything much, and Woody was involved in all (laughing).
 Pete
 
also had this problem with Lee, whose life style he disapproved of.
 
I don't mean that he came on about this all of the time, this was one
 
of the ways that he was growing up in this period.
 Every once in a
 
while his personal distaste  would show through,  but he began to learn
 
that there were other people who operated quite differently.
 
DD:
 Can you think of any times when his distaste s owed through?

 No,  it would come out on that level;  it just came out.

don't do it again."  (laughing)
 I mean, it was fairly forthright on

this.

Ruth and Pete all have a peculiar kind of metabolism that really
 
doesn't allow them to drink or use any kind of stimulants.
 I remem-
ber Ruth talking about it to me one time saying, "I simply can't
 
tolerate coffee,  it puts me into a nervous twitch ttat I can't get
 
any work done."
 She was commenting to me that she had given in and
 
had a cup of coffee that morning because it smelled so good and saying
 
that she simply couldn't do it and neither could Charlie.
 
Charlie, you know,  always was sort of a yoga man and was very very
 
careful about his food.  They ate very well, but very specially, a
 
very different kind of diet than I was used to.
 It was not southern
 
cooking.  A lot of vegetables, lean meat, honey, that kind of diet,
 
which is rather standard these days but at that time it was rather
 
unusual.
 I have seen Pete drink a quarter of a class of beer and pass
 
out, I mean literally, go dead asleep on the carpet.  This was after
 
a performance when he was tired, but I remember his talking about it
 
in his trips abroad; that people are constantly asking him to toast.
 
He had found that he simply could not toast anybody (laughing).
 How
 
difficult it was to explain.
 
DD:
 He's told me that in the Weavers period he had a great problem
 
with people asking him to drink and be convivial and just making him
 
so mad that he just flipped out.
 
BLH:
 He really physically cannot take it and neither can Charlie,
 
and as I say, Ruth was the same way.
 I think it probably is some sort
 
of hereditory factor.

him it was really -

 he had kind of a poisonous reaction to it.

Pete was. always too funny to
 
do it too seriously, but there was a little feeling of that.  Then
 
the response of Lee and Woody was that he was just a young boy and
 
didn't have hair on his chest yet  and would have to grow up and learn
 
how to be a real man (laughing).
 So there was that kind of thing going
 
on between them in fairly good part.  But,  I
'm sure it added an awful
 
lot to Pete's personal burdens because he really was the one that kept
 
the group going.
 In a way, along with me,  because I was reliable and

there, but I was not as creatively contributing to the group.
 I sort
 
of kept everybody talking to each other and kept the basic groceries
 
in.
 I was important from that point of view, but, in terms of doing
 
the real creative thinking about the group, that was Pete's responsi-
bility and he really had it very much on his should ers.  Woody would
 
occasionally  come up with a real contribution in that line, but
 
basically, he was busy working out his own artistic struggle.
 
DD:
 Do you recall Pete going out and hustling up tires for the war
 
effort?
 Is that an image that you remember?

 No, .

to work with their neighbors on the fire brigade?  The Almanacs appar-
antly were not sturdy enough to pull the hose all the way off the truck?
 
BLH:
 Yes, I remember that.
 (laughing) I think that was probably
 
Woody (laughing).  He was really a very frail guy.
 He was little,
 
you know Woody.  He was a short man, slightly built man, he was wirey
 
and tough.  But, that would not surprise me at all.

tion and they decided to go to Mexico.

and also for tenor singing.

 Yes.  They were lead performers and of a slightly different style.
 
DD:
 Did they sing in different keys?
 
BLH:
 No, their attack was different singing together.  Their voices
 
are just quite different.  Woody has the flat dry sound and Pete's
 
voice is a rounder kind of voice.
 Butch developed a very sensitive
 
response to Woody.  When you sing with Woody, you have to look at the

that note and get onto the next one.
 He was completely erratic in that
 
sense.  He would hold a note on one verse and not hold it on the next
 
verse, sometimes it would be five beats and sometimes seven and some-
times thirteen.
 
If you were tenor singing for him, you had to really get where you could
 
see him and get used to the very small muscular signs of what he was
 
going to do next.  There was no question of who was in charge (laughing).

think
 
BLH:
 I don't/they liked to sing together very much.
 
DD:
 But they traveled  a lot together and made music together I
'm sure.
 
BLH:
 They'd play together a lot, but they wouldn't sing together very
 
much.  Except in groups and Woody had the lead on "Reuben James" Pete
 
would sing in on the chorus,  or the other way around.
 But, not duet.
 
I never heard them sing duet,  except occasionally  horsing around or
 
just learning a song together, but in performance terms, no.
 
DD:
 I
'd like to get some background on some of the other people and
 
figure out, what their relationship to the Almanacs were.
 Do you recall
 
Burl coming around at all?
 
BLH:
 Burl came and performed at the hootenannies from time to time.
 
DD:
 In the first period,  or in the second?  In the basement of the
 
Almanac House or over when you rented the...
 
BLH:
 I think both.
 Burl was not interested in political repetoire
 
at any point.  He sang his own stuff so that he was willing to parti-
cipate in hoots, where we would introduce him and he would do his own
 
part of the program.
 He would join in on something occasionally,
 
but
 
he was not interested in the group in terms of what we were doing over
 
all.
 
DD:
 So there's a grain of truth to his latest statements that the
 
reason he worked with people like the Almanacs was because it was the
 
only audience he could find.

BLH:
 Oh sure,  I would think so.
 He liked us too.
 Gee, I don't know,
 
at that period I never talked to him very much.
 I never particularly
 
asked him why he didn't join the group, it was just obvious he was one
 
of the ones not interested.
 It was sort of the sam  relationship that
 
we had with Leadbelly.
 Nobody ever invited Leadbeliy to join the group.
 
DD:
 They were different generations.
 
BLH:
 Different group,  different generation, different repetoire.
 Burl
 
was essentially the same sort of thing.
 
DD:
 How come Alan didn't get involved with the Almanacs, that's some-
thing I've always wondered?
 
BLH:
 I think he was just simply too busy at the time.
 In his own
 
terms, he had all the work to do that he wanted to do.
 And it was a
 
small operation,  it looms large, but it was small time in terms of
 
what Alan was doing.  He certainly tried to help the group get jobs
 
and things like that.
 He was involved in the Norman Corwin part and
 
so  on.
 It wasn't having the kind of impact that Alan was interested
 
in working in at that time.
 He was trying to get CBS programs on the
 
air and he was trying to get commercial recordings out and a lot of
 
things.
 He was really of an older generation also.
 He's seven years
 
older than I am and his career was well under way at that time.
 
DD:
 On the other hand, I
'm sure he must have been very sympathetic
 
to the Almanancs.
 It almost seems like the Almanacs were a continuation
 
of what
 he would have liked to see happen.

BLH:
 Oh sure, right.
 
DD:
 Did he hang out at the Almanac house?
 
BLH:
 Oh, he'd come and visit, but he was in Washington basically.
 He
 
was working as the curator of the Archives most of that period.
 I
'm
 
not sure -
-
 he got drafted,  or volunteered, I forget which,  in '41.
 
I
'm not sure whether he left the library to go into the service,  or if
 
there was some period when he was doing other things in New York or not.
 
I really don't remember.  He certainly was extremely friendly.
 I think
 
he came and sang at a couple of hoots when he was in town, that sort of
 
thing.
 Plus, he really wasn't a performer, he wasn't that interested
 
in performing.
 Neither was I for that matter, I kind of enjoyed it but
 
it wasn't anything that I would have thought of to do on my own.
 
DD:
 What confuses me
 is how he could be
 a polit-
ical inspiration for Pete;
 politically,  it seems like he would have
 
really wanted to reach out to the unions.
 And yet, working with CBS
 
is a different context.
 In other words, Woody could have had a career,
 
and so could Pete probably.
 I mean, the Almanacs had that surge of
 
interest in January and February of 194 2 .
 He made a conscious deci-
sion I guess to work in that context instead of the more outlaw turf.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 Alan has always been interested in reaching a great mass
 
of people.
 It's why he produces popular books instead of scholarly
 
work for instance in terms of books on collections.  He is a large
 
thinker in that sense.
 He always feels that his albums, in spite of

all evidence to the contrary (laughing).  He always feels that his
 
albums are going to be best sellers.
 That's what he has in his mind.
 
Not for reasons of personal gain, but because he thinks that this is
 
the most beautiful stuff he's ever heard and everybody in the country
 
will agree.  He was always concerned with national broadcasts as op-
posed to local broadcasts, that kind of thing.
 He's always been
 
operating on that level,  ever since I
've known him.
 He certainly
 
consulted with the Almanacs a lot.
 He was one of the people we went
 
to for advice quite frequently,  like Charlie.
 He was concerned about
 
our work.
 
During the Wallace period,  for example, he was the one who got the
 
whole song movement going in the Wallace campaign.
 But, he would work

n going out and doing the singing himself.
 
He's more of an organizer and an idea man than he is an individual
 
performer.
 
DD:
 What role did Earl have?
 
BLH:
 Earl was always,  again, a friend and elder statesman.
 Also per-
formed at hootenannies, but not very often because a lot of what he did
 
really had to have piano, and we never had a piano.  He'd come down
 
with his guitar and sing every now and again.
 He was always very
 
friendly, helpful and got us jobs all of the time.
 
DD:
 Did he have any role in your records?
 
BL T
h
 I don't think so.
 His real interest at that period was in his
 
- 
sort of -- I don't know what you would call them -- cantatas maybe,
 
that kind of composition.
 We were really not interested in that kind
 
of music,  although we liked his work and respected it,  but it wasn't
 
anything we were involved in doing.
 He was also in a period
 
of boom at that point.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 He aas sort of a dim figure in my recollection, he was not
 
very active.
 He did come along on bookings and sing.
 He and Mill fit
 
together very well in vocal style.
 He was always nice to have come,
 
but he didn't participate actively in the group.
 
BLH:
 Not usually, neither did Mill usually.
 When we moved over to
 
the loft place, the basic group was Woody, Gordon, Sis,  me and Pete.
 
Mill and Alan Sloane would come occasionally  to the Sunday hoot  and
 
participate,  or they wouldn't.
 They would go on Friday and Saturday
 
night bookings,  and occassionally they wouldn't.
 They chipped in their
 
money when they could,  but both of them were working then.

BLH:
 Didn't know that.
 
DD:
 He talks about the Almanacs.  He recanted and he talks a lot
 
about his career at that time and his tangential relation to the Almanacs
 
BLH:
 Well,  it was so tangential that I don't recall every having a
 
serious discussion of anything with him, he was just one of the people.
 
DD:
 How about Arthur Stern?  He was an art teacher?
 
BLH:
 Yes, he was an art teacher.  He got involved in the group during
 
the period when we were getting pretty desperate because Pete and
 
Woody had both gone into the service.
 
DD:

BLH:
 Yes.
 Butch was L
iF because of his paralysis,  it left his leg
 
in fact it gave him permanent arthritis, he was left with.
 He never
 
could pass the physical, though he tried repeatedly.
 Gordon was also
 
L
i
.F because he had had T.B.
 He's never been very well.
 In fact, he
 
never could sing, he never had enough wind to sing at all.
 He carried
 
the accordian (laughing).  That was his role he always said.
 He was a
 
nice guy to have around, he took care of a lot of stuff;  good cook too.
 
We were down to just not enough folks to handle bookings.
 It was pretty
 
dreadful because all of our stars were gone.
 Sis was never a very
 
strong singer and neither was I.  We could tag along and do one song
 
in a program and sing in the choruses, that sort of thing.

DD:
 I think you're being too modest because I know the recordings.
 
You had your solo numbers.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 I never felt that I was that strong of
 singer.
 Particu-
larly at that period.
 I didn't have the vocal strength to do a lot of
 
those kind of rousing songs that we were supposed to do.
 I was always
 
cracking up on them (laughing).
 You really need a good strong, loud
 
male lead.  Even Sis's voice was too thin to sound good on a kind of
 
rousing "Reuben James" type song.
 I always felt we sounded too feeble.
 
You know,  "Down In The Valley" is more my style (laughing).
 
DD:
 Yes,  I remember that.
 I played that on the radio just fairly
 
recently.
 
BLH:
 Hmmm.
 Didn't know it was still around.

 Yes,  it's a ten inch called "The Lonesome Valley" I believe.
 
It was on an old Folkways' release -

 That was one that Moe put together out of scraps.
 We didn't
 
ever plan that one.
 We recorded it several times.
 By the way, the
 
role of Moe Asch is extremely important in here and I should get a
 
few words in about Moe.  You ought to talk about Moe some.
 I think
 
he's been very much neglected in the history of this period.
 He was
 
really the reliable.

BLH:
 Oh yes.
 
DD:
 Before the war?
 
BLH:
 Yes, yes.
 He had Disc at that time.
 He went bankrupt about
 
seven times and always started back in again.
 Always the same way,
 
always the same old reliable sweet Moe.
 He never paid you a cent
 
of royalties, but if you were really flat -
-
 and most of us were -
-
you could always drop by to see Moe and he would invite you to lunch
 
(laughing).
 He never would let you pay a cent, he would take you and
 
feed you up and would slip you a few bucks.
 He did that for every
 
single member of the Almanacs and for many many many other people,
 
consistently.
 He really supported most of the singers.
 It was quite
 
routine in a funny kind of way.
 You didn't ever touch Moe for a real
 
loan, but you used Moe as your last resort and he understood that this
 
was what was happening.
 He always handled it like a perfect gentlemen,
 
always made you feel good, gave you a couple of dollars just so you
 
could take a taxi home.
 
He also supported Woody almost 1OO  when Woody was really down.  He
 
hired him, that was one of the great things that ever happened, I
 
think;  in terms of imagination and really being there when needed.
 
and
 
He hired him at $25 a day to sit up there /
 record every single song
 
he knew.
 And Woody, you know, had them all written down in those note
 
books.
 I remember going up there frequently and there was Woody on
 
the stool with notebook over here, and he'd turn the page and start
 
the next song (laughing); get through that and turn the page and sing
 
the next one.
 And he literally recorded his entire repetoire and Moe

had no use for it at all.  But,  it was a way to pay Woody and keep him
 
alive.
 
DD:
 An historical function.
 
BLH:
 An historical function,  it was incredible.  Moe would do the
 
albums that nobody else would touch.  He would bring out an album and
 
pay you 25 bucks when
, you were flat.
 There's been a lot of feeling
 
that Moe exploited people, but I never had the slightest sense that
 
that was happening.
 
DD:
 Do you receive royalties from"I
'alking Union?"
 
BL H:
 
No.  Moe sends me 3
7 cents ; or qom pthing l
ike that every year
 
(laughing), from an album I did with Mickey Miller where I backed her
 
up and I don't know why he all of a sudden started paying me royalties
 
for that.  He never paid me royalties for anything else.
 
DD:
 Were you on "Talking Union?'
 
BLH:
 Yes, I was on part of that.
 Again, that was a thing that I was
 
in some of the cuts of,  in the chorus.

dously successful.

 Not only is it still out, but people say,  "Labor Unions of the
 
1930's," and ironically comes the 1941 recording of...
 It's an auto-
matic cultural association.
 
BLH:
 He paid the Almanacs royalties,  in fact, that was one of the
 
ways we were able to keep going.
 All of the Almanacs records that he
 
produced, he paid us six monthly royalties on.
 But, what happened
 
after the Almanacs djssolved,  I don't know.
 I don't know what happened
 
in terms of his bookkeeping arrangements, he may have just sent it all
 
to Woody.  That's the kind of thing he would do, he would pick out who
 
he thought needed it and he would send it to him, and he didn't care
 
whether it was legal or not (laughing).
 You know,  it was perfectly
 
obvious to everybody that Moe was never making a dime,  in a personal
 
Sense.
 
DD:
 How about Sonny?  Was he playing with you in those days?
 
BLH:
 Again, Sonny and Brownie came and played at the hoots.
 They
 
never performed with the group, as far as I know.  Except
 
of course on other concerts where we were booked in.  We were good
 
friends and saw each other quite frequently, but, again, they were not
 
interested in the political repetoire, they were interested in singing
 
their own songs
 very much like Leadbelly.
 
DD:
 I hope that you won't consider this an impolite question.
 But,
 
reading Gordon's accounts of the Almanacs,  one cannot help but be
 
struck by the apparently extreme poverty in which you were living,
 
particularly that Almanac house in the end.

BLH:
 That got worse after I left.
 It was getting bad and I took the
 
summer off.
 I had a fuss with Can ton Sprague Smith and quit the
 
library, so I was out of work and that was hard on us.  Hadn't found
 
another job yet and I got a letter from my old director in Michigarnme,
 
Michigan,  inviting me to come and counsel at the camp that summer.
 
thought it would be a nice thing to do.
 I was kind of tired of the
 
city, the group was falling apart and there weren't any bookings any-
way.
 So, we had a me
.eting and we decided that I would go.
 I felt
 
kind of bad about leaving the group;  it was really down to Butch,
 
Gordon and Sis.  But there really wasn't enough work for us to keep
 
alive anyway at that point.

So,  I went off in the summmer -
-
 I think it was  '42 -
-
 and spent the
 
summer up in Northern Michigan;  it was a lovely summer,  I must say.
 
I came back to New York and found that they had moved from the loft
 
apartment intb another one.
 It was really pretty awful,  and I think
 
they had been through some very hard periods there.
 Then Arthur had
 
sort of come on the scene, I think while I was gone.
 Arthur and
 
Charlie Polaohek.
 They had
 changed the style of the group.
 
They were more political than musically interested,
 didn't come from
 
the southern tradition.
 Charlie was just learning to play, Arthur
 
never played at all, anything.  He had a good big voIce;  a good sort
 
of bass voice.
 But, the group was pretty weak still.  They managed to
 
get bookings in Detroit through the UAW and made a tour out there  during
 
which period Butch and I fell in love and decided to get married.
 
It was a very rough tour when we got out there.
 We had been hired by
 
the International union and when we got there we discovered that the

It was a rough tour,  even though we didn't hit the worst of the locals.
 
We still got a very very mixed response from a lot of them.
 The
 
Coughlinites were very strong at that period in Detroit.
 We ended up
 
singing at the UAW Convention,  or supposed to sing;  as I recall, we

BLH:
 Yes.  We had just barely scrabbled.
 Butch wrote the UAW/CIO at
 
that point and that's what pulled us through frankly (laughing).  The
 
older repetoire, the union repetoire was pretty out (laughing).
 
DD:
 There was the  'no strike pledge.'
 
BLH:
 Right.
 It was a very very difficult period because we didn't
 
have enough songs.  Woody had,  fortunately, written those two good
 
oil workers songs.
 
DD:  "Boomtown Bill."
 
BLH:
 Yes.  And "The Oil Town Drillers, Come Listen To Me, Going To
 
Tell You A Story About Old John D, The Company Union Made A Fool Out
 
Of Me Me Me," that one.
 It was a good song.  We had those that we
 
could use and then the general war song repetoire,  "Taking It Easy"
 
and those.  But  there was a hell of a lot of people asking for "The
 
Talking Union."  We were heckled on that all the time.

BLH:
 So we were caught in the middle, yes.
 
DD:
 And if you wouldn't sing it, people would...
 
BLH:
 Oh, we got a lot of heckling, yes.
 At the UAW Convention, we
 
went by a record stand and they were selling "Talking Union" and I
 
saw a guy come up and say,  "I want that song..." and he quoted some
 
lines from "Talking Union," and bought the record and when he turned
 
away, I saw he had KKK tatooed on his arm.
 
DD:
 What you're suggesting,  if I understand you correctly,  is that the
 
right wing conservative forces had a vested interest?
 
BLH:
 Exactly.  The right wing conservative forces were taking up the
 
position of striking during the war.  (tape ended)
 
Tape 4

DD:
 I'm
 glad that you told me that because that was some-
thing missing from my experience.
 I always looked very negatively on
 
that, the anti-strike period there.
 
BLH:
 We felt somewhat torn about it, but it had clearly become so
 
politicized when we were out there, that we were scared to sing any of
 
those songs because we would be identifying ourselves with the Black
 
Legion movement if we sang them.
 I didn't feel, myself, that that
 
repetoire deserved to be sunk,  I thought it was good stuff and I thought
 
that the union should keep their guard up in a sense.

generally felt that way.  But, as I say,  it had become, particularly in
 
Detroit withCoughlin right there.
 It had become the 1 rallying call of
 
the right sing.  And a really rather dangerous right wing.
 I mean, I
 
don't mind people being conservative, but people that  go around ,
v
ith
 
KKK tatooed on them, I think are not the kind I wish to sing for (laughing)
 
DD:
 That's going to bring us into the area of the organizational
 
arrangements and before we get there,ItI like to see if you couldn't
 
confirm for me a couple of stories that I heard about the Almanacs.
 
Such as the one about Mill losing the manuscript to "Hard Hitting Songs'
 
in Patterson, New Jersey.
 Had you heard about that at all?
 
BLH:
 That sort of rings a bell,  but I don't know what happened.
 
DD:
 Pete and Toshi told me.
 And  Woody wrote a whole cartoon book
 
about Mill Fillmore?
 
BLH:
 (laughing)
 Again, I think that's perfectly true (laughing).
 
DD:
 Is that what you used to call him?
 Or only in the...
 
BLH:
 It was part of the kidding that went on between the group,  it
 
was quite friendly.  Woody and Mill, I think, there was a lot of pretty
 
deep tension between them, but it was kept on a social kidding level.
 
DD:
 I think this is from your period
 about Woody and Mill going up
 
to a big studio, an agency, I believe it was, they were trying to get
 
a job and Woody was playing his harmonica and sitting in the corner and

.
Mill was saying, "Don't mind that fellow over there,, he's just playing
 
the harmonica."  Woody kept playing the harmonica and Mill would say,
 
"Ssh, quiet,  don't you realize this is big business we're going on here?"
 
Woody would keep playing and finally Mill told Wood  to be quiet one too
 
many times and Woody just got very mad,
 threatened to kill him,  said
 
he wanted to go buy a gun.
 
BLH:
 I don't recall it, but it doesn't sound out of the realm of
 
possibility at all.

Part!cularl', Mill would come in with song ideas
 
that Woody thought were junky and would say so.
 And  Mill would get
 
very mad about it.
 It caused some of our most interesting discussions
 
I would think.  That particular tension between the two of them sort
 
of dramatized one of the problems that we were working with all of the
 
time.  There was one song that came up very early in the war period,
 
I'm trying to remember what it was now.
 It was one of Mill's sort of
 
typically 'cute' songs, it was catchy and funny and Woody just hated
 
it.
 He consented to sing it finally, because he thought that it
 
ought to be said, but he disliked it.
 It was the song about converting
 
to the war effort and there was a verse in it,  "Elizabeth Arden ain't
 
got no inhibitions,  instead of making lipstick, she's making ammunition.
 
No more business as usual, we got unusual business to do."  Woody j
ust
 
thought it was complete junk (laughing).
 It was a clever song,  it was
 
a catchy song, and everybody thought it was funny and we used it quite

a lot and woody was really disgusted with it.
 
DD:
 For the reasons you've explained?
 
BLH:
 For the reasons I
've explained.
 He then  wrote the one about
 
"Taking It Easy" in an attempt to write the same kind of song, but in
 
the way that he thought it ought to be.
 If you remember the song,  it
 
had a human factor very much involved in it.
 Girl meeting a boy in
 
an air raid shelter kind of thing.  We had to stop using that for an
 
interesting reason:
 The Civil Defense people said that they didn't
 
like the song because it was about taking it easy and people were
 
getting top casual about air raids and things and they really wanted
 
them to be a little more worried and get the heck into the bomb shelter
 
(langhin ).

BLH:
 Woody's response to the whole problem of the topical song -
-
 he
 
felt we really ought to make songs that would last
 eyond ten minutes
 
(laughing).
 He was continually frustrated by the curves of history
 
which were wiping out our repetoire and making it nox
fi-suitable for
 
singing.  He really wanted to write songs that would last for a while.
 
So, in one of his attempts to explain his point of view on this, he
 
did a parody on a humerous song that he remembered from his youth.
 
About a young man who had a bad reputation, that was the tag line.  He
 
wrote a song
 "On Account Of That New Situation" that expressed
 
his point of view on it.  The only verse I recall, went:  "I started
 
a
 
out to write/song to the entire population, and soon as I got the words
 
wrote down, here come a brand new situation."  There were about four
 
other verses,  all more or less to the same rhyme.
 
This was another kind of case in point where he thought he had written
 
a constructive song about the air raid situation and it went out.
 
DD:
 I wanted to ask you about an incident at a convention at the
 
Waldorf Astoria.  Woody and Pete and Sis had apparantly gone there one
 
night to sing anti-facist songs in the spring before Woody and Pete
 
left the group to go to war.
 It turned out it was a group of business-
and
 
men/they were all full of thoughts about war profiteering and what big
 
contracts would be coming through.  And all of a sudden right in the
 
middle of the evening, Pete had lost his temper and just started screaming
 
at the crowd, "Don't you realize our boys are dieing over there?"  And
 
finally Woody just stepped up to the microphone -
-
 and someone had
 
shouted in response, "Why don't you sing '
She'll Be Coming 'Round The
 
Mountain When She Comes'?"  And Woody in turn had come up to the micro-
phone and said,  "Let me take the next verse" and started singing as

Pete was finally cooling off.
 He came up to the mike and filled the
 
room with his own version,  "And she'll be wearing a union button when
 
she comes."
 
BLH:
 No doubt.
 I heard about that, but I was not there.
 But, it was
 
the sort of thing that we ran  into a lot.
 Audiences  were not always
 
extremely receptive.
 I remember vividly singing one of the -

later petiod when we were using a varied. repetoire -

 I .as singing,
 
"Pity The Down Hard Trodden Landlord" to a group that I later found out
 
was the Landlord's Convention (laughing).  We had just gotten a bookirg
 
there and that was one of the songs so we sang it (laughing).
 
received by some degree of coolness by the audience.
 
It was
 
DD:
 Do ynii  re
]1  the famous party at Mark Warner's where Woody stole
 
a drape and allegedly silverware  too?  Borrowed,would perhaps  be a
 
better term.
 
BLH:
 No, again, I heard about it.  That I think  did  happen.  Woody was
 
deeply frustrated over the continual conflict of his life.
 Which was
 
that he knew he was good enough to make it, and he couldn't stand to
 
make it with the people that had the money- so that he would be able to
 
make it.
 I think he really wanted to be the major figure that he felt
 
he could be, but he never could tolerate the kind of people that he had
 
to perform for under those circumstances.
 I think that's why he tried
 
radio so often, at least they wouldn't be there.  They might be listening
 
but they wouldn't be there physically.  He had a real visceral reaction
 
to anything like wealth.
 In fact, anything like normal comfort was...

After Butch and I got married, he came over to see us one night and
 
after he left, Butch and I turned to each other and both of us said
 
simultaneously,  "Did you see Woody empty that ash tray?"
 I think it
 
was the first time that either one of us ever saw him do anything so
 
directly caring for property.
 It was very striking to us.
 He was sort
 
of a romantic proletarian in this sense.
 He actually tended to destroy
 
property.
 I don't mean that he tore things up exactly, but he would
 
put his feet all over your furniture.
 It was kind of defiant.
 It
 
was, "I'm the real thing and you're not,  and this is my contempt for
 
all of your possessions and your wealth," even if we didn't have much.

but partly it came out of pretty real feelings.  When I first met
 
Woody, way back before he ever joined the Almanacs; his table manners
 
and his personal manners were really offensive.
 He
 deliberately
 
went out of the way to make a continual non-verbal statement that he
 
came from the lower classes, and he knew better than that,  it was a
 
pose.  Everybody barked at him about it all the time.
 He was kind of
 
uncontrollable in a situation where there really was wealth.
 
DD:
 Do you remember any?
 
BLH:
 He was a very torn kind of man.
 I remember one night in the loft
 
place.
 I had the flu  and an absolutely raging fever and it was Satur-
day night.
 I couldn't go out on the bookings.  Woody, who was feeling
 
morose or something, announced that he was going to stay home himself.

we really understood.
 I remember being on one union booking one time
 
up
 
and having an older =
on man come/and ask me afterwards whether I
 
belonged to a union and I said, "No, I didn't."
 He said,  "Does your
 
folks?"
 I said, "No."  He said,  "Well did any of you kids ever have
 
any union experience?"
 I said,  "No,I don't think so." He said,  "That's
 
very interesting because I don't understand why you feel the way you
 
feel." I tried to explain it to him and he said,  "Well,  I think there's
 
one thing I ought to tell you.  When we go to a union meeting, we always
 
dress up."
 We talked about that for a long time afterwards.
 I think
 
it was a very revealing moment to us because we hadn't thought about
 
ourselves in any sense except that we were going to go and sing.
 And
 
that we were making any kind of statement beyond that,  what  v
e had to
 
say, I think was something that we really hadn't thought about at all.
 
We a1w ys wore whatever we haDDened to have at the moment.  Everybody
 
was poor and everybody was...
 but we weren't poor in the sense of the
 
people we were talking to.
 
They were poor and didn't want to be poor.
 We were poor and didn't
 
notice it.
 
DD:
 Right, again, the intellectual...
 
BLH:
 Right,  exactly.
 It wasn't that we were trying to look poor, we
 
were (laughing).
 I was always in a hassle because I al ays had jobs
 
and I had to spend more money for clothes than anybody else-in order
 
to maintain a job.  But, we hadn't thought of ourselves as dressing up
 
or dressing down, dressing anyway in particular.  We had the same kind

 I need to go over, really briefly, because I realize it's getting

 Because I thi n
k that's
 
an important area to discuss, at least to cover.  What exactly was the
 
concept of political songs that the Almanacs were working with?  Was it
 
one that varied from period to period, or did it have a continuous
 
albeit organic statement?
 
BLH:
 What do you mean by "political songs?'
 
DD:
 We talked-earlier about the difference between  Jim Garland writing
 
had
 
a song and the Almanacs.
 And the Almanacs,  obviously,/adopted a tradi-
tion that they were trying to recreatewith a great deal more success
 
than their parents  in the case of Pete,
 the Composer's Collective
 
ten years before.

BLH:
 We thought about developing songs that people could learn.
 We
 
thought about songs within particular areas of usage.  That is, we
 
occasionally
-
tried to write songs that could be sung at demonstraticns
 
or at picket lines  a
 song that people could learn
 
very quickly and that didn't have very much in the line of text.
 I
 
remember our trying to come up with that kind of song deliberately.
 
"We Shall Not Be Moved" was the kind of song we had in
 
mind, that people learned and sang in on
. immediately.  We thought about
 
songs for passing information along also.
 There were a lot of structures
 
of songs that we thought about.  We thought about zippers songs as a
e
 
called them.  Where you could take the same song and zip one word out
 
and zip in another one, so that they were sort of infinitely flexible.
 
You could take a song in support of a candidate,  and sing it for another
 
candidate in another borough during an election.  We thought about songs
 
for improvisation where ae could put in topical verses or take them out
 
or make them up to suit the particular occassion.  We had several songs
 
of that kind that we used deliberately in that way to try to personalize
 
these songs so that they spoke to particular local issues.  We did a lot
 
of composing songs about towns for that reason.  There were a number of
 
songs, Pittsburg, N w York City and Chicago and various other city songs
 
that we worked on.
 There was always an attempt to leave songs behind
 
in that sense, to make up things that spoke to people's particular in-
terests in the hopes that they would remember them, in whole or in part.
 
We thought about songs that people could come in on.
 Songs .ith easy
 
choruses.
 I think we did a better job than most groups in constructing
 
programs in that sense.
 Our programs were talked about ahead of time,

to
 
with not too many solo performances.
 Always something that the audience
 
knew already, that they could sing with us on.  We'd do "Solidarity  or
 
"We Shall Not Be Moved" or a spiritual,  or something that everybody could
 
sing on right away.
 Always a song with a good chorus that people could
 
learn or be taught very quickly.  Usually some song that had to do with
 
specific problem of that particular group.
 If we didn't have one, we'd
 
make it up,  or we'd adapt another song for it.  The programs were very
 
carefully thought about in that sense.
 
I think that Pete kept that sense of structure in his own concerts and
 
developed it even further.
 I remember he talked to me once about
 
using cultural guerilla ,tactics in his concerts,
 which I
'm
 
sure he's  v
ritten about.  That he would sing a certain number of songs
 
and then slide one in that had a really strong point to it.  (end of tape)

BLH:We tried to analyze the function of song within a group and to an
 
audience and structured our
 programs that way.
 So that we really
 
didn't have stars because  we really didn't have that many solo songs.
 
"John Doe" was one of the few really solo songs that ever came out of
 
the group, and a couple of Woody-I
s that were also more effectively
 
sung -in solo.  We didn't have the star problem for that reason because
 
most of the songs,  one or another of us could take the lead enough, if
 
there was going to be a good chorus with everybody in on it.  We didn't
 
have the necessity to have a part of the show be for our star singer
 
who could carry it all by himself.
 And, we were very good at ipvolving
 
in
 
audiences.
 One of the places that we fell down  was/not analyzing

audiences properly.  We were really bringing in only one part of the
 
cultural spectrum.  We talked about that from time to time, particularly
 
in connection with the ILGWU repetoire,  which we were trying to decide
 
whether to adopt or not.
 You know,  "Horse With The Union Label" and
 
all those songs, which were not our thing, and came out of a different...
 
DD:
 A show tradition.
 
BLH:
 They were
 show tradition.
 The lesser known songs came out of
 
the Central European tradition, the Yiddish tradition.
 We picked up
 
one of them that we sang quite a lot,  "He's A Fool For Not Joining The
 
Union,"  v
hich hardly anybody else ever remembers anymore, but it's a
 
great tune and we could do that one pretty well because it was a folk
 
tune.
 
But, because
 of o u r  h.ck roiind, because of our basic musical
 
repetoire, the songs we carried in our heads that we  v
ent back to all
 
the time,
 we were really in a position of singing to cultural groups
 
that didn't have that repetoire;  so our stuff was really from another
 
tradition,  it was hard for them to sing our songs.
 I don't think b
ye
 
recognized that enough, hof
l
' different it  v
as.  How different the Yiddish
 
use of the minor scale which we rarely sang in,  because that's not very
 
important in southern Appalachia and southwestern. We'd sing modal tunes,
 
but rarely straight minor ones.
 I think we didn't really recognize
 
that we were bringing in essentially an alien tradition and laying it on
 
people and expecting them to be able to perform with us.
 
They were very nice about it and did it, but  we would have had a much
 
better effect,  I think, much more the 6ffect we wanted if .e had been
 
more culturally sensitive.

DD:
 Do you think there's a political element in that at all?
 In the
 
sense that you basically had started out with a formulation of what
 
was important to sing about and created your songs around that and then
 
found yourselves among audiences where that initial struggle had differing
 
significance.
 
BLH:
 I don't think so, I don't think that was the problem.
 I think
 
it  as a straight cultural problem.
 I -think we were in the wrong city.
 
I think if we had been singing in the south, in southern industrial
 
centers, we probably would have been killed (laughing).
 Maybe
 
in big centers in the mid.vest where there was beginning to be an
 
influx of Appalachans,
 we would have had more cultural success.
 But,
 
in New York,  we were basically singing, when we were doing union singing
 
I'm thinking ahniit now -
-
 we were basically singing to the ILGWU and the
 
Transport Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, and they were
 
mostly Central European immigrants or Irish immigrants.
 
Now, the one time I can think of that we really tried to make a cultural
 
tie-in was when we wrote the song for the Transport Workers Union and
 
sang at a big rally.  Mike Quinn was the president.
 Pete deliberately
 
went '
out of his way to think of a standard tune and to give it a kind
 
of Irish touch, on the grounds that most of those folks were Irish and
 
that's what they would like to hear.
 That's one of the few -
times I can
 
think of that we really -
thought about that part of the problem.  This
 
was because of our limited background, really.  Woody came out of a
 
strong south.estern tradition, I came out of a strong southwestern
 
tradition, Pete had gone through and learned it and so had Butch and

Pete Hawes.
 And Sis came out of it.
 We were really a regional group,
 
i
e thought  v
e v
.ere speaking for all America, but we weren't.
 
DD:
 That's a very interesting issue.  There's a lot really to be ex-
plored in that because I
've heard it raised in different context.
 In
 
fact, Pete was critized  in the left and in the labor unions at a later
 
time because they felt he was too American for New York City.
 I also
 
have a feeling that it also comes out of the social context.
 For
 
instance,  Earl Robinson  was very conscious of writing the Browderistic
 
slogan of the late '
30's in which the whole left wing movement was
 
trying to situate itself in Americana.
 To
 find American
 
socialist
 
heros instead of the distant
 heros of the/mother land.  The
 
then
 
whole Almanac thrust/ seems to me to be
 a culmination of finally
 
finding American roots for topical song.
 
BLH:
 I think that was part of it, but I think it was also going on in
 
a bigger way.
 I was talking to Alan about this the other day.
 That
 
there was a sort of 50 to 7
5 year stretch in there where the whole
 
society ,
as trying to find an American identity.  We .ere trying to
 
develop a national repetoire, we were trying to become a nation.
 I
 
think this went on from the Civil War on,  in a kind of very vague under
 
current s
''elling kind of feeling.
 
DD:
 But there aas an instant recognizable pop culture.
 George M..
 
Cohan was American music,  and I think people  pretty consciously identi-
fied with that.
 
BLH:
 
Yes.
 The pop people did it much better, I think they were faster

at it.
 Folks move  very slowly in cultural movements (laughing).
 They
 
hang on to their old stuff.
 It's interesting.
 
I see what's happening now in terms of increased demand.
 
We've got a national repetoire and we're not very
 
interested in it any more.  We would like to develop our own specialties:
 
local, cultural, regional, racial, whatever.
 
DD:
 It's like the national regional history movement of the 1920's.
 
BLH:
 Right.  We want to get back into our own little groups and stop
 
worrying about all this other stuff.  We've got to act now, that's
 
settled.
 Americans can all get together in the same place and sing
 
the same songs.  When it turns out to be the Coca Cola song,  we don't

on very deeply at that time.
 
DD:
 For a moment here, as we're closing things up,  I
'd like to talk
 
about the Almanacs vis-a-vis the left in their era.
 I know Pete told
 
me he had been a member of the YCL and the ASU, as I mentioned to you.
 
And Lee was very close to Mother Bloor
 and had  worked for a very
 
long time v
vith CP organizers, and Mill I realize lived with someone who
 
was an active CP organizer.  How do you think those ties, which were
 
real ties,  affected their repetoire?
 
BLH:
 Curiously enough, I don't think it affected it very much, except
 
that the ties and the contact kept people thinking about political

issues a great deal.
 I don't ever recall anybody's ever coming back
 
from a meeting and saying,  "We got to write a song about this."
 it
 
wasn't anything direct.  We sang at a number of Communist Party meetings,
 
and we viewed it pretty much the same way we did any other booking, in
 
terms of picking out repetoire that would speak to the interests of that
 
particular group.
 But, there was no cell
 -
 concerned with the
 
Almanacs, so far as I know, at least I never ran into that.
 
DD:
 Club?
 
BLH:
 Club, or anything else.
 If and where people were members of
 
groups, they went off and went to their own meetings.
 It was not any-
thing that was part of the organization as an organization.
 
DD:
 Right,but it was -
-
 from your description I have a feeling it was
 
a strange kind of organization, the Almanac singers.
 It was more a
 
group of people.  What I
'm curious to know is the extent to which -
-
it's simplistic to think that someone gives orders so that other people
 
respond to an order.
 If you were a highly placed
 cadre  in the CP,
 
that might have been your situation.
 I don't believe that any of you
 
were at all associated on that level.
 But, there was the Daily Worker,
 
there was the New Masses. 
Have you ever criticized or analyze
 your
 
own relation to the evolution that the Communist Party went through in
 
that time?
 
BLH:
 I was not politically tied in at that time to anybody.
 I had been
 
a member of the ASU and also the YCL for a brief period in college.
 
didn't join any political groups in New York.

this with Woody who had told me that he didn't think he had discipline
 
enough to be a member of a political group.
 He was thinking at the time
 
about.joiring the Communist Party and decided that he was not di sciplined
 
and would not be a good member.
 - 
DD:
 He wouldn't have been?
 
BLH:
 He wouldn't have been.
 I think that Pete probably was,  I remember
 
Pete going off to meetings.
 I remember going to meetings myself from
 
time to time, but always on a casual basis to hear a speaker or something
 
like that.
 I was too busy, that was my rationale at the time. I really
 
was.
 I was working full time and singing almost every night and working
 
with the group.
 I really didn't have time to do anything in the nature
 
of community activity or political activity,  although every once in a
 
while, we would go and pass out leaflets,  or something,  but we mostly
 
didn't have the time.
 From what I heard from Pete, the position that
 
the Party took at that point towards us was that we were doing a good
 
job and should be left alone to do it, and not bugged with doing any-
thing else in a political line.
 So that we were not called up,  for
 
example and asked to do routine political work like other people who
 
were sympathetic or members were constantly being asked to do.
 
We would be called and asked to sing at a rally,  or something like that,
 
but it was that sort of relationship.
 We were treated as working within
 
our own particular area of specialization.

BLH:
 Well, it depends on what you want to get into further along this
 
line.
 I really don't know that I know that much.
 I think it should be
 
said that the Communist Party at that period was an extremely open and
 
up-front organization.  We were also, by the way, invited by other various
 
groups within the left, and they were also very up-front and political.
 
DD:
 Would you play for the  Lovestoneites in the left?
 
BLH:
 No, I don't think we were ever asked.
 If we had been,  I imagine
 
we would have had to have an organization meeting to discuss whether we
 
should accept or not.
 If I
'm not mistaken, we did sing for the Socialists
 
and we sang at a number of sort of things where everybody was there.
 All
 
the variant groups, Trotskyites,
 etc., depending on the particular
 
period, whether they were working together on the cause or not.
 It was
 
perfectly routine within the left at that point because it was an open
 
period.
 As you say, the papers were coming out and there were local
 
clubs that had signs out.
 
DD:
 I guess what I
'm  pointing to  is that the positions
 
which the group took -
-
 the public positions -
-
 limited
 
the amount of response and work you .
vere going to get in the v
arious s
ectors
 
of the left at that time.
 Clearly, the Socialist Party was not going
 
to ask you to sing peace songs at their meeting.
 by
 
and
 
making those decisions --/that particular decision you all made before
 
you formed together as a group -
-
 was proclaiming an identification with
 
one of the left, the Communists.

mean, it's conceivable that you could have kept singing the peace songs,
 
you could have kept singing "Talking Union."
 
BLH:
 Yes,  I think that's true.  We certainly had our own political
 
discussions, and rather strong ones, in which we decided what our
 
repetoire v
as going to be.  We discussed the issues as we saw them and
 
generally speaking, though there was a lot of individual variation, I
 
think that we sang a repetoire that basically followed that particular
 
part of the left wing at that time.
 Not exactly followed, but was
 
congenial to that particular part of the left wing at that time.
 Those
 
decisions, however, I think it's important to realize,  were made  v
ithin
 
the group,  and were pretty intensely debated.  Most of us felt, I think,
 
that we .ere really not smart enough politically.
 I certainly did,  I
 
think Woody did too.  Woody had a kind of inchoate emotional identifica-
tion  and
 .
 feeling;, he was continually trying to find where the folks
 
were in this spectrum of possibilities.
 
D
ID:
 What kind of tensions came about from the fact that there  v
ere
 
some members of your group who had pretty clearly identified organiza-
tional arrangements,
 but
 your group, as a whole,  was a bunch of
 
individuals trying to decide policy.
 It's an important point.
 
BLH:
 Yes,  it is,  it is.
 And  it's one that I don't know how to describe
 
too well.
 We were trying to keep together a whole group of extremely
 
tense and creative people.
 If you think about it, almost no musical
 
group in our culture last very long any ay, because of artistic tensions
 
and the kind of personality structure that artists have, in our culture
 
at least.

political problem and it was a hot political time.  There were a lot of
 
things happening, and a lot of different positions coming out continually.
 
An awful lot, I think,  was sacrificed to simply keeping the group together.
 
We were working very hard to keep some kind of unififd core that we could
 
hold onto

the group was in danger of fragmenting over this issue.

 But  they in turn felt pressure from their o n contacts.

 Yes,  I

 Those of us who were not particularly

 if we
 
felt it was something that the rest of the group felt very strongly
 
about and
 
very
 
deeply about.

going on,
 very subtly,
 because it was a very difficult period to
 
do anything in, really,  from that point of view.  We were trying to keep
 
an overall goal in front of us all of the time.
 It wouldn't surprise
 
me if one of the reasons that Mill and Alan sort of pulled out was that
 
they felt that the group .
vas  getting a little too wishy-washy for them
 
politically, that it wasn't making the kinds of statements that they
 
felt needed to be made at that particular point.
 
This was,  if I'm not mistaken, at the time  e were moving more into
 
Norking  ith unions and developing more and more of the labor repetoire.

 No, no, I don't think so.
 But  I think they felt that we were

 An interesting point here.
 Mill obviously- was coming from a slightly
 
different context at this point and you perhaps could feel,  "Here is a

personality response.  What happened Nhen Pete came back  with that
 
response?  He came back from a meeting and said...
 
BLH:
 Pete, I think, was always basically more thoughtful than Mill.
 I
'm
 
not sure that's fair.
 I think Mill has been jumped on a lot.
 I think
 
it was, as much as anything, a question  of style with Mill.
 But, Pete
 
being an extraordinary creative person, would tend to take a problem
 
and try to think of something that was really interesting and innovative
 
and exciting to do about it, and do with it.  Mill didn't have that kind
 
of creativity.  Mill was a good ad man, and that's a special kind of
 
talent.
 It's very very very useful,  if you want to do that kind of
 
thing.
 But  Pete never wanted to do it either.
 Pete wanted to explore
 
the possibilities of songs, he was always thinking about that.

When Pete would come in with something that he thought we ought to be
 
doing,  it was always on a level of discussion that more appealed to
 
Woody, than Mill's kind of straight political sort of thing.

 But Pete was not immune to the same currents that moved.
 
BLH:
 Oh no, no.  What I
'm saying was that his ideas were always much
 
more interesting.

 It would he less routine.
 Pete would take a problem and.

Tape 5
, side 2
 
BLH:
 It would kick something off that he would have been thinking about
 
before in terms of a new kind of song we could develop,  or a new use of
 
instruments,  or a different vocal arrangement we could get together.
 
Mill would come in with a nice slick song already done, more or less,
 
and would respond on that kind of ad man style.
 Pete would come in with
 
a notion that we ought to do a song about this or that or that -
there is
 
this kind of problem, but with a whole different kind of approach so
 
that you could get more interested in doing it,  instead of just having
 
to sit down and learn another song.
 Pete's subjects were bigger too,
 
his topics were bigger.
 
DD:
 -
 If  someone said,
 
"Hey, we need a song about this and it would be nice if it could be
 
constructed in time for the big rally next week," -
 you would
 
do. it more or less constantly, responding to popular causes and the
 
development of the left all around you.  But  when Pete would respond,
 
would he not  respond to the immediate or  would he only respond to the
 
general?
 
BLH:
 Pete's a creative thinker.
 I don't know what was going on at that

time, but just hypothesizing;  if he would go to a Party meeting or a
 
Marxist discussion,  or a lecture on Len nism, or something; Pete is
 
the kind of person who would think about that and then come up with
 
some kind of creative observation of how that idea works in terms of
 
the subway system.  He really is a thinking man and I think that is
 
one of the reasons that he is such a significant figure.
 He is thinking
 
about things all the time.
 
I remember driving with him one time,  we were in a car and ae went over
 
a long secion of some sort of grated road surface, there was some sort
 
of metal grating that we hit on this road and the pitch of the tires
 
if you
 
went way up.
 Pete started speculating about how you could,/learned how
 
this worked,
 you could grade the surface of the road so that you could
 
play a tune on coming into the city (laughing).
 That would be the right
 
song to put you in the right mood, and you'd have a sign out that would
 
say,  "Hit this at 42 mph and it will..'(laughing).
 He's constantly
 
germinating things like that.  A lot of them crazy, a lot of them you
 
throw out of your head immediately, but he always responded that way.
 
With some kind of slightly off-base observation that made what he had
 
to say and his ideas always very interesting.
 You might throw them out
 
in three minutes flat as being impractical.  But, there was something
 
there to think about artistically.
 
Whereas Mill's input  '
as political,
 Pete's input was artistic,  it was
 
creative.
 Pete is never the kind of person who would say,  "we have to
 
write a song about the United Front."  That kind of thing would never
 
come out of Pete's head, that's not his style.  He would say,  "You know,
 
we've got to figure out how to get people cooperating in a different
 
kind of way.  Maybe it's like when kids get through school (I'm impro-
vising now) and they're walking home and they run ahead of each other

and then somebody gets mad  and starts throwing gravel.
 Then they have
 
a little fuss and what is it that happens in there so that they all get
 
home in a good frame of mind.  That's what we ought to be thinking about."
 
He would go at things in his kind of obliqueish way.
 So that  with Pete
 
we almo3t never discussed politics,
 except on a
 daily paper basis.
 
You know
 when you're having breakfast and you're
 
reading the headlines.
 
DD:
 I have a number of historical criticisms and they're very cheap
 
criticisms.
 I say cheap, meaning that they don't cost me to make the
 
criticism, because they're not my struggle and they're not my time.
 
If you wanted to try S
JJS, you'd probably have equal or greater success
 
in doing that.
 I'm trying to estimate what the political effect was
 
of the
 existing. ready. top-down line,
 if it wasn't a fiat that
 
the Almanacs had to follow like some robot has to follow,
 
at least it was accessible,  it was clear.
 As Charles Seeger himself
 
describes his own experience in the early 1930's,  it was clear what was
 
being said and what positions were being taken.
 You had to be blind
 
not to see it because it was there,  it was accessible.
 
BLH:
 And it was up front.
 
DD:
 Right,  it was up front.
 Your artistic creation pretty much had
 
to respond to that because those were your audiences.
 It seems to me
 
that in some cases you created a very limiting context to your creation.
 
BLH:
 Probably, but we didn't set out to do anything very much more than

that.
 I think we talked about it mostly in terms of our other rep toire
 
our non political repetoire.  Because we all had a lot of songs that
 
we liked very much, and we were all learning songs a lot.
 How, when
 
and how much to use those, was/continual matter of  iscussjon. Because
 
when the Almanacs were sitting around at home we would be more likely
 
singing,  "Keep my skillet good and greasy all the time, time, time,"
 
or some of Leadbelly songs,  or whatever, and thinking about what made
 
those good songs in whatever ways we went after it at the time.
 
I remember Lee Hays'
 article on the function of the word "Roll".  We
 
were kicking that kind of thing around all the time.
 So that there was
 
a whole area of our exploration and consideration and design that people
 
don't think of in terms of thinking of the Almanac singers.  We did put
 
out the two albums of  "Sea Shanties" and the other one, which I think
 
held up pretty well, though I haven't heard them in years and years.
 
DD:
 I still play them on the radio sometimes.
 
BLH:
 I think they all felt that there was a discontinuity between .hat
 
we were doing ourselves,  what we were making up ourselves and what we
 
ere feeding on and performing for our own pleasure and occasionally
 
for audiences, and weren't smart enough to see what that discontinuity
 
was.  We never wrote as organic a song as Jim Garland's,  with possibly
 
the exception of the "Reuben James."  That's the one I keep coming back
 
to as one of the most honest songs that we did somehow  or
 other, the
 
most viscercal song.
 Because we were not living the life we sang about,
 
except in sort of an extension.  We were mixing cultural styles,  we were
 
way out in left field,  operating in a peculiar time, responding in a very

naive way to a lot of things that were going on.
 I don't think that we
 
were really that important.
 Except, possibly, some of the things we
 
discovered about good song writing.
 I think we discovered quite a
 
number of things.  But, in terms of effect, I think the effect at the
 
time was minimal.
 
DD:
 That's another question  that comes into it that it seems like at
 
the time the perceived -
-
 particularly in terms of the Party.
 I have
 
a premonition that the function that you  thought your political music
 
was serving,  and  the function that they  thought it was serving
 as
 
different.  They wanted you as spirit raisers and entertainers.
 
BLH:
 Yes, right.
 I think so.  We thought of ourselves as educators
 
and
 
r
11 v qs
 
rtists. not in the refined sense.
 
DD:
 But in a political art.
 
BLH:
 Yes.
 I don't think that was our effect.
 I think we all learned
 
a lot.
 It certainly, I think, changed Pete's career.
 He grew up during
 
the period, I grev up during the period, I learned a lot, I think Woody
 
did.
 I think it had a profound effect on Woody.
 Possibly more than
 
anyone else.
 It kind of socialized him, it gave him a place to be.
 
So that, his later production,  I think was even better than the Almanac
 
period.
 I think his  Maritime Union '
Songs  and particularly his.
 
Washington and Oregon and Cooley Dam  songs were simply superb.
 He
 
couldn't have done that without the Almanac experience,  I don't think.

He would have been too damned individualistic and too ornery and too
 
horrible (laughing).
 I think that's what happened,  if the careers
 
of three,  four or five individuals are important -
-
 that was the im-
portance.
 If you get a Pete and you get a Woody out of it, you've
 
done very well.
 Because they went on later on the basis of this
 
somewhat, I think, ineffective period.
 They learned enough out of it
 
to be extraordinary effective people and rather major artists.
 So, I
 
think it was worth it myself.

group.
 And, with the combination of idealism and willingness to
 
meant
 
sacrifice that being
 in the New York Party/
 the Party  i
as so
 
out of tune.  Even  at that point, many American workers were feeling
 
that operating in that context -
 almost doomed you to a
 
certain limitation.
 
BLH:
 I don't think you're right on that.
 It's difficult to get back
 
to now, but the period itself was a period in which the fights between
 
the various left wing groups were, I think myself, much more on the top
 
level than they ever penetrated through to the bottom level.
 People
 
would call each other names occasionally
 but it didn't have any basis
 
in reality.
 If you were on one side, you would call your opponent a
 
dirty so and so, but it really wasn't true and everybody kind of knew it.

I think in terms of the influence on the Almanacs, the people we were
 
singing to regardless of where we sang,  were pretty much the same kind
 
of folk with pretty much the same kind of concerns.
 It's more on the

DD:  The point I .as going to make  -
-
 this is such a complex issue
 
that it perhaps should be dealt with separat
 
was
 
not that there was prior restraint, albeit I suspect that there was a
 
certain degree of  v
hat
 journalist would want to call prior restraint,
 
-
-
 because really your individual pri
-or
 
restraint didn't effect it that much
 
there was
 
culture there and that was the context under which you operated,
 
ended up with your singing to those  who in large measure  were going
 
to have a certain,  almost predictable response to your message.  Even
 
when you were cut singing to the Transit Workers Unions in Madison
 
Square Garden, nobody said,  "You have to sing this one, you can't sing
 
that one."  But.  that was the most admirable and
 fli
.ki h
 
part.
 There was a giant mass movement potential there, but somehow
 
it could not occurr. -
 I
'm not holding the Almanac singers responsible
 
for that in any way that would be ridiculous.
 But  I
'm suggesting that
 
that context in some way limited your ability to get response, because
 
your definition of the people was a predetermined definition.
 
BLH:
 I think that's true.
 I have wondered myself, what would have
 
happened if we had really moved outside of New York City.  We did take
 
a couple of tours,  but, the base line of the organization was always
 
New York.
 As I say, culturally speaking,  I think we were in the arong
 
part of the country.
 Plus,  at the same time, I don't think we would
 
have, probably, produced the same songs outside of New York City because
 
the audience
 accepted them.
 We would have been responding
 
to different social movements in different parts of the country.

I think other parts of the country, we would have had either a much
 
more limited audience than ,
ie had in New York,  or we would have had to
 
develop a very different kind of repetoire.i
 quite possibly  not as
 
outspokenly left.
 I think New York was a very special place at that
 
time and when we toured, I think we more or less again sang to the
 
converted.
 
DD:
 Right, to the groups that had been pre-assembled in each...
 
BLH:
 Right.
 It's as Pete found, of course,  when he was doing his
 
national tours in much later years,  a general audience is a very
 
different kind of thing.
 A general audience simply comes to hear a
 
concert.  He developed very different kinds of repetoires and very
 
for that audi nce.  When Pete came back
 
from the Army, he .
vas a very different man, by the way.
 He had
 
matured, physically, as I say.  He was an infinitely stronger singer,
 
he was physically vibrant.
 He had always been tense, lean and boney.
 
Those years of intense physical activity had put some weight on him,
 
he .
iasn't that kind of fragile figure that he had been before and he
 
was physically hard as nails.
 
He was also,  a simply superb singer.  He had worked in Army camps all
 
over the place to all kinds of audiences.
 He had learned an awful lot
 
about presentation and he came back with the People's Songs idea in his
 
head, and the same burning dedication that he had always had.  But now
 
with a much broader view of what the United States was like and that's
 
why he wanted to do People's Songs.  He wanted to have a real national--
he had a real national objective in mind whereas before,  it had been

really much smaller.
 
DD:
 Did you sense a personal change in him too?
 
BLH:
 Oh yes, very strong, very strong.  Maturity really.  Experience,
 
he'd seen some of the world,  seen an awful lot of different kinds of
 
people, had inter'acted with a lot of different kinds of people.  The
 
Almanac world, as you say,  v
as somewhat sheltered in that sense.
 Pete
 
had grown up in sophistication enormously.
 I think we all did during
 
the 5
var,  it was a sobering experience.
 He was still the same old Pete,
 
with the incredibly creative and imaginative and humerous mind, but,
 
much broader, a much broader person.  The war experience besides, I
 
think it's difficult for people who are not of the generation to realize

 it had an enormous emo-
tional effect on Americans.
 It was a unifying experience, that was
 
tremendously important.  You began to feel that there were possibly
 
ways in  i
hich people with varying points of view could get together.
 
I notice it when I see old war movies on television, they're almost
 
nostalgic for me (laughing).
 I sit there and think,  "How can I enjoy
 
reliving this experience when I have such a horror and detastation of
 
what's going on in Korea or South Viet Nam,  or wherever it's going on."
 
But, that is certainly why I feel that that period was a period when
 
Americans found out that they could get together and they could put a
 
social objective above their own individual preferences and feelings
 
and political positions
 That was a very very important thing for us
 
to go through.
 It's too damn bad you have to have a war to do it, but...

 Yet, you know, it seems like Pete was already,  in the Almanacs, a
 
very dedicated and hard working cultural gorilla.
 Then, the difference
 
was just that he had more strength to his...
 
BLH:
 He had more strength and he had a bigger idea.
 The Almanacs had
 
been very narro,' I think.
 I think it didn't really hit us how narrow
 
we were at the time.
 I think Pete had a vision that the kind of inner-
group cooperation that had gone on during the war, could be extended
 
beyond that period and that one of the ways of assembling the energy
 
to continue to develop and make a better society, would be song.  He
 
had a bigger idea.  He also, I think, had more of an experience that
 
there were different kinds of people and that these different kinds of
 
people could move together in combinations that hadn't occurred to any-
body much before.
 
Even the existance of all these different kinds of people were -

it possible for him to speak to large audiences.
 
Before,  I don't think he could have.
 But he had a lot of ideas and
 
interesting things to say and interesting songs and a perception of
 
what people wanted and needed.
 He was as open as a sponge himself, he
 
was absorbing things everyday, new ideas, new repetoire.
 He was lis-
tening to African music and listening to all kinds of stuff and re-
working it and it was a terrifically creative period for him.

a very good one.
 I don't think the Almanacs were that terrific, but
 
they made something very terrific happen.  (end of tape)

A SELECTED B
IBLIOGRAPHY:
 
PROTEST SONG IN THE UNITED STATES
 
David King Dunaway
 
University of California at B
erkeley
 
The t
erm "protest song" covers a latitude of musical creation and views of society.
 
A "protest", of course, is an u
tterance of opposition or resistance, "song", a setting
 
o
f a t
ext f
or voice, with or without accompaniment.  Defining the genre, unfortunately,
 
i
s not as easy a task as i
t f
irst appears. A protest song suggests resistance to an
 
abstraction of society--s song which expresses or reflects the spirit of opposition to
 
a social order, past or present.  A l
ament i
s not a protest song unless i
t i
ncludes
 
some f
orm of opposition to the condition depicted.  Nor i
s a work song a protest song,
 
unless t
here i
s more resistance than bitterness to the worker's complaint.
 
Thus, t
he l
iterature on war songs would not be included in this l
isting, except as
 
t
hose songs criticize the military order under which the s
ingers f
ight, or the social
 
s
tructure t
hat created the war.
 I
tems of every i
deology, of course, are included
 
here, as well as song collections which i
nclude p
rotest soncq.  Contemporary composers
 
are r
epresented by a s
ingle collection.  Materials on th e  mu', I  if
 s
rr 1
,1 p
rotc ,i
t are
 
incorporated when they discuss the song f
orm.
 
There i
s considerable variance i
n these stand,r ds .
 "i f

s l
argely uncons lou,s o
f  t
his past.
 
B
ecause many protest songs reflect the s
inger's world view (
and not a
lways the
 
l
isteners'), some have escaped attention, particularly the songs of African-Americans
 
during t
he 1
9th century.  On the other hand, some protests couched i,1 t
he 5uir g
 fr's
 
are practically unsingable, such as those composed by politicalli  n
t! ut
5t
 r
ut
 
classically-trained composers in the 1930s.
