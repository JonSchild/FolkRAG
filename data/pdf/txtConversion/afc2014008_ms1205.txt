On est en novembre 1493  l
e 4 de ce mois, i
a f

a
 
Toussaint r
êcem ment cêlêbrêe est encore dans I
'esprit du
 
célèbre navigateur qui, dêjà a
 son deuxième voyage, aper-
coit de s
a Caraveiie, un a
rchipei s
itué au sud-ouest de l
a
 
Guadeloupe e
t, Christophe Coiomb decide de l
e baptiser
 
Los Santos ou l
es Saintes.
 
P
rêoccupes par i
es p
rodigieuses r
ichesses du Nouveau
 
Monde, Espagnois e
t Portugais ne s
'

es Saintes r

i

Certes, e
i

ans doute ê
t
e occupees, en t
ous cas
 
v
isitées par i
es Ara waks puis i
es CaraIbes, mais i
'exigulte
 
de ces l
i
es, i
eur c

f
aut a

a colonisation des i
s
les au nom du Roy de
 
F
rance e
t de l
a Compagnie des I
s
les d
'Amerique, démarrêe
 
a
 partir de 1635, pour que, 13 ans p
lus t
ard, -
 l
e Gouver-
neur de l
a Guadeloupe, l
e s
leur Houêi, r
essentant l
e besoin
 
de s
'assurer cette position p
roche de l
a Guadeloupe -
,
 i
es
 
Saintes connaissent un p
remier é
tabiissement.
 
Le 18 octobre 1648, une t
rentaine de colons d
irigés par
 
Du me, p
rennent possession de Terre-de-Haut, e
t y a
rbo-
r
ent l
a c
roix, mais u
s f
ont i
'experience des p
remiers v
isi-
t
eurs e

a sécheresse qui v
ient a
 bout des p
lus r
êsistants
 
i
es contraint a
 r
eembarquer.'
 
Quatre ans p
lus t
ard, en 1652, une nouvelle occupation
 
est décidêe e
t est conduite par Hazier du Buisson. E
i
le subit
 
v
ictorieusement i
'assaut des guerriers CaraIbes venus de l
a
 
Dominique t
oute p
roche. Les F
rancais n
'auront d
'ailieurs
 
p
lus a
 r
edouter ces valeureux combattants a
 l
'avenir, car u
s
 
deviendront a
l
lies f
ace a
 un nouvel adversaire commun.
 
A i
instar des autres l
ies de l
a Caraibe, l
es Saintes vont en
 
e
ffet devenir i
'enjeu des r
ivahtés des puissances europeen-
nes e
t subiront en particuher l
e choc des guerres i
ncessan-
t
es opposant l
e i
Royaume de F
rance a
 celui do I
'Angleterre.
 
1666 est l
'année du debut des hostilités e
t  '
echo des
 
canons sur l
a mer s
i
lencieuse commence a
 r
ésonner.
 
Le 4 aoUt, Lord WILLOUGHY a

a

portés par 18 valsseaux de guerre penetre c

t

t s
'assurent une v

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
L

t. K

iscovered by Christopher Columbus i
n 1493
 
on h
is second voyage t
o t
he new world. The i
s
land t
hat Columbus s
aw,
 
however, was quite unlike t
he i
s
land you a
re v
isiting t

vegetation was acacia and w
ild bushes. I
t
 t
ook many years t
o import and

o

The name, Nevis, i
s t
hought t
o have been derived f
rom t
he Spanish
 
word, n
ieves, meaning '
snow." Columbus i
s said t
o have seen t
his i
s
land
 
gem w

n t
he c
louds and have been r
eminded o
f European
 
snow capped mountains and named t
he i
s
land accordingly. On occasion,
 
t
he spelling i
s seen as "Mevis","Meves", "Neves", and "Meavis". Two o
ther
 
names a
re o
f i
nterest: "Dulcina" and t
he I
ndian name, "Oualie." L
ike t
he
 
name Mount Misery, on S
t. K
itts, t
his writer cannot determine t
he meaning
 
o
f "Oualie."
 
Nevis was colonized f

F

Azariah P

f t

ags-to-riches capabilities o

o t

s
lands. When he r
owed ashore a
t
 
Charlestown i

or h
is participation i
n t

Rebellion, he had only t
he c
lothes on h

 well-thumbed B
ible, and
 
f
i
fteen  pounds h
idden i
n r
ecessed pockets. Through t
rading, money
 
l
ending, and p
lanting, he managed t
o develop an estate originally known
 
as "Chariots," t
hough g
rand enough t
hirty-five years l
ater t
o house t
he
 
Governor General. Four generations o
f P

he
 
l

rought such i

s t
he
 
l

The s

o an estate

on Antigua as well as t
o t
he connecting l

f Saddle h

on Nevis. This a

n 1708, made Montraverse one o

on t

f
 
John and Mary, d
id not d
isplay h
is g
randfather's business acumen and,
 
i
ndeed, would have been soundly whipped by Azariah, had he been a
l

John F

estate t
o a young t

successful p

but r
