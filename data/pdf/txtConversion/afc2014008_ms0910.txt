LEGISLATIVE CONSULTANT

Dear Friend:
 
Senator Fred Harris  (D-Okla)  and Representative Frank
 
Thompson  (D-NJ)  have  introduced  in Congress a landmark
 
proposal to create an American Folklife Foundation.
 
The people listed on this  letterhead think that the
 
Harris-Thompson bill represents a long-needed national
 
commitment to the study,  preservation and presentation of
 
American folklife,  so they have constituted themselves as
 
a Citizens'  Committee to press  for passage of the bill.
 
It  is our hope that you and others who are involved with
 
American folklife will help us  in this  legislative effort.
 
Enclosed are materials relating to this bill.
 If
 
you are willing to work for  its passage,  a good first step
 
is  to write a personal note to your Representative and
 
to your two Senators,  urging them to give their active
 
support to the bill.
 Write to Senators c/o Senate Office
 
Building,  Washington,  DC,  20510.
 Write to Representatives
 
c/o House Office Building,  Washington,  DC,  20515.
 In
 
addition,  please encourage your colleagues,  friends and
 
organizations  to go to work  for this proposal.
 
Like any citizens'  effort,  this one  is dependent
 
financially on private contributions.
 If you share our
 
enthusiasm for this  legislation,  please contribute $10 or
 
so to help bear the necessary costs.
 This  is a no-frill
 
operation,  so you can be assured that your contribution
 
will go directly and entirely into legislative work.
 
Because we definitely seek to  influence public policy,
 
contributions  to our effort are not tax deductible.
 
We need your  involvement---political and  financial----
if we are to have any hope of success.
 We hope that you
 
will be with us  for an American Folklife Foundation.
 
Sincerely yours,

This i
s a union of individuals. A merica
 
i
s a m osaic of cultures, not a blend. Too
 
often, we have failed to treat our dif-
ferences with respect. The truth i
s that
 
we do not kno w each other well enough.
 
So me only kno w that Ger mans l
ive in
 
Nebraska,  that  Chicanos  are  in  the
 
barrio, that a lot of Scots can be found
 
in Appalachia, that m any Poles l
ive in
 
and  around  Chicago,  that  smailtown
 
blacks l
ive on the other s
ide of the tracks,
 
and that there are A mish in Pennsyl-
vania, but we do not know ho w they l
ive.
 
To co mplicate this lack of understand-
ing, the overwhel ming forces of tech-
nology and bureaucracy tend to deny us
 
our hu manity and to stif
le our expres-
s
ions of individuality. In this c
li mate of
 
alienation and anxiety, we need to kno w
 
ourselves i
f we are to know each other.
 
One way to acco mplish this i
s to enlarge
 
upon folk l
ifestyles and to seek as m any
 
outlets as possible for the expression of
 
A merican  cultures,  That i
s  what this
 
bill  i
s  about.  The  A merican  Folklife
 
Foundation will give the A merican peo-
ple a chance to express the mselves.
 
M r. President, the substance of this
 
bill was introduced In 1969 by for mer
 
Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas, and
 
I
 a m privileged to carry on the outstand-
ing effort that he began. In M ay of 1970,
 
Senator Yarborough held hearings on the
 
bill and reported i
t fro m the Labor and
 
Public W elfare Co m mittee, but the 91st
 
Congress adjourned before the full Sen-
ate was able to act. I hope we can have
 
hearings on this measure very soon, and
 
i
t i
s m y deep hope that the Senate will
 
see f
it to enact the proposal in this ses-
s
ion of Congress. There i
s great strength
 
in the folklife of this Nation. Strength
 
which has not been fully understood and
 
certainly not used to the fullest. A co m-
panion bill i
s being introduced on the
 
House s
ide by M r. Tho mpson of Ne w
 
Jersey, and i
t i
s hoped that quick action
 
also can be had in that body so that we
 
are able soon to create the A merican
 
Polki
lfe Foundation and to fund i
t to
 
begin this very important work.

Thank you very much for your letter of September 29, 1973 con-
cerning S

 I appreciate your support of my co-spon-
sorship of the latter.
 
This legislation is currently pending before its respective
 
House and Senate committee and, consequently, has not been scheduled
 
for Floor consideration.
 I would suggest that you contact Senators
 
Cranston and Tunney concerning your support of S. 1844, if you have
 
not already done so.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to apprise me of your
 
views.
 Please know that your comments and opinions are always welcome
 
in this office.

Dear Congres s
m an:
 
I write to urge your s
upport of the American Folklife Preservation Act
 
(
S. B
. 1
844).
 
I would s
trongly s
upport the enactment of this legislation at any time;
 
however, the oncoming centennial year of 1976 makes i
ts i
mmediate passage
 
even more urgent.
 I
t is vital, I believe, that we not allow the centennial
 
celebration to concern i
tself with the political-historical dimension
 
alone, or we may find many of our young people and our minorities telling
 
us that they don't see anything much worth celebrating.  One can say their
 
historical perspective is fore-shortened, but that is beside the point.
 
We are in deeply troubling times; a great many of us are angry and shaken;
 
Patrick Henry oratory and re-enactments of the battle of T
h
inker Hill will
 
not speak to our hearts.
 
There is, of course, much in the s
trengths and diversity of the American
 
citizenry that all of us could celebrate together with real joy -
-
 s
uch
 
things as our deep-rooted and s
tubborn e
galitariani sm, our interest in
 
process (
sometimes translated "know-how"), the relish we take in differences
 
and individuality, our continual dissatisfaction with the-way-things-are
 
and our corollary determination to do something practical about i
t.  All
 
of these are great American themes; and all of then are most directly and
 
plainly s
tated by our myriad folklife s
tyles: the songs, s
tories, dances,
 
instruments and crafts into which generations of ordinary Americans have
 
poured their wisd o
m and their creativity.
 
Through the American Folklife Preservation Act, the positive, consensus-
b
uilding aspects of the American experience can be presented back to their
 
own natural audience -
-
 the American people -
-
 so that we can, as i
t has
 
been expressed, "fall in love with each other all over again".  This would
 
be an i
mportant step in any year of our history; it is doubly so as 1976
 
approaches.
 
I
 urge you to s
upport the i
mmedate passage of this legislation.  Out of our
 
enormous national budget, s
urely we can spare the few dollars requested for
 
the conservatior(and presentation of our unique national cultural resources.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Bess:
 
I certainly appreciate receiving your kind letter re-
garding S.  1

)
4, the American Folklife Preservation
 
Act.
 I am very encouraged by the support that  I have
 
received and quite optimistic that this  legislation
 
will receive favorable consideration.
 
Nonetheless, it is vital that the bill receive maximum
 
"grassroots" support from throughout the  country.
 For
 
that reason, your letter is especially encouraging.
 
I hope that you will continue to express your support
 
to other Senators  and Representatives in this regard.
 
With best regards,  I am

W AS HI NGTO N, THURS DAY, SEPTE MBER 13, 1973
 
A MERIC.
: N SOLKLIFE PRESERVA-
TION ACT
 
Mr. ABOUREZ K. Mr. President, on
 
May 17 I introduced S
. 1844, the A meri-
can Folklife Preservation Act. On that
 
date I was joined by 13 cosponsors. Since
 
then an additional 18 Me mbers of the
 
Senate Indicated their support for this
 
measure by beco ming cosponsors. Today
 
I
 am pleased to announce that Senators
 
SCH WEIKER, SCOTT, STEVENS. HATHA WAY,
 
and METCALF have a
lso agreed to co-
sponsor this bill. This brings the total
 
nu mber of cosponsors in the Senate to 37.
 
In addition, a co mpanion measure has
 
been introduced in the House of Rep-
resentatives. At this mo ment 126 Me m-
bers i
1 the House have cosponsored vari-
ous equivalent bills to S
. 1844. I under-
s
tand that t
. nu mber of other Me mbers
 
have indicated their interest and will be
 
added by a further introduction in the
 
near future.
 
This measure enjoys  a very broad
 
range of support, both geographically
 
and politically. As evidence of this, I
 ask
 
unani mous consent that a l
ist of a
ll co-
sponsors of this b
ill by State be printed
 
in the RECORD at the end of my re marks.
 
The PRESIDIN G OFFICER. Without
 
objection, i
t i
s so ordered.
 
See exhibit 1
.]
 
Mr. ABOUREZ K. Mr. President, many
 
of these cosponsors have further devel-
oped their interest in this idea through
 
co m ments in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 
For exa mple, on May 22 the Senator
 
f
ro m California (Mr. CRANSTON) said:
 
I believe we need a comprehensive pro-
g
ra m o
f Federal a
ssistance for the folk a
rts— 
a
 v
ibrant web o
f experiences and expressions
 
that are basic to who we are, what we do, and
 
why.
 
And on  August 3 the  gentle man
 
f
ro m I
llinois (Mr. ANNUNZIO) s
tated:
 
i
t i
s my belief that a better understanding
 
o
f the contributions o
f various races and
 
faiths and e
thnic backgrounds to our cul-
tural heritage would contribute im mensely
 
to l
essening t
ensions, e
li minating prejudices
 
and bringing about a better understanding
 
among people.
 
I would not want to suggest that the
 
only support this bill has i
s on Capitol
 
Hill. Nothing could be further fro m the
 
t
ruth. In fact, I
 have been very pleasant-
ly surprised by the broad-ranging sup-
port throughout the Nation that the
 
measure has engendered. For exa mple,
 
the National Folk Festival Association
 
Newsletter for July, 1973, said:
 
The National  Folk Festival  Associatio n
 
f
eels s
trongly that public support of this b
ill
 
i
s
 need d '
"'he' w ork  of NFFA and s
i milar
 
o
r g
ar  •
' '.
 c ''''
 
As further evidence of this support, I
 
ask unani mous consent that a sampling
 
of the l
etters I
 have received on this b
ill
 
be printed In the REco a
n at the conclu-
s
ion of my re marks.
 
The PRESIDIN G OFFICE . Without
 
objection, i
t i
s so ordered.
 
[Bee exhibit 2
.]
 
Mr. ABOUREZK. Mr. President, l
et me
 
s
tress that these l
etters are a represen-
tative cross-section and by no means ex-
haust the volu minous f
ile of correspond-
ence that I have received in support of
 
S
. 1844.
 
Of the correspondence I
 have received,
 
none has more accurately expressed the
 
intention of this l
egislation than the
 
l
etter I received f
ro m the distinguished
 
Professor of English and Folklore, Dr.
 
Francis Lee Utley. Dr. Utley teaches at
 
Ohio State University but i
s at present
 
on l
eave t
eaching at the University of
 
Virginia.
 
His l
etter makes seven specific points
 
in regard to the A merican Folklife Pres-
ervation Act. These are:
 
(
1) This g
reat p
luralistic nation (
should I
 
r
emind us o
f our motto E p
luribus unuin?)
 
has many groups:  occupational;  r
ich and-
poor; well-educated and badly educated In
 
the schools; well-educated and badly-edu-
cated in the arts and crafts of l
ife; urban,
 
rural and suburban; W ASP, Chicano, Black,
 
Indian (and that of great diversity); Asiatic,
 
European, and Latin American.
 
(
2) Each of these groups has i
ts own code
 
of values, values which often c
lash i
f they
 
are not understood by the other groups. Pride
 
in such values a
ids men in appreciating other
 
points of v
iew, especially i
f those who have
 
made a specialty of s
tudying the dangers
 
of ethnocentricity are able through publi-
cation, archiving, s
tudy, and museu m de m-
onstration to show a
ll our c
itizens the r
ich
 
variety of their r
espective cultures.
 
(
3) Such work, done by individual scholars
 
and universities and museu ms, needs cen-
t
ralization, and the Washington l
ocale, a
l-
r
eady  well-provided  with  the  Library  of
 
Congress and the Smithsonian, needs to be
 
s
trengthened by specific mandate and by
 
appropriation.
 
(
4)  In a t
i me l
ike the present, when a
 
hundred unpredictables have l
ed to cynicis m,
 
vandalis m, and insecurity, we must use a
ll
 
our resources, pri marily those of a spiritual
 
and an ethical nature, to s
trengthen the
 
national e
thics —not by a b
land melting pot
 
concept, but by the s
tudy of the varied e
le-
ments which in the past and in the present
 
strengthen rather than weaken culture and
 
govern ment.

of men and wo men, their influence on groi1
 
r
elationships and on the c
lashes and cooper
 
atlon between groups of a
ll k
inds.
 
(
6) In a t

i
ts b
lessings and a
ll of i
ts t
ensions, there I
'
 
much to be gained by the s
tudy of s

tud
 
which appeals not only to scholars but to a

I
 would l
ike to ree mphasize Dr. Utle
 
seventh point. This b
ill i
s a modest one.
 
I
t does not need an extensive or expei --
s
ive bureaucratic s
tructure. In fact,  I
 
have received an esti mate f
ro m the Li-
brary of Congress that the costs of ad-
ministering the work proposed for U e
 
Center would be $175,000 for the f
ir
 
year and would not exceed a t
otal of $
' -
.
 
000,000 for the f
irst 5 years added to
 
gether. This i
s a modest amount indet i
l
 
I would hope that both Senate and
 
House can g
ive this measure careful, but
 
speedy consideration. The coordination
 
that this bill would provide i
s desperately
 
needed but i
t i
s not costly. I hope th t
 
more of my colleagues will see f
it to j
i r
 
this ef
fort.

DEAR SENATOR AnouaEzK: I
t i
s with great

844, "A merican

past f
ifteen years working in the area of
 
Plains folklore and f
olklife —StOUX l
og con-
s
truction in South Dakota, the songs and
 
s
tories o
f the Plains, the soddy, round barns,
 
horsetrading s
tories, the f
oods and tales of
 
the O maha Indians, the ha m mered dulci mer
 
of the Ger man-Russians; I have published
 
four books (Treasury of Nebraska Pioneer
 
Folklore, Sod Walls, Folklore Methodology,
 
and Shingling the Fog and Plains Lies) and
 
have four more at publishers and I can as-
sure you that the great mother-lode of Plains
 
folklore r
e mains untouched and r
icher than
 
we can imagine.
 
As a s

 applaud your work and s

wish you the best in this ef

DEAR SENATOR ABouREZK: Senate Bill 1844
 
on the e
stablish ment of an American Folk-
l
ife Center i
s one of the f
inest bills the Con-
gress could pass.
 
As a social s
cientist whose personal work
 
deals with mathe matical and quantitative
 
models. I have beco me quite aware of the
 
vast work needed in the non- mathe matical
 
s
ide of social s
cience. Establish ment of a
 
Folklife Center has great potential for s
ti m-
ulating c
reative and s
ignificant work in v
ital
 
areas of thought. I
ts l
ong run importance
 
to  the  natio n  for  intellectual  discovery
 
should not be overshadowed by the obvious
 
benefits in historic or folkloric activities.
 
I s
trongly encourage passage of the bill,
 
and congratulate you on your foresight in
 
sponsoring i
t.

Ds. z SENATOR ABOusEt
.Ic: S
ince you I
ntro-
duced S
. 1844, a b
ill to provide for the es-
tablish ment of an American Polkl
 l
ie Center
 
in the Library of Congress, I have followed
 
r
eports of i
ts growing l
ist of sponsors with
 
m uch interest. Let me of
fer you my support
 
and encourage ment.
 
As you point out, s
cattered govern mental
 
agencies havC , f
ro m t
i me to t
ime, paid s
erious
 
attention to A merica n traditions. The Library
 
of  Congress Archive  of  Folk  Song, for  in-
s
tance, has been extre mely helpful to me i
n
 
m y own research. T here i
s so m uch that could
 
be done, though, and i
t i
s going to take more
 
than the rando m ef
forts, however energetic,
 
of 
govern mental 
agencies
 and 
private
 
scholars. Hence the need for just the kind
 
o
f center you have proposed. Other countries
 
r
ecognized this need l
ong ago; the Finnish
 
Literature Society was founded in 1831, for
 
instance. and the I
rish Folklore Co m mission
 
in 1935.
 
You are r
ight to s
tre w the diversity of
 
cultures in this country. Our c
itizens, native
 
and im migrant, have a r
ich variety of t
radi-
t
ions, which can g
ive the m so me s
ense of
 
i
dentity and worth. One fairly im mediate
 
and r
elatively inexpensive dividend of the
 
A merica n Folklife Center would be the re-
building o
f positive values, which have suf-
f
ered such an e
rosion of l
ate.
 
My v
iews are further spelled out in a l
etter
 
I
 have s
ent to Senators Stevenson and Percy,
 
a copy of which I enclose.

DEAR SENATOR ABOUREEK: I am de1:ghEed to
 
hear that you have r
eintroduced the Folklife
 
Preservation Bill. Right now folklore and
 
folklife s
tudies are just beginning to de m-
onstrate their public usefulness, and this
 
b
ill i
s especially t
i mely. The Smithsonian In-
s
titution, with who m I
 work, both as a Coun-
s
elor to Secretary Ripley and as a me mber
 
of the Folklife Advisory Co m mittee, have
 
made so me preli minary m oves in de monstrat-
ing the applied uses of folklore s
tudies in the
 
past few years, with more than modest suc-
cess. But this type of thing can and must be
 
carried on throughout the United States, and
 
only an action such as that conte mplated i
n
 
your bill will enable this to be acco mplished.
 
Let me g
ive one exa mple f
ro m your s
tate.
 
I
 have been working with the s
chool syste m
 
in Stephan, on the Crown Creek (Dakota)
 
reservation. They are trying to put together
 
an appropriate educational approach for Da-
kota Indians, and are f
inding i
t d
ifficult be-
cause they have been taught for so many
 
years that anything Indian i
s no good and
 
must be forgotten. Much has re mained, ho w-
ever, and myself and another folklorist, J
.
 
Barre Toelken of Oregon have been de mon-
s
trating t
o the s
taf
f how to observe these
 
practices,  and  how to use the m  in their
 
classroo ms and curricul u m develop ment. But
 
Sister Charles and Augustus and the other
 
good people there need much more l
ocal help
 
(we r
epresent the National Hu manities Fac-
ulty)
 and  this  could be acco mplished
 
through this bill.
 
We are delighted to s
ee that you have been
 
able to garner such broad and multi-partisan
 
support f
ro m your f
ellow senators. Hoping f
or
 
further successes, I
 re main
 
Respectfully yours.

There i
s a t
re mendous outpouring of de-
s
ire for suns things. There i
s a c
lear break-
down in the t
raditional mode of t
rans mis-
s
ion.  Pressures f
ro m  without and within
 
have disrupted the contexts of l
earning and
 
i
dentif
ication that in the past insured the
 
continuity of t
raditional ways and under-
s
tandings. Indians the mselves turn to schol-
arly  skills  for 'help  in bridging the gap,
 
s
cholarly  r
esources,  where  they  have  the
 
chance to know of the m and to acquire the m.
 
Such skills and resources can Indeed help
 
to c
reate what i
s wanted, a baste for what i
s
 
d
istinctively valued in t
raditional ways to
 
re main part of a mere co mplex conte mporary
 
way of l
ife, and to info.-n
n new c
reative activi-
tes.  And  there are  non-Indians who a
re
 
eager and willing to help, and in many i
n-
t
oni eases, are i
teloing. But there i
s great

s great l
ack of ef
fective sup-

s needed.
 
One hears again and again of desire f
or a
 
t
'nts"u m, of help in building one, of help i
n
 
:
.oeing local people  to handle  one. One
 
t

ably be a
ll r
ight, at l
east with r
egard to what
 
i
s done about the native l
anguages in the
 
s
chools, because my wife and I (
she i
s ex-
pert i
n the o
ther main l
anguage of the co m-
munity) happen to be here this year and able
 
to help: but that i
s chance, so far as the
 
educational project I
s concerned).
 
What  particularly  i
s  not  happening  i
n
 
more than a f
e w cases in the country i
s the
 
t
raining of Indian people the mselves in skills
 
for dealing  with  their  t
radit i
nns,  dealing
 
with the m i
n the partly s
cholarly, partly
 
analytic way that i
s necessary today.
 
I
t may s
ee m odd and wrong to talk about
 
preserving and maintaining so mething that
 
needs emergency  ef
forts, special expertise,
 
for i
ts maintenance. I
f the Indians have not
 
managed by the mselves, why i
nterfere '
artif
i-
c
ially? But Indians do want to manage, and
 
the r
pa"ons f
or not doing so i
n the past have
 
a
 g
reat deal to do with forces f
ro m outside the
 
Indian co m munities. And the s
ituation i
s not
 
so f
oreign to our own experience as one
 
might f
irst think.
 
We no not have lm mediate access co th e
 
l
ife of the co m munity around Jesus in Pales-
t
ine, nor a
 d
irect continuity of i
ts way of l
ife
 
in any s
i mple or obvious s
ense. We don't
 
dress l
ike Palestinians then or eat l
ike the m
 
in nor mal meals, any more than many In-
d
iana dress or eat nor mally l
ike their f
ore-
bears of a century ago. We depend mightily
 
on s
cholarship, on skills in archeology, philo-
l
ogy, history and the l
ike, to maintain and
 
enhance what we can know and consistently
 
believe about a
 t
radition we value. We do not
 
think that i
t invalidates Christianity to have
 
i
t pointed out that Christians no l
onger l
ive
 
as d
id the co m munity  around Jesus. We
 
think that there are t
ruths and values and
 
practices  that  survive  even quite  drastic
 
changes in the content and c
ircu mstances of
 
c
ivilization.
 
There i
s an exact parallel f
or me mbers of
 
co m munities such as those of Native A mer-
i
cans, and e
specially Native A mericans, where
 
a r
eligious e
le ment (not necessarily in con-
f
l
ict with Christianity) i
s so often important.
 
There i
s no question of r

A report by Archie Green:
 December 31,  1974
 
The Ninety-Third Congress  (1973-74) was dominated by �
latergate and will be
 
remembered by that searing sequence of events.
 My personal memory for the past
 
two Congressional years is bittersweet -- impatience with snail-like progress in
 
lobbying for the Folklife Act, coupled with the excitement of participating in an
 
extended seminar spread through 535 offices.
 I have felt that my role as an
 
informal lobbyist flowed naturally from previous professional duties, inasmuch as
 
it has been as pleasurable "to teach" folklore on Capitol Hill as in the college
 
classroom.
 If this happy analogy is apt, it will be judged ultimately by legis-
lative enactment and the establishment of a national folk center.
 
On May 17, 1973, Senator James Abourezk and several colleagues introduced the
 
American Folklife Preservation Act  (S.1844), and within the year sixty Senators
 
became co-sponsors.
 Parallel legislation  (H. R.8770) was introduced on June 18,
 
1973, in the House of Representatives by Lucien Nedzi and others.
 Before the time
 
the House bill reached the floor for a vote,  it was co-sponsored by 203 members.
 
Our vote, in the final week of the House session, came on December 16,  1974,
 
under a suspension-of-rules motion, and required for passage two-thirds of those
 
voting.
 Friends of folklore mustered a heavy majority but failed by seven swing
 
votes to achieve enactment.
 The talley:
 Yeas - 249, Nays - 134, Not voting -
 
51  (total 434).
 
A defeat, no matter how close, requires evaluation.  why did we fail?  What
 
strengths did we demonstrate?  Can we gain a victory in the Ninety-Fourth Congress?
 
Do folklorists, in and out of the academy, wish to commit additional energy to
 
legislative action?
 
In this report I shall touch a number of matters:  the bill's background, its
 
substance, the issues which came under floor debate on December 16, tasks ahead.
 
Appended is a tally sheet on the vote, and a list of new House members for 1975-76.
 
Technically, our legislative chronology began in the Ninety-First Congress
 
(
March 20, 1969), when Senator Ralph Yarborough (
Texas) introduced the American
 
Folklife Foundation Act (
S.1591) to establish a new unit within the Smithsonian
 
Institution.  Actually, the bill was drafted as a positive response to the then-
new Festival of American Folklife on the National Mall.  This dramatic event
 
initiated by Ralph Rinzler on July 4
, 1967, had caught the imagination of many
 
Congressmen.
 During hearings (
May 18, 1970) on the Yarborough bill, before the
 
Subcommittee on Education of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, the
 
Smithsonian's Secretary, Dr. S
. Dillon Ripley, supported the bill's general credo
 
-- to assure the cultural diversity of our Nation -- but opposed the specific
 
location within the Smithsonian of a quasi-independent, grant-making entity.
 
In the Ninety�Second Congress, Senator Fred Harris (
Oklahoma) and Representa-
tive Frank Thompson (
New Jersey) introduced S
.1930 and H.R. 8672, respectively,
 
which placed the "unwanted" folklife unit in a second home, the Library of Congress.
 
Informal hearings were held 
l
I e
 
1 9 71 in Washington and Nashville, but the bill
 
remained pigeonholed in committee.  Transcripts of the hearings are found in the

By 1973 Ralph Yarborough and Fred Harris were both out of the Senate, but
 
Frank Thompson remained active in the House.  His special area of concern has a
].-
ways been the arts, and he has long been personally convinced that folkloric
 
activity needed statutory sanction.  The Ninety-Third Congress seemed especially
 
auspicious.  A number of members of the American Folklore Society, had found the
 
failure of the Yarborough and Harris bills perplexing as well as sobering.
 More
 
important, many Senators and Representatives had observed and reacted against the
 
strong commitment to high culture manifested by the National Endowment for the
 
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities in the formative years of these
 
twin agencies.
 Clearly, it had not been Congressional intent in 1965 to establish
 
an executive agency focused mainly on elite values in American society.  To the
 
extent that "folklife" implied to Congress a respect for the understated voice or
 
the homespun artifact, our bill gathered new support on Capitol Hill.
 
Complementing the growing allegiance of populist- and ethnic-based Senators
 
and Representatives during 1973 to the Abourezk-Nedzi bills, several academic folk-
lorists simultaneously began to see public-sector employment as an alternative to
 
college teaching.
 Accordingly, professors and graduate students undertook tenta-
tive roles as lobbyists.
 
This current activism by a few folklorists generates considerable personal
 
tension because some academicians are divided in their feelings about governmental
 
positions.  At one level, public service may seem to imply abandoning standards of
 
objective scholarship.
 By contrast, some activists feel that "pure" scholarship,
 
analytically elegant, often shears away complexity in the "real" world.
 In a
 
sense, this ambivalence felt by teachers parallels the conflict Congressmen often
 
find between parochial interests and the general weal.
 
I do not raise these matters of moral ambivalence lightly.
 In the United
 
States, political leaders and entertainment-industry merchants who exploit folk
 
culture abound.
 The folk itself has no single cultural spokesman in Washington.
 
Is it presumptuous for a professionally trained folklorist to lobby on behalf of
 
the folk -
-
 the citizens who cling to the values of ethnicity, rurality, and
 
artisanship in American life?
 
Recently, members of Congress have raised the same kinds of questions about
 
defining the term "folk society" which are often raised in academic discourse.
 
Clearly, the folk is not everyman and omnipresent.  But is not the folk esoteric
 
and mysterious?  Most Congressmen take a common-sense view of the folk as members
 
of enclaved groups, retaining special traditions, expressing special styles.
 
On the whole, politicians look beyond formal definitions to ask:  Who supports
 
the present bill?  What will the bill do to help people in my district?  When
 
rhetorical discourse becomes abstract, Congressmen return to pragmatic criteria:
 
Do carriers of folk tradition live in my community?  Can their culture readily be
 
seen or heard?  Congressmen frequently define "the folk" in terms of tangible
 
achievements or material objects -
-
 LPs holding distinct music, memorable films,
 
graphic art, festivals that display expressive styles, out-of-door museums.
 
There is no need to summarize the American Folklife Preservation Act here
 
since copies of the new bill to be introduced by Representative Thompson in 1975
 
will soon be printed and available.  Essentially, the bill establishes an entity
 
within the Library of Congress -
-
 a center to preserve and present American folk-
life at local, state, and regional levels.  The term "preservation" includes col-
lecting, archiving, and disseminating cultural data.
 The term "presentation" sug-
gests a full spectrum of exhibition and performance, from individual storytelling
 
to community-oriented festivals.
 In short, the center's national charter is broad
 
lo p
 
d
e

enough to touch at least five basic programs which:
 A
)  identify and honor actual
 
carriers of folk tradition, B
) encourage ethnographic film making and distribu-
tion, C
) extend the production of documentary sound recordings, D
) develop fresh
 
standards for local folk festivals, E
)  introduce folklore education to libraries,
 
museums, and other institutions.
 
At his original hearings, Senator Yarborough expressed his goal for the pro-
posed folklife agency as one of unity between "pure research and practical work."
 
Not only did he envision scholars, technicians, performers, and craftsmen working
 
in conjunction, but he assumed a cooperative relationship between federal cultural
 
agencies, old and new.
 Surprised and hurt by bureaucratic criticism of his bill,
 
he stated that he should have demanded attention to folklife when Congress ini-
tially established the National Science Foundation and the National Foundation on
 
the Arts and the Humanities.  Time has added meaning to his wise observation, for
 
our bill, modest as it is, has drawn fire both from the National Endowment for
 
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
 
During 1973 Miss Hancy Hanks (
NEA) and Dr. Ronald Berman (
NEH) wrote to
 
several Senators stating that folklife legislation was redundant and duplicative of
 
their own responsibilities.  Further, each Endowment issued inflated data sheets
 
showing its past generosity to "folk" projects, broadly defined.  Much of this
 
jurisdictional opposition was cast in legal prose, but behind it lay a concern
 
with power.  At the most basic level any agency head clings to his or her domain,
 
yet shoring up the Endowments' jurisdictional bastion were several hidden esthetic
 
assumptions on the nature of high and folk culture.
 
Essentially, folk culture was perceived as a gob of raw material to be used
 
by sophisticated artists.  Not only did crude material need to be refined and
 
elevated, but the folk itself needed to be moved "uptown."  In a literal sense,
 
ghetto children with their own rich musical tradition were carted to the Lincoln
 
Center to hear "serious" music.
 In a metaphoric sense, blue collar workers were
 
asked to move from the Mets to the Metropolitan Opera.
 One must ask:
 Is not a
 
strategy of cultural coexistence and mutual recognition more consistent with the
 
American dream than one of esthetic elitism?  Was the mandate of the Endowments
 
really that of raising the sights of the peasantry, the underclasses?  Or were
 
folk art and skill to be seen as intrinsically vital strands in the national fabric?
 
I do not mean to imply that opposition to our bill by the Endowments was
 
always or only framed in esthetic terms.  Actually, technical criticism focused
 
specifically on the supposed administrative conflict between "grant-making" and
 
"operating" agencies.  The two Endowments felt it appropriate for the Library of
 
Congress to maintain an archive or for the Smithsonian to hold a collection of folk
 
objects, but wished to retain for the NEA-NEH the power to award monetary grants
 
to individuals.
 
Although folklorists can (and have) made a good case for the operational unity
 
within one agency of folk studies and field work, as well as granting and adminis-
trative fiscal powers, we have not persuaded the Smithsonian, Library of Congress,
 
the Endowments, nor the Office of Management and Budget (
White House arm) to en-
dorse our position.  The problem will continue to plague us in the future.
 
To understand the full range of criticism against our bill and the vote of
 
December 16, it is useful to outline the specific progress of S
.1844 and H.R.8770
 
during 1973-74:

The first problem for the advocates of any bill is to get Congressmen and their
 
staff aides to listen.
 Tens of thousands of bills inundate Capitol Hill.
 Is any
 
single one really necessary?  It must be stated at once that the Library of Con-
gress established its Archive of Folk Song in 1928 without a law or Congressional
 
appropriation, and the Smithsonian Institution undertook its first folk festival
 
in 1967 in the absence of a specific statute.
 
Why did we desire a new center underpinned by legislative will?  My answer to
 
various Senators and Representatives was manifold, and, at times, abstract.
 Folk
 
culture, holding esthetic and philosophic value, is intrinsically worth preserving;
 
citizens by virtue of their power granted to government can expect public support
 
to their own heritage, their own handiwork; the American egalitarian promise im-
plies freedom within a diverse structure of national life -
-
 this goal can not be
 
realized without an explicit stand on cultural pluralism.
 
I spent much of 1973 walking the halls of five Congressional office buildings,
 
seeking out members and their aides to talk about folklore.  At year's end, an
 
unexpected event complemented this lobbying.  On December 8 the National Endowment
 
for the Arts called a meeting, opened by Michael Straight, deputy chairman,
 to  con
-
sider its own folk arts program.  Whether the Endowment had had a long-time
 
interest in folklore or was politically sensitive to the wide Congressional sup-
port for our bill is now moot.
 The meeting resulted in the hiring of Dr. Alan
 
Jabbour as Director of a Folk Arts program within the NEA.  He had served previ-
ously as head of the Archive of Folk Song at the Library of Congress and is
 
eminently qualified for his pioneering position.
 
During House hearings in May, 1974, the crucial testimony was presented by
 
L
. Quincy Mumford, the Librarian of Congress, who repeated the Smithsonian position
 
of 1970:  lukewarm support to folklore and opposition to the proposed center's
 
grant-making function.
 Needless to say, folklorists were distressed by Mr. Mum-
ford's views.
 (At year's end, 1974, Mr. Mumford retired; the acting Librarian is
 
now John Lorenz.)
 
I shall not list here all the positive witnesses at the Senate and House
 
hearings representing academic, ethnic, and artistic interests, for their cogent
 
testimony is found in the printed record.
 Rather, I wish to comment on the
 
symbolism I sensed in the trio of Congressmen who offered the bulk of the
 
Report -
 5
 
questioning.
 Lucien Nedzi from Detroit represented a Polish immigrant and blue
 
collar constituency; Frank Thompson spoke for the liberal, intellectual community;
 
Tom Gettys identified himself as "a country boy from way back in the woods of
 
South Carolina."  These three members used the hearings to draw from friendly and
 
unfriendly witnesses alike statements of need for the center as well as guides
 
for its functions.
 
When the Rouse Library Subcommittee met on October 9 to mark-up H. R
.8770 1 
Nedzi, Thompson, and Gettys, all Democrats, were prepared to defend their bill.
 
Republican Congressmen Caldwell Butler (Virginia) and Bill Frenzel (Minnesota)
 
properly raised the question of funding.
 H.R.8770 had ended with the conventional
 
authorization of "such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
 
this Act."  Mr. Frenzel was concerned that this might become an "open sesame" for
 
a giant give-away program.  Hence, Mr. Nedzi suggested substituting a set of
 
estimated figures previously prepared by the Librarian of congress.
 This sum com-
bined both internal operating expenses and potential grants:
 
$163,000 for fiscal year ending June 30, 1975
 
$710,000 -
-
 1976
 
$1,716,000 -
-
 1977
 
$2,241,000 -
-
 1978
 
With the understanding that all these figures would eventually have to be reviewed
 
again and appropriated in separate legislation, they were placed in an altered
 
bill which was accepted both by the Library Subcommittee and the full Committee
 
on House Administration.
 
Before turning to the House vote on Deceir1er 16, it is important to backtrack
 
to the Senate.
 I have already indicated that the House Library Subcommittee was
 
partial to folklife.
 Unfortunately, we did not find a similar reception in the
 
other chamber.
 Despite sixty co-sponsors and volumes of correspondence, we
 
literally fell into the hands of two Senators, one indifferent to our needs and
 
one detached from our strategies.  Matters concerning the Library of Congress are
 
assigned to the Senate Rules Committee, chaired by Howard Cannon (
Nevada).  Al-
though a number of his constituents wrote to him favoring S
.1844, Senator Cannon
 
never became a co-sponsor.
 
The second-ranking Democrat on Rules is Claiborne Pell (
Rhode Island), a long-
time, dedicated supporter of cultural legislation and institutions.
 In fact,
 
Senator Pell had "fathered" the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act
 
(
Public Law 89-209), and perceived his role as that of the guardian of federal cul--
tural programs.
 Crucial to understanding his position is the knowledge that his
 
aide in these matters, Livingston Biddle, had been deputy chairman of the National
 
Endowment for the Arts in its early years.
 (At the end of 1974, Mr. Biddle left
 
Senator Pell's staff to return to the NEA as Director of Congressional Relations.)
 
I stress the roles of Senators Cannon and Pell because, deliberately or not,
 
they were able to bottle-up the folklife bill in committee.
 In short, the sixty
 
co-sponsors of S.1844 were never given a chance to vote on folklore.
 One detail
 
adds perspective at this juncture.
 In the summer of 1974 I met several times with
 
Livingston Biddle, hoping to persuade him to help budge our bill onto the floor
 
for a vote.
 It then seemed to me that Senator Pell could easily have marked-up
 
the bill by deleting the grant-making function of the center.
 Such a "compromise"
 
would have "saved face" for the Endowments and given the folklife center its long-
Report -
 6
 
overdue charter.
 I am uncertain whether Senator Pell ever seriously considered
 
any modification of S
.1844 that would have brought it to life during 1974.
 
With avenues frozen in the Senate late in 1974, we turned our full energies
 
to the House, pushing for consideration of H
.R.17382.  Normally, a bill goes from
 
a standing committee to the Rules Committee before it can reach the House floor
 
for a vote.
 However, our bill was taken up by the House Committee on Administra-
tion so late in the year that we were not afforded a ruling to move to the floor
 
-
-
 one which would have required winning by only a majority.  The decision to go
 
the floor "under suspension" was made about ten days before adjournment.
 I was
 
confident that we had a two-thirds margin -
-
 that enough Congressmen from rural
 
and ethnic districts understood the need for support to folklife.  We did garner
 
249 yeas, well above a House majority, but not the two-thirds necessary on that
 
dismal Monday.
 
Why did we fail?  Why did a handful of co-sponsors, at the last minute, vote
 
against our bill?  Two elements seemed to shape the final count, one accidental
 
and unanticipated, the other reflecting naivete on our part.
 
Without detailing the very complicated relationship between the American Film
 
Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts, folklorists should know that
 
the API for several years has tried to free itself from its parent NEA.  Late in
 
1974 Congressman John Brademas (
Indiana) introduced legislation to give the AFI
 
its own charter.  His bill may have used some ambiguous language, and it did not
 
hold the full support of the film community.
 Ironically, the API bill pitted
 
former Congressional supporters of the National Endowment for the Arts against the
 
NEA's position on the film bill.
 
Although there was no formal relationship of any sort between the film and
 
folk bills there seemed to be a surface similarity.  Both measures suggested the
 
need for pluralism in the cultural field rather than a single federal arts agency
 
with a monolithic constituency.
 (
Parenthetically, where folklorists value plural-
ism, the Endowment chiefs often decry fragmentation.)
 To our great dismay, debate
 
and voting on the film bill directly preceded ours; the film bill, with its huge
 
budget, was defeated overwhelmingly.
 Unfortunately, the linkage of the two bills
 
in the minds of some Congressmen led to negative votes on each measure.
 Had we
 
come to the floor a few days prior to the film vote we might well have held a two-
thirds margin.
 
The full argument, pro and con, on the Folklife Act is found in the Con-
gressional Record (
December 16, 1974) and need not be repeated here.  The negative
 
stance of its opponents can be characterized at three levels using a set of
 
accepted code words:
 fiscal, trivial, dangerous.  Anyone lobbying for folklore
 
has been subject to all these arguments, frequently intertwined.
 In a sense the
 
debate on December 16 was but a brief version of the years of previous discussion
 
on our bill.
 The principal speakers for folklore were Lucien Nedzi, Frank Thomp-
son, and George Mahon (
Texas), Chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee.
 
The leading critic was H.R. Gross  (
Iowa) whose swan song was sung over our bill.
 
Generally, fiscal conservatives assert that it is beyond the scope of basic
 
governmental design to foster any cultural expression.
 Simply put, the state
 
should be restricted to national defense and internal security.
 If one suggests
 
that schools, libraries, museums, and parks also give a nation its strength, then
 
the argument shifts to the matter of cost.
 Folklife support is costly or cannot he
 
afforded at this particular moment in history.  When it is pointed out that our
 
"price tag" is modest, the rebuttal shifts away from fiscal concerns to notions
 
of trivia.
 The new attack states that folklore is a frill, a luxury, or a
 
Report -
 7
 
boondoggle.
 During debate, Mr. Gross offered this pearl,  "if it  the bill] were
 
amendable, i would trifle with the idea of including Fannie Foxe in this highly
 
cultural deal.  .
 •
 .
 Perhaps there is some way yet to drag her in."
 
Congressman Gross also offered a more serious criticism, one which touched
 
some patriotic chords in the House.
 In essence, he charged that the folklife bill
 
would retard the assimilation of aliens and immigrants into national life.
 
Quoting Theodore Roosevelt's admonition, he reminded his colleagues that "there is
 
no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism."  Sitting in the House gallery,
 
I winced with pain at Mr. Gross' remarks, and wondered what was pulsing in Mr.
 
Nedzi's heart while he too listened.
 
Individual folklorists often devote decades of attention to the expressive
 
life of particular groups:
 Cajun music, Amish beliefs, native Indian ritual, the
 
blues, mountain dialect, children's games.  One is compelled to ask:
 Is such
 
research dangerous?  Does this study make a scholar an automatic partisan of
 
minorities -
-
 Cajun, Amish, mountaineer?  Or does this study but open the mind to
 
the fantastic richness in American life?
 
Perhaps folklorists were naive not to have anticipated that anxiety over
 
hyphenated Americanism would touch their bill.
 The assumption that "foreigners"
 
can not resolve conflicting loyalties is powerful.
 Yet, sooner or later, we must
 
face the fact that not all citizens desire to be melted in ideal red-white-and--
blue crucibles.  There is a rough correlation in the view held by mandarins that
 
it is the destiny of folk culture always to be refined, and the veiw held by
 
jingoists that it is the destiny of the folk itself always to be melted.
 
In preparing this report I have dealt with varied opposition to the folklife
 
bill:
 esthetic, bureaucratic, economic, chauvinistic.  Yet I do not look to 1975
 
with discouraged vision; on the contrary, I am encouraged by our achievements.  A
 
full majority of the House is on record for the folklife bill, for the first time.
 
Many naysayers will not be back for the Ninety-Fourth.  By visits to and corre-
spondence with Congress, some votes can be changed.  There are now ninety-two
 
new Congressmen -
-
 "the Watergate class."  How many can we win to support of our
 
bill?  What are the prime tasks for 1975?
 
Early in the forthcoming year, Congressman Frank Thompson will reintroduce
 
the folklife bill and will again ask for co-sponsors.

Senate bill will also be introduced.  Letters to Congress are important!  Please

.C., 20045.
 
Beyond correspondence,  I must stress that it is extremely helpful for folk-
lorists to talk directly to Senators and Representatives, either in Washington or
 
when the members are home in the states and districts.
 (
Each member has at least
 
one office in his state or district.)
 There is no substitute for first-hand
 
accounts of folkloric work.  What do you collect?  How do you treat your material?
 
Do you publish?  Can the public understand you?  Have you edited a record or
 
produced a film?  Do you assist in library or museum programs?  Have you helped
 
plan or stage a local festival?
 
These questions may seem oversimple, yet it is my experience that Congressmen
 
were intensely curious about my personal research and publication.
 If I did not
 
believe that the folkloric contribution to the commonweal was deeply significant,
 
I could not have persuaded a single Congressman of the value of our work.
 Ideally,
 
at least one folklorist in each of 435 districts ought to be in close touch with
 
his or her Representative.
 
Hopefully, at some time in 1975 brief hearings will be scheduled once more on
 
the folklife bill.  Alternatively, Congressmen may skip hearings and go directly to
 
subcommittee mark-up sessions.  Folklorists may be called upon again to testify on
 
specific plans for cultural preservation and presentation, or we may also be
 
challenged to define "pluralism."  Some political figures see this as a negative
 
term implying job or racial quotas and denial of opportunity.  Others use it
 
largely as an administrative standard -- for example, federal-state partnership
 
or revenue sharing.  Still others equate pluralism with the kaleidoscopic pat-
terning in American experience.  To justify a new federal folk center we must be
 
prepared to identify concrete local projects as well as to conceptualize about
 
the national polity itself.

Although I see my main task ahead as that of lobbying for the passage of a
 
folklife bill, I am not convinced that folklorists ought to put all their energies
 
in one cause.
 I have long felt that, parallel to lobbying, we need to increase
 
the presence of qualified, professional folklorists in Washington.  To illustrate:
 
should not the National Park Service employ folklorists as it employs naturalists
 
and historians?  Would not the Ethnic Heritage Studies Program (
in the Department
 
of Health, Education, and Welfare) benefit by the assistance of a folklorist?  Can
 
we add quality to the fine program in the National Trust for Historic Preservation?
 
The examples above can be multiplied and will become crucial as academic
 
employment declines.
 Graduate programs in folklore continue to attract bright
 
students.  Where will they all find work?  Perhaps it is time for the American
 
Folklore Society to move its office to Washington.  There seems to be need in the
 
nation's capitol for an informal forum of folklorists already employed here, as
 
well as for a new independent folk institute.  The latter might undertake appro-
priate folkloric projects under contracts with federal agencies, as well as serve
 
as a national "folk watchdog."
 
With this canine figure of speech I close my report. I have deliberately
 
refrained from naming the friends in Congress, in the universities, and in many
 
voluntary associations who have combined force to give folklife a legislative life
 
of its own.
 Insteadi I ask each friend who helped in the past to put his shoulder
 
to the wheel again.  As well, I appeal for new friends to join the cause.  Let us
 
work and pray for passage of the American Folklife Preservation Act in 1975.

THE FOLKLIFE ACT IN THE NINETY-THIRD CONGRESS
 
A report by Archie Green:  December 31, 1974
 
The Ninety-Third Congress (
1973-74) was dominated by Uatergate and will be
 
remembered by that searing sequence of events.  My personal memory for the past
 
two Congressional years is bittersweet -
-
 impatience with snail-like progress in
 
lobbying for the Folklife Act, coupled with the excitement of participating in an
 
extended seminar spread through 535 offices.
 I have felt that my role as an
 
informal lobbyist flowed naturally from previous professional duties, inasmuch as
 
it has been as pleasurable "to teach" folklore on Capitol Hill as in the college
 
classroom.
 If this happy analogy is apt, it will be judged ultimately by legis-
lative enactment and the establishment of a national folk center.
 
On May 17, 1973, Senator James Abo-urezk and several colleagues introduced the
 
American Folklife Preservation Act (
S.1844), and within the year sixty Senators
 
became co-sponsors.
 Parallel legislation (
H.R.8770) was introduced on June 18,
 
1973, in the House of Representatives by Lucien Nedzi and others.  Before the time
 
the House bill reached the floor for a vote, it was co-sponsored by 203 members.
 
Our vote, in the final week of the House session, came on December 16, 1974,
 
under a suspension-of-rules motion, and required for passage two-thirds of those
 
voting.
 Friends of folklore mustered a heavy majority but failed by seven swing
 
votes to achieve enactment.
 The talley:  Yeas -
 249, Nays -
 134, Not voting - 
51 (
total 434).
 
A defeat, no matter how close, requires evaluation.  Why did we fail?  What
 
strengths did we demonstrate?  Can we gain a victory in the Ninety-Fourth Congress?
 
Do folklorists, in and out of the academy, wish to commit additional energy to
 
legislative action?
 
In this report I shall touch a number of matters:
 the bill's background, its
 
substance, the issues which came under floor debate on December 16, tasks ahead.
 
Appended is a tally sheet on the vote, and a list of new House members for 1975-76.
 
Technically, our legislative chronology began in the Ninety-First Congress
 
(March 20, 1969), when Senator Ralph Yarborough (
Texas)  introduced the American
 
Folklife Foundation Act (
S.1591) to establish a new unit within the Smithsonian
 
Institution.
 Actually, the bill was drafted as a positive response to the then-
new Festival of American Folklife on the National Mall.  This dramatic event
 
initiated by Ralph Rinzler on July 4, 1967, had caught the imagination of many
 
Congressmen.
 During hearings (May 18, 1970) on the Yarborough bill, before the
 
Subcommittee on Education of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, the
 
Smithsonian's Secretary, Dr. S
. Dillon Ripley, supported the bill's general credo
 
-
-
 to assure the cultural diversity of our Nation -
-
 but opposed the specific
 
location within the Smithsonian of a quasi-independent, grant-making entity.
 
In the Ninety-Second Congress, Senator Fred Harris (Oklahoma) and Representa-
tive Frank Thompson (
New Jersey) introduced S
.1930 and H.R. 8672, respectively,
 
which placed the "unwanted" folklife unit in a second home, the Library of Congress.
 
Informal hearings were held during 1971 in Washington and Nashville, but the bill
 
remained pigeonholed in committee.  Transcripts of the hearings are found in the
 
Congressional Record (
See CR: 92, First Session 7/28, and CR:92, Second Session,
 
2/1).
 
Report -

By 1973 Ralph Yarborough and Fred Harris were both out of the Senate, but
 
Frank Thompson remained active in the House.
 His special area of concern has al-
ways been the arts, and he has long been personally convinced that folkloric
 
activity needed statutory sanction.  The Ninety-Third Congress seemed especially
 
auspicious.  A number of members of the American Folklore Society, had found the
 
failure of the Yarborough and Harris bills perplexing as well as sobering.
 More
 
important, many Senators and Representatives had observed and reacted against the
 
strong commitment to high culture manifested by the National Endowment for the
 
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities in the formative years of these
 
twin agencies.
 Clearly, it had not been Congressional intent in 1965 to establish
 
an executive agency focused mainly on elite values in American society.  To the
 
extent that "folklife" implied to Congress a respect for the understated voice or
 
the homespun artifact, our bill gathered new support on Capitol Hill.
 
Complementing the growing allegiance of populist- and ethnic-based Senators
 
and Representatives during 1973 to the Abourezk-Nedzi bills, several academic folk-
lorists simultaneously began to see public-sector employment as an alternative to
 
college teaching.  Accordingly, professors and graduate students undertook tenta-
tive roles as lobbyists.
 
This current activism by a few folklorists generates considerable personal
 
tension because some academicians are divided in their feelings about governmental
 
positions.  At one level, public service may seem to imply abandoning standards of
 
objective scholarship.  By contrast, some activists feel that "pure" scholarship,
 
analytically elegant, often shears away complexity in the "real" world.
 In a
 
sense, this ambivalence felt by teachers parallels the conflict Congressmen often
 
find between parochial interests and the general weal.
 
I do not raise these matters of moral ambivalence lightly.
 In the United
 
States, political leaders and entertainment-industry merchants who exploit folk
 
culture abound.  The folk itself has no single cultural spokesman in Washington.
 
Is it presumptuous for a professionally trained folklorist to lobby on behalf of
 
the folk -
-
 the citizens who cling to the values of ethnicity, rurality, and
 
artisanship in American life?
 
Recently, members of Congress have raised the same kinds of questions about
 
defining the term "folk society" which are often raised in academic discourse.
 
Clearly, the folk is not everyman and omnipresent.  But is not the folk esoteric
 
and mysterious?  Most Congressmen take a common-sense view of the folk as members
 
of enclaved groups, retaining special traditions, expressing special styles.
 
On the whole, politicians look beyond formal definitions to ask:  Who supports
 
the present bill?  What will the bill do to help people in my district?  When
 
rhetorical discourse becomes abstract, Congressmen return to pragmatic criteria:
 
Do carriers of folk tradition live in my community?  Can their culture readily be
 
seen or heard?  Congressmen frequently define "the folk" in terms of tangible
 
achievements or material objects -
-
 LPs holding distinct music, memorable films,
 
graphic art, festivals that display expressive styles, out-of-door museums.
 
There is no need to summarize the American Folklife Preservation Act here
 
since copies of the new bill to be introduced by Representative Thompson in 1975
 
will soon be printed and available.  Essentially, the bill establishes an entity
 
within the Library of Congress -
-
 a center to preserve and present American folk-
life at local, state, and regional levels.  The term "preservation" includes col-
lecting, archiving, and disseminating cultural data.
 The term "presentation" sug-
gests a full spectrum of exhibition and performance, from individual storytelling
 
to community-oriented festivals.
 In short, the center's national charter is broad

enough to touch at least five basic programs which:  A
)  identify and honor actual
 
carriers of folk tradition, B
) encourage ethnographic film making and distribu-
tion, C
) extend the production of documentary sound recordings, D
) develop fresh
 
standards for local folk festivals, E
)  introduce folklore education to libraries,
 
museums, and other institutions.
 
At his original hearings, Senator Yarborough expressed his goal for the pro-
posed folklife agency as one of unity between "pure research and practical work."
 
Not only did he envision scholars, technicians, performers, and craftsmen working
 
in conjunction, but he assumed a cooperative relationship between federal cultural
 
agencies, old and new.
 Surprised and hurt by bureaucratic criticism of his bill,
 
he stated that he should have demanded attention to folklife when Congress ini-
tially established the National Science Foundation and the National Foundation on
 
the Arts and the Humanities.  Time has added meaning to his wise observation, for
 
our bill, modest as it is, has drawn fire both from the National Endowment for
 
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
 
During 1973 Miss Hancy Hanks (
NEA) and Dr. Ronald Berman (
NEH) wrote to
 
several Senators stating that folklife legislation was redundant and duplicative of
 
their own responsibilities.  Further, each Endowment issued inflated data sheets
 
showing its past generosity to "folk" projects, broadly defined.
 Much of this
 
jurisdictional opposition was cast in legal prose, but behind it lay a concern
 
with power.  At the most basic level any agency head clings to his or her domain,
 
yet shoring up the Endowments' jurisdictional bastion were several hidden esthetic
 
assumptions on the nature of high and folk culture.
 
Essentially, folk culture was perceived as a gob of raw material to be used
 
by sophisticated artists.  Not only did crude material need to be refined and
 
elevated, but the folk itself needed to be moved "uptown."  In a literal sense,
 
ghetto children with their own rich musical tradition were carted to the Lincoln
 
Center to hear "serious" music.
 In a metaphoric sense, blue collar workers were
 
asked to move from the Mets to the Metropolitan Opera.
 One must ask:
 Is not a
 
strategy of cultural coexistence and mutual recognition more consistent with the
 
American dream than one of esthetic elitism?  Was the mandate of the Endowments
 
really that of raising the sights of the peasantry, the underciasses?  Or were
 
folk art and skill to be seen as intrinsically vital strands in the national fabric?
 
I do not mean to imply that opposition to our bill by the Endowments was
 
.
ways or only framed in esthetic terms.  Actually, technical criticism focused
 
i
ecifically on the supposed administrative conflict between "grant-making" and
 
perating" agencies.  The two Endowments felt it appropriate for the Library of
 
:
'ngress to maintain an archive or for the Smithsonian to hold a collection of folk
 
objects, but wished to retain for the NEA-NEH the power to award monetary grants
 
to individuals.
 
Although folklorists can (
and have) made a good case for the operational unity
 
within one agency of folk studies and field work, as well as granting and adminis-
trative fiscal powers, we have not persuaded the Smithsonian, Library of Congress,
 
the Endowments, nor the Office of Management and Budget (
White House arm)  to en-
dorse our position.  The problem will continue to plague us in the future.
 
To understand the full range of criticism against our bill and the vote of
 
December 16, it is useful to outline the specific progress of S
.1844 and H.R.8770

. R.17382, emerged from the Subcommittee (
October
 
15) to replace the various bills previously submitted.

)
 Clean bill unanimously accepted by full Committee on House Administration,
 
November 26, 1974, and committed to Whole House (
December 9
)  for con-
sideration.
 
5
)
 Vote under suspension-of-rules motion, December 16, 1974.  }L R.17382
 
technically defeated despite a heavy majority of 249-134.
 
The first problem for the advocates of a
n y
 bill is to get Congressmen and their
 
staff aides to listen.
 Tens of thousands of bills inundate Capitol Hill.
 Is any
 
single one really necessary?  It must be stated at once that the Library of Con-
gress established its Archive of Folk Song in 1928 without a law or Congressional
 
appropriation, and the Smithsonian Institution undertook its first folk festival
 
in 1967 in the absence of a specific statute.
 
Why did we desire a new center underpinned by legislative will?  My answer to
 
various senators and Representatives was manifold, and, at times, abstract.
 Folk
 
culture, holding esthetic and philosophic value, is intrinsically worth preserving;
 
citizens by virtue of their power granted to government can expect public support
 
to their own heritage, their own handiwork; .
the American egalitarian promise im-
plies freedom within a diverse structure of national life -
-
 this goal can not be
 
realized without an explicit stand on cultural pluralism.
 
I spent much of 1973 walking the halls of five Congressional office buildings,
 
seeking out members and their aides to talk about folklore.  At year's end, an
 
unexpected event complemented this lobbying.  On December 8 the National Endowment
 
for the Arts called a meeting, opened by Michael Straight, deputy chairman, to con-
sider its own folk arts program.  Whether the Endowment had had a long-time
 
interest in folklore or was politically sensitive to the wide Congressional sup-
port for our bill is now moot.
 The meeting resulted in the hiring of Dr. Alan
 
Jabbour as Director of a Folk Arts program within the NEA.  He had served previ-
ously as head of the Archive of Folk Song at the Library of Congress and is
 
eminently qualified for his pioneering position.
 
During House hearings in May, 1974, the crucial testimony was presented by
 
L
. Quincy Mumford, the Librarian of Congress, who repeated the Smithsonian position
 
of 1970:
 lukewarm support to folklore and opposition to the proposed center's
 
grant-making function.  Needless to say, folklorists were distressed by Mr. Mum-
ford's views.
 (At year's end, 1974, Mr. Mumford retired; the acting Librarian is
 
now John Lorenz.)

questioning.
 Lucien Nedzi from Detroit represented a Polish immigrant and blue
 
collar constituency; Frank Thompson spoke for the liberal, intellectual community;
 
Tom Gettys identified himself as "a country boy from way back in the woods of
 
South Carolina."  These three members used the hearings to draw from friendly and
 
unfriendly witnesses alike statements of need for the center as well as guides
 
for its functions.
 
When the House Library Subcommittee met on October 9 to mark-up I
-
i
.R.8770,
 
Nedzi, Thompson, and Gettys, all Democrats, were prepared to defend their bill.
 
Republican Congressmen Caldwell Butler (Virginia) and Bill Frenzel (Minnesota)
 
properly raised the question of funding.  H.R.8770 had ended with the conventional
 
authorization of "such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
 
this Act."  Mr. Frenzel was concerned that this might become an "open sesame" for
 
a giant give-away program.  Hence, Mr. Nedzi suggested substituting a set of
 
estimated figures previously prepared by the Librarian of Congress.
 This sum com-
bined both internal operating expenses and potential grants:
 
$163,000 for fiscal year ending June 30, 1975
 
$710,000 -
-
 1976
 
$1,716,000 -
-
 1977
 
$2,241,000 -
-
 1978
 
With the understanding that all these figures would eventually have to be reviewed
 
again and appropriated in separate legislation, they were placed in an altered
 
bill which was accepted both by the Library Subcommittee and the full Committee
 
on House Administration.
 
Before turning to the House vote on December 16, it is important to backtrack
 
to the Senate.
 I have already indicated that the House Library Subcommittee was
 
partial to folklife.
 Unfortunately, we did not find a similar reception in the
 
other chamber.
 Despite sixty co-sponsors and volumes of correspondence, we
 
literally fell into the hands of two Senators, one indifferent to our needs and
 
one detached from our strategies.  Matters concerning the Library of Congress are
 
assigned to the Senate Rules Committee, chaired by Howard Cannon (
Nevada).  Al-
though a number of his constituents wrote to him favoring S
.1844, Senator Cannon
 
never became a co-sponsor.
 
The second-ranking Democrat on Rules is Claiborne Pell  (Rhode Island), a long-
time, dedicated supporter of cultural legislation and institutions.
 In fact,
 
Senator Pell had "fathered" the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act
 
(
Public Law 89-209), and perceived his role as that of the guardian of federal cul-
tural programs.
 Crucial to understanding his position is the knowledge that his
 
aide in these matters, Livingston Biddle, had been deputy chairman of the National
 
Endowment for the Arts in its early years.
 (At the end of 1974, Mr. Biddle left
 
Senator Pell's staff to return to the NEA as Director of Congressional Relations.)
 
I stress the roles of Senators Cannon and Pell because, deliberately or not,
 
they were able to bottle-up the folklife bill in committee.
 In short, the sixty
 
co-sponsors of S.1844 were never given a chance to vote on folklore.  One detail
 
adds perspective at this juncture.
 In the summer of 1974 I met several times with
 
Livingston Biddle, hoping to persuade him to help budge our bill onto the floor
 
for a vote.
 It then seemed to me that Senator Pell could easily have marked-up
 
the bill by deleting the grant-making function of the center.
 Such a "compromise"
 
would have "saved face" for the Endowments and given the folklife center its long-
I

overdue charter.
 I am uncertain whether Senator Pell ever seriously considered
 
any modification of S
.1844 that would have brought it to life during 1974.
 
With avenues frozen in the Senate late in 1974, we turned our full energies
 
to the House, pushing for consideration of H.R.17382.  Normally, a bill goes from
 
a standing committee to the Rules Committee before it can reach the House floor
 
for a vote.
 However, our bill was taken up by the House Committee on Administra-
tion so late in the year that we were not afforded a ruling to move to the floor
 
-
-
 one which would have required winning by only a majority.  The decision to go
 
the floor "under suspension" was made about ten days before adjournment.
 I was
 
confident that we had a two-thirds margin -
-
 that enough Congressmen from rural
 
and ethnic districts understood the need for support to folklife.  We did garner
 
249 yeas, well above a House majority, but not the two-thirds necessary on that
 
dismal Monday.
 
Why did we fail?  Why did a handful of co-sponsors, at the last minute, vote
 
against our bill?  Two elements seemed to shape the final count, one accidental
 
and unanticipated, the other reflecting naivete on our part.
 
Without detailing the very complicated relationship between the American Film
 
Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts, folklorists should know that
 
the AFI for several years has tried to free itself from its parent NEA.  Late in
 
1974 Congressman John Brademas (
Indiana)  introduced legislation to give the AFI
 
its own charter.  His bill may have used some ambiguous language, and it did not
 
hold the full support of the film community.
 Ironically, the AFI bill pitted
 
former Congressional supporters of the National Endowment for the Arts against the
 
NEA's position on the film bill.
 
Although there was no formal relationship of any sort between the film and
 
folk bills there seemed to be a surface similarity.  Both measures suggested the
 
need for pluralism in the cultural field rather than a single federal arts agency
 
with a monolithic constituency.
 (
Parenthetically, where folklorists value plural-
ism, the Endowment chiefs often decry fragmentation.)
 To our great dismay, debate
 
and voting on the film bill directly preceded ours; the film bill, with its huge
 
budget, was defeated overwhelmingly.
 Unfortunately, the linkage of the two bills
 
in the minds of some Congressmen led to negative votes on each measure.
 Had we
 
come to the floor a few days prior to the film vote we might well have held a two-
thirds margin.
 
The full argument, pro and con, on the Folklife Act is found in the Con-
gressional Record (December 16, 1974) and need not be repeated here.  The negative
 
stance of its opponents can be characterized at three levels using a set of
 
accepted code words:
 fiscal, trivial, dangerous.  Anyone lobbying for folklore
 
has been subject to all these arguments, frequently intertwined.
 In a sense the
 
debate on December 16 was but a brief version of the years of previous discussion
 
on our bill.
 The principal speakers for folklore were Lucien Nedzi, Frank Thomp-
son, and George Mahon (
Texas), Chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee.
 
The leading critic was H.R. Gross (
Iowa) whose swan song was sung over our bill.
 
Generally, fiscal conservatives assert that it is beyond the scope of basic
 
governmental design to foster any cultural expression.
 Simply put, the state
 
should be restricted to national defense and internal security.
 If one suggests
 
that schools, libraries, museums, and parks also give a nation its strength, then
 
the argument shifts to the matter of cost.
 Folklife support is costly or cannot be
 
afforded at this particular moment in history.  When it is pointed out that our
 
"price tag" is modest, the rebuttal shifts away from fiscal concerns to notions
 
of trivia.
 The new attack states that folklore is a frill, a luxury, or a

boondoggle.
 During debate, Mr. Gross offered this pearl,  "If it  [
the bill] were
 
amendable, I would trifle with the idea of including Fannie Foxe in this highly
 
cultural deal.  .
 .
 .
 Perhaps there is some way yet to drag her in.'
 
Congressman Gross also offered a more serious criticism, one which touched
 
some patriotic chords in the House.
 In essence, he charged that the folklife bill
 
would retard the assimilation of aliens and immigrants into national life.
 
Quoting Theodore Roosevelt's admonition, he reminded his colleagues that "there is
 
no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism."  Sitting in the House gallery,
 
I winced with pain at Mr. Gross' remarks, and wondered what was pulsing in Mr.
 
Nedzi's heart while he too listened.
 
Individual folklorists often devote decades of attention to the expressive
 
life of particular groups:
 Cajun music, Amish beliefs, native Indian ritual, the
 
blues, mountain dialect, children's games.  One is compelled to ask:
 Is such
 
research dangerous?  Does this study make a scholar an automatic partisan of
 
minorities -
-
 Cajun, Amish, mountaineer?  Or does this study but open the mind to
 
the fantastic richness in American life?
 
Perhaps folklorists were naive not to have anticipated that anxiety over
 
hyphenated Americanism would touch their bill.  The assumption that "foreigners"
 
can not resolve conflicting loyalties is powerful.
 Yet, sooner or later, we must
 
face the fact that not all citizens desire to be melted in ideal red-white-and-
blue crucibles.  There is a rough correlation in the view held by mandarins that
 
it is the destiny of folk culture always to be refined, and the veiw held by
 
jingoists that it is the destiny of the folk itself always to be melted.
 
In preparing this report I have dealt with varied opposition to the folklife
 
bill:  esthetic, bureaucratic, economic, chauvinistic.
 Yet I do not look to 1975
 
with discouraged vision; on the contrary, I am encouraged by our achievements.  A
 
full majority of the House is on record for the folklife bill, for the first time.
 
Many naysayers will not be back for the Ninety-Fourth.  By visits to and corre-
spondence with Congress, some votes can be changed.  There are now ninety-two
 
new Congressmen -
-
 "the Watergate class."  How many can we win to support of our
 
bill?  What are the prime tasks for 1975?
 
Early in the forthcoming year, Congressman Frank Thompson will reintroduce
 
the folklife bill and will again ask for co-sponsors.
 In the Spring a parallel
 
Senate bill will also be introduced.  Letters to Congress are important!  Please
 
address members at the House Office Building, Washington, D
.C., 20515, and at the
 
Senate Office Building, Washington, D
.C., 20510.
 If possible, please send copies
 
of your letters (
as well as replies) to the CCAFC office:
 209 National Press
 
Building, Washington, D
.C., 20045.
 
Beyond correspondence, I must stress that it is extremely helpful for folk-
lorists to talk directly to Senators and Representatives, either in Washington or
 
when the members are home in the states and districts.
 (
Each member has at least
 
one office in his state or district.)
 There is no substitute for first-hand
 
accounts of folkloric work.  What do you collect?  How do you treat your material?
 
Do you publish?  Can the public understand you?  Have you edited a record or
 
produced a film?  Do you assist in library or museum programs?  Have you helped
 
plan or stage a local festival?
 
These questions may seem oversimple, yet it is my experience that Congressmen
 
were intensely curious about my personal research and publication.
 If I did not
 
believe that the folkloric contribution to the commonweal was deeply significant,
 
I could not have persuaded a single Congressman of the value of our work.
 Ideally,
 
h
d
 
at least one folklorist in each of 435 districts ought to be in close touch with
 
his or her Representative.
 
Hopefully, at some time in 1975 brief hearings will be scheduled once more on
 
the folklife bill.  Alternatively, Congressmen may skip hearings and go directly to
 
subcommittee mark-up sessions.  Folklorists may be called upon again to testify on
 
specific plans for cultural preservation and presentation, or we may also be
 
challenged to define "pluralism."  Some political figures see this as a negative
 
term implying job or racial quotas and denial of opportunity.  Others use it
 
largely as an administrative standard -- for example, federal-state partnership
 
or revenue sharing.  Still others equate pluralism with the kaleidoscopic pat-
terning in American experience.  To justify a new federal folk center we must be
 
prepared to identify concrete local projects as well as to conceptualize about
 
the national polity itself.
 
Ultimately, whether in hearinas or mark-up sessions, Senators and Representa-
tives will comment on the proposed fol
lklife center's relationship with other cul-
tural agencies.  By July, 1975, Alan Jabbour, Director of Folk Arts in the National
 
Endowment for the Arts, will have granted about a half-million dollars to folk
 
projects.  Consequently, I suspect that it will be exceedingly difficult to budge
 
the two Endowments from their position on the separation of granting/operating
 
functions.
 It is my personal view that compromise is in order along these lines
 
-- the proposed center will retain contractual and other fiscal power, but will
 
leave grants to the Endowments.  In turn,,we should expect each Endowment to
 
extend its folk program, in money and personnel.  For example, the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities has yet to hire a folklorist to complement Dr. Jabbour's
 
work.  We can not accept this NEH view that deprecates our concerns.
 
Although I see my main task ahead as that of lobbying for the passage of a
 
folklife bill, I am not convinced that folklorists ought to put all their energies
 
in one cause.
 I have long felt that, parallel to lobbying, we need to increase
 
the presence of qualified, professional folklorists
' in Washington.  To illustrate:
 
should not the National Park Service employ folklorists as it employs naturalists
 
and historians?  Would not the Ethnic Heritage Studies Program (
in the Department
 
of Health, Education, and Welfare) benefit by the assistance of a folklorist?  Can
 
we add quality to the fine program in the National Trust for Historic Preservation?
 
The examples above can be multiplied and will become crucial as academic
 
employment declines.  Graduate programs in folklore continue to attract bright
 
students.  Where will they all find work?  Perhaps it is time for the American
 
Folklore Society to move its office to Washington.  There seems to be need in the
 
nation's capitol for an informal forum of folklorists already employed here, as
 
well as for a new independent folk institute.  The latter might undertake appro-
priate folkloric projects under contracts with federal agencies, as well as serve
 
as a national "folk watchdog."
 
With this canine figure of
' speech I close my report. 
I have deliberately
 
refrained from naming the friends in Congress, in the universities, and in many
 
voluntary associations who have combined force to give folklife a legislative life
 
of its own.
 Instead, I ask each friend who helped in the past to put his shoulder
 
to the wheel again.  As well, I appeal for new friends to join the cause.  Let us
 
work and pray for passage of the American Folklife Preservation Act in 1975.

Ms.  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Folk Arts Program
 
National Endowment for the Arts
 
Washington,  D.C.  20506
 
Dear Bess:
 
I was pleased to receive your letter.
 As I said before,
 
your election to the Fellows was long overdue.
 
I am enclosing your certificate and a letter from Jan.
 
As for my remarks at the ceremonies,  I have my Ms., but
 
I probably ad libbed a lot and can't recreate that.
 
Bess Lomax Hawes,  Director of the Folk Arts Program
 
of the National Endowment for the Arts, was carrying out
 
important research in folksong as early as 1937 when she
 
went to work for her father, John Lomax, in the Archive
 
of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress.
 Her
 
many films, books, and articles are widely used in the
 
teaching of folklore; these include the film Pizza,
 
Pizza, Daddy-U (1969), a book with Bessie Jones, Step It
  
Down  (1972), and "Folksongs and Function:  Some Thoughts
 
on the American Lullaby" in the Journal of American Folk-
lore (1974).
 
But, perhaps most important, Bess Hawes has
 
provided an important calm vision in the organization and
 
development of programs which have made the public con-
siderably more aware of what folklore is and what folk-
lorists do.
 Her shepherding of the 1976 Festival of Amer-
ican Folklife was an incredible feat of public presenta-
tion of authentic performers and craftspeople in struc-
tured environments that enable the American public to re-
alize what  "authenticity" and "tradition" really mean.
 
Her work since at the National Endowment  for the Arts has
 
led to the development and implementation of far-reaching
 
and innovative public programs.
 
We too hope we can get together soon for a auiet talk.
 
But it will probably have to wait until next year.
 Eleanor
 
sends her regards.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT
 
A former president of this Society whose privacy I sometimes  protect
 
by referring to him as Glum the Disenchanted (
and who, to save space, I
 
shall cite here without the epithet) recently wrote Ellen Stekert that he
 
seem no difference in the way the Society i
s run now and the way it was run
 
i
n h
is youth, nor does he see any d
ifference in the character of the
 
profession now and the character he remembers in the good old days. Glum is
 
wrong on both counts. I won't take space here to say why Glum i
s wrong
 
about the profession, but I will say a few things about the operation of
 
the American Folklore Society.
 
I should f
irst mention that Glum offered me a memorat and some advice
 
shortly after I was elected president two years ago. This happened at the
 
end of the regular Saturday afternoon business meeting. He beckoned to me
 
from where he stood leaning against something supportive and, when I got
 
near enough, he said: "Herbert Halpert told me when I was elected that
.
 
I shouldn't get too excited about this because nothing you do matters,
 
t
hings w
ill be exactly the same when you're f
inished as when you started.
 
Keep that in mind so you won't be disappointed." I don't know whether or
 
not Herbert actually said those things to Glum, but I
'm sure Glum took the
 
advice to heart when he was president and I
'm sure he believed it was true
 
after h
is year i
n office was over. I
'll take this opportunity to say Glum
 
was wrong on that one too. It really is possible to do useful things in
 
t
his job and the work and t
ime have been not at all d
isappointing.
 
It is nossibi.e to do nothing at all in the office, and the Society
 
survives quite well thank you. That is because the Executive Board is where
 
the real authority and voice of the Society now reside. The new
 
constitution adopted by the Society e
ight years ago made governance of the
 
Society far more democratic than was possible i
n earlier years. The present
 
Board, represents well (
with two e
xceptions) the interests and occupations
 
of the membership. The Board functions far more efficiently and broadly
 
than it d
id only a few years ago--it needed t
ime to develop a sense of what
 
i
t could do and what i
t should do and it took time for the Board to learn
 
how to function. I
've found that the Board provides strong support to an
 
activist president and steps in to fill the silence by doing its own job
 
and the president's job when we have a president incapable of or
 
uninterested in the Society's work. I should note that s
ince I
've been on
 
the Board we've had one president who didn't come to meetings, one who came
 
but who thought we shouldn't do anything about anything, one who came and
 
who thought we should do things but who d
idn't believe we could do
 
anything, one who came and did nothing and said little, one who decided
 
that for the Society's Board and committees to work well the activities
 
should be made as public as possible and the membership kept as informed
 
and involved as possible, and me, whom I
'll leave it for someone else to
 
characterize. The Society survived the passive and negative presidencies
 
and it profited from the active ones--because of the constitutional
 
strength of the Executive Board and because of the seriousness with which
 
nearly all members of that Board took their work.
 
The Executive Board has three working sessions each year--a two-day
 
session i
n t
he spring and half-day sessions at the beginning and end of the
 
annual AFS meetings. The business of the Society, however, goes on all year
 
long. The day-to-day work of handling the Society's business is done by the
 
executive secretary-treasurer, who i
s also responsible for coordinating the
 
agendas o
f the t
hree Board meetings and the several plenary public meetings
 
of the Society, for carrying out the decisions made by the Board, for
 
bringing to the attention of the president and the Board things that need
 
attention now or will be needing attention soon, for editing the
 
Newsletter... There's more, but you get the idea. I
've been on the
 
Executive Board f
ive years now and I think the smartest s
ingle thing we d
id
 
in that period was to appoint Charley Camp executive secretary-treasurer.
 
H. has been remarkably reliable and e
fficient and he has consistently
 
provided the Board wise counsel.
 
I think the s
ix most important actions of the Board i
n the past year
 
were: establishment of the Centennial Coordinating Council, funding and
 
publication of Folklore/Folklife, beginning of a wider search for grants to
 
support the Society's work, successful lobbying to have professional
 
folklorists appointed to the Board of Trustees o
f the American Folklife
 
Center, beginning of work on the hundred-year analytical index to the
 
Journal, and our co-spgnsorship with the American Folklife Center of a
 
conference on the state of folklore i
n h
igher education. A few remarks
 
about each of these:
 
--The Centennial Coordinating Council is an umbrella committee set up last
 
fall by the E
xecutive Board to coordinate activities connected with and
 
occasioned by t
he 1
988-89 centennial of the AFS. Marta Weigle will report
 
on the Council's membership, activities, and plans. The Board felt it could
 
not manage e
fficiently the wide range of centennial matters, nor could it
 
provide the continuity this five-year project requires (
one-third of the
 
Executive Board cycles off each year). The CCC consists of the various
 
centennial committee chairs, as well as each AFS president elected to serve
 
through 1
987. That means at least three members of the CCC at any time will
 
also be members of the Executive Board, so close coordination should be a
 
s
imple matter. The Council's several committees have provided opportunities
 
for far more AFS members to be i
nvolved in the Society's operations than is
 
usually possible and the work has enabled a
ll of us to obtain a better
 
understanding of t
he linkages (
and lack of linkages) between AFS, the
 
several government agencies whose work seems contiguous w
ith ours, and w
ith
 
some s
ister societies. The immediate object of the CCC has to do with the
 
centennial, but the work will lead to far more e
xtensive results.
 
--We received last December what i
s, to my knowledge, the Society's first
 
grant--$25,000 from the I
. J
. and Mary C
. Skaggs Foundation for the
 
publication of Folklore/Folklife. Ten thousand copies of the booklet were
 
printed. By now, a
ll members and all i
nstitutional subscribers should have
 
received copies. Booklets are being sailed to officials i
n education,
 
government, publishing, and foundations. This is the f
irst t
ime the Society
 
has attempted to provide the general public a document describing the
 
Society and e
xplaining the work done by its members. It has already been
 
incorporated in grant applications, adopted for class use, included in at
 
least one promotion dossier, and offered in support of a graduate folklore
 
program's request for increased institutional funding. I once again thank
 
the Skaggs Foundation and .
l
illian Steiner Sandrock, for providing us this
 
fine opportunity, and Marta Weigle, Judith McCulloh, and a
ll t
he other
 
members of AFS who worked so hard making the idea a reality.
 
--We have applied to the Skaggs Foundation for funds to help underwrite
 
work of the CCC over the next eighteen months. The Skaggs Foundation is
 
also considering a larger grant to the Society for a group of projects over
 
the next four years. The CCC Funding Committee is seeking grants to
 
underwrite the various enterprises connected with the centennial, such as
 
special publications and conferences. The Committee is also applying to NEH
 
for a $
100,000 Challenge Grant. Organizations such as ours cannot depend on
 
grants for normal operations (
government funding opportunities come and go
 
with the political winds, and foundation opportunities change as the
 
foundations' priorities change), but we should take advantage of
 
whatever resources are available. Grant-getting takes a great deal o
f t
ime,
 
but the flexibility those funds provide are worth the effort.
 
--Charley Camp mentioned at one of our meetings a year or so ago that
 
there were presently no folklorists on the Board of Trustees of the
 
American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress. Several members of the
 
Executive Board were distrubed at what seemed to them a d
istance developing
 
between the Center and the Society. The Society, they reminded the rest of
 
us, was instrumental in the creation of the American Folklife Center, and
 
it was very much i
n our interest to have continuing i
nfluence on its
 
operations. When Alan Jabbour informed us that there would be two vacancies
 
on the Center's Board in March 1984, the E
xecutive Board decided to
 
nominate six candidates to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro
 
Ter
n of the Senate (
each of whom would make one appointment). The names of
 
three folklorists were submitted to each of the two officials. Since both
 
individuals appointed--Barre Toelken and me--were named on those l
ists, i
t
 
seems reasonable to assume that the Society's recommendations had some
 
i
nfluence on the appointments. In two years there will be four more
 
vacancies on the Folklife Center Board of Trustees....
 
--Richard Thill and Michael Taft have been working with a small group of
 
folklorists and information specialists on a hundred-year analytical i
ndex
 
to JAF. We plan to publish the Index in three forms: as a supplement to the
 
Journal i
n 1988 (
free to all members and subscribers), as a hardcover book
 
for sale to l
ibraries, and as a microcomputer diskette. Once the mechanism
 
is established, it should be easy to keep the Index up to date with hard-
copy and electronic media supplements. The project should be a useful
 
research tool and it should provide a measure of the Journal's 
accomplishments over the past century. As a PAFS it should also provide the
 
Society some continuing income.
 
--The American Folklife Center funded in early September a two-day
 
conference on folklore in higher education. The conference was sponsored
 
jointly by AFC and AFS. Lists of potential participants were prepared by
 
the AFS Executive Board and by' the Center's staff; about one-third of the
 
names appeared on both lists. Selection of participants was a difficult
 
matter because we all realized that many AFS members would want to take
 
part i
n the conversation and would have useful things to contribute, but if
 
it was to be useful the group had to be kept small enough for extended
 
d
iscussion of things that seemed to matter. I think i
t was an i
mportant
 
event for several reasons: this was the first time AFS and AFC collaborated
 
on an enterprise of mutual concern; it was the first time the d
irectors and
 
chairs of most North American graduate folklore programs met to discuss
 
t
heir departmental goals, conditions, and problems; and i
t also provided a
 
fozue in which several folklorists not based in graduate programs (
few of
 
us are) could tell the chairs how the world seemed from where they lived
 
and worked. The meeting had at least three results: the chairs will extend
 
their discussions in other meetings, AFC and AFS will sponsor more such
 
meetings designed to deal with issues of i
mportance to the profession, and
 
AFC and AFS will work on the preparation and publication of a detailed
 
survey o
f t
he current status of folklore i
n North American higher
 
education.
 
The more complex our functions as a society and as a profession, the
 
more varied the issues with which we have to deal. These are some of the
 
matters I think the E
xecutive Board and the Society will have to address i
n
 
the near future:
 
--We have to stop being so passive about membership; we w
ill not survive
 
long as a society i
f we j
ust wait for people to decide joining AFS might be
 
amusing or useful. The increasing fragmentation of scholarly activity into
 
smaller and smaller areas of specialization over the past two decades has
 
resulted in an i
ncrease i
n scholarly organizations and an i
ncrease i
n
 
scholarly publications. Few faculty members and fewer students are able to
 
belong to a
ll the organizations and subscribe to a
ll the journals
 
appropriate to their work and interests. As the number of organizations has
 
increased, many organizations have suffered severe membership losses.
 
Inflation and reductions i
n public funds for education have forced many
 
libraries to cut back on their journal subscriptions. In that climate and
 
context, AFS is doing relatively well; we're not growing, but we're not
 
wasting away e
ither. Institutional subscriptions to JA
F seem to be
 
increasing slightly; there has been a slight drop i
n our individual
 
memberships, I think in large part a reflection o
f the decrease in the
 
number of graduate students actively involved in folklore studies.  Charley
 
will report on our f
inancial condition. We're not i
n any trouble yet, but
 
neither do we have the funds to provide much flexibility in our operations.
 
Were it not for the Skaggs Foundation grant, for example, we could not have
 
published FoJ.klore/Folklife, and without the grant we hope will be
 
forthcoming from the Foundation next year we could not pursue as
 
aggressively as we plan the various activities associated with the
 
Centennial. Grants are a delight, but they are no basis for continued
 
operations. Our operating costs increase at a slow--but regular--rate. I
 
think i
t i
mportant that we expand our membership base and I think we can do
 
so without much difficulty i
f we decide it is worthwhile. I hope some
 
members will use their second copy o
f Folklore/Folklife to do a b
it of
 
recruiting for AFS. Beginning next year, the Journal will run exchange
 
membership and subscription ads with appropriate publications and
 
organizations. The Board would welcome other suggestions for e
xpanding the
 
Society's membership base.
 
--One-third of our membership consists of individuals who are not teachers
 
of folklore, students of folklore, or public sector workers in folklore.
 
The management of the Society rests entirely in the hands of academics and
 
people with government or foundation appointments and j
obs. I would hope we
 
could f
ind out more about that other t
hird, f
ind out ways we might better
 
serve their needs, f
ind ways we might involve them in what we're doing.
 
--There is no regular communication between the student members of AFS and
 
the Executive Board. Students are a large enough constituency i
n this
 
Society that they should have some regular way to i
nform our deliberations.
 
I know there are problems with this: first-year graduate students don't
 
know enough about what is going on to have much to say and third- and
 
fourth-year graduate students aren't going to be students long enough to
 
have much i
nvestment in that status. The Board deals with issues from the
 
point of view of individuals dealing with problems and needs now or looking
 
back on their e
xperience with problems and needs; I think there might be
 
some utility in having i
nformation provided by people who were looking
 
ahead. Those students have more o
f an i
nterest in the future of the
 
profession than any of us, and it is in our interest that they be involved
 
as early as possible.
 
--The Folklore Fellows were organized to recognize individuals who had made
 
significant contributions to the profession of folklore; it is the only
 
section o
f AFS specifically named in the Society's constitution. It is also
 
the only section of AFS not presently responsible in any way to the
 
membership at large. Five members of the Society may by petition put on the
 
general ballot the name of any Society member for any Society office and any
 
member of the Society is free to join and attend meetings of any of the
 
Society's interest sections. But members of the Society who are not members
 
of the Fellows may not nominate i
ndividuals they think worthy for
 
membership, nor can they influence Fellows' elections in any direct fashion.
 
The Fellows now are fully autonomous; they nominate and vote on new
 
Fellows; they perpetuate their own company. Most of us don't even know who
 
the Fellows are.  (
That's not for not trying: on three separate occasions I
 
have asked officers of the Fellows to present to Chan cy Camp a list of
 
current members and officers so Charley might i
nclude that i
nformation in
 
the Newsletter; no list was ever delivered.) If the Fellows are to remain
 
within AFS, the method o
f self-perpetuation should be replaced by a process
 
of nominations and elections from the AFS membership. That would make the
 
Fellows representative of the AFS rather than a club and it would make the
 
honor one delivered by the Society rather than a small group within the
 
Society. I
f for some reason the Fellows find the process of public
 
nomination and election and democratic involvement i
mpractical, they should
 
separate (
or be separated) from the Society.
 
--We still need to improve the process by which AFS officers are nominated.
 
Two years ago, every candidate but one named by the nominating committee
 
had received the Ph.D. from a single institution. I don't think that
 
represented any mad power urge by the nominating committee, but it d
id
 
reflect the simple fact that people tend to nominate people they know, and
 
the Society is large enough so few of us know very many people. I don't
 
know any easy solution. Some people have suggested enlarging the nominating
 
committee, but others have argued that would only make its workings more
 
cumbersome without necessarily improving its efficiency. The constitution
 
provides for nomination by petition--five members of the Society may place
 
a name on the ballot for any Society office. That option has, so far as I
 
know, been used only twice i
n the past eight years, both t
imes for
 
president, and both times the nominee was elected. Perhaps the solution is
 
for more people to get petitions going for themselves or their friends, not
 
just for president but also for the Executive Board and for the nominating
 
committee i
tself. Here, too, the Board would welcome suggestions.

--The Executive Board has been discussing w
ays of managing the Society's
 
records. Pieces of them are stored in several institutions; others are in
 
private papers of former officers. We don't know what records still e
xist
 
or where many of them are. Joe Hickerson suggested the Society create a new
 
constitutional position, the AFS Archivist, so someone or some committee
 
would be responsible on a continuing basis for identifying what was still
 
in e
xistence, ensuring that the papers were maintained safely, and taking
 
care that current documents were archived on a regular basis. Creating a
 
new constitutional position is a serious matter and there may be other ways
 
to handle the problem. What do you think?
 
--I think t
he AFS presidency should once again be a two-year job. I
've
 
thought this for two years now, but I did not think it appropriate to raise
 
the i
ssue while I was president-elect or i
n office. I have heard two
 
arguments against extending the term. One goes: "The e
xecutive secretary-
treasurer i
s the real e
xecutive officer of the Society; the presidency
 
should be j
ust an honorary job for a year so the Society can reward people
 
who deserve i
t and keeping it to a one-year term means more people can be
 
honored." I
'd respond to that: The j
ob has too much work connected with it
 
to be considered by anyone rational or responsible nothing more than an
 
honor; anyway, that's what the Fellows are for. The other objection, raised
 
more frequently and by people who do take the office seriously, has to do
 
with certain past presidents who performed badly or who d
idn't perform at
 
all: "What happens i
f we get another  
? Can we afford
 years of
 
that?" In that case we should do what other professional societies do:
 
create and be ready to use a mechanism for expelling from office someone
 
who won't or can't do the job.
 
--More trained folklorists are employed in a wider range o
f j
obs t
han ever
 
before. More trained folklorists are also unable to find continuing jobs i
n
 
folklore than ever before. The job market, in universities at any rate, has
 
shriveled, and it will remain so until the children of the Baby Boomers
 
begin passing through colleges in 1995. Folklorists seem to have fared
 
better i
n the current s
ituation than graduates of most other humanities
 
programs (
our Ph.D.s are often capable of providing double service), but
 
things are still not very good out there. The AFS is a scholarly
 
organization, not a professional association; I
'm not sure how or what we
 
should or might do about these economic matters. But I have no doubt we
 
should begin looking at t
hem in far more serious and consistent ways than
 
we have looked so far.
 
I wish Jan Brunvand and Rayna Green joy and luck in this job. In case
 
my friend Glum pulls them aside at this year's meeting as he did me two
 
years ago, I
'll say again that he missed the point. I learned a great deal
 
this past year, I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Board, I think we d
id
 
some good work, and I think there are still i
nteresting things to be done.
 
I thank those of you who gave me the chance to
 p
. there when interesting
 
things were happening.

The Society again enjoyed a fairly stable fiscal year, with individual
 
and institutional memberships remaining constant.  Grants from the
 
L.J. Skaggs and Mary C
. Skaggs Foundation assisted in expansion of
 
Society development, principally through the newly-published booklet
 
Folklore/Folklife. 
The Society continues to receive the able assistance of the American
 
Anthropological Association in the management of fiscal and membership
 
services, publications, and meeting arrangements.
 Special thanks are
 
due Ed Lehman, Lucille Horn, and Christopher Laxton for their work on
 
the Society's behalf.

. Report of the Editor, JAF
 
In the period between September 27, 1983 and September 2
1, 1984, when
 
work on the final (October-December) issue of Volume 97 was completed,
 
the editorial office received a total of 86 submissions (up nearly 5%
 
from the previous year).  Of these,  1
2 were accepted as articles, 8-as
 
notes, and 3 as obituaries, while 53 were rejected and the remainder
 
are still out to readers for review.
 The rate of acceptance for articles
 
and notes remained nearly the same as last year.
 
As before, we have tried dilligently to notify authors concerning the
 
disposition of their submissions within three months of receiving them.
 
We have, however, found it somewhat difficult to meet this self-imposed
 
deadline this year, owing largely to the dilatoriness of referees to
 
whom we have sent manuscripts for evaluation.  As I noted last year,
 
all members of the Society have a stake in the improved quality that is
 
reflected by a refereed journal and should value the efforts --anonymous
 
though they are--of all who assist in this process.  We continue to need
 
good, prompt referees--volunteers welcome.
 
The current editorial team, except for Tom Green, is now entering its
 
final year of service.  When we fill our final issue, sometime next
 
.
1
 
spring, Brice Jackson will take over as editor, Chuck Perdue as book
 
review editor, Norm Cohen as record review editor, while Tom Green
 
will continue to serve as film review editor.
 
As always, I urge folklorists to send their best work to the Journal
  
of American Folklore. The higher the standard of excellence we are
 
able to maintain, the better for us all.

4. Report of the Book Review Editor, JAF
 
This past year has been an unusually tranquil one in the Book Review
 
Editor's experience.  No publisher has written protesting that a book
 
of his failed to gain review space in the Journal; only one author has
 
complained about a Journal reviewer's treatment of his book: and only
 
two reviewers have gone over the six-months-from-assignment mark after
 
which the probability of his or her review ever appearing, either in
 
manuscript or in print, drops drastically.
 In general, all has gone
 
most smoothly.  We received 67 books for review, assigned 40, and have
 
four currently in the accessioning process.
 In the Journal itself
 
we've reviewed 7
1 books in the four issues since 1984's fourth quar-
ter (nos. 382-385).
 
The only potential clouds on this sunny expanse that I can see are,  f
irst,
 
a rise in the old problem of tardiness, this time of reviews due on the
 
summer dates of June 1
, July 1
, August 1
, and September 1
.
 I hope we're
 
witnessing an idiosyncratic event and that the new academic year will
 
bring late reviews swiftly home.
 The second cloud i
s potentially more
 
troublesome: as the figures given earlier indicate, we've experienced
 
a severe drop-off in the number of books we receive that are suitable
 
for review in a scholarly j
ournal.
 Once again, perhaps this is a passing
 
phenomenon; on the other hand, the distinct decline in folklore publica-
tions from such formerly prolific presses as those of the University of
 
Texas, Indiana University, and most strikingly, the University of Penn-
sylvania, may indicate a serious transformation in the book trade.
 
The Book Review Editor will have to be flexible in the face of such
 
change.
 In the meantime, I enter the f
ifth and final year of my term
 
of office confident that reviewers will continue their dependable work
 
and that the new editorial assistants will be as indispensable as the
 
past year's twosome of Deborah Fant and Suzanne Seriff.

. Report of the Film Review Editor, JAF
 
During the past year (
issues 382-385), JAF published reviews of 29 audio-
visual productions.  An addieional nine reviews await publication, and
 
1
4 more films have been assigned for review.
 I urge members of the Society
 
who wish to submit a review or are aware of an audiovisual production which
 
should be reviewed to contact me.

. Report of the Interim Editor, Publications of the AFS
 
During the period of interim editorship and since my earlier report
 
I solicited three manuscripts.  One author indicated an interest in
 
formally submitting a manuscript as soon as it was ready and kept me
 
closely informed of its progress but had not actually submitted it
 
when my term ended.  Two other authors sent me manuscripts in rather
 
preliminary stages.
 I returned them with extensive comments and sug-
gestions and encouraged more formal submissions after revisions had
 
been made.
 I re-established contact with another author who had
 
originally approached AFS about a manuscript before my tenure and whom
 
I had earlier contacted.
 He indicated continuing interest.
 I con-
tinued contact with another author who plans to submit two manuscripts
 
to PAFS.
 I also engaged in discussions with a publisher, Greenwood
 
Press, which expressed some willingness to establish a series in con-
nection with PAlS but few details were actually given.
 The Board was
 
informed of this interest on the part of Greenwood for its May meeting.

. Report of the Editor,  AFS Newsletter
  
The Newsletter published its requisite six issues during the past year,
 
introduced four new features -
 two of which stuck, and received one let-
ter to the editor.  The publication has increasingly become the official
 
organ of the Society, much more heavily devoted to the conduct of Society
 
business than ever before.  As the Centennial approaches and the work of
 
the various CCC committees proliferates I expect this trend to continue.
 
A trend I wish would not continue is the absence of advertisements for
 
academic jobs in the Newsletter. 
It is the rare academic job which is
 
posted in the Newsletter, which by virtue of its bi-monthly publication
 
schedule might be regarded as a more appropriate and useful means of
 
informing the field of job openings than similar English or anthropology
 
organs.
 
As ever, I welcome members' contributions t0 the Newsletter, and regularly
 
reward them with free books.
 Please send me your notable quotes, bib-
l
iographic nuggets, interesting photographs, conference reports, and
 
in the absence of news per se,  your letters.
 Double-spaced, please.

. Report of the Program Committee
 
Of the 308 submissions for the 1
984 AFS meeting in San Diego we accep-
ted 305 and rejected none.
 We asked 22 submitters to revise their ab-
stracts; all resubmitted except for three people.  Out of 1
7 initial
 
media submissions we--accepted 1
5 f
ilms or videotapes; two were with-
drawn.
 This year's program has 83 Sessions, beginning Thursday, October
 
1
1 at 8
:30 and ending Sunday, October 1
4 at 1
2:15 pm.
 After having
 
modified slightly last year's Call for Papers, we would l
ike to point
 
out areas where the Call for Papers or the rules for submission need
 
further clarification and to recommend to AFS members additional re-
visions or modifications.
 
While the Call for Papers has been refined each year, making the chairs'
 
job simpler, it should be further clarified in terms of A-V equipment,
 
Forum submissions, and format for the Short Abstract for Publication.
 
We should ask members to circle the appropriate A-V equipment, or we
 
should respace the form, now ambiguous, so that it clearly indicates
 
the submitter's choice.
 The Call for Papers copy should instruct
 
Forum chairs to include the registration f
ees for all participants,
 
and the Long Abstract form should provide space for their names.
 
While repeating the request for double-spaced copy almost eliminated
 
single-spaced abstracts (we only received 5
), we had to retype 72
 
Short Abstracts either because they needed editing or because they didn't
 
include the author's name, affiliation, or paper t
itle.
 I suggest we
 
add a request in bold-face type to "PLEASE PROVIDE CAMERA-READY COPY."
 
Since most folklorists adhered to the 100 word limit this year, we pro-
bably should retain the warning that we'll only print the f
irst 1
00
 
words of abstracts.  Also, I propose a minor revision to eliminate a
 
tedious job: adding "Please clip out here" on the dotted l
ine of the
 
registration form.
 Finally, ye should ask for two copies of the Short
 
Abstract to eliminate the need for file cards on submissions.
 
We make these suggestions because we would like to simplify the Co-
chairs' job, which has become a larger one each year.
 Since we probably
 
spent as much time handling special cases and incomplete submissions as
 
we spent arranging the paper sessions, we suggest that the Society require
 
the Program Committee Co-chairs to enforce rules for submission as stated
 
in the Call for Papers.
 While this suggestion may seem to '
oelaboi th e
.
 
point, I believe it is necessary in order to prevent the Co-chairs from
 
being placed in an awkward position when dealing with infractions of the
 
rules by their seniors.
 In particular, we need to refuse submissions
 
without registration fees, and to refuse incomplete panels.
 If we en-
courage all panel organizers to submit their material as a package, ra-
ther than allowing the panelists to send in their own abstracts and fees
 
we will eliminate a major potential source of extra work.
 The closer we
 
can  model our requirements after larger organizations in the social
 
sciences or humanities, organizations that require complete, camera-ready
 
copy well in advance of their meetings, the more efficiently we can ar-
range sessions and panels for the meeting.
 
In fact, since organized panels are the easiest ones to deal with and order
 
into a program, we should encourage submission of panels rather than in-
dividual papers.
 (MLA, for example, accepts only organized panels).  We
 
might adopt the common practice of publishing proposed panels, along with
 
the names and affiliations of their chairs, in the newsletter prior to the
 
Call for Papers issue.
 This strategy would allow members who otherwise
 
would not be in contect with their colleagues to form part of a panel.
 
We also should encourage section leaders to organize panels based on their
 
particular topic, perhaps by offering them back-to-back panel and section
 
meeting times.
 
In closing, we would like to thank all those who helped us with our job,
 
either as film or paper evaluators, or through their advice and patience.
 
Lucille Horn's service, in particular, was invaluable, as was the advice
 
of last year's chairs.  And we owe special thanks to the UCLA Writing
 
Programs for financial support.

. Report of the Delegate to the ACLS
 
It is perhaps unfair to begin this report by quoting The Waste Land, but
 
during the three or four hours approaching an April midnight that I sat in
 
the TWA waiting room at Kennedy in hopes that my overdue flight would soon
 
be called and later simply that it would be called, the lines
 
April is the cruelest month, breeding
 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
 
Memory and desire, stirring
 
Dull roots with spring rain.
 
kept running around in my head.
 They were incongruously coupled with a
 
line from A.E. Housman, "Terence, this is stupid stuff."  I was on my way
 
back to Indiana University in Bloomington, after having attended the
 
Sixty-Fifth Annual meeting of the American Council of Learned Societies
 
to which I am your delegate.
-
The ACLS meeting of delegates always takes place in April, about that
 
time when the young sun "hath in the Ram his halfe course yronne."
 
(Tedious hours spent in airports drive me to ponderous and pretentious
 
ponderings.)  It is true, however, as my earlier reports have indicated,
 
that while I thoroughly enjoy serving as the American Folklore Society's
 
delegate to the ACLS, and while the experience has generally been intellec-
tually stimulating, in practical terms April has often been the cruelest
 
r
'onth: airline food all know about, airline drinks cost more than those
 
in fashionable bars, and hotel rooms at the Roosevelt are generally
 
miserable.
 But enough of this which you have heard or read about before.
 
What of the meetings themselves!
 
There was, of course, the usual inescapable business.  The nominating
 
committee nominated Georges May as Chairman of the Council, Neil Harris
 
as Vice-Chairman, Winfred Lehman as Secretary, and Gordon Ray as Treas-
urer.
 They were elected unanimously.
 The minutes of the last meeting
 
were approved, and the American Association for the Advancement of
 
Slavic Studies was accepted as a new constituent member of the ACLS
 
with only one dissenting vote.
 A number of other issues not directly
 
related to the American Folklore Society were dealt with satisfactorily,
 
and they showed that the American Council of Learned Societies i
s com-
posed of a number of societies which are in basic agreement.
 
As has been true recently, the highlight of the meeting was the Charles
 
Homer Haskins Memorial Lecture, this year given by Professor Emeritus
 
Mary Haas who reflected on her years as a f
ieldworker in lirguistics
 
and as a teacher.  A pioneer in the study of linguistics in North America,
 
Professor Haas revealed the deep satisfaction that can come to one thor-
oughly devoted to a developing discipline.
 Appropriately, Professor Haas'
 
lecture was given in the Pierpont Morgan Library; I say appropriately be-
cause I can imagine no place better in which to discuss "The Life of
 
Learning."
 
One other thing ought to be mentioned about Thursday, April  1
2th,  the
 
day involved with ?mixing memory with desire."  Just before the business
 
meeting and just after a luncheon, Mr. William Bennett, Chairman of the
 
National Endowment for the Humanities, spoke about national support for
 
the humanities.
 He was mildly optomistic, but he did point out that if we
 
wish to "breed lilacs out of a dead land" we must do more than simply stir
 
"dull roots with spring rain."  We need to actively assist the NEH with
 
better public relations and imaginative projects.  We need to show that what
 
is best for the humanities is also best for the country and humanity.
 The
 
NEl
l is up for reauthorization this year by Congress and i
t i
s by no means
 
certain that Congress is convinced of its necessity.
 
By now the reasons that the quoted lines from The Waste Land came to me
 
should be obvious, but about the l
ine from Housman?  Friday's meetings
 
were devoted to a series of lectures and comments devoted to "The World
 
of Learning in an Age of Computers."  The papers were delivered by Professor
 
Sherry Turkle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology--"The Second
 
Self: Computers and the Human Spirit"--Marcus McConson, Director of the
 
American Antiquarian Society--"The Great Iron Wheel of Scholarship in
 
Modern Times"--and Peter Lyman of Michigan State University--"The Book and
 
Computer in the Age of Literacy."  Discussant moderators were Leo Marx of
 
MIT and Jerome Brunner of the New School for Social Research.
 Those of
 
you who have recently read about Ms. Turkie in Time Magazine know of her
 
and her research.
 I regret to say, however, that, even though a large
 
number of the delegates somewhat sheepishly admitted to owning and using
 
a personal computer, primarily for word-processing, they generally agreed
 
that "Terence, this is stupid stuff."  In subsequent discussions,
 
it became obvious that most delegates feared that computers would
 
inhibit human imagination.
 Indeed, to paraphrase Housman, it became
 
apparent that on late Friday afternoon:
 
Books do more than computers can
 
To justify God's ways to man.
 
Indeed, I can continue with Housman, and substituting New York for
 
Ludlow, say:
 
Oh, I have been to Ludlow fair,
 
And left my necktie God knows where,
 
And carried half-way home, or near,
 
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer;
 
Then the world seemed none so bad
 
And I myself a sterling lad.
 
Unfortunately, however, "The world, it was an old world yet,! I was I
,
 
my things were wet."  If computers can't substitute for books, one can
 
at least agree that
 
Malt does more than Milton can
 
To justify God-'s ways to man

I received the attached copy of a letter Bruce Jackson wrote you
 
today,  and since I'm leaving for Atlanta this afternoon for a few days
 
I decided to set a couple of things straight before I left.
 
I did not say the things Bruce attributes to me in his letter.
 
I did not tell him that "it might have been better to have attached
 
specific names to each of the presidential styles."  I told him that
 
I would not print the portion of the presidential report which in-
cludes the imprecise references to former presidents.
 I gave Bruce the
 
option of supplying the names, and told him that I would edit that por-
t
ion altogether unless he did so by October 23.  My reason was that
 
I believe the AFSNL should be used to advance and/or clarify the Society's
 
business, and the opening section of the president's report does neither.
 
Judging Society officers - past or present - is a valid and useful exercise,
 
but one which cannot be conducted within the context of a guessing game.
 
I also did not quote you to Bruce as saying that "if the election
 
of Fellows did become fully democratic you and several other older members
 
would feel compelled to withdraw from the American Folklore Society."
 I
 
told Bruce that you had told me that if the presidential report was pub-
lished in the Newsletter in its present form you intended to resign from
 
the Society along with several other older members.
 I passed your com-
ment along as one of several considerations I believed Bruce ought to
 
keep in mind when he made his decision to supply names or be edited.
 
I do not approve of having statements I did not make attributed to
 
me,  and I do not approve of having the judgements I have to make as
 
Secretary and Newsletter editor misconstrued as part of proceedings
 
(the status of the AFS Fellows) to which they do not refer.
 I regret
 
the further complication of already difficult Society deliberations
 
on these matters,  and remain willing to work toward resolving them.

I am saddened and puzzled and perturbed by your request for the censoring
 
of my presidential report. I am saddened at its obloquy and distance, I am
 
puzzled by its humorless insistence on blind reverence, and I am perturbed
 
at its dismissal of serious and, I think, restrained judgment. I am
 
particularly offended by the censuring rhetoric, both in the suggestion
 
that former AFS officers and t
he Fellows' election procedures are exalted
 
beyond evaluation or examination, and i
n the assertion that I should not be
 
permitted to speak my mind.  You err, believe me, i
f you think I haven't
 
spoken it in restrained or kindly fashion.
 
And you err more profoundly i
f you think I intend those characterizations in
 
any mean spirit. I take my responsibility as an officer of the Society with
 
great seriousnes and I feel dismayed and, as a member, cheated when
 
someone elected to the office of president chooses to treat the job as a
 
joke, to trivialize the work of the other elected board members, to think
 
the enterprise worth so little attention that attendance at meetings is not
 
worth the time, or to abandon any notion of doing any work whatsoever.
 
I am d
isheartened when a h
ighly-regarded former president of the Society
 
tells me a few weeks after my election that the work is not worth doing
 
because nothing useful will be accomplished. It may be, as Charley Camp
 
suggests, that it would have been better to have attached specific names to
 
each of the presidential styles. I thought the way I d
id it would cause
 
less harm, and if I was wrong i
n that I am truly sorry. I am not in the
 
least sorry for pointing out to the membership that there have indeed been
 
great differences in the kinds of service they have gotten for their votes.
 
(
I should mention, and you may even be aware, that at least one former
 
president was in total agreement with the characterizations and told me he
 
was delighted that everyone else got a chance to know how things seem from
 
our s
ide of the affair.) Doing the work of this Society takes a great deal
 
of t
ime and a great deal of energy; i
f someone does not believe that work
 
is worthwhile he or she should not take a space on the ballot that might be
 
occupied by someone who believes the work matters.
 
In any case, I would think a witty and spirited riposte should be the
 
rejoinder, not suppression. Can you seriously think these persons are
 
injured? Whatever is this coddling you propose really about? Several people
 
have told me that you are truly and deeply d
isturbed about what you
 
perceive as an insult to and assault on the Fellows, and they suggest that
 
is the true subtext of your protest. I
f so, be assured that that part of
 
the president's report meant e
xactly what it said and no more. I think
 
having persons honored as Folklore Fellows is an excellent practice; I do
 
not believe, and I doubt many other folkorists believe, that this Society's
 
members should not be permitted to have any role in that honoring other
 
Bess Hawes--15 October 1984--2
 
than being told about decisions made by a group o
f persons most o
f whose
 
names they do not even know. As I said i
n my report and as I said at the
 
Friday n
ight meeting, I do not know who the Fellows are and I do not know
 
who the Fellows' officers are, and I know no cne else not a member o
f the
 
Fellows who knows who the Fellows are and who their officers are.
 Three
 
times in a s
ingle year the president of the AFS requested of an officer of
 
the Fellows a l
ist of the Fellows members and officers; three t
imes that
 
request was ignored. Just what k
ind of honor i
s it that cannot be made
 
public?
 
I
f you perceive my attempt to encourage the Fellows to abide by the set of
 
democratic principles all other sections of the AFS find unobiectionble as
 
an insult to your family honor, let me a
ssure you that I d
idn't and don't
 
mean that.
 
If some parts o
f this response are i
nexact responses to your charges,
 
forgive me, but you did not let me know your complaint directly, nor d
id
 
you do me the courtesy of sending me a copy of the message you had B
ill
 
Ivey read to the Executive Board on your behalf. My memory of Bill's
 
reading i
s perhaps a l
ittle blurred because of my astonishment at the
 
moment of his reading that a person who is as capable of direct action as
 
anyone I know in the Society d
id not i
n three days speak to me d
irectly
 
about something that mattered to her so much. I was dismayed that you of
 
all persons seemed to be saying that the members of the Society should be
 
permitted no voice in the s
ingle honor the Society itself bestows, and
 
saddened that you of all folklorists should believe that o
fficials who show
 
contempt for their office should be exempt from any form of subsequent
 
criticism.
 
One further point. Charley Camp tells me you told h
im that i
f the election
 
of Fellows did become fully democratic you and several other older members
 
would feel compelled to withdraw from the American Folklore Society. I
 
don't know why this should seem to you necessary or even desirable;  i
t
 
would surely appear to non-Fellow  l
ike the most egregious k
ind of e
litism
 
or cronyism. I hope you will, on reflection, decide that the profession
 
would be far better served by taking part in public discussion about things
 
that matter rather than by abandoning entirely the only forum for
 
professional discussion we share. A great number of people, i
ncluding your
 
father and your brother, worked hard to show the world at large the value
 
of studying and preserving and presenting folklore materials. I cannot
 
believe that any of those workers would have much respect for a decision to
 
quit talking merely because access to the giving of honors was opened to
 
Society members not in positions o
f power and authority.
 
S
incerely yours,
 
Bruce Jackson

Friday's mail brought the minutes o
f our several San D
iego AFS F
_ecutive
 
Board and plenary meetings. Monday's mail brought Charley's November I
 
mailing to the board, which included Bess Hawes's 1
4 October letter to B
ili
 
Ivey and her 22 October letter to me (
the first t
ime I
've seen either). I
 
have two minor corrections to the minutes (
both are noted below) and two
 
major questions. The questions have to do with the second vote reported
 
under item 8 in the minutes of the Sunday morning meeting. That vote took
 
p
lace after I left and I was until Friday unaware of it.
 
Even i
f I were not personally i
nvolved i
n this, I would f
ind i
n this affair
 
a serious v
iolation of professional conduct--by the Executive Board and by
 
the executive secretary -treasurer. But I am i
nvolved, and I f
ind the
 
actions of the Executive Board and the executive secretary-treasurer

So far as I can tell, the only reason for the censorship was Bess Hawes's
 
complaint. There was no talk of censorship before that, and neither was
 
there any suggestion at our meeting that anyone else had asked the board to
 
take any action at all. Bess told me in Washington last week that she wrote
 
her letter to B
ill because she was angry at my report and that she is no
 
longer anary because the matter has been taken care of. I assume that by
 
"
taken care of" she meant the e
xcision from my statement of the paragraphs
 
she found objectionable. I find it outrageous that a report from a
 
president that outlines some matters of real concern to the Society s
hould
 
Jan Brunvand---6 November 1984--2
 
be censored s
imply because one powerful government official found that
 
report objectionable. I have many t
imes during our meetings heard what I
 
thought were paranoid fears of the i
nterference of government agencies i
n
 
professional folklore matters; this is the first t
ime I have ever seen i
t
 
happen, the f
irst t
ime I know of such a thing happening overtly, and t
he
 
first time I know of no one on the Board raising the question of the
 
propriety of the Board's leaping into retreat because of governmental
 
displeasure at the actions of a Society officer. What happens next t
ime---
when it's one of the Board's substantive resolutions that causes i
re? Does
 
that get stricken from the record too?
 
As far as the content of my report goes--if any member o
f the Society felt
 
him- or herself slighted or insulted by it or misrepresented by it, he or
 
she could have addressed me or the E
xecutive Board d
irectly. No one d
id.
 
None of those who might have thought themselves the subject of unfair
 
characterization by me is, so far as I know, inarticulate i
n oral or print
 
forms of communication. I did not expect that my report would bring
 
pleasure to the former president who held the Executive Board's work i
n
 
contempt or the one who told me that the work was not worth doing or the
 
one who d
idn't think the meetings important enough
 
to attend or the one who
 
was incapable of or disinterested in chairing a meeting. But pleasure of
 
past presidents was not, I presume, what the two Executive Board votes and
 
Charley's censoring were about.
 
The Board chose not to d
iscuss the conduct I reported, which i
s fully
 
within its purview; it i
nstead elected to twice consider resolutions that
 
had to do with whether or not my behavior should be censured by enforced
 
censorship, and I do not think that was within its purview at a
ll.  (
I take
 
an ad hoc consideration of special restriction on expression applied to me
 
and no other member of the Society an action of professional censure.)  I
 
think something is seriously skewed when what might be my impertinence (
or,
 
as Kenny Goldstein put it, my problem "respecting older folklorists") is
 
singled out for Executive Board action but not the behaviors that elicited
 
that impertinence. I think something is seriously skewed when two
 
resolutions having to do with my work as president enter the Society's
 
records, but neither the letter from the government official that
 
precipitated those actions or my reply to the oral reading of that letter
 
enters the Society's records.
 
I think the wrong president was s
ingled out for punishment. I don't think
 
the job of the AFS president is similar to the president of Rotary or the
 
Junior Chamber of Commerce; our job isn't to say how swell things are and
 
how swell everyone is. My action was simple enough, and I was willing to
 
stand the personal heat for it: I said publicly that people who take
 
Society jobs should be held accountable for their stewardship, and I
 
suggested that some people who had taken the job of AFS president i
n recent
 
years had not provided the membership the service it deserved, ixpected, or
 
had been promised. And I know from conversations with nearly every recent
 
member of the AFS Executive Board that my remarks were neither
 
idiosyncratic nor unfair. Saying publicly what so many of us had so
 
frequently said privately was all I wanted to do, and I was content to let
 
the matter rest there. I asked the Executive Board to take no action i
n the
 
matter because I thought no action was necessary. I thought--and I still
 
think--that changes in matters l
ike this occur when the people affected
 
know what i
s going on, not when some committee or other passes a resolution
 
Jan Brunvgnd--6 November 1984---3
 
i
nstructing everyone how to behave. That's what t
he F
irst Amendment i
s a
ll
 
about. Without a free marketplace for i
nformation and i
deas only the
 
purveyors of i
nformation are truly free. I was happy to have had my say.
 
The say dealt with something unpleasant, which was why I tried to make a
 
l
ittle l
ight of it. But I thought--and still think--what I said should have
 
been said.  I also think that Bess or anyone else is entitled to d
isagree
 
with me and to make that d
isagreement known i
n any public or private forum
 
that seems appropriate. Bess Hawes' d
isapproval of my conduct is not the
 
issue here. The issue is the way the Board and Charley responded to her
 
expression of disapproval.
 
And here is something else that i
s i
mportant: It was sufficient for me to
 
have had my say in the zeroxed version of my report that was included i
n
 
everyone's registration packet. Had anvone said to me that he or she
 
thought the point was made and that things would be s
impler and n
icer i
f I
 
would agree to a revision of the president's report, I would have said,
 
Sure, why not, it's f
ine with me, the i
nformal channels will transmit the
 
tune. Had the reasonable and unobjectionable argument Bess presents in her
 
letter of 22 October been presented to me, I would have said, Sure, cut i
t,
 
I don't mind.  But no one said those things and that choice was never
 
offered me. Instead, I had a phone call from Charley Camp in which I was
 
told--not asked, told--that i
f I revised my remarks according to h
is
 
specifications they would be printed, otherwise they would be censored.
 
How would you have responded? Earlier I sat there while the Board had i
ts
 
deliberation on the f
irst question and I sat here and read three weeks
 
later about the second. According to the minutes, only
 members of the
 
Executive Board thought the resolution instructing Charley to treat my
 
report as any other warranted an affirmative vote. I don't know what was
 
the context of that vote, but the s
imple report appalls, saddens, and
 
frightens me. I
f my remarks d
ispleasing some vague and pretty much
 
anonymous establishment are so quickly and facilely.censored now, what
 
happens i
f the Board ever deals with something really substantial? How
 
rapid will be the flight from responsibility then?
 
Bess is also r
ight when she suggests that AFS ground is probably not where
 
last stands on anything should be made. The school lunch program was cut
 
again this year and our nuclear warhead production i
ncreased again this
 
year. Acid rain continues to render more and more of the world's natural
 
oxygen factories useless. The national debt i
ncreases, my confidence that
 
my children will get to d
ie of simple old age decreases, and the mechanisms
 
of industry and government controlling both just hum a
long as usual.
 
Shortly after the AFS meeting I learned that a writer I knew had been found
 
in a cabin in Bolinas, perhaps a month after he'd put a bullet through h
is
 
head, and a friend was executed by the State of Texas. Those things do
 
throw this AFS mess into a d
ifferent perspective.
 
But the perspective is not one that leads me to d
ismiss what happe -ed;
 
rather it leads me not to stand for it. I do not deserve this k
ind of
 
treatment at the Board's hands and the Board does not have the right to do
 
it. I resent having done by force what could easily have been done by
 
reason. I do not wish to continue this time-consuming and by now perhaps
 
pointless series of memos and countermemos. There are, as Bess says,
 
important things to be done. The next, and I hope final, move i
n this
 
affair is the E
xecutive Board's.
 
I
 
Jan Brunvand--6 November 1984---4
 
My report was s
ingularly censored. Two motions which were out of order (
the
 
Constitution doesn't provide the Board authority to censor; the executive
 
secretary doesn't need a resolution by the Board telling him to do his job )
 
were not only discussed but entered into the record. The Executive Board
 
refused to instruct the executive secretary-treasurer when he asked for
 
guidance that there was an absolute need to apply to my report the same
 
standards he applied to all others. The membership of the American Folklore
 
Society and I am owed a formal and public apology from both Charley and
 
from the Executive Board, and neither of us should have to wait until the
 
Board's May 1985 meeting for things to be set right.

FROM

RE :
 Bruce Jackson's letter of 6 Nov--lber
 
First the omissions.  It should be s
tated at the beginning of item 8
 
that Bill Ivey read a letter addressed to the board by Bess Lomax Hawes and
 
then made his motion in response to it.  This parallels the references in the
 
minutes to inquiries from Gary Alan Fine (item 1
2 on 1
1 October) and from
 
Wayland Hand (item 1
1 on 14 October). It should further be stated that Bruce
 
Jackson left the meeting after the first motion in item 8
. Finally, it should
 
be stated that "in response to the Executive Secretary-Treasurer's request
 
for guidance in the matter referred to in the previous motion it was then
 
Were the motions in order?  I remind you that no point of order was
 
raised when Ivey moved; had it been, I would have declared his motion to be
 
in order as a valid response to a communication to the board from an AFS
 
member.  Similarly with the second motion, considering the previous one, the
 
discussion of it, and the vote, I feel that it was also an acceptable motion
 
for consideration as new business.
 
Board memo -
 1
6 November 1
984
 
I do not believe that the Board owes an apology to Bruce Jackson for
 
matters treated in item 8
. My reasoning is that motions may legally be made
 
in response to members' communications to the Board, and that we recognize
 
that sometimes motions are made simply to put a matter of concern on the
 
floor for discussion.  Individuals on the board then vote their separate
 
views on each matter.  While the Constitution does not require the Board to
 
instruct the Executive Secretary-Treasurer either to edit or not to edit
 
annual reports for the AFSNL, the Board regularly advises or directs this
 
officer's activities on behalf of the Society. Special circumstances
 
prevailing in this matter included the controversial nature of the
 
President's Report (
reflected not only in the Hawes letter but also in the
 
Question and Answer session and in discussion on the previous motion), the
 
early deadline for the next ASFNL, the lack of precedent f
or having a report
 
from the President, and even the length of the report.
 
Further, I do not believe Bruce is right in assuming that votes against
  
the second motion (or abstentions) were votes for censoring him; in fact,
 
they may well have been votes in complete agreement with his view that a
 
motion directing the s
ecretary to publish the report a
s submitted was out of
 
order or unnecessary.  Another valid way to interpret the vote might be to
 
assume that it served to reject the idea of any editorial changes to said
 
report.  In a way the motion was an attempt at a piece of housekeeping,
 
something like item 2 of the 1
1 October meeting.  The Constitution does not
 
say that the Board needs to vote to hold a cocktail party at annual meetings,
 
but a need was felt f
or such a motion.  The motives of those voting on this
 
motion are unclear, since the seconder is a well-known abstainer while the
 
abstaining vote was cast b
y one known t
o b
e quite convivial.  Each, no doubt,
 
had his reasons, but the minutes do not reveal what they were.
 
There remains the question whether the Executive Secretary-Treasurer
 
had authority to remove certain portions of the President's Report before
 
publishing it in the ASFNL. Lacking a Constitutional directive applying
 
specifically to this unprecedented report, recalling that the whole report
 
was in fact already published in the meeting packet, considering the
 
discussion of the report both in t
he Board meeting and outside it, and noting
 
the early deadline for the next issue of the Newsletter, I personally feel
 
that the secretary acted responsibly, and I support his action.  (
I also
 
recall that Bruce Jackson had made the same criticisms of past presidents in
 
his statement two years ago when he ran for office, so his feelings on the
 
matter were made known even earlier.)
 
In effect, what I am suggesting here is t
hat it was said to Bruce in
 
San Diego--as he claims was not said (page 3 of his letter) —in various ways,
 
though perhaps not directly enough, that since he had offered his criticisms
 
very clearly in the photocopied version of his report, it would be better for
 
the Society if his denigrating references to past presidents were not
 
-2
 
Board memo -
 16 November 1984
 
included in the more permanent and official form of the Newsletter. If an
 
apology is needed, it should be for not saying this in specific terms and not
 
saying it directly to Bruce. I do apologize to Bruce, and to the Board, for
 
not doing this myself at the time of t
he annual meeting.
 
I dispute Bruce's claim that the word "censored" should replace
 
"edited" in item 8
; I believe that the motion we voted on is correctly
 
reported as it stands.  But one further minor change needs to be made in the
 
minutes of the business meeting: Ken Pen man's name is twice misspelled.
 
Again, I invite your responses, asking only that they concern the
 
issues in question and be circulated t
o t
he whole Board.

The Sutton-Smith manuscript i
s a c
lassic and should certainly be
 
republished and I haven't the least idea why it has taken me so
 
l
ong to say so.  I think it i
s simple brain fatigue.  I
t is
 
exhausting being a public servant; there are so many of them and
 
s
o few of you.
 
Sutton-Smith observes c
learly and writes with s
tyle and pith.
 
Personally, my favorite books are long on data, so the angtassing
 
of detail doesn't bother me in the &east.  I think most books
 
talk too much about too l
ittle.
 
I
t has, of course, gone out of fashion to publish l
ong compendiums
 
of raw data, e
specially in terms of behavioral observation.  This
 
gives the book a pleasantly dated quality, as far as I am concerned.
 
But for that reason, you might want to think about getting Sutton-
Smith to expand the preface a trifle, setting the book historically
 
in terms of what was known (
or thought) about childrens play in
 
1948.  That might, of course, be a boring exercise for Sutton-Smith
 
who doubtless has other things to think about; in that case, there
 
are plenty of other people who could do it and enjoy i
t, and I do
 
think i
t would make the book more understandable to some.
 
As for publishing under the American Folklore Society imprimatur,
 
why not?  I
t's a good book.
 
I really don't think the above remarks are worth $75.00.  If you
 
can think of a f
olklorically noble cause (
preferably benefitting
 
graduate s
tudents) that I could donate to, I
'd be happy to oblige;
 
in that case my s
ocial security number i

o
ther hand, I
'd be just as happy to keep this between us as friends.

Dear Bess  (may I call you
 
Before you is the HISTORY OF CHILDREN'S PLAY: THE NEW
 ZEALAND PLAYGROUND,
 
l8 O-l950, by Brian Sutton-Smith.
 
First off, I need to know whether you feel A HISTORY OF CHILDREN'S PLAY
 
is truly worth publishing.  Will it bring credit to the Press and to the author?
 
Is the manuscript an important contribution to the field of children's folklore
 
and to children's studies in general?  Does it utilize methodology creatively
 
(and correctly)?  Does the manuscript make sense; in other words, is the style
 
clear, concise, and readable?  Is there sufficient interest in this country for
 
a history of children's play in a non-American setting?  Finally, and briefly,
 
how could the manuscript be improved?  Now I know that what we have here is
 
primarily descriptive rather than analytical.
 The question then follows: Is the
 
wealth of material enough in itself and presented in such a way as to satisfy
 
the field in general?
 
There is also a peripheral question concerning the American Folklore Society,
 
since we, the University of Pennsylvania Press, now publish the Society's books.
 
Should you feel the manuscript worth publishing, do you think it would be appro-
priate for the Society's book series?
 
For a deadline, could you have the report finished and returned to me, with
 
the manuscript, by December 18?  I can pay an honorarium of 875, but you'll have
 
to be sure to include your social security number with the report--Moloch, our
 
payroll computor, gets nasty without it.
 
The best,

AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER
 
Dear Bess:
 
June 11,  1991
 
Thank you for agreeing to participate in our meeting on June 20th
 
and 21st.
 Judging from the comments Peter Bartis has conveyed to me,  the
 
reactions of the pa ticipancs we have invited suppGrts our concerns and
 
reinforces our hope for positive results.
 The subjects we will be discussing
 
are of urgent importance to the development of our field, and each participant
 
will bring to the table not only personal insights but connection with an
 
institution or organization which can play an important role in that
 
development.
 
Let me report that I
've extended an invitation to Bess Lomax
 
Hawes, of the National Endowment for the Arts' Folk Arts Program, to
 
participate in the meeting as much as her busy schedule will allow.
 She has
 
long considered the issues at hand, and has often expressed her concern that
 
our profession heed them more attentively.
 
As our professional society approached its Centennial in the late
 
1980s, many of us allowed ourselves to reflect more broadly on the mission,
 
history, and future of our profession.
 For me the reflection had the effect
 
of renewing my personal commitment to the ideals and values which have long
 
animated folklorists in America.
 Seen from that vantage point,  two issues
 
seem to me central to our development as a professional field in the years
 
ahead.
 The first is the need, often discussed by us in various forums,  for
 
professional training which better prepares students for public-service
 
careers.
 The second, which has received less structured discussion in the
 
past decade,  is the urgent need for minority involvement in our profession.
 
Although our meeting will discuss them as separate agenda items,
 
the two issues are not unrelated.
 I am perhaps not the best judge of how our
 
field is perceived within the academy.
 But I can vouch for it that public
 
folklorists are confronted daily with questions regarding the dearth of
 
minorities in our profession, and confounded daily in their search for
 
professional fieldworkers, consultants, and staff members with special bonds
 
to minority and ethnic communities.
 Such a dearth would be a matter of
 
concern in any field, but it is particularly painful to contemplate in a field
 
which has historically felt it has a special mission in preserving and
 
understanding the cultural expressions of minority communities in America.
 
Looked at more broadly,  it suggests a larger lack of coordination between the
 
development of the fastest growing arena within our professional field and our
 
field's strategic planning for graduate recruitment and professional training.
 
-
2-
At the risk of sounding trite,  these are not simply problems but
 
opportunities.  As increasing numbers of professionals move into public-
service careers, and as our professional ranks broaden with more
 
representatives of diverse cultural communities, our profession will be
 
measurably strengthened, both in its inner integrity and in the visible niche
 
it occupies in the public eye.  As leaders in our discipline, we have both a
 
responsibility to safeguard and an opportunity to foster the future of our
 
profession, by expanding the range of job opportunities for our students and
 
by seeking out the widest array of talents and viewpoints to attract into our
 
ranks.
 
Although this is a planning meeting, and not a formal
 
representation of institutional views, we hope that our second day of meetings
 
will result in a set of guiding resolutions and a series of recommendations
 
for future action.
 I think such an objective will move our meeting along and
 
leave us with a sense of accomplishment.
 Our current plan is to convene twice
 
daily.
 Session I will discuss methods for improving training for public-
service careers; session II will focus on methods for improving minority
 
recruitment and participation in our field; and sessions III and IV will
 
continue those themes while also focusing on the development of resolutions
 
and recommendations respectively.
 If you have any thoughts regarding this
 
general agenda, please let me know;  there will of course be plenty of leeway
 
for excursions into related issues if you so desire.
 
I look forward to our meeting, and I hope your stay in Washington proves
 
pleasant.

I was pleased to hear of your interest in our upcoming planning meeting
 
on methods for improving training for public service careers and minority
 
participation in our profession.  As meeting coordinator, I would like to
 
formally invite you to participate.
 I
've enclosed the meeting proposal and
 
the list of those attend 4.
nR.
 
During my discussions with participants I stressed that this i
s a
 
planning meeting from which we should develop resolutions and recommendations
 
for future actions.
 The meeting was developed in response to a number of
 
calls from our colleagues for the Center to serve as a catalyst for action on
 
these two issues--issues which may emerge as the leading professional concerns
 
for the 1990s.
 I know we share similar thoughts on these matters and that you
 
have long been an outstanding spokesperson for both causes.
 I
'll look forward
 
to your participation.

PLANNING COMMITTEE ON IMPROVED TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SERVICE
 
CAREERS AND MINORITY PARTICIPATION IN THE PROFESSION
 
Purpose:  To  discuss  and  identify mutual  actions which may be undertaken by
 
universities, federal agencies, and the American Folklore Society to 1
) increase
 
minority participation in the field of folklore and folklife studies,  and 2
)
 
provide  training  which  will  support  and  improve  public  service  career
 
opportunities for folklorists.
 
Design:
 The participants  serve  as members  of a planning committee  and may
 
develop  immediate  and  long-range  recommendations  which  address  the  above
 
concerns.
 A wide range of actions may be considered including future meetings
 
and  conferences,  surveys,  recruitment  goals  and  techniques,  and  curricula
 
development.
 Members of this one-time planning committee may also recommend
 
appropriate participants for additional meetings.
 
Participants  represent  the  three  academic  folklore  programs  with  the
 
largest  annual  recruitment  of  students,  minority  viewpoints,  the  American
 
Folklore Society,  the AFS Public Programs Section,  and folklorists  in public
 
service careers.

Let u
s l
ook f
i
rst a
t an a
rtistic expression which r
eached i
t
s height i
n
 
about January 1987 -
 a l
am l
euang 2 o
r Lao f
o
lk opera based on t
raditional
 
h
istorical/mythological s
tories o
f k
ings and queens, p
rinces and  beggars,
 
gods and f
a
iries come t
o earth.  (
SLIDE) I
nformants say t
hat i
n Laos such
 
performances, which usually t
ook p
lace a
t t
emple f
a
irs, m
ight go on f
or two
 
o
r t
hree days, w
ith audience members coming and going. 3 I
n S
t. Louis, t
he
 
t
ales (
l
euang) were s
taged against e
laborate painted backdrops o
f palaces
 
and f
orests.  (
SLIDE) The main performers wore f
ancy costumes, mostly satin
 
s
ewn w
ith e
laborate designs o
f sequins.  Added t
o t
he ef
fect was f
acial
 
make-up, i
ncluding a white base, l
i
pstick and r
ouge and d
ramatic eyebrows,
 
and o
ther details. (
SLIDE)  Young g
irls a
lso danced, as a k
ind o
f c
horus,
 
wearing t
raditional s
kirts and hair o
rnaments. (
SLIDE)
 
Within t
his movement t
here were f
our l
eaders, a
l
l men (
women p
layed a
 
l
argely subsidiary r
o
le i
n t
he l
am l
euang )
. The f
our b
rokered very d
if
ferent
 
but not conflicting, perspectives.  The o
rganization o
f t
he l
am l
euang
 was
 
t
r
iggered by t
he a
rrival o
f several newly r
esettled r
efugees w
ith experience
 
i
n t
he genre (
Rynearson and DeVoe 1986).  Perhaps t
he most i
mportant o
f
 
t
hese was a
 man I
 s
hall here call Khambanh. (
SLIDE) He had been a
 
p
rofessional s
inger/dancer i
n Laos where he a
lso l
earned t
o paint t
he huge
 
s
tage backdrops.  I
t was h
is experience which i
nclined t
he community
 
t
oward a l
am l
euang ,  as opposed t
o some o
ther musical f
orm.  There were
 
many o
ther very s
killed s
ingers, but he was a
lways c
learly t
he "
star."
 
(
SLIDE)  He convinced t
he community t
hat w
ith h
is help t
hey could
 
r
econstruct an authentic l
am l
euang ,  "
the r
eal t
hing."
 
A somewhat d
if
ferent position on expressing Lao culture was t
aken by
 
"
Noukone," (
SLIDE) t
he musical l
eader o
f t
he t
roupe.  Musicians a
lso r
ehearsed
 
extensively and t
r
ied t
o r
econstruct t
raditional music.  They were not,
 
however, bound by t
radition as r
egards i
nstruments.  The music was c
learly
 
Lao, but t
he i
nstruments r
eflected current f
ashion, availability and
 
convenience.  One man p
layed a t
raditional xylophone, but another p
layed a
 
very American set o
f d
rums.  (
SLIDE) Most i
n
teresting was Noukone, who i
n
 
addition t
o being t
he band l

The man most concerned w
ith r
econstructing t
he actual s

"
Pasith." (
SLIDE) Not h
imself a very active performer (
he sometimes p
layed
 
t

f t
he d

lso very concerned w
ith establishing t
he words and
 
s
tory l
i
ne f
or each episode.
 Local p
roductions were not as l
ong as t
he Lao
 
o
riginal (
the l

s
t
ill i
t was very d
if
f
icult t

met n

He even paid a

SLIDE) There was no a

o d
raw i
n Americans.  The l
am
 
l
euang  was very def
initely a culturally c
losed setting, and Lao r
ules o
f
 
behavior applied.  As i
s t
ypical o
f Lao events, a
ttention was not f
ocused
 
exclusively on t
he performance.  I
nstead people a
te, d
rank, walked a
round and
 
gossiped w
ith t
heir f
r

he s
tage.
 
The performance was t
he center o
f i
n
terest but by no means t
he exclusive
 
one.  Nevertheless, t
his was a s
cene o
f i
n
tense community a

was a sense o
f excitement and meaningful a

t
 was a p

The l
am l

 was a b
rief but i
n
tense r
evitalization movement
 
expressed t

r
t f

t was as i

t
he d

ack o
f specialists and p

demands o
f American popular media.  As B

Here t
he f

orce o
f t
he r
evitalization movement derived f
rom
 
participants' conviction t
hat t
hey could i

if
ferent f

t
 was as i
f
 t
hey were denying t
he whole

leasurable activity which t
o
 
t
hem, r

i

To me, one o
f t
he most extraordinary t
h
ings about t
he movement was t
he
 
participants' conviction t
hat each "
knew" some part o
f t
he r
eality o
f t

only i
t

f t
he o

l

t
he entire o

t
 was as i
f
, during t
he l
am l

o
f t
he r

hey t

w

o

t was t
his conviction which l

here were
 
many o

imply a

As w
ith most r
evitalization movements, t
he l
am l
euang could not f
orever
 
continue t
o sustain i
t
s i
l
lusion o

hey were not r

A
lthough general enthusiasm r
emained very h
igh i

convinced t
hat t
he only way t
o r
eal success was t
o move t

o California, where l
arger Lao communities could p
resumably
 
s
upport h
is endeavors more p
rof

ucrative upcoming
 
bookings, he abruptly packed a

i

Pheng's departure burst t

hey made no a

continued p
laying f

The second "
Internal" o
r i
n
tra-ethnic event was a performance by a very
 
d
if
ferent g
roup, r
epresenting t
he opposite s
trategy o
f coming t
o t
erms w
ith
 
l
i
fe i
n America.  This was t
he Lao D
isco Band,  a g
roup o
f young r
ock
 
musicians who p
layed f
or public and p
rivate parties.  A
lthough not  a
 
"
t
raditional" a
r
t i
n t
he usual sense, Lao d
isco performances have meaning as
 
a special k
ind o
f s
ignal o
f e
thnic i
dentity.  For t
he l
owland Lao, t
he concept
 
o
f t
raditional (
= symbol o
f cultural r
oots) i
s somewhat complicated by t
heir
 
having been t
he dominant g
roup i
n Laos.  Hence f
eatures o
f l
i
fe i
n t
heir
 
homeland (
l
ike "

isco" music) may be f
or t
hem s
ymbols o

ong ago and
 
f
ar away.  The t
endrils o

 On our r

Lao d
isco was not an e
thnic s
ymbol i
n t
he u
sual sense o
f having been
 
handed down f
rom some d
istant past.  But i
t
 was a mobilizing symbol f
or
 
e
thnic i
dentity t
oday, setting community members of
f f
rom t
he non-Lao
 
s
urrounding t
hem.  Unlike t
he l
am I
euang, Lao d
isco t
argeted a narrow and
 
d
istinct segment o
f t
he population, young and partially acculturated adults,
 
most born i
n Laos and r
aised i
n t
he r
efugee camps and t
he U
.S.  For t
hem,
 
t
heir Lao i
dentity was h
ighly p
roblematic, being both a source o
f p
ride and
 
personal t
ies as well as a s
ign o
f being an "
outsider" on t
he f
r
inge o
f an
 
American culture t
hey both l
i
ke and d
islike.
 
A
lthough t
he Lao d
isco band wore f
ashionable punk-rock c
lothes and u
sed
 
e
lectric i
nstruments, t
heir songs were a
l
l i
n Lao.  They a
re based on t
apes o
f
 
Thai, F
rench and o
ther Lao musicians and on t
heir own compositions.  The m
ix
 
o
f c
ultures and l
i
fe s

s r
ef
lected i
n t
he words o
f one young composer,
 
who says h
is songs t
e
ll o
f "
love, b
roken hearts, and I
 m
iss my country."  I

rew i

External t

demand f
or performers t

 have e

Americans celebrate t

hey p
layed nothing but o

 khen,
 
x
ylophone, l
ong d
rum and a one s
tringed guitar called a sau, particularly
 
d

or American ears.  Being i

ehearsals f
or t

am
 
l

hey had become quite smooth on t
heir f
amiliar i
nstruments, which
 
c
ombined t
raditional and modern (
e.g. t
he k
eyboard f
or t
he khen).  But t
hey
 
were c
learly r
usty and l
acked confidence on t
he "
old s
tyle" i
nstruments.
 
While t
he band had moved t
o t
he Lao extreme i

hoice o
f i
nstruments, i
n
 
costuming t
hey went t
o t
he o

o wear
 
t
heir u
sual T
-shirts and j
eans o
r o
ther casual garb.  Nor d
id t
hey f
o
llow t
heir
 
musical d
irection and wear t
raditional Lao costumes (
possibly sarongs?).
 
I
nstead t
hey had gone out as a g
roup and bought i
dentical c
heap b
lack suits
 
w
ith vests and w
ide l
apels.  With t
hem t
hey wore white shirts and whatever
 
f
ootwear t
hey had on (mostly t
ennis s
hoes).  C
learly t
hey had i

I
 don't mean t
