TEXT: ( General restaurant noise and confusion -- people ordering 
raw oysters -- a boisterous, jovial group of older men, a couple 
of their wives, and Pat Pugh) 
Torn, 
the owner of the restaurant, 
is Yugoslavian. Motto 
Farac is the champion shrimp - peeler. " So this time what I do, 
they all start peeling, you see, they take their shrimp with the 
heads off, them fellas, and I take mine with the heads on. So 
they said, " Matt, they done started ' em," " That's alright," I 
Baia, " I'll start." So when I start, he beat me by one shrimp -
the guy on the other end. I didn't know he was fast. So I carne in 
second. My wife said, " What did you do that for?" 
This was at the Orange Festival. They had oyster shucking 
contest, " peeling the catfish," You could enter all of em if you 
want to, 
but like, breakin heads, I don't enter it, 
because I 
know I can't win. Breakin heads on shrimp -- headless. Now shrimps 
that you peel, 
I'll enter then, because other-wise, for several 
years back there was one man that used to beat,me all the time -
Dadal (?) and after he retired and quit, 
got old, I took over. So 
this last time here -- kinda show off a little bit, you know. So 
I'm pay i 
n for i 
t . 
I 1 
ost . 
I lost by one shrimp. And my son was 
there -- said " Come on, Daddy! He's got two shrimps and you've 
got three! Catch that one!" 
You know, when you don't worry whether You wi. , ­r
,
 lose, 
it 
don't hurt ; aca. 
But if I was really anxious to win, I wouldn't 
let nobody start ahead of me. 
You see, I had a cousin -- I had a 
fuss with my Cousin on that case. My brother never did fair at 
checkers in his life, and he played my brother at checkers, and 
he beat hire so bad it was pitiful. I said, " Now what did you do 
I 
1 
LFAAMHO14 
that? Are you happy?" He said, " No," he said, " I'll tell you what 
happened with me. " There was a guy used to play gin rummy all the 
time. Ail the time. I felt sorry for the poor guy so I let him 
beat me one time. He didn't play me no more after he beat' me, 
because -`
~'That's all I was playin' you, to beat you one time, 
Joe. And I used to pick up five or ten dollars every day from 
that man." 
Every day he used to pick up five or ten dollars, but 
he let this fella beat him one time, he didn't play him•no more. 
(general confusion) 
You can get a lot of information out of this guy. He travels 
to Yugoslavia. 
ZF: I worked for ten dollars for ten montt:, ' tien I carne 
to this country ( hi s last name means " our man gy
`' `__/` 
?: Well I worked ni ne years for nothing -- what you talking 
about? I worked for my father --
A lot of Yugoslavians when they first carne here they went 
into the fishing industry, but later they have doctors, 
lawyers 
the second generati on . Th e only thing I can tell you is this -- , 
as far as I can see it, 
that the 1930s when Depression was, 31 
and so on -- I been hear that over and over there was no 
Yugoslays didn't go to the WPA -- whatever it 
is, 
you know the 
fund they have -- because they was all working. They went to 
work. You're going to find --
Joking about the oysters corning from Chesapeake Bay. They 
eat there with horse radish and catsup, which they mix together 
themselves. Mato coaches Hufford in the preparation anc eating of 
one. 
Tommy, the proprietor, comes in. 
Motto: This is your king oyst ersh sicker, 
Tommy. Now he'll take 
an oyster and put it behind his back., 
and he'll say, " Here, 
it's 
open. ,I 
ZF: Would you believe one guy in New Orleans --
(discussion about capacities for oysters, how many they can eat 
at one sitting) 
?: You know what oysters will do to you, you know. Make you 
(laughter) 
Motto: They say if you eat the right oysters, you goin 
h 
unt i 
n. 
?: Tells a joke on the subject that is difficult to 
understand. 
ZF : Please don't give me too many, my heart can't stand 
it. 
You know what the doctor- told me? You can eat three oysters. 
Watch it. 
Matt: I take one every morning -- a gout pill. 
I eat so many 
things against the gout. 
Jack is 68. 
Motto: on the 16th of February I'll be 76. 
T was born 
here. MatC ( th e  o th er Mato was born here . 
Matt:  I was born here? I was 16 when I come here. 
1925. When 
I carne down here, didn't have no roads. 
You has tO ride on the / 
levee. 
Motto: You know what happened. The Slays that come from 
overseas, start talking- to em, 
the first thing they ask, they 
say, where was you born? 
I say, New Orleans. They say, " No - 
where?" '" 
a 
LFPAMHO14 
All the people whose mothers are Yuaoslav, all the kids 
speak it. 
You see, my father and mother, they carne from overseas, but 
the whale family, the whole five kids, ail speak Yugoslay. Just 
like Tommy'and his sister. They're born and raised in this 
country -- and th e y speak Yugoslay. 
It's dust one of those 
things. They all speak the mother's language. 
Have you picked up any French? 
Motto: Yeah, they got plenty of Frenchmen -- but very few -
I've picked up a few words here and there, 
but mostly the French 
is over in the west, 
in Terrebonne Parish, 
in Bayou LaFourche, 
and --
(general confusion) 
Motto: You see, 
I'm going to get you interested in the 
oysters. This oyster that you just ate, that was a female oyster. 
How do you know? 
Motto: Because they're fat. 
If you get a skinny oyster, that 
is a male oyster. That is right. 
A male changes to a female, a 
female changes back to a male. They don't have to mate or 
anything, 
it's right here in the book.. 
Probably on this page 
here. ( Has difficulty finding the page where it says they 
change sex.) When its so fat it has the sperm and it lets the 
sperm go out on the water, you see -- whatever it attaches to, 
3-r'on, 
a shoe, 
if the right mix of water is there, 
it stays. 
(the sperm is also called " milk. ") 
Once you read that book You know about the oysters. That is 
an oyster book. 
(Brings out the Vujnovich book) 
See, 
this is the Miss Joyce. ( p. 
127) That's our boat. 
That's the miss Joyce, they're leaded with sack horses on the 
conveyor, goin into this truck. Thi s is a Martinez (?) truck 
see they're goin up the con veyor and they're lo,adin the truck - 
with it. 
And that is our boat the Miss Joyce. Also 
you're going 
to see a King in this book. I am the King. 
His wife is sitting next to me. She is German -- she has 
not learned Yugoslavian, and their children only speak a few 
words. They dress in costume and do Y11goslavian dances every year 
at a festival in New Orleans. 
The food is all Plaquemines Parish Seafood. 
Matt: I tell you, to me, 
nobody fries oysters better than my 
wife. 
It Just tastes good. 
--- ( general talk) 
ZF(?) : Last summer I spent about a month in Yugoslavia, 
about 10 days in Greece, and 10 days in Italy. 
How do the King and Gueen get elected? 
Motto: At the Orange Fair and Festival they pick out a king 
and 
en every year, and all the past kings pick. out a new kin g . 
And the  queen, they have people to se lect a new queen Out of the 
new girls that come out -- 35 or 40 of ern. 
They walk the stage 
and all that. And then the first -,_inner up, 
second t 
ur.ner $I 
and 
third rune-- up. 
The last king we picked out, we picked out Basil 
..it 
at the 
others same time we wer e thi n ki n' of
 or four - 
. 
ZF: I started in the oyster business, but I moved into a 
3 
LFPAMHO14 
different field -- commercial -- I went in finance, went to 
shiploadin , (?) real estate and things like that, 
but the oyster 
business was the first major thing for me. That was the starting 
point. 
You see when you come down to Empire, 
if you look on the 
right hand side you see the Dock Side Loading and Shipping? That 
was mine, that was the one I first started at. Loading the ships, 
loading grain, 
loading coal, 
loading everything that goes out. 
Actually one year we loaded 10 million tons. 
Motto: You seen airlines -- Gulf -- SOCo (?) about twenty 
five miles above you? Look out to the r iver you 're gonna see a 
grain elevator -- there's where he started out there, on that 
business he's talkie to you about. 
ZF: That's one thing about Yugoslav people -- all the 
people from China, Japan, they're progress people. There's no 
question. They can come here to this country, and they're doing 
very well. 
The typi ca l Yugoslav in Louisiana, would you believe 
they 're living ( in the top fifteen percent I think he's saying) 
as far as income. 
You know why? Because they're hard working, 
and when they do work, they raise the money in the right way, and 
they do it very well. . . . They know how to handle their money 
when they make it. 
They invest in the right way, they're 
conservative. 
Do people do that in Yugoslavia? 
ZF: No, 
that's why we came here. 
Because if we Could get 
all those things over there we wouldn't come here -- why we carne 
over here, just like this little paper say over, here, 
in there 
they say " Why do I left?" You know what they say in Yugoslavia 
"Klock trabuck (?)" that means, " Stomach after the bread." In 
other words, you going where you can get food or a better, living. 
Motto: See, what he's tellinn you, 
I have a nightcl u b,
dancing hall, res tauran t 
In New Orleans? 
Motto: Right here In Rla auernines Flarisn 
(end •• f side one)

r. 
LFPAMHO 14 
Side two ( LFP - AMHO14) 
Motto: ( cant.) made money with the oysters, the hotel, the 
restaurant, all at the same time. 
ZF: Took care of the one thing, took care of the other 
thing, everything's goin at the same time -- I had a ? 
Enterprises Corporation and a ? Corporation goin at the same 
time, and a little  oyster business, which, I'M not in it, 
I' m 
just leasin' out -- ( offers further examples for someone else) 
How do you decide to come here? 
Motto: You have people over here. My daddy carne in this 
country when he was ten years old -- way back in 1853. 
Matt: My daddy carne in this country in 1884. 
Motto: 1884 
Matt: And I had grandpa on my mama's side that he drowned on 
a 1853 -stti r,e•; 5tev&­ , 
Wha 
was your fathers' name? 
(someone puts my question in Yugoslavian) 
Matt: Well, Fickovich (?) like mom, 
but she was Marinovich 
(?) 
before she married 
Why doesn't everybody come over? 
ZF: 
If one family have two or three sons and you not 
small land, so one or two sons they went somewhere else, and one 
stayed there to work on the land. 
What if no one wanted to move? 
ZF: Well, then they divide the land. Okay, now I'li give 
you this example of my ancestor when they came first here. 
Tnere 
was one -- the uncle of my grandfather. He came here when he was 
fourteen years of age. He was on a ship -- He carne to New Orleans 
-- and in 1840 he went to San Francisco with the Gold Rush -- and 
he lived to be 104 -- I didn't see him, 
but my uncle he saw him 
in Idaho. He had a claim. 
Let's say if my ancestors, or whoever, was here in this city, 
in this parish, or in this section, and he worked in Seafood --
he carne and he start work with him. My relation was in the 
restaurant business. 
(Basically you come and work with established people, Usually 
relatives, for little pay, 
but you gradually become independent.) 
There's no Yugoslavians over here out of work. Never. Nobody 
works for the big companies. 
Everybody works for their relations 
or their friends. 
Matt: Not only that, 
but you never find anybody from 
Yugoslavia on welfare 
Motto: You see, 
in this parish here, there was a man, they 
called him a dictator, Judge Perez. You heard of him, 
but, 
in my 
book, he's okay. But he'll tell you there ain't one Slovenian 
during Depression, and all that when they was goin to the NRA to 
survive, not one slay that ever went to get one dollar to 
survive. They all done their work and everything and went right 
on ahead. 
He said that in his own words. He didn't have to worry 
about the Slovonian people -- never had to worm about then, ati`: 
all. They took car- sf thamselves. 
He was district attorney of the parish, and judge too. 
Was he Spanish? 
Motto: Well, he had a Spanish name, I guess he was descent of 
Spanish. But he is -- was a very smart Man and he was very good 
5 
LFPAMHO14 
friend of Yugoslays. 
In fact the Yugoslays are the one that 
helped him to get in office. Fifty years ago, sixty years ago.' 
And he stood in the office forty some odd years. 
Matt: You're right, Mat•,7because when I came in the co.pntry 
he was a judge, and that's sixty years ago. 
Motto: So, 
in other words, he was a brilliant man. He fought 
the Federal government and everything else when it came to this 
integration and all that. He was for the people of Plaquemines 
Parish. 
What about Edwards? 
Motto: Edwards, that's a scheme there. He went free, 
but 
ain't nobody steals that much money and gets by free -- well, he 
did. 
That Jury was bought and everything else. Or maybe he's 
innocent, I don't know. 
?:The Jurors was 11 to 1 -- and the one that wasn't was a 
lady that was cucoo. 
ZF: But anyone that makes 10 million dollars and doesn't 
work at it -- you got to work for something to get paid 
Motto: Yeah, but don't forget, that's the lawyers. The lawyers 
make money. 
(more discussion on this score) 
ZF: I met Edwards, I was at lunch with Edwards -- he was 
a nice guy, as nice as anyone else. 
Motto; Well, 
I'm gonna tell you right now -- I looked at the 
news night, and I looked at the news this morning. 
If that 
gees through what he's got in mind, bringing gamblin back in the 
states, 
I rA for i 
t , 
one hundred  percent. 
ZF: Oh, 
I'm for that too. 
Motto: I told ray wife when we went to Las Vegas night 
and I said, " You see, honey, you see how everybody likes to . 
gamble and all that? Now why they wanna keep that away from us, 
send us to Las Vegas, 
Reno or whatever?" 
We went on the dice 
table, we didn't get Off of it -- we stood at the dice table for 
five hours -- me her, my son and daughter-in-law, my daughter, 
and everything else, shootin and rollin them dice. 
Arid I mean, 
rol 1 
in ' em now, money. I had $200 worth of chips, she had $ 200 
worth of chips, well, between th e fam il y we had over a thousand 
dollars worth of chips. We lost all that and bought more chips. 
(more) ... We had a good time. 
Who is the president of Yugoslavia? 
ZF: Before you can learn his name there's a different guy 
in there. 
Matt: Every year there's a different guy. 
ZF: In other words, there's six 
republics -- Slovonia, 
Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, 
(they come from the Dalmatian coast of Croatia) 
ZF: And there's tado that are smaller - - they're not equal 
to the others ( Bosnia and Hercegovina) 
Matt: And they don't understand each other's language. 
ZF: Slovansi -- Maced on ia is pretty hard to i.tnLHerstand, but 
the 
let's say 20 million, speak. ,. very well. See, 
northeast and South, near the Greece border 
(it gets noisy here) 
you can get in and out whenever you want. 
In America you have 
to have a visa to get in, 
but in many countries you can come and 
LFPAMHO14 
go without one. 
forty four million tourists crossed the border 
into Yugoslavia last summer. 
See, we're on the Adriatic coast, so when we come here, we 
came by the water. Now the Igranians (?) that went to the north 
of the United States 
Matt: The slay people aren't only here in New Orleans and 
Plaquemines and Canada, Memphis Tennessee and Philade&phia, 
they're scattered all over. Canada, they're loaded Wera. 
Zeldko tells about going to Yellowstone Natiolal Park and how 
he and his wife were speaking Yugoslavian in a little restaurant 
and a lady came over and started speaking with them. They were so 
surprised, " up there in the middle of nowhere." 
And then the 
next morning the lady who served them breakfast was Yugoslay. 
"Remarkable!" 
They got 300 thousand in Los Angeles. 
Do Yugoslays harvest oysters anywhere else in the country? 
ZF: No -- I think they got some in Texas. Most of them 
are here. But the fishing business is all over. 
Motto: That's one thing about the Yugoslays. They don't beg 
nobody for nothing. 
ZF: They work here two, three years, and they buy their 
own boat and go into business. 
In the early days a boat was a couple thousand dollars, now 
it's a couple of hundred thousand. 
The same identical beat! Like when you built your boat 
and I built mine and ever-ything for- 25, 
000, today it would cost 
you two hundr e d th ousand or 25 0 thousand. 
Labor that was 5 or 6 dollars a day, 
is now 100, 
150 
dollars. 
(general confusion) 
Motto: Young lady, 
back when I was 18 years old I was working 
with a carpenter -- 6 dollars a week. And there's plenty of era 
worked for cheaper than that -- and out of that 6 1 used to give 
ray fare i 
1 
y 5, 
and keep one dollar for me. 
ZF: And how many hours did you work? 
Matt: Sun - UP to Sundown. I worked in the bayou for oysters. 
30 dollars a month. 
In the morning at two o'clock they say, " Get 
up! Make coffee. Gut the soup on." I Put all that or, the stove. 
By that time they said, we no ahead and we put the stove Out and 
everything and we goy in the bay and rake. But it wasn't even good 
and we qo back in the camp and he says, " Okay you start cullir, 
Your oysters -- and he goes in the carap and cooks -- the boss, 
and I'm only a young boy of 19 years old, cullin oysters, a 
dollar a day. And right now frora that dollar a day they, there 
ain't nobody works for less than 100 dollars a day. 
I'm gonna give you an example. I have boats. 
s. 
I have captains 
on there. I split with ray boats, 50 - 50. 
I share with the 
captains everything."He takes half, I take half. 
I have men 
workin the boats at a dollar and a half a sack. That's the way 
they wanna work, they don't wanna work by the month. 
(a sack holds about 15 - 18 dozen oysters) 
And I have some 
men, they Var4na work by 
day - a hundred dollars a day, 
y, 
so I 
have to pay ' era a hundred dollars a day. 
And I feed ' era and 
everything.> I got a man out there now, 
he went Out there, up to 
yesterday he had 400 sac ks made, so that's 4,800 dolla)Is, he 
might make say another hundred -- that's 6,000 bucks, and he 
7 
LFPAMHO14 
been out there --
Who works on your boats? Yugoslavians? 
Matto: No, anybody. Colored, white, 
it don't make any 
difference. Americans. A Yugoslav hardly works for a Yugoslay. 
They're their own boss. They work for you a couple years and then 
they buy their own boats. How many people works on a boat? 
Anywhere from two to three of ern. 
You see, where the Yugoslav 
makes their mistakes, I got em from overseas, I learnt ern, 
they 
work a couple a years and then first thing they quit me. So what 
did I do? I brought those men to work against me. Competition. 
And still and all, they come to us for help, we turn right around 
and give ern a hand. A helpin hand. 
ZF: You was with me in Baton Rouge, you and I, 
we went to 
Baton Rouge, we left five men ( hand to understand -- he's a very 
fast speaker) 
How do you get the women over here? 
Matt: they married the girls here, they bring their wives 
from over there. 
Zeljko tells a story about when he went to Mat's wedding in 
i 
Empire. A great delivery. 
Motto:\You take Leander Perez, what he used to say about 
the Slays, he said, " That's my people. " That' s how much he 
thought of the slays. 4/  
The Slays were not competing with anybody over Oysters. 
It 
was a relatively unexploited resource then, according to Motto. 
"Hardly anybody cared about it.
,, 
1876
 Discussion of the Oyste rman 's assoc iations. One started in 
-- 
Does  anyone sing epics? 
ZF: He's a good singer right here ( they name a whole 
group Of good singers) 
Zeljko plays the banjo -- he has played with tarnburitza 
groups. 
The Plaquemines Oyster association is mostly all Yugoslav, 
with " some Americans."

TX01: Discussion of singers ( get someone wno understands the 
language to transcribe their names) 
What kind of songs do they sing? 
ZF: Love songs 
Matt: Any kind of songs. 
Motto: there's a beautiful song in Yugoslavian " Mariana" 
ZF: But I'll tell you -- Yugoslays, Serbs, a lot of them 
do a Mexican type of singing, 
but now it's these new songs --
everybody wants to sing rock ' n' 
roll ---
Motto: I can' t go for that. 
ZF tells about a woman he heard singing last summer --
Motto: We was in Yugoslavia, me and him, we throwed a party 
one night at his hometown over there, we had the time of our 
life. 
ZF: I laughed so much. There was guys from New Zealand 
and America there. 
Motto: And BeatOice was spillin her beer back there and she 
blamed this old man, said " Gigolo, 
look on the floor," she said. 
(laughing) 
ZF: We have some nice times now too. 
Do you cove here for lunch every clay? 
ZF: no, 
I live in New Orleans. 
(more reminiscences about how tough it was in the early 
days) Investment priorities: first a boat, then a house, there a 
car. 
I 
LFPAMHO15 
ZF: I started playing music when I was eight years, 
until I was eighteen --- tamburitza music. Duke University has 
the same thing. I haven't played since I came to this country. 
They don't have tamburitza down here, but in the Northern 
part of---the United States, 
in every city up in the north. 
Old man Steve and I used to play. 
I used to go out hunting 
-- went to Canada and down to Nicaragua, for doves, geese, ducks. 
Fifteen of them -- they went fishing -- flew to Winnepeg, a bush 
pilot took them the rest of the way. They were close to the North 
Pole. 
Are your houses like they were in Yugoslavia? 
No -- they're built of stone over there. 
The interiors here have a lot of marble -- reminiscent of 
Yugoslavia. Marble is not that expensive in Yugoslavia, and they 
use wire to cut it " Just like you're cutting cheese," said ZF. 
"It's beautiful. " 
Motto: It's amazing to know, just like he mentioned there, 
Orebich (?) and Korcula we all know what he's talking about. 
In 
other words, Orebich is the end of the Peninsula of Peljesac 
then Korcula comes -- which, Korcula is Europe -- that's an 
island right across. They got a ferry boat to take YOU across --
about a mile. So when he mentions that, we know what he's taikin 
about, and there's so many islands, You see. 
And I learned ouite 
a few of those islands while I was over there. 
I even learned the 
island named Shibaneck (?) w here they gamble out thereon the 
water. 
ZF: You can go free -- the gambling is legal, only thing 
is, ,lust bring American money. 
Matt: But it's a beautiful Country. Yugoslavia's not 
communist exactly, but it's how you say that 
ZF: Socialist. 
Description of the system 
the beaches there are crowded 
Dubrovnik is the seventh wonder of the world. There's still 
an unbroken wall around it. " The old and the new," said Matt. 
Matt: It 
is beautiful -- have you walked uo on that wall ? 
And there's a place that says, " Anything you want to bury 
American, 
it's here." So I stopped there -- it's pots, 
pans, 
anything yo*u 
want. 
ZF: And there's plays -- and the play is riot so-mething 
inside,

What are the most significant places in Plaquemines? 
Matt: Well, Fart Jackson with the walls, like Dubrovnik 
What are the historical sites for Yugoslavians? 
ZF: It's a shame they didn't build something of their 
own. 
Matt: I'm gonna tell you somethin right now about 
Plaquemines Parish. Right now while we're sittin here. Alright. 
This is Slay. That's Slay. 
It's 50-50 Slav in the next house. I 
would say that Empire is about 60 percent Slovonian people or 
maybe better. 
ZF: Before there was more than that, 
in the beginning. 
Course now they got people mixed up. There's plenty that don't 
have a " ch" in their names. 
Matt: Oh, yeah -- I'd say there's 80 percent Slav -right now. 
(We're looking at a picture of the Dubrovnik wall.) 
Matt repeats a story someone told about haw Yugoslavia ought 
to just give the Pelassius Peninsula to America and maybe that 
would free the rest of the country. 
Matt:', I'll tell you somethin Miss. Wherever a Slav sets his 
fact, he ain't gettin outa there without money. They know how to 
make it, 
they know how to save it. 
Arid they're no bother to 
nobody. 
And I'd say 99 percent of ern are that way. /'

ZF: First the guy gets his oysters and he puts them in 
bushels, then the dealer comes and buys it right off the 'boat. 
Matt: They go to Washington directly. 
ZF's brother has 40 or 50 Vietnamese shucking oysters for 
him, 
blacks and all that. So the structure is the owner ( usually 
Yugoslavian) then a captain, then workers. 
Matt gives a good description of it. 
They don't care what 
the middle man charges, as long as they get what they need. 
Discussion of impact of inflation and differences in prices. 
Gasoline for 17 cents in 1970.

ZF taped her and played it back, 
to her utter astonishment) 
That was in ' 6c -- and he played the tape back recently and some 
of the people had died) 
Do people sing any songs about oystering? 
ZF: Only way they sing is when they get a gallo n of wine (

in there, 
then they'll all sing. 
Matto: I don't believe there's any songs about oysters. 
There's a sang like Jumba l

They mention the carpenter, the

what she would like =- what profession, then you start can the
