developed and the mcr  pe fec ed tLeir art forms will be.
 There is folk jr -
,
 
that is rudimentary and not terribly elegant -
-
 yet.
 It should be given time,
 
like a couple of centuries (
which is how long many of our now popular and
 
accepted art forms have required).
 Not all art forms have reached the same
 
stage  of growth, elegance, or decay.
 
Basically, folk arts are local;  they are learned at home.
 They are
 
assured of continuance in that they are part of growing up within this or that
 
community.
 Everybody learns them, and then you either take that particular
 
cultural ball and run with it and become a folk artist, or you simply use it
 
as part c
i your basic i
dentity.
 
As a little Anglo girl growing up in Texas,  I learned embroidery.
 I
 
didn't h,7e much of a choice.
 I learned embroidery, not backetry -
-
 I didn't
 
even learn the beginnings of basketry, as I imagine neighbor Native American
 
sin s might have.
 I learned the raw skills of embroidery, but I wouldn't have
 
considered myself an embroidery artist.
 Some of my friends probably grew up
 
to be fine embroiderors and some didn't, just as I expect some of my Native
 
American neighbors grow up to be great basket weavers and cone ethers didn't.
 
The folk artists are the ones who seize that art form and go with it and develcp
 
it,  like any other a
'tist.
 
c give every child a rudimentary educatio  in Unitinc, hut we don't expect
 
every child to become Shakespeare.  And every child also learns a little bit
 
of the going art forms in his particular culture, but they may or may not be
 
particularly good at it.
 Sti ll the aesthetic is sort of absorbed, sort of
 
hu11t in so that you don't really know quite how you remembered how to do it;
 
i
t's just always been t
here.
 
Now why do we have to t
ake these art forms and lay government money on
 
t
1i Cn?

u
ions  that are very  oer u1;  mas communications -
-
 t
.v., radio, priiL
 
These -
ire extraordinary institutions, but they depend upon centralization -
-
 and
 
folk arts are local.
 Publishing, for example, is a big industry and must be
 
centralized in order to reduce costs.
 So it is with all communications forms,
 
and what we see is that all communication is going out to the rest of the world
 
from the big centers -
-
 but none (
or very little) comes back.
 
The impact of mass communication on folk arts is tremendous, because folk
 
arts are fragile, very fragile.
 For example, I had a movie maker tell me that
 
in Alaska there is a small Eskimo village way out in nowhere that recently
 
entered t
he television era.
 They brought in TVs by dogsled; everyone was
 
t
errifically excited.
 But what happened was that for the first time in, who
 
knows how long, for t
he first time EVER there was no dancing in the village
 
that weekend, and there never has been since.
 The people are all home watching
 
I SPY or some other junk on TV.
 They are all sitting around the TV and watching
 
because they think that is what will make them human, make them real.
 The
 
peonle believe t
hat what is on TV is real, and therefore it becomes their reality.
 
Thev don't count unless they can see themselves;  I am on TV, therefore I am.
 
Some arts administrators ask me, well, do you want to deprive Eskimos from
 
television?  Do you want to prevent them from entering the modern age?  My
 
answer i
s ro.  We (
us arts administrators and us educators) aren't that powerful;
 
we can't prevent anything.  What we can maybe do is offer a little bit of a choice.
 
It won't work really, but maybe we can make the inevitable just a little less
 
brutal.  We can work to have broadcast, for example, a film that shows a seal or
 
a walrus hunt in really exciting terms; we can say that the culture that can
 
prod ce such hunters is a strong and exciting human development, we can dignify
 
people in t
heir ultimate  defeat.
 As it is otherwise,  they are not only being
 
wiped out of existence,  they are not even being mourned by their own descendants.

 who will, like our fri nJs  ha Eskrnos :
i
n
 
anether 70 or 80 years, mourn, and mourn for the rest of their lives, for what
 
they have given up, for what they gave away, for what they have lost.
 They
 
.ill never be able to recover it, really.
 It will he gone.
 
The Folk Arts Program tries to point out, over and over again,  that people
 
can and must keep at least their art forms alive.
 In their movement into a new
 
and strange world, they may have to give up much of their life—ways, but they
 
can keep up their traditional arts, and they can take them into the strange
 
new life.
 They don't have to give their arts up.
 They don't have to throw
 
them away.
 
nd, on top of thnt,  the Folk Arts Program exists to say that the United
 
States Government wants to help.  We believe that the folk art forms are good
 
and we will offer funds, grants, little incentives t
o help keep things keep
 
on going.
 We are putting money where our mouth is.
 
Here in Hawaii, you have such a marvelous potential for developing a folk
 
arts prograir infinitely better than one that could stem solely from the federal
 
program.
 Folk arts are local and should be nurtured locally.
 Let the federal
 
people comi out and give a pep talk or offer some extra funds or technical
 
assistance.
 But you m
'st protect your own arts for yourselves.
 You should
 
nave your own folk arts program.
 Folk arts are beautiful.
 They can be
 
exceptional.
 They are high quality arts.
