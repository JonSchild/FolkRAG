INTERVIEWER: Now, tell me about his activities in the old Handy Chapel there.
INFORMANT: Well, later in life <gap> took care of the church. He was the secretary, he
was the only, I guess, living member here after <gap> died, who took care of it.
INT: And of course that was your step-sister's mother, right?

being, really being in bad repair and they did lots, lots of work remodelling.
INT: Well, did he ever preach in the church?

INT: (unintelligible) Okay, that's what I've been confused about. Now, but your father was a
good maintenance man and giving the (unintelligible).
INF: Right. Right. (unintelligible) He went around and raised money to keep, remodel the
church and things like that.
INT: Do you have a pretty good size congregation there?
C 18 page 2
INF: No. No, it's almost discontinued.
INT: You know, we've talked many times about it, we feel it's the oldest church, and we
hope we've been (unintelligible) at preserving the building's history. I imagine that you've
had a lot of happy activities happen around there.
INF: Yes.
INT: Particularly in the early days.
INF: Yes.

INF: They, when I was a child, they rented the church out. They didn't have a minister here
at that time. They rented out to different denominations. And then different ministers would
come in. They would have church time-to-time. (unintelligible) by the people here at that
time. They were such few in number, but there was never a large amount. Then my uncle
<gap> he took over the church. And he had a real large church when they for, a number of
years.
INT: Do you have a minister there now?
INF: No. Well, yes. Not a minister, sort of a missionary.
INT: That comes ...
INF: No.
INT: She lives there?
INF: Mmm-hmm.

INT: Connects to it.
INF: Right. Then we have two other individual buildings that they rented-out to the poor or
to the black. Because years ago it was almost impossible for a black person to get into a
motel or a hotel.
INT: I see. So you had to sort of provide the quarters for these
INF: Right, right. So anyone that came through here, you know, that was down on their
luck, or didn't have, or a widow woman or something, they would rent or let them use these
places, so until you know, they had some job or moved-on, whatever.
SECOND INFORMANT (INF 2): (unintelligible) until they had money to go to school or ...
INF: Right. That's what they would use the money for at that time.
INF 2: (unintelligible) or if they wanted to go to college. (unintelligible).
INT: Right. Your funds were used for many things. To help people. And as you told me
earlier, you all were really very close-knit and all worked toghether
INF: Right.
INT: Of course your numbers were small, and of course you had a caring heart or you
wouldn't have done it anyway.

INT: And I wanted to ask you about some, you probably had special programs, and, did
you have a piano in the church?
INF: Yes! We had a piano and a (unintelligible) and bought an organ.
INT: And looking at that little record book that you found in the
C 18 page 4
church. They had a Sunday school, and I wondered if you read a lot of things.
INF: Yes.
INT: That always was a big part of your service?
INF: Right. (unintelligible)
INT: Do you happen to have any of the hymnals that were used?
INF: Yes, I have quite a few, but ...

INF: No, I'm afraid we do not have any of the original ones. A few years back. Was quite
a few years, it was quite a few years back, the different churches here, I do believe,
organized a library there. and a lot of the books, especially the hymn books and things
like that, were discarded because they were of no value at that time, you know. So we lost
quite a few things, which means for the (unintelligible) that the church (unintelligible) were
given to us. Which we thought was quite an honor at that time.
INT: Well, many times things of history are destroyed, and then we look back and we wish
we still had them, but ...
INF: Right, right.
INT: That's true of all of us. Do you still have a library that ...
INF: Yes, we still have quite a few of the books. The last time I was in the church, I looked-
up, yes. But that was the library of the church for a long time.
INT: So it's probably grown, like once it was started I guess people contributed books to it.
Of your own people.
INF: Probably so. I don't know what conditions are right now.
INT: You haven't been for a visit in awhile. Well, in your growing-

up and going to school, did you participate in a lot of the musical programs at school? Did
you like to sing?
INF: No, I can't sing. I'm like my father. I love to sing. (laughs).
INT: Well, you seem to be able to recite poetry.
INF: Yes, I've always loved poetry. Yes, I love poetry, but I have, we, I don't remember
having too many plays at school. At school too much.
INT: When you got your, you got together for your, oh, special occasions. What are
some of the happy times you remember when your families got together, and how you
celebrated?
INF: We always sang when my (unintelligible) and my aunt would come, and my uncle
was here, and we always got around the piano and sang. Or if we didn't have a piano, they
sang and would (unintelligible).
INT: They probably knew a lot of, did they sing a lot of hymns?

INT: Do you have any of them here?
INF: No, I don't, because ...
INT: It seems they would be mostly sung from the heart anyway, I suppose.
INF: Right.
INT: For most of them knew the words. Did they then teach them to their children?
INF: My father was the only one that had children. My aunt had an adopted daughter. And
of course my uncle had an adopted daughter. But my father was the only one that had
children. But they sang both

beautiful. But my aunties all were school teachers, and they majored, two of them majored
in music. So it was sort of, well, you kind of forgot yourself in all this beautiful music that
they could produce. My uncle, he liked to play the clarinet a little bit, and he loved to sing
and move with it. He wasn't the best singer, but he was the loudest. (laughs).
INT: He just groaned.

INF: Right. My father enjoyed it so much. He just, was just the main. We just knew that
was going to come up. We all, and the neighbors would come over and just to listen to
him.
INT: Oh, I can imagine. Don't you wish you had a tape-recording of that!
INF: Oh boy! <gap> did quite a bit of taping. He really did. But I don't know whether it's all
erased or ...
INT: You know where his tapes might be?
INF: No. See when, you know, after he passed and then my aunt passed several years
later, then they came and just cleaned everything out of the house.
INT: I see.
INF: I don't know whether they kept any of that or, I don't think he (unintelligible) or
anything in it, you know. They just abandoned the house, just took everything and put it
out.
INT: Well, I expect that your mother and your family all had some pretty family
celebrations, had some special recipes, special dishes which you had made that were
particularly delicious.
INF: Well, let's see. My auntie was (unintelligible) her Spanish rice

good at (unintelligible).

INT: Everybody'd go where?
INF 2: (inaudible) About two or three o'clock in the morning and you'd have it all ready, a
big pot of hash. And everybody's getting to eat -- we'd go home and get some food about
five or six o'clock in the morning. About every Christmas we'd do that!
INT: That sounds fun! And it was delicious, eh?

INF 2: I came here in May in '37.
INT: May of '37. What actually brought you to Grand Junction?
INF 2: I was looking for a job. It was during the Depression, it was really tough times then.
So I was just going across the country trying to find some work.
INT: That era of our history was pretty rough for everybody.
INF 2: Oh it was, it was.
INT: And, you evidently were very fortunate in finding a job fairly soon, and that was with
the railroad.

can usually get a job. And then you met <gap>

INT: Yes. And even though you could get a job in those, Depression or tail-end of the
Depression years, it wasn't always as easy to keep something such as (unintelligible)
where they kept cutting back.
INF 2: Yes, that's right. I'd seen them come down there and cut half of them, you know
(inaudible).
INT: I wonder how they were taking care of people here at that time. Was there, that
couldn't get jobs, do you know what was provided for them? Of course you didn't need,
you don't know because you got a job right away.
INF 2: Well, I don't know when did they end that WPA. You know that's work relief aid. I
don't know how long it lasted. It must have lasted up to the middle, up to about war time.
Then you had your CC camps.
