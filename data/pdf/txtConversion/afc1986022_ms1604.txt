when you were sick or did you go to the doctor every time you got sick. Do you know any
old remedies?
I. Back then, a dollar was a dollar, And the only time you went to the doctor is if, when
you went to the doctor you was sick, you didn't go to the doctor for just a headache like
now, Lotta people now if they've got just a little headache they ready to go to the doctor.
Well back then, if, well, let's say you had a little headache or somethin, or mabe a bone a-
hurtin, or your leg a-hurtin', mother would get up some kind of like sasafrac tea.

I. Any Whiskey? Yeah well, moonshine, that was about all th <gap> But you know back
then you could take ginger, put a little bit of ginger in it, and let's say if you took the flu
in the fall of the year and say got pneumonia or somethin like that instead of goin to the
doctor you could take a say half a glass of that and put ginger in it and take hit and go to
bed and it'd sweat it right out of you.
FW. Did it make you high?
I. Make you a little bit high, sometimes you'd get a little <gap> high, I mean, lotsa times

FW. Did the women do that too? for the toothache?
I. Oh yeah, you could take it and hold it in your mouth for a while or you could take
whiskey and hold it on the tooth, Just get your mouth full o just raw whiskey and hold it in
your mouth a-while and that was good. And if the tooth was loose, if you had a loose tooth,
you'd just tie a string around it, you know, instead o goin' to the dentist and tie it to the door
knob and then slam the door to, And that always tookk care of it.
FW. Did you ever have any teeth pulled this way? Did it hurt
I. Oh, just about all of them when I was a kid. Oh it might hurt a little bit for a second or two
but it was over with, You just get you a good stout string, tie it around the tooth real good
and let your brother or sister slam the door see. And that took care o that.

always fall on ya that's the old time sayin' that the mumps would fall, and ah the measles
then let's see they lasted, I believe, six weeks or somethin' like that, I'd say.

30-16
FW. Ok. You spoke of the moonshine did the, how did you get your moonshine whiskey?
I. Well, they was always somebody around within a few mile that knowed the remedy
on makin' it. Well, when they made it you could always get it, they, If you didn't have the
money to get it, if ah, you'd always probably know the guy and he'd always give you what
you needed.
FW. Were you afraid ever to drink any of it?
I. No, unh uhn.
FW. Fraid it'd kill ya?
I. No, it was, you'd always, they'd always make it out of the stuff that they should make it
out of, corn and all that.
FW. Do you know, did you ever see anyone make any moonshine?
Library of Congress
Conversation with 50 year old white male, West Virginia (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1604
I: Well, you take corn and mash, like ah, well it's a, the mash is more of a corn-like, And
you let it sour and then when it's, comes to a sour then you got your, what they call a worm
and it's a like a coil and ah then this here whiskey, to make the whiskey, you get this fire
hot and when this is comin' through the coil then it drops off, it makes steam, and when it
drops off, as it drops off that's your whiskey.
FW. And that's all there is to makin! moonshine?
I. That's it.........well see it takes, uh... it takes six weeks or two months to make a run, See,
you have to let your mash, hit has to get pickle-like, well it wouldbe called more of a pickle
I guess. And then after hit gets ready, the mash gets ready, then you got to build your fire,
you got your worm ready, you got to put yeast in it to make it work. And you can drop your
yeast in it and that starts that mash to work, and that gets it up in ta (a-) workin' and then
when you put the heat to it, and then it goes through the worm, what they
30-17
I. call the worm and when it does that, that makes your whiskey.
FW. And you, it jst has to drip out? And that's slow?
I. Yeah, yeah and you got to have sugar to see to put with it...
FW. Do you put that with it after it drips out?
Library of Congress
Conversation with 50 year old white male, West Virginia (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1604
I. No you put all that in your mash and as it comes out then, and ah if somebody that has
made a lota whiskey and knows exatly what to do to it, they know what, they would call
good whiskey.
FW. OK. Did you ever get any bad whiskey?
I. No, well I never did, we never did, just used it for medicine and that way, and I drank
some, not too much, just a little bit, you know, when I was younger, but I don't know as any
that we ever got. We might have got a hold of some that didn't taste as good as the other.
FW. Doesn't it burn a whole lot?
I. Well, it burns pretty, pretty much but if you get used to it, I mean people just I don't know,
I can't understand now though why the people would want to drink it myself, because I
can't see no good in it. Of course if you would use the whiskey as a medicine I would say, I
don't see no wrong in it. If you would really do it But they's so many people that won't do it.
They want to drink it. They think they get a big kick out of it, but really there's no kick out of
it. Ah, eh a lota people drink it and say they'll drink their troubles away. But just as soon as
you wake up the next morning, your troubles is there plus a big headache too. So you've
not gained anything.
FW. That's right. OK. Did ah, when your mother had her babies were they born at home or
the hospital? Do you remember any of this?

I. they call the country doctors and they was always on the call ready to come, You could
get em word and they would come to the house. They was always ready, NOw, you can't
get a doctor to come to the house now. They don't know if you, a house call that would be
the biggest sin a doctor ever done, he thought. But back then, women very seldom ever
went to the hospital to have a baby, you never hearda that, nothin' but well to do people.
And ah,...all of my sisters and brothers we was all born at home.

last check-up and so when we got there at the last checkup, he told me, he said now you
take her back home and put her in the bed because, says you('ll) be callin'
30-19
I. tonight before and says you'll be callin' me tonight before, before mornin; Said, in other
words, said you'll be callin' me and says ah get her home and let her get all the rest she
can get, So I go and I get my mother in law to come to help me, because I knowed that I
would have a big time, I mean, by myself. So there my mother-in-law comes and so sure
enough I had to carry her from the road, we lived 'bout 500 foot or a thousand foot off the
road and I had the awfulest time in the world, carryin' her down on the hill, he done give
her some medicne that put her to sleep. And So there I am draggin; tryin' to carry her
down on the hill, And so I got her home and about oh two o'clock in the morning, here I go
get the doctor, so then when the doctor got there, we got everything ready, We didn't have
no bathroom. All we had was just the water outside the house. We got the washpans and,
we got everything ready. So after a while, about a hour, the baby was born. An' so the
doctor retch us, retch me the baby, I tuck took him tuck tucked Bill in and laid him down on
the .....
FW. Right after he was born? First thing?
I. Oh yeah. it waspretty rough. And ah the doctor, when he retch him to us though, he had
to, back in them days, the women now don't know what a recievin' blanket is, I'm sure.
These young girls don't know what it is. But back then you had what they call a receivin'
blanket. When the baby was first born, the doctor put him in that blanket and then you tuck
him and then the doctor, of course, he was with Evelyn, and when he ah, when the baby
was born, then he took him and spanked him on the butt, retch him to me....

Conversation with 50 year old white male, West Virginia (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1604
FW. Did he have him in the blanket when you got him?
I. Oh yeah. But he'd done spanked him and him a-squawlerin' ya know.....
30-20
FW. Had he cleaned him up?
I. Cleaned him up? yeah. I cleaned him up, me and my mother-in-law, ohoh it was, Hit
looked pretty rough then, anyway I said Lawd Lawd what is this? And ah, so we tuck him
in on the table, we had, just had a small house then. We took him in laid him down on the
table and had the hot water ready, the baby soap, we got the rags my mother-in-law she
already knowed the ropes on how to go about it. So We washed him, wiped him off real
good, Well an after, we got him cleaned off really good, he, the skin was real white you
know and him a-crying, an' we thought it was the only thing in the world and we was really
happy. Well but then I checked it. I was checkin' on Evelyn every few minutes to see if she
was all right. So in two hours, the doctor was gone, the baby was delivered, the doctor was
gone.
FW. Did you watch the delivery, did you see any of that? Watch him <unintelligible text>
born?
I. Yeah, why Sure I held her hand. (FW."You did?") I held her arm. Well...
FW. It must have been an awful experience for you? wasn't it?
Library of Congress
Conversation with 50 year old white male, West Virginia (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1604
I. Well, they was nobody there but the doctor and me and my mother-in-lawy. And ah I
wanted to be there. I wanted to be with her. And so when the baby was bein borned, the
doctor told me I'd have to hold her, so I had to hold her, and ah.
FW. Did it scare you?
I. No, well, when it's time, it's just a matter of minutes, the baby's born. Because that's just
like anything else, when it's time, it's time. It's goin to be delivered one way or another. And
so the doctor was right there to see that the baby wadn't backward or somethin like that. If
the baby is comin' backward, see, they got to take it through the side, did you know that?
FW. No.
30-21
I. Ya see if the baby don't come right the right way, if the doctor, say, that the baby is
turned, the doctor, that's the reason you have to have a side operation, to take it out your
side. Now if he can get to it in time sometimes the doctor can turn the baby. But if he
can't, if the baby is comin' butt first, is that all rightto say? If hit's comin' that way, see, if it's
comin' out that way you can't have it.
FW. Did she have any trouble? like that, she had normal delivery.
I. Normal birth. Well ean', because see say if it would be doubled up and a-comin' butt first,
they's no way you could have it. It's got to come out head first.
Library of Congress
Conversation with 50 year old white male, West Virginia (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1604
FW. Yeah, somethin' could be wrond with it...
I. And they's so many times, And then, that's one good thing about the hospitals now,
about babies being born in the hospital. If somethin' like that does occur, they're ready
and got the stuff to operate right then and save the baby. Back in them days, of course,
if it would be such a thing as that, a lota times, ah, it would either maybe kill the mother,
sometimes it would kill her and the doctors didn't have the tools to operate there in the
house. Most of the old doctors like that they just didn't have the stuff like they have in the
hospital. Well ah, it woulda mabe killed the mother before you could get her to the hospital.
FW. And a lot of babies died too didn't they?
I. A lota the babies died, yeah. they was lots of 'em died. Like there either mabe the baby
would get hurt, say, that was called, back in them days, maybe a lotta the babies their
head or maybe a eye or somethin', That was caused from that maybe.
FW. Then, she had the second baby in the hospital, right?
I. Oh yeah.
FW. Do you think that's best?
