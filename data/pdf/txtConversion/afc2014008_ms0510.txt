Dear Bess-

April 8,  1980
 
It's been a terribly long time since I sat down to drop you a note and so
 
I have proclaimed today "Gotta write Bess Day" and in light of that am pro-
ceeding with the major part of the day's festivities- a letter. Following
 
the "writing of the letter" will be the colorful "finding of the envelope
 
in the damn sationery cabinet" ritual. Once that is completed, the "what
 
the hell happened to pages C through CH of my address book" ceremony will
 
be celebrated and then on to the holy stamping of the envelope and the
 
carrying of the correspondence promenade. The activities will be ended with
 
the "Dropping of the Envelope into the 'OUT OF TOWN'  Slot at the Post Office"
 
processional. Ah-life's a holiday.
 
In spite of numerous warnings from family,  freinds and collegues con-
cerning the weather here in Montana (
"you'll freeze yer cajones!!!!)  I have
 
lived through my first winter here and I must say, thoroughly enjoyed it.
 
I guess I
've always been a cold weather person so I have thrived up here.
 
I
've taken up cross-country skiing which I find to be a great way to learn
 
to cope with arse-deep snow.  It's funny, though. Most of this winter has not
 
been unGodly cold (
only about two weeks with temperatures at or below zero)
 
yet when the thermometer climbs up around 38 or 39 degress,  I find myself
 
trapsing around in my shirtsleeves.  Summer!  I guess I have thoroughly shamed
 
my Southern California-Beach Boy-Hang Ten Drinkin' Margaritas on the Beach-
It Never Rains  (
except in February and March)-Who ever heard of Snow Tires?
 
geographic heritage.  It's still West and I have come to find that I do love
 
the West.
 
Being here has also served to rekindle-actually to dowse with gasoline-
my almost obcessive love for hunting, fishing and backpacking. Last fall,  I
 
spent many cold, wet, shivering hours in duck blinds at dawn and loved every
 
minute of it.  It has been quite a while since I tasted elk and had forgotten that
 
it often tastes better than beef. And it had been a couple of seasons since I
'd
 
seen someone pull a 14 inch trout out of a stream barely six inches deep.  I
'm
 
currently putting the final touches on a fly rod that I have been building and am
 
waiting impatiently (
aka chomping at the bit) for the weather to warm up enough
 
to see if I can still fly fish worth a damn. This obcession has also reaped some
 
professional benefits as I have hooked up with some guys who like myself are
 
outdoors fools and are very eloquent when it comes to the rendering of hunting
 
and fishing stories.  I
'm currently collecting a whole slew of them for
 
inclusion in the radio show project. Boy, these guys can sure tell  'em!
 
Missoula is a sort of strange place to live.  It's beautiful in the
 
scenery department as it is surrounded by high, blue mountains that seem to
 
be eternally posing for picture post cards.  It is however, badly polluted in the
 
air department and I have a hard time feeling funny about being from LA (
the
 
prime ridicule city in these parts) when the air is so dirty that on some days
 
you can't even seen a hundred yards ahead of yourself. Too many wood-burning
 
stoves, a LA-type inversion and a couple of wood mills seems to keep the
 
Missoula Valley pretty icky. Another odd thing about Missoula is that it is a
 
college town which if I didn't know better, I
'd think was the reincarnation
 
of Berkeley circa 1968.  It's almost scary sometimes  (and for me, somewhat
 
nostalgic). The countercululture did not die nor don a tie- it moved to
 
Missoula.
 It tends to give the entire town an (dare I say it?) ambience
 
that is in no (
or at least very little) way akin to the rest of the state or
 
the region. Folks outside of Missoula refer to it as "the Moscow of Montana"
 
"The Kremlin" or "The Garden City Where They Grown You-Know-What." Every
 
once in a while, the hipness of the place gets to me and taking a trip out of
 
town serves to remind me that there is another world outside of Missoula County.
 
In spite of the forementioned things which occassionally get my dander
 
up s I have fallen in love with Montana.  I
'm told that it is fairly usual
 
thing to have happen.  Being now an "offical" resident, I am becoming as
 
jingoistic, proud and protective as some of the "nativeMontanans"  (a title
 
worn like a military medal by many).  I have found Montana to be a gourgeous
 
place geographically, and I
've found most everyone I
've met to be profusely
 
endowed with good '
ol southern-style hospitality.  It's sort of like living
 
in East Tennessee without the Southern Baptist Church. People like to
 
drink (
"What the hell else is there to do there?" asks my dear old mother)
 
and they do love to dance -all night long
 all night long
 alll night
 
long.  I never had so much fun in my life as going to a local barn dance and
 
not only playing in the band but actually learning how to move one clod hopper
 
in front  (
or next to) the '
tother in a semi-rhymical manner .
.. an' not squarshin'
 
some poor lady's toes.  I am currently working on my waltzing (a very popular
 
s
tep here abouts) and also learning to "butterfly" which, if you're not
 
familiar with it, is a two speed dance where the band s
tarts with a very slow
 
3
/4 tune, stops and then breaks into a flying hoedown. Really a lot of fun to
 
play and more fun to dance.Methinks it is either a direct descendant or a highbred
 
of polka dancing (
and Jesus! Do they love to polka here!!!). I
, of course, am
 
continuing my research with great vigor in the greatest tradition of the
 
participant-observer.
 
After explaining my work here to one old timer who is a dynamite square
 
dance caller, he said, "Son, i
t sounds to me like you're being paid to have a
 
good time." I can hardly argue with logic like that.
 
My work is great. I
t's wonderful to be able to finally settle down in one
 
place for a while and immerse one's self in that place. I
'm learning a hell of
 
a lot about Montana and also about what I guess I
'd call the Nature of the West-
how and why i
t came about. I must say that my work in the South has been invaluable
 
to me in understanding many things- close families, rural economies, not to
 
mention traditional genres, songs, fiddle tunes, etc. But I find the stuff I
 
did back in California to be also of great help, particularly in working with
 
non-Anglo folks. There's a good-sized Mexican American community in Billings
 
which I find myself drawn to whenever I
'm there. Dan sent me Parades' book
 
on Tex-Mex which I think is going to be quite a help with my work. I keep kicking
 
myself for never taking Spanish in high school (
although my fractured francais
 
comes in handy at times). I
t's funny, though, how much Spanish one picks up simply
 
through osmosis and being raised in a place with so much Hispanic influence like
 
LA. I
t's a little rocky, but I
've been able to make my way a bit with some folks
 
who are not English speakers. I
've taken to studying a 20-year old Spanish text
 
book I picked up in a used book store to try at least to get some of the very
 
basic stuff down. Spanglish doesn't work as good here as i
t does in Delano
 
or Salinas. At any rate, I
'm going to Billings in two weeks (
folks '
round the
 
office claim i
t's only so I can pig out on Chile Verde or Chicken Mole) and
 
I will be recording some corridos. Hot damn. There also seems to be quite a few
 
lyurona (
I know that spelling's wrong!) tales being circulated about a place in
 
Billings where three people were murdered (
Mexican-Americans, of course). I
'm
 
going to try to get some of those on tape. I
t's sometimes difficult for me to walk
 
the cultural line there as there is some really virilent hatred of Mexicans
 
(
and Indians... of course) in Billings and i
t has caused a few tense moments
 
between myself and either folks in the Mexican community or with Anglos who
 
do not share my love or fascination with culture or Chicanos. But, were I in
 
Kentucky, it would probably the same situation except it would be Black folks.
 
After talking with Roger Welsch in LA, I kind of half-dreaded having to
 
hop in and do work with the Native Americans here. I guess my ignorance was
 
getting to me a little. None the less, I
've managed to meet and work with
 
f
olks from some of the tribes here in Montana as well as the non-reservation
 
Indians who live  in the towns and cities. Many people were quick to advise me
 
of the'best'way  to work with Indians. The more I heard the less I liked so I finally
 
just jumped in. I went before the tribal council of the Little Shell Band of the
 
Chippewah-Cree (
Montana Mitchifs) and explained the work I wanted to do. I asked
 
them for their permission to work with members of their tribe (
smart move #1!)
 
and then set out what I felt were important parameters for the Folklife Project
 
doing work with their tribe:
 
1
. Permission from the tribal council
 
2
. A written consent form from the person(s) who is/are being recorded
 
3
. The tapes themselves will be the co-property of the tribe and the
 
Folklife Project
 
4
. The tribe holds copyright to any materials collected.
 
I figured that these things would show good faith on our part and also
 
allow work to be done on their terms. There's been a mass of things that were
 
c
ollected from various tribes in Montana and then printed in books without the
 
permission or knowledge of the Indians. A lot of hard feelings have been
 
engendered by this.and some rituals and ceremonies that were not for public
 
consumption were made public. I figure through the "four-point policy
 
for the documentation of Montana Native Americans" a s
tep towards reconciling
 
some of the previous boo-boos will be made. Personally, I feel that the conditions
 
are the only fair way to protect my informants/resources and the program.
 
I have not as yet been nailed to the barn by militant Indians as Roger
 
cautioned I would be. I
've seemed to have been naive enough and straight-
forward enough to not come off as another pompus, patronizing white boy. The
 
f
olks I have met have been nice and although  there are some vast cultural
 
differences (
particlarly in conversation styles) I
've started learned how to
 
shift into the correct s
tyle and I don't think I
'm doing too bad. We'll see.
 
I
've done a bit with the fiddlers here. They're pretty self-sufficient,
 
though and so I
've just let them know what I
'm doing. I
'm a member of the
 
state organization (
of course) and find my weekends fairly full of playing
 
â 
 
back-up guitar at the bi-weekly jams. They're really a lot of fun and I
've met
 
quite a few musicians from different parts of the state as well as ones who
 
play very different styles of music. Norwegian, French, Texas (
is Texas a
 
country or a state?), and some very nice mixtures thereof. I
've also run
 
into some singers-mostly southern-style singers who's repetoires reflect
 
mostly southern music. The Opry was very popular here for many years and
 
much to my suprise (
considering the mountains between Nashville and a good part
 
of Montana) many of the country singers in the area have repetoires which
 
follow the years 1
946 through 1
958 in commercial country music, falling just
 
short of the Ray Price "For the Good Times" country muzak. I look forward
 
to some nice things coming out of my work with these folks. I
'll be helping them
 
on their next "Montana S
tate Fiddlers" record. Up until now, the quality of
 
the music has been very good but the production was a far cry from decent.
 
I
'm going to help produce the album and try to get some better equipment
 
and circumstances to record the music on/in.
 
Let's see-what else? Oh yeah-ol' Korn's gone electric.After careful con-
sideration and an increasing interest in western swing I have taken up the
 
steel guitar. Leon McAlufe, I ain't but i
t sure is fun. I
've not said anything
 
to any of my bluegrass buddies as I
'm sure I wouldn't hear the end of it (
"..
 
sell out! Plugged-in hillbilly! "
). But I sure enjoy playing swing, particularly
 
"Take the A Train
 
April 9
 
In light of the resounding success of yesterday's celebration (
and a sudden
 
opening of the floodgates of work here at the office), I am continuing the
 
festivities of "Gotta Write Bess Day."
 
I talked to old Smitty last nite back in of Californ'. He's doing very well.
 
He underwent cataract surgÂ®"A about two weeks ago and will be going in again for some
 
more (what he calls) " repair". That fella is unbelieveable. He proudly announced
 
to me that he now call play a fiddle in standard tuning and finds i
t a lot of fun.
 
I send him tapes of my fiddle records occassionally and he send me tapes of his
 
playing and singing. He's still in there writing gospel songs and he has written
 
some real gems. Whenever I get a tape from him of his "new;old time songs" as
 
he calls them, I am just bowled over. Some of his gospel s
tuff would be dynamite
 
sung in four-part harmony by a bluegrass band. I
've been pirating copies of some
 
of his songs and after transcribing them and mailing to Smith registered mail
 
(
poor boy's copyright) I
've sent some off to a few of the folks in the bluegrass
 
biz. Sure would be nice for Smith to get to see some of his songs recorded and to
 
actually get credit for them.
 
I also talked to Barbara last nite (what the hell-figured I might as well
 
call her too!) Bess, our friend in LA needs a little bit of moral support. I
 
believe (
as the song says) she's "Drifting Away from the Shore". She's kinda
 
down about a couple of things, most notably the fact that there's a "push"
 
by Chuck Seeman and some of the other CFS folks to start organizing themselves
 
to get a s
tate folklorist in California and that Barbara was apparently only
 
briefly consulted as an afterthought. I think she's right to be miffed. She
 
is, after all, the only person now residing in California who has had as wide a
 
range of experience in applied folklore and i
t is pretty insulting to not get that
 
recognition.Barbara's problem here lies in the fact that she is not formally
 
associated with a particular institution  and she doesn't have the means and
 
mechanisms to keep in the mainstream. At any rate, a think a call from you
 
might help. She's talking about getting into business administration (
OHMYGOD!!!)
 
and she could use some reminding that she i
s a folklorist and a damn good one at that.
 
She may have mentioned to you that she is working on an idea for a LA City
 
Folklife Specialist. Encourage her''
1
1111
 I think she'd be ideal.
 
Another note of semi-business: I heard from a buddy of mine, Roy Burgess,
 
who lives in Palmdale. Barbara may have told you about him but in case she
 
didn't, Roy is a bluegrass singer and guitar-player. He was born in Alabama
 
and moved out to California. He's well within the boundries of a primary-
t
radition singer and he has emulated the singing s
tyle of the S
tanley Brothers.
 
Roy is really very good. I worked with him for about three months before I left
 
for Kentucky (
both as a folklorist and a mandolin-player in his band) and I
 
really have a  lot of respect for him. He was playing with a group humbly
 
called "Dick Tyner and Train 45" but has since left because the band was play-
music that was not within the realm of his musical tastes (
the band played a lot
 
of modern bluegrass and he hails from the s
chool of bluegrass which was graduated
 
in about 1
951.) At any rate, Roy is interested in getting involved with the
 
Artist in the Schools program in one of the southern mountain s
tates. I think
 
he would be spectacular. He loves to "teach" bluegrass and he has become articulate
 
enough to be able to explain the cultural importance of the music and his place in
 
it. He's dying to get back to the South, too. I know that he has been in con-
tact with Linda Buki but I don't know to what extent or what was said. At any rate,
 
consider this my whole-hearted endorsement for Roy should there be a place for
 
him in an AIS capacity. He loves music an awful lot and I know he would be excellent.
 
AV
  
Has Tom Grigsby contacted you about the NEA position yet? I called him
 
the same day that Bob mentioned it to me and he said he might be interested. I
 
don't know him well enough any more to know i
f he meant "YEA-SOUNDS GREAT!" or
 
"
Thanks, I might check it out." Either way, I
'd like to know what's doin'.
 
I might mention that for the last four weeks I have been "on the road"
 
throughout the state collecting folklore as well as (
as I call i
t) preaching
 
the gospel of the Folklife Project (
I think I lived in Kentucky and close to
 
a Southern Baptist Church too long.) I found some pretty neat people such as
 
a cowboy singer in Billings who plays with a country-western band five nights
 
a week at the "Sneeker Inn." He was raised on the Crow Reservation and was
 
a sheep rancher and a cattleman. I recorded-him briefly and he talked about
 
doing cattle drives to move the stock to the railhead as well as learning
 
guitar-playing f
rom some of the Mexican wranglers who worked for his dad
 
(
a somewhat unique twist on the Bill Monroe learning the blues story, eh?)
 
He sings very much like Hank Williams and is partial to late forties and early
 
fifties country. He's not half bad and I think he may fit very nicely into some
 
of the stuff we're doing. He also plays four-string banjo in a German Polka
 
Band. Versitile group, these Montanans. His name is Wayne Selversen (
Norwegian)
 
and I
'm looking forward to recording him some more on my next trip.
 
I also recorded and photographed a lot of railroad stuff. I went to
 
Glendive and spent two days in the railroad yards talking to the people
 
who work on the section crews and on the trains. Things worked out very well.
 
My great-grandfather was a conductor on the Northern Pacific for many years
 
and my great uncle was the telegrapher at Glendive from about 1
912 to 1
918.
 
When I mentioned that to the foreman of the section gang and told him my
 
great grandfather's name, it was like a magic word had been said. Apparently,
 
of great grandpa Tony Olson was liked as much as Will Rogers and I got the grand
 
tour. I also was able to go out one morning with the section gang and photograph
 
them at work. I
've got a gold mine out in Glendive for my next trip.
 
The rest of that trip consisted of traveling through about 80i of the
 
s
tate. Sure is a big damn s
tate. I was also given the opportunity to prove my
 
ability as a vehicle operator in two instances of blizzards. What fun. I lived
 
through them and have been told that I am now an offical Montanan. I
'm also
 
told by Dave Nelson that I still have to wait another ten years before I can
 
get my permit to purchase my first pair of Tony Lama Cowboy Boots. I think
 
I
'll start lying about my age.
 
Well, I guess that's about it. I hope things are going well with you in
 
D
.C. I
've talked to Bob some and he seems to really be enjoying working there.
 
I
'm glad about that. He's good people. Send my best to the office crowd there
 
and when you see Niaomi and John and Nick send them my regards. You take care
 
and drop a line when you've got a minute.
 
Love,

 Heritage
 
The folklife of Montana is rich and diverse. The state's culture
 
is reflected in cowboy songs, Indian myths, the styles of barns and fences,
 
the skill of traditional craftspeople and the driving sound of fiddle tunes.
 
These influences help to form our heritage and tell us a lot about ourselves.
 
They grow and thrive in our families, ethnic groups, tribes, neighborhoods
 
and communities. We look at our cultural and regional heritage not only as
 
points of reference for the past and our contribution to it, but also as
 
indicators and means of shaping the future.
 
In November,  1979, the Montana Arts Council formally began a program
 
which will help to broaden the understanding of Montana's cultural composition.
 
With the institution of the Montana Folklife Project, the identification,
 
documentation and presentation of the various forms of folk culture will
 
be undertaken to give us another view of ourselves and our neighbors.
 
The term "folklife" refers to the many elements of cultural groups which
 
make them unique, such as sharing the same language, ethnic heritage, occupation,
 
religion or geographic area. Examples can be found in folk music, dances,  folk-
tales, traditional crafts, architecture and rituals. Each of these elements
 
are sustained through time because they are passed through generations and
 
communities and in the process, gleaned of non-essential or unimportant aspects.
 
What remains expresses the basis, the "soul" of a group, because within it is
 
contained the collective wisdom of the past. Folklife is not simply something
 
old that has little use or practice in the modern world.  It is an ever-changing,
 
dynamic element that is seen in the jokes Montanans tell about people
 
from other states, the songs of miners and loggers, stories about certain
 
people and places and so much more.  It expresses a verbal and tangible view of the

 were
 important
 
possessions b
rought w
ith t
hem
 
i
nto t
he  New World. Among
 
t
hese cultural and a
rtistic e
x-
p
ressions was f
iddle music. The
 
f
iddle was an easily portable
 
musical i
nstrument. Each o

t

Another r

S

There were (

Dear S
irs:
 
I h
ave not yet seen the exhibit of Patrick  Ireland's work
 
"Drawing:  1965-1985"  currently d
isplayed at the National
 
Museum of American Art.
 S
ince  I am a colleague of Brian
 
O
'Doherty's,  I d
id read w
ith real  interest the review of h
is
 
show written by Paul  R
ichard and  printed  in the April  14,  1986
 
Washington Post.
 I personally found the review to be a
 
d
isplay of self-protective journalistic cattiness unworthy of
 
a newspaper of your stated principles.
 
What a d
isplay of damp f
ireworks Mr.  R
ichard sets off, the
 
while he i
nsists on coming down four-square on a
ll  s
ides of
 
every i
ssue.
 Mr.  R
ichard's style is to heave a verbal  m
issile
 
and then duck behind a previously prepared position so quickly
 
that only the sting remains.
 A remark such as  "
Ireland's
 
originality,  or perhaps  h
is lack of it..."  is typical  of the
 
article's tactics.
 "
If one tries  to edit out  Ireland's  bows
 
to  D
uchamp and Malevich .
.. there  is not a
ll  that much left.
 
But what i
s  left is worth seeing"  is another such.
 The pretense
 
of even-handedness extends to the headline  (which admittedly
 
presages the tone of the review):  "Patrick  Ireland's Drawing
 
P
ower -- and the Baffling Case of the NMAA".
 What on earth
 
are we to make of that?
 Some  k
ind of d
irty work at the cross-
roads,  I
'll  be bound.
 
To me there is an unfair and uncalled  for sense of innuendo
 
throughout the p
iece,  a s
ly h
inting of private knowledge,  of thing
 
that are not quite being said that would really be scandalous,
 
heh-heh.
 Such writing  i
s unworthy of the standards of journalism
 
the P
ost,  I believe,  tries to stand for,  and  I resent it on
 
behalf not only of my friend,  Brian O
'Doherty,  but of other
 
artists who deserve better and more forthright treatment.
 
incere1y,
 
Bess Lomax H

Bua and I send our belated thankyous for the Heritage catalogues.  This
 
year the awards came full circle for me:
 it was John Jackson who first
 
bent my ear to the folk with '
Gonna lay down my of guitar...'  in the late
 
sixties, and I still love to play his music!
 Lovely to see Bua's Native
 
American kin courting with their own flute.
 Bua and I will be spending
 
a couple of days in schools this month, and I
'll certainly share with the
 
kids the catalogue picture of Mr. Nevaquaya.
 I must also mention that
 
my group of ;
young ethnic Lao musicians will be performing (with my com-
mentary) for the National Music Educators' regional conference here next
 
weekend.
 Some extraordinary khaen (bamboo pipes) playing here!
 
I
'm pleased to pass on, as I mentioned to Dan the other day, that I
've
 
gathered practically 100% of my matching monies out here for the proposed
 
apprenticeship program.
 State,  local, and three foundations are all quite
 
taken with the idea.  Though of course I
'm trying to leave my plans open
 
here still, my schedule has two full days a week ready to go.
 
Here is the report Pat Sanders arranged for me to do of Amy Catlin's
 
Hmong project.
 It was a wonderful event, and I want to thank you for the
 
opportunity to see it and visit with her.  What an inspiring series she
 
envisions.
 I hope that by the time this reaches you her catalogue and
 
tape have also (
I've been working here from a galley proof).
 I
'll enclose
 
a couple of shots I took.
 
Well, I
'm off here to rehearse with my students for a special moment in
 
their own folkness coming this weekend -- our first music for an Irish
 
ceilidh!
 Hope you've survived the snow drifts, and give Bua's and my
 
best to everyone out there.
 
Sincerely,
 
Jan DeWeese
 
P
.S.  Oh yes, I just survived my own rite of passage, got married
 
in New Orleans over the holidays!  With Milton Batiste at
 
our reception, can't help but pass on to you evidence of
 
folk art thriving in the hands of his young followers. NEA
 
no doubt has done some apprenticeships with these guys?
 
My wife teaches English-as-a-Second-Language to Vietnamese,
 
Eritrian, and Salvadorean kids at a high school near here.

Dear Marina,
 
How very nice of you to write me.
 I had wondered from time to time about
 
your family and yourself and hoped that all was going well for all of you.
 
I shall enclose a brochure that describes what I
'm doing as of the moment.
 
I
't both exciting and ironic that you're working with the support of the
 
California Council on the Arts.
 I
've tried many times to turn them towards
 
nutting a folklorist on their staff, bu so far to no avail.
 
To catch you up with the test of the family, Corey is married and living
 
in Vancouver. Canada: she has two adopted children -- 11 and a years old,
 
and both she and her husband are teaching in the Vancouver public schools.
 
They seem very happy, and I
'm looking forward to spending Christmas with
 
them.  Naomi completed her PhD at Berkeley in Physical Anthropology and is
 
living in Haverhill, Massachusetts with her husband, John Bishop (
a film-maker)
 
and their two children, aged 5 and 3
.  So I
'm a grandma four times over.
 
Nick, who is living in Amherst, Massachusetts has failed so f
.ar to add to
 
the Hawes line but he has turned into the family's only full-time musician,
 
playing everything including fiddle, piano, button accordion -- you name it --
and calling contras and square dances.  He makes a precarious living like
 
most musicians, and has turned into a fine field worker on the side.  He may
 
become a folklorist yet.
 
As for me, I
'm not sure what the immediate future holds.
 So far
., the Folk
 
Arts program has survived the various budget cuts, but who knows what's
 
coming down the pike next.
 I haven't sold the Santa Monida house yet, so
 
that's a cushion against my possible return to the west.
 
I was very interested to readiin more detail in the UCLA newsletter about
 
your work.  You might want to think about applying for some federal assistance
 
for some of your projects.
 In that case, don't hesitate to give me or Dan
.
 
Sheehy a call; the f
ray you work it is to telephone 202-634-4282 person-to-
nerson collect, and we will return your call on the federal line.
 
All the best, and do give your parents my very best regards when you write
 
them next.
 
Best wishes and love,
 
Bess

Dear Bess--
It was good to get word of you through my neighbor Steve
 
Sanfield.
 I
've often thought of you over the years but didn't know
 
exactly where you were.
 
Believe it or not,  I
'm still very much involved in folksinging
 
and folklore.
 I ended up with a master's in folklore and mythology
 
from UCLA in 1968 but then retired from the academic world until
 
last year.
 In between I
've travelled,  lived and worked in different
 
places,  including 4 years in a small, mildly remote mountain coi,
.uliunity
 
in western North Carolina.
 That was during my most idealistic back-
to-the-land phase.
 I sure learned a lot about gardening, ballad
 
singing and getting along with neighbors,  though'
 
Now I am living in a rural community in the western Sierra
 
Nevada foothills in Northern California  (gold country as they say),
 
and hope to buy land here and settle down at last.
 It is quite a
 
remarkable place with a healthy traditional community co-existing and
 
sometimes interacting with a more recent "new-age" community.
 Oddly
 
enough there is a real niche b
ier
, )for me as a singer and scholar.
 
Last winter I applied for dd
 -ï¿½4_'i ornia Arts Council grant to be an
 
"artist in residence" in my community--performing folksongs in the
 
local rural school district and collecting oral histories and lore
 
from the old folks living here.
 It is very exciting.
 
In addition to my music,  I
've also taken up working with herbs
 
over the last 12 years--from the practical as well as folkloric point
 
of view.
 I
've got a part-time kitchen-and-garden operation going
 
making herbal medicines  (salves,  tinctures,  syrups,  oils and liniments)
 
and I spend a fair amount of time teaching and writing.
 
I guess the main thing I want to say in this letter, not
 
knowing if I will ever get back east to visit you in Washington,  is
 
that I appreciate all I learned from you.
 Not just how to play the
 
guitar,  but a real love of traditional music and what it means.
 And
 
other things as well.
 You were certainly one of my models in my
 
growing up years.
 Thank you.
 
My parents are living now in Charlotte.
 My dad has retired
 
and they seem to be enjoying this time of life.
 T
hy brothers both live
 
in California:
 Jonathan is a computer wizard and Andrew is a hypno-
therapist.
 
Guess that's all for now.
 Take care.
 Best wishes and

Why? "Because," he c

A
