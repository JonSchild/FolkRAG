M:  Is there a difference?
D:  Yes, Varnum Avenue is where Lowell General Hospital is.  [children in background]  It's in 
Pawtucketville, an altogether different section.  
W:  Maybe you can start your tape over.  [Lots of noise]
D:  No, we can make tons of mistakes and nobody cares.
M:  This is um, I'm trying to be informal on this tape.  The only formal part is me announcing the
date.  
W:  Okay.  
M:  This is kind of right in your eye, isn't it?  [Sounds of chairs dragging on floor]
W:  No, that's okay.  
M:  Okay.  Why don't, if you could just start by giving me a little bit of biographical information.
Who in your family came to Lowell and from what country, and where did they settle?  (W:  
Sure)  Why don't you start.
W:  Okay.  Uh, my maternal grandmother on my, yeah, my maternal grandmother came from 
England around 1910.  
[Tape shuts off and is turned on again]
M:  Okay.
W:  Yes.  My maternal grandmother, her maiden name was Hansbury, came from England as a 
young lady.  And she came over here first, and then at a later date her two younger sisters joined 
her.  And she settled in Centerville.  She was a domestic.   My maternal grandfather came from 
Maine.  Stonington, Maine.  And he settled in Lowell after coming down from the seacoast cities 
of Maine and New Hampshire, and he settled in Lowell, first as a house painter, and then as a 
carpenter.  
M:  And was he English, or Irish?
W:  No, he was, he primarily had Scotch background.  His ancestors came over from Scotland 
and they were seafaring people.  In fact, one of his distant relatives helped lay the transatlantic 
cable.  He was a ship captain in one of the ships that help lay the transatlantic cables.  He could 
have been probably an uncle on his part.  It would be a very distant relative on my part.  That's 
their only big claim to fame outside of being seafolks, seafarers of Maine.  Uh, he didn't go to the
sea like his relatives.  He more or less worked with his hands as a painter and then as a carpenter.
He was a very skillful carpenter.  In the carpentry trade, a person who is very skillful with his 
hands is called a mechanic.  And anyone that's recognized as a mechanic within the trade is 
always revered as a very good carpenter.  And that's what he was.  He was a finished carpenter.  
M:  Do you know where he learned the trade?
W:  He, he was self taught.  Uh, although he didn't do anything outstanding, like an architect 
would design an outstanding building.  He was an accomplished carpenter and he was proud of 
his trade, and he was well sought after for interior finished work in buildings.  
M:  Oh, so he would have done the detailed work.  
W:  Yes, yes.
M:  Like for example?
W:  Uh, an example would be down the street there's Saint Michael's Convent.  And there's a 
chapel within the convent with very ornate woodwork.  And he built that.  So he was that type of 
a man.  
M:  Oh, I've never even been in there.
W:  Yeah.  So he was an accomplished carpenter.  My paternal grandparents both were from 
Ireland.  Uh, they settled in Lowell by various routes.  My grand (--)  (M:  What's that, your?)  
My paternal grandparents.  Uh, my grandfather came to this country and he settled in Milford 
New Hampshire with his folks.  His brothers and his cousins and he eventually came to Lowell, 
whereas my father's mother came directly from Ireland right to Lowell and settled in the Sacred 
Heart Parish.  And at that time, generally immigrants that came from one county in Ireland 
congregated together and uh, that was the experience with her.  She settled in the Sacred Heart 
Parish with all of the relatives that came from Clare and from the Shannon area of Ireland.  
M:  Do you know why they came?
W:  For advancement.  They both settled in this country around the turn of the century, and 
employment was the biggest factor.  Certainly there was none over in Ireland.  So they migrated 
to this country for employment and for a better way of life.  I know my grandmother had a sister 
that lived here and they sent her passage to come over.  And the same thing with my grandfather. 
His brother and relatives in Milford, New Hampshire sent him passage to come over.  And he 
settled in Lowell.  And then they got married.  And he, he worked for the Eastern Mass Street 
Railroad as a conductor.  And he retired from them.
M:  Do you know where they met?
W:  Uh, they met in Lowell.  They had mutual friends in Lowell.  She had family that lived in 
Milford and they, you know, he would come to Lowell to visit his family, and she met that way.  
M:  Because some people tell me their grandparents met at a dance.  
W:  No, I don't know exactly the circumstances, I think it was just more or less at a family social 
gathering that he came in.  
M:  And one last question.  When they came here, did they, did both the men and women work?
W:  No, my grandmother stayed at home all the time.  And my grandfather worked for the 
Eastern Mass Street Railway, plus he also sold insurance for one of the insurance companies.  
You know, he sold them to other fellow immigrants.  And it was more or less just burial 
insurance more than anything else.  To make sure that when they die they were well taken care 
of.  They were very afraid of that.  They wanted to make sure they were put into the grave 
properly.  So they had burial insurance that they purchased.  But I don't think my grandmother 
ever worked.  She had a large family and she took care of them.  
M:  No mill workers?
W:  No mill workers, no, none.  Well I did have an aunt who is still alive, who worked in Suffolk 
Knitting as an office worker.  But uh, not the traditional mill worker, work in the looms.  It was 
more or less administrative type of work.  
M:  So do you consider yourself, do you relate as an English identity, or an Irish identity, or (--)
W:  No, Irish identity.  Um, my mother is very proud of her English heritage, her English/Scotch 
heritage.  And whenever we have family get togethers and we're joking about ancestry, she 
always makes the point to throw in the fact that we're part English and not exclusively Irish.  
M:  Does that seem to have more status to her?
W:  No, I think it's just being contrary.  To make sure that we, we fully understand where we 
came from.  You now, having a name Flanagan, I'm very conscious of my roots.  And I, I don't 
exclusively consider myself to be Irish.
M:  Yeah, that's funny, because I have a name Norkunas, but my mother's Cleary.  (W:  yes!)  So 
since my parents divorced I grew up really in this Irish Catholic household, but nobody could 
guess that.  When they hear, they say your name Norkunas, and they ask me all of these 
questions about Lithuania.  I don't know a thing about it.  It's funny.  What about your 
background?
D:  Well my grandparents on both sides came from Poland.  (M:  Oh!)  And um, my maternal 
grandparents um, I believe met in Poland and came here together.
M:  Came, where's here?  
D:  To Lowell.  And they settled here.  Um, however they had, when my grand, they had three 
children.  No, I'm sorry, they had four.  My mother, her two sisters and a brother.  Now when my 
uncle was about seven or eight my grandfather took him back to Poland to visit relatives there.  
And at that time there was trouble in Poland, and only, he was able to get my uncle back to the 
United States, but he was not allowed to leave.  So he ended up staying in Poland, and he never 
did come back to the United States.  
M:  And so his wife was here with the three girls and a boy?
D:  Yes.  And um, then she developed cancer and she died at a very early age.  She was only 
forty-three when she died.  So my mother and her two sisters, and my uncle did work in the 
mills.  And they worked very early.  In fact um, only my oldest aunt finished high school.  The 
other, my mother went to night school, but my other aunt never finished even high school.  
M:  Do you know what mill they worked at?
D:  My one aunt worked in Merrimack Manufacturing, the site of which is the new Post Office.  
My mother worked in what was referred to as the Silk Mill.  And that's Market Mills Housing 
right now.  And my other aunt, the oldest sister worked for a time, I'm not sure which mill she 
worked in, but then she traveled on to New York and she worked for Schrafts Candy.  
M:  Yeah, and when they came to Lowell do you know what part of the city they first came to?
D:  Um, it's the downtown area and it was called Williams Street.  And you know where the 
George Street, is it 21 George Street building that's a lot of glass, and it's over near the Hilton?  
Okay, one side of that is um, where the court house is, the other side of it is Williams Street.  So 
that part was tenements and that's where my, my mother grew up.  
M:  Now would it have been necessarily a Polish section? 
D:  No, I don't think so.  Even though I know that, and listening to my aunts and my mother, 
there were quite a few Polish people that lived in that area, but I don't think it was necessarily a 
Polish section, because the Polish people seemed to settle in lower Centraville.
M:  Is that near Saint Casimir's?
D:  Yes.
M:  And where's the other Polish Church?
D:  It's on High Street.  Now the difference between the two is (--)
M:  I know.  I never (--)  People, I have so many explain it to me and I never get this.  
D:  Saint Casimir's is the Polish National Church.  (M:  Okay) It is not a Catholic Church.  They 
don't believe in the Pope.  Everything else is the same, but they just do not believe in the Pope, 
the infallibility of the Pope.  Whereas Holy Trinity is a Polish Catholic Church.  And that's a 
Roman Catholic Church. 
M:  So do they, are they like an independent religion?
D:  Well it's called a national because there are other national churches that don't have allegiance 
to the Pope also.  They just have their own grouping.
M:  And what about, what about the other side?
D:  Okay, my father's parents did not meet in Poland.  They came here separately.  I don't know 
exactly where my grandmother settled, but my grandfather settled in Pennsylvania and worked in
the goal mines.  And eventually did come to Massachusetts and met my grandmother.  But they 
were farmers, and they settled in around North Andover, in the Lawrence area.  And they did 
own property and they did have their farms.  
M:  So they never actually lived in Lowell, or in the Urban scene?  
D:  No.  No.  They never did.  Well urban um, the closest they did for urban was the outskirts of 
Lawrence.  
M:  Okay.  And then how did your parents get to meet each other from Andover here.
D:  It was a blind date.  (M:  Oh!)  A friend of my mother's was going out with a friend of my 
father's, and it was a blind date.  
M:  Was it important to the family that they married Poles?
D:  I suppose at that time it was.  It was never a question when I married Bill.  That was never a 
problem.  My mother only was concerned that he be Catholic.   Nationality really did not play 
that much of a part in it.  
M:  Do you belong to the Holy Trinity, or did you?  
D:  Um, at the time we got married, that's where we got married.  But we belong to Saint 
Michael's now.  
M:  So it wouldn't be something that would be important to you to go to the Polish church?  
D:  No, but every once in awhile we do.  We still uphold a lot of the Polish custom.  At Easter 
time there is a ceremony where they bless the food that you're going to eat Christmas day.  And 
we still uphold that tradition.  
M:  At Christmas time, or at Easter?
D:  Easter.
M:  They bless the food that you're going to eat?
D:  On Easter morning.  (M:  Oh, oh.)
M:  At Christmas time there is uh, actually Christmas Eve is a traditional, Polish Christmas Eve, 
and you put straw under the table cloth to represent the manger.  And its a meatless, everything is
meatless.  There's an odd number of courses.  You set a place for the uninvited guest.  And 
everything has tradition to it.  And we do still uphold that tradition.  
D:  And why, why not meat?
M:  I'm not sure exactly.  I don't know what the symbolism in that was.
D:  You know it's funny, I find that with a lot of people I talk to.  And since I'm not usually on the
other side, sometime people will say to me, you know, why this?  And I say, I don't know why.  
While Yilderay will ask me, "why do you do this?"  And I'll say, "it's just how it is."  But it's 
funny, sometimes people have explanations, you know.  I don't know if they're true or not, but 
they (--)  
W:  I would think the reason for the meatless part of the meal is because when we were young 
you couldn't receive Communion at church in the morning unless you fasted from midnight on.  
And I think you couldn't have any meat, but you could eat fish on fast days, days of abstinence.  
You couldn't have meat, but you could have fish.  On Fridays we always had to have fish.  (M:  
Oh, all right)  And I think probably it was more of a religious obligation to abstain from eating 
meat, because Poland is a very rural and agrarian society, and they would have meat in their 
households, but they probably wouldn't have fish.  And probably the church put the requirement 
that the feast before the holiday that you abstain to meat and you just have fish.  In some cases I 
don't even think they have fish.  It's probably just vegetables and you know, normal food you'd 
find at a farm.  And fish could have been just something that they threw in as part of the 
requirement.  
M:  But maybe not from [unclear] the agrarian people, maybe the fish pot wasn't there.  
W:  That could have been, yeah.  But you know, it's a Christmas tradition that families carried 
forward.  I know my mother-in-law and her cousin, primarily my mother-in-law would have it 
every Christmas.  She'd have the Wielija at her house.  But when she passed away my wife and 
her cousin, her mother's cousin, picked up the tradition.  So we alternate each year from one 
household to the next. 
M:  Oh you'll spend Christmas one house one year, and (--)
W:  Christmas Eve, yes.  But some households have as many as you know, twenty-five, thirty, 
fifty people at their Wielija.
M:  Valire?
W:  That's what they call it.
D:  That's the name of the Christmas Eve Supper.
W:  How do you spell that?
D:  W I E l I J A.
M:  But you pronounce it Vilia?
W:  Vilia, yeah.  The W is pronounced as a V.
D:  And the J is pronounced like a Y.  
W:  But the Lithuanians have a similar type of a dinner.  And a friend of mine is Polish, and his 
wife is Lithuanian.  And the wife's uncle puts on a big feast, and he's Lithuania.  And it's very 
similar type of event. 
M:  Is that in Lowell?
W:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  The um,
M:  Do you feel comfortable with it?
W:  Certainly.  I think its (--)
D:  Christmas presents are opened too on Christmas Eve.  
W:  You know, I think it's very important because there's so much of ones culture and heritage 
that's lost in the normal course of events.  As people pass away the other person doesn't keep, 
you know, if the survivors have a tendency not to be as active in bringing the culture and the 
heritage forward.  So I find it very hard.  I don't know if my daughters will keep it going or not.  
I don't think this cousin's daughters will keep it going to the extent that their respective mother's 
do.  But it's nice to be a part of it.  It doesn't hurt to sit down once a year and you know, and 
bring your roots back again.
M:  Do you do anything at the Christmas Holiday that you think of as Irish?
W:  No, no, because my, even though my heritage is Irish I really never fully discovered it until I 
was an adult.  As a child my mother and father were separated, so there was a real, there wasn't a 
strong influence on my father's side.  And it wasn't until I made a determination to reach out and 
find the particular Irish culture, so there was really nothing on my background to the extent of 
the Polish background.  About the only thing we celebrate like most once a years Irishmen is 
Saint Patrick's Day.  But I remember the Ancient Order of Hibernians, you know, and uh (--)
M:  What is that?
W:  It's a fraternal organization of men of Irish heritage.  
M:  And what do you do when you go to the meetings?
W:  I haven't been to a AOH Meeting for awhile, but normally it's, it's to make you more aware 
of your heritage.  Back in the 11th and 12th Century when the Catholics were being persecuted 
by the English, and they couldn't have their own priest.  And priests if they were caught, they 
were murdered by the English, because it was against the law to have an English Ceremony.  The
uh, some of the men would ban together and protect the priests and protect the people during 
Mass.  And that's where the Hibernian Society got it's start.  And probably up to the 17th Century
it was strictly a Gaelic type of a function.  And then as the immigrants came into America they 
went to Australia and they traveled through Europe, the Society expanded.  And it came into the 
United States in the 1830's just before the famines.  In fact they just celebrated their 150th 
Anniversary as being you know, being in America.  But it's a paternal organization of Irish 
Catholic Men.  
M:  So just, I mean just as a basic question, if you go to a meeting, but would you go with them? 
No?
D:  No.
W:  No, it's strictly a man's organization.
D:  They do have a Ladies Auxiliary, but where I don't have the Irish Heritage, I don't really 
think as though I would be a part of that.  
M:  Is it like, would you have dinner and just sort of talk about a particular topic, or (--)  I'm 
trying to imagine.
W:  Well normally monthly meetings, they would hold the regular business meeting, and then 
they would probably have refreshments and maybe sandwiches after the meeting.  But once a 
year they would have a president's dinner, where it would be a regular sit-down function.  Our 
wives are included in that meeting, and it's just a very light business agenda.  But at the regular 
monthly meetings they would normally have some information about Ireland.  Some discussions 
about history, culture, heritage, things like that.  
M:  And what will be the business?
W:  The business meeting?
M:  I mean what business do they have?
W:  Well they would, there's certain cultural programs that are ongoing.  Notre Dame has an Irish
Studies Chair that's supported by the Hibernians in the United States.  Um, that's one example. 
They foster the Gaelic language, like a renewal of it, especially in Ireland.  So they have regular 
Gaelic classes here that they try to keep the language alive.  And that's especially helpful to the 
immigrants that come into the country that still want to keep that very strong bind to Ireland.  So 
they have a Gaelic Program.  They have dances.  So one evening they may teach the men and 
women different Irish dances, so that when they have the monthly, the two or three month dance 
where they have strictly Irish music, people would be able to, to dance to it.  It's just a society to 
keep Irish culture alive, and to keep your connection to it.  
M:  Tell me the name again?
W:  The Ancient Order of Hibernians.  
M:  How do you spell Hibernians?
W:  H I B E R N I A N S.  Hibernia is a Latin work for Ireland.  
M:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
W:  Back in Lowell at the turn of the Century they had AOH Division, a Chapter is called a 
Division.  They had AOH Divisions in Lowell.  They probably had fifteen divisions.  Each 
county in Ireland, there was, there's thirty-one counties, if in Lowell there was a couple of 
hundred men from one particular county they formed their on AOH Division.  And I know the 
Sacred Heart Parish had a half a dozen different counties represented, so they had a half a dozen 
different divisions.  In Lowell the only one alive is Division 19.  And it was a mixture of 
Division 8 and Division 11. They put, they put all the Charters together of the two Divisions.  So 
we call it Division 19.
M:  Which parish is that in?
W:  There's no parish now.  Although we work through Sacred Heart Parish, that's where it was 
organized.  And the priest allows the school hall to be used.  
M:  At the Sacred Heart?
W:  At the Sacred Heart.  But it isn't an organization that's strictly generic to the Sacred Heart.  
They just happened to have their meetings there.  
M:  Do you belong to other club?
W:  Knights of Columbus.  East End Club here in Centraville.  
D:  Jersey Associates.  
W:  Yeah, the Jersey Associates which is a neighbor group.  Um the [Tracy's Inspired?], right?
M:  Do you belong to clubs also?
W:  Um, not really.  
M:  It's not a requirement.  (D:  No)  I was just wondering.  
W:  No.
D:  Well I'm very involved in educational type things.  And the, I'm Vice-President Elementary of
the Teacher's Union.  So that keeps me very busy.  
M:  Because I'm trying to wonder is there's sort of social things that where people meet up with 
their friends, or I mean do you both ever go to the East End Club?
W:  I go there occasionally for meetings.  Uh, there's a meeting once a month, and I generally go 
to that meeting, but that's the only social club that I belong to.  Uh, I'm a member as I say, the 
AOH, and I don't go to their meetings usually, because I never have time.  And the Knights of 
Columbus, their meetings are twice a month.  And I haven't been to too many meetings.  Uh, (--)
M:  That's a fraternal organization?
W:  It's a religious fraternal, yeah, for Catholic men.
D:  We went to the East End CLub Saturday for the Chicken Barbecue Dinner.
W:  Yeah, but the East End CLub is a social club in Centraville.  And outside of going to their 
monthly meetings we usually don't go down there.  
M:  Was Saturday a special once-a-year, or(--)
W:  I guess they have a chicken barbecue once a year and we went there for that.  They had a 
Road Race in July and I went down for that, but generally we, we lead a very busy life 
professionally.  And we don't have time for clubs.  Like Mt. Pleasant, The Vesper Country CLub 
we're not into that type of an environment.  We're busy enough outside of the house, that when 
we have time we try to stay home or do things together.
M:  Yeah, it becomes a luxury huh?
D:  Yes.
M:  Like falling asleep in the pool.
D:  [Laughs]
M:  That's funny.  Maybe you can describe to me a little bit.  I've been asking people what 
Centraville, was or Lowell and then Centraville was like in their parent's generation and then 
what it's like now.  The changes that have taken place.  But maybe we can work backwards and 
say, you can tell me a little bit about, let's start with Centraville and tell me, if you could describe
the section of the city to me.  
W:  Well Centraville is a very large geographic area, and it's bounded on two sides by water, the 
Merrimack River and Beaver Brook that comes down from New Hampshire, through Dracut, 
into Lowell.  And where Beaver Brook intersects with the Merrimack, it's at I would thing to the 
western end of Centraville.  And the remaining parts of Centraville are bounded on both sides by 
Dracut.  Dracut being the north and the Merrimack River on the south and Beaver Brook on the 
west, and the opposite end, Dracut on the east.  It probably has 15,000 residents out of about 
96,000 residents for Lowell.  Uh, parts of it are very congested, the lower parts of Centraville, 
sometime referred to as Lower Centraville, or Centraville Proper.  It's very congested.  
M:  Where would that be?  What streets?
M:  Uh, it starts at the Beaver Brook and it runs up Lakeview Avenue, New York, Ennell, 
Boisvert Street, West Street, Coburn Street, Jewett Street, Fulton Street.  It really doesn't get 
thinned out until it hits Bridge Street.  And when it crosses Bridge Street, then it comes into a 
section of Centraville called Christian Hill.  And the further north you go on Christian Hill, up in 
elevation, it becomes less populated.  [M:  Unclear]  More affluent, yes.  Yeah.  This particular 
land that this house was sitting on is zoned a single family two, meaning it's less populated.  It's 
the second classification for a single family home.  The first classification of a single family 
home is that you need 10,000 square feet for a piece of property.  And an S2, all you need is 7500
square feet.  So you can have a smaller lot.  Whereas an S1 you need a larger piece of land.  But 
this particular land is 15,000 square feet, which in some cases is three or four house lots that 
would fit in the lower part of Centraville.  But we have a very comfortable piece of land up here. 
Down below it's, it's all strictly working class families.  Very rarely do you find a professional 
living down there, only because of the upper mobility that people seem to want.  Once a person 
progresses up the social economic ladder, they move out of lower Centraville as soon as they can
into Christian Hill, the Highlands, or Belvidere, being the place that a lot of people reach for.  
M:  Is that going along ethnic lines?
W:  Years ago it was probably ethnic lines, but now it's not so much.  I don't know what the 
social economic breakdown is of Belvidere.  But years ago it was primarily Irish professional 
type of people.  All the Yankees lived in Belvidere and they lived in the Highlands, but you very 
rarely found an old Yankee family living in Centraville.  You know, Centraville was primarily 
working class, Polish, French, Irish, and some English.  Christian Hill was more Polish and Irish,
and there was Greeks families living in Christian Hill.  You don't find too many Greek families 
living down in lower Centraville.  Greeks make up a good portion of Lowell and they're 
represented here in Christian Hill, but they're not too much in lower Centraville.  
M:  That's funny because a lot of the other groups pass through lower Centraville.  
W:  Um, yeah.  The Greeks settled in the Acre.  They discovered the Acre after the Irish.  And 
they generally moved from there to Christian Hill or out of Lowell to Dracut.  Um, there's some 
very prominent Greek families that got their start in the Acre and settle in Dracut.  Uh, they 
bypassed Centraville.  Because when Lowell was being developed as a city in the mid 1800's, 
everything on this side of the Merrimack River was Dracut.  Everything on the other side was 
Lowell exclusively.  So people moved within Lowell.  They really didn't cross the River to 
Dracut because it was all farmland and pasture land.  And this section of Dracut was annexed 
into Lowell, because at that point there was a whole new wave of immigrants were coming into 
the area.  They didn't go through the Acre. 
TAPE I, SIDE A ENDS
TAPE I, SIDE B BEGINS.
W:  ...decker houses were already built.  The streets were already laid out.  And the public 
services were already there.  The schools and the fire stations, it was already there over in the 
Acre.  And in the late 1800's when Centraville was being developed a different class of 
entrepreneurs developed Centraville from the ones that developed the Acre.  So if Martha 
Cleary's family settled in Lowell, from Ireland, you probably did it in the Acre.  And as your 
mobility went upward, you moved out to Back Central Street, or to Christian Hill, because it was
the ideal place to go.
M:  Back Central Street?
W:  Back Central Street.  
M:  That's not Portuguese?
W:  Well it is now, because they were a later migration just like the Greeks were a later 
migration.  So let's say Martha Cleary's family came from Country Cork and you went into as an 
example, Broadway Street, as your lot in life increased you moved out into a little better area of 
living conditions and Greek immigrant came in.  Because your apartment was vacant they moved
right into it. And eventually enough people came from Athens that clustered together just like 
when the people are come over from Ireland they clustered together through the common bonds. 
But when Centraville was being developed, the opportunity of transferring across the river wasn't
there to a lot of the immigrants that lived in the Acre.  But some people came directly from 
Poland and settled into the Lakeview Avenue area, because their Church and their bakery was 
there, and their stores were there.  
M:  What do you mean the opportunity wasn't available?  They couldn't go from the Acre to 
Centraville?
W:  Because when the Polish immigrants came in they didn't go into the Greek sections.  They 
developed their own sections.  And Centraville was right for developing at that time for that 
wave to come in. 
M:  Do you when the Poles settled in Centraville?
W:  That would be in the late 1800's, because the break away of the two churches was in the 
early 1900's, 1910, 1920.  A lot of the older members of the Polish community that exist today 
were kids when, young children when the break occurred between the two churches.  And they 
never really understood why the break occurred.  You could have brothers in one family, one 
went to Saint Casimir's, and one went to Holy Trinity.  Uh, would there be a bitterness between 
them because of the difference?
D:  Not really, because in my particular situation I have um, well I had because they have since 
passed away, but there were two sisters.  And one of them belonged to Holy Trinity, and the other
one belonged to Saint Casimir's.  
M:  Do they live near each other?
D:  No.  Uh, the one that belongs to Holy Trinity lived in Tewksbury, and the one that belonged 
to Saint Casimir's lived on Lakeview Avenue.  But they were very close sisters.  
M:  And why did one choose one church and one the other?
D:  I'm really not sure.  
W:  Yeah, I don't know either.  It's probably just you know, the mood that they were in at the time
that they, that they selected.  Uh, you know, maybe they were influenced by the older members 
of the community, people they worked with.  It could be that the sister that lived in Tewksbury, 
her husband ran a small farm.  The sister that lived in Lowell worked in the mills.  So it could be 
that other people they worked with had influence over them, verses you know, relatives you 
know, that influenced.  
D:  Or it could have even been the husbands that they married that belonged to the respective 
churches, and the wives just went along with them.  But there was no animosity between the two 
of them.  That's in my particular case.  It could have been different in other cases, but I didn't see 
it in my case.  
M:  Because I guess in the case of the Polish church it would be different.  People would, well in 
the case of Catholics your church would be where you live.  But the Polish would have to choose
if they were outside that area which church to go to?  I mean if a Pole lived far from say, Saint 
Casimir's but they wanted to go there, they'd make the trip (D:  Right) rather than go to Sacred 
Heart.  Is that fair to say that?
D:  Yes.  Yeah.  Why don't you put the lights on.
M:  If you have to get up just let me know, I can shut this off.  
W:  No, I'll get up in a minute.  We have lights so that, we can just put them on.  
D:  We have a lighted lilac bush.  
M:  Oh!
W:  But we have to string, bring the electric cord out to plug it in.
M:  Christmas lights?
D:  Yeah, actually.
W:  Yes, yeah.
M:  Oh that's nice.  I always like that.  
W:  Quincy Market affect right?
M:  Yeah, Quincy Market of Lowell.
W:  But to get back to your question, I would think that the reason why the Polish and some 
Irish, and English, and French settled over here was that the Acre was completely populated and 
there was no place for them to move in.  And this area was convenient for expansion at the time.  
And Real Estate speculators built houses that would accommodate them to come in.  But if you 
went to the Acre in it's heyday the triple deckers that people lived in would probably be found in 
the counterpart to lower Centraville in the French areas where Saint Louis Church is.  Those 
were the large three deckers.  And the closer you moved up to here from there, the less popular 
they were.  It was primarily duplexes in the remaining part of Centraville.  On West Fourth 
Street, there were some triple deckers on West Sixth Street, Lakeview Avenue there were some 
triple deckers, but the majority of the homes were duplexes like we have through here, but they 
were tightly knit, close together.  
M:  And what's the French, what streets make up the French section?
W:  Well I would think Ennell Street, Boisvert Street, Carolyn Street, that whole area down there.
I don't mean to stereotype them by saying the French district, but there was Saint Louis Church, 
Saint Louis School, Saint Louis High School.  Saint Louie Circle.  (M:  What's that?)  It was a 
social club that was part of Saint Louis.  There was a bowling alley in there.
M:  Does it exist still?
W:  Now it's a printing company, Screen Tech has a printing, but it was called Saint Louie's 
Circle.  And there was Centraville Social Club, which was primarily a French Social Club.
M:  That still exists, doesn't it?.
W:  It certainly does, yes.  Yeah. 
M:  Is it still a French club?
W:  Yes it is, yeah.  So ethnic groups have a tendency to stick together, live together, trade in the 
same stores, because of the common bond.  You know, their language and their customs and their
culture.  So that's primarily a French area down there. 
M:  Is it true todays?
W:  Yes, yeah.  Although you know, people will buy homes that are economical to them, and just 
because you're a French neighbor it doesn't mean that it's all French people living on the street.  
But it's predominantly French.  
M:  Will people buy a home in a place because it's an ethnic group?
W:  I think so, given a choice.  You'd go for familiar surroundings if you had the opportunity.  
And a lot of times homes are sold between family friends and close relatives.  Like there's a 
house for sale across the street.  We know it's for sale.  There's not a "For Sale" sign on it, but if 
we had, we have a friend that would like to live there, we'd go out of our way to make sure that 
they're aware of the sale, because we know they'd be a nice family for the house.  It's the same 
way down lower Centraville, the Acre, you know, the Highlands.  We like to keep a stable 
neighborhood.  And if you know if somebody was interested in a house, and if you think the 
neighborhood would be better for them if they lived here, you know, we'd go out of our way to 
try to recommend it.  
M:  How stable are the neighborhoods now?
W:  Uh, the neighbors, the neighborhoods that have a strong relationship with each other look 
very stable, but lower Centraville there's a large percentage of absentee owned properties.  So 
there's a tendency to move all the time down there.  But in the neighborhoods where there's a 
predominance of ownership by residents to live in the houses, it becomes more stable   
D:  And we're seeing a great influx right now of the Southeast Asians.  And in lower Centraville 
that seems to be the group that is moving in and taking a lot of the area over.  And they will have 
many many people live in one apartment.  So this is presenting a problem.  And there are certain 
streets in, in lower Centraville that also have a large amount of Hispanics, primarily Puerto Rican
people that live there.  So it is changing.
M:  The ethnic character?
D:  Yes.  
M:  Now will they mix up together or the Asians stay in one area and the Hispanics in another.  
W:  Well I think the, in the Acre that the Asians are pushing the Hispanics out by shared 
numbers.  Maybe twenty-five years ago there was a very large Black population in Lowell, and 
they lived in for the most part, housing that wasn't attractive to the other ethnic groups or social 
groups.  But when the Hispanics started to move in those homes for the most part were probably 
in a better living situation that they had been accustomed to over in Puerto Rico.  So they didn't 
mind homes that were in less desirable situations.
M:  Where was it?  Was this is in the Acre?
W:  In the Acre.  The Acre, the Lower Highlands, Back Central Street, parts of Centraville.  So 
the Hispanics pushed some Blacks out.  The Blacks, because of the Civil Rights movement 
started to move upward.  Those that had the potential to move up.  And they moved up and out, 
and the Hispanics move in.  And now the Southeast Asians are coming into Lowell, and Hispanic
living conditions are better than what the Southeast Asians were familiar or accustomed to.  And 
they didn't mind the overcrowding, they didn't mind the cockroach infested buildings, and the rat 
and fermine infested buildings that are in Lowell.  They were glad to have four walls and a roof 
over their head that may have leaked occasionally.  So they're pushing the Hispanics out.  And 
some Hispanics have upward mobility through Wang and all the other industrial complexes.  And
some Hispanics are moving in to the Government sector.  So it's logical in the waves of 
immigrants through time, they always push up the previous immigrations groups.  And now it's 
the Southeast Asians.  Next year it may be Indians, it may be Pakistanis.  Who's to know what 
the next immigrant wave it.  It could be Mexicans coming from across the border.  And they will 
settled in for the areas that the Southeast Asians are accustomed to now.  
M:  It's funny in a way that Lowell is a [unclear] for the immigrants, because it's not a very 
welcoming city by the other ethnic groups.
W:  No, yeah.
D:  No, but they have a lot of job opportunities here.  And that's what draws them in.  Housing is 
really at a premium right now.  Even poor housing is at a premium.  But the job opportunities 
abound.  
W:  If you think of Lowell not as a city, but as a microcosm of the United States, Lowell opens 
its door to immigrant groups, and they come in.  And they keep coming until the city becomes 
saturated and then they move.  That immigrant moves up and out, and the other one comes after 
them.  You know, there are certain jobs that are available to everybody, but the number of jobs 
are limited.  So government, social programs are created in Lowell to help them out, just like 
they're creating the United States and the Democratic society.  You now, so what's happening in 
Lowell is happening in New York City, or happened in Chicago, will happen in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, you know, until (--)
M:  But the neighborhood concept doesn't die, does it?  Or does it?  
W:  No.  If anything I think the neighborhoods concept gets strengthened, because there's 
different people that come in that have different viewpoints, you know, protect the neighborhood.
Um, when a person doesn't have any future, they have a tendency to accept anything that comes 
along.  But as you get more security in the world, you become more protective of what you have.
You know, it's just like the wagon trains moving out west.  They'd group around at night for 
security, and I think that's what the neighborhoods are getting to, you know.  The waves of 
people moving upward in the city, moving into the neighborhoods.  And eventually the people 
that have been in the neighborhoods for awhile, they band together and they try to stop certain 
immigrant groups from coming in.  I don't think it's fair to say that Lowell is a racist city, I think 
it's fair to say that Lowell, it's residents in the neighborhoods are very protective of what they 
have.  They don't like to see the neighborhoods destroyed. 
M:  What would you say is your neighborhood, the place that you really feel is your sort of close 
neighborhood?
W:  Probably within three hundred yards of our house is a close neighborhood.  Uh, even though 
we can get in our car, or we can walk in all directions, we really only know the people that we 
live in our immediate area.  
M:  So two houses down on every side, or three?  
D:  I suppose Varnum Street not being a large street we do know all the people that live on this 
street.  And we also know a couple of people that live behind us.  Uh, teaching in the Varnum 
School, which is a five minute walk from here, I know quite a few people that live on other 
streets in Christian Hill.  So that helps too.
W:  But our immediate neighborhood is probably just the homes within easy walking distance.  
Our church is within our neighborhood, although a little more than the three or four hundred 
yards.  The schools are within our neighborhood.  The fire department is a little way.  The stores 
are within the neighborhood.
M:  Do you trade at, what stores do you trade at?
W:  Down on Bridge Street, CVS.
M:  Is that where you do your food shopping?
D:  Well no, food shopping (W:  Well food shopping, Demoulas') I do DeMoulas', but DeMoulas'
on Bridge Street expanded.  But when they expanded they didn't expand the walls, they only 
expanded their products, which mean that they have narrower lanes so they could accommodate 
more produce and more products.  When they did that it meant for very narrow, narrow lanes.  So
I don't like to shop here, but I do shop in the DeMoulas' on Tewksbury.  However they really 
knew that this was a problem, and DeMoulas is in the process of expanding.  And they will have 
a much larger store.  So then that probably will mean I will go back to Bridge Street.  
M:  Do you have any neighborhood stores?
D:  Well yes, there is a little grocery store that is across the street from the Varnum Store, um, 
Varnum School.  (M: Flynn's?)  Yes.  
M:  I went in, the guy did not look like a Flynn.  I said, "are you Mr. Flynn?"  He said, "no."
W:  It's been sold a half a dozen times since Mr. Flynn owned it.  When Mr. Flynn owned it, it 
was a neighborhood store.  And then the fellow names Breton bought the store from the Flynn 
family and he ran it as a neighborhood store, but it wasn't the way Flynn did.  Then subsequent 
owners destroyed the business.  And now it's no longer really a neighborhood store that people 
can automatically go to.  If we need a can of milk, or a loaf of bread, we'll go down the hill to 
Bridge Street to buy that.  We wouldn't think of going up to Flynn's Market, although (--)
M:  What makes a neighborhood (--)  Oh, go ahead.
W:  Although the woman across the street, she gets a food order from Flynn's Market every 
Saturday morning.
M:  Delivered?
D:  Because they deliver.
W:  Yes.  Yeah, but you know, we just don't find that store that convenient to us.  So we'd go 
down to Bridge Street if we needed something very fast, or DeMoulas, you know.
D:  And being a small store they're prices are really high.  
M:  What makes a neighborhood store?
W:  A social place really.  You go in there and you meet your friends, and you know, the owner or
the attendant would know everybody by first names.  And kids would hand around outside.  It 
would be a social gathering point.  
M:  And so do you have one in here, up here?
W:  I think Fruen's on Bridge Street is probably the closest to that.
D:  Fruen's is probably the closest.
W:  Especially for the old residents of Centraville that would automatically go to Fruen's, 
because it's always been a Centraville place.  You could go get a cup of coffee, stand outside, you
know, watch the traffic, you know, talk to your friends.  
M:  I don't understand why they don't put booths in there.
W:  I know it, yeah.  In fact your uncle lived above Fruen's.  Yeah.  Both Desmond and Cleary 
lived there.  And they moved up.  Upper mobility again.  
M:  Yeah.
D:  Put the lights on.  
M:  [Unclear]
W:  Yeah, why don't you.  
M:  Uh, why don't you tell me what the Jersey Association is and how it got its name.   
W:  Well the Jersey Associates is a neighborhood organization.  And it was originally intended to 
serve all of Centraville.  Jersey Associates got its name from the section of Lowell called Jersey.  
And back probably in the 20's, 1920's, 1930's Centraville was called Jersey.  The Centraville part 
of town that we live in, as soon as you came across the Merrimack River from the downtown 
area you went over the Bridge Street Bridge, which is now the John Cox Bridge, but when you 
went across that bridge that section of Centraville was called Jersey.  Not lower Centraville 
where the Aiken Street Bridge is.  And there's a couple of reasons, a couple of explanations as to 
why it was called Jersey.  If you go across from New York City, go across the Hudson, you go 
into New Jersey.  And sometimes New Jersey was referred to as just Jersey.  I'm going to Jersey 
or something.  So that's one explanation.  The second one is, and I think it's more credible, when 
you came across the Bridge Street bridge when it was still Dracut it was all pasture land, and 
farmers had cows grazing.  And some of the early prints of Lowell in the 1820's and 1930's.  The 
prints of Lowell were taken from the First Street Hills, or the top of Beacon and Durand Street, 
looking across the river to Lowell.  And there's cows grazing in the background or the 
foreground.  So they think that the farmers had cows, Jersey cows.  And that's how the name 
Jersey came about.  But anyway, when John Cox, the State Senator's father, who is John Cox 
also, one is John H., and the other is (--)  No, one is John E., the other is John F. Cox, when the 
father wanted to put a neighborhood organization together, he worked with the five service clubs 
in Centraville.  East End Club, the Dom Polsky Polish Club, the Polish American Veterans Polish
Club, the Centraville Social Club, and the Armenian American Veterans Club.  
M:  In Centraville?
W:  Yes.
M:  Is that still here?
W:  No.  It's a defunct organization.  The Armenian Veterans purchased Saint Louis Circle from 
Saint Louis Parish.  And they put in like a Veterans of Foreign Wars Chapter, but it was the 
Armenian Veterans.  They purchased that building.  And a man named George Garabedian was 
Commander of that Veterans Organization.  So the original idea was for the five service 
organizations to serve as the headquarters for the Jersey Associates.  And each month we'd have 
meetings in one service club and the next month we'd rotate.  And eventually the whole 
Centraville both Christian Hill,  Centraville proper, and lower Centraville will be served by this 
neighborhood organization, because it never really had a neighborhood organization before.  And
at first residents from all throughout Centraville would go to the meetings, but eventually 
evolved into a neighborhood organization that was Centraville Proper and Christian Hill.  And 
we'd meet between the East End Club and the Polish American Veterans Club on Coburn Street.  
And it's an organization for residents that live in Centraville, or people that work in Centraville 
that have businesses or employees.  And it's an organization for people to come to if they have a 
problem. It would help them out.  But it's not an activist organization that would go out and try 
and find problems.  It was just to be there for people to come in when they had a zoning problem,
or if they didn't feel they were getting to proper police and fire protection.  Or if someone was 
leaving trash out on the sidewalk on a Friday prior to trash collection on Monday, they would 
call us.  Then we'd call the police or the Public Works Department and have the issue taken care 
of.  
M:  Why wouldn't they just call the police directly?
W:  Because they didn't realize they could do that.
D:  Or they didn't feel as though they had, they were responded to as quickly as they wanted to.  
And you might be interested if you have time tomorrow, there is a meeting of the Jersey 
Associates at the East End Club at 7:30.  
M:  And what's, what would you dis, who would go.  Would there be (--)
W:  Anyone that lived in Centraville could go.  
M:  They can go.
W:  Oh sure.  We've been working with a group of residents on Billings and Barker Avenue.  
Billings Street and Barker Avenue.  There's a big condominium development going in.  So these 
residents are very concern about what's going to happen to the neighborhood once the 
condominiums are lived in.  So they came to us a couple of years ago.  And a prior developer 
attempted to put in a couple of hundred units, and we were successful in blocking that.  And he 
sold off to the present developer who was going to put in close to two hundred units.  And we 
met with him over months, and he lowered the scope of his project down to 136 units.  So the 
residents are still concerned over different life, quality of life issues.  So we've been meeting with
them, and meeting with the city counselors and the developer, you know, getting the three sides 
together.  And tomorrow night it's just a follow-up meeting of one we had a city hall.  
M:  How many people go usually?  
W:  We don't get that many, because generally issues that affect one section of Centraville doesn't
affect the other.  So just those that feel they have an interest would come.  But tomorrow night 
we're talking about the Condominiums, you now, traffic, fire protection, things like that.  
D:  Walter generally tries to make it, so.  (W & M:  Yeah)  And there will be members of the city 
counsel there who are on the sub committee for neighborhoods.  
M:  Oh, okay.
W:  They should be there.
M:  Is it a political, would you call it a political organization?  
W:  Well I wouldn't call it a political organization.  It's an organization that uses political clout, 
but we're not constantly doing political things.  Um, I'm president of the organization and I'm 
running for the City Council.  It just happens to work out that way.  And a couple of the people 
that are members want to make sure that I don't use the organization in a political way to become
elected to the City Council.  They want the organization divorced from politics.  But they, the 
organization uses it's clout, meaning three or four hundred members, to try and get the City 
Councilors to be responsive to our needs.  It's a good organization.  We've done a lot of good 
things.  We've blocked a lot of development coming into the area.  And you know, buildings that 
were being converted into multi-family buildings, or city owned land that will be sold off to 
developers we're able to block.  We blocked the closing of one of the fire houses in Centraville.  
You know, things like that.  We haven't always been successful, and we haven't always lost our 
fights, but yeah, we've in there fighting all the time.  
M:  I have one last kind of issue to ask you about, and that is about this redevelopment, or 
development downtown.  As Lowell is becoming a place that's being presented to the tourists, to 
outsiders and to itself, what would be your recommendations for what should be preserved about 
Lowell?
W:  I don't know.  I think anything that could be preserved about Lowell has, with the exception 
of it's educational system.  I don't think they've done that much to bring out the influence that 
education has had on the Industrial Revolution in the United States.  The role that education 
played in Lowell um, I think they've gone after the glory things, you know, the mills, and the 
living conditions in the mills at that time, and the working conditions.  But education was a very 
powerful force in Lowell.  I don't know this for a fact, but I believe Lowell High School was one 
of the first co-educational public school systems in the United States.  Doctor Edison, Edson 
rather, the Rector at Saint Anne's Church was very influential in creating the early education 
systems
in Lowell.  And I think the National Park Service, and the State Park Program is overlooked 
where the role of education is played in the development of the Industrial Revolution.  So I'd like
to see that brought out.  I think they, the National Park People have gone after the fast tourist 
buck, not that they're charging the people, but they've gone after the fast thing that would satisfy 
them when they come into Lowell for three hours and then they leave.  I'd like to see a program 
created that would keep the tourist here for a couple of days, instead of just coming in from 
[unclear], New Jersey for three hours and leaving, and going back to Boston, or Concord.  I'd 
like to see them stay for an extended period of time.  
D:  But this will be answered when the Paul Tsongas Industrial History Center opens?
W:  Um, in which way?
D:  I have been on the search committee of that building.  And that was the former Boott Mills 
that the National Park Service has purchased.  And they are going to have an educational 
component.  And on the first floor they will have 96 working looms.  They will have a library.  
They will have classrooms.  They will have teachers who can go on sabbaticals and stay there.  
Um, they will have all kinds of programs for the children.  Eventually perhaps they might even 
have overnights for different classrooms.  Um, and this will, this is schedule to open in 
September of '88.   So they are really addressing that problem.  In the fourth grade, because the 
fourth grade for some reason they've decided fourth grade is the place to do it, as far as our 
Social Studies curriculum, part of it does deal with the history of Lowell.  And the National Park 
Service does go into each fourth grade classroom and presents what they call a Lile Program.  
Now the initials um, it's Lile, and I know the last two are Learning Experience.  
M:  Lowell Industrial Learning Experience?
D:  Lowell Industrial Learning Experience.
M:  I'm just guessing it. 
D:  Yeah.  Okay.  And it's in two parts.  The first part presents what the mills girls were like when
they lived on their respective farms.  And then the second part of it is when they came into 
Lowell and started working in the mills.  They dressed the children up in period costumes, uh, 
one boy and one girl in each classroom, just to show them the type of clothing that they had.  
They also bring in small looms, and the children work four to a loom.  And give them a little 
experience and a little knowledge as to what the loom was like, and how it actually did make 
cloth.  So they are doing that part through the National Park.  
M:  I didn't know they had so many outreach programs. 
D:  Yes, and they do cover every fourth grade in Lowell.  And Chelmsford does use it extensively
also.  The other communities around don't get the opportunity, because of lack of time.  These 
programs, well the Lile runs all through the season, but then in May is when they start their boat 
and canal tour.  And um, they're very very booked.  So a lot of the communities in the area do not
get the opportunity to use the facilities.  
M:  Do you think people in the town are involved in this development, these exhibits down 
town?  
D:  Not so much right now, but with (--)
