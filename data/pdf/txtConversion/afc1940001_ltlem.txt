Page 1. [28E - A1?] [Troy?] [??] [1939?] THE LITTLE MOHEE. As I was out walking for pleasure one day,
In lovely creation all care drove away As I sat amusing myself on the grass, There stepped up to me
a young Indian lass I sat down beside her, took hold of my hand Saying, you look like a stranger,
not one of this land And if you will follow, you're welcome to come For ? in my snug little home. The
sun was just setting upon the South Sea As I wandered along with my pretty Mohee. Together we
wandered, together we roved 'Til we came to the hut in the cocinut grove There fondly expression
she made unto me Saying, if you're contented to live here with me You no more shall go roving
upon the South Sea For I'll teach you the language of the Isle of Mohee. No, no, my dear girl, that
\ never can be I have a sweet girl in my own countery ; She's neat, tall and handsome, she's light
and she's free , And I'd never desert her for her own poverty[.?] The last time I saw her 'twas down
by the strand. As the boat did pass by her, she [ waved wav'ed ?] her hand Saying, when you get
home to the girl that you love Just think of the lass of the cocinut grove. And now I am safe landed on
the home ? native shore My friends and relations gather round me once more THE LITTLE MOHEE.
There's none that comes round me, there's no one I see That will ever compare with the lass of
Mohee.
That's all. S. R.: Where did you learn it? W. D.: I learned it [md] I guess at my mother's knee. S. R.:
Where was that? Where abouts? W. D.: That was in Moscow, Ohio [md] 70 years ago. S. R.: Oh,
that was a long time ago[!?] W. D.: Yea, my mother sang that when she was a girl. There's another
companion story that goes to it. Not companion [md] but in my mind I associate the two together.
