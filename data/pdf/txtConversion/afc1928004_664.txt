Oh! Aint He got a 
Nose. 
Presented by BONNIE RUNNELLS to MAJ. E. 
NEWELL, and sung with 
great success. 
Oh good evening, pay attention, 
And I 
will relate my woes; 
I 
must succeed in making friends, 
Instead of making foes. 
Gaze on a 
wretched mortal, 
Who, no matter where be goes, 
But what some one is sure to cry, 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose. 
CHORUS: 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose, 
What a 
nose, such a 
nose, 
Won't it be ugly 
When it older grows. 
For the people all do cry 
Whenever I 
pass by, 
hoist an umbrella over his nose, 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose. 
Now it really is too bad, 
That I 
was born with such a 
curse; 
And at two minutes old, 
it was discovered by my ntuse. 
My eyes were like my daddy's, 
They swere startled I 
suppose, 
When she dropped me on the floor, and cried 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose. ( Chorus) 
And when older grew I 
thought 
I'd settle down in life, 
I 
thought the best thing I 
could do 
It was to take a 
wife. 
I 
popped the question blushingly, 
As red as any rose; 
When she looked up in my face, and said 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose, ( Chorus) 
As sung with great success by MAJ. E. 
NEWELL all over the world. 
Since the days when I 
was a 
little child, 
I 
heard my mother say, 
There was nothing that ever could keep me still 
By night or yet by day; 
I'm a 
man grown up but 'tis all the sam3, 
For do what e'er I 
will, 
'Tis a 
fact that whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't sit still. - 
CHORUS: 
I 
really can't keep still, 
I 
really can't keep still, 
'Tis a 
fact that whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't keep still. 
As a 
witness once I 
went to court, 
The Judge, said sir, be still, 
Very well I 
said if its against your rules 
Your Honor I 
said I 
will; 
I 
judg'd away, and at last the Judge, 
Police and Jury all, 
Took a 
leap and then began to dance 
As though at some grand ball. 
Then I 
loved a 
girl who had lots of cash, 
I 
told my love one day, 
Tho I'm blest if I 
could keep still at all 
Through what I 
had to say; 
Then I 
asked her if she would marry me, 
And she said yes I 
will; 
But I 
beg you won't jig away like that, 
I 
said I 
can't keep still. 
At last we went to church one morn, 
And strange enough to say, 
I 
felt as though I 
could do the job 
ID 
a 
quiet sort of way; 
The Parson came to the solemn part, 
And said you two are one— 
I 
took hold of Jane and the Parson's hand, 
And jigged away like fun. 
We have children now, and I'm bound to say 
They are a 
handsome lot; 
They can't keep still, and my wife she says 
It's my complaint they've got; 
But my wife she's got it as well as I, 
And so when we go out, 
The people stare and think we've gone mad, 
To see us dance about. 
Sung by MAJ. NEWELL. Champion Skatorial Artist. 
Of pleasures in this world there are but very few we take, 
And what I'm going to speak about is skating on the lake, 
Where lots of nice young men are seen with ladies whom 
they take 
To pass the evening quietly and have a 
pleasant skate. 
CHORrs : 
Oh, yes, skating on the lake, yes, skating on the lake, 
When the music plays on gala days while skating on the 
lake, 
Yes, skating on the lake. yes, skating on the lake, 
What jolly turns we all can make, while skating on the lake. 
One afternoon, all by myself, a 
stroll I 
chanced to take, 
And meeting with a 
friend of mine we started for a 
skate; 
We readied the Park where we a 
good long hour had to 
wait 
Before we could get through the crowd that were skating 
on the lake. 
jChorus. 
We fixed  our skates upon our feet and thought it would 
be nice 
To start right off and have the treat of skating on the ice. 
I 
had not started quite before I 
fell down once or twice. 
And thought that skating on the lake was not so very nice. 
[Chorus.] 
MAJ. E. 
NEWELL'S Great Parlor-
Skate Song and Dance. 
The Skating season has arrived, 
The best of all for me; 
The Ball is up at Central Park, 
Where I 
much like to be. 
The ponds where on in Summer time, 
I 
fondly love to row, 
Are covered with an icy crust, 
And glittering in the snow. 
Chorus :—The Ball is up at Central Park, 
The signal I 
am waiting, 
For there is nothing half so nice, 
As going there a 
skating. 
Oh! don't the young chaps gaze at you, 
And lift their caps polite; 
'When like a 
flash of lightning you 
Pass them both left and right. 
Ah! what a 
dear, they all remark, 
But you don't seem to hear 
Those words of admiration said, 
And pass theni like a 
deer. 
There now ensues a 
regular spurt, 
Sonic young chaps try a 
race; 
And follow closely in my tracks, 
Commencing. thus the chase. 
The circle round me dash away, 
And show their skill to me; 
But I 
pretend to look away, 
While all their feats I 
see. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus). 
And when you're tired, and want to go. 
Some young chap is at hand. 
Who will politely ask your leave 
rpon his knees to bend. 
He takes a 
hold of feet and skates. 
And straps them on the ice; 
You thank him with a 
gracious smile, 
Oh isn't it gay and nice. (( ' horns).

I

O'HALLERAN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN, 
A 
new a 
original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, 
in his new and original sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is O'Halleran, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro. 
The blaclguards they see me, arrah. from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well VIII a 
brave policeman, 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street, 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up, and- my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'Halleran, 
lie's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman. 
For as I 
promenade, & c. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, 
do everything I 
can, 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I 
promenade, Sc.

Sung with immense 
success by the great " _Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN. 
We're a 
pair of ould Irish junkmen, 
We buy up what e're we can find, 
We work hard at our occupation, 
In picking up junk of all kind. 
From the dear ould green land of shamrock 
A 
few years ago we came out, 
As partners we started this business, 
And from morning ' till night we do shout— 
CHORUS. 
Any old rags, 
(Symph.) 
Any old bottles, (Symph.) 
Any old rags to put in our bags, 
Have ye any old rags or bottles to- day. 
When we landed with only two shillings, 
We was told by a 
loafer named Burke 
To go to a 
Bladder refinery, 
And the boss he would put us to work. 
Faith we soon found out all their queer tricks, 
There jokes. their stalls and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Any old rags, Jtc. 
Now before we leave we must tell you 
That we love to deal honestly. 
So if ye have old rags or bottles, 
We'll come buy them all do you see; 
For all kinds of rags whatsoever, 
We'll pay the best price that is out, 
We'll come with our cow-bells a 
ringing, 
And at the top of our voice we will shout--
Any old rags, ie.

FIFTH AVENUE GEORGE, 
Written by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLET. 
Sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, in their great character sketch, 
"The Swells," written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Music and words published by E. 
H. HARDING, 229 Bowery* 
Fifth Avenue George is a 
charmer, 
And every dear creature will swear, 
Of fashion he's always the leader, 
No gent with his style can compare. 
Ile leads an existence of pleasure, 
While blest with a 
fortune so large; 
And every one gives the opinion, 
There's none like Fifth Avenue George. 
CHORUS. 
Fifth Avenue George, Fifth Avenue George, 
Upon him the girls fondly smile. 
For fun and good cheer to the boys he is dear, 
He's the leader of fashion and style. 
He wears a " Knox" hat made to order, 
And his diamond can vie with the sun: 
A 
gold-headed cane he keeps twirling 
As a 
swell he is " A No. 11 , 
He can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Borne; 
In ev'ry grand parlor or ball-room, 
Fifth Avenue George is at home. 
Fifth Avenue, etc 
He thinks every business is vulgar, 
He can't comprehend the hard timczi; 
His manner is very romantic, 
And he talks about poets and rhymes. 
He plays " philopene" with the ladies, 
And flirts with the belles all Around; 
Each day on Broadway promenading, 
Filth Avenue George can be found.

OFF YOUR NUT.* 
Written and composed by Sam DEvasE. 
AS bye-words now are all the go, I'm going to give you one, 
It's used by all, both large and small, you'll hear it on every

An urchin hails you in the street with " Mister, shine 'em up V'

A 
carriage, a 
carriage, a 
hackman cries, till his faoe gets awful 
red, 
ile's anxious to make a 
dollar or two before he goes to bed; 
You ask him to drive you around the town and land you right 
side up, 
He winks his eye at his pal. so sly, saying " That roster is off 
his nut." 
There's your German tailor too,

What would we do without the

If on the street you chance to meet a 
friend who has been on a

His hat smashed in, his head swelled up, a 
real old " jam-

His clothes are soiled, he's got the shakes, perhaps he's bruised 
and cut,

The Poor Serio-Comio. 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with t 'eat 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," " You've children of your own, 
admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who tol d 
her she was charming and neat, 
V. 
THE POOR SERIO-COMIC.—Continued. 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more, 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if ywt can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug ber with Wicks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
NoN.,: these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except uresses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'nfsure that's enougt and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
man's 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back.

THE PULPIT, THE PRESS, AND THE STAGE.

THE PULPIT, THE PRESS & THE STAGE 
Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALI,Y PRICE MOTTO SINGER, 
• 
0 :--
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my strange argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper ball keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the world move. 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one. 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong, 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, the Infidel, no matter what. 
The wicked, good. weak and strong, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
CONTINUED. 
Next conies- the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire; 
It tells us the doings of every hour, 
And of all events as they transpire. 
it 
reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved t 
he world, 
And brought us from darkness to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
'Tis both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow less. 
So the Stave moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press. 
In one how ' twill portray a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage.

Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a

She's my pretty love, she's may turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And- she's just sweet sixteen.

Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (yni.),

She's a

She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a

And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. . 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
is this lay pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
Sweet vision of my dream.

'My Mary Anne's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a 
drame ; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a

Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a gamblin man, poker or 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro,

Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mau Anne. _

THERE'S DANGER ON THE LINES 
As sung with great success in Loudon, England, 
By Miss ELLA W ESNER. 
If we'd but look ahead, in journeying through life, 
What accidents by flood and field, ' twould save us in the 
strife ; 
The Railway has its signal lights, and so in life have we, 
They only want attention, and no danger there would be. 
CHORUS. 
leor the white light, all right, go ahead in safety, 
The green lights seen right, will caution us in time : 
But the red light, shown bright, brings us up right hasty, 
For when they show the red we know there's danger on the 
line. 
For instance, look at courtship now, a 
road you'd think 
well known; 
The warnings placed along this line, are pretty plainly 
shown; 
But folkE rush past the junction, and with blindness to 
their fate • 
Ige'er stopping till they're past the points, and then of 
course too late. 
For the white light, &c. 
For matrimonial signals, then, we hav'nt far to gaze, 
The warnings are in plenty shown and strike us with amaze, 
Tin safety light along this branch, I'm sorry seldom shows. 
Then look well to your coupling, boys, ere each the jour-
ney 3oes. 
For the white light, &c. 
Then push along through life my boys, but heed well what 
I 
say; 
Don't pass or snub the cautions, that you meet with by the 
way; 
And if you'd safely reach the end, just keep yourself awake, 
*toad when you find there's something wrong, then quickly 
ply the tweak.

There's a 
Sweet Face at- the Window. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
And it's looking o'er at me, 
Till its glances soft and loving 
Fills my soul with eestacy, 
And its pretty eyes are blending 
Like the moon- lit sky when blue 
With its radiance transcending 
Like the rainbow's lovely hue. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
See it glancing through the pane. 
And my heart is sadly waiting 
Till I 
see it once again. 
There is music softly flowing 
From those sweet lips thro' the air 
And my heart with love is glowing 
For that sweet face over there, 
And its melody is sounding, 
Till I 
feel its joyous thrill, 
And my spirit quickly bounding 
To its music sweet and still. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
Yes, your eyes of dark blue flashing, 
Sends me feeling so divine, 
You who are so handsome, dashing, 
That I 
love to call you mine; 
And your sweet face at the window, 
How it haunts me in my dreams! 
Then how sad when I 
awaken 
Finding life not what it seems. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
'Tis your sweet face at the window 
That is ever in my view, 
And it fills me o'er with gladness, 
For my thoughts are all for you; 
Yes, my thoughts are always flying 
To the one I 
love so dear, 
And my heart is sadly sighing 
For that sweet face over there. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc,

Yes, we'll Write you aLetter fromHome. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To tell how we're longing to hear 
The footsteps that nevermore come, 
The voice that to us was so dear 
For, oh you are still, still the same, 
Through dark raging seas may divide; 
We sigh, when we hear your dear name. 
To welcome you back to our side. 
CHORUS. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
We dream of you, darling, each night. 
We love you wherever you roam, 
We'll kiss every word that we write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home., 
To bear you our love o'er the sea. 
To gladden your heart as you roam, 
And cheer you wherever you be. 
'Tis lonely while you are away; 
For sweet was the joy that you gave! 
Oh sadly we pine while you stray; 
Vome back o' 
e 
lone weary wave!

Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNET. 
There's many pleasures in this life, 
But none that can compare,

Bells on bob-tail ring.

A

Jingk behs, jingle, bells, jingle all the way, 
Oh, wi_at joy it is to ride in a

That I

I 
found myself soon seated, 
With Fanny by my side. 
The sleigh bells they did jingle, 
The horse did snort and blow, 
And off we started sleighing, 
Upon the crested snow, . 
Jingle, bells, &c. 
We started soon for home, 
A-singing that same old song. 
Oh ! don't you see them little bays 
A-trotting right along? 
They ,gayly prance and skip. 
And know it's all ri ,
_rht. 
For they have got all through their work. 
And bound for home to- night. 
Jingle, bells, 
Written and sung by WILLIAM SCANLAN. 
OuId Ireland is our native home, 
The land where we were born, 
And of it we are proud our friends, 
And we ne'er our country scorn. 
'Twas there our poor ould parents died 
Not many years ago, 
And ever since that time we had 
To wander to and fro. 
CHORUS. 
From our ould Irish home, 
Our ould Irish home, 
The land of our birth, 
Where strangers may roam. 
Re/eat. 
There's not an Irishman to-day, 
But would fight with all his might, 
To see his dear ould country free, 
And illume up grand ai:d. bright. 
With the flag of freedom waving high 
O'er Ireland s 
beauteous home, 
Arrah, then our hearts would beat with joy, 
And we never more would roam. 
From our ould Irish home, &c. 
How I 
long to see the day arrive, 
When we shall take our stand, 
Beneath that green immortal flag, 
And fight for mother's land; 
To strike ! to strike that wished for blow, 
And break that cruel chain, 
That holds our own dear mother's isle 
In bondage, grief and pain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
our ould Irish home, 
Our ould Irish home, 
The land of our birth, 
Where strangers may roam.

Widow Dunn (Parody), 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A making beds for horses that are sick, 
Site's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's front the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey. 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, T. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
WIDOW DUNN (PAR(ny). —CONTINUED. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neckson of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She tires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, site is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn.

Here we are two scrubbing women, 
At this trade we make our living, 
Working hard the livelong day, 
For our rent and debts to pay. 
Our husbands, they were both of them brothers, 
From old Ireland they ran, 
Carrying the hod was their daily labor, 
Pat and Dan Gilhoolihan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, please to take pity, 
(Symph.) 
While we sing our sorrowful ditty, 
(Symph.) 
We're washing, scrubbing and singing all day, 
• And Tinding our children our time goes away. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Now we hope ye'll all have pity 
On us poor widders from the old sod, 
We can't find a 
job in the whole city, 
And to starve, by the powers now that's no cod, 
Here we've been these last five years, s:rs, 
Left with children big and strong, 
I 
have three—and I 
have four, sirs, 
And there all of them happy as the day is long. 
Oh, please to, kc.,

THERE'S ALWAYS A 
SEAT IN THE PAR-
LOR FOR YOU. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by the great 
SCANLAN & CRONIN. 
Music published by F. W . 
HELMICK, 
No. 50 Fourth Street, Cincinnatti, Ohio. 
The subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you provot:, untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share; 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN.—I 
explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
CHORI.JS• 
There's always a seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter hew many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last wee, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said wkat do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was 
43 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
6POICEN.—Yes; I 
shall haunt her day and night if its only to 
)ear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair.

Tell de Folks I'm Coming Home. 
Written expressly for EMILE ANIES by BEN D ODGE. 
Darkies, my old heart am weary, 
'Wandering from you far away, 
But I 
know I'll soon feel cheery, 
For I'se coming home to-day. 
Give me back de ole plantation, 
Never more from it I'll roam, 
Naught so dear in all creation— 
Tell de folks I'm ccming home. 
CHORUS. 
I'se a 
coming, yes a 
coming, 
Never more from you to roam; 
All around de ole plantation. 
Tell de folks I'm coming home. 
Do de sweet magnolias blossom 
Round my little cabin door ? 
Do de darkies hunt de possum 
As dey did in days ob yore ? 
Never more from you I'll wander, 
Never far away to roam ; 
Take dis message ober yonder: 
Tell de folks I'm coming home. 
I'se a 
coming, &c.

WHIST I 
WHIST I 
As sung by LESTER & Wmuems. 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
CHORIM: 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark. 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist: 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get. 
Yellow Clarionette. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
I'll sing to you some woes of mine, 
About a 
gal so fair, 
With a 
hump-backed bunion on her nose, 
And brick bat colored hair. 
loved her as I 
love my life, 
And she was gay you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarionette. 
CrIORUS. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke Italian Dutch, 
And every time I 
caught him there, 
You bet I 
made him dust, dust, dust. 
He played for her night and day, 
And murdered Old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold, 
He told her of his bully home 
And of his wealth untold. 
Re played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat, 
He Mowed the brains out of his head, 
And spoilt his Sunday cravat. 
YELLOW CLARIONETTE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turned her head, 
lie asked her if she'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to death, 
With a 
whortleberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And I 
tried to cut my throat, 
I 
went alone to a 
beer saloon 
For a 
wooden overcoat. 
I 
saw the gal last week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a 
K 
flat clarionette, 
With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says old man don't fret, 
I've got two boys you bet, 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a 
yellow clarionette.

Flirting in the Moonlight. 
String Clam Jimmy. 
1114 «Is by T. F. CASEY, music by CHARLES JEROME, and sung with great 
success by ELLA JEROME in the original sketch of" Comedy." 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
We pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear. 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, how happy we do be! ( SYm.) 
Yes, yes. full of mirthful glee! (Sytn.) 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June. 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a 
fairy dell. 
With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love to some one at the first sight, 
Down where the flowerets dwell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, how happy we do be ! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes, full of mirthful glee ! (Sym.) 
(Repeat four last lines of second verse.)

Written and sung with great success by NED TALBOT. 
AIR: " 
Champagne Charley." 
Some time ago there was a 
fig, 
Who used to go about, 
A screaming " Who'll buy my string clams, 
I 
feel so awful stout." 
This nig he was the size of a 
pig 
A 
feeding in the sty, 
And the only thing that happened him, 
He had a 
string clam eye. 
CHORUS, 
49 
Oh, String C,larri Jimmy was his name, 
His old woman never could make him tame, 
He'd roar with fright both day and night, 
For String Clam Jimmy was his name, ta ta. ( Repeat.) 
Now jimmy he fell in love o:ie day 
With a 
girl with cross-eyed feet; 
She said she would not let him go 
Until she'd cut his teeth. 
She busted his poor pocketbook, 
Which made him fell so son: 
She gave him the slip and split 
is lip, 
Then skipped right out the door. 
Oh, String Clam jimmy, & c. 
Dear Jimmy is contented now, 
He never goes about, 
He says bad times has spoiled the trade, 
Now don't that nigger shout. 
He feels so weak, he's got a 
cheek 
About three ton and a 
half, 
He looked so nice they put him on ice, 
Now how's that for a 
laugh 7

Mary Ann McLaughlin. 
Published by permission of GEO. M OLINEUX, Brooklyn, 
In a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said: 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house.

THE MODERN SWELL OF ERIN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Good evening, boys, you don't know me, 
As you've not seen me before; 
I'm a 
gentleman you all can tell, 
From Erin's lovely shore; 
So if you will just list to me, 
I'll make you understand; 
A 
few things that some here don't know, 
Of my own dear native land. 
CHORUS: 
Then for wit, good nature, 
Where's the men to beat those from our SoilT 
They're ever frisky, ever gay, 
And willing hard to toil; 
They'll shake a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
These are the sort of men you'll find. 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard you call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too; 
But we can dress in pomp and style, 
Ah! just as well as you; 
We've gained respect through all the world, 
And on every distant shore— 
They praise " O'Connell," " Goldsmith," 
And our late " Sir Thomas Moore." 
(Chorus). 
THE "MODERN SW ELL " 
OF ERIN—CONTINUED. 
There's bad and good in every clime, 
That each of us well know; 
But still, to class all men alike, 
'Tis wrong you should do so; 
Is there a 
flock that hasn't got 
A black sheep, tell me that? 
Then take my tip, you'll find worse friends 
Than those you call poor Pat. 
I 
hope that with my little song, 
I've offended none of you; 
But always bear this in your mind, 
As this world you travel through— 
That man is man, and who is more, 
No matter what he be; 
Pat is flesh and blood, as well as you, 
Then why not, 
4l 1, 
agree? 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus).

THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success in HARRIGAN & HART'S 
New Play, 
Mulligan Guards' Nominee," 
Theatre Comique, N. V. 
Now once there was a 
maid kept an old magpie, 
And a 
parson who prayed lived very close by; 
When this maid met the parson they both stopped to talk. 
And often on the quiet go for a 
cosy walk; 
But her lover was a 
sailor who sailed across the main, 
And he promised she should be his wife when he returned 
again; 
Still she let this parson see her home from church. 
And kiss her, never thinking of the magpie on the perch. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie would talk all the day, 
The maid would believe all the magpie would say: 
She said I 
love the parson, don't you tell the tar. 
When the old magpie only said " guar! guar!" 
Now, whilst this sailor was away, so the story goes, 
This maid flirts with the parson, but, of course, nobody 
knows; 
Until she tells the magpie when talking one day, 
She'd rather have the parson now the sailor was away; 
But she said don't tell this secret, or I'll give you the birch 
Every night at nine, I 
meet the parson near the church; 
The magpie only guar, quar'd as he had done before, 
But he meant to tell the sailor boy when he returned on 
shore. 
(Chorus). 
4 
55 
THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE.—CONTINUED. 
-Whilst stationed at Gibraltar, this sailor, so it seems, 
When sleeping in his cosy bunk, he had some funny dreams; 
Ie dreamt the girl he'd left behind on dear old England's 
shore, 
Would, whilst he was away, flirt with half a 
dozen more; 
So he made his passage homeward as quickly as could be, 
Landed safely at her house, but no maiden could he see; 
He then talked to the magpie who was dancing on the perch, 
ud the magpie told him all about the parson at the church. 
(Chorus). 
Y.ow when the sailor met the maiden, he passed her with 
disdain, 
So she sued for breach of promise, tried five hundred to 
obtain; . 
But he brought the magpie into court, which told the 
truthful tale, 
So to get what she required, this maiden did fail; 
She then went for the parson, but in vain for him did 
search, 
For he knew which way the wind blew, so he hooked it 
from the church; 
The lawyers couldn't find him, so the ease went on the 
shelf, 
And this tricky little maiden had to live by herself. 
CHoRus: 
The maid and the magpie ne'er talk all the day, 
For the jolly little sailor took the knowing bird away; 
And now with all his shipmates, this rare good hearted tar, 
While the magpie tells the truthful tale, he sings " quar: 
guar:"

OUR FRONT STOOP.

"Sullivan's Christmas."

Hart. 
Music published by Wm. 
Pond, 547 Broadway, New York. 
Pm the father of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat wculd make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
Thero's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
.'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man mo, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
G-erman music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop. 
You'd haA to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have yozir family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they zit there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you'll hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good rtighs, 
And go home from our front stoop.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNtsm, expressly for M URPHY and 
M.mca. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
he'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun, 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole n. cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack,

THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent---
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Topic a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
lie took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
W-mt tc the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The . an that stole the country

The Men That We Ought -to Avoid. 
A man is oft known by the friends that he keeps, 
or birth of a 
feather we find, 
Will oft flock together—and so to the fact, 
It is right we should never be blind 
how many a 
hope of advancement in life, 
Has been by false friendship destroyed; 
So it cannot be wrong to name in my song, 
Some men you ought to avoid. 
CHORUS. 
Some sham to be gold, but with plenty of brass, 
You'll very soon find them alloyed, 
A man who seems this, and proves to be that, 
Is a 
man you ought to avoid. 
There are men who will borrow at every chance, 
Whom 'twere better at once to offend, 
But the danger is worse in knowing a 
man, 
Whose business is ever to lend; 
He has interest in you and from you as well, 
And e'en if of cash you're devoid, 
Your uncle who hangs out the three golden balls 
Is a 
man that you ought to avoid. 
A lawyer who runs up his six-and-eight fees,. 
A drunkard with unsteady gait, . 
A braggart whose talk is all hill of bombast, 
As of wisdom is empty his pate; 
A 
liar whose word is a 
pitfall and snare, 
A parson whose time is employed 
Informing on crimes for the sake of the fines, 
These are men that we ought to avoid. 
The egotist praising his own paltry deeds, 
Who'll of nothing but self ever speak, 
The smooth, fawning, oil talking, cat sort of max 
The tale-bearing, tit-tattle sneak; 
These all are the pests of our snug little isle, 
By which we are oftimes annoyed, 
Like sharks in the sea or flies in your tea. 
They are things that you ought to avoid.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age, 
DIMPVL 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
U is a Pao simile of a Trick practiced by ceti 
the Professors of Magic. , 
• 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic °rat 
has been sent us, called HUMPITY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear. 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly.over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand.,,
