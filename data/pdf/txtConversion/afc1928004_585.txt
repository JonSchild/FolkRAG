THE IRISH BRIGADE. 
Written, composed and sung with great success, by HARRY 
W HALING. at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Now don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing me here, 
I'm a gem of the very first water; 
My appearance will show I'm a 
gentleman, too, 
I'm a 
son of a Marquis's daughter; 
My Mother, God bless her! she doted on me, 
Said of danger I 
ne'er was afraid; 
So when I 
grew to manh000d, a commission I 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
Chorus—Then hurrah, hurrah, for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers are never afraid; 
They're true to the core, and in death ever daring, 
I'm Colonel Shea of the Irish Brigade. 
The Irish Brigade is a 
corps true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land; 
In peace they're true-hearted, cheerful and gay, 
While in battle like lions will stand; 
And I 
am their leader, and proud to say, 
My soldiers all dote upon me; 
For oft midst the roar of the cannon they shout, 
"Give a 
cheer, boys, for brave Colonel Shea."— Chorue. 
To the roll of the drum they march gaily on, 
Through the fields, midst the dead and the dying; 
And high in the air, through the smoke can be seen, 
The Green Flag nobly flying; 
And there it waves proudly, amid shot and shell, 
While my men to the charge they are led. 
And they'll fght till they die, ere an inch they will 
In defence of the flag o'er their head. 
Chorus. 
Then boys, give a cheer for the sons of our Isle, 
In gallantry, none them excel; 
For their rights and their country they've oft led the way 
And like soldiers have nobly loll; 
Theg've fought and they've conquered their foes o'er and 
o'er, 
In foreign lands over the sea; 
And they'd try hard again, would my stout-hearted men 
If called on by brave Colonel Shea..

WARRIOR BORN SONS OF ERIN. 
Written and composed by HARRY W HALING, Vocal Comedian am 
Author, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, N. 
Y. 
-: 
0:-
Of the Great men of Ireland, I've often sung, 
And boasted her soldiers in war; 
But I'll now change the subject, and raise here to-night. 
The warrior born true Irish Tar; 
No nation in this world more sturdier Jacks 
Ever had than the boys from our land; 
For in foul or in fair, when wanted they're there, 
At their post, boys, they ever will stand. 
CHORUS: 
Able and willing to do and die, 
Ever there when wanted, never known to fly; 
To uphold their Country's honor against the world 
you may rely, 
Will the Warrior born Sons of Erin. 
Though blue are the clothes in which I now dress, 
The green shamrock's dearest to me; 
And the man too must fight, who before me dare slight, 
That dear little Isle in the sea; 
'Tis the land I 
was born in, and though far away, 
If on me she ever should call; 
For my Country's good in warfare I 
should, 
Be prepared lads to conquer or fall. 
(Chorus). 
The old Union Jack knows an Irishman's worth, • 
For he's oft proved her best friend at sea; 
While the brave stars and stripes, gladly gives him a 
birt h, 
And a 
home in the laud of the free; 
There's Irish descent in the Fleet of proud France, 
In fact I 
should like to know where 
Is the Country can show better seamen than Pat, 
Or whose Sons can do more than we dare, 
# SINGLE ONCE MORE.

Written, composed and sung by HARRY W HALING with great success 
I've seen men like wolves tight for women, and swear, 
That they could die for their love ; 
Well, I've got a 
charming young damsel, my friends, 
Whose proper place should be above; 
At least, since we're married, which is only six months, 
I've thought so, alas, to my grief ; 
For if I 
could be single, to girl I 
would go, 
And think it a 
happy relief. 
Chorus-0, if I 
could be single once more, 
If I 
could be single once more ; 
I'd live on my means, make infernal machines, , 
If I 
could be single once more. 
There's not such a 
woman for kindness, she says, 
If I 
was to search the world round ; 
And if I 
speak she proves it, with the poker she knocks, 
This poor victim on to the ground ; 
She's a 
virtuous women, I 
will speak the truth, 
And virtue requires no more ; 
'Twas only last night I 
caught her embraced 
In the arms of a 
lodger next door. 
Chorus. 
She's asked me to leave her, she's too good, I 
can't, 
The thought of it, friends, makes me weep ; 
But it's not for the leaving for which I 
now grieve, 
'Tis the fact that I'd have her to keep ; 
Still, if she was to die, I 
should really go mad, 
For with me 'twould be a 
hard rub ; 
You see I've no money to bury her with, 
And she's not paid up in the club. 
Chorus. 
My sweet little angel awaits me at home, 
With a 
smile for me when I 
land; 
And I'll bet ten to one that when I 
arrive, 
She's that drunk she's scarce able to stand ; 
If she is, mercy help me, she makes the pots fly, 
And chases me all round the room; 
And when she lays hold of me, doesn't she whack 
My skull with the poker or broom! 
Chorus, 
• 
OFF THE WHEEL. 
Written, Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING, Author and 
Comedian, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. Broadway, N. Y., 
with great success. 
Behold a 
man reduced in life, 
Though strange to me it seems; 
For in this world of rich and poor, 
I've seen the two extremes; 
I 
once was gay and happy, 
Through life jogged merrily along; 
My woes I'm sure you'll pity, 
When you've heard my little song. 
Cnonos: 
As the lark sings high up in the sky, 
As the sun shines forth its rays; 
I 
think of home and friends so dear, 
I 
had in better days; 
But now I'm sad and lonely, 
The pangs of hunger feel, 
Dame fortune's turned the scale on me, 
I'm now, friends, " Off the -Wheel." 
When blessed with peace and plenty, 
And a 
loving wife to cheer; 
I 
from my home with friends did roam, 
And nothing did I 
fear; 
I 
spent my money foolishly, 
Mv race I 
ran too fast; 
But poverty overtook me, 
And I'm " Off the Wheel " at last. 
(Chorus). 
OFF THE WHEEL—CONTINUED. 
My wife quite broken hearted, 
Was driven from her home; 
Cold, hungry and dejected, 
We side by side did roam; 
But death, alas! soon laid her low, 
Which drove me to despair; 
I've nothing now to live for, 
How I 
long her lot to share. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
To some distant spot I'll creep; 
And there concealed by darkness, 
On the cold, damp ground Ill sleep; 
For better days to-morrow, 
I 
fervently do pray; 
Or from this world of sorrow, 
Death will summon me away. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus). 
Written, Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Good evening, boys, you don't know me, 
As you've not seen me before: 
I'm a 
gentleman you all can tell, 
From Erin's lovely shore; 
So if you will justlist to me, 
I'll make you understand; 
A 
few things that some here don't know, 
Of my own dear native land. 
ClIORIIS: 
Then for wit, good nature, 
Where's the men to beat those from our Soil? 
They're ever frisky, ever gay. 
And willing hard to toil; 
They'll shake a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
These are the sort of men you'll rind. 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard you call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too; 
But, we can dress in pomp and style, 
Alt! just as well as you; 
We've gained respect through all the world, 
And on every distant shore— 
They praise " O'Connell," " Goldsmith," 
And our late " Sir Thomas Moore." 
(Chorus). 
_THE " 
MODERN SWELL " 
OF ERIN— CONTINUED 
There's bad and good in every clime, 
That each of us well know; 
But still, to class all men alike, 
'Tis wrong you should do so; 
Is there a 
flock that hasn't got 
A black sheep, tell me that? 
Then take my tip, you'll find worse friends 
Than those you call poor Pat. 
I 
hope that with my little song, 
I've offended none of you; 
But always bear this in your mind, 
As this world you travel through— 
That man is man, and who is more, 
No matter what he be; 
Pat is flesh and blood, as well as you, 
Then why not all agree? 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus). 
Written and Sung by MR. HARRY W HALING with great success at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
if you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as it moves round, none of us can tell, 
How soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, when too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Choru--So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
if your wealthy why stretch out your hand to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-
off and great, 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old; 
had they but their time to live over again. 
They freely would give up their gold. 
Chorus. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard, 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in hea'f)s, 
And with it don't know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin, 
His family from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. - 
Chorus 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er, 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If to- day you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're eosey and warm and not out in the storm, 
And you see a 
friend naked and bare; 
Oh ne'er let him pas by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give him a 
share. 
Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING, Author, Comedian and 
Vocalist, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, Broadway, N.

I 
am a man of noble fame, 
Deny it no one can; 
I'm known throughout the whole, wide world, 
As the ninth part of a 
man; 
With needle and thread, and goose half red, 
I 
stitch and press all day; 
But when I've got some money, 
Then from work I 
slink away. 
Ctionos: 
Then as we're rolling in the street, 
Dead drunk and cannot see; 
Oh! Bobby! in thy mercy spare, 
Us Tailors on the spree. 
Each Saturday when we get paid, 
We to the public run; 
We Snips, we do the heavy, 
And drink whiskey just like fun; 
From morn till night we drink and fight, 
To see us is a 
treat; 
At closing time, the landlord throws 
Us all into the street. 
On Sundays we all stay at home, 
The cause you all can guess; 
Because we never like to show 
The style in which we dress; 
When Monday comes, then out we turn, 
And to the Pop Shop steer, 
And shove some swell's clothes up the spout, 
That we may get some beer.

TEETOOTAL IN THE MORNING. 
Written, composed and sung by HARRY WHALING, at TONY PASTOR'S 
THEATRE, New York. 
I'm one of those awful jolly dogs 
Who love to lounge all day, 
And come what will, or what folks preach, 
I'm sure to have my way. 
Some say that I've more brass than brains, 
Some truth in that may be ; 
I'm known throughout the country as 
The swell who loves a 
spree. 
CIIOR Us : 
Then come if you're coming, boys, out with me, 
Come if you're coming for a 
jolly good spree ; 
Then come if you're coming, to- night we'll merry be, 
We'll all be teetotal in the morning. 
Teetotal is my motto when 
My temperance friends I 
meet, 
To hear them praise me for being good 
It is a 
jolly treat ; 
But should they see me when I'm tight, 
And wish to give me warning, 
I 
say " Friend ,Toe, I'll promise you 
To be teetotal in the morning." ( Chorus). 
With lots of coin, why sit at home 
And mope both night and day; 
The song says, life is but a 
span— 
Be happy while ye may. 
A brimming glass, a 
pretty lass, 
Is what I 
love to see ; 
A 
jolly lark, boys, after dark 
Is just the thing for me. - (Chorus). 
Who's going to have a 
night with me, 
For I 
intend some fun, 
I'll stand for all both rich and poor, 
No man I'll ever shun. 
You can always share whate'er I've got; 
A 
penny or a 
pound, 
The money, so the proverb says, 
Is round and must go round. (Chorus). 
THE MODERN TRAMP. 
Written and composed by HARRY WHALING,Vocal Comedian and 
Author at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
You chaps that's been toiling and slaving all day, 
For a 
moment or two lend an ear; 
And gaze on a " Tramp" that's jolly hard up, 
And has not worked for many a 
year ; 
All sorts of games in this world I 
have tried, 
To get rich, you will please understaad; 
I've sold soap for pills, and salve to cure corns, 
And I 
once led a 
temperance band. 
Chorus—Then please not to smile, but list to my tale, 
With sorrow I'll pierce your he Ins through ;. 
Then assist if you can a 
poor tramp out of work; 
And doesn't want any to do. 
I've beat the big drum outside of a 
show, 
I 
next faiked the thimble and pea; 
But for that I 
got nailed, and got three months in jail, 
And of course that didn't suit me; 
I 
next stole a 
child; which I 
hugged in my arms. 
And for charity knocked at each door; 
And to soften their hearts I'd stick pins in the kid, 
Which made the dear baby to roar. 
Chorus. 
I 
soon found it out that game wouldn't pay, 
For the child could eat more than I 
got; 
So I 
turned it up and resolved on a 
plan, 
And blind beggar I 
tried like a 
shot; 
With a 
poodle and string and a 
card on my breast, 
Round every street I 
would jog; 
But because I'd no license a 
policeman came up, 
And quietly walked off with my dog. 
Chorus. 
It's.time to be going, I'm getting quite dry, 
And I 
haven't got price of a 
gill; 
So you that have got any " coin" to spare, 
Please bestow it upon Lazy Bill; 
There's an old woman coming I'll see if she'll give 
To a 
cripple that's bad with the cramp; 
A 
coin for my lodgings, I 
mean for a 
drink, 
For the workhouse just suits this old tramp. 
Chorus.

Here She Goes and There She Goes. 
Originally sung by EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan Fe Hart's Theatre Comique 
Broadway, N. Y. 
When Tom declared his ardent love for Miss Amelia Brown, 
They asked papa to give consent, but he only gave a 
frown; 
Now Tom and his Amelia said that they'd elope to town, 
And married be, although it was against the wish of Brown , 
The very morning of their flight, old Brown at home would stay, 
I 
know they only wished for some good chance to run away. 
SPOKEN—I 
knew the boy loved the girl, and the old man 
didn't love the girl worth a 
cent. 
The old man was a 
kind 
of sporting man, and so I 
says, Brown, old boy, I 
want to lay 
you a 
wager. 
What is it ? says Brown. I 
want to bet you 
five dollars you can't swing your arm with the pendulum of 
that clock five minutes. Done ! says he, I 
take the bet. What 
have I 
got to do ? 
All you have got to do is to follow me and 
go like this— 
CHORUS. 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
Bib-a-de-bob, bib-a-de-bob, 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
And that is the way to do it. 
Old Brown he set to work at once and soon began to puff, 
I 
cried old Brown, I 
think you'll soon say you've had enough; 
I 
never laid a 
bet, said he, but what I 
mean to win, 
I 
bet another ten, said he, that I 
will not give in. 
Continued. 
Old Brown was fat, the weather warm, and never once he 
stopped, 
And there upon his heated face there stood the shining drops. 
SPOKEN—And I 
stood in the corner laughing; and old 
Brown still kept up the same old game— 
Here she goes, & c. 
Mrs. Brown who heard me laugh, came into the room to see; 
Oh ! goodness gracious, Brown, said she, what can the mat-
ter be ? 
Why, Brown, you must be going mad, of that there is no doubt, 
To stand in front of that old clock and swing your arms about; 
I'll go 'and fetch the doctor, Brown, if you go on this way, 
But all they could get out of Brown, and this is what he'd 
say— 
Old Brown he won the wager, but lost his daughter by the 
game, 
She married Tom in town that day, and back for forgiveness 
came; 
'Twas useless when the job was done for Brown to then 
say nay, 
So he took the joke, my friends, in quite a 
jolly way ; 
He gave a 
party to his friends and oftimes tells with glee, 
While sounds of laughter echo from the jolly company. 
SPOKEN — Yes, 'says the old man, I 
shall never forget the 
time I 
went— 
Here she goes, & c. 
I 
Written and sung by Billy Barry, with great success. 
We sat on Blackwell's Island, Marie, 
It was far better than Sing Sing; 
You remember down at Geoghegan's, Marie, 
'We got two year's for stealing a 
watch and ring. 
We sat upon a 
beer keg, Marie, 
A 
policeman our breeches he did fan; 
it was a 
nice June morn in January, Marie, 
We were trying to work the racket with a 
can, 
We sat upon a 
church steeple, Marie, 
Nearly on the verge of ruin; 
We were eating freckled pies, seven miles just from 
the skies, 
And trying to mash the man lives in the moon. 
Written by JOHN 111cVmati. 
Sung with great success by M ISS KATE MONTROSE at 
Novelty Theatre, New York City, 
As you walk along the street, how often do you meet 
Some people who would preudly pass you by; 
And because they're better dressed, why do they you detest 
And with disdain upon you cast their eye? 
I 
here declare such actions are not right, 
But my friend's you know that dollars have their might; 
So let them have their way, and perhaps some future day, 
They may come out the losers in the end. 
'Twas but a 
day or two ago, while walking out quite, 
I 
saNy a 
beggar sitting in the street; 
As a 
rich man passed him by, he loud for alms did cry, 
But he spurned the beggar with his feet; 
I 
inquired his name and found it to be Brown, 
He'd got rich by bursting penny banks in town; 
And as I 
to the beggar went, and gave him my humble cent 
I 
thought Brown might be the loser in the end. 
One thing we can't erase, this life is but a 
race, 
In which each one tries to pass the other by; 
Some in riches take the lead, while others poor indeed, 
Can't get along no matter how they try; 
But to-night, my friends, the object of my song, 
Is to prove that right is greater far than wrong; 
And the man that robs the poor, and then drives him from 
his door, 
Must surely be the loser in the end.

You'll find You're the Winner in the End. 
Sang by NED BARRY at the THEATRE Comiquz, N. Y. 
Air—True as Steel. 
All this life is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, destruction, and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in away behind, but you'll very oft,en 
find, 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
But my advice to all my friends to-night, 
Although you're poor, look manly, stern and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's 
battle's fought, 
You'll find that you're the winner in the end. 
It was just eight years ago, on a 
night of storm and 
snow, 
When a 
beggar, thinly clad, stood on the street; 
A 
rich Banker passes by, but stopped at that sad cry, 
Of a 
penny, just to buy some bread to eat; 
Does he help him as he should, I 
ask of you, 
No! he scorns him just as rich men often do; 
And the beggar with a 
sigh, says my time is by-and-by 
And he'll find that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now the years have past and gone, and the subject of 
my song, 
I 
will prove, if you will listen for a 
while; 
Now the Banker he is poor, even riches are not sure, 
And the Beggar he has riches, wealth and style; 
With cold and bitter hunger, nearly dead, 
The Banker asks the Beggar for some bread; 
And the pityful cry is heard, he gives him money with 
the words, 
You have found that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now in this, our glorious town, as I've very often found 
There's a 
hundred just such cases every day; 
Gold is all you need, you'll find, to prosper bear in mind 
It's the king of all the nation people 
; 
Our country's been in trouble near and far, 
Peace and honesty seems like a 
distant star; 
We'll reform and do our best, with victoryon our crest, 
You'll find we'll be the winners in the end.

THE YARN 01ii THE NANCY BELL. 
Sang originally by NED BARRY at Timatre Comique, Broadway, 
Music published at HARDINGS, Bowery. 
'Twas in the good ship Nancy Bell, 
We sailed for the Indian Sea; 
And there on a 
reef, we came to grief, 
Which often occurred to me, brave boys, 
Which often occurred to me; 
And pretty nigh all the crew were drowned, 
There were seventy-seven all told; 
And only ten of the Nancy's men, 
Cried here to the muster roll, brave boys, 
Said here to the muster roll. 
There was me and the cook and the captain bold, 
And the mate of the Nancy brig; 
A 
boatswain tight, and a 
midship's mite, 
And the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys, 
The crew of the captain's gig; 
For a 
month we'd neither victuals nor drink, 
Till hungry we did feel; 
So we drew a 
lot and accordingly shot, 
The captain for our meal, brave boys, 
The captain for our meal. 
The next lot fell to the Nancy's mate, 
And a 
delicate dish he made; 
Then our appetite with a 
midship's mite, 
We seven survivors stayed, brave boys, 
We seven survivors stayed; 
And the next of us eat was the boatswain tight, 
And he much resembled pig; 
And we victualed free, did the cook and me, 
On the crew of the captain's gig, brave boys, 
On the crew of the captain's gig. 
Then only me and the cook was left, 
And a 
delicate; which 
Of us two goes to the kettle, arose, 
And we argued it out as such, brave boys, 
We argued it out as such; 
For I 
loved that cook as a 
brother, I 
did, 
And the cook he worshipped me; 
But we'd both be blowed, if we'd either be stowed, 
In the other chap's hold, you see, brave boys, 
In the other chap's hold, you see.

And yer age must be just sweet sixteen, 
And yer white kid gloves yer will have to wear, 
When yer ride up in de chariot in de morn.

"Music published and copyrighted by F.

Cincinnati, Ohio. 
At night when we are lying on 
Our beds, secure and warm, 
We hear the mourning winds that tell, 
The coming of the storm; 
The lightning flashed, the thunder roared 
Around its childish glee, 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
CHORUS: 
Amidst the raging of the storm, 
We humbly ask of thee, 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
The sailor little thinks, when he 
Lets out upon the wave, 
The worn-out ship in which he sails, 
May bear him to his grave; 
Should storm arise, her rotten planks 
To pieces soon may go; 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow. 
Vet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow.

MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST—CONTINUED. 
MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST. 
By JOHN LOCKE. 
Rpcited by Mr. J. F. SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, at HARRY 
MINERS'S THEATRE, N. 
Y., and throughout the country. 
Th' anam au Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sireland! 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another flight, 
There's so much joy in returning— 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornin'; 
Oh, Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged, 
A 
million of waves come trooping. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloomed it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love-light first illumed it. 
And doe•4n't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching- the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up against the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's beds, 
All, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en so, 'twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
.But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ope 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Ah! oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave, 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
All danger and doubthrs scornin', 
.I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore- line shows-
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze, 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old swigs, old friends again. 
The vale and cot I 
was born in ! 
Oh, Ireland, up from mv heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the to 
of the mornin'. 
BOYS, LEAVE DRINK ALONE! 
Written by JAMES LARKIN for NED BARRY, and sung by him with 
great success at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Motto songs of every kind, 
have through the world been sung; 
But I 
have one, the truest one, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I 
will unfurl, 
A 
sad one you will own; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
Citonus: 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I 
give. 
Once I 
was a 
happy man, 
And had a 
loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can, 
If you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
Now those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
This is a 
tale I 
know that's true, 
As in the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
When I 
tell you, you will start; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
Is from this broken heart. 
The Tar's Farewell. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I 
should do, 
Pull away, pull away. 
I 
left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea; 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
For the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
(Repea./.)

SPEAK TO MY WIFE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & ITAam's 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
There's a 
great and glorious time in store, 
For husbands one and all; 
For the wives are coming to the fore, 
And husbands singing small; 
The ladies mean to do the work, 
And so, in consequence; 
The men, all trouble mean to shirk, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.— And indeed, fellows ought to be grateful to 
the darlings for waking up to the fact, that the husbands 
have maintained the wives long enough, and now they 
mean to have a 
turn themselves. 
By jove! 
Won't it be 
immense? When the fellow comes for the Poor Rates, 
Water Rates, or any other Rates, to say, " Oh! If its cash 
you require, you must" 
Cnonus: 
Speak to Lucinda! 
Yes! speak to my wife! 
Speak to Lucinda! 
The pride of my life; 
She saves me all trouble, all bother and strife, 
So I 
beg that you'll speak to my wife. 
They'll have to take us out each day, 
To Concert, Ball, or Rout; 
They'll have to treat us to the play, 
To Oysters, " Chant." or Stout; 
The dears will have to find the cash, 
To meet each big expense; 
They'll pay the debts or " go to smash," 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—Ohl bless them, they shall have Woman's 
Rights, and Woman's Responsibilities, and we fellows will 
stay at home and look nice, and, I 
say, won't it be immense 
to order carte blanche from the wine-merchant and eigar• 
man, and, when they hint at a 
settlement of " the little 
account," to gently remark— 
(Chorus) 
27 
SPEAK TO MY WIFE.—CoNTusuED, 
They'll drive us down in a 
Four-in-Hand, 
To the, Derby, darling pets; 
And find us seats upon the stand, 
And lay us losing bets; 
We'll have new costumes ev'ry day, 
Regardless of expense; 
And the tailors' bills they'll have to pay. 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN. —
And when they particularly wish to take us 
anywhere, we will say, " Oh, No! really can't go; haven't 
a 
thing to wean". Then, perhaps, they'll remark, " But 
where's that sweet costume you wore yesterday?" 
And 
we will reply, " The idea, that thing! Why I've positively 
worn it twice." 
Oh! won't it be immense to have a 
new 
rig out from Poole for every possible occasion, with the 
definite understanding that he is to— 
To business they will go by train 
Or on the ' bus will ride; 
And if it should come on to rain, 
They'll hare to go outside; 
A thousand things they'll have to do, 
To their disgust intense; 
And if it only does come true. 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
(Chorus). 
SPOKEN.—Ah! but I 
fear it is too good ever to come off. 
Nothing would suit me better than to change places with 
my wife, she to take the care and anxiety of the " head of 
the family," and I 
to live a 
life of luxurious ease at her 
expense. 
Just imagine, you know, if Chips, the Banker, 
wrote to say that there wasn't sufficient cash in hand to 
meet those little pieces of paper that are flying about with 
my autograph at the tail. 
Eh! I 
say! 
Won't it be im-
mense to write back and say, " Look here, old fellow, its 
not my affair at all. 
You must—

BREACH OF PROMISE CASE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at H ARRIGAN tt H ART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. V. 
Once I 
loved Matilda Minking, 
Once Matilda she loved me; 
Once we billed and cooed like winking, 
Once engaged to wed were we; 
Now all things are altered sadly, 
Our engagement's all U. P.; 
Matilda served me, oh! so badly, 
Silly old Cupid's up a 
tree. 
SPOKEN.—And I'm up a 
tree, too, for she who might 
have been my spouse, has made me pay for my broken 
vows, although— 
CHORUS: 
Once she loved me to distraction, 
Once she was beloved by me; 
Now she's gone and brought an action, 
Against her lover that used to be. 
Tilly in a 
shocking fashion, 
Flirted hard with ev'ry swell; 
Filling me with rage and passion, 
So one day I 
said " Farewell!" 
This, of course, raised Tilly's ire, 
Oh! you should have seen her face, 
Nothing at all would satisfy her, 
But a 
Breach of Promise Case. 
SPOKEN.— She said I 
had basely deserted her, but not 
she would not be trampled upon with impunity, (as if f 
wanted to trample on her with anything at all). 
She had 
three hundred and forty-nine love letters of mine, and 
damages she would have. 
Oh ! the inconsistency of woman. 
She said she was injured and yet she wanted further dam-
ages. 
She hated the sight of me, although— 
(Chorus), 
29 
j 
BREACH OF PROMISE CASE.—CONTINUED. 
The case was tried, the Court was quite full, 
Everybody was there to see; 
They seemed to think the fun delightful, 
Sport to them was death to me; 
Tilly's lawyer to the jury, 
Bullied me beyond all bounds; 
The verdict was, oh! rage and fury, 
Damages, just one thousand Pounds. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, only a 
thousand; that's all. 
I 
could for-
get that, and forgive Tilly, but never can I 
forgive that 
odious lawyer of hers, Jawkins, Q. C. 
Not content with 
calling me villain, forger, burglar, assassin and other mild 
epithets, he added injury to insult by reading my letters to 
the jury. 
This is one of them: 
My own Angelic Darling: 
I 
cannot retire to my lonely couch without once more 
pouring out to you the devotion of this heart that beats for 
thee, and thee alone, my beautiful, my own. 
Oh! what a 
paradige was ours as we. stood upon the doorstep this 
evening, oblivious of all save love. 
No! No! I 
cannot re-
tire to my lonely couch. I 
will watch o'er thee; the door-
step on which we stood shall be my couch, the scraper 
pressed by your seraphic boot, shall be my pillow. 
Sleep 
on! 
He read that, and everybody laughed. 
Oh! I 
could 
smother him! I 
was so upset, that when the Judge asked 
me a 
question, I replied- (Chorus). 
Now Pm in a 
pretty pickle, 
With the cash I've had to pay; 
My Matilda false and fickle, 
Weds another man to- day; 
So ev'ry swain whom Cupid fetters, 
My advice should take I 
think; 
And always write their spooney letters, 
In Anti-Breach of Promise Ink. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen! 
Whenever you write love 
letters, always be careful to use the Anti- Breach of Prom-
ise Ink, which fades away in a 
week or two after it is 
written. 
If you do this, you will never have occiv•ion t 
say with 111C— (Chorus),

Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we; 
Try to be happy where'er you may be, 
If the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again— 
So paddle your boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay. 
Let this world jog on as it may; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the bad; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all, 
If we be content with a 
share of the small, 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once_more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c:

TEE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus Wm/Jams, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And ,,he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
• 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never gnnci w11.2 
the water that is past.. 
Good-Bye, Lovely Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. 
GOULLARD. 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away. 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And .1 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thinl- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, &c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, &c.

Good Bye, Sweetheart, Good Bye."

The tear is hiding in mine eye, 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms; 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye!' 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
'or time doth thrust me from thine arms. 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms. 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye I 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticl?er, 
The levret bounds o'cr ealth's soft flooring, 
Yet I

For since night's gems from heav'n did fade, 
And morn to floral lies doth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, tho' I 
said, 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
Good by, sweetheart, good bye! 
I 
could not leave thee, tho' I

Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
KATE FROM OLD KENTIICK. 
Words and Music by JoHN McVEion. 
Originally sung by Miss KATE M ONTROSE. 
My little Kate from old Kentuck, 
I 
love her, oh! so well, 
I 
love her in the morning, noon and night/ 
I 
love her in the evening, 
When the twilight shadows fall, 
I 
love her pretty, blue eyes, bright 
I 
learned to love her years ago. 
And her ways I 
did admire; 
I 
loved her first in school- boy days, 
She did my heart inspire. 
CHORUS: 
My little Kate whom none could hate, 
To win you was my good luck; 
My charming Kate, my pretty Kate, 
My Kate from old Kentuck. 
I 
love her in the spring time. 
When the summer roses bloom, 
I 
love her in the autumn just as well, 
I 
love her in the winter, 
When snow it doth appear, 
And chilly winds creep round our cosy dell; 
I 
love her for herself alone, 
Far dearer than my life; 
I 
love her for her gentle ways, 
That's why I 
call her wife. 
(Chorus).

'Twas a beautiful day but a 
short time ago, 
met a 
young friend named McKay; 
Says he if you'll come, we'll have lots of fun, 
At our picnic that's going down the bay; 
I 
refused first to go, but he'd not accept no, 
On my going he insisted quite hearty; 
Saying please come along, you can sing us a 
song, 
• And help entertain our small party. 
CHORUS: 
Dancing with the girls and boys, 
Schottische, and waltzing so gay; 
I 
danced 5 o 
much I 
was really tired, 
At the picnic down the bay. 
The gents were all dressed in suits of the best, 
And the ladies looked happy and light; 
As the boat left the pier, we loudly did cheer, 
It was really a 
beautiful sight; 
Both the old and young had plenty of fun, 
To hear the girls laughing and singing; 
Our joy to enhance, we'd each other outdance, 
While the band its sweet music kept ringing.

I'll bet you a

I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sirl who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
call 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? . 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'- the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Words and Music by FLORENCE HARPER. 
Music published by SPEAR & DENHOFF, New York, and sent postpaid

Copyright, 1878, by HARRISON MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED AYMAR, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
0:i, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If thig chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the st trs and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Cho 
ru .). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and- bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
rile old wooden rocker that stood loy the wall.

Each animal and bird can hear the voice of love, 
From the roaring lion to the turtle dove, 
And when I 
want to call a 
mate, I 
have my way, 
And in a 
language of my own, thus I 
say: 
CHORUS: 
How (I've do? wst, wstl how are you? wst, wst! 
You are always sure to fetch them with a 
wst, wst, wm! 
Come along, wst, wst! nothing wrong, wst, wst! 
Oh, won't you come and take a 
walk, and a 
wst, wst, wst! 
One day I 
met a 
lady in the Central Park, 
She said that she was fond of birds, and liked a 
lark, 
So I 
sat myself beside her 'neath the rustling trees, 
And took her little hand in mine and gave it a 
squeeze. 
(Chorus). 
Says she, " I 
think my appetite is very good, 
A 
pleasant meal I'd relish sir, indeed I 
should, 
I'm good at ordering suppers, and I'll save your pelf 
So if you do not mind, I'll order it myself." 
CHORUS: 
" 
Garcon, here! wst, wst! nothing queer, wst, wst! 
We want the best of everything, wst, wst, wst! 
And will test, wst, wst! the very best, wst, wst! 
And we don't mind what we pay for it, wst, wst, wst! 
YOU ARE ALWAYS SURE TO CATCH THEM 
WITH A WST! WST! WST !
— CONTINUED 
The way she ate I 
thought that she hersLlf would hurt 
The soup, the fish, the entrees, joints and the dessert, 
She truly said that appetite's a 
splendid sauce, 
And she ordered in a 
different wine with every course. 
Cumws: 
Curaco, wst, wst! she could lower, wst, wst! 
She started on the wine list with a 
wst, wst, wst! 
Then some rum, wst, wst! yes, ruin and gum, wst, wst! 
Did the fairy sweetly order, with a 
wst, wst, wst! 
She ordered everything with such a 
charming grace, 
That the bill was growing just abouta long a; my face 
When in a 
hulking fellow came, who grimly said, 
If you don't pay the bill and go, I'll punch your head. 
CHORUS: 
Au revoir, wst, wst! through the door, wst, wst! 
Then arm in arm they left me with a

Come and settle for the supper with a

The charges were about as high as Bunker Hill, 
Amazed, when I 
was called upon to square that bill. 
And when I 
went to settle up what could I 
do, 
When I 
found my purse was. gone, my watch, my 
diamonds too! 
CHORUS: 
Policeman here, wst, wst! something queer, wst, wst!

Mrs. Brady, a 
widow lady, 
Has a 
daughter that I 
adore; 
I 
go to court her, across the water, 
Every Sunday afternoon at four; 
She sings so sweetly, she dresses so neatly, 
So like a 
fairy she trips the floor; 
She's good society, she's full of piety, 
And her mother keeps a 
little candy store. 
Dainty feet, measured beat, 
Trips the street; oh! so neat; 
Dresses sweet, what a 
treat, 
And her mother keeps a 
candy store; 
Her name is Norah, I 
do adore her, 
She's like an angel, my heart is so sore; 
She's like a 
daisy, she sets me crazy, 
And her mother keeps a 
liqle c3rnly store. 
(Dance). 
Every Sunday, and every Monday, 
With the family I 
go to dine; - 
And the daughter, I 
do escort her, 
Every evening till the clock strikes nine; 
One Summer evening, the moon was beaming 
I 
said I 
loved her as dear as life; 
She blushed completely and smiled so sweetly 
Yet she promised she'd be my darling wife.

FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE MEER. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van A.mburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.— Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, she 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE. — And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— 
(Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-
about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE. — And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out—  
(
Chorus).

And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
0 
Jean, iny dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine. 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean.

Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie,

I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that,

don't give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis,

Music at E.

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair,, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You care then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &c.

And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell% 
Shure it's every Sunday night,

And all those lovely songs she sings to n-
be.

She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I

Tliere is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me. 
She sings, she sings, &c.

AT IT AGAIN. 
Sung with immense success by HARRY AIONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be obtained from SPEAR & DEHNIIOFF, 
717 Broadway, N. Y. 
I've just arrived in town you see, to spend a 
week or two, 
But I've been so vexed since I've been here, I 
don't know what 
to do, 
For everybody says to me no n.atter where I 
be, 
And whatever I 
am doing this is what they say to me, 
CHORUS. 
At it again, at it again, 
You rascal I'm looking your at it again, 
You're a 
naughty young man, I 
see very plain, 
You rascal I'm looking, your at it again. 
I 
took a 
cab when I 
arrived, and drove at once up town, 
A 
ml because I'd not pay double fare the "cabby" then did frown 
He said he'd take me to the Mayor, and of me he'd complain, 
Then the crowd said I 
was cheating, and cried out " you're at 
it again." 
At it again, etc. 
I 
paid him then to go away, and sneaked off very soon, 
And being as it were upset, I 
entered a 
saloon, 
I 
drank three brandies right clean off to ease my troubled brain 
When a 
youngster poked his head in the door, and cried out 
" 
you're at it again." 
At it again, etc. 
When evening camel took a 
stroll, the sights in town to see, 
And I 
met a 
lovely creature, who seemed pleased at meeting 
me. 
We 
walked awhile, and bye-and-bye, in a 
restaurant we went, 
And in a 
cozy little supper room, we soon were quite oontent. 
Spoken.— We had a 
nice supper together, and after supper, I 
asked the young lady for a 
kiss, and just as she got her dear 
little mouth all puckered up for that delightful sensation, the 
infermd waiter put his head in the door, and shouted out— 
At it again, etc. 
A 
Helping Hand. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Respectfully presented to BILLY MAYO by CHAS. P. 
DONNELEY. 
There are many sayings true 
That are known to me and you, 
Tho' perchance we have forgotten them, and yet, 
When a 
person has got means, 
How easy then it seems 
That the sufferings of mankind we should forget. 
And now that pay is small, 
Some can get no work at all; 
Many honest men are starving through the land. 
So it's now I 
bring advice, 
For which I 
nothing charge in price, 
And my motto is— Lend a 
Helping Hand. 
CHORUS. 
Then if riches you would gain, 
Or fame you would attain, 
Bear in mind this noble maxim I 
command, 
And believe me when I 
say 
That in the end you'll find 'twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand. 
First we'll take an orphan boy, 
He's no home he can enjoy. 
Ever since he can remember, he will say 
That his home has been the street, 
In winter cold and summer heat, 
Because his parents in a 
drunkard's grave did lay. 
Now I 
think you will agree 
With the idea held by me, 
That that poor boy should be allowed to stand, 
A HELPING HAND. 
Continued. 
And in spite of croakers all, 
Who would his parents' sin recall, 
Every one should lend a 
helping hand. 
For though it strange appears, 
Perhaps in course of years, 
That boy may be a 
credit to this land, 
If some one with kindly heart 
Would nobly take his part, 
And extend to that poor boy a 
helping hand. 
There is still another case, 
With which I'll bring you face to face, 
Tho' its now we see it almost every day. 
'Tis when a 
widow, poor and old, 
Who has got no gold, 
In the street she's turned, her rent she cannot pay; 
While the grasping landlord he 
Looks on in silent glee, 
Throw her things in the street is his command. 
Oh what a 
world of good 
Some one could do if they would, 
By saying I'll lend to her a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
Now my little song is done, 
Tho' its true I've caused no fun; 
I 
hope you won't forget my motto grand, 
And believe me when I 
say 
That in the end you'll find ' twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand. 
Written by Sem SEETREW. 
Oh, it's jolly to have money, 
Everybody should, 
had I 
only my way, honey, 
Everybody would; 
Ye that's happy and have plenty, 
From poverty secure. 
In times like these when you're at ease, 
Oh, don't forget the poor.

Ye that's happy and have plenty, 
From poverty secure, 
In times like these when you're at ease, 
Oh, don't forget the poor. 
Oh, it's jolly, yes, 0, very, 
When the night is cold, 
By a 
blazing fire a 
sitting 
Counting up your gold, 
All without is cold and dreary,

In times like these when you're 
Oh, don't forget the poor. 
at ease, 
All without is cold and dreary; 
Angry winds they roar, 
In times like these when you're at ease, 
Oh, don't forget the poor. 
Don't Forget a 
Friend. 
Written and sung by Charles H. Duncan. 
Copyrighted by 
George D. Newhall, Cincinnati. 
All through this world are many things 
That puzzle and perplex, 
And many of us find in life occurrences that vex. 
The high, the low, the rich, the poor, 
Meet equal in the end, 
Though some may sneer and put on airs, 
With what good luck may send, 
Yet he who takes us by the hand 
And wishes us success 
We'll not forget in future, though 
His fortune may grow less; 
We'll try to aid him, cheer him 
Upward, onward to the end, 
For should reverses come to us 
He'll not forget a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't forget a 
friend, 
Pray, don't forget a 
friend; 
Let this your motto be through life, 
Pray don't forget a 
friend. [ Repeat.] 
The drunkard whom you pass with scorn 
Was once respected, too, 
And when a 
child, a 
mother's love 
He had, as well as you. 
When money filled his pockets 
lie was hail good fellow then, 
But now, that all his cash 
Has flown, forgotten by most men. 
But now that all his cash has flown, 
Forgotten by most men. 
Let this a 
lesson be to you: 
Be temperate in all things, 
And give your fellowman a 
lift, 
Whom err misfortune brings, 
You cannot tell from day to day 
What others they may semi. 
Let this your motto be through life 
Pray don't forget a 
friend.

DOWN WHERE THE DAISIES GROW. 
Words and Music by AuctitE DELMAI,tniG. 
Sung by " The DELMANINGS" with great succeSs.in the 
rand 
Central Theatre, Galveston, Texas. 
'Twits down close by the running brook 
'Where first I 
met my love; 
The whippoorwills were singing, 
And the moon shone bright above; 
Her eyes were like the brilliant stars, 
As she watched the brooklet flow; 
My heart I 
lost that summer night, 
Down where the daisies grow. 
CHORUS: 
With love, my heart ig dancing, ( Break). 
In sweet dreams, yes, I'm prancing; (Break). 
She is fairer than the blooming roses, 
That wave when the breezes blow; 
Where first we met, I'll not forget, 
'Twas down where the daisies grow. 
We've often met down by the brook, 
Where first in love we fell; 
And as the wavelets washed the shore, 
Our tales of love would tell; 
I 
gathered flowers and decked her hair, 
Where the laughing streamlets flow; 
And carved her name on the old oak tree, 
Down where the daisies grow. 
One evening we were walking down, 
The green and shady lane: 
'Twas then and there I 
asked my love, 
If she would change her name; 
She blushed, and murmured, with a 
smile, 
I 
really can't say no; 
And now we dwell in happiness, 
Down where the daisies grow. 
4Pveas.

.HE KIND LOVING FACES AT HOME. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
fm thinking to-day of the home of my youth, 
Near the brooklet that runs through the glade, 
The green grassy lawn and the orchard so dear, 
Where oft in my childhood I've strayed; 
'Tis many a 
year since those scenes I 
have left, 
Through far-distant countries to roam, 
But where'er I've wandered I've still longed to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
CHORUS. 
And though we are parted, yet ever to me 
Sweet thoughts of my loved ones will come ; 
And where'er 1 
wander I 
still long to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
How oft in my dreams have my thoughts wandered back 
To my mother, so kind and so true, 
Who whispered " Good by and God bless you, my boy," 
When I 
bid her and father adieu; 
E'en now in my fancy I 
once more can feel 
Her warm, loving kiss on ray brow, 
And sigh when I 
think that ' tis naught but a 
dream, 
For I'm wandering far from her now. 
And though, etc. 
My sweet loving sister, with whom I 
have played 
So oft in our childhood at home, 
Has sent to me many a 
message of love, 
To cheer me wherever I 
roam; 
My father is waiting to greet me again, 
When my long weary journey is o'er, 
And soon we will meet round the old fireside, 
To part until death, never more. 
I 
Only Just Wanted To Know. 
How oft you are meeting with people 
Who seem to have nothing to do, 
But prying in somebody's business 
Or asking their questions of you, _ 
And when you ask why they're so anxious, 
They will stammer and smile and they bow, 
And then they will say, 0, excuse me I 
pray, 
Now I 
only just wanted to know. 
Cnonus. 
Now I 
only just wanted to know, 
You know, you know, you know, you know, 
No harm in the question to ask you know, 
For I 
only just wanted to know. 
If the ring that you wear is a 
diamond, 
If your gold watch and chain isn't brass, 
If your moustache is red and you dye it, 
If one of your eyes isn't glass, 
If the lady you took to hear Beecher 
Is the wife of your friend so and so, 
Now don't think me rude or I 
wish to intrude, 
Now I 
only just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
There's Jones and his wife are so happy, 
Their twins took a 
prize at the show 
For having the hair that was reddest, 
While there's is black as a 
crow, 
Jones asked me if him they resembled 
And in answer I 
said to him " No," 
He rusheol down street and while running screeched 
That's all, he just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
If somebody knows there is something 
That nobody else doesn't know, 
Should somebody tell it to some one 
if somebody wanted to know, 
For somebody said that somebody 
Had been saying somebody said so, 
Now don't think me rude, that I 
wish to intrude, 
For I 
only just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
As sung with great success by M ISS JENNIE HUGHES.

Since first this world created was, 
The greatest pow'r of mind, 
Is wielded by the gentle sex, 
That lord it o'er mankind; 
Since Mother Eve to Adam gave, 
The first sweet taste of sin, 
The husbands and the sweethearts have 
Been always taken in. 
CHORUS. 
These charming little creatures win, 
Your heart with but a 
glance, 
You're surely to be taken in, 
If you give a 
girl the chance. 
Don't talk to me of mighty deeds, 
Upon the battle field, 
Of soldiers and of statesmen great, 
Of_reen that would not yield, 
There never was produe'd a 
man, 
Who did so brave become, 
But that a 
girl whene'er she lik'd, 
Could twirl him round her thumb. 
CHORUS.—These charming, &e. 
A 
lady in the days of old, 
Did Sampson's whiskers shave, 
And Mrs. Jinks in Modern times, 
Did Butler's vengeance brave; 
Miss Walker wears the pantaloons, 
Her watchword is advance, 
And each sweet girl would do the Same, 
Could she but get the chance. 
Cnonus.—These charming, &e. 
It's No Business of Mine. 
Sung with overwhelming 'applause throughout the . 
United States, by 
HARRY M ONTAGUE. 
I 
want to put you all in a 
good humor, 
And you know that I 
never refuse, 
For no matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting at all the late news. 
Now if you will listen a 
moment, 
I'll tell you in my little rhyme 
Of some things I 
have seen that are curious, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now for instance, at Mrs. Montgomery's, 
Every afternoon just about five, 
While her husband is down town at business, 
A 
nobby young gent does arrive. 
He always stays there until eight, 
But her husband don't come home till nine ; 
Now I'd like to know what he is doing there— 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
A 
friend of mine yesterday told me 
Last Wednesday he had such a 
lark; 
He met Mrs.—never mind who, 
While taking a 
walk in the Park, 
He offered the lady his arm, 
And took her to Brooklyn to dine; 
They never got back till next morning— 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
I 
Met Lucy Bell Cother evening, 
With her nephew out taking a 
walk, 
She stopped, of course, when she saw me, 
And then we had a 
nice talk 
About her dear little nephew, 
Who she says is between eight and nine. 
Now some say he isn't her nephew— 
Well of course it's no business of mine. 
There's another young lady, Miss Baxter, 
A 
fine, handsome, dashing young girl, 
She's been flirting for over a 
year 
With a 
fellow by the name of Fitzfurl; 
She says she is going to get married, 
'Pon my word I 
think it's quite time, 
For if she's not married soon, why, she ought to be, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
In New York, at the Manhattan Bank, 
Three millions were stolen away, 
And the janitor was handcuffed and bound, 
In the broad open light of the day. 
Now to me this seems very queer, 
And I'll wager a 
bottle of wine 
That the directors knew nothing (?) about it 
But of course it's no busines6 of mine.

Published by permission. 
On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &C. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea. 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O-V- E. 
For on a, bright summer, &c,

'Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives arspent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the dim. 
OtIty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of th ei
r 
affecti
ons, 
which 
fact 
makes a 
farther explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HIIMff$TIIPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG-I 
It is a Fa,c simile of a Trick practiced by alt 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading 'journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordex 
has been sent us, called HIIMPT? DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, • 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or :Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at _ home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
