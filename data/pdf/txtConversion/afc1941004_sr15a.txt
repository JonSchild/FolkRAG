John Henry Faulk: Mr. Jirosik, what do you think about Japan's action last Sunday?
Joe Jirosik: I think they were all wrong.
John Henry Faulk: Well, for what reason? Do you think it was any justification whatever on the part of
Japan in making that attack?
Joe Jirosik: I don't think there's any.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think the United States should have done then?
Joe Jirosik: Declare war on them.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, you're behind Roosevelt's resolution?
Joe Jirosik: Hundred percent.
John Henry Faulk: Well, that's good. Do you think that all America has fallen, I mean all of your
associates have fallen in pretty well behind him?
Joe Jirosik: As far as I can see, all of them.
John Henry Faulk: Do you hear much talk around your job? You're a carpenter, aren't you?
Joe Jirosik: Yes.
John Henry Faulk: A finisher.
Joe Jirosik: [There is right smart talk (?)]
John Henry Faulk: What seems to be the general opinion amongst the carpenters' union, then?
Joe Jirosik: Well, they all about like me. They think it's right for the United States to declare war on
them.

John Henry Faulk: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Do they seem to have any opinion as to who's going to win
and who's going to lose?
Joe Jirosik: Well, some of them seems to think that won't last long, but I'm of a different opinion. I
think it's going to last quite a while.
John Henry Faulk: How come?
Joe Jirosik: Well, because the United States is going to first have to corner it.
John Henry Faulk: [laughs].
Joe Jirosik: Just like a dog catching a rabbit, you've got to catch him before you can kill him.
John Henry Faulk: That's right. It's going to be some problem catching out there in the Pacific
Ocean. ???
Joe Jirosik: That's right.
John Henry Faulk: Do you think maybe Germany had any hand in this?
Joe Jirosik: I believe Hitler had a direct contact in it.
John Henry Faulk: He's the one that instigated it?
Joe Jirosik: I believe that's right.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about Russia's part in it?
Joe Jirosik: Well, I don't think Russia's got anything to do with it.
John Henry Faulk: I mean though, do you think Russia's going to give us a hand? Do you think she's
going to support us or she's going to . . .
Joe Jirosik: Well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't trust them too far.
John Henry Faulk: Wouldn't trust Russia?
Joe Jirosik: Not too far.

John Henry Faulk: Well, why do you reckon Japan wanted to do such a cruel thing as to attack the
United States?
Joe Jirosik: [pause] Listening to Hitler, that's my opinion.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, it wasn't their own deciding?
Joe Jirosik: Not totally.
John Henry Faulk: I don't believe that . . . what do you think about Japan's preparation?
Do you think, I'd like you to kind of summarize that. By that, I mean how is Japan, is Japan prepared
for such a war as this, do you think?
Joe Jirosik: I don't think they are prepared. They might think they are, but I don't think they'll last over
two years.
John Henry Faulk: You mean they'll collapse then economically?
Joe Jirosik: I believe they will.
John Henry Faulk: Well, what about the United States then? How well prepared is she?
Joe Jirosik: Well, I believe she is as well prepared as Japan and she can prepare faster now than Japan
can.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think the labor ought to do about this? You know labor has been, in
the opinion of some people, getting kind of a raw deal. And they're fixing to get a pretty raw deal at
least, at least before the war was declared.
Joe Jirosik: Well, that's my opinion. I think they didn't. I don't believe in strikes during this . . .
John Henry Faulk: Emergency.
Joe Jirosik: This emergency, but at the same time, I don't believe in the capitalists tromping on the
laboring man.
John Henry Faulk: Well, I like that. I like that, I like that opinion all right and I think that, do you
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr15
think that labor is going to come out though ahead after this war? Do you think that, in other words,
her rights will be protected? The labor man's rights will be protected properly?
Joe Jirosik: I believe they will.
John Henry Faulk: Well, how about Roosevelt, is he a friend or not to labor?
Joe Jirosik: He's a laboring man's friend, at least that's the way I take him.
John Henry Faulk: What about Mr. O'Daniels, senator from Texas and Tom Connally.
Joe Jirosik: Well, I don't think very much of Senator O'Daniels.
John Henry Faulk: He's the one that's gotten bad with the labor here in Texas some time ago.
Joe Jirosik: Well, I think very little of him and I'd rather not even discuss him [interviewer laughs]. That's
right.
John Henry Faulk: Well, that's good. A minute ago you said you thought that all your fellow workers
out there on jobs, where about you working?
Joe Jirosik: Working on the music hall in the University of Texas.
John Henry Faulk: They're all in behind the president. Have you heard anybody dissent? Have you
heard anybody that's not with the United States ???
Joe Jirosik: I haven't heard a soul. Not a one.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, labor got right in behind Mr. Roosevelt when he declared war.
Joe Jirosik: I believe the labor is a hundred percent behind him.
John Henry Faulk: Here in Austin anyhow.
Joe Jirosik: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: Well, that's interesting because goodness knows he'll need that support.
Everybody needs the labor support so that this country to go on.

How about South Americas? What do you think they're going to do? What about South American
countries?
Joe Jirosik: Well, to tell you the truth ??? I don't know much about this.
John Henry Faulk: Think they'll be any help?
Joe Jirosik: Well, yes, they'll be some help. No doubt about that.
John Henry Faulk: Might give a hand in help get on our feet [laughs] then while we're trying to catch
the Japanese. How about Japan's preparation, do you think they're pretty well-prepared?
Joe Jirosik: I believe they're prepared to last two years.
John Henry Faulk: I mean you think they've been preparing for this very thing?
Joe Jirosik: Oh yes. All this scrap iron they bought from the United States. That's all went in the war
machinery.
John Henry Faulk: Do you reckon the people that sold them that scrap iron knew about it? What do
you think the laboring man thinks about that?
Joe Jirosik: Well, I guess the laboring man is of the same opinion I am.
John Henry Faulk: Sure you â€”
Joe Jirosik: Yes, it was the capitalists that sold this stuff to them, they knew what they was using it for.
But that wasn't a question at that time it was money, greed for money.
John Henry Faulk: Mm hmm [affirmative]. ??? What about the oil that was sent to them? Do you have
any opinion?
Joe Jirosik: Well, I believe they knew that they were storing up for the very purpose.
John Henry Faulk: Last ship back on to the United States and bomb us.
Joe Jirosik: That's it.
John Henry Faulk: I wouldn't be surprised if that's not a very sound opinion, Mr. Jirosik.

Joe Jirosik: That's exactly what I believe ???.
