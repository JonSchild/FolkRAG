James
July 6, 1943 Dr. Willis Laurence James The Fort Valley State College Fort Valley,
Georgia
Dear Dr. James:
I am sorry to hear of the trouble you are having with your recording machine and hope
that it will be possible for you to have it corrected in Atlanta or Macon. With reference to
sending you a recording machine for the Annual Summer Folk Festival, I regret that on
account of previous commitments, we have none available. There is a heavy demand on
our equipment in connection with the war effort and we have great difficulty in keeping
up with it. You may recall that John Work once attempted to record the Festival for us,
but somehow, his plans failed to materialize. We hope that your machine will be in good
condition by August 1st so that you may do justice to the occasion.
When I wrote of the copies of the records we sent to Dr. Bond, I thought they would
be available to you without further copying. But it is a good idea to protect them from
excessive playing.
With best wishes,
Faithfully, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
