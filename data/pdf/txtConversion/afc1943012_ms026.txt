April 1, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to H.M. Bond
, 1943 Dr. H. M. Bond, President Fort Valley State College Fort Valley, Ga.
Dear Dr. Bond:
At lunch yesterday Lewis Jones gave me a report on the recording project in which Fort
Valley State College is cooperating with the Library of Congress. I am very eager to hear
the ten records which were cut, and which I understand you are getting ready to send to
us.
The question of what to do with the remaining blank disks is one on which I should like to
have your advice. If Dr. Willis James can see his way clear to locating additional material
of sufficient , we could extend the project for a short period. It would be best, however, for
us to have the completed work at hand as a basis for planning further recording.
With best wishes,
Faithfully, B.A.Botkin, Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
