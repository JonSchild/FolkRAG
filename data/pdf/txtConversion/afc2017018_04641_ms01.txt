P: 
I have a brother, she has a son that does what you do. 
I2: 
Okay. 
I: 
Okay. We’re gonna start, so I’ll start by saying thank you so much for the work that you do as a 
personal care worker— 
P: 
My pleasure. 
I: 
And thank you for agreeing to do these interviews, so this is M and H K, mother and daughter. Both of 
them doing personal care work for years and years on and off, and we’re here to listen to your stories. So, I’m 
going to jump right in and just ask how you got into this kind of work, why you got into it? You know, tell us 
from the beginning what got you in to doing personal care work. And I’ll just say real quick, that in general, the 
people in the project have been referring to the work that you do as personal care aide work or PCA. You 
might call it something different. If you do, I’d like to hear what you think the work should be called. What do 
you call yourselves? 
M: 
Yeah. I think of myself sort of as a jack of all trades—PCA, but then I’m willing to do house repair and 
driving and whatever presents itself [28.07] that I’m comfortable with or “resource broker”. If I’m not able to do 
it, then I help people find someone who can do it. It’s just—and in terms of how long, my goodness, momma 
taught us from bein’ knee high to Boll weevils that we take care of the elderly, and when we were little kids in 
the family and we had neighbors, if they were elderly, we were always sending food, checking on them, 
whatever it was they needed. Helping them clean up. Back then it was all volunteer, and just part of 
community. And I don’t know, I retired as a social worker and saw the need in my church as my church friends 
and neighbors aged, some of them needed help and that’s sort of how I got back into it. Although I did it for 
physically disabled folks too, so that’s sort of my path there. I remember you (HK) telling me that your mother 
used to have you guys make collars for the people in the—what was it in jail or something? 
H: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
P: 
And you took sweaters or collars or something? 
H: 
Yeah, you know, yeah. One of the things I really don’t want it to be call is like an aide. I like to be called 
like a companion, something more, relates to them. No work, more kind, more familiar because that’s 
[inaudible], I love to cook, help older people and [inaudible] the same, my mother told everything to us—took 
care of a lot of older people, and she always said to us, “You know, these people work, you know, born, live, 
work, give whatever they can to the family or the community or whatever, now they can’t do that anymore. It’s 
ours to do for them, and when I was still working in the senior center in Lowell, running the senior center there, 
that was a great opportunity because not only I took care of the seniors in the center, but the individual seniors 
who need help. You know, companionship, helping cleaning, or just whatever. We’d always be there. Unlike 
[inaudible], from the beginning the whole family took part in whatever [25.30]. You know, the lady need to be 
cut the grass, the lady need to do some errands, this or that, we all took part. I mean for us helping the older 
people was something natural, and when we moved from Florida to Michigan in Lowell, there was another lady 
who live in the bottom of the hill where our home was, and we all loved the lady like a grandma, and we watch 
over her, and you know, she was a grandma, yeah. She was a grandma. 
I: 
So, it sounds like your mother instilled that in you. You instilled that in M. 
H: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Where did that come from?

H: 
Well, I tell you one thing, my mother was a teacher, and then we were educated in a German school, 
and the director of the school—the school was like a big family, and she has her mother. You know, the Frau 
used to be with us little ones teaching how—like for example, we learned the letters. And once we learned the 
letters, she gave us dough, and made the letter, and then we bake it. You know, and we have a cow, we have 
chickens. It was like a big family together, so you know you learn from all that. 
M: 
So, your school was multi-generational? 
H: 
Yeah. Generation to generation, and we raise our children, you know, my husband was quite older than 
me, so that means a lot to us too, you know. And I don’t know, that came from—that’s what I say I never think 
in the money, I think in the love that I can put with them, and the help that I can do [23.37] to make it easy for 
them, you know. You’re faced with so many different kind of older people—handicap or older or sick or 
whatever, you know, you try to help. Yeah. I think it’s natural. I think it’s a gift that I have. Yeah. 
I: 
What do you find most rewarding about it? 
H: 
Oh, to make them happy. Seeing them smiling. Like the lady that I work now, she was cut off in the 
beginning, you know, but now she’s happy, she enjoy, she laugh, she help [inaudible]. You know, it’s so 
rewarding. Every time we have a little, you know, [inaudible] I say we’re going to [inaudible]. “Oh, yeah, we 
have to?” [Laughing]. 
I: 
How did you get hooked up with her? 
H: 
Well, what is the story? 
M: 
She is the mother of a builder on the east side of Lansing that has decided to make a barrier free—little 
cottages if you wanna call ‘em that—in basically, almost downtown Lansing—the East Side. He had initially 
planned it to be all students, barrier free, and then his parents aged, his dad died, his mother aged, got 
Alzheimer’s, and then her siblings also were aging, and they all grew up on the east side. And he was left with 
a sizeable amount of funds from his dad to help provide for his mom and her siblings, and he’s decided to take 
those units he’s constructed, and he wound up moving his mom, her sister into one, in another unit, her sister 
and her husband—another sister and her husband live in one, and then he’s making the others available to 
other people who have lived in this neighborhood their whole lives. Those folks lived and worked in this 
neighborhood [21.25] as well, and they retired I think. Maybe moved out to the country and then came back, so 
there’s a need in this neighborhood anyway. There’s a strong sense of community. People really love this 
neighborhood, and people that are aging here want to be able to stay here as long as possible, and so people 
have approached him about being able to live in that little aging community if he has— 
H: 
It’s like it’s more community. 
I: 
It’s the Allen Street? 
M: 
Well, they’re kind of—they’re not part of Allen Street neighborhood, but it’s on Leslie and Regent. He’s 
over 10 years, I think, he’s been buying up little parcels of land and renovating some houses, and then when 
he had enough that were in bad shape, he got permission from the city—it took him 10 years to replot them, so 
all of these lots are typically 33’ wide, 120’ deep, and he got permission to put four, five, or six of those 
together, wound up with like an acre, and then instead of everybody having their own backyard, it’s like a 
communal backyard. And all the houses surround that, and he’s doing walking paths and raised flowerbeds, 
and bringing sculpture in, and just really, I want to say elevating it to a level you can’t really imagine. That we 
all dream of, but because right now the big things are these huge retirement communities where they say, “Oh, 
come to us, and you can age in place,” but they’re huge, and you’re kind of a number. I mean people are 
providing care [19.38], but at the same time there’s a lot of people—and here, this is right in your neighborhood 
kind of deal.

H: 
Yeah. 
M: 
And the goal— 
H: 
You must go and see it because it’s quite interesting. 
M: 
Well, she was. She saw those houses? 
H: 
Oh, you saw the apartments?  
M: 
Remember, we ran into her? 
H: 
Oh, great. 
M: 
So, the goal is to have community events where the whole community or locals, and not just the people 
living there will come, and that’s started to happen. They have meals on holidays, and they’re gonna have that 
little park area, and there’s also a wider range of students and professionals living in some of the units that 
take part. 
H: 
Yeah. And eventually one of those buildings is going to be a senior center. 
M: 
Yeah. 
H: 
So, altogether. 
I: 
And you’re taking care of his mother? 
H: 
Oh, his mother, yeah. 
I: 
What do you do for her? How do you help her? 
H: 
Well, they need—looks like the sister was taking care of her, but you know how things are with family 
[18.37], you know. They get kinda—they kinda holler— 
M: 
Tense. 
H: 
--to deal with each other, so the sister kind of got tired, and of course she has Alzheimer’s, so it’s kind 
of hard to live with her because, you know, she don’t remember anything. She doesn’t—she complains that 
nobody [laughing] does anything [laughing], which is cute [laughing] because like when I come in the morning I 
say, L, well you have to get up. “Why?” [Laughing] you have to go to the Helping Hand. “Oh, nobody told me.” 
[Laughing] and she goes on like that [laughing]. 
I: 
So, you help her get up, get dressed? 
H: 
So, I come in, get up, takin’ a shower, you know, from the beginning—takin’ a shower, dress up, having 
fix her breakfast, and go to the barber and then get ready for—and she has to be ready by 9:15. Her son 
comes and take her to the Helping Hands, and she spend the whole day there. She hates it [laughing]. She 
don’t like to go there [laughing] every day. “I hate that. I don’t wanna go.” [Laughing] yeah, so we try to plan, 
and you have—I don’t think they do too much with them, you know. I think she sits too long—all day long there. 
I don’t think they work person-to-person, you know, so she get tired, and she don’t like to go, but it’s a help for 
him and for the sister. The sister is very happy when nobody home [laughs]. 
I: 
M, are you taking care of somebody right now? 
M: 
Well, not so much personal care hands on, but I’m a driver, and let’s see, yard things and [16.38] some 
house maintenance, and that sort of thing. And I was very intimately involved with a woman that was 99 for 3, 
4 years, and doing a lot of care for her, and just recently lost her. And so that’s really tough.

H: 
She was a sweetheart. Oh, we miss her so much. 
I: 
Tell us, let’s jump ahead for a second, tell us about that? How do you handle it when a person that 
you’ve grown close to, been with for so long dies? 
M: 
It’s devastating. 
H: 
Yeah. 
M: 
For—at least for me because I tend to get really attached [15.53]. 
H: 
Yeah. That’s what we—our  heart goes with them, see. So, we get attached to them. 
M: 
So, every time it happens, I swear I’m not gonna do it anymore [laughs] ‘cause it’s so life disrupting, 
you know. And that’s really hard especially when you’ve been with ‘em for a number of years, and what tends 
to happen is that even if they have family, there’s always a little friction between family and the individual. It’s 
normal. I mean we all have that in our own families. You know, we love to see our families. We can spend a 
lotta time together, but sometimes at a certain point, like, okay, I need a break. Some people, you know, if 
they’re elderly and they have—this woman was 99. 
H: 
She was so sweet. She got such a good disposition, so I’ll go and she’s ready for anything. I mean like 
you never think her age because she was ready for anything. Anything that we wanna go, she’d say wonderful, 
and do it [laughing]. 
M: 
We took her on our last vacation. She was born up in Copper Country, and her family was part of the 
folks who own some of the iron ore mines up there, and we took her up for her last run around Copper Country 
and the Museums and looking at the places, the parks she went to as a child, and you know, it was really a 
wonderful trip. 
H: 
It was a good experience for us because, you know, we went all the places that she was when she was 
young and tell us about it. I mean, would you say 99? No. She was full of life. Full of life. 
M: 
She could climb up to the lighthouses. We went to the one that the stairs are all on the outside and the 
wind was blowing, and she didn’t even weigh a 100 pounds, and everybody— 
H: 
[Laughing] no. 
M: 
--was worried she’d literally get blown off [group laughter], you know. She said, “Oh, I used to come out 
here and sunbathe when I was a teenager, “[laughing] and it was like she was still a teenager, and she just 
marched up those stairs. She could barely hear. She could hardly see anymore because of the macular 
degeneration, but her mind and her memories were amazing.  
H: 
Wonderful [13.38]. 
M: 
And it was really a gift— 
H: 
Yeah. That was a gift. 
M: 
--working with her. She was really a sweet, sweet— 
H: 
She was very dear to us, very dear to us. 
M: 
--she was an art teacher all of her life and taught anybody and everybody who came near her how to be 
artistic. Just how to release—how to tap into your art and taught my mom and I how to weave. I mean she 
gave as much to us as we gave to her.

I: 
 And you took care of her in her own home? She was— 
M: 
In her own home, yup. 
H: 
Yeah. 
M: 
She lived on Hamilton Road. She—my goodness, she survived the suicide of her first husband, I think 
the unexpected death of a son, and the aging and death of her second husband, but people who knew her 
described her second marriage as Shangri-La, and Camelot. They had a beautiful year. She often provided her 
yard as a place for weddings. She reached out to the Asian community at MSU and had a lotta friends there 
and hosted a lot of events, and she was very popular in the Okemos Library. Very busy drawing up lots of 
posters. They had a massive honor—recognition ceremony of all the work she’d done, and there was probably 
over a 100/150 posters that she had drawn for all of their fundraisers. 
H: 
She was an artist. 
M: 
She was an artist. She did caricatures. 
H: 
She skated. 
M: 
Oh, she ice-skated until she was 96 I think. 
H: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
M: 
Or 94, yeah. 
I: 
She sounds fiercely independent, so what kind of help did you give her? 
M: 
Well, like I said, she could barely see, and— 
H: 
Hear. 
M: 
--hear, so you had to, you know, make things as [11.33] easy for her as possible. When I was hired, her 
home was not the safest, so we put up a lotta handrails, we got rid of the throw rugs. We put yellow or 
reflective types of tapes in different places. She had peripheral vision, but not a whole lot of central vision. She 
was already aware of Commission for the Blind that provides all kinds of free services to people who are losing 
their vision, but we set up email for her, and she still needed pretty much someone to do it because even 
though she could type, the whole send and save and all that stuff, opening the email, that was a little harder for 
her. So, somebody would come in and help her with that. She could still weave on a massive loom. She had 
two massive looms in her home, and she would weave place mats and carpets and scarves and towards the 
end she wasn’t doing as much in the way of wall-hangings, but she liked to incorporate nature—sticks and 
bones and things like that into the weavings, and she was a long-term member of the— 
H: 
She was very creative. 
M: 
--of the Weaver’s Guild, but you know, she also, like many elderly, didn’t know when she had a urinary 
track infection, and so needed to monitor her diet and her food intake and liquid intake and output. And if she 
took a fall, that could be, you know, tough. She actually tore her rotator cuff when she fell, and so she had an 
arm in a sling for a while, and that really challenged her life because she had to learn to eat with her left hand 
at 97 or 98, you know. But this is a woman who every day she wanted to shower. She couldn’t wait to jump in 
the shower. She had to shower every single day. 
I: 
And you helped her with that. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18

M: 
And I helped her do all that. You know, and I—we started out showering, you know, I tried to stand on 
the outside of the walk-in shower, and I’d get pretty wet, and she always loved her hair scrubbed, her scalp 
scrubbed real hard, and finally she said, “Oh, just come on in.” And I said, all right, B. I’ll come in. 
H: 
[Laughing] 
M: 
You know, [laughs]. She says, “I can’t see anyway. Don’t worry about it,” and I’m not very shy, so it was 
just easier to shed the clothes instead of dealing with a bathing suit or whatever, and I would just jump in. And 
we used to tease that I really had the best job in the world because I happen to be married to a woman and 
prefer women in my life, and so I would tell her I had the Lesbian’s perfect job. I got to shower naked with 
another woman, and I got paid for it every day. 
H: 
[Laughing]. 
M: 
[Laughing]. 
H: 
She was so spark. We loved it. 
M: 
She was so funny. 
H: 
We miss her a lot. 
M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
One of the things that is different about your situation is that you are not doing this through an agency. 
M: 
No. We are not. 
I: 
I’m guessing an agency wouldn’t have allowed that [laughing]? 
M: 
Probably not. That’s— 
I: 
That’s not on the job description. 
M: 
--part of why I don’t work with an agency because there are so many— 
H: 
Regulations. 
M: 
--regulations and rules, and I remember some people that I worked with [7.49] that then required more 
than I give, and so the family brought in an agency, and it would snow a little, and I would drive by and call and 
say, you guys, you need to sweep the snow, shovel the snow. “Well, we can’t shovel.” Well, in an emergency if 
you need to evacuate the home, you need to have it safe for this person to be able to get out. “Well, we’re not 
allowed to shovel. We can sweep, but we can’t shovel.” It’s like, okay, then you’re gonna have to sweep every 
10 minutes because it’s comin’ down like crazy [group laughter]. You know, I don’t know. There’s good things 
about agencies because absolutely one person being the person to provide all the care for somebody who 
winds up requiring a lotta care is not easy or healthy or manageable, but by the same token sometimes the 
agencies, as we all know corporations in an effort to minimize litigation just get crazy. You know and hire 
people who are not physically fit to do some of the things that are required with the job. And that’s unaccept—
that’s why I haven’t grown my company [laughs]. 
H: 
[Laughs] 
M: 
It’s jut me, momma, maybe one or two other people I know or trust. We don’t— 
I: 
Over the years you’ve had a number of people that you’ve called in for help? 
M: 
Yes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18

I: 
You have to have some backup help, right? 
M: 
Yes. I’ve got backup. I’ve got people that can come in for me, absolutely. But I’m the one who trains 
‘em, I’m the one who, you know, I have very high expectations. This isn’t a show up, say hello, sit down and 
watch TV, which sometimes is what a lotta people do. 
I: 
What are your expectations? 
M: 
I expect people to treat the person for whom we’re providing service to like they were family, and that’s 
really, you know, mom has taught me, that’s really the best way to describe it because if you treat ‘em like 
they’re family, then you’re automatically gonna respect, you’re automatically going to— 
H: 
Love. 
M: 
--you know, have a warmth that very often turns into love for them, and you’re going to want the best for 
them. You’re gonna wanna work with them. You’re gonna wanna acknowledge what they want and put that 
first as opposed to what your priorities may be and like in the case with my mom where she has to try and 
encourage someone to walk who sometimes doesn’t wanna walk, you’re gonna find ways to make it fun. 
You’re gonna try and incorporate—turn it into a game. You’re gonna try and meet them where they’re at and 
bring them along instead of just walking in and laying down the law [4.48]. You know, I work with a woman right 
now who has some significant hoarding issues, and anyone who’s tried to help her usually quits because she’s 
very, very hard to work with. She has a very terse personality. She can come across as very mean or uncaring, 
and it’s a real challenge, but I’m also someone who likes to hold onto things, and so I understand why it’s 
stressful to her to get the house cleaned, why she doesn’t wanna throw something away. It’s tough. Even I 
make mistakes. I was charged with mailing something, and it was put in a box and the box was too big, and I 
took it to UPS, and we mailed it in an envelope, and I came back without the box not thinking, you know, we’ll 
recycle it. Well, at her age recycle means to her find another use for it within your home, not have it become 
part of a disposal issue for the community. So, she was quite upset that I didn’t come back with the box. 
I: 
So, what kinda skills does that require to work with somebody like that? 
M: 
A whole lot a patience [laughing]. A lot of patience, a lot of recognition that— 
H: 
Respect. 
M: 
--those behaviors are sometimes rooted in other sorts of trauma. She happens to have a PhD in 
psychology. She knows she has issues, so you know, it’s just recognizing that we all handle our stresses and 
our trauma differently, and so we don’t try to judge it. We just try and work with it. 
I: 
We’re gonna stop in just a second, but do you have something to add to that story about how do you 
handle difficult clients—people that are kind of hard to work with? 
H: 
Well, like M say, you find your way. See, it is kind of like, okay. For example, we are talking, I say, we 
have to go and walk. “No. I don’t wanna walk.” I say, wait a minute. We have to walk because the pain that you 
got in your knee is a lack of exercise. We have to move that. Now, we go and take a little walk. ”Oh, I wanna sit 
down.” Yeah. Well, we’ll walk. When we come back we just sit. “I don’t wanna walk that far.” Okay. We try a 
little bit farther, okay. And kind of play with that, and then lift your foot, and do this, do that, and in no time she’s 
gonna be on the other side of the walk [laughing] [2.04]. 
I: 
You have to work with them. 
H: 
You have to work with them. 
I: 
Be creative, be patient. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18

H: 
Creative, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I get the problem with her when you say, “I don’t wanna do this. I don’t 
wanna do that,” is because of that relationship with her sister. They all the time are like that, you know. But you 
know, I found my way to get in and I explain her, and this and that. So, she kind of give, you know, but you 
have to have— 
I: 
It’s a skill. It’s a talent. 
H: 
And, you know, I kind of played with her, you know. Like for example [laughs], when I take her for a 
shower, you know, I approach her, and I say all clean [laughing]. “Oh, you surprised me [laughing].” So, she 
laugh, you know. It’s good to see them laugh, you know. She laugh. Like today was funny because I make her 
sit on the couch and we are lifted the legs, and stretch, and you stretch and do like that, like you kick, so you’re 
knees work, you know, and she’s doing okay. So, then [inaudible] and I bump, she [inaudible].  I used to do 
that to my kids. Oh, she laughed! She laughed! [Laughing] and it’s so good to see that, you know. It’s so good 
to know that [makes angry sound]. 
M: 
And not being family frees us up to have a broader range of experience to bring into the situation than 
family members. Family members are tied down with—or weighted down with all the emotional stuff. 
H: 
Yeah. I mean so many [.35] people they think you are old, that’s just the nature. You are done. You are 
living. You [inaudible]. You’re ready to go. You’re just ready to go, and I don’t believe in that. You have life. You 
know, every day. Why because you are—we are that same age. It’s 87. I 87, you know, so I say, no, no, no. 
We have a lot to give, you know. We can do a lot. 
I: 
Well, we’re gonna stop just for a moment while K does his thing. 
M: 
Okay. 
I: 
Then we’ll start up again [end tape 1]. We’re gonna shift gears a little bit. You mentioned that you train 
your own workers. We were just talking about training. What kind of training do you give your workers? 
M: 
Well, we have to make sure that they have basic first aid, CPR. I like the folks that I work with to have a 
chauffer’s license just because it’s a little bit added, you know, requirement of the job if you’re driving people to 
appointments, that sort of thing [23.58]. But probably more than anything is getting at the fact that you’re not 
just there for physical needs. You’re not just there to make sure people have clean clothes, they’re hygiene is 
taken care of. You know, like we were talking a minute ago, you’re there—as important if not in some cases 
more important is the person’s state of mind, and usually when we get called in the family is at their utmost wits 
end, end of the rope kind of—they’ve tried everything, and our culture, unfortunately, doesn’t seem to really 
support multigenerational familial involvement. A long time ago it did before we were so mobile, but a lot of the 
seniors that I work with say they were very successful in showing their kids the West Coast, and then they all 
moved out there, and they’re nowhere around to help with care. Or they were very successful in getting ‘em 
through school and having great jobs, but now they all have jobs and families that don’t have time for them to 
provide care. So, right off, when you get called in, there’s already a heavy, emotional—what do I wanna say—
landscape that’s been ravaged. And as a worker, understanding that, and trying to heal that, is as important as 
knowing that the person needs some physical therapy, some regular movement, some motivation to walk, 
brush their teeth, whatever it may be, is understanding that, yeah, they don’t get along with x, y, and z in the 
family. And if we minimize that, you know, try to provide other options for them to interact that aren’t focused 
on care, then maybe those relationships can kind of be rebuilt or healed in some ways. 
I: 
So, talk for just a moment about being self-employed because you have to negotiate your own labor 
conditions, your own wages, and hours, and you need to go in and figure out what it is this person needs, and 
what are the family relationships, and all of that. You don’t have an agency doing all of that for you, so is that 
something that you primarily do, M?

M: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You figure all this stuff out? 
M: 
Yeah. I usually meet with the family and the individual, and I get a sense of the environment we’re 
working in, and I believe that the care that we provide is a level and a quality beyond that which an agency 
provides, so I usually let people know from the top we’re not—we’re not covered by—typically, we’re not 
covered by any insurance plans, and if you go to an agency you’re paying, in this area, you’re paying $25 to 
$30 an hour for an agency. Where the individual doing the work is only getting maybe $8.50 to $10 an hour, 
and then the agency is eating the rest of that for all of their liability insurance and all of that. And I’m just real 
honest with folks and say, I take some risks. I don’t just work for anybody. I need to know them pretty well 
[20.23] or they need to know me and my family because we don’t have liability insurance. We, you know, could 
be sued. So, I’m very careful about who we pick, and who picks us. We also let them know that, again, the 
individualized care that they’re gonna get through us is real different, and we’re pretty much on call. So, when I 
describe the kinda care, they’ve usually met somebody else that I work with who’s referred them, and that 
reference—and they can check and talk with other people, and they’re usually pretty okay with paying the $25 
an hour. But again, that means that I work with four people who have means. There’s a whole lot of people out 
there who need good care who don’t have the means and are hiring people through the Department of Social 
Services. I’ve worked with a lot of those people before when I was doing case management for people with 
disabilities, and the problem there is some of those folks can do criminal things and get removed from one site, 
and that information is not passed along, and they can wind up employed in another site with another 
vulnerable person and turn around and do the exact same thing. And so, there’s a lot of issues around 
checking backgrounds, and how do we do better at providing tracking. 
I: 
So, you get a higher wage than the vast majority of personal care workers, but there are trade-offs. 
M: 
Absolute trade-offs. 
I: 
In that you’re solo. 
M: 
Yup. 
I: 
It’s not like you have a staff backing you up. 
M: 
Right. I have one or two other people that, you know, in an emergency can back me up, but we don’t 
have a deep bench as they say. So, sometimes as the person starts to require 24-hours of care, sometimes 
I’m no longer the option.  
I: 
And then what happens? 
M: 
Well, the family has to decide if they’re going to look at a facility or if they’re going to—I have created in 
a sense 24-hour care by enabling the person—the elderly person who might have a large home to make 
available a bedroom to someone who we call a community companion who needs housing, so we’ll do 
interviews, and we’ll try to thoroughly check those folks out, and that person agrees to move in and live with 
the senior, and depending on the situation they may or may not have care requirements, but they are there at 
night in case of an emergency. And that works pretty well. My friend who was 99, who I was telling you about 
earlier, she once was getting ready for bed on a night where no one was gonna come in, you know, and she 
fell in the kitchen, and she had an alarm system that she could ring that would ring the bell down in the 
basement and roused the person who was down there living with her to come up and assist her. And so that 
person knows that, you know, they’re expected to be in between the hours of—again, depends on the person, 
but it can be 8 pm to 6 am, or it can be midnight to 8 in the morning, but they come home. It’s where they live. 
They’re not expected to provide hands-on care, but they are expected to provide comradery and a little—what

Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18

do I wanna say—the ability [16.31] to intervene in an emergency, to get called up, “I’ve fallen.” Do a quick 
assessment, you know, call the ambulance, call family, get those things going. 
I: 
And then you pay that person, or they pay them directly? 
M: 
No. They, depending again on how well off the senior is, they may give them very reduced rent in 
exchange for that service. You know, so. 
I: 
So, let me throw out a few other situations that might be challenging that I know workers have—I’m 
sorry, companions have talked about. Have you ever gotten into a situation where it was just sort of over your 
head and you weren’t really sure how to handle it? You’re situation’s a little different because you know the 
people so well before you even get involved. 
M: 
Yeah. I tend to know, and as a retired social worker, I kind of have a broader support knowledge base 
than a lotta folks do, but you know on occasion something can present itself. Sometimes someone who’s 
particularly ornery or angry, is having a bad day, and you walk in to help, or they’ve been chewed out by a 
family member, and so you’re the next person to come in, and you’re the dog they wanna kick because they 
just got kicked. So, sometimes there’s an emotional or verbally abusive environment that you can unknowingly 
walk into, and as much as I know and get along with who I work with, that’s a common problem. If they were at 
the bottom of the food chain and somehow got chewed out, and I’ve had that happen where the adult daughter 
just apparently had her own bad day and came in and just really ragged on her mom and left her just really 
raw. And they leave, and I come in, and next thing I know she’s chewin’ me out, and that’s tough because you 
have to—you have to be professional, and you can’t just fight back like a family member might defend 
themselves and, you know, you don’t wanna have a throw down, but there are times where you will be 
insulted. You will be yelled at. You may be ridiculed. You may be, you know, I’ve even been in a situation 
where a family member has actually intentionally run into me, kind of body-checked me on the way out 
because of jealousies and that often happens. Jealousies that develop, and so you don’t know what you’re 
gonna walk into, you know. And that can be very difficult. 
I: 
Have you had situations like that? 
H: 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you have to be very careful. Yeah. You have to be very careful. Some 
times kind of a competition, you know, maybe you think you are takin’ their place or you’re one to [inaudible], 
you know, and they be jealous. 
I: 
Can you give an example? Can you think of a story? 
H: 
Well, right now with this lady, you know, like I say. They don’t get along—the two sisters don’t get along 
together, and I come one morning, and she is not in a good mood [12.42], but I don’t say anything, and I 
started my routine, and this and that. Finally, we go to the dining table, and we’re going to have breakfast, and 
she say, “They throw me out of house.” And the sister was there. She heard. I say, this is not nice to say. The 
sister say to her, “That’s not nice to say.” “Oh, yeah. They don’t want me be here anymore. They throw me 
out.” And I, you know, say, now, they may be misunderstood. Maybe something—“No, they do not—
[inaudible]”—love you. You know you are special to all of us, and you know, kinda—but she was upset. She 
was mad. She was really. Yeah. She get touchy very easy, you know. Like I said for example, when I get in 
and say, L, it’s time to get up. “Nobody told me that I was to get up early, but I am up. I already up for an hour 
or so, and nobody tell me anythin’.” Okay. That’s okay. Today, I say, we can’t walk too much because your son 
come to take you to the Helping Hand. “Nobody told me to be ready!” And when he came and say, “Hello, 
mom,” she don’t answer. She ignore him, so then he say again, “Hello, mom.” [Laughing]. She say, “You didn’t 
tell me that I have to be ready.” “Oh, I’m sorry I forgot. Now I be more careful and let you know.”

I: 
How about people who are—and it’s probably family members ‘cause you screen your clients so well, 
but who have different beliefs than you do who— 
M: 
Oh, that’s been interesting especially in the situation my mom’s in now because when her son 
contacted me to come and see if [10.49] I would be interested and how it might work if we provided services, 
he said—he was very upfront, and he said, “This’ll be good for my family because they’ve lived a pretty 
sheltered life, and they haven’t had a lot of exposure to people from other cultures or other sexual preferences 
or different lifestyles or whatever.” So, sure enough one of the gentlemen that I work with he—let me see—his 
aunt’s husband or his uncle needed personal care, and I said let me see. I think I can find a male, so I called 
my friend up, and he’s willing and he happens to be African American, and the son said to me, “This is gonna 
be great because they really need their horizons broadened,” and it turns out that my wife is doing the program 
organization and sort of the paperwork end of things of the program that he wants to start there. He hired her 
to do that. He used me as a resource broker to pull together some help in the home, and you know, we’re 
Columbian, so suddenly this very sheltered family who had never really had African Americans or people from 
other countries in their life, and certainly no one from a same-sex family preference—spousal preference 
present, and they really took a liking to my partner—my wife, L., she’s very calm and quiet and organized and 
sweet, and they started taking opportunity to ask. And they asked if it would be all right, “Can we ask 
questions.” And I mean they grilled her. They just grilled her— 
H: 
[Laughing] 
M: 
--on how we met, how long we’ve been together, when we got married, how did we adopt children, why 
did we adopt African American children? You name it, there’s all kinds of questions, and they’re very—it’s 
really fun because they prefaced their questions with, “We don’t want to offend you, but we just wanna know,” 
and it’s become a nice, you know, it’s kinda like we should have these sort of gatherings on a regular basis 
for— 
H: 
[Laughing] 
M: 
--the society at large. Where people aren’t offended by the questions, and people can feel free to ask 
questions [laughing] because there’s a whole lot of educating going’ on [laughing]. 
H: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Well, it sounds like in that situation it’s not a negative thing at all? 
M: 
No. 
H: 
Yeah. Right, right. 
M: 
No. It’s turned out to be very positive. 
H: 
Kind of opened the ice you know. Kind of see different things. 
M: 
But early on it was a very kind of tap dance [7.50]. They’d take a step, and then, you know, and in other 
situations I’ve had that happen where they’ll go, “Well, we’ll just have to see how it goes,” and you can almost 
see the defense mechanisms in the first few interactions all present, all keeping the defenses up, all people 
taking sort of measured steps. Well, I don’t know if I want that person to have a key to my house— 
H: 
No. 
M: 
--or I don’t know if I want that person to know where I keep my checkbook, you know. And these are all 
very natural concerns for anybody who’s welcoming people they don’t know very well into their daily lives. So, 
when I say it makes absolute sense, you don’t have to, you know. You can just give me the check every time I 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18 
 
11
come to go shopping. You can have it made out and get to the store, and just put that it’s—my name on the 
bottom, so I’m handing over a check that doesn’t have my name at the top, and I’m explaining that I work for 
somebody. They’re like, “Oh, okay, so you don’t want me to give you cash?” I said, no. There’s no reason you 
can give me cash. I’ll put the amount in there, and I’ll bring you back—nowadays with electronic checking, you 
bring the check back anyway, so you can see exactly how much it was made out for. You can compare it to the 
receipt. You know, but sometimes I can take a little bit longer— 
H: 
Yeah. 
M: 
--when there’s a lot of differences in what’s expected and to develop that trust base, you know. 
I: 
Sure. It’s a lot about building trust. 
H: 
I’ve got another thing that I can think too, is for example, I and a person who say okay. When I talk to 
them, they want me for 2 hours. Okay. Fine. But to me time don’t mean anything because I come to do things 
for them, and you know, spend time with her and this and that [5.54], so I stay. I don’t leave right away at 10. I 
mean, no, you know, no. I take my time. I take my time. The sister got a surgery in her back, and after she 
recovered she got a lot of discomfort in her back, and I say I can give you a massage. “Oh, no. I don’t wanna 
take your time.” I said, you are not paying me your time. “I paid you.” No, you don’t have to pay me. I just 
wanna help you, so massage you and relax you, and we talk a little bit, and you relax, and that’s it. “Oh, how 
you can do that?” I say because I like you. I love your sister and have time. You know, everything is—because 
the other people who work from 4 to 6 or 8 to 9 or whatever, boom, boom. I don’t watch—I know I come early 
and I don’t know when I leave [laughing]. 
I: 
People aren’t used to that. 
M: 
No [laughing]. 
H: 
No, people are not used to that. [Laughs] no. And the same thing for example there are things that she 
needs, and you know like for example. She got socks that were too tight. Her legs swell a lot, and the socks 
were very tight, and I keep on telling her you need a new pair. [Inaudible] so I went out and bought ‘em. I bring 
it. “Oh, how much was that?” I said, no. It’s a mother’s present to her. “No, no, no, no, you have to tell us how 
much and we pay.” No. You know, it’s just the little things-money, money—no. To me money don’t mean 
anything. I need it, but it’s not a main factor. 
I: 
So, you bought her some socks. She needed different socks. 
H: 
I bought her some socks. Yeah. 
I: 
So, you bought her some socks. 
H: 
Yeah. I bought her some socks. 
I: 
She wanted to pay you back. 
H: 
Yeah. And I didn’t want the money back. Then she complained her [laughing]—and I knew they were 
very tight. 
I: 
The old ones. 
M: 
Mmm hmm. 
H: 
She had hard time to pull it up because, you know, of course they wash and they put it in the dryer 
there—so [inaudible] when we take a shower she said, “Oh, it’s too tight. Well, I don’t like that.” And I told the 
sister. Nothing is done. I went and brought. “Oh, how much you pay?” Blah, blah. I say, no, it’s a present.

[Inaudible -laughing] surprised both of them, I bought the soap, hand lotion or whatever, you know, so it’s not 
just her. That’s my mother present for you today. “Oh, no, no—”, it’s like you never—“Who’s doing this? Why?” 
I: 
Yeah. That’s not how we usually operate especially if people are used to agencies, and you know, 
those boundaries are pretty strict. 
M: 
The boundaries are strict, and the other issue is just American self-sufficiency [3.05] is so hammered 
into everybody that I think as we are removed more and more generations away from—you want me to stop 
here—from the immigrants that most of us are, that American independence and self-sufficiency winds up 
sometimes limiting the quality of the relationship, and it takes a while to whittle that down or let it erode a little 
bit. I had one of the people I was helping tell me—she was chewing me out because she’d gotten chewed out, 
and her daughter had chewed her out because we used too many towels when we shower. Too many towels. 
We went [laughing] too many towels? And I was just shocked because when you shower somebody the 
biggest concern with a senior is that they will fall. So, yes, as soon as that water—sometimes even if the 
water’s running, and the tub for whatever reason maybe slick, you make take a hand towel and throw it down 
there, so they have something to step on that can be easily washed and whatever, and it provides safety. You 
know, and then in this particular case it was a big bathroom, so we turned on the heat early on, but they’re 
always cold. That’s the other thing. You can count on two main things—fear of falling and being cold. No 
matter how much you heat that bathroom, so I had lots of towels ready to wrap the person in as soon as they 
get out, so they’re drying off as quickly as possible, and you’re not reusing a wet side of the towel on an 
already chilled part of the body. You want a dry towel, and then I got chewed out ‘cause we were using too 
many towels. 
I: 
Were you able to explain? 
M: 
Well, unfortunately, that’s the situation where I would often explain in writing because that daughter was 
so—what do I wanna say? She just really didn’t like [pause]—well, I guess she didn’t like me. She didn’t like 
the sweet spot that her step-mother and I had developed, and that was a very difficult situation, so I tended to 
put everything in writing so that she would have her own time and space to read it and react to it without 
jumping on me or jumping on her step-mom about it. 
I: 
I’m gonna stop there just for a minute and let K do his thing. 
H: 
Right. Yeah. 
I: 
And then we’ll talk— 
H: 
No problem. 
I: 
--have a final section. 
H: 
That’s fine [end tape 2]. 
I: 
Okay, so we’re gonna turn again to a slightly different perspective here and talk about the kind of work 
that you’re doing, your profession in the bigger picture. 
H: 
Uh-huh. 
I: 
And I think it’s pretty common knowledge that our society doesn’t really value the work that you do very 
highly, and that’s evident in a lot of the things that people say. Are you—if somebody asks you what do you do 
for a living, what do you say? You say, “I’m a personal caregiver, or I’m a homecare worker or?” 
M: 
I usually say I enjoy helping the elderly [25.27] meet their needs because the word personal care, 
although it’s right on, it’s not where the person who’s being helped wants to focus. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18

I: 
Explain that to me? 
M: 
When you have surgery and you need help for those few weeks after surgery, the last thing you wanna 
say is, “Yeah, I can’t wipe my butt anymore,” or “I need help showering,” or “I can’t feed myself,” or whatever. 
In today’s parlance what we say is, “Well, I need to go to rehab for a few weeks.” And that has such a better 
tone to it. You’re going to rehab, so they’re going to help you get back the functioning that you’ve lost, and 
you’re not focusing on what that functioning is. So, the word personal care sometimes looks at the deficit as 
opposed to the skills that the person still has, and so that’s part of why I’ve never been crazy about the term. 
When we are all in our careers or our lives, whatever path we choose, and we describe what it is we do, we 
don’t usually focus on what it is we need to do. If I’m a social worker, that’s what I say. I don’t say, you know, 
that I work with a disenfranchised group of people who can’t meet their own needs. I say I’m a social worker, 
and so when I tell people what it is I do—I help seniors meet their needs. And that also gives them the right to 
say—to prioritize what those needs [23.34] are. Yes, there may be personal care involved in it, but that isn’t 
what they like to talk about or what I like to talk about.  
H: 
[Laughs]. 
M: 
We like to talk about what I learned from them [laughs], what they learn from me. Sometimes it might 
be a scrabble game at the end of a shift, or a walk, you know, because the person doesn’t hear much, but she 
can hear real high-pitched bird sounds, and so her goal is to get out early in the morning when the birds are 
still singing, and so she can hear that, and she doesn’t care what the weather is because she was an ice-
skater, and she was raised up north in Copper Country, and she will dress to be warm. And people go by and 
say, “How in the world are you daring to walk a 99-year-old when there’s fresh snow or some potential ice 
that,” you know, and that’s something she and I have negotiated. It’s like can I absolutely stop you from falling? 
I can certainly break the fall. I don’t know if I can stop the fall, but here’s what we’re gonna do, and here’s what 
we assure the family of. We have my cell phone on 911. Other people see us out and about. A lotta neighbors 
know we’re going. They keep an eye on us. The particular little area that you live in is very good about snow 
removal, and you have a wonderful path, and most people clean it and salt it, and the more people see us out, 
the more people are driven to clean it and salt it. So, it becomes more of a communal approach to meeting her 
needs than just, I’m sorry. It’s too dangerous, you can’t go out and walk in that weather. So, that her need is to 
be able to hear what she still can hear, which is those birds, and to be active and out, and enjoying the fresh 
air no matter if it’s 20 below, and my job is to dress [laughing] appropriately and be able to help her do that 
[21.28]. 
H: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
That’s a great story. You started to tell me a story. 
H: 
Oh, yeah. I wanted to tell you, you know, like I say, every morning after she has breakfast and 
everything, we’d dress up to go out for a walk, and there are some kids who lived in the area, but they use the 
path of the apartments close by to wait for the bus. And one day the kids come, they’re maybe 10, 8-years-old, 
and one got [inaudible] with the violin, and I approached him, and say, oh, you play the violin? He said, “Yup, 
very plainly.” 
I: 
He has a violin? 
H: 
Yeah. He has a violin, and I say can you play for us? And she say, “Sure.” She got out the tiny little 
violin, and she start playing. You must see the joy. She play Mary has a Little Lamb. So, she [the client] 
remembers that, and she’s still singing. Oh, that was so beautiful [20.33]. That was so beautiful. I wish we 
recorded that or photographed it. She was sitting there clapping and singing, and the other [laughing]—that 
was so great, and now when we see the boy—I don’t know if they go there every day. I don’t know what the 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18 
 
14
schedule, but when we see him, I say where is the violin? The other day he forgot, so he has to go to the 
house. He has to bring the violin, and he was ready to play when the bus came [laughing]. 
I: 
Hopefully, other changes. What you’re talking about is not just personal care as you’re saying— 
H: 
Yeah. 
I: 
It’s about quality of life. 
M: 
Quality of life. 
H: 
Yeah, you know, to me she had a smile, and being part of, you know, coming out, you know, because 
she always was withdrawn, and you know, kind of like that. She was, oh, that means a lot. Oh, I feel it—that’s 
the best thing, you know, and to me that means so much that I want to share with the sister, I wanna share 
with the son. “Oh, okay.” [Laughs] [19.25]. 
M: 
[Laughs] 
H: 
I said to me it’s something big [laughing]. 
M: 
Yeah. 
H: 
That’s the biggest step, you know, that she takes part, and we walk we talk about and I ask her, 
because, you know, her mind cannot remember anything. I say—and I start asking, how many brothers and 
sisters you got? And she start thinking, and I say this and that talk about family, and she used to work in the 
bank and what she used to do, and all of a sudden, she comes and goes, comes and goes. But [inaudible] with 
the conversation, you know, might have to think about—I don’t know [inaudible] she remembers. Then she say 
something, you know, and it is so wonderful. I feel so rewarded, you know, [laughing], she responded to me. 
I: 
You have some special skills. 
H: 
Well, I think it’s the joy. Like I told him because, well, you know, it’s something. “I just spent too many 
hours.” Oh, blah, blah, blah. I say, I love her. I love her, and I take care of her as if it was my mother. 
I: 
You talked about your mother earlier, you treat each client as if she were your mother. 
H: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You wanna say more about that? 
H: 
Well, the way like, what? 
I: 
When you were talking about how you wanna treat people as they were your mother. 
H: 
Because, like I say to you before, I miss my mother very much. We were very good friends like the 
relation we had with M, and all of a sudden, she gone. You know, and that’s why I have M, because I really 
don’t, you know, have also the people and everything, but sometimes are missed to you, you know. And so, 
when she comes, and I tell her, and I tell him, I say, I don’t look at her like I work for her. I do that because I 
think it’s my sister or my mother, you know, and they kind of—I know they appreciate, but at the same time 
they say, “What’s she doing?” All those little things mean too much [17.15]—a lot to me, you know.  
I: 
What do you say to people or what do you think about people who call the work that you do low-skilled 
or unskilled? 
M: 
[Laughing].

H: 
I don’t know, like I say, they have a lady who come and cook for them, but like I say, 4 to 6, 4 o’clock, 6 
o’clock, out! Then they have another lady—I decide to take Friday off because I like to spend some time in my 
garden, and I was [inaudible], and you know, come and relax [laughing]. Oh, I think like too much [inaudible – 
laughing] get up early [laughing], so I like Friday off, you know. So, anyway she comes and, you know, 
[inaudible] on it. I show her what to do, but I want to give love, you know, love. Eh, eh. 
M: 
Yeah. I think the biggest challenge is how do you maintain quality of life for people who are aging that 
we as a society, unfortunately, no longer value. 
H: 
Yeah. That’s the thing. 
M: 
That’s the—it’s almost like, you know, you’re asking people to take a path that isn’t maintained. In this 
culture of ours, with all of our focus on upward mobility, and electronics, and so on and so forth, unfortunately, 
the human aspect has sort of been sidelined. And so, you have—it’s easy to forget that the people that are in 
the most need right now and will be in these next 30 years or 20 years of this kind of assistance, these were 
the bankers, the teachers, the mailmen or mailwomen, the school bus drivers, they were the nitty-gritty of 
making this society work and function. They were the state employees, they were the Secretary of State 
people, they were the grocery tellers, they were the, you know, the newspaper delivery. I mean it’s—and it’s 
just so easy to forget that [14.46] because now they’re not contributing, and so they kind of wind up in your 
peripheral vision, and if anybody knows and is a driver, you know how easy it is to miss what’s in our 
peripheral vision. You can come up to a stop sign or a yield sign and you’re convinced you’ve cleared the way, 
and you take off and suddenly somebody sweeps in a speed you weren’t expecting, and now you have a 
massive accident, and they just popped out of your peripheral vision. But as long as they stay in the peripheral 
vision, they don’t require your attention, and that’s probably the hardest part about trying to meet the needs of 
the elderly. I have a lotta friends who say, “I start everyday reading the obits, checking the age,” and you know, 
I don’t look at the age, I look at what they did. Okay, so they served in the military, and then they became a 
professor, or then they, you know, ran a funeral home. I mean if you think about it every job anybody does just 
comes down to one thing. You’re getting paid to do something for somebody. That’s what it boils down to. 
Every job. It doesn’t matter if you’re cleaning the streets or if you’re in Congress. You’re getting paid to do 
something for somebody, and what we need to convey is that just because they’re no longer doing it, doesn’t 
mean they no longer have value. And how do you keep the quality of the help that they need in line with the 
quality of the life that they experienced? That’s all we all want, right? I mean as soon as we hit that point, aren’t 
we all gonna want that? Isn’t that what we want for ourselves and for our family? So, how do those in power 
recognize the importance of that and set it up so that it’s no longer in your peripheral vision, that you recognize 
that with baby boomers aging we need to move it from peripheral vision. We need to stop saying I’m the only 
one dealing with an elderly parent and put it in our primary focus and realize if I’m dealing with my parent, 9 of 
the 10 people I know have parent issues as well. How can we make a better quality of life? How can we go 
from, oh, you can’t go to the theatre because you don’t have a ticket to—geez, the theater’s half empty. Look 
at all the tickets that are available. How can we get those tickets out to the people who, now, at this point in 
their life that’s all they really want, is to be able to go to the theatre, and look at all the empty seats? Whether 
it’s the elderly or the kids in school, we have so many resources that we’re wasting, that we’re literally washing 
down a drain or throwing down a food—what do you call those things that chew up your— 
I: 
Disposal. 
M: 
Disposal. Right. You know, and we’re so accustomed to doing it [11.39] because in this culture we only 
want the best, so whether I’m workin’ at Home Depot and all of a sudden seven racks of plants have been 
overwatered and they don’t look quite as good, they all have to be thrown away. They can’t donate them to 
Habitat who could turn around and give them to their low-income home owners. They can’t give ‘em to the 
neighborhoods in bloom, so that neighborhoods and beautify their own little neighborhoods. I mean it’s just—
we have to get away from the waste issue and move seniors and children who are in peripheral—people’s

peripheral vision to the center of the focus of our lawmaking and the quality of services we provide. When we 
do that, we’re gonna have a society that is absolutely mind-blowing. 
I: 
And how do we do that? Do you have ideas? 
M: 
Well, I think, you know, hearing these stories is a big step. I think this reminds me a lot of what public 
TV does, which is it takes the story to the person who wants to see it. The larger issue is how do you make 
people wanna see it? Because, you know, a lotta times it falls into the, yeah, that’s the good stuff, but you 
know, I don’t have time. 
H: 
I think too, and I watch so close, for example, the people who come to work—you know, how now 
families are. You have your parent, your parent don’t want you anymore—nursing home, and get rid of them, 
and maybe go one [inaudible] or go out and [9.52]. Now, you know, the people who come, they don’t got that 
closeness and that relationship with somebody close to them, so why they going to give that attention to a 
stranger when you are not relating to your parents and care for your parents or your aunt or whatever? You 
know, now, I don’t [inaudible] persons to come to care for other people. The same thing. Maybe not even being 
with their grandparents, they don’t know who their father and mother really is. You know, it’s not family, no 
family anymore that used to be. You know, and that’s love and respect, it’s no. So, when they come and see, 
okay, I say myself. Given myself, why they do that? Why? You know, I don’t—it’s very hard to understand that. 
It’s very hard. 
I: 
So, what would you say to policymakers? What do you want to tell decision makers who might be able 
to make a difference? 
H: 
Well, you know, it’s so hard because you know how families are now. How the kids grow up—different 
father, different mother, you know, that we with an only parent—the grandparents or whatever. They don’t even 
know who are them or they never seen them or whatever. You know, it’s sad that think our family—what the 
family was has faded. It’s faded. 
M: 
So, now we talk more about chosen family sometimes as opposed to birth family because we’re all so 
disbursed. So, you know, I think what my mom’s getting at is that issue of family is about giving and taking, and 
how do we keep doing that with everybody as opposed to just those in your immediate sphere? You know, how 
do you build community? It’s not easy, but it’s about reaching out to people, and I think it’s about taking notice 
of the little things, you know. It’s kinda like, you know, that old cliché, stop and smell the roses along the way, 
but really, that’s where quality exists. That’s really where the quality’s at, you know. The schools, for example 
now, the schools are providing meals, and I have a grandson who falls into that category, but unless he’s 
getting read to at home, he’s not advancing in school. It’s great that he’s not having to be hungry while he’s 
there [laughs], but he’s still not getting read to at home. How do you get that focus back in the center? How do 
you get the lawmakers to see that—don’t look at it from a corporate perspective because right now that’s the 
answer out there is, you know, these corporations are building these, what I call ‘em, pop-up elderly farms, 
unfortunately, and a good friend of mine described them as God’s waiting room, you know, That’s kind of a sad 
thing to think about, but we’ve gotta bring the quality of life back into these artificial environments that are being 
created, and yes, the pets and the birds help, but what has worked better [6.11] is a pen-pal program with the 
kids in school, and the elderly. You know. 
H: 
Yeah. You know, like for example in the schools. They used to be the grandparents’ day where all the 
parents come and see the kids and know about what they do, and there was a play or what. Spend the whole 
day with the kids, you know. The kid mean something to the grandparent to come, and the grandparent is so 
proud of the little boy or girl, you know. I don’t know. They don’t do that anymore. I remember when the kids 
used to be—only thing that they was hopin’ we were there. We were there. Always there. I even when I go—
what they call it, the PTA or— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Hellen Kwant and Martha Kwant. 7.20.18 
 
17
M: 
Yeah. The PTA. 
H: 
The Parents’-teacher conference. I was there all the time. My husband and I, and they say, “Mrs. F, 
why are you coming? Your kids are doing so good.” We don’t have anything, you know, they are standing. I 
say, well, that’s what I want to be here [laughing]. It made me very proud of them [laughing], you know. 
I: 
So, a sense of community, a sense of family, regardless if it’s [inaudible] family or not— 
M: 
Right. 
H: 
They’re [inaudible]. They’re catching a lot, and with the kids now the school, you know, like I say for 
example there’s so many that go to the one father, then the mother. They don’t know where they belong. 
M: 
A sense of belonging is real important. There was something on the news recently where [4.43] some 
school hooked up a bunch of, oh, I think they were like middle-schoolers or a little bit younger, with a bunch of 
elderly folks at a retirement facility, and they set up pen-pals, and low and behold the kids liked writing letters. 
Everybody was shocked that the kids were into it, and the seniors loved to write letters, you know, and use an 
older format of communication, and they all got to know each other, and they had this day where they got to 
meet, and then once they met then the relationship has continued, and I mean it mutually benefitted both, and I 
think that that’s—that that’s real critical. That we need to look at how different disenfranchised factions of our 
society can support one another. A lot of what you  hear us talking about are kind of old fashion, immigrant 
values, and lord knows the immigrant folks in this society are real marginalized. A lotta times they make great 
live-in companions, because in their culture generations are still valued. 
I: 
Is that true in the Columbian culture? 
M: 
Oh, yeah. 
H: 
Well, I don’t think so over there, it’s still the family that they—the family is—yeah. 
M: 
Yeah. The family still exists. 
H: 
Yeah. And what I was going to say too for example, when I run the senior center in Lowell, the seniors 
were very important people to me. You know, they grow up, they were farmers, or they were whatever. They 
give us so much to society. Now, they didn’t ask for anything, but they’ve been kind, and I used to do a lot 
events for them. I take them to the museums, I find a way the artist come, and you know, all the time my 
husband, you know, he comes, and we plant the little flowers. We get them involved, you know, even they say, 
“Oh, I grow up all the time in the corn farm, and I don’t want it.” I say just come and plan one and you see the 
flower coming, you know. That’s good. I used to take them to the school, you know, so the seniors can see the 
children doing things. I mean, you know, involve them. They are part of it. They’re still alive. They are people. 
They don’t have to be just put away, you know, because they are old.  
I: 
I don’t think you could say it any better, but we only have a couple minutes left. Do you have any final 
words? What does the world need to know? I think you’ve said a lot of it so eloquently already, but final 
thoughts on, you know, if you were in front of a legislator? 
M: 
I guess, what it really boils down to I think any American can relate to this is how do you wanna be 
treated when you get to that doorstep? Do you want the door to swing open [1.45] or automatically open with 
no stairs that you can just walk in, or do you wanna be faced with a few stairs that are gonna be hard to 
maneuver, no handrails, and people that aren’t welcoming, and they’re more worried about litigation than 
providing you with quality of life? How do you wanna be treated? 
I: 
How about you? What would you say to somebody—

H: 
I wish, the main thing to me I think is education not only to the children, but for example, educate or 
train in these people who offer to take care of seniors, who offer to drive them, give them the training. It’s not 
just the thing—cleaning, brushing—no! The love. The relationship between the senior and the person. You are 
the person, no, because you are old you aren’t a person. You have some values, and you must recognize that 
and respect that. 
I: 
Those are great final words, and I just want to say thank you again for the work that you do— 
H: 
I love it. 
I: 
--for this profession that you’re engaged in and just for being the people that you are. 
H: 
Yeah. I love it. I love it. 
M: 
Thank you. Thank you for taking the time. 
H: 
Thank you very much for taking the time [laughing] and listen to us. 
I: 
It was a privilege. It was really a privilege to be able to listen to your stories. 
H: 
Yeah. I love it. 
I: 
So, I hope we can get the word out there. I will let you know a couple of the things that we want to do 
with this project—I actually got the idea for this project from—where’d he go? 
M: 
He’s back there. 
H: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
I’m pointing at you. I said I got the idea for this project from K.
