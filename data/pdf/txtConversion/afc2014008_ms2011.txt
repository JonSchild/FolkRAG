Speaking to the Texas Folklore Society is an especially emotional moment
 
for me.
 So many names swim up from the past -
-
 Bedichek, Dobie, Boatright,
 
Lomax -
-
 Lomax is, after all, my name too and my heritage -
-
 but like many
 
children, be we folklorists or tailors or dirt farmers, we spend a good deal
 
of our lives trying to get away from our heritage and then, generally speaking,
 
more time trying to get back to it.
 I find myself in the re.'collecting -
-
 the
 
re-collecting -
-
 phase of my life now, when I collect again those things I had
 
collected earlier but let slip away.
 I shall re-collect a few memories for
 
you tonight...
 
We were living in Austin; I was in high school, I guess the year was
 
aroung 1936 or 37.  Father was working, perhaps on a Rockefeller grant, perhaps
 
on his own, I don't know, but it was the year when I came to know Alex Moore,
 
an ex-cowboy, who recorded many old songs for father.  Mr. Moore was pretty
 
ancient -
-
 I guess all of fifty at the time -
-
 he could no longer cowboy for
 
a living but he rode a cranky cayuse of a bicycle through the streets of
 
Austin with an ice-cream-on-a-stick box in front of it selling cool refreshment
 
to the children.
 It was something of a comedown for a real cowpoke, I realize
 
now, but I never thought so at the time.  Mr. Moore curdled my blood with his
 
exceptional version of "The Texas Rangers" and then he had a lovely tune he
 
always called "Little Joe the Ringler."  "Little Joe, the Ringler, he'd ringle
 
never more" he would sing, his leathery old face shining with conviction.
 I
 
didn't have any idea then what he was talking about perhaps he didn't either,
 
but we were somehow in touch.  He's long in his grave now, bless him, but I
'll
 
never forget him.
 Something passed between us.
 
Then there was the Gant family.  The Gants lived in a little shack down
 
by the river, on a shacky little street that was flooded every year in the
 
spring when the Trinity rose up and overflowed its banks.
 I don't know how
 
Father got in touch with them, but they were a special family, every one of
 
them singers down to the littlest.
 
2
 
The littlest was named Trovesta; she was maybe five when I knew her.
 
Mrs. Cant always said all her children were named after the books in the
 
Mormon Bible; I never was sure about that and am not to this day but they
 
did have such wonderful names.
 Starting from the bottom there was Trovesta,
 
Ella, Foy, Adoniram, Glyda, Ether, and Nephi.  Foy was about my age; she and
 
Ado (
short for Adoniram) and I used to crawl under the house while Father and
 
Mrs. Cant were recording -
-
 Mrs. Cant had an inexhaustible repertoire of
 
Child ballads and every one of them took hours to sing -
-
 and make up stories
 
and tell jokes and giggle.  Ado was older, maybe around fourteen, and he
 
finally got a guitar from Sears Roebuck.  There is a wonderful recording at
 
the Library of Congress of Foy and Ella singing one of their mother's old
 
ballad tunes, a lovely free-rhythmic insinuating melody, while Adoniram, in
 
the background but unescapably on-mike thumps away relentlessly at an
 
accompaniment -
-
 ump-chuck-chuck, ump-chunk-chunk.
 It foreshadows one of
 
the principal aesthetic conflicts of the twentieth century -
-
 and there is
 
absolutely no doubt who will win.  Bye bye, Mrs. Cant, Alex Moore, all you
 
lovely a capella solo singers -
-
 hello, bluegrass; hiya, rhythm and blues...
 
Well, I could go on like this for a long time.
 But I didn't come all
 
this way just to reminisce.
 I came to try to share a few ideas with you,
 
to talk a little while about the things that may or may not have changed
 
since my father an all the other wonderful old-timers of his day were doing
 
their work.  And I came to talk a little bit about what we might ought to be
 
doing right now.
 
You see, a lot has happened.  Father worked most of the time on his own
 
and by himself,  (except for the family) because he was a child of the
 
intellectual ferment of his own particular time.  He was pushed along willy-
nilly by the same impetuous egalitarian stream that had brought Emerson,
 
Thoreau and Whitman to their work; he was deply influenced by mid-western
 
grass-roots populism (
pretty radical ideas in his day).  He first laboriously
 
wrote down and later defended and still later published the first cowboy songs
 
ever printed in the United States in large part just because he thought that
 
cowboys wrote good poetry, and that they had interesting and important things
 
to say and that they spoke for a whole lot of people and that the American
 
people ought to be proud of them.  Later on he worked to collect and preserve
 
Black folksong with much the same kind of humanistic justification.  He got
 
coffee-and-doughnuts money from here and there, the odd record and book sale,
 
-3 -
and the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations helped him enormously but his time
 
wasn't really the grants-in-aid time.  He worked a while for the old Writers
 
Project at the WPA and for the Library of Congress, but for many many years
 
he supported himself through public lectures.  He lectured all over the country;
 
I still run into people who heard father lecture.
 
Overall, you see, he was a fiscal conservative and believed in supporting
 
himself and his work by himself and his work.  He even turned Republican in
 
later years!
 But I have to tell you that he would have defended until the
 
last dog died the public utility  and the public significance of what he was
 
doing.  He believed (
I never heard him say this, but he always acted this way)
 
that the ultimate convictions of the American people have been and are being
 
made manifest through their traditional poetry, and dance and song and story
 
and craft, and that those who neglect or try to forget the manifold statements
 
of those convictions are sadly in error.  And he believed that because of the
 
importance and the aesthetic power of these statements, their collection and
 
conservation was a proper expenditure of the public purse.
 Just as collection
 
and conservation of other documents of our society into archives and libraries
 
are proper expenditures of the public purse.
 
So, a half a century later, here am I
, John Lomax's daughter, working for
 
the federal government in Washington, spending public tax monies and coming
 
back home to report to you what we've been doing with an infinitesimal fragment
 
of those monies -
-
 actually, I manage a grants program with a budget of just
 
under three million dollars.  Father would have been astounded.  And the
 
National Endowment for the Arts my home agency is not alone in paying attention
 
to folk arts; the National Endowment for the Humanities gives grants for
 
scholarly investigation of our various folk communities and art forms, the
 
Library of Congress hosts not only the Archive of Folk Art (
formerly the Archive
 
of American Folk Song) but the American Folklife Center which acts to coordinate
 
the entire federal effort in this field.  Finally, the Smithsonian Institution
 
maintains a permanent Folklife Program producing films, recordings, publications
 
and exhibits relative to folk music, folk craft and folk narrative, not to
 
mention their annual American Folklife Festival on the National Mall in which
 
all America gathers to celebrate its traditional ways.  All in all, the modest
 
-4 -
budget I administer is only a fraction of the total federal effort.  These
 
are heady times we live in, though I still worry over the characteristic
 
fickleness of government and with what incredible rapidity its support can
 
vanish.  The WPA disappeared almost over a weekend, its files, furniture,
 
staff, melted away as though they had never been.
 Is the present interest in
 
folk arts more lasting, more stable?
 
Well, I think maybe so.
 I think a great many Americans are beginning
 
to understand the importance of our cultural heritage and beginning to wonder
 
if in our headlong rush to progress we're not losing some things that we
 
could keep around, live and kicking, if only to amuse the children and keep
 
grandmas like me happy.  But how do we do this?  What can we do about the
 
folk arts?  As soon as you begin to think about it, the whole enterprise begins
 
to seem improbable, ephemeral -
-
 like trying to catch butterflies with a cast
 
iron skillet or mending a watch with a baseball bat...
 
But it's not that hard.  You just have to take it a bit at a time, and
 
the first bit is to decide just what it is you're talking about.  What is this
 
thing -
-
 what are these things -
-
 called folk arts anyway?  Lots of people have
 
defined them lots of different ways, but there do seem to be two main streams
 
of thought, so all you have to decide is which of the two is the more useful
 
and interesting.  The first group of definitions comes from the field of art
 
history.  Basically, their definition of folk art is that it is any kind of
 
visual representation that is untutored and uninfluenced by academic painting
 
or drawing standards of the day.
 People who use this definition talk almost
 
exclusively about folk art as visual and they tend to use words like "naive,"
 
"delightful", unschoèled", "fresh", "unsophisticated," and like slightly
 
derogatory terms.  A couple of good examples of the kind of things they mean
 
are Grandma Moses paintings and the Watts Towers in Los Angeles.  At the NEA,
 
we don't feel it essential to call such fine works of art by any kind of
 
adjective.  We just call them paintings or sculpture and fund things through
 
the Visual Arts Program.  The second group of definitions stem from anthropology
 
and folklore.  People who use these d 4initions tend to think of folk arts as
 
encompassing all the artistic disciplines, all the expressive behaviors of
 
humankind: dance, music, craft, tale, poetry, drama, song, ritual, painting,
 
needlework...
 That's the "arts" part of the definition.  They go into more
 
-5 -
detial with the "folk" part.
 The term "folk" is mostly used these days to
 
express the idea of small groups inside larger society groups that define
 
themselves by the fact that they share at least one thing in common, such
 
things as language, location, ethnicity, religion, occupation, kinship.
 
By this definition, most of us belong to several folk groups.
 If someone
 
says to you, "I'm a Scotch-Irish hardshell Baptist, and I live on the Caprock
 
and I work in an oil field," they've told you quite a lot, all expressed in
 
terms of their membership in at least four folk groups.  Now each folk group
 
always produces and uses its own artistic forms as a means of identifying
 
itself and of expressing its own particular specialness.
 Some use one art form
 
and some use another; some have produced a lot of art, and others very little
 
but they all have their own folk arts even if they just  tell particular jokes
 
or use special terms for subjects in their business
 
Now, the more isolated a group, either by geography (as in Appalachia or
 
an off-shore island) or by language or other limiting factors, the more highly
 
developed their folk arts are apt to be.  They've had more time and interest
 
in developing them.  To cite one example, the Shaker people -
-
 who are pretty
 
specialized -
-
 have developed not only an exceptionally characteristic and
 
elegant style of furniture and architecture, but a marvellous repertoire of
 
songs and a very unusual kind of religious dance, every single one of their
 
artistic practices saying: this is Shakerness, this is who and what we are, this
 
is what's so great about being a Shaker, isn't this beautiful, aren't we just
 
terrific!
 
Parenthetically, this is one of the reasons it's so much fun to deal with
 
folk arts.  People who do this get to look at, study, and appreciate, the
 
things people are proud of about themselves, the things they want to show off
 
to other people, not the things they want to hide under the bed or just keep
 
to themselves.  Folk arts are public statements, made to be broadcast, on
 
the average, because they say who we are.  And people thus share them happily,
 
so long as they haven't come to feel embarrassed by their cultural identity,
 
that is...
 
-6 -
There is one more important factor to keep in mind about folk arts whichever
 
way you define it.
 Folk arts are distinguished by not being i
formally
 taught.
 
The first kind of "folk arts" (
the naive or visionary paintings, for example,
 
what some people call grass roots art,) are generally self-taught; the artist
 
just whacks away at it until he or she is satisfied with the result.  The
 
second kind of folk arts (
the community-based artistic traditions) are learned
 
informally, by simply growing up around them, or hanging around and copying,
 
or even by being "shown", but their standards are very high and rigid and known
 
to all.
 I tell people sometimes about my own childhood when I learned how to
 
embroider and make French knots and lazy daisy stitches from my mother and my
 
older sister.  Nobody set out to make me an artist, but they showed me with
 
great seriousness an art form that almost all the other little girls I knew
 
knew about too.  And then I think of another community I
've visited, near
 
Charleston, South Carolina, where all the little girls aren't taught a little
 
embroidery, instead they are shown the rudiments of how to make a basket,
 
because that is what those particular people do.  And, just as in my own home
 
community, some of us grow up to be great basket makers (or embroiders) and
 
others stop doing it.  Not everybody is an artist, but everybody has participated
 
to some extent in the art forms that are characteristic of his or her own especial
 
folk community.  They then become part of your identity, shaping your aesthetic
 
responses and choices forever.  You can learn to appreciate and enjoy all the
 
art forms of the world, but I can personally attest to the fact that you will
 
forever have a special warm feeling when you come across your own particular
 
home-style.  As for me, when I found myself teaching my own daughters how to
 
make French knots, I thought they were the prettiest things ever.., but you could
 
L
ock me in a room of straw forever like the poor old frog princess, and I
'd
 
never get past the first step in making a basket.
 It's just not in my tradition...
 
Well, hack in 1977, when I was hired to be the director of what was to
 
become the Folk Arts Program in the National Endowment for the Arts, I recommended
 
that the Endowment pick the second definition for its uses.
 It seemed more
 
interesting, more productive, and I believe it has proved to be.  Within that
 
definition, and within the past seven years, we have been able to direct around
 
2 and ½
 million dollars annually towards projects that directly present the folk
 
arts to audiences all over the country -
-
 projects including festivals, concerts,
 
-7 -
exhibits, tours (we helped get the beautiful Women and their Work shows going
 
in Austin, and both last year and this we're assisting the Old Time Punchers
 
Reunion tour).  We also help with recording, redio, film and television projects,
 
we pick up part of the expenses for catalogues and other small publications.
 
And finally we have been working really hard to try and help establish local
 
and state and region-wide folk arts programs.  You will be surprised to hear,
 
I suspect, that we now have over states involved in such programs, one-third
 
of them fiscally independent of federal moneys.
 
You notice that I keep saying "help", "assist" and such words.
 That's
 
because all our grants to organizations are 50/50 matching grants, and as
 
time goes by, we try to reduce the level of federal contribution until the
 
project can become self-sustaining.  We do give a few grants to individuals
 
some apprentices who want to learn the old skills, some to remarkably fine
 
artists who represent the very highest achievements in their particular art
 
form.  Texas' own Lydia Mendoza received such an award two years ago, Narciso
 
Martinez last year.  And, speaking of Texas, you must realize that not only
 
do you have one of the most venerable and high quality folklore organizations
 
(the members 6V whom I am honored to be addressing) but you have one of the
 
finest of the state based public sector folklorists, working full time for you.
 
I refer of course to Pat Jasper who will be addressing us tomorrow.
 Indeed
 
matters have changed since father's day.
 
There is still a troubling question.
 I get asked it everywhere I go.  Why
 
is all this necessary?  If everybody is part of a folk group or two and if
 
everybody has absorbed a little of his or her own group's tradition sort of
 
by osmosis and hanging around, why on earth do we have to do  anything about
 
the folk arts at all?  Why can't we just leave them along and go off and tend
 
to something that needs tending to?
 
Well, there are these days some big problems.
 In our time folk arts,
 
being primarily local, are under direct attack as our society gets more and
 
more centralized.
 Ironically, the two biggest enemies of local traditions
 
are two of our institutions that we're most legitimately proud of: our
 
educational system and our communication system.  We can tell more people
 
more things more quickly than any other society in the world, and that's
 
-8 -
something to be proud of, but all the communication comes out of centralized
 
locuses -
-
 mostly big cities, and it requires big audiences  to pay for
 
itself.
 So most of what comes out on our television and in our newspapers
 
and over on radio is not the special voice of the folk artist in the small
 
community, its the massed voices of the mass communications system from the
 
large urban centers of power and control.
 
We have committed ourselves to the proposition that all children should
 
be educated at least miminally, so we produce more educational materials, books
 
and study guides and curricula, than any other society in the world but again
 
they come from the big powerful center and they therefore express that point
 
of view.
 Father's old cowboys still aren't getting their fair shake
  
So here we are back again.  What shall we do about the Folk Arts?  How
 
shall we defend the very things that make our country so interesting: its
 
incredible variety, its exciting differences, the fact that Sweetwater, Texas
 
is still, thank God, not absolutely identical with Tumwater, Washington.
 It's
 
the folk arts through which you can tell where you are in this enormous
 
country -
-
 otherwise the airports all look alike, and its the same program
 
on t
.v. and the symphony will be playing the same Beethoven piece and the
 
same books in the bookstores and the same MacDonalds  hamburgers in a state
 
where you used to be able to tell San Antonio from Dallas chili.  My brother
 
wrote once, "If the cultural greyout continues all over the world at the rate
 
it is now progressing, pretty soon there will be no place left worth visiting
 
and no particular reason to stay home either."  Think that one over some time;
 
that's a good one for the middle of the night...
 
What shall we do about the folk arts?  It's a new question.  We've only
 
been thinking about it for a few years and we don't have nearly all the
 
answers yet, but there are a few 1de47 that might be useful.
 
1)  One thing we can do is to continue the careful and rigorously
 
professional recording of local traditions wherever they may be found.  The
 
kind of work the early folklorists did must be continued and amplified for
 
the benefit of posterity.  To this end, we need to support with our dollars,
 
with whatever influence we can bring to bear and with our votes, if necessary,
 
the academic and public and private institutions that are at the forefront of
 
this e f f o r t .

works, so that they are photographed and recorded beautifully just as classic
 
art objects are. Our own work of preservation must be as careful as the work
 
of the artists we honor.
 
Now doing any part of any of the above ideas can occupy lifetimes, but
 
it is a joyful labor and a self-imposed task that we can take with us wherever
 
we go.
 I commend it most strongly to your attention.  Personally, I think I
 
have the very best job in Washington, because I get to watch and work with and
 
even sometimes see the results of so many of these happy endeavors, carried on
 
by so many interesting and dedicated people.
 I invite you all to join with me
 
and the many other like-minded people who are trying to do "something about
 
the folk arts."  I guarantee you won't regret it.  Tomorrow perhaps we'll
 
have time to talk separately and you can tell me what you think needs to be
 
done, and I can give you some of the material I brought with me.  I
'll look
 
forward to it, and until then, thank you so much for inviting me.
 It was a
 
pleasure to come home again.
