PREFACE . 
TONY V ASTOR . 
THERE is undoubtedly no name so familiar to the American 
people as TONY PASTOR. 
He stands at the head of the profes-
sion as an artist awl manager, and his entertainments are 
patronized by the intelligence, wealth, culture, and respectabil-
ity of the United States. 
His popular Theatre in New York is 
the resort of families, ladies and children, and is acknowledged 
by the Metropolitan press to be the only legitimate and leading 
Vaudeville Theatre of New York, 
Sunday Schools, Societies, 
and Institutions have regular days allotted to visit his matinees. 
Ma. PASTOR is 
tile founder of the style of entertainments 
known in America as " Vaudeville "—giving light, laughable, 
moral and refilled acts, in rapid succession, and making up an 
evening's enjoyment of the most agreeable nature. 
He never 
misses a 
performance himself, always appearing at each enter-
tainment in his latest and best songs, which leaves the audience 
in as good humor as his reception is cordial upon his appear-
ance. 
During the summer season he takes his company upon a 
grand excursion through the country, visiting the principal 
cities. 
His travelling company is conducted with the same 
care, and special attention to detail, as at his Theatre in New 
York; and the thousands of his patrons throughout America 
always visit his Theatre when in the Metropolis, and enjoy an 
evening of delight with TONY PASTOR and his unrivalled com-
pany.

PEA SOUP. 
As sung by Tosr PASTOR. 
SOME people like that blooming stuff 
The big ones call champagne; 
For me it is not good enough, 
I 
would not touch a 
drain. 
I 
may be thought by all that's here 
A 
funny chap, no doubt; 
There's nothing beats, to my idea, 
A 
jolly good blow out—of 
CHORUS. 
Pea soup—pea soup is fine, 
It beats all your champagne, and all sorts of wine; 
Pea soup—pea soup's divine, 
Give me a 
basin of good pea soup. 
When for pea soup I 
do go in, 
It's strange, but yet it's true ; 
I 
do feel just below the chin 
Like " Tichborne " number two. 
Some may get fat on beer and stout, 
To such things I 
don't stoop; 
My motto is a 
good blow out, 
Three basins of pea soup. 
Pea soup, etc. 
Some fancy sherry, others port, 
Some " Cliquot " and " Moselle," 
Of wines there are so many sorts, 
That I 
know very well; 
That kind of muck may suit the " toff," 
And when I 
can but sport, 
Because I 
do think nothing of 
Demolishing a 
quart—of 
Pea soup, etc: 
There's nothing, barring Sarah Jones, 
My wife that is to be, 
Can equal pea soup; I 
must own 
It's fragrance pleases me ; 
My Sally's getting very stout, 
She once was very thin, 
The reason is when we go out 
She'll have a 
good go in—of 
Pea soup, etc. 
- 
IT'S SURE TO PAY IN THE END. 
Ain.—" Poor, but a 
Gentleman still." 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME hundreds of mottoes to you have been sung, 
But this I 
can greatly defend, 
It teaches you all for to never do wrong, 
It is sure for to pay in the end; 
Wherever you be, upon land or on sea, 
Unto this great maxim attend, 
If you'd do unto others as you'd be done by, 
it is sure for to pay in the end. 
CHORUS. 
I'll stand by my motto while life it shall last, 
And the true workingman I'll defend ; 
Stand firm by the anvil, the axe, and the plough ; 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
Let the nobleman boast of his wealth and his name, 
Of the honors his ancestors won ; 
Let the general who gains in the battle his fame 
Proclaim the great deeds he has done ; 
Let the miser count over his thousands in gold, 
To the dollars he's saved close attend ; 
I 
would rather the workingman's blessing secure, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc. 
Our great politicians the people do cheat, 
Our Congressmen draw their back pay, 
And when they have got all the money they can 
From the country they quick run away ; 
But the laboring man is our safeguard and hope, 
The nation mast on him depend ; 
Though his troubles are great and his life it is hard, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc. 
The men that wear broadcloth, in diamonds do shine, 
And poverty look at with scorn, 
They had better the wages of fraud quick decline, 
Or, better by far, ne'er been born ; 
'Tis better the dry loaf of poverty eat, 
Where a 
dollar well earned you can spend ; 
'Tis better no one in this world try to cheat, 
It is sure for to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my motto, etc.

COULD I 
SEE MY MARIA AGAIN. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'VE 1.0St a young maid, and I'm really afraid 
I 
shall not see her *iy more; 
I 
doat on the girl, for she is my pear 
And a 
damsel I 
reall 
I'd give all I' 
adore; 
ve got, to the West miles trot, 
Then I'd go turn quite insane, 
I'd lay on the grass, and look through " blue glass," 
Could I 
see my Maria again. 
CHORUS. 
Could I 
see my Maria again, 
I'd stay out all night in the rain, 
And I'd fight with Jim Mace till I'm black in the face, 
Could I 
see my: Maria again. 
All kinds of strong drinks I'd always refuse, 
I'd drink nothing stronger than gin; 
I'd never wear trousers, I'd never wear shoes, 
To a 
pawnshop I'd never go in. 
I'd stand upside down all over the town, 
To a 
madman myself I 
would chain; 
I'd swallow a 
sheep, from the Brooklyn Bridge leap, 
Could I 
see my Maria again. 
Could I 
see my Maria again, 
I'd swallow my necktie and cane ; 
I'd jump into the sea, let a 
whale swallow me, 
Could I 
see my Maria again. 
I'd stand on the street and give every tramp that I'd meet 
A 
dollar and a 
half every day ; 
You might call me a 
fool, I'd be hitched to a 
mule, 
And eat nothing but Western baled hay ;

N EV ER GO BACK ON THE FLAG. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
IN 
this land of freedom and home of the brave 
'Tis a 
pleasure for all to be born; 
I 
love the bright stars that above me do wave, 
As they did on that bright early morn; 
I 
mean when the Star Spangled Banner was wrote, 
As it waved o'er " McHenry " so free, 
And midst the dense smoke of the battle did float, 
Though fired at from land and from sea. 
CHORUS. 
Then take my advice, all you people here, 
One favor from you I 
do beg ; 
However misfortune our course it may steer, 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
'Twos under that banner our forefathers fought, 
Beneath its bright stripes Ellsworth died ; 
And, grasping the flagstaff, oft Lafayette stood, 
As he the bold Briton defied ; 
'Twos under its folds brave John Hancock did sign 
His name in bright letters of gold ; 
And " Old Bough and Ready " the Mexicans whipt, 
Though oft has the story been told. 
Then take, etc. 
Beneath that bright emblem was Brigham Young born, 
And married his wives by the score ; 
And unto this day, like young " Oliver Twist," 
He is constantly wishing " for more ;" 
9 
NEVER GO BACK ON THE FLAG.—Concluded. 
And under that banner did Sheridan ride 
When Winchester's battle was fought ; 
And Sherman, he marched to the sea in his pride, 
When our nation's sweet freedom he sought. 
Then take, etc. 
Beneath it Ben Butler made hundreds of spoons, 
Each darkey he got Civil Rights ; 
Mr. Beecher did visit the girls of his church, 
When the husband was out for the night ; 
Beneath it Miss Anthony wants for to vote, 
And the trousers of manhood to wear; 
And each politician goes for " Number One," 
And steals all the cash we can spare. 
Then take, etc, 
'Tis under that flag if a 
bank it does burst, 
The depositors get ne'er a 
cent; 
And if unto Congress a 
member does go, 
It's for " Uncle Sam's" pocket he's bent; 
'Tis under that flag every freeman is born, 
And the whole of creation we flog ; 
And dead be the man who in deed or in thought 
Did ever go back on the flag ! 
CHORES. 
Then take my advice, all you people here, 
One favor from you I 
do beg; 
However misfortune our course it may steer, 
Pray never go back on the flag,

ALL GETTING MARRIED. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
BEHOLD in this mortal a 
poor single man, 
Who wanders about all the day, 
No one in this world cares a 
jot about me 
As long as my lodgings I 
pay ; 
I 
aways was shy, and often would cry 
If any young girl winked at me; 
But, to tell you the truth, all the friends of my youth, 
They are all getting married but me. 
CHORUS. 
The birdies that fly, the pigs in the sty, 
The fishes that swim in the sea, 
The mice and rats, the dogs and the cats, 
They are all getting married but me. 
Oh, it makes me feel awful when I 
look around, 
And think of the clays that are gone ; 
I 
see my old " pals" walking out with their girls, 
While here I 
must wander alone ; 
I 
often have a 
doubt and want to find out 
Whatever the matter can be ; 
The haddocks and whales, the frogs and the snails, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc. 
There is only one thing in this world I 
can do, 
That is, for to cross the wide sea, 
Join Brigham Young, and a 
Mormon become, 
Then, perhaps, much more happy I'll be ; 
But it seems very queer that there is no girl now here, 
I 
fancy they could take to me ; 
The sparrows and wrens, the cocks and the liens, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc.

FREDERICK ALPHONSO. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ii 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, a 
swell superfine, 
My clothes are all cut in the latest design, 
Two yards of necktie and gloves rather small, 
My figure and manner eclipses them all; 
Some think I'm a 
Count from a 
far foreign shore, 
But no—I'm a 
clerk in a 
large dry goods store; 
I 
sell the ladies their ribbons and bows, 
Each one is delighted as from me she goes. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
I 
make a 
favorable impression on the 
ladies—I 
mean, of course, the young ladies. 
The other 
day one came in, and sitting down on the little revolving 
stool, said, " Heigh ho !" " High hose, did you say, 
miss ? 
Certainly, we have them very high. 
Do you 
want 'em plain or striped ?" 
She blushed, and said she 
didn't mean that—she was only sighing. 
Well, no won-
der—that's the way with all the girls—because you know, 
CHORUS. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, the king of the . 
swells; 
Frederick Alphonso can charm all the girls ; 
The ladies adore me, and say I'm divine; 
I'm Frederick Alphonso—a swell superfine. 
I 
wear a 
bouquet in my cream-colored coat, 
And great standing collars encircle my throat; 
I " stand. up" my tailor till fortune is kind ; 
When dressed up in style many friends I 
can find, 
The wealth and the fashion invite me to dine, 
It makes the girls jealous if I 
should decline; 
They'll have none but me for a 
walk or a 
dance, 
For Frederick Alphonso their hearts can entrance. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, etc. 
When business is over I 
walk up Broadway, 
I 
dine at the club when we close for the day ; 
I 
call on Miss Flimsy and chat for a 
while, 
She says I'm "recherche" in figure and style ; 
She talks French and Spanish, and wants to learn Greek, 
From morning to night she sings " speak to me, speak ;" 
She's bright as a 
fairy and gentle and mild ; 
Besides, she is rich, and her pa's only child. 
SPOIKEN.—And she realizes the important fact that— 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, etc.

NOT THAT I WISH TO SAY ANYTHING 
WRONG. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Now it's not that I 
wish to say anything wrong, 
Not for the world, not I ; 
But you can't help noticing some little things 
That daily occur on the sly ; 
While walking along down the street here to-night 
A 
neighbor of mine passed me by; 
Well—it was not his wife he had on his arm— 
But I 
shall say nothing, not I. 
CHORUS. 
For it's not that I 
wish to say anything wrong, 
Not for the world, not I; 
But you can't help noticing some little things 
Just as you're passing by. 
There's Jenkins, the bobby, he lives next door to me, 
But his house is much finer than mine ; 
And it's strange how he does it on ten dollars a 
week, 
While my wages exceed twenty-nine; 
He's got a 
gold watch and a 
beautiful guard, 
And some rings that would dazzle your eye, 
But how he came into possession of these, 
Why, I 
shall say nothing—not I. 
For it's not, etc. 
Besides, there's Miss Brown, now she lives in our street, 
But she dresses remarkably gay, 
And however she can do it on nine shillings a 
week 
Would puzzle a 
lawyer to say; 
'At night she is seen with so many young men 
That to find out why I 
mean to try, 
And mind if I 
find she does anything wrong, 
Why, I 
shall say nothing—not I. 
For it's not, etc. 
Well, again, there's Miss Green, who has led a 
fast life, 
To a 
banker was going to be wed; 
But somehow the marriage has been broken off, 
Through flirting too much, it is said ; 
But while passing her house one evening this week 
A 
baby was heard for to cry ; 
Well, they say it is one she has taken to nurse, 
But I 
shall say nothing—not L 
For it's not, etc. 
MANY' CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
So= very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place; 
A 
man may be poor,. but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc.

011! YOU RIDICULOUS MAN 1 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
NVEIThE walking once in Oxford street I 
could not find my 
way, 
I 
met a 
very modest girl, and modestly .did say, 
" 
I 
hope that you will pardon me, I'd take it very kind 
If you will show me Regent street, the place I 
am to 
find." 
SPOKEN. — She said, " Do you really want to find where 
Regent street is ? 
You do, really ?" 
ClIOR CS. 
Oh I 
you ridiculous man ! how can you be so shy ? 
Oh! you ridiculous man! you know as well as I; 
Oh ! dear ! you tickle me so, I 
really shall laugh out ; 
Oh ! my ! you innocent man, not to know your way 
about. 
Well, in a 
little she said, unto ray great dismay, 
" 
If Regent street you really want, I'll show you, sir, the 
way." 
We walked along up Oxford street, she placed her arm in 
mine, 
And so I 
said, most timidly, " Would you, miss, like to 
dine ?" 
SPOKEN.—She said, " Do you really ask me if I'd like a 
bit of dinner ? 
You do, really ?" 
Oh! you ridiculous man, etc. 
We went into a 
restaurant, I 
had a 
dinner there ; 
She was so nice, I 
fell in love, on o'er the bill of fare; 
I 
said, " I 
love you very dearly, as you very plainly see, 
And if I 
should propose to you, what would your answer 
be ?" 
(1) 
OM YOU RIDICULOUS MAN.—Concluded. 
SPOKEN.—She said, " You really want to know what 
my answer to a 
proposal of marriage .will ? 
You do, 
really ?" 
Oh ! you ridiculous man, etc. 
She named the day ; I 
gave her rings, no less than three 
or four ; 
I 
had to buy her " trousseau," as her parents were so 
p 
o 
or ; 
But still I 
loved her dearly, and I 
worshipped her, my 
queen ; 
I 
led her to the altar, and I'll now describe the scene. 
SPOKEN. — The first thing I 
noticed at the ceremony 
was the absence of my Angelina's parents. 
I 
said mod-
estly, " Where's your pa and ma? am I 
never to see 
them ?" Angie said, " Oh, pa and ma are not well; they 
sent their love to you, and said the breakfast must be put 
off." " How disappointing," I 
said. " Who is to give 
you away ?" " Oh," says she, " my cousin, Herbert Fitz-
plantagenet Fortescue," pointing to a 
young swell with a 
tall hat, a 
long coat, and a 
necktie like a 
display of fire-
works. 
When I 
was asked if I 
would take Angelina for 
better or worse, I 
shouted in a 
manly tone, " I 
will," and 
woke up two pew-openers. 
When she was asked the 
same question, she shouted in a 
manly tone, " Not me !" 
" 
What 1" says I. " Not me !" says she; " I've altered 
my mind." " Why ?" says I. 
She then said— 
Oh! you ridiculous man! you really are too shy; 
Oh ! you ridiculous man! you know as well as I ; 
Oh! dear! you tickle me so, I 
really shall laugh out; 
Poor green fellow like you, not to know your way about.

THE SAME OLD GAME. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
W HEN I 
was quite a 
lad, 
And the darling of my dad, 
I 
was troublesome as troublesome could be; 
If I 
saw a 
little boy 
With a 
fancy little toy, 
I 
was sure to make him turn it up to me ; 
And if lie said me nay, 
I 
would upset all his play, 
A 
proceeding which was sure to bring me blame; 
And though my cheeks were dripping 
With the scoldings and the whipping, 
I 
would carry on the same old game. 
CHORUS. 
The same old game, 
The same old game, 
I'd a 
spirit that the old one couldn't tame; 
For it mattered not to me 
How I 
suffered for the spree, 
I 
would carry on the same old game. 
w 
when I 
older grew 
More of mischief I 
still knew, 
For danger with mr 
doings would increase; 
Let the time be day or dark, 
I 
was in at every lark, 
And my neighbors never knew a 
minute's peace; 
Wrenching knockers, breaking lamps, 
Pitching into rogues and tramps, 
While boxing with the " bobbies " won me fame; 
And though each little job 
Cost me nearly twenty bob, 
I 
would carry on the same old game. 
The same old game, etc.

But still mischief was my bane, 
For I 
made the pretty darlings my delight ; 
Big or little, dark or fair, 
It would never matter where, 
I 
was loving them from morning until night ; 
And to each and all I 
said, 
Some fine morning we'd get wed; 
Yet, though at least a 
dozen made a 
claim, 
And the judges in the court 
Fined me heavy for my sport, 
Still I 
carry on the same old game. 
The same old game, etc. 
d. 
Now I've settled down in life, 
And I've got a 
little wife, 
Who is charming, yes, as charming as can be; 
Yet I 
still regret to state 
That I 
often stop out late, 
And wont give up my liquor and latch key; 
But all that goes amiss 
I 
settle with a 
kiss, 
And thus my little tigress I 
do tame, 
For though she can come it strong, 
And her nails are very long, 
Still I 
carry on the same old game. 
CHORUS. 
The same old game, 
The same old game, 
I'd a 
spirit that the old one couldn't tame; 
For it mattered not to me 
How I 
suffered for the spree, 
I 
would carry on the same old game.

THEY SAID I 
COULDN'T DO IT. 
AS 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
'Tis many years since I 
was born 
Into this world of sin, 
The event I 
cannot recollect, 
But it matters not a 
pin ; 
My nurses—clever folks were they— 
Said I'd be a 
sickly kid, 
That I'd never come to man's estate, 
As I 
hadn't long to live. 
SPOKEN.—Clever people! 
They said this the day that 
I 
was born. 
I 
suppose I 
must have heard 'em, and being 
naturally of a 
stubborn disposition, I 
resolved to live in 
spite of 'em. 
Because— 
CHORUS. 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
People have such funny ways and sayings now-a-days; 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
At last I 
grew to be a 
boy, 
And had to go to school; 
There the master often would declare 
I 
was born to be a 
fool; 
This roused me to activity, 
I 
went to work and strive, 
And when examination came 
I 
carried off the prize. 
SPOKEN. — Which surprised every one, because— 
They said I 
couldn't do it, etc.

THEY SAID I COULDN'T DO IT.—Conoluded. 
I, ere I 
married, I 
often said 
I'd have a 
handsome wife, 
And one with lots of money, too, 
To comfort me through life. 
My friends would often laugh and jeer, 
And say sarcastic things ; 
Lovers should be allowed to laugh, 
He can afford to laugh who wins. 
They said I 
couldn't do it, etc. 
Three years I 
lived in wedded bliss, 
With but a 
single care, 
To my wife I 
often would remark, 
I 
wish we had an heir. 
My wife would say I 
wish so too 
Above all earthly things. 
Well only fancy last Tuesday week 
She presented me with twins. 
SPOKEN. — It was a 
nine days' wonder; everybody 
shook hands with me. 
It was the happiest day of my 
life. 
I 
was a 
perfect hero, and, egad, so I 
ought to be; 
it takes some people all their lives to get one, but I

could do, because—

THE GAL THAT SIGNS HERSE.
LF " 
L17.* 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
Aix :—" Rosin the Bow." 
Have you seen the philosopher's darling, 
Who thinks Eddy Booth's so divine, 
And that poor Annie Dickinson's taper 
Is shockingly dim in its shine ; 
Who rustles in silks she has paid for, 
And holds up Sir Horace to view, 
Twirling round in the Redowa polka--
The gal that signs herself Lu? 
This damsel so tenderly nurtures 
The best moral plant ever grew, 
She's skill'd married folks to unmaru, 
And rivet their fetters anew. 
But lest she should fly to the zenith, 
When the Tribune cries hastily " shoo r 
There's a 
string always tied to the ankle 
Of the gal that signs herself Lu. 
Pretty women, whose husbands are shiftless, 
She advises to sidle away, 
Provided kind gentlemen willing 
To see them safe home from the play. 
When Beecher her mandate peruses, 
He carries his mummeries through, 
His will and his judgment he losses 
For the gal that signs herself Lu. 
Oh. had I 
the knack of composing 
Such letters as flow from her brain. 
What a 
treasure I'd be to old Bennett ; 
I'd never be seedy again. 
But since it is folly to wish it— 
Free lovers, I 
know what to do— 
ff she's ready— hey " onward to Ri.i.1,...ond" 
With the gal that signs herself IA.

FUNNY FEELING. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AN 
eccentric individual I 
am, upon my word, 
My feelings are so versatile, so don't think me absurd; 
I'm either very sensitive, or my nerves cannot be right, 
To feel the feelings that I 
feel, by day as well as night ; 
Some feel jolly, some feel sad, and some feel funny too, 
But the different feelings I 
have felt I'll now explain to 
you; 
A 
change is most agreeable, but I 
think it is a 
bore 
To feel a 
sort of feeling that you never felt before. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
very funny feeling, a 
feeling I 
shall feel for 
evermore; 
It's a 
most peculiar feeling to feel, you 
Always feel a 
feeling that you never felt before—Oh, Lor! 
When I'm in ladies' company I 
feel, upon my life, 
That I 
could make each pretty dear my darling little wife; 
But I'm engaged already to a 
charming little pet, 
To whom I 
was once introdnced, and I 
cannot forget 
The time when first we parted vows and made our court-
ing riglat, 
I 
really felt indeed what's termed a 
feeling of delight, 
And as I 
kissed and cuddled her behind the parlor door, 
I 
felt a 
sort of feeling that I 
never felt before. 
Oh, what a 
very funny feeling, etc. 
Now we all have got our feelings, some kind-hearted, I 
perverse, 
And others know what want is like when they've an empty 
purse ; 
Now to love, that is a 
feeling that I 
can't explain to you, 
And they tell me when you're married you have a 
funny 
feeling too ; 
Well, I 
really don't know what that is, but trust I 
shall 
some day, 
For we can't control our feelings, and all I 
have to say 
Is, I 
shouldn't wonder, when I'm wed to the girl that I 
adore, 
11 I 
felt a 
sort of feeling that I 
never felt before. 
Oh, what 1. very funny feeling, etc.

" 
Which I 
wish to remark 
And my language is plain, 
For ways that are dark, 
And tricks that are vain," 
The heathen Chinee obit peculiar, 
Anymore than anybody else.

In Brooklyn abides, 
And don't say, oh fudge 1 
Till you learn what betides

Whom this excellent judge over-ride:a. 
A 
citizen mild, 
So I 
have been toid, 
As meek as a 
child, 
Or a 
lamb in the fold, 
Was mashed by a 
terrible buffer, 
In a 
manner familiar of old. 
He lodged a 
complaint 
As feeling quite grieved, 
But truly, twas quaint 
How he was received 
By the smiling and excellent judge, 
Who devil a

The facts were all plain, 
The judge looked severe, 
Evidence, like rain, 
Made everything clear, 
But whatever induced the queer verdict 
Was never fully made to appear.

THAT EXCELLENT JUDGE.—LCoxcLunaD. 
The plaintiff was " mashed," 
Oh, yes, without cause, 
The defendant, unabashed, 
Had broken the laws, 
But the plaintiff " hadu't ought to complain," 
In fact, he ought to " know how things was." 
" 
Defendant " said judge, 
" 
I'm really ashamed; 
From here I'll not budge 
Till something is named 
To satisfy this good citizen 
Whom, just in playfulness, you have " mashed." 
Plaintiff wants justice, 
Defendant wants law, 
Now, really, must his 
Be pressed up to law 
"Why don't you settle it over a 
drink ? 
What's the use of having any more jaw r 
The verdict rendered, 
Was open, you see, 
And yet it surrendered 
To the poor Chinee 
The palm by all enlightened Christians 
In trickery' the great monopoly. 
Though justice is blind, 
Its's plain unto me, 
There is something behind. 
What'er it may be. 
The fair goddess, in face, may be sightless, 
But the justice, my friend, you can see.

WHO WILL CARE WHEN I AM GONE. 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
When my heart has ceased its yearning, 
For the joys that will not stay, 
And my rested feet are roaming 
In the angels' shining way, 
Who will sigh for words of greeting— 
Who will moan for smiles withdrawn? 
Never more my welcome meeting, 
Who will care when I 
am gone ? 
When with still and painless bosom, 
I 
am lying fast asleep, 
Underneath the dew and blossom, 
In the grave so dark and deep. 
Who will grieve for words unspoken— 
Tender greetings at the dawn. 
From the lips by death o'ertaken, 
Who will care when I 
am gone ? 
When the birds have hushed their music, 
At the twilight dim and gray : 
Who my name will softly whisper, 
Who for me will kindly pray. 
Gazing at the dew- wet blossoms, 
Leaning o'er my narrow bed, 
Who will breathe a 
word in blessing, 
For the soul from sorrow fled ? 
NEVER ENCOURAGE THE MEN. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A 
'
WORD of advice 
now give to the girls, 
If they will but listen to me ; 
If the men do not like it it's little I'll care, 
If the girls with me will agree ; 
Should a 
young man wink at you while passing the street, 
Don't laugh, or he'll do so again ; 
Pretend you don't see him, and pass on your way, 
And never encourage the men. 
ellorms. 
Don't ever be flattered with what they may say, 
Though they call you a 
rare little gem; 
For if you allow them just one little kiss, 
They surely will kiss you again. • 
If your lover's pocket should ever get light, 
Of course he'll explain all to you ; 
Then he'll say, " Little darling, will you be so kind 
As to lend me a 
dollar or two ?" 
If you lend him five dollars to-day, bear in mind, 
To-morrow he'll surely want ten; 
So cling to your purse, and don't act like a 
fool, 
And never encourage the men. 
Don't ever be flattered, etc. 
But when in the ball-room you're dancing so gay, 
With a 
handsome young man by your side, 
He vows that he loves you, and says that some day 
He surely will make you his bride, 
And if he should pinch you and give you a 
hug, 
Stand up for your rights there and then, 
And just tell him quickly he'd better behave ; 
And never encourage the men. 
Don't ever be flattered, etc. 
And if out to the park you should go for a 
walk, 
And should happen to meet a 
young swell, 
With his gold-headed cane and his big diamond pin 
(Paine Fortune has favored him well), 
Don't look upon him any more than a 
man, 
For George is no better than Ben ; 
But just pass him by, pay no heed to his sigh, 
And never encourage the men. 
Don't ever be flattered, etc. 
rHEY ALI, 
DO IT. 
As sung by To:41- PASTOR. 
SOME folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr. Jones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you ;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought, 
'When he in self-defence was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it ; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world. 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen; 
And if they have a 
kiss ' twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un• 
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple in the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the cats and dogs of all their mice; 
(1) 
h 
THEY ALL 
ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff" has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnup 
nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress ; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see ; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three ; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
" 
News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

When courting time with us begins, 
And love is in its prime, 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never find him bashful, 
The wine fills him with life, 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be my own darling wife ? 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be my own darling wife ?- Cho. 
And when old age creeps on the scene, 
Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf fills us with life, 
And makes us young as May. 
Then happy's the man that is married 
To the girl he's made his wife ; 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a 
jolly good life; 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
led a

As Sung by TONY PASTOR . 
Basking in the sunshine of lovely woman's smiles, 
And listening to the music of her tong..e;

MIDSHIPMAN EASY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
W HAT cheer now, my hearties ? pipe all hands on deck, 
I've just called to give you a 
strain, 
But not of loud thunder, lightning, or wreck ; 
Such ditties I 
treat with disdain: 
I'm " Midshipman Easy," of whom you have read, 
A 
sailor both jovial and free; 
Then up with the flag to the mizzen-mast head, 
And clap on all sail for a 
spree. 
CHORUS. 
" Midshipman Easy," the pride of the sea, 
With a 
heart that never knew fear; 
I'm a 
son of " Old England," the land of the free, 
With whose subjects none dare interfere. 
When at sea we're as merry as a 
butterfly's ball, 
By spinning yarns quite a 
mile long; 
Our ship we have rechristened " Liberty Hall," 
Where we live by grog, joke, and song; 
With a 
strange craft in sight we're ready to fight, 
Our men laugh as they stand to their guns, 
They're cool and collected in the heat of the strife, 
For an Englishman's flag never runs. 
I'm " Midshipman Easy," etc. 
When on shore I'm a 
king, for, with plenty of cash, 
I 
do pretty near as I 
like; 
If the police interfere I 
soon settle their hash 
With a 
gift of a 
sovereign bright; 
I've always a 
sweetheart in every port, 
In some places I 
have two or three; 
The greater the number the better the sport, 
For ladies are scarce out at sea. 
I'm " Midshipman Easy," etc. 
But now, my kind friends, I 
must wish you good-bye, 
For our ship puts to sea with the dawn ; 
My purse is as low as my spirits are high, 
I'm the happiest dog ever born ; 
If I'm born to be drowned I'll never be hanged, 
Unless I'm strung up when I'm dead, 
But I 
won't think about dying, as I 
have it all planned, 
As soon as I 
come back, to get wed. 
I'm " Midshipman Easy," etc.

CHARLEY, 
DON'T YOU PINCH ME. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
To a 
grand moonlight excursion 
One night I 
chanced to go, 
And as to quiet diversion 
You bet I 
was not slow ; 
Whilst with my fair one dancing, 
She squeezed me awful tight; 
But when I 
pinched her in return, 
She yelled out in affright— 
Charley, don't you pinch me, 
You'll have me black and blue; 
Charley, don't you pinch me, 
You know I 
love you true. 
You may squeeze me and caress me, 
For that I 
do not mind; 
But, Charley, don't you pinch me, 
You know it's so unkind. 
I 
kissed her and caressed her, 
Called her by a 
tender name, 
And told her that I 
loved her, 
Hope she returned the same; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry ; 
At once she answered yes ; 
Nay, more than that, she named the day, 
And sealed it with a 
kiss. 
Charley, don't you pinch me, etc. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, she named the day, and sealed it with a 
kiss. 
At last it was settled that I 
was to become a 
mar-
ried man, and naturally thinking that at this eventful 
period of our existence I 
should embrace her, I 
proceeded 
to do so. 
But before I 
was within arm's length of her, 
she began to yell out again, in those sweet, " dulcet" 
tones of hers— 
Charley, don't you pinch me, etc.

CI3.ARLEY, 
DON'T YOU PINCH ME.—Concluded. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've little children three ; 
The cherubs call me " pappy " 
As I

My wife she's such a 
beauty, 
She is so gay and light; 
But she nearly sets me crazy 
When she yells out in the night— 
(or, When she yells out just for spite—) 
Charley, don't you pinch me, etc. 
HER JOLLY OLD DAD WAS AN AUCTIONEER.

I'LL willingly lay ten to one, and put the money down, 
That there is not a 
happier man than I 
in all the town ; 
I'm half inclined to treat you all to the best cigars and 
wine, 
For such a 
charming little dear has consented to be mine. 
CHORUS. 
She was so charming and so fair, 
Light-blue eyes and golden hair; 
The light of my eyes is -
IN.Telly dear, 
And her jolly old dad was an auctioneer. 
When first I 
saw sweet .Nelly ' twits at a 
ball one night; 
She nearly drove me silly, looking, oh, so fair and bright. 
We had a 
waltz together, and after that, you know, 
I 
stole a 
kiss from Nelly underneath the mistletoe. 
She was so charming, etc. 
I 
rushed one fine morning to her dad, the auctioneer; 
Says I, " I'll make you an offer for the hand of your 
daughter dear ; 
As I'm the only bidder, please knock the lot down to me." 
" 
Going ! going! gone !" he cried; " That lot is yours," 
said he. 
She was so charming, etc.

FORKIE JOE. 
Sung by TONY l'AsTOR. 
It's about a 
moith ago, I 
went to Fairlop fair, 
I 
took Sarah for a 
treat, and we looked a 'lobby pair; 
There was a 
lot of us hired a 
van, I 
should think about a 
score, 
But if we count the kids, there would be a 
dozen more; 
There was Mr. Porkie Joe, who thought I 
was a 
dunce, 
And soon got up his larks, so I 
gave him the tip at once. 
Spoken—Yes, Mr. Flash Joe was too fast from the beginning 
so I 
said to him 
(moat s. 
You must keep your mawleys off of Sal; I 
don't allow it, 
though a 
pal, 
Bit me. smash me, linoek me down, but don't von touch my 
old 
We soon were on the roa, and everything so 
ay, 
The horses had their had, and a 
good blow-out of bay, 
We had lots of grub in the van, and I 
enjoyed my pipe, 
After taking a 
swig of the can, and Sarah was eating some tripe, 
But Mister Porkie Joe, lie couldn't leave Sal alone, 
So I 
said to him again, in a 
sort of an undertone, 
Spoken— Yes, Mr. Porkie Joe was too fast to begin with, so I 
said to him, Joe, 
You must keep your mawleys, 
111 
PORKIE JOE.—[Cosa.com). 
At last we got to ti.c fair, and Sarah went in a 
swing, 
And Mister Joe was there, dancing the highland fling, 
Then he bought a 
pea-shooter, a 
whopper, made of tin, 
And every now and then he would drop a 
hoVun in. 
We went down a 
shady lane, to take a 
slight repose, 
When Mister Joe he dropped a 
horse-bean on Sarah's nose • 
34 
S:poken—Now, that got my monkey up. 
I 
stood the peas, but 
when Sarah caught the beau on the nose, I 
said, " I 
tell you 
what it is, Mister Joe, I 
shall punch your head, if you don't lave 
Sal alone !" " Why, I 
never touched her," said Joe. " No," 
says I, " but you laid that ere bean on her nose,"—showing 
Sarah's nose, which had swelled up as big as a 
Jersey crab. " So 
you had better take my advice, 
And keep your mawleysa, 
At last he said to me, " I 
think just now you said, 
As how, as if as you could go and punch my head," 
And before I'd time to speak, the left Duke he let fly, 
I 
stopped it—with my beak and the corner of my eye; 
Then we quickly formed a 
ring, and went it left and right, 
The police, they collared us both, and locked us up all night. 
Spoken—Yes, we both were locked up and the next morning 
the beak fined us ten bob a-piece. 
Joe said " he was sorry." 
I 
told him " it would have been better to have taken my advice, as 
I 
said to him from the first, 
You must keep yo,ur mawleys,

FAIR IRISH GIRLS. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
-WHAT shall I 
sing to you, 
What for a 
theme; 
Some sad love story, or, 
Some poet's dream ? 
No! I've a 
subject 
Far clearer than pearls, 
What we all love the most, 
Fair Irish girls. 
CHORUS. 
Fair Irish girls ; dear Irish girls; 
Where can they equalled be ? 
Bright Irish girls; dear Irish girls ; 
Fair Irish girls for me. 
Talk not of damsels 
Of sweet sunny France; 
Nor Italy's daughters, 
With dark flashing glance; 
Proud Spanish maidens, 
Though haughty and grand, 
Can ne'er equal those 
Of our dear native land. 
Fair Irish girls, etc. 
Each darling may rival 
The lily or rose; 
Each one for their sake 
Would conquer all foes. 
May Ireland's fair diadem 
Be deck'd with such pearls, 
As alone she can boast of, 
Her fair Irish girls. 
Fair Irish girls, etc. 
THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Mr name's not Smith, nor Brown nor Jones; 
Tell that much I 
don't mind; 
And as for my address, p'r'aps some 
Would much like that to find. 
Some " clads " leave houses to their sons; 
Mine ne'er left me a brick, 
And so, iust like my watch, by Jove, 
I 
always go on " tick." 
CHORUS. 
It's the custom of the country, 
It's the custom of the country, 
It's the custom of the country, 
And a 
very good custom too. 
Some how I 
always can get on 
The right side of the girls; 
For flattery is to them often 
Sweeter far than pearls. 
Of course I 
don't mean anything, 
But flirt with all I 
can ; 
They say I'm awful wicked, and 
A 
naughty, sad young man. 
It's the custom of the country, etc. 
I'm looking for a 
wife, but she 
Must have a 
pile of cash; 
She can play at housekeeping, 
While I 
can cut a 
dash ; 
While she lets me do as I 
please 
We're certain to agree, 
So if there's one that's up to that 
Let her apply to me. 
It's the custom of the country, etc.

IN A SHADY GROVE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, 
BEHOLD in inc a 
jolly card, 
I've sweethearts by the score, 
A 
secret I 
will tell to you, 
There's one whom I 
adore. 
I 
nightly take her for a 
walk, 
We stroll among the trees, 
While the moon is brightly shining 
We wander at our ease. 
CHORUS. 
In a 
shady grove, all among the trees, 
While the moon is shining, you stroll there at your ease, 
With your sweetheart on your arm, on a 
summer's night, 
Telling tales of love, while the moon shines bright. 
We often wander to the spot 
Where Nell and I 
first met ; 
'Twas on a 
lovely summer's night, 
I 
never shall forget. 
What brought me there ' tis hard to say ; 
But Cupid will beguile ; 
I 
lost my heart when first I 
met 
My Nally by the stile. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
My charmer's hair is raven black, 
Her eyes they are dark blue, 
Her face it always wears a 
smile, 
I 
love this girl so true ; 
She seems to fill my soul with joy, 
With her I 
could not part, 
She is my guiding star through life, 
Dear Nelly, my sweetheart. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
1\--ow shortly I 
intend to buy 
A 
little golden ring, 
To join my lover's heart to mine, 
With joy how I 
shall sing ; 
The wedding bells will then peal out, 
Their music it will tell 
The girl I 
love is made my bride, 
My charming little Nell. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
NYMPHS OF THE NIGHT. 
As sung by Tosr PASTOR_ 
SOME people take a 
pleasure 
In music or in play, 
And others greatly treasure 
To hear afavorite lay ; 
But with my thoughts does tally, 
And give me most delight, 
To watch the ' Dames de Ballet." 
The graceful " nymphs of night."

'Tis pleasant to glance at the marvellous dance 
That is gracing the fanciful stage, 
When the nymphs of the night in the merry gaslight 
Do our fancies so sweetly engage„ 
Upon the lovely bevy 
My glance it ever falls, 
As I 
my lorgnette levy 
When seated in the stalls ; 
My heart with love is laden. 
My eyes are sparkling bright. 
When looking on each maiden, 
Each charming nymphs of night.

A charming nymph of night.

Our lives shall pass as brightly 
As a 
sunny day in June, 
And at the ballet nightly 
We'll spend our honeymoon ;

WORKINGMAN. 
As sung by Tony PASTOR. 
THE great men of the day they sing 
About their West End belles, 
Of " Oxford Joe" and " Polly. " too, 
And noisy, howling swells; 
But I 
will sing of another sect, 
And please you, if I 
can ; 
And the one I'll mention in my song 
Is the honest workingman. 
CHORUS. 
For we are not " toffs " or " Immensikoffs," 
And none of the " Upper Ten ;" 
But we belong to a 
glorious band, 
They call the workingmen. 
Some pride themselves upon their wealth 
And stations high in life; 
A 
married match they always hatch 
Whene'er they take a 
wife; 
But if true love and virtue should 
Be recorded in the plan, 
Why, as good as any countess, boys, 
Is the wife of a 
workingman. 
For we are not " toffs," etc, 
If misfortune should at any time 
Bring the rich man down, 
He stands as helpless as a 
child 
To brave the world's cold frown ; 
While we instead can earn our bread 
With hard but honest hand ; 
So, to speak the truth, what lord or duke 
Can equal the workingman ? 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
Some time the great and rich 
Will at the poor man sneer; 
But where would be their grand estates 
If workmen were not near ? 
So I 
will hold my head erect, 
And say, " Thank God, I 
am 
Old England's boast, from coast to coast, 
The British workingman, 
For we are not " toffs," etc.

OH I'M WASTING AWAY. 
Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
Oh, I'm a 
sample of a 
used- up man, 
Afflicted with a 
thousand ills, 
[can't get fat, do what I 
can. 
Just look as these half-starved gills, 
My parents were as thin as I, 
They never had a 
shadow— so people say, 
They wen't off like a.puff, they couldn't die, 
And their boy is wasting away. 
CHORI:S. 
Oh, it's a 
pity that I'm so thin, 
I'm sure that I 
shall never get fat, 
I 
look like a 
small-sized clothes pin, 
To find me you must get a 
map. 
The doctor recommended me, 
To drink nothing else but so-long tea, 
But I 
busted a 
brewery not far from here, 
Where they sold Chicinnatti beer ; 
Oh, I 
worry and cry, and sob and fret, 
To see my fi lends grow stout and gay. 
Fat on me I'll never get, 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, tte, 
All the gals they do me shun, 
And shake me for some other fell, 
They say I 
look like the barrel of a 
gun, 
Could be used for an umbrell; 
Oh, what will I 
do ? Oh, where will I 
go ? 
in the eye of an needle I 
make my stay, 
I'll never come out, till I 
get stout. 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, &A,

In Altna's roariur glow,

Their use and power below ; 
But finding in the bonndless deep, 
Such thunders would but idly sleep, 
lie with them armed Rritannia's hand, 
To guard from fees her native land. 
Long may she hold the awful right, 
And when through ei-Tling flame 
She darts her vengeance in the fight, 
May justice guide her eirn, 
While, if assailed in futur.9 wars, 
Her soldiers brave and gallitnt tars 
Shall launch her fires from every hand 
On every foe to Bi kon's laud.

HOLD YOUR OWN. 
Written and Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
If the world it goes against you, 
And you're struggling for a 
bone, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck,

If a 
lassie gets her back up, 
Stares at you like a

Why. then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If your witey should grow snappish, 
And rise a 
hateful tone, 
Why then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If, when robbed of a 
true friendship, 
By slander overthrown, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If when you have a 
glass too much, 
Your path has slippery grown, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
And when you're tossed by wayward luck, 
By each ill- wind that's blown, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
In all your acts strike like a 
man, 
Let faltering ne'er be known, 
Have a 
mind for yourself always 
And grip and hold your own. 
And thus through life, where'er you be 
By circumstances thrown, 
Why, just take hold, my laddie buck, 
And bravely hold your own.

SHE RAN AWAY TO FOREIGN CLIMES. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
sat me down and wrote a 
song, 
I 
wrote it well, I 
wrote it long. 
At every line I 
shed a 
tear, 
At every verse I've lost my dear. 
My will will break and I 
shall die, 
And when I 
think, it inakes inc sigh, 
That I 
should love with such a 
love, 
And now I've lost my turtle dove. 
Cnottus. 
She ran away to foreign climes, 
bhe loves the man who plays the chimes. [Repeat. 
Her name was Susan Sarah Jane. 
And don't you think it quite a 
shame 
That I 
should pine in such like times 
Just for a 
man that plays the chimes? 
She's not so tall, but very fine, 
Alas, she never can be mine ; 
Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her mouth is small, with teeth so white. 
She ran away, Sze. 
She's curly hair, as dark as night, 
Tier skin is fair as lilies white ; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing rose, 
A merry laugh and Roman nose ; 
She's rather stout and full of pride, 
And when she walks she takes a 
stride ; 
She swings her arms with such a 
grace, 
No Venus e'er had such a 
face. 
She ran away, &c. 
I 
decked my hair with violets blue, 
To let you know I 
loved her true ; 
I 
bound my calves in black and white, 
Because 1 
lost my heart's delight ; 
My coat I 
changed to cabbage green, 
Which means forsaken by my queen; 
:My corpus thus in colors slashed, 
To let you know my heart is mashed. 
She ran away, &e. 
I'll seek some spot where lambkins play, 
And gently breathe my griof away. 
Where little pigs and ducklino-s 
quack, 
You'll find me stretched upon my back, 
And in my hand a 
carving knife, 
To let you know I 
took my life, 
Through loving one that ne'er loved me, 
Because defunct for love of she. 
She ran away, tt e

CHIDING IS THE JOY OF OUR WEDLOCK ; 
OR, GRUMBLING'S SUGAR TO OUR TEA. 
As 
Sung by TONY PASTOlt. 
THERE are some who delight in the race or the fight, 
Or others in boating take pleasure; 
Some exult in the )vars, and glory in scars, 
While some think a 
drive quite a 
pleasure. 
There are some like the sea, when afloat they are free. 
And others rejoice when they're riding ; 
But my great delight, from morning till night, 
Is to hear my dear husband keep chiding. 
CHORUS. 
For chiding is the joy of wedlock, 
Grumbling is the thing for me; 
When we're locked by Hymen's padlock, 
That's the sugar to our tea. 
In the morn 'ere he rise, and scarce opened his eyes, 
lie begins with Ids grumbling and chatter ; 
First, he says, I'm too tall, then he thinks I'm too small, 
Then he chides me because I 
am not fatter. 
It is his delight, both morning and night, 
When I 
bear him I 
know it's good tidings. 
I 
can l'ery soon tell. my dear husband's unwell, 
If he were to leave oil his chiding. 
Fur chiding is the joy, ctc. 
When lie sits in his place, with a 
black, surly fdee, 
You would laugh if you heard him complaining, 
Of the tea being cold, or the bread far too old, 
And faults both great and mighty he's feigning. 
Be it flesh, fowl, or fish, he'll complain of the dish, 
And he'll grumble in words most deriding; 
But in that I 
delight, for I 
know 
all right. 
When I 
hear him indulge in his chiding. 
For chiding is the joy, 
Ten he grumbles at night, to lose the delight 
Of chiding in bed as he's sleeping ; 
So to soften his sorrow, I 
speak of to-morrow 
Then ofl to the bedroom he's creeping. 
It is his delight, and to me it's all right, 
For his love is still with me confiding; 
It's a 
failing he's got, and I 
don't care one jot, 
May lie live long and keep on his chiding,. 
For chiding is the joy, (te,

My thoughts for awhile were turned from the scene, 
As I

And On looking around, why, who should I

But a 
dashing young gent, who was winking at me. 
Oh, he looked so sweet, and lie dressed so gay, 
With his pretty black moustache curled this way. 
And his jet black eyes; oh, they Icolied so loright, 
And his features, too, v, ere a

So I 
had to look around once more to see, 
When that dashing young gent gave a

I'M HERE AGAIN TO GREET YOU ALL. 
As 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'm here again to greet von all, 
To please you I 
must sing, sirs, 
And now I've got another song, 
You'll find is just the thing, sirs; 
The suoject is t 
common one, 
it's the last and best sensation, 
So if you listen I 
will tell, 
Of a 
tern 
le temptation. 
Yes, I'll engage its all the rage, 
This terrible temptation. 
A gay young, clerk be falls in love, 
The sensation it is so funny, 
He presents makes of diamond rings, 
Gold watches, chains, and money, 
His salary is quite small you know, 
But he's got a 
situation. 
Where he helps himself to all be wants, 
For this terrible temptation. 
But soon he's caught, that ends hi s 
po t, 
'Tis this terrible temptation. 
A 
man gets married, settles down, 
Resolves to live quite steady, 
He stays at home, quite temperate lives, 
No more for sprees he's ready. 
In a 
little while lie meets a 
friend, 
Takes a 
drink for recreation, 
He staggers home drunk as a 
lord, 
It's a 
terrible temptation. 
He says, dear wife, joy of my life, 
it's a 
terrible temptation. 
One day while walking round the town, 
A fellow less than human, 
Insulted on the public street, 
A weak, defenceless woman. 
I 
quickly put a " head" on him, 
Gave his eye an elevation,

For woman's rights I'll always fight,

For beauty has no eye. sir.

He'll single live and d'e. sir

Try her powers of fascination.

THE BOWERY FANCY BALL. 
As sung by Tor PASTOR 
M R—" Billy Johnson's Ball." 
Spoken.—I 
went to a 
ball last evening. 
Now, a 
ball is an 
interesting subject to sing about. 
The young ladies like 
to go to a 
ball. 
Young fellows play base bad. 
The old 
lellOws like to " take a 
ball." 
The boys who go skating 
like to see the " ball up,' Even babies when spanked. will 
bawl, and many a 
young gentleman, when hard up, will go 
to the sign of three balls. 
Oh. my prophetic soul, my 
uncle !"— llandet—but I'll tell you of another ball. 
In Centre Market many a 
day 
Bill Johnson kept a 
stand ; 
, 
Ilk uncle died, a 
fortune left, 
Which Billy got in hand. 
The grand event.to e(lebrate, 
lie went and hired it hail, 
And all his friends invited to 
A regular Bowery ball. 
Spoken.-1 regret to say I 
was out of town, bat I am 
positively assured by him that all the prominent person-
ages wore there doing the

Bill Tweed and Andy Garvey 
Were the lirst upon the floor. 
When the Count Joannes and Beecher 
Promenaded through the door. 
Dick Connoly and Joe Dowling 
Were the next to enter in ; 
Then GeOre, Law and Horace Greeley, 
Did an Irish jig begin. 
Spoken.—Yes. as Nclse Seymour remarked, in hi g 
pecu-
liar German brogue: 
They weltel the flure aiqual to 
Reddy the G-obkmith.' 
And only they were stopped by 
Mat Brennan, they'd have knocked all the putty out of the

Then Bergh. the pi! ,eon shooter, 
Said like ( lancing he did feel. 
And with Victoria Woodhull danced 
An old Virginia reel. 
Spoken.—Yes, they danced away. 
Bergh declared it

THE PRIZE P A CKAG E MAN. 
W ritten by GEORGE W . 
051101LN. 
Sung by TONY PA8T01:. 
I 
saw him on the corner 
Of Broadway and Chambers street ; 
And all the people flocked around 
To hear his voice so sweet. 
To buy his candy packages 
The men and women ran; 
There's a 
prize in every package 
says the prize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
Ile was a 
gallus fellow, 
And he wore a 
big moustache ; 
he'd sing a 
song, and crack a 
joke, 
Which some might think was rash; 
But still they gathered round him 
As soon as he began. 
And all the ladies doted on 
This prize package man. 
Now jump up. and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
saw my Angelina 
Standing in the crowd ; 
The package man he smiled on her, 
And theu she winked aud bowed. 
Imitate 
And when she took a 
package, 
crying. 5 
I 
saw him squeeze her hand; 
There's a 
prize in every package 
Says the pi ize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
called on Angelina 
The evening of that day; 
imitate 
And it almost broke my heart to hear 
crying. ç 
That she had run away. 
A billy-dux to my address 
Was lelt upon the stand ; 
Saying she had skedaddled 
With the prize package man. 
Now if I 
catch the rascal. 
bust hint if I 
can, 
And I'll scatter all the prizes of the prize package man; 
jump up, and get up. any way I 
can, 
And I'll dislocate the bugle of tiaat prize package man.
