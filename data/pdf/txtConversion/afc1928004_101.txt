National Song and. Dance. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
Ain—Active Boy, 
Gentle folks, I'm going to sing a 
song I 
think will be the 
thing, 
About a 
Fop and Irishman, a 
Yankee and a 
big Dutchman. 
I 
change my dress for every song, in doing it I 
won't be Jong, 
The music of course will not stop ; the first will be about a 
Fop. - 
(
Runs off, changes to Fop.) 
Here I 
am, changed to a 
Fop; my clothes, I 
think, are made 
tip-top; 
They were imported here from France, I'll show you how us 
folks do dance.

(DANCE.) 
I 
change my dress for every song, in doing it I 
am not long; 
With my shillelah in my hand, I'll sing again as an Irishman. 
(Runs of,  changes to Irishman.) 
Pat Maguinness is my name, me father before me was the 
same, 
I'm Irish as a 
Dublin pig, I'll give you a 
step of an Irish jig. 
(misir JIG.) 
I 
change my dress for every song, in doing it I 
am not long, 
If you've the patience you will see me appear again as a 
live 
Yankee. 
(
Runs off, changes to Yankee.) 
To New York city I've never been, so I'm bound to see what's 
to be seen; 
A Yankee dance I 
never likes, so I'll sing about my Sarah 
Sykes. 
(siNcs SONG.) 
I 
change my dress for every song, in doing it I 
am not long, 
To please you all I 
know I 
can, when I 
appear as a 
Dutch-
man. 
(
Runs off, changes to Dutchman.) 
I

So soon ash I

WRITTEN AND SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
AIR—Rackety Jack. 
I'll sing you a 
song about myself 
I 
think will be the thing; 
I 
go around the streets all day, 
A- crying, " Glass put in !" 
With my rack upon my back, 
In the morning when I 
go out, 
When in a 
window a 
girl I 
see, ' 
At her I 
do shout: 
CHORUS. 
"111 
ho! up there I 
say, you! 
Glass put in ! glass put in 1" is my cry all day ; 
Glass put in ! glass put in 1" is all I 
have to say. 
The other morning when I 
went out, 
The first thing I 
did see, 
A gay young girl upon a 
stoop, 
Looking down at me. 
I 
raised my finger, shouted loud 
At this girl, dressed neat as a 
pin; 
She turned around, went in the house, 
As I 
hallooed, " Glass put in !" (CuoRus.) 
The other night, with some friends, - 
I 
went out for a 
spree; 
We had some drinks, and then a 
song, 
For we were full of glee. 
We soon got fighting, were put out, 
In the station-house put in, 
Fined next day and sent to jail 
For a 
glass too much put in. (Cllonus.)

WRITTEN AND SUNG BY JULE SEEN. 
AIR—Street Car. 
My name is Bill Sykes, from Yorkshire I 
came, 
And came here to New York, a 
town of great fame. 
Daily and nightly I 
travel around, 
For I'm a 
fishmonger, and sell clams in this town. 
A horn I 
have got which I 
loudly .do blow, 
And wake up all children through streets that I 
go. 
Is there any one here who'd like to buy clams ? 
I've got them right here, and ready I 
am. 
CHORUS. 
I 
sell fish, oysters, clams, without any sham; 
What a 
handsome young man I 
am to sell clams! 
I 
once went a- courting a 
girl named Nancy 4 
She was as handsome and fair as could be; 
With eyes like the stars that glisten so bright, 
Her cheeks were like roses—a 
beautiful sight; 
Her hair hung in ringlets, so beautiful and long ; 
The rest of her virtues I 
can't tell in this song. 
She was a 
prize for any young man, 
But she'd never do for a 
peddler of clams, (Cuomo.) 
One evening I 
went there, dressed in my best; 
Corduroy breeches, a 
nice new red vest. 
I 
moved up beside her, and asked for a 
kiss; 
She made .a dive for my pocket, said, " Pray, sir, what's this?" 
-
1.sly horn from my pocket this woman she " hikes ;" 
Thinks I 
to myself, it's all up now, Bill Sykes. 
" 
Get out of my house, or down your throat I 
will ram 
This horn that you blow when you peddle your clams." 
CHORUS. 
Of course from the house I 
right away ran, 
She crying out after me, " Fish, oysters, and clams!" 
Entirely cored of love I 
ain ; 
I 
do n(tlii;rz at all 1)111 )4:11 oyz,lers and clams.

ETHIOPIAN 
COMEDIAN, FROM WHOM MUSIC CAN BE OBTAINED. 
Oh, good evening, white folks all, I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
And tell you how the old man gets on; - 
I 
try to please you all, both fat, short, lean and tall, 
While there's dancing left in old Uncle John. 
It's often I've been told this nigger's getting old, 
And soon will go to the happy land ; 
But the few years that I've got, and while I'm on this spot, 
I'll sing and dance as long as I 
can stand ; 
Oh, that's what the old man wants to do. 
When I 
was in my prime I 
had many a 
happy time 
With the colored boys down on the old plantation ; 
Oh, it's when the work was done, we all went in for fun, 
I 
tell you we were a 
happy population. 
But my bones are getting sore—I 
can not work much more 
Soon this old nigger will.be gone ; 
But while on earth I 
live, and I've got a 
step to give, 
There'll be dancing left in old Uncle John. 
Oh, it's that's what the old man wants to do.

One day on a 
corner I 
loudly did cry, 
Any old scissors to grind? 
I 
halloaed (a 
policeman stood by) 
Any old " buttons" to grind ? 
He arrested me then for breaking the peace, 
And sent me to jail, which I 
think was unkind ;

The judge told me then and there that I 
must cease 
Crying, any old scissors to grind.

I 
used to court, when I 
was young, a

I 
kissed her, and I 
sold farewell, as the ship sailed from the bay, 
But now she's dead and in her grave; she was my guiding

Life's pleasures are short, they soon must cease; I

So now I'll bid you all good-by; I'll come again ere long; 
I'll spin a

then did raise, and right away began to praise 
Her sparkling eyes and pretty feet, and fancy dress, trimmed

She praised my figure, called it 
fine ; says she, " My dear, 
I'm none but thine." 
I 
saw her home, and called again to see my darling Josie

I 
married her; we then were one, and I 
was glad when it 
was done. 
We now together dance and sing, and I'm as happy as a

I'll Tell You What I

MUSIC TO BE OBTAINED FROM JULE REEN. 
I'm fond of promenading around with pretty girls; 
The one that I 
do like the best is her that wears long curls. 
I 
went to see her one fine day, dressed up just like a 
kid, 
And when she blushed and winked at me, I'll tell you what 
I 
did. 
CHORUS. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, and told her to sit down; 
Perhaps you'd like to know her name—'twas Clementina 
Brown. 
The interview I 
had that day set my bosom all aflame, 
So I 
resolved to try once more, so in I 
went again.

Am— Om the Beach at Lone Branch. 
Standing on a 
corner, smoking a 
cigar, 
There I 
saw a 
pretty girl stepping from a 
car; 
My attention was attracted by a 
dimple in her chin, 
So I 
resolved that I 
would go and try this girl to win. 
I 
followed her right down the street, still keeping back the 
while, 
Admiring of her pretty dress, cut in the latest style; 
Grecian bends and waterfalls, both fastened up behind, 
And as I 
followed up the girl, the thought came to my mind, 
Cnonus—That standing, etc. 
She soon came to her home, ' twas Number Twenty-four, 
So I 
walked on quick, to se her face once more; 
As she started up the steps, her handkerchief she dropped; 
I 
picked it up--politely callecl upon her for to stop ; 
I 
gave it her, she thanked me, and asked me to come in; 
Of course I 
went, and right aw ay love-talking did begin. 
I 
got her promise, then I 
left, but called again next day ; 
She asked me where I 
saw her first; what could I 
do but 
say-- (Cnouus.) 
I 
married her, and now I 
live in Number Twenty-four; 
I've got' the number posted up in big figures on the door. 
Though I've been singing ' bout this girl, I 
haven't told her 
name; 
It's the sweetest name you ever heard, ' tis Lizzie Matilda Jane. 
So now, young men, to catch a 
girl you needn't go so far ; 
Just stand upon a 
corner, and watch them in the car ; 
I 
did the same, and got a 
girl, the first one that I

As I

fine summer day, 
My heart for a 
subject yearning, 
I 
stopped at Andrews' window in passing that way, 
But so many songs kept my brain turning: 
There was " Captain Jinks, of the Horse Marines," 
" 
Walking down Broadway so gayly," 
With " Pretty Polly Perkins of Washington Square," 
Who squinted at young " Paddy Carey." 
There was " Fashionable Fred" on the " Fly.ing Trapeze," 
Throwing glances at " Sweet Isabella," 
Who with " Beautiful Nell" was singing the " Sneeze," 
While the " Bell goes a-ringing for Sarah." 
" 
A. Sweet Irish Girl is the Darling for me," 
No objections to " Kathleen Mavourneen 
" 
Sarah's young man drank too much Bitter Beer," 
But he " Thonght of his Head in the Morning." 
"

But awoke in an " Irishman's Shanty" ; 
" 
Annie Laurie" was going to " Lanigan's Ball," 
For an escort she had " Handy Andy." 
" 
Thc, Bonny Light Horseman," and " Burgundy Ben," 
Were disturbing the " Musical Party," 
While " Champagne Charlie," of the " Upper Ten," 
Was outside, courting " Biddy McCarthy.". 
" 
My heart is over the Sea," " Tommy Dodd," 
Where the " Red, White and Blue" is still streaming, 
Where the" Star-Spangled Banner" waves over the sod, 
So " Come where my Love lies Dreaming." 
My song now is ended, and I 
hope you're all pleased, 
And with your kind permission I'll close it— 
But I'll say no more, no, " Not for Joseph."

The Nice Young Radish Girl. 
AS SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
Am—Big Sunflower. 
Now, white folks, listen while I 
sing 
Of a 
nice young radish girl; 
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were black, 
And her hair was made to curl. 
This young girl's name was Sarah Jane, 
Her dad's was Hans Van Stark; 
He owned a 
great big radish farm, 
jp near the Central Park. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she was as pretty as the roses in June, 
With a 
step like a 
fawn, light and airy.; 
She was known far and near as the prettiest of girls, 
This pretty little radish girl Sary. 
Every morning in the summer time, 
Before the day -would dawn, 
With a 
basketful of radishes, 
To the city she'd be gone. 
And there her flute-like voice you'd hear, 
On business quite intent, 
Sing out so loud, " Fresh radishes! 
Two bunches for a 
cent." (CrioRts.) 
Now Sarah Jane was deep in love 
With a 
very nice young man; 
He used to peddle porgies, and 
His name was Cranky Dan. 
That his parents were respectable; 
a 
I 
think there's ample proof; 
In " Rue de Baxter" they did dwell, 
On the first floor, near the roof. (Cnonus.) 
Now Sarah Jane, at Dan's request, 
Had named the happy day, 
When he could claim her as his bride, 
And carry her away. 
•
LOVE AMONG DER SWEITZER SONGSTER. 
But old Van Stark heard of their plans, 
And swore an awful oath, 
That he would separate the pair, 
Or else he'd kill them both. (CHonns.) 
That night he told sweet Sarah Jane 
That she must shake poor Dan; 
The news it did affect her so, 
To " beller " she began. 
He heeded not her sobs and tears, 
He thought not of her pain, 
But he said, " No man that peddles fish 
Can wed my Sarah Jane." (Cnonus.) 
Her spirits sunk beneath the weight ; 
She resolved on suicide ; 
Then she ate ten pounds of horse-shoe nails, 
And laid right down and died. 
When Cranky heard of her sad fate, 
He nearly lost his breath ; 
He fell through the seat of his peg-top pants, 
And choked himself to death. (Cuonus.)

When he'd come home at night, like a

Till me father gets up for to open the door. 
One day we sat down, and were going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate ; 
And without saying a 
word, shure, the ould dirty gommagh, 
lie druv his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis, ma'm," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat gave a 
jump, 
And struck me mother, oh, grral such a 
murthering thump,

Then all the house bate a

And the goat bucked away at the divil's own rate; 
He spied me father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head in the wall. 
Some time after that they went to look for the goat; 
They searched all round, till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only a 
slitump of his tail, and it still bucking away.

Help One Another, Boys. 
AS SUNG BY JULE KEEN.—MUSIC TO BE OBTAINED AT E. H. 
HARDING'S, 288 BOWERY, N. Y. 
In this sensation century good songs are very few, 
The words are little cared for if the music is but new ; 
The subjects, too, are nearly done, but I 
have found one still: 
:Never push a 
man because he's going down the hill. 
CHORUS. 
Then help one another, boys, if fortune on yac shine, 
Itcrtnember when you give your mite that poverty's no crime. 
Though little be your offering, boys, give it With a 
will, 
And never push a 
man because he's going down the hill. 
As we jog along in daily life, how many men we find, 
That poverty's a 
grievous sin, to think they are inclined; 
They meet in sad adversity some old friend,. Tom or Bill, 
And pass him by disdainfully, and push him down the hill. 
In this wide world there's many a man with truly tonest 
heart, - 
To raise his wife and family in business makes a 
start ; 
But still his ends don't seem to meet, work which way he 
will; 
Fate seems to be against him, and he's going down the hill. 
If e'er you meet an honest man struggling hard with fate, 
Don't speak words of discouragement, or tell him ' tis too late; 
Don't sneer at him as you pass by, but help him with a 
will, 
And p'eaps some day you'll .find him at the summit of the 
hill.

Bright faces greet me lovingly,

For love ignores the law, 
And make my happiness complete,

I'll speak to you about the fashions of the city, 
The last one, which is called the Grecian Bend. 
The ladies are the persons -who have got it, 
And lately it seems to be all the rage; 
They seem to think they can not do without it, 
But it really looks as if it were old age. 
CIIORD S. 
Oh, my, what a 
style I 
How foolishly the money they do spend; 
I'll bet my pile I 
never will get married, 
So long as ladies have the Grecian Bend. 
Some weeks ago I 
went to Saratoga, 
But now, you know, the season it is o'er, 
I 
went there to see my dear beloved brother, 
And his lovely wife, who was my sister-in-law. 
My brother looked as natural as ever, 
To live with him I 
did almOst intend, 
But when his wife came in the room I 
did endeavor 
To get out, for she had the Grecian Bend. (Crto.) 
The other day I 
thought of getting married 
To a 
darling little creature o'er the way, 
But one afternoon by the door I 
tarried, 
To the keyhole I 
chanced to put my eye; 
Her wax nose was laid near the shutter, 
Her false teeth she was trying to mend, 
She had a 
glass eye, but that I 
didn't care for, 
But I 
laughed when I 
saw her Grecian Bend. (Ono) 
When will our stylish folks get common reason ? 
I 
really think the leaders must be mad ; 
Long trails and waterfalls were a 
blessing 
To this, which is the worst that could be had. 
If they would only introduce it in the army, 
What a 
comfort to the soldiers they would send; 
They could carry crackers there when it was stormy, 
I 
only wish they had the Grecian Bend. (CHO

Up in that Back Room. 
AS SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
One day I 
was married— the truth I 
will state, 
When you've heard my sad tale you will pity my fate; 
My wife makes me work both morning and night, 
And she swears that I 
never do any thing right. 
The first night we were married, it's the truth, I 
am sure, 
My wife went to bed and I 
lay on the floor; 
And since I've been married, I 
must do what I 
can, 
So pity the fate of a 
poor married man. 
CHORUS. 
Who's—up in that back room, boys, 
Up in that back room?

Pity my sad (loom. 
Up in that back room, boys, 
Up in that back room ; 
I 
wish I'd ne'er got married, 
To be up in that back room. 
Every morning at five, to please her desire, 
She makes me get up and set light to the fire; 
Six months I've been married, it's the truth .I 
declare, 
But the joys of my wedlock I 
have not yet shared. 
'Before we were married— it's true on my word— 
She looked like an angel and sung like a 
bird ; 
But now like a 
lion she will fly very soon, 
If I 
speak she will quick knock me down with a 
broom. 
CRORUS—Up in that back room, etc. 
This afternoon—now listen to me— 
She'd the cheek to bring home a 
big soldier to tea; 
I 
said, " Mrs. Brown, you know it's not right ;" 
She said, " Hold your tongue—I'll do what I 
like." 
They sat side by side, he gave her a 
kiss, 
tired a

did miss; 
He kicked me down stairs and hurt my backbone, 
So I 
left them to take tea alone.

He was known as " 3..ly Uncle," his sign was" three balls," 
His business was a 
pawnbroker. 
Now a 
damsel one day happened in with a 
stove, 
Which she popped on the counter so gayly, 
Saying," Lend me a

She answered, " It's Deborah Daly." 
Mister Strong he was tall, 
His sign was three balls—

What's the residence ?—so's to be right, dear ?" 
She told him the place, then he gave her a

And that very evening, about ten o'clock, 
He called, as he'd given her warning; 
They chatted and talked, and all that sort of thing, 
And he left her at daylight next morning. 
For he was in love, 
As the sequel will prove, 
This handsome, gay little pawnbroker. 
Next morning he thought he would bring her a 
treat, 
Determined to do the thing handy, 
He bought a 
rye loaf and a 
dozen pig's-feet, 
Some tripe and a 
bottle of brandy. 
Then they ate and they drank, and she thanked him so much ; 
"Poll 1" says he, " that is only a 
trifle," 
She fell straight in love with the man of three balls, 
But she told him he had a 
rival : 
A barber so brave, 
That lathered and shaved, 
Was ahead of the little pawnbroker. 
It was just about then that the barber popped in— 
The slaughter he then did begin it : 
He seized a 
pig's foot, and with that cut his throat— 
He fell down, and was dead in a 
minute. 
The sight of his corpse took the maiden aback, 
(Though his rival was bursting with laughter) ; 
She grasped the rye loaf, stabbed herself through the heart.

Came walking one after the other ! 
He jumped out of bed in a

And darted out into the passage ; 
With a

And his body was made into sausage! 
His troubles were past, 
For that was the last

Where the cooling waters glide,

Low o'er the silv'ry tide.

Round the portals of the tomb. 
When day's last sunbeams rested 
On her golden hair so bright,

"I am going home to-night. 
Not where the pine- trees whisper, 
Beside the murmuring sea, 
But with the white-robed angels, 
In that home will be." 
Thou Art so Near, and Yet You Ain't. 
AS St-NG BY JULE KEEN. 
I 
know a 
drink so pure and bright, 
The effects of which will make one tight; 
My mouth it draws, with smiles so kind, 
To Cunningham's ale-vault, and there I 
find 
Another horn as pure and clear, 
'Worth more than keg 
f 
lager beer. 
LOVE AMONG DER SNNEITZER SONGSTER. 
CHORUS. 
Beloved smile, of golden tint, 
Thou art so near, and yet you ain't! 
Beloved smile, of golden tint, 
Thou art so near, and yet you ain't 
That drink so soft makes me feel blue, 
To go it straight without the " dew ;" 
When its effect entranced I 
feel, 
What joy 
no pain 6f woe or weal, 
A world where I 
would gladly dwell 
Is Old Kentuck I 
love so well! (Cuonus.) 
Dead broke at last, with nary red, 
Without a 
smile, I'm almost dead ; 
No friend is here to ask me up ; 
Oh ! for a 
stamp to get a 
sup ! 
Those bottles there that brightly shine 
To me the purest love combine! (Cironus.) 
Then You'll Remember Me. 
AS SUNG BY NED TURNER. 
When other boys shall say they're in love 
With my young charming Nell, 
I'll stand right up and fight 'em fair, 
And make their eyeballs swell ; 
I'll serve them as I 
did a 
feller 
I 
caught with her at tea; 
I 
split him in the snout, and then I 
said, 
"Now you'll remember me." 
They took me up for ' sault and battery, 
And sent me down for trial; 
The case was proved, I 
found it was useless 
To give them a 
denial.

The judge then said, " You must have six months 
On Blackwell's Island ;" then he 
Began to laugh, and said, " My prairie chick- u-en, 
Now you'll remember me." 
Widders Beware. 
AS SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
Young Daniel was tall, 
But mighty short of cash ; 
Adown his upper lip there hung 
A delicate mustache. 
A ladies' man, indeed, was he, 
So handsome and so smart; 
But Dan-i-el, this nice young man, 
Was very false at heart. 
CHORUS. 
Then widders all, beware 
Of man, false-hearted man; 
And maidens, do take care 
To shun him, if you can. 
A widder first he met, 
Whose weeds, indeed, were few, 
And this poor widder really thought 
That Dan-i-el was true. 
But oh, alas! this widder she, 
Who hoped to be his bride, 
Discovered soon that he was false, 
Took " pizen," and she died. (CnoRus.) 
A maid he courted next, 
About a 
year or so, 
And she was, too, as fine a 
gal 
As ever had a 
beau. 
LOVE AMONG DER SWEITZER SONGSTER. 
But this poon maiden she found out, 
As many lovers do, 
That he was also false to her, 
Although her heart was true. (Cnonus.) 
" 
How could you treat me so, 
Oh, Dan-i-el ?" she cried; 
She fell and fainted in his arms, 
And finally she died I 
Her fate was very hard, indeed, 
And sad as it was true ; 
Believe it if you will or not, 
Her heart was broken in two. (Crronus.) 
63 
A widder gone to rest, 
A foolish maiden, too, 
Who " kicked the bucket" just because 
Her lover was not true. 
Then, ladies, never let your hearts— 
In early years or late— 
Incline to man, deceitful man; 
He'll break it, " sure as fate." (CnoRus.) 
Kissing Song. 
AS SUNG BY JULE KEEN. 
Let me kiss her for her mother, 
The bewitching Polly Ann; 
Let me kiss her for her brother, 
Or any other man. 
Let me kiss her for her " feller," 
And I 
do not care a 
red, 
If he taps me on the smeller, 
With his " billy " made of lead. 
Let me kiss her for her daddy— 
The pretty, pouting elf— 
Or. if that don't snit, the family, 
Let me kiss ht.r for herself. 
* LOVE AMONG DER SWEITZER SONGSTER. 
AS SUNG DY JULE KEEN. 
My pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
What makes you of me shy ? 
Meet me to-night at Taylor's, 
And sip the good old rye. 
The day is dawning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you, don't be shy, 
But meet me in the evening, 
And sip the good old rye. 
And when you finish yo.nr first glass, 
I'll give the bell a 
ring; 
The waiter, in his jacket white, 
To answer it shall spring. 
The day is waning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear ; 
The evening soon is coming, love, ,,••• 
In fact is almost here. 
k 
Then, pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you, don't be shy, 
But meet me, as I 
have proposed, 
And sip the good old rye.
