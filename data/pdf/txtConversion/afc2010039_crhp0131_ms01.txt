Female 1 : From the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian National Museum of 
African American History and Culture. 
EC: All right, this is Emilye Crosby with Jennifer Lawson in her home in Washington, 
DC, on December 11, 2015. We’re here with the Civil Rights History project co¬ 
sponsored by the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian National Museum of African 
American History and Culture. Thank you for doing the interview with us. 
Jennifer Lawson: Thank you for asking me to do this. It’s an honor. 
EC: We’re honored as well. Can you start by telling us when and where you were 
born and about your family? 
JL: Yes, I was born in Fairfield, Alabama. Fairfield is a suburb of Birmingham, 
Alabama. One street is Fairfield, the next street is Birmingham. And it’s on the Western 
side of the city, and I was bom there in 1946, in June of 1946. My father came from 
central Alabama. He was the fourteenth of fifteen children, and he then was bom in 
1899, and he left his—. He was born in what is now Bullock County, Alabama, near 
Jennifer Lawson 
2 
Union Springs. And he left that area when he was 15 years old and left working on the 
farm there and moved to Birmingham just really, essentially, ran away to find a job and 
find work in Birmingham. 
EC: Did he want to get away from the farm, or was he just—? 
JL: He wanted to get away from the farm, wanted to—. He had a third grade 
education. He was an incredibly curious man, really smart guy. And he wanted more. 
He wanted to be able to learn more. And he came to Birmingham. He went to 
Birmingham, and in Birmingham he got a job first in the coal mines there. And after 
working in the coal mines he then ended up driving the locomotive through the coal 
mines, and he started saving his money, and he bought a tractor, and he took it apart, put 
it back together again so that he would then know how to repair tractors. He did the same 
with a car, and then he started a little business that he called Lawson’s Repair. And he 
then he would essentially take everything apart, put it back together again and so—. 
EC: That’s amazing. 
JL: His business, he repaired washing machines, refrigerators, and the people that he 
served lived throughout the Birmingham area. And through him I ended up getting to 
travel to some of the places that were mining camps and company towns and to hear 
union leaders and when people were on strike in some of the company towns. It was 
quite—. There were these communities, Powderly, Bessemer, Brighton, and these were 
these other places, little towns that were company towns for Tennessee Coal and Iron, 
which later became a subsidiary of US Steel. 
EC: So he would take you with him when he was picking up or delivering or? 
JL: Right, exactly. 
Jennifer Lawson 
3 
EC: Would he ever go around and repair stuff where it was? 
JL: He did indeed. He often would. If a car had a break down it’s quite possible that 
he would then repair that car onsite, you know. Rather than towing it or anything he 
would repair it onsite. And he taught me and my brothers. When we were relatively 
young he taught us how to do some basic repairs so that I felt very comfortable with 
technology. It was something where when I was really small he insisted that I learn to 
rewire a motor and to create a motor, so I really began to understand the principals of 
how a motor worked, but it was boring to me to have to wind all of these coils of copper 
wire to actually create a motor from scratch. 
EC: That’s amazing. 
JL: But I learned those kinds of things, and then he would allow us to keep the money 
if we then did small repairs so that in the winter time when a car- someone’s battery 
didn’t start or something, and they needed a battery charged, those were things that we 
learned to do. 
EC: So it enhances his business gives you spending money. 
JL: Right. Exactly. 
EC: I’m just sort of amazed at that ability, that he could just learn how to do all of 
those things just by taking them apart. That’s kind of remarkable. 
JL: No, it was quite remarkable, and we have—. There’s an article we have been 
searching for, my brothers and I have been searching for. 
[5:00] We had heard about it when we were children, but we’ve never found it. It was 
...other people though, so many people around us talked about it that we felt that it must 
exist somewhere, and that was that during- around WWI, before I was born... I mean 
Jennifer Lawson 
4 
WWII, sorry, before I was bom, that during the—. Because there was gas rationing that it 
was very difficult, he liked to travel too. He really enjoyed seeing the world as much as 
he could and travelling, which meant that he would travel, drive places. He would drive 
from Birmingham to Toronto or from Birmingham to Los Angeles. 
And he then on one of these trips around 1945, he drove, apparently, from 
Birmingham to Canada, and the article that some people say was in LIFE magazine, but 
I’ve never found it, was—. The headline for it apparently was that this Birmingham man 
goes to Canada on one gallon of gas. And the reason that he was able to do the one 
gallon of gas is because he only needed the gasoline to start the car, to ignite the fuel, but 
then the rest of the journey he’d really be burning these low grade fuels like kerosene. 
And he had done some special convertor to allow him, in the car, with the car engine, that 
allowed him to do this. 
EC: Wow. 
JL: So he was, you know, an inventor in his own way too, and he was constantly—. 
He was a tinkerer. So we owned our own home, and we lived in Fairfield, and 
immediately behind there was a little small backyard, but the majority of our backyard 
was taken up with his business, his repair shop. And there would at any given moment 
would be, you know, two or three cars there for repair, and he had a couple of men who 
worked with him to help him, and then he’d also have a refrigerator or small appliances 
that he was working on too, fans. 
EC: It’s kind of amazing that he stayed in Birmingham, I think, or in that area, with 
that kind of curiosity. Do you have a sense of why he—. And an interest in travel. Was 
he connected to family or the community in a way? 
Jennifer Lawson 
5 
JL: I don’t think that that was necessarily what kept him there, but I think that we—. 
It’s not as though we were—. Had the financial wherewithal to—. 
EC: Pick up and move? 
JL: —pick up and move somewhere. I think that it was quite an achievement, I 
think, to live as comfortably as we were living where we did own our own home. But we 
were living in a community where people—. The economic range went from the doctor 
and the pharmacist who were a couple of blocks over who had sort of much more 
magnificent homes. We had just a little modest, you know, bungalow-style house, and 
then there were the kids who lived in the alley, and their houses were actually in the 
alley, and so in some of those when I was growing up, they didn’t even yet have 
plumbing, indoor plumbing, you know. 
EC: So, yeah, so a real remarkable—. 
JL: So you had that kind of economic mixture, and with my father’s business 
there any number of times when the mines were on a strike or when there were layoffs 
that instead of collecting cash for work that he would do, he would come home with all 
kinds of things, you know, it’s like—. 
EC: Barter? 
JL: Here’s a lady’s watch or a radio or something, but it was real barter—. 
EC: Yeah, whatever you could get for his—. 
JL: —business. Whatever he could get for it. That’s right, exactly. 
EC: I guess if your customer base doesn’t have money you don’t have—. 
JL: Yeah, right. 
Jennifer Lawson 
6 
EC: Did you ever think it was strange that he had you learning all of this along with 
your brothers, that he didn’t differentiate? 
JL: At first I did, but then it was something where I enjoyed it. I thought I liked it. I 
liked the fact that he didn’t differentiate. I liked the fact that he respected us as thinkers, 
not just as his children. I mean, there were times when he definitely treated us as his 
children, and we were subject to the same kind of corporal punishment as all the kids in 
the neighborhood, which was just awful, but there were other times when I feel that he 
respected us as thinkers. He would buy books, [10:00] he’d buy his version of the 
encyclopedia, and it was—. And for him, a good evening at home was that after he had 
worked that he would sit and readjust at random, you know, from the encyclopedia. And 
it was something that was a kind of curiosity that inspired me as well. 
For travelling he’d talk about other places in the world, but as I said, he’d talk 
about places that he wanted to go to, but it was quite something for us, in our community, 
for us. The other people would marvel at the fact that we then would go to Mexico or go 
to Canada. 
EC: That’s just sort of in general out of reach in your community? 
JL: Right, exactly, exactly. 
JL: What did you like about the travel? 
JL: Oh, just the fact of seeing the rest of the world. I mean, one part of it was that 
here we were in Birmingham, and that in Fairfield we had our own little protected 
community in some ways, and of course none of these places are actually truly protected, 
but we had a little parallel universe of the—. So it was totally segregated during the time 
that I was growing up, I mean, absolutely segregated. There were signs in downtown 
Jennifer Lawson 
7 
Fairfield that said Laundromat, White Only; Gas Station, White Only; restaurants, all the 
business. 
And the bus stopped in front of my house that then went to downtown 
Birmingham. It was just, you could get on the bus and for, you know, really cheap, go to 
downtown Birmingham, but it was that kind of segregated bus that had the moveable 
barriers that were White on one side, Colored on the other, and you were supposed to sit 
behind it. And we kids would play with that by then getting on the bus, and we usually, 
in our neighborhood, we would get on it would be pretty empty, so we’d get on and move 
the barrier up towards the front. 
EC: So Whites didn’t have any space? 
JL: So Whites didn’t have any space to sit by the time it, you know, moved around to 
their neighborhood on its journey. 
EC: Would you get in trouble? 
JL: Of course. 
EC: But not serious trouble? 
JL: But not serious trouble. Yeah, we were never threatened or anything. I mean, the 
driver would, you know, sort of make us, you know, yell at us and tell us to move back. 
EC: Well, you know, I’ve seen the images and heard people talk about like in 
Montgomery in some of the testimony of the cases that came out related to the bus 
boycott that the front of the bus reserved for Whites would be empty because Whites 
didn’t even ride the bus in as high of numbers, and so moving it seems like a perfectly 
reasonable thing to do. 
Jennifer Lawson

JL: So we had this somewhat protected world and it was—. We had our own doctors, 
pharmacists, dentist, and so my father was a part of that world in that he was the repair 
person. People were organized by churches in part, but we were a little bit different in 
that respect too that while my father belonged to the largest Baptist church there. He was 
active there. He didn’t require us to go. He required that we should go to a church on 
Sundays, but it didn’t have to be his church. 
EC : That’s very interesting. 
JL: So he encouraged this kind of free thinking. Now I haven’t mentioned my 
mother. My mother had been—. Before they married she had been a school teacher, and 
she had attended college, so she taught school. But after we were—. My brother, I have a 
brother who’s two years older, and after he was bom she stopped working and was a 
housewife. And so she would from time to time go work as a substitute teacher at the 
schools, but for the most part she didn’t work. She spent a lot of her time reading. 
EC: Oh, really? 
JL: Mm-hmm, so she read novels. She read—. Mostly I don’t remember any real 
nonfiction books, but I do remember novels and magazines. 
EC: Do you have a sense of whether she missed that work, being able to work? Do 
you know? 
JE: I think she did. I think she, for me, she is a rather tragic figure because I think 
that she was lonely in some ways and missed the world that she would have had [15:00] 
had she been working. 
Jennifer Lawson 
9 
EC: And was that something—. I mean, obviously, I don’t know if you know 
this, within their relationship, did your father want her to be home, or did she feel like she 
should be? 
JL: I think that it was a sign of, for those times, I think that that was a sign of 
wellbeing. I think that for the men of that world that it was a sign that they were a good 
provider, and it was a sign of how well they were doing that their wives didn’t work. 
And there were other women in the neighborhood who, you know, to make ends meet, 
they had little home businesses where they were the Avon lady, or they were the hair 
stylist, but working out of their kitchen as a hair stylist, not out of a real shop or a salon, 
or a seamstress. So there were all kinds, but my mother didn’t work at all, you know. 
She didn’t work, but I don’t think it was something that really suited her that well, and I 
think that she was really depressed because of that. You know, you don’t think of it as 
being depressed when you’re a child, but when you look back and you recognize that, oh, 
this is what’s wrong with that picture, you know. 
EC: You started to talk about what the travel meant to you, and then I think we got 
diverted. 
JL: Yes, so the travel, for me, and I got diverted because I wanted you to understand 
that it really was this truly segregated world and that it was a world where you couldn’t 
go to a descent library, and Ell come back to that. You know, please, Ed like to come 
back to the library part, but instead you—. So it was so constricted, and when we would 
travel we would go to places like we’d come here to Washington, DC, or we would go to 
New York. And my father then was always the one, the leader of these excursions, and 
we went, when we were children, we went to the Museum of Natural History, the Hayden 
Jennifer Lawson 
10 
Planetarium, and those places in New York so much that I had grown to hate them. It 
was like, “Oh no, not again. I don’t want to see the mummies. I don’t want to see—.” 
EC: Too educational. 
JL: But you appreciated it very much, but it was—. And he would have this—. He sort 
of was our tour guide. 
EC: Today is the Coney Island day? 
JL: Well, he had this narration. There were some things like I keep trying to 
remember where it was. There was some place where they had an exhibit that was these 
stones from someplace like Peru or some—. But he wanted us to understand that the 
people had built those without any mortar, and that they had cut the stones so precisely 
that you couldn’t slip a sheet of paper between them. So it was that kind of—. 
EC: That’s pretty intense. 
JL: Yeah, it was that kind of narration that went with it. 
EC: You can’t just go look at the dinosaurs? 
JL: No. So he had all of these details of things that really were interesting to him, and 
he expected that they should be of equal interest to us, and that one day at the 
Smithsonian, you know, certainly at the Museum of Natural—. One day was not enough. 
You needed multiple days to go. 
EC: Sounds like he should have been a teacher. 
JL: So he was in his own way very much so, very much so. And we used to joke and 
say that, “Boy, if he had a real education he would have been really dangerous.” 
EC: It sounds like it. 
Jennifer Lawson 
11 
JL: ( ) The travel, for me, was this exposure to this much, much broader world. It 
was a place where, coming to New York, going to New York you didn’t feel that, “Oh, 
Whites must live here. Blacks must live here.” We visited relatives who lived in 
integrated neighborhoods. 
EC: So it really makes that seem like an arbitrary—. 
JL: Right, exactly, exactly. You went to, you know, you got on the New York 
subway, you got on a bus in New York City, and it’s just people on a bus. You went to a 
pizza place or you went to a restaurant or something, and in Birmingham the only 
restaurants you could go to were the, you know, sort of soul food Black-owned places. 
And for the larger White restaurants, you couldn’t go there to eat, and if you wanted their 
food then they had the little window [20:00] in the back. 
EC: Would you do that? Would anybody in your family do that? 
JL: There were times where if a new restaurant that was supposed to have something 
very tasty or something, there were times when people would then go and try the food 
and, you know, to—. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
Jennifer Lawson 
12 
JL: Okay. In Birmingham you couldn’t use the library. To avoid integrating things 
there was one point where they even took the seats out. So it was, you know, you could— 
. But we were relegated to these segregated libraries that had, you know, sort of worn 
books and these tattered books, and so it was—. In Fairfield we then, the women in my 
community, had started their own library. And so I and some of the other kids, we 
volunteer and help with the library. 
EC: Oh, cool. 
JL: There was a pharmacist, our pharmacist, Dr. Parham, P-A-R-H-A-M. He owned 
a building, Parham’s Apothecary, and his building was sort of the center of our little 
Black world. And that was the place where I had my first job where I got paid really, 
separate from working for my father, and that was working in Dr. Parham’s store. And I 
worked at the counter, and he had ice cream and, you know, I sold ice cream to my 
friends. But his wife, Mrs. Parham, then took one of the rooms above the drug store and 
made it a library, made it a community library, and she and several other women of the 
community then maintained that library. 
EC: Was it a popular place? 
JL: It was for us. I don’t know how many people used it, but for my generation it was 
an important place, yeah. 
EC: So you’ve talked about this a little bit already, but can you talk about sort of how 
you encountered race and understood it when you were young? 
JE: I think the first time I became really conscious of race was when I was very 
young, probably about five or so, four, five. It was directly across from my house. My 
Jennifer Lawson 
13 
house was at the corner of a rather busy intersection, and when I say busy we’re talking 
about relative terms here. 
EC: We’re not talking DC? 
JL: No, we’re talking relative terms. People actually did walk past because 
they used the sidewalks and walked past because there was a mailbox on the corner. The 
bus stop was on that same corner, and across the street from my house there was a store. 
The store, from the time that I can remember as a child, the store was owned by the 
Ragusa family, and they were Italian Americans. The grandparents lived there and were 
the ones who had first, you know, when I was really small they had started the store, but 
then they had—. There was this younger family, I assume their children. The son and his 
wife and children worked in the store and they lived adjacent to the store. So they lived— 
. This was a White, Italian American family living in the store, and this was not 
uncommon. You had then one of these—. Probably for every six blocks you had then 
one of these little Italian American grocers. 
EC: Interesting. 
JL: I played with this girl, Teresa Ragusa, who lived across the street, and she and I 
were like best friends because we’d get up in the morning, and we’d go out and play. 
And so since she was right across the street we played together, and the other kids, you 
know, she played with the other African American kids, and there came that point when 
it was time for us to go to elementary school, and that’s when her relatives and my, you 
know, Black friends said you can’t play together anymore. 
EC: Really? 
JL: And we sort of didn’t get it. We didn’t understand. 
Jennifer Lawson 
14 
EC: And you’re getting it from both sides. 
JL: Right, exactly, [25:00] that you can’t play together any more. 
EC: Would you to sneak and play? 
JL: Well, she would be on the other side. We’d stand there talking to each other from 
our respective sides of the street. 
EC: That’s so sad. 
JL: Oh, it really was, you know, I’d be sort of saying, “Look, I got a new doll.” And 
then she would sort of say, “Oh, could you come over?” And I’d say, “No, I can’t.” And 
she would say, “Oh, and I can’t come over.” So it was this sort of separation like that. 
So that was my first sort of consciousness of that, okay, it’s a world where we are 
separated by race, and then I’d hear the adults—. There would be the times where you’d 
hear the adults talking about something really awful that had happened, you know, a 
lynching or things that they were talking about. 
EC: Would they try to protect you from that, or would they try to teach you about it? 
JL: They really didn’t talk to us directly about it, but you’d hear. They wouldn’t stop 
talking just because you were in the room or around. 
EC: So they didn’t try to keep it from you, but they weren’t really engaging with it? 
JL: Right, exactly, exactly. 
EC: Do you remember any of the things that you heard them talk about? 
JL: The worst thing, and I don’t—. I was older when this happened. I don’t 
remember what year it occurred, but it was well-documented. There was a news article. 
There were several news articles about it. Was of an African American man who was 
kidnapped and castrated in Birmingham, and that the people, the White men, who 
Jennifer Lawson 
15 
kidnapped him to sort of harm him even more they poured kerosene on the wound, and 
unbeknownst to them that actually saved his life. That caused the blood to clot so he did 
not bleed to death, but instead that actually saved his life. That became something that 
people talked about. 
EC: That’s awful. 
JL: Yeah, yeah, so that was—. You knew that that was a part of this world as well. 
EC: And did you connect that to yourself, like that something like that could happen to 
you or your community? 
JL: Oh, you very definitely did. I mean, you know, you knew that this was a world 
where you knew about—, I knew of the Ku Klux Klan, and I knew that the Klan had 
marched somewhere. I didn’t know how close or how far it was from me, but I knew of 
the Ku Klux Klan. I knew what it looked like, what an image of them looked like, you 
know. I knew that there were all of these awful and threatening things that Whites did to 
Black people. 
EC: Yeah, were you aware of the bombs in Birmingham? Was it bombing hill? 
JL: It was, of course. And by the time that that was really more intense then I was 
getting towards high school or already in high school, and we would go back and forth. 
Birmingham, as I said, we lived just, you know, Fairfield is a suburb, but it’s truly just 
right there adjacent to Birmingham. And about maybe six blocks from my house there 
was a small historically Black college, Miles College. And the college was financially 
not doing terribly well, but it was a place where there were then college professors and 
others who were there at Miles, but because of the state of disrepair we considered it a 
playground. 
Jennifer Lawson 
16 
EC: They’re trying to save the college, and for you it’s a playground. 
JL: Right, because we could ride our bikes around. There was no traffic on the 
campus and things, but it was—. That too became a place of community in a sense. One 
year, for example, my mother and some of the other people in the neighborhood, I don’t 
remember my father participating in this, but some of the other people in the 
neighborhood, we went to Miles College to a screening of the film Imitation of Life. 
EC: Oh, yeah. 
JL: That it had been banned, I think, or they couldn’t play it at the segregated Black 
theater downtown, the Carver Theater, named after George Washington Carver, of 
course. So we couldn’t go to the Carver Theater to see this film, but the Miles College 
was doing a screening of it, and so we went to this screening of Imitation of Life. And 
this was one of the earlier versions of it. [30:00] There have been several versions of that, 
but this was one of the earlier versions of it, and I don’t know if you’re familiar with it, 
but it’s a, you know, great melodrama, the woman who’s passing for White. 
EC: So what did you think of that when you were young? 
JL: Oh, it became to me, that was one of, I feel, one of the few times that we as 
younger people were having a discussion about race with our parents and with, you 
know, multigenerational—. 
EC: So the screening included a discussion? 
JL: The screening didn’t include a discussion, but we just at home, and ours was a 
society of front porches. 
EC: Yeah, and so there was lots of discussion. 
JL: Lots of discussion. 
Jennifer Lawson 
17 
EC: Yeah, what did people think about the idea of passing? 
JL: Oh, there were people who, you had people in your family, you know. Everybody 
sort of knew someone who was passing, who had disappeared. There were families of—. 
We had some friends who within their families there were people who they were very, 
very light-skinned and it was almost as though they were prohibited by their families 
from marrying anybody darker. 
EC: Want to preserve that light. 
JL: Preserve the lightness or go towards even more lightness if possible, and it would 
then—. You’d hear that one person from the family had, you know, was passing now, and 
so they were—. 
EC: We talked to Vernon Dahmer’s family, and you know, they said that quite a few 
family members had left and crossed over the line. 
JL: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, it was a fairly common occurrence in that way. 
EC: Birmingham. How were you aware of that, or what kind of impact did that have? 
JL: Well, we would move back and forth readily. I took music lessons in 
Birmingham. I studied violin, and I’d go on Saturdays for my music lesson, and at 
another point I studied piano. And there was a Black business street in downtown 
Birmingham, and we would go over to these activities, and I also had a relative who 
taught at a high school, the most prominent high school in Birmingham, Parker High. 
Through her then, she knew like, for example, Angela Davis’s family or this attorney 
Arthur Shores, and that these were people who lived on this street of this sort of wealthier 
Black families, Center Street. They had lovely suburban-style, ranch-style houses 
arrayed along that street, and the attorney, Arthur Shores, was one who’s house was 
Jennifer Lawson 
18 
regularly bombed. Later, with urban renewal, ha, that they then also built—. When they 
started talking about the freeway they destroyed that community specifically. 
EC: And it was one that Whites were angry about because African Americans are 
encroaching or building nice homes? Is that—? 
JL: It wasn’t encroaching. This was a community that had been traditionally Black, 
but it was just the fact that these were people who had nice homes, and so if you can 
destroy any place, let’s do that one. 
EC: So getting out of their place with homes so nice? 
JL: Yeah. 
EC: What were your schools like? 
JL: The schools were—. I went to Robinson Elementary school, and the school was, 
you know, these were all segregated schools again in Fairfield, and they were very poor 
in terms of classroom resources, equipment, the teachers were not, you know, you had a 
mixture. You had some teachers who had very little training, had gone to Alabama State 
and studied education, and then you also had people who were absolutely brilliant, and 
people who would have in today’s world probably gone on to Yale or Harvard or some 
place and, you know, taught at a major university or at an Ivy League school, but they 
were then relegated in that segregated world to these limited choices, and so each of these 
schools would generally have someone like that. 
EC: So you were exposed to both very, very good and poor—. 
JL: Right. 
EC: Educational at the same time. 
Jennifer Lawson 
19 
JL: Exactly, exactly, there were people you felt, though, that people cared. For 
example, at my elementary school, at both the elementary school and the high school, 
[35:00] the people who were the school lunchroom ladies, they cared about the quality of 
their food because they lived right there in the neighborhood. So they didn’t want you 
going home and saying what they had prepared was inedible. Instead, you know, you’d 
likely go home and say, “Oh my goodness, she made the best peach cobbler.” And they 
were using food that was allocated to the school, and in some cases it was the 
government subsidy. So it’s, you know, somebody says, “They could do remarkable 
things with those cans of government cheese,” you know. 
EC: Yeah, it’s not a lot of variety. It’s not a lot of fresh stuff. 
JL: Right, right, but they did quite remarkable things, but the quality—. There were 
people who, they cared. They cared about us as kids too quite often. 
EC: So they had a real connection. There was a sense of community with the school. 
JL: Right, right, and so there were some kids whose families, you know, one kid 
whose mother was an alcoholic, and people—. It was not just the teachers, but other 
people in the community would quite often try to reach out to families like that to be 
really supportive and helpful too. You know, you felt this sort of sense of community 
and of caring. The high school hand-me-down band uniforms, hand-me-down musical 
instruments, the books, you know, we got the books after Fairfield high school had used 
them. 
Fairfield High School was the White school, and then ours was Fairfield Industrial High 
School. This gave me a sense of connection to all the way back to that world of Booker 
T Washington because this was the argument that, “Oh, they need to have this industrial 
Jennifer Lawson 
20 
training, and that everybody shouldn’t go to college.” So you had a mixture of the 
vocational education as well as the college prep. It wasn’t called college prep, but you 
had that mixture in the school. 
EC: So that influence was still present. It wasn’t just the name? 
JL: Right, right, no, it was Fairfield Industrial High School. In the school, one of the 
saving graces of my life, and for many of us who lived there, was that we had this 
remarkable man, Edmund J. Oliver, EJ Oliver, who then was the principal of the high 
school. One of the alums has written a book about him. He was tough. He was really 
tough, but he really sort of ran the school almost as if it was a private school even though 
he was dealing with, you know, this mixture of kids, the majority of whom were kids of 
miners and people who worked in the coal mines and the steel mills and who lived in 
allies with substandard housing with no plumbing, and that’s the majority of the student 
body. 
Occasionally you had this family that was a little wealthier and could go to London and 
Paris or something. Then you had the ones like my family. So he had this real range and 
mixture, but he put an emphasis on, “trying to make ladies and gentlemen out of all of 
us,” and his rules, and all of his homilies of, you know, “Dare to struggle. Dare to win.” 
We, of course, resented that kind of authority, but on the other hand we respected it, and 
later, after we had graduated from school, people appreciated him so much that we even 
had alumni chapters in different cities all around the country even though the school no 
longer exists. 
EC: That’s interesting. 
Jennifer Lawson 
21 
JL: We still have—. Every other year on the even numbered years on the Fourth of 
July weekend we have a reunion. 
EC: You know, that seems like one of the valuable things of some schools in that era 
where everybody was expected to do well regardless of background. You described to 
me another time when we were talking about a family trip, [40:00] and you were going 
through Mississippi, and your family was stopped. Can you talk about that? 
JL: Yes, very definitely. This was on one of the trips west, you know, we would 
sometimes go to Los Angeles, Pasadena, and when we’d do that we’d even loop down 
through Mexico and come back. So one time we were in Mississippi, and it was 
nighttime, and we were stopped by the police. They came over, and the policeman 
shown his flashlight into the car at my father and said, “So boy, boy, where you going?” 
And my father said, “Oh,” he says, “I just got these little cotton pickers in the back here,” 
pointing at us, and he says, “I’m just looking for some work, just looking for some work 
for them.” 
EC: Your father was quick on his feet. 
JL: And of course we were resentful like crazy that he’s calling us little cotton pickers 
and everything. Then that completely disarmed though the policeman, you know, and his 
thing was, “Oh, well, you know, I think if you go over there I think they might be hiring 
somebody over—.” 
EC: That must have been a really mixed feeling because of course if he doesn’t do that 
who knows what will happen , and yet, on the other hand he has to be subservient. 
JL: Right, right, and it bothered us to see him, I mean, we of course thought the world 
of our father, and it bothered us to see him be subservient to people who—. Because he 
Jennifer Lawson 
22 
had a lot of White customers too, and they would bring their cars and everything, so that 
was the, “Boy,” you know, “how soon you think you’ll have this one fixed? You think 
my car will be ready by Thursday, boy?” You know, so it was, yeah. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: Did you ever see him challenge that kind of treatment? 
JL: No, no, we never saw him challenge that, never, no. We never saw him either 
challenge it, but we also never saw him sort of being obsequious in any way. His 
answers were straightforward, but it wasn’t as though he was being hat in hand 
obsequious either. He was active with the masons and with other civic groups. They had 
a burial society, so he was active with these groups of men, and they would read papers. 
We had a local Birmingham Mirror I think it was called. We had a little local Black 
newspaper, and the Pittsburgh Courier was another paper, and the Chicago Defender. We 
would get all of those Black papers, and so they would talk about things that were 
happening. 
And he took great pride in the fact that he had at one point been a business partner 
with this guy AG Gaston, Arthur Gaston. And Gaston became one of the first Black 
millionaires, and Gaston went on to... who was in Birmingham, and sometimes we 
would go over to the Gaston’s. It was quite wonderful because Mrs. Gaston was very 
gracious and would show us her latest buys from Paris or New York. They would invite 
us kids to swim in their swimming pool too, which we liked. 
EC: Oh, I bet you did. Was that at the hotel, or was that at their home? 
JL: This was at their home. 
Jennifer Lawson 
23 
EC: Wow. 
JL: Yeah, this was at their home. 
EC: That’s something. So you said your dad would talk about what was in the papers? 
JL: But again, it wasn’t so much—. They would talk about it, but it was more again 
this kind of matter of fact talk of, you know, this has happened. But it wasn’t “people 
should” or there was no sign of action or thought of—. 
EC : Was your father or mother regi stered to vote? 
JL: Yes, they both were. My father was also active with the Republican party. Most 
of the people that I knew, they were all Republicans. One of the reasons that they were 
Republicans was because the Democratic Party at that time, throughout Alabama, [45:00] 
was connected to the Dixiecrats. It was really connected to White citizens, councils, 
some of the most racist groups. And so they then were very much a part of the 
Republican Party. One of his trips that we didn’t go on, I want to think that he may have 
gone to California to a Republican political convention at some point. 
EC: I’m trying to think. I know one of the conventions from 1960 was in California, 
and I can’t remember which it was. One was in California and one was in Chicago that 
year. What awareness did you have of the Civil Rights Movement? As it’s growing 
stronger you’re probably what, middle school and high school? 
JL: We didn’t make the distinctions of calling it middle school. You went elementary 
through grade eight, and then ninth grade through twelfth was high school. My first 
awareness of it was the Montgomery bus boycott. So I would have been about nine, I 
guess, then. 
EC: That makes sense. 
Jennifer Lawson 
24 
JL: With the bus boycott there was—, I knew who Rosa Parks was. I knew about the 
demonstrations and the boycotts, and we had had some kind of boycotts and some 
activities in Birmingham, and the people in my world had been a part of that. 
EC: Did you know Reverend Shuttlesworth or ever go to meetings? 
JL: I did not know him, and I knew of him. I knew who he was, but I did not. 
EC: How far away is Montgomery from your community? 
JL: Montgomery was at that time, I think it’s about 120 miles or so, and this was pre- 
freeways, so you had to go through some pretty god-awful towns. There was this one 
town in Alabaster, and it was like a speed trap. So you sort of eased your way slowly 
through Alabaster because it had both the speed trap aspect of it, but you also worried 
then about being stopped by police. So it was a longer journey than 120 miles needs to 
be, but. 
EC: So it doesn’t feel as close as it would today? 
JL: No, no, but we did go to Montgomery, and we went to Montgomery because each 
year, maybe once or twice each year, we would go down to my father’s, where he had all 
of those relatives in Bullock County. And there were a couple of times when we spent 
two weeks in the summer on the farm with all relatives down there, which was yet 
another world. 
EC: Did you enjoy the farm? 
JE: I did. I did very much so. And again, it was one where my father had introduced 
me to it in a way of just sort of taking us out there, and there we are, and he sort of says, 
you know, like “This is our land as far as you can see and as far as you can walk. This is 
our land.” You know, “Our folks own this land.” And so he would then take us and 
Jennifer Lawson 
25 
show us things like there was one place where there’s a spring that comes out from the 
ground with this mossy spring water, and the water was delicious, but it was ice cold 
water that was coming from underground. So, you know, those were marvelous things to 
us, and he would show us different plants and things. I remember him disliking it when 
he showed me a thistle plant and show me how to, you know, he had me rub it on my 
hand. 
EC: Experiential learning. 
JL: Yes, exactly, and it hurt. 
EC: Em sure it did. 
JL: But he’d take us out, and I learned to use a rifle. We were talking about people 
who hunt, and that in our house we always had several guns, mostly rifles and things. So 
he would show us, take us and start with the tin cans. And then, watch out birds and 
squirrels, you know. 
EC: Yeah, did you like shooting? 
JE: I did not really. I liked the tins cans. I liked the sort of practice of it’s like a game 
and a sport, and you’re trying to become accurate about it, but to me there was no joy in 
killing anything, you know. Even [50:00] a rodent to me would not be fun to kill in that 
way, so I didn’t like that. But I did enjoy lining up the tin cans and shooting them. 
EC: Target practice. 
JL: But then I just became fearful. More concerned about all of the awful things that 
could happen with guns because in our community back in Fairfield there were a few 
years where it was popular for kids to get BB guns, these little air rifles, pellet guns, for 
Jennifer Lawson 
26 
Christmas gifts. And then there were the awful stories about people losing an eye to a 
pellet gun. 
EC: It seems like every time a BB gun goes off it’s headed for someone’s eye. 
JL: Yes, it’s headed for someone’s eye. 
EC : It’s like a homing pigeon. 
JL: So with those stories, I don’t know whether those were suburban legends or what, 
but it was not of interest to me. 
EC: What about other elements of the Civil Rights Movement? 
JL: The first was the bus boycott, and so knowing about the bus boycott, that was my 
first introduction. And then I want to think, but it’s a hazy memory, that there were some 
boycotts around stores, some idea of boycotts around stores because of treatment. And it 
came more into focus though, when I was in high school with the Freedom Rides. And 
that was very definitely something that we were, you know, glued to radio, TV, watching 
news, looking at newspapers, and you know, getting word about what was happening, 
particularly as the Freedom Riders came towards Birmingham and the treatment they’d 
get where I think it was Anniston and then Birmingham. So that was all something that 
was very, very palpable. 
EC: Did you go into Birmingham when Freedom Riders were in Birmingham? 
JL: Not in connection with them. We went to downtown Birmingham probably every 
week. Every week we were, and sometimes multiple like, as I mentioned, I would go 
over for my music lessons in the summer. I went swimming there. Since Fairfield had 
no public swimming pools I went swimming in Birmingham, and so there were all these 
kinds of activities that we were constantly moving. We had relatives that lived in one 
Jennifer Lawson 
27 
other part of Birmingham, so we were just always moving back and forth through. That 
whole geography was my world, so I didn’t think of it as separate. And it was an easy 
kind of movement back and forth. I could bike to the swimming pools. I could bike to 
some of these places. 
EC: It’s almost like it’s the same. The Freedom Rides going through Birmingham 
must have made that seem very real. 
JL: Oh, very much so. 
EC: ( ) in your community. 
JL: R-ight, no, very much so, so the Freedom Rides were very definitely a big deal, 
and then also when Martin Luther King and the demonstrations of Martin Luther King in 
Birmingham Jail, and the call then for students to participate. That was the first time that 
we then, and I was in high school, and Professor Oliver, our principal, forbade us to 
participate and leave campus. In fact, he sort of, you know, locked the school doors 
because he didn’t want us participating in the demonstrations, and that that was just the 
wrong thing to do with a group of—. 
EC: You wished he hadn’t. 
JL: Yeah, because then of course we then left school against his orders and went 
downtown Birmingham to participate. Some of the kids, some of my classmates, were 
arrested, and this is now the Kelly Ingram Park—. 
EC: [19]63? 
JL: —demonstrations and things. Some people were arrested. Some were, you know, 
hit with the fire hoses and everything. I was not. I wasn’t in that area when those events 
took place. But I had left school and was participating in these demonstrations. 
Jennifer Lawson 
28 
EC: Were you arrested? 
JL: No, no, not at that time. 
EC : What did your parents think? 
JL: By then my mother had passed away. My mother had died, and my father, though 
at first he was then upset that we had disobeyed, because I think that the principal called 
our parents, and you know, [55:00] so we were suspended, I think, from school. And so 
for a couple of weeks we were, you know, being castigated for what we had done. It 
wasn’t that we were being castigated for participating in the civil rights activities. It was 
for disobeying our elders. 
EC: Is that coming from your father or the principal? 
JL: The principal but with parents. 
EC: Piling on? 
JL: Piling on, and then it turned at some point. There was a point at which it changed 
where then we were being hailed as heroes. 
EC : Do you think it’s when the victory came, or you mean over time? 
JL: This was right during that time period it became okay that we had done this. So 
by the time I graduated from high school in May of [19]63 it was okay. This wasn’t 
mentioned because I think the principal was still smarting from the fact that we had 
disobeyed him, but now it was not as though this was an awful thing that we had done. I 
think doing so gave me greater confidence. I think that we, I and my classmates, we 
certainly felt that we did the right thing. Ant that with my father we went to a couple of 
mass meetings, but I don’t remember precisely what the meetings were about. I know 
Jennifer Lawson 
29 
that they were connected still to the campaign that King and others, SCLC had in 
reference to Birmingham. 
EC: Do you remember what it was like to be in the mass meetings, how you felt? 
JL: I felt it was a very positive feeling, and the only other time that I had experienced 
that was when we had gone to that screening that I mentioned at Miles College when I 
was younger. Because it was the people of my community, that we were a community, 
but we were a community around an issue or a topic, not a community around a funeral 
because that’s generally when we would gather in a church or in any place where we’re 
sitting down in a large group, you know, over fifty. And to my sense this was probably 
like a hundred people or more, and you know, crowded churches. These were the only 
times when we were then there for a serious conversation about a topic, and not for a 
preacher haranguing us about you know, fire and brimstone and—. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
JL: I don’t. Not at that point. Later, but I don’t remember hearing him speak when I 
was in high school in Birmingham. 
EC: When you were in high school did you have any sense that you would ultimately 
immerse yourself in the movement and become a full-time—? 
JL: Not at all, very definitely not, not at all. At that point I really thought that I would 
have a career in medicine. And I was focused more on the sciences, and I thought that I 
would probably live in New York and work in New York. 
Jennifer Lawson 
30 
EC: You mentioned to me another time that you had internships in the summer in New 
York. Is that one of the influences? 
JL: Right. 
EC: Can you talk about those? 
JL: It’s interesting because that was one of the conflicts that I had with my civil rights 
work, having at that age to make some really hard choices and tough decisions. In the 
summer of [19]63 I was in New York, so I did not participate. I followed the March on 
Washington in the newspaper and television, but I was in New York working at Sloan 
Kettering Center because I had this internship there. 
EC: How did you get that? Do you know? 
JL: Yes, I know exactly how I got that. My father, as I mentioned, my father was 
born in 1899, and so my father [1:00:00] was an older father in one sense, and he had had 
a previous family. He had been married before, and his first wife had died, and in his 
first marriage he had two daughters. He had another child too who didn’t survive, a 
young guy who died as a young boy. But he had these daughters, and so I had two 
sisters, and my sisters lived in New York City. And my sisters worked at Sloan 
Kettering. They were lab technicians. 
My father had seemed to be in some ways the proverbial Jewish mother where he 
wanted a doctor in the family. And so he had tried that with them and had not succeeded, 
but he had gotten to the point that they had become lab technologists. So they were lab 
technicians, and they worked at Sloan Kettering, and they worked in cancer research. 
And so when they then learned that there was this internship program they invited me to 
Jennifer Lawson 
31 
apply for it, and I was accepting. So they said that I could stay with one of them while I 
went through there, and it just happened to be the year too that they were both pregnant. 
EC: Interesting timing. 
JL: And so I ended up also having newborn nephews. 
EC: Wow, that’s quite an experience. Did it give you a sense of what you wanted in 
your immediate future? 
JL: Well, I was most impressed. lloved working in New York City, yeah. The 
children were interesting, but I had been around babies in my community. Sadly even at 
that point teenage girls would have their own kids and everything, and I knew that was 
not something that I wanted. 
EC: Not right now. 
JL: No, but what I did really love, I loved living in New York. So I stayed in Queens 
with my sister and would take the train into Manhattan each day, worked at Sloan 
Kettering, and through the people at Sloan Kettering I met—. There was one woman who 
worked there as well. She was a nurse, and she was originally, I think, from Sweden, but 
she became a friend, and invited me sometimes to stay over in the city with her and her 
roommates. And one of her roommates was a flight attendant and another worked at the 
UN, and they would invite me to, you know, parties and things. 
So this was all quite heady stuff for, I think I was 16 or 17 years old at the time. 
So this was absolutely wonderful. And we’d go to plays, and I saw the Flying Dutchman. 
I saw several other really wonderful plays, and saw experimental theater as well. My 
sister leaned towards the Broadway musicals, my older sister did, and so I’d go to those 
with her, you know, but in addition to that then these friends that I had met liked things 
Jennifer Lawson 
32 
that were a lot more intellectually challenging and much more cosmopolitan. So it was 
just wonderful. 
EC: It sounds like you had a lot more opportunities to see the outside world than your 
average southern kid. 
JL: Right, exactly, exactly, so I was, you know, really enjoying that experience, but I 
also felt that I should be at the March on Washington. And I would talk with the doctors 
there about this. I made some really nice friendships for that time, and we’d talk about 
this. 
EC: Were they interested, supportive? 
JL: They were supportive. They were. All of them were absolutely supportive, and 
they even sort of said that if I was interested that one was, at that point, a dean at Cornell, 
and said that if I was interested he would help me get into Cornell, and then I could then 
go to Cornell’s medical school. And so they were very, very supportive. So I had this 
wonderful array of friends there, but I also then felt by virtue of what I was reading about 
and what was happening in the movement that I should be, you know, in terms of the 
March on Washington, that that’s where I should be as well. 
EC: Did you try to figure out how to get there? Did you get that far? 
JL: No, no, because I knew it was, you know—. 
EC: A lost cause? 
JL: Yeah. 
EC: Were you interested in being a doctor? Did that appeal to you? 
JE: I was. I was very. At that point I was interested. I felt that I was good at science 
[1:05:00] and particularly at biology. I thought that I could be a very competent doctor, a 
Jennifer Lawson 
33 
good doctor, but it was also something where the experience that year at Sloan Kettering 
that I began to realize too though that I didn’t want to work with people who were dying. 
I didn’t work directly with patients. Instead I was doing this lab work and doing the 
math. This was pre-computers. So we’d do these lab tests, and you’d do the readings, 
and then I’d spend the last half of the afternoon doing all of these computations, and you 
were doing those with one of these big calculators and a slide rule. 
EC: Wow, yeah. 
JL: And I loved my slide rule. 
EC: Did you? 
JL: And I was so thrilled that I had mastered the slide rule. So you’d do all of these 
computations, and then you’d give the results to the doctors, and that’s the way—. You 
were doing blood and urine analysis, and they would then make decisions about 
treatment. And then there would be times when they would say, “Oh, you don’t have to 
do this person’s anymore. You can just discard that.” And that meant that the person had 
died. 
EC: That must have been tough. 
JL: And so that was something that I felt was like, I don’t know. I’m not so sure 
about being doctor. 
EC: Yeah, especially not one working in cancer treatment perhaps. 
JL: And then the next year I went back to Sloan Kettering. The summer of [19]64 
they invited me back. I went back the summer of [19]64, and this time I thought, well, 
maybe I should focus more on the research side, and this was now, they were doing the 
experiments with the lab animals, you know, with the dogs, and you’d inject the dye into 
Jennifer Lawson 
34 
the dogs, the rats, and tracing tumors and things. So that was also not exactly something 
that—. It gave you a real sense of how challenging and how difficult this work was and 
how we were so clueless about cancer. And there was one doctor who I worked with. I 
don’t remember his name, and he was so highly respected because he had done some 
kind of isolation of something that was considered quite important. And then I remember 
thinking, “This is so wonderful. I’m getting to work with him.” And one day I just sort 
of casually asked him, “So how long have you been doing this?” And he said twenty 
years. And for me, at my age, to think that twenty years and all that he has done is to—. 
EC: Isolate this one. 
JL: —isolate this one little thing that in terms of a cure or a treatment of cancer means 
very little, just you know, seemed as though you were trying to sort of eat the moon or 
something. 
EC: So those hands-on experiences were very educational? 
JL: They were very educational, very, very good, very productive for me. But that 
was the point at which then I was—. That was the summer of [19]64, where again now, I 
felt that I really should be in the south, and here I was reading about Goodman, you 
know, Chaney, and Schwerner. 
EC: Yeah, reading about the civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi. 
JE: I was reading about Freedom Summer in the pages of the New York Times, and — 
EC: Were you in college by this time? 
JE: I was. I was at Tuskegee. I was at Tuskegee. 
EC: So would this have been the summer after your freshman year, probably? 
Jennifer Lawson 
35 
JL: Right, and at Tuskegee, the first year right after I arrived there I started meeting 
students. You end up with the usual group where they’re trying to get you to become part 
of a sorority and I realized I had absolutely no interest in that whatsoever. And there was 
a group of students who were talking about some demonstrations about desegregating the 
little downtown area of Tuskegee, and so that appealed to me much, much more. That 
was something that I was far more interested in. So I then attended some of the student 
meetings around that. And then I also met this woman, Mrs. Lomax, Michael Lomax. 
They later were the head of Fulton County, and now I think he’s with [1:10:00] the 
United Negro College Fund. 
EC: Okay. 
JL: His mother, at that time, had a little newspaper in Tuskegee, and she and this 
other man, Dr. Gomillion. And Gomillion was interested in voter rights, and for some 
reason, I don’t know why I went to meet with him. I was really curious about what he 
was doing, but I became very interested. His focus was gerrymandering, and about how 
they had taken Macon County and done all of this work. The Whites had just broken the 
county up in ways so that you would never be able, Blacks would never be able to have a 
majority and get a vote. And for some reason that intrigued me and was of real interest to 
me. And it didn’t have anything to do with my school work, but I went over and met 
with him, and through a combination of those meetings and meeting other people I 
became much more interested in working on some of the civil rights issues there at 
Tuskegee. 
Jennifer Lawson 
36 
EC: I know that he was involved in a Supreme Court case related to voting in Macon 
County. Do you remember whether that had been heard before or after you met him? 
Was it--? 
JL: I don’t know. 
EC: Yeah. 
JL: Yeah, I don’t know. 
EC: I think it goes back to the fifties, but Em not sure when it actually hit the courts. 
JL: The work that he was doing was something that he had been doing for quite some 
time. Financially at that point—. At one point, I don’t remember whether it was that, 
because I was able to go to college only because I had a full scholarship, my father had 
sort of said, you know, “You want to go to college? That’s great.” 
EC: Go ahead. 
JL: Right, go right ahead. 
EC : Did your older brother go? 
JL: My older brother did. My older brother went to Tennessee State for a while, for a 
year, and then he transferred to Tuskegee. 
EC: So he followed you? 
JL: He did indeed. So we were both at Tuskegee, and I think he actually ended up at 
Tuskegee before I did though. Yeah, he didn’t follow me. I think he was at Tuskegee 
before me. I then, when I was at Tuskegee, I then really was not getting—. Maybe I’d 
get, you know, ten dollars every quarter, you know, from my dad or something. 
EC: Very generous allotment. 
Jennifer Lawson 
37 
JL: Not much at all, so that I needed to work, and at one point the job that I had—. I 
had gotten myself a job working in the hospital based on my experience with Sloan 
Kettering. I had gotten a job working at the hospital there at Tuskegee, and I quite that 
when they wanted me to draw blood. And I felt that I was inexperienced, and I was 
comfortable with working in the laboratory, and they kept just sort of saying, “Oh, you 
just go and do it.” And I just thought, “No, you don’t practice on people.” And they kept 
really pushing me, and so the one point where I sort of, “Okay, I’m going to go and do 
this.” And it was a young woman who was in labor, and then I felt no way in the world I 
am going to go and play and practice with this poor woman who is in so much pain, and 
so I just said, “I quit.” 
EC: I assume that was a Black hospital? 
JL: Yes, yes. Working in New York, did you consider trying to go to college in New 
York? 
JL: I didn’t. I didn’t at that time because I had this scholarship, and I had gotten the 
scholarship by participating in a science fair. It was a state-wide science fair. I won this, 
it was Gorgas sort of scholarship or something, the Gorgas something scholarship, and it 
was full tuition and room and board for four years to a Black College in Alabama. So it 
was a segregated prize. 
EC: Is that to buy off people who might desegregate the schools? 
JL: But it was a prize nonetheless. It was a Black prize. I think that there was a 
White equivalent [1:15:00] that went to then the University of Alabama or Auburn or 
something, but then this was to the Black schools. 
EC : I was going to say what was your proj ect? 
Jennifer Lawson 
38 
JL: My project was one where I did a demonstration of sounds waves, of showing 
how the frequency of sound waves could be graphically represented by, I created this 
thing that would kind of like bobble in water, vibrate in water. It had like a pool of water 
as a part of it, and I made this little thing that would sort of touch down on it like a 
needlepoint, but with something like a little cork or something, and that then if the 
frequency was higher it had a different wavelength from the base waves. And I did all of 
the appropriate paper work to—. 
EC: To support this? 
JL: —to support this. 
EC: Sounds like an interesting project. So you—? 
JL: So, you know, you had the little rheostat thing to where you could rev it up. I 
mean, this was pre-Radio Shack they had this. It was called Tandy I think, and there was 
the Tandy corporation, and they sold all of these kind of hobby things that went the 
gamut from the kind of stuff you could find now in a Radio Shack to these little hobby 
kinds of kits where you could get a piece of little leather and stamp it with designs and 
burnish it. Yeah, so that was my kind of place. Em still gadget-oriented, and so it was 
my kind of place. So I could go there and pick up enough things to sort of assemble this, 
and put this project together. 
EC: I wondered if it was sort of influenced by or shared interest like your dad’s ability 
to take things apart and put them together to construct something like that. 
JL: Right, exactly, well, we had been very much encouraged along that mode. 
EC: To develop that interest. 
Jennifer Lawson 
39 
JL: To develop those kinds of interests, or to feel that if you had an interest like that 
that you should just do it. And the same was true of, it ranged from architecture, so that 
at one point he was going to expand the house, and he asked that we would submit 
designs for the expansion. So we all did. We proposed that we should have this play 
room, and that we should have—. My room would be on one side. Their room would be 
on the other side, the boys, and that we would be separated by this larger play room that 
would have an elevated platform for our electric trains. 
EC: How did that go? 
JL: It went quite well. The one thing that he did that he shouldn’t have done, he 
shouldn’t have followed our advice about the skylights. We thought that it would be 
great to have skylights in this play room, and the heat that came through those things in 
summer. Un-insulated glass, I mean, it’s a wonder it didn’t set the place on fire. It was—. 
EC: In Alabama. So did the three of you develop it together? 
JL: First we were working separately, and we had, each, our separate designs, and 
then after he sort of picked aspects from each design and everything then we became 
more of a team and worked together. 
EC: That must have been pretty exciting to have that kind of impact. 
JL: It was. 
EC: I mean, that’s real efficacy. 
JL: And I had the vision that the room for the trains would have the scenery all 
around the walls, and it would have the sky lights, so it was like my little Sistine Chapel 
bit to paint all of the stars and clouds and things, and then the—. 
EC: Did you do that? Wow. 
Jennifer Lawson 
40 
JL: —and then the trees along the walls and everything, so it was quite an undertaking, 
but. 
EC: Sounds like it. I don’t know many parents who have their kids—. Give their kids 
the space for that. 
JL: Yeah, or say, “Fine, go draw on the walls,” you know, yeah. 
EC: No, that’s not allowed. 
JL: Then I’d move from that to wanting canvas, and so he would buy me canvas and 
paints, so I started doing oil paintings, and I would draw. There was one time that he—. 
A friend of mine had a Monopoly game, and oh, I just thought it was so much fun, and I 
wanted a Monopoly set. And he refused to buy me one. He said absolutely not, and so 
one weekend I borrowed my friends Monopoly set, and I copied it. I got cardboard, and I 
copied her—, I wish that I had it now because it would be, you know, folk art now. 
[1:20:00] But I copied her Monopoly set down to making my box, making the box to put 
the board in, and the only thing that I didn’t make as original things were the little pieces. 
I made the little houses, but then there were the little tokens you could have as a— 
EC: The one that was you. 
JL: —that represented you, right, exactly. 
EC: Little car, and —. 
JL: And I found—. I’ve forgotten where I got those, but I got some little toys or 
something to serve for those. 
EC: Did you like playing Monopoly as well on your board? 
JL: I did, very much so, with my own money that I had made. But I took the time to 
do the whole thing. 
Jennifer Lawson 
41 
EC: Sounds like you had a lot of creativity and independence in your childhood. 
JL: And that became a real asset. Those were things that became, you know, real 
strengths for me later. So going back to Tuskegee and now my having to sort of make a 
living for myself, at one point I had worked in the hospital, and then another point I 
worked for this photo studio. There I was doing these colored tints. There was a point 
where instead of colored photographs they were black-and-white photos, and you then 
applied, you know, like little rosiness to the cheeks, lipstick, but you touched the—. 
EC: Wow, on black-and-white photos? 
JL: On black-and-white photos. 
EC : It’s almost like you PhotoShopping. 
JL: Yeah, it was. It really was, and so I then was doing that for this photographer. 
Years later, long after I had left Tuskegee, I discovered that that was like a famous 
photography studio. This was one of these, you know, like there’s James Van Der Zee? 
EC: Yeah. 
JL: Well, this guy I think is Polk, was another one of these, you know great 
photographers and someone who documented the African American community in these 
striking ways. So that was yet another place that I had worked, but through this work 
sometimes I ended up meeting people who were beyond just the classroom. So I didn’t 
have an experience of Tuskegee with just, I’m getting up, and I’m going to class, and I’ll 
be back in my dorm room. 
EC: You’re connected to the community. 
JE: But I ended up then meeting people that took me beyond that, and I was put into 
an honors program where I didn’t have to go to conventional classes. I had one, like I 
Jennifer Lawson 
42 
took calculus with just meeting with the professor, and I was allowed to pick classes that 
were not limited to the undergraduate program. So I took classes in the school of 
veterinary medicine because, like I said, I really enjoyed biology and everything, and so I 
took a course in animal parasitology I remember. 
EC: Is that parasites? 
JL: Yeah, it was disgusting. 
EC: I bet it was. 
JL: You know, “How many worms can inhabit the stomach of a—?” You know, so I 
took some of those courses, and I took another one on poisonous plants, but through the 
school of veterinary medicine I was taking these sort of more advanced classes, and that 
then led me to mingle with a group of people who were in some cases actual professors 
as opposed to students. So through them I met people. There was a woman, Doris 
Mitchel, who was a resident of Tuskegee and who came from, I think her father may have 
been a doctor. She herself was a veterinarian, and she and Odetta were friends. 
EC: Oh, okay. 
JL: She had a Daimler. I had never. She had a little sports car that she had had 
imported from Germany. She had a Daimler that she’d sort of tootle around in. 
EC: In Macon County? 
JL: In Macon County, and this house that was just incredible. So I was being exposed 
to this, people who—. And it was both intellectual exposure and cultural, but also then it 
meant that you were talking much more seriously about ideas, and then of course ideas at 
that time meant that you were talking about race and racism as well and the problems 
[1:25:00] of segregation and the lack of opportunity for people of color. 
Jennifer Lawson 
43 
EC: So what are some of the civil rights things that you’re doing while you’re at 
Tuskegee while you’re also working and expanding your network? 
JE: So I started working on going out into the rural Macon County with registering 
people to vote, and I don’t remember whether that was at the behest of, you know, 
Gomillion group or some—. I don’t know quite how that started, but that was one of the 
things that I started doing, and then I met Gwen Patton and George Ware. George was a 
graduate student in chemistry, I believe, at Tuskegee at the time. And so I met these 
other students who had similar interests, and I began to work with them. 
EC: Was the student group at Tuskegee focused entirely on civil rights in the 
community, or were they dealing with campus issues? 
JL: Both, both. 
EC: Both, yeah, what was the group like? What do you remember about the group? 
JL: At first I think we were a very cohesive, productive group, and then we later 
became divided, and the division came not out of really an intellectual or strategic divide. 
It became much more the question. Winky, Bill Hall, came to Tuskegee as a 
representative of SNCC. It became much more a question of, “Wait, this is our group. 
Don’t you tell us what to do.” That became the kind of dividing line because we were 
now beginning to have demonstrations and participate. I can’t recall what some of the 
key issues were then, but I know we were doing some—. 
EC: On campus? 
JL: The issues were not on campus. We were doing work. The work was much more 
desegregating Macon County in the sort of downtown Tuskegee and issues then about 
voting rights there. And that had sort of brought us to the attention of SNCC, and so 
Jennifer Lawson 
44 
people like Willie Ricks and Bill Hall, Cleve Sellers, people started coming through. 
SNCC people started coming through, and that then lead to this kind of tension with our 
group of feeling that, “Well, SNCC can do whatever it wants over there, but that we will 
be doing these things here. This is our group, and this is what we will be doing.” There 
was a point at which I felt that that was counter-productive, and that what we were 
talking about was a bit too parochial too. I started leaning towards SNCC because I felt 
that they were engaging the larger issues. The dialogue was much more about what was 
happening in the country as a whole. 
EC: It was a broader picture. 
JL: And it was a strategy. They were much more strategic in thinking that, “Well, 
this is a Black Belt county. If we can do this with these Black Belt counties, plural, that 
then we might be able to create some change rather than ‘Let’s march through downtown 
Tuskegee.’” 
EC: Do you think your broader exposure made you receptive to SNCC’s analysis or to 
choosing the broader analysis over the more focused? 
JL: I’m not sure because with some of this was the exposure beforehand since I think 
I was predisposed towards civil rights activity from having grown up in Birmingham, 
having participated [1:30:00] in the demonstrations when I was in high school, 
Birmingham then being the place where the church had been bombed. 
EC: Yeah, I guess you would have been a freshman in college? 
JL: Yeah, I was in college then. My brother though knew the family from one of the 
girls, so it was this—. So I think I felt this connection to those things. And I also used to 
read a lot, and some of the readings also, and I had grown up in this circumstance that 
Jennifer Lawson 
45 
was very much a union town too, you know, with people who were coal miners and steel 
workers, and talked about John L. Lewis, you know, and the importance of unions. So I 
think I had that kind of sense of that, if we are organized, that organization and being 
organized, you can have a voice, that you won’t be alone, and that your voice can make a 
difference. So that was something that I think had been there as a small seed that was 
now beginning to grow, and by the time I was in Tuskegee again in [19]64, then right 
after I had come back from New York they were asking for volunteers. They wanted 
more student volunteers to go to Mississippi to work on the November elections. 
EC: Oh, okay. 
JL: And this was the November [19]64 elections. They were trying to get people to 
come to Jackson, Mississippi and to other parts to help register people. 
EC: And you had just missed Freedom Summer? 
JL: And I had just missed Freedom Summer, and so I said yes. And for me that was 
one of the times in my life that I felt that I was making a conscious decision about doing 
something, and I was doing it alone, and that was fine with me. It wasn’t like, “Oh, 
you’re my best friend. Well, you go with me. We could go.” It was that, no, this is 
something that I feel is important to do, and that I will go. 
EC: And you didn’t need other people’s approval or support or company. 
JE: I didn’t need other people’s approval, validation. I didn’t need parental 
validation, approval. I could say, yes, I will go, and I went. 
EC: What was that experience like? 
JE: I went and I stayed—. I want to think that I stayed at the place where Eve Esther 
Simpson. I think that she went there, and that they had us come to a meeting, and after 
Jennifer Lawson 
46 
we got off the bus they said here’s well you’ll stay, and I said fine, and then they ask, and 
said we are going to meet, and so we’ll be gathering here, and then they told us what they 
wanted us to do was to go do this door-to-door canvassing in this particular part of 
Jackson, and that’s what I did. I was really comfortable with that. The part that was 
uncomfortable for me, oddly enough, was the social side of it because I was a shy 
introvert. And so I’m fine when I’m working, but then when people are socializing I 
wasn’t accustomed to the sort of—. I remember saying to someone, “Your husband says 
that,” and she just laughed. This girl just laughed because, you know, I had made the 
automatic assumption since they were kissing on each other and everything. 
EC : That that was her husband? 
JL: She just thought that was so funny, you know, that I would assume that. And I 
realized that—. 
EC: Just cause they were kissing. 
JL: Yeah, and that it’s something where this was a time when people were a lot more 
liberal with—. And so that’s where I was not there with them on the social side of these 
things. 
EC: Even though you had been doing these New York parties? 
JL: Right, but these New York parties, they were much more Mad men-style. I mean, 
they were tame by comparison to—. 
EC: Yeah, so going to Mississippi for voter’s registration was a whole different 
exposure. 
Jennifer Lawson 
47 
JL: Yes, so it was an eye-opening experience in that way. I was very comfortable 
with the work side of it, but it was like, [1:35:00] “Oh, I don’t know. These people 
where, you know—.” 
JL: Okay, so you know, where one of the guys like flirting with me or something, that 
was a little off-putting and a little scary to me because I was, you know, so green and 
everything. 
EC: Eighteen, nineteen years old and not ready for that. And so then that was—. Soif 
that’s the November [19]64 election it’s after Freedom Summer, but it’s before the 
Voting Rights Act. So are you still having trouble getting people to be successful at 
registering to vote? Do you have a sense of whether they’re accomplishing this? 
JL: I didn’t because I just felt that I was like a little soldier in the—. 
EC : In the bigger unit? 
JL: In the bigger unit, and so I didn’t feel that I was privy to nor understood the larger 
strategy and how successful people were at that. I just felt that then this was something I 
could do. I could talk to people, and I felt very good about it. I was really proud of 
myself for having gone because people were talking about, “Oh my God, Mississippi? 
Oh, it’s too dangerous, and I would never go to Mississippi.” It’s like, Mississippi, 
Alabama, it’s right—. 
EC: I was going to say, people in Mississippi say that about Alabama. 
JL: Yeah, exactly, exactly. You know, here I am in Tuskegee. I’m in the middle of 
Alabama, and I’m going to think that it’s more dangerous to go across the border to, you 
know, the state line to Mississippi? And of course this was after, you know Freedom 
Summer, and after Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney, so it was—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
48 
EC: Does that exacerbate the concern or the fear? 
JL: It very definitely—. I didn’t feel that made it a given that something would 
happen to me or that my life was in mortal danger or anything. But I could understand 
how people from the north or somewhere, a student from Chicago or something might be 
quite reluctant to do so. 
EC: Were you still in school for the Selma to Montgomery march? 
JL: I was. 
EC: I mean, I guess I just made a big leap from—. Well, I guess it’s November [19]64. 
That organizing started in early [19]65, so that would’ve been the same school year then. 
JL: I was in school, and I left—. I’ll have to look and see when I left school. I worked 
with SNCC. I started working very definitely with SNCC. I moved away from the 
campus group. 
EC: You moved away from the campus group. 
JL: I still worked with them occasionally, but I moved much further away from the 
campus group and started working with SNCC, and at first in Wilcox County, and this 
was down around Gee’s Bend. Then I worked. And so there was a point at which I left 
school, and I want to think that I left school in probably in the spring of 1966. I was still 
in school when my classmate Sammy Young was killed, and Sammy was a part of the 
student group there, and so we as a student group were participating in the Selma to 
Montgomery activities from Tuskegee. I know that we were coming from Tuskegee. 
I was not yet working and living in Lowndes County. Later I actually worked and lived 
in the Freedom House in Lowndes, but that was later, but at this point I was still in 
Tuskegee, and Gwen Patton, George Ware, Sammy Young, George Paris, Wendy Paris, 
Jennifer Lawson 
49 
that group of us were working, CJ Jones. There was a whole group of us who were 
Tuskegee students, and we would go work with SNCC in Lowndes County and go over 
to Selma, and that’s when I met Phyllis Cunningham who was there with the medical 
group. 
EC: So when you initially are working with SNCC you’re still in classes, and you’re 
going back and forth from Tuskegee to Selma to Wilcox to Lowndes? 
JL: Right, and at a certain point that—. 
EC: And you’re part of a group? 
JL: Yeah, and at a certain point that became unrealistic and untenable, and I decided 
that I would leave school. [1:40:00] I felt that I had to make a decision. 
EC: Was that a hard choice to make? 
JL: It was. It was a very difficult decision for me because I felt that, you know, I had 
worked out one way of having my college education paid for, and—. 
EC: With the scholarship. 
JL: Right, and now if I said goodbye to that and worked full time in SNCC that I had 
no means of support. 
EC: What would you do to return to college? 
JL: What would I do to return to college? What would I do even for just to—? 
EC: Pay the rent? 
JL: Yeah, to live, you know, that when students were going to go home for a summer 
or something at the end of the school year, where would I be going? 
EC: Yeah, so you didn’t think you could or would want to go home to your father’s? 
JE: I didn’t want to. I could, but I wouldn’t want to. 
Jennifer Lawson 
50 
EC: You were sort of passed that of living at home? 
JL: Yes, and because my father, he was an eccentric tinkerer, and as the years were 
going by he was becoming even more so. And sadly, you know, I think he was beginning 
to show some signs of dementia. For me, I didn’t want to return to Fairfield to live. That 
was to me something that I just knew that I would never want to live there in my life, you 
know. 
[Camera turns off and on again] 
EC: Can you articulate why it was that you felt you had to make the choice, or that 
you wanted to make the choice to work full time in the movement despite what it could 
mean in terms of your future? 
JL: I felt that I was becoming... my time was too divided between the two. I was tom 
between these activities that on one hand I had a professor who was then sort of saying, 
“Don’t forget we’re to meet at a certain point,” and as I said, they had been quite liberal 
with me in terms of the approach that was being taken about my classes and everything. 
So it wasn’t as though I had to show up to twenty classes or anything, but still I did need 
to write papers and to do certain things in order to succeed academically. At the same 
time though, then there was the, “We need to have a meeting. This is taking place. We 
need to go and talk to canvas this area to get the people to come to this meeting.” 
So where do you stand? What do you do? And I thought long and hard about it, and it 
was a hard decision. I remember become quite depressed at one point about, you know, 
“What do I do?” And I didn’t have anybody that I really could talk to about this. My 
brother, who was at Tuskegee, he and I are very close, but he was sort of a good guy, 
more sort of social party animal. He had a sports car, and he was supportive of the 
Jennifer Lawson 
51 
movement, but he had definitely created a good work-life balance for himself which 
involved parties and girls and things. 
EC: And sports cars? 
JL: And sports cars, so I just felt that I had to just think this through and just make 
this decision, and that’s when I decided that I would work. I would leave school and 
work with SNCC, and I convinced myself that I could return. 
EC : That you would find a way? 
JL: That I would be able to at some point, that if later I wanted to go and study 
medicine I would be able to do so, but that for now—. 
EC: Did you know that SNCC had, or at least, was trying to have the work-study 
program? In Mississippi the SNCC folks would work for a while and then go back to 
school for a while, and SNCC would support that effort. 
JL: No, I didn’t. 
EC: I think it was one of Ella Baker’s, not surprisingly, right? 
JL: Right, exactly. 
JL: So we were the student group, which was Gwen, Patton, George Ware, and a 
number of us were working both on the campus. Our student group met on campus, but 
the real focus of our work was the Macon County area, [1:45:00] downtown Tuskegee, 
such as that is, and then we also though started working with SNCC and the other civil 
rights group on the Selma to Montgomery march. That was when we students became 
really part of a group that was going to not start so much in Selma but go and 
demonstrate in Montgomery. 
Jennifer Lawson 
52 
EC: Do you know what the thinking was behind going to Montgomery rather than 
Selma? 
JL: I don’t recall. 
EC: I guess Em jumping ahead a little bit here, but the work that you were doing with 
Tuskegee students in the county or in the community, when you start working more with 
SNCC, not so much in Montgomery but in the rural counties, is that more or less the 
same kind of work, or is there a distinction, a difference in that work? 
JL: For me the distinction was that it was strategically more around the vote and 
around registering African Americans to vote and trying to gain pluralities of voters in 
those Black Belt counties. And so Macon, Wilcox, Lowndes, those counties in Alabama 
had significant Black populations, and we were then trying to get as many registered 
voters in each of them. 
EC: At that point were you thinking about the role of independent politics, or were 
you thinking more directly just in terms of the vote and not necessarily what happens 
next? 
JL: We were thinking that if we could register people, and that if you could get a 
plurality in that particular county that you could in effect have Black people in charge of 
the county government, and that you could change the dynamic of life in the county by 
having then the sort of authority of county government. 
EC: Were you aware of--. I mean, I know that you said you followed Freedom 
Summer. Did you have an understanding of how SNCC thought the challenge had gone 
in Atlantic City? I mean, I know the people who went through that, many of them were 
disappointed by that. 
Jennifer Lawson 
53 
JL: Very much so, yes. 
EC: And also learning from it, and so was that something that was communicated to 
you or that you were aware of? 
JL: I was aware of it in a general way. I mean, it wasn’t as though—. People didn’t 
mull over it, talk about it, you know, ad infinitum. But there was the notion that that was 
an approach that had worked only up to a certain point. That had failed in one sense, but 
now what we could do is begin to deal with these Black Belt counties and particularly 
Lowndes, and that if we could then gain and really transform the government of one of 
these counties that that would be a path to a different kind of victory and a different kind 
of politics. 
EC: I don’t know if you would remember, or if you would have been aware of this, it’s 
been a long time, so I don’t remember the specifics, but I had a sense that although Dr. 
Gomillion was a path-breaker in many ways pursuing the franchise and challenging the 
gerrymandering, that once the Voting Rights Act passed, or once he won some of those 
court cases that some people thought he was a little conservative in applying that, that he 
wanted to be careful not to, you know, threaten Whites too much with this Black 
majority. Do you remember that at all? 
JL: No, I don’t remember that, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
EC: That’s interesting. And so I think that there would have been a difference 
between the Macon dynamic with that and the Lowndes dynamic, so I wondered if you 
were tapped into that. 
JL: Yeah, and it’s interesting because it’s something where now, in hindsight, you 
know, so many years later, I’m curious about what we were attempting to do as a whole 
Jennifer Lawson 
54 
in Wilcox County, for example, and why we felt that, “Oh, let’s not put too much effort 
there.” 
EC: Why Lowndes got the bulk of the attention? 
JL: I feel that I understand why Lowndes [1:50:00] got the bulk of the attention, but 
we had enough people and enough interest to have maintained activity in Wilcox as well, 
but I feel that there was somehow strategically that we didn’t quite—. That it was felt that 
it wasn’t necessary, or that it wasn’t possible to have the same kind of win. And Wilcox 
was an interesting place in and of itself. It had a completely different dynamic there 
because of the kind of isolation of Gee’s Bend. 
EC: Okay, was it—. I mean, my sense is it had the same kind of Black supermajority, 
right? 
JL: It had the Black supermajority, but the Whites had sort of cut the bridge so that 
Gee’s Bend was this little world unto itself. 
EC: And it was so difficult for them to connect to the rest of the county? JL: 
Right, exactly. 
EC: Are there any sizeable towns in Wilcox or Green? 
JL: There are, but I can’t even remember the names of them, yeah. And particularly 
in Wilcox we didn’t go to the principal town because that was the one that was sort of cut 
off in a sense, yeah. 
EC: So is Gee’s Bend a town? I always think of it more as just rural? 
JL: It’s more rural, but it is. It’s an enclave. I mean, now something having that 
same dynamic we’d call a subdivision, but in those days it was—. And you probably 
know all of the history of it, and how—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
55 
EC: A little. 
JL: —coming out of the New Deal, it was one of those kind of—. 
EC: Farm security, when people bought land? 
JL: Well, where they had also a community center, and then people had these houses 
all sort of—. It was a planned community in that way. 
EC: Was it funded through the Farm Security Administration? 
JE: I don’t know. 
EC: Where Black farmers are buying land? 
JL: Yeah, I don’t know. 
EC: Okay. 
JL: All of the people were named Pettway. 
EC: Black and White? 
JL: All the Blacks. They came from the Pettway plantation, and they were all named 
Pettway. So everybody was a Pettway. But so it was an unusual place culturally, and a 
kind of isolated place. But going back to Gomillion, I remember him as being one of the 
players and a force there, but I don’t remember doing things actively in Macon. 
EC: There’s a Reaping the Whirlwind, I think. I don’t know if you’ve seen it. It’s a 
book about Tuskegee, or the community, not the school. So I want to continue with 
Lowndes, but before, I don’t want to forget Montgomery, so can you talk about what the 
Montgomery—. You said that Tuskegee students were going to Montgomery during the 
Selma to Montgomery march and doing demonstrations there. Can you describe your 
involvement in that and what it was like? 
Jennifer Lawson 
56 
JL: I recall there, and now Jim Forman, in addition to other SNCC people, Jim 
Forman was also a presents at Tuskegee, and Jim and some other SNCC workers then 
were asking that we would then go to Montgomery. I recall that we then had picket 
signs. I don’t remember what the signs said, but we then went to march in front of the 
state capitol in Montgomery, and this is what used to be the White House of the 
confederacy where Jeff Davis has a star or something. So we were going to demonstrate 
there, and students would go and march there, and then go back to campus, and we then 
went. And the day that we went there was a counter demonstration. I think there were 
maybe about, I want to think maybe about forty, forty, fifty of us. We were marching in 
this oval loop there in front of the state capitol. The capitol itself behind us, there were 
state troopers with their billy clubs, and they would slap them against their thighs for 
dramatic effect now and then. 
So they were standing there in a big line, so you knew that you couldn’t go further that 
way. And there was a point at which it was the Klan or a group, [1:55:00] that people 
said it was the Klan, but they were not robed, but they were these men and women, White 
men and women in these cars that came up street there, and they were coming up, and a 
few cars came up, and they of course yelled the usual “nigger” and a few other things. It 
was like a big parade though of them coming, and the troopers started saying that Klan 
was coming, and they were talking among each other. 
We, meanwhile, are still marching like this, and then there was one point at which one of 
the officers said, you know, “Arrest them all.” And we had been instructed. We had all 
gone through the training where if you’re being arrested you go limp, and you know, 
you’re sort of carried and thrown into the paddy wagon or the van or whatever. And so 
Jennifer Lawson 
57 
we were arrested, and that’s when we went through our usual going limp and were taken 
away. And we were arrested just before that group came fully up the hill. So there was 
on one hand a sense of relief about it because you didn’t quite know if you’re between. 
EC: The highway patrol and the Klan. 
JL: Right, and the highway patrol with their billy clubs, and then if you’re with this, 
you know, sort of vigilante kind of group there, it doesn’t seem like a safe place to be. 
EC: No, not exactly. 
JL: And we, I think, were thinking of it, I know I later talked with one of my 
classmates who was there, we were thinking that there was no place for us to go. If they 
had not arrested us then we would probably have sat down there and just—. 
EC: And dropped between the two. 
JL: Right. 
EC: So what happened when you were arrested? 
JL: So we were arrested, and we were taken to this place, to this jail, I think, which 
was a Montgomery County jail, and we were—. I think I was there for about like five 
days. 
EC: Yeah, what was it like to be in jail? 
JL: On one hand it was something where I wasn’t afraid. I was not afraid at all, and I 
wasn’t afraid because there were so many of us, you know, because we were together, 
and we were singing freedom songs, and so the camaraderie and everything at the 
beginning was very good. As time went on it became harder, and it became harder 
because of the conditions there. You know, the bathrooms were overflowing, so it was 
absolutely smelly, filthy, horrid. The food was, you know, just terrible, inedible 
Jennifer Lawson 
58 
practically. So, you know, somebody sort of said, “Let’s go on a hunger strike,” and you 
felt, “That’s easy enough to do,” because the food was so absolutely so awful. 
But I wasn’t at any point fearful. I wasn’t fearful for my life. More people were being 
arrested too, so the numbers were growing, and it was a more diverse group that was 
being arrested. There were some Whites from New York and other places who now were 
being brought in, so you were meeting these people, so it was like a giant gathering of 
people, of women. And there were some local women who were a little befuddled, 
people who had been arrested for other things. I never asked or found out what they had 
been arrested for, but they were a little—. They found us curiosities. 
EC: I bet they did. 
JL: Yeah, and we’d all sort of mingle and talk. 
EC: And how did you get out? Did somebody bail you out? 
JL: Someone bailed us out. 
EC: They decided they didn’t want to keep you any longer? 
JL: Someone bailed us out. 
EC: Did you have to go back and go to court? 
JL: We did not. We did not. I want to think that William Künstler had arranged for 
us to be released, and I want to think that they file some things where later all of the 
charges were dismissed. And I think we were arrested—. I think the charge was 
[2:00:00] that we were arrested for resisting arrest. 
EC: That’s always a curious one. 
JL: Exactly. 
EC: That you’re resisting arrest with no other charge. 
Jennifer Lawson 
59 
JL: Right, exactly, so I think that—. 
EC: It wasn’t probably too challenging to get it tossed out once, yeah. 
JL: But I think that Künstler—, Because I think Künstler played a role then in our 
being released. 
EC: I know that a lot of people say that he played an important role in coming up with 
some of the more creative strategies of forcing the issue and like that. 
JL: And on a subsequent arrest in Atlanta with Karen Spellman, Fay Bellamy, and 
Ruby Doris Robinson, during the holiday season in December in Atlanta when I was 
working in the Atlanta office we were arrested, and then I think Howard Moore, Julian 
Bond’s brother-in-law, he was the person. 
EC: I knew that he did a lot of movement work. So you, Ruby Doris, Karen Spellman, 
and Fey Bellamy, what were you all arrested for? 
JL: We had been working at the SNCC office all day, and it was in the midst of the 
Christmas holidays. And we’d been working, and we closed the office. The office was 
now closed, and we thought, “Oh, let’s do something that would just be relaxing and 
fun.” 
EC: You said, “Oh, let’s get arrested.” 
JL: And we thought, “No, let’s go to Auburn Avenue. Let’s go down to the main 
Black Street,” at that time in Atlanta, Auburn Avenue, “and hear some music, and have 
some dinner and hear some music.” We were walking there. We had afros, so we were 
rather distinctive. 
EC: Identifiable as movement people? 
Jennifer Lawson 
60 
JL: Identifiable, and so we were walking along, and Fey was very tall and gazelle-like 
and very striking, and so the group of us are all walking. It’s just us women walking 
down. These Black policemen then slowed down to a crawl, and then they are driving 
alongside us at the same—. I mean, we’re walking, and they now are driving along at the 
same pace that we’re walking. And Fey then finally says, “And what are you looking at, 
and what do you want?” She used an expletive along with that, and they pulled over and 
arrested us. So here we were, and you know, of course, we’re saying, “What? How can 
we be—. What have we done?” And—. 
EC: How did you feel about that? 
JL: Well, that became yet again another interesting evening, but it was—. What was 
it? Later we found that I think two of the policemen were like Vietnam vets. 
EC: Oh, really? 
JL: Yeah, but it was this whole thing of, “What? What is this about then? Why?” 
And it was this kind of, you felt that you were being harassed because we were obviously 
movement people, you know, and our hair was the giveaway, and the police would then 
just feel somehow they were going to show us who was the authority here. 
EC: What about the fact that they’re Black officers? 
JL: Oh, that’s why I feel it was more about—, I feel it was about them sort of feeling 
that, “Oh no, we’ll show you who’s the authority here.” 
EC : It’s a way that they can exercise their authority? 
JL: Right, exactly. 
EC: They’re probably not doing that in the White community. 
Right. 
JL: 
Jennifer Lawson 
61 
EC: I do think—. I mean, you probably experienced this, but it seems like Black police 
were explicitly intended to control the Black community when they were first brought in. 
JL: Well, I think that there was a kind of—. And in different places I think Black 
police have played different roles, varying roles, but I think in this particular 
circumstance that this was a time when I believe that they felt that civil rights [2:05:00] 
and that the movement and you know, this is like Black power and all of those kind of 
frightening things for them, that challenged their authority and lead to sort of—. Could 
lead to riots and all kinds of problems. And I think that they just felt that, “Oh, this is an 
easy chance to just show these people in the civil rights movement.” 
EC: So your very presence is a threat? 
JL: Yeah. 
EC: So is this—. You said it’s Christmas, it’s the era of black power. Is this probably 
like December 1966, December 1967? 
JE: I think it was probably like 1967. Ell have to try to find—. Karen, Karen. You 
know, I can get some validation for some of these things—. 
EC: From her? 
JL: —from her. Sadly, the numbers of people who are still alive and can do that have 
dwindled. Yeah. 
EC: So, can you tell me, tell us what it was like to be organizing in Lowndes County. 
Were you living in Lowndes County at that point? 
JE: I was living in Lowndes County, and I—. I had, at first, I had been living in 
Wilcox County and would come over for meetings with Stokely Carmichael, Ralph 
Featherstone, Courtland Cox, Charlie Cobb, Ivanhoe. We would, you know, meet there 
Jennifer Lawson 
62 
from time to time. And they would be, some of them would be coming from Atlanta, and 
we would all then have these meetings. But then, when I was asked to actually come and 
work in Lowndes County, then I moved into the freedom house. So the building—. 
There are photographs of the shack which I had been—. I think belonged to the Jackson 
family, so they’re, that shack of a house was our office by day, but it was also then where 
we actually stayed. And we had sleeping bags, and so we’d sleep in our sleeping bags 
and the building was—. You could see the stars by looking up, and you could see the 
ground by looking down. [Laughter] 
EC : It’s just like camping. 
JL: Yeah. And that—. We had a, it had one of those little potbelly stoves, the wood 
stoves that you’d, you know, you’d use that to keep warm. And so those conversations 
around the fire meant that you turned one way and, after that part of your body started 
getting toasty, you then turned another way. So these conversations had this sort of 
natural rhythm of movement to them. [Laughter] 
EC: That’s crazy. 
JL: But it was really interesting that I, that was a very special time for me. I was very 
pleased that the, that I was considered one of the key workers there, and that it was not 
that I was being treated like, “Oh, you’re a girl, you’re a woman,” but it was that, at the—. 
In the evening, when we’d get together and we’d be sitting around that, you know, the 
little stove, or we’d be talking, that we were talking about what had happened during the 
day in terms of our work in the county, but it was a wonderful time where we were also 
talking broader strategies, and about the world, and we were—. Some of us were reading 
Frantz Fanon and you know, reading his books and, Black Skin, White Masks, and we 
Jennifer Lawson 
63 
would talk about what did, what does freedom mean. You know, what does revolution 
mean. What does change mean. What does it mean to have power, what’s happening in 
the world, and what is it that we would want for our people. Ralph Featherstone, for 
example, felt that economic empowerment was absolutely essential, and he thought that 
we should eventually work on projects that would bring greater economic empowerment 
to people, and that’s something that he, before his death, had worked on some projects 
that were around the economics. 
EC: He was a teacher, too, right? Before he was in SNCC? 
JL: Yes, yes. 
EC: What were some of the economic ideas that he had, or projects he worked on? 
JL: Well they were—. In some parts of Mississippi, they started doing catfish 
farming, where—. 
EC: Oh. They—. Okay. 
JL: Mm-hmm. Where you could, where people could then raise catfish and sell those 
commercially. [2:10:00] 
EC: Mm-hmm. I mean, I heard of that in the delta but I didn’t realize that SNCC was 
involved with that. 
JL: Well, SNCC, per se, wasn’t but—. 
EC: He was working independently? 
JL: Right. He later, as time moved on, he began—. Yeah. And that he, then, for 
example, Ed Brown, Rap Brown’s brother, was another person who was interested in the 
economic empowerment ideas, and so he eventually became the head of that group, 
Jennifer Lawson 
64 
Mississippi Action for Community Education, MACE, in Mississippi. And so Ed and 
Charles Bannerman, and a few others then worked on setting up. 
EC: Okay. Those catfish farms, and some of the other thing—. 
JL: Those kinds of activities, they had one—. Fine Vines, I think it was called, for it 
was a blue jeans—. Where people were doing, they were doing textile work and then also 
doing piecework for sewing jeans, like garment work. So that, they were doing those 
kinds of things, and I worked with them, I worked for MACE but in Quitman County, as 
the deputy director of an adult education program. And I did that maybe around—. Was 
perhaps about 1969, maybe. 
EC: So Quitman, that’s’ where Marks, Mississippi is? 
JL: Yes, exactly. 
EC: And so this was after the—. 
JL: You know about—. Yeah? 
EC: This is after the Poor People’s Campaign and the Mule Train from Marks to DC, 
and then you’re there doing adult education? 
JE: So I was there doing adult education, and I was running, using the churches. And 
this was, again, something where I was very comfortable, again, being on my own in the 
middle of nowhere, Mississippi, and I even lived a few miles out from Marks, in 
Lambert, Mississippi, and that—. 
EC: Wow. Out from. 
JL: Yeah. And that I would set up, I made arrangements with several of the churches, 
that we could then use the churches at night as adult education centers, and we trained 
teachers. I brought a woman, Daphne Mews, was a former DC schoolteacher, to 
Jennifer Lawson 
65 
Quitman County to do, like, a two-week teacher training program, and then the teachers 
would work at nights with people, after they had gotten off work, to learn. It was basic 
literacy, and it was quite moving because these were adults in all sorts of age ranges who 
were just so thrilled to learn to read and write. 
EC: People who had probably been denied that opportunity? 
JL: Opportunity for their entire lives. Yeah. So, going back to—. 
EC: Let me ask one follow-up, and then go back. 
JL: Mm-hmm? Sure, okay, sure. 
EC: When you, was your approach to adult education, was that influenced at all by the 
Citizenship Schools that Highlander and SCLC had been operating? Were you aware of 
the Citizenship Schools? 
JE: I was not aware of the Citizenship Schools, I was aware of Highlander, I had 
never been to Highlander. 
EC: Really? 
JL: Yeah, yeah. 
EC: Well, some day. 
JL: And I was aware of Highlander and knew of the principles of—. You know, the 
principal people there, knew of its founding and everything, but that, I did not know of 
their Citizenship Schools. And this was more just when I had talked with Ed Brown, 
with Rap’s brother Ed, and we then had talked about—, I came to that after becoming, 
feeling that it was time to leave SNCC. And so I, after I left SNCC I worked with the 
National Council of Negro Women, with Dorothy Height, and worked on these economic 
empowerment projects for women under the auspices of the National Council of Negro 
Jennifer Lawson 
66 
Women. And Unita Blackwell, and also Fannie Lou Hamer, and I spent more of the 
time, most of the time, working with Fannie Lou Hamer out of Ruleville, who I—. 
[Recorder is turned off and then back on] 
EC: So, should we pursue this line and then go back to Lowndes? 
JL: Your choice. 
EC: So, Fll pursue this for a minute and then we’ll work our way back to Lowndes, 
but can you tell us what it was like to work with Miss Hamer, and what she and Miss 
Blackwell, Unita Blackwell, were like? 
JL: Well, working with Fannie Lou Hamer was, she was such a spirited and, and—. 
She’s the kind of person where, when they—. There are some people who are charismatic 
and have personal power under all circumstances, and so she [2:15:00] was the kind of 
woman if, when she walked in the room, you took notice. And you took notice, and that 
she had this great sense of humor as well, but that she also had this, you know, real 
seriousness about her, and this determination. And so she was really, at this point, she 
was really eager to try to change Ruleville, and to try to achieve something for the people 
in the area, so she was almost more like a local politician in many ways, trying to create 
change and bring in projects for the people there. So the National Council of Negro 
Women, and Dorothy Height—. This was a point at which one of the major magazines, 
TIME or something, had done a big story and there had been some study that had talked 
about hunger in America. And Mississippi had been the focal point of that, and it talked 
about the amount of childhood malnutrition in Mississippi, and so the National Council 
of Negro Women proposed that they would do something about this. And so, working 
with Mrs. Hamer, they had pulled together—. They were going to develop several 
Jennifer Lawson 
67 
projects, and among them was a pig bank. And that Mrs. Hamer’s responsibility was in 
identifying a group of women who would participate in the pig bank. The university of—. 
I think it was Purdue University, or some other universities had then—. 
EC: That’s possible. I think they might have been a land, or an Ag college. 
JL: Right. Had then, were supplying these particular kinds of pigs. [Recorder is 
turned off and then back on] 
JL: —were supplying these pigs that were different from the old wallow-in-the-mud 
pigs. Because the—. And the wallow-in-the-mud pigs, wallow in mud, I’d learned, 
because they can’t, their skin doesn’t breathe in the same way, and so they need, then, 
cool liquid or to—. In order to perspire, in a sense. And that these, but these other pigs 
were very lean and would be primarily—. More of the pig would go to food than the thick 
skin that these others, that the traditional pig, had. 
EC: So a more efficient pig? 
JL: A more efficient pig. And so it was my job to, then, hold meetings and give the 
orientation to the youths of—. To how the mechanics of the pig bank, and how a family 
would get a male and a female pig that they would raise the pigs, the pigs would have 
piglets—. 
EC: Hopefully they got along together. 
JL: Right. And then once the pig had piglets, it was their responsibility to return two 
to the bank, and they could then keep the rest for food, and to perpetuate food. And it 
was—. When people heard of the rules that went along with it, like it’s not to go into the 
mud, but instead it will—. It can be staked like you would a sheep or something—. The 
people were—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
68 
EC: Like, “What’s wrong with you all?” [Laughter] 
JL: Right, exactly. As I said, “Next you want us to give that pig a manicure.” 
[Laughter] 
EC: We’re going to be giving pigs baths. 
JL: So it was a challenging project, and did not go as planned. 
EC: Really? 
JL: Yeah, yeah. But—. 
EC: So do you think it was because it was a different kind of care that the pigs needed, 
than what people were accustomed to? Do you think if it had been the kind of pigs that 
were already in Mississippi, it would have worked differently? 
JL: I think it would have worked a bit differently, but then there were other problems. 
The reason for that was that there were other problems that people, that the s—. You 
know, the people who we’re working with, that the nutritionist and everything worried 
about, which was that those were primarily fat as opposed to lean meat, and perpetuating 
an unhealthy diet, and that you were trying to get healthy food to people. And so I think 
that it would have worked if, one, if we had then just had a lot more patience, and had 
stayed with and organized people for a lot longer, I think that this was the kind of thing 
where it was a photo op, an opportunity, you know—. We’re doing good, we have the 
pigs, goodbye, and that now they’re to maintain it on their own, and—. 
EC: It required a longer commitment? 
JL: Right, exactly. Yeah. 
EC: Mm-hmm. So—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
69 
JL: Which, I think, has always been one of those questions [2:20:00] around, even, 
the movement, you know, when we—. This ties back to Lowndes County, in a way, 
where, with people like Bob Mants remaining in Lowndes, and feeling that, no, the work 
isn’t done, that we come through, we do a campaign, but at what point do you declare 
victory and that the work is done, or is it something that continues over a lifetime or 
multiple lifetimes? 
EC: And, you know, another—. Lowndes, I think is a great example, and I’m leaping 
ahead, but you all did a lot of political education work in Lowndes but it wasn’t sustained 
over time. 
JL: Right, right, exactly. 
EC: Well, can you—. So actually, I want to go back. When we were talking about 
Lowndes before, you said one of the things that made you feel good about that is that you 
were treated like a valued worker, and not like a girl or a woman or whatever, some 
special whatever—. And you mentioned the Freedom House, so I assume you’re living in 
a freedom house with men and women and what’s that like for you, as a young woman, 
to be living in this situation, which I believe, probably ten years earlier, people would 
have considered problematic for a young unmarried woman, to be living in a house with 
young unmarried men? 
JL: Right. And that it was because of the, that we were—. Of the relationships and 
the work, that I was comfortable with that. You know, I was comfortable, and that it was, 
I felt perfectly fine and with the guys, and that it was—. And that’s not to say that people 
didn’t have relationships with each other. From time to time, Stokely would arrive from 
a trip that he had been on, a speaking engagement or something, and he’d come back with 
Jennifer Lawson 
70 
some gorgeous person who [Laughter] was supposedly going to volunteer. [Laughter] 
And so, you know, after that, the adventure of this, wore off for this person, that they’d 
usually disappear. Although there was, there were a couple of people who did sort of 
actually stay in the movement and actually continue to work in the movement. But, you 
know, but it was—. 
EC: Stokely was a good was a good recruiter? 
JL: Well. I, I’m not so sure, but he definitely—. There are a number of people who 
saw Lowndes County thanks to Stokely. 
EC: He was a draw. 
JL: He was a draw, yes. [Laughter] 
EC: Can you describe a typical day in Lowndes? 
JL: A typical day was one of—. That we would, after getting up and then deci—. 
We’d talk, usually meetings were on the fly, sometimes we’d sit down and have a more 
formal meeting. We’d get communications with Atlanta and other SNCC offices, was 
very important. And we had this system, the, this WATS phone system, that was really 
important to us. You know, we’re talking pre-cell phones, primitive communications, 
really, in many ways. But we did have walkie-talkies in some of the cars, and so that it 
was, we had some form of rudimentary communications, but we would get this 
information from Atlanta, and that, we’d also—. It wasn’t truly a fax machine, but we had 
some way of getting materials from Atlanta. So we’d get information from Atlanta, and 
we would then talk about, we’d sometimes have calls with Atlanta to talk about what we 
were planning to do, and some of the kinds of questions were that, let’s say that there’s a 
reporter from a magazine, from a national magazine or something, wants to come. And 
Jennifer Lawson 
71 
then the question is, do we allow this or not. And do we want this person tagging around 
with us while we’re trying to get work done or no, and what’s the value, maybe it’s a 
good thing because then he could publicize what we’re doing, maybe not. So we’d have 
discussions about things like that, and then we’d have discussions about where we are 
individually going to work and what’s happening. Who’s working in Hinesville, who’s 
working in another part of Lowndes, and how’s, what’s the progress. 
And I thought of this work as working individually with people, [2:25:00] talking to 
people, talking to families, talking to men and women, voting age, to then try to get them 
to motivated and willing to come to a mass meeting, which would generally be held at a 
church at night, or on the weekends so to get them to come to a church, and then that’s 
when Stokely or somebody would deliver the larger message, to talk about what the 
strategy was and why what we were doing was so important. And then to move from that 
towards the longer goal, which was now the November election. And so the work kept 
building towards that so it was, it had a structure, and that the, for food we were eating all 
kinds of god-awful things, canned sardines and sal tine crackers were a common meal. 
And sometimes families would share their food with us, and—. 
EC: Was that part of it challenging for you, the living conditions? 
JL: No, not—. It was the, I think I was still so focused on the work. Yeah. And every 
time—. Now and then there was a little bit of levity with it, I had, I remember at one 
point, I had brought this old portable record player that I had, and I had, like, a handful of 
45 s, and so that you could hear a bit of music, or that we would go to Selma and, if we 
had a meeting in Selma, then I’d take advantage of being in Selma to have a shower, you 
know, to—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
72 
EC: Wow. That-. 
JL: To wash my hair. 
EC: That says something, right? To have to go to Selma for a shower. 
JL: To wash my—. Oh, one of the funniest times to me was, once, I don’t know why 
we couldn’t go to Phyllis’s for this, but once we went to one of those little by-the-hour 
motels, to take showers. [Laughter] You know, the kind that has the bed with—. 
EC: You’re a little desperate, to go to a—. 
JL: —you put the quarter in and everything? 
EC: It’s interesting, to go to one of those to get clean. 
JL: Yeah. And it was like, while we were there, it was like, “Ooh, a bed,” too, you 
know? And you had to think that, “Oh my God, when was the last time you slept in a 
real bed?” [Laughter] 
EC: Yeah, because you’re on the floor in a sleeping bag? 
JL: Yeah, yeah. 
EC: Yeah. And you—. Phyllis, that’s Phyllis Cunningham, who was at the—. 
JL: Yeah, that’s Phyllis Cunningham. 
EC: With the Medical Committee? 
JL: Medical Committee, yes. 
EC: So would she be stationed in Selma? 
JL: She was. 
EC: Okay. Can you describe, tell us about some of the local people you worked with 
in Lowndes? 
Jennifer Lawson 
73 
JL: The people that I remember most vividly were Mr. Hewlett, who was the head of 
the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, and that he was a rather small-framed man 
who was sort of soft-spoken, but with a sharp sense of humor but also persuasive. And 
then there was the Jackson family, and that was a multi-generational family so they had 
some younger people, younger kids who were younger than we were, even, who then 
were active and would tell us about things that were happening. Like, one night people 
were, some whites were shooting at the tent city on the highway. There was a very 
visible tent city on the highway, these were people who had been displaced from, they 
were sharecroppers who’d been pushed off because they had participated in the civil 
rights activity. And that was another one of those kinds of discussions that I remember, 
at one point, we had, which was the whole question of, is it better for people, and is it 
safer for people, to be on the highway, in this more visible situation, or you could put 
them in the land behind the freedom house, but then obviously if they’re there, the 
problem, then, is an invisible problem somewhat. 
EC: Right, so that they might have some protection because they’re visible, but they’re 
also vulnerable? 
JL: They might have some protection because they’re visible, but they also, then, it 
makes the statement of, this problem exists. 
EC: Oh, okay. So that people can’t ignore them? 
JL: Can’t ignore it, right, exactly. 
EC: That people [2:30:00] are being evicted in many cases for trying to register to 
vote. 
JL: Right. Exactly, exactly. 
Jennifer Lawson 
74 
EC: This is after the Voting Rights Act, correct? 
JL: Right, right. Yeah. And so that’s, so it makes the problem more visible, and so 
you can then have the hope of getting the Justice Department involved or something, so. 
But you also want to be careful and concerned, you’re concerned that you’re not putting 
people’s lives in jeopardy. And so when something comes, like they’re shooting in the 
tents or something, then that’s an emergency kind of thing, where people got in cars and 
then went racing up to find out and make sure that the people there were safe. 
EC: And when you’re racing up, are people in this effort, are people that are 
converging on Tent City, are they armed? 
JL: They are. 
EC: How did that work in Lowndes? 
JL: They, these, it was, you were dealing with, you had people, local people, and local 
people were generally armed, yeah. Local people had their own rifles. We, as SNCC 
people, did not. 
EC: Did the fact that people who tried to register get—. The fact that they were 
evicted, did that make your work harder? 
JL: Of course. It became, with other people being evicted, there are times when some 
people wouldn’t even talk with you. They’d see you coming, and they could tell we had 
on our denim uniforms, in a sense, and between the afros and the denim, they knew 
exactly who you were and it’s a small place in that sense. You know? They knew you 
were not somebody’s cousin or something. And so, in some cases, they just didn’t want 
to talk with you and they felt that you were threatening their livelihood, their security. 
EC: Was that hard for you personally to cope with, that kind of reaction? 
Jennifer Lawson 
75 
JL: No, because I felt I understood it and that I felt that I was going to try to work 
with people in a way that I wanted them to understand. I wanted to talk with, you know, 
“I want to talk with you but I don’t want to—. Is there somewhere else we can talk? Is 
there another time when we can talk?” So that that was more my approach, it was to not 
say that, “Oh, I’m going to stand right here and I can see that guy in that pickup truck and 
I know that he’s the guy you work for and you’re living in his house, you’re a tenant 
farmer right here on this land, that no, I’m going—. I’ll leave, but is there another place, 
another time when I can talk?” 
EC: Would that usually be successful? 
JL: It was—. It wasn’t that it was always successful, but I felt I did have success with 
that, and so we would meet people, sometimes at a church or someone’s house, and at 
night, which was a little creepy, going to some of these places because it’s not as though- 
-. We’re not talking about places where there are house numbers, and—. 
EC: Or streetlights. 
JL: Or streetlights, and—. 
EC: Sidewalks. 
JL: Right. Exactly. So if somebody’s telling you, “Go down and turn not at the—. 
Right after the county road, take the third right.” You know? 
EC: I always like it when they tell you to turn where the tree used to be. [Laughter] 
JL: Right. Those are some great ones. [Laughter] And there’s not even a stump to 
show where the tree used to be. 
EC: Right, everybody just knows. 
JL: Knows, right, exactly. 
Jennifer Lawson 
76 
EC: What were the conversations like, about the—. So in Lowndes County, you’ve got 
the Democratic Party, you’ve got—. Well, in our country people, at the time, think about 
the Democratic and Republican Party. And in Lowndes, you start organizing around an 
independent party. What were those conversations like? 
JL: We were talking about trying to have the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, 
and that was our—. That was the local party that was represented by the Black Panther as 
a symbol. That we, and Mr. Hewlett as the head of that, we were talking about—. 
Success would be them getting the majority and Mr. Hewlett being elected sheriff. You 
know, it was—. Those were the c—. We were talking about county offices, this was not, 
“Let’s go to Atlantic City and challenge seats and things,” this was, “Now, let’s have a 
victory here with this county, here.” And that if these are things that we could do in other 
black belt counties, that this could be a kind of success. 
EC: Why not just participate in the Democratic Party? [2:35:00] 
JL: Because the Democratic Party was at that point, on that county level it represented 
a real segregationist, racist citizens’ council grouping, and so that was not even a 
question. 
EC: Was that hard? I mean, did local people immediately see that, was there any 
sense among local people that they should belong to one of the existing parties? 
JL: Oh I don’t think, I think that they knew that that was not even a question, yeah. 
EC: I know you mentioned that your parents were with the Republican Party. Was 
that an option in Lowndes? 
Jennifer Lawson 
77 
JL: I don’t recall any blacks in Lowndes who were Republicans. You know? But I 
don’t know that they would have been, made themselves more visible because I don’t 
know that they would have come forth for a public debate or anything. 
EC: Was there any talk of using the Republican Party as a vehicle for—. 
JL: Not among us. I don’t recall any. 
EC: Do you have a sense of why that wasn’t considered an option? 
JL: I think that it was, again, more the question of that, here was, that moving away 
from national political parties, and national politics, that here on this small microcosm 
level, that we have this opportunity to demonstrate the ability to, that if people register to 
vote and are the majority, to claim, then, the role of the majority they are in to run the 
county, and then have all of the benefits that running the county would bring to them. So 
I think that that was much more the notion at that point. 
EC: How did the Black Panther become associated with Lowndes County? 
JL: The majority of people who were living in Lowndes and other counties, then, the 
adults, the education was so, so poor that the majority of people were illiterate. And that 
you would then have people voting based upon a symbol. And the, when it came time for 
the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which was the official name of the party 
there, to choose a symbol to represent it, they thought, they said, “Well, the other party, 
the Democrats, were the—.” They had that white rooster, and they said, “What we need is 
a mean black cat to run that old rooster out of the county.” And so that was, then they 
sort of said they wanted a black cat, a black panther, to be that symbol. And this was still 
at a point where, in the South, you had enough wildlife that there were the occasional 
panthers and things. So they wanted a panther to be the symbol. And that’s when the 
Jennifer Lawson 
78 
Atlanta office sent down the drawing that became used, and I was one who would use my 
limited artistic skills to reproduce these things on posters, and on our sign for the 
Freedom Organization’s headquarters. 
EC: So would you paint those—. I mean, would you be able to just look at this panther 
because it—. 
JL: Fd do it freehand, I would—. 
EC: Freehand? And you’d draw that panther, and—. 
JL: Right, right exactly. 
EC: Paint. 
JL: Right, then I’d draw, sketch it, and then paint in the outline, give him his whiskers 
and everything, his pouncing move, and—. So I’d do that, and I did it on posters as well 
so we would have, if we were having a meeting and having a poster, it would say, “The 
Lowndes County Freedom Organization,” and then it would have the symbol. And that 
we, as we got towards November, then we started becoming very concerned about 
violence. There was this whole question of the whites and how they might react to blacks 
in the county seat for voting. And so we started thinking that, “Well, it would be great if 
we could somehow communicate, vote, and then go home.” But don’t stay, don’t linger, 
vote and go home. And so we decided that was the message that we would try to get 
across in all of the meetings, the mass meetings that we would have. But then somebody 
here sort of says, “Oh, wouldn’t it be great if we had billboards?” And I said, “Well, if 
you get me the lumber, if you get the lumber I’ll make the billboards.” And I think I 
made maybe four of them. 
EC: So you actually, you didn’t just paint them, [2:40:00] you made the billboard—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
79 
JL: We made big billboards, billboard-sized. We made billboards, and that I then 
hand-painted these things, and that the message, again, was vote—, I think it was 
November eighth. Vote November eighth, or whatever the date was, for the Black 
Panther. “Pull the lever for the Black Panther, and then go home.” And the go home 
was, for us, an important part of that. 
EC: Because you didn’t want anybody to get hurt? 
JL: Right, we didn’t want—. And so, of course, as soon as we put those up, some of 
them were shot, riddled with bullet holes. [Laughter] 
EC: They become target practice? 
JL: Right. 
EC: I know one of the other things that you were doing was creating political 
education material? 
JL: Yes, and those were, when we talk about the kind of conversations that we had at 
night, that—. You know, this is the time where there’s no television, there is no radio. As 
I said, we would have long discussions until it was time for bed and that—. So Courtland, 
Stokely, all of us would talk and that—. Sometimes Courtland and I, in particular, would 
talk about, “Well, wouldn’t it be great if we could try to have people understand more of 
what the strategy is here.” You know, and we sort of said, “Well, maybe we could—.” 
you know, I said, “Well, if you could state it, I could draw it.” And that we would then, 
we came up with making these sort of comics, almost, this graphic representation of what 
we were—. You know, there was a man named Mr. Blackman, and he lived—. So we 
would do these, and then, to be able to use in meetings to talk about what we were, what 
Jennifer Lawson 
80 
the strategy was and what we were trying to do in getting the vote, and why the vote 
would be important. 
EC: Do you--. How did people respond to those? 
JL: I think peopled liked them. I think people liked them, and I think it was 
something like—. You know how, same way that you have a hymnal and you can follow 
along? I think it was that kind of thing, where people could, when they, they could 
follow the story, in a sense, and it gave a kind of, in the same way that now a Power Point 
would do, it gave a kind of graphic representation to what’s the story. So it wasn’t just 
people standing there talking. And in some cases, sometimes these people standing, 
talking, could go awry because people could begin to go on and on in ways that were 
meaningful for them, but not necessarily really the appropriate language or a real 
connection to the audience, and not enough of a real dialogue with the audience, too, 
yeah. 
EC: One of the things I found interesting was the descriptions of what the offices 
were. What a sheriff does, what a coroner does—. 
JL: Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah. 
EC: And can you talk about why that was necessary? 
JL: It was necessary because people had been so disenfranchised in all of these 
counties, that they had not a clue, it didn’t seem feasible and real, that these were jobs 
that they could have and that people, that the African Americans, could have. And that 
they didn’t have a sense of, what does this person do and why does it really matter? 
What role does the coroner play, what role does the sheriff. What’s the sheriffs 
responsibilities? You know. To just, and it was as if they had just been handed power 
Jennifer Lawson 
81 
and ordained—. You know, from on high, centuries and decades ago, and so that was the 
way it was always going to be. And that this was our way of trying to break that spell 
and help people peer behind that curtain, and have a greater understanding of, “Oh, okay, 
so that’s how this works.” 
EC: That these are actually defined jobs, and—. 
JL: These are defined jobs, yeah. 
EC: —clearly identifiable, yeah. 
JL: Right, exactly. 
EC: Can you talk about how the candidates were chosen or selected for the freedom 
party? 
JL: That, it was—, I did not play any real role in that, and I have a feeling that it, that 
people emerged and that was always something that was wonderful to see, where you go 
to these mass meetings and when you first start to work in a community, you can often—. 
[2:45:00] First of all, you’re thrilled that people actually come to a meeting because that’s 
an act of courage, you know. And that there are people who come, and that certain 
characters begin to stand out. You know, often there’s a minister who assumed that he is 
the leader because he has the church and that he is the leader and that everybody’s going 
to listen to him, and that’s the beginning and the end of it. But then there’s someone else, 
and quite often it is a woman who will then stand up and ask some very good questions or 
make some very good statements that then paves the road for others to participate as well. 
And that you began to then hear and see who the leaders, or the potential leaders, really 
are. And it, so you see this leadership that kind of emerges from that, and those were the 
Jennifer Lawson 
82 
people that we would begin to really focus on and work with to find out whether they 
were indeed willing to—. 
EC: Run? 
JL: Run. 
EC: Or assume some leadership position. 
JL: Right, exactly. Or to whether they’re willing to convene the next meeting or 
something. 
EC: I mean, that sounds like it’s, epitomizes Ella Baker’s ideas. Were you aware of 
that at the time? 
JE: I wasn’t, I wasn’t. I didn’t meet Mrs. Baker until much later. I knew of her but I 
didn’t meet her until much later. I kept, I learned, I was learning my sort of—, my job in 
the Civil Rights Movement by on-the-job training, in many ways. And that I was 
learning, I had the very good fortune that I was working with some of the absolute best. 
You know, I was working with Charlie Cobb, and Courtland, and Ivanhoe, and so we 
would talk about things, and so through some of the discussions that we would have, I 
knew, I grew to know of community organizing and some principles and some thoughts, 
so I knew who Saul Alinsky was even though I had never read anything by Alinsky. You 
know, and I knew of certain others, and—. But, again, this was in, through these 
discussions that we were having. 
EC: So that you pick it up as you go along? 
JL: You pick it up as you go along, or you discover that you’re having a certain 
degree of success with something—. That I find that, if I’m going, and if I meet one 
woman and she’s amenable to something, and that—. If she says, “Sure, you can spend— 
Jennifer Lawson 
83 
there were occasions where I spent the night at a family’s home because they agreed 
that then, the next day, they were going to be doing something or going somewhere 
where I could meet other people. 
EC: So then they can connect you, and—. 
JL: Right, exactly. 
EC: Eve always, is it, was it Alice Moore who ran for tax assessor? Em blanking on 
her name. 
JL: Yeah, Em blanking on the people at this point—. That name seems familiar but 
Em really—. It’s amazing how, when I, it’s very interesting, going through an interview 
like this, because after fifty years of being disconnected to the events—. 
EC: Trying to dredge them back up? 
JL: To trying to—. Yeah, yeah. 
EC: Well Eve read about the Lowndes County movement, and if I have her name 
correct or not, I recall that her platform for running for tax assessor was, “Tax the rich 
and feed the poor,” which always kind of stood out to me. And—. 
JL: [Laughter] Where is she when we need her now? 
EC: I know, right? I know. Can you describe—. You know, you talked about these 
SNCC folks who were good organizers that you’re working with, can you describe a few 
of them for us? 
JL: Sure, sure. And it’s that—. Charlie Cobb was just a—. Charlie, I think, is still one 
of the smartest people that I know, and it’s, and that he was, it was always interesting to 
just see his mind at work, in a sense, to be confronted with a problem. You know, we 
were there, and that we were mulling over a particular problem, and that then to have 
Jennifer Lawson 
84 
Charlie sort of articulate what he sees the framework of the problem. Courtland 
[2:50:00] was always very good, too, at then beginning to connect it, connect the dots to a 
bigger picture, and put it in a context. And so for me, the two of them were just 
wonderful. And then Bob Mants had this more folksy connection to the people, and 
thinking of, “Okay, now how do we translate this to the people?” And I think that I fell 
more in that same spectrum with Bob Mants, on, “Okay, now here we defined the 
problem, we know what we need to do, and now let’s come up with a plan.” And so I 
think, I think that I would say that Courtland, Ivanhoe, and Charlie were more the larger 
framework thinkers in that way, and that, then, that Featherstone, Mants, and I fell more 
into the implementation. Let’s now come up with a plan of action and start moving on 
this, yeah. 
EC: And where does Stokely fit into this larger picture? 
JL: Stokely, initially, I think, was much more on the “Let’s think it through” stage of 
things, and side of things, but he would—. I think he would see, too, the others, to 
Courtland and to Charlie at first, and that there was a point at which, when he became 
more sort of—. When the media began to pay far more attention to Stokely, that’s when 
he then began to, I think, emerge, and began to trust his own thinking, which was 
sometimes not necessarily the best thing for him to do. [Laughter] I think he suffered as 
a result of not having all of those really solid, you know, ears and minds to bounce ideas 
off of. 
EC: So that, with the media attention, he becomes more of an individual person? 
JL: He became more of an individual acting along, and that he, because as time would 
move along, I think he became trapped in his own rhetoric, too. And so that, rather than 
Jennifer Lawson 
85 
having a thoughtful answer to something, it became, “Black Power.” You know? It 
became a lot of empty sloganeering, unfortunately. 
[Recorder is turned off and then back on] 
JL: It was rather sad to see what happened, was happening to Stokely, too, because 
that—. He then began to really believe that it was him that they wanted to hear, and that 
they, that—. And it was really about him, and that the media were, you know, that it was 
him and the media rather than, and it was no longer about the organization, or no longer 
about the cause, or—. So he became somewhat trapped in that world. 
EC: So—. And, of course, that’s one of the things that Ella Baker had worried about 
early on, or had objected to with SCLC, right? The sort of projection of an individual or 
the focus. How did he respond when people tried to pull him back? 
JL: Oh, he would get angry, you know. Because he felt, “You just don’t see it. It’s 
me.” You know, I—. Yeah. And then, of course, I think that he thought that, perhaps, it 
was jealousy or that there were other motives, but that he couldn’t—. And that he could 
not understand that there were times when we thought, as an organization, that what his 
off-the-cuff remarks were completely antithetical to what we as an organization felt, and 
that he could not just define himself as being our spokesperson. Or that if you’re going to 
be connected with an organization, then you really need to reflect the ethos and the 
thoughts and the direction of the organization, that you’re—. So he began to think of 
himself as, “Oh, I’m the leader. [2:55:00] You folks just need to—.” 
EC: Get in line? 
JL: —’’get in line and follow.” 
EC: Can you think of a specific example of a topic or an incident? 
Jennifer Lawson 
86 
JL: Not at this point I can’t, yes. Mm-hmm. 
EC: You mentioned, earlier, the murder of one of your classmates, Sammy Young. 
And in Lowndes County, Jonathan Daniels, a white seminarian—. 
JL: Right, right. 
EC: —was also murdered. Can you talk about those two incidents and their impact on 
you or the movement? 
JL: The, of, when it was, I think, very early in 1966, in January of 1966. And that I, 
by now, was living—. I was living in Tuskegee, but I don’t think I was still—. I’m not 
sure whether I was in school or not, but I know I was not living in a dormitory, I had a 
small apartment off-campus now, and was working actively with student groups and 
others, and we had had a meeting, earlier that evening, and that Sammy Young, Jr., and 
some other students, we’d all been a part of this meeting. I had gone back to my place, I 
was at my apartment, and someone knocks at the door and it’s one of my classmates who 
then one of these—. Not classmates, but one of the other people who had been a part of 
the group. And she was there in disbelief, saying, “They killed Sammy.” And that—. 
You know, I couldn’t, it just was incredulous to me. I mean, this was someone that I had 
just seen a few hours before, and she says, “They killed Sammy,” and that they she told 
me that Sammy, and that these other people had gone to this gas station, he was, and he 
had asked to use the restroom. And the guy had told him, no, he couldn’t use it, he 
wouldn’t allow him to use the restroom. And that Sammy had said, “No, man, where’s 
the restroom, I’m going to use the restroom,” and that the guy had pulled a gun on 
Sammy, and Sammy had pulled out a golf club, because he had a golf club in his car or 
Jennifer Lawson 
87 
something, and but that the man shot him. And you know. And that he died right there, 
at the gas station. 
And so it was—. That was a pivotal point for me because it was yet another one of those 
times where I’ve, and this was still when I was trying to make this decision of which 
direction am I going in, do I stay in school, do I leave and work full-time in the 
movement. And that’s when I just felt that, okay, this is part of “You go, you work in the 
movement, you can come back to these other things but that you have to, that we all have 
to change this place, that we can’t—.” You know, what does it mean to be a doctor if this 
is the world that you’re going to live in? That there are all of these—. There were 
doctors, a lot of black doctors. Tuskegee is an unusual place, they had a VA hospital and 
so there are an abundance of black professionals right there, who taught at the school, 
who worked at the VA hospital, the Tuskegee airmen, all of this. You know, that’s all a 
part of that little world there. But that you could then be killed in that little world, too. 
So I just felt that, you know, it is more important to spend time trying to make this world 
safer for African Americans, a better place, a more equal place, and that—. So that was 
yet more that was moving me towards working full-time with SNCC. 
EC: Does his murder influence SNCC’s position on Vietnam? 
JL: I can’t recall, I really can’t recall because that was, we were very definitely, the 
whole thing of the Vietnam was very definitely an issue for us, but I can’t recall 
specifically a connection to Sammy’s murder. 
EC: What about Jonathan Daniels? 
Jennifer Lawson 
88 
JL: Jonathan Daniels was killed in Lowndes County, and he was killed when he was 
standing next to Ruby Sales. And Ruby was one of my classmates at Tuskegee. 
[3:00:00] Ruby had been at Tuskegee, and had then become active. 
EC: What was the context, the situation? 
JL: I wasn’t there so I only know what I heard and read, and it was my understanding 
that someone had been incensed by the idea of Jonathan Daniels being there with these 
black people, and that had then said ugly things to him, and that Daniels was killed, in 
part, trying to also protect Ruby. 
EC: Yeah. Did it have an impact beyond the personal, in terms of what SNCC was 
trying to do in Lowndes? 
JL: I don’t think so. I mean, I feel that it was something where I think people in these 
areas that, always, when someone dies trying to help them, that I think that that’s always 
something. It works sort of two ways, I mean, on the one hand the part of it is, “These 
people are so crazy they’ll kill the white people, you know what they’ll do to us.” So this 
can be a frightening thing, but I think there’s another side of it, of, that you treasure life 
and the value of a life in a way that you feel that, “Oh, if somebody is trying to do this to 
help us, that we should—. Surely we can do this for ourselves and we can move one more 
step forward,” you know. But I don’t know that it had that big an impact in that way. 
EC: Young people often don’t have the same sense of mortality as their elders—. 
JL: Right, oh, definitely not, definitely not. 
EC: —and yet you call in SNCC had to confront people dying—. 
JL: Constantly, constantly. And there was another classmate from Tuskegee who 
became active in the movement, and I forget, I’m trying to remember where he died. 
Jennifer Lawson 
89 
George Best. B-E-S-T. And he and another guy, they died, middle of the night, their car 
was found overturned in a shallow, like, not really even a river, or—. More like a little 
creek or something. But they had—. And we never knew whether they had just 
accidentally run off the road, or whether they had been run off the road. So it was, it, the 
circumstances were uncertain but the car, obviously, had veered, had gone off the road 
and flipped. And they had been trapped underneath and died. 
EC: How did you cope with those kinds of things? 
JL: Just feel that you’ve been to far too many memorial services, funerals, and you 
sang the same civil rights songs and everything, far too many times. But you also, it kind 
of—. Em sure it—. I mean, part of it is somewhat like being in the army, I would think, 
so when we think of ourselves as veterans of the Civil Rights Movement, I think the term 
is an apt one. And I believe that many of us, including myself, have suffered at various 
points from forms of PTSD. Because there’s some, some of these things become just so 
alarming and so frightening, and so horrible that [pause] And then there are the other 
times, when you feel that, “Okay, we’ve lost yet another person,” but this sort of steels 
your, it hardens your will Move on. Because you feel that you want there to be a victory 
because we’ve already lost so much and lost so many wonderful people. 
EC: That we have to get something out of this. 
JL: We have to, yeah, yeah. 
EC: We talked another time and you told me, speaking of violence and PTSD, about a 
time when you were in the car with George Greene? 
JL: Yes. 
EC: Can you tell us about that? 
Jennifer Lawson 
90 
JL: That was right, that was, I believe—[someone sneezes]. It was either on my way 
to Montgomery for the, from Tuskegee, for that march, or it was returning. And either 
way, it was that George was driving. We had this fleet of—. There was the, SNCC had a 
fleet of cars [3:05:00] called the Sojourner Motor Fleet, and they were these, like, Dodge 
Darts or something, but they were these cars. And you could sometimes tell one of them 
because they also had these long whip-like antennas on them because they were equipped 
with the, some of them were equipped with the walkie-talkies so they were kind of 
visible. George was an incredible driver. I mean, he really, he should have been at 
NASCAR or something, because he had this real skill like that. However, however. The 
last thing that you wanted was to be in the car in the middle of the night on a highway in 
a car with George, speeding down at over a hundred miles an hour. You know? 
EC: Wow. And these are not four-lane highways? 
JL: No. These are two-lane. 
EC: And they’re not interstate? 
JL: No. And that it is, we were stopped by a policeman, and it’s being there with 
George, and you just don’t quite know how he’s going to respond to this. Oh, just 
absolutely frightening because you don’t know if he’s going to do something that will 
give the policeman an excuse to shoot him, shoot us. So, very scary. 
EC: Was he going that fast because he was afraid that someone like—. You know, that 
the Klan might stop you all, or—. Is this before Viola Liuzzo’s murder? 
JL: And that’s what I don’t remember, whether it was before or after Viola Liuzzo 
was killed. But with George, he often, under any circumstance, he drove really fast. 
EC: So once he had the skill, he employed it whether he needed or not, perhaps? 
Jennifer Lawson 
91 
JL: Right, right. And that he could do that, I mean, it was a skill that he had that was 
this kind of skill where you probably have seen, like, in movies or things, where people 
can spin the car, where they’re going at a really high rate of speed in this direction, 
you’re going north, and then they can just have it where it just switches and then goes—. 
He could do that. But still, you don’t want to be in the car when he’s doing it. 
EC: Unless there’s somebody after—. Well, even if there’s somebody after, you don’t 
want to be the—. 
JL: Right, yeah, yeah. Because you’d have think that, “No, it may not make sense to 
be, to out-run them.” You know? These are not situations that you feel you can win 
necessari—. And those were the k—. That was, speaking of the situations you don’t feel 
you can win, that was one of the conversations that I remember we had, as one of those 
night discussions, which was the whole question of nonviolence versus violence. And 
the notion of whether, of how senseless it could be, that if black people were to try to take 
on the injustices through a kind of military action, and through an armed revolt, and at 
how, that you felt that it would be suicidal, ultimately, because that, you’re just out¬ 
gunned in terms of firepower, and that—. Or the other one was, similar to that, was there 
was one point where we would get news of other groups, like there was this group, the 
Republic of New Afrika, and other groups who then felt that their philosophy was that 
there should be a state, a black state or a black country—. 
EC: Yeah, what did you think of that? 
JL: —carved out. And, again, it was one of those things where we felt that that was 
untenable, that it wasn’t something that you, that we were not fighting to have Lowndes 
County and, you know, to move through that, to have the state of Alabama declared to be 
Jennifer Lawson 
92 
black Alabama, Blackabama, something, that, no, that wasn’t our goal. Our goal was to 
make the entirety of the United States a place that we could all be comfortable and live, 
with equal rights. And that our goal was to have equal rights, not to have this isolated 
place. [3:10:00] So we had meaningful and good discussions about black culture, the role 
of black culture, segregation, self-segregation. 
EC: With these, did you oppose the idea of a black state for logistical, sort of practical 
reasons? Or the idea of it in general, or some combination? 
JL: A combination. For me personally, I felt that it was, that it wasn’t, I wasn’t 
seeking to have a black state, I was seeking to be comfortable living in the whole world. 
And wanted to be able to have equality for me and my people in the whole world, not in 
some— 
EC: Isolated? 
JL: —isolated place. 
[Recorder is turned off and then back on] 
EC: What was it like during the Lowndes County primary election or nominating 
convention? 
JL: That, there were—. I recall it being a tense time and lots of drama. Real concern 
about what might happen and that Hinesville, Hinesville was the county seat, I believe, 
and—. 
EC: Sounds right. 
JL: —but there was this real concern about what might happen, and so the kind of 
drama around that. And just, us kind of moving about the county, to make sure that 
Jennifer Lawson 
93 
nothing really bad is happening. Because, again, this is in a time when you don’t have, 
really, the best efficient, the most efficient news-gathering. 
EC: Yeah. So you have to really travel the roads to see how things are going? 
JL: Right, you have to travel the roads, and to—. Yeah. 
EC: Eve seen pictures, you know, of all these people gathered and voting, and—. 
Were you there at all, or were you just traveling the county? 
JL: We were—. As I recall, we were taking people, driving people to the polls, too. I 
want to think that I took people to the polls. 
EC: I was actually thinking about—. So, there’s the convention where people are 
voting just to, within the Lowndes County Freedom—. 
JL: Lowndes County Freedom Organization. 
EC : And then after that—. 
JL: After that, November was the actual, I think that I’m confusing it with November, 
which is when I drove people to the polls. I don’t remember the convention. I don’t 
remember the Lowndes County Freedom Organization Convention. But I remember, 
then, the—. It’s the November election that I remember, where we were then actually 
taking people to the polls, and that was—. 
EC: And it was tense? 
JL: —the tense, and there’s also the kind of anticipation of, “Will we be so fortunate 
as to win or not,” and “Will the seats be—.” You know. So. 
EC: And what was it like, I mean, how did you—. I guess how did you foil—. Were 
SNCC people or Lowndes County people able to be there for the vote, the count of the 
votes, or how did you learn the results? 
Jennifer Lawson 
94 
JL: I recall learning the results later, not being, I don’t think we could be present for 
the count of the votes. 
EC: And none of the candidates were successful? 
JL: Right, right, exactly. 
EC: How did people locally respond to the election, then, to not being able to win in 
this first round? 
JL: I think that it was one where they were, they probably were less surprised than we 
were. I think that they had, you know, lowered expectations, lower expectations. But it 
was, the good news was that people were willing to continue. You know? It wasn’t as 
though they felt that, “Well, you folks tried something that was interesting, now let’s go 
back to life as usual, or the way things were.” But you felt that things would continue to 
move forward. And that was the good news, that was, to me, the win of it all. 
EC: How long did you stay in Lowndes, or what, when and how did you leave and 
move on to something different? 
JL: I, after that, we ended up from—. There was a SNCC conference, I can’t 
remember where this particular conference was. We would have these national, these 
annual meetings of sorts, and that one was at this place, Peg Leg Bates Resort, and that 
these would be the meetings where we would have the election for officers, and so one 
was the point at which John Lewis had been the chair of SNCC. 
EC: I think this one was Kingston Springs? 
JL: Kingston Springs, [3:15:00] New York, and that may have been Peg Leg Bates 
Resort or something, or—. 
EC: I think it’s actually outside of Nashville? Kingston Springs, Tennessee—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
95 
JL: Kingston Springs, okay, Tennessee, yes. Okay. Kingston Springs, Tennessee. 
Because there was one, I know, was up in the Poconos or something, the—. 
EC: Yeah. That’s the Peg Leg Bates? 
JL: That’s the Peg Leg Bates Resort. But we’d have, we’d go to these places—. One 
famous one that I was not present at was Waveland. But so we’d have these meetings. 
And at this particular meeting, and I guess it was the Kingston Springs meeting, that 
that’s the point at which John—. It was assumed that John would continue as the head of 
SNCC, and that I recall Fay Bellamy being very outspoken in the same way that I was 
talking about how sometimes the local women would then stand and speak a truth that 
then created a different dynamic, changed the dynamic? And this was a time when Fay 
did that, and that changed the dynamic of the meeting so that it became clear that, in 
essence, that John’s time was past and that now we were moving towards Stokely, and 
that we were moving towards a new day and a new form of leadership and a new central, 
a new group of principles, in many ways. And that I was voted to the central 
coordinating committee, I was voted onto that, and so I was being asked to, in essence, 
play a greater part in the leadership of SNCC, which was, I was honored by, and that I 
then ended up moving more towards Atlanta. And I may be getting dates and everything 
all mixed up here, but that I started, after Lowndes County, then, I started working, 
eventually I started working out of Atlanta more. 
EC: What was your work like in Atlanta? 
JL: In Atlanta, I worked with—. It was much more strategy and discussions than 
actual organizing. I didn’t do, we weren’t, we were not doing, from the national office, 
we were not doing any work in the local community, but it was much more the providing 
Jennifer Lawson 
96 
services to the people who were still working in counties out in the field. And so I 
worked with Karen Spellman and others, Ruby Doris Robinson and others, doing that. 
Fay Bellamy. And Ethel Minor, who had worked at one point for Malcolm X. The, that 
was a point, too, when I was in Atlanta, there became this different kind of fracturing 
within SNCC, which was Zoharah Simmons and a group, a guy named Bill Ware, I 
believe, who had created a local project to work in the inner city of Atlanta. Some reason 
the name Ivy City or something—. 
EC: Ivy City? Is that what you said? 
JL: Em not sure what it was—. 
EC: I think there were a few names for it. Was—. Oh. 
JL: But it was a, there was a local community there, and where it was a low-income 
housing, and they started to work there, and it was—. And what, in essence, you were 
having, was this kind of discussion and debate about what’s the future, and which 
direction does SNCC go in? And part of it is black power, part of it is dealing with urban 
problems and urban issues, and the—. With the question being, “What are you doing 
when you attempt to deal with urban issues?” Versus the Lowndes County kind of get- 
out-the-vote, and securing the vote. 
EC: In Atlanta, were African Americans, did they have pretty good access to the ballot 
at this point? If they would go out and register? 
JL: Right, in Atlanta, yes. [3:20:00] 
EC: So in Atlanta, you can, people can register, it’s just a question of whether they 
will, and then if so what will they do with that, and whether that will do the trick? 
Jennifer Lawson 
97 
JL: Right, right. So in Atlanta, it wasn’t about the consolidating political power in 
that way, or having the authority and having, being able to hold office and you know. 
You had had blacks that held office, you had blacks who were quite wealthy, you had a 
whole, all of the problems and all of the resources that you might expect in an urban area, 
and Atlanta was, in the South at that time, a rather unusual urban area. People would call 
it, “Up north, in Atlanta,” or you know. LA, Lovely Atlanta. But Atlanta was a much 
more liberal and advanced area for a major southern city, and the, but the Atlanta Project, 
which was what the group, that Gwen and Bill and others were focused on, they then 
wanted to do this organizing within, felt that we should be focusing on organizing within 
this--. 
EC: Is it Buttermilk Bottom? Was that a different part of Atlanta? 
JL: I think that’s a different part. 
EC: Oh! I had it. Vine. 
JL: Vine City. Yeah. And I see why I called—. Ivy City is here in DC, Vine City. 
Yes. But they really wanted to, they had—. And that was, and so that was beginning to 
cause some tensions. 
EC: Well, they were advocating for separatism, right? 
JL: Right. 
EC: Is that—. Yeah. And so there are internal tensions, within SNCC, on where to go? 
JL: Right, right. And so those, so it was a time of lots of meetings and discussions 
and questions about the future and where we’re—. You know, which direction and where 
we’re heading, and. 
Jennifer Lawson 
98 
EC: You mentioned the Waveland meeting, which is one you said that you weren’t at- 
JL: Right. 
EC: —it’s kind of a famous meeting. 
JL: Right, exactly. 
EC: And that one takes place in, you know, November 1964, which is when you’re in 
Jackson, working on voter—, I don’t know if it was the same—. 
JL: Same time, right. 
EC: The same general time frame. And you’re really, at this point, moving in the 
direction of SNCC, so you’re still—. 
JL: Right, right. 
EC: But for a lot of people that’s kind of a moment of feeling like things are coming 
apart. 
JL: Exactly, yeah. 
EC: I know Judy feels that way, and yet for you, that’s really more of a start. 
JL: Exactly. 
EC: I don’t know if there’s anything more to say about that, but do you have any 
thoughts on what it was like for you to come into the organization at that point? you’re 
almost like a new generation. 
JL: Right, right. And that’s in essence what we were, but it’s, it was—. And that—. 
We were in different organizations, in many ways, then. Because Judy was, then, a 
person who was then the Judy of desegregation and lunch counters as well, and that was 
not as, that was not my world. You know, the lunch counters or the Diane Nash and the 
Jennifer Lawson 
99 
sit-ins, and the bus rides, and the freedom rides. But instead, mine was this really, the 
voter registration. 
EC: It was always fieldwork and voter registration, power—. 
JL: It was the fieldwork. Voter registration. It was looking at political power, black 
power within that context, but black power within the context of political power within 
the United States. 
EC: As opposed to separat—, 
JE: As opposed to a separatist thing of, “Oh, well we’ll go and have the, South 
Carolina would be a good state.” [Laughter] 
EC: [Laughter] Not Mississippi? [Laughter] So how did those debates or discussions, 
that aspect, affect you within the organization? 
JL: That, I found those—. To me those were stimulating, and it was somewhat 
energizing because it’s through discussions like that that you would then gain a better 
sense of yourself and of what you believed in and what you understood, and the world as 
you saw it. And so it, you know, I began to realize that, no, I thought it illogical to be 
separatist, I thought it illogical to be an advocate of armed warfare of any kind, I thought 
it—. That these were things that did not work for me and that, over time, later, those 
became [3:25:00] some of the aspects that led me away from SNCC. You know, so that 
by the time that the election of Rap Brown and Phil—. What’s Phil’s last name? 
EC: Hutchings? 
JL: Yes. That I just felt that, no, this is you know. This is not, in the same way that 
Judy probably felt about Waveland, but this was now not the organization that I wanted 
to belong to. 
Jennifer Lawson 
100 
EC: And so that must have been, Rap must have been elected in 1967? And 
Hutchings in 1968? 
JL: Yeah, that’s what I think. 
EC: Okay. That sounds right. So as you move away from SNCC, where do you—. 
Well actually, before—. 
JL: As I moved away from SNCC, that’s when I moved towards Mississippi—. 
EC: And the work with the National Council of Negro Woman? 
JL: Woman. And then with MACE, with—. And so those became the late [19]60s for 
me. But I’ve, I was still sort of in Atlanta in—, I was in Atlanta through part of—. Yeah, 
I think I was still in Atlanta in 1968. 
EC: What was it like, what was the Atlanta office like when you begin to work there 
on a regular basis, like who are the key people, what does the work look like? 
JL: When I was there, the Atlanta was, the office was on Nelson Street, I think it was 
360 Nelson. And that we, you went up a flight, it was an industrial kind of loft-like space 
and you, the entry was on the second floor, up a narrow flight of stairs. Downstairs, 
Wilson Brown was the king of the printing press. And the press was an important part of 
it, and that was, you know, Julian Bond and the—. But Wilson was the actual printer and 
he practically lived in the building, you know, manning the press. 
EC: Was he a printer before he came to SNCC, where did he learn that? 
JE: I don’t know, I don’t know. But he really practically lived there, doing that. 
EC: And he créât—. So he would create the booklets, he would create the fundraising 
materials, and—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
101 
JL: Right, right. And we had, I think there was a publication, Student Voice or 
something, I think that—. 
EC: There was a Student Voice, and then the name changed at a certain point, the—. 
Well, there was a Liberator, and I don’t know if that was—. Anyway. 
JL: I don’t—. But he, but the publications were coming out of there. Then, on the, on 
that second floor, the main floor, which is where the offices were, there was one point 
where it was Jim Forman and who else was—? That Ethel Minor, Freddie Green Biddle, 
Karen Spellman, Fay Bellamy, Stanley Wise, Bill Porter. Those are the people that I 
remember most, there, on that. And Jack Minnis, and Bill Mahoney. And Bill Mahoney 
was an interesting person; this goes back to the question of passing. Bill Mahoney could 
easily have passed for white. Bill, somebody has said that Bill had gone to some student 
demonstration when he was at Howard, I think, or something, and had worn a, put a sign 
on himself that says, “I am black,” or something, but you would not have thought of him. 
He, you know, as an African American. If you’d—. Just by sheer appearance. 
EC: You wouldn’t? 
JL: No, no. 
EC: And he was involved in Howard in the early days, right? 
JL: Right, right. 
EC: Was he on the freedom rides? 
JE: I don’t know. 
EC: Sit-ins for sure. 
JL: Yes, but very definitely. Yeah, mm-hmm. 
Jennifer Lawson 
102 
EC: So if I’m looking at this list, it looks to me like, is Jack Minnis the only white 
person that you can remember in the Atlanta office at that time? 
JL: At that time, right, yeah. Mm-hmm. 
EC: Oh, do you remember when Dottie and Bob Zellner submitted a proposal to stay 
on staff but work in the white community? 
JL: I remember that, but—. And I didn’t really know them that well, but I remember 
discussion of it and the idea that, if people were basically[3:30:00] saying, “Sure, you go 
and work in the white community but you don’t need to be in SNCC in order to do that, 
just go and organize your people, you know?” 
EC: Yeah, yeah. 
JL: And so there was still, there was that whole question of having sort of pushed the 
whites out, was still, that notion was still very much in discussion, there would still be 
someone who would, whether it was Zellner or someone else, there was another guy—. 
Oh, what was his name, I can’t recall his name right now—. Where it would surface from 
time to time, and in these very emotional ways, too, where people felt, you know, some 
of the whites who felt that they had been such a part of the family, and it was now like 
they had been kicked out of the family. And that I remember, Courtland and some of the 
others trying to depersonalize it, and saying that it’s not about you as an individual or 
anything, but there’s a point at which we must do this, that we as African Americans, we 
as black people, have to be in charge of our own destiny, we can’t have things look as 
though it’s this, we can’t have this kind of, you know, paternalism of, that you must do 
this for us, or you must, that we can’t do it ourselves. That this is really important, that 
we do this. 
Jennifer Lawson 
103 
EC: Did, was he successful, do you know? Do you have a sense of whether there were 
people who were responsive to that way of looking at the issue? 
JL: I think that, to this day, when you, you know, if you follow some of the reunions 
and things, that I think, to this day, there’s still that undercurrent of that. 
EC: So I know we already talked about—. Actually, I had another question. So not 
only is that list almost all black, but there’s a strong representation of black women. 
JL: Yes. 
EC: What is your experience, working in this office with such a strong group of black 
women? 
JL: It was, I—. Oh, Mildred Tillinghast was another person, so even—. 
EC: Muriel? 
JL: Yeah, Muriel. Muriel Tillinghast. And there was a Mildred, I’m trying to think 
of—. 
EC: Forman? 
JL: Yeah, Mildred Forman, and then there’s another—. Myrtle Glascoe. So yes. I 
mean, I—. Joyce Brown. I felt that there were a number of strong women, a number of 
women who were very much a part of the organization and of its day-to-day functions 
and activities, and that was true not just there but in other places as well. I thought of 
some of the fundraising activities as being very much dependent upon the work of Bobby 
Yancey, and of Shirley Cooks. Shirley Wright, Shirley Cooks. But I thought that it was, 
I thought some of the portrayal, sometimes, by people outside the organization based 
upon Stokely’s crude comments over the role of women, the position of women in the 
movement as prone? Yeah. I thought that there was this notion that it was male-driven, 
Jennifer Lawson 
104 
when in reality I don’t think it ever was. You know, when you, whether it’s, you’re 
talking about Fanny Lou Hamer or Unita Blackwell or you know, Annie Devine, you—. 
Locally you’re talking about strong women and powerful women and women who are in 
decision-making roles, and within SNCC you’re talking about the same. 
EC: At this point, I know SNCC has the project in Lowndes, and some of the other 
nearby countries in the Alabama black belt. What other projects, what other sort of 
organizing or fieldwork is going on at this time? Do you have a sense? 
JL: Fm not quite sure how strong the fieldwork is in some of the places at that point 
because you have these people who I associate as being very much a part of SNCC. The, 
so southwest Georgia, and then you have Cambridge, Gloria Richardson. You have these 
people in all of these different places, but that Fm not, I don’t have a real visceral sense, 
[3:35:00] I can’t tell you what the goals were and what we were actually doing in these 
different places. And partly that’s because during that same time period, things began to 
shift towards black power and the media focus on black power, which was also this turn 
towards Stokely. And as the turn towards Stokely occurred, you were beginning to have 
the emergence of the Black Panther Party. And these questions about what role does 
SNCC have, what connection does it want, should it have, with some of those groups. 
There was a group in Philadelphia, I don’t know the formal name of the group but I know 
there was a group of militants, black militants from Philadelphia who were seeking a 
relationship with SNCC and—. 
EC: Yeah. We talked a little bit about your work with MACE and with the National 
Council of Negro Women. Were there other things about that work that we should 
discuss? 
Jennifer Lawson 
105 
JL: By the time that I was working with them, Unita Blackwell had become the 
mayor of Mayersville, Mississippi. And it was, and you also had, there was a group of 
people unconnected to SNCC in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. And these groupings were 
making me, were raising the question. These activities were raising the question for me 
of, what next, in a sense. What is the more meaningful work that we should be doing? 
Because I felt that there was a kind of incrementalism that was similar to that feeling that 
I’d had when Fd encountered the doctor at Sloan Kettering who had been working twenty 
years, and—. 
EC: Got this one little? 
JL: And got this one little thing. And that’s what I kept feeling, that, “Well, okay, 
Unita Blackwell is mayor or Mayersville, Mrs. Hamer is trying to get an economic 
development project for Ruleville, Sunflower County, and MACE, here are these little 
pockets of things. What does it add up to? And does it add up to something of real 
significance in that way? Now, mind you, also you had, in the same sort of, this same 
world, let’s not forget that there’s Martin Luther King and his work, let’s not forget that 
there’s Malcolm X, and you also have the questions and issues about the international 
scene. Andlhad, in—. I think it was nineteen—. I’d have to find out what year. One 
year when I was working out of Atlanta, I had been asked to go to represent SNCC in 
Cuba as an artist. I was, they were having a world congress of the arts and Bob Fletcher, 
Willie Ricks, Ralph Featherstone, Chico Neblett, I think, and I went to Havana. And we 
went through Mexico City, and I recall being in Mexico City for New Years of that year, 
but I want to think this was around 1966 or so, but. 
Jennifer Lawson 
106 
EC: Was Stokely in Cuba at the same time? He made a trip to Cuba and I don’t know 
if it was the same event or something different—. 
JL: I don’t think he was. I don’t think so, yeah, I don’t think so. I don’t think—. 
Yeah. 
EC: Okay. Yeah. Do you know h—. Were you chosen because of the artwork you 
did in Lowndes? 
JL: That’s what I was technically being chosen because of my, you know, work as an 
artist, but when you’d think about it, that doesn’t—. What was Ricks chosen for? 
[3:40:00] [Laughter] 
EC: Well, I was wondering. I mean, you know, Neblett was a singer, right? 
JL: R-ight, exactly. 
EC: But-. 
JL: But, you know, Featherstone and Ricks—. Ah, you know. What. So, and Bob 
Fletcher was a photographer, yes. 
EC: Photographer. Yeah. I was wondering who I’d forgotten—. 
JL: But we never had to show our wares, so to speak, there. But at that point, though, 
I met people from all over the world, and met people from Tanzania, from Mozambique, 
and from other countries. And to talk with them and to hear about their struggles, was 
and eye-opener and also to experience, firsthand, Cuba after its revolution. And what 
was striking to me was to sort of wander around Havana—because I did a lot of 
wandering around when we weren’t in the meetings, and I skipped a few meetings to just 
go wandering. 
EC: Did you have good Spanish? 
Jennifer Lawson 
107 
JL: No, none at all. Nil. But that I ended up meeting a group of dissident Cubans 
who were, who wanted to talk about blackness and the issues related to race, because 
they felt that the Cuban revolution, while it had addressed issues related to economic 
equality and inequality, and helped improve the lives of the poorest people there, that it 
was killing black culture. And that it was institutionalizing, it was requiring, they had 
made it illegal to perform certain—. The Santería and certain African rituals and 
everything, outside of the context of the folkloric institute. And that Castro had made 
some, like a grand speech about, “You don’t have to celebrate your Africanness or 
anything because we are all Africans, all of us here on Cuba, we’re one people and we’re 
all Africans and that, you know, we’ll—. So we’ll have the folkloric institute, and that—. 
EC: Since we’re all Africans, we can’t all perform the, participate in the—. [Laughter] 
JL: And that it was divisive and separating people to talk about these things of using 
other, the language of the Santería, and to talk about those cultural remnants, and those 
cultural remnants needed to disappear, we, that they needed to be allowed to fade in order 
to have a new Cuba of the future. Yeah. So this group of people were upset about that, 
and they would want to—. And here I am, I’m just as crazy as a loon, and I got out and 
they sort of meet us at the, what was it. There was an old amusement park, and they were 
sort of saying, “At midnight nobody’s there, meet us there.” [Laughter] 
EC : And there you were. 
JL: And so, and they would, you know, I went to their homes and everything. There 
was, one of them was this woman who has since died, but she became one of, she was 
perhaps the leading filmmaker of African descent of Cuba, and that she made at least, 
made two or three films and—. 
Jennifer Lawson 
108 
EC: Were you able to stay in touch? 
JL: Not for long. I did for a while, but not for long. And then she became, she died 
of something, like, really, you know one of these awful things where it’s like an asthma 
attack or something. But I remember, too, I participated on a TV program with Hydée 
Santamaría, who was one of the heroes of the Cuban revolution, she was one of the few 
women, one of the key women participants, and they had us on some local, on a Cuban 
TV program, and that she sort of disparagingly says to me—I had an afro—and she sort of 
says, “The nice thing is that here, we in Cuba, we can be free and so, and we can be free 
to be beautiful, too. So we don’t have to wear our hair—.” [3:35:00] 
EC: Sounds like Cuba was an interesting experience. 
JL: Yes, yes. 
EC: So you can be beautiful, huh? 
JL: And that I then was on this program, trying to explain to her that this is, for us, 
this is beauty. And that’s the reason that I’m wearing my hair like this, to make the point 
that my hair, this is its natural state and that, in its natural state, it is beauty as well. And 
then she says, “On, but no. See, I can, if I want to, I can be blonde and so I’m blonde 
now, and I—.” So it was. Yeah. 
EC: No connection. 
JL: And then it was also something where here, it would have been one of these 
things where it would have been, it was rather outrageous because then she also said—. 
And, you know, we have, my, we don’t have to, we are free and we don’t have to do 
these things. And so it was like she had some friend and stuff, and she could call her 
Mimi Grito, you know? 
Jennifer Lawson 
109 
EC: Oh, no! 
JL: Yeah. So it was just awful. 
EC : So that’s the revolutionaries? 
JL: And that’s the revolutionary, that’s this revolutionary woman that—. It was like, 
ugh. So I felt I understood and could identify with what they were talking about, about 
the racism and these remnants of racism that existed in Cuba, but it was enlightening to 
me but nothing that I could do with it, really. Or do about it or anything. But—. And I 
kept in touch with them for a while, but you know, eventually lost touch with people, 
yeah. 
EC: Difficult to do, yeah. Are there oth—. 
JE: I kept in touch with a Tanzanian man that I met there. And we, for many years, 
were like pen pals, and then when I moved to Tanzania, he was a part of the, this writers’ 
group that I was talking about, with Walter Rodney. 
EC: What was it like being in a writers’ group with Walter Rodney? 
JL: Oh, it was incredible. And again, it was one of those things where I was honored 
that—. I was the only woman in that group as well, but I didn’t think of—. You know, 
these are things where, when they’re happening, I’m not thinking about, “Oh, well I’m 
the only woman in the group.” But it was more how we had formed the group, of being 
sort of serious. We were having discussions. I had met them, and we started talking and 
had met to talk about, “How could we, then, create literature and create material for our 
people? That, you know, why is it that we’re always waiting for someone else to do this? 
And why shouldn’t we do this ourselves?” And this had come out of my, you know, I’m 
Jennifer Lawson 
110 
post-Drum and Spear, and so, and Walter Rodney, then, was talking. He had done his 
book, his--. 
EC: How Europe—. 
JL: Developed Afinca, and was talking about other things that he felt that he could and 
should do, and so we were, in essence, talking about why don’t we, then, create these 
works and publish them? And so that was the basis of our discussion, yeah. 
EC: Yeah. So were you working on any particular—. 
JL: Agreed to be sort of a historical—. He was working on a history, a book of 
history, but that he was also, had agreed to be the sort of historian for the group. 
EC: So that he would pro—. Help with the context, and whatever ( )? 
JL: Exactly, exactly, yeah. And that Ayi Kwei Armah was working on the book that 
he published, I—, I think it was The Healers. His novel, The Healers, and the other guy, 
Grant, I don’t think he, I don’t know of him having published anything. But it was 
really—. It was a very good experience, to work with them. And Walter was, you know, 
they were all really just, I mean, Ayi Kwei Armah is brilliant, Walter is brilliant. I mean, 
just really first-rate people, really keen and you know, intellectuals. And really good 
discussions about the notion of—which I still believe—which is, don’t wait for somebody 
else to do it for you, don’t spend the time whining and complaining, but do it. You 
know? 
EC: Is this, this is in the [19]70s? 
JL: This was 19—, I was in Tanzania from 1970 to 1972. 
EC: And you said this is post-Drum and Spear? Can you say something about your 
work with Drum and Spear? 
Jennifer Lawson 
111 
JL: Sure. In the late—. In sort of that 1968 to 1970 period, that there was a point, one 
point [3:50:00] where I was doing the Quitman County work and then there was another 
when I moved here, to Washington, DC, to work with SNCC people who had—. Former 
SNCC people who had, by that time, by this point, moved here to Washington and were 
beginning to talk about what would be Pan-Africanism and what you could create to sort 
of spread the knowledge about people of color, and to connect the African world with the 
African American world. And so Courtland, Charlie, and then there were some other 
people who were relatively, they weren’t old SNCC people but they were political 
activists. Jimmy Garrett, Howard Fuller, Owusu, he later became—and a number of other 
people who had coalesced here, not very far from here, and that—. This looks like I, my 
husband is coming, too, we’ll probably get an interruption at the door, just a warning 
that—. 
EC: Should we just take a break now? 
Ml: We can keep going. ( ). 
JL: We can keep—. It’ll, I think weTl—. Yeah. And F11 be happy to repeat wherever 
we are. But there were, back in, at that point, a number of people—. Courtland, Charlie, 
and others—. Had gathered here and were beginning to have discussions about what 
culturally one could do to create change, and to strengthen the African American 
community. And one approach to it was, to connect to the African world and, through 
Pan-Africanism. And there was a C. L. R. James, the historian, was living here at the 
time, and there was the notion that perhaps one could, we could play a role in hosting and 
helping to craft the next Pan-African Congress, and that the Tanzanian government had 
said that they would be, they would host the conference in Tanzania, and that—. So as a 
Jennifer Lawson 
112 
preliminary to that, then, Charlie, Courtland moved to Tanzania for a short period of 
time, and then ended up, Court—. Charlie actually remained there and lived there for a 
few years. Here, we then, I came here, I moved here, and became the art director for the 
publishing company, Drum and Spear Press, and then worked also to help with the 
bookstore. And I would, I did, again, the art direction and design for the bookstore. 
Tony, my husband—. Tony Giddens, then, was the manager for Drum and Spear 
Bookstore. Ann and Marvin Holloway were also a part of this group, and that, we had an 
overarching sort of holding company, and board of directors, and that was called Afro- 
American Resources. 
EC: What are some of the things that you would do as the art director? 
JL: I designed the book covers and the typography, would design and decide the 
typography and the style of the books. And that they asked for me to do the interior 
design for the bookstore, as well. And so, and I did everything from the shopping—, I 
was very proud of my design for the shopping bags for the bookstore. 
EC: Oh yeah, what did they look like? 
JL: They had a, it was sort of a stylized but distinctly African face on one side, and 
then the symbol of the Drum and Spear on the other side. 
EC: What was it like to work with the bookstore and the press, what was, what were 
you trying to accomplish and what was the energy? 
JL: Oh, the energy was, it was—. All of these places were, and all of this work, has 
always been filled with purpose, with a sense of purpose and mission. And it’s, to me, 
great when you have a group of people where you share that sense of purpose and you 
share a vision, and then you’re driven. It’s, there’s never enough time in a day to get the 
Jennifer Lawson 
113 
work done. Because they’re, [3:55:00] you can see how much needs to be done. And so 
you’re always energized and you’re always sort of pushing to get the next thing done and 
to have the next thing happen. We also were doing work with radio, and that’s where 
Kojo Nnamdi, who has, currently has a radio program here in Washington, that we had a 
news program, a children’s radio show, and we were doing, decided that we would do 
both books for adults as well as children, and that I worked with Courtland and with 
Daphne Mews to design a book, and then I illustrated a book called Children of Afinca as 
a children’s book, and that we later did a version of that in Tanzania, at the request of the 
Tanzanian government, we did a version of that in Kiswahili. 
EC: That must have been exciting. 
JL: It was. And I was asked by the Tanzanians, I was asked by a publishing company 
there to remain there to take on a three-year project, illustrating the English-Swahili 
dictionary. 
EC: Did you? 
JE: No. I—. And I didn’t because I was, I had decided, at that point, that I wanted to, 
because I was now making my living, so to speak, as an artist, I wanted to actually study 
art formally. You know, you can see how this had been something that I was just doing 
because there was a need and I did it, but I had never had any training and I wanted the 
things to be better than they were. And so I felt that it was time to then study. But now, I 
would study art—. And but I was also writing, and so I thought, “Oh, well I should study 
writing, and I couldn’t’ quite make up my mind which I would study, and that’s when I 
was coming, and I was going to apply to different universities and places around the 
country, and that’s how I ended up, then, at Columbia, studying film. Because I thought 
Jennifer Lawson 
114 
film would bring together all of this, and that I still had the concern about literacy and 
about the fact that we had been working on books. And books for talking about 
publishing books in Africa. You know, when there’s still so much, when we were talking 
about such large populations where the literacy rate was so low that why are we talking 
about books? Is that just because that’s what we are familiar with rather than taking 
advantage of audiovisual media? 
[Recorder is turned off and then back on] EC: You were talking about going to film 
school at Columbia, and I started to ask if you were aware that some SNCC folks had 
worked with film as a way of working with community people who weren’t very 
proficient with literacy. Were you, did you know about that? 
JL: No, I didn’t. 
EC: That’s interesting, yeah. So you were saying that you couldn’t decide between art 
and writing, and then were also concerned about illiteracy, and—. 
JL: And that’s what led me towards film. 
EC: Toward film. And I wondered if you could talk about that, but also sort of how 
your experiences in the movement have shaped the direction of your work life, and things 
that you’ve been involved in since? 
JL: Well, I—. Working in the civil rights movement, there were always these 
moments where I felt that you were being, that the circumstances would require that you 
stare at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, “Are you doing the right thing? Are you 
doing something to address some of the problems that are, that we are facing? What are 
you doing?” I never wanted to be a person who would then tell my child that, “Yes, oh, 
things were awful and I’m sorry I didn’t do anything, that this is the world that we have.” 
Jennifer Lawson 
115 
And that I always wanted to feel that I had done what I could, in trying to make a 
difference. And when I looked at, as I moved through the years, I really felt that part of 
what was a sort of unifying theme in all of this was education. That we were really trying 
to make sure that people were well-informed, that people had the facts about the world, 
whether it was drawing the little Mr. Blackman, and here’s what the coroner does, and 
here’s what the sheriff does, or whether it was the billboard that says, “Vote for the black 
panther,” and go—. That is trying to provide useful information to people, and that led 
me towards social documentary, [4:00:00] which then led me towards public television, 
and so I’m very fortunate that I’ve had a career of over thirty years, working in public 
broadcasting both as a filmmaker as well as an administrator. And that it is, I’d like to 
think, consistent with my work in civil rights, that when I believe that public 
broadcasting, when we work to provide kids with programs for, that are available, that 
are educational programs that are available to all the children of the country regardless of 
income or background, that that’s consistent with the kind of thing that I was attempting 
to do in Lowndes County as well, or in Quitman County. And to—. When I see the same 
kind of reactions that I felt back then, when I took so much pride in helping someone in 
Quitman County learn to read, that now, when I sometimes run into someone and they 
find that I work in public television, and they then say, “Oh, I am so—, I learned this 
from public television, I became—. I was inspired to do this because of programs that I 
saw on public television.” 
EC: This is actually backtracking a little, but you talked about coming to DC and in 
essence, reconnecting with many, or continuing your connection with many SNCC folks, 
Jennifer Lawson 
116 
and then joining, working with other political activists. Do you have a sense of why so 
many SNCC folks landed in DC? 
JL: I think it was—, I think that DC is, particularly for the time that we were talking 
about, DC was a perfect place because we were, we had questions about how do we 
connect the struggles of our people with those, and to the people of Africa, and a feeling 
that if you don’t eradicate the kind of racism that exists towards Africa, Africans, and 
people of the—. What was then called the third world, the developing world, that you, all 
of these problems will continue, that you don’t deal with them in isolation, you need to 
connect the dots, they are one and the same, they should be connected. And Washington 
is a logical place for that, given the embassies, given the number of people who are here. 
Howard University and the University of DC had international scholars here, you know, 
as I mentioned, there was, there were people like C. L. R. James, the historian, who was 
here. You had people who would come through here, or were here, like Walter Rodney. 
And so it became a very useful place, and, I think, a kind of logical place at that 
particular time. And once you get a critical mass of people, then it becomes a 
community. And so Ralph Featherstone, just a whole—. Ivanhoe Donaldson, a host of 
people then were residing here. And we then would keep in touch socially, but many of 
us also worked together with Drum and Spear, in creating Drum and Spear. 
EC: What do you want people to know about the Civil Rights Movement? What’s 
important about it? 
JL: I think it is—. I think it’s important for people to know that the Civil Rights 
Movement, as it’s defined in terms of that time period and its work, was a very important 
step in the history of this country, and in the development of this country. And that were 
Jennifer Lawson 
117 
it not for the work of the Civil Rights Movement, I think that, I don’t think that the 
United States would be as cohesive as it is now. That’s not to say that it is, you know, 
cohesive, but I think that we were, would have had a much more fractured and possibly 
destroyed nation, that the riots after Martin Luther King’s death, the riots in Watts, and 
places like that, I think that all of those places would have been far more - the 
devastation would have been far greater and it would, the differences between those with 
wealth and without, those of [4:05:00] difference races, would have been far, far worse 
and far more divided if we had not had the Civil Rights Movement to give a sense of 
possibility and hope. And that’s what I think that the movement has contributed. And I 
think that there are threads of it that continued through to date, and will continue into the 
future. And that—. What we did during the movement, was built on the basis of what 
others had done before us as well, so it’s part of a continuum but I do think that what 
happened in those particular years was incredibly important in avoiding the complete— 
EC: Fracturing? 
JL: —fracturing of the United States. 
EC: Can you say anything about your work with the SNCC Legacy Project, what that 
is and your involvement? 
JL: Sure. One of the—. I worked as a volunteer with the SNCC Legacy Project, and 
that is work that a group of us who were SNCC veterans do to try to make sense of that 
work, in the same way that you’re, with your very good, excellent question about what 
does it all mean, that we’re trying to really translate that into a language that others can 
understand, and that we’ll know what we did, and have the facts of that work. We want 
to record that, we want to preserve that, we want to preserve the documentation of those 
Jennifer Lawson 
118 
years and of that work. And so that’s part of what the Legacy Project does. Another part 
of it that’s very important is, meeting with young people. And because I think that 
there’s a kind of romanticism that, “Oh well, I wish I had lived in that time period, we 
could have dealt with our problems differently.” But it’s, to try to help young people 
understand the reality of that time period and how it connects to today and what they’re 
doing, and the importance of what they are doing today, in trying to make a difference, in 
changing their world and changing this world. So that’s another important aspect of it. 
And finally, the, we also, there are many people who, when we talk about being veterans 
of the Civil Rights Movement, I think that it truly is like veterans of a war, and there are 
some people who were present when other people were killed, and who were themselves 
beaten and tortured, and so it’s a rather—. They’ve gone through horrible experiences and 
some of them have not come out whole from it. I mean, you have people who, 
sometimes, have been in near-homelessness or who have died with, you know, where 
their families don’t even have the money to bury them, and that, as a group, then, the 
Legacy Project has also been, then, a resource where we can then come together to help 
their families and to help them. 
EC: We really appreciate the interview. Do you have any final thoughts, or should we 
close on that note? 
JL: I’m very honored to have been asked to do this interview. It’s inspiring to me to 
also try to find the time to gather as much information about my own past as possible, 
because I do think that it’s important to have a good and accurate record of those years. 
And so I’m honored to have been asked, and I do hope that this information is helpful to 
someone, somewhere, at some point. 
Jennifer Lawson 
119 
EC: Thank you, thank you so much. 
JL: No, thank you very much. 
Ml: Very good.
