YOU KNOW HOW IT IS YOURSELF. 
(Song and Dance for Tenor.) 
Written by BOES:Y N EWCW111. 
Composed by JUSTIN JUCIL 
The music of this piece is punished by J. L. PETERS, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
The fairest girl in all the world, 
has oft' been praised in song, 
But all who say they've seen the one, 
I 
tell you must be wrong ; 
The girl I 
love outshines the rest, 
A perfect darling elf, 
I'd like to tell you where she lives, 
But you know how it is yourself. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never can, I 
never will, 
My charmer's name reveal, 
For only those who love like me, 
Can tell just how I 
feel; 
I 
love her for her charms alone, 
And not for gain or wealth, 
Tho' both would suit me just as well, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
The first time that we ever met, 
Was at DtAmonico's, 
She thought that I 
had lots of cash, 
She judged me by my clothes. 
The waiter brought me in a 
bill, 
That wasted all my wealth : 
I 
paid it thonah it sent me broke, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
I 
never can, &c. 
I 
called one day to see my love, 
And quickly rang the bell, 
My charmer she came to the door 
When on Inv knees I 
fell. 
A lengthy tale of love I 
told, 
Quite free fruit thoughts of self, 
Of course I 
won her on the spot, 
For you know how it is yourself. 
I 
never can, (tn. 
(Dance.)

SURELY THE ItrEN ARE TO BLANCH 
Oh, dear, 0 what shall I 
do, 
Sir, I'm an tin  appy lass; 
My lover to me is untrue, 
I'll tell how it all came to pass. 
Oh, I 
started one day for a 
11y, 
To see al the sights at Nahant, 
And while I 
was gone my lover proved false, 
And eloped—eloped with my aunt. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear what a 
shame, 
And why did he leave me alone, 
Surely the men are to blame, 
If ladies o 
flirtite , have gone. 
0 what, 0 
wiutt shall I 
do, 
Will somebody tell me I 
pray ; 
I'll offer the heart and han ,1 
that are true 
To the first man that comes in my way, 
Has any one seen my old beau, 
his looks 1111ry to depict ; 
He squints with his left eye, just so, 
And scowls as if he had Lien licked. 
Oh. he walks with a 
gold headed cane, 
He's lean and as thin as a 
bat, 
And over his carroty fiery- red hair, 
lie wears a 
shocking bad hat. 
0, dear, what a 
shame, die. 
I've advertised over the land, 
To find 
file lover in vain, 
And now I 
have :_iveu him up, 
I 
never shall see him again ; 
Oh, but if he should some time come back, 
I 
t4 11 you I'd 
ive him a 
slant. 
For men are alike, they are prone to elope, 
If only a 
one with their aunt, 
0, dear, what a 
shame, 
.11•• 
'TEE CITY SPORT. 
I suppose you know that l'm just from the city, 
And I 
know all its i.iys and its cares, 
And if you will listen awhile to my ditty, 
I'll tell you how to get out of its snares; 
'Twas once my fate to love a 
lass, 
With all my young heart's power, 
It was the first time we had met, 
As the golden day was o'er; 
I 
loved her then, I 
lore her yet, 
But alas, she's mine no more. 
I 
went to see her one evening in June, 
And my heart was light as a 
fawn's, 
And as I 
neared the house of my darling, 
I 
found she with another had gone. 
But 
not pine for one so false, 
If she has gone and left me : 
I'll forget all my cares and woes, 
And I'll sing merrily, 
rn forget all my cares and woes, 
And I'll s:ng merrily.

BREAD, CHEESE, AND HISSER. 
One night my sweetheart came to woo, 
When I 
left him lonely ; 
Be looked, so kin- 1 
and handsome, too, 
I 
lov'd hint, and, bim only. 
The village chime told supper time, 
What could I 
do, misses ? 
:For, as I 
live, I'd naught to give, 
But bread, arid cheese, and kisses. 
He asked my hand with such a 
grace, 
What woman could refuse him? 
I 
think had you been in my place, 
You'd say : ' twas right to choose him. 
hung my head, and sirrip'rug said, 
'What could I 
say, dear m'sses ? 
I 
will be thine, tho' we should dine, 
On bread, and cheese, and kisses. 
Next rnornin:r we excanged our vow s, 
I 
prize his golden Iresent, 
-Which seems like magic to disclose, 
Each moment something pleasant 
His cheerful smiles each care beguiles, 
Believe me dearest misses, 
'Tis bliss to share with iiim our fare, 
Though br ad, and cheese, and kisses_

SWEET JENNY 
MAT PLAYED THE WELCH HARP. 
My name is Dan Largan, 
Cockolorum, Cock Lane, 
I 
came from Llangofilin, 
A land far away ; 
With my head near turned, 
And my heart full of fear, 
To seek a 
Welch lassie, 
But can't find her here. 
CITORLS. 
Her name it is Jenny, 
So neat and so sharp, 
She came from North Wales, 
And she plays the Welch Harp. 
I 
courted sweet Jenny, 
Six months and three days, 
I 
sat by her side, 
And she paved the sweet lays, 
Till a 
man with a 
banjo 
Came strolling that way, 
He saw my sweet lassie, 
And bore her away. 
Her name it is Jenny, dx. 
I'd told her I 
loi-ed her, 
As true as the stars; 
I 
thought her a 
Venus, 
But she turned out a 
Mars; 
She scattered niv hopes, 
With one single blow, 
She tingles her harp, 
To a 
nasty banjo. 
Her name it is Jenny, &c. 
If ever I 
meet him, 
As sure as the dead. 
I'll smash his old banjo, 
And the crown of his head. 
As for false Jenny, 
I'll leave her to die. 
For leaving Dan Largan, 
The wandering boy. 
Her name it is Jenny, ix. 
CLING TO THOSE WHO CLING TO YOU. 
There are many friends of summer, 
Who are kind while flowers bloom, 
But when winter chills the blossoms, 
They depart with the perfume; 
On the broad highway of action, 
Friends of worth are far and few, 
So when one has proved his friendship. 
Cling to him who clings to you. 
C11011US. 
On the broad highway of action, 
Friends of worth are far and few, 
So when one has proved his friendship, 
Cling to him who clings to you. 
Do not harshly judge your niglibor, 
Do not deem his life untrue, 
If he makes no great pretensions 
Deeds are great though words are few; 
Those who stand amid the tempest, 
Firm as when the skies are blue, 
Will be friends while life endureth, 
Cling to those who cling to you. 
On the broad, ,f41, 
When you see a 
worthy brother, 
Buffeting the stormy main, 
Lend a 
h_dping hand fraternal, 
Till he reach the shore again; 
Don't desert the old and tried friend, 
When misfortune comes in view, 
For he then needs friendship, comfort, 
Cling to those who eiing to you.

THE CHIMES. 
Music by SAM BAC.
..NALL. 
I 
sat me down and wrote a 
song,. 
I 
wrote it 
yell, I 
wrote it long, 
At every line I 
shed a 
tear, 
At every verse I've lost my dear. 
My heart will break and I 
shall die; 
Aria when I 
think it makes me sigh, 
That I 
should love with such a 
love, 
And now I've lost my turtle dove. 
CLIORtS,—She ran away full forty times, 
She loves the wan that plays the chimert. 
Her name was Sarah Susan Jane, 
And don't you think it's quite a 
shame, 
That I 
should pine in such like times, 
Jus,t for a 
man that plays the chimes. 
She's not so tall but very fine, 
She never wore a 
crinoline ; 
Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her mouth is small with teeth so white. 
She ran, fizix. 
She's curly hair, as dark as night; 
Her skin is fair as lilies white ; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing-rose, 
A merry laugh and brazen nose; 
She's rather stout and full of pride, 
And when she walks she takes a 
stride,. 
She swings her arms with such a 
grace, 
As if she'd dash them in your face. 
She ran, gir:. 
I 
decked my hair with violets blue, 
To let you know I 
love her true, 
I 
bound my calves in black and white, 
Because I 
lost my heart's delight; 
My coat I 
changed to cabbage green, 
Which means forsaken by my queen, 
My trousers thus in colors slashed, 
To let you know my heart is smashed. 
She ran, & C,. 
I'll seek some spot where lambkins play, 
And gently breathe may grief away, 
Where little pigs and ducklings quack ; 
You'll find me stretched upon ny back. 
And in my hand a 
carving knife, 
To let you know I 
took my life, 
Through loving one that ne'cr loved me, 
JAI slit toy wind for the love of she. 
She ran,

A 6, 
There's a 
yellow rose in Texas that I 
arn going to see, 
No other darker knows her, no darkey only me ; 
She cried so when I 
left her, it like to broke my heart, 
And if I 
ever find her, we never more will part. 
CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest rose of color this darkey over knew, 
her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew, 
You may talk about your Dearest May, and sing of Rosa Lee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas beats the belles of Tenties8ee. 
Where the Rio Grande is flowing, and the starry skies are 
bright, 
She walks along the river in the .quiet summer night; 
She thinks if I 
remember, when we parted long ago, 
I 
pronds'd to come back again, and not to leave her so. 
She's the sweetest, & c. 
Oh ! now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe, 
And 
we'll sing the song- together, that we sung so long ago; 
We'll play the banjo gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore, 
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more. 
She's the sweetest, &c. 
COME AGAIN SWEET LOVE.

The days are dark, the nights are long, 
Oh I 
how I 
watch for thee! 
The robbiu sing"; a 
cheery song, 
But all in vain for tne; 
But all in vain for me. 
I 
count the weary hours, and sigh: 
A- far thy footsteps rove, 
While summer days are passing by, 
Oh ! conic again sweet love; 
While summer days are passing by, 
Oh I 
come again, sweet lore. 
I 
see thy face in every flew'r, 
Thy name is on the breeze ; 
I 
live again the parting hour 
That bore thee o'er the seas; 
That bore thee o'er the seas; 
Then wander back unto th3- nest, 
Thou truant weary dove ; 
My heart shall be thy home of rest: 
Oh come again, sweet love; 
7sIv heart shall by thy home of rest; 
Oh come again, sweet love,

"I BELIEVE YOU, MY BOY."—NoNcLuDED.] 
The great immortal bard remarked, 
The world is but a 
stage, 
We'll do our best in ey'ry part 
In which we may engage. 
This life is but a 
span, you know, 
Of sorrow and of joy, 
'Tis best to choose the brightest side, 
" 
I 
believe you, my boy." 
Clloans.—I believe you, eze. 
Cheer up, little Chinamen, 
And keep a 
plucky heart, 
And don't let anything upset 
The little apple-cart. 
Upon the stormy road of life, 
With danger never toy, 
But elevate your pecker, 
"I believe you, my boy." 
Ottoaus.—I believe you, & c. 
When friends suggest that I 
should join 
Them in a 
friendly drain, 
I 
don't object, but merely hint 
Aly weakness is champagne. 
Although a 
modest, bashful man, 
And very shy and coy, 
I 
think I 
know what's proper, 
" 
I 
believe you, my boy." 
Cuoaus.--1 believe you, ite. 
Then send your sister and your wife, 
Your uncle and your aunt, 
Likewise your grandmamma to hear 
This pretty little chaunt. 
Good little boys and little girls, 
-Should anything annoy, 
I'll put you in good humor, 
"I believe you, my boy." 
Cuoans.—I li•elieve you, &e.

FOLLOW ME IF YOU DARE. 
I 
saw her first at Brown's great race, 
Held at the Skating rink, 
And as I 
met her face to face, 
She gave me such a 
wink; 
I 
really felt a 
sudden pang, 
Right through my heart of hearts, 
As though I 
had been shot kerbang, 
With One of Cupid's darts, 
CHORUS. 
The glance I 
gave, she did receive, 
With the most bewitching air, 
Then turned about, and took French leave, 
With a" Follow me, if you dare." 
I 
met her next at R.ussel's store, 
She knew me at a 
glance, 
And as she winked at me before, 
I 
said now is my eh nee ; 
To catch tlds charming fair haired girl. 
And take her out to dine, 
To vow I 
love her flaunting- curls, 
And ask her to be mine. 
But. when I 
touched Ler on the sleeve, 
She smiled with a 
eli-rming air, 
And slangily turned, and toi.k French leave. 
'With a Follow me if you dare." 
The g.ance I 
gave, & c. 
I 
caught, her walking Tremont street, 
My glance she quickly met, 
I 
turned about in au odd way, 
An interview to get; 
Iii 
FPLLOW ME IF YOU DARE . [CONCLUDED] 
But she kept on, though once or twice, 
She turned and smiled at me, 
Who really thought it very nice, 
To follow her home to tea; 
My anxious heart she could relieve, 
If for me she had a 
care, 
But a 
smile was all, and a 
French leave, 
With a ‘. Follow me, if you dare." 
The glance I 
gave, &c 
She reached her home, and at the door, 
She turned and winked at me, 
What I 
supposed meant something more, 
So I 
followed her in to see; 
Tier husband met me in the hall, 
He saw my little game, 
For suddenly I 
felt a 
fall, 
Which sent me home quite lame. 
Look out for her, she will deceive, 
This girl with the golden hair ; 
She flirts awhile, then takes French leave, 
With a " Follow me, if you dare,' 
The glance I 
gave,&c. 
The moral of my song is this, 
To it let all take heed, 
When you are searching after bliss, 
And find just what you need. 
Be sure the charming girl you seek, 
Whose curls you so admire, 
Does not with all her smiles so meek, 
With a 
husband thus conspire. 
For this is now the style, believe, 
Of the girls with the golden hair; 
They lure you on, they take French leave, 
With a " Follow me, if you dare." 
The glance I 
gave, (to.

LITTLE " OP3Y Willi 2±. SQUEAK. 
Now, fill yon good people pray attention, 
While I 
illustrate to you a 
fact ; 
A 
life like mine's to precari ous, 
Depending very much, you'll see, on tact. 
have a 
little something here to please you, 
A 
novelty to introduce 
try, 
In my lively and elastic little Topsy, 
If any one will favor rue and buy. 
Performs with the elastic Topsy 
CIIORI:S. 
Will you buy a 
little Topsy, with a 
squeak, squeak. squeak, 
Pull her for a 
week, she'll squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Buy a 
little Topsy, with a 
squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Pretty little Topsy, with a 
squeak. 
A very strange coincidence I'll give you, 
In connection with this funny little toy ; 
The way in which it acted most instantly, 
Upen a 
very naulity little boy 
Nothing could arouse his sullen temper, 
his appearance and his manner they were bad, 
By chance, one day, he brought a 
little Topsy. 
He laughed so much, he's now a 
different lad. 
Will you buy a 
little, &e. 
A similar occurence I 
could mention, 
The good effects of laughing into fits; 
A lady called upon me one fine morning, 
I 
understood her age was ninety-six. 
She suffered from rheumatics, indigestin, 
Dyspepsia, and bile for many a 
week : 
I 
cured her—for she laughed for thirty hours, 
When I 
showed her little Topsy with a 
squeak. 
Will you buy a 
little, dz.e: 
I 
think I 
smell a 
bobby round the corner. 
The street act will no longer let me stop; 
Its Saturday, and all 
he shops are closing, 
I've yet to get my " toggeries" out of " pop." 
Now if you think ray song has been amusing, 
Don't any of you be afraid to speak, 
But if you kindly promise to applaud it, 
I'll present you with a 
Topsy with a 
squeak. 
Will you buy a 
little, & e. 
WALKING THROUGH THE COBIXON. 
Walking thro' the Common 
On one summer's day, 
I 
met a 
fair haired maiden, 
Dress'd so neat and gay. 
I 
stepp'd up close beside her, 
She at once did catch my eye, 
And when I 
asked to meet her, 
She gave me such a 
sigh. 
Walki g 
thro' the Common, 
On one summer's day, 
I 
met this fair haired maiden, 
Dress'd so neat and gay. 
She is not so handsome, 
But then she's so genteel, 
She sports a 
pretty gaiter boot, 
And such a 
splendid heel. 
I'm always sure to meet her, 
11,Thene'er I 
pass: that way, 
This pretty fair haired maiden, 
Dress'd so neat and gay. 
Walking thro' the Common, &e. 
The next time that I 
met her, 
A chap stood by her side, 
And when I 
saw his ugly look, 
thought it best to hide ; 
She explaine I 
to me his presence 
In a 
satisfactory way, 
Did that pretty fair haired maiden. 
That dress'd so neat and gay. 
Walking thro' the Common, ke. 
But before I 
had half time to speak, 
This fellow at me flow, 
lie must have been excited, 
lie beat me black and blue ; 
I 
care no more about her, 
I've not seen her since that day, 
That pretty f haired maiden, 
That dress'd Si) neat and gay.

There's a

She's the sweetest one I've seen, 
And with such roguish, winning ways, 
Her age is just sixteen! oh;

A ROGUISH BOY IS LOCE. 
Sad and sweet is love / 
What so sad and sweet ? 
Mingled smiles and tears 
Make our lives complete. 
Love is either sighing, 
Pining, almost dying, 
Or he's gaily smiling, 
Merry hours beguiling. 
Hey ho! Hey ho! very sad and sweet is love. 
Hey ho ! Hey ho! a 
roguish boy is love. 
When we seek the boy, 
lie is sure to fly, 
When we bid him go, 
Then he lingers nigh ! 
Ever more perplexing, 
Puzzling, too, and vexing, 
Who would care about him, 
Could we do \without him? 
Hearts go pitapat, 
When he wanders near, 
When he speeds away ; 
Don't we sigh and fear, 
Pouting and coquetting-, 
into mi-zeldef getting, 
Oh ! this naughty Cupid, 
Makes a 
body stupid ! 
Hey ho! Sz.c. 
Hey he, Ate,

WILL SHE LET MP. KISS HER ? 
When sitting by my darling's side, 
She promised soon to be my bride; 
With smiles that nearly set me 
In ectacies they were so sweet, 
My heart began to pant and beat, 
I 
whispered will she let me kiss her ? 
Will she let me, will she let me kiss her ? 
I 
quick encircled with my arm, 
her waist ( now sure I 
meant no harm 
To her who oft did pet me,) 
She tried to get herself away, 
She smiled and frowned yet looked so gay, 
That I 
nonplussed for what to say, 
Just murmured will she let me kiss her ? 
Will she let me, will she let me kiss her ? 
I 
gazed within her love.lit eye, 
Whose drooping lAsIsts made me sigh, 
Can eyes so pure ferget me?" 
0, no, they never etot, for they, 
In every glance do ma* to say, 
"For thee I 
live, for thee I 
pray?" 
Then surely file trill let me kiss her L • 
Surely let me, yes, she'll let me kiss her 
Enraptured at my own request, 
She dropped her head upon my breast 
And made such thoughts beset me, 
That I 
bewildered, plunged in bliss, 
Sighed " Surely there is heaven in this,": 
And here I 
stole a 
long sweet kiss, 
And found edag! She'd let inc kiss her I 
Yes she let me, truly, fondly kiss her]

sorrowful tale, 
And if you've a

Where one day picket duty he tried, 
He was bit by an orful muskeeteer, 
He swelled up, then bursted and died, 
Far away froa. this damsel called Sally. 
For Reiley every night she would mourn, 
She in Thomas Street lived in an alley. 
This purty gal selling hot corn. 
Every morning she'd sit in the alley 
Where she used for to sigh and to sob 
Till a 
hot corn she tried for to swallow, 
But she choked herself dead with the cob, 
That's the last of the damsel called Sally, 
For Reiley had left her forlorn,

SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER 
The ladies now have something new, 
'Tis strange, I 
do declare: 
This time ' tis not a 
hat or dress, 
Or fixings for the hair. 
But as they walk the streets in robes, 
• 
Which every color blend; 
They have a 
way of stooping so, 
And call it " Grecian Bend." 
ettortus.—Oh, what will fashion bring us to, 
And where will folly end, 
" 
When lovely woman stoops" to walk 
" 
A la the Grecian Bend." 
I 
saw my girl one afternoon, 
And to my great surprise: 
She walked just like a 
kangaroo, 
With pepper in its eyes. 
Says I " my love, pray what is wrong, 
Can I 
assistance lend ;" 
66 Go way," says she, 
why don't you see, 
I've got the Grecian Bend." 
Oh what will, ;lc. 
I 
asked her once with me to come, 
And ride out for a 
While ; 
"Oh no," said she, " I'd rather walk, 
And show the latest style." 
Says I, my pretty darling dear, 
I 
beg you as a 
friend ; 
Hold up your head and show some sense, 
And stop your " Grecian Bend." 
Oh what will, & c. 
"I'll walk just as I 
like," she said, 
" 
And there tne matter ends; 
I 
must in fishion be, you know, 
TholIgh I 
should lose my friends. 
And if you do not like lay style, 
Our love is at an end.' 
And so I 
lost the sweetest girl, 
All by the " Grecian Bend." 
Oh what will, arc.

THE STANDARD WATCH. 
SHE TURNED OUT A CRUEL DECEIVER. 
Where floats the standard o'er the tented field, 
His lonely watch the minstrel knight is keeping; 
And thus beguiles the time with tuneful strain, 
His silver lute with mailed fingers sweeping; 
The lady of my love I 
may not name, 
I 
dare not hope my love can be requited, 
ret I 
will light for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the banner where my vows We.rC plighted. 
Beneath the banner where my vows were plighted.. 
The night is gone, the battle comes with day, 
Behold the bard, surrounding foes defying; 
Red carnage marks his presence in the fray, 
While still he sings amid the dead and dying! 
The lady of toy love I 
may not name, 
I 
dare not hope my love can be requited; 
Then let me die for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the banner where my vows were plighted, 
Beneizprthe banner where my vows were plighted. 
The fight is won, death sated quits the field, 
Yet still the faithful bard while life is fleeting; 
Expiring lies upon his gory shield, 
This dying note with feeble voice repeating: 
The lady of my love I 
dare not name, 
In lleav'n above we yet may be united, 
I 
fought and fell for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the banner where my vows were plighted, 
Beneath the banner where my vows were plighted. 
I 
will now then my troubles unfold, 
You !Dust know I've been sold ; 
And I'm sure when my story is told, 
Badly treated I've been you wW.

Ily a 
cook who was called Saraltane, 
Sarah Jane, was her name; 
But I 
hope I'll Ile'er see her again, 
Bootle- turn, tootle- turn. tay. 
clIORUS. 
Th011711 I 
vowed I 
never would leave her, 
She turned out a 
cruel deceiver. 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn, tay. 
Now I 
met this cook first in the park, 
Central park, just near dark ; 
And I 
ventured to make a 
remark, 
That it was a 
very cool day. 
She answered me not at fin hold, 
That it was— very cola; 
her name and address she then told, 
houtle-tutu, 
tay. 
TImugh I 
vowed, & c. 
Sarah Jane was a 
frisky young maid, 
And good wages was paid ; 
And at the tine house where she staid 
I 
called on her 'most every (lay. 
But one evening she drove Inc quite mad, 
Yes, quite mad, 't 
was too bad ; 
A Dutch barber beside her she had, 
Rootle-turn, tootle- turn tay. 
Thoup,11 T 
vowed, Sw. 
"Mister Dutchman," says I, " this looks queer, 
Sitting here, drinking beer; 
hut you :tint got no bizness down here, 
So listen to what I 
new say. 
If I 
catch you again here, forsooth, 
it's the truth, though uncouth, 
I 
will darken your eyes, my sweet youth!" 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Though I 
vowed, &c. 
" 
Now," said he, " vy do you interfere, 
Mit us here, o'er our peer; 
I've as mu h 
right as you to pe lie , e, 
Um' I'll leave it to Sarar to say." 
" 
Now, then Miss, your alnctions I'll test— 
Do not jest, I 
protest." 
And the barber she vowed she loved best, 
Rootle-tutu, tootle-tum tay. 
Though I 
vowed, & a. 
That she loved me I 
firmly believed, 
But how soon was deceived ; 
Though it's no use me now being grieved, 
For he married and took her away. 
I 
wish him mu - h joy of this belle, 
What a

PRETTY LITTLE DEAR.

T'was at a

She was dancing a

But of all the gals that e'er was Iiiere. my chartney was the belle,

Now she's gone away, but where T

With her ruby lips and golden hair. that hullo- all round in curls

LOVE'S REQUEST. 
Now the day is slowly waning, 
Evening, breezes softly moan, 
NYilt thou tie em' heed my complaining, 
Canst thou leave me thus alone. 
CII0111.7S. 
Stay with me, may darling, stay, 
And like a 
dream thy life shall pass away, 
Stay witm Tile, mliv darling, stay, 
And like a

Like a

Canst thou thus unmoved behold me, 
Still untouched by love so deep 
Nay, thine arms more closely fold me, 
And thine eyes begin to weep. 
Stay with me then, darling, (tc. 
Oh! I 
have got a 
charming bride, 
And with my life I'm satisfied, 
She's warthy all the world beside, (

And so is Mrs. Johnson. 
The life I 
lead is very gay, 
I'm 'bout the town near all the day, 
And generally at ten-pins play, (Mc) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson 
At acting I 
can do the 'trick, 
Othello, Hamlet or King Dick, 
I 
play them all just like a 
brick, (

And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
At sea I'll manage any craft, 
And keep things ship-shape fore-and aft, 
I'm a 
first-rate b'hoy to steer a 
raft, (
hic) 
And so is Mrs. Johnson. 
In legal matters I'm no fudge, 
And can give any here a 
nudge, 
I 
expect soon to be made a 
judge, (Mc) 
And so does Mrs Johnson. 
To every fire of course I 
goes, 
And all the companies I 
knows, 
I 
run with engines and with hose, (Mc) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
But lor, you should just see me box, 
One blow of mine would fell an OIX; 
Oh, I 
fetches ' ern some precious knocks, [Mc] 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
But we've tasted deep of wedlock's joys, 
And I 
never mind the darling's noise. 
l'm always round with all the boys, [Mc] 
And so is Mrs. Johnsan. 
My brain I 
feel is far from right, 
If I've not satisfied you quite, 
I'll drop in some other night, [Mc] 
And so will Mrs. Johnson.

NAE SHOON TO HIED HER TINY TAES. 
Nae shoot] to hide her tiny taes, 
Nae stockings on her feet ; 
Her supple ankles white as snaw, 
Of early blossoms sweet. 
Her simple dress o' sprinkled pink, 
Iler double dimpled chin, 
Her puckered lip an' hatnny ram% 
nil ane tooth between. 
Her puel-rad lip an' baumy 
WI' Mt aliti tooth between. 
Her ten sae like her nailer's een, 
Twa gentle liquid things, 
Her face is like an angel's face, 
We're glad she has nae wings, 
She is the budding o our love, 
A 
giftie God gied us, 
"We 111MIMa love the gift o'erweell, 
'Twad be lute blessing thus, 
We munna love the gift o'erweel, 
'Twad be nae bkssing thus. 
There was a 
time I 
fondly loved, 
A young girl bright and fair ; 
The sunbeams sported in her eyes, 
And glistened in her hair; 
She was my star—my life—my all— 
I 
gloried in my prize ;— 
" 
Where ignorance is bliss" you know, 
"'Tis folly to be wise.'' 
Oh, many a 
pleasant hour I've passed, 
While sitting by her side; 
And oft I 
kissed her ruby lips, 
And wished she were my bride, 
And then l"dreamed her heart so pure, 
Responded back by sighs; 
"lie 
ignorance is bliss" you know, 
""fis lolly to be wise." 
She used to go with me to bails, 
And daily on me smile ; 
While I 
in my sweet innocence, 
Was happy all the while. 
I 
never knew the cousin Tom, 
She seemed so much to prize ;— 
" 
Where ignorance is bliss" you know, 
" 'Tis folly to be wise." 
The truth came out at last one morn, 
My treasure ran away ; 
And, cousin Toni—the horrid scamp, 
Went with her—so they say. 
Alas ! I 
know not where she went, 
For I 
was too surprised,— 
" 
Where ignorance is bliss " you know, 
"'Tis folly to be wise." 
THROUGH THE ,TESSAMINE. 
For one hind xvord or smile ; 
She turn'd her face away from me, 
And answer'd not the while. 
Yet as I 
cross'd the little porch, 
Perplex'd by many a 
doubt, 
I 
saw her through the jessamine, 
Why was she looking out ? 
I 
saw her through the jesamine, 
Why was she looking out? 
I 
pleaded for a 
little rose, 
That nestled in her hair, 
She turn'd away in seeming scorn, 
And left me lonely there; 
Yet as beneath her window sill, 
I 
pa9s'd in dull despair, 
I 
saw the rosebud in the gras 
How had it fallen there? 
I 
saw the rosebud in the r,,rass, 
How had it fallen there ? 
'Tis years ago, her sunny hair 
Is still as brown and bright 
And on her hand a 
little ring 
Is flashing in the light; 
She is my own forevermore, 
And I 
was mad to doubt, 
Since first behind the jessamine, 
I 
saw her looking out ; 
Since first behind the jessamine. 
I 
saw her looking out.

As Sung by ELLA CHAI'MAN. 
I 
have met a 
charmer, she's sweet to gaze upon. 
When at first you ECO her face, you'll feel your heart is gone, 
She wears her dresses " en panier," and sports a

And of all the charming girls in town, she's the sweetest of 
them all, 
CHORUS. 
Oh my ! 
Oh dear! 
You may talk about your pretty girls, the fair, fat, short ang tall, 
But -Nancy Ann Amanda Jane is the sweetest of them all. 
She plays upon the piano, the jewsharp and bazoon, 
And when she hasn't got a 
cold, sings " Up in a 
balloon ; " 
She goes to balls and parties, and when her name they call, 
The men all stop to look and see the sweetest of them all. 
Oh my! Oh dear! 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, she smiled and said, " you bet,* 
And whispered gently in my ear, " we may be happy yet." 
There's going to be a 
wedding, sometime late in the fall, 
And I'm to be the better half, of the sweetest of them all. 
Oh my! Oh dear! &c. 
I'm going to build a 
mansion, with a 
big plate on the door, 
And put my name upon it, A. Junius Brutus Moore.

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
°Mines the world may laugh, and jeer at what I'm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a rainy 
day ; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
if you can't help yourself, ' tis hard to hind a 
friend. 
ClioR GS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day ; 
— Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, cte. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe : " Touch nothing out of reach 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
A pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right ; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care mit now how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like myfriends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found, was my pocket, 
after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin, 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, dic. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when 
you re poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on yon close the

So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is— put by for a

So now be careful, eke.

THE OLD SEXTON. 
Nigh to a 
grave that was newly made, 
Leaned a 
sexton old on his earth- worn spado; 
Ills work was done, and he paused to wait 
The funeral- train throng,h the open gate. 
A 
relic of by-gone days v

as he, 
And his locks were whim as the foamy sea; 
And these words tame from his lips so thin, 
"I gather them in—I 
gather them in!" 
"I gather them in, and their final rest 
Is here, down here, in the ealth's dark breast." 
The sexton cease :, fur the funeral train 
"Wound mutely o'er that solemn plain ; 
And said to my Lear; `• When Time is old, 
A 
mightier voice than the sexton's old 
Will sound o'er the last trump's dreadful din— 
" 
I 
gather them in—I

THEY SAY MY FOOT IS BIG. 
I 
suppose you've heard of Nieodemus Johnson, 
l'm a 
brother to lihn on my father's side ; 
He pack'd up his duds nil lett me very unhandsome, 
And chassez'd straight up to the Northern side. 
Tie's gone and now I 
am so very lonely, 
The gals won't light no more fur me or spat. 
Because I 
ant so very loose and cat iltss, 
And they say my foot is big, but what of that 
CHORUS. 
So watch me well, don't you tell, 
The gals around. I'm hunky on the flip flap, . 
I 
wear small seventeens, hese l'se raised on Pork and Beans, 
Still they say my foot is big, but N‘hat of that. 
The other night I 
took my love a-skating, 
To the rink where all the colored perso;;,, 4o, 
There was " Sissy Grein" and the " Ilam Fat Man" a 
waltz-
ing, 
Around the rink with young Mss Dinah Snow, 
I 
seized a 
pair of skates and put them on me, 
And made a 
bold leap out but came down flat; 
The gals they roar'd and laugh'd right straight up at me, 
And they say my foot is big, but what of that. 
So watch me well, tte.

LADIES FASHIONS NOW-A-DAYS. 
SONG BY MRS. UOWABD PAUL. 
Ladies' fashions now-a-days surely are astonishing, 
People stare in blank amaze, powerless for admonishing; 
Costumes are so weird and wild, men are too dismayed to quiz 
Fain they'd think they arc beguiled, and discovered vision ' tis. 
Fichu, fat fal, thingamy, taste outrageous running to, 
\\ifs we task, but vainly ask, What the girls are corning to ? 
Once in ample crinoline, round as tea cups ; very soon 
They diminished, slim and lean, like the cup's attendant spoon ; 
Skirts 1

But in tltis there's reason, mind —
What's 
a duck without a 
tail ? 
Slop, slop, spatter, draggle tail , splashin g, 'stead of shunning 
Dangling ends and Grecian bends—What can the girls be 
corning to? 
Was there e'er such jewelry as the present age endures, 
Earrings tortured cruelly, bottle jacks and sets of skewers. 
And his 
whispered (so you're warned), beauty, such is the 
complaint, 
Won't attract if unadorned, and to draw, has learned to paint; 
Persian 1)100111 and indigo, with Sahara's magic dew, 
This new tstvle—pray do not smile l—is what the girls are 
coming to! 
TEACH ME DEAREST HOW TO LOVE THEE. 
Teach me clearest how to love thee, 
Breathe it softly in mine ear, 
And I 
swear by Heav'n above thee, 
I 
will love none half so dear. 
Let it come like rippling music, 
Front the far off distant stream, 
Like some bright and joyous vision 
Only seen in beauties dream. 
Cnonus—Teach me dearest how to love thee, 
Breathe it softly in mine ear, 
And 1 
swear by Ileav'n above thee, 
I 
will love none half so dear. 
Oh I 
take my wayward heart and keep it, 
Call it darling all thine own, 
For I 
vow it's love's completeness, 
That sheds its sweetness thro' my soul. 
Let me feel the gentle pressure, 
Of those ruby lips of thine, 
Wake again the soul felt pleasure, 
That thrills within this heart of mine.

ELIDING DOWN THE CELLAR DOOR, 
Eider JCIMCS. 
There's a 
girl up in the school-house, 
I 
love with all my heart, 
And all was still, just as a 
mouse 
When I 
told her that Love's dart 
Had pierced me and made captive 
This loving heart of mine, 
For her I 
would forever live, 
If she'd let me call her mine. 
Exit James. 
Cnoacs—When first we met I 
must confess, 
Its now three years, oh yes I 
or more, 
With a 
sweet smile she did me bless, 
While sliding down the cellar door. 
Enter Peter. 
I 
think it is a 
cruel shame, 
That I'm to be slighted so, 
Cause Jimmy's oldest, sure the blame 
Is not mine, I've got no show, 
And yet I 
love sweet Mollie so. 
Then with all my usual vim 
I 
said, dear one, oh, don't say no, 
She said, Pete, 1 
best love him. 
Cuoitus—When first, we met I 
must confess, 
It' now three years, oh yes, o more, 
She smiled so sweet. I 
did her bless 
While sliding down the cellar door. 
Enter James. 
Good morning, " Peter," I 
have heard 
That you do love my " Molly." 
Peter. 
She did not speak but in one word, 
She told me it was folly. 
Both. 
But as I 
love is mutual now, 
OUP

And strife to anger tends,

If you but } .

It's now three years oh, yes, and more 
She stalled so tiweet we did her bless 
While sliding down the cellar door. 
A MARRIAGE FEE. 
By J. M. PLITIIER. 
To a 
frontier town some years ago, 
But just how many none care to know, 
A seedy youth and a 
jolly lass 
On a 
solemn nag was seen to pass. 
And, over the nag a 
curious bag 
Ilung dangling down like a 
tipsy wag. 
And as they passed in merriest mood 
Throne11 the logger's smoke and the fresh- clad wood, 
To as said by the boys who chanced that morn 
To clink their hoes in the wayside corn, 
That Mose ( for that was the sly chap's name), 
'Ere he snatched a 
kiss from his half- caught game, 
L.p)ket w.Idly round like a 
frightened steer 
To see that naught but the birds were near. 
But eyes did see, and a 
shout intense 
Rolled stoutly up from an old brush fence; 
A 
shout, that none but a 
boy dare give 
And hope from its echo-shock to live. 
'Twas then the nag's scant banner raised 
And Sal 's plump cheeks like a 
sunset blazed, 
And a 
cursing Mose, so the story goes, 
Left the imys to laugh O'er their rested hoes. 
At lent it at the parson's gate they stood 
As fresh as the leaves in the distant wood, 
And, while Muse searched for a 
parson, who 
Should splice their hearts with a 
legal screw, 
Sally a 
dreamy vigil kept 
O'er the bag, as the old mare nodding, slept. 
A rap at the oaken door soon brought 
The time heat phiz of the parson sought, 
To whom, the rustic bluntly told 
Of his love, and bag, and his lack of gold. 
When, the parson said in a 
half grave way 
As a 
smile crept up to his locks of gray, 
That the far-fetched bag no doubt contained 
What seemed to be by the Lord ordained 
As a 
fitting food for parsons who 
Their warning- trumps on the Sabbath blew 
"I' was then Mose turneti on his stogy heel 
With the regal grace of a 
water wheel, 
And thrusting his gaunt form toward the gate 
Where the old an 
dozed ' neath her undump'd freight, 
Front his deep chest rang hi a 
nasal twang, 
"Come on, Sal, C' ' rite, for he'll take the beans 1" 
Anil the t.elio died on the passing scenes.

MY OLD WIFE. 
I 
merrily sing from morn till night, 
And misery 1 
defy, 
And I've a 
wife who with delight 
Sings just as happy as I; 
She is the comfort of my life 
My darling and my pride, 
For twenty years together, my boys, 
We've traveled it side by side.

Round goes the world, 
Troubles I

Jogging along together, my boys, 
My dear old wife and I. 
When homeward I'm returning, why 
Shell greet are with a 
smile, 
Her dear old face beams with delight 
In such a 
happy style ; 
" 
Sit down by the fireside," 
She Ii say, " and take your tea," 
She laughs and jokes on tother side, 
A

In winter when the snow is down, 
She'll /11et are at the door, 
With '• CI

She brings my slippers, warm and dry, 
And lays them by my side, 
I 
never could find her equal though 
I 
search the world so wide. 
Round goes the world, tic 
I 
smoke may pipe and sing my song, 
Content to stay at home, 
As happy as the day is long, 
And ne'er inclined to roam. 
There's many talk of single bliss, 
And for their freedom sigh, 
But that will never he the case 
With tuy old wife and I.

And what you call " Coo-Tails."

THE YOUNG GIRL OF THE PERIOD. 
She's one that will shirk from all kinds of work, 
But will read each new romance and sonnet; 
Wears feathers and frills, like Foreupi oe gu n s. 
Stuck around in a 
piece of a 
bonnet. 
She loves to tend balls, she loves to ! Lake calls, 
She always looks faded and wearied ; 
She's of the stone stripe, a 
very good type, 
Of the present young girl of the period. 
CTIORUS. 
The truth I 
must speak, tho' sickly and weak, 
Of one thing she never gets wearied ; 
It's " gadding " the stri'et, where often you'll meet, 
With this " gushing" young girl of the period.' 
With " chignons " and " rats " ' neath smallest of hats, 
With a 
pannier assisting to ' bend ' her; 
With cheeks cherry red, tic) . painted ' tis said, 
WW1 a 
look very " gushing 
and tender. 
If old " 
should wake up I 
think, 
The people by hint should lo' queried, 
To know whence she came, and what was the name, 
Of this dashing young girl of the period. 
The truth I 
must speak, & c. 
She marries a 
man as soon as she can, 
And in most cases weds him for money ; 
And twixt your and 1, she'll make it to fly, 
That he'll think it amazingly funny. 
To be a 
good ‘N 
ire, is such a 
dull life, 
Of house-keeping she becomes wearied ; 
Then " Hubby " will find, he must have been blind, 
When he wed this young girl of the period. 
The truth I

In me see a 
maiden of sweet forty-two, 
As young as a 
chicken and tenderer too; 
But now I ; WI sad and my heart's full of pain, 
For I've lust a 
bow- wow 1 
shan't see again. 
CHORUS. 
For I've lost my Bow- wow, who's seen my Bow-wow? 
Poor little Doggy Bow- wow, Bow- wow ; 
I've lost my Bow- wow, who's seen my Bow- wow ? 
Poor little Do:gy Bow- wow, Bow-wow—Bow- wow ! 
When I 
left my home he was fast to a 
string, 
lie never would follow without it, poor thing; 
He'd pull at a 
string till quite black in the face, 
But just see what some one's tied on in his place. 
(Here show a 
bunch of turnips at the end of string in place 
of Dog.) 
For I 
have lost, etc. 
My poor little fellow, so faithful and kind, 
I 
see him, na-thinks! as his tail wagg'd behind ! 
Without Mt, I in certain he'll pike and will die, 
Or perhaps get mistaken for meat in a 
pie. 
For I 
have lost, etc. 
I 
fear that its true every dog has his day, 
Oh I 
please have you seen him, will any one say 
I'd give him my blessing who'd bring me safe back. 
My pretty white poodle, all spotted with black. 
For I 
have lost, etc. 
My puppy is gone—is there anyone here. 
Would love me as he did and hold me as dear, 
If so, drop a 
line, saying where, when and hew, 
And Ill be as happy without my Bow- wow ? 
For I've lost, etc. 
lAbga.t, 
As I 
walked one morning down by the Sligo dock, 
I 
overheard an Irishman conversing with Tapscott; 
Good morning, Mr. Tapscott, would you be after telling to me, 
Have you ever a 
ship bound for New York, in the State 
of Amerikee. 
Oh, yes, my pretty Irish boy, I 
have a 
ship or two, 
There laying at the wharf there, waiting for a 
crew ; 
They are New York packets, and on Friday they will sail, 
At present she is taking in one thousand bags of meal. 
Straightway then I 
started, ' twas on the yellow-grog road, 
Such roars of melee-murder ! oh, the like was rave! known 
And there I 
paid my passage down in solid Irish gold, 
It's often times that I 
sat down and wished myself at home. 
The very day we started, ' twas on the one of May, 
The captain he came upon the deck, these words to us did say ; 
Cheer up, my hearty Irish blades, don't let your courage fail, 
To-day I'll serve you pork and beans, to-morrow, yellow meal. 
One day as we were sailing in the channel of St. James, 
A north-west wind came up to its, and drove us back again; 
Bad luck to the Josh. A. Walker, and the day that she set sail, 
Likewise to Capt. Tapscott, and I.is dirty yellow meal. 
And then I 
went to Liverpool, walking thro' the street, 
Not a 
penny in my pocket., not a 
mouthful for to eat ; 
Bad luck to the Josh. A. Walker, and the day that she set sail, 
For the dirty sailors broke open ray chest, and stole my yellow 
meal. 
But now I'm in America, and working upon the ca.nal, 
To cross the stream in one of these boats, I 
know I 
never shall, 
But I'll cross it in a 
great big ship that carries both meat and sail, 
Where I'll get lashings of corned meat, and none of your 
,yellow meal.

And when winter time comes o'er thee, 
If some I;indred heart ye share,

And let truth alone be spoken,

SWEET :SUNNY SOUTH. 
Take me home to the place where I 
first saw the light, 
To the sweet sunny south take me home ; 
Where the mocking bird sung me to rest every night; 
Aim whv was I 
tempted to roam. 
I 
think with regret of the dear ones I 
left, 
Of the warm hearts that sheltered me then, 
Of the wife and dear ones of whom I'm bereft, 
And I 
sigh for the old place again. 
CLIOILUS. 
Take me home to the place where my little ones sleep, 
Poor massa lies buried close by ; 
O'er the graves of the loved ones I 
long to weep, 
And among them to rest when I 
die. 
Take me home to the place where the orange trees grow, 
To may cot in the evergreen shade, 
Where the flowers on the river's green margin may blow 
Their sweets on the banks where we played. 
The path to our cottage they say has grown green, 
And the place is quite lonely around ; 
And I 
know that the smiles and the forms I 
have seen, 
Now lie deep in the dark mossy ground. 
Take me home, eta. 
Take me home, let me see what is left that I 
know, 
Can it be that the old home is gone? 
The dear friends of my childhood indeed must be few, 
And I 
must lament all alone. 
But yet I'll return to the place of my birth, 
Where may children have played at the door; 
Where they pulled the white blossoms that garn'shed the earth, 
Which will echo their footsteps uo more. 
Take me home, ate.

THERE'S NONE LIKE A MOTHER, IF EVER SO 
POOR, 
You tell me that you love me, I 
fain would believe, 
And will make me your bride and never deceive: 
You offer to me your heart and your hand, 
And make me the mistress of houses and land. 
I 
am but a 
poor cirl, the truth I 
will tell, 
My mother's a 
widow, in yon cottage doth 
She who nursed me in sickness, with little in store, 
Now 
never desert her because she is poor. 
You have promised me servants and carriages so gay, 
And perhaps to deceive me, and lead me astray, 
For some men they will flatter to destroy a 
girl's name, 
And soon she's reduced to a 
sad life of shame; 
And then she's insulted by each passer-by, 
Her life is a 
burden, she could la:- down and (lie, 
Whil e here ea t I 
contented, by Oar own cottage door. 
There's none like a 
mother if ever so poor% 
My dear father's words still ring in may ears, 
'hen dying he bid Inc may Maker to fear, 
And be kind to my mother, from her never part, 
f 
I 
were to leave her, it wculd break her heart. 
Still if we were to marry I 
should lead a 
sad life, 
When your friends, that are rich, knew you'd got a 
poor wife, 
Your parents might slight me, it has been so before, 
I'll not leave my mother, altho' she is poor. 
But if I 
w, re your equal, with wealth to command 
I'd willingly give you my heart and my hand, 
And south eye ry sorro W. dispel every care, 
For there's truth in your face— 1 
believe 3
-on're sincere 
If your parents would bless us, and give their consent. 
We would all live together in peace and content, 
Then my poor aged mother should SOITOW no more, 
For their's none like a 
mother, be she rich or poor.

THINGS A YOUNG LADY WEARS. 
Being short now of a 
subject, on which to find a 
song; 
I've bit upon the happy thought, to pass the time along 
si ng about the articles that a 
young lady wears, 
From balmorals and waterfalls to patent curls and hair 
CLIORUS. 
So if you listen while I 
sing, 
And on my words give heed, 
You will find out all the articles 
That a 
young lady needs. 
She first of all must have a 
rat and a 
silk net bag 
To put her hair in afterwards, or wound upon a 
rag, 
She then must have a 
pair of stays, to show off her frock-coat, 
An elevator she must have, to show her petticoat. 
So if you listen, 417.c. 
She needs some patent plumpers then, if she's got hollow cheeks. 
And if she's aged she will need a 
set of false frcnt teeth, 
She needs a 
May Queen for the Spring, a 
jockey hat for Fall, 
bonnet, too, without a 
cape, to show her waterfall. 
So if you listen, .3.7,c. 
With brass pins, ear-rings, belt and finger rings so fine, 
With tooth brush, fancy soap, hairpins, net, combs and crinoline. 
So timid were our women once, they would frighten at a 
mouse, 
But since they've got to wearing hoops, there's a 
skeleton in 
every house. 
So if you listen, eze. 
A curly net and, beau catcher, comes next upon my list, 
No doubt there's many an article, that in my song I've missed. 
If I 
should try to name them all, the ladies would feel vexed, 
So what I 
have left out to-night, I'll continue in my next. 
So if you listen, &c. 
I LOVE TO BE A SWELL. 
One day while strolling Pall- Mall east 
In the blooming month of May, 
1 
walket I 
and gave my eyes a 
feast, 
Ott the girls who passed that way. 
And soon a 
charmer gaily dressed, 
With eyes sweet hazel brown— 
With tenler words I 
her addressed, 
While we Were xvalking 
SPOKEN —S 
plitaly raising my hat to her, I 
persuasively 
got her to put her arm in mine. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
love to be the swell, to roam about Pall-Mall, 
here or there, or anywhere, so long as I'm a 
swell 
A bonnet shop, oh we must stop, 
What beauties there arrayed ; 
My lady fancies one, of course 
For it I 
quickly paid ; 
And next 3 
splendid shall of lace, 
Of fashion new as day, 
It suited figure well as taste, 
For that too, I 
did pay. 
SPOKEN—The price 
was rather stiffish, 
but you know I 
couldn't decline, as 
I 
love to be, ite. 
So fond of gazing at the shops, 
To soe what's to be bought— 
A 
pair of fancy kids, with tops, 
So smart, her fancy caught. 
Inside the shop our way we went ; 
I 
hoped that they would fit— 
[ 
Pointing over left shoulder] 
And they did— another sovereign wert ; 
For grief my lips I 
bit. 
SroKEN—The pr( on en ado was getting exceedingly expen-
sive; but I 
couldn't complain, for 
I 
love to be, (4.:c. 
A moire dress next charmed her gaze ; 
So sx‘eet t'would suit the bonnet, 
Ten guineit-s, too, not very high, 
And such a 
gaze upon it— 
I 
cried, my love pray draw it mild, 
I 
can stand no more. 
With wants she drove me nearly wild, 
I 
voted her a 
baw— 
SPOREN—She was coming it too strong, but of course I 
didn't 
tell her so, for 
I 
love to be, fic.

FASCINATING DARK BLUE EYES. 
Air—Yaller Gal. 
There's a 
charmer who lives by the green 
And she always looks so sweet; 
So fairy like in feature, 
She's a 
darling little creature, 
And she sali:es every time that we meet. 
She's as handsome and as bright as a 
star, 
And to win her I'm going to try, 
For I 
think, upon my life, she will make a 
loving wife. 
With her fascinating dark blue eye. 
CHORUS.

dear, if she wns mine—rd feel so fine, 
My rose, my hope, my only joy, 
never again would sigh. 
With this daring for my wife, 
I'd be happy all my life 
And the moments so gaily would fly. 
This darling little creature, 
With her fairy form and feature, 
And her fascinating dark h ue eye. 
Oh. I 
meet her most every afternocn, 
And I 
walk up and down the street, 
And when she passes by, I 
am sure to heave a 
sigh, 
For I 
really think she is sweet enough to eat. 
So I 
made up mv mind what to do, 
And the next time she wont by, 
I 
banded her a 
letter, said I 
never could forget her, 
With her fascinating dark blue eye.

And she answered my letter very soon, 
For I

It seemed s,

And she signed lit'r Itame M SS Angelina May. 
But I 
ain't agoi og to tell any more, 
Or some of you may try,
