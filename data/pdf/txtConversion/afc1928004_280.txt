OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
Brooklyn Sunday Sun. 
DEvRitz.—Among the regular company that Col. Sinn hag 
brough Ito the Park, there i3 none who have taken a 
firmer 
hold upon patrons than the ever welcome Sam. 
He bids fair to 
become a 
bigger favorite than he has been at Baltimore, where 
he was located for the last five years. 
As a 
banjo soloist no 
stands without a 
rival, and his local songs and bits produce 
four and five encores nightly. 
For a 
cur:, 01 the blues, take a 
dose of Sam, it that don't drive them away, call in your under-
taker, order your coffin and die at once, for you are incurable. 
Brooklyn Review, August 29, 1875, 
One of the performers at the Park last week was Sair De-
vere, the most enjoyable an( original met amorphistic Ethio-
pian and Teutonic droll in the country, one of this. gentleman's 
songs is enough to vanquish a 
battalion of blue devils. 
1Vashington GazeLte, June 27, 1875. 
Sam Devere, at Comique, Washington, D. C., kept us in a 
COntinuouS state of high-pre,sare exhitherance, and were it not 
lOr the fact that the urban 
Denny 0 
Neil, who, as even \ body 
knows, is grand master at the door of the Com 
ique, 1:hulk:led us 
oil semi- occasionally to gain our woiited meditation and compo-
sed state; we would certainly have gone out of the top of our 
mansard root" or collapsed into a 
massless shape of, old 
clothes, suspenders, nut numberless bone buttons. 
Sam De-
vere is certainl; one of the most versatile olio performers- on 
the stage. .sic newspaper puffing hero; all truths. 
A natural_ 
born son of Momus, an actor of the most APCilrod merit, a 
true 
gentleman of toe Mostgeni2,- disposition, all goodness, Sam De-
vere billy deserves his unparalleled professional prestige. 
To 
our mind he has not his equal on the variety stage, and come 
when he will to Washington he may always contemplate with a 
most cordial welcome.

New Orleans Picayune, November 17, 1874. 
ACADEMY OF Music.—The appearance of Mr. Devere last night 
at the Academy was greeted by a 
very good house, and from , 
the character of the performance given, a 
continuance of libe-
ral palm , 
tege may be fairly presumed. 
Mr. Devere's imitation 
of the Dutch accent and his portrayal of the thousand little 
things that combine to make up the uncouth and simple Teu-
ton, were almost faultless and bristling all over with humor. • 
His voice is soft and pleasing, and he carries that rarest of bag-
gage, an original selection of songs. 
his conversational 
songs are the best heard here for some time; no hackneyed 
jokes or second-hand wit, but a 
fresh, sparkling flow of humor._ 
Buffalo Cour;er, Azfgust 25, 1874 
Mr. Sam Devere, a 
versatile actor and gentleman of more 
than ordinary ability, began an engagement of six nights at the, 
Academy oi Music, and the vtrions characters assumed by him 
enable him to exhibit to excellent advantage his gifts as a 
corn-
median, as well as his remarkable musical talent. 
There is no 
end ot fun in him, and in his songs and dances he displays both 
originality and merit. 
His banjo solo last evening was a 
very 
ne thing. 
We hope his popularity will continue undiminished 
with ourtheatre-goel s. 
Sunday Dispatch (X. Y.), August 29, 1875. 
Sam Devere was warmly received on Monday evening, at the 
rark Theatre. Brooklyn, and proved himself inor, entertaining 
than ever. 
He was warmly applauded in everything he done. 
Brooklyn Eag'e, August 21, 1875. 
At the Park Thdatre, last evening, among the more note-
worthy features of the evening the reappearance 01 Mr. Devere 
comes first. 
This performer is co'rtainlv one of the best and most 
versatile now on the variety stage. 
His Irish, Dutch, and negro 
dialects are equally good, and headds to a 
fine humorous percep-
tion real musical ability. 
Last night he was enthusiastically re-
ceived and sang two new sotto-
Et. one concerning the " pull-back" 
style of ladies dresses heing quite clever and taking,tile oth -1., 
-"Keeping -Up with the Times." Time perform'inces commenced 
watt a 
rollickin ,rfarce called 
Knock Him Down," which was 
very effect ively done by Devere, who went through many aston-
ishing contortions in doing it, to the uproarious de light of the 
audience.

OFF YOUR NUT.* 
Written and composed by SAM DEvEnE. 
AS bye-words now are all the go, I'm goino. to give you one, 
it's used by all, both large and small, you'll hear it on every 
tongue, 
An urchin hails you in the street with " Mister, shine 'em up ?" 
wants ten cents, you offer him five, he says, " Cully, you're 
off your nut.' 
A 
carriage, a 
carriage, a 
hackman cries, till his face gets awful 
red. 
He's anxious to make a 
dollar or two before he ;roes to bed; 
You ask him to drive you around the town and Ian i 
you right 
side up, 
He winks his eye at his pal. so sly, saying • That roster is off 
his nut." 
Thare's yeur German tailor too, who makes such stylish 
clothes, 
What would we do without the man, why surely nobody 
knows; 
He mak s ou a 
suit that's ha d 
to beat, the latest Parisian 
If you t
ce
ntfhim you'll pay in a 
week he'll say, " I 
don't got off 
my nut." 
If on the street you chance to meet a 
friend who has been on a 
spree, 
His hat smashed in, his head swelled up, a 
real old " jam-
boree; ' 
His clothes are soiled, he's got the shakes, perhaps he's bruised 
and ca, 
He says. 
You know how it is yourself, I'm a 
little off my 
nut." 
Now friends if you'll 
good, 
I 
woul n't advise you 
Don't drink too much 
any luck, 
You'll rain your elf i 
your nut. 
take my advice, it may do you some 
wrongully, nor wouldn't if I 
could, 
or stay out nights or you never will have 
both cash and health and go clean off 
* 
This " Off Your Nut" has been a 
bye-word here for some time; 
that is it means gone out of your head or cranky, something, of that 
sort.

A DAMSEL I 
met, oh! how can I 
describe her, 
She looked like an angel just shorn of her wings, 
I 
braced myself up and walked close up beside her, 
And thought her just then the most lovely o. things. 
Her step was so graceful, her smile so bewitching, 
I 
was quite a:. a 
loss what to say, I 
confess, 
When she dropped a 
small handkerchief and worked in silk 
stitching 
In one corner the letters " C. L. A. M. S." 
CHORUS. 
But C. L. A. M. S. I 
couldn't understand, 
What could a 
creature fair as she have to do with clamg, 
The answer that she gave me when I 
asked her to explain, f 
Was Clara Louisa Anna Maria Snifkins is my name. 
This little white handkerchief I 
quickly recovered, 
And then I 
approached her to make known her loss, 
Said I 
beg pardon, Miss, but by chance I 
discove ed 
You drop this on the corner when going to cross. 
Oh, thank you, kind sir, said this model of beauty, 
And the smile that she gave I 
shall never forget, 
•
,r4 
SF 
I 
resolved then to win her and thought it my duty 
To make love right away, which I 
did, you can bet. 
Chorus.—But, &c. 
When I 
told her I 
loved her she declared I 
was bold, 
But smiled when I 
said it and looked very pleased, 
Then told me her husband was rich and quite old, 
And I 
drew her up closer and gave her a 
squeeze. 
I 
shall never forget though, the reception she gave me, 
When I 
called at a 
house this fair dam-sel to meet, 
She took all my cash then declared I 
was crazy, 
And a 
bouncing young man bounced me out in the street. 
Chorus.—But, &c. 
Now, some one . as said it, at least so I'm told, 
Whoever it was they were wonderful wise, 
That all you see glittering is surely not gold,— 
Oh ! what would I 
give if I 
had two such eyes. 
Experience, they say, is the greatest•of teachers, 
So I 
suppose I 
shall have to go clear through the 
To be up to the tricks of these angelic creatures, 
Made up of paint, powder, and feathers and frill.

OLD BOB-VEAT, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written and Sung by Si. DEvEnn.—Air SINCE '
I'm= JOINED 
TI1E GAO. 
OLD Bob Veal was a 
butcher boy, 
And he sold all kinds of meat, 
He was a 'lobby old sport from his toes c'ean up, 
And he'd rather have a 
fight than eat. 
He'd use all the marrow in a 
big shn bone 
To gre.ise his curly hair, 
Which grew in a 
hunch at the back of his neck, 
For the top of his head was bare. 
Old Bob Veal he was dead on the mash, 
And many were the schemes he planned, 
For to catch an old gal called Cod- fish Lize, 
She was boss of a 
big fish S 
and. 
She had eyes like a 
defunct mack-i-reel, 
The puniest that ever was scen, 
She could look two ways and never blink once, 
And their col ..r was a 
sky pea green. 
Many were the sweet little fairy tales 
That Bob told Codfish Lize, 
And many were the sweet soft glances she threw 
On Bob from her mackereel 
es. 
T 
would melt the heart of a 
lohstier, 
Make him Cr p 
one - ympathetic tear, 
Just to hear the real old genuine love 
Bob poured into Elizabeth's ear. 
Cne day Bob got out in the little butcher ca t, 
And hitched up the old gray mare, 
Just to take Lize out for the ood of her health. 
And et a 
little fresh co.•ntry air. 
When Bob asked Lize if she'd be his, 
She bushed and simpered like a 
child, 
Oh, her teeth fell out and then she wept 
And the old gray mare she smiled.

PATENT RUBBER BUSTLE, 
Written and Sung by SAM. DEvEaz 
AS fashions now are all the rage, 
Every day brings a 
new sensation, 
I'll sing to you of Hannah McGlue, 
She was a 
dressmaker by occupation; 
She had a 
big brother, Sam, who peddled fish and clams, 
And oysters, fikeiAise muscles, 
Till a 
happy thought struck him he gave up the fish. 
And invented a 
patent rubber bustle. 
Now Sam, to give his bustle a 
trial, 
Tried the first  one he made on Hannah; 
The very first day she went to promenade 
She slipped on the peel of a 
banana. 
She no sooner struck the ground than she made a 
rebound, 
And landed on the back of Dicky Russell; 
Old Dicky got scared, and the bays all stared 
At the gal with the funny rubber bustle, 
Now the boys yelled loud, and then a 
great crowd 
Soon gathered around poor Hannah; 
A 
policeman flew at Hannah McGlue, 
And used her in an awful rough manlier; 
But she made one slip and broke from his grip, 
After having with hint quite a 
tussle; 
She bounced out of sight like a 
little paper kite, 
This gal with a 
funny rubber bustle. 
Now, when Sam heard Hannah had bounded out of sight. 
He yelled and cried out loud; 
Then he made him a 
bustle twice as big as hers, 
And swore that he'd find her in a 
cloud. 
Then he jumped from the top of a 
blacksmith shop, 
And bounced from the ground with a 
rustle, 
That was the last seen of Sam who used to peddle clams, 
And invented the patent rubber bustle.

I'LL give you my experience now, just as it all 
ccurred, 
On o:.e of the Br. ° idyll ferry u. a 
s, and what I 
saw and heard, 
The high, the low, the rich and poor. to ,
!, ther all aid ride, 
The.r standingill society there was q ic1:1: pushed aside, 
Ladies there in costly dress and too e 
with a 
faded shawl, 
So.. e 
had bun le. , some had babies, some had nothing at • 11; 
Some were tha e 
en bus ness b

pleasure, 
Such curio s 
crowds you'll always find on these ferry boats to-
gether. 
Cu onus. 
From millionaire to beg ar, all were represented thore, 
Rushing th ough the ferry house. paying down ; he fare; 
Some with faces i•a e 
and sad, .. ed. others making merry, 
Such sights yeu'll see most e 
cry day whla crossin; Brooklyn 
terry. 
Jin le goes the pilot's bell which tells the e 
gin er 
To put the wheels in motion, that the rive 
front is clear; 
The machinery once in motion from the slip she'll s :. 00thly 
glide, 
it is a pleasant tr p in summer time to cross from eithel•

There's a 
cabin set apart for gents of whcih they're much in 
need, 
For those who are inclined to smoke to enjoy the fragrant 
w,e1; 
But in the ladies' cabin there the fair sex, I 
suppose, 
Enjoy themselves as ever "Joking at each others clothes. 
Chorus.—From mil ionaire, 
A 
Long Island farm: sat opposite me with a 
home-spun suit 
of clothes, 
Reading a aily pat er through the specs upon his nose; 
He seemed to enjoy the scandal trial and showed it with some 
force, 
When he stamp d 
upon his neighbor's corns and laughed till 
he was hoarse. 
Passengers standing here and there, in little knots together, 
Some were talking po itics and more about the weather, 
Some about the Brooklyn Bridge and others making merry, 
And so the time was quickly passed crossing the Brooklyn 
ferry.

And I've tune , up the banjo to help it along, 
And the theme I 
will give is Old Boston Town, 
The home of the boys who have gained great renown. 
Near the spot where to-da the old South Church still stands, 
There was born to this country the pride of all lands, 
The p

mean,

it was'there that our a 
clout artillery corps met,

MATILDA_ ROOTS, 
Written and Composed by SAM. DEVERE, 
Sung with immense success at Park Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I 
FELL in love with a 
nice young girl, 
Down her ack there hung a 
c 
rl. — Sympla. 
She was such a 
charmer, I 
loved her as my life, 
And resolved that she woul I 
be ong to me, 
That I'd make her my darlin 
wife. 
We took a 
little walk and we had a 
little talk, 
I 
was ha py to think such an angel I'd caught; 
She looked so sweet, just good enough to eat, 
My Matilda Roots. 
We had not walked so very far, 
Before we met her Pa and Ma — Symph, 
And they both seemed so delighted t 
at I [was such a 
nice 
young man, 
Then I 
was introduced to these two old galoots, 
And they warmly shook my hand. 
The old woman smiled, looked at me a 
while, 
Her face just looked like a 
cros .-
cut file, 
I 
was puzzled to think she could own such a 
child 
As lovely Matilda Roots. 
The old man seemed very jolly, 
To be sad he said was folly,—Sym,2h. 
Then again he warmly grasped my hand and invited me to the 
house, 
My heart jumped as high as a 
rooster co I'd fly, 
And scarcely could open my mouth. 
But I 
manlged to thank this fine old crank,— 
I 
was certain f.om the looks of his nose that he drank, 
But what w. s 
the odds, he had money in the bank, 
And I 
loved his charming Matilda. 
I 
started right oft the very next day, 
And stopped in a 
store upon Broadway, — 
Sy mph. 
Bought her p 
esents withou 
number and never asked the 
price, 
What matter to me what the bid ii t 
ht be, 
When she was to be my wife. 
Then I 
bought her a 
muff a d 
a 
nice big shawl, 
A 
hat, and a 
ha tie, and a 
bi 
waterfall, 
Some gloves, and a 
dress, and a 
nice parasol, 
R .I. my Matilda Roots. 
I 
called at he louse that evening, 
My heart like a 
big slip heaving,—Symph. 
I 
was me • b an ancient female who strongly smelled of 
in, 
She it iwked and coughed and said she thought Matilda was 
not in, 
Then' her father and her mother, and he: sister and her 
brother, 
They all came out and laughed at me together, 
Said she ran away with a 'e 
ok-e. ed feller, 
This cruel Matilda Roots.

The Handsome Gal with the Poultry Stand. 
Written and composed by Sam DEVERE. 
Sung with immense success at Park Theatre, Brooklyn, 
I'M sick and sad, and almost mad, 
The world seems upside down, 
Since the only gal I 
ever loved 
Has bounced away from town. 
I 
loved her long, I 
loved her strong, 
And many presents bought her, 
I 
thought that she belonged to me. 
But a 
Dutch pork but her caught her. 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
handsome gal, she lived with her mother, 
And they kept a 
poultry stand, 
But sh got dead struck on a 
Dutch pork:butcher, 
And they sailed for a 
foreign land. 
My grief was great, my heart did ache, 
When I 
found she'd run RNA' y, 
But lived in hopes that she'd come back, 
As time passed day by day, 
But not a 
word fr m 
her I 
heard, 
So cruel and deceiving, 
To think she'd go and leave me so, 
My heart was sore with grieving. 
Chorus.—She was, &C. 
The very day she skipped away, 
How could she so deceive, 
She borrowed all the cash I 
had, 
And left me alone to grieve. 
Rumor said that she had wed, 
One fellow said he seen her, 
She was making tracks with two big sacks, 
Full of sausage for the Hamburg steamer. 
Chorus.— She was, &c. 
One day I 
str, yed where the big ship laid, 
They had just cast off the line, 
When there I 
spied on the deck above, 
The gal I 
once called mine. , 
When I 
saw her there I 
had to swear, 
From love I 
turned to hate her, 
She closed one eye, said " George, good-bye, 
Perhaps I'll see you later." 
Ch rus.—She was, ie.

BROOKLYN CURIOSITIES.

And pay Oil their debts when they can,

A

He wilist es with I ”litninu; vel city. 
With a 
noise like a

He will whistle or die, and he seldom " bralo -. s " (lown, 
On Yankee I) °die— is favorite air,— 
lie whistles ald y

And at night he even whistles his prayers. 
A. man may he poor and yet hold up his head, 
And he as g;ly I1S it bird on

Tr he'll only w. istle, like our ni-litingale, Nig. 
When you want to go over East ,' liver, 
And you can't

Then you stand in the weather and shiver, 
And say,— 1Vouldn't a

That's uist what you want, both for pleasure and biz, 
But oftentimes

By a 
blockade of ice, when there comes a 
big freeze, 
And that's why a

'Tis all well enough in the sinumer, perhaps,

A DREAM, 
Sung with _great success by SAM DEVERE. 
I WAS dreaming last night, I 
was dreaming, 
And my dr am I 
Nill now tell to you, 
I 
thougnt that . ne world had been altered, 
And everything made over new 
I 
thought that an honest mechanic 
Was a-; good as a 
rich man could be, 
And thong a 
girl worked for a 
living. 
No lady was better than she; 
I 
thought that our city was governed 
By men who belon ed to no ring, 
And when a 
man murdered another, 
If guilty he stuely must swing. 
I 
dreamed that our po r 
working women, 
Were allowed by their labo.'s to dye, 
And blood-sucking, thievin ,, employers, 
Fa r 
wages for \vol k 
had io give ; 
We had o ore heart-liken outcasts, 
Every girl led a 
good, honest life, 
And a 
you g 
man respected a 
female 
As lie did his own mother or wife: 
I 
thou lit there were no brutal husbands 
To keep their wives always in fear, 
It a 
man raised his arm to a 
worm ,A. 
Every blow sent himup for a :'ear. 
I 
dreamed that tyrannical England 
Was forced to set Ireland free, 
And that the star-spangled banner now floated 
O'er the Emerald Isle of the sea; 
I 
thought too that poor little Cuba, 
To America always so true, 
Was rid of Spanish cruel oppression 
By Uncle Sam's brave boys in blue 
I 
thought the who'e wirld was rejoicing, 
And every one happy did seem, 
I 
awoke with a 
sad disappointment 
To find that ewas only a 
dream,

CHORUS. 
tve you seen my Sarah Ann, 
She's gone with a

Tingleary, tingleary, tingleary man, 
You'll know her by her two f

Of pearly white that's out 
Iler head aolgh small is same what large 
Although she's dumb can spa t 
Her curly blonde with straight black hair 
her pretty feet are bowes, 
She's coat black eyes of Asia gray 
And a 
humpty dumpty nose. 
Cuoaus.—Havo you &emetic. 
Sln has no head upon her hair, 
Her Lee is on her nose 
She wears a 
silk of water dress, 
And has feet upon her toes 
She wears no waist around her belt 
No fingers on her rings 
Her voice is only twenty 
And her age it sweetly sings 
ClICRUS.—Ilave you seen, ecu 
he has no hair, no teeth, no mouth, 
No wrinkles in her face, 
Ehe wears no hid gloves made ofsilk, 
No shoe strings that are lace, 
She's deaf and dlnil), she carries no crutch, 
And yet walk she fever can 
And come to think, I 
think I

Had a

I 
MUCH PREFER LAND TO THE SEA, 
Written aml sung by llowARD PAUL. 
WHEN I 
was in my early teens 
thought it such a 
lark, 
To hire 
boat and lightly skim 
The waters of the Park. 
And when by floating up and down, 
Q 
iite confident had g 
t, 
said, " I 
was not born to drown, 
By jove Tjll buy a 
yacht." 
Clionus. 
But that queer s 
rt of up and down motion, 
Which one finds on the ‘vobbledy ocean, 
Has inspired me at length with a 
notion 
I 
mac I 
prefer land to the sea. 
I 
bought my yacht. I 
hir d 
a 
crew, 
We look'd a 
tidy craft, 
No end f 
naval terms I 
knew, 
"Bell nd I 
called " abaft." 
As I 
received my friends, I 
felt 
As proud as any Lord. 
For o . e 
there came most dear t , me, 
I 
had my Nell on board. 
Chorus.— For that queer, &c. 
The Admind, that's Neils Papa, 
Observed, " There's wind ahead, 
What will you do, my gallant tar?" 
I 
answered " Go to bed," 
Said he, " Why yoa can't navigate;" 
Said I, 
I've learned the trick; 
On board I 
keep a 
Second Mate 
Who acts NS 111'11 I 
feel sick." 
Chortis,—For that qu er, c!cc. 
On went the yacht, far out to sea, 
The waves rolled mountain high, 
On Nell my 1 . nguid eye I 
cast, 
She smiled, I 
could but sigh. 
For as w flew the waters through, 
Young Brown he sought her side, 
They spooned, I 
heard the false one say 
She ne'er would be my bride. 
Chorus,—For that queer, (kc. 
At length the storm it reached it's worst, 
The rudder was no use; 
The bottled ale by dozens burst, 
The piano it got loose. 
I 
shot s 
raight down the cabin stairs, 
My ; Fiends they flew about, 
As did the tables, lamps and chairs, 
And all that I 
could shout— was 
Chorus.-- For that queer, &c. 
We made for shore, left sea behind, 
The boys cried 
here's a 
sa t ;" 
I 
said " I'm nothi 1g of the kind, 
And that's my only fault." 
But Nell, when she went off to church 
With Brown, that Naval youth, 
Observe I, " I've left you in the lurch, / 
Because, to tell the truth ;"— 
Cuortus. 
That queer sort of up and down motion, 
Which one meets on the wobbledy ocean, 
Has inspired me at length with the notion. 
You much prefer land to the sea.

SARATOGA in the summer time Is where the swells adjourn, 
They cannot stay in the city you know, where it's hot enough 
to burn, 
They strut about the grand hotels, twisting a 
bad mustache, 
They send the thing bang up, you know, it's d 
me on the old 
man's cash. 
Every day in the summer time, 
Providi:g the weather is very fine, 
This nobby swell is bound to shine 
At the springs of Saratoga. 
Every morning, at about the hour of nine, he visits the Con-
gress Spring, 
And drinks about a 
thimbleful and sAys it's just the thing, 
It's quite disgusting to his taste, such horrible stufl, y,u know, 
But everybody rinks it and he's bound to make a 
show. 
Chorus.—Every day, Sc. 
At the race track there on _the grand st ntl, where all the 
Bloods resort, 
You'll find t 
As swell, betting his cash, like a 
real old thoroug,i 
bred sport, 
• 
He puffs 
puffs on a 
dainty cigarette and sips his Heidsick wine, 
he'll just go fifty the stallion wins, he's none of your weak-
kneed kind. 
Chorus.—Every day, &c. 
When the race is over this nobby youth calls his liveried man 
To get those horses from under the shed and get his whip in 
hand, 
Then off they drive, at a 
terrible dash, 
till they get to the 
Grand Hotel, 
Where the driver drops his precious freight, this heavy city 
swell. 
At the Masquerade at Congress Hall he's bound to be on 
hand. 
Where masks and dominos most abound, with music by the 
band; 
He's dressed as handsome Romeo, and dances every set, 
With a 
lovesick female on his arm, dressed as Juliet. 
Chorus.—Every day, &c. 
HONEY in de comb am very sweet, 
But Lucy she am sweeter, 
I'll dress my self up in my best, 
And den I'm gwan to meet her.

As sung by Jorrx ROACH. 
Good evening to you one and all, 
You're looking well I 
see ; 
I 
took a 
trip in a 
great big ship 
Acrooss the raging sea ; 
I've been out of work a 
month or more, 
And you know it's very hard ; 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant in the Boulevard. 
CHORUS. 
Whist I 
ad id-y! Whist I 
ad-i-dy! 
Times are very hard, 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
So here I 
am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid; 
While my sou does carry the Pick, my boys, 
And I 
do handle the spade ; 
My Unc'e Dan is an Alderman, 
And he holds a 
grip in the ward ; 
'Tis him that gives the tickets out 
To work on the Boulevard, 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! &o. 
So now farewell, I'm going away, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
For if I 
sing any more for you 
I'll lose a 
half a 
day; 
I'm going down to the City Hall, 
To try ; ind get a 
card 
To put my father's Uncle to work 
136yant on the Boulevard.

I 
come with news to-night, me boys. 
Just heed me for a 
while ; 
My song will give delight, me boys, 
For it makes me grin and smile ; 
You've heard about that famous man, 
Who left us all in pain ! 
Sure ! he's back at last, all safe and sound 
Mulcahy's home again! 
ClIORUS. 
The shout and checT and drink yer beer, 
No more in grief remain ; 
For now the cry is everywhere, 
"Mulcahy's home again !" 
I 
met him clown in Chamber.; Street, 
A 
week ago to-day ; 
And when I 
shook him by the hand, 
Sure, I 
thought I'd faint away! 
Ile's .Dig an— stout, and walks about, 
In dress ooth nate and cane ; 
Says I, with glee, " S., can this be," 
Mulcahy's home again ?" 
Then shout and cheer, ka. 
I 
axed him why he :-
.;tro..yed away, 
And left us all behind! 
But a 
divil a 
word would he reply, 
To satisfy me mind; 
He may have lived in foreign lands,— 
In Jarsey, or in Spain; 
But none will care from whence he came, 
When he's home with us again. 
Then shout and cheer, Zir.c. 
He talks no more of Politics, 
He says he's had enough; 
To stand their capers and their tricks, 
One must be bold and tough! 
He thinks he'll start a 
corner store, 
And paint a 
sign so plain, 
To greet us when we reach the door— 
" 
Mulcahy's Home Again !" 
Then shout and cheer, &e. 
HOME RULE, 
Copyright, 1S75, by JOHN ROACH. 
IT'S many years ago in Irelanl, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of„Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right, 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, frt. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save',. 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did best w. 
His voice he never gave oar people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far a 
ad distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, &c. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now? 
To win our Legislatur3 back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
home Rule for Ireland for everm re. 
Chorus.— Hurrah for, &c.

The twenty-two'th of June, 
The clock had just struck forty-three, 
Towards the afternoon ; 
When in a 
green and shady lane, 
Not far from Temple Bar, 
I 
saw a 
lady walking on 
An Irish jaunting car.

I'm going " Nowhere," by and by, 
And then I'll bring my witnesses; 
Say, do you know where Nowhere is 1 
Her father is a

A 
four wheel Hansom cab! 
Her lovely eyes are black and blue. 
Her lovely hair is drab ; 
She has an only brother, and 
Another one as well ; 
She says she loves her mother, but 
She'll kiss and never tell. 
If you don't believe it, Ite. 
She used to have a 
sister once, 
Who's always with her now; 
They never disagree, because 
They do so like a 
row; 
'Twas when we rode out for a 
walk 
I 
found she loved me so, 
For every time I 
squeezed her hand, 
ghe kissed my brother Joe. 
If you don't believe it, &c. 
A 
asked her if she'd marry me, 
She smiled and answered " No !" 
So we were wed last Friday week,

Of princes and of kings, 
Who strippid of all their grandeur,

man can have is 
Gold, Gold, Gold! 
The man that's minus money, 
Tne world will cell a

And pass him by, but if he's rich, 
c'aily raise its hat; 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But smiles on he who wins, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins.

Appears a

To those who have never perused the sad story of CHAR. 
LOTTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, syra-, 
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
ttmate Charlotte Temple: 
fIer form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
Idtriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

Is commonly called "flirting."

We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, co 9ting 
25 cents, ' aged "The Little Flirt," pubdshed by Messrs. FiAier & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing al, all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford rome iimocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitata to recommend it to out

THE APPRENTICE 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ I . 50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this e•,-eellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics consists in the fol- . 
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechauics, adapted to the advanced classts 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the niany mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
folly answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
4 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
1 
the publishers, gives it his ino.L.t ea-nest recommendation, 
I 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 1 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery; 
I 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc. — .
Manufacturer 
I 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
./1khe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has r_mde some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
, 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on Practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing- as appren-
g 
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a woik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them- : 
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to i 
efer ' 
I 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might he advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
