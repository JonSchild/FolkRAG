I: 
All right. Well, the first thing I want to say is thank you for agreeing to do this interview, and also thank 
you for the work that you do—for doing the work as a personal care assistant because we believe the work that 
you do is really, really important. And we want to get the word out there and let other people know what you’re 
doing, and what’s the value of your work? What do you think the value of your work is? So, we’re gonna start 
right in with your stories about how you got into this kind of work, and why, and when? So, maybe we could 
start with you, D? 
D: 
Okay. I got into it—it’s almost 23 years ago [1.17.31]. It was during the winter, February, and just 
needed a little extra money. My husband was construction, and so unemployment in the winter time, and I saw 
the ad in the paper. I thought, well, I did not know what home healthcare or this was—what the thing was, and I 
went in and talked to them and interviewed, and the next thing I knew I was having orientation and training and 
started work the next day or [laughing] something, I think. Yes. And it was just—like I said, something I just did 
not know that they had this or what it was, but it didn’t take long to learn it and do it. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, 23 years later you’re still doing it. 
D: 
Still doing it, still. 
I: 
So, you must have liked it? 
D: 
I do. I like it. I love it. I look forward to it all the time. Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
How ‘bout you, Di? 
Di: 
When I first started it was back in the ‘50s and ‘60s. My mom was an epileptic and back then they didn’t 
know how to treat it, so being the oldest of four kids, I had to make sure that when she had a seizure she did 
not have anything sharp in her hand or swallow her tongue. And I’d get her on the floor and let her do her 
seizure. And then my husband graduated from Tech, we moved to Houston. We moved back up to the UP in 
2000. I saw an ad in the paper for New Star. I applied, got hired the same day, and I enjoy my job. So, yeah, 
and I get to meet a lotta people [1.15.52]. 
I: 
So, before you started New Star you took care of your mother. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But you didn’t have clients for pay. 
Di: 
No. Back then, no. 
I: 
Yeah. Okay. And so, you must have liked it very much. 
Di: 
I did. 
I: 
You stuck with it. 
Di: 
I have stuck with it, yeah. I did. 
I: 
Can you tell me what it is you like about it? 
Di: 
Um there’s so many things. I enjoy being with the people, knowing the people need my help, seeing the 
smile on their face, knowing that when I come in the door they’re happy to see me. They’re grateful to be in 
their home, things like that. 
I: 
So, you find that just making somebody happy is rewarding? 
Di: 
It’s rewarding. It’s very rewarding, yes.

I: 
Okay. How ‘bout you D? 
D: 
Yes. That is one of the main things is just to make the people feel happy [1.14.53] and comfortable with 
you, and just help ‘em. See what their needs are, and just to be with them and make ‘em happy [laughs]. Try to 
calm ‘em down when they need to be or when they’re getting down trying to cheer them up, and make sure 
they’re safe, and just be happy with ‘em. 
I: 
So, after 23 years you’ve, I’m sure, had a lotta clients? 
D: 
Lotta clients. 
I: 
Seen a lotta things? 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Developed relationships over years with your- 
D: 
Relationships. You get very close to them and with their families, and you just learn a lot about them. 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you tell me about one of your favorite clients? Can you remember from all through the years, do 
you have some favorites? 
D: 
Oh, some very favorites. One lady that had a stroke, and she and her husband lived together [1.13.54], 
and she just was—one whole side was paralyzed. She was in a wheelchair, and then later when her husband 
got in rough shape, and she would try to take care of him, and he would take care of her. And she had two 
daughters, but they weren’t always in the area. So, a lotta times she was just alone, and she was just special. 
It was a lotta work gettin’ her into the shower, and [inaudible]— 
I: 
Talk about what you did for her. 
D: 
I did personal care, which entailed everything from hair—washing hair—to shower and transfer in and 
out of the wheelchair into the shower, and helping her with it, helping her with planning meals and cooking, 
baking for her, shopping. I took her to a couple of appointments, just about anything she needed [laughs] or 
that, mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, she stands out in your memory? 
D: 
That was one, yes. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
How ‘bout you Di? 
Di: 
I have several, but I have a client now that is probably my favorite. She considers me her best friend, 
and when I first started with her 11 years ago, her husband was at home, and he was a client too. And the first 
time I went in there, he looked at me and asked me to shave him. He had a long beard, and he would never let 
anybody shave him. It took me 3 days, but I did [group laughter]. 
I: 
Three days to shave him. 
Di: 
Shave him, I mean ‘cause his beard was so long. You had to go [laughing] slow, you know. And he 
used to work nights, so his biological system was off ‘cause when he was working he worked nights, and he’d 
sleep during the day. So, at home, that’s what he would be doin’. Then he’d be up and food on the counters, 
you know. And then he passed away a few years ago, and I’ve kept with his wife, and I take her to 
appointments. I take her shopping, make sure she has her insulin, does her sugars, her pills, you know

[1.11.23], whatever her needs. And her kids do not live in Michigan, and she tells everybody I’m her best friend 
[laughing]. 
I: 
So, no local family. 
Di: 
No local family, no. I’m like her family here. 
I: 
You’re the primary caregiver. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. I am, and if somethin’ happens, I’m her first call before anybody else. 
I: 
What would happen if you weren’t here? 
Di: 
Umm— 
I: 
What would she do? 
Di: 
If it was an emergency, she’d call 911 or hit her life line, you know, and then after that she would call P. 
I: 
And both of you work for an agency. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And all of your clients are through the agency? 
D: 
Arms of Angels. 
I: 
Arms of Angels, which is a local agency? 
D: 
A little private company. 
I: 
A private company. And you’ve been with Arms for Angels for? 
D: 
Ten. 
Di: 
Ten years, yeah. 
D: 
It’s been at least 10 years now. 
I: 
And you have, I understand some of the Upcap clients. 
Di: 
I do, yeah. 
I: 
Not all of ‘em probably, but— 
Di: 
Most of ‘em are. I’ve had some Veterans, VA clients too, mmm hmm. 
I: 
Okay. And you both mentioned family right off. 
D: 
Mmm hmm 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It’s almost like the one client is—not your only client—you’re sort of taking on [1.09.52]— 
Di: 
Yeah. Well, when you work with these clients you’re their caregiver, everything, and then you’re their 
friend, and over the years you develop a friendship with not only the client but with their family, and then they 
all feel like you’re part of their family.

I: 
So, have you ever had any clients that were difficult? 
D: 
There have been a few, yes, difficult ones. Uh-huh. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Does one of those types of clients come to mind? 
Di: 
[Laughing] 
D: 
Oh, dear. 
I: 
You don’t have to name names. 
Di: 
Umm hmm. I had a client once, and she was a diabetic, and she had to take insulin like [1.09.05] three 
times a day, and to take her shopping she’d be puttin’ candy—only candy in her cart, and I’d have to be takin’ it 
out because, you know, diabetics you can’t [laughing] have all that. 
I: 
[Laughing] 
Di: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you’d be right behind her taking— 
Di: 
Candy out, yeah— 
I: 
--puttin’ it back on the shelf? 
Di: 
--and she’d be puttin’ it [laughing] back in the cart [laughing]. 
I: 
that’s a tough one, isn’t it? 
Di: 
It is tough. 
I: 
When you’re trying to be person-centered, and you’re trying to honor their wishes. 
Di: 
Right. 
I: 
Yeah. How do you handle that? 
Di: 
It’s kinda difficult, and bein’ a diabetic you know you have to watch the sugar [1.08.30], and for her 
havin’ to take the insulin like three times a day, it was challenging. 
I: 
I’m sure. 
Di: 
You know. 
D: 
I’ve had diabetics, too, and I’d come in the morning, and next to the chair he’d have a big pile of candy 
wrappers piled up, or you’d buy him a thing of grapes. He wouldn’t just eat a little bit. He ate the whole bag of 
grapes, and that’s a lotta sugar. Yeah, [inaudible] but yeah, there are clients that will just—there weren’t that 
many that were really bad, oh [sighs]. 
Di: 
Right. 
D: 
Oh, dear, some are bad, yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
And what would you call bad?

D: 
One just—you felt like you were walking on pins and needles. You know, they’re just watching you so 
much, and like they were just looking for you to do [laughing] something wrong or something, and you just—
you’re tryin’ so hard to please them, and it just seems that it couldn’t happen. And then I had a woman one 
time that would just—I got there one morning and had petals from flowers leading up to her house, and I got in 
there and she had this big butcher knife on the table. Yeah [laughing]. She was always pleasant to me, but she 
just—you never knew what she was gonna say. 
I: 
What was the story with the flowers and the knife? 
D: 
I don’t know she just—and then she thought she had lost money one time, and that’s really the chore. 
You know, their minds aren’t quite what [laughing] they should be or that and [1.06.40] things are missing. And 
it’s so hard. You have to be so careful, and when they’re—someday I leave, and I keep telling them don’t, you 
know, leave your money out like that. I’ve had one where they did—she just thought that I had taken it, and 
that was really hard, you know, and I knew I didn’t. 
I: 
How did you handle that? 
D: 
I can’t remember. I don’t know if you remember which one it was. It’s been years and years ago, but 
yeah, but she had a little mental— 
Di: 
But it is the hardest thing— 
D: 
She had a mental problem a little bit too, 
I: 
So, was she having some dementia? 
D: 
Oh, I think so. She was so crippled up, and she had a rough, rough life. It was really hard, and she had 
family around, but just nobody wanted anything to do with her. The majority of the time, we really got along 
good. She was happy, you know, to have me and the things I did for her and that, but she just off once in a 
while like that. But it was scary. 
I: 
You were frightened? 
D: 
Yeah. I was. Mmm hmm. That was scary. 
I: 
The knife kind of frightened you? 
D: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Did you do anything with the knife [1.05.25]? 
D: 
Oh, no. Uht-uh. I don’t remember what it was, but yeah just—I don’t know. It was not very nice. 
I: 
So, you’ve had a wide range of clients. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And relationships. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
From the real positive to some that weren’t quite as positive, right. Can you talk a little bit about the 
range of care that you provide from companionship to total care? A little bit about—we were talking a bit about 
companionship prior to starting the interview. That’s kind of a misnomer. It’s not a really accurate description. 
D: 
It’s not.

I: 
Can you talk about that for a minute? 
Di: 
I had a client that had MS. Okay. We had to—she had a track on her ceiling, so we had to get her into 
like a sling, and get her secure, and bring her up to the ceiling—not up to the ceiling, but as high as we could 
get her to bring her into the bathroom and for me to give her a shower I had to have the shower chair in a 
certain place to sit her down, and then giver her, her shower and dry her up, and dress her, and then bring her 
back up, and then sit her on the toilet bowl ‘cause that was the routine. And when she was done with all that 
then the wheelchair wouldn’t fit in the bathroom. So, we had to park it in front of the door, and you had to bring 
it up, and you had to be so precise in putting her in the chair. Otherwise, she was uncomfortable, and there 
were days you couldn’t get her comfortable in that wheelchair as hard as you tried. And that was one of the 
biggest challenges [1.03.28], but it was also very rewarding, at the same time.  
D: 
And she had a spouse that had mental illness. 
Di: 
Yes. Yeah. She had a spouse, and he had mental illness, so that was another challenge right there. 
I: 
Can you describe a situation when you were there, and the husband was there, and there were issues? 
Any stories come to mind? 
Di: 
Basically, it was like she would want something to eat, and she would specify what she wanted, and he 
didn’t want her to have it. And that would be a challenge because I would have to— 
I: 
So, what would happen? 
Di: 
--I’m supposed to—I’m there for her, so I’m supposed to—but he was doin’ cookin’ for her, you know, at 
the time, and so sometimes she would give into what he wanted her to have. And then I would take her out in 
the wheelchair and take her out—on a nice day—down the ramp and let her—we’d go round the block a 
couple times, so she could relax before she went in again [1.02.13]. 
I: 
So, there was some tension between them? 
Di: 
Sometimes, yeah. And then he worked at Walmart as a greeter, too. So, when he was gone that was a 
good thing, you know, and then the grocery list. I would kinda make a grocery list with her of things that 
[laughing] she wanted—the things that were easy for her. Being—having MS sometimes she would have a 
hard time to swallow, so you want soft foods, you know. Things like that. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, that brings up a, you know, talking about the things that you do for somebody—we were talking 
earlier about how if you were trying to explain what you do to somebody who has no clue—didn’t you say that 
somebody today asked you? 
Di: 
A good friend, she just asked me today, “Well, what do you do?” And she had no idea what I do, and I 
started tellin’ her a few things, a few of the household things. “Oh, you do? You do that, you know?” [Laughs] 
yeah, she had no idea. 
I: 
Well, what did you tell her? 
Di: 
Well, when she asked about household work I just told her whatever needs doing—the bathroom is the 
main thing. Mostly, it’s people their vision isn’t that good, and I mean they don’t realize the toilet—every day 
that toilet bowl, everything needs cleaning. It’s just real dirty, and sweeping, and mopping, and windows if they 
need a little cleaning, and your cupboards need wiping, and refrigerator, stove, and bedding. Make sure their 
house is free of clutter, so they’re safe so they won’t be falling. Watch for all these little throw rugs that they 
think they should have [laughing] down and get rid of those. And then personal care. It’s just everything—
toileting, and assisting them in the bathroom, a man for shaving or [59.58].

I: 
So, when you talk to people about—what we’re finding is that when the personal care workers try to 
explain to other people, they say, “Yeah, well, I do personal care,” which doesn’t really— 
D: 
I know. That’s what I always thought - is just personal care. 
I: 
“I take ‘em to the bathroom. I, you know,” it just sounds so easy. “I give ‘em dinner. I make dinner,” and 
then you hear people say, “Well, how hard can it be to make a dinner, you know?” 
D: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
I see your face Di, tell me. What is that face for? 
Di: 
Because I have—I have known caregivers that can’t boil water. That’s [laughing] the face. I mean I 
have gotten complaints from clients that say, “Well, she burnt my toast, and she couldn’t boil a hotdog.” I mean 
how hard is that [laughing]. 
I: 
Well, I’m thinking too, though, of—you mentioned earlier your client who has MS and she has trouble 
swallowing. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, it’s not just about cooking the meal is it? 
Di: 
No. It’s not. You have to make sure it’s somethin’ that they can’t choke on, if they have a hard time 
swallowing. You know, soft foods. Some clients may be on a restricted diet. 
I: 
Like what? 
Di: 
Like if you’re—[laughing] I don’t know how to say this. If you have somethin’ goin’ on with your 
esophagus or something like that, and the doctor’s ordered you to have like puree foods or soft foods, you 
have to make sure that that’s what they have. It can be soft, maybe like a soup or maybe a sandwich, but not a 
toasted sandwich. Something that’s soft that’ll go down easy. 
I: 
And do you have to puree the food sometimes? 
Di: 
Sometimes we’ve had to, mmm hmm [57.56]. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then what about people who actually need assistance eating? 
Di: 
We do that too, mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you think of some clients where you’ve had to help them eat? Is it really easy to do? 
Di: 
It’s not hard, you know. 
I: 
Okay. Are there special tricks or skills? You know, do you have people that— 
D: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
--don’t wanna eat or, you know, it’s hard for them to swallow? 
Di: 
Actually, I’ve never had that. 
I: 
Really? 
Di: 
Yeah.

I: 
Okay. How ‘bout you, D? 
D; 
No, unt-uh. 
I: 
No. 
D: 
Not for feeding. 
I: 
Yeah. You look like you’re thinking about somebody. 
D: 
I was trying to think of something. 
Di: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. I think that’s part—we were talking earlier that people don’t really understand the depth of what 
you’re doing. 
Di: 
What we do, right. 
I: 
And that you mentioned safety. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And that being a companion doesn’t mean just sitting there visiting [56.57]. 
Di: 
No, it doesn’t, not at all. 
I: 
You know, playing cards. 
Di: 
No. 
I: 
Can you describe what it really means? What is it you’re— 
Di: 
You’re taking care of your client. You’re making sure all the personal cares are done, and any light 
housekeeping, meals, anything like that, but at the same time you’re doing all of this, you’re talking to them. 
That’s companionship. They’re talking to them, having them tell you stories of their past. Things like that. 
D: 
You try to get ‘em to socialize. 
Di: 
Socialize, yeah. 
D: 
Try to get them to come out. 
P: 
You had to about the stove. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
The life lines. 
I: 
Okay. There’s a story here? 
Di: 
Oh, there’s, yeah. My one little man that—the married couple. One morning I went into work, and he 
had dementia, and he tried to cook. They had a gas stove. He tried to cook eggs in a bowl on the stove with 
the burner on, and I walked in in the morning, and I had egg [laughing] all over the burner. I had such a mess 
[55.39], and then I went back, and I told his wife, and we decided at that time we had to unplug the stove when 
we left at night, and we had to hide the cord, so he couldn’t find it ‘cause he would try to cook too. 
I: 
Lucky the house didn’t burn down. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
8
Di: 
Burn down, yes. It is—we are, mmm hmm. 
I: 
Or that he got burned. 
Di: 
Yeah. Right, but he had the dementia, so he didn’t really realize what he was doing. He knew he was 
hungry, and he wanted an egg. 
I: 
Fixed himself an egg. 
Di: 
Yes, he did [laughs]. 
I: 
Got himself one. 
D: 
The clients have had more burnt tea kettles [group laughter]. You know, they put it on and go in the 
other room or do something, and it’s just fortunate that no fire or something, but yeah. 
I: 
So, have you ever had to deal with like an emergency situation where, you know, the house was on fire 
or somebody was choking—that was an exaggeration, but— 
Di: 
I’ll tell ya, my little man that I talk about, I was gettin’ ready for my shift to leave one night, and he was 
sittin’ at the dining room table. And I said to him, are you okay? And he looked at me, and he goes, “No. I’m 
having a heart attack.” And he’s got dementia, and his wife was on the phone in the bedroom, and I went 
[54.21] back there and I said I need the telephone right now. He’s having a heart attack, and I called 911, and I 
gave the dispatcher all the symptoms, and she said, “He’s having a heart attack, and where’s he?” I said, he’s 
sittin’ at the dining room table. She said, “Keep him there.” She talked to me until the EMTs got there, and 
when the EMTs got there, they did their thing, and they told me he was having a heart attack. They got him on 
the stretcher, and he held my hand, and he says, “I want you to come with me.” And I said I can’t. I gotta get 
your wife ready. I have to take her to the hospital with you, and then after they all left, everything calmed down, 
I called P, and I told her what was going on. First thing, you don’t panic. You just do what you have to do, and 
afterwards, if you have to panic, you panic [laughing]. 
P: 
Or crying maybe. 
Di: 
Or start crying, yeah. And then I took his wife to the hospital, and I stay there until they admitted him, I 
brought her home. And he was in the hospital for a good week or so, and then he went into the nursing home. 
But he was of sound mind even though he had the dementia to tell me he was having a heart attack. 
I: 
So, he really was having a heart attack? 
Di: 
And he was really having a heart attack. He had a full-blown heart attack is that they told us at the 
hospital. 
I: 
Wow. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, but you never panic— 
D: 
No. 
Di: 
You just do what you gotta do [52.55], and afterwards the tears can come, you can panic, whatever. 
I: 
Stay calm. 
Di: 
Stay calm, yeah. 
I: 
And do you just know how to do that? 
Di: 
It just comes— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
9
I: 
And some people wouldn’t stay calm. Some people would— 
Di: 
I know, and it—for me it just comes naturally. It just comes naturally. 
D: 
You just do what you have to do. Like, one that fell backwards, and I knew she needed help, and called 
911, family, and then P. 
Di: 
Yeah. 
D: 
And that was just within minutes they were there. She ended up in the hospital. 
Di: 
And the thing I notice up here is when I call 911, like with the heart attack, if it’s an emergency, a bad 
emergency, the dispatcher will stay on the phone with me to make sure I’m okay, and the client is doing okay 
until the EMTs get there. And then I will tell them [51.59]—and sometimes if the police are nearby, they will 
come too. 
D: 
Yeah. The police will come. 
Di: 
We’ve got a lotta support here. 
I: 
So, we’re gonna stop for just a minute, and then I wat to talk more about some of your special 
conditions up here in the north, and— 
Di: 
[Laughter] 
P: 
Is it okay if I talk a second? I’m gonna go, D, your [inaudible] client started her nightgown on fire, 
remember? 
I: 
Oh, my. 
P: 
She burned herself—Mrs. P there, when she went to cook something one time. Her nightgown started 
on fire. 
I: 
Oh, the nightgown caught on fire. 
P: 
I don’t know. I remember that, and then you were with, you know, my auntie. 
D: 
Yeah. That was the one that fell, yeah. 
P: 
I have a question. When we were talking about the MS client, I hope you didn’t say too much ‘cause of 
confidentiality. 
I: 
Right. 
P: 
We didn’t say—I mean is there anything? 
I: 
No.  
P: 
‘Cause we said he worked at Walmart and that he had mental illness. I just wanna make sure. 
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
Are we okay with that? 
I: 
Yeah. Are you okay with that? 
P: 
Yeah. I just don’t wanna—

Di: 
We don’t name names. 
P: 
No, I know it, but are they gonna put that together? 
I: 
Yeah. I know especially— 
Di: 
I don’t think he’s here anymore. 
I: 
--in smaller areas—I know especially when you’re in a smaller city or something, you know, people 
know—everybody knows everybody. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It doesn’t take long to figure it out. 
Di: 
Right. 
I: 
So, I understand your concern [50.37]. 
P: 
Right. I wanna make sure we’re okay with that. 
I: 
Right. 
P: 
Okay. 
Di: 
‘Cause when we talk about clients we never say names or talk to anybody— 
I: 
Yeah, but it is a good warning though to be careful. 
D: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
You know, you don’t wanna say anything that’s gonna identify or where people— 
D: 
Yeah. Right. 
I: 
So, just be aware of that— 
P: 
Very small community. 
Di: 
Oh, no. 
I: 
It’s an important point to make, so and we don’t want to, you know, you might not use their name, but 
you might say something that somebody would be able to listen that and— 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
I: 
I went to a conference—I was a judge actually at a Research Day once, and I was judging posters, and 
I came across a poster that was deidentified, so you weren’t supposed to be able to tell who it was, and I read 
it and I realized immediately it was my sister’s case study. 
P: 
You’re kidding? 
I: 
No. I could tell exactly it was her story. You know, just because there were enough facts. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, just be mindful of it. 
P: 
And you have, I just—I mean I threw in about the mental illness. I thought, oh, maybe I shouldn’t have 
ever said that.

D: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
No. Thank you for pointing that out. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Be very careful. 
P: 
Well, thank you so much, and that little M, T, she don’t tell me nothin’ up there [group laughter]. I’m 
glad. M’s a different—real shy— 
D: 
Oh, the one in Iron River? 
P: 
Yeah. Yes. Thank you. Travel safe. 
I: 
Thank you for everything. 
P: 
Keep goin’ for the cause ‘cause I mean we need it. We’ll all be retired, you know, we’re gonna need 
some services in our homes someday, you know [48.59]. 
I: 
Exactly. We all want to be cared for well. 
P: 
Our average employee is probably 60 years old. I have people up into their 70s, and some the same 
age as—one’s almost 80. Some of our best— 
I: 
People—we interviewed a personal care worker who’s 87. 
P: 
Eighty-seven. My dad, if he was just a little bit—my day could be a personal care worker. 
D: 
I know. Yeah. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Well, thank you for all that you do. 
P: 
Thank you girls. 
Di: 
Bye, P, talk to you later. 
P: 
Yes. Talk to you later.  
I2: 
Okay. I am ready right now. 
I: 
Okay. All right, so, we’re going to shift gears just a little bit and talk about—well, you’ve already been 
talking about some of your situations, which is great. You have a range of clients. You have a range of care 
that you provide, and I know that one of the, I think, unique things about the work that you do is personal care 
workers don’t always have a lot of information when they first go to a house. 
Di: 
Right. They don’t. 
I: 
You don’t really know what you’re walking into. 
Di: 
You don’t, no. 
I: 
And I’m sure you’ve seen a whole of range of houses and family constellations [47.40]. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm [laughs].

I: 
Maybe you could give us a sense of that range? Like from, you know, the most shocking to the—or just, 
you know. 
Di: 
The most shocking for me was when I first started. I think like my third client I had, you know. She was 
in a trailer, and [laughing] I can still see her today. I knocked on her door, and I said, hi, I’m Di with New Star, 
and I’m here to help you. She looked at me, she greeted me at the door in a lace blouse, nothing underneath 
and a pair of panties, green. I will never forget that, and she says, “I don’t need your help.” And she says, “You 
can go home,” and I said, but I can’t. I have to stay and help you. And she hadn’t had a bath in years, and her 
trailer—there was an isle like that from the front door to her bedroom. You couldn’t walk in there, literally walk. 
And then we had a tornado here. Her sister and I started cleaning [46.28] up, and I got the bathtub—and I 
asked her one day, I said who’s your favorite singer? And she said, Celine Dion. So, she had a Celine Dion 
CD, so I put it in, put a bubble bath in her bath, and had the music blarin’ for her. And she took a bath. I 
washed her hair. I mean that was the first time in years, and then it was about a few months later we had a 
tornado up here, which is unusual, and a tree hit her garage. And she greeted the guys that were goin’ around 
the same way. Dressed almost the same way, and she says, “It happens. I don’t need help.” [Laughing]. I 
mean you never know what you’re gonna walk into until you get there, and whatever the—you just go with it. 
You just have to go with the flow of how you’re greeted and everything else. But people are so grateful and 
happy to have the help even though they tell you they don’t want the help, they are grateful and happy to have 
it. 
I: 
So, even though she said she didn’t need you, you sensed that she was grateful? 
Di: 
Yes, I did. And, you know, I was there every day, every day for about 4  years. 
I: 
Four years. 
Di: 
Before she fell and ended up in the nursing home. Mmm hmm. She fractured a hip, mmm hmm. 
I: 
How do you provide care in a place where there’s only a tiny little isle? 
Di: 
We ended up between her sister, her brother-in-law, myself, and her, we ended up gettin’ rid of 
everything—a lotta stuff. She had a gas stove. The gas was turned off. It just took time. 
I: 
Yup. And she let you do that? 
Di: 
And she let me do that, and she started—once—after that first bath that she had she felt refreshed and 
she enjoyed it. So, maybe twice a week I would do that for her and wash her hair. 
I: 
But what I’m hearing is some creative problem solving because you had a bubble bath and Celine Dion 
playing. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you had to sort of strategize and think how can I get her—? 
Di: 
Right. Because I have found that the elderly, they don’t like to take a shower or a bath. They just feel 
like they’re clean even if they wash their face. They feel clean [43.37]. That’s how they feel, but once they have 
that shower or that bath, they’re feeling refreshed.  
I: 
Have you run into where it’s a little bit—there’s some tension because you’re bathing somebody else? 
Di: 
Ump mmm. 
I: 
Particularly a male—maybe a male? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18

Di: 
No. 
I: 
No problems? 
Di: 
No problems. When I’ve had men and I’ve had to give ‘em a shower I have been—I will step out of the 
room for them to do their privates and to do the rest of them I have a little hand towel that they put over their 
privates, so that, you know, it’s their privacy, and that’s how I’ve always done it, and that’s how I was taught to 
do it. Mmm hmm. 
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
How do you handle that? 
D: 
The same way about even the women sometimes are so reluctant to have you give them a shower. 
They just don’t want you to, but that first one it always takes a little, you know, trying to do what you can 
[laughing] to get her to do it. 
Di: 
Right. 
D: 
But then after that first time, then they look forward to it [42.30]. Yeah. 
I: 
It gets easier. 
D: 
It does, yeah, mmm hmm. 
Di: 
And all you have to do is give ‘em a little hand towel and have ‘em put it over their privates. 
I: 
Now, how about the range of places that you’ve walked into and situations you’ve walked into? What 
stands out in your mind? 
D: 
And it was a trailer also, and just cluttered, cluttered. It was an elderly couple that they had a garden, 
and they were active, but the house just cluttered. There was no room for anything, and I walked in with my 
bag and my purse, and wherever I would set it on a chair or that was full of everything. She had cats all over. 
She just did not want me to put my stuff on her things, so I would set it—try to get it on the floor someplace or 
that, but like I said, the house was just filthy, filthy, but I kept cleaning and organizing, and get to the sink and it 
was— 
I: 
She would let you do that? 
D: 
Yes, but just, you know, a little at a time. Just a little at a time, and another house I had a younger 
couple. It was a guy through the VA, and the house was so bad. It was so dirty, and I cleaned as much as I 
could. I would go home and I literally—I didn’t wanna touch anything ‘til I just got into the shower. It was so bad 
[40.59]. They had dogs and cats also in the house. You get the hair, but once I got the house in pretty good 
order, you know, after weeks and months, she started doing a little bit at a time, and it worked out—in fact, I’m 
still there to this day. She passed away, but I was still taking care of her husband, and the house—they don’t 
do anything hardly [laughing] in between. Some houses I go to twice a week, and they don’t do dishes even. 
The son lives with ‘em. No dishes are done in between that time, and it’s just a— 
I: 
So, you end up doing the clients and the sons dishes? 
D: 
Well, oh, yes. I do ‘em. I don’t—his bedroom is a total [laughing] disaster, and I don’t—even when the 
mother was alive, you know, she would just keep the door closed and tell me not to do anything with it. The 
son leaves the door open, but I don’t touch his. He’s in his 50s, and he works. But, yeah, no. He cooks for his 
dad. He takes care of his dad I must say, you know, very good that way, but doesn’t do any housework or, you

know, garbage can be overflowing, and it’s just dirty. But I try to keep it as clean as I can [laughs] and healthy. 
So, it’s healthy for ‘em. 
I: 
Sounds like a little bit like Di where you just kind of go with the—you just take it in stride and do what 
you need to do. 
P: 
Uh-huh. You have to. 
I: 
So, let’s talk a little bit about what’s—what do you think—or is there anything different about doing 
personal care in the northern country versus down state? 
D: 
Got a lot of traveling, you know, it’s 30 miles this way, [laughs] 30 miles that way, and wintertime 
driveways aren’t plowed and shoveled. A lotta times you have to park way down on the main road and walk in. 
I: 
How do you do that? I mean you’re talkin’ to a city girl, here. How do you get into the house? 
D: 
Well [group laughter], that’s another thing. These one people—that guy will leave for work before I get 
there, and he has a big truck, and he never even shovels the porch, you know, a little bit or something. So, I do 
that [38.31]. 
I: 
How do you get into the house? 
D: 
Well, you just—I wear big boots. I know where I’m going, and when it’s snow, you know, a lot like that, I  
have my big snow boots, and I walk through the snow. You get in there. And we’re not supposed to shovel, but 
I usually—I [inaudible] and sweep, but you know, you clean the porch on that. 
I: 
That’s a big difference. You get a lotta snow up here. 
D: 
Oh, yeah. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah, ya do. 
D: 
We have—many times I’ve driven to work or driven home at nights and it’s just—even the highways, 
you know, are really snow covered, and then people—older houses their water freezes or their septic’s are 
frozen. Their drains. 
Di: 
Yeah. 
D: 
You haul water out, you know, you can’t wash in the sink. You have to do it in the dish pan, take the 
water out. 
Di: 
Right.  
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Have you ever not been able to get to a client? 
D: 
I have never. I’ve always gotten there [37.26]. 
I: 
You’re like the postman. 
D: 
Yeah.  
Di: 
Yeah. 
D: 
I’ve never called in. P will call me sometimes, you know, or the night before if she knows we’re gettin’ a 
storm or something. “You know, if you can’t make it don’t go out.” But I’ve never, ever called and said I can’t go 
because of the weather.

I2: 
I was up here a couple of years ago in February, and they blocked all the highways, and they said you 
cannot—you have to turn around. 
D: 
Yeah, we have a few stretches that during the winter many, many times that highway will be closed 
because of the wind. The drifts, you know. 
I2: 
Oh, but there’s other ways to get places? 
D: 
Oh, yes. Yeah, you can get somewhere. 
I: 
So, you know some back roads? 
D: 
Uh-huh. 
I: 
Or you find other ways to get there. 
D: 
Find other ways, but most driveways in the morning you go are not shoveled or plowed. You have to— 
I: 
How ‘bout you? 
Di: 
I walked a couple times in snow storms because the clients have to be taken care of, and I had a client, 
and he lived on a wicked little hill, and the county—his little wicked hill was the last one to get plowed because 
they have to keep the county road [36.19] open first. All the main road, and that’s understandable. I walked I 
bet ya 5 miles from my house to his house to make sure he was taken care of. 
I: 
Five miles? 
Di: 
Probably, yeah. 
I: 
You mean you didn’t take a car at all. You walked from your own house? 
Di: 
No, because I did take a car once, and I got stuck [laughs] in the snow. 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You must have some really good clothes, like winter clothes. 
Di: 
Yeah, we do. You have to up here. 
D: 
Oh, yeah, and I have good boots. 
Di: 
You have to up here. 
D: 
You don’t dress for looks [laughing] when you’re gonna go out. Put your boots on. 
I: 
Wow. So, what happened to the guy on the hill? 
Di: 
He ended up with cancer and passed away. 
I: 
Okay. Do your clients ever venture outside? That’s gotta be a little— 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--scary. 
D: 
It can be, yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, what else is different about being up here? You mentioned the geographic—the distances. 
D: 
Yeah. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
16
I: 
Like you wouldn’t be able to walk 30 miles. 
Di: 
No. Oh, God, no. No. 
I: 
But is that sort of the average? 
Di: 
Sometimes you have clients in town where you’re able to walk if it’s not that far, but if you’re goin’ like to 
Foster City or to Norway or to Vulcan, you can’t. You have to be able to drive. 
I: 
How far are those places? What’s your farthest clients? 
Di: 
My furthest client was in Norway. 
I: 
How far away is that? 
DI: 
Fifteen miles. 
I: 
Okay. 
D: 
And I live up towards Crystal Falls, and one day a week I go to Alpha, which is 15 miles and Crystal 
another 10, then I’m back to [inaudible], and that’s [laughing] another 15, and then the other days I come down 
to the Iron Mountain area, which is 30 miles, and I go to Florence. Sometimes I Have a circle, Florence, Red 
Eagle, Iron Mountain, and by the time I get back home it’s 60 miles. 
I: 
Wow. So, how many clients do you see in a day when you have to cover that much distance? 
D: 
Well, three clients a day is probably the most that I’ve had. Mmm hmm. And the hours, you know, vary. 
Some two and four. I have one 9-hour shift during the week. 
I: 
So, for all of this work can you tell me how much you get paid? What’s your hourly rate? 
Di: 
Mine is $11 and hour. 
I: 
Okay. 
D: 
$10.75. 
I: 
Okay. And you do a lotta work. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
For that amount of money. 
Di: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Are you able to—you said your husband is construction— 
D: 
Well, now, he’s retired. I’m 73, my husband just tuned 79, and he’s still working too, but I can’t see 
where a person that is alone and has to run a household could really live—‘cause when you don’t—very few 
get 40 hours a week. 
Di: 
Yeah. Right. 
D: 
You just, mmm hmm. I mean there are times when you are maybe 30, 40 or something, but there’s so 
many shifts—days where you only get maybe 4 hours. You have two clients and each just 2-hour shifts. 
I: 
So, you have to go back and forth, back and forth— 
D: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
17
I: 
--between them. 
D: 
Yeah. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you mentioned earlier that you started this kind of work because you needed some just extra 
income— 
D: 
Just extra income. 
I: 
But it would never be your primary. 
D: 
No. Unt-uh. 
I: 
How ‘bout you, Di? Same thing? 
Di: 
Yeah. I’m semi-retired. My husband’s retired.  
I: 
But you had two incomes in the house? 
Di: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you wouldn’t have been able to make it on— 
Di: 
No. No. 
D: 
No. Ump-mmm [32.28]. 
I: 
Okay. So, you’re not in it for all of the monetary rewards? 
Di: 
No. 
D: 
[Laughs]. Yeah, it’s just a little extra. 
Di: 
It is a little extra. 
D: 
That’s all right. 
Di: 
I’m in it for the rewards of working with these clients, the elderly. I’ve had young clients too. 
D: 
Yeah. I’ve had some 30s. 
Di: 
It’s the rewards for me. 
I: 
It sounds like you’ve also found a niche—something you feel you’re good at. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. I did. 
I: 
You feel good about the work you do. 
Di: 
I do.  
I: 
Some pride in your work. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
D: 
It just makes ya happy. 
Di: 
It does. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
18
D: 
 I look forward to it [31.47]. 
I: 
So, do you have any plans to move on and do something else or to retire yourselves? 
D: 
It’ll be a little while. 
Di: 
It’ll be a while for me too just because I enjoy doin’ it. When you stop enjoy doing your job, that’s when 
you know it’s time to just completely retire. 
I: 
Yeah. But you’re both still enjoying it? 
D: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, let me just ask you about several other situations that may have come up. Have you ever got into—
done into a house and, well, you found some pretty unexpected things, you know, something you weren’t 
prepared for? 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Have you ever gone in and felt that the person needed care that you weren’t equipped or skilled to 
provide? That it was sort of over your skill level or you weren’t— 
Di: 
I have never found that. 
D: 
No. Uh-uh. 
I: 
You both have had quite a bit of training. 
Di: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
D: 
Yeah. Well, we have the CPR every year, and then we’ve had—Upcap has come in and given us a— 
Di: 
Done a lot of training with us. Like on—we had training on dementia. 
D: 
Yeah. 
Di: 
The different types. Parkinson’s [30.27]. The different types of things that we, you know, would deal 
with. We’ve had a lot of training in that, and a lot of it is common sense, you know. It is. It really is. 
I: 
Like what? Can you give some examples? 
Di: 
I think most everything is common sense [group laughter]. 
I: 
But the training is helpful? 
Di: 
It is very helpful. 
D: 
Oh, yes. 
DI: 
Oh, God, yes. The training is very, very helpful [29.57]. 
D: 
We had a mandatory Upcap training, and we had—we recently had dementia training where we 
received a certificate, and that was very, very helpful. 
I: 
And you find that you use what you learn? 
D: 
Oh, yes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
19
Di: 
Yeah. Right. 
I: 
And talk just a minute about the value of the training. What would it be like to do this kind of work 
without adequate training? 
Di: 
In some instances, it probably would be difficult, and when we’re in training we’re learning different 
things that we didn’t know about that will help us too. 
 
D: 
And there are things we forget that they’ll, you know, bring up, and I’m very happy that they reminded 
us of these things that you should do. 
I: 
One of the things that’s unique about direct care—home care work is that you don’t have a staff there to 
yell for help if you need help. 
Di: 
No, you don’t. 
I: 
Or to  help you figure things out. 
Di: 
No. 
I: 
And every situation’s a little different. 
Di: 
Different. 
D: 
Every one, everyone. 
Di: 
It is mostly one-on-one. One care giver to one client. So, yeah. It is different. 
D: 
And every client is different, you just have to— 
Di: 
They are. Every client is different. 
D: 
--just stop and think. Now, just try to do what they need and [group laughter [28.29], enough to get 
along. 
I: 
It sounds like you’ve even had a single client can be different from one day to the next. 
D: 
Oh,  yes. Yeah. 
Di: 
Oh, they can be. Yeah. 
D: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Your story with the knife— 
D: 
they have things going on with their family, and that you have to, you know, stay on that. 
I: 
Have you ever had a challenging family situation? You mentioned the one story about the fellow. 
D: 
But other than that, all of my family members of my clients have really been—I haven’t had any difficult 
ones I can think of [27.47]. 
Di: 
Usually you don’t because the families are so grateful for us to go in there, because we’re taking a big 
load off of them. 
I2: 
Has there been a situation with family or with a client where you thought that you were not prepared? 
Di: 
Mmm.

Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18

D: 
Ump umm. Oh. 
Di: 
Not to my knowledge. 
D: 
Not to mine either. 
Di: 
Not that I remember, no. 
I: 
You know, I’m thinking part of it is the common sense and you feel prepared because you are older, 
you ‘ve had a lifetime of experience to draw on. I don’t know if you’ve had children or not. 
D: 
I have children and grandchildren. 
Di: 
Yeah. I have grandchildren and great granddaughter [laughs]. 
D: 
I was lucky my mother lived to 94. She was older, and she was 40 when she had me, so she’s been 
gone 18 years already, but she lived to 94. My dad died young, so she was—I took care of her all the time 
[26.44], and that helped me to be better with my clients, more patience and understanding, you know, just 
understanding what they’re thinking and going. And then my clients help me to be better with my mother I think 
too. I do what I had to with my clients, so my mother needed that too. 
I: 
So, you drew on the experience going both ways. 
D: 
Umm hmm. 
I: 
So, we talked about the fact that there’s a huge direct-care worker shortage. 
D: 
Yes. 
I: 
And we really need to somehow recruit more direct care workers, and you know, turn to different—sort 
of widen the pipeline, and one of the things we’re thinking doing is going into high schools and doing tech 
programs there. But I’m thinking these 17-18-year old’s that don’t have the life experience that you have—what 
it might be like for them to face some of the situations you’ve— 
D: 
So, when I see younger people that need work, and I just don’t even know that these kids—they don’t 
know how to do—do dishes or prepare a simple meal or make a bed, you know, properly or something [25.28]. 
It’s just they need some training or, you know, and are they gonna wanna do it for that money. I mean these 
young kids just expect a lotta money. 
Di: 
They do. 
D: 
I just don’t know if some of ‘em, mmm hmm. 
I: 
I just wonder about the problem-solving skills, and you know, being able to roll with it ‘cause you’ve 
seen so much of this before? 
D: 
It’s experience and that too, but they have to do it to get  the experience ‘cause every client is different. 
You run into somethin’ all the time, and you have to just figure it out. You know, what to do, and like I said, 
don’t panic, and. 
Di: 
Yeah. You just never panic.  
D: 
Just stay calm, and when they’re— 
I; 
Yeah. I think you tend to underestimate or not underestimate but under describe the skills that you 
have. I mean the ability to stay calm [laughs], and to problem solve, and to get creative about things. Those are 
skills, right? Those are skills that not everybody has.

D; 
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm. 
Di: 
Right. And a lot of it comes with experience. You know, maybe after your first client and having to deal 
with some of the things you get that experience, and it’ll help you. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. So, before we take a little break here one other thing mentioned earlier about what’s 
different up here, is that you don’t necessarily have some of the resources available that some of the bigger 
cities or down state have. 
Di: 
Right. 
I: 
Like somebody mentioned public transportation. 
D: 
Public transportation, yes. 
I: 
Can you talk for a second about that? No public transportation? 
Di: 
No. I don’t know [laughing]. Not really, no [laughs]. 
D: 
I believe like at some senior centers or something— 
Di: 
There’s a senior center with the bus. They have a bus. 
D: 
They have a bus. 
Di: 
And I know the VA has a bus, but that’s it. 
D: 
Yeah. I mean there’s no other way. 
I: 
That’s it. 
Di: 
That’s it. 
I: 
Unless you have a car and can drive— 
Di: 
Drive, right. 
I: 
--there’d be no way to get to the clients. 
D: 
Oh, no, no. 
Di: 
Right. No. 
D: 
No. that’s one of the things you have to have a car. 
Di: 
Right. You do. 
D: 
Driver’s license and proof of insurance they wanna see. 
I; 
Yeah. And not be afraid of really icy winter road? 
D; 
No [laughs], uh-uh. 
I: 
Don’t let that stop you [22.44]/ 
D: 
No. 
Di: 
And most clients in the wintertime they don’t wanna go out, so they make their appointments for spring, 
summer, and fall. They’ll have you do their shopping—if you’re gonna go shopping for them, they’ll give you a 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
22
list and everything, you know, with the money, and then you write down on the log sheet you went shopping 
and how much it came to, what the client gave you, and you gave ‘em the change and the receipt. 
I: 
You’re kind of fearless, actually, I think. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm [laughing]. 
I: 
Well, we’ll just take a little break here. And then we’re going to move, just so you know, we’re gonna 
move into sort of the bigger social context and political context. So, think about what you want the world to 
know and the policymakers to know. 
Di: 
Oh, my, gosh [laughing]. 
I: 
This is your opportunity to cut loose and speak on behalf of— 
Di: 
I thought we were doing that before [group laughter]. 
I: 
No, you’re doing great. Good stories. Yeah. 
Di: 
See, we’ve both been there so long. We’ve had a wide range of clients. 
D: 
Oh, so many different. 
Di: 
So many different ones, and everyone is so different. 
I: 
It must keep your—just sort of open up your world to— 
Di: 
Mmm hmm, it does. 
I: 
--see so many different things. I don’t know how much variety there is up here in terms of cultural 
differences or ethnic or race? I don’t know. 
D: 
Oh, yeah. And Iron Mountain has the north side, the [laughing] Italians. 
Di: 
[Laughing] yup. 
I; 
You have the Swedes? 
I2: 
What’s your heritage? 
D: 
Czech and French. 
Di: 
Mmm hmmm. 
I2: 
I was expecting you to say Finnish. 
D: 
My dad was born in Czechoslovakia. 
I2: 
Do you have a lot of Finnish people here? 
D: 
More on the east end there. 
I: 
Now, is it true that the Fins and the Swede’s don’t get along that well? 
D: 
I don’t know [20.35]. 
I; 
Are you Finnish or Swedish? 
I2: 
I don’t wanna say [laughing]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18

Di: 
No, I’m married to a Swede-Fin, and I’m French [laughing]. 
D: 
You’re French, too.  My mom was French. 
I: 
And are you both Yoopers born and raised? 
Di: 
I am. 
D: 
I am, too. 
I2: 
So, do you think we’re second-class citizens being Trolls? [people who live below the bridge in the 
lower peninsula] 
D: 
No [group laughter]. 
Di: 
No, no. I tell my kids they’re Trolls because both my kids live in Lower Michigan. They’re Trolls 
[laughing]. 
I2: 
You know, my very good friend is—he’s from Baraga. 
Di: 
Oh, okay. 
I2: 
Whenever I talk to his dad he’s like, “You have to be born here.” [Inaudible]  
I; 
Actually, I’ve heard MB, who’s been here, what, almost 40 years, and he says people still don’t 
consider him a Yoope. He was born in Wisconsin. 
D: 
Okay. 
Di: 
Oh, that’s not that bad. 
I2: 
I’m ready. 
I: 
I guess I shouldn’t say his name on tape either [group laughter]. I’ll have to tell him that he’s going into 
the Library of Congress. Oops [group laughter]. Okay. So, we’re gonna talk now a little bit about the bigger 
picture—the social context. As we’ve already said there’s a huge shortage of direct care workers, and we’ve 
known for a long time that this was coming. We’ve seen the baby—we knew the baby boomers had been born, 
and they were gonna get older someday, so we’ve seen this coming. But we haven’t really prepared for it that 
well. Homecare is relatively new, and I mean it used to be done by—usually by the women and in the house 
but having paid workers come in to help people stay at home is relatively new. So, the working—how do we fix 
this? You know, how do we recruit more workers when the pay is so low, and the work is not that respected? 
Di: 
 Hmm that’s a tough one. 
D: 
That getting some training into the schools I do think would be a very good thing. 
Di: 
I agree with D there. 
D: 
So, people know about or you know, get an education about it. 
Di: 
Right. 
D: 
So, they know that there is a demand for it, and that it is a rewarding thing to do. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I; 
Is it—it’s rewarding, you’ve mentioned that a number of times. Is it important? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
24
D; 
Oh, it’s very important. 
Di: 
Very important. 
D; 
Very important [17.36]. 
I: 
Can you explain why? 
D: 
The quality of life for these elderly to be in their home instead of a nursing home, which is more 
expensive, and just— 
Di: 
They live longer in their home. They’re in their own environment, which prolongs their life. And I guess 
for me just to see the big smile on their face to know that they’re happy and grateful that I’m comin’ in to take 
care of them, and they’re able to stay at home, and they’re not losing their independence. Because a lotta 
people when they go into a nursing home, they feel like they’ve lost their independence, and people don’t 
wanna lose their independence, you know. 
I: 
I don’t. 
Di: 
I know I don’t either, and I think that’s one of the biggest thing, and they live much longer, and they live 
a happier life. 
D: 
They’re happy. 
Di: 
A very happy life. 
I; 
So, they live longer. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
They live happier. 
Di: 
Happier. Right. 
I: 
And they live more cheaply. I mean it’s cheaper— 
Di: 
It is much cheaper. 
D: 
Oh, yes. 
Di: 
Yes, it is. 
D: 
Just their minds stay more alert, and. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
D; 
‘Cause they have to do a few things themselves and keep their mind going [16.10]. 
I; 
So, let’s pretend I’m a policymaker, and you need to convince me that the work that you do has value, 
and that it’s not just important to your clients, but it’s important to this country, and our economy. Can you 
convince me that the work that you do is really important to this country? 
Di: 
Mmm, let me see [pause]. 
D: 
Oh, dear. 
Di: 
Okay. If one of your parents needed help and you were not able to afford to pay for help to come in, 
and you had to go through Upcap, and then you set the hours, that’s a big burden off of you, and your parents 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
25
are getting taken care of. They’re not in the nursing home, which costs a fortune, and your parents, they’re not 
losing their independence, and they’re happier to be in their home, their environment. Can you think of 
anything after that [laughs]? 
D: 
I can’t. 
I: 
So, let me put it in sort of a bigger population. You should be asking this question. You’re the 
epidemiologist, but [group laughter], so you know, thinking of the broader population, and we as a country we 
have all these baby boomers coming along, and who’s gonna take care of them, and who’s gonna pay for all 
that care, and you know, we recognize it’s better for the clients to stay at home, but as a nation we have to 
wrestle with this sort of bigger issue of who’s gonna take care of these people—all of these people? And, you 
know, yeah, we need more geriatric doctors, and geriatric social workers, and geriatric nurses, but people don’t 
usually say, yeah, we need more personal care workers. 
D: 
And there isn’t even gonna be enough room in nursing homes for all these people [13.58] if you put 
everybody in a nursing home. 
I2: 
The thing is most people who are gonna watch this or read about this, they don’t have any of the 
experiences that you have. So, taking that into account, do you have something to say that encompasses all of 
this—this whole part of elder care—this whole part of healthcare that you see? ‘Cause, you know, it’s like 
hidden from public view in many regards. 
Di: 
It is. 
D: 
I just don’t know if they realize when you go into a home, take care of a person, they’re there, you don’t 
know have they had an accident during the night? Is the bed all dirty, and you have this to clean up, and clean 
up the person, and maybe they just can’t even hardly walk to the kitchen, to the table, and sit there to get a 
meal, and you just help them and clean them up, and what else? 
Di: 
I’m gonna say so many people in this county need help without a doubt, and if you get the care workers 
to go into the homes—what was I gonna say [laughing]—losin’ it. No, I mean there’s a lotta people that need 
the help. We need to train people to be able to go into a home in any situation, anywhere in this country to take 
care of somebody, and it doesn’t have to be an elderly. It could be a young person. I’ve had young clients. I’ve 
had elderly clients, and I think with a lotta training, a lot of talking about it that would help [11.50]. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. So, yeah, if I’m the president of a company, and I have this problem, you know, I have all 
of these people that we have to provide care for somehow, some way, and I’m thinkin’ of all of my options, and 
what’s the most cost-effective and, you know, okay, we can have nursing homes, and then we have homecare. 
How are we gonna make homecare work, you know? Which one is better, which one is cheaper, which one--? 
Di: 
Well, homecare is much cheaper. It is much, much cheaper. 
I: 
And what’s it gonna take to make homecare functional? To make it work? 
Di: 
We’re gonna need the hours, you know, hours and then a budget, and training for people to come in, 
and young kids, maybe graduating from school, they don’t know what they wanna do, train ‘em, have ‘em 
come in. Sometimes I have trained girls, a couple a young girls who came in outta high school and went on to 
get nursing degrees. I mean it helps them to decide what they wanna do in life too, and that’s how I look at it. 
I: 
So, what I’m hearing you say though is what we need—one of the things we need to make this work 
is—are the homecare workers. 
Di: 
Right. Right. We do. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
26
I: 
They can’t very well do it without the homecare workers. 
Di: 
You can’t, no. 
D: 
You’ll just have to get it out there how important that job is, so people understand and know about it, 
and then to train people how to do it. 
I: 
Well, you’re helping to do that right now, to get that word out there. 
D: 
Yeah. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I would love to ask more questions. I’m mindful of the time, and we still have to get a photoshoot, 
you know. But, why don’t we just take a couple final minutes, and do you have any stories that you really 
wanted to tell that you didn’t get a chance to tell? 
Di: 
I had talked about several of my different clients that were challenges, but also very rewarding, so I 
think I’m good there, right now. 
I: 
Okay. D? 
D: 
Yeah, mine too. 
Di: 
I can tell you about one gentleman had. He passed away this past March. He was 69 when he passed 
away. He had a stroke at 46. Okay, and he was—I called him my nervous Nelly, because if—it was me and 
one other caregiver there for two shifts, and his wife worked, and if we were 5 minutes late—if either one of 
us—he was havin’ a panic attack. I mean he actually called the police a couple times. That’s how nervous he 
was [8.40]. Yeah. He has a phone by his bed, and in by his chair, and we’d go in and early in the morning—7 
o’clock was the shift—7 to 9—have to transfer him from the bed to his wheelchair, and then from the 
wheelchair to the bathroom to wash up, get dressed, to the wheelchair out to the dining room table for 
breakfast and meds, back to the bathroom so he could do his thing, and then back out into his recliner. There’s 
a lotta transferring, but he was very nervous, very nervous, and I think it was part of his stroke that he had 
when he was 46. And if you were late, I mean he was  panicking. If I was gonna be 5 minutes late, I would call 
him and say I’m gonna be 5 minutes late today, so he would know I’m on my way and not to call the police 
because he actually did call the cops a couple times because he—somebody hadn’t shown up. Okay, so there. 
I: 
So, you need people who know how to handle situations. 
Di: 
Handle situations like that, yeah.  
I; 
Right. Any final words to the public or the world about personal care work? 
Di: 
It’s very, very, very rewarding. The rewards outdo the challenges on any given day. 
D: 
You forget about the few bad things that happen. 
I: 
Things that happen. You make friendships. You become part of a family. 
D: 
I have more brothers and sisters [laughing] now. You feel like you do. 
Di: 
You feel like you do. 
D: 
Yeah. 
Di: 
Yeah. You do. It starts off as you’re a caregiver, and then it builds into a friendship and the next thing 
you know, you’re into the family, and we stay with our clients throughout the whole ordeal. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

D: 
And if they end up in the nursing home, I keep going visiting them. Some have been in the nursing 
home 6, 7 years, and I still go regularly— 
Di: 
Right. 
D: 
--to visit them. Spend time with them, yeah. 
I: 
And how about when they die? How do you handle that? 
D: 
[Sighing] yes. And that’s another thing— 
Di: 
that’s a hard thing. 
D: 
It’s very, very hard, but you know all of your clients are either gonna end up in the hospital, nursing 
home, or they’re gonna die, and there’ve been a few that have been really, really hard, you know. In fact, some 
I still think of and I just get real teary-eyed thinkin’ about ‘em [5.53]. 
I: 
I don’t wanna make you cry, but can you tell us, maybe the one that touched you the most? 
D: 
Um 
I: 
That was hard? 
D: 
Probably the one I said had the stroke and was paralyzed on that side with her husband. Her husband 
died first, and she ended up in a nursing home, and many, many years she was there, but she just was just a 
little sweetheart and her mind was so good. You know, she just would ask me about my grandkids, and she’d 
remember their ages, and she was just really nice. And then I had one guy that I only had for a few years, and 
for the VA, and he passed away, and I wasn’t there. It happened a morning before I went in a shift, and he 
died. But he was just so kind, and just so happy when I came and did his shopping, and he was just thrilled, 
you know. He’d listen to music. He liked old country music, and we’d listen. He’d have that on all the time. To 
this day now, I hear that music and I [laughing] think about him. Yeah. 
I: 
So, those were hard losses? 
D: 
Oh, yes. They’re very, very hard, but you deal with it. 
Di: 
You do. Mmm hmm. 
D: 
I’ve come in the morning, and I found one client that was deceased, and the woman I’d been with for 
quite a while, and her husband was there, and he had a little dementia and tried to get the—well, the 
ambulance. They knew she was gone but tried to keep her husband in the bedroom and talk to him. So, I didn’t 
want him out seeing her, you know, in the chair. She had deceased during the night in her chair in the living 
room, and I didn’t want him to see them carry her out or that, but yeah [3.50]. Like I say, you know they’re 
gonna be gone someday. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And so, in a situation like that you stay calm? 
D: 
Oh, yes. Yeah. 
I: 
You help the person. 
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And then what happens when you walk out the door. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Donna M. Aberly and Diane Saari. 7.19.18 
 
28
D: 
Then it’s just woof, you know [cry/laughs]. Sometimes you breakdown. Oh, a few, yes, I’ve really, really 
cried, just sobbed sometimes, but during the thing it’s just automatic. You just do it. Yeah. 
I: 
Well, you’re gifted at what you do, you know, it’s like nursing or other helping professions where you 
just—first responders. You do what you have to do. 
D: 
Mmm hmm 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I’m gonna close there and let K do his thing, but I want to thank you so much for this interview and 
thank you again for the really important work that you do, and I appreciate you trying—you know, speaking on 
behalf of other personal care workers and trying to get the word out there. 
D: 
Just hope that we can get more workers. Yeah. I didn’t realize such a shortage. To need so many. 
Di: 
Right. 
I: 
Yup. Well, we’ll just keep, you know, moving forward— 
D: 
Yeah. I just took for granted. You know, we do it [group laughter]. 
Di: 
Yeah, we do it, and [inaudible]. 
I: 
I think that should be your motto. We just do it. 
D; 
Yeah. We just do it [laughs]. 
Di: 
You know, it comes easy to the two of us maybe because we’ve been there forever, it seems like. And 
we don’t panic. We just—everything just kicks in. 
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You know, it’s interesting. I think every single person we’ve interviewed has that same trait. We just do 
it. 
Di: 
Yeah. 
I: 
No big deal, we just do it. 
Di: 
It’s no big deal, really [group laughter]. 
D: 
Every house you go into, you find where everything is, it’s so nice after you’ve been there a while, and 
you automatically go. You know exactly what they want and where everything is, how they want it folded, 
where to put it, and [laughs], yeah. 
Di: 
Right. 
I: 
You must be also—you know, there are certain characteristics I think of personal care workers we’ve 
noticed. And one of them I think is that you like that diversity. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
D: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You know, being able to go in and see different things and different clients and different people and 
different—the Italians [group laughter].

D: 
Yeah, 
Di: 
[Laughing] oh, yeah. 
D: 
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. 
I: 
But that’s something, you know, not everybody would appreciate that diversity, but you are definitely 
not like desk-job people. 
D: 
It’s a different--- 
Di: 
And you know, this job, it’s not for everyone. It isn’t. 
D: 
No. 
Di: 
I mean you have to try it and experience it to see if it is [.58] the kinda job for you. And I have been told 
by client’s, families, and I’ve had recommended our agency to a couple families, and they say, “To do this 
kinda work you have to be a special person, because it is hard work.” And I have heard that from people that 
have never had to deal with anybody like this—us before, you know—know home healthcare. 
I: 
Well, I agree. You are very special people. 
Di: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
All right. Well, thank you so much, and I’m going to— 
Di: 
Thank you. 
I: 
--close this interview and let K take is photos. 
Di: 
Do his thing [group laughter]. 
I: 
Yes. Let me scoot out of his way, and are you going to want to take pictures in here or--? 
I2: 
Just two quick pictures in here.
