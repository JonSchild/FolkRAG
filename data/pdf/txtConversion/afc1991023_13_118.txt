Part of a series of shots of signs for Emma's market. 
The photos are continued on BCF217991-11. The signs are 
a series that a northbound driver on US Route 30 sees 
as he approaches the market. They were painted (when? 
probably during the last four or five years, to guess) 
by Sal Jr. Sal was proudest of the first sign, with the 
corncupia (see also closeup; frames 31-3). Wide shots 
intermingled with the closer shots will provide
