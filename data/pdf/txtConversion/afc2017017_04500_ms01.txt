(00:00:00) KK: Alright, today is Friday, February 16th and we are interviewing Justin Bogaty at 
Veramar Vineyards. Justin, could I get you to tell me your full name with spelling? 
JB: Justin Bogaty. J-u-s-t-i-n. B as in boy, O as Oscar, G as in girl, A as in apple, T as in 
Tom, Y as in yo-yo! (Justin laughs.) You can tell I do that a lot. 
(00:00: 26) KK: (laughs) And where are we now? 
JB: We’re at Veramar Vineyard, which is the foundation company of what we have now 
morphed into which is Bogaty Family Wine Group. This is what we consider to be our 
headquarters of the other two wineries that are in our family operation. 
(00:00:53) KK: Alrighty, what is your current job title? 
JB: Uh, winemaker is uh I think is my predominant job title. But, I’m also a family 
member and owner here. So um, winemaking is what I do 99% of the time, but then there’s this 
1% where its general manager, vineyard worker, broom sweeper. It’s all those other things as 
well.

(1:35) KK: Hmhm, and then, how did you come to be interested in wine? Was it in your family 
life? Or something you came into as an adult? 
JB: For us and for my family. Wine is something that really…wine is something that 
really my grandfather introduced us to. He was an immigrant. He came in through Ellis 
Island uh…and uh, he grew up in the Depression age. And, wine was a luxury and very 
expensive. And so, being from…most Italian immigrants cared for wine, liked for wine, 
and couldn’t afford to buy it, so they made it themselves. So, I learned things from him. 
Now, he made it on a very small scale as in it was for his own personal consumption. 
And also to go around and brag to other Italians that made wine as well. So they would— 
In those days, they met in the barber shop (Justin laughs slightly) and drank wine in the 
barber shop. ‘Cause that was the communal place to come do the exchange! And when 
you were in that kind of era, haircuts were much frequent than they are now. And, so 
even if you didn’t get a haircut, you would still be involved with the barber shop going 
on. So that’s where the passion, ideas, I guess, came from. And it was really passed on to 
my father, who decided at some point that he would take us back to our roots. And we 
trace our lineage, our family we can still trace, owns and operates a vineyard in Italy still.

And um, so we’re able to trace our lineage back to that. Although, we’ve been back, we 
visited. We don’t really know them— 
KK: Yeah 
JB: —they’re not like—even though they’re relatives, they’re not really family per se 
because you don’t know them. They recognize us, we recognize them from the 
name perspective. But that’s really all there was to the relationship. Um but, he wanted to 
bring us back to that roots and create something to be able to be passed on to not just my 
generation, but onto the next and onto the next. And weirdly, we’re constantly looking at 
this as…as I was saying its not just a straight-line business. It’s really—we’re creating a 
legacy to pass on to future grandchildren and their grandchildren. And so everything that 
we do is constantly evaluated under those kind of glasses. Call them rose glasses I guess, 
rose-colored glasses if you want, but everything is really looked at…even though this is 
where we’re at today, is this the best choice for the next two generations? 
KK: Yeah 
(00:05:09) JB: I don’t think we can get. That may be skiing ahead of your skis, now that they 
Olympics are going on. But, that’s really as far as we look and evaluate our business. What are 
we doing for the next? And how are we proposition it for the next? … so, oh, I’m gonna have 
to—just two seconds! 
KK: No worries! No worries! 
(00:05:34) 
[Break: Justin and Kaitlyn take a quick break to pour the filtered wine 
back into the petit manseng still.] 
(00:05:46) KK: And then, um, what did you do before? Have you always just done wine? 
JB: No, at least for me, this has been an evolution. And uh, Wine had always been a 
passion, like I said I learned it from my grandfather, I learned my appreciation of it from 
him. (Justin elaborates discussing how in his family if you were under the age of 7, you 
were served wine with water as a 50/50 blend, after 7 you were served straight wine. He 
discusses how prohibition affects the practice of drinking wine in the United States. He 
discusses how his family’s winery has evolved from selling 500 to 10,000 cases of wine 
over the course of 18 years. States that this is proof of Virginia wine’s growth. He moves 
into telling how he became involved with Virginia Wine with his parents Jim and Della. 
Jim and Della started their wine business as a retirement gig and asked him to come home 
from Chicago where he was one of many Vice Presidents’ for American Express. After 6 
months of discussing it with his family, he decided that if they were going to do this 
‘They were going to do this right.’ Justin went back to school for viticulture at University 
of California-Davis and the difficulties of going back to school after so long away from

it.) And I tell people all the time, and I had NO idea, this was my life’s calling. It really 
was. 
KK: uh hmm 
(00: 11:56) JB: It was something that you don’t know you have in you until you do it one time. 
And then, you’re doing it and you just find that it’s IN you. Where it came from, I have no idea? 
But, it’s here. It gives me goosebumps to talk about it now. [Justin shows me his arm as an 
example and there were goosebumps.] And I can’t stop thinking about it. (Gives multiple 
examples about how making wine has shaped how he experiences everything now regarding 
foodways.) 
[Justin quickly checks the filtering buckets of wine] 
JB: Sorry— 
KK: No worries, no worries!

#ElCapitán #JamesCharlesWineryAndVineyard #WineAsPassion #WineAndFamily 
(00:13:05) KK: Alrighty, so you mentioned your family is from Virginia? Did your grandfather 
settle in Virginia initially? How did you guys make your way to Virginia? 
JB: No, no. (Justin laughs.) My grandfather is from Pittsburgh. (Justin explains that  Italian 
immigrants typically settled in large city areas and Pittsburgh was one of those areas. He’s  not 
sure why his grandfather chose Pittsburgh, but that’s where Justin spent his summers from 5- 16 
years old. Mentions that his grandfather called him Angelo—meaning little angel. Justin jokes    that 
for years he thought that name was somewhere on his birth certificate, which he later found out 
was not to be so.  
(00: 14:52) JB: (Discusses that this was the mentality that his grandfather came from and that it 
still plays a large role in their family regarding who they are. He uses as examples of this wines that 
pay homage to both sides of his family at their other family run winery ‘James Charles’. 
Their ‘1913’ wine pays tribute to his grandfather who came to the United States in 1913. The 
other homage wine is ‘Capitán’ pays tribute to his mother’s father, Bill Brant, who once owned 
the largest cattle ranch in Kansas. Brant was known as the “Sky King.” During a major flood, 
Brant used his airplane to rescue stranded and injured people from the El Capitan train in Kansas 
and died in plane crash.) But because we’re a family-based business and we want to carry it into 
the next, we want to make sure that they know where the roots where…from. 
(00:16:05) KK: What do you enjoy about your work? 
JB: Ev, ev, …everything— (Justin’s demeanor completely shifts from being enthusiastic 
and passionate to introspective. And reflective.) Um..uh, ooo, big emotion. 
KK: (Kaitlyn laughs softly and encouragingly) Yeah, I know it’s a big question. 
JB: Yeah, everything. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

KK: Everything. 
JB: Its, uh, transformative… (Justin pauses as emotion begins to fill him.) Uh, wow. I 
didn’t expect this. 
KK: It’s alright. Take your time. 
JB: Uh, it’s a uniq…ue… position to be involved in… I love creating. I can’t… stop it. And, 
its. Fun. To do it for me. (We take a small break and I turn off the recorder so that Justin can regain 
control of his emotions. Justin gives me the okay to start recording again.) 
(00:17:00) JB: And, I love them, my family, as much as I hate them. I love them too. Probably 
more emotional for me now. Because they’re getting older in age. My father is having a hard 
time with cancer. And, I just wasn’t expecting that. (Justin’s voice breaks on and off throughout 
this from strong emotion.) Sorry. 
(We take another small break and I turn off the recorder. Justin tries to apologize again 
for the strong display of emotion and gives me the okay to record.) 
KK: It’s no worries. 
JB: Sorry, hoooo, I just wasn’t expecting that. 
KK: It’s no worries. It’s no worries. 
JB: But, I love everything. (Justin discusses how it’s not every day that you want to get up 
out of bed and go to work, and how much he loves to create and takes pride in making 
wine. Justin jokes and asks for the next question.) 
#HardestPartInWinemak ing #Stress #Work Family #PeopleRelying 
#WinemakerAndOwnerProblems #MotherNatureWorries #MotherNatureKicksButt 
(00:18:19) KK: (Kaitlyn laughs.) So what’s the hardest part? 
JB: I think the hardest part is the stress. Um, is the, um, the fact that so many families’ 
lives are tied to our success. (Justin elaborates about how that sort of stress keeps you up 
at night asking ‘Did we do our best, did we do everything we possibly can?’) I mean 
everybody that we work with is intimately involved and we’re connected. It’s not just a 
guy in the field harvesting for you. This is a guy that I know that has children, that has a 
wife, that has people that count on him to provide. And that, that responsibility rides on 
me as the winemaker and owner of this place. I think all of them know and can feel that 
that passion. And, I think that’s why we get better work, better quality. We look for that. 
(These are not just employees to Justin. He considers them family members.) When you 
have so many people relying on you, its very stressful. And mother nature can kick you in 
the butt anytime she wants! And, quite often does…and, uh, I think that’s the biggest 
challenge of this.

(00:20:26) KK: Alrighty, um, so what other hats do you wear? You’ve mentioned, you know 
winemaker, you’ve mentioned owner… 
JB: Uh, label designer. Uh, website, software guy. IT guy. Uh, re-repair. It just runs the 
gambit. Most people who run a business would recognize the business aspect of it. And 
um, you know, it’s the phone call when the alarm goes off in the middle of the night. 
(Justin discusses that this is where you wear all the different hats to move the entire 
organization through. He discusses how people that work for him become family 
members and were some of his employees have moved on to and that they still keep in 
close contact with them.) And these people that help us are our family. And that’s a 
blessing and a curse. Uh, uh…families tell you how it is! 
KK: (Kaitlyn laughs.) Yeah, they do! 
JB: And uh, (Justin laughs) which which is the curse part of it! But, the blessing part is 
that not many people will tell you the truth… and that’s what you expect out of them. 
#WineTraining #UCDavis #ViticultureProgram #HandOn #CulturalGrowingTraditions 
#FermentedOnions 
(00:22:38) KK: Yeah. Um, so what kind of training did you go through? I know you mentioned 
that you went to UC-Davis and then your grandfather also taught you some about wine… 
JB: Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah…that was the amount of training and then it’s been hands-on, 
learning-as-you-go method. (Justin discusses pros and cons of both. His grandfather 
taught from principles and practices, but what he lacked was the chemical understanding 
of what was transpiring and how culture played a role in how wine was made with his 
grandfather. From UC-Davis, he learned the technical and scientific side of winemaking. 
He goes in-depth on discussing how UC-Davis taught wine from this standpoint and uses 
a paper that his professor wrote on fermented onions and how it gave understanding to 
the chemical process going on.) 
(Quickly break to check the filtering buckets.) 
#BruceZoecklein #VAWineTorchbearer #VirginiaTech 
(00:25:58) JB: (Discusses that if he could go back, he would go someplace else to study wine.) 
But, we’ve been very blessed here in our state and I don’t even know if people know his name, 
but um…outside of our realm…but uh, we have Dr. Bruce Zoecklein here. And the funny thing 
is, I was a Virginia kid that came back to Virginia to go to UC-Davis. And then I get out there 
and I’m start reading all the periodicals and literature. And, its all written by this guy named 
Bruce Zoecklein out at Virginia Tech. And who knew, he was in my own backyard when we 
started all of this. (Bruce Zoecklein is a prolific investigator in viticulture and has one ‘of the 
best palates in the United States’ according to Justin. Justin discusses how Dr. Zoecklein has 
really carried the torch for the Virginia wine industry regarding wine quality through hosting 
wine roundtables, holding discussions for remedying quality, advocating for bridging the gap 
between ‘what’s in the book and reality.’ Justin holds him in high regard as an ‘incredible man’

and that Virginia is blessed to have him. Justin seems to worry about him not being as well 
known as he should be because he is holds Emeritus status at Virginia Tech). 
(00:28:25) KK: Quick question… 
JB: Yeah?! 
KK: Do you know how to spell his last name? 
JB: Oh, I can look it up for you!...but its um. It’s um, Z… (Justin laughs) his nickname is 
the Crazy Russian. It’s like Z-O-K-L-I-E-N. I think? But, I can look it up for you. 
KK: (Kaitlyn laughs) Oh, that is much different than how I spelled it. (Kaitlyn laughs 
again.) That’s why I asked. 
JB: (Justin laughs) That’s a tough name too!

#ProhibitionCulture #VAWines 
(00:28:58) KK: So what’s been like the unexpected part of your job? 
JB: The unexpected part is that really that uh, every year, every vintage, mother nature 
will throw a curve ball…that you. Just. Had. NO. idea was coming your way. 
KK: (Kaitlyn laughs) 
JB: (Justin discusses how nature and weather plays such an important role in winemaking 
and that these are the things you learn to deal and manage with, especially as a Virginia 
winemaker. He discusses that it’s a matter of ‘Are you prepared?’ It’s a learning curve 
that most people have to get over when they come from other places to make wine in 
Virginia. He compares growing wine in Virginia to other wine regions like Napa and 
Sonoma Valley in California. He states that Virginia wines have to understand that they 
won’t be the same as those wines.) The reality is that mother nature is going to throw 
something at us…very quickly. So if you’re ready now, now might be the time to harvest 
it. Even though, you think you can push it 10 more days, or 4 more days, or 3 more days. 
You probably can’t. And it takes experience to realize that she’s coming for ya, it’s a 
freight-train. You just don’t know where she’s coming from or what direction she’s 
coming from. And um, that’s our biggest challenge. 
(00:31:32) JB: And then, um. Probably the seconded biggest challenge is because this has been 
such a growing industry so fast, keeping up with the pace of demand. And putting enough fruit 
in the ground to meet as much demand as much as the customer is requiring is the always the 
biggest, the other biggest challenge. (Justin discusses how he feel like his family business always 
feels like it’s under construction, needing to buy more equipment and land, and that they took a 
gamble on starting another winery [James Charles] and their larger business [Bogaty Family 
Wine Group].)

(00:32:28) JB: It really is a labor of love. (He lists the process of making just a single bottle of 
wine…’You get your money back one bottle at a time.’ States that it is a tedious business, maybe 
not if you have millions of dollars. But, for a family business, it’s tedious. He thinks that this is a 
side of the Virginia wine industry that really isn’t seen by many.) 
(00:33:58) JB: (Justin discusses how much the Virginia wine industry has morphed. And that 
despite that Virginia is technically one of the first states to grow wine, that we’ve really only 
been growing wine for the past 30 years. He also indicated Prohibition as being an influence on 
Virginia wine. 
[Brief pause lasting a few seconds to pour filter wine back into the still] 
#FutureOfBogatyWines #Next5to10Years #DaughterTakesOver #MaryWashingtonUniversity 
(00:34:59) KK: So where do you see yourself in the next 5 to 10 years? 
JB: (Justin laughs) If not dea..add…! 
KK: (Kaitlyn laughs) 
JB: …then uh, no uh, I hope that my daughter who’s away at college will be able to come 
back to play an integral role in what we do. And, um, uh. I see myself still doing 
this but just, doing it in a slightly different capacity. Um, the winemaking I love so 
much— um, that I hate being in the office and love being in here. So, I don’t ever want to 
leave here. They may relegate me to a little corner with a little tiny desk and um, I’ll be 
okay with that. (Justin and Kaitlyn laugh.) 
KK: Mmmhmm… 
JB: It’s funny, like even today, —she’s down at Mary Washington—she sent me a text 
this morning: ‘I’m in econ class and, uh the teacher is talking about’…let me pull it up 
here. (Justin pulls out his cell phone and find the text his daughter sent to read/show to 
Kaitlyn.) –the teacher is talking about ‘expense and products’ and he put up a picture of 
Veramar wine. (Kaitlyn laughs.) That’s, that’s fun…I…I texted her back and I said ‘— 
that if the professor wants me to come down and teach the class, I’ll be glad too.’ 
(Kaitlyn laughs.) 
JB: It’s kinda cool that it’s not just in our area. (He elaborates that he like that there’s 
other people thinking about the business side of Virginia wine. Justin’s assistant 
winemaker, Eric Hamilton, pokes his head into the small office to ask a question.) So, 
hold on one second. Let me catch my assistant. 
KK: Oh, no worries. 
[Brief pause for Justin step outside of the office to answer his assistant winemaker’s questions, 
can slightly hear their conversation in the background]

(00:37:34) KK: So what special clothes, gear, tools do you use for your job? 
JB: What was that last part? I’m sorry… (Kaitlyn repeats the question.) 
JB: Um, clothes is anything waterproof. (Kaitlyn laughs.) When my assistant, Eric who 
came here. He basically summed up winemaking in a couple of key words: One is ‘to 
move stuff’ and the second is ‘to clean stuff.’ By cleaning, we are using water. That is 
probably the most succinct job description…’to move stuff.’ (Justin lists the various 
workflows that they employ and how the product requires a lot of transferring, as well as 
a lot of cleaning. He discusses how much technology has changed how people grow and 
make wine.)

(00:39:42) JB: It’s not just physically going out there and scouting. We’re employing the 
technology and the gear that we can to craft a better wine. It’s all about crafting a better wine. 
(Justin points out that Kaitlyn should look at his desk, where she is sitting at, at the various wine 
magazines there [i.e. Wine Enthusiast, a fermentation magazine]. He talks about how they need 
to be constantly striving to be the best.) You have to keep doing it. I tell people all the time, the 
minute I’m done is the minute I don’t want to learn anymore. 
KK: yeah, 
JB: that’s the day, I gotta hang it up. The day I say it’s no longer in me, that I can’t 
continue because the passion then has waned…and moved on. And um, so that’s what I 
look for. Constantly. And I think, the people that are really carrying us forward, you’ll 
you’ll — they seem a little like mad scientist… (Justin and Kaitlyn both laugh) 
…hope…hopefully I’m not portraying that too much today. (Justin jokes about how he 
appears during harvest time ‘my hair is ON fire’ because of how much information, 
input, and decisions that he has to make during that specific time period.) 
KK: mmhmm… 
JB: At harvest time, we call it ‘crush’ not just because that’s what we’re doing. But, it’s 
because it’s such a physical crush of your time. And we live and we— are here…if we 
have to stay 24 hours, 48 hours, to get it done in order to get the best, it’s what we do. 
And, I’m fortunate that I’m surrounded by other people that share that same belief. And 
um, my assistant Eric Hamilton, he just has that in him. It burns through him like it 
burns through me. And, I’m blessed to have him. And there’s a guy that had no 
experience, a house painter that found this passion. Now, it burns through him like it 
burns through me. (Justin discusses how much he trusts and relies on Eric because of this 
shared passion and cracks a joke about how he’d be there, but maybe 15 minutes late.) 
And that’s just such a blessing to have someone like that.

(00:43:41) KK: Yeah. What do you wish people understood about your work? 
JB: I don’t think people understand the physicality of winemaking. They think that we sit 
around smell wine, taste wine, and then we go ‘Oh, it’s not ready. Send it back.’ And 
that’s it! But, it is a tremendously physical job. As described by Eric, its moving     stuff.  
(Justin jokes that this isn’t the work Eric uses, implying that he uses a curse word 
typically in its place. Justin and Kaitlyn laugh.) It’s moving stuff and cleaning stuff. But, 
it’s an extremely physical job. (Justin lists all the various surgeries that he has gotten the 
past few years related to wine injuries [i.e. 3 back surgeries, 1 neck surgery, 1 hernia 
surgery, 1 knee surgery]. He states that this is because of the size of operation, as well as 
other things that the only way to get things done is ‘pure brute force’.)   
JB: And, uh, that has definitely taken a toll on my body! And, I don’t think people see that 
aspect of it. (He uses as an example that when people come help them to bottle for a 
single day that these people are surprised by the amount of physical labor that goes into 
making wine. He often tells them that’s just one day, that’s there’s a whole other 360 days 
that got them to this point. He thinks that this is the first time the light goes off in their 
heads where they truly appreciate the amount of work that goes into making a single bottle 
of wine. Wine for Justin is more than just a liquid, its something ‘magical that other 
people created for you.’ He describes the sensory/time/memory experience that taste 
evokes in our everyday lives and if his wine’s do that, he’s done his job.) I just don’t think 
people realize how much it takes to getcha there. Soo…but, it’s fun. It’s fun trying. 
KK: (Kaitlyn jokes about a possible solution to this dilemma that he can always try 
outlining it and Justin laughs.) 
(00:47:10) KK: I know we’ve talked about this a little bit before, but what’s changed about 
Virginia wineries? 
JB: Oh, oh, so much has changed. It was in the beginning truly a mom-and-pop industry 
where one of those members had a passion for wine, they wanted to make wine, they 
wanted to do it in Virginia, where it was their home. It started there. It was transformed by 
these 13-14 wineries that we kinda talked about [Justin refers to our informal discussion, 
see field-note] in the late 80’s, early 90’s. And then, it was transformed again by another 
set of group that really came in. Um, those people in those 13 wineries said it can be 
done and we can make quality wine here in Virginia. And then, these other torchbearers 
came in and then they picked it up and said, ‘Okay! If you can do  it, I can do it!’ And, 
those two groups of people fed off of one another for a long time. 
JB: (Justin discusses how in the past 5 years in particular the Virginia wine industry has 
boomed going from 100-200 over night. He states that the people getting involved with it 
now are a different level of people [i.e. Eric Trump, Patricia Kluge, Belfort Furniture]. 
He discusses how these are big companies with big money and that pretty soon we will 
probably see a Gallows or Kendall-Jackson in Virginia because Virginia is getting too much 
notice. He points out that the Zonin family, a world-leading prosecco, has put a claim on 
some land here in Virginia.) So we’re in this weird kind-of pioneering stage, where it 
went from mom-and-pop to transitioning into a full family-run business to other multi-
million national corporations coming in and taking a stake in the Virginia wine.

[Justin quickly runs out to pour the filtered wine back into the still for more filtering and is back 
in seconds before Kaitlyn can pause recorder.] 
(00: 50:10) JB: So, I hope that explains it. I mean, it’s changing. It’s not good or it’s not bad. It’s 
changing. It’s its evolving. And we hope to stay as we are: a premium producer, family-oriented. 
And, we have goals and ambitions to beeee…generational. Um, and uh, hopefully we have our 
ambitions are to be transformative for Virginia as well. We just don’t look at it quite the same. I 
think, in more. I think that other people are starting to recognize that. I mean, every wine,   at least 
for us, we’re not just looking at how we’re stacking up against our local competitors.  
KK: Mmmhmm 
JB: We’re looking at how do we stack up against international competitors. Uh, if you 
evaluate this petit manseng from Virginia, it better be so good quality wise that it 
competes against the greatest petit manseng coming out of Europe. The same thing with 
chardonnay. (Justin discusses that while Virginia chardonnay tastes and is structurally 
different from European chardonnays, that ‘different isn’t bad, but it better be quality to 
carry us forward’. Justin states that if we’re not putting 90 point wines in the bottle every 
single time, ‘we’re not gonna grow’.) 
JB: …It’s what we strive for. And, some of it is the critics catching up to— what we’ve 
been doing. Because, it does taste different! What Virginia produces is somewhere an 
amalgamation between California and Europe. It’s like right. in. the. middle. And not just 
physically as in the middle. But… (Justin’s cell phone begins to ring)— the wines and the 
styles are in the middle. 
KK: Mmmhmm… 
JB: And so, critics have always lent themselves to the more European standard until 
Steven Spurrier, um, reinvented that that later in life (Justin silences phone) and there’s a 
great film about it called ‘Bottle Shock’. But that’s where the tide turned towards 
California being the producer. And so, there was these two opposing style of wines: 
European style and New World style. And, we fall right in the middle of that. And, I 
don’t know if people quite…understood that in the beginning. And so, its taken a little bit 
a while for the critics to understand that its not California, its not European. It’s Virginia. 
And, it’s something unique. 
(00:54:20) JB: (Justin elaborate on how special Virginia wine is and establishes that in particular 
the Shenandoah Valley is special.) I will say for us even more uniquely different right here, 
where we’re standing today at Veramar, there’s just something magical about this place and how 
its evolved through history. Uh, you know, the Blue Ridge is on to at least where we’re standing 
right now on my right side and the Allegany on the other side. We talked about wine production 
and the famous regions you know (Justin points out that all the big wine regions are in

commonly located in valleys and that there’s a reason for that.) And then, right where we’re at in 
the Shenandoah Valley, right here in this particular spot where Veramar is placed. We are very 
fortunate. We’re surrounded by the [Shenandoah] river. If you Google Earth us, on this piece of 
property, you will see the river surrounds this piece of property on three-sides. It’s kinda weird! 
That river acts as an insulator. The properties of air change a lot faster than water. (Justin uses 
the week’s current weather as an example; it was 70 degrees the day before on February 15th, yet 
for the next day on the 17th they were predicating snow. He states that the river acts as an 
insulator and comments about ‘Rain-Shadow’ effect.) 
(00:55:31) JB: And then this piece of property [Veramar], was actually, we know all created by 
the river at one point. Because, second product that we growww, we like to laugh about it, is we 
grow river rock. (Justin and Kaitlyn both laugh at the joke.) And that river rock will just pop out 
of the ground for no reason. (Justin corrects that they actually know the geological reason and 
offers a brief explanation.) So, um, we take these wonderful river rocks. These white round huge 
river rocks. And, we line the bottom of the vineyard in them. And that’s what makes us unique 
here. In that, those river rocks hol—reflect light, they’re white, they hold onto heat. Um, that 
helps us mature our vineyard in a different way than my next door neighbor’s vineyard matures. 
And, its unique and special and magical only to this place. 
(00:56:24) JB: And so, what I encourage people to do. If you want to experience a place, have a 
memory of a place, then you need to come and do it and taste it right here on site, on the spot— 
where you can see and smell and feel all the tactile things that compose this wine. The fog and 
how it rolls off of the river and collects on the mountain. Where the rain comes, what it smells 
like after you cut the grass and it starts to sprinkle, what the flowers smell like coming off the 
grapevine. Those are things you can only get on site and only get here. 
[Break: Justin and Kaitlyn can pour the filtered wine back into the still, can hear the clatter of the 
buckets on concrete floors] 
JB: Sorry! Too many things and not enough time! 
(00: 57:58) KK: (Kaitlyn laughs.) Oh, I understand. Um, was there anything else you wanted to 
add on to? Or? 
JB: Oh, oh my goodness gracious, no! I am talke d outtt! 
KK: Alrighty, then, I think we’re all finished up then! 
JB: Thank you, thank you… 
KK: Thank you! 
JB: Sorry, I feel like a mad scientist… (conversation trails off as the recording equipment 
is turned off.)
