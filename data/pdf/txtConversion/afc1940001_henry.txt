Henry the ShepherdYoung Henry, a shepherd, in his own native isle,With his flocks and the flowers
his heart was beguiled,Until a fair maiden by chance met her there,As sweet as the sunshine with
soft golden hair. *But Rudolph the Haughty of higher degreeHad sought Fanny's hand and rejected
was he;Then wrath filled his bosom; his proud heart was torn,For Randolph the Haughty did fair
Fannie scorn. *But Henry the shepherd of lower degreeWon fair Fannie's heart and enraptured was
he.Then quick to the altar did young Henry secureThe hand and the heart of the fair Fanny Moore.
*As Fannie was sitting in her beauty one day,As business had called her fond husband away,Then
Randall the Haughty came in at the door,And clasped in his arms the fair Fannie Moore."Oh, Randall,
have mercy; that never can be,For I love my Henry as dear as he loves me.Oh, go, Randolph, go
find some fairer girl than I.Yes, go from my dwelling, yes, go or I die." **"Yes, Fannie, you must die,
although I love you well.And why I do love you, my heart can never tell.But go, Fannie, go to the
land of the blessed."And he buried his knife in her snowy white breast.Then Randall the Haughty
was taken and tried,And Fannie all blooming in her beauty she died.Then Randall the Haughty
was hanged by the door,For shedding the blood of the fair Fannie Moore.But Henry the shepherd
distracted ran wild,And wandered away from his own native isle.But he was brought back to his own
native shore,And buried beside of the fair Fannie Moore.
