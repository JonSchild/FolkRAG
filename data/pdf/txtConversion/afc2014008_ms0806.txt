From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 3/22/96
 
I shall organize this report according to the topics
 
listed in the Evaluation Questionnaire.
 
GENERAL ASSESSMENT.  The trip was extremely enjoyable as well
 
as professionally stimulating.  I felt  fortunate to have been
 
included and would recommend it to any serious colleague.
 
I think most of the participants  (including me)  were a bit
 
unprepared for the active  schedule,  the sober professionalism
 
of our hosts,  the immediacy of the cultural/political
 
problems,  and the slight case of culture shock each of us
 
developed.  I suspect that,  in our cheerful ethnocentric
 
American style,  we had mostly thought the trip would be a bit
 
of a lark,  a marvellous  intellectually exciting vacation.  I
 
found in conversation that almost everyone had been working
 
extra hard at home,  doing double duty for some weeks,  so as
 
to be able to get away for ten days;  probably only a few of
 
us were in really good physical  shape,  up on their sleep and
 
ready to go.  Perhaps you could think of a tactful way to
 
forewarn the next group.
 
FINANCE AND PUBLICITY
 
I heard about the tour from a previous participant who also,
 
I believe,  turned in my name as a possible grantee.  I am a
 
bit  surprised that  I hadn't heard any other discussion of the
 
project  from others who I now know participated  (though this
 
could be  just happenstance) .
 In order to help spread the
 
word,  several of this year's group are organizing a panel
 
discussion of the tour at the American Folklore Society
 
meeting in Pittsburgh,  October 1996.  They have asked me to
 
participate and I shall gladly.
 
Fiscally speaking,  I probably could have taken part in the
 
study/tour without travel grant/funding from the British
 
Council,  but  I am not  really sure  I would have at that time.
 
Though I wound up paying some of the costs,  the grant was a
 
powerful  incentive;  it also added greatly to my sense of
 
responsibility and appreciation for the overall seriousness
 
of the endeavor.
 
THE PROGRAMME
 
Content: 
There  is bound to be a slippage,  a lack of fitment
 
between two such distinctive cultures as N.  Ireland and the
 
US,  not to mention the fact that neither group is  internally
 
homogeneous to begin with.  Reaching mutual understanding is a
 
chancy operation;  I am not at all sure that we ever got there
 
in spite of a good effort by all,  but that's no reason not to
 
keep working at  it.  A few general observations:
 
In both countries,  the world of arts agencies and the
 
world of  folklore seem to inter-relate differently.  In the
 
U.S.  the  internal relationship between arts and folklore is
 
recent,  inconsistent,  awkward,  and often combative,  mostly in
 
terms of what can and should be  included as art anyway.  In
 
Ireland,  at  least on the surface,  the two groups appear to be
 
collaborating relatively smoothly -
 possibly because of your
 
over-arching political agenda?  (I am referring here to the
 
declaration in your fascinating planning document that art,
 
especially traditional art,  can make a platform upon which
 
all northern Irish can meet and rejoice.  Forgive my
 
paraphrase,  I' ve loaned the document out to NEA friends.)
 
By contrast,  looking at the worlds of art and folklore
 
separately,  it  seems to me that arts agencies in N.I.  and the
 
U.S.  are remarkably similar;  the Harmony Hills Arts Center,
 
even the Verbal Arts Center could settle without a ripple
 
into the American cultural  landscape.  The area of folklore is
 
more disparate.  Irish and U.S.  folklorists,  and their
 
representative  folkloric institutions,  have different
 
histories and different operative principles.  There is,  for
 
example,  no real equivalent  in the U.S.for the Ulster Folk
 
and Transport Museum or the Linen Museum.
 
In the U.S.  there is no consistent agenda uniting
 
folklorists even with each other,  much less with other
 
disciplines.  Here,  the new "public folklorists",  who only
 
invented themselves during the past twenty-odd years,  are
 
still feeling their way,  not greatly assisted by the many
 
senior academics who still use the horrible example of Nazi
 
yolks-myths to discredit even the most benign political
 
agendas.  U.S.  folklorists are also faced with outgrowths of
 
the American-based "folksong revival",  when recording
 
companies and music publishers grew wealthy by popularizing
 
as  "rhythm and blues" protests recorded from
 anonymous black
 
laborers,  not to mention the fortunes made by textile
 
industrialsts hiring low-wage Haitian and Chinese needlewomen
 
to duplicate Mennonite quilt designs,  also conveniently
 
printed in folkloric studies.  Okay,  I am blowing it all up a
 
bit;  this  is because  I can't  list all the small treacheries,
 
all the little cheats.  They mount up over time into fortunes.
 
Such unforeseen outcomes are in the deep consciousness
 
of every American folklorist;  even the  least political of us
 
worry about them.  So we think a lot about authenticity and
 
community context and whose art  is  it anyway;  we are
 
suspicious of secondary learners.  We are kind of mad at the
 
nice young middle-class  interpreters who can so easily
 
perform the step,  fiddle the tune,  or knit the stitch just a
 
little bit more quickly and cleverly than the old timer
 
she/he learned it  from.  True,  the old fellow couldn't
 
probably find his way to the school and the classroom to show
 
it off.  But then somehow,  the secondary interpreter -
-
 who is
 
certainly due recompense,  I agree -
-
 always  seems to wind up
 
with the  lions'  share of the money,  not to mention applause.
 
U.S.  folklorists,  many of them trying to compensate for
 
the disjunction of traditional artist  from traditional art
 
so characteristic of industrial takeovers,  have re-evaluated
 
the contributions of our senior artists/artisans.  We have
 
learned from these folks.  We have become more wary and more
 
tender in our dealings with them.  We foreground them more,  we
 
call upon them more often to help us comprehend the work and
 
plan for its improvement.  It's their art and in vital ways,
 
they understand it better.  Besides it  is they who will or
 
will not take it  farther into its next  stage of development.
 
Well,  I' ve gotten outside the study-tour context,  but.  I
 
wanted to try to clarify why so many American folklorists are
 
so surprisingly hung up about authenticity and community
 
context.  Now,  a few specific recommendations:
 
1
)  I would include only one community arts
 
organization in the tour
 
2)  I would try to include  longer contact with one
 
or more primary traditional artists  (
the bodhran maker was a
 
fine one and I wish we had had more time with him).
 
3) .
 I would consider a time-controlled period
 
during which American and Irish folklorists might discuss
 
mutual issues.  I would have welcomed a chance to explore with
 
both U.S,  and N.I.  colleagues the problems that emerge in
 
exploring and developing a mythic past as well as the
 
troubling associations of older repertoires and older artists
 
with civic disagreement and conflict.
 
Special  features  For what  it's worth,  the following elements
 
were super-high points  for me at  least:
 
+the political overview by David McKitrick -
 
we all wished it could have been longer,  or perhaps we could
 
have met another time as well towards the end of the visit
 
+numerous  formal presentations at the Ulster
 
Folk and Transport Museum,  especially by Linda Ballard,
 
Robbie Hannan,  Megan McManus,  Tony Buckley,  Johnathan Bell
 
+the complex implications and challenges
 
implied by the work at Navan Fort
 
+the Linen Museum
 
+the Belfast Wall Mural tour
 
+Maxine Boyd's  informal presentations of local
 
histories,  landmarks,  and personal
 
insights  into Belfast  life
 
+the Giants Causeway and the trip up the coast
 
ADMINISTRATION
 
There  just are no improvements  I can think of.  The living
 
accommodations were comfortable and convenient,  the schedules
 
clicked along without delays,  everyone on both Council staffs
 
were friendly,  efficient and went mile after extra mile on
 
our behalfs.  There were plenty of pleasant
 social and
 
recreational opportunities when we had time and energy to
 
avail ourselves  of them.
 Maybe two unscheduled mornings?

NORTHERN IRELAND CULTURAL PROGRAMME IN AMERICA
 
As  part
 of
 it's  work
 in  the US,  The British Council manages the
 
Northern Ireland Cultural Programme
 in  America
 (NICPA),
 which
 is
 
funded  by
 the Department of Education for Northern Ireland.  The aim
 
of NICPA is to encourage and
 foster  communication
 and
 cooperation
 
between arts and academic bodies in the US and Northern Ireland.
 
NICPA activities include:
 
A  programme
 of travel grants for US visitors to undertake short
 
periods of research in Northern Ireland.
 
A Fellowship Scheme which funds up to four US academics per  year
 
to
 visit  Northern Ireland for six mcnth research attachments at
 
universities and cultural institutions.
 
Three study tours per year,  taking at least ten participants
 per
 
study  tour to Northern Ireland to examine one specific aspect of
 
the culture there.
 
A programme of travel
 grants
 and  grants-in--aid  to
 fund
 arts
 
professionals
 and  academics
 from Northern Ireland to visit the
 
United States.
 
A  series
 of
 arts
 events
 (drama,
 music,
 visual
 arts
 and
 
literature)  from Northern Ireland touring in the US.
 
The  main aim of The British Council's study tours is to introduce US
 
visitors to programmes,  policies and colleagues in  Northern
 Ireland
 
through an intensive ten day programme,  and to encourage dialogue and
 
collaboration between individuals and
 institutions  working
 in  the
 
same
 fields
 on  both
 sides of the Atlantic.  The British Council is
 
particularly interested in participants developing follow-up projects
 
involving  Northern
 Ireland  upon  returning to the US.  The previous
 
eighteen study tours  to  Northern
 Ireland  which
 The
 Council
 has
 
organised
 have
 been
 offered
 to
 archaeologists,
 arts
 
administrators/presenters ,
 folklorists,
 educators,
 museum
 
professionals,
 youth
 leaders,
 librarians,
 study
 abroad advisors,
 
school superintendents and members of
 the  American
 Conference
 for
 
Irish
 Studies
 (ACIS).
 These tours have resulted in a wide range of
 
follow-up projects including arts festivals,  visual arts exhibitions,
 
professional
 and
 student
 exchanges
 and
 joint US/Northern Ireland
 
research projects.

 internally
 
In both countries,  the world of arts agencies and the
 
world of folklore seem to inter-relate differently.  In the
 
U.S.  the internal relationship between arts and folklore is
 
recent,  inconsistent,  awkward,  and often combative,  mostly in
 
terms of what can and should be included as art anyway.  In
 
Ireland,  at  least on the surface,  the two groups appear to be
 
collaborating relatively smoothly -
 possibly because of your
 
over-arching political agenda?  (I am referring here to the
 
declaration in your fascinating planning document that art,
 
especially traditional art,  can make a platform upon which
 
all northern Irish can meet and rejoice.  Forgive my
 
paraphrase,  I' ve loaned the document out to NEA friends.)
 
By contrast,  looking at the worlds of art and folklore
 
separately,  it  seems to me that arts agencies in N.I.  and the
 
U.S.  are remarkably similar;  the Harmony Hills Arts Center,
 
even the Verbal Arts Center could settle without a ripple
 
into the American cultural  landscape.  The area of folklore is
 
more disparate.  Irish and U.S.  folklorists,  and their
 
representative folkloric institutions,  have different
 
histories and different operative principles.  There is,  for
 
example,  no real equivalent  in the U.S.for the Ulster Folk
 
and Transport Museum or the Linen Museum.
 
In the U.S.  there is no consistent agenda uniting
 
folklorists even with each other,  much less with other
 
disciplines.  Here,  the new "public folklorists",  who only
 
invented themselves during the past twenty-odd years,  are
 
still feeling their way,  not greatly assisted by the many
 
senior academics who still use the horrible example of Nazi
 
yolks-myths to discredit even the most benign political
 
agendas.  U.S.  folklorists are also faced with outgrowths of
 
the American-based "folksong revival",  when recording
 
companies and music publishers grew wealthy by popularizing
 
as  "rhythm and blues" protests recorded from
 anonymous black
 
laborers,  not to mention the fortunes made by textile
 
industrialsts hiring low-wage Haitian and Chinese needlewomen
 
to duplicate Mennonite quilt designs,  also conveniently
 
printed in folkloric studies.  Okay,  I am blowing it all up a
 
bit;  this  is because  I can't  list all the small treacheries,
 
all the little cheats.  They mount up over time into fortunes.
 
Such unforeseen outcomes are in the deep consciousness
 
of every American folklorist;  even the  least political of us
 
worry about them.  So we think a lot about authenticity and
 
community context and whose art  is  it anyway;  we are
 
suspicious of secondary learners.  We are kind of mad at the
 
nice young middle-class  interpreters who can so easily
 
perform the step,  fiddle the tune,  or knit the stitch just a
 
little bit more quickly and cleverly than the old timer
 
she/he learned it  from.  True,  the old fellow couldn't
 
probably find his way to the school and the classroom to show
 
it off.  But then somehow,  the secondary interpreter -
-
 who is
 
certainly due recompense,  I agree -
-
 always  seems to wind up
 
with the  lions'  share of the money,  not to mention applause.
 
U.S.  folklorists,  many of them trying to compensate for
 
the disjunction of traditional artist  from traditional art
 
so characteristic of industrial takeovers,  have re-evaluated
 
the contributions of our senior artists/artisans.  We have
 
learned from these folks.  We have become more wary and more
 
tender in our dealings with them.  We foreground them more,  we
 
call upon them more often to help us comprehend the work and
 
plan for its  improvement.  It's their art and in vital ways,
 
they understand it better.  Besides  it  is they who will or
 
will not take it  farther into its next  stage of development.
 
Well,  I' ve gotten outside the study-tour context,  but.  I
 
wanted to try to clarify why so many American folklorists are
 
so surprisingly hung up about authenticity and community
 
context.  Now,  a few specific recommendations:
 
1
)  I would include only one community arts
 
organization in the tour
 
2)  I would try to include  longer contact with one
 
or more primary traditional artists  (the bodhran maker was a
 
fine one and I wish we had had more time with him).
 
3) .
 I would consider a time-controlled period
 
during which American and Irish folklorists might discuss
 
mutual issues.  I would have welcomed a chance to explore with
 
both U.S,  and N.I.  colleagues the problems that emerge in
 
exploring and developing a mythic past as well as the
 
troubling associations of older repertoires and older artists
 
with civic disagreement and conflict.
 
Special features  For what  it's worth,  the following elements
 
were super-high points for me at  least:
 
+the political overview by David McKitrick -
 
we all wished it could have been longer,  or perhaps we could
 
have met  another time as well towards the end of the visit
 
+numerous  formal presentations at the Ulster
 
Folk and Transport Museum,  especially by Linda Ballard,
 
Robbie Hannan,  Megan McManus,  Tony Buckley,  Johnathan Bell
 
+the complex implications and challenges
 
implied by the work at Navan Fort
 
+the Linen Museum
 
+the Belfast Wall Mural tour
 
+Maxine Boyd's  informal presentations of local
 
histories,  landmarks,  and personal
 
insights  into Belfast  life
 
+the Giants Causeway and the trip up the coast
 
ADMINISTRATION
 
There  just are no improvements  I can think of.  The living
 
accommodations were comfortable and convenient,  the schedules
 
clicked along without delays,  everyone on both Council staffs
 
were friendly,  efficient and went mile after extra mile on
 
our behalfs.  There were plenty of pleasant
 social and
 
recreational opportunities when we had time and energy to
 
avail ourselves  of them.
 Maybe two unscheduled mornings?

t t
he Ulster Folk &
 
T

here a

 would imagine. Many o

oof t

ascinating
 
t

xplained not only t
he bows but t
he
 
whys a

he a
esthetics a

I am writing to you as a recent participant on the USA
 
Folklorists'  Study Tour to ask if you would have suggestions
 
or ideas for future Folklorists , tours.
 I realise you will
 
have had time to reflect on the visit and after the initial
 
thoughts at the evaluation may have considered what would
 
make an ideal programme to Northern Ireland for American
 
Folklorists.
 
I hope this letter finds you well and happy and I look
 
forward to receiving any ideas or suggestions you may have.
 
Yours sincerely

In both countries,  the world of arts agencies and the
 
world of folklore seem to inter-relate differently.  In the
 
U.S.  the  internal relationship between arts and folklore is
 
recent,  inconsistent,  awkward,  and often combative,  mostly in
 
terms of what can and should be  included as art anyway.  In
 
Ireland,  at  least on the surface,  the two groups appear to be
 
collaborating relatively smoothly -
 possibly because of your
 
over-arching political agenda?  (I am referring here to the
 
declaration in your fascinating planning document that art,
 
especially traditional art,  can make a platform upon which
 
all northern Irish can meet and rejoice.  Forgive my
 
paraphrase,  I' ve loaned the document out to NEA friends.)
 
By contrast,  looking at the worlds of art and folklore
 
separately,  it  seems to me that arts agencies  in N.I.  and the
 
U.S.  are remarkably similar;  the Harmony Hills Arts Center,
 
even the Verbal Arts Center could settle without a ripple
 
into the American cultural landscape.  The area of folklore is
 
more disparate.  Irish and U.S.  folklorists,  and their
 
representative  folkloric institutions,  have different
 
histories and different operative principles.  There is,  for
 
example,  no real equivalent  in the U.S.for the Ulster Folk
 
and Transport Museum or the Linen Museum.
 
In the U.S.  there is no consistent agenda uniting
 
folklorists even with each other,  much less with other
 
disciplines.  Here,  the new "public folklorists",  who only
 
invented themselves during the past twenty-odd years,  are
 
still feeling their way,  not greatly assisted by the many
 
senior academics who still use the horrible example of Nazi
 
yolks-myths to discredit even the most benign political
 
agendas.  U.S.  folklorists are also faced with outgrowths of
 
the American-based "folksong revival",  when recording
 
companies and music publishers grew wealthy by popularizing
 
as  "rhythm and blues" protests recorded from
 anonymous black
 
laborers,  not to mention the fortunes made by textile
 
industrialsts hiring low-wage Haitian and Chinese needlewomen
 
to duplicate Mennonite quilt designs,  also conveniently
 
printed in folkloric studies.  Okay,  I am blowing it all up a
 
bit;  this  is because  I can't  list all the small treacheries,
 
all the little cheats.  They mount up over time into fortunes.
 
Such unforeseen outcomes are in the deep consciousness
 
of every American folklorist;  even the  least political of us
 
worry about them.  So we think a lot about authenticity and
 
community context and whose art  is it anyway;  we are
 
suspicious of secondary learners.  We are kind of mad at the
 
nice young middle-class  interpreters who can so easily
 
perform the step,  fiddle the tune,  or knit the stitch just a
 
little bit more quickly and cleverly than the old timer
 
she/he learned it  from.  True,  the old fellow couldn't
 
probably find his way to the school and the classroom to show
 
it off.  But then somehow,  the secondary interpreter -
-
 who is
 
certainly due recompense,  I agree -
-
 always  seems to wind up
 
with the  lions'  share of the money,  not to mention applause.
 
U.S.  folklorists,  many of them trying to compensate for
 
the disjunction of traditional artist  from traditional art
 
so characteristic of industrial takeovers,  have re-evaluated
 
the contributions of our senior artists/artisans.  We have
 
learned from these folks.  We have become more wary and more
 
tender in our dealings with them.  We foreground them more,  we
 
call upon them more often to help us comprehend the work and
 
plan for its  improvement.  It's their art and in vital ways,
 
they understand it better.  Besides  it  is they who will or
 
will not take it  farther into its next  stage of development.
 
Well,  I' ve gotten outside the study-tour context,  but.  I
 
wanted to try to clarify why so many American folklorists are
 
so surprisingly hung up about authenticity and community
 
context.  Now,  a few specific recommendations:
 
1
)  I would include only one community arts
 
organization in the tour
 
2)  I would try to include longer contact with one
 
or more primary traditional artists  (the bodhran maker was a
 
fine one and I wish we had had more time with him).
 
3) .
 I would consider a time-controlled period
 
during which American and Irish folklorists might discuss
 
mutual issues.  I would have welcomed a chance to explore with
 
both U.S,  and N.I.  colleagues the problems that emerge in
 
exploring and developing a mythic past as well as the
 
troubling associations of older repertoires and older artists
 
with civic disagreement and conflict.
 
Special  features  For what  it's worth,  the following elements
 
were super-high points  for me at  least:
 
+the political overview by David McKitrick -
 
we all wished it could have been longer,  or perhaps we could
 
have met another time as well towards the end of the visit
 
+numerous  formal presentations at the Ulster
 
Folk and Transport Museum,  especially by Linda Ballard,
 
Robbie Hannan,  Megan McManus,  Tony Buckley,  Johnathan Bell
 
+the complex implications and challenges
 
implied by the work at Navan Fort
 
+the Linen Museum
 
+the Belfast Wall Mural tour
 
+Maxine Boyd's  informal presentations of local
 
histories,  landmarks,  and personal
 
insights  into Belfast  life
 
+the Giants Causeway and the trip up the coast
 
ADMINISTRATION
 
There  just are no improvements  I can think of.  The living
 
accommodations were comfortable and convenient,  the schedules
 
clicked along without delays,  everyone on both Council  staffs
 
were friendly,  efficient and went mile after extra mile on
 
our behalfs.  There were plenty of pleasant
 social and
 
recreational opportunities when we had time and energy to
 
avail ourselves of them.
 Maybe two unscheduled mornings?

Thank you.  I am truly honored to be addressing this
 
particular assembly on this particular day.  You see,  I' m
 
neither an east coast native nor an Asian American and I
 
originally came to Arlington  just to do a six month piece of
 
work for the Smithsonian and then go home,  I never intended
 
to stay,  and it  still surprises me to think  I
' ve been here 21
 
years.  I guess at bottom I still  feel kind of temporary.
 
So it's very gratifying to be asked to address the city
 
and county workers of the place where  I' ve been living.  It
 
sort of brought up old memories and I hope you'll forgive me
 
for remarking that Arlington when I first saw it back in 1975
 
wasn't really all that prepossessing.  Wilson Boulevard was
 
nearly impassable at that time because of Metro construction.
 
I remember every morning picking my way gingerly to the bus
 
stop,  skirting the piles of rubble,  teetering along planks
 
laid over open ditches,  noticing how most of the large
 
Clarendon stores had closed down and moved out,  their Wilson
 
Boulevard frontages taken over by small family-style store-
front businesses,  almost all of them Asian-American
 And I
 
kept on being pleased by that part because I had never lived
 
with many Asian Americans neighbors before.
 
But  I also kept on thinking that all those nice little
 
restaurants and groceries and jewelry stores had probably
 
moved in  just because business was poor and so rents had
 
dropped and there were lots of vacancies.  And I thought.  well
 
they' re are going to do all right for a while and keep
 
business  flowing around here for a year or so until the Metro
 
finally opens up and everything is pretty again.  And then -
-
the rents will go back up,  the nice Asian-Americans and other
 
locally-owned small businesses won't be able to pay the
 
larger amounts and will have to move out,  and the bigger,
 
more standard businesses will take over again.  I' d seen it
 
happen with redevelopment many times before in many places.
 
Now this  is Asian-American month.  There is absolutely
 
no way that  in the next 3 and a half minutes  I can sum up for
 
you the contributions made by the great Asian peoples that
 
have come to this country.
 
A few things might  stick in your mind,  like recent
 
studies  show that Asians who have immigrated here,  far from
 
taking away jobs,  actually create new ones.  Did you know,  for
 
instance,  that  fifteen of the nation's most  successful high-
tech companies were founded by Chinese,  Filipino,  Indian and
 
other Asian and Pacific ethnic groups?
 This bunch of
 
companies now has a combined revenue of 22 and a quarter
 
billion dollars.  Asian Americans across the country pay out
 
three billion dollars a year in wages alone.  Asian Americans
 
engage with remarkable success in our institutions of higher
 
learning and make contributions  in every scientific and
 
professional area.
 
But what  I' d really like to emphasize are the amazing
 
artistic contributions that Asian American immigrants have
 
brought with them.  At the National Endowment  for the Arts,  I
 
helped develop the Folk and Traditional Arts Program.  Its  job
 
was to honor,  strengthen and make visible those home grown
 
community-based art  forms that have endured through
 
generations,  that carry with them a sense of community
 
aesthetics and that  serve both to identify and to symbolize
 
the particular group that  originated them.
 
Some of the art  forms we supported were informal -
-
 some
 
people would call them folk -
-
 and some were formal -
-
 some
 
people might call them "classical".  But all are traditional
 
to a special people.  Consider for instance,  Hawaiian hula,
 
Laotian weaving,  Japanese
 bonsai plantings,  Hmong
 
embroidered flower cloths,  Thai,  Japanese and Chinese silk,
 
Cambodian court dancing,  the varied instrumental ensembles of
 
Okinawa,  India,  Korea
 Balinese gong orchestras and shadow
 
It  is discouraging that whenever things get a little
 
out  of order and people try to figure out why,  some folks'
 
minds
 go on to automatic pilot and they begin to say,  "Well,
 
of course it  isn't us making trouble,  we're too nice,  so it
 
must be those other folks over there that we don't know so
 
well -
-
 those newcomers,  those immigrants  (forgetting all the
 
time that every single person in the U.S.  has  immigrants
 
hanging all over their family trees.)
 
But,  do you know,  it's  just  like the zoning
 
regulations -
-
 if we didn't really underneath like living
 
with different kinds of people,  if we didn't really approve
 
of letting people come here,  if we hadn't found there were
 
solid advantages to it,  we  just wouldn't have kept on doing
 
it.  So why not try ,for a change,to think about what is  so
 
wonderful about  living in a multicultural nation,  since we' ve
 
got one and we always have had.
 
What have different peoples to offer each other,  what
 
have they to gain from each other across cultural barriers?
 
The first thing is -
-
 the beauty of difference.  If everything
 
is the same,  why bother to look or listen or love? Difference
 
is essential to beauty.  The second thing is the reassurance
 
of similarity.  To feel comfortable,  to feel at ease and
 
approved of,  you need to have something in common.
 
The beauty of differences.  The assurance,  the comfort
 
of similarities.  Catch both of those together and you' ve got
 
a prize.  And really that is why these celebratory months  like
 
the one we' re enjoying right now are so important  for
 
Americans -
-
 they give us a chance to focus on one group
 
after another of our diverse citizenry,  learning a bit about
 
each one,  and coming to rejoice in the  similarities and
 
differences each one offers us.
 
But,  do you know,  that rea. f
ly—dldii'L
 
h
a
p
pend here  in
 
Arlington,  at  least  from my perspective.  Twenty years later I
 
can still visit many of the exact  same stores  I patronized in
 
1975.  and profit by the expert assistance of the craftsmen
 
and women who work in photography,  jewelry,  printing,
 
dressmaking,  retail sales.  I can still enjoy a fabulous
 
Vietnamese,  Japanese,  Chinese,  Indian meal  (along with my
 
chili and barbecue) .
 And just a few weeks ago I read in the
 
Washington Post that the Clarendon area has become "Cool
 
Clarendon -
-
 Adams Morgan with parking".
 
Something really good obviously happened here in
 
Arlington in those years and I think Arlingtonians ought to
 
feel pretty happy about  it.  I don't know exactly how it all
 
worked -
-
 I expect a lot had to do with zoning regulations
 
and planning restrictions,  and I'll bet the various county
 
boards had some rough sessions during that period.  But  I do
 
know that  regulations and codes only work when the people,
 
the voting public,  fundamentally support them and
 
fundamentally believe in them.  And most Americans also
 
believe in being fair,  and they believe that  small businesses
 
are as  important as big businesses,  sometimes more so.
 
And finally it's also a very old American principle that
 
we  should welcome people who come new to this country and
 
value the  special gifts they always bring with them.  I
' d call
 
our country
 "multicultural" if that word didn't  scare people
 
so much.  You know we' ve always have lived this way,  sharing
 
the  land with different  folks.  There never has been a time
 
when only one kind of people lived here;  even pre-history
 
shows different groups of indigenous tribes and settlements
 
occupying North America,  and those people themselves came
 
here across the Bering Straits or else up out of the ground
 
from the nether world as  some of their religious traditions
 
have it.  This continent,  this stretch of land between the
 
Atlantic and the Pacific oceans,  has always been host to
 
travellers.
 
puppets,  Chinese ceramics
 -
-
 I could go on  for hours  just
 
listing the superb artistic creations we're privileged not
 
just to look at  in museum exhibits and concert auditoria but
 
in the homes and shops of our neighbors who happen to have
 
come from these countries and have brought beloved pieces of
 
their homeland arts with them.
 
And we all have  chances to learn to love them too.
 
That's what Asian-American week is for-- sharing and being
 
shared with -
-
 and we will shortly be enjoying some
 
performances  from our neighbors and our neighbors'  children
 
from countries many of us may never see
4ut we have a piece
 
of them right here!)
 And we will,  I predict,  see and hear
 
some sights and sounds that will be brand new to us.  But
 
remember  just one thing more:  nobody was born loving
 
Beethoven or Picasso or Johnny Cash or Greek columns or log
 
cabin quilts or rap music.  As Rogers and Hammerstein said in
 
a song about  learning to hate,  "You have to be carefully
 
I
CVc:
• & -C
 
taught".  And so it  is with appreciation a 4 J

-
 it
 
doesn't come inborn,  it comes  from experience,  from exposure,
 
from taking a class or two,  from listening and looking,  from
 
reading a book,  from talking with other people.
 
It  is my hope that the Asian American month of 1996 will
 
send us all not  just out to dinner in one of our delightfully
 
savory Asian American restaurants butAto added experiences  in
 
the many kinds of beauty that Asian Americans have brought
 
into the United States.  Every one of us can  join in this -
-
even if we' re Asian ourselves,  after all,  we can learn more
 
about other kinds of Asian arts than our own.  And wouldn't
 
that be a happy beginning for us all,  as well as a happy
 
ending for my

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
On behalf of the Arlington County Asian and Pacific
 
American Heritage Committee, I would like to extend a warm
 
weiccire and thank you for agrccing to be our guest speaker at
 
the Asian and Pacific American Heritage Month. This is the
 
18th national ceremriy and the 7th local celebration.

Boulevard, Arlington County Board room, third floor, 12:00
 
Noon. Mr. James. B. Hunter, III Arlington County Board
 
Chairman will open the ceremony and sign the proclamation.
 
Also attending will be Arlington County Board Members,
 
Departments Heads,  Division Chiefs,  Supervisors and
 
aplcyees.
 
In your presentation I
 would like to request you to high
 
light a little bit about the role of the National Endowment
 
for the Arts. How the community at large benefits from it;
 
how important it is for the researchers and scholars in the
 
field of Antropology, Etbnorrusicology, Folklore benefit from
 
the Asian and Pacific American or the new i
r
rrnigrants. How the
 
new immigrants benefits from the National Endowrr
ent for the
 
Arts,  how important it is for all of us to learn and
 
understand the folk arts from one another,  the old
 
civilizations that have contributed to our present societies.
 
Please limit your presentation to no rr
ore then 15 minutes the
 
i
lust.
 
After your presentation there will be dances and musical
 
performances from the Asian and Pacific American corrrruriities.
 
The one hour ceremony will end by 1
:00 PM, and it will be
 
followed by light refreshrents. At 1
:30 R4 you and Terri Liu
 
are invited to join me for lunch at the China Rose
 
Resta
i i
rant, which is next door at the Court House Square.
 
I have received your biography, and I
 will be the person
 
to introduce you. Please arrive at the Arlington County Board
 
Room, third floor, around 11:30 AM, I will be there waiting
 
for you. In the event of emergency, please ca
 11 and leave the
 
message in my Voice Mail at 358-3758.  Please call me if you
 
have any f
urther questions. We are r
rost fortunate to have you
 
as a keynote speaker this year. Once again, thank you for
 
your humanitarian contribution to this event.
