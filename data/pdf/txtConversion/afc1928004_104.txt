We all do love ti.e pretty girls, 
We see them every day, 
And how at first sight fall in love, 
When e'er they pass our way. 
A charming girl this afternoon, 
I 
saw come tripping by, 
And as I 
looked she winked at me, 
Oh ! bow is that for high ? 
CHORUS. 
And its oh 1 
my I 
love her so, 
And how I 
wish I 
was her beau ; 
She's the prettiest little charmer in all this town, 
And sweet sixteen so sly. 
When her I 
meet, she smiles 60 Sweet, 
Oh ! how is that for high ? 
Her dress was in a 
f 
ishion cut, 
Looped up so gay and neat, 
And as she went across the way, 
I 
Saw her pretty feet. 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Twas marked L- u- c-y, 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me then, 
Oh I 
how is that. for high ? 
And its, oh! my, kte. 
Of course this little chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said her father he was rich, 
He lately had struck ile. 
As I 
exclaimed, " will you be mine?' 
Her sweetheart, he came by ; 
Walk off, says lie, oh, no says she. 
Oh! how is that for high ? 
And its, oh! my! 4.tc.

Morn on the meadow, and blossom, and spray, 
Glitter like gems in the dew-light of (14 ; 
Grasses of emerald, tufted with gold, 
Lilies, like love, when too bashful and cold. 
Wings of the wild bee disturbing the nest, 
Of the lark that still broods o'er the song in its- breast ; 
Flow ret and butterfly, wake as new born— 
"Bs morn on the meadow, the dew-lighted morn. 
Night on the fielils,and the mower bath been, 
And the gems of the meadow 110 longer are seen ; 
The bright and beautiful, faded and ( lead, 
Lie cold as the tears v. hich the moonlight bath shed. 
The years of our being are lost like a 
breath— 
For the mower bath been— and that mower is Death; 
But a

And a 
beauty eternal shall circle that morn. 
THOU HAST WOUNDED THE-SPIRIT THAT 
LOVED THEE. 
Thou bast wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished thine image for years, 
Thou hast taught tne at last to forget thee, 
In secret, in silence, ant tears. 
As the young bird when left by its mother, 
Its earliest pinions to try, 
Round the nest will still lingeringly hover 
Ere its trembling wings can fly. 
Thus we're taught in this cold world to smother, 
Each feeling that once wa- so dear; 
Like that young bird I'd seek to discover 
A home of affection elsewhere. 
Tho' this heart may still chug to thee fondly, 
And dream of sweet memories past, 
Yet hope, like the rainbow of summer, 
Gives a 
promise of Lethe at last. 
HAVE LIVED AND LOVED TOGETIMIL 
We have liyed. and loved to-ether, 
Through many changing years ; 
We have shared each other's gl
adness, 
And wept-each other's tears. 
I 
have never known a 
sorrow 
That was long unsoothed by thee, 
Th it was long unsoothed by thee: 
For thy smile can make a -summer, 
Where darkness 'else would be. 
Like the leaves that fall _around us, 
In Autumn's fading hours, 
Are the traitor • smiles that darken, 
When the cloud of sorrow lowers ; 
And though many such we've _known, love, 
Too prone, alas I 
to range, 
Too prcue,.alasl to lunge. 
We 
both ,can speak of one. love., 
Whom time con d

THE OLD FARM-HOUSE. 
Oh ! the old farm house, down beside the valley stream, 
Where in childhood so oft I 
have played, 
Ere sorrow had clouded my heart's early dream, 
Or life's purest joys had decayed; 
low well I 
remember the vine-covered roof, 
And the rose-bushes clustering nigh, 
And the tall stately poplar trees standing aloof, 
Whose tops seemed to reach to the sky. 
Oh I 
the old farm-house, my childhood's happy home ! 
Oh ! the old farm-house, how I've sported round its hearth, 
With may sisters and brothers so dear ; 
How oft has it rung with our inuocent mirth, 
And hallowed our soft evening prayer ; 
But the old farm-house now is bowing to decay, 
Its stones, like dead friends, lie apart; 
But its dear cherished image shall ne'er fade away 
From affection's domain in my heart. 
Oh ! the old farm-house, my ch'Llhood's happy home !

We shall meet, but we shall miss him ;. 
There will be one vacant chair ; 
"We shall linger to caress him, 
While we breathe our evening prayer-
-When, a 
year ago, we gathered, 
Joy was in his mild blue eye; 
But a 
golden cord is- severed, 
And our hopes iii ruins • lie. 
We shall meet, but we shall miss hint 
There will be one vacant chnir; 
We shall linger to c-aress him, 
When we breathe our evening prayer.. 
At our fireside, sal and lonely, 
Often will the bosom swell 
At remembrance of the story 
How our noble Willie fell ; 
How he strove to bear our banner' 
Through the thickest of the fight,. 
And upheld our country's honor, 
In the strength of manhood's might. 
"i,Ve shall meet, 
True, they tell us wreaths of glory 
Ever more will deck his brow; 
But this soothes the anguish only, 
Sweeping, o'er our heart strings now 
Sleep to-day, 0 
early fallen ! 
ln thy green and narrow bed ;

Telling the tales of the bravo and the fair, 
Scorning the world and the wealth that it squanders,

I 
met her by the trickling brook, 
Young Jenny, fmd Jenny; 
As far as morn her gentle look, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
Twas golden bright her falling hair, 
A 
sparkling sunbeam nestled there, 
And free from sorrow, free from care 
Was young Jenny, fond Jenny, 
Oh ! her step was like a 
fawn, so fleet! 80 fleet !

Will chimp and flutter oe'r the head 
Of young Jenny, fond Jenny.

And soft confess'd without regret, 
That all my hopes were fondly set 
On young Jenny, fond Jenny.

LIFE SOME SAY IS NOUGHT BUT WOE. 
Life some say is nought but woe, 
With them I'll not agree; 
Life has many pains, I 
know, 
Yet glemis of bliss there be ; 
Come, be contented with our lot, 
'Twill make our surrows lighter; 
Of trifles, prithee heed them not, 
And prospects will go brighter. 
As life is short, then, pleasure take, 
And pass in joy the day; 
For, why should we more sorrows make, 
When we've enough alway? 
Bo brood no longer o'er your cares, 
It will not make them lighter; 
Arise I 
I 
say, dry up your tears, 
And prospects will grow brighter.'

A wayward bird on idle wing, 
Too long my heart has been, 
In many an hour of life's young spring, 
And many a 
festive scene; 
But fancied joys have passed away, 
I 
care not now to own ; 
One spelt to me is bliss to-day 
My heart is thine alone; 
One spell to me is bliss to -
day— 
My heart is thine, is thiue alone 
Believe not that my spirit still, 
By c.treless thought is swayed: 
The cords have found a 
purer thrill, 
Where idle fancies played; 
And in thy gaze there lives a 
beam, 
In all thy words a 
tone; 
*rhat tells 1 
do not vainly dream 
My heart is thine alone ; 
That tells I 
do not vainly dream, 
My heart is thine, is thine alone.

TfIE FAIRY BOY. 
A 
mother came, when the stars were paling, 
Wailing round a 
lonely spring; 
Thus she cried while tears were falling, 
Calling on the fairy king;— 
" 
Why, with spell my child caressing, 
Courting him with fAiry joy, 
Why destroy a 
mother's blessing? 
\\Therefore steal my baby boy ? 
O'er the mountain, thro' the wild wood, 
Where his childhood loved to play, 
Where the flowers are freshly springing, 
There I 
wander day by day ; 
There I 
w 
,nder, growing fonder 
Of the child that made my joy, 
On the echoes Wildly calling 
To restore may fairy boy. 
But in vain my plaintive calling; 
Tears are falling all in vain; 
lie now sports with fairy pleasure; 
lie's the treasure of their train ! 
Fare-thee- well. my child, forever ! 
In this world I've lost my joy; 
But in the next we ne'er shall sever • 
There I'll find my angel boy F' 
WHEN SORROW SLEEPETH, WAKE IT NOT. 
When sorrow sleepeth, wake it not, 
But let it slumber on ; 
If grief is for awhile forgot, 
Its power that while is gone. 
The mind may, front the pause, gain strength 
To grapple with its foe, 
And thence may rise to prove, at length, 
Triumphant over woe. 
When sorrow, &c. 
We mourn the lost—we sigh for care— 
We grieve—by sin oppress'd, 
And all a 
secret burden bear: 
For earth is not our rest. 
Then watch thy thoughts, thy words restrain. 
Each heart its burden knows; 
One little word, all light and vain, 
Max' break that heart's repose' 
When sorrow,

The roads of life are very rough 
From infancy to age; 
And Master Smith may prove a 
muff, 
And Master Jones a 
save; 
But, whether you are Smith or Jones, 
It's quite as well to keep 
A good look out for broken bones, 
And " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, dr.e. 
Suppose you chance to cultivate 
A 
turn for marl ied life, 
And think your funds are in a 
state 
To venture on a 
wife ; 
. 
I 
fear you'll find that wedded bliss 
Is very far from cheap, 
So my advice is simply this, 
To " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, tte. 
Suppose you lend a 
little cash, 
Or do a 
little bill. 
As people -who are rather rash 
Occasionally will ; 
If pru : enee ever takes a

A

You'll learn at last from that mishap 
To - look before you leap."

THE RUM-SELLER'S SNARE. 
The rum-seller stood at. his counter at night, 
Like it spider in wait for his prey, 
And chuckled with glee o'er the gains he had made 
On the sale of his liquor that day, 
CHORUS. 
Beware ! Beware! 0 
brother 
Dear brother, beware ! 
I 
soon shall he wealthy, he said to his friend, 
Have a 
house and a 
farm of my own ; 
Have servants to come and go at my call, 
And money in pocket to loan. 
Beware, & c. 
Just then on the sweeet-scented calm summer air, 
Disturbing the stillness of even, 
Come a 
shriek of distress, a 
cry of despair, 
A cry that ascended to heaven. 
Beware, & c. 
A bright little boy, the pride of of his home, 
Sat waiting his fsthee to erect; 
But the demon had entered the brain of the man, 
And he crushed the child under his feet. 
Beware! 
Oh ! papa, you've killed me, poor Willie then said, 
As writhing in agony he lay; 
Then carried aloft to his own little bed, 
He waited and watched for the day. 
Beware! & c, 
What balm can now soothe the terrible pain, 
That is rending the fond mother's heart, 
As she sits by the side of the innocent child, 
And sees his young spirit depart ? 
Beware I &c. 
As with terror she thinks of the tempter and fiend-, 
Who entered her Paradise fair, 
Has robbed her of peace and murdered her child, 
And driven her home to despair. 
Beware ! &c. 
She prays that the arm of the law may be strong, 
And stay the rum-sellers hand : 
That for gain he no more shall keep liquor in store, 
To spread ruin and death o'er the land. 
Beware, &et

LEAF BY LEAF THE ROSES FALL. 
Leaf by leaf the roses fall, 
Drop by drop the springs run dry, 
One by one, beyond recall, 
Summer beauties fade and die. 
But the roses bloom again, 
And the springs will gush anew, 
In the pleasant April rain 
And the summer's sun and dew. 
CIIORUS. 
Leaf by leaf the roses fall, 
Drop by drop the springs run dry, 
One by one, beyond recall, 
Summer beauties fade and die. 
So in hours of deepest gloom, 
When the springs of gladness fail, 
And the roses in their bloom 
Droop like maidens wan and pale, 
We shall find some hope that lies, 
Like some silent germ apart, 
Hidden far from careless eyes 
In the garden of the heart. 
Leaf by leaf, &e. 
Some sweet hope to gladness wed, 
That will spring afresh and new 
When Grief's winter shall have fled, 
Giving place to sun and dew— 
Some sweet hope that breathes of spring, 
Through the weary, weary time, 
Budding forth its blossoming, 
In the spirit's silent clime. 
Leaf by leaf, &c.

THE OLD HOUSE AT HOME. 
Oh! the old house at home, where my forefathers dwelt, 
Where a 
child, at the feet of my mother I 
knelt; 
Where she taught me the prayer, where she read me the page, 
Which, if infancy lisps, is the solace of age: 
My heart, 'mid all changes, wherever I 
roam, 
Neer loses its love for the old house at home. 
'Twas not for the splendor that dwelling was dear, 
'Twas not that the proud or the noble was near; 
O'er the porch the gay wild rose and woodbine entwined, 
And time sweet scented jessamine waved on the wind; 
Yet dearer to me than proud turrets or dome, 
Were the halls of my fathers, the old house at, home!

THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS. 
The light of other days is faded, 
And all its glories past 
For grief with heavy wing bath shaded 
The hope too bright to last. 
The world which morning's mantle clouded, 
Shines forth purer rays, 
But the heart ne'er feels in sorrow shrouded, 
The light of other days. 
The leaf which autumn tempests wither, 
The birds which there take wing, 
When winter's winds are past, come hither 
To welcome back the spring 
The very ivy on the ruin, 
In gloomful life displays; 
But the heart alone sees no renewing , 
The light of other days.

THE OCEAN BURIAL. 
Oh! bury me not in the doep deep sea! 
The words came low and mournfully 
From the pallid lips of a 
youth who lay 
On his cabin couch, at the close of the day; 
He had wasted and pined, till o'er his brow 
Death's shade had slowly passed, and now 
Where the land and his fond loved home were nigh, 
They had gathered around him to see him die. 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
Where the billowing shroud will swell o'er me, 
Where no light will break through the dark cold wave, 
And no sunbeam rest upon my grave! 
It matters not, I 
have often been told, 
Where the body shall lie, when the heart is cold, 
Yet grant, oh! grant this boon to me: 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
For, in fancy rve listened to the well known words, 
The free wild winds, and the songs of the birds, 
I 
have thought of home, of cot, and of bower, 
And of scenes that I 
loved in childhood's hour: 
I 
had even hoped to be laid, when I 
died, 
In the churchyard there, on the green bill side: 
By the homes of my father my grave should be; 
Oh bury me not in the deep, deep sea 1 
Let my death slumbers be where a 
mother's prayer, 
And a 
sister's tear shall be mingled there; 
It will be sweet, ere the gentle heart's throb is o'er, 
To know, when its fountain shall gush no more , 
That those it so fondly hath yearned for, will come 
To plant the wild flower of Spring on my tomb; 
Lot me lie where those loved ones will weep over me; 
Oh I 
bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
And there is another whose tears would be shed 
For him who lay far in an ocean bed; 
In hours that it pains me to think of now. 
She bath twined those locks and bath kissed this brow. 
In the hair she hath wreathed shall the sea-serpent hiss ? 
And the brow she hath pressed, shall the cold wave kiss? 
For the sake of that bright one that waiteth for me, 
Oh I 
bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
She hath been in my dreams—His voice failed there; 
They gave no heed to his dying prayer, 
They have lowered him low o'er the vessel, side ; 
Above him has closed the dark cold tide. 
Where to dip the light wings the sea bird rests, 
And the blue waves dance o'er the ocean crest, 
Where the billows bound and the winds sport free; 
They have buried him there, in the deep, deep seal 
NOTHING MORE. 
In a 
valley fair, I 
wandered 
O'er its meadow-pathways green, 
Where a 
singing brook was flowing, 
Like the spirit of the scene; 
And I 
saw a 
lovely maiden, 
With a 
basket brimming o'er 
With sweet buds, and so I 
asked her 
For a 
flower, and—nothing more. 
Then I 
chatted on, beside her, 
And I 
praised her hair and eyes, 
And. like roses from her basket, 
On her cheeks saw blushes rise, 
With her timid looks down glancing, 
She said : would I 
pass before? 
But I 
said that all I 
wanted 
Was a 
smile and— nothing more. 
So she shyly smiled upon me, 
And I 
still kept wandering on, 
What with blushing, smiling, chatting 
Soon a 
brief half hour was gone. 
Then she told me I 
must leave her, 
For, she saw their cottage door; 
But I 
would not till I 
rifled 
Just a 
kiss, and—nothing more. 
Thus for weeks and months I 
woo'd her 
And the joys that then had birth, 
Made an atm ,)sphere of gladness 
Seem encircling all the earth. 
One bright morning, at the altar, 
A white bridal dress she wore, 
Then my wife I 
proudly made her 
And I 
asked for nothing more.

tell thee how dear thou art ! 
Yet, all ! misery's all that we have, love, 
And poverty chilleth the heart! 
We cannot go on thus forever, 
No matter how solemn our vow ; 
'Twere better far, tho' broken hearted, 
'Twere better to separate now 
Oh! how can love's breathing be murmured 
By lips so thin and wan ? 
How can the old charm woo thee and win thee, 
When that charm is withered and gone 
I 
am feeble, I 
am but woman, 
And perhaps, the moment is nigh, 
When with my last breath, 
Oh I 
my own one, Shall mingle love's latest sigh / 
Thoult forgive me if my words vex thee; 
But what I 
feel, that I 
must say; 
Yet know, love, in want and in sorrow, 
That I 
am thine and thine always I 
Yes ! I 
love thee, and well thou knowest, 
There was never affection more true; 
And I 
love thee better and stronger, 
in bidding thee ever adieu! 
WHEN NIGHT COMES O'ER THE PLAIN. 
Wiwn night comes o'er the plain, and moonlight o'er the sea, 
Oh I 
meet me once again, where oft I've welcomed thee. 
When first the glow-worm's ray iliumes the verdant lea, 
l'il leave my lonely way, and wander forth with thee. 
How dear is every spot, where oft in youth we strayed— 
The mountain and the cot, the streainlet and the glade, 
The tree whose branches hung above the flowing rill, 
Upon whose banks we sung the songs that haunt me still. 
Repeat: 
The tree whose branches hung, &c. 
At evening's quiet hour, Oh ! leave thy quiet home, 
And seek the peaceful bower to which we used to roam. 
sing the olden songs, the lung neglected lays, 
Whose brightest theme belongs to youth's departed days. 
How dear is every spat, where oft in youth we strayed—

Upon whose banks we sung the songs that haunt me still.

I SEE HER STILL IN MY DREAMS. 
While the flowers bloom in gladness and spring birds rejotoe, 
There's a 
voice in our household of one gentle voice; 
The form of a 
loved one hath passed from the light, 
But the sound of her foot-fall returns with the night. 
For, I 
see her still in my dreams, 
I 
see her still in my dreams; 
Though her smiles have departed 
From the meadows and the streams. 
CHORUS. 
I 
see her still in my dreams, 
I 
see her still in my dreams: 
Though her smiles have departed 
From the medows and the streams. 
Though her voice, once familiar, bath gone from the day. 
And her smiles from the sunlight hath faded away: 
Though I 
wake to a 
scene now deserted and bleak, 
In vision I 
find the lost form that I 
seek. 
For I 
see her still in my dreams; 
I 
see her still in my dreams; 
Though her smiles have departed 
From the meadows and the streams.

ARAB STEED, 
Oh, give me but my Arab steed, a 
shield and .1'alchion bright,

His noble crest I'll proudly wear, and gird his scarf around; 
But I 
must to the field repair, but I

For, hark! the trumpets sound! hark! hark ! hark the trumpets

Oh ! with my Arab steed I'll go to brave the embattled plain, 
Where warriors brave their valor show, and drain each noble 
vein : 
His brow that oft the battle braves, with fadeless laurels crowned:

-45O THEY MISS ME AT HOME? 
Do they miss me at home, do they miss me? 
"TWould be an assurance most dear, 
To know that this moment some loved one 
Were saying, I 
wish he was here ; 
To feel that the group at the fireside 
Were thinking of me as I 
roam; 
Oh I 
yes, 'twould be a 
joy beyond measure, 
To know that they missed me at home, 
To know that they missed me at home. 
Whh 
twilight approaches, the season 
That ever is sacred to song, 
Does some one repeat my name over, 
And sigh that I 
tarry so long ? 
And is there a 
chord in the music 
That's missed when my voice is away, 
And a 
chord in each heart that awaketh 
Regret at my wearisome stay, 
Regret at my wearisome stay 2 
Do they sit me a 
chair near the table, 
When ev'ning's borne pleasures are nigh, 
When the candles arc lit in the parlor, 
And the stars in the calm azure sky? 
And when the " good nights" are repeated, 
And all lay them down to their sleep, 
Do they think of the absent, and waft me 
A whispered " good night," while they weep, 
A whispered " good night," while they weep? 
Do they miss me at home, do they miss me 
At morning-, 
at noon, or at night? 
And lingers one gloomy shade around their, 
That only my presence can light? 
Are joys less invitingly welcome, 
And pleasti-res less bale than before, 
Because one is missed from the circle, 
Because I 
am with them no more, 
Because I 
am with them no more?

Drinking Song from the Opera of" Lurline." 
As in the cup the bead flies up 
Joy and delight ascending,

Life with glad rapture blending.

Naught on earth can equal this, 
Eyes that sparkle, lips that kiss 
Naught on earth can equal this.

Joy with its glow bestowing.

SONG AND DANCE.

Music by E. N. CATLIN. 
It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as se turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies: 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
"fwas love among the roses. 
Cumus.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then T 
must; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes; 
And how we met, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes: 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, ct,:e. 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, dr,c. 
The Spring had come, the flowers 
The birds sung out their lay--; 
:Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first, saw Maggie May : 
:She had a 
ro:,!
-Itish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the -day : 
And how I 
loved her ! none- can tell, 
.INly little Maggie May. 
CII 0ItUS 
in bloom, 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie sin. ,ing all the day. 
Oh I 
how I 
love her ! none cmi tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
7Thouol years rolled on. yet still 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
`Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c. 
;May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may -call her mine, 
My own dear Mag ,ie May. 
For, she is all the-' world to me, 
Although rum far away : 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May.

WHAT WILL YOU DO, LOVE E 
By SAmurt LOVER. 
What would you do, love, when I 
am going, 
With white sails flowing the seas beyond, 
What will you do, love, when waves divide us,. 
And friends may chide us for being fond ? 
Tho' waves divide us and friends be chiding. 
In faith abiding I'll still be true, 
And FE pray for thee on the stormy ocean,. 
In deep devotion—that's what I'll do. 
What would you do, love, if distant tidings,. 
Thy fond confidings should undermine, 
And I 
abiding 'neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes were as bright as thine 
Oh ! name it not !—tho' guilt and shame 
Were on thy name—rd still be true I 
But that heart of thine should another share it, 
I 
could tact bear it—what would I 
do? 
What would you do, love, when home returning, 
With hopes high burning, with wealth for you, 
if my bark which bounded o'er foreign foam, 
Should be lost near home—ah! what would you do 
So thou wert spared, I'd bless the morrow, 
In want and sorrow, that left me you_! 
And I'd welcome thee from the wasting billow,. 
This heart thy pillow—that's what I'd do I 
A PLACE IN THY MEMORY, DEAREST. 
.10 
41. 
A place in thy memory, Dearest, 
Is all that I 
claim 
To pause and look back, when thou heatest 
The sound of my name 
Another may woo thee nearer, 
Another may win and wear— 
I 
care not though he be dearer 
So I 
am remembered there! 
Remember me not as a 
lover, 
Whose hope has been cross't, 
Whose bosom can never recover 
The light it has lost. 
As the young bride remembers the mother„, 
She loves, though she never may see— 
As a 
sister remembers a 
brother, 
Ohl Dearest, remember me! 
I'd be thy true love, Dearest, 
Oeuld'st than smile on me I 
I 
would be the fondest and nearest 
That ever loved thee 
.But a 
cloud on my pathway is glooming,, 
That never must burst upon thine; 
And Heaven that made thee all blooming, 
Ne'er made thee to wither or pine I 
Remember me, then; oh! remember 
My calm light love ! 
.Tho' bleak as the blasts of November 
My 
Jife may prove: 
That life will, though lonely, be sweet, 
If its brightest enjoyments should be 
• .A 
smile and kind word when we meet,,, 
And a 
place in thy memory!

It is only a 
week since. to-morrow, 
That we both of us met at a 
dance, 
He said that he knew the new &nix temps— 
In fact, that he'd learned it in Franee. 
I 
said, " Very good, then we'll try it"— 
He went off with a 
skip and a 
jump, 
And somehow he quite lost his balance, 
And came down on the floor with a 
thump. 
CHORUS.- I've been thinking, &c. 
-He said be could ride like a 
jockey, 
So pa mounted him on a 
horse, 
I 
said, " Shall we go across country 1" 
He replied: " My dear Mary, of course "— 
The first hedge and ditch I 
led over, 
And thought Jim would follow all right, 
But the horse threw him into the ditch, sirs, 
And there he sat yelling with fright— 
CHORUS.- I've been thinking, & c. 
He said he could shoot like Ricardo, 
So one day pa lent him a 
gun; 
He went out at ten in the morning, 
But came back to luncheon at one— 
I 
said, 
Pray, what have you made, Jiml" 
(I saw my words cut like a 
knife) ; 
He said, " That the birds were so wild now, 
And he'd never shot worse in his life." 
ClIORCS.-I've been thinking, & c. 
I 
must bring my song to a 
finish, 
With just one odd word of advice 
To all the young men who are present, 
I 
mean those who may wish to be nice: 
Don't say you can do what you can't, sirs ; 
Don't say you can't do what you can 
For believe me, the worst of all bores, sirs, 
Is a 
bumptious and bragging young man.

have sung you, 
And Pro sure that ere long you will see 
That telling a 
fib is exactly 
The same thing as B. R. A. G

COME SIT BY MY SIDE, LITTLE DARLING. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
Your hands are as fair as the lilies, 
That blossom in the shadows of green, 
And their touch has magical power, 
My heart from all sadness to wean. 
CHORUS. 
Come sit by side, little darling, 
O 
And lay your brown head on my breast) 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
I 
dream when your arms are around me, 
That life is an infinite calm, 
Your kiss has the spell of a 
charmer, 
Your kiss that is sweeter than balm. 
Oh! what could be sweeter than dreaming 
This dream that is on us to-night ? 
Let us think of the present, my darling, 
The future is out of our sight. 
Come sit by my side, & C. 
Sing low in the twilight some ballad, 
As sweet as the smile on your face, 
That shall thrill me with melody's sweetness, 
And touch with its words tender grace. 
And I'll give you a 
kiss when it's ended, 
A 
kiss that the singer shall earn, 
And perhaps, do you hear, little darling ? 
I 
shall ask for a 
kiss in return. 
Come sit by my side, &c.

I 
cannot sing the old songs,

Their melodies would waken 
Old sorrows from their sleep; 
And though all unforgotten still, 
And sadly sweet they be,

cannot sing the old songs; 
They are to') dear to me;

Have set my spirit free,

For all eternity ; 
My voice may know the old songs

In the spring- time of life, air ! yes, onward we glide, 
With a 
clear stream beneath and a 
full swinging tide, 
Never heeding the ripples that pass by our side, 
Nor into the depths even peep. 
With success at the helm, then 'tis pleasure to row, 
While all things with us and the tide seem to go 
So smoothly along o'er the clear stream below, 
▪ 
Though quicksands beneath us, beneath us may leap, 
We cast, then, around. us wit's keen piercing shaft, 
All's taut in life's frail bark, the wind's fair abaft, 
While we gaze with delight on our neat trim- built craft, 
Nor dream that still waters, still waters run deep.

In the hey-day of life, when with ardor we burn, 
Unobserved by ourselves oft the tide 'gins to turn, 
Air ! then at some cost 'tis too often we learn, 
As age slowly on us doth creep, 
Our bark on its voyage should be well stored in youth, 
With a 
compass to steer by, whose pole should be truth, 
With white sails of wisdom well-trimm'd, then forsooth, 
And look-out ahead, yes, ahead we must keep. 
The God then above us our pilot will be, 
With faith our sheet-anchor we'll venture to sea, 
Though the voyage may be long, safe in port we shall be 
If we mind that still waters, still waters run deep. 
In the spring- time of life. &c.

Disdain not thy lover to hear, love, 
his heart is oppress'd with sad care, love, 
In pity then shed one kind tear, love, 
And open thy lattice to me. 
The night is swift passing away, love, 
And losing its glaom in the day, love ; 
Then show ol thine eyes but one ray, love, 
Ere I

The stars are deserting the skies, love,

Then has•en to cheer these fond eyes, love, 
And open thy lattice to me.

After years of life together, 
After fair and stormy weather, 
After travel in far lands, 
After touch of wedded hands, 
Why thus joined, why ever met, 
If they must be strangers yet— 
Strangers yet—strangers yet 
After childhood's winning ways. 
After care, and blame, and praise, 
Counsel asked and wisdom given, 
After mutual prayers to Heav'n, 
Child and parent scarce regret, 
When they part are strangers yet— 
Strangers yet—strangers yet ? 
-Mil it ever more be thus, 
Spirits still impervious ? 
Still we never fairly stand, 
Soul to soul, as hand to hand ; 
Are the bonds eternal set 
To retain its strangers yet — 
, Strangers yet— strangers yet!

0 my lost love, and my own, own love, 
And my love that loved me so! 
Is there never a 
chink in the world above 
Where they listen for words from below ? 
Nay, I

grieved thee sore, 
I 
remember all that I 
said, 
And now thou wilt hear me no more, no more, 
Till the sea gives up her dead.

Till the sea gives up her dead, 
Till the sea gives up her dead, 
And now thou wilt hear me no more, my love, 
Till the sea gives up her dead. 
Thou didst set thy foot on the ship, and sail 
To the ice-fields and the snow; 
Thou wert sad, for thy love did nought avail, 
And the end I 
could not know; 
How could I 
tell I 
should love thee to-day, 
Whom that day I 
held not dear ? 
How c,m1d I 
know that I 
should love thee away, 
When I 
did not love thee a-near ? 
Till the sea, &c. 
We will walk no more the sodden plain, 
With the faded bents o'erspread ; 
We shall stand no more by the seething main, 
While the dark wrack drives derhead ; 
We shalt part no more in the wind and the rain, 
Where thy last farewell was said; 
But perhaps I 
shall meet thee and know the again 
When the sea gives up her dead.

HAPPY AS A KING, 
Now there are many ups and downs, as thro' the world you 
ramble, 
No matter where you are, go where'er you may ; 
To get a 
bit of grub, its a 
hard thing to scramble, 
But to go along and push ahead, you'll have a 
turn some day. 
Now I 
don't care a 
jot. I 
take things rough and ready, 
Trouble and misfortune away from me I 
fling ; 
I 
put up with things hot, like Dubbin's old " Neddy," 
With my pipe and my pot, Lord bless you, I 
am as happy as a 
king. 
Now there's my old wife, she's very tall and slender, 
And like all the feminine, ain't she fond of tongue ? 
If I 
tell her just to hold it, Lord bless you, it offends her; 
So says I, " never mind, you can go it while you're young." 
Sometimes she blows me up, while I'm smoking by the fire, 
The pipe sends up the chimney, the kettle begins to sing : 
The smoke goes out of the house, but her voice is Leoz.1 much 
higher, 
But then I 
does'nt mind, I'm as happy as a 
king. 
The other night while in bed, fast asleep and snoring, 
I 
was awakened by a 
peculiar thumping at my head; 
And very soon afterwards I 
was lying on the flooring, 
For my blessed wife she kick'd me out of bed, 
But I 
slept like a 
top, all night upon the landing; 
In the morning lit my pipe, so merrily did sing, 
" 
Cheer, boys, cheer,' just at daylight's dawning, 
A 
fig for devil's blue, l'm as happy as a 
king. 
The other morning, while at breakfast, I 
upset the milk jug, 
The milk and pot both went upon the floor, 
When in return, at my head came the hot teapot, 
Which scalded all my pate, and left me very raw. 
Next over went the table, the grub, and water-cresses, 
Did I 
not dance, when I 
heard tbe crockery ring; 
J 
sung, "Home, Sweet Home," as I 
was picking up the- pieces, 
All the time my wife was whacking me, I 
was happy as a 
king. 
Then be of my fraternity, I'm a 
chap vot never hollers, 
Care is but a 
silly calf, life is but a 
span; 
Take things rough and ready, just as they may follow, 
Live like a 
brick, and do all the good you can. 
Never mind your wives, the women all are vixens, 
But let them have their own way,•much pleasure they will bring; 
And if they like to whack you, let them for amusement, 
And all the time they're doing it, you'll be happy as a 
king.

Believe me, if those endearing young charms, 
Which I 
gaze on so foully to-lay, 
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms, 
Like fairy gifts fading away, 
Thou would'st still be adortd as this moment thou art, 
Let thy leveliness fade as it wIll, 
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart, 
Would entwine itself verdantly still. 
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own, 
And thy cheek's unprofaned by a 
tear, 
That the fervor and faith of a 
soul can be known, 
To which time will but make thee more dear. 
Oh, the heart that has truly loved never forgets, 
But as truly loves on to the close : 
As the sunflo,%er turns on her god, when he sets, 
The same look which she turned when he rose.

Oh ! cast that shadow from thy brow,

Is there no spell in

There are wild roses in my hair, 
And spring and morn have lent their bloom, 
But you have breathed tbeir fragrant air, 
As some d vapor frem the tomb! 
I 
took my lwe for ( no sad song, 
I

The wild sad notes we've lived so long 
You never smiled though Leila sting: 
Nay, speak not now. it mocks my heart ! 
Ah ! how can hope live when love is o'er? 
I 
only know that we must part, 
I 
only feel we meet no more; 
I

TERENCE'S FAREWELL TO KATHLEEN: 
So my Kathleen, you're going to leave me 
All alone by myself in this place, 
But I'm sure you will never deceive me, 
Oh, no, ff there's truth in that face. 
Though England's a 
beautiful city, 
Full of illigant boys, oh, what then— 
You wouldn't forget your poor Terence, 
You'll come back to old Ireland again. 
Och, those English deceivers by nature 
Though may be you'd think them sincere, 
They'll say you're a 
sweet charming creature, 
But don't you believe them, my dear; 
No, Kathleen, agra ! don't be minding 
The flattering speeches they'd make, 
Just tell them a 
poor lad in Ireland 
is breaking his heart for your sake. 
It's a 
folly to keep you from going, 
Though, faith, it's a 
mighty hard case— 
For, Kathleen, you know there's no knowing 
When next I 
shall see your sweet face; 
And when you come back to me, Kathleen, 
None the better will I 
be off, then— 
You'll be speaking such beautiful English, 
Sure, I 
won't know my Kathleen again. 
Ah, now, where's the need of this hurry, 
Don't flutter me so in this way— 
I 
forgot 'twix grief and the flurry, 
Every word I 
was mainino• to say. 
Now just wait a 
minute, r 
bid ye— 
Can I 
talk if you bother me so ? 
Oh, Kathleen, my blessings go with ye, 
Ev'ry inch of the way that you go. 
THE PILGRIM OF LOVE. 
A hermit who dwells in the solitudes crossed me. 
As wayworn and faint up the mountains I 
press'd; 
The aged man paus'd on his staff to accost me, 
And prother'd his cell, as my mansion of rest: 
Ah I 
nay, courteoos father, onward I 
rove, 
No rest but the grave for the pilgrim of love. 
Yet tarry, my son, till the burning noon passes, 
Let boughs of the lemon- tree shelter thy head; 
The juice of ripe n!:tscatel flows in my glasses, 
And rushes fresh pulfd for siesta are sproad : 
Ah ! nay, cour' sous father, onward I 
r ) ve, 
No rest but V.,: grave for the pilgrito of love.

BY 
W. T. Waimiros, (Author of " Her Bright Smile Haunts me still.") 
When birds are singing in the trees, 
And nature's face is fair, 
Where wild flowr's bring the busy bees, 
I 
often wandered there, 
To meet young harry in the grove,— 
But where can harry be ? 
I 
placed a 
letter to my love 
In yonder hollow tree; 
In yonder hollow tree, 
In yonder hollow tree; 
I 
placed a 
letter to my love, 
In yonder hollow tree. 
No " Postman's knock," or ringing bell, 
No maids to peep and see, 
Dear Harry knows this very well, 
lie's sure to come to me. 
Young Cupid watches near 
The lover's hollow tree, 
he'll see me safe, I've nought to fear, 
While Harry's true to Inc ; 
Dear Harry's true to me, 
Dear larry's true to me ; 
Hell see me safe, I've nought to fear, 
Dear Harry's true to me. 
FADED FLOWERS. 
The flowers I 
saw in the wild, wild wood 
Have since dropped their beautiful leaves, 
And many dear friends of my childhood, 
have slumbered for years in their grave. 
But the bloom on the flowers I 
remember, 
Though their smiles I 
shall never more see, 
For the cold chilly winds of December, 
Stole my flowers, my companions from me, 
The roses may bloom on the morrow, 
And many dear friends I 
have won, 
But my heart can part but to sorrow, 
When I 
think of the ones that are gone, 
"Bs no wonder that I 
am broken-hearted, 
And stricken with sorrow should be, 
For we have met, we have loved, we have parted. 
My flowers, my companions, and me. 
How dark looks this world and how dreary, 
When we part from the ones that we love, 
But there's rest for the faint ad the weary, 
And friends meet with lost ones above. 
But in heaven I 
can hut remember, 
When from earth my proud soul shall be free, 
That no chilly winds of December, 
Shall steal my companions from me.

DARK-EYED SAILOR. 
'Tis of a 
comely young lady, fair, 
Was walking out for to take the air; 
She met a 
Sailor. upon the way ; 
So, I 
paid attention to hear what they did say. 
Fair maid, said he, why roam alone ? 
For, the night is coming, and the day's far gone 
She said, while tears from her eyes did fall: 
It's my Dark-eyed Sailor that's proving my downfall 
There's two long years since he left this land; 
A 
gold ring he took from off my hand ; 
Ile broke the token : here is half with me, 
And the other is rolling at the bottom of the sea. 
Cried William Drive him from off your mind ! 
As good a 
sailor as him you'll find ; 
Love turns aside, and cold does grow, 
Like a 
winter's morning, when the hills are clad with snow. 
These words did Plebe's fond heart inflame. 
She cried: On me you shall play no game! 
She drew a 
dagger, and then did cry: 
For my Dark-eyed Sailor a 
maid I'll live and die ! 
His coal-black eyes and his curly hair, 
And flattering tong- tie, did may heart ensnare ; 
Genteel he was; no rake like you, 
To advise a 
maiden to slight the Jacket Blue. 
But a 
tarry sailor I 
will never disdain, 
But always I 
will treat the same ; 
To drink his health here's a 
piece of coin ; 
But my Dark-eyed Sailor still claims this heart of mine. 
When Willaim did the ring unfold, 
She seemed distracted, 'midst joy and woe. 
You're welcome, William; I 
have lands and zold. 
For my Dark- eyed Sailor, so manly, true, and bold ! 
In a 
cottage, down by the river-side, 
in unity and love, they now reside. 
So, girls, be true, while your lover's away : 
For, a 
cloudy morning oft brings a 
pleasant day !

The pride of all the village and the fairest in the dell, 
Is the Queen of my song, and her name is Fairy- Belle; 
Erhe sound of her light step may be heard upon the hill, 
Like the fall of the snow-drop, or the dripping of the rill. 
CHORUS. 
Fairy-Belle, Gentle Fairy-Belle, 
The Star of the night, and the Lily of the day ; 
Fairy- Belle, the Queen of all the dell, 
Long may she revel on her bright sunny way I 
;lie sings to the meadows, and she carols to the streams; 
lte laughs in the sunlight, and smiles while in her dreams; 
Her hair, like the 
down, 
1.ornp upon tb 
air. 
.And her heart, like the Itinuming-bird's, is free from ev'ry care. 
Fairy-Belle, tix. 
Her soft notes of melody around me sweetly fall ; 
'Her eye, full of love, is now beaming on my sou:; 
The sound of that gentle voice, the glance of that eye 
Surround me with rapture that no other heart could sigh,

ROCK ME TO SLEEP, MOTHER. 
Word o 
by FLORENCE PERt, T. 
Music by ERNEST LEs 
Backward, turn backward, 0 
Time, in your flight 
Make me a 
child again, just for to-night 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart, as of yore. 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair, 
Over my slumbers yo—..r 
loving watch kaep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rc4k me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart, in a 
loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep I 
Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love, like mother-low, over has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures, 
Faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours. 
None, like a 
mother, can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.; 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep 
Clasped to your heart, &a. 
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again, as of old; 
Let it drop over my forehead to-night, 
Shading my faint eyes away from the light, 
For, with its sunny-edged shadows, once more, 
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore, 
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart,

Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds werettinging in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning.

And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning- k 
ssed her brow, 
And Vayed with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twos time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers came, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And as he lingered by her side, 
Despite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning.
