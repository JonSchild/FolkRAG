Shaun Notdurft interview, 2015-03-22 : interview conducted by Nathan J.
Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy
INTERVIEW LOG
00:00:20  Name is Shaun Notdurft.  Lives in Springfield, Oregon, but works in Eugene, Oregon.
00:00:30  Has worked as a direct support professional (DSP) for 21 years.  Works with clients 
with developmental and mental disabilities.  
00:01:00  Home care workers work in homes that are owned or rented by clients.  Clients of 
DSPs live in group homes managed by a company.
00:01:37  Had friends who worked for Oregon Supported Living Program (OSLP).  Was 
introduced to clients and thought work was fascinating.  
00:02:05  Previous jobs: worked in department store, worked as landscape laborer, delivered 
Wall St. Journal.
00:02:27  Previous jobs involved making money for someone else.  His labor now goes directly 
to clients.
00:03:09  Special qualities needed?  Patience, assertiveness, boundary setting skills.  
00:03:57  How did you learn the skills?  Trainings provide general understanding, but you cannot
teach a style.  Workers develop individual relationships with clients.  Takes training every two 
years on recognizing and redirecting problem behaviors.  
00:05:30  Developing a style – a balance between the client's history, individual support plan, 
and the ability to think outside of the box.  You have to improvise; similar to playing music.  
00:07:23  Is there such a thing as a typical day in your field?  It depends on the house.  Some 
clients work, others participate in community activities.  Typical activities depend on the day of 
the week.
1
00:08:34  What kinds of activities do you do with clients?  Community inclusion – examples: 
taking clients to bar and store.  
00:09:41  Relationships with clients – Avoids forming friendships.  Is somewhat different from 
other DSPs.  Successes and failures of clients should belong to them.  “I support, I guide, but I 
don't own any of it.”  Workers who get too close to clients become co-dependent and burn out.  
00:11:44  Maintains distance but does not “snub” client.
00:12:49  Some clients have family members in area.  He sometimes communicates with family 
members, which can be helpful for understanding behavioral issues.
00:15:53  Insider talk among DSPs – There are a lot of  “insider jokes.”
00:16:20  Question asked by Don Stacy: What is “house culture”?  In a “medical house,” clients 
have intense physical needs; culture is nurturing.  In behavioral houses, you have to possess a 
“paradox personality"; must be extremely individual but work as a team player, too.  A worker 
who is unable to set boundaries becomes “weak link.”  Important for a good “house culture” to 
organically develop.  Currently employed in a house with 7 workers.  All workers and clients are 
males.
00:19:09  Humor is important, but needs to be about changing energy flow and never be 
malicious.  Humor between staff is different than humor with clients.  Co-worker humor takes 
place away from clients.  Laughter provides physical stress release.
00:21:30  Some houses socialize outside of work.  Shaun's house has staff meetings every other 
week.  Humor dialed back around administrators.  Describes co-workers as having “crass” senses
of humor.  Humor would be different if co-workers were women.
00:23:29  Inside humor – Clients have certain idiosyncrasies.  “If you're not in that setting, and 
therefore know that individual, you'd have no basis to understand what's happening or the riffing 
on that.”  
00:24:30  Acronyms describing different care professionals are not interchangeable.  DSPs 
provide care in homes, but not home care workers.  PSWs are much closer to home care workers 
except that they are hired through brokerages.  DSPs go to an established work site, which also 
serves as a home for clients.  There are OSHA standards even though work occurs in a home.
00:26:35  Serves as president of the local for OSLP and chief steward.  Handles contract issues, 
bargaining.  Also on board of directors for statewide union.  Represents members in private 
non-profits.
2
00:27:40  Union duties depend on the issue.  Gives explanation of steward duties.  Has equal 
standing with management when acting as steward.  Enjoys problem solving aspects.  Union 
allows workers have a say about the type of care provided to clients.  Worked at OSLP for three 
years before forming a union.  Primary reason for organizing into SEIU: to have a protected 
voice on the job and be a part of the lives and the plans of the people for whom they care.  
00:30:45  Comment by Don Stacy, who also works as a DSP, about DSPs not being allowed to 
strike.  Only half correct.  DSPs cannot strike while collective bargaining agreement is in effect.  
If agreement expires, DSPs have right to strike, but have never come close to striking.  Discusses
possible scenarios for a strike.
00:33:07  Some clients are aware of union, want to be involved, and have gone to Salem to lobby
on behalf of DSPs.  Workers try to keep union issues out of day-to-day care.  
00:33:49  Goes to many “lobby days” at the State Capitol. 
00:34:48  There can be a rally atmosphere, but lobby days more about meeting telling stories to 
legislators.  Important to get on their radars.  Feels change happens in conversation with people 
who hold purse strings.  
00:35:30  Sharing personal stories is important.  Union used to focus a lot on clients' lives, but 
now focusing more on what workers need.  Emphasizing the importance of workers who have 
been in the field for a long time. 
00:37:50  Has no children, which is an anomaly in field.  Can afford low wages.  A lot of good 
DSPs left the field because they could not provide for their children.
00:39:52  Starting wage close to Oregon's minimum wage.  Home care workers and personal 
support workers start at a wage that is higher than a DSP's top pay.  Don Stacy discusses 
“topping out” at $12.90 per hour.  
00:40:55  A big benefit of being a DSP as opposed to a personal support worker: DSPs have set 
schedule and PSWs' schedules are set by clients. 
00:42:20  Discusses oversight of DSPs in comparison to personal support workers.  State 
inspects group homes with “fine tooth comb"; this does not happen in “in-home situations.”  
00:44:02  Discusses trainings DSPs take each year.  Mentions that home care workers are trying 
to get more trainings in their field.   
3
00:46:03  Most interesting training: Oregon Intervention System training; focuses on recognizing
when a behavioral issue is becoming present before it is full blown.  Has used techniques to 
avoid a bar fight.  
00:47:41  Most appealing aspect of your work?  It varies.  The one that is most present is the 
knowledge that clients' lives are directly impacted by the work.  
00:49:53  DSPs do not produce a commodity. “In our field of work, we don't have anything 
concrete like that other than when we go back to the next day and they're still there and they're 
still living a good life.”  Workers provide consistency, trust, and even love.  
00:51:02  Agrees that legislators and others may not know DSPs exist because they do not 
produce a consumable commodity.  People in the community gravitate toward positive stories 
and think work is fun.  There are unpleasant stories too.  Gives example of having furniture 
thrown at him.  Staff who know how to handle difficult situations should be supported.
00:54:14  How do you relax?  Plays and listen to music.  Likes to read history.  Hobbies 
represent “bigger picture stuff” beyond daily work.     
00:56:00  Main reason for DSPs being paid less than other care providers: only two unionized 
group home providers in Oregon.  Nursing homes seeing improvements in wages and conditions 
due to neutrality agreement with employers.  Difficult to organize in private sector.   
01:00:19  Thinks only way DSPs will gain power is if there is a neutrality agreement that allows 
union organizers to talk to workers without backlash.  
01:01:11  The employers have own union: The Oregon Rehabilitation Association (ORA) is 
anti-union.  And lobbies legislators.  Possible that legislature will see that unionization has 
helped the nursing industry. 
01:03:51  Is there solidarity between the different types of care providers in the state?  There is 
now.  OSLP organized in 1996 and then home care workers organized later.  There has been 
competition between groups, but this is something Shaun and other union activists are working 
to defeat. 
01:05:54  Most DSPs are women because the job is perceived as “women's work.”  
01:08:15  Some houses are male-only due to behavioral issues.  Could change if certain clients 
leave.  Clients have a choice if they want to work with women or men.  Don Stacy notes that it is
more common to have a house that consists of mixed-gendered staff members.  
4
01:10:10  There are DSPs who have been home care workers.  Some workers at OSLP are also 
home care providers and/or personal support workers.  Some DSPs have left OSLP to become 
home care workers.  
 
01:15:10  Does the community at large understand what DSPs do?  If you ask people, they will 
say they do not know anything about it, but if you point out a DSP working in the community, 
people will recognize them. There is more visibility than there is conscious knowledge.  
01:16:11  Discussion between Shaun, Nathan, and Don about the “Look Me In The Eye” 
campaign in Eugene, Oregon — a campaign to acknowledge and respect people with 
developmental disabilities.  Shaun provides historical background of campaign.  
01:18:15  Wonders if community members think DSP workers are family members of volunteers.
You cannot provide enough services with volunteers.  
01:19:25  Work done by DSPs cannot be done by anyone else.  Home care workers cannot help 
clients without homes.  Argues that the “home care model” does not work for everyone.  Also 
talks about possible industry changes.
01:23:47  Discussion between Don Stacy and Shaun about “good shepherd moments,” or 
moments when community members refer to DSPs as saints.  Well-meaning, but discounts the 
work.  Important “It's not a disservice to us to see us as compassionate, but if they assume that 
our value derived from our work is that compassion, then why would they want to care about our
paychecks.”  
01:28:05  Some people enter the field because they think it's “god's work.”  They do not last 
long.  Continued discussion of this topic.  
01:32:43  Would like to retire as a DSP, but there are physical factors.  May transition to an 
ombudsman/advocacy position.  
01:40:16  Mentions that there are many for-profit houses for similar types of clients.  Some have 
high turnover rates.  Many for-profit care companies are not local and administrators live out of 
the area. 
01:46:20  End of interview.
