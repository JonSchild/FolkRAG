History: McKenna was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1961.  His dad got a job in the 
Chicago area when McKenna was four years old and they moved to Palatine, Illinois.  He 
graduated from high school there, attended Harper Community College and then he 
joined the Air National Guard.  He was accepted into a program that taught him how to 
fix electronics, specifically for military communication radios, which gave him the skills 
to repair other types of equipment, such as printing equipment. 
 
 
 
00:02:38 
Career: McKenna jumped from one repair position to another when he was younger, 
then in 1986 he was hired by a company that sold step and repeat machines to the 
printing industry.  This was his first experience in field service.  The company expanded 
a few years after he joined and bought smaller companies that made hardware and 
software for the commercial packaging industry.  This allowed them to create a service 
where a client could design a box, make a layout that fills a sheet, and also make a die 
and the print job would match the die because they were made with electronic files.  He 
traveled a great deal to fix various machines Monday-Thursday and on Friday he 
received his assignment for Monday.  He learned how to use the CAD System because 
one week, when the instructor for a training class was out sick, he was required to teach 
the class.  Then in 1990, a new, more heavy duty, box cutting machine was designed that 
could produce more in a day, since American companies were producing 50-80 products 
a day.  They were more sophisticated and sturdier than the older machines and they were 
similar to what is still used today.  The new machines had tops that were designed by 
companies that produced airplane wings and Formula One race cars, and the motors in 
the new machines were much faster. McKenna describes having to teach CAD Systems 
and how to use these machines to older gentlemen in the early 90s, who were used to 
making boxes by hand and needed him to explain how to use a computer in general.  The 
first library he worked with for box-making machines was the New York Public Library, 
which he went to in order to talk to them about the CAD System.  He did his first library 
installation at Indiana University.  Stewart Welsh, the founder of Conservation by 
Design, made archival boxes and sometimes recommended that his customers get a 
machine for themselves, and so he had a deal with AG CAD and Exact Technology to get 
commission on these sales.  McKenna eventually made a deal with Welsh and Peter 
Miller of Exact Technology and AGCAD Ltd. to do trade shows together.  This led to 
sales to the Library of Congress, UC Berkley, HF Group, Mid-Atlantic, and Gaylord 
Brothers.  The price of a custom box started to drop due to this, however, so universities 
stopped buying the machines themselves.  Some places only produced set-sized boxes 
instead of doing custom boxes, and this contributed to the market of boxes available as 
more university libraries wanted their books to have enclosures.

Interesting Projects: McKenna worked with Ken Springle and others at New York 
Public Library.  Eventually he moved that machine from the main library to Long Island 
City where they built a Library Services Center, where it is still housed today.  Indiana 
University Library installation was spread over a period of time because they were 
building a new facility, called the Auxiliary Library Facility (ALF).  So McKenna 
installed it in one of the main libraries for a few months, then it had to move to the ALF, 
where someone was then hired to run the machine.   
 
 
 
00:23:22 
Career: By 1992 all that McKenna was doing was trainings for the CAD System and 
cutting tables, going to trade shows, and doing sales.  There was new technology 
emerging at the time, but through bad investments in certain companies, McKenna’s 
employer could not keep up with competition and went bankrupt in 1998.  Many people 
were laid off but McKenna continued to work for the company from their office in 
Manchester, New Hampshire.  He was offered a job selling CAD Systems to machine 
shops, and so he took this position and left the bankrupt company.  He managed to keep a 
lot of the documentation that he had, which he would use later.  Suddenly, still in 1998, 
he began receiving calls from people looking for the McKenna they remembered who 
would come and fix their equipment.  They were looking him up in phone books and 
calling him to see if he could do repairs instead of making them pay for new systems, 
which he could easily do at a fraction of the cost.  He began traveling to these repairs on 
weekends, and then his sales job started to not work out.  So, he left his position and sent 
a letter to all of the addresses where he had installed machines.  He got many responses 
from this and started building a new business this way.  His first year was bit of struggle, 
but he made though thanks to large orders.  In 1999 he started fixing computer systems 
for Y2K by putting a Windows interface on Dos Computers.

Change in Business over Time: When McKenna began his career there were 
approximately 15,000 commercial box makers in the United States.  Over time this 
number has shrunk to around 5,000 due to small shops being bought by larger 
companies.  Equipment has also improved to a point where one shop with high end 
equipment can do what used to take three shops to accomplish.   
 
 
 
00:35:28 
Interesting Projects:  McKenna also upgrades and repairs boats.  He has worked on 
several boats in the Chicago area.  One of his main projects is installing radio equipment 
in boats that gives the user sailing information on their iPad from various instruments.  
He does his best to keep up with technology, and can do many repairs because they are 
based on the same electrical principles he learned in the Air Force.  His mentality when 
fixing a machine is to treat it as though it is his own.  This motivates him to do a good 
job and fix every problem that he would find, instead of just fixing the issue he was sent 
to fix.  He enjoys going mostly to small “mom and pop” shops who are trying to make 
their machines last.  
    
 
 
00:40:01 
Future: In commercial box making there are still new machine designs produced 
regularly.  New technology always proposed for box making, such as laser cutting, but it 
never really works and so machines are still the same basic designs.  He does not know if 
technology will become much different.  Some places are automating how to put sheets 
onto the cutting table, but this is the only major technological step he has seen.  
 
 
 
00:45:10 
Interesting Projects: McKenna once went to Johannesburg, South Africa to fix a 
machine.  He once had a gentleman come up to him at a trade show who told him about a 
die-making counter cutter he had bought and needed help upgrading.  McKenna flew 22 
hours to South Africa and installed the upgrade in 2 hours.  He went back the next day 
for preventive maintenance (PM) to make sure things were clean, intact and safe to use.  
Some machines have parts that have to be replaced consistently, so these must be 
checked.  Then he went on a two day safari.  Another project of McKenna’s dealt with 
the development of the counter cutter.  The company in England designed a new router 
head with new tools, but when McKenna tried to install his first machine with one of 
these new heads, it would not keep the sheet on the board flat.  So McKenna went to 
England and helped design a machine that would mill plastic sheets.  After many failed 
attempts, McKenna and one of the English workers thought that maybe the sheet was too 
thick to suction to the service correctly.  They realized that the more flexible the material 
the easier it would stay.  They sold twenty of these machines in the United States and two 
of them are still in operation in Ohio.

Advice to Next Generation: McKenna says the field is not easy.  He travels a great deal, 
and he has not been home longer than two weeks since 1986.  It is not an easy lifestyle, 
but it can be fun.  “Learn how to do something, and then learn how to do it really well.” 
Machines that are being produced now would require starting young and going to a 
technical college.  McKenna fell into a niche that he did not think he would be in, but he 
made connections and friends, and found repeat customers and success.   
 
 
 
00:57:00 
Greatest Accomplishment: McKenna has enjoyed mostly being his own boss for the 
last 20 years, and it allows him to do the work he wants to do and also have the time to 
do fun things like sailing.  He feels lucky for the position he has been able to achieve in 
his life.  
 
 
 
00:58:14 
Mentors: Larry Tachna was a great technician and John Galliger was great at 
troubleshooting and working with customers.  Phil Firmanski encouraged McKenna 
when he first started, and showed him some insights into the industry and a business 
framework.  His tax preparer, Steven Siegal, has also been helpful since McKenna started 
his own business.
