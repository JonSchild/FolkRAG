9/6/91A. I arrive in Monterey around 9:30 a.m., which gives me an 
hour to eat breakfast  and poke around downt.n_wn.. Figueroa St. is

I meet Jerome Lucido at the public library. Re s 61, a retired 
banker dressed in 
yachting clothes: white cap, blue and white

Jerome and I head for the Rand-a-zzo house on Seeno Street on•• 
"Garlic Hill," a mostly Italian, mostly Italian fishermen 
neighborhood that rises steeply from the waterfront. The 
Randazzos have passed away but their kids still let the oldtimers 
build the Santa Rosalia float in the backyard. Six women are 
stapling white, feathery, pinata-like paper to the float, a brand 
new one designed by Frank Crivello and his son Peter, who's 
studying for _the -pri.esth_oo_d. One  of the women

old float was an arch design, this one is like a gazebo, four-
sided, with arched pieces extending from the cornerposts and 
meeting overhead in the middle. "This year," says Vitina Spadaro, 
who's in charge, "we decided it's time to change and give a new 
look to it. A lot of time, love and effort to make it look 
beautiful." 
PI)ICS-a 
While the women work, two older men in ballcaps sit on a 
wicker love seat, watching and commenting. When one of them asks 
what time they're going to eat the others tease him for being so 
interested in food when he's not doing any of the work. I get the 
sense the float-building is a very merry social occasion, year 
after year, as satisfying as the procession itself. The 
conversation switches almost sentence by sentence, from English 
to Italian. "The older people express th-•e1ve.•hetter in the 
> 
'' 
••o 
old language,4' one of the women tells me." Kids on bikes an 
an 
old cabin cruiser complete the scene. 
rs. Spaddaro tells me she's been involved in the procession 
since the age of seven, the year she came over from Sicily, when 
she was dressed as an angel and rode on the float bearing the 
statue of Santa Rosalia from San Carlos Cathedral to the 
fishermen's wharf. She dashes across the street to get a photo es—F 
that shows her in costume, on the float. This photo is 
borrowable. I tape record a brief interview with her under trying 
conditions: the skies of Monterey are busy with military 
aircraft. She tells of kneeling and praying to the saint. "From 
then on," she says, "I felt she was looking at me, knowing I 
6 10

FRANK/Fieldnotes 
would continue to honor her ... I remember as a young girl how hard 
the oldtimers worked to make the float and all the hours they 
spent working on it. With them in mind I want to be able to carry 
on this tradition." 
Her father, Giuseppe Spadaro (which also happens to be her 
husband's name ) was skipper of the boat Marettimo , named for the 
island the family was from. He's 96 years old. Mrs. Spadaro's 
daughters were angels after her and now her grandchildren are 
going to be angels in this year's procession. The statue came 
from Palermo in 1935 -- the year the festival was inaugurated. 
Santa Rosalia is actually the patron saint of Isola delle Femine, 
a small island off the coast of Sicily. The festival was 
initiated by four women from Pittsburg, California, who came to 
Monterey with their husbands in the early days of the sardine 
fishing industry. 
The growth and decline of the festival have been linked 
with the sardine fishery, Lucido explains. During its heyday, 
Monterey was one of the largest fishing ports in the world. When 
the sardines mysteriously disappeared in the late forties, many 
fishermen either moved away or got out of the business, and 
participation in the festival began to wane. (Anna Sardina sites 
her name as proof that—_'.alter all there are still some 
sardines.")  Thishermen who re _ 
main fish for the local markets 
and restaurants , catching squid , salmon, crabs, shrimp and sand 
dabs. In 1973 Lucido organized the Italian Heritage Society for 
the express purpose of ensuring that the festival would survive. 
I take pictures of the work on the float (color prints, 
stupidly, instead of slides) as well as a portrait of all present 
when the float is done: Frank and Mary Crivello, Casper and 
Paolina Aliotti, Anna Sardina, Vitina and Joe Spadaro, Jerome 
Lucido 
Peggy and Frank Flores and Marian Aliotti.

9/6/91B. Next Lucido and I go out for lunch. Her recommends the 
Friday afternoon sole and calamari special at the restaurant 
across the street from his old office at the Bank of America. 
He's pleased to see an advance about the festival in the MoDte_.ey>Gi?T 
Herald. They had complai n e
d 
to the paper about lousy coverage in 
T6As F, 
ercent years. According to the Herald, the fishermen ask Santa 
PAST 
Rosalia for two things: safety at sea and a bountiful catch, 
tsSLr•,S 
There is also a calendar listing for the dinner-dance and 
coronation of the festival queen at the San Carlos parish hall on 
Saturday night. Jerome has a ticket for me to attend. 
I'm curious to know how this Sicilian immigrant wound up as 
a bank vice-president instead of a fisherman, so I ask about it. 
Jerome 's father had already put in several seasons as a fishermen 
in the U.S. when he got his draft notice in Italy and decided it 
was time to leave for good. His brothers were already here and 
shrewdly started one of the canneries. They gave Jerome's father, 
a job as _fish inspector "whatever that was -- they used to play a 
lot of cards." An d he sen t a ll seven o f hi s ki ds to college.

a new language and leave friends and family. He fished one 
season, was seasick all the time , and got a job as a teller at B 
of A, studying and working his way up the ladder. 
Jerome says, "Sicily was active and big before Rome was even 
born. Rome is a baby." Friends who have moved to Nevada stop by 
our table to say hello. The woman says people ask how she could 
leave her roots in Monterey to live in Nevada. Her response is, 
"What 's a root?" But she's back in town, as are many native sons 
and dau hters , for the festival.

9/ 6 /9 1C. After lunch , Jerome takes me on a tour of the procession 
route . We start at the cathedral. There's no action at the parish 
hall. In the chapel itself, we visit the statue of Santa Rosalia, 
which stands in the upper corner of the right hand nave . She was 
repainted two years ago at the shop at the Carmel mission . Lucido 
fisures the  
g_"sn statue is  roughly 
life-size : people were ' 
smaller in the Middle Ages. Rosalia is 
depicted as a young woman, 
with flowing auburn hair, a blue cloak trimmed with gold, 
downcast eyes and downturned mouth. She bears a skull and a book. 
Her story is that of a young woman who renounces wealth and 
position to live a life of prayer and penance in a cave in the _ 
hills above Palermo. 
From the cathedral we drive the parade route: north on 
Figueroa, west on Webster, northwest on Munras to the Custom 
House Plaza . We park near the plaza to walk past the fish 
markets , restaurants and shlocky shops (one of them is called the 
Casa Karmel Korn ) of Fishermen 's Wharf to where the priest will 
bless the fleet and Jerome himself will read off the names of the 
fishermen lost at sea . We stop at the bronze statue of Santa 
Rosalia , sculpted by local artist Richard Lutz . In commissioning 
the work, Lucido says he wanted it to have a lot of motion to it, 
to impl y "i

Monterey (Palermo 1132-September 4, 1166. This monument is 
respectfully and gratefully dedicated in memory of those 
courageous Sicilian fishermen whose labors and pioneering 
spirit, at the beginning of the 20th century, created and 
developed a great sardine industry and whose heritage and 
culture contributed significantly to the growth of this City 
and surrounding areas.

business. So you pray to God that your life will be spared in 
the coming fishing season and you ask Santa Rosalia to also join 
you in prayers to God." Then back to the festive part of the 
festival: "It's also a great day of fun because we add that 
feature to it."

9/7/91. I divide the day between the bocce tournament and the 
parish hall where coronation committee chair Lena D'Aquanno and 
helpers are decorating the hall for the party- - lucido figured I'd 
also get to talk to the folks who are tenderizing squid and 
cooking sauce, but Lena has already made the sauce and the squid 
won't be tenderized until Sunday morning. The most striking 
elements of the bocce tournament are all the Italian regalia --
red, white and  
green caps, jackets and shirts, all the Italian 
spoken and all the participants droe Pittsburg area --
reaffirming that historic link between Pittsburg and Monterey. 
Bocce is the perfect Italian sport because of how much 
socializing (the culturally inappropriate words, "kibbitzing" and 
"schmoozing" come to mind) can go on while it's being played. 
There are a couple of women's teams.

because it's guys his age who will determine

back, squeezes your elbow and tickles you. I go

company. 
Back at bocce again, they're serving lunch: the inevitable 
fried calamari, ham and salami and provolone on little hard 
rolls, green salad and melon. On the lunch line, one player 
consoles another. "Don't worry about it," he says. "You haven't 
lost a house." "We haven't lost a house," the disconsolate player 
concedes, "but we played bad." I sit down with Frank Crivello and 
Joe Spadaro, my friends from yesterday's float building. These 
guys are the behind the scenes workhorses of the festival, I get 
the sense. Joe's a retired fisherman. Frank worked at the giant 
PG&E power plant at Moss Landing. After we eat I put on the 
recorder, but have the same problem of planes overhead that I had 
on Garlic Hill. Crivello talks about what the festival was like 
at its height, when people were invited onto the fishing boats for 
barbecues. Spadaro talks about how, as a fisherman for 50 years, 
the traditions associated with the blessing of the fleet are 
important to him. His wife drops by the bocce tournament direct 
from the hairdresser's I'd wager, to check on the setting up of 
the booths and folding chairs on the plaza. Again, I take color 
prints of the bocce players.

9/7/91B. The queen coronation dinner. This is a formal event. (I 
had to go to a thrift store and buy a $4 tie to make myself 
presentable.) One of the bocce players from this afternoon, a 
skinny guy in a big white cap who was never without a Tareyton 
cigarette dangling from his lips, is wearing a tuxedo as father 
p_ra 
? 
of one of the queen candidates. Most of the men are wearing 
suits, but there are a couple of shirts and sweaters and one 
young guy is wearing a polo shirt. The parish hall is squarish in 
shape. Long tables line the sides of the room. Between them on 
one side of the room is the band, the Nite Owls. On the other 
side is the stage with runway. It is decorated in classical 
(white cardboard) columns up which green paper vines creep, with 
a classical white cardboard pediment over a paper mural taped to 
the wall of a terrace with a marble floor, statuary, cypress 
trees and a blue, puffy-clouded Mediterranean sky. Pots of white 
and yellow chrysanthemums line the runway and perch on the 
columns. DellaSala's podium is draped with an Italian flag. 
Another Italian fla$,_ with the _wQd_s_"Italian Heritage_ Society_of •
if- 
iiferey Peninsula'_' and an anchor in the middle (white) panel 
hangs on one wall. Each table has roses in crystal vases and a 
small bouquet of red and white balloons. 
After an hour of no-host cocktails (Frank Mercurio delivers 
on the drink he promised to buy me earlier in the day), Lena 
D'Aquanno welcomes everyone, as does Chuck DellaSala. Msgr. 
Brendan McGinnis gives the invocation and it's dinner time: 
salad, garlic bread, fried, breaded prawns, steak, mostaccioli• 
and green and yellow squash, carafes of rose wine, followed by / 
pistachio ice cream, cannoli and coffee. 
After the meal and some dancing (the band plays Italian 
standards like "Volare," "Arrivederci Roma," and "The Godfather" 
theme as well as such jazz standards as "Take the 'A' Train") 
,Dk

FRANK/Fieldnotes 
it's time for the coronation. This used to be done on the basis -
of which candidate sold the most raffle tickets, now it's a game 
of chance. The four names are 
put in a drum, with the first to 
be drawn the third runner-up, on down to the last, who is thus 
the queen. The candidates, with fluffed hair, low-cut dresses and 
tiaras, are preceded by a pair of little girls, then 
escorted by 
their fathers or grandfathers down the center of the room to the 
steps of the runway. They do a little fashion model spin on the 
runway before they sit down. Invited dignitaries -- the vice-
mayor of Monterey, a city councilwoman, the parish priest and the 
monsignor draw the names from the drum, a few past queens are 
introduced, and the dancing resumes. Tomorrow morning all of us 
will gather at the same place to form the procession. 
_4w-)•F-F)9oEolI, A 
1.6 /8 /91A. Pre-procession. The calamari preparations are in full 
swing when photographer Ken Light and I arrive around 7:30. 
Around the same time, Frank Crivello and Joe Spadaro pull up 
with the float and carry the statue of the saint out of the 
church. I ask Peter Crivello, studying for the priesthood, what 
the festival means to him. "It's a link with the past and it 
brings with it renewed hope for the future. It's passing on a 
legacy. They came here and they never forgot the past ... Culture 
and faith are integral. We express our faith through our culture. 
They came, they prospered here , but they never forgot who they 
were ... It's part of the Italian culture to have processions and 
outdoor festivals." When he was little, Peter marched in the 
parade in a carabiniere's uniform. I'm about to ask him something 
else, but the priest summons him and he runs off. 
I rejoin Ken on Figueroa Street where the queen and 
princesses, angels in lavender, pink, baby blue and yellow, 
chubby carabinieri, Knights of Columbus in their plumed hats and 
bandsmen in their red vests are milling around. Lena D'Aquanno 
works on hitching the insipid white horse with the blue mane and 
hoofs that looks like it was pulled off a supermarket carrousel 
to the magnificently carved and—painted Sicilian two-wheeled 
cart, and ­ on 
t e mast and hanging the bunting from the 
ipnt-sized 
 fishing boat float. 
"My family used to be all fishermen," Lena says. "It seems 
like we want to keep the tradition. It's a great thing because 
every year we get together. It's a lot of work, a lot of 
headaches . You get upset, sometimes things don't go right. It's 
very expensive, too. Somehow every year we manage to do it. We do 
the best way we can and every year our reward after is we feel 
good about it. It's a tradition we do year after year. More th 
anything, it's religious. I do it with all my heart." 
In addition to coordinating the coronation dinner, Lena made 
30 gallons of sauce to be served with pasta and sausage at the 
Sons of Italy booth, and cannoli filling and shells. TTie_little

herself, 
in a white Mercedes 10) the Santa Rosalia float with the>A•ZIT 
four angels sitting at the four corners of the gazebo. 
The crowd of spectators on this cool gray morning is thin 
at first , thicker as we get closer to the plaza. At the plaza, 
six fishermen in white shirts and black pants , lift the statue 
off the float and carry it on a litter toward the wharf. At the 
entrance to the whraf;"t_9_e_procession pauses 
while the queen 
and princesses lay a__X.r_Q.aLb at the foot of the bronze Santa 
Rosalia statue . The procession down the narrow wharf , with the 
spectators becoming part of the procession and the saint's head 
bobbing above the crowd, has an old world , medieval look to it. At 
pier 's end, the wreath is tossed in the water , the priest blesses 
the fleet , the names of the fishermen lost at sea are read (the 
assembly says "Lord have mercy " after each name) and the 
procession returns to the plaza, the statue to the float. 
Jerome Lucido sings the American and Italian national 
anthems , the queen puts a crown of flowers on the statue's head 
\
and the mass begins. The plaza is packed . After the mass , Panetta 
says a few words , as does Italian Consul-General Marcello 
Griccioli and Councilwoman Teresa Canepa. 
When it 's over I corral Panetta before he rushes off to get 
him to say something. He says: "It's a focal point for the 
Italians to remember their heritage and remember their ancestors\ 
and the contributions they made to the country. It's their 
special day to remember they 're really Italians... It's a good 
/ 
chance for the whole community to get together and see old 
friends, old faces and old remembrances." Panetta , by the way, is 
a fisherman 's grandson who himself used to walk in the 
procession when he was an altar boy at the church. 
The crowd hangs in a lot longer this year than it did when 
we were here two years ago. Lucido says the entertainment is 
better this year. In 1989 I remember pulling up a chair in the 
near-empty plaza at around 3 p.m. to have something to eat and 
drink . There were no empty chairs at the same time this year. The 
plaza was as crowded at 3 as it had been when the procession 
arrived at 11.

Their are brief video interviews with Frank Crivello and 
Jerome Lucido, but the strongest stuff, I suspect, aside from the 
procession footage itself, will be the crowd shots, shots of 
people dancing, of musicians , of cannoli making in Lena 's booth, 
and of the bocce tournament. Lucido summed things up pretty well 
when he said , "The festival means a lot of things to different 
people : religion , fun, an opportunity to meet friends and 
relatives you've not seen since last year. It's also a source of 
pride. As Italian-Americans many of us are involved in the day to 
day life of the city and county . This is the one time of the year 
when we just let go." 
When I spoke to Jerome on my first day in town he talked 
about the unifying nature of the festival, which I think is true 
in two ways: it unifies the community, which is the way he meant, 
but it also unifies its diverse elements -- bocce tournament, 
procession , blessing of the fleet , dinner-dance, reunion, music, 
feast . I had wondered if those who take the religious side of it 
seriously, like Mrs. Spadaro and Mrs. D'Aquanno, were offended by 
its more secular aspects, but that doesn 't seem to be at all the 
case. In a true festival the sacred isn't adulterated by the 
secular . Rather, the secular is made sacred "by association," by 
its role in the overridingly sacred process of affirming 
community. From all that I've seen and learned about Italian 
culture in San Pedro, Gilroy and Pueblo, the Santa Rosalia 
Festival is the quintessential Italian event.

9/2 6 /9 1. Frances Tarantino. Mrs. Tarantino, age 72 (b. 1919 in 
San Francisco) lives alone on the opposite end of town from North 
Beach, where she was born and grew up. Her husband died a year 
ago: whenever she mentions him, or her father, who died young, 
she gets weepy. But her weepiness and expressions of piety 
alternate with very hard-nosed talk about the costs of the 
various components of the Madonna del Lume Festival and the 
laziness of her fellow members of the Societa de Santissima Maria 
del Lume who count on her to do all the work. 
Mrs. T is a tiny, well-dressed woman with nicely styled 
pepper-and-salt hair and a line that appears along the 
length of her nose when she is speaking emphatically, which she 
often is. At those moments she waggles a reproachful finger in my 
face, admitting,`Ifv I sit in my hands I can't get my point 
across."

The living room, where we have our interview, is decorated 
in what I've come to think of as the Sicilian style: curlicues on 
the button-upholstered furniture, gold frames on the pictures, 
everything ornate and immaculate (she admits she's a maniac about 
cleaning). Over the dormant fireplace hangs a portrait (taken by 
Al Baccari in 1959) of her daughter in a wedding gown. This photo 
t/ 
was not taken on her wedding day, however, but on the day of the 
Maria del Lume festival. A wedding_gown is what the queen__o.f_thg

Out of habit, I ask the usual IAW questions about family 
background and upbringing, though I'm mainly here to learn more 
about the festival. Her family -- Carini is the family name --
and her husband's family are from Porticello in Sicily. The two 
families didn't know each other, however. Her father, Giuseppe, 
came first to Milwaukee and worked on the railroad for a time. He 
came out to San Francisco to visit friends or family from 
Porticello, I think: "As soon as he hit Fishermen's Wharf, he 
fell in love with it." Naturally, he became a fisherman. 
Mrs. T then tells the story of her parents' whirlwind 
courtship. He didn't know the Carini family, but had heard they 
had a pretty daughter so on the pretext of making the 
acquaintance of his fellow townspeople from Porticello, he went 
to visit. After the first visit he came back with an offering of 
fish and to play cards with her father. On that second visit he 
declared his intentions and married her before he left to fish in 
Alaska. 
Her memories of growing up in a fisherman's family include 
helping her father make and repair nets; Columbus Day outings 
where the whole fi s hi ng fl eet wou ld ta ke the ir families across 
A•;"•'` 
the bay in their boats for a picnic; going with her father as

Her father-in-law, also named Giuseppe, was a fisherman as

her father as a qu ie t, ki n d man , the type who never raised his 
hand or shouted -- or needed to: he would give his kids "the 
look" and that was enough. Frances takes the picture of St. 
Joseph up to Petaluma, where her daughter lives, every year for 
St. Joseph's Day. She also makes a table on that occasion. 
"I was brought up to take care of people," Frances says. She 
took care of her father be fore he di e d at the age of 43. His last 
words to her were, "God's going to reward you with 100 years of 
life for what you've done for me." Frances went to work 
in one of the canneries on the wharf to help support the family. 
She was later the floor manager at a five-and-dime and helped her 
husband with his electronic repair business.

It was her mother-in-law, Rosa Tarantino, who got the 
festival going in 1936. "We want our Madonna del Lume from 
Porticello here," she told the priest. A painting was 
,•,YGt'commissioned -- this painting now hangs in between the two bed's 
in Frances's bedroom -- a society formed by the ex-pats from 
Porticello, banners sewn and the procession organized. Earrings 
and necklaces were raffled off to pay for everything. As 
daughter-in-law, Frances' helping her mother-in-law it 
automatic: she'd have killed me." The tickets were sold and the 
work done by "all paesani, no outside people." 
In those early days there were two bands, one at each end of 
the procession. Now there's only one, a cost-cutting measure. In 
those days the procession went down to the wharf then returned to 
SS. Peter and Paul. Now it's a one-way trip. Then, as now, there 
was a float for the painting of the Madonna on which little girls 
dressed as angels rode. She tells of painstakingly decorating the 
float, flower by flower (now they use baskets): "It had to be 
perfect. And I'm that way, too. If the money's not there, it'll 
come." 
/f 
In 1942, there was talk of not having the procession because 
'Italians who had not become American citizens were forbidden on 
the waterfront. Fearful that the festival would die out, they 
stayed away from the wharf and had the procession around 
Washington Square Park. "Rain or shine," Rosa said, "she's going 
to go out." Frances points out that "she (Madonna del Lume) is the 
only saint that goes out. That's a heritage we have from the old 
country. Why kill that heritage?"

The story of the Madonna del Lume goes like this: there were 
some fishermen from Porticello caught in a storm. They followed a 
light that led them to a cave where they found a bronze image of 
the Madonna. They brought the bronze back to Porticello, but the 
next day it was gone: restored to its cave. Then the fishermen 
wowed to build a church in the Madonna's honor. This was 200 
years ago. The church, and the bronze that is part of its altar, 
are still in Porticello. Unlike Santa Rosalia, then, this saint 
was not a local, Italian, historical personage, but the Madonna 
herself. "The blessed mother is one," Frances explains. 
"Different titles." The festival in Porticello is a three-day 
affair, the biggest celebration in Italy, according to Frances. 
Given how important the Madonna is in her life, I'm surprised 
Frances hasn't been to Porticello to take part. She says she's 
been too busy taking care of her father, then mother, then 
husband to make the trip. But I get the sense her involvement 
with the festival has more to do with her sense of devotion to 
\,her family than with her sense of connection to the old country. 
Frances took over the organizing in 1975 "and it's been my 
/headache ever since ." She does it, she says, "for the love o f th e 
t••• Madonna. She creates a lot of miracles . I've seen them. I love 
0-0 
her as if I were born in the town. From the day I got married 
it's embedded in me. You touch my heart, she's there. It' s a har d 
thing to explain. I've asked her for a lot of things." 
Last year, her husband, Steve, was dying and she prayed to the 
Madonna to get him to the church. She tells of struggling to get 
him dressed, of how she got him to light candles and take 
communion. He stayed at a relative's house in North Beach during 
the procession, but hung on for a family dinner that night. The 
next day he entered the hospital and died shortly after. "He was 
very devoted to her," Frances says of her husband. "He had the 
love for her just like his mother ... She had that love and she 
gave it to me and her son. That's why I say I'm not going to do it 
anymore, then I do it." This is a very long story, but it's a 
jewel. The climax goes like this: 
My prayers were to the Madonna del Lume: "Madonna del Lume,  
you're to have a good day. This is your day that the people  
are gonna honor you. Don't let nothing happen. Let everything  
be A-one. Tomorrow, I'm willing to accept whatever you send  
to me. You know eight o'clock the next morning, all hell  
broke loose in this house. He entered the hospital and never  
came out. 
Just yesterday, Frances tells me tearfully, her husband 
spoke to her, asking if she had thanked Madonna del Lume 
properly. She plans to do so tomorrow, in church, on uncushioned 
knees. She also found out this week that her queen is sick and 
isn't going to make it so she had to scramble to find a 
replacement.

Frances is convinced that when she goes, the festival will go 
with her. With good reason: she does all the work. Her daughter 
is a logical successor, but she lives in Petaluma. The society 
has 60 members, but they're lazy, Frances says. "I believe I have` 
more faith in Madonna del Lume than you people who were born 
there," she tells them.

When the tape runs out she takes me around the house to show 
e the painting of the saint, the gorgeous banners, spread across 
the two beds, other prints and statues of St. Joseph and_St. 
Apthony in other rooms of the house: "We got saints all over the 
glace." - Downstairs in the garage are the festival paraphernalia: 
American and Italian flags, plastic plates and cutlery, _fake. 
flower-b-ouquets, _sashes and crowns for the festival_ queen and

of---the Societa. 
She fumes that no one has been by to pick up any of this stuff: 
they expect it to be delivered. And she fumes that the plates and 
cups and such were delivered to her house instead of the church -
- one more thing to worry about. Needless to say, she loves doing 
it, worries and lack of help and all.

10/5/91A. Fishermen's Memorial. The Madonna del Lume society 
gathers at the little chapel on Fishermens Wharf. There's a 
bronze plaque to the left of the entryway, with this inscription: 
Benedic Naves istas detera tua sancta... 
Bless these ships and all who sail hereon, as you blessed  
Noah's ark in the deluge ... Send your Holy Angel from heaven  
to watch over them and those on board and keep them safe at  
all times from every disaster.  
Al Baccari provides a kind of introduction to the mass, 
summarizing the dual purpose of the Madonna del Lume festival: to 
ask for the Madonna's help in securing a good harvest and to 
honor the memories of those lost at sea. He also delivers a kind 
of eulogy for Frances Tarantino's son-in-law, Steve Cresci, who 
drowned while swimming just the week before. Cresci, he says, 
"lived under the umbrella of family love ... That tradition is very 
special to those who come from Sicily." Many of the women begin 
crying at the mention of Cresci. For Mrs. Tarantino especially, 
who lost her husband soon after last year's festival, this latest 
tragedy has made the week of preparations leading up the festival 
a painful time. Baccari continues: "What makes the Festival of \ 
Madonna del Lume so precious is we recognize family unity -- la 
famiglia." 
The mass begins, led by Father,Jerr_y—Bonje.an, whose cream-
colored vestment has a red, stylized cross in the shape of a boat 
anchor running down the center, a set of three wavy blue lines at 
the bottom of the anchor and another set of three just above the 
center where two gold fish are crossed. With gulls crying and 
seals barking in the background, views of pelicans and fishing 
boats out the windows, Father Bonjean reminds the congregation 
that the apostles were fishermen, "used to hard work, used to

taking chances. When Jesus died, after the reusrrection they said, 
Let's go fishing.'" 
Father Bonjean also tells a story about Father Joe, an 
Italian priest connected with the Silesian mission in Monterey 
who begged off when others would picnic on the beach. "'I'm 
scared of the sea,' he said. 'It's so immense. You look at it you 
don't see anything but water, water, water."' Father Jerry also 
speaks of "the call of the water, the call of the myteriousness 
of the water ... Our deceased fishermen leave us with a sense of  
bravery. We can ask their prayers from the great fishing waters/ 
of heaven. 
After mass, the women, startlingly, sing a hymn to the 
Madonna del Lume, concluding by crying, "Viva la Madonna del 
Lume, viva! Then, there's coffee and pastry outside on the wharf 
before the voyage in a bay tour boat of the Red and White Fleet. 
About 50 people board the boat. I count an escort of nine 
fishing boats -- the Mary C, the Monika N, Stoma's, the Piknik, 
the Jennifer Louise, the Albert K and the Orca -- down from last 
year's 28 boats. Ken Light is taking stills on a boat owned by 
Dominic Cresci. 
q 
On the outbound voyage I chat with Rose and Carlo Crivello. 
Carlo is a retired fishermen. "Every time you go out," says Rose, 
"there's an angel on your shoulder." Carlo chimes in, "I had to 
have God on my shoulder or I would have been dead." And he tells 
a story of nearly being run down by a ship in a fog: "They 
would've thought they hit a piece of wood." After the close call, 
Carlo says, "For 10 minutes, we couldn't say one word. Whoever's a 
fisherman believes in God." The Crivellos went down to Monterey 
for Santa Rosalia. "I ate everything," Rose says, "the pizza, the 
cannoli, the calamari. I said if I get sick, I don't care." 
We approach the Golden Gate Bridge. The day is gray, but 
mild and not too windy. Father Jerry is now wearing a windbreaker 
and a watch cap. A little girl distributes red carnations from a 
basket. Father Jerry uses the ship's PA system to tell everyone 
when to toss flowers and bouquets into the bay. "We don't have  
any cemetery to go to," says Mary Dorio of Monterey, whose 
\ 
husband, Leonard was lost at sea 17 years ago. "This is just what  
we have. Everybody here, if it's not a nephew, a husband, a 
 
cousin, a son. It brings me back. It's a very touching,  
sentimental time. He loved that sea. There was nothing else he  
wanted to do in his life. You live with that danger all the time.  
These families are all connected. They all have family up and  
down the coast."

10/5/91B. Columbus Landing, Aquatic Park. John Riccio, a young 
lawyer who is this year's president of the Columbus Day 
Celebration, introduces Queen Isabella, her first and second 
duchesses, the queen mother, the princess and a lady-in-waiting, 
resplendent all, in their gaudy costumes. The "ladies" (they' re 
really teenage girls) are escorted to their thrones by Knights of

Columbus. When they are seated, three flamenco dancers (one of 
whom is Asian) perform for them and the spectators, seated in the 
bleachers. I notice Jerome Lucido in the crowd, who tells me he's 
scouting the landing of Columbus for his own Columbus 
quincentenary in Monterey.

Three fishing boats, with Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria 
banners hanging from their bridge railings, motor into the little 
lagoon at Aquatic Park, accompanied by a city fire boat, spraying 
from all its hoses. A troupe of "Indians," in Aztec headdresses, 
arrives on the scene to welcome the Admiral of the Ocean Sea to 
their shores. About the same time, a group of demonstrators with 
placards decrying the glorification of Columbus the Mass Murderer 
gathers. Rowed ashore in a dinghy, Columbus, in the person of Joe 
Cervetto, Jr. (Joe Sr. is looking on from the bleachers), greets 
t 
the natives and jams his sword into the sand, claiming the land

for Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain. At that, the demonstrators 
begin jeering. "This is a racist act," cries one. Another 
compares the celebration to "asking every Jew here to celebrate 
Hitler." A third cries, "Put Columbus on trial." The National 
Park Police manages to ease the demonstrators off to one side so 
the program can continue. 
While the Columbus people play a canned version of the Star 
Spangled Banner, the demonstrators, several of whom are Native 
Americans with braided hair, moccasins, bluejeans, Ray—bans and 
leather jackets, beat on a drum and chant. This so incenses one 
of the Knights of Columbus that he goes over and gets in their 
faces before a park policeman intercepts him and gets him to back 
off. 
Next, Isabella knights the kneeling Columbus, then the 
"Aztecs" perform some folk dances to music that sounds like 
Mexican folk or popular music of -- I'm guessing here -- 35 to 75 
years ago. David Giannini, president of the Columbus Day 
Celebration addresses the crowd -- and the hecklers -- who chant, 
"Shame" and, "Tell the truth." Quite a sneak preview of what's to 
come at the Columbua Day parade, to say nothing of next year's 
festivities. 
10/ 6 /9 1. Frances Tarantino and the rest of the Societa de la 
Madonna del Lume gather at the Church of SS Peter and Paul in 
North Beach to decorate the float and prepare the lunch that will 
be served after mass and before the procession in the parish 
hall. The ladies are arranging sliced ham, salami, mortadella, 
turkey, cheese and tomatoes on trays while Carlo Crivello slices 
sandwich rolls. The women are wearing tan dresses, blue rope belts 
around their waists and blue lace kerchiefs on their heads. 
Outside, the float is decorated with white papel picado with 
blue trim. Two silver anchors, draped in fish net are at the 
front, the Fishermen's Wharf crab logo, stapled to a ship's wheel 
between them. Behind all that are capstans that serve as 
pedestals for baskets of flowers. Behind the capstans is a kiddie 
pool trimmed with blue and silver papel picado and with white

a platform, is Mrs. Tarantino's painting of the Madonna del Lume,

hearts trimmed in white and blue. "When I was a kid they used to 
use real flowers," an old man comments.

Almost immediately, a man named Enzo Storniolo, dressed in white 
shirt, black pants, red neckerchief and red sash around his waist 
begins chanting very loudly in Italian. The only phrase I can 
make out is, "Viva la Madonna del Lume, viva!" which the ladies 
answer in kind. They then sing the same hymn they sang the 
day before in the chapel on the wharf. Andrea Asciutto,  a tailor; 
then recites a poem he wrote about the Madonna del Lume festival 
in Porticello. All this occurs quite spontaneously, for the 
benefit of our camera.

The procession begins, in this order; the "Prep a

and Angela Alioto on foot; the Societa ladies in their beige 
dresses and blue belts and kerchiefs; the float, with girls in 
angel costumes and Knights of Columbus marching alongside, three 
drummers; hangers-on in street clothes. 
"Viva la Madonna del Lume, viva!" the women cry. "Viva la 
Madonna Santissima." And they sing hymns. The procession files 
down the northbound lanes of Columbus Ave. (the southbound lanes 
remain open), turns right on Hyde Street between the Cannery and 
Ghirardelli Square and turns right again on Beach St., 
Fishermen's Wharf's main drag. It comes to rest at a platform set 
up between Castagnola's, Tarantino's and Alioto's restaurants 
with the Guinness Museum of World Records across the street. Al 
Baccari introduces the notables, the Italian then the American 
national anthems are sung, and there is a moment of silence for 
poor Steve Cresci. 
Joe Alioto takes the mike and addresses the crowd in 
Italian, concluding with "Viva Sicilia." Then in English: "I want ••• 
to tell you something. It's great to be Sicilian, not just today,/ 
but everyday. 
And then he enumerates Sicily's g re a t

writers as evidence of the "great culture Sicily has given to the 
world." And, "As long as we remember la Madonna del Lume San

women respond, of course, "Viva ... viva!"

The ceremonies wind up with Father Bonjean talking about the 
blessing of the fleet: "We bless the sea and the boats that go 
out onto the sea..." He then makes his way along the wharf, 
flicking holy water at all the boats. 
10/9/91. Joe Cervetto, Sr. San Rafael. Lunch is served: a platter 
of peppers, celery, carrots, giardiniera, etc; another of salami, 
pancetta and headcheese; two kinds of cheese; bread; wine. All 
this is followed by a bowl of spaghetti marinara, which is 
followed by grapes and melon, which are followed by espresso and 
carrot cake. Whew! 
It's a busy day in a busy week. Already, a local TV news 
crew has been at the house to interview Joe about Columbus. The 
week is an endless round of dinners and functions. Over coffee, 
I turn on the tape recorder and set about my own interview. Joe was 
born in Genova in 1908 and came to the U.S. in 1933. "Nobody gave 
me nothing," he says. "I cleaned toilets. I washed windows." He 
evidently did very well in the janitorial business: the house is 
quite large and right on the water. Until recently a cabin 
cruiser was parked outside. It's name: the Santa Maria. 
He first portrayed Columbus in 1957. "The crowds used to be 
more larger," he says, "not like the other day. There was nobody 
there." It was his idea to have real Indians portray the Indians. 
The year the American Indian Movement took over Alcatraz, Joe got 
tackled by a protester as he made his landing. People were 
saying, "Go home, Columbus." Cervetto's response: "It's crazy to 
say to us 'Go home.' His response: "The one that was more strong 
got the land. This is life. This is history ... Columbo was a 
navigator. He was a sensible man. He did that for business, for 
adventure. He had to use some force but he got what he came for." 
So did the TV news people, I'll wager. Now the Indians are 
portrayed by Mexicans. 
"It's an honor for me to portray Columbus. I portray 
Columbus with feeling, not just to portray like an actor. I do it 
because I believe in the greatness of the man. He was an  
outstanding man ... Columbus represents for Italians the most  
important person. He discovered a new world. America is bigger  
than Europe, is richer than Europe ... You get crazy. I've been to  
the place he was born, I've been to the place he landed, I've been 
to the place he died."  
Needless to say, he wants the Columbus Day celebrations to 
continue. I ask how the celebration has changed over the years. 
Before, it was parade, bocce, dinner, dance. Now soccer, tennis 
and golf tournaments have replaced the bocce. Before, queen 
candidates sold raffle tickets. Now the city gives the Columbus 
Day Celebration Committee money from hotel tax funds. During 
World War II, the landing was held in Washington Square instead of 
on the waterfront. Next year he hopes to enact the landing from 
the Santa Maria replica that's supposed to sail into San Francisco 
Bay for the quincentenary. Joe Cervetto, Jr. took over his 
father's role in 1988. "He's getting to be OK," says Joe, Sr.

10/13 /91 Columbus Day Parade , San Francisco . There 's action on 
every block south of Market St. off the Embarcadero: Spanish 
girls adjusting their costumes , a color guard practicing 
maneuvers, marching bands tuning up, twirlers twirling. Queen 
Isabella 's float is decorated in white with red hearts. A very 
large heart is mounted behind her throne The theme of the Sons of 
Italy float is "Days of Wine and Roses ": it features a grape 
arbor , wine press and wine barrels. 
Next to the Sons of Italy float I chat with two Emilias -
Emilia Emerson and Emilia Glessi . "We're here ," Mrs. Glessi tells 
me, "because Columbus himself was an Italian. He discovered this 
country and we are very proud of him as a Genovese ." (Mrs. Glessi 
herself is from Venice . She rattles off the names of some other 
Italians to be proud of: Fermi , Verdi, Marconi , Tintoretto, da 
Vinci , "and a lot of saints besides." 
As with most parades these days, the floats are interspersed 
with fancy cars and horses. The Italian Consul General, Marcello 
Griccioli , is riding in an Red Alfa Romeo. Cesar Gonzalez-
Palacios, his Spanish counterpart , is in the car behind. Joe 
Cervetto , Sr., the former Columbus (1958-1988 ), now dapper in a 
brown three -piece suit and fedora , is in a pink Cadillac 
convertible . Father Jerry Bonjean, pastor of S.S. Peter and Paul, 
rides in car with a banner explaining that he is the "Spiritual 
Director of the Christopher Columbus Celebration ." Former Mayor 
Joe Alioto is the grand marshal. His daughter , Angela , as well as 
the rest of the mayoral candidates and assorted other politicians 
and public officials each rides in his or her own car. A fire 
engine is labeled, "Proud to Be San Francisco Itlian 
Firefighters." 
Many of the entries -- there are 169 in all -- have nothing 
to do with Columbus Day. There is for example , a regiment of 
Chinese girls playing "California, Here I Come" on glockenspiels.

the processions of Santa Rosalia and Madonna del Lume, which are 
more purely an expression of the Italian community. 
David Giannini, president of the Columbus Day Celebration 
Committee, is being interviewed by a radio reporter. I overhear 
him taking about the discovery as "a meeting of two worlds," and 
acknowledging that "many people suffered," but now, "we have to 
look to the future." The emphasis, he says quite rightly, is on 
the five million Italians who came to America in the last 100 
years. 
The Columbus float features a model Santa Maria. As it motors 
up Market Street, Joe Cervetto, Jr. raises his sword in 
greeting. Not that there are all that many people to greet. The 
crowd is thin until Chinatown. And when it crosses Broadway into 
North Beach the sense of festivity is heightened by the presence 
of all the tables on the street and sidewalk from the Italian caffes 
along Columbus Ave. The people eating at the tables applaud. It 
happens to be Fleet Week. Sailors in dress blues, beers in hand, 
stand outside the bars, watching the parade go by. People are 
listening to the Clarence and Anita show on Walkmans and portable 
radios. 
A reviewing stand has been set up across the street from SS 
Peter and Paul. Al Baccari and Eve Sodo are the MCs. Each of the 
dignitaries dismounts at the reviewing stand and climbs up and 
takes a seat. A group of guys in sunglasses sitting behind a 
police barricade with a sign "Official Judges from the Finer 
Italian-American Traditions Committee, Local 666 Caligula" draped 
over it, hold up cards numbered 1-10 as each entry passes them. 
The church is decorated with triangular red, white and green used 
car lot flags. Queen Isabella spots a friend in the crowd and 
calls out, "I have your curling iron." The Silesian Sisters are 
taking it all in from the second and third-storey windows of the 
house next door to the church. Inside the church parish hall 
basement is a bazaar: slot machines, raffles, bingo, coin tosses, 
baseball pitch, a dice game. A spaghetti dinner ($6 for adults, 
$3 for children and senior citizens) is being served by an all-
Chinese kitchen crew. Back outside, in the parking lot, umbrella 
tables are set up, arias are being sung, sausages are being 
grilled, and Chinese food, cake, beer, and wine ar served. 
There is only a small handful of protesters: "Columbus 
Traded Slavery and Death for Gold and Silver," "Christopher 
Columbus Was Way off Course, This Land Belongs to Crazy Horse," 
"Columbus is to Native-Americans What Hitler is to Jews." The 
Italians in the crowd counter with their T-shirts: "America. We 
discovered it. We named it. We built it." And, "So Italian. So 
Intense."

overjoyed . Almost immediately, Bay Area radio reporters start 
calling for his reaction. 
Shortly after we arrive, a fellow named Dave Pendretto comes 
calling . Pendretto is IBM's local community affairs guy and he is 
extremely interested in IAW, so he and Rene begin plotting 
strategy to get IBM involved in providing hardware and/or 
software for the exhibition . I, meanwhile , bide my time , noting 
down the details of Murphy's office decor . The office is in a 
house on a residential street in a middle class neighborhood --
an unlikely location , esepecially given Murphy's role as one of 
the prime movers and shakers in Santa Clara County and San Jose 
city politics . Murphy explains that he developed this subdivision 
and has kept the office going since the days when he was using it 
to sell houses or lots. 
One entire wall of the office is covered with certificates, 
diplomas , plaques and picture s o f Mur ph y w it h the Pope. Th ere is 
such Italiana 
as a miniature carreto and a Sicilian doll on one 
of the book shelves , a Tyrolea n ha t, It a li an an d Amer ican fl ags. 
It's also the only business office I've ever been in that 
includes teddy bears and dolls among its decor. 
Before we do the interview we go to lunch at the posh 
Capitol Club on top of the Fairmount Hotel in downtown San Jose. 
Everyone knows Murphy, of course (his name is on the plaque in the 
lobby ) and several people congratulate him on his good news from 
the Supreme Court . What 's delightful about all this is what an 
unpretentious guy he is, both in his manner and style of dress. 
He's a short , round guy (though less round than he used to be --
he's lost 50 pounds ), has a full head of tousled white hair and 
looks not at all like the sort who routinely rubs elbows with all 
the powerful people of Silicon Valley . After lunch we come back 
to his office and do an hour -long interview: 
Murphy was born in Lawrence, Mass . in 1920 -- "Lawrence was 
an Italian town in those days" -- but grew up in San Jose. His 
parents were Sicilian . He doesn 't know why they named him Murphy. 
"I spoke Italian before I spoke English ," he says. His father 
came from near Palermo, from farming people. He came via Ellis 
Island , had a brother already in the U.S. and went to work in one 
of Lawrence 's woolen mills before making the move west after 
being told that the Santa Clara Valley climate was similar to 
Sicily 's. Once out here he did farmwork until he was able to buy 
his own 32 -acre ranch in the 1930s, where he grew cherries and 
prunes. Murphy 's mother was 14 when she came over -- without her 
parents -- and landed in Providence. His mother and sisters 
worked in one of the San Jose 's eight canneries.

The family lived in North San Jose in "a solid Italian 
•1.10r'-t•ic. 
neighborhood -- like one big family." Most of the men worked on 
farms. Murphy, the second of 11 children, grew up selling papers and 
shining shoes. He gathered prunings from the vineyards to fire up 
the backyard forno. His mother baked bread twice a week: "Nothing 
better that pulling bread hot out of the oven." On Saturday 
mornings a flatbed truck came through on the unpaved streets with 
cages full of chickens. Everyone had a garden. As Murphy's father 
would say, "You cannot eat the lawn." There was wine in barrels, 
bootlegging during Prohibition; 
bonfires and sausage barbecues on 
St. Joseph's Day, baccala on Christmas. "I think the thing tha 
•o0V W OY-S 
probably keeps them (Italians) together is the food," Murphy 
(:;;Lucr-E 
says. 
The Italians who came in the 1920s were shrewd people, says 
Murphy. "Landlubbers. They had to own a piece of land. That's how 
they became wealthy." His father would say, in Italian, "Buy all  
the land you can see and a house only big enough to live in." His\ 
father insisted that the kids speak English at home, so he could 
learn himself. Murphy describes him as "a toughie. He didn't 
tolerate any foolishness." And he insisted that the kids work. 
Murphy started in the grocery business, switched to hardware 
before going into real estate. His involvement in community 
affairs began when his cousin, a priest in Italy, came to visit 20 
years ago and inspired him to raise money to build a trade school 
in Sicily. He then went on to raise money for earthquake relief 
in Italy, for Boystown there, and for the Boy Scouts. "When 
disaster strikes Italy," Murphy says, "I'm the first one to 
respond in this community ... I think Italians have good hearts. 
They're giving. When I have to raise funds I go to the Italians." 
According to a 1976 survey there were 350,000 Italian-Americans 
in the Santa Clara Valley. 
Before I leave he strongly suggests that we interview State 
Supreme Court Justice (and Santa Clara University alum and 
trustee) Ed Pinelli and Father Locatelli, the president of Santa 
Clara University. 
10/12/91A. James Boccardo, San Jose. Boccardo's office is on the 
top floor of Community Towers, a 12-storey building he built and 
owns in downtown San Jose. In contrast to Murphy Sabatino, he's 
an elegant, "continental-looking" guy in blue suit and paisley 
tie and trim little moustache, seated behind a vast desk in a 
vast office decorated with pictures of his family, himself, his 
Ferrari, a ship model, a bronze bust of his father, and with two 
all-window walls with panoramic views of the smoggy Indian summer 
South Bay skies. 
His gruff manner catches Rene Kortum and I off-guard. 
--"Nobody cares about the dagos of Gilroy" he says when Rene 
explains the project to him. He also wants to know "What's the 
racket?" -- in other words, how much money do we want out of him, 
and says flatly that he's done giving money to the legions who 
ask him for donations to this or that worthy cause. But after 
20 
FRANK/Fieldnotes 
this unpromising beginning he consents to give an interview. 
Boccaro's family story is an unusual one. His father, John 
Boccaro, came from a Genovese family "of some wealth." Much to 
his family's consternation, he shipped out as an able-bodied 
seaman on a four-masted schooner and sailed the world around 
until he got to San Francisco in 1900. He met A.P. Giannini just 
when he was starting the Bank of Italy, and became his first 
employee, opening branches in Gilroy, Merced and San Jose. 
The Italian immigrants of the Santa Clara Valley 
looked upon John Boccaro as the man to see for financial advice and 
assistance. The Bank of Italy was the only bank that would 
finance Italian farmers and small businessmen. When Boccaro 
opened his own bank -- the Community Bank of San Jose -- people 
came in with a deposit and a story about his father: how they 
needed $500 and got it from his father. "That $500 made me," one 
said. He describes Giannini as a big guy with a booming voice 
who complained to his father that he wasn't making enough bad 
loans -- a sign that he wasn't taking enough chances. Of his 
father he says, "he was the greatest man that ever lived." He 
spoke eight languages and spoke English perfectly when he came to 
this country. 
Boccaro's mother was also born in Genova, but that's an 
unusual story as well, because his grandmother was born in 
Mariposa during the Gold Rush, and moved back to Genova. Boccaro 
credits his mother with being able to "smell a good piece of 
land." She and his father would quarrel about whether it was 
better to put their money in real estate or stocks and bonds. 
Boccaro claims his mother's cooking "had no equal." He complains 
that Italian restaurants overdo the herbs. 
On the subject of Italian pride and heritage, Boccaro notes 
that his daughter and grandchildren use Boccaro as a middle name. 
He has a sign in his office, "Parking for Italians only. All 
others will be towed. City Ord. 1492." He notes that he is "full-
blooded, 100 percent Genovese. We think the Genovese are the 
superior Italians. They look down their nose at the Sicilians." 
He tells a vehement story about someone joking about his being in 
the Mafia. "You get that crap," he says. "If you got an Italian 
name you're a Mafia." 
James was born in San Francisco in 1911 and grew up in San 
Jose, where, unlike the Sabatino family, they lived in "un-
Italian neighborhoods." 
The family had 15 acres in Los Altos 
where as a teenager, James pruned the apricot trees, smoked and 
dried the fruit. He went to San Jose State University and Stanford 
Law School, graduating in 1934. In addition to his law practice 
(there's a framed copy of the Guinness Book of Records which 
lists the largest personal-injury award ever won -- won, of 
course, by James Boccaro) he's had a cattle ranch in in Nevada, a 
prune ranch in Marysville, restaurants, hotels.

As we take our leave, he makes two promises: to help out in 
any way he can, and to send family photos for us to copy.

10/11/91A. Meeting with Murphy Sabatino, Father Locatelli, Rene 
Kortum at Santa Clara University. Rene and I arrive early to have 
a look at the DeSaisset Museum . When we sit down in Father 
Locatelli's office, I'm struck anew at Murphy's position in the 
community. Father Locatelli twits us about not looking into the 
families of Santa Cruz County where, you guessed it, he 's from.

A Note on Borrowable Objects: 
For everything pertaining to Santa Rosalia, go through Jerome 
Lucido. Objects to consider are the (life-sized) statue herself 
(probably a longshot), the Sicilian cart (carreto) at the Monterey 
Maritime Museum (contact Donna Penwell), the model fishing boat 
that rides on one of the floats, and the banners. There are also 
photographs of processions past. Jerome's son has a sportswear 
shop here every kind of Italian-wear T-shirt and cap can be had. 
For Madonna del Lume, contact Frances Tarantino. The objects to 
consider are the painting of the Madonna and the banners. 
For Columbus Day, there are Joe Cervetto, Sr.'s various 
decorations and medals, his portrait of himself as Columbus, 
his rosettes from parades past and possibly, his and Isabella's 
costumes.
