READ THE 
JOURNALISTIC ENCOMIUMS 
OF 
Mr. John H. W. Byrne. 
John H. W. Byrne, the manipulator of varione inNtru-
ments and the possessor of a 
vast amount of dry humor, had 
a 
most cordial reception, and was never heard to better ad. 
vantage. — Boston Herald, May 21. 
The most entertaining part, however, was the perform-
ance of Byrne on a 
variety of instruments, giving general 
satisfaction to the audience.— .
2Vezo Bedford Mercury, April 
THE GREAT DIME SHOW. 
Ward, Wambold & Pierce's Dime Show appeared before 
a 
large audience in Liberty Hall last evening, and sustained 
the excellent reputation of this combination. 
Many changes 
have been made in the company since their last visit to this 
city, and the , entertainment is more attractive than ever. 
John H. W. Byrne and the wonderful ventriloquist Chalet, 
were welcomed by loud applause and provided much merri-
ment.—.New Bedford Gazette, April 12. 
HUMPTY DIIMPTY." 
The frolics of " Hnmpty Dumpty" delighted a 
large 
matinee audience at the Opera House yesterday afternoon, 
and at night there was a 
fair attendance 
The company is 
passing good, some et* the members being quite satisfactory. 
The old favorite, John H. W. Byrne. received a 
fine greeting 
when he put in an appearance in his very amusing specialty 
Mr. Byrne, it will be remembered, was of the team of Smith 
and Byrne, who appeared at the Apollo some years ago, and. 
made a 
fine impression.—Evarmille Courier, Dec. 27.

JOURNALISTIC ENCOMIUMS. 
CONTDFUED. 
Mr. Byrne excelled himself last night and his efforts 
were duly appreciated - -Evansville Courier, May 8. 
Fay & Byrne were extremely funny.—Evansville _
Mer-
cury, Aug 12, 1880. 
The company consists of John H. W. Byrne, a 
droll 
comedian who plays it negro cook in an irrestible manner, 
and displayed his proficiency as a musician by executing 
solos on a 
dozen different musical instruments. 
His renvirk 
at the finish of each solo, " Got another one outside," being 
the signal 
of uproarious 
laughter.—Haverbill 
Gazette, 
April 10. 
The part of Spooks, a 
negro servant, played by John H. 
W Byrne, at Tony Pastor's 14th Street Theatre in the " Two 
Medallions" is very droll and created much sport. 
Mr. 
Byrne is an exceedingly clever comedian and a 
wonder at a 
musician 
His efforts are always enthusiastically applauded 
—.N. Y.News„June 29. 
John II, W. Byrne is 21 first-class straight man, witty, 
aud a 
hard worker. 
Really outside of his musical specialty, 
it is the best thing we have seen him in (The Modern School 
of Acting.) 
Boston, Globe, June 12. 
We are sorry to see that this will be the list week of Mr 
John H. W. Byrne, who by his modest and gentlemanly 
manlier has made a 
host of friends who will reoret his de-
parture. —Detroit Free Press, Sept 18. 
John H. W. Byrne, who has been a member of the 
Apollo company so long, leaves to-morrow for Detroit.—

JOURNALISTIC ENCOMIUMS. 
• 
CONTINUED. 
Although the company at the Apollo last week was 
strong in specialties there was a 
lack of' versatile talent and 
the bill was tiresome. 
Uniting the stock system of last sea-
son, the sketches and farces were always sufficient to redeem 
poor specialties 
it is rarely the case that a 
good specialist 
is a 
good general performer, and when the company meet 
on level ground this weakness is very ayparent. 
Hugh Fay 
and John H. W. Byrne, are both strong, and both are great 
favorites; b . t 
the show is entirely too heavy for two persons 
o 
carry.—Evansville Courier, July 23d, 1880. 
John H. W. Byrne in his new specialty, the " Pedant," 
introduced new gags and jokes, strange as it may seem, and 
his song, • Handsome Hannah Bacon," is destined to be as 
popular as anything ever heard in " Pina-fore."---Boston 
Globe, July 9th. 
John H. W. Byrne and — did a 
series of magical feats 
convulsed the house.- Detroit Free Press. 
Byrne and  
gave a 
parody of the " Great Prestidi-
gitateue here; it was a 
splendid piece of acting and deserved 
th ,- 
hearty applause with which it was received.— Buffalo 
Courier, Jan. 10th. 
John. H. W. Byrne of the musical team of Smith and; 
Byrne is intensely funny in everything he does and keeps t 
the audience in. a 
roar of laughter.A/bany Argus, Sept. 12. 
The novel sketch of Hugh Fay and John H. W. Byrne 
was the suc,cess of the evening. 
Both artists are witty and 
original and kept the audience in a 
roar 
Byrne sang his 
new song " My Grandfather's Hen." with telling effect.— 
Evansvillz Courier, Aug 12. 
Mr. Byrne in his musical specialties was simply Eli-
mense, and it will repay 
f 
r 
outlay of time and 
money to see

Waiting For John. • , 
Sweetheart's and Lovers. 
By John H. W. Byrne, for Mr. John C. Hall. 
Written and Sung by John H. W. Lyme. 
You stare at me and my queer clothes, 
I 
look very queer from head to toes; 
My second handed pants, and second handed vest, 
And second handed shoes you see I'm drest, 
They look very bad, but they are my best. 
Now all the clothes that I 
have got on, 
Were given to me by my sister John, 
No John she is a 
sister of mine, 
She's young in years, she's just turned nine, 
So now you know the business I 
am on, 
I 
just dropped in and I'm waiting for John. 
DUO% 
soLo FOR BELLA. 
You ask me to love you as once I 
did, 
When I 
was a 
maid pure and simple, 
You suid into your heart I 
had slid, 
You kissed my cheek and its dimple. 
You were handsome and brave, and I 
was your slave, 
And you called me your Bella Mahoffe, 
But our Italian ( ook Biddy, told me I 
was giddy, 
And that you were giving we t. ,try. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, you were giving me toffy, 
'Twits delicious and sweet, 
My joy was complete, 
So let you continue your toffy. 
SOLO FOR DEMA1Y. 
Hearts that weary with suffering, 
Brows that are furrowed with care, 
Joys that our woes once did lighten 
Gone but we know not where. 
Gone to a 
land that is brighter, 
Gone, and all sorrows are past, 
Gone where heart are made lighter, 
Gone, and they've found rest at last. 
iCHORUS. 
Gone to a 
land that is brighter, 
Gone, and all sorrows are past, 
Gone where the souls are made whiter, 
Gone, and they've found rest at last,

Its joys and its treasures, 
All would I 
give if you'd love me. 
(Th be repeated etz duo)

just when you thought yo had won me ? 
Trouble and sorrow I'd constantly borrow, 
All would I 
do if you'd spurn me.

was only joking, 
When those cruel words I

To drive me out of my head, 
SHE 
Now don't you take on about it 
In such a 
silly way, 
My love don't ever doubt it, 
No matter what I 
say; 
With you I 
was only in jest, 
That's sufficient, now I've confe.ised, 
I'll love you through life and be a 
good wife, 
I've finished, now you say the rest. 
(Repeat last two lines as cluett.) 
God Pity the Poor. 
By John II. W. Byrne, 
The wild rushing wings of the tempest are sweeping, 
The frost-fettered land like a 
spirit of wrath; 
His fierce, icy breath iNith keen arrows is piercing, 
The breasts cf the wand'rers who stand in his path. 
The earth in a 
trance lies enshrouded and silent, 
The storm- king knocks loudly t 
window and door, 
The prayer of the pitiful fervently rises— 
God shelter the homeless and pity the poor. 
God pity the poor who are wearily sitting 
By desolate hearth-stones, cold, cheerless and bare, 
From which the last ember's pale flicker has faded, 
Like hope dying out in the ' midst of despair. 
Who ook on the wide world and see it a 
desert, 
Where ripple no waters, no green branches wave, 
Who see in the future as dark as the present 
No rest but the death bed, no home but the grave. 
God pity the poor when the eddying snow drifts, - 
Are whirled by the wrath of the winter winds by, 
Like showers of leaves from the pallid star lilies, 
That float in the depths of the blue lake on high. 
For though they are draping the broad earth in beauty, 
And veiling some flaw in each gossamer fold. 
That beauty is naught to the mother whose children 
Are crouching around her in hunger and cold, 
9 
10 
GOD PITY THE POOR. 
CONTINUED. 
God pity the poor, for the wealthy are often 
As hard as the winter, and cold as its snow; 
While fortune makes sunshine Aid summer around them 
They care not for others nor think of their woe. 
Or if from their plenty a 
trifle be given, 
So doubt'ngly, grudging y, often ' tis doled, 
That to the receiver their " charity" seemeth 
More painful than hunger, more bitter than cold. 
God pity the poor, for though all men are brothers, 
Though all say " Our Father," not mine, when they pray 
The proud ones of the earth turn aside from the lowly, 
As if they were fashioned of different clay. 
They see not those who in meeknees and patience 
Toil, poverty, pain, without murmur endure, 
The image of Him whose first couch was a_manger, 
Who chose for our sake to be homeless and poor. 
God pity the poor, give them courage and patience, 
rheir trials, temptations and troubles to brave, 
And pity the wealthy whose idol is fortune, 
For gold cannot gladden the gloom of the grave. 
And as this brief life, whether painful or pleasant, 
To one that is endless but opens the door, 
The heart sighs while thinking on palace end hovel, 
God pity the wealthy as well as the poor. 
Why Should we Meet ? 
TO LEONA. 
Originally sung by the Nonpariel Colored Troubadors. 
Words and Music by John II. W. Byrne, 
Why should we meet 
To be se cruelly severed. 
Just as we have learned 
To love each other well ? 
Why should we meet 
To part perhaps forever, 
Just as we learned 
Love's sweetest tales to tell ? 
Cnoans. 
Good-bye, good-bye! 
Fot I 
must go and leave thee, 
For I 
am going way, 
Good-bye, good-bye, 
I'll not forget to love thee, 
So my darling one 
Good-by, good-by. good-by 
Why 
should we love, 
When so soon we will be parted, 
And our ways divide 
And never meet again. 
Good-by, my own true love, 
I 
leave you broken hearted, 
But the time well bide, 
For we may meet again. 
Why should we grieve. 
For sorrow can't last always, 
Happy days way come 
To make us glad once more. 
Although in grief I 
leave, 
My love is with you always, 
Although my heart may bLeak, 
I'll love you all the more.

Daddy's Only Pair of Pants. 
written and Sung by John H W. Byrne in his original Sketch 
The'PeLlant." 
Air 
The Old.Arm Chair. 
When T 
was but a 
boy, 
It was my greatest joy, 
To cut up all kinds of boyish pranhs, 
For which ma would get mad, 
And go aud tell my dad, 
For which I 
never gave her any thanks. 
He wou d 
then take down his whip, 
And my clothes he'd make me strip. 
And around the floor with pain he'd make me pcance, 
And often have I 
prayed, 
As upon the ' floor I 
laid, 
That I 
owned a 
pair of good sheet-iren pants. 
CHORUS. 
How he'd trounce me, how he'd kick, 
And used to thrash me with a 
hickory stick, 
Often have I 
heard the old man declare, 
He would make this infant climb the golden stair. 
Since then my time has come, 
For the old man he's a 
bum, 
He hangs around the beer shops all the•day, 
He gets chuck full of booze, 
And on the floor he'll snooze, 
For his board and washing he does never pay. 
He gets plum full of gin, 
And gives poor mother chin 
When I'm away. for that's his only chance, 
But on him I 
have got square. 
Ho now occupies the old arm chair, 
For I've took and pawned his only pair of pants. 
Chorus. 
Charming Mollie Mull igan, 
Words by John H. W, Byrne, 
Music Iv Max aorta% 
Oh ! charming Mollie Mulligan, 
Your dark eye's tender charm, 
Have stirred my soul to mutiny, 
And wrought a 
dead:y harm. 
The coral reefs your luring lips, 
Have wrecked my life boat fair, 
Stretch out your snowy armu to me 
And rescue from despair. 
I 
heard the music of a 
bird 
Beyond the hedge of thorns, 
And lo ! a 
rose had found a 
voice, 
'Twas Mollie in the corn; 
She tossed a 
dewy spray to me, 
She smiled so frank and true, 
That glance and smile were shafts to pierok 
My poor heart through and through. 
Cnons. 
My darling Mollie Milligan. 
Beneath the stars of June' 
Your perfumed lips in soft eclipse 
Set all my life atnne. 
I 
love you as I 
ne'er have loved. 
You're the,bright star of my life, 
My happiness will be supreme 
When I 
call you my mife 
Her hair was like the burnished breasts 
Of birds from southern lands, 
Her brow the home of gracious thought' 
Her hair and dimpl d 
hands. 
Had motion like white doves that flit 
Between the earth a. ,.d sky. 
She wove for me the posy of love 
Too sweet to die. 
The silken lashes kiss her cheek, 
Might I 
that freedom take, 
long all worthy to dare 
And do for her dear sake. 
Though wit and soul with beauty's = rift 
Have made her so divine, 
.Yet all in vain her winsomeness, 
If never to be mine.

Handsome Hannah Bacon. 
Words by John H. W, Byrne, 
Music bi Max Barter. 
The maiden I 
loved she was handsome, 
Indeed he was y u 
can bet; 
She had cross-eyed Irtir and red headed ears, 
A 
complexion like a 
yaller clarionet, 
1 
loved her with Samsoniau fervency. 
But soon discovers I 
was ifistaken. 
For she was cruel, diabolical, heartless, 
Miserable, insignificant, heart-breaking, 
Piece of o_int-euting trouble-brewing, 
Face sera ching. hair pulling piece of calico, 
My handsome Hannah Bacon. 
CHOU B. 
Oh 1 
Thnnah Bacon, my heart you are breakin', 
My love you have taken, and me you have shaken, 
1 
feel so forsaken, I 
was sadly mistaken. 
My poor heart is breaking for you Hannah Bacon. 
I 
remember meeting her one summer's morning, 
I 
was delivering a 
ton of coal, 
Love in.nly mind was dawning, 
As she hove on me a 
smole. 
And a 
pan of ashes at the vet y 
same time, 
I 
thought my neck was broken. 
But it was merely a 
girlish, guileless guying, 
Flirting, coquettish, neck-breaking, 
spineal column dislocating, neck-tie destroying. 
Coat spoiling, destructive way 
Handsome Hannah Bacon 
kORIIS. 
Oh! Hannah Ba-on my heart you have broken, 
With me you were yokin' y

With beer I'll be chokin, with gin I'll be soakin,

13yrneings. 
By John H. W. Byrne, 
When the variety actor shows his wits it breaks the 
heart of the poor " Legit." 
Men are dreamers. and women are schemeas. 
Kind words can never die, 
Although they ere often 
'wasted on perveted minds. 
Love is a suspension between heaven and H-1, 
hades. as long as the suspender holds you are all right 
but when it breaks order ice Und keep cool. 
We must all commence at the bottom of the ladder to 
carry the hod. 
Some musicians are like inspiration, they drive me 
crazy. 
All men are not fools because you know them. 
Nor 
are they honest by knowing you 
Guitean was not crazy, merely an illy-ballanced men-
tal monstrosity, cotui minded of badly arranged intel-
lectual fires, feeble moral faculties, and enormous self-
conceit. 
Some folks say I 
am in the same box.

Baby Brown: 
Words by John H. wr, Byrne, 
music b,/ max Horter. 
There's a 
charming little fellow, 
Wears kid gloves and necktie yellow, 
And calico he does sell, oh, 
In a 
dry-goods store up town, 
He walks just like 
lady, 
The boys they call him Sadie, 
He tells we call him Baby, 
His name is Harry Brown. 
Cnonus. 
Really, gracious me ! 
How deligntful, ho 
ho! he! 
Were you speaking then to me? 
Now you stop. 
You've insulted me now twice, 
You re too fresh, go lay on ice, 
You think you're awful nice, 
But you are not. 
He's got a 
chum name Mandy. 
They dress both loud and gaudy, 
You should hear them say " Oh, Lawdy !" 
When the gang do at them yell. 
He's so delicate and dainty, 
And his cheeks they say does paint he, 
. 
He's very sweet, now ain't he, 
And of perfume he does smell. 
Through the week he's let off one day, 
He' always out on Sunday, 
But he has to labor Monday, 
Cleaning up the store. 
By trade a 
calico-tearer, 
Also a 
change-bearer, 
But the gang s

he's a 
Sarah, 
And at him they do roar. 
Chorus. 
Chorus. 
Only a 
Man. 
Written for and sung by Tom Sayers. 
Words and Music By John H. W. Byrne. 
Have you ever observed as each day goes by, 
The girls that you meet are remarkably shy, 
In fact very bashful, I 
sometimes think it rude 
To say " Ah, good-day," for fear I'd intrude. 
It's not modesty at all, as I've lately found out, 
It's a 
way that they have with a 
smile and a 
pout; 
They use all the wiles and arts that they can, 
They're breaking their hearts to catch on to a 
man. 
• CHORUS,. 
Theve's Sarah, none fairer. 
Atid Cera and -Dora, 
sweet Angelina thick-lipped Miss Dinah, and the 
magnificent Bidalia McCann, 
The nurses and cooks 
All wear their good looks 
For they all want to catch on a.man. 
They all fall in love because they think it's nice, 
Contrary to papa and mamma's advice, 
The streets and the alleyways closely they scan. 
They are all broke up at the sight of a 
man. 
It's men, wicked man, drives girls out of their mind, 
In the most worthless creatures a 
hero they'll find; 
They make no distinction, it's catch-as.catch-can. 
They don't care a 
snap if it's only a 
man

The Boarding House Party. 
Words and Music. by John H W. Byrne, 
Up in the house where I 
now live. 
A party once a 
month they give. 
The boys all bring their steady girl, 
To dance around in the mazy whirl. 
The orchestra they have it isn't large, 
They play all summer on a 
p 
c-nic barge. 
The price they ask is small I 
think, 
A 
dollar and a 
half and the beer they drink. 
CHORUS.. 
There is three of them and how they play, 
'Tie enough to scare the rats away; 
hands all round your partner take, 
You bet the girl that took the cake, 
Was Murphy s 
girl the Dutchtown belle, 
The gang all call her big-mouthed Nell. 
Dance. 
The dances are such grand affairs, 
Some sit on the floor when they can't get chairs, 
They g out in the kitchen and sit on the stove, 
And from it ( with a 
club) they can't be drove. 
'Till the fiddler he starts up a 
quadrille, 
And then they into the parlor fill, 
The noise, when dancing, that is made. 
Is worse ttian a 
German Masquerade. 
CHoittTs. 
You should see them how they skip 
Through the " Society " or the Boston dip, 
Forward four and alle-monde 
Just give that German girl your hand, 
Just as graceful as she can be,

In the Long Ago. 
By John 11. W. Byrne, 
On the soft green banks of a 
lakelet still, 
Where the mirage comes and goes at will, 
Where the scented air breathes soft and low, 
On the lily's leaves that break and blow, 
In the cooling shade of an .old oak tree, 
Awake I 
lay and dretim of thee. 
Yes, dream of thee, and thy fair young face, 
Of thy ringing laugh and modest grace, 
Of thy rosebud lips and thy deep blue eyes, 
In whose tender depths the love-light lies. 
Or lingers yet in a 
liquid glow, 
Like the dying shade of an afterglow, 
And I 
often long for your touch once more, 
And the good-night kiss at the half-drawn door, 
And the whispered words so low and dear, 
That like music fell on my ravished ear; 
Oh ! those were the days when hope and 1 
ve, 
Gleamed like the light from the star above, 
But DOW has the world grown bleak and small, 
And vainly for thee I 
cry and call; 
And the answer I 
get, ah, me! ale me! 
As the dreary moan of the restless sea; 
Or the sobbing voice of the little lake, 
Whose wavelets over the cold stones break. 
And so I 
know that never again 
Will I 
find sweet rest from this fierce heart-pain; 
For, we've parted, love, and our lips no more 
Will meet in bliss at the half drawn door; 
And never again %% ill your soul arise 
In the radient light of your starry eyes. 
Aye, we're parted, love, and our weary feet, 
Will tread no more those paths so swee7, 
T at in other days when yon were mine, 
Were all ablaze with a 
love divine; 
But now not even a 
branch is seen, 
For the wide, wide world comes in between.

Sweet Eudora Dare. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and Music By John H W. Byrne, 
To thee, my best friends, I 
greet in bovho 4.1 
and manhood 
Atr. and Mr q G. NA,. Kemp. Baltimore, Md. 
Where the flowers bloom, 
And their sweet perfume, 
With fragrance fills the air, 
And the roses bright, 
And the lilies 
Makes earth sweet and fair, 
And the violets blue, 
Bathed in morning dew 
Song-birds linger there, 
But the fairest flower, 
In all that garden bower ' 
Is my sweet Eudora Dare. 
Silver bells, silver bells, 
How they float on the air, 
Bringing joy everywhere, 
To each one, every one, 
Beautiful sweet silver bells.

The F. F. V'S. 
Written for, and sung by Mason & Wesley. 
Words and Music By John H. W. Byrne. 
Please gaze upon our forms just now, 
Perhaps you'll recognize 
Two chaps that have come to the place, 
And just about our size, 
We are two colored gentlemen, 
With style quite superfine, 
We are strangers in the western land, 
We belong in South Ca'line. 
CHORUS. 
We are colored gentlemen, (Break.) 
We belong to the upper ten, (Break.) 
We belong to one of the F F. V's 
Of the Pocahontas line, 
But lately we have our homa 
in sunny South Ca'line. 
Our father he's a 
senator 
Down at Washington, 
He thinks that we're at Harvard, 
But away from there we run. 
They jeer us and they snub us 
On account of the color line, 
So we're going in the whitewash business 
Down at sunny South Ca'line.

Three Little Words. 
BABY IS DEAD,," 
By Jolla H. W. Byrne, 
"Baby is dead." One home is enveloped in gloom and 
sorrow, all is silence, save now and then a sob of a 
grief-
stricken mother, 
or the sigh that forces itself up from the 
heart of a 
strong man. 
Somewhere, a 
dainty form, still and cold, unclasped by 
the mother's arms to-night; eyes that yesterday were bright 
and blue as skies of June, drooped to-night beneath white 
4lid s 
that no voice can ever raise ag in. 
To soft hands whose restless lingers were wont to wan-
der lovingly around mother's neck and face, loosely holding 
white buds quietly folded in unfinished rest. 
Soft lips, yesterday rippling with laughter, sweet as 
woodland brook-falls, gay as trill of forest birds; to-night 
unresp nsive to kiss or call of ove. 
A dlent home -- the patter of the baby feet forever 
hushed, a 
cradle bed u ! pressed, little shoes half worn, 
dainty garments, shoulder knots of blue to match those 
eyes of yerterday, folded with aching heart away, 
A 
tiny mound snow-covered in some quiet grave yard. 
A 
mother's groping touch in uneasy slu ober for the. 
fair head that shall never rest again upon her bosom. 
The 
low sob, the bitter tear of broken dreams awake to sad re-
ality. 
The hope of future years wrecked, like fair ships 
that suddenly g,) down in sight of land. 
The watching of other babies, dimpled, laughing, strong 
and their own one gone 
The pr s. ft agony of grief, the 
future emptiness of heart all held in those three little words 
"Baby is dead"

Last WetInPsday I 
attended 
A raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Hogans, and O'Brien', 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play. 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Toni Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Choru8.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly be got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
home, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

One I

Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the Bowery she owns a 
store, 
She has " Milliner " on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene;" 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly tceads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

In the summer time when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green, 
When the boys arc drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene. 
On Tom McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might, 
They have a 
big accord eon, the music it is grand. 
You'll hear them shout for miles away, 
Faith they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy 
on his instruments will play. 
Ctiou Ts. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all night, 'tis finer 
than the op'ra bouffe; 
If you don't believe I'm right, call around there any night, 
And you'll find us on McDonnell's old tin roof! 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They said it was too soon. 
They keep the folks awake at night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their -level best. 
The music it is charming, it really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the opera, when they do the Boston dip, 
Faith the house rocks like a 
ship; 
Oh I 
there's no place like McDonnell's old tin roof, 
Across the street from where I 
live, a 
German keeps a 
store, 
lie's a 
baker man by trade, he's worth a 
thousand or more. 
He keeps about five men at work of course they're up all night 
But when they hear the music play they shout with delight, 
About the time the bread is bak'd the boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door then they'll 
skip across the stree-
:;, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
OltI you ought to hear the bakers how they roar,

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Cnonua: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants.

One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang. all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Bowld your tongues " then said he to the loafe; 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I

You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when I'm gone.

In the tented field of honor 
We hold our lives but small, 
And bravely clan 'together 
At the bugle's martial call. 
We greet the shouts of victory 
With cheers and saddened smile, 
And sigh for slaughtered comrades 
Who belonged to the Rank and File.

I'm the best known man on Broadway. 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I

With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can Awim like Captain Boynton,

Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I

The ladies admire my pretty shape 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me leer, 
N'or my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be s-ire to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride. 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor.

Always in fashion this swell of the day-. 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style,

Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face.

You appear to be very suspicious; 
I 
cannot walk out by myself half a

Or dine with a

But a

smile, 
You've grown so excessively jealous.

You go out with the boys, Sir! 
You go out with the boys, 
Drinking champagne all the night, 
And kicking up a

You go out with the boys, Sir, 
You go out with the boys! 
Instead of being home with me, 
You go out with the boys!

There is no place like the dear old home.

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANK Lewis. 
How the world has wrote the 'liaises of our politicans of fame, Sir— 
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those who get no thanks Sir; 
The tic.e of vi.story oft been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classee. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think itivould be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man, and feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for w ne, big suppers and fine 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our hcnest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for-
1.) ,n, Sir, 
They meet the ignorant snob's contempt, the haughty rich man's 
scorn Sir; 
But some may go to Congress, and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of our honest working classes. 
Now, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And wh ,-) 
will not be off,nde 
at any insinuations ; 
Ehere are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold or 
clink of glasses, 
ihut have nobly risen, step by step, from our honest working cliwees

HIT HIM AGAIN, HE'S GOT NO FRIENDS. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The ups and downs of this great world, 
Would fill a 
mighty book, 
But those in luxury pass by, 
And seldom chance to look 
On those whom fortune has not blest, 
With friendship's pitying eye, 
But hear his story with a,shrug, 
And coldly pass him by (with)— 
CHORUS. 
Hit him again, he's got no friends, 
Drive him away from the door; 
Hit him again, he's got. no friends, 
What good is a 
man when he's poor? 
A man of wealth may be a 
lion, 
in party, club or ball, 
Courted by men 'of high degree, 
By ladies great and small; 
But speculations fickle hand, 
May sweep away his gold, 
What then do men of high degree, 
What will the ladies say ? (why)— 
Hit him again, etc. 
But then the road is very long, 
That turns not in its way, 
For tides will rise, the cat will mew, 
The dog will have his day; 
The rich man now may then be poor, 
The poor man have his place, 
And he who snubs to- day may look 
Into the other's face (and say).— 
Hit him ag-ain, etc.

But we have Moody and Sankey,. who set weak people cranky,

We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom I 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's:Teat Hero. 
He strove for his countrj bright laurels to win. 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our g 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have galant Little Mae, who at Antietam fighting,

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn 
have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now fur the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch foi th his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our 
hearts 
ever 
dear, 
_ 
And 
sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in -Washington some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in its day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this -
city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget.

The stage it has lik ew i
se produced some good 
names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll reniain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a

The way we love, like turtle doves

Of the lakes of sweet Killarney.

And has its breoks and lakes, 
A man might live in royal state, 
Be fed on ducks and drakes; 
But here we'll be content, 
As long as we have our rent, 
And stay at home, and never roam 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
Killarney, ets. 
The little spec that's on the sea, 
They call it Ireland,

Rule every mile in that happy isle, 
Where flows the sweet Killarney.

WHOA, EMMA! 
As originally sung with tremendous success throughout the 
United States by the Duncan Sisters, 
CARRIE .
kND SOPHIE. 
My beau took me, one day, sailing down the bay. 
He called me his clear Emma. 
That's my name. 
While standing on the pier some chaps began to stare, 
And one and all around us did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! 
Emma, you put me in such a 
dilemma! 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, when some one at us sent 
An egg, which struck my beau right in the eye! 
then began to scream, " Oh, Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! etc. 
i 
thought they'd never cease. 
We shouted out police! 
And when he came he looked at us so sly; 
He said " Don't be put out—it's only a 
saying that's got 
about," 
And then their voices seeined to rend the sky. 
SPOKEN. — You see, this is the latest New York byword, 
" 
Oh, Emma!" and we didn't know that. 
So they all 
commenced together again, including the policeman—

found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I

United on one stern, 
On Irish Soil are often seen— 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leat is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love, 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dewdrops from above. 
CHORUS: 
Ohl the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By every nook and every brook 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so grees 
When Irish soil received the plant 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there. 
And liked the soil so well. 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretensions 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell.

Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me; 
She took my cash, for I was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; (Sym.) 
And she knew me! (Sym.) 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel I ( Sym.) 
She surprised me! (Sym.) 
She paralyzed me 1 
(

And she played me for a 
gilly all the while.

CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work. 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
handcart! (Sym.) 
With her head stuck in an ash barrel— 
(Sym. 
She's a 
daisy I (Sym.

She's terrible lazy! (Sym.

Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea ; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again.

Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it Cu his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts wzre both so free, 
When he pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, Ice. 
Let him think how once he falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sign;

We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
i 
laying martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh ! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar. 
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh ! don't their hearts, go pit-a- pat, 
As melt one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emeeald Hall, and an illegant suppet 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for 
you, 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brant. 
gans band; 
Ohl it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal,

With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's band.

American Fortune-Telling Carcil,— This is the old-
est and most widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q, for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under. 
standing. Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting- Cards.— This Series of Cards has been . arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too ditii• 
den; --u.sloo fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qffestfon. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not bt 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of thee Cards is not restricted to two players, 
hut may be enjoyed by evening parties.
