JOHNNY ROACH'S (CENTENNIAL) " COME- AND JOIN THE BAND" 
SONGSTER. 
A CARD TO THE PUBLIC . 
AFTER a 
careful examination of the song books prepared 
and published by almost all other vocalists, I 
notice that the 
custom prevails of filling them in great part with songs sung 
almost exclusively by themselves. 
Consequently they are 
forced to omit the bulk of the most meritorious ones. As I 
know 
that this little work will find its way to nearly every spot where 
our language is read or sung, I 
have filled it with a 
great vari-
ety of the best songs obtainable; knowing that however great 
may be the fame of any one professional in a 
certain locality, 
he or she may never be heard in ten thousand other places. 
Thus it, will be found that I 
have given all the very best songs 
that are sung by all the very best singers everywhere. 
I 
have 
been unswayed by either partiality or prejudice. 
My motto 
has been " The best songs and nothing but the best." 
Con-
scious that this little work is superior in the general excellence 
of its songs to any book published, I 
send it afloat on the sea 
of popularity, amid its many competitors, leaving to an appre-
ciative and generous public a 
decision upon its merits; thank-
ing them at the same time for the liberal patronage that they 
have always bestowed upon all the previous productions that 
have borne on their title pages the name of 
The Public's most grateful servant, 
JOHNNY ROACH.

I'VE ONLY BEEN DOWN TO THE CLUB.

York.

HARDING. 
LIST night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be ; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears, 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the ball, 
Arid softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to assure 
her once more, as a 
positive fact, that— 
The " Club" had, etc.

COME AND JOIN THE BAND. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
Sung by JOHNNY Roam. 
The Music of this song is published by E. II. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents.

COME, come and be converted, 
Come from wickedness and sin ; 
Let the devil be deserted, 
Come and join the band within; 
hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay; 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band. 
CHORUS. 
Come, come, every Yankee, 
Every sinner thro' the land; 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey, 
Come, come, and join the band. 
Now the glory flows around us, 
Angels blow their bugles loud; 
Sinners bless the day they found us, 
See them creeping through the crowd; 
All the world we've come to heal— 
Into every breast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, etc. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back, with glory crown'd; 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Such a 
wicked lot we found; 
From the aged and the wise, 
Sever'd from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, etc.

THE CENTENNIAL. 
By JOHNSON and BRUNO. 
IT'S now a 
hundred years ago 
Since freedom first did dawn, 
And many a 
thought comes o'er us 
As we hail the coming morn ; 
So we'll make bold, the scenes unfold, 
The changes from that day, 
The battles won, the great things done, 
Since freedom gained the day. 
We'll tell you first of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe 
Who wished to tax the people 
That the tea did overthrow; 
He nobly tried, and bravely died, 
He well the battle won, 
And Washington the finish gave 
To what he'd left undone. 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy- Six! 
One hundred years since we did the tyrants fix! 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy- Six! (Repeat.) 
Then Jackson, with his cotton bales, 
He made the red- coats fly 
Our banner, still triumphant, 
The invaders did defy ; 
And Lawrence fought, the lesson taught, 
Not to give up the ship; 
And Winfield Scott the foe he caught, 
As in the days of Seventy- Six.

I 
went to a 
tailor for clothing— 
Of highest esteem by the Park— 
Who took my advance without loathing, 
And pledged I 
should surpass the mark. 
The togs they were lengthy in coming, 
And, anxious, I 
sought for his door— 
The shutters were up and a-drumming 
On them were his duns some three-score! 
SPOKEN :—It 2:3 not often you hear of a 
tailor being tormented 
with duns, but this man had done any quantity of noodles be-
sides me. 
There was an old Scotch man in the mob, a' t
. wee frae 
Glasgie, and he heard my tale street out, an' he says; kiddie

There ne*er was a

Of which she missed often the lift.

All dipped pretty deep in my purse—

I 
married the girl for her beauty. 
A 
girl with no coin for her cheek, 
And thought she would e'er do her duty, 
Be tender and faithful, and meek 
I 
settled upon her much money, 
And trustingly for her whole use: 
She eloped with a

With not even ten words of excuse !

OUR BOYS ."

POND Sz. CO

way, New York, 
Price 40 cents. 
UNCLE SAM he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they call'd upon Sam for a 
strain; 
So he put out his weed and he toss'd off his glass, 
And then be commenc'd this refrain ; 
I'll sing of " our boys," who have made a 
great name, 
There's Captain Borgardus, said he; 
In Europe he show'd them how well he could shoot, 
his equal we seldom shall see. 
CHORUS. 
He's one of" our boys," he is! 
We're proud of " our boys," we are; 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
lie's one of " our boys," hurrah! 
We've got a 
very good rifle team, 
They crossed the wide ocean you know; 
They defeated the Dollymount marksmen with ease, 
And brought off the prizes I 
vow ; 
They've defeated since then the Canadian Cent, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They are open to meet any marksmen on earth, 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to " our boys," they do; 
We are proud of such boys, we are ! 
They're honest and true, so we give them their due, 
They belong to " our boys," hurrah! 
When old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair; 
It was one of " our boys," Jim Bennet, who said, 
" 
For the Doctor I'll now have a 
care." 
It was one of " our boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went, out and Livingstone found ; 
All honor to Stanley, may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
CHORUS. 
He's one of " our boys," he is, 
We are proud of such boys, we are! 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
lie's one of " our boys," hurrah !

" 
OUR BOYS."—Concluded. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame 
Is one we shall never forget, 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished J. Bull, you may bet ;-
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring whil'st we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty great man. 
CHORUS. 
He was chief of " our boys," he was, 
We are proud of such boys, we are 
lie was honest and true, so we give him his due, 
lie was chief of " our boys," hurrah!

La. 
Price 35 cents. 
THE gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now; 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty ' round her brow; 
Oh, tender are the mem'ries 
That wake from out the past; 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful, too beautiful to last, oh! 
CHORUS. 
The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now ; 
Again I 
see them cluster 
In beauty, in beauty 'round her brow. 
Once more I 
kneel at twilight, 
In childhood's simple, earliest pray'r; 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all, and all the blessings there; 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
Is nearer heav'n, is nearer heav'n for thee, oh! 
The gray hairs, etc.

NO IRISH NEED APPLY. 
(New Version.) 
As sting by COTTON and ThanrE. 
IN 
the papers have you read, 
Have you noticed what they said, 
That no Irish people need apply 
To earn their daily bread 1 
'Twill plainly show to you 
The course you should pursue; 
And in honesty I'll show you 
What you really ought to do. 
CHOIZUS . 
On this you may rely; 
You will find out by-and-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny Isle 
Are welcome to apply. 
Just note the Irish girl, 
As she's skipping to the well 
With blossoms blooming on her cheeks 
Like roses in the dell; 
She is so bright and fair, 
With her jet-black eyes and hair— 
Show me your English lady, 
Who a 
brighter name can bear! 
CHORUS . 
Never let me hear that cry, 
As I 
heard in days gone by; 
(1) 
NO IRISH NEED APPLY.— Concluded. 
That cruel, cold, unpleasing one— 
No Irish need apply! 
On the plains of Waterloo, 
Where the bullets like hailstones flew, 
There was the Duke of Wellington, 
Bad luck to him! what did he do ? 
He beat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the Irish won their part. 
CHORUS . 
Faugh-a-ballah! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-and-by. (Repeat.) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a 
bite or sup 
Wherever there you go; 
So don't treat them with disdain, 
But show each man the same! 
Let all apply, that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come! 
CHORUS . 
Then rise them as you should— 
For ' tis fit we all do good, 
And never crush an Irishman, 
But rise him as you should! (Repeat.)

BIDDY DOYLE. 
Sung by JOILNNY ROACH. 
OFI! I 
nave come over here, Biddy Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddy Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and hand, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddy Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddy Doyle. 
Oh! the summer is past and gone, Biddy Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddy Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow, 
And what will become of you, Biddy Doyle, 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddy Doyle 7 
You know how it is yourself, Biddy Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Biddy Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rough, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddy Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddy Doyle. 
Oh ! when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddy Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddy Doyle ; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that will make you quiet, Biddy Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me, 
Or if you do I'll surely pound you, 
And I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddy Doyle.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1874, by M. O'REARDON. 
0, WE'VE parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful too last, 
And we'll meet as only strangers 
In the future evermore ; 
Our once tender love is buried in the past; 
I've tried to bear the blow 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ach'd with pain, 
But the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For thee, darling, whom I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er; 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain, 
When the mem'ry of the past comes up before me like a 
dream, 
For thee, darling, whom I 
ne'er shall see again. 
They say you love another, 
And he's claimed you for his bride, 
And you ask me to forgive thee and forget 
The vows we pledged together 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into thy beauteous eyes, my pet; 
Ali ! the heart is like the tide, 
That flows and ebbs at will, 
And I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could ; 
Through all the future years 
I'll love thee dearly, love thee still, 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, etc.

C . 
Now where she lives, and what's her name, 
I 
don't intend to tell, 
For certain sure she'd soon be quizzed 
By every noble swell; 
You may see me on a 
Sunday, if 
The weather it is fine, 
As I 
takes my walk, and on my arm, 
Is the girl what I 
calls " mine."—Cno. 
There's servant-maids, and other maids, 
What's dealers at my store, 
They winks their eye, so I 
winks mine, 
In fun—but nothing more; 
If a 
duchess wished to marry me, 
I'd beg leave to decline, 
I'd rather live on bread and cheese, 
With the girl what I 
calls mine.— Cso. 
'Twas on last Sunday afternoon, 
I 
plucked up nerve to pop, 
The question, if she'd have me, and 
My wegebles and shop. 
She didn't say " no," she didn't say ‘1‘ 
yes,"

do believe she'd blush herself to death if anybody'd 
iet her; but it's a 
ton of coals to a 
pint of gooseberries she answers 
"yes"; so if the wegebles should go up a

owing to the matrimonial speculation of this " umble hindiwiddle"

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NW. 
EIGHT years ago I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long; 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On ray wedding-day these clothes were new. 
We went to church, so blithe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ey'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the histiry 
Of where we go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
mysery— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied, 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere ; 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
Aril you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
J.:QIN different now than you were new. 
And you poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went helter-skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell clothes, we part too soon, 
Then for a 
pauper's suit, gray or blue, 
I 
must die in a 
poor-law union. 
In clothes I 
hate, though perhaps quite new.

THE chap Pm going to sing about, 
I'm very fond to tell, 
Is a 
member of my family, 
You ought to know him well; 
He keeps the corner store above, 
Where he sells his beer and wine, 
And he holds a 
public sinecure, 
For he's a 
son of mine! 
CHORUS. 
My son Charley! 
0, ne's the lad! 
0, hear them say he's awful bad ! 
Such a 
boy I 
never had 
As my son Charley! 
My Charley is a 
citizen, 
And he votes for Tammany Hall; 
They will put him up for Alderman, 
If he lives until next fall ; 
He has the ward all to himself, 
And it's him that cuts a 
shine; 
He commands a 
great influence there, 
For he's a 
son of mine! 
My son Charley, etc. 
lie wears a 
handsome black mustache, 
And puffs his long brown hair, 
And in his breast immaculate 
The richest Emeralds glare; 
In a 
quiet neighborhood up town 
He has a 
girl so fine; 
And she's going to marry next Sunday week

MY 
name is McDonough, Pm a 
son of Erin's soil, 
At seven in the morning sure, begins my daily toil; 
And all the day, through heat and cold, I 
pick and dig away, 
And lay the trap- block pavement, on a 
street they calls Broad-
way • 
At home I 
have a 
family, a 
wife and three big boys, 
They nearly drive me crazy wid their fightin' and their noise; 
There's Roger and Fat Mickey and big Dan, that makes the 
three, 
But of all the gang fat Mickey sure he looks the most like me. 
CHORUS. 
Now there's Dan, handsome Dan, 
Sure he's the ladies' man; 
And Roger, he's the divil 
Wid his dancin' and his noise; 
But of all the boys we've none 
So fond of jolly fun 
As Mickey, darlin' Mickey, 
He's the best of all the boys. 
He's as broad as he is lengthy. and he weighs two hundred 
pounds, 
At atein' or at slapein' sure his like cannot be found; 
At snorin' he's the dlvil, now believe me whin I 
say, 
You can hear him snore from Tubby Hook across to Dublin 
Bay; 
And he can ate his size in mate, or pack the grub below, 
At drinkin' Irish whiskey sure, egad, he is not slow ; 
When he comes home at four o'clock, chock full of old benzine, 
You can bet your bottem dollar then some lively sights are 
seen. 
Now there's Dan, etc. 
He joined the " Doherty Fusileers," they put him in the squad, 
lie could not hold a 
musket, so they gave him many a 
Prod; 
He could not march into the ranks, bekase he was too fat, 
So says the Irish sadint, " Mick, I'll bounce you out of that !" 
They made him carry the target thin and march up in the rear, 
And on the street on Patrick's day you'll see him every year; 
He walks along the boulevard, so proudly and so gay, 
And whin the girls observe him, sure you'll always hear them 
say— 
Now there's Dan, etc.

FAT MICKEY.—Concluded. 
They say at Philly.del-phia they're going to have a 
fair, 
And all the curiosities they tell me will be there ; 
I 
think I'll take fat Mickey there, and enter him for style, 
I 
know his fat appearuance will cause ' em all to smile ; 
And if they give a 
premium for " lads that are not quick," 
I 
think he'll get the medal, sure, the boy we calls our Mick ; 
For sure he is no good at all, he never worked a 
day, 
And if you say a 
word to him his mammy's sure to say— 
Now there's Dan, etc. 
THEY SAY I'M A VERY TOUGH MAN.

PERHAPS you don't know who lam, 
If not, I'll let you know,— 
My name is Phelim Rafferty, 
From the County of Sligo. 
I 
talk to all the boys around, 
And I 
please them all I 
can, 
But when they see me walkin' out, 
They say I'm a 
very tough man; 
enorws. 
They say I'm a 
very tough man, 
Sure I 
come from a 
very tough clan; 
I 
carry a 
razor in my boot, 
And they say I'm a 
very tough man. 
work all day and pay my way, 
Wherever I 
may go; 
I 
ax no odds of woman or man, 
As all my friends well know, 
I'm up to all the youthful tricks, 
No matter how they plan! 
I 
take a 
tumble and wipe my chin, 
Because I'm ajery tough man. 
They say, etc. 
I 
walk the street with dignity, 
Like a 
gentleman of fame, 
And if the people say I'm proud, 
Sure I'm not at all to blame ! 
If any young lad attempts to sneer 
At me or my Mary Ann, 
" 
lay a 
junction" on his ear, 
And he'll find I'm a 
very tough man. 
They say, etc.

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
Song of the Times, composed and sung by FRED. J. 
MacKLEY 
IF 
you listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you 
relate, 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new Drama was played on the stage, 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson, of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed ; 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the vio&A, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practised each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage.

UP

I 
rill try und tole you someding 
Vot you see most every day- time, 
As you valk along de sdreed; 
Now und den you meet a 
fellow, 
Mit a 
voice he loud does bellow; 
Vone of whom, when I 
describe him, 
You did often meet. 
He viii holler oud so loud 
To his audience (a 
crowd), 
Uud he give such greacl inducements 
In his own peculiar ray. 
SPOKEN.—Und dis is vot you'll hear him say— 
CHORUS. 
Pins und needles by the dozens, 
For your uncle, aunts, and couzins; 
A Wane gold ring, a 
wedding ring, 
Und a

A 
receipt for making chowder, 
Und here is some fine tooth-powder; 
Take de lot I 
sell to you, 
For dwendy-seven cends. 
Selling,—if it rains, or shining, 
You viii never find him pining; 
But as habby as an oysder 
He does alvays seem to be. 
Telling jokes dot are so funny— 
Anyding to raise de money 
From his audience around; 
An eye to business— see 
If a

In a

But upon some oder corner 
In dwo seconds he will be.

bear this in mind, Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were! how cosy we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing, and that; 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing, and teasing, and pleasing we had, 
Such wooing, and cooing, to make our hearts glad; 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad, 
But still she was awfully spooney on me: 
SPOKEN :—A 
nd if that Soldier would only have left us alone, she would never 
have exclaimed :—Cuouus, 
a •  , 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the Play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learn'd the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She call'd me her rose-bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine ? 
SPOKEN :—Just at that moment a 
Policeman passed and she said :—Cnoars. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, and she calls me Ned; 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife, 
We've a 
fine, handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow ne'er us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful, I'm bless'd with a 
good little wife. 
SPOKEN :—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on 
her face she'll exclaim :—Clloaus. 
( 
2 ) 
KIND friends, I'm a 
martyr, a 
thing of the past, 
A 
poor faded flower that cannot long last, 
once I 
was jolly, handsome and free, 
But my wife has quite settled me. 
I 
thought when I 
got married to Miss Angelina Green, 
That I 
should be the happiest man the world had ever seen, 
But how to tell, this awful tale my blighted features scan, 
Then let me be a 
warning to each unmarried man. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, my happy single friends, look at me—a 
mar-
ried man. 
You see I'm married, although a 
few months back I 
was considered a 
sweet and interesting youth; but now they 
call me the " Caution." 
CHORUS. 
I 
once was so handsome, rosy and gay, 
But now I 
am settled and faded away, 
In fact I 
was rakish and called " Giddy Dan," 
Behold me a 
poor married man. 
No youth could be fairer than I 
used to be, 
The pride and hope of the whole family, 
The image of my mother, the pet of my dad, 
A 
sweet-tempered, round-shouldered lad ; 
My youthful hopes all vanished when rty heart was stole away 
I 
thought Miss Green had money, but grieves rue now to say 
She was ugly, lame, and squinted, and tall as a 
giraffe, 
3Iy friends instead of pitying me they only jeer and laugh. 
SHOKEN.—Yet she never treated me to a 
jam tart, or a 
penny 
valentine ; all she thinks about is reading all the high class 
novels, " Jack Sheppard," " The Road to Ruin," " The New-
gate Calendar," " Sketches" by Turpin and Calcraft, and other 
eminent authors; whilst I—poor Bounce! she calls me" Boggy' 
—has to do the washing and run errands for the lodgers; but 
mind you, a 
day will conic, ' twill be a 
will-come day. 
I 
once was so, etc.

It seems years have lingered since last we did part,

"NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU," 
SWEETLY the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming- of morn; 
Sad is the moon, tho' in radiance beaming, 
She's dreaming alone and forlorn; 
Roses a-d 
lilies so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew, 
So when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you! 
CHORUS. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me if still you are true ! 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment only, 
While Norah, your Norah is dreaming of you I 
Tho' you forget me when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own ! 
Tion't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
r 
as your darling alone! 
come to my heart like a 
bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so true ! 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am waiting, etc.

MY 
thoughts are wandering back to-day, 
On joyous scenes of yore; 
The merry boys and girls at play 
Around the cottage door. 
I 
see the mossy, winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see again the winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut-boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the olden vows; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see again, etc. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee ; 
The girlish voices that I 
hear 
Renew sweet youth in me; 
I 
hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to school.

THE HEN CONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
s.ow of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game-fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick*d race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, 4e. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show. 
It was cackle, sitc. 
GRANDFATHER SAX 
'Young folks, come listen to my song, 
I'm old, I 
won't detain you long, 
Eighty-four you must know I 
am, 
The young folks call me grandfather SaM. 
My hair once black has all turned gray, 
But what of that while I 
feel gay, 
Oh! I 
could sing and dance with glee, 
If I 
was as young as I 
used to be. 
Tididi i 
idid, 
Tididi i 
idid id e 
hop te do 
How I 
love to sing for you, 
Oh! I 
could sing and dance with glee, ' 
If I 
was as young as I 
used to be. 
When I 
was young I 
knew life's joys, 
But many sorrows have come, my boys, 
My dear old wife the joy of my life, 
I 
lost some twenty years gone by. 
I 
c 
uld tell a 
story % would break your heart„ 
But let all sorrow and grief depart. 
I'm a 
jolly old fellow as ever you see, 
And 1 
feel 'bout as young as I 
used to be. 
Tididi i 
idid, 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
was with the girls the most of my time, 
I'd take them out each day for a 
ride, 
And always hal one by my side. 
I'd hug and kiss them just for fun, 
And I've proposed to more than one, 
So if any girl here wants a 
kiss from tne, 
She' I 
find me as young as I 
used to be.

We oftentimes go courting in a

To offend her I'd disdain, 
Her love I

And I'll never cause her pain 
If she'll be true to me. 
She's the apple of my eye, 
I 
love her like pie, 
I've courted her for many a 
weary day; 
I 
asked her to be mine, 
No longer could I 
pine, 
She looked, and laughed, and then to me did say- Cho. 
Her father, that's the old man, is very fond of me; 
We're soon to married be, 
And then there'll be a 
spree 1 
If fortune should but favor her 
With children for her knee, 
How nice to be a

Thus happy night and day 
The time will pass away, 
With the little ones 
play while round they cling, 
And thus so blithe and gay, 
We'll bask in love's sweet ray, 
When seated round the fire she can sing-Cho.

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, English Comic, and given by him 
to JOHNNY ROACH. 
Am.—" Castles in the Air." 
W HILE thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave in 
pain; 
Oh, may I 
never see them in reality again; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to yox 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman, hunger stared them in the face; 
The mother and their children gathered round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and banns his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread; 
Though honest, he is forced to steal, and into jail he's threw ; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill- fed ; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat ; 
He said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat ;" 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran down 
his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good 
grace ; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him through, 
That ends the case, and he gets fre3 in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin dastardly and cold ; 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm told ; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all ; 
In this wide world be played his part, and rolling kept the ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Byer more to rest in peace in this dissolving view.

HOME RULE. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Composed by lienT LEITNEN. 
Copyright, 1875, by JOHN RoAcu. 
IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on Our land, 
Our sons they then were free, and the star of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main'? 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
henry Grattan is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
his energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice be never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to- night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc.

I 
BELONG to a 
gay society, 
Mysterious and unknown, 
We're famous for our piety, 
When we are left alone; 
Our members all are gentlemen 
Whose object is to please, 
And here you have a 
specimen 
Of the F. M. G.'s. 
CHORUS. 
We are the F. M. G.'s, 
All gentlemen of ease, 
When at the social fireside 
The girls we please; 
We are bold and true, 
And though we are but few, 
We'll make a 
grand society 
Of the F. M. G.'s. 
We travel among the pretty girls, 
So festive and so fair,— 
For as we have such witching ways, 
They ask us ev'rywhere! 
In schools of great profundity, 
We all got our degrees, 
And there we learn'd the mystery 
Of the F. M. 
G.'s. 
We are the, etc. 
We represent a 
neighborhood 
That glories in OUT name, 
We shun the field of politics, 
And search for social game; 
They say we've a 
slight propensity 
To lager beer and cheese, 
But that's a 
private privilege 
Of the F. M. G.'s. 
We are the, etc. 
There's Freddy, the gay Lothario, 
And John the Alderman, 
And an Ulster coat with whiskers, 
Which they call a 
nice young man I 
There's several other members 
Whom to name would only tease,— 
They must remain a 
mystery 
Like the F.

TEIE regiment is forming now, 
The ranks are nearly filled; 
For valor and for victory 
Our hearts are always drilled ; 
All Irishmen unite with us. 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or die like soldiers 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms we go. 
So straizht in every line— 
Admiring, friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
Ilnrrah for the Irish Regiment that waits the bugle's call! 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall: 
Of razing war or cannon's roar we have no fear at all ; 
Well march away to glory in the Irish Regiment. 
We'll show our Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do 
In the armory or battle-field 
To duty we are true; 
When marching on the gay parade 
We are the nation's Ode. 
While the stars and stripes and Erin's dag 
Are flying side by side! 
In dashing .uniforms we go, 
So - traight in every line: 
Admiring friends their praise bestow.

Hurrah for the Irish Regiment. etc. 
The cause we serve is liberty. 
And were a

Some day well see the tyrants fall. 
And freedom in our land: 
But far away we now must stay. 
And be with hope content.

gallant brigade from Erin's isle, 
And many a 
fight we've won; 
We'll dance a 
step or take a

And our comrades never shun; 
When dress'd in regimentals, 
Sure of none we are afraid! 
And we are known where'er we go 
As men of the gallant brigade. 
CHORE'S. 
The gallant brigade is never afraid 
To meet a

We're sure to make a

Wherever we may go— 
With trumpet and gun we march away 
In a 
beautiful parade, 
And we're so proud we charm the crowd 
To cheer for the gallant brigade. 
We're first in the field, all brave and true, 
If war should call us out; 
And when we're home we pass our time 
In showing the girls about; 
I've often heard them sigh and wish 
That they could be arrayed 
In uniforms of blue and green 
Like those of the gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, etc. 
On the Fourth of July and Patrick's Day 
Were out in glorious style, 
While the stars and stripes and Ireland's flag 
Above us wave the while; 
The glories of this nation then 
In fancy are displayed, 
And at night we drink a 
partiwr glass 
To Anierka'3 gallant brigade.

When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when ray arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry! 
SPOKEN.—He declared I 
was hurting his Mamma, and would 
insist upon sitting between us, may fancy making lore to a 
girl with a 
boy in the tray, but. she said to him in a 
voice so sweet: 
CEO.—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &-c. 
3 
The mother told her loving son 
To watch the passing train, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young Elf? 
SPOREN.— Yes, it would never do to make lore before the boy, and 
trte Widow said—" _Yot before the Lou. Fred. root before the boy; just 
then. we went under a 
tunnel, and she said: 
CI:W.— Tommy, make room for yoni Uncle, tte.

In a 
snug retreat at Roshenille, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sighed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how about the child ?" 
Ad 
clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I 
the agony piled! 
SPOKEN. — I 
said." My lovely of all lorely bein(*.
.r, let us fy to some 
foreign dens. where I 
will protet1 you and your boy." 
She answered, 
and said, •• How about my 1;ttle pie shop in Seven Dials 1" " Oh 
B14,,orrisbury I 
do you keep a 
pie shop ?" 
CEO.—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &

I'vE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum- punches, 
But now I'm obli7ed to go dry: 
Cries the man at the bar : " You're a 
hummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand ; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold. sir.

Can you wonder they're hungry and dry ? 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder, 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat ? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shillin7, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight ; 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry.

"VTR SPADE." 
As sung by Gus Wirmews. 
Give int the Spade and the man who can use it; 
A fg for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, cte. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While '
tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create I 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons— the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, ttc. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done. boys, without. 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts wer.e 
yell-
ing, 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade,

Famed for its wealth and its beauty, boys, 
Its darling dear girls and their style; 
On Broadway, my boys, or the Bowery 
No stranger e'er met with a 
frown; 
Take my word, I 
belong to the city, 
And hail from the East Side of town. 
CHORUS. 
The East Side of town 
Beats the world up and down 
For pie-nic, party, or ball, 
For boys without fear, 
; 
And good lager beer, 
The East Side of town beats them all. 
The dandies they dance on the Avenue V, 
In aristocratic soirees, 
'Champagne they drink as if it were tea, 
Their pa's and their mamma's to please; 
,They should see the quadrille called the Nine Pin, 
Or a 
real old-fashioned break-down ; 
They pivot, you bet, on a 
spangle, 
The girls from the East Side of town. 
The East Side, etc. 
,Tho mechanic you will find there too, 
The industrious laboring class, 
The sewing girl from her labor and toil 
On the sidewalk doth cheerfully pass ; 
She is happy indeed, and little doth need, 
If she has but a 
calico r
,own 
We all do agree that if jilly you'd be, 
You must live on the East Side of town. 
The East Side, etc.

GOOD -BYE, BIDDY DEAR.

_OBEIZT M. DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
cabin with an open window. 
Enter TEDDY, with a 
bundle slung over his shoulder.] 
TEDDY.—I've had a 
bard time of it here in ould Erin, and 
although I've tried to keep up my spirits for the sake of my 
dear colleen, I've at last been forced to go over the sea. 
It's 
hard, hard times in the ould land, and I 
must be off to the 
new. 
But do you think that I 
ever can forget you, Erin dar-
ling? 
Bad luck to the Irishman that ever did! 
One more 
sweet kiss from the girl I 
love, and then for the big ship. 
This is Biddy's cabin. 
She must be up. 
I'll knock. [Knocks 
at cabin door.] 
Biddy acushla! 
[BIDDY at the open window.] 
BIDDY. — Is that you, Teddy ? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint, and I'm going away; so I 
thought I'd 
come and say good-bye. 
BI 
DDY.—G 
oilk; away so soon ? 
TEDDY.—Yes, darlint; but it won't be for long. 
I'll soon 
clasp you to my heart again, and we shall be as happy as the 
starling. 
BIDDY.—But you'll forget me, Teddy; they say there's pret-
tier faces over there than you'll find at home, to steal away 
your heart. 
TEDDY.—Is it prettier faces there than here ? 
Why, beau-
tiful girls in mild Ireland are as plentiful as the daisies : and 
you are the queen of them all. 
I 
could never forget you, 
Biddy; don't speak like that. 
Sure among ten thousand lovely 
girls I 
couldn't see one but you. 
[Music plays the symph ,2ny of the song. 
clasp hands at the window.] 
TEDDY sings. 
Then here I 
am an Irishman, 
I'm always fond of mirth; 
But show me the creature 
Would slight me for my birth. 
( 1 ) 
BIDDY and TEDDY 
GOOD-BYE, 
BIDDY DEAR.—[CONTINUED.] 
And here's my sweet colleen 
I'm forced to leave behind; 
I 
always was the broth of a 
boy, 
And my true love she is kind. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
Biddy 
Teddy } 
0! 0! 
good-bye, / 
dear; 
'Tis hard to part from you; 
Although we're going to sever, 
My heart it will prove true. 
Then cheer up, mavourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
We soon will meet again, love, 
When these gloomy days are gone. 
TEDDY.—I 
wouldn't leave ould Ire'and, 
But times are bad, you know; 
So to the land of plenty, 
My darlint, I 
must go. 
I 
bundled up ray kit, 
Oh, Biddy, don't you cry; 
The vessel soon will bear me on 
With many a 
weary sigh. 
CHORES—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
TEDDY.—When I 
arrive, ray darlint, 
There'll be joy within ray soul, 
I'll work and save my money, 
And send you, love, the whole. 
The maidens may be fair; 
But, Biddy, never fear— 
The last words that you say will still 
Be ringing in my ears. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY.

TEDDY. —NOW I 
must say good-bye to you, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
The ship will soon be sailing 
Far out from Dublin Bay. 
But, Biddy, soon expect me, 
We'll marry by-and-bye; 
Oh, when you are for ever mine, 
No more I'll weep and sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY.

sorroufully after him.]

POLITICAL SITUATION. 
Ant--" Great Big Steamer." 
You have heard the song of the Boulevard 
To go there you must get a 
card, 
And how the poor man works so hard 
From morning until evening; 
I 
once for a 
man did vote, 
And he gave me a 
bit of a 
note, 
By himself it was surely wrote, 
For to get me a 
situation. 
CHORUS . 
For to use shovels and picks 
On stones and bricks and clubs and sticks, 
And all such tricks they're good for nix, 
And I 
am heartily sick of political situations. 
They gave me a 
shovel in my hand, 
They told me to dig up the land ; 
Says Ito myself, I'll see you be hanged, 
To work up on the railway; 
This is what I 
did say, 
To work ten hours a 
day 
I 
tell you it does not pay 
Up in a 
hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc. 
At night I 
lay me down to sleep, 
The Yankee bugs around me creep, 
The (Evil a 
wink they'd let me sleep 
Till daylight in the morning ; 
Next morning when I 
arose, 
And quickly I'd slip on my clothes, 
And just think where I 
had to go 
Up to One Hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc. 
In Eighteen Hundred and Forty-five, 
When Daniel O'Connell was alive, 
At such a 
job I'd never drive 
To keep myself from starving, 
And now, although I'm old and poor, 
There is one thing that is sure, 
I 
don't want any sinecure 
Up in One Hundred and Eighty-ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc.

TWENTY-FIVE CENT SONG BOOKS 
Most Attractive, Best and Cheapest in the World, 
It is now an admitted fact that De WITT'S TwENTT-FIVE CENT SONG BOOKS are paragons of per-
