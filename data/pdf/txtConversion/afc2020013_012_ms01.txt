Biographical Info and Early Memories of Ransomville Speedway 
Born and raised in the Niagara Falls / Niagara area 
Uncle (Sam Fisher) brought him to Ransomville when he was young 
Brother (Phil) got involved and built a car (mini stock Volkswagen), driving it 
around fields for awhile 
 
[2:25]   
Building First Car (mini stock), Second (Late Model), and Third (bomber) 
Built the mini stock, raced it at Ransomville, Merritville (cross border), and 
Humberstone.  
Built late model, but had very short career: story about blowing up the motor 
driving around a field before getting to the race track 
Built bomber class (straight six cylinder, Chevy Malibu) 
Challenge in building was time, not skill: brother was millwright and he knew 
how to weld 
Learning to weld from brother, and repairing bicycles as a kid  
 
[5:10]   
Early Racing Career  
Worked and helped brother in his car for years (malibu 6 cylinder) 
Decided to start racing in 1979 in a Pontiac lemans  
Timeframe: 6 years before racing, had started with building that first mini stock 
with his brother 
Practicing and picking up skills driving around in a field car 
Getting more serious and racing not just on Friday nights, but three nights a 
week at times 
Racing against / with brother 
 
[7:35]   
End of Racing Career 
1988 brother quit racing 
1989 Dave broke ankle responding to a fire (was fire chief at the time) 
Sold car and became an official 
Brothers worked on each other’s cars when needed 
 
[9:00]   
Early Career at Ransomville 
Ransomville Fire Chief letting him sign on / under to work under the fire hall at 
Ransomville, way to watch the weekly race for free 
Brother (Phil) was working at the track then, and scale guy needed replacement 
Filling in for scales being his first job at Ransomville 
 
[10:00]   
Description and Walkthrough of Scales 
How much cars have to weigh, and doing scales usually after a race/heat  
Cars have to make the weight, can’t be above or under, or would be DQ’d 
Difference in car weight distribution now: with current tech can put weight 
where you want it (over certain tire), but back in day would just bolt on to make 
weight—now there’s specific strategy to it 
Scales are now drive on at Ransomville, in past was portable 
Tricks and strategies drivers sometimes did to ‘trick’ the scales 
 
[16:00]   
Next Position at Ransomville 
Moving from scales over into lineups 
Lineups happening behind the pit concession for heat features 
Order would be called over to pit steward (at the time his brother Phil), who’d 
write them down and hand it to him, and he’d line the cars up 
Using loudspeaker to announce lineups are on the board 
Discussion of games the drivers would play, like pretending to not hear or know 
their spot 
Danger of being hit working lineups, and memory of getting hit once (and 
ending up on someone’s hood) 
Shifting of positions between Bobby St. Amand, his brother, and him: when 
bobby retired Phil moved to pit steward, Dave to lineups. When Phil moved to 
NC, Dave moved to pit steward 
 
[22:30]   
Responsibility of Pit Steward 
Discussion of breakdown of roles of pit positions 
Pit Steward responsibilities including resolving questions, relaying messages 
from the tower to drivers, handling complaints, coordinating 
Learning Pit Steward role from St. Amand and his brother 
Expanding role to fit his preference for moving around and roaming around 
Impact of technology on pit steward role, including wifi, cellphones, 
transponders, four wheelers 
 
[33:39]   
(interview pause) 
 
[35:10]   
Pit Steward Responsibilities (continued) 
Being point person for the tower and drivers in the pit 
Issues cropping up at times, and importance of de-escalation, and recognizing 
when third parties come in can make it escalate badly 
Memory of a bad escalation where ended up in middle trying to break something 
up and got knocked out and sent to hospital 
Importance of being a driver to being steward, and understanding why a driver 
might be mad and trying to cap it off before it gets too far 
Letting people ‘blow their core’ at him, understanding everyone has bad days, 
and then moving on from it 
Watching the race to anticipate why someone might be upset 
 
[42:30]   
Walkthrough of Race Day 
Keeping eye on social media, especially for driver rumors if someone says 
they’re going to do something like wiping someone else out, or trying to do 
something outside of the rules in terms of tech 
Squishing problems by getting to the driver’s point blank, or letting them know 
he’s keeping an eye on something if it happens before it happens 
Two years ago got approval to give verbal warning before flat fine, but is 
confused why some people would rather take the fine than get a verbal warning 
End of night meeting with Jenn Martin & other folks in the pit or on the track, 
but he is the main point person for driver complaints so chain of communication 
with decisions don’t get confused or disrupted (i.e. one person said this and 
another person said that) 
Tech scaling cars now as a new development 
 
[50:55]   
Off Season Responsibilities 
Track official meetings 
Discussions on how to keep track operating at highest level and improving 
Helping out with sign up meetings 
No specific preparation 
 
[52:15]   
Pit Steward Moments He Enjoys 
Meeting great drivers like Bret Hearn and Danny Johnson 
Seeing the young / next generation of drivers like Erick Rudolph and Susice, 
being kids he’s known since they were born: jokes raced with their fathers, now 
yelling at their kids 
Traveling around to watch races at different tracks 
Stopped working at Batavia as Pit Steward, and at Lancaster too (assistant 
steward while brother was pit steward there), because of the long drive and time 
would get home. So now just working at Ransomville. 
Getting positions at other tracks through people seeing how you work at home 
track 
 
[55:10]  
Coordinating Officiating with Traveling Series like Dirt 
Dirt bringing their own officials 
Track officials working alongside dirt officials 
Chain of calls made when there’s a traveling series at a local track, and different 
racers 
 
[57:05]   
Technology and Pit Steward Role 
Impact of videotape on being a pit steward 
Being able to review calls both to confirm or realize a mistake (and mistakes can 
happen as track officials are just human) 
Video being useful as it eliminates hearsay – can go straight to tape to review 
 
[58:05]  
Closing Thoughts: Enjoying and Advice 
Enjoying meeting the drivers as pit steward that he followed and was fans of, 
and traveling around tracks 
Going to World Finals in Charlotte, Syracuse Fairgrounds, etc. – then the 
‘Daytona of dirt’ 
Being involved as a racing fan 
Advice on becoming pit steward: getting involved and helping out with 
anything and everything at a track
