Wee Waw Waddle
WEE WAW WADDLE 5115- B3
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
May father left me when he died One good gray horse to ride Come a wee waw waddle
Come a jack straw straddle Come a little boy paddle Come a ridin' off a broom.
Traded that horse for a cow When I traded I didn't know how Come a wee waw waddle
Come a jack straw straddle Come a little boy paddle Come a ridin' off a broom.
Traded that cow for a calf When I traded I lost just half Come a wee waw waddle Come a
jack straw straddle Come a little boy paddle Come a ridin' off a broom.
Traded that calf for a hog When I traded I acted like a dog Come a wee waw waddle Come
a jack straw straddle Come a little boy paddle Come a ridin' off a broom.
Traded that hog for an egg Looked like a devil stickin' on a snag Come a wee waw waddle
Come a jack straw straddle Come a little boy paddle Come a ridin' off a broom.
