FOOTLIGHT FLASHES. 
OUR COMEDIANS. 
NO, 1.-MR. A. H. SHELDON. 
The merits of this gentleman are so well known and Ap. 
preciated that endorsement at our hands is almost super-
fluous. 
Still, we cannot allow the opportunity to pass 
without paying tribute to the genius of a 
man who is able, 
without the slightest perceptible effort on his part, to cre-
ate the most boisterous merriment, and keep his audience, 
for hours at a time, in a 
state of good humor. 
Gifted 
with talents of a 
high order, he is conversant with every 
detail of his profession, and possesses a 
keen relish for the 
ludicrous. 
It is said of this gentleman, and we believe 
with truth, that he has rescued by the very force of his 
exuberant humor and incomparable acting, many a 
new 
drama from condemnation and oblivion. 
Mr. Sheldon follows no traditions. 
He is not a 
slave to 
custom. He thinks and acts for himself, and is thoroughly 
original in every character lie undertakes. 
Among those 
characters, in the impersonation of which he has especially 
distinguished himself, may be mentioned that of the Art-
ful Dodger in " Oliver Twist." 
In this character he hap-
pily realizes the conception of the author. As Judge Suggs 
in " Kit" lie 
is incomparable and irresistible. 
His 
" 
make-up " in this character is a 
study, and his imperson-
ation a 
delightful piece of comedy acting, true to nature 
and free from vulgarity and burlesque. 
As Dan in " The

FOOTLIGHT FLASHES—CONTINUED. 
Streets of New York," Marks in " Uncle Tom's Cabin," 
Greppo in the " Black Crook," Sir Joseph in " Pinafore," 
Joe Green in " Wealth and Crime," Schnapps in the 
"Naiad Queen," and numerous other characters, he is 
equally successful. 
While on the stage he is given carte blanche to follow the 
dictates of his own inclinations. 
He is not hampered or 
restricted by foolish or unnecessary rules; as a 
consequence 
his abilities have ample scope to display themselves, and 
his natural powers are afforded full play. 
Mr. Sheldon is the author of the following well -known 
sensational dramas: " Wealth and Crime," " Under False 
Colors," " Vice and Poverty," " Blackwell's Island," 
"Boy Champion," " Five 
Escapes of Scarlet Ned," 
" 
Demon of Gold," and 200 others. 
To sum up, Mr. Sheldon represents, in fact is, the au-
thor of a 
school of acting that is destined ere long to cre-
ate a 
revolution in the dramatic world. 
The sooner this 
event transpires the better. 
We are tired of the stale old 
quips and quirks which characterized the performances of 
years ago, and distinguishes modern representations, and 
sigh for a 
change. 
Mr. Sheldon has it in his power to 
gratify us in this respect. 
We look to him as the coming 
Comedian to successfully establish this delightful class of 
acting, and make popular the new and sparkling humor 
of which he stands to-day the ablest exponent in our 
midst.-17te _Metropolis, April 30th, 
IF I 
ONLY HAD MY WAY 
 :o:  
Written by CHARLES DOCKSTARDER, and Sung by A. H. SHELDON.

0 : 
Now there's many things that I 
would do if I 
only had my 
say, 
kold turn things topsy turvey if I 
only had my way. 
I'd lix things up to suit myself on land, lake, sea or bay, 
And I 
guess I'd have a 
high old time if I 
only had my 
way. 
I'd stop all fuss in Congress, and I'd settle up this muss 
They are having now in Europe, then I'd let diem swear 
and cuss. 
I'd get cross-eyed cats for all old maids, that could sing La 
the key of A, 
Then I'd let them fight, scratch, thaw and bite, if I 
only 
had my way. 
Next I'd sell the State of Jersey, and I'd make them move 
it away, 
The place that kicks the dickens up on each election clay, 
I'd coax Garfield away from Washington, put Cross-Eyed 
Bill in his chair— 
And I'd put Ben Butler in a 
dry goods store to sell cottoz 
socks by the pair. 
I'd hunt up General Grant and swear I 
was his brother, 
I'd make him introduce me to Conkling and his mother. 
IF I 
IL1D ONLY HAD MY WAY—Covrixtu..n 
I'd tell Queen Victoria when our boys went over taere 
to play, 
Not to send them home in the steerage, if I 
only had my 
way. 
I'd stOp leaky ships from going to sea, and wrecking 
human lives, 
I'd give workingmen enough to keep their children and 
wives; 
If I 
had all the money in the world I'd give -
Beecher a 
dol-
lar a 
day. 
And I'd make him preach and earn it, if I 
only had my 
way. 
I'd be on good terms with myself, and get in trouble 
never, 
I'd have the fellow hung, drawn and quartered who first 
said hardly ever. 
I'd have old time railroad companies, who would old time 
wages pay, 
I'd have lager running free in the streets, if I 
only had my 
way.

The Chicago hornet lately published the following 
thusing anec-

SHELDON, the eminent Comedian and Manager.

0 
About four years ago, a drama entitled " Woman of 
The -World " was performed at Wood's Museum, New 
York. 
During the action of the second act the leading 
lady jumps overboard from a 
North River steamboat, but 
is rescued by the comic character, Dick the Glazier. 
The business of the scene required Mr. Sheldon to (hag 
the body out of the water; the tableau is formed, and the 
curt in descends as the villain exclaims, "Sired by Heavens!" 
On the occasion 
referred to, the curtin, 
from some 
unaccountable reason, refused to work, thereby causing a 
long stage wait. 
The villain again vociferated, " Bared by 
Heavens!" when Sheldon replied, " _
NO, saved by me, Dick 
the Glazier!" and the curtin fell amidst unbounded merri-
ment. 
The late M. W. Leffingwell in speaking of A. H. Shel-
don as a funny man, said: " For hanging his hat on 
steeples a mile off, 
walking on the water, caving set 
rocks up a 
mountain, or making the audience laugh, give 
me Sheldon above all other comedians in the world.

BONES.— Sam, a 
man takes a 
good many chances in dis 
world. 
NI.— Oh, yes. 
B. —Some fellows take a 
good many overcoats, and a 
heap of medicine, and they keep taking chances all their 
lives. 
Yes, sir, life has many chances—so's Christmas tur-
keys; their chances are in-dice-ing. 
You take an infant 
when he's born; see the paregoric chances he takes, and if 
he's putty, see the two tips he's got to eat; and when he 
grows up see the barrels of oil he's got to use in his head 
to in-grease Ids beauty; see how ninny times he's actually 
forced to say " my darling," when he don't mean it: see 
the new clothes he has to wear out when he ain't in the 
house; see the terrible amount of duels he has to fight with 
tailors and shoemakers— why, it's enough to dissect him. 
See the chances he takes at boarding-houses on the you-
rope-in plan; see the dyspepsia dumplings he has to de-
vour, with lots of old ledgers for stuffing. 
Then watch 
him benzine it from his youth up, till he co-operates in the 
connubial bliss of a 
matter-o'money. 
See the symptoms; 
see him go to a 
ball; sees a 
blonde or a 
brunette, or olive— 
a fair creature who dazzles his optics—she waltzes, 'tis 
the redaway or haulaway. 
At last she comes in his way; 
and, as she dances, he and she glances; two glances make 
one look; he and she look—two looks make one sigh; he 
and she sigh—two sighs make one waltz; he and she waltz 
—two waltz make one palpitation; he and she palpitate— 
two palpitates make one call; he and she call (for cream) 
—two calls make one attention (and four dollars and a 
half); two attentions make one fool—sometimes two; two 
fools make one flirtation; two flirtations make two bou-
quets; two bouquets make one engagement; one engage-
ment makes one marriage, one marriage makes— 
M.— What? 
13.—One marriage makes— (Bus) 
M.—Well, sir? 
B.—Makes a 
heap of trouble around the house! 
THE ABSENT MINDED MAN! 
Written and Sung by A. II. SHELDON. 
I'm troubled and vexed, the reason why— 
I'll now explain to you, 
I'm so forgetful all the time— 
I 
know not what to do, 
When—but a 
little boy of ten— 
If mother sent me out, 
To buy the stuff for baby's pap, 
I 
brought home sourkraut 1 
SPOEEN.—It's an actual fact, ever since I 
came into this 
great and glorious world, I 
have been absent minded. I 
am not sure that I 
was ever born. 
Perhaps I 
was hatched 
by steam! I 
will swear I 
do not know who my father was 
—eh 1—why--swipes? 
CHORUS: 
I'm an absent minded man, 
Have been so since my birth, 
And have done naught but silly things, 
Since I've been on this earth. 
The many foolish things I 
do, 
Are hard to understand; 
I've often hunted for my glove, 
When it was on my hand. 
While riding in a 
Broadway stage, 
I 
met with a 
sad mishap; 
I 
pulled my left hand neighbor's nose, 
Instead of the driver's strap. 
THE ABSENT MINDED MAN—CONTINUED. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was out riding yesterday in a 
stage; a 
lady asked me to put her fare iii the box, I 
took it and 
placed it in my own, pocket. 
I 
couldn't help it—I'm so 
absent minded. 
Last evening as I 
was returning from the 
Laundry, smoking a 
for de rank a p,edie segar, I 
felt 
weary, and concluded to retire for the night. 
Well, I 
took 
off my clothes, placed my segar in bed, chucked my 
clothes out of the window, and went to sleep in the wash 
tub—why—because— 
Cnonus: 
Pm an absent minded man,

And have done naught but silly things,

SHELDON WON AT LOTTERY. 
0 
In 
1869, A. 
II. 
SHELDON wound up a 
long engagement in Syracuse 
in connection with the " Mechanics Fair," haying gained an im-
mense popularity. At the conclusion, a 
number of gifts were dis-
tributed to the audience by lot, of which the Standard says: 
" 
As the last three numbers were about to be drawn, 
two gentlemen brought to view a 
new willow basket, 5 
feet long, well proportioned, with cover and handles. 
One of the gentlemen said it was the understanding that 
the lady who drew the basket was to take it's contents also. 
When the drawing was concluded, call was made for tho 
lucky ones, when a 
middle aged old maid stepped upon 
the stage to claim the basket and contents. 
Just as she 
placed her hand on the lid, it flew up, and out popped the 
head and shoulders of Sheldon, the comedian. 
The old 
maid screamed murder and ran off the stage, leaving 
Sheldon, whose grinning phiz and comical rig brought 
down the house in repeated shouts of laughter and ap-
plause. 
The audience would hardly let him go without 
a 
song, but he bowed and scraped himself behind the 
bceues, and the Fair of 1869 was over."

PORK AND BEANS.

Written and Sung by A. H. SBELDON in his great Sensational Drama 
of " Wealth and Crime." 
• -: 0 :---
When but a 
little boy, I 
was my father's only joy; 
And many words of wisdom he tight me; 
lie told me not to eat more than ten plates of cold 
meat, 
For breakfast, luncheon, dinnner, or for tea. 
When I 
grew to man's estate, my appetite did not 
abate, 
I 
could eat my fill like all the free lunch fiends; 
Quail on toast is very good, Charlotte Russe is dainty 
food, 
But it's different when you tackle (Smacks lips) Pork 
and Beans! 
Now don't think me very rash, 'cause I'm fond of eat-
ing hash, 
Which I 
don't refuse, unless there's too much hair; 
I 
can punish good mince pies, ham and eggs, or oyster 
pies, 
And clam chowder is to me, delicious fare. 
I'd rattler eat than sleep, I'd prefer to run than creep 
To the largest restaurant that's in the land; 
Shortcake I 
do adore, blanc mange I 
can eat raw, 
But it's different when you tackle— 
Takes out pie and eats; gives several bites to the orches-
tra and says: 
Pork and Beaus.

WHY DO I 
LOVE THEE? 
THE SOBER VOLUNTEER. 
As Sting by A. II. SHELDON in " The Colleen Bawn." 
0 
:-
Thine eyes like the stars that are gleaming, 
Have entered the depths of my soul; 
And my heart has grown wild with its dreamings, 
And the feeling I 
cannot control. 
In vain do I 
strive to dissemble, 
And vow that I 
love thee no more; 
A 
touch of thy hand makes me tremble, 
And recalls all my sorrows of yore. 
A 
touch of thy hand makes me tremble, 
And recalls all my sorrows of yore. 
Oh, why once again have I 
met thee, 
And why is this sorrow now mine; 
In vain do I 
strive to forget thee, 
But my heart is enslaved unto thine. 
Still, still do I 
love thee, 
Do I 
fear thee, would keep thee, yet beg thee to go, 
'Tis death to be parted, but near thee 
'Tis woe, irretrievable woe. 
'Tis death to be parted, but near thee 
'Tis woe, irretrievable woe. 
N.ritten and -sung by A. II. SHELDON in the Drama of " Across 
the Continent." 
Oh! I'm a 
sober volunteer, 
As you can plainly see; 
My clothes they are somewhat too big, 
But they came near fitting me; 
I 
carry my knapsack in my pocket, 
My musket on my back, 
And when the Colonel he don't look, 
I 
give them both the sack. 
CHORUS AND BURLESQUE DRILL: 
For I 
march, march, march, 
From daylight until dark; 
I'd rather drive a 
mule, 
tip in the Central Park. 
Oh, I 
must away, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
For I 
must see my gal, so young and fair— 
I 
march, march, march, 
To get some lager beer, 
Or sweitzer kaise— 
For I 
am feeling queer. 
So right about, 
My toes turned out, 
I'll walk right out of here. 
Of course you all know of the seventh, 
Likewise the seventy-onest, 
My regiment it beats them all— 
The one hundred and ° nest!' once. 
Our Colonel's got a 
crocketty eye, 
lie's likewise blind and lame, 
And though he is a 
great big coward, 
Why, I 
never am afraid! 
(Repeat Chorus; repeat drill. 
Two guns fired outside 
and Tableau at back representing The Dying 
Soldier on a 
Drunk).

DREAMS.

-: 0: 
I've heard it said and wisely too, 
That all fools ain't dead yet, 
As better proof of that proverb, 
Now I'm alive you bet; 
I 
wander sad, dejected too, 
The cause to me it seems— 
Is being troubled night and day, 
By what I 
see in dreams. 
CHORUS. 
Dreams 
Dreams I 
Queer things seen in dreams 
How strange and odd it seems, 
That we should see a 
horrid sight 
As we lie in bed each night. 
I've seen elephants a 
playing tag, 
With Ifilderbrand Montrose and big baboons, 
In sealskin sacks a 
waltzing on my nose! 
A 
little flea, I 
could plainly see, 
With hair a 
fiery red, 
He turned a 
double somersault 
And landed on his head I

MY KEY. 
Written and Sung by A. 
H. 
SHELDON in the Drama 
of the " Naiad Queen." 
0:-
Oh, I 
am in trouble, now what shall I 
do, 
If you will listen, I'll quickly tell you; 
I 
left my home quite early last night, 
Got drunk on bad beer and returned very tight. 
I 
crept from my house, just like any mouse, 
My wife was asleep, as forth I 
did creep. 
CHORUS: 
(Feels in his pocket). 
My key, my key, 
Oh, I 
have lost my key; 
If any one has found it, 
Give it back to me. 
(Pauses and searches again). 
I 
had it in my pocket, 
The door I 
can't unlock it; 
Oh, dear me, pity me, 
Can't get in without my key. 
Should my wife now awake and her husband discover 
She'd get a 
divorce and go home to her mother; 
Should a 
peeler now come, he'd take me to jail, 
With no one to help me, and none to go bail. 
I 
think that it's best that I 
take a 
rest, 
So I 
will lie here, (Lies down in front of door). 
And sleep off the beer. 
(Chorus repeated and he is carried off by policeman).

JOHNSON— Ned, where did you rusticate this summer. 
NED—At Niagrawah Fawls ( Niagra Falls.) 
JOHNSON—Did any of your friends accompany you ? 
NED—Yes; Johnny Roach, Billy Patterson, and Ike Cook. 
JOHNSON—At what house did you stop. 
NED—Well, to tell the truth, we went to the Clifton to take 
20 
rooms, but they and all the rest of the houses were full, so val 
came back to the Clifton, and the clerk told us he could eat us, 
but that he could not sleep us. 
Jonxsos—You mean that the clerk of the Clifton House told 
you and your friends that he could board you, but that lie could 
not accommodate you with lodgings. 
NED—Yes. 
So after passing the day pleasantly we retired to 
the hotel, and staid in the bar room—smoking, talking, and oc-
casionally taking some peppermint— until they closed up the 
house. 
Then the clerk he came up to me and told me and my 
friends to follow him into the yard, which we did; and when we 
got there he showed us a 
big board fence. Says he: Gentlemen 
you can hang up there for the rest of the night. 
JOHNSON—Well, did you rest comfortably ? 
NED—We would have rested comfortably enough if it had 
not been for Hie mosquitoes. 
Umpli! Talk about mosquitoes' 
Why, a 
great many of them would weigh a 
pound. 
JOHNSON—Oh here, Ned, that is ;going it too _strong,—the 
idea of mosquitoes weighing a 
pound each! 
NED—Who said so, say? 
Jonsses—You did. 
NED—No I 
didn't; I 
said that a 
great many of them would 
weigh a 
pound. 
JonNsoN—Oh! a 
great many. 
NED —Well, you ought to have seen us fellers in' the morn. 
ing. Why, Johnson, they had the back of my neck all raw where 
they bit me; they had like to eat the arms off Johnny Roach; 
and they came near chawing off the bugle of Billy Patterson. 
JOHNSON—The what off? 
NED—Patterson's horn. 
JOHNSON—Explain yourself. 
NED—Why, his nose. 
JOHOSON—Now I 
understand you. 
NED—Ike Cook he was bit all over the back; I 
tell you, 
when we came in the sitting-room we were a 
nice sight; and 
the bites itched so bad that Patterson kept scratchihg his nose, 
I 
kept my hands going on the back of my neck, Johnny Roach

"LARDY DAR! LARDY DAII!" 
As sung by JOHNSON & POWERS. Written by J. 
JOHNSON, and sung 
with terrible success at the SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. 
Let me introduce this gawk, lardy dab, lardy dah, 
A gawk can scarcely talk, lardy dah; 
A lunch-counter he will eat, 
lie's a 
terror to every street, 
And he was never known to treat, lardy dah, 
And at election he'll repeat lardy dah. 
CHORUS: 
For he wears a 
barrel of flour in his coat, lardy dab, 
And an old striped stocking round his throat, lardy dah, 
In his mouth a 
big segar, and his hands are smeared with 
tar, 
And he drives a 
gay horse-car, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
And he pockets all the fare, lardy dah. 
He is something of a 
spooney, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
The girls all say he's looney, lardy dah; 
With his side- hair so fine, oh, don't he cut a 
shine, 
And he's yelling all the time, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
But I've got him on a 
line, oh, lardy dah. 
His shirt is very tricky, lardy daft, lardy dah, 
It's a 
pair of cuffs and dicky, lardy dab; 
his shoes are all broke out, his best clothes are up the 
spout, 
Now just listen to him shout, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
He'll never die with gout. oh, lardy dah. 
Air.—Vilikins and his Dinah.

We're a 
jolly fat couple as you can see, 
I 
laugh with my wife, and she laughs with me; 
We laugh la the house and we laugh in the street, 
And we're laughed at by everyone whom we meet. 
CHORUS: 
In the morning at breakfast we have a 
good laugh, 
And all sorts of fun, we can't tell you half; 
And the neighbors all say as they pass by our door, 
They never heard laughing so hearty before. 
Kind friends, we advise you to laugh and grow fat, 
Now you certainly will pay attention to that; 
To laugh and be jolly like my wife and I, 
Is a 
pleasure I 
know that you all will enjoy.

FRIENDS THAT STAND BY US, 
Written and Sung, with great success, by Wm. COVRTRI4111% 
NOW, then, subjects for songs nowadays are so scarce. 
And to find one I've looked far and near every ,ay; 
And the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For its something like looking kr needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through 
thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as its nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little cif, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works your-
self. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right its their wish you can wager to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you through thick Lnd 
through thin. 
Our country's made up of all classes, all nations, 
Ev'ry mixture, all colors, all kinds and all creeds ; 
Don't frown on a 
man in a 
poor humble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds. 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger, 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now wave. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their grave. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and tried hard to wiu.. 
And should they be called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through 
Nritteu by W. H . 
DELAFINTY, and sung with great success at Hann 
M INER'S theatre, by Lemon:ix. and Ducnow. 
1Ve are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name , 
We used to gather Bucuh leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Heinbo:d came 
He paid us for the same. 
CHORUS. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu, 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name. 
Every night when work Is done, 
Day time, night timer always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Tottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We 
send them all below.

And I

I

My home and my relations, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I

I'se gwine back to Dixie; I'm gwine to Dixie; 
I'm going where the orange blossoms grows 
I

My heart's turned back to Dixie, and the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se travelling back to Dixie, 
My step is slow and feeble, 
I 
pray the Lord shall help me, 
And lead me from all evil. 
And if my strength forsakes me, 
My kind friends, come and take me; 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go.

The Music of this Song is published by SPEKR & DENHOFF, 
717 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh my name is Gilhooly Cornelius Gilh000ly, 
I 
live on the 1st Avenue; 
I'm a 
hard working man from the dear Irish land, 
With a 
heart that is honest and true: 
Every night just before I 
lay down to my rest, 
I 
call to my wife " ducky" dear; 
Run around to 'Maguire's, it's now I 
desire, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Cnonus: 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer; 
Whem I'm dry it will fill me with cheer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Then we sit down together and talk of the weather, 
And tell the events of the day; 
When the pitcher is empty, we fill it again, 
And in pleasure the night flies away; 
'The place where we live is a 
fine Irish flat, 
And our neighbors are full of good cheer: 
If you want to be happy, just come and imbibe, 
From the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
You may talk of your wines with their high sounding 
names, 
Whisky Punches and Hot Spicy Rum; 
But the Beer is the stuff, and it's quite good enotr ,h, 
For your Senses it can't overcome; 
If my friends call around, they'll have pleasure and 
fun, 
On a 
Christmas or happy New Year; 
We'll bring out Glass Goblets and off I 
will 
For the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer.

Softly the sunlight is dying, 
Down in the skies of the West, 
Gently the zephyrs are sighing, 
Singing the flowers to rest, 
Faintly the star light of heaven 
Shines o'er the cot in the lea, 
Where in the hush of the even 
Some one is waiting for me. 
CHORUS. 
Some one is waiting for me 
Close by the cot in the lea, 
In the sweet hour of twilight 
Some one is waiting for me. 
Ever sweet memory lingers 
Round that elysian of earth, 
Fair sunny face, dimpled fingers, 
Loved since the day of their birth, 
Gladly my footsteps will wander 
To that bright spot on the lea, 
Where in her beauty o'er yonder, 
Some one is waiting for me. 
CHORUS. 
Some one is waiting for me, 
Close by the cot in the lea, 
In the sweet hour of twilight, 
some one is waiting for me.

Sung by THE GREAT DUNBAR, the 
"

Jlave we a 
place no longer in your hearts, 
Since the dark river of Death we have crossed ; 
Wu/ not the unbidden tears sometimes start, 
As you recall us, the loved and the lost. 
Here, in our prison of silence and 
jlI gloom ; 
we number our life's Sunny noon; 
Whu you have laid us to rest in the tomb, 
At.e we forgotten, forgotten so soon ? 
Cnonus. 
When the grave receives its trust--
Earth to earth, and dust to dust--
Are we at once from your memory torn 
Are we forgotten so soon when we're gone? 
Think how we cherished and loved you on earth, 
Watched o'er your footsteps with tenderest care; 
Wept in your sorrow, rejoiced in your mirth— 
Welcome no pleasure which you did not share. 
Give us, again, our lost place in your heart; 
Reep the sweet chords of affection in tune, 
When for the realms of shadows we part; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
Cnonus. 
'When the last fond tie is broken— 
When the last farewell is spoken— 
Are we at once from your memory torn; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon?

My thoughts are wancl'ring back to-day 
On joyous scenes of yore, 
The merry girls and boys at play 
Around the cottage door; 
I 
see the mossy, winding wall, 
The meadow, brook and pool, 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
CHORUS. 
I 
see the mossy, winding wall, 
The meadow, brook and pool, 
But sweetest vision of them all 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut boughs, 
The youthful lovers, r.s they meet, 
Exchange the older vows; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see the mossy, &c. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee, 
The girlish voices that I 
hear, 
Renew sweet youth in me; 
I 
hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to school 
I 
see the mossy, 
Words and Music by PAT FEENey, and dedicated and sung by 
JOUN W ALsit, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
lie knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame us, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselves 
famous, 
With music arid poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their style; 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a

Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
He died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him away, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
Not a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave of a

Dar's a

But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
For dar's a

The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN COLLYER. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you, 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down :
11 the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? Why, she had a 
dozen—had ' em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers--none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He ;vac the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

KEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with gfeat 
s
uccess, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keel) it mum; 
lie tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to ateend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum,

SOUP SOUP 
Sung with immense success by the Original Shamrock Four, MATT 
DALY, DAVE CONROY, MIKE THOMPSON, JOHN DALY. 
When the soup house bells are ringing, 
It's then we will be happy and gay; 
And the tramps they'll all be singing, 
For they will get three meals a 
day; 
Oh, what a 
glorious time we'll have, 
All sitting in a 
group; 
Gathered around a 
pine-board table, 
A drinking turtle soup. 
CHORUS: 
Soup! Soup! Soup! 
Oh, the glorious soup is boiling, 
Oh, my, what a 
healthy smell; 
Arrah, says Pat, the soup is fat, 
Why we micks like it well; 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She kept company with an Alderman; 
Oh, when the glorious soup is boiling— 
Good-bye sweetheart, good-bye, 
It's then the tramps will be singing ha, ha, 
For this beats 
When the soup house bells stop ringing, 
It's then we will he tramps; 
We'll go out in this wide world, 
And try and raise a 
stamp; 
Travel, boys, from yard to yard, 
And clean out each chicken coop; 
You can bet your life we'll never want, 
For a 
good old bowl of soup. ( Chorus)

YOU MAY KISS AND CARESS ME. 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAM. 
Now I'm going to sing a 
little song, the tune you've heard 
before, 
'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a 
lean banana core, 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I 
asked her for her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
eironus: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no; 
Buy me a 
Tom and Jerry, a 
keg of beer or so, 
But don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la la lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss me you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say: 
CHORUS.: 
You may kiss me and caress me and I'll never say nix, 
Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll strike you with a 
brick; 
You may chew my alabaster ear, I'll never make a 
kick, 
But don't you tell my sister.

You'll Never Run the Engine Unless 
You have the Steam, 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with great success, throughout thy United 
States. 
There's many maxims in this world, 
And practice makes them true; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new; 
Man may be likened to a 
boat, 
Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep the fired a 
burning, boys, 
You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
If the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and dream, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
Makes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
Where all is dark at night. 
39 
YOU'LL NEVER RUN THE ENGINE UNLESS YOU 
HAVE THE STEAM. 
Continued. 
His wife lies dying on the straw, 
For bread his children scream, 
'Tis hard to run life's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main; 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land, 
But soon found out ' twould never fit 
That brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c.

Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play,. 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine.

For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more clear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oa I 
I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, &c. 
ANGELS MELT ME ON THE CROSS-ROAD"' 
A 
genuine Plantation Song and Melody. 
Sung characteristically, By T. 
M. 
HENGLER. 
I 
rise up early in the morn, 
I 
hear old Gabriel blow his horn; 
Make haste, darkies, don't you wait, 
'Caze you all may lose them keys to de gate. 
CHORUS. 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
I 
ain't given to charge any tole. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
What kind of shoes does the angels ware? 
Dat dey can walk around up in Heaven in de air, 
I 
stand by de gate, I 
hear de angels knock, 
And I 
put all de nickels in de missionary box. 
Angels, meet me, etek 
Farewell. 
The last tie is severed that bound me to the, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free; - 
I 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tett. 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over. I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy—ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yorg 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my heart, 
When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
W HEN you see a 
young couple late at night on the lake 
bank, chewing, biting, and eating each other, just let 'era 
alone. 
They are only fooling, 
A 
HUSBAND got angry with his wife and locked 'her up. 
At dinner time, to mortify her, he sent her a 
bone by his son. 
The little fellow knocked at the door, saying: " Mother, 
father says here is a 
bone for you to pick." " Tell him he's 
not your father, and there's a 
bone for him to pick."

When I'm dead and gone from you darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above; 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Cuoilus. 
Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance. 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thuncing of the days that Lave been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my 0;149 ke_it green.

Written exwessly for the AMERICAN FOUR by GEO. Woons.

Hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny—come alons with me. 
She was 8o fat and greasy she weighed about a 
ton, 
Did my hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johnston, (Break.) 
We courted her for many a 
long year, 
Until one day she acted rather queer. 
r:•he told us to git and walk upon our ear, 
Did my hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johwiton. 
Li, Jenny; ho, Jenny—come along with me, 
Hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny, you shall be free, 
'Free as a 
bee on a 
huckleberry tree, 
My hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johnston. 
We went next day when the weather it was fine, 
Hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny—come along with me, 
We treated her to cider, hoe cake and wine, 
Hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johnston, ( Break.) 
We took her to a 
ball, she slid around the floor, 
She up with her foot and slammed us in the jaw, 
Then there was a 
fight which busted up the ball, 
About hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johnston.

THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER 
As sung by GEO. THATCHER with great success. The greatest hit of 
the day. 
My song is of a 
beauty, 
She's a 
Chinese washer and fluter, 
She laid money much, 
And her dad was Dutch, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
On one stormy moonlight evening, 
For to meet her humble suitor, 
She slipped on a 
pie, 
Run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
Oh, now my story's ended, 
She married a 
French horn tooter; 
And she died very dead 
With a 
cold in her head, 
And the villain still pursued her.

MY GAL'S NAME. 
Banjo solo by J. JOHNSON for E. M. H ALL of Carncross' Minstrels 
with grsat success. 
Kind friends if you will wait, a 
story I'll relate, 
About a 
girl who is in love with me, 
She's as lovely as a 
lamb, but her head looks like a 
ham. 
Which has been boiled for one month and a 
day; 
And such a 
funny name would make a 
cat walk lame, 
To repeat it now for you I'm going to try; 
So listen without fear, and open wide your ears, 
For to lose this name would cause you all to cry. 
CHOU:C8: 
Oh, Philopena, Concertina, Algerina, Clementina, 
Maritina,, Flamitina, and sweet Matilda Jane; 
Josephina, Seraphina, Hannah Merina, Belvidina, 
Nota Bena, Big Casina, is my gal's name. 
Her form indeed is fine, from ridiculous to sublime, 
She's double-jointed in the heel and nose; 
Her appetite is grand, she ate up an apple stand, 
She's pigeoned and cross-eyed in both her toes. 
But it's to her name she charges all the blame, 
To change it now it worries her night and day; 
But a 
change to mine, I 
fear, is a 
thing that's not 
near 
To her imaginative powers as they seem. 
(Chorus). 
Now, she's in love, I 
fear, from her toes up to her ear, 
But I 
hope her love for me will soon give out; 
Such a 
name I 
cannot stand, it's the longest in the land, 
So my advice to her is change her route. 
Let her li ve out on the plains, and then she'll get some 
names 
To add to those which she has already got; 
Mine I'll keep myself, it's better for my health, 
For with all those names with mine would make it 
hot. 
(Chorus)

" 
DAN DORKINS." 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
As delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples' favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack wire clog, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch wa 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. [s e
mstt t, 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins cam' out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and " Yah, yah 1" 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
" 
He's away oil his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick! yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
A.nd continually dropping his cue. 
He says: " I'm a 
king!" when a 
woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Sandford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at home."

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mil2 upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, 1
-
vafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo 
they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With watet that has vst.

Massa's in the Cold Ground. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West's Minstrels, 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing _ 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old raassa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-field, &a. 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

THE HEART-FELT WISH OF MINE. 
Words and Music by JOHN WALsn, and sung by him only as a 
topical 
song, with immense success every place he appeared. 
The year of 1880 has gone now to decay, 
Another year from our lives has quickly passed away; 
But during its career many changes we have seen, 
And to many a 
poor man how eventful it has been; 
The truth of what I 
state, will appear now in my rhymes, 
For in them I 
mean to introduce some topics of the times; 
Plain talk alone I 
now will use, so listen to each line, 
And I'll name some things you all would like, ' tis the heart-
felt wish of mine. 
I 
really hope that it will never be my lot again, 
While strolling by the North River to see so many men 
With their faces pinched with hunger and shivering in the 
cold, 
Such a 
piteous sight has to me quite a 
tale of .misery told; 
The long- shore-men attend the stands, yes, morning, noon 
and night, 
In hopes for wives and families that they might earn a 
bite; 
But luck seems all against them, for bread their children 
pine, 
1 
trust they_may see better days, 'tis the heart-felt wish of 
mine. 
A 
glorious brightness has across the Emerald Isle been cast 
Fortune long in coming, seems to smile on her at last; 
English persecution now, I 
think is nearly done. 
Their long, long race of tyranny I 
think is nearly run; 
Too long has Erin slumbered ' neath Saxon's cruel spell, 
Thank God, she's now awakened at the call of brave Parnell 
Rise, rise, ye true born Irishmen, with a 
firm and resolute 
mind, 
To have our brethren set free, 'tis the heart-felt wish of mine

Great Grandma Sarah J
ane. 
Written by James Richmond and sung by Billy Barry, 
with great success. 
AIR—Fire in the Grate. 
Grandma has tendered her resignation, 
From this wicked world of sin; 
She packed her valise and departed, 
It contained a 
pack of cigarettes and sotne nigger gin, 
She left her false teeth to Cousin Minnie, 
She gave pa the price of a 
shave, 
They put Dennis Kearney's picture on her tombstone, 
To keep the crows from off her grave. 
CHORUS— 
Her mind was always mashing, 
She was too fresh and awful shrewd; 
She weighed ninety pounds when in fighting condition, 
And she never smoked or chewed. 
She used to go fishing with Christopher Columbus; 
And shooting shadows till she went insane, 
For a 
curicAity she took the prize, 
My great grandma, Sarah Jane. 
She tried to sing bass and swallowed her teeth, 
Her lungs from eating snuff were sore; 
She was so bashful if there was a 
man in her room, 
She'd get up and shut the door. 
She willed her voice to her uncle's nephew, 
When she died she was one hundred and eighty-seven, 
They say she is cook in a 
five-cent restaurant, 
Four miles and a 
half from Heaven. 
Her mind was always, etc.

KEEP ON KISSING ME

Music copyrighted 1878, and published by F. BLUME, 861 
Broadway, New York. 
Price 35 3ents. 
Well there, now I id you ever ? 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold 
Because when men come courting, 
I'm ot reserv'd or cold. 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry ? 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no I 
I'm sure you would rather I'd say 
Cnonus. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Once more only love to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er tho't men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay. 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.—But I've made up my mind that when the right one 
comes along, I'll say — 
Keep on kissing me, etc. 
I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said, 
But truly, from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed. 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, yes, I 
tell you, these giddy girls who keep 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever were 
caught!" they forget that sometimes they lose their bait. 
Not 
or me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying — 
Keep on kissing me, etc.

WHAT legl ns cf friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh! if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down? 
CHORUS. 
So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow may fall unto you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down! 
What if, when you had not a 
sorrow 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they want.d to borrow 
You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a 
friend you ne'er slighted 
You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down. 
CHORUS.—S0

Then give me the heart that for ever 
Is free from the world's selfish rust, 
And the soul whose high, noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men from the dust. 
And when in alversity's ocean, 
A 
victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift up a 
man when he's down!

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HUMPH DLIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by alt 
the Professors of Magic. 
""•9%/1""A""~i 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept-
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orde 
has been sent us, called HumPry DUAIPTY, and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin..4
