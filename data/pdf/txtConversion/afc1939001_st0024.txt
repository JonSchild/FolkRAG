SUGAR LUMP
All around this ring we go, all around my sugar lump, Some body's rocking my sugar lump,
Som body's rocking my sugar lump O turn cinamon turn.
That blue eyed girl is my sugar lump — That blue eyed girl is my sugar lump — O Turn
cinamon turn.
I wouldn't take a dollar for my sugar lump — Its worth five cents to my sugar lump — I
wouldn't give a nickle for my sugar lump —
