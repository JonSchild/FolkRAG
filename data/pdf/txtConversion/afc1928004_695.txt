Mister McHugh. 
Sole property of Harry Melville, sung by him with great 
success through Europe and America. 
I'm a 
man of the world you can easily see, 
And a 
favorite I 
am with the girls; 
I 
make as much havoc among their young hearts, 
As a 
hair-dresser does with their curls. 
It's myself that knows how ,o 
delude the fair, 
Which I 
do in an artistic way, 
That has made me quite famous, for now every one 
That I 
meet will be certain to say. 
Cuouus. 
Arrah, Mr. McHugh, Mister McHugh, 
All the young ladies are dying for you, 
I 
can't make it out, but for all that, it's true, 
Every one says you're a 
darling. 
With the blarney that lives on an Irishman's tongue, 
I 
so n 
become friends of them all; 
And the la-de-da toffs with their eye-glass and cuffs, 
I 
very soon drive to the wall. 
The 1.1dies declare that my brogue is as sweet, 
As the voice of the thrush or the lark, - 
It makes me feel proud of the name I 
have won, 
When I 
hear u 
ery lady remark. 
Chorus. 
&ire, it's Mr. McHugh, arrah how do you do, 
No matter wherever I 
go; 
They trate me just like any lord in the land, 
To invitations I 
never say no. 
I'm constantly dining at t 
Is place and that, 
And what's better I've nothing to pay, 
I 
court all their daughters just as a 
return, 
For the purpore of hearing. them say.

My Father. 
By J. F. Mitchell. 
Sole property of Hrrry Melqine. 
Sung with success by him through Europe and America. 
'Stead of having a 
father to look after me, 
I 
assure you it's quite the reverse; 
N. For I 
have a 
dad, : aid the older he grows, 
Ton my conscience his morals get worse. 
He goes out on the loose end he follows the girls, 
And comes at the breaking of day, 
And if I 
advise him to give up his tricks, 
He turns round to me and he'll say. 
CHORUS. 
Arndt, why don't you be like your father, 
Why don't you be like your dad, 
Why don't you go and enjoy yourself, 
While there's a 
chance to be had. 
Look at the charming girls I 
get, 
Altho' I 
am sixty-three, 
Go pinck up your courage, you son of a 
gun, 
And go for a 
jolly good spree. 
For a 
good half an hour he will stand at the glass, 
, 
i 
/ 
,, 
Tiltetating his whiskers and hair; 
i 
With his hat at the angle of fifty degrees, 
His appearance is devil.iimy-care. 
Ile says my gossoon, you're too slow to get on, 
. ( 
So come out for the evening with me, 
' 
S' Take stock of your father and you'll make a 
man, 
1 
, 
If you'll take a 
lesson from me. 
Chorus. 
Pon my soul, it's enough to drive any son wild, 
With the way the old man carries on, 
For a 
couple of bobbys sometimes march him home, 
At the respect he hour of one 
We can't keep a 
srvant for more than a 
week, 
Till he starts with his:tricks and hie larks, 
And I 
daren't for the life f 
me check him because, 
Re turns around to me and remarks: 
Chorus. 
Some May Love the Land of 
the Thistle. 
Sung by Mss Nellie Farrell throughout Europe. 
Also by Harry Melville through the principal cities of America. 
There's an island that's famed, for in story, 
Sweet poets have sung in its praise; 
It's verses have no 'brighter glory, 
Her sons have seen brighter days. 
['hough an Irishman roams the world over, 
No matter where e'er he may be, 
He ne'er can forget dear old Erin, 
The Emerald gem of the sea. 
Cuomus. 
Moine may love the land of the thistle, 
And other's the wild white rose, 
Bra my heart's away in Ireland, 
Where the dear sweet shamrock grows. 
er boy! they are brave and warm-hoartsd, 
Her daughters are witty and true; 
In passing the time of hard trouble, 
Oive the children of Erin her due, 
Her boys in the ranks of our soldi , 
nave helped many a 
victory to gain, 
They ne'er turned their back on the foemen, 
They'd s/+oner be toned rnongst the slain, 
elesras.. 
Erin Mavourneen. 
Sung with SUCcOSS by Ill try AfelvIlloDuteltn's Geni e 
Erin Mavourneen, thy glorious fame, 
Is re-echoed from pole unto pole; 
An Irishman loves the dear sound of thy name. 
if there is but one spark in his soul. 
Of the bright tire that burns in the old Celtic race, 
Who's laud is a 
speck on the wave, 
The name was never coupled with blot or disgrace, 
The land that De'er nurtured a 
slave, 
CLIOAUS. 
'Tis a 
speck on the ocean, the home of the free, 
The home of the homeless, for ever 'twill be, 
A 
haven of rest in the midst of the sea, 
Erin INIavournean, .4.cusbla Machree. 
I 
admit that my race is hot-blooded'and rash, 
They reason just after a 
blow; 
But still in their nature you'll not find a 
clash, 
Of ought that's selfis't or low. 
To the stranger in trouble the Irishman's hand, 
Held out in assistance is seen, 
What people more noble or loving or grand, 
Than those from the Island of green. 
Chorus. 
When united the Gael and the Saxon defies, 
And cares not a 
pin for the world; 
What laurels they won beneath far foreign climes, 
When the harp and the crown were unfurled. 
In unity clinging, oh ! long may we see, 
The dear little shamrock and rose, 
The emblem of union and -beauty shall be, 
The wonder and terror of foes. 
Chorus, 
THE BOAT IS - URNINO OVER. 
The Boat is Turriing Over. 
CONTINUED 
Written amt sung wait tremendous success by the cote-
bratodt'cmedian, A.r. Fred Rob rts. 
It happened one afternoon, 
'Twas in the month of May; 
While walking with a 
pretty girl, 
I 
thus to her did say; 
Now will you go out for a 
row, 
The river to explore. 
She said she would, ' twould do her good, 
As she'd not been there before. 
Spoken.—And like a 
fool I 
hired a boat, but, di-
rectly we got on the water, she made a 
grab at me and 
said— 
CROEC8. 
Oh! Fred, the boat is turning over, 
Oh ! Fred ! you naughty man, she cried; 
Oh ! Fred, I 
wish I'd thrown her over, 
Ere I 
ever took her up the river for a 
ride. 
pulled away with all my might, 
But we had not gone far, 
Before that girl began to scream, 
And said she'd tell her ma. 
And as these words escaped her lips, 
A 
steamer came close by, 
Which caused our boat to pitch and toss, 
v.d liar again to cry— 
Chorus. 
1 
felt uneasy in my mind, 
I 
scarce knew what to do; 
I 
thought that girl would die of fright, 
And so would all of you. 
She said, dear Fred, oh ! take me home, 
Here I 
cannot remain; 
And then there came another wave, 
Which made her shout again. 
Spoken.— Shout. " Well I 
should obliterate, to pro-
crastinate, shout." flat was il ,:name for it just imagine 
the horrible possition I 
was in, with my hands ongaged 
with the two sculls of the-
oat, and the one skull of an 
agitated and sea-sick young lady reclining on my manly 
chest, and nc chance for one to.obtain even a platonic 
hug without risking a 
cold water bath.-- She said, oh 
my, what would mainam.sely if she knew I 
was al, alone 
on these turbulent and tumultuous billows. 
I 
thought 
that was pretty good for a 
girl that wasn't feeling well, 
so I 
fired her into the bottom of the boat, and made all 
steam for hind, and every time I 
felt inclined to weaken 
on the 13 roke, I 
heard a 
small puny voice that said—

Sole property of Harry meivit, 
Sung by him with big success throughout Great Britain, Ireland, 
also America. 
I 
was once a 
railway porter, and 
My name i 
Jack Magee;

All the rest was on the spree. 
My money I

The interest got strong, 
And now I

A splendid restaurant.

Smoke a 
pipe or sing a 
song, 
And get as drunk as bacchus 
in my new restaurong. 
Now my watch and chain is solid gold, 
The stamp is twenty-two; 
And everybody says that I'm 
A

The devil's heavy swell, 
The people say there's John Magee, 
That keeps the big hotel,

JUST for a

To the seaside out of town, 
To battle each morning in the surf

While strolling there on one fine dv

Now don't you think soq 
Everybody tays so, 
And of course we say the same. 
Then arm in arm along the beach 
For hours we did roam.

As we rtiurned towards home. 
He begged to see me to my door. 
I 
answered " No, my dear, 
But to- night at seven, if you'll wait, 
I'll meet you on the pier."

We met that night and then I 
found 
How dearly he loved me; 
Amd. now I'm soon to be his wife, 
How happy I 
will be.

Don't be so timid, Miss, 
And now my little darlinff please

Sweet maiden, that tore us apart; 
Sadly I 
watch for you, early and late, 
Come back to me, star of my heart;

Faithful and true to your memory I've been, 
Oh come back .sweet Eileen to me. 
NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU! 
As Sung ly; ALICE MIIBBAY, in their Sketch nrry's Refurn. 
Sweetly?, the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn ; 
Sad is the moon, though in radiance beaming, 
She is dreaming, alone and forlorn ; 
Roses and lilies, so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew; 
So, when afar you are thoughtlesly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true? 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment, 
While Norah, your Norah, is dreaming of you. 
Tho' you forget me, when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling, alone ? 
Come to my heart, like a 
bird that is weary, 
0 
come to your Norah so true; 
Linger not long, for the days they are dreary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true ; 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment only, 
Far Norah, your Norah. is dreaming of you. 
Dear Little Innocent Things. 
Sung by the Great E 
glisit Swell Singer and Artistic Comique 
Fred T. Roberts, at the Academy of Music, Chicago, Ill, 
with great success. 
Woman, lovely woman, 
Was sent to us for this, 
To cheer our life, to be a 
wife, 
To fondle and to kiss. 
For some of them are beautiful, 
And oft our hearts entrance; 
And others are a 
different kind, 
So you must take the chance. 
Spoken.—Early in life I 
adored the sex, and I 
used to 
say— 
CA013113.1 
Oh 1 
they're dear little innocent things, they are, 
They're angels without any wings, they are, 
My love is so hot, I 
could kiss the whole lot 
Of the dear little innocent things--What things? 
The wedding over, we enjoy 
The ,• 41oriotts honeymoon, 
In blissful skies the clouds arise, 
We weary of it soon. 
For ills begin, and bills come in— 
A. thousand dollars clear, 
Your wife will say, 
Do kiss me pray. 
You know I 
am so dear." 
DEAR L 
ITTLE INNuCEN'1' THINGS, 
CONTINUED. 
Spoken.—Dear! Well I 
should say they are dear, But 
ihey're a 
sort of necessary evil, and it's best to smile and 
say— ! 
the dear little, etc. 
You'll often wonde how it is 
I 
know so much, though young; 
We'll you see my wife's a 
woman, 
And she's got her share of tongue. 
Before she wed she loo..ed as though 
She could not hurt a 
fly, 
But the other day I 
saw a 
sight 
That nearly made me sigh. 
Spoken.—I 
got home from business an hour or two 
earlier than usual. 
I tried to get in the parlor, but the 
door was locked. 
I 
knocked, and after pounding about five 
minutes I 
was let in. 
I 
thought that I 
saw something that 
looked like a 
coat-tail dissapper at the back parlor. I 
asked, 
Who was here ?" 
She said a 
lady friend, 
I 
went over to 
the mantle piece and picked up a lighted cigar. 
Says I, 
"‘ DD 
your lady friends smoke?" 
She - then began to cry, 
and now I 
say— 
What dear little innocent things they are, 
They're devils without any horns they are, 
If I 
was hung on th spot I 
could shoot the whole lot 
Of the dear little innocent things—What things? 
Insult it, " Who Dare." 
THE GREAT PATRIOTIC SONG 
Written and sung with success by Fred Roberts. 
America, 'tis of thy glories I 
sing, 
Let the cannon belch forth, and joyous bells ring, 
May each patriot join in the strength of my voice, 
And each heart in its freedom and power rejoice. 
George Washington rescued the land we adore, 
From the hand of the tyrant, brought peace to 
our shore, 
And its riches and beauty, its greatness and power, 
Outstrip all the world and are growing each hour. 
Cnortus. 
Our watchword is honor, our pride is our land, 
Our flag once unfurled, who its power can withstand, 
When freedom demands its protection and care, 
Our rifles are ready, insult it, " who dare." 
We care not for conquest, a 
world is our own, 
Which the splendors of Europe has never outshone, 
We ask but for peace, still we know how to fight, 
And bleed o'er again for our country mid right, 
For the Stars and Stripes, for the land of the free, 
Our soldiers and sailors, by land and on sea, 
Hand to hand in the contea would tight to the death. 
And cry Hail Columbia with their last breath. 
Chorus, 
Come Back to Your Irish Home. 
By Chas. Dockstader, expretsely for Flora Moore and sung 
by her with great sueeess. 
There's a 
garden spot on earth, to me, 
'Tis the sweetest place I've seen; 
Where childhood s 
happy moments passed-
see it in my dreams. 
But I 
left it, and •I 
came to roam, 
'Twas hard to say good-bye; 
Ofttimes I 
fancy I 
can hear 
My poor old mother cry. 
Cuoune. 
Come back, come back, 
Come back to your Irish honsa, 
Then come back I 
come back 
Come back, Kate, och hone. 
I've been away one year to-day, 
And my heart feels lonely -yet; 
°Mimes they write and seem to fear, 
That I 
will soon forget. 
But I 
can't forget where'er I 
roam.. 
No matter how I ..y, 
And In my !dem 1

Erin Green Isle. 
Words and Music by Edward Haley, and sung by the Mir 
pliys, Paddy and Ella, in all the principal Theatres in 
the United States. 
There's a 
dear spot of land far out in the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle, 
Sure it's there I 
was born one bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother 
Were pleased, to be sure, all the while ; 
And they shed tears of joy for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk of Old England, of France and of Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and great men, 
But the whole world cloth know that fair Erin can show 
Nobler sons, fairer daughters than them. 
I 
can mention such names as O'Connel aild Moore, 
And the brave Duke of NV ellington, while 
King Brian Borhue, and brave Emmet, too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's green isle. 
The Lakes of Killarney, on Erin's green isle, 
Are lovely, enchanting and fine. 
Our mountains and va.leys are second to none ; 
Their beauty is really sublime. 
There the shamrock doth grow in plenty, you know, 
Encouraged by nature's sweet smile. 
Dear land of my birth ; garden spot of the earth— 
You're my idol, fair Erin's green isle.

There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did M012111, 
And my aged old mother said, be a 
good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were pool% 
Now, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she Geld? 
A.rtd the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters, sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never tear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll livel.yco, although we be poor. 
Home Again. 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAICE. 
We're an Irish pair and we just landed, 
We came across the deep blue sea, 
And now we're here we're going to tell you 
'What we will do in America. 
We'll sing a 
dance like many others, 
Let troubles come, go where we may, 
We'll borrow none, our hearts are cheerful ; 
We're always gay on St. Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We'll go home again, we'll go home again, 
So farewell friends, we'll go home again. (Repeat.) 
So now kind friends we're going to leave you, 
We're going back where we were born— 
That dear old spot that we call Ireland, 
The climate there is always warm. 
When we get there, kind friends will greet us 
With loving hearts and welcome hands, 
So farewell friends, we now must leave you, 
We're going back to old Ireland. 
We'll go home again, &c.

IELDING& 
WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, ani saw it was good: 
The Emerald oi Europe, h sparkled and shone, 
In the ring el the worW, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, in bet soil, in her station thrice West, 
With her baa- townel llrituin, and her ' ace to the West; 
Erin stands proudly 
on ller steep shore, 
And strikes he high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that as(eeel from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus lee, to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons, like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die, 
Alas! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them tie' t 
mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to stril:e, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance preseme to defile, 
The cause of, or man oh the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, met the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue 
And the triumphs 
Erie her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms ;leave Ide:h for the worthy and brave, 
But no cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise arch of the Ocean, and rine 
of the West. 
YOU'VE BEEN A 
FRIEND TO ME. 
Sung by JOHN 114PACII. 
MY bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when outh was in its prime ; 
My days of darkness turn-d 
to light, my sorrow d 
heart wai 
free, 
Oh since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend to 
me. 
CHORUS. 
I'll ne'er forget where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be 
If ever I 
had a 
friend, 
You've been a 
frieud to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been f,r you ; 
Kind word were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me. 
I'll ne'erforget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the cloudt 
of strife, 
And threw the4- rays of sunshine down my weary path of life ; 
I 
now look back upon the p 
st, along life's stormy sea, 
smile to think 'mid all life's scenes, you've been a 
friend to me 
ne'er forget, etc.

TEE SPORTING MAN. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT expressly for JAMES O'NEIL, of O'NEIE, 
CONROY, Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists, 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not done it yet; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim; 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
fight; 
A Dutchman, a 
Scotchman, a 
Frenchman and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly get plugged with a 
brick. 
CHORUS: 
Nobody knows what trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry jumped up, struck out with his band, 
And swore he could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John Monahan standing in the door, 
He caught hold of McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
He went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
He looked as if he slept with the pigs all night; 
He looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
And then he flew for Monahan and chewed off his ear; 
He made one brace and landed at the bar, 
He called for a 
hvmmer, and they gave hi-m a 
cigar; 
He took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
It was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set fire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all came down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every hghting gossoon; 
Six months on the Island sure they all have to stay. 
For setting fire to the house on S. Patrick's Day,

THE FINE IRISH GENTS. 
It's a 
shame on the stage, how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me, 
flow the people in front, will stand such insult; 
Receiving such blockheads with glee. 
If they went to old Ireland they'd find their mistake, 
For our boys and our girls are well dressed, 
In manners as well to you I 
will tell, 
For they stand in the land with the best. 
Cnonus. 
For in singing, and dancing and all kinds of sport, 
And if ever to Ireland you went, 
From their heads to their toes, they all wear decent clothes, 
I 
speak of a 
true Irish gent. 
Sure they make up their faces, and look just like fools, 
And they walk like a 
dog with three legs, 
If they went to old Ireland, to ' how them such sport, 
They'd be pelted with stones and bad eggs; 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen too. 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope for to see, that little Isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue.

DONNELLY AND COOPER 
Written by Dick Devlin and sung by Devlin and Tracy 
Come all you true-bred Irishmen, I 
hope you will dray, 
near, 
And likewise pay attention to those few lines you hear ; 
It's of as true a 
story as ever you did hear, 
It's about Donnelly and Cooper, that fought all on Kildare. 
'Twas on the 3d of June, brave boys this challenge sent 
o'er. 
From Brittania to old Grauna to renew her sons once more; 
To renew her satisfaction, and her credit to recall, 
For they're all in deep distraction since Donnelly con-
quered all. 
Old Grauna read .the challenge and received and she 
smiled, 
Saying; " You'd better hasten to Kildare, my well beloved 
child, 
There you will reign victorious, which you often did before. 
And your deeds will shine so gloriously around old Erin's 
shore." 
The challenge W115 accepted; these heroes did prepare 
To meet brave Captain Kelly on the Curragh of Kildare; 
When these two bully champions were stripped off in the 
ring, 
They both were still determined on each other's blood to 
spill. 
DONNELLY AND COOPEg.—Continued. 
From 6 
to 9, parried their time, till Donnelly knocked him 
down, 
Old Grauna smiled; " Well done, my child; that is ten 
thousand pound!" 
The second round that Cooper fought, he knocked dawn 
Donnelly, 
Likewise true game was Donnelly, he rose most furiously. 
Right active then v4as Cooper—he knocked Donnelly 
down again; 
Those Englishmen then gave three cheers, saying. " The 
battle's ail in vain." 
Long life to brave Miss Kelly; she's recorded on the plain; 
She boldly stepped into the ring, saying: " Dan, my boy, 
what do you mane ? 
''My Irish boy," said she, " my whole estate I 
have bet 
out on you, brave Donnelly." 
Donnelly rose again, and meeting with great might, 
And to stagnate those nobles all, continued to his fight, 
Cooper stood in his own defence; exertion proved in vain, 
He soon received a 
temple blow that knocked him on the 
plain. 
Now you sons of proud Brittania, your boasting now recall. 
Since Cooper, now, by Donnelly, he met a 
sad downfall, 
Out of eleven rounds gave nine knock-downs and broke 
his jaw-bone; 
Shake hands," said she. " brave Donnelly, the battle's an 
our own."

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Bung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The fath2r and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yondrr mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see.

'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I

And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I

Thy precious soul 
keep. 
The fi-herman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind NV:iS howling wild; 
Then be spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
lie cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead.

And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about,

Their faces were calm, their bands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life 11:1(1 clasped his child, 
In death they found him there.

In the house where I

On summer nights to cheer ourselves, 
All pleasures we have tried; 
But on the roof 
best of all, 
To hear us would be proof; 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together, 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo; 
The Murphys and O'Neiis come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up conies Mistress lloolahan, 
With the baby in her arms; 
With pleasant conver,ation then, 
Sure every one she charms; 
There's Rosy Dunn and Itqley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud they join the crowd, 
All sin ring on the roof. ( Chorus). 
Youne, Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a

"Come Av. It the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
"It's like a

Sure, none could hol I

It was a

To see them on the roof. (Chorus) 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pl asan, breeze; 
Take up your pip , and stretch yourself, 
In an attitude of eAse;

She would often speak to me of days of yore;

THE IRISH INVITATION.

GOOD-EVioriNG, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
oell, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning, 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed is 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen, 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen, 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHontra. 
We will dance (sym.), and we will sing (syrn.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation, 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, we will have a 
keg of ale, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me? 
Then I 
will drive away all care and aggravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have some fun, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you I'll relate; 
Dame Fortune upon me is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadnet,s is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ereast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw; 
It's simply because, like a 
fool, I 
got married, 
And I've got a 
bad case of a " mother-in-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration, 
And her presence completely fills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
flow. 
often I've envied our first father—Adam— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
n 
exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarsh, " Your wife would most surely be jealous, 
If she could but see us;" I 
answered, " Oh, shaw !" 
When the door was burst open, and there stood before us 
That horrid old monster, my mother-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and I 
soundly rated, 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course, 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running, 
So my wife firmly vows site will have a 
divorce. 
Now our "Crack Rifle Team" does some mighty fine shooting, 
The result of each match is always a 
draw; 
I'll give any good marksman seven dollars and a 
half

For my stomach and pockets they are empty,

My clothes are all ragged and coarse,

Where has my suit of broadcloth gone to 
And my handsome watch and chain I

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by WILL. Mossoit, 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really WWI my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances co ace 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
' 
fat,tied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
nice that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grastil 
It's very different Just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look brigh 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet king heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the betilet girl so fair, who goes floating through the ate, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts; of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are swam 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home tin privacy, 
A 
very difierent state of iiiings you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame; 
itIet be that as It way, who nails( 3 
all the fray, 
Their quarreling conCuties just the s . 
And oft they try to hide front all the woca. out.4‘e, 
The snarls and jars with which their hotibeLold tome 
And often when you hear them call ea;:h other dear, 
They hate each other just l.tettintl the seenea. 
Now ita just the sem,: in life, to.otAgh what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folko will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make tile 
selves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppos-, that those who wear -food clothes, 
Always are they richest awl the hest ; 
But an honest heart awl mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then to matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry 
la kings or queens, 
YvhateNer we enjoy, t

If we Aould only peep behind the t3cnies.

BRANNIGAN' NIP. 
sung by JAM ‘ O'NEIL and Jags CONFIOY with groat 
Now old Mickey Braimigan had a 
bull pup, 
He was bred of rale elegant stock; 
For seventeen hours a 
battle he fought, 
lie did, by my soul, by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged and two crooked eyes; 
One look at his ugly looking mug was enough, 
lie was the divil himself in disguise. 
Cuonus: 
Bow-ow-ow, what a 
pup to be sure. 
For fighting he'd never give up; 
There never was known such a 
wonderful dog 
As Mickey Brannigan's pup. 
He tore the tail off Maloney's be=4 coat, 
Ate the bustle of Mary Ann Flynn; 
And run between young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin. 
He caught up the Dutch slu.)ernaki.x's dog, 
And shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered Tim Finnegan's beautiful goat, 
Ate the tail off McManus' cat. 
Bow-ow- ow, 
An Italian came round -with an organ one day', 
And a 
monkey tied fast to a 
string; 
And when the pup saw them he yowled with delight, 
And made a 
most wonderful spring. 
He upset monkey, grinder and all,. 
And bursted the organ inside; 
And be jahers ho triod to swallow the monk, 
But Ve eltol4c.id on I

Music by H. Bora.m.sw. 
Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea ; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain ; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
CHORUS. 
Birdie, Pirdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it cu his bosom bare ; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts WjO bc th so free. 
When he pledged his hie forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, Jr.e. 
Let him think how once be falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he asli'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sign .; 
are now, bless you, birdie, bless yolk 
falif,Ctqf liaesaage through the sky, 
Birdie, birdie, ate.
