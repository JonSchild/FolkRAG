 Federal agency advised by t

National Council on t

t
 
As many of you may already know,  Bess Hawes will soon retire
 
after 15 years as head of the Folk Arts Program.
 Her commitment
 
and passion for the traditional arts have been evident from her
 
first days here,  and she has served the agency and the field with -
distinction.
 She leaves in place a vital support network,
 
particularly with the state arts agency folk art apprenticeships,
 
and the highly respected and much cherished National Heritage
 
Awards.
 Traditional artists all over America are in her debt.
 
In addition to her professional success,  she has earned the
 
admiration and affection of her colleagues in the field,  and I
 
know that her friends are many here.
 Bess has been a steadfast
 
presence around this place for 15 years,  and her dedication to
 
the traditional arts she loves symbolizes the spirit that moves
 
us all in our service to the public and the arts.
 We will miss
 
her,  and I know that all of you will want to wish her a fond
 
farewell.
 
I am appointing Dan Sheehy,  long-time assistant director,  to the
 
position of Director of the Folk Arts Program.
 Dan has been with
 
the Endowment since 1978,  and he has served as Assistant Director
 
of the Folk Arts Program for the past 10 years.
 Before coming
 
here,  he worked with the Smithsonian Institution,  and over the
 
years,  he has remained active both as a performer and as
 
presenter at the annual Festival of American Folklife.
 He brings
 
to the position a background as a musician,  teacher,  and training
 
as an ethnomusicologist.
 With his understanding and appreciation
 
of the traditional arts and his wide range of experience,  Dan is
 
the logical choice for the position,  and I know that you will
 
want to pass along your congratulations to him.
 I am always
 
pleased when I am able to select someone who has risen through
 
the ranks as Director for a program.
 
Bess approves,  too.

Chairman
 
I look at your retirement with mixed feelings - I hate to
 
see you leave NEA Folk Arts,  yet I know you will still be
 
involved with folk arts in many other ways.
 Knowing of your
 
love for the Pacific area,  I hope you will be able to spend
 
some time in our part of the world.
 
You have been my mentor during my past six years as a public
 
sector folklorist.
 You have guided my decisions more than
 
you know.
 When faced with a problem,  I often asked myself,
 
"What would Bess do?",  and acted accordingly.
 I'm still
 
going to use that successful formula,  but every now and then
 
I'm going to need a dose of personal "Bess Hawes common
 
sense".
 I hope to always remain in close communication with
 
you.
 You always have a place to stay on the Island of Guam
 
if your projects and travels should take you our way.
 Keep
 
in touch!
 
Love,
 
Commonwealth Now!

Director,  Folk Arts Program

Dear Bess:
 
In my twenty years in the public sector arts business
 
I don't
 know of anyone who has had a greater impact on this
 
country's
 cultural landscape than you.
 You have moved the
 
cause of folk arts  forward through the best and worst of
 
times and have masterfully orchestrated support for folk
 
artists and folk culture in every region of America.
 The
 
admiration felt for you bridges a spectrum of personalities.
 
From a Dewey President William to a Congressman Sydney Yates
 
your name is held in the highest regard.
 
I have personally and professionally learned much from
 
your quiet counsel,  sensitive way with people,  and forthright
 
style of persuasion.
 Your leadership in government has been
 
unique and a model  for us all.
 The numerous examples of
 
support,  guidance and most of all friendship you have extended
 
to me over the Florida,  Louisiana and Alabama years are pleasant
 
memories of a valued friendship.
 
Your fifteen years at the Endowment have been nothing
 
short of remarkable.  In the interest of folk arts you have
 
stayed the course, weathered the storms and moved a cumbersome
 
ship forward in a positive and proper direction.
 The success
 
you have achieved in dealing with the cone-head bureaucrats
 
while at the same time maintaining a warm un-government like
 
approach to your extended family in the field has been an
 
amazing accomplishment.
 You have given a different texture
 
and meaning to the term government support.
 As they say
 
in Alabama you are a "fresh green breeze."
 Those who care
 
about folk arts are thankful for the legacy you leave behind.

As you depart from your position at the Endowment please
 
know you will be missed but never forgotten.
 You can now
 
move to a slightly different sphere of involvement that I
 
know will be welcome and rewarding.
 We are still counting
 
on continued visits to Alabama and good doses of advice when
 
needed.
 
Above all be assured you have made a difference with
 
individuals like me and with states throughout the country.
 
I am a better and wiser person from having been in your company.
 
My fondest wishes will always be with you.

a Bess Hawes, a r
esident of Tower
 
Villas s
ince 1976, r
ecently r
etired
 
after 15 years as director of the
 
Folk Arts Program of the National
 
Endowment for the Arts.  Following is
 
an edited version of the story by
 
Eric Brace that appeared in the Style
 
Section of The Washington Post on
 
Feb. 16, 1992, commemorating her ac-
complishments in the folk art f
ield.
 
+ Bess Lomax Hawes has spent prac-
t
ically her whole l
ife immersed in
 
folk lore — music and dancing, s
ing-
ing and stories, costumes and carv-
ings.  She was born into the r
ight
 
family in the f
irst place.  Her fath-
er was folk song collector, John
 
Lomax, who taught his children to ap-
preciate the works of ordinary
 
people.  "Father focused on the
 
authentic," says her brother, Alan.
 
"Authenticity was the focus for all
 
of us.!'

+ Bess r
ecalls her childhood years
 
in Dallas as a "
romantic" family
 
l
ife.  "We'd go on picnics, eat fried
 
chicken and watermellon, swim in the
 
springs, and then s
ing all the way
 
home.  We were always s
inging.
 
Mother sang beautifully, but father
 
was just a good s
inger."
 
+ Her mother taught her the songs
 
of her family from Virginia and the
 
Carolinas, and by helping her father
 
and brother with their 1938 book,
 
"Our Singing Country," Bess' enthusi-
asm grew.  After graduating from Bryn
 
Mawr, she went to work in the music
 
division of the New York Public Lib-
rary.  Here, she was in contact with
 
Pete Seeger, who had also worked on
 
"Our Singing Country," and who was
 
then spearheading a folk r
evival in
 
New York.

+  "
I was asked to join the Almanac
 
Singers full t
ime," Bess said.
 
"Others in the group included Pete
 
Seeger, Lee Hayes, Pete Hawes,
 
Millard Lampell, Woodie Guthrie, and
 
it was then I met my husband Butch,
 
Pete Hawes' brother, who was s
inging
 
with us then.  We would have s
inging
 
parties or hootennanies on Sunday
 
afternoons.  Leadbelly would come
 
occasionally; Burl Ives would come;
 
Josh White would come; but they
 
didn't perform with us on a r
egular
 
basis -- they had bigger f
ish to
 
fry."
 
+ She and her husband moved to
 
California where three children were
 
born.  In s
inging to them, Bess found
 
her r
eal calling — teaching people
 
to s
ing and play the guitar.  "
I
 
began playing guitar and s
inging in
 
nurseries which gradually evolved
 
into more teaching.  I knew a lot of
 
good songs and I could get people to
 
s
ing, so they came to my classes and
 
we'd have a wonderful t
ime all even-
ing.  That was about the s
ize of it."
 
+ But the scope of her teaching
 
was somewhat larger, her brother Alan
 
says.  "
She taught the whole state of
 
California to s
ing and play guitar.
 
She developed a way to teach 70 or 80
 
people at a t
ime."
 
+ Bess and her s
ister, Shirley
 
Duggan, often travelled together.
 
Once, while visiting an island off
 
Panama, they were given a traditional
 
welcome, the ladies all l
ined up to
 
s
ing their song of greeting, and Bess
 
sat down and wrote out the music as
 
they were s
inging.
 
+ Bess' daughter, Naomi Bishop,
 
says people still come to her, all
 
MAR/APR 1992
 
these years later, saying, "You're
 
Bess Hawes' daughter?  She taught me
 
how to play guitar," or "
She taught
 
me how to s
ing."  But Naomi recalls
 
that she herself went through periods
 
of absolute mortification that she
 
had a mother who played the banjo.
 
The guitar was f
ine, so was the
 
mandolin, but the banjo?  No one's
 
mother played the banjo!"
 
+  "Our l
ife didn't seem extraordi-
nary," says son Nick Hawes.  "There
 
was nothing to which we could compare
 
it.  People ask me how I know so many
 
songs; I know songs the way k
ids
 
today know what happens to Bert and
 
Ernie on '
Sesame Street.'  It's what
 
we did all the t
ime — sat around
 
s
inging and telling stories."
 
+ After the death of her husband
 
in 1971, Bess spent more t
ime teach-
ing folklore and folklife at Califor-
nia State University, Northridge.  At
 
the invitation of Ralph Rinzler, then
 
director of the Smithsonian's Office
 
of Folklife Programs, she came to
 
Washington to work on the folklife
 
f
eativals of 1975 and 1976.
 
+ Bess then accepted an offer from
 
the National Endowment for the Arts
 
to develop its Folk Arts Program.  "
I
 
thought it might be interesting to
 
see what could be done if you had any
 
money to work with,"  she says,
 
"because we never had any money in
 
the folk arts f
ield."
 
+ Bess is proud of the programs
 
she developed — the folk arts
 
network between the states and the
 
federal government, the apprentice-
ship programs bringing together
 
artistic masters and those who wanted
 
to learn, and the National Heritage
 
Fellowships, which have been r
eceived
 
by nearly 150 r
ecipients s
ince 1982.
 
"
I feel mildly defensive of the
 
bureaucracy," she says.  "
I think you
 
should feel very r
esponsible spending
 
the people's money."

 THE VOICE
 
+ "
Bess i
s a heroine," s
ays Joe
 
Wilson, d
irector of the National
 
Council of the Traditional Arts.
 
"
She brought a vision to the f
ield of
 
f
olk art that i
t needed."  "
It's
 
government at i
ts best," s
ays her o
ld
 
f
riend P
ete S
eeger.  "
People just
 
don't comprehend that so many art
 
forms are r
eally here and r
eally
 
a
live and part of our f
abric," says
 
Dan Sheehy, her longtime assistant
 
and successor.  "What Bess has done
 
i
s to hold them up for national
 
attention."
 
+ Bess herself explains f
olk art
 
"
as an identifier, as a public state-
ment of what a hell of a f
ine thing
 
i
t i
s to be a L
ithuanian or a Greek
 
or a Comanche Indian."
 
+ As she l
eaves the Folk Arts
 
Program in the hands of those she has
 
taught and inspired, she s
ays there's
 
s
till so much out there that needs to
 
be brought to l
ight — new t
raditions
 
i
n voice, music, dance, costumes,
 
carving, "
but I think this office i
s
 
in good shape — otherwise I
 wouldn't
 
be leaving.  But they won't be r
id of
 
me.  I
'll probably f
ind myself doing
 
pretty much what I
'm doing now, in
 
one f
orm or another."
 
+ I
t was r
ecalled that early in
 
the interview Bess had pointed out on
 
a l
arge map of the United States how
 
f
olk art of a
ll k
inds had progressed.
 
F
irst, a f
ew programs down through
 
Appalachia and a couple of things out
 
West.  But then she pointed to p
ins
 
and f
lags f
rom F
lorida to Alaska and
 
Hawaii, and waved an arm to somewhere
 
off the map, where the f
arthest
 
corner of the Pacific might be.  "We
 
s
till don't have the Marianas," she
 
s
ays, "
but we will."
 
e Of that we're sure!  Happy Retire-
ment, Bess.

St. Patrick's Day at Tower Villas
 
• Even though the beer wasn't green,
 
the Tower Villas' St. Patrick's Day
 
party was a great success.  In addi-
t
ion to the beer, the bill of f
are
 
included pretzels, cookies (
some were
 
green) and I
rish coffee, made with
 
I
rish whiskey, of course.  About 7
0
 
r
esidents attended and a big bash was
 
had by all.  Thanks to John McDonald,
 
at least one r
eveler was heard to pro-
c
laim the I
rish coffee "
the best I
 
ever tasted."
 
e Our thanks a
lso to Sandy Beaubien
 
and E
lma Minno who s
erved all evening
 
so that the r
est of us could enjoy.
 
• A special thank-you to Paul Layner
 
for his help "
over and above the call
 
of duty" in s
etting up, c
learing out
 
and c
leaning up, and to E
lma Minno for
 
unstintingly l
ending her expertise to
 
two r
ank amateurs trying to r
elieve
 
some of the burden on our perennially
 
hard-working Activities Committee
 
members.

co-owners may not understand the various elements of the Tower Villas budget.
 
Future editions of the VOICE will include a discussion of the major items of the
 
budget, identifying and differentiating between those over which the Committee
 
has l
ittle or no control and those that involve discretionary spending.

House Committee
 
• The organizational meeting was held on Mar. 5 to draw up sub-committees, in-
c
luding sub-group assignments, and to r
eview the work program for the past and
 
coming year.  Sue Durham (
1610) will again serve as Chair.
 
• The committee now has three sub-committees:  Grounds, chaired by Mary Lou
 
Durham (
906); S
ecurity, chaired by Martha Wilson (
1014) and Recycling, chaired
 
by Connie Collins (
408).  There will be two ad hoc committees — one dealing
 
with r
edecorating the main lobby and r
esidents' elevator lobbies, chaired by
 
Martha Wilson; the other dealing with r
efurbishing the elevator interiors,
 
chaired by Paul Burbage (
213).
 
o The work r
elated to r
edecorating the lobbies i
s well under way; in f
act, the
 
ad hoc committee i
s now at the stage where bids are being r
eviewed.  As the work
 
gets nearer to completion, r
esidents will be kept advised of decisions, e
ither
 
through the VOICE or by notices in boxes at the desk.  Work on r
efurbishing the
 
elevators i
s just beginning, but it will cover such aspects as compliance with
 
the current code, disability, legislation, etc.

Worst Case Scenario

ENGINEERING COMMITTEE
 
It's a dark and stormy
 
night.  Lightening hits
 
Tower Villas r
epeatedly.
 
F
ire starts on the 17th
 
f
loor.  F
ire engines arrive.
 
The f
ire chief asks how many
 
people need to be helped on
 
17.  Our answer — WE DON'T
 
KNOW.  OUR DEMOGRAPHIC
 
SURVEY IS INCOMPLETE!!!
 
• The Tower Villas community in
 
which we l
ive is equivalent to a
 
small village.  It's about the s
ize
 
of Chevy Chase, Maryland, where I
 
used to l
ive, which then had about
 
250 families spread out horizontally,
 
while Tower Villas has 252 units
 
stacked vertically.  We don't usually
 
think of ourselves as a village — we
 
l
ive in Arlington, but we also l
ive
 
in the community of Tower Villas.  We
 
govern ourselves in many r
espects,
 
but we need more community-minded-
ness.  We have a multi-million dollar
 
budget and an even greater equity in
 
where we l
ive — an equity we must be
 
alert to protect.
 
•
, we are governed by a duly elected
 
Board of Directors from among our-
selves, which is aided by other vol-
unteers serving on various committees
 
and subcommittees.  In order to oper-
ate Tower Villas for the benefit of
 
all, your Board needs to know who
 
forms this community and a few basic
 
facts about each person who l
ives
 
here.  Thus, every few years we need
 
to take a "
census."  The last such
 
demographic survey was taken in 1980.
 
• In January we distributed new
 
demographic forms and hoped to have
 
the r
esults to you in this issue of
 
the VOICE, but a considerable number
 
of r
esidents are r
eluctant to r
es-
pond.  The Board thought it obvious
 
as to the "need to know" some basic
 
facts about our population.  The
 
above l
ightening/fire scenario i
l-
lustrates but one.  Here's another:
 
The wading pool plumbing
 
needs f
ixing.  How many
 
potential waders l
ive in
 
Tower Villas?  Is it econo-
mic for all with r
espect to
 
the whole budget to spend
 
$100, $1000, $5000 on this
 
amenity?  Or should we r
e-
place the wading pool with a
 
jacuzzi, which might be used
 
by more r
esidents?
 
• The Board, which r
epresents you,
 
needs the basic facts from the survey
 
forms to make r
easoned judgments on
 
the budget and the maintenance and
 
upkeep of Tower Villas.  Almost 100
 
(
!) units have not r
eturned the front
 
desk emergency forms, and 140 (
!)
 
have failed to r
espond to the talent
 
search inquiries.  The rate of r
eturn
 
for the yellow confidential form i
s
 
also poor, with 140 outstanding.
 
• With this non-participation rate
 
— approximately 40% — the r
esults
 
thus far r
eceived, if published,
 
would be highly speculative -- we
 
cannot r
easonably extrapolate for 4
0%
 
of the potential data!  To those who
 
have r
esponded, many thanks for your
 
civic mindedness in doing so.  For
 
those who have not, for whatever
 
r
eason, please r
ethink your position;
 
it's in your best interest.  We would
 
like to give the r
esults of the
 
census in the next issue of the
 
VOICE.

Know Your Building and It's People
 
• Your Engineering Committee i
s
 
again in operation and expects to
 
continue to help with Tower Villas
 
problems.  We have p
icked up an
 
additional new member -- Joe Orth,
 
Villa 1
505 -- and some h
igh-powered
 
advisors, so we are looking forward
 
to another successful year.
 
• As you know, the Tower Villas
 
Community in which we l
ive i
s equiva-
l
ent to a small village and as such
 
has much the same f
acilities and in-
f
rastructure problems.  A tour of the
 
building will r
eveal that in the gar-
age area we have a pump r
oom, which
 
s
erves as our water works; an elec-
t
rical r
oom, which s
erves as our pow-
er station, where we have a s
ub-
s
tation with t
ransformers and switch-
i
ng gear, and an electrical d
istribu-
t
ion system.
 
o We a
lso have a t
elephone exchange
 
r
oom, our own f
ire alarm system and
 
t
rash compactor, and on the 1
9th
 
f
loor, boiler r
oom and a
ir condition-
i
ng equipment that provides the heat-
ing, cooling, hot water, a
ir distri-
bution and environment control for
 
year-round comfort, or d
iscomfort.
 
• Last but not l
east, we have a
 
t
ransportation system, "
vertical" to
 
be sure; r
oad ways, public square and
 
grounds.
 
• This, at an estimated r
eplacement
 
value of some $
40,000,000, i
s a s
ize-
able investment.  I
t presents all of
 
us, including s
taff and contractors,
 
with a formidable challenge to main-
tain and keep i
t r
unning at a l
evel
 
of which we can be proud.
 
• So l
earn as much as you can about
 
i
t's operation so you can do your
 
part to make i
t better, and we pledge
 
to continue to help where we can and
 
to answer your questions, i
f any.

ected with gases that make it a foam
 
product.  The gases used are CFCs
 
which "
eat" ozone molecules and fur-
ther deplete our essential ozone
 
layer.  The alternatives to CFCs
 
aren't much improvement.  One i
s
 
HCFC, 95% less damaging, but still a
 
threat to the ozone layer.  Others
 
are pentane and butane which contri-
bute to urban smog.
 
• Polystyrene foam i
s completely
 
nonbiodegradeable; it just won't go
 
away!  F
ive hundred years f
rom now
 
that foam cup f
rom which you drank
 
your coffee this morning will still
 
be somewhere here on earth.
 
• Because of its structure — 
containing so much a
ir — all styro-
foam takes up far too much space for
 
its weight, i
.e., enormous amounts of
 
precious space at already overflowing
 
landfills.  Polystyrene foam i
s dead-
ly to marine l
ife.  It f
loats on
 
ocean surfaces, breaks up into pel-
lets r
esembling food to sea animals.
 
For instance, when sea turtles eat
 
Styrofoam, styrofoam's buoyancy keeps
 
them f
rom diving, c
logs their systems
 
and they starve.
 
e S
IMPLE THINGS TO DO:  S
ince there
 
i
s no such thing as safe polystrene,
 
just don't use it. Avoid egg cartons
 
and picnic supplies made of it.  P
ic-
nic with paper plates and cups and
 
ask for them at fast food
 
r
estaurants.

TOWER VILLAS' OWN
 
Mike Harris
 
• I
 would l
ike to share with the
 
f
olks in Tower Villas, particularly
 
the many opera buffs l
iving here, an
 
experience I had r
ecently as a member
 
of the Washington Opera Company.
 
• Ever s
ince I heard Enrico Caruso
 
s
ing "Vesti la Giubba," I fantasized
 
that one day I
 would perform in an
 
opera.  S
eventy years later I had my
 
opportunity.  I auditioned for
 
"
Cavalleri Rusticana" and "
Pagliacci,"
 
two of E
.C.'s f
avorite operas, and
 
after my r
endition (
from the Latin, to
 
penetrate and disturb), the music
 
d
irector took me aside and quietly,
 
but f
irmly, warned me that i
f ever I
 
sang one note of music within one mile
 
of the f
ront entrance of the Kennedy
 
Center, he would have me f
logged.  I
 
accepted that, being a music lover
 
myself.
 
• He said, however, that he needed
 
some peasant types and he f
elt I could
 
f
ill the b
ill.  (
Debbie concurred,
 
which I took as a shot.)  So I became
 
a supernumerary.
 
• Supernumeraries, commonly known as
 
"
supers" or "
extras," are l
ifetime
 
members of the "
Theater of the
 
unheard."  Supers are not permitted to
 
speak or s
ing.  They may, on occasion,
 
mumble, or growl and look f
ierce, but
 
their primary function i
s to f
ill the
 
empty spaces on stage, wear weird
 
costumes and carry spears, or in
 
I
talian operas, bottles of Chianti.
 
• Supers have no idea of what i
s
 
going on i
n center stage when the
 
opera i
s sung in a foreign tongue.
 
But by watching the principals, they
 
s
ense the mood of the s
cene and r
es-
pond accordingly with oohs and aahs or
 
g
lazed looks.  Some supers t
ry to up-
s
tage other supers by s
creaming too
 
l
oudly or shoving people aside during
 
a mob s
cene, but these ego pushers are
 
Page 9
 
held in low esteem by the more discip-
l
ined, who r
oundly condemn boorish
 
behavior.  Supers have pride.
 
• We were twenty — mostly profes-
s
ional or r
etired r
esidents of the
 
Washington area, who love opera and
 
are willing to endure e
ight r
ehear-
sals, e
ight performances, exiguous
 
pay, and gooey makeup to prove it.
 
During the performances we stood in
 
the wings l
istening to the principals,
 
enjoying every note.  The children's
 
chorus was incredible, never missing a
 
cue and s
inging l
ike angels.  But
 
off-stage they acted l
ike normal k
ids,
 
i
.e., r
ough-housing a bit in the
 
dressing room.  Some old guy (
I'm not
 
saying who) turned them in to the
 
stage mothers and one father, the
 
latter saying, "
Is that all?"
 
• All in all we supers were t
reated
 
by the principals, the music director,
 
and the stage director, as if we be-
longed.  Not so the stagehands.  They
 
called us "
stupid-numeraries."  We
 
seemed to be always getting in their
 
way and asking stupid questions, l
ike
 
"How come Pagliacci enters in a Model
 
T Ford?"  "Yes," they answered, "we
 
know he should enter in a mule cart,
 
but a Model T is more predictable."
 
In r
etrospect, it was a stupid
 
question.
 
• Highlights?  The curtain calls,
 
gray-haired men and women standing,
 
clapping and bravoing l
ike mad.  They,
 
too, must have heard E
.C. s
ing.  (
E.C.
 
r
ates a standup.)
 
• We are fortunate to have a world
 
c
lass opera company nearby.  Next year
 
the house will r
esonate with the
 
glorious sounds of "Othello,"
 
"Turandot," and the "Tsar's Bride,"
 
among others.  Will we t
ry it again?
 
Maybe.  Playing it dumb turned out to
 
be a lot of fun.

hooray!
 
• Tower Villas' aspiring Grand Opera
 
performer is well on the way to a
 
brilliant career.  In the Stagebill
 
for the Washington Opera's perfor-
mance of "Cavalleria Rusticana," one
 
C
. Michael Harris is l
isted as a
 
supernumerary.  Yes, that's our Mike
 
Harris, for the evening a r
esident of
 
an unnamed Sicilian village and cast,
 
as he said, in a peasant role.
 
e The t
ime was Easter Sunday; all
 
the peasants were dressed in their
 
best attire -- business-like suits,
 
t
ies, brimmed caps, all enroute to
 
church.  Mike's f
irst appearance was
 
center stage front, greeting an old
 
friend with a warm handshake and
 
exchanging a f
ew cordial words.
 
Before the church services began Mike
 
helped to bring into the church a
 
guilded f
igurine born on a palanquin.
 
a The last we saw of him he was
 
assisting a l
ittle old lady on her
 
way home after church, solicitously
 
shielding her from the mid-day sun
 
with an umbrella.  Bravos rang
 
throughout the hall.
 
• We just r
eceived the opera
 
company's schedule for the 1992-93
 
season indicating lots of opportu-
nities for good supernumeraries l
ike
 
Mike, so we'll be watching for him
 
next season.

TIMING IS IMPORTANT
 
e A two-week vacation in San Diego
 
at the end of January would be great,
 
I thought -- an escape from snow and
 
slush in Arlington.  But a vacation
 
in Southern California the middle of
 
February would have been even better
 
considering the snow of February 13.
 
e San Diego's zoo is one of the
 
world's largest and best.  And Sea
 
World with performing killer whales,
 
dolphins, sea l
ions, and a water ski
 
show is touted as a "must."  But I
 
passed them by; too many other places
 
and things were more appealing to me
 
— the Old Town State Historical
 
Park, Seaport Village, the Wild
 
Animal Park in Escondido that is
 
viewed from a 50-minute narrated
 
monorail r
ide, the 19th Century ele-
gance of the famous Hotel Del Coro-
nado, the Mission San Diego de A1-
cala, the bright r
ed trolly from
 
Center City to the San Ysidro border
 
crossing to Tijuana to name a few.
 
e I
'm a history buff, so the early
 
history of the area I found most
 
fascinating.  I sat at an antique
 
desk in the Mason Street School
 
erected in 1865, the f
irst public
 
school serving all of San Diego
 
County — an area 14,800 square
 
miles, larger than Massachusetts,
 
Connecticut, and Rhode Island com-
bined.  In those days school was in
 
session all year long, had an average
 
attendance of 35 students —from 4 to
 
17 years old —and all eight grades
 
were taught in the one small room.
 
— Discipline involved specific
 
punishments for l
isted infractions,
 
e
.g., coming to school with dirty
 
faces and hands or wearing long
 
f
inger nails — 2 lashes; scuffling
 
— 4 lashes; drinking spiritous
 
l
iquors at school — 8 lashes, and
 
playing cards at school — 10 lashes.
 
— The f
irst teacher was hired at
 
the f
ine salary of $65 a month.  She
 
r
ented two rooms for $2 a month, but
 
wrote that f
leas were plentiful and
 
hungry.  After 1
1 months, she r
esign-
ed and married the school board
 
president.
 
e San Diego in the last half of the
 
19th Century was colorful, to say the
 
least — a honeycomb of saloons, tat-
too parlors, bordellos, gambling
 
halls, grog shops, boarding houses,
 
low-life music halls called melo-
deons, and fancy "parlor houses."  It
 
was populated by droves of footpads,
 
strumpets, card sharps, saloonmen,
 
and r
eal estate speculators.  One
 
madam sent her harlots into the
 
streets to drum up business.  A
 
painted lady in a pink gown would
 
sashay down the street with sugges-
t
ive wiggles and glances.  When a man
 
trailed her, she r
eturned to her room
 
to await developments.  When the man
 
entered the building, the madam met
 
him and the conversation went some-
thing l
ike this:  "What is her name,
 
s
ir?"  "Well, I don't r
ightly know."
 
"What is her room number?"  Well, I
 
don't know that either."  "Then, what
 
was she wearing?"  "Oh, I know that.
 
Pink!"  "Take the stairs to the third
 
floor and go to the pink room."
 
e Balboa Park is huge, housing many
 
attractions in buildings of Spanish
 
Colonial architecture erected for the
 
1915 celebration of the completion of
 
the Panama Canal and the 1935 Cali-
fornia-Pacific Exposition.  I visited
 
three of the Park's nine museums, in-
cluding the 76-foot domed Omnimax
 
Theater for the thrilling "
experi-
ence" of shooting the r
apids in the
 
Grand Canyon's Colorado River.
 
e But the r
est of Balboa Park and
 
San Diego will be on my agenda when,
 
if all goes well, I spend another two
 
weeks there next year — hopefully
 
with better t
iming to avoid Febru-
ary's wintry weather here.

Dear Bess,
 
In the course of my wanderings,  I
 
have come to believe that there is
 
such a thing as a conspiracy of good
 
people who,  without even knowing
 
one another,  make the world finer
 
and life upon the earth more humane.
 
And you are capo,  Bess,  sachem,
 
pharaoh,  secretary-general,  Mother
 
Superior of this wide-ranging
 
brother and sisterhood.
 I admire
 
you for what you have done and for
 
who you are,  and send love.
 
As ever,
