It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as. I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies; 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
crways.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then I' rmist; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes; 
And how we , net, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Tv.-as love among the -MSC'S. ' 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by -the.,garden7gitte. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then filially made proposes: 
Thro' the garden we walked, of ;happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, &v. 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone. 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, (ke.

ISLE OF BEAUTY. 
Shades of evening, close not o'er us, 
Leave our lonely bark aNlhile, 
Morn, alas 
will not restore us 
Yonder dim and distant isle. 
Still my fancy can discover 
Sunny spots where friends may dwell, 
Darker shadows round us hover, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well. 
"Pis the hour when happy faces, 
Smile areund the taper's light, 
, 
Who will fill our vacant places ? 
Who will sing our songs to-night ? 
What would I 
not give to wander 
Where my old ..,.:-.
npanions dwell ? 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
Isle of beauty, fare thee well.

'Words by T. ii.BAYLY. 
MUSie by A LEXANDER LEN, 
I11 be no submissive wife, 
No, no, not I; 
I'll not be a 
slave for life, 
No, not I, no, not I; 
Think you on a 
wedding day, 
That

Love, honor, and obey ? 
No not 1, no not I. 
I 
to dullness don't incline, 
No not I, no not I! 
Go to bed at half-past nine— 
No not I, no not I! 
Should a 
humdrum husband say, 
That at home I 
ought to stay— 
Do you think that 
obey, 
No not I, no not I.

Of my little. lad, gone to make me sad; 
Aye, the child I 
had, but was not to keep. 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
.As in heaven high I 
my child did seek, 
There in train came by children fair and meek; 
Each in lily white, with a 
lamp a-light; 
Each was clear to sight, but they did not speak. 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn, 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
Then, a 
little sad, came my child in turn, 
Mut the lamp he had, oh I 
it (lid not burn; 
lie to clear my doubt, said, half turned about, 
Your tears put it out; Mother, mother, never mourn."

Sweet Polly Primrose was a 
girl 
Of nineteen summers old, 
I 
loved sweet Polly better far, 
Than all the world untold. 
And she was very fond of me ; 
But now I 
wail and weep, 
For the girl I 
love's at present

So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great long tail, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great big tail, 
A tiny little tittle bat, a 
winkle or a 
whale, 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea. Oh! my 1 
Sweet Pollywas on board a 
ship, 
And bound for Union Square; 
When the vessel sighted 
Tammany," 
It began to pitch and rear ; 
My love was gazing over 
At the water rolling by, 
When, somellow, she tumbled overboard, 
And never said good-bye. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, &o. 
The Captain and his gallant crew 
Jumped overboard to save 
My darling Polly, but in vain— 
She'd sunk beneath the wave— 
And when they told me of her fate, 
l'd tear my hair and weep. 
And requested I 
might be allowed 
To plunge into the deep.. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, &c. 
I 
had a 
dream last night that I 
Was down below the wave, 
And there I 
saw my l'olly 
In a 
gorgeous coral cave; 
She'd changed into a 
mermaid, 
And she'd such a 
splendid tail, 
She was doing double siutfiles, 
In conjunction with a 
whale. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, &c. 
While she's a 
sportive mermaid, 
I'm so wretched here d.bove: 
So I 
think 1'11 take a 
plunge and be 
A merman with my love; 
But the precise locality, 
I 
don't exactly know, 
Where I 
may find my Polly 
So perhaps Id test not go.

There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl J'ye seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
Whenev_er she goes by. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Sun-flower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the treews. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
1;ould pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
How could she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No 1 
And I 
feel, 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
l‘Ty fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted me. 
She said silo really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
W4y of course she answered, yes. 
And I

PADDY ON THE CANAL. 
When I 
landed in sweet Philadelphia, the weather was pleasant and 
clear ; 
I 
did not stay long in the city, so quickly I 
shall let you hear. 
I 
did not stay long in the city, for it happened to be in the fall, 
I 
never reefed a 
sail in my rigging, 
till I 
anchored out on the calla, 
CIIORI:S. 
So fare you well, father and mother, 
Likewise to old Ireland too ; 
So fare you well, sister and brother, 
So kindly I'll bid you adieu. 
When I 
came to this wonderful empire, it filled me with the greatest 
surprise, 
To see such a 
great undertaking, on the like I 
never opened my eyes, 
To see full a 
thousand brave fellows at work among mountains so tall, 
To dig through tho vallies so level, through rocks for to cut a 
canal. 
So fare you well, & c. 
  entered 
with them for a 
season, my monthly pay for to draw, 
1.nd being in very good humor. I 
often sang Erin go bragh; 
Our provision it was very plenty, to complain we'd no reason at all; 
I 
had money in every pocket, while working upon the canal, 
So fare you well, &c. 
I 
learned for to be very handy, to use both the shovel and spade; 
I 
learnt the whole art of canalling, I 
think it an excellent trade.

learned to 
very handy, although I 
was in 't 
very tall, 
I 
could handle. the sprig of shillalah with the best man on the canal, 
So fare you well, & c. 
I 
being an entire stranger, be sure I 
had riot • much to say; 
The boss came round in a 
hurry, says, Iloys, it is grog-time-a-aay. 
We all marched up in good order, he was flit her now unto us all; 
Sere, I 
wished myself from that moment to be working upon the can. 
So fare you well, &c. 
When at night we all rest from our labor, be sure but our rent is all 
paid, 
lye laid down our pick and our shovel, likewise our axe and our spade ; 
We all set a 
kdzing together, there was nothing our minds to enthral ; 
If happiness be in this wide world, T

done. kissed Kate MeAlvoy ! 
And her sweetheart went out for her cousin ; 
By the powers he brought in a 
dozen. 
What a 
daldrum 
have knocked us in, 
If I 
hadn't had this darling old stick. 
War! was the word when a 
faction came in, . 
For they pummelled me well—they stripped off to the skin ! 
Like a 
rector I 
stood, watching- the cr ack, 
And the first one came up I 
knock-Hi at his back ? 
Then I 
poked out the eye of Pat Glancy, 
For lie once humbugged my sister Nancy! 
In the meantimo Miss Kate took a 
fancy 
To me and my innocent Stick! 
I 
smathered her sweetheart until he was black, 
late tipped mc the wink, we were off in a 
thwack 
We went to a 
house at the end of t(iwn, 
Where we kept up WIT spirits by pouring some down. 
When the whiskey began for to warm her, 
I 
got her snug up ill it. COIller, - 
She said her sweetheart would inform on her! 
'Twas there I 
said praise to my Stick ! 
Kate she drank whiskey to such a 
degree 
That for her support she had to lean upon nip 
I 
said I 
would see her safe to her abode, 
'Twirls there we fell in the middle of the road. 
rntil roused by the magistrate's orders, 
Devil a 
toe could we go farther, 
Surrounded by police for murder, 
Was myself and my innocent Stick. 
When I 
was acquitted I 
jumped from the dock, 
all the gay fellows wound me dill flock. 
They gave me a 
SOU0 arm, they shook in 
hand so often, 
It was only for fear of Sec lug my own coil in 
I 
went and bought a 
gold ring, sirs, 
Miss Kate to the Priest I

That night we did joyfully sine-, 
The frdvent ores of myself and my Stick ! 
PADDY MILES. 
From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name. 
For if anything whit wrong, or a 
mischief 'twas done,' 
Shure they'd have all the blame on lily mother's own son. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor, 
'Pon an Irishman's throe word and honor, 
Oh, misfortune my curse light upon her, 
'Twas she christened me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they'd say Paddy Miles; 
Who was it set lire to his reverence's wig, 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig. 
Who called Mishes Moloney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGee's cat the jallop, 
Some blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From -my master Mick Flynn. a 
character brought, 
But it done me no good, and I 
thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to leave the mild sod. 
For the devil a 
wan would employ me, 
The girls there they would micy me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me, 
All bekase I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Who cut off one of the tails of Pat -Finegan's coat. 
And who broke the lett horn of Ned Shoughnessy's goat, 
Who through the back door to the chapel got in, 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds what a 
sin, 
Who half- murdered_ a 
poor-house inspector, 
And fired at a- police detector, 
When Miss Pagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'cr saw me there. faix, they all knew my face 
The jackeens kept calling meself to annoy, 
There's goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy. 
Till I 
flourish my sprig of shillalah. 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly, 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, before long to this country T 
came, 
An' found Paddy Miles here was the same; 
If my name wasn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad luck to the master could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made, sir, 
An' if you want to get a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my soul then yon need not be afraid, sir, 
For to hire me, I'm not Paddy Miles.

THE CAPTAIN AND HIS WHISKERS. 
Words and Music by T. II. BAYLY. 
As they marched through the town, with their banners so gay. 
I 
ran to the window to hear the band play ; 
I 
peeped through the blinds very cautiously then, 
Lest the neighbors should say I 
was looking at the men. 
Oh I 
heard the drums beat, and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much greater treat, 
The troop was the finest that I 
ever did see, 
And the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me. 
When we met at the ball r 
of course thought it right, 
To pretend that we never liftd met ti.1 that night; 
But he knew me at once I 
perceived by his glance, 
And I 
hung down my head when he asked me to dance; 
Oh I 
he sat by my side at the end of the set, 
An I 
the sweet words he said I 
never shall forget; 
My heart was enlisted and Could not get free, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me. 
But he marched from the town and I 
saw him no more, 
Yet I 
think of him still and the whiskers he wore ; 
I 
dream all the night, and I 
talk all the day, 
Of the love of a 
Captain who has gone far away ; 
I 
remember with superabundant deig 
'When we met in the street and we danced all the night; 
And T 
keep in my mind how my heart jumped with glee, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me.

The soft clew is sleeping, 
The young buds are peeping, 
The sunbeams are dancing, o'er blossom and tree; 
But spring time returning, 
Is far colder burning, 
Than I 
my dear Marian, to come back to thee. 
And now that we're meeting, 
Your heart near me beating, 
It's little we'll think of the past that has flown; 
For your bloom that has faded, 
lour heart that was shaded, 
Will yet, like the flowr's, have a 
spring of their own. 
The soft dew is sleeping, 
The young buds are peeping, 
The sunbeams are dancing o'er blossom and tree ; 
But spring- time returning,

Than I, my dear Marian, to come back to thee. 
In the moment of sorrow, 
When dark seem'd the morrow, 
I 
left thee and home to the Western Isle fam'd, 
But cold is the pleasure, 
Tho' bright be the treasure, 
When thinking to gain it we leave our dear land; 
But I 
told 
on when leaving, 
ne'er be deceiving, 
That I'd never forget you, what e'er I 
might scc ; 
So I 
toird then with pleasure, 
But the best smiling treasure 
Is that which I 
gain now I've come back to thee.

I

As he said to a 
colleen beside me: 
" 
Who's that purty girl milking her Cow 1" 
Oh I 
many times nailer ye met me 
An vowed that I 
should always be 
Your darlin' a 
Chushla, Alanua Mavourneen 
A Suilish Machree. 
I

Of the girls in the world where yo move, 
I 
haven't their beautiful faces, 
But, oh ! I've a 
heart that can love; 
If it plalse ye. I'll dress me in satin, 
Au' jewels I'll pot on my brow, 
But, oh ! don't be afther forgettin' 
Your purty girl milking her cow. 
MOTHER, HE'S GOING AWAY. 
Mother.—Now, what are von crying for, Nay ; 
Don't be blubberin' there like a 
fool, - 
With the weight of grief. ' faith I 
tell you, 
You'll break down the three-legged stool. 
I 
suppose now you're crying for Barney, 
But don't b'lieve a 
word that he'd say,

Sure 5

Daughter.— But, mother— 
Mother — Oh, bother! 
Daughter.— But mother, he's going away; 
And I 
dreamt th' other night 
Of his ghost all in white— 
Oh, mother, he's going away! 
Mother.—If he s 
going away all the bettber— 
Blessed hour when he's out of ','our sight, 
There's one comfort—you can't get a 
letther, 
For yez neither can read or can write. 
Sure ' twas only last week you protested, 
Since he courted fat Jenny M'Cray, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested— 
With abuse, sure, your tongue never rested— 
Daughter.—But, mother— 
Mother.- 0h, bother !

IRISH SCHOOLMASTER. 
Old Teddy O'Rourke kept a 
bit of a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and made it a 
rule, 
if the mind wouldn't mark, faith he'd soon mark the back, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devilish crack. 
His scholars were: Jerry, Big Billy, and Iced, 
With Mm- rough M'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, 
Tall Dermot O'Clany, and Dennis O'Shea, 
Faith, all noble boys to drive learning away. 
SPOFEN.--Well, my boys, says old Ted, as you are all here, I'll just 
be calling your names over, to see it any of ye are missing. 
Gerald 
ll'Shee.—I'm not here, sir.— Then where are you, agrali ?—I'm astride 
of the door, sir.—Then come in, and I'll beat you. Conley OTIaherty, 
—I'm here, but my brother Barney ain't.—Then where is your brother 
Barney 7—Faffh, sir, he's dead and they're going to wake him.—Poor 
fellow! 
I'm sorry he's gone home, for he was Inv own scholar; but do 
you go and sit down, and don't fall asleep, or 
be after waking you. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he's always ready, 
To kick up a 
row or the whiskey to smack; 
With Ids drinking and eating, 
His birching and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row de dow whack. 
Faith, Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton, 
And a 
chin, too! och honey, but they were all one; 
A grin, too, lie had, and if there was a 
noise, 
He'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
A fortune he had, too :— his birch and his wig, 
A black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pratty plantation, a 
dog and a 
cat, 
And his head that he kept in an old greasy hat. 
Sromtx.—Phelim O'Maheney, says he, one day, before you sit down, 
stand up, and say your alphabet, so keep your five fingers out of your 
head for a 
few minutes, and begin. 
What letter's that, sir ?—I 
don't 
know, sir.—Arrah, botheration to you, what was it 1 
said when I 
saw 
you blacking Pat Mooney's eye h—Faith, sir, you said: Ah you big 
blackguard.—Well, never mind the blackguard, but say ah.—Ah.— 
Now, what letters that ?—Faith, sir, I 
don't know', you ought to know 
better than me.—What makes the honey, and hold your 1
-% 
hist ?-13.— 
That's a 
good boy. 
Now, what kind of a 
half moon thing do you call 
that 7—I don't know, sir.—Och ! botheration, what do I 
do with my 
eyes ?—He! he! he !—Well, what do you laugh at, sir ? 
I 
ask you what 
do I 
do with my eyes ?—Youl you squint I—Arid what else, sir ?—You 
see.—That's a 
good boy. Now go on.—D-E-F-G- II.— Well, why do you 
stop 7—Because I 
can't go on any further, sir.—What has your mother 
got at the corner of her nose ?—A pimple, sir.—Och, my service t'ye, 
sir; and what else 7 —One eye.—Devil take you, and don't be getting 
into figures now. Say I, without the one,—I, without the one.—What's 
the next ?—It's something, sir, but I 
don't know what.—What does 
your mother open the door with ?—A string, sir, and sometimes her 
foot.—Well, did you never have anything else ?—Yes, sir, K.—That's a 
good boy; and now, as you have got to L, (hell) you may sit down and 
warm yourself. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he was always ready, 
To kick up a 
row, or the whiskey to smack, 
With Ids drinking and eating, 
His birching- and beating, 
And his hubaboo, philaloo, row do dow whack.

MOLLY ASTHORE. 
As down by Banna's banks I 
strayed, 
One evening- in May, 
The little birds, in blythest notes, 
Made vocal ey'ry spray; 
They sung their little notes of love, 
They sung them o'er and o'er, 
Ali 
gramachree, my cholleenoge, 
My Molly Asthore. 
The daisy pied and all the sweets 
The dawn of Nature yields— 
The primrose pale, and vi let blue, 
Lay scattered o'er the fields; 
Such fragrance in the bosom lies 
Of her whom I 
adore. 
Ah! grammachree, &c. 
I 
laid me down upon a 
bank, 
Bewailing my sad fate, 
That doomed me thus the slave of love, 
And cruel Molly's hate ; 
How can she break the honest heart, 
That wears her in its core ? 
Ah! grammachree, Szc. 
You said you loved me, Molly dear! 
Ah ! why did I 
believe ? 
Yet who could think such tender words 
Were meant but to deceive ? 
That love was all I 
asked on earth— 
Nay 'leaven could give no more. 
Ah! grammachree, & e. 
Oh! had I 
all the flocks that graze 
On yonder yellow bill ; 
Or lowed for me the mmterMIS herds 
That you green pasture till— 
With her I 
love id gladly share 
My kine and fleecy store. 
• 
grammachree, Sze, 
Two turtle-doves, above my head, 
Sat courting on a 
bough, 
I 
envied them their happiness; 
To see them bill and coo ; 
Such fondness once for me was shown, 
But now, alas! ' tis o'er, 
• 
grammachree, & c. 
Then, fare thee well. my Molly dear ! 
Thy 
Ii SS I e 'er shall mourn, 
Whilst life remains in Strephon's heart, 
'Twill beat for thee alone ; 
Though thou art false, may Heaven on thee 
It's choicest blessings pour.

CIP WITH THE LARK IN THE MORNING. 
I 
like to be jolly in a 
moderate way, 
But think it a 
pity to hear folks ssry, 
Drill: and be merry till the break of day, 
No " Joll Dog" am I. 
On my exertion= I 
dep nd, 
o 
other wealth .I 
crave ; 
And hough I 
have the heart to spend, 
I've still the sense to save. 
CH 0

For I 
never drink h rd— it don't suit me, 
Nor toss 
y I

one, two, three, 
Merry and wise is t e 
motto for I. 
And up with the lark in the morning. 
There's a 
time for pleasure rnd a 
time f
or play, 
A 
time to labor and a 
time to be gay; 
If the sun shines bright, y, u must make ay, 
And I'll tell you the reason why. 
To-da.- we may be bale and strong, 
To-morrow who can tell, 
Without the heilth to earn a 
cent, 
Without a 
friend as W011. 
SO 
I 
never drink hard, &a. 
If I 
had the money that some have got, 
I'd scatter a 
bit in the laborer's cot, 
And the struggling poor, for I 
pity their lot, 
No miserly man am I. 
So I've always a 
dollar if I 
want to spend, 
I've always a 
dollar if I 
want to lend, 
I've always a 
dollar for a 
poor old friend, 
For a 
careful man ant I. 
Though I 
never drink hard, & c. 
No deser ing man shonld ay 
He ever pas ed my door 
In want, upon theworld's highway,

In the lovely summer I 
saw a 
pretty face, 
Framed in silken tresses— roses, too, and lace; 
low it made ine nutter, that sweet step of grace; 
Oh! I 
lost my heart in a 
twinkling ! 
Followed where she went, and tried to catch her eye— 
Really now I 
could not, she was to very sly ; 
At last I 
spoke, but just a 
word, and heav'd a 
gentle sigh, 
Then we heard the softest music gaily tinkling! 
CHORUS. 
SPOKEN.—For you see all this happened while— 
List'ning to the music, up in Central Park; 
All among the crowd I 
met her ! 
Flora was her name, my heart is in a 
flame, 
And I 
never, never, never can forget her. 
Flocks of charming ladies were walking on the " 
She was just the sweetest huong the short or tall ; 
Everybody called her just the belle of all, 
And the queen of the gay Grecian Lenders! 
Heard the mazy " waltz ;" we heard the " lancers," too; 
Chatted of the " fashions," the old ones and the new; 
And, oh, my heart, my gentle heart, she pierced it through and 
through, 
For she's fairer than the brightest summer splendors! 
SPOKEN.—You should see her! Why she took my breath away! And

billing and cooing" there we sat— 
List'ning to the music, & c. 
Took her home at twilight, and there I 
saw her," Pa;' 
Called upon her often ; she's my guiding star; 
Time it passed so sweetly, nothim,r came to mar ; 
And we went each day to the " Central!" 
Soon Made up in 
mind to " pop " the question now ; 
But I 
was so bashful, I 
scarcely did know how, 
Till once the " baud " began to play, and kicked up such a 
row, 
Then I 
asked her in a 
manner accidental!

For at the corner of a 
lane a

And he rammed the muzzle, arralt, what a

mouth, sirs.

But was sint 'cross the sea, out to Bottiny Bay, 
An' for his widdy we've got up this raffle." 
The quarter I 
spint, and with Larry I 
wint; 
To Oak street we travelled from Cherry ; 
At aitch sheebeen we'd stop to take a 
small dhrop, 
Be the time we got there we wor merry. 
As the &are we passed thro', what a

All me powers of description ' twonld baffle ; 
In all sorts of dress, full three hundred or less 
Wor at Mickey Maginnis's raffle. 
The factions enraged were in battle engaged, 
An' the blood soon began to flow freely, 
But the whole iv the crew couldn't lather us two, 
That's meself name blackthorn shIllaly.

Longed to take part in the battle ; 
It hit Shaughnessy's Ted such a 
belt on the head 
Lhat it knocked him stone blind at the raffle.

WE PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rosa, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye 
CHORUS. 
Oh tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A 
tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
wculd live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Oh! tell me, &e. 
We parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
I'll love you, you, only you. 
Oh I 
tell me, &c. 
MOLLY BAWN. 
0, Molly Bawn, why leave me pining, 
Or lonely waiting here for you— 
While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they have nothing else to do. 
The flowers late were open keeping, 
To try a 
rival blush with you, 
But their mother, lc;-ature, kept them sleeping, 
With their rosy faces washed in dew. 
0, Molly, eze. 
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, dear, 
And the pretty stars were made to shine ; 
The pretty girls were made for the boys, dear, 
And maybe you were made for mine. 
The wicked watch dog here is snarling--
Ile takes me for a 
thief, d'ye see ? 
For he knows I'd steal you, Molly, darling, 
And then transported. 1 
should be. 
0, Molly, &e. 
THE LASS OF GOWRIE. 
'Twas on a 
simmer's afternoon, 
A wee before the sun gaed down, 
My 
lassie wi' a 
braw new gown, 
Caine o'er the hill to Gowrie. 
The rosebud tin'd wi' morning show'r 
13loom'd fresh within the sunnie bow'r, 
But Kitty was the fairest tlow'r 
That ever blooni'd in Gowrie. 
I 
had Imo thought to do her wrang„ 
But round her waist my arms I 
hang, 
And said, " My lassie, will ye gang 
To xiew the Carse o Gowrie ? 
I'll take you to my father's ha' 
In you green field beside the shaw, 
And. male ye lady o' them a'— 
The brawest wife in Gowrie !" 
Soft kisses on her lips I 
laid, 
The blush -upon her cheek soon spread, 
She whisper'd modestly, and said: 
" 
I'll gang wi' ye to Gowrie !" 
The auld folks soon gaed their consent, 
And to Mess John we quickly went, 
Wha tied us to our hearts' content. 
And now she's Lady Gowrio! 
JOHNNY DOYLE. 
I 
am a 
fair maiden, all tangled in love; 
My case 1 
will make known to the great God above; 
thought it a 
credit, 1.- et I 
fear it a 
crime 
For to roam the world all over for you, Johnny Doyle. 
It was Saturday evening we made up the plan, 
It was early Monday morning to take a 
trip along ; 
My waiting-maid was standing by, as you can plainly see, 
She slipped in unto my mamma, and told upon me. 
My mamma she conducted me into a 
bed-room high, 
Where she knew no one could hear flu' nor pity my cry ; 
She bundled up my clothes, and she bid me beg,-one, 
For she knew well in her heart, that I 
loved that young man. 
A 
horse and side-saddle my father did provide, 
In hopes to get me married and be young Somers' bride ; 
A 
horse and side-saddle my father did prepare, 
With six noble footmen to wait on me there. 
So we rode all along till we came to Belfast town, 
Our horses being stabled and footn.en seated down ; 
While they were at their merriment,4 had my own toil, 
For my heart it lie at home with my young Johnny Doyle. 
By my eldest brother T 
was conducted home, 
My mamma she conducted me into my own bedroom ; 
My own bed being tile, softest; soy head I 
did lie flown, 
For to seek consoling sorrow, my body it was found. 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers in, 
Now close the door, dear mamma, don't you let Somers ; 
For to- night is the night that he means to enstrive, 
But he'll never gain the girl that is intended for his bride. 
WhP11 she saw the minister coming in the door, 
3Ier ear-rings, they bursted and fell upon the floor ; 
The gold ring on her finger, in a 
hundred pieces did fly, 
And her stomacher, it bursted, and death was drawing nigh. 
I 
will send for Johnny Doyle for you, my own darling child, 
I 
will send for Johnny Doyle for you, my own heart's delight ; 
Yes, you'll send for Johnny Doyle, mamma, but I 
fear it is too late 
For death, it is coining, and sad is my fate. 
Now death, you are coming ; you are welcome to me, 
From the pains, of love, 
sure„ you'll set me free ; 
There is more trouble on my mind than my poor tongue can tell. 
And these are tity dying words: Johnny Doyle, fare you well. 
The day of her funeral, it was a 
great sight, 
There were four-and- twenty fair Maidens, all dressed in white , 
They carried her to St. Mary's ground, and laid her in the clay; : 
Saying: The Lord, He may be with you forever and a 
day-
THEY TOLD ATE NOT TO LOVE HIM 
They told me not to love him, 
They said that he would prove 
Unworthy of so rich a 
gem 
As woman's priceless love. 
But I 
believed them not, oh ! no, 
I 
knew it could not be, 
That one so false as they thought \dm 
Could be so dear to me. 
They iold me not to love him, 
They said he was not true, 
And bade me have a 
care, lest I 
Shodld do what I 
might rue; 
At first I 
scorned their warning—for 
I 
could not think that he 
Concealed beneath so fair a 
brow 
A heart of perfidy. 
But they f 
deed me to discard him I 
Yet I 
could not cease to love, 
Forotu. mutual vows recorded were 
By angel hands above. 
He left his boyhood's home, and sought 
Forgetfulness afar; 
But memory stung him—and he fought, 
And fell in glorious war. 
They told me to discard him, 
'they said he meant me ill, 
They darkly spoke of friends that lure, 
And smile, and kiss, and—kill. 
I 
all unheeding heard them—for 
I 
knew it could not be, 
That one so false as they thought him 
Could be so dear to me. 
He dwells in H aven, now, while I 
Am doomed to this dull earth: 
Oh! how my sad soul longs to break 
Away, and wander forth. 
From star to star its course would be, 
Unresting it would go, 
Till we united were above, 
Who severed were below.

KISS ME AS OF OLD, 
MOTE.E31. 
On the field of battle, mother, 
All the night alone I 
lay, 
Angels watching o'er me, mother,. 
'Till the breaking of the day; 
I 
lay thinking of you, mother, 
And the loving ones at home, 
'Till to our dear cottage, mother, 
Boy again I 
seemed to come.

Kiss for me my brother, sister, 
When I

Her honer tried to save. 
I 
must soon be going, mother, 
Going to the home of rest; 
Kiss me as of old, mother, 
Pro.ss me nearer to your breast; 
Would I 
could repay you, mother, 
For your faithful love and care, 
God uphold and bless you, mother, 
In this bitter woe you bear.

Dear mother, I 
remember well 
The parting kiss you gave to me, 
When merry rang the village bell, 
My heart was full of joy and glee. 
I 
did not deem that one short year, 
Would crush the hopes that soared so high; 
Oh I

Dear mother, I've come home to die.

One parting kiss—to all good-bye; 
Weep not, but clasp your hands in mine,

I've met the foe upon the field, 
Where kindred fiercely did defy.

My little blue butterfly, rest awhile, 
Here where the garden blooms! 
The beautiful roses, how sweet they smile, 
With rich and rare perfumes 
Come, rest you here in clover, 
Why must you onward hie ? 
Each bud you kiss, you rover, 
And then away you fly! 
CII0ItUS. 
Ah l—its just the same with love ; yes, 
We'll find it out at last! 
Some flower will charm of gayest dress.— 
All vows away we east 
For evermore Love a 
rover will be, 
From heart to heart he'll flee, 
A 
little butterfly so gay, 
That's roving from you to me 1 
So, little blue butterfly, gay and free, 
Never a 
word you say; 
But wooing and winning you sail in glee, 
Through all the summer day ! 
The rose and pink are smiling, 
Come, linger by their side; 
The lillies fair beguiling, 
Their lips won't be denied ! 
Ah i—it's just the same, tlre.

I WILL -STAND BY MY FRIEND. 
As 
we go on through life's career, 
How many have to rough it ?

helping hand, 
A dozen try to buffet.. 
Still let's be faithful where we can, 
A 
helping hand to lend ; 
My maxim is, that, come what may, 
tvill stand by my friend ! 
M y 
maxim is, &c. 
W hen well to do in life, 
We all a 
ready welcome get; 
It's " How do you do, to-day, my boy ? 
I'm glad that we have met." 
But, if in our career through life, 
Bad luck does us attend, 
how few will give a 
hand and say, 
I 
will stand .by my friend ! 
How few will, 6zo. 
A friend in need is one indeed ; 
His heart and hand he lends; 
How different where we have to say, 
Oh ! save us from our friends ! 
With many friendship's but a 
name, 
No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say, 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
They bid, 
REY SISTER DEAR. 
From the Opera of ‘:11-AsSANIEtto.' 
M V 
sister, dear, o'er this rude cheek, 
How oft I've felt the tear- drop stealing, 
When those mute looks have told the feeling 
Heaven denied thy tongue to speak, 
And thou hadst comfort in that tear 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear. 
But now, alas! I 
weep alone, 
By thee—by joy, by hope forsaken, 
Mid thoughts that darkest fears awaken 
Trembling for thy fate unknown, 
And vainly flows the bitter tear, 
Shod for thee, my sister, dear.

IF I HAD A THOUSAND A YEAR. 
" 
Oh ! If I 
had a 
thousand a 
year, Gaffer Green, 
But I 
ne'er shall have it, I 
fear, 
*What a 
man I 
should be, 
And what sights I 
would see, 
If I 
had a 
thousand a 
year, Gaffer Green, 
Oh! if I 
had a 
thousand a 
year!" 
" 
The best wish you could have (take my word, Robin 
Rough) 
Will not pay for your bread and your beer; 
But be honest and true, 
Say what would you do, 
If you had got a 
thousand a 
year, Robin tough ? 
Oh! if you had got a 
thousand a

I 
would do—why, I

IRISH MOLLY, 0! 
As I 
walked out one morning, all in the month of May, 
I 
met a 
pretty Irish girl, and thus to her did say, 
I 
put my band into my pocket, as it happened so, 
And pulled out a 
guinea to treat my Irish Molly, 01 
CHORUS. 
She is young, she 13 beautiful, she is the fairest one I 
know, 
The primrose of Ireland, before my guinea go, 
And the only one that entices me, is my Irish Molly, 0. 
I 
said, my pretty fair maid, will you go along with me, 
I 
will show you the straight way across the country; 
My parents would be angry, if they should come to know, 
They will lay all the blame on my Scotch laddie, 0. 
She is young, d7c. 
When Molly's own father he came to know 
That she had been courted by a 
Scotch laddic, 0. 
lie sent for young 31'Donald, and these words to him did say, 
If you court my daughter Mary I 
will send you far away. 
She is young, dr.c. 
Since Molly has deceived me, all by her father's ways, 
Through some lone woods and valleys it's there I'll spend my 
days, 
Like some poor forlorn pilgrim I'll wander to and fro, 
It is all for the sake of my Irish Molly, 0. 
She is young, (tc. 
There is a 
rose in Dublin, I 
thought she would be mine, 
For to come to my funeral is all I 
do require ; 
My body shall be ready by the dawning of the day, 
It is all for the sake of my bonny Irish maid. 
She is young, & c. 
When that I 
am buried there is one thing more I 
crave, 
To lay a 
marble tomb-stone at the head of my grave, 
And on this tomb-stone a 
prayer shall be said, 
That young INI'Donald lies here for his young Irish mill& 
She is young, tke. 
Come all you pretty fair maids a 
warning take by me, 
Aud never build a 
nest at the top of any tree; 
For the green leaves will wither and the root it will decay, 
And the beauty of a 
fair maid will soon fade away. 
She is young, die. 
SEEING NELLY HOME. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
Hushed the sound of daylight's bustle, 
Closed the pink-eyed pimpernell, 
As down the moss-grown wood path, 
Where the cattle love to roam, 
From Aunt Patty's quilting party 
I 
was seeing Nelly home. 
CHORUS. 
-When I 
saw sweet Nelly home, 
When I 
saw sweet Neliy home, 
How I 
bless the August evening. 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
Jetty ringlets softly fluttered 
O'er a 
brow as white as snow, 
And her cheek, the crimson sunset' 
Scarcely had a 
warmer glow. 
'Arid her parted lips' vel million 
White teeth flashed like ocean foam, 
All I 
marked with pulses throbbing, 
As I saw sweet Ne Ely home. 
When I 
saw, eke 
When the Autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all the leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by alders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nelly told; 
As we stood together, gazing 
On the star-
bespangled dome, 
How I 
blessed the August evening, 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
When I 
saw, dr. 
White hairs mingle with my tresses, 
Furrows steal upon my brow, 
For a 
love-smile cheers and blesses 
Life's,,declining moments now. 
Matron in a 
snowy 'kerchief, 
Closer to my bosom come, 
Tell me dost thou still remember 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
When I 
saw, do.

as 
CROPPY BOY. 
It was early in the spring, 
The small birds whistling sweet did sing, 
Changing their notes from tree to tree, 
The song they sung was old Ireland free. 
It was early last 'Thursday night, 
The yeoman cavalry gave me a 
fright, 
The yeoman cavalry was my downfall 
When I 
was taken before Lord Cornwall. 
It was in his guardhouse where I 
was laid, 
And in his parlor where I 
was tried, 
My sentence passed and my spirits low, 
When to New Guinea I 
was forced to go. 
%% hen I 
was marching through the street, 
The drums and fifes did play so sweet, 
The drums and tifes did so sweetly play, 
As we were marching so far away. 
When I 
was marching past my father's door, 
My brother William stood on the floor, 
My aged father did grieve full sore, 
My tender mother her hair she tore. 
When my sister Mary heard the express, 
She ran down stairs in her morning dress, 
Saying, Five hundred guineas I 
would lay down, 
To see you marching through Wexford town. 
As I 
was marching through Wexford street, 
My sister Mary I 
chanced to meet; 
This false young woman did me betray, 
And for one guinea she swore life away. 
And when I 
am dead and taken to my grave, 
A decent funeral pray lot me have, 
And over my head plant a 
laurel tree, 
In sweet remembrance—iu remembrance of me. 
When I 
was marching o'er Wexford hill, 
0 
who could blame me to cry my fill 
I 
looked behind, I 
looked before, 
But my tender mother I 
ne'er saw more. 
I 
chose the dark and I 
chose the blue, 
I 
chose the pink and the orange, too,' 
forsook all tInise and dbl them deny, 
I 
wore the green and for it I'd die. 
When I 
was mounted on the gallows high, 
My aged father was standing by, 
My aged rather did me deny, 
And the name he gave me was the Croppy Boy. 
It was in old Ireland this voting man died, 
And in old Ireland his body's laid, 
All the people that do pass by, 
Say, The Lord have mercy on the Croppy Boy

PETTICOAT LANE. 
When to Dublin I 
came from the sweet County Down, 
I 
called on a 
friend, for to show me the town; 
lie brought me thro' streets, lanes, and alleys so grand, 
'Till my brogues were most wore, and I 
scarcely could stand. 
lie show'd me tine houses, were built up so high, 
And a 
man made of stone, almost up to the sky; 
But the names of them places went out of my brain, 
Except one, and he said it was, Petticoat Lane. 
Convenient to Petticoat Lane there's a 
place, 
And as we walked through it, we couldn't get peace; 
The shops were all full of fine clothes black and blue, 
But the fellows outside nearly tore me in two: 
One dragged me this way, to get a 
good frieze, 
Another had corduroy breeches, my size: 
But one chap bawls out, when I 
wouldn't remain, 
Show him up to the college in Petticoat Lane! 
Ri-to, dr.e. 
i-to, ctc. 
We got lose from this spot, myself and my friend, 
I 
couldn't do less than a 
teaster to spend, 
But we spied boys and girls in a 
laughable group, 
Sitting cross-legged, and they licking up soup. 
Says I, are these what you call your poor-house recruits ? 
Ax the divil, says one, and his bowl at me shoots. 
They roared with pleasure, while I 
roared with pain, 
Arrah. Paddy, you're welcome to Petticoat Lane! 
Ri-to, eze. 
My friend thought to drag me away by the sleeve, 
When a 
tartar dropt over my head, an old sieve; 
I 
turned for to strike her, but got in the eye 
A 
plaster of what they called, hot-mutton pie ! 
I 
kept groping about, like a 
man that was blind, 
Till I 
caught hould of somebody coming behind: 
I 
prayed that I 
might get the strength of a 
CAIN, 
To be ABLE to whale him in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, Arc. 
PETTICOAT LANE. 
- [CO NCLUDED.] 
I 
walloped away, and I 
got walloped, too, 
While all sorts of ructions were raised by the crew ; 
You would swear it was raining brick- bats and stones, 
Till I 
heard my antagonist giving some groans: 
Run and be datnn'd to you 
some one did cry, 
Sure, I 
can't Lr the mutton that's stnck in my eye 1 
I 
was led through the crowd, and heard somebody saying, 
There's a 
peeler most kill'd, up in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri 
These words like a 
thunderbolt, fell on my ear, 
So, I 
scooped all the fat from my eye, pretty clear; 
My friend tould the crowd that was round, to be mute I 
While we slipped to a 
house, called, the sign of a 
boot; 
There I 
calf(' for a 
sup, and we both took a 
seat, 
Two or three that had backed us, came in for a 
treat— 
When the reckoning was called for, my pockets were clean; 
For pounds, shillings. and ponce were in Petticoat Lane. 
itc., 
The reclening it came to a 
hog -and a 
groat, 
For which the landlord he took the lend of my coat; 
I 
started without, still cursing the town, 
When a 
policeman's pot-stick made friends with my crown. 
Says he 
You have killed C. 106.— 
Arrah, be aisy, sir I 
want none of your tricks. 
But the sergeant and twenty more swore it was plain 
That I 
was the bully of Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to, 
They all swarmed about me, like flies on a 
cask; 
But to prison to take me was no easy task. 
When I 
got there, I 
was charged with the crime; 
'Twas my own brother Darby I 
bate ail the time. 
When he seen me, he let out a 
thundering curse 
On the day that he fist went to join in the force; 
lie released my ould coat and ne got me off clean, 
To go home and say prayers for sweet Petticoat Lane. 
Phough to-day be dark and dreary 
And black clouds around us rise, 
Let us halt not nor be weary, 
Light is blooming in the skies t 
Aid and cheer each fellow creature 
'Ciainst the storms that round us lour, 
Soon they'll wear a 
brighter feature,. 
And the sunshine come with power. 
CHORUS. 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
But be up and act like men; 
Look with hope for joy to-
morrow' 
Sunny days will come again. 
Let us throw aside all sadness, 
Better times are on the wing, 
Who can tell what joy and gladness, 
Providence to us may bring ? 
Nerve, then, every manly feeling, 
And with courage meet the storm; 
Let us wounded hearts be healing, 
our duty still perform. 
Never, boys, &c.. 
We should not be always sighing, 
Norindulge in wild dismay; 
BeAr in mind Old Time is flying. 
Therefore wisdom more display. 
If our prospects be not shining, 
And our hearts be bowed with care, 
Where's the good in our repining ? 
Still look up and ne'er despair. 
Never, boys, &c. 
My name it is Larry, 1'm from Tipperary, 
Where the girls are so gay and the whiskey so fine, 
Bin just one-and-twenty, and I'd money plenty, 
While a 
dealer in pig's-meat and things in that line. 
Through Ireland I 
rambled, my money I 
gambled, 
Till poor as a 
beggar, without nary a 
red, 
My heart still was easy, for Delia, my daisy, 
I 
footed a 
fortniaht my darling to wed.. 
My journey ended, my steps I 
soon wended,

To the house of the loved one that stood on the hid, 
Our hearts light with joy, myself and Molloy, 
Drank health to each other till we had our filL 
Arrived at the door, what could I 
do more, 
But play off genteelly and send up my name; 
And instead of my dearest came one of the fiercest, 
An ugly old huckster, saying, " What do you mean." 
Says I, " I 
am here, without dread or fear, 
For the hand of my darling, for that sure I 
come, 
says he, " You can't have her, while me he did lathes 
Till I 
called out for mercy and hollered with pain.

You scoundrel, how dare you, with rage he did spout, 
And I 
without fail, was marched off to jail, 
That ended my loving, and now I 
am out.

MCLAUGHLIN'S PARTY. 
Ale: " The fair of Clogheen." 
OuId Ireland's is the place for a

At Mrs McLaughlin's party! 
Moll Dolan, a 
buxon young craythur, 
Had lately been raising me dandher; 
I 
met her going down, to MeGuffin's, 
To borq the loan of a 
gandher. 
The gandher the geese had been eoorting. 
She sould it to Paddy McCarty, 
To buy her a 
pair of white slippers, 
To go to McLaughlin's party. 
It's welt the flure,

For a 
week or two, I 
was preparing, 
Determined in style for to shank it. 
Put a 
pair of new tails to my coat, 
With a 
piece I 
cut off of the blanket; 
I 
turned the corduroy-breeches 
I 
borrowed from Phelim °Flaherty, 
And I 
put a 
new patch on the sate, 
For to cut a 
big swell, at the party. 
It's welt the flure, cEc. 
They hired a 
fiddler and piper, 
And stuck them on top of a 
barrel, 
With a 
jug full of whiskey between'em, 
To keep them from having a 
quarrel.

Tim Fagan got up for a 
reel, 
But he jigged it on every one's corns. 
'To try for to stop him was worse 
Than to take a 
mad bull by the horns. 
He skinned Dinny Haggerty's shins, 
Tore the skirts off Winny O'Doherty, 
And exposed the dear craythur's fat limbs 
To all the gay boys, at the party. 
It's welt the fitrre, tEc. 
Now, while they were dancing and jigging, 
Tom Cassidy burst in the dure, sir; 
Thin, the ducks and the dlirakes and the pigs, 
They came all flying in on the flure, sir! 
The ould sow it set up a

The girls laughed merry and hearty, 
While the pig balan9ayed down the middle, 
At Mrs. McLaughlin's party. 
It's welt the flure, dtc. 
Thin the party was brought to an ending. 
or, 
The fiddler fell drunk from the table; 
They carried him home on a

Tore off the dare of the stable. 
We'd an illigant fight, on the way, 
With a 
faction from Ballykillarty; 
And I'm d—d

-LOVE'S YODNG DREAM' 
Oh! the days are gone, when Beauty bright 
My heart's-chain wove; 
When my dream of life, from morn till night, 
Was love, still love. 
New hope may bloom, 
And days may come, 
Of milder, calmer beam, 
Mut there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream! 
No, there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream.. 
Tho' the bard to purer fame may soar, 
When wild youth's past, 
l'ho' he win the wise, who frown.'d before, 
a 
To smile at last; 
He'll never meet 
A 
joy so sweet, 
In all his noon of fame, 
As when first he sung to woman's ear, 
His soul-felt flame. 
And, at every close, she blush'd to hear 
The one lov'd name. 
Oh! that hallow'd form is ne'er forgot, 
Which first love trac'd; 
4rr,  
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot 
On mem'ry's waste. 
'T was odor fled 
As soon as shed ; 
'Twas morning's winged dream ; 
'Twas a

On life's dull stream ! 
Oh! 'twas light that ne'er can shine again 
On life's dull stream!

THE GREEN LINNET-
Curiosity bore a 
young native of Erin, 
To view the gay banks of the Rhine, 
When an empress he saw, and the robe she was wearing 
All over with diamonds did shine 
A 
goddess in splendor was never yet seen, 
To equal this fair one so mild and serene, 
In soft murmur she says, My sweet linnet so green, 
Are you gone—will I 
never see you more ? 
The cold lofty Alps you freely went over, 
Which Nature had placed in your way, 
That Marengo, Saloney, around you did hover, 
And Paris did rejoice the next day. 
It grieves me the hardships you did undergo, 
Over mountains you travelled all covered with snow. 
The balance of power your courage laid low, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
The crowned heads of Europe when you were in splendor, 
Fain would they have you submit 
But the Goddess of Freedom soon bid them surrender, 
And lowered the standard to your wit; 
Old Frederick's colors in France you did bring, 
Yet his offspring found shelter under your wing, 
That year in Virginia you sweetly did sing, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more ? 
That numbers of men are eager to slay you, 
Their malice you viewed with a 
smile, 
Their gold through all Europe they sowed to betray you, 
And they joined' the Mamelukes on'the Nilo.

THE GREEN LINNET,—{cosnNuED1 
Like ravens for blood their vile passions did burn, 
The orphans they slew, and caused the widow to mourn, 
They say my linnet's gone, and ne'er will return, 
is he gone, will I 
never see him more? 
When the trumpet of war the grand blast was sounding, 
You marched to the north with good will, 
To relieve the poor slave in their vile sack clothing, 
You used your exertion and skill. 
You spread out the wings of your envied train, 
While tyrants great Ccesar's old nest set in flames, 
Their own subjects they caused to eat herbs on the plains, 
Are you gone, will I 
never see you more? 
In great Waterloo, where numbers laid sprawling, 
In every field, high or low, 
Fame on her trumpets thro' Frenchmen was calling, 
Fresh laurels to place on her brow. 
Usurpers did tremble to hear the loud call. 
The third old Babe's new buildings did fall, 
The Spaniards their fleet in the harbor did call, 
Are you gone, I 
will never see you more. 
I'll roam thro' the deserts of wild Abyssinia, 
And yet find no cure for my pain. 
Will I 
go and inquire in the isle of St. Helena, 
No, we will whisper in vain. 
Tell me, you critics, now tell me in time, 
The nation I 
will range my sweet linnet to find, 
Was he slain at Waterloo, on Elba on the Rhine? 
If he was I 
will never see him more.

I

OLD LEATHER BREECHES. 
At the sign of the Bell, on the road to Clonmell, 
Paddy Flaherty kept a 
neat shebeen, 
lie sold pigs, meat and bread, and had a 
fine lodging bed, 
And so well liked round had he been, 
Himself and his wife had struggled through life— 
On week days Pat mended the ditches, 
But on Sunday he dressed in a 
coat of the best. 
But his pride was in his old leather breeches. 
For twenty-one years, or so it appears, 
His father these breeches had run in. 
The night that he died, to his bedside, 
Called Paddy his beautiful son in. 
The advice that he gave, ere he went to his grave, 
'Was for him to take care of his riches; 
Says he, It's no use to walk in my shoes, 
But I 
pray you step into my breeches.. 
Last winter's snow laid provisions so low, 
That Paddy was ate out completely, 
And the snow coming down, he could not get to town,. 
So the hunger bothered him greatly, 
One night as he lay, dreaming away 
Of big dogs, frogs and witches, 
lie heard an uproar just outside of his door, 
And he up for to pull on his breeches. 
Says Brian McG 
urk, with the voice of a 
Turk, 
Now, Paddy, come get us some eating, 
Says big Andy Moore, I'll burst open the door, 
For this is no night to be waiting. 
Just as they spoke the door went in broke, 
They crowded around Paddy like leeches, 
They swore by the magog, that if he did not get them prog 
That they would eat him right out of his breeches. 
49 
OLD LEATHER BREECHES.—[CONCLUDED] 
Paddy in dread, slipped into the bed, 
That held Judy his own darling wife in, 
Where he quickly agreed for to get them a 
feed, 
And he out and brought a 
big knife in. 
He took up the waist of his breeches, the beast, 
And he cut out the buttons and stitches, 
And cut them in stripes, in the way they do tripes, 
And boiled them his old leather breeches. 
When the breeches were stewed on a 
dish they were strewed, 
They boys all cried out, Lord-be-thanked! 
But Flaherty's wife, in dread of her life, 
She thought it high time for to shank it— 
The boys they ail smiled, for they thought Pat had boiled 
Some mutton or beef of the richest. 
But little they knew it was a 
leather burgoo, 
Made out of Paddy's old worn out breeches. 
They walloped the stuff. 
Says Darby, It's tough. 
Says Pat, you're no judge of good mutton. 
When Brian McG 
urk, on the point of a 
fork, 
Lifted up a 
big ivory button. 
Says Andy, what's that? I 
thought it was fate 
Brian jumps on his legs, and he screeches, 
By the powers above, Pm trying to shove 
My teeth through the flap of his breeches. 
They all made at Pat, he was gone out of that, 
For he ran when he gaw them all rising, 
Says Darby, make haste and go for the priest, 
By the holy jack- straws I'm poisoned. 
In revenge for the joke they up and they broke 
All the chairs, tables and dishes; 
And ever since that night they'll knock out your daylights 
If they catch you with the old leather breeches. 
PAT'S CURIOSITY SHOP. 
Did you hear tell of Paddy's Museum, 
its ancient and modern antiques? 
If not, when ye hear, ye'll see 'em, 
Of their fame all old Ireland speaks. 
I 
was always considered a 
lover 
Of antiquities, sure from my birth, 
And did somehow or other discover 
What nobody else could on earth. 
CHORUS. 
So don't talk about Barnum's Museum; 
If in passin' my house you will stop, 
There's things you'll be struck for to see 'em 
In Paddy's curiosity shop. 
I've been twinty-nine times round the globe, 
And fiver took sleep night or day 
I've had double the patience uv Job 
To bring all these relics away. 
With great kindness I 
have bin trated, 
I've bin twice kilt and shot into two, 
You'll belave it all whin I've related 
My list of curiosities through. 
So don't talk, & c. 
The relic I 
take the most pride on, 
Is ould Mother Shipton's birch broom, 
The one the mild girl would fly stride on, 
When she din'd wid the man in the Moon. 
And I've got the mattock and spade, 
Wid which Adam the ground cultivated, 
And an ould furrin' coin that was . made-
Before iver the world was created. 
So don't talk, 
I've a 
walking stick not very pliant, 
Don't fancy I'm pitchin' it strong ; 
It belonged to the Irish Giant, 
An' its just two-and-thirty foot long; 
I've his boots too, an' they are like towers, 
A 
coach you might inside them drive, 
If you'd fall in one, och ! by the powers ! 
Ye'd lifter be got out alive. 
So don't talk, drz. 
I've the bustle of Jupiter's mother, 
And \ratios the goddess's stays; 
An' I've got the steal pen, an' no other, 
Wid which Shakespeare wrote all his plays. 
I've got Dr. Dodd's kitchen table, 
I've the brains of the fam'd lamed 
I've the roof off the Tower of Babel, 
An' an Irish Ambassador's wig. • 
So don't talk, &c.

That was caught by man a 
passing by; 
I've a 
sly Cupid's dart forged at Gretna, 
An' the lash of Pope Gregory's eye, 
I've the toe-nail of ugly Mahomet, 
I've the -.1thiskers off Whittington's cat, 
I've got Miss Queen Elizabeth's bonnet, 
An' ould Mother Hubbard's cock'd hat.

Widout aither damage or hurt ; 
I've a 
handkerchief Mars blew his nose on, 
An' the Queen Otaheita's she-shirt. 
An' I've got King Laertes's bowl, 
That'll hold twenty gallons or more; 
An' the very identical rcll, 
That the baker gave Mrs. Jane Shore. 
So don't talk, esze. 
I've got all sorts of relics and stones, 
I've got patch'd coats widout any stitches; 
I've a 
portion of Gulliver's bones, 
An' a

I HAVE NO MOTHER NOW. 
I've no mother now, I'm weeping— 
She has left me here alone.; 
She beneath the sod is sleeping— 
Now, there is no joy at home. 
Tears of sorrow long have started, 
Her bright smile no more I'll see— 
And the loved ones, too, have parted; 
Where, oh, where is joy for me ? 
CHORUS. 
Weeping lonely, she has left me here; 
Weeping lonely for my Mother, dear. 
Oh ! how well do I 
remember— 
" 
Take this little flower," said she, 
" 
And when with the dead I'm numbered, 
" 
Place it at my grave for me." 
Dearest Mother, I 
am sighing, 
On thy tomb I 
drop a 
tear— 
For, the little plant is dying— 
Now, I 
feel so lonely here ! 
Weeping lonely, &c. 
I've no mother, still I'm weeping, 
Tears my furrowed cheeks now lave, 
WhiIst a 
lenely watch I'm keeping, 
O'er her sad and silent grave. 
Soon, I 
hope, will be our meeting, 
Then the gladness none can tell 
Who for me will then be weeping, 
When I 
bid this world farewell P 
Weeping lonely, &c.

Oh, happy, happy be thy path in life, 
Long still thy mother's tender love to share; 
Till Heaven has called her from this vale of strife, 
And purer bliss succeed to worldly care! 
Then, if the Angels earth-ward turn their eyes, 
She will watch o'er thee from the radiant skies. 
Sleep—while yon Star still o'er thee mildly beams, 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams!

KATIE'S SECRET.. 
LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
The Spring bad come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out thcir lay; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Magwie May; 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day : 
And how I 
loved her! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
ClIORUS: 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day. 
Oh ! how I 
love her! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching„ &c. 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May. 
Bly little witehingjEre. 
The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
And sweetly the flowers bloom to-day, 
-And birds in the branches of hawthorn, 
Are caroling ever so gay: 
And down by the rock in the meadow, 
The rill ripples by with a 
song; 
And, Mother, I, too, have been singing, 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night I 
was weeping alone: 
The world was so dark and so dreary, 
My heart it grew heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was I. 
I 
scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
But, oh! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered: Come out in the moonlight, 
I've something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh! Mother, to him I 
am dearer 
Than all in the wide world beside ; 
He told me so out in the moonlight, 
And called me his darling, his bride. 
So now I 
will gather my roses, 
And twine in my long braided hair: 
Then Willie will come in the evening, 
And smile when lie sees me so fair— 
And out in the inoonth ,ht we'll wander, 
Way down by the old hawthorn-tree. 
Oh! Mother I 
wonder if any

Queen of every heart; 
Oh! ever be happy and light as thou art, 
Never from its depart! 
Queen, queen of the faithful heart. 
Ever be happy, &c.

BONNY ELOISE, THE BELLE OF THE MOHAWK 
VALE. 
Sweet is the vale where the Mohawk gently glides, 
On the clear winding way to the sea, 
And dearer than all storied streams on earth besides, 
Is this bright rolling river to me. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Bale of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the scenes of my boyhood's sunny hour, 
That bespangle the gay valley o'er, 
And dear are the friends seen thro' memory's fond tears, 
That have lived in the blest days of yore. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the moments when dream'ng I 
roam, 
Through my loved haunts now mossy and grey, 
And dearer than all is my childhood's hallowed home, 
That is crumbling now s141; away. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale.

THE PRETTY GAL DRESSED IN BLUE. 
I 
once did lub a 
yaller gal, her name I 
do not know, 
I 
meet her ebery ebening, no matter where I 
go. 
She wears a 
white lace handkerchief, 
It's marked with eye and you. 
know her if I 
see her. 
Kase she's always dressed in blue. 
CHORUS. 
She's set di s 
darkey crazy, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
If I 
could find dat pretty yaller gal 
Dat I 
saw dressed in blue. 
I 
met her in the street one day, 
She looked at me so sly, 
And when de bosses gin to jump, 
Dey both begin to shy. 
They jumped, they pitched, they reared, they went, 
And down de street dey flew, 
And passed dat pretty yaller gal 
Dat I 
saw dressed in blue. 
She's set die darkey, &e. 
If I 
could find her name, 
And where she does belong 
I'll write by telgraph 
De verses ob my song; 
But if I 
do not find her, 
My heart will bent and woo, 
Then I'll sigh, and bid good bye 
To dat pretty yaller gal dressed in blue. 
She's set dis darkey, &c. 
THOU ART GONE FROM MY GAZE. 
Thou art gone from my gaze like a 
beautiful dream, 
And I 
seek thee in vain by the meadow and stream, 
Oft I 
breathe thy dear name to the winds floating by,t 
But thy sweet voice is mute to my bosom's lone sigh. 
In the stillness of night when the stars mildly shine, 
My heart fondly holds sweet communion with thine, 
For I 
feel thou art near and where'er I 
may be, 
That the spirit of love keeps a 
watch over me. 
THOU BAST LEARNED TO LOVE ANOTHER. 
Than bast learned to love another— 
Thou bast broken every vow— 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now. 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile bath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget, 
Oh I 
is it well to sever 
This heart from thine for ever, 
Can I 
forget thee ? never! 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have seen thy new found treasure, 
And I've gazed upon thy bride. 
Thy looks were stern and altered— 
Thy words ran cold and high, 
flow my traitor courage faltered, 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
Would I 
ne'er had met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
'Tv.-ere folly to regret thee; 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met and and we have parted, 
Yet I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well known voice I 
beard. 
I 
have marked the timid lustre, 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was nigh. 
Oh, woman's love may grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life is fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell for ever.

HERE'S A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW FOR 
THEE. 
When a 
boy but twelve years old, I 
worked hard to support 
my mother and two younger brothers, and usually carried my 
earnings home every evening. 
One night, it being very dark 
and muddy, and having three miles to travel and a 
heavy bun-
dle to carry, I 
did not reach home until late. 
My mother. 
feeble and weary, had retired, but she quickly aroused when 
she heard my foot-stps and voice, and soon met me at the 
door, with a 
warm kiss and warmer tears, and a: " God bless 
you, my boy." As she received my bundle, she exclaimed: 
" 
After this, my son, I'll set a 
light in the window for you." 
And, true to her word, the bright light in the window ap-
peared, and oh ! how it cheered my heart ever after, for years ! 
Health failing me, I 
left home, ( after my other brothers could 
help mother.) and went to sea. 
When three years from home 
and on the Pacific Ocean, my mother died; but just before she 
expired, she said to those around her: " Oh! give Edward my 
dying blessing: for, he has been a 
good boy; tell him 1 have 
gone to Heaven, and I 
will set a 
light in the 'window for 
him." 
'There's a 
light in the window for thee, brother, 
There's a 
light in the window for thee: 
A dear one has moved to the mansions above: 
There's a 
light in the window for thee. 
CHORUS. 
A mansion in Heaven we see, 
And a 
light in the window for thee; 
A mansion in Heaven we see, 
And a 
light in the window for thee. 
There's a 
crown, and a 
robe, and a 
palm, brother; 
'When from toil and from care you are free, 
The Saviour has gone to prepare you a 
home, 
With a 
light in the window for thee. 
A mansion, &c. 
Oh! watch, and be faithful, and pray, brother, 
All your journey o'er life's troubled sea; 
Though afflictions assail you. and storms beat severe, 
There's a 
light in the window for thee. 
A mansion, &c. 
Then on, perseveringly on, brother. 
Till from conflict and suffering free; 
Bright Angels now beckon you over the stream; 
There's a 
light in the window for thee. 
A mansion,_&c.

SUSAN'S SUNDAY OUT. 
Oh sha'n't I 
be de-light-ed just when Sunday comes, I 
know; 
I 
wish it would make haste and come, but ' tis so pre-cious 
slow. 
No doubt, you will de-sire to know what it's really all about ? 
The fact is that Next Sunday is my Susan's SuuLlay out. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Ge-mi-ni, en-key, blow me tight, I 
always dance and shout. 
It fills my heart with great delight, when it's Susan's Sunday out; 
Repeat. ) 
My Susan is a 
kitchen-maid, and lives in Washington-Square; 
She's eyes like sloes, a 
turn-up nose, and a 
carroty head of hair; 
She's often taken for a 
Queen, as with me she walks about, 
And I 
always feel so happy when it's Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh! Gemini, erikey, &c. 
She must have lots of perquisites: for, she brings me lots of 
meat, 
Tho' sometimes in the summer time they isn't over sweet; 
She keeps me well in Pannum; that's what makes me look so 
stout— 
And don't I 
just blow out my kite on Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh! G,unini, crikey, &e. 
And all the loose tobacco she finds in the empty jars, 
She gives to me and som-times britus a 
bundle of cigars; 
She says they're all her perquisites. which, of course, I 
do not 
doubt, 
And sometimes wish that oftener ' twas Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh I 
Gemini, crikey, &c. 
Her perquisites extends to clothes: for, she brings me bang up 
suits— 
Coats, Trowsers, Shirts, and Waistcoats, 'Umbrellas, Hats and 
Boots. 
Says she : Master he can't wear ern now, acos he's'got so stout: 
So he gave em to me to give to you, when 'twas my Sunday out. 
Oh! Gemini, crikey, &c. 
Her mistress and the young ones are often out of town: 
Then I 
goes into the kitchen and to tea with her .1 
sit down— 
Her master he can't come down stairs, he's always got the gout: 
And sometimes two or three times a 
week, it's Susan's Sunday 
out. 
Oh I 
Gemini, crikey, &c. 
We've got an eye to business and are already beginning 
To stock a 
pretty little shop with lots of Baby- Linen. 
She says: It may be wanted—and it will, I 
have no doubt; 
For married we intend to be on Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh! Gemini, crikey, &c.

BlY LOVE NELL. 
Ant—" Come all ye." 
Oh! come all, you boys, both far and near, 
And listen a 
while to me: 
And a 
dismal story you will hear 
About my love and me. 
I 
coorted long.. my love was sthrong 
As the heart of a 
big oak three; 
But sorry I'm to say 
My love is gone away 
To the shores av Amer-i-kay. 
CHORUS. 
For, my love Nell 
Was a 
eltermin' girl: 
From the cove av Cork kern she. 
But I 
weeped and I 
veiled 
Whin the big ship sailed • 
For the shores av America. 
Whin I 
got to the church, 
I 
was left in the lurch.. 
But let that day go by; 
Whin I 
got to the door, 
Nelly sez; I'm poor! 
Then, my love, sez I, good-bye! 
For, I 
know right well 
You're an Irish girl; 
So, you don't come over me. 
Oh! sez Nelly, d'ye mind, 
I'll lave you far behind, 
And I'll sail for America. 
For, my love Nell, &c. 
Now, come all, ye boys, both far and near, 
And a 
warnin' take by me: 
A bird in the hand, as you may undherstand, 
Is worth twinty thousand million on a 
three. 
Though persuade you they may for to name the day, 
Then say, Wait till the time suits me. 
Then as slippery as an eel, they'll turn on their lied, 
And sail for America. 
For, my love Nell, ezo, 
Oh! so young and fair, with her bright golden. hair! 
Words by C. C. BUTLER. 
Music by S. 
W ESLEY':M ARTIN. 
Let the dead and the beau tiful 
rest, 
Make her grave 'neath the 
w il low 
by 
the 
stream, 
Where the wind-harps 
w ill whisper o'er the blest, 
Like the song of some Angel 
i
n 
our 
dream. 
DUETT 
Oh! so young and fair, with her bright gold,en. hair! 
CHORUS. 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream: 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
."Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest: 
For, the Spring-time is coming with its flowers, 
When the wild-rose will blossom o'er her breast, 
As the song- birds will while away the hours. 
Repeat Duett and Chorus. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Where the long drooping willow branches wave; 
While the moon, slowly sinking in. the West, 
Leaves the stars keeping vigils o'er her grave.

, JESSIE, THE BELLE AT THE BAR. 
'Twas at a 
rail road station, in pursuit of ray vocaticn, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl, who stood behind the bar. 
I 
heard some one calf. her Jessie, perhaps, ' twas Mr. Pond, the lessee, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling, just like the evening star. 
I 
found this pretty dame made love to all that came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way, with her eyes so sort and bright. 
She had lovers half a 
score, always some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning, till the last train out at night. 
SroKEN.—Yes, her admirers were, 
CDORCS. 
A tinker and a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor, 
And a 
swell who used to talk about his pa and his ma,. 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet looking quaker, 
Al! courted pretty Jessie at the rail•road bar, 
Now 
this darling little creature, with a 
smile on every feature, 
•Vt'as .serving all tho customers with cakes and bitter beer, 
And this was on a 
Monday; so, I 
asked her if on Sunday 
She would meet me at the Park gate, when she gave me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, " most happy I 
should be, 
But l'm sorry to inform you that it's not my Sunday out; 
One Sunday out of nine is the only day that's mine;" 
And then he had to leave me 
just to serve a 
glass of stout.. 
SPOKES.—Yes, but she never informed me that she had on previous 
Sundays walked out with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Well, better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was clever, 
To get Jessie dear to meet me, when it was her Sune.ay out, 
With toy hair curled and anointed, at the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, and began to look about— 
And when my Jessie came, my heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her water- fall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my 
arm, I 
admired her every charm— 
But judge of my surprise, when I 
heard some urchins say. 
SroKsx.—I say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie, along with another awed! 
why, I've seen her with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Now my confidence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys mistiken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true. 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely hid from me her eyes so blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding dress, fit for an Empress. 
And saw the porter give it her, while serving at the bar, 
But on our wedding- day, Miss Jessie ran away 
And got married to a 
man who sold the HERALD and the STAR! 
SPOSEN.—Yes, and the only consolation I 
had was, she had taken its 
besides myself, 
A tinker, etc.
