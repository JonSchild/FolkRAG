This River 
  
Runs west and 
Counter to every story I drank 
Deep in those small doll days 
Strange, heavy with collective 
Unconscious with all of those 
West running, improbable relations spending 
Lavish hands worth of emotion on this imagined 
West in this city which also 
Runs west into an ocean that I 
Own no stories for, borrowed ocean full of 
Marvels fed by these long men who collect different 
Water who polish stones that won't tell me the 
Future in any language I know
