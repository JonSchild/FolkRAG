MISS JENNIE HUGHES. 
Naturally gifted with a 
good voice and love for singing, she 
was early placed under the instruction of one of our most famous 
operatic artists, and so far prepared as to make an early debut 
in the ‘• Freischnetz" at the Academy in Philadelphia. 
After 
singing in concerts. she finally took an engagement at Niblo's 
Theatre, for the purpose of learning stage business, but with 
no idea of becoming an actress. 
Fate, however, decreed other-
wise. 
At that time Balfe's ballad of Killarney, in the drama of 
Innisfallen, was at the height of its popularity. 
Miss Hughes 
saw , 
the beautiful melodies and made a 
decided hit both as 3VOCa-
list and actress, playing during her engagement at Niblo's with 
Mr. Fechter, the Lydia Thompson Troupe, and Barney and 
Mrs. Williams. 
Then she appeared at The theatre Comique, under the man-
agement then of Mr. Butler, now of the Metropolitan, and 
after remaining a steady favorite for three years, returned 
to the old management of Mr. Butler at the Metropolitan, 
where she is now received nightly with rapturous shouts of ap-
plause. 
tier voice is a 
mezzo-soprano and posssing complete con-
trol, she has long since learned the .secret of singing in such a 
manner as to keep within the comprehension of the humblest 
individual in her audience. 
In one word, she sings as an edu-
cated musician, without forgetting that her audiences do not 
want to hear, and will not appreciate, outlandish and operatic 
interpolations. 
Aside from her vocalism, she is always a 
wel-
come actress in farces an 1 
eoincdiettas. 
Personally gifted with .-
ood features and form, educated as a 
lady, kind-hearted, forbearing and generous with her colleagues. 
she made many friends among them, even to the extent of 
dulling the pointed shaft of envy. 
In the general public she 
has hosts of admirers and numerous warm personal friends. 
The mere fact of havin- held her position as the favorite serio-
comic singer amonr: the tickled- minded p:trons of a 
vaudeville 
theatre for nearly four years sufficiently attests her worth,

fee - tions on 
the 
girl 
I love 
so 
well. 
Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her waist—steal a 
gentle kiss, 
And whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart? 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, &c. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then robe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so 
sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle 
bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho. —It's all among the clover, &c. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you 
half so well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
with bliss, 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss. 
Mo.—It's all among the clover, Sc.

Moonlight, Starlight, Daylight. 
Sung by JENNIE nCTIMES. 
WHILE going thro' this brilliant world, 
So many lights we see, 
There's moonlight and there's starlight, 
And daylight makes the three ; 
They are the three great lights, we're told, 
At least we'll let them be ; 
For daylight is a 
jolly time, 
And moonlight shines so free. 
CHORUS. 
Moonlight, starlight, daylight or other lights. 
Rushlight, sunlight no matter what they be, 
Gaslight, nightlight. candlelight or Linelh2)it, 
Skylight, lamplight, are pleasant unto me. 
First moonlight shines so brightly, 
The stars they glitter so ; 
The daylight shows us daily, 
Wherever we do go : 
The gaslight burns so gaily 
While the ruslilight's glimmer glow : 
The best and dearest of all things, 
8 
Is light that we all know. 
Moonlight, starlight, 4-
,e. 
One day I 
purposed that I'd go, 
The Palace for to see : 
The son was shining bright that day : 
The birds sung out their glee, 
The day it pass'd, the evening came, 
While sitting down to tea, 
A 
bird came whistling in my ear, 
And singing merrily. 
Moonlight, starlight, SLc, 
It shines on man and woman, 
It shines on cattle too: 
But most I 
hope sincerely, 
It shines on all of you: 
It shines on houses, and on lands, 
The waters meet it's viuw 
how pleasant of a 
sunny day, 
When the sky it looks so blue. 
Moonlight, starlight, ..tc.

MY WAISK-AWS. 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
PM a 
languid Swell, as you may perccive, 
The hearts of the fair ones I 
break ; 
My vows of affection and love they believe, 
As I 
swear I'll be true for their sake; 
And oh! how they dote on my figaw divine, 
As gaily I 
waltz and I 
frisk—haw, haw, 
And quickly, (if asked,) they'd agrec to be mine--
For who could withstand such a 
whisk-aw? 
CHORUS. 
The lovely whisk-aws that deck my face 
And to my appearance add infinite grace, 
I 
hear it said as I 
pass each place, 
By Jove! what lovely whisk-aws. 
At the sea-side once I 
met a 
fair, 
Whose form divine I'll ne'er forget, 
Her teeth were pearls, her waving hair 
In color might vie with deepest jet; 
To a 
ball one night I 
chanced to go, 
And as near I 
beheld her frisk, [ON, haw! 
Her fan, as waltzing, she whirled to ano fro 
Once gently brushed my whisk-aws. 
The lovely whisk-aws, 
Her name and position I 
soon fully learn'd, 
And a 
friend's introduction I 
quickly obtained, 
10 
Whenever we met great attention I 
paid, 
And concluded her heart I 
had certainly gained; 
So the question I 
popped, swore to win her I'd die, 
• 
And implored her to answer me brisk haw! 
' 
But judge my dismay, when I 
heard her reply— 
On condition you shave off your whisk-aw. 
SPOREN.—Yes, by jove! I 
addressed her as follows : Dear 
Araminta, ask me to bring you a 
wrinkle from the brow of a 
bill, the*Iver wings of a 
butterfly from the Arctic regions, the 
cngated eaws of the powny Jerusalem, the beard of Prophet 
Mahommed from the sacred shrine at Mecca—these individually 
and collectively will I 
do to prove my adoration, but by Jove! 
you know don't ask a 
fella 
ii to sacrifice 
The lovely whisk-aws &c. 
She replied with a 
glance of infinite scorn, 
That the sooner my visit was ended 
'Twould be better for both, as ' twas evident, quite, 
Our feelings could never be blended: 
And her happiness she was unwilling to stake, 
And future existence to risk, aw, haw! 
With one who refused to part for her sake, 
With a 
trifle so slight as his whisk-aw. 
The lovely whisk-aws, Szz.

THE G., P. 0. 
Sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
IN St: Martins le Grand as you all well know, 
Is the building that's known as the G. P. 0. 
Where billet-doux, Valentines, and Tailor's bills too 
Before they ever reach us must pass through ; 
A 
party was employed there whose sorrowful tale, 
Would touch a 
heart of flint, through a 
douple coat of mail, 
His surname it was Johnson, his other name was Joe, 
And he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
Now Joe became spooney on a 
good-looking lass, 
Whose father was a 
dealer in crockery and glass, 
He often thought of marriage, though his screw was low, 
(He received " one pound per week" at the G. P. 0!) 
But her parent was ambitious, and nearly drop'd 
With horror when poor Joe, " the awful question" pop.cl, 
What! think I'll give my Che-ild to one so low, 
I 
mean her for a 
Big Gun in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
'-'i're but a 
letter sorter with the common name of Joe 
kilF•111614

13 
I 
REALY DON'T THINK I 
SHALL MARRY, 
From that cruel old Coger, poor Joe then rushed, 
His plans sent to smithereens, his hopes all crushed, 
At his " official duties" no longer was lie gay, 
Ile was " going to the dogs " the fellows would say; 
He was always making blunders, always doing wrong, 
The letters meant for Manchester, he sent to Boulogne, 
What should have gone to Charing Cross, turned up at Jericho. 
So they had to kick him out of the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City when the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
No more a 
letter sorter was the young man Joe. 
The girl who'd been the cause of his sorrows and his ills, 
Was poisoned with a 
box of Kamptulicon Pills, 
Her father became bankrupt, and wild with his losses, 
Sent a sixpence to " the Claimant," then took to backing 
horses; 
My melancholy story is drawing to a 
close, 
Joe meditated suicide to finish up his woes, 
He went and paid his Income Tax, and then did go, 
And cut his elbow with a 
post card near the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And that was the finale of the young man Joe. 
COME listen to me, and I'm sure you'll agree, 
'Tis a 
shame that I 
longer shall tarry, 
The beaux I 
can find, yet not one to my mind, 
So I 
really don't think I 
shall marry. 
There's Edward so gay, that he never can pay, 
Such attention to one girl in twenty, 
And then his long hair, such a 
fright I 
declare, 
If half off, he would then have quite plenty. 
CHORUS. 
• 
Come listen to me, and I'm sure you'll agree, 
'Tis a 
shame that I 
longer shall tarry, 
The beaux I 
can find, yet not one to my mind, 
So I 
really don't think I 
shall marry. 
There's Arthur now mind, who thinks he's refined, 
And says he speaks French like a 
native, 
But he turns in his toes, and wears very queer clothea, 
Tell stories and so imitative; 
Indeed the whole set me quite in a 
pet, 
I've no doubt, you'll all own I 
have reason, 
So leave just as these, to do just as they please, 
And wait till some are in good season. 
Come listen to me, Sco.

THE SONG OF THE FLAGS. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, at the Opera House. 
And by JENNIE HUGHES, at the Metropolitan Theatre. 
TFIERE'S a 
nation of brave people held in bond against their 
will, 
But to them will come a 
day of liberty, 
When to the world they can proclaim their little Emerald 
Isle, 
As added to the nations of the free, 
Our sympathies are with them for Americans believe, 
That the laws of God and man, have been profaned, 
When the governed have to suffer and are held in cruel bonds, 
By laws against their interest maintained. 
(Irish Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, a 
flag of liberty, 
All friends of Erin now do drink a 
ruby toast to thee. 
There's a 
nation of brave people from the storied river Rhine, 
Whose emigrants are welcome to our land, 
They are law-abiding citizens, the very last in war, 
And in peace the first to give a 
Identity band, 
Of Europe's civilization they are the greatest nation, 
I 
hope a 
Republic they'll soon be, 
For they're people that we love, and will like to see them free. 
As those in this great land of liberty. 
(Cr'erman Hag.) 
Then here's the flag of Germany, floating proudly free, 
May "Die 1Vacht am Rhein," be one day sung, in the Halls of 
Liberty. 
15 
Thrre's a 
band of noble patriots by Spanish tyrants ruled, 
Who are fighting to gain their liberty, soon with victory they'll 
be crowned, 
For they've many honest friends in America, the home of the 
free, 
Our flag has been insulted, and we'll show these Spanish dons, 
That the time has now arrived we're not afraid, 
The Virginius and her crew we'll speedily avenge, 
And to poor suffering Cuba lend our aid, 
(Cuban Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, so very dear you are, 
May soon in freedom proudly float, the flag of a 
single star. 
There's a 
country of brave people, 
Who stand head upon the list, 
Of any throughout this mighty world, 
She's a 
refuge for the oppressed, 
From every other land, 
And for freedom her banner is unfurled, 
Our centennial anniversary, we shortly tope to write, 
Upon the immortal scroll of fame, 
In memory of the•blessings bequeathed by Washington, 
Then forever revered be his name, 
(American Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of America, the flag of Washington. 
The greatest flag throughout the world, that e'er the sun shown 
on.

Written and Sting by Tax FIELDING% 
GOOD evening to you, one and all,

And mine 'tis Biddy McGee, 
Do you want a

Then lep up by me side, 
Oh! murder, ain't she nate,

CHORUS. 
Now we're off for Donneybrook, 
For to see the fair, 
Ind won't we have a 
jolly time, 
With the boys and girls there, 
We'll dance and sing and whiskey drink, 
Till our hearts are free from care: 
There is no such fun where e'er you go, 
As you'll find at an Irish fair. 
Then lep aboard, then hop aboard, 
Who'll have a 
jaunting car, 
Hurrah! for Dan O'Malley,

A

MY MEMORY IS SO BAD, 
As sung by JENNIE H OGIISS. 
FOLKS says Pm growing querulous, a 
regular cross-grained 
patch, 
Because 
I'm troubled with the gout, and wear a wig—a 
scratch; 
But worse than that, they spread reports, 
they say they've 
heard from me, 
Which cause a 
deal of mischief, but with truth do not agree; 
I'm sure I 
never dreamt of such, it really makes me sad, 
4ro tkink,—what was I 
saying then ? my mem'ry is so bad. 
My mem'ry is so bad, it really makes makes me sad— 
To think what I 
was saying then? my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh I 
remember, Tuesday, ne, 'twas Wednesday thereabout, 
I 
heard on good authority, the President is coming out,— 
At opera and at Concert to, his gracious Majesty 
Will smile upon his subjects true, as once it used to be; 
Now p'haps you think I 
made this up, which sounds like news 
most glad, 
I 
heard it,—though I 
can't say where, my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh! dear its very sad, it nearly drives me mad 
can't tell where I 
heard it, for my mem'ry is so bad. 
I 
took a 
cab the other day, and told him where to go 
'Twas Saratoga or Niagara,—but I 
found myself at Troy, 
In vain I 
stormed, he coolly said,—" I'd bade 1,:m drive me 
there,' 
19 
When in the dense excitement, I 
forgot to pay his fare! 
He might have asked politely, not in terms as he were mad, 
Then summoned me, I'd costs to pay—my mem'ry is so bad. 
lie served me very bad, and no redress I 
had, 
The Magistrate said I 
must pay, since my mem'ry was 
so bad. 
I 
once fell over head aud hears in love, but even th2n, 
My great midortune hauntel me—most wretched of all 
me ; 
The day was fixed, I 
bought the ring, when dreadful to relate, 
I 
reached the Church, but found I 
came just two days after 
date, 
Of course a Breach of Promise Case they brought, and so 
had— 
Five hundred dollars to pay, because my mem'ry is so bad. 
It really was too bad, to pay of course I 
had, 
Five hundred dollars, and all because my mem'ry is so

gallant bark, 
Roy Neil and his fair young bride, 
lie had ventured all in that bounding ark 
That t'an -;ed o'er the silvery tide; 
But L's he trt was young, and his spirit ligl 
And he dashed the tear away, 
As he watched the shore recede from sigi.t, 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sailed, rind a 
storm arose, 
And the lightning swept the deep, 
And the thunder crash broke the short rep 333 
Of the weary sea bo.

Roy Neill, he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed her tears away. 
Oh ! Love, 'twas a 
fatal hour, she cried, 
When we left sweet Dublin Bay! 
On the crowded deck of the doomed ship, 
Some stood in their mute despair; 
And some, more calm, with a 
holy lip, 
Sought the God of the storm in prayer. 
She has struck on a 
rock! the seaman cried, 
In the breath of their wild dismay— 
And the ship went down, and the fair young bride 
That sailed from Dublin Bay.

MISTER BARNEY, 
MISTER BARNEY, one day, went to Limerick fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan. 
But She!all had waited some time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been playing with Katty Molloy, 
To tell him her mind thus began : 
"Och! Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Hands of and don't be so free; 
You've been with the girls. 
Your muffin-face tells, 
And the devil may have you for me, Mister Barney," 
Mister Barney, who little thought thus to be used, 
Made an oath that his honor and words she abused, 
And could she be Shelah Megan ? 
Then running to kiss her— She cried: " if you're wise, 
Don't touch me! or, Barney, I'll scratch out your eyes--
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked mall; 
So Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Hands off! and dun't be so free: 
You've been with the girls, 
Your baby-face tells, 
d 
the devil may have you for me, Mister Barney." 
Mister Barney then pulled out a 
bit of a 
rope, 
And told her: " that since he had nothing to hope, 
He'd hang up for Shelah Megan." 
But Shelah, grown softer, his purpose to check, 
Cried: " No ! if you hanz, let it be round my neck, 
Theugh, Bartley, arn't you a 
sad man ? 
Och! Mister Barney, 
Pretty-faced Barney, 
And is it the ring there I 
see? 
We'll ride in the noddy 
To Father O'Toddy, 
And married—och ! no, we won't be—Mister Barney !" 
0, MOLLY DAWN, 
why leave me Oiling, 
Or lonely waiting here for you, 
While the stars above are brightly 41ining, 
Because they've nothing else to do. 
The flowers late were open keeping, 
To try a

But their mother, Nature, kept them sleeping, 
With their rosy faces washed in dew.

While the stars above are brightly shining, 
Because they've nothing else_to do. 
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, dear. 
And the pretty stars v0p.e

The pretty girls were made for boys, dear, 
And may be you were made for mine. 
The wicked Watch dog here is snarling, 
He takes me for a

For he knows I'd steal you, Molly 'darling, 
And then transported I 
should be.

PICCADILLY. 
Sung by MISS J
ENNIE EsaEL. 
SOME fella's think the Zoo's the spot 
For the " creme de la creme" 
And crawl into the monkey house, 
To hear their brothers scream ! 
While some declare that Belgrave Square's 
The Eden ot the West, 
To meet with swells and dashing belles 
But by Jove, I 
know the best 
SPOKEN.—The locality I 
refer to is. 
to 
OnORUS. 
Piccadilly, Piccadilly! 
For elegant swells and the fairest of belles, 
Piccadilly. Piccadilly, 
That's where I 
reside when in town. 
Sometimes I 
do a 
gentle crawl, 
By Jove, I've gone that far, 
That I 
have nearly knocked against 
That horrid Temple Bar; 
At once I've hail'd a 
Hansom 
" 
Haw, cabby, heaw. come heaw, 
Oh! drive me home directly or 
By Jove, I 
shall be queer." 
SPOKEN.--Where tol confound the fella, why of course 
Piccadilly, &c, 
Sometimes into the Burlington 
Arcade a 
fellow drops, 
Because a 
fella cannot hear 
The common sort of shop.-.-., 
- 
2 
43 
The doosed beadle knows me there 
As he walks up and down, 
He'll call me captain, touch his hat 
And that costs half a 
crown. 
SPOKEN.-- Of course a fella must spend half-a 
crown 
now and then especially if he resides in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
One meets in Piccadilly, folks 
Who are well known at court, 
No retired tallow chandlers then_ 
No vulgar trading sort 
A legacy enables me 
To mix with the elite 
And many a 
fair charmer there 
I'm fortunate to meet. 
SPOKEN.—Among my aristocratic acquaintances I 
num-
ber the Honorable Priscilla Pimple, Lady Dudley Dood-
lem, the Duchess of Cowcrosshire, and many other first-
class people, and they all reside in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
But this butterfly existence now 
With me will soon be past, 
For Hymen soon will bind me 
In his rosy fetters fast; 
I 
shall shortly pop the question, 
To the child of an M. P. 
I'm sure to be accepted, so 
It's all U. P. with me. 
5POKEN.—But I 
suppose a 
fella ong-lin't to grumble at 
the present of a 
fair creature and a " plum" a 
year. 
Proper 
weddings are generally done at Hanover Square, but I 
mean to patronize the little church in

STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
As sung by EDDY NORWOOD. 
OF course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands deal, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swella, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
Cmortes. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, lisening to the band, 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
in coot or heat there's nought to beat, a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A 
lovely lady fair 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumptan Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty queen, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
Strol.Mg, 
She placed her clothes upon the beach 
And then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Oh! wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
Strolling &c, 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my ite." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun; 
We're lovers now--and soon we two 
Are going to be one. 
Strolling, &c.

PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sung by J. H. RYAN, now performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, as " Rory Via Rover.” 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shilielah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
116 calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
CHORITS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah 1 
for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
Aft night on.a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,hurrah! none like Pat can be, ha 1 
ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor rat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, &c. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes 'round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep t<• 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, & c.

And when the sun shines o'er the Ica, 
Bring thy sweet mate and live with no. 
Then we will sing, 
Daylight to bring, 
Then we will sing.

I'M thinking now of olden times, 
When you and I 
were young, 
Of the school- house porch where oft we played, 
The many songs we sung; 
The small green plot before the door, 
Where oft we skipped and run, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
Of the village church whose silver-chimes, 
Ile-echoed through the dell, 
The moss-grown rock of olden tImert„ 
That stood beside the well; 
The creeping ivy evergreen, 
To the ruined mill it hung, 
in childhood's merry happy daps, 
When you and I 
were young. 
The village church has passed away, 
The bells no more resound, 
The ivy from the ruined mill 
Lies scattered on the ground; 
The school-house porch, where oft rre pl.;yed, 
With laughter, how it rung, 
Is changed, alas, like everythin-/, 
&Lee you and I 
were young.

Songs of praise, and joy, and love, 
And I 
think I

In that land beyond the sky, 
Where the sun shines always brightly, 
Ad

Their voices sing of peace and love. 
Angel hands shall bear your darling,

Mother, closer now they hover. 
And sweetly fan my fever'd brow, 
And with gentle voices call me, 
Must we part, dear mother, now ; 
Must I 
leave you here in sorrow. 
With your poor heart sick and sore, 
And live forever with the angels, 
On yon bright and golden shore. 
Veeping, mother, &c. 
By OSCAR W ILLIS. 
Sung by ADA W RAY. 
YOU may talk your best of friends, but the only one to 
me 
Is the money in your pocket-book as you can plainly see; 
For when a 
man is flush of cash, and money he can lend, 
He's courted by a 
score of men who claims to he his 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So never let yourself run short, 
And all your money spend, 
For when its known that you are broke, 
You haven't got a 
friend. 
If sickness lays a 
hold of you, and your purse it has run 
low, 
If you ask some one to wait on you, they do it very slow; 
But don't they go it with a 
rush when you've plenty cash 
to spend, 
What is it I 
can do for you. you know I 
am your friend. 
So never let yourself run short, & c. 
So now pray all take my advice and never do get rash. 
But always try and manage to hold on to all your cash, 
For what I 
say you know is true, as through this world 
you wend, 
They all can say just what they may, but your money is 
your friend. 
So never let yourself run short, &c.

FAREWELL TO ERIN. 
Words by G. L. Srorrc. 
Music by II . 
W ANNEMACTLER. 
Sung by JENNIE E UGUES. 
FAREWELL to thee Erin, dear home of my childhood. 
Farewell to thy valleys, thy mountains and hills ; 
Farewell to thy lakes and thy evergreen wildwood. 
Farewell to thy brooks and thy murmuring rills; 
No more shall I 
dwell in the land of my sires, 
No more thy green banner above me shall wave; 
Forever is quenched freedom's bright fires, 
For thy tyrants have doomed me the life of a 
slave. 
In exile and bondage in my dreams still I 
wander, 
To every loved object will fond memory soar ; 
And on thy lost glories forever will ponder, 
Dear land of my fathers, old Erin-go-Bragh ! 
But the battle is over, and the cause we have fought for 
Is lost to us now, yet one boon would I 
crave, 
That still I 
may find what in battle I 
sought for, 
A 
grave ' neath thy shamrock, not the fate of a 
slave. 
Thy green velvet cheek that is kissed by the ocean, 
Nov,- fastly is fading away from my sight; 
But with tears and with sighs and heartfelt emotion, 
I 
wish thee, dear country, forever good 
To the land of the stranaer in bondage they bear me, 
Yet grant me, kind heaven, the boon that I 
crave, 
Break thoucdt my heart ; but this agony spare me, 
Let me die as a 
freeman, and not as a 
slave.

Oh ! faithless, heartless, truthless Ben, 
I 
had been happy with my friend, 
If I 
ne'er had met you, faithless Ben. 
IIe used to work in daddy's field, 
A mowing of the new-cut hay, 
And at nightfall we would meet, 
When dad and mom had crone away. 
There in the clover on his knees, 
lie vowed his heart was mine, and when 
His father's ships came o'er the seas, 
He'd take and make me Mrs Ben. 
Oh ! fickle- hearted Benj:Lmin, 
But his vows to me were all a 
lie, 
his father had no ships at sea, 
And now I'm only left to sigh, 
For he has robbed both dad and me— 
Dad of his watch, me of my heart, 
And if I 
only meet him there, 
You see how I'll meak him smart, 
That cruel- hearted, faithless Ben. 
Oh! fickle-hearted Benjamin, & c.

SUMMER-HOUSE OF ROSES. 
Ballad by E. D. GOODING. 
Sung by ADA WRAY. 
'TWAS only by the merest chance, 
In the summer-house I 
found her, 
Asleep amid the violets, 
With rose leaves dropping round her. 
I 
gazed enraptured on her sleep, 
While carelessly advancing, 
'Till tempted by her rosy lips, 
I 
stole a 
kiss entrancing. 
CHORUS. 
She says she often wanders there, 
And carelessly reposes, 
And always has such pleasant:dreams, 
In the summer-house of roses. 
I'm not quite sure she was asleep, 
Perhaps was only feigning, 
For all the while a 
lurking smile, 
She seemed to be restraining; 
But then, I 
thought I 
saw her blush, 
A momentary gleaming, 
But that might possibly been caused, 
13-
., something she was dreaming. 
She says she often, ttc.

THE ELOPEMENT, 
Ballad by E. D. GooniNc. 
Sung by kw, W RAY. 
THEY locked me in an upper room, 
And took away the key, 
Because I 
would not wed a 
man, 
That never suited me; 
They did not know the female heart, 
Or they would clearly seen, 
That locks and bars could never keep, 
A 
girl of seventeen. 
CHORUS. [Fuge.] 
Resolved, therefore, I 
would not stay, 
To be imposed upon, 
So while they thought I 
was secure, 
I 
was going—going—gone. 
The night was dark, the window raised, 
How could I 
answer no ? 
And he my virtues highly praised, 
Yes, Charlie teased me so. 
A 
railroad station being near, 
A 
carriage waiting by, 
What other course could I 
pursue, 
What could I 
do but fly ? 
Resolved, therefore, & e.

With all my grand accomplishments I

The way I 
gained my title is by a 
hobby which I've got 
Of never letting others pay, however long the shot; 
Whoever drinks at my expense are treated all the same, 
From dukes and lords to cabmen down I

Champagne. 
For, Champagne Charlie is my name, & c.

The spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay, 
Down by a 
little running brook. 
I 
first saw Maggie May. 
She had a 
rougish jet black eye, 
Was singing all the day; 
And how I 
lov'd her none can 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My 
little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day; 
Ohl how I 
love her, none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light and gay. 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
;Still by my side did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, cc. 
May heaven protect me for sake, 
I 
pray both night and day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie Mar 
or she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
I 
oft times think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie Mary.

Beautiful Girls. 
Sung by JENNIE 1111(111E3. 
AMERICA'S celebrated for 
The beauty of its girls, 
Their pearly teeth, their flashing eyes, 
Their dark or golden curls, 
Such witching ways, such pleasing smiles, 
Such eyes so full of glee, 
You seek in vain in other lands, 
The Yankee girls for me. 
Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy. teazing,, pouting girls, 
I 
love one and all, both short and tall, 
Beautiful wicked young girls. 
The next girl's most interesting, 
A 
miss of sweet sixteen, 
She's at a 
boarding school—No. 1. 
A 
seminary mean ; 
She blushes when she's spoken to, 
Though if the truth we knew, 
The blushing miss knows just as much 
As either I 
or you. 
SPOKEN—Don't they love each other, these girls of sweet six-
teen— the sweet girls graduates with golden hair. 
See them 
walking up and down with their arms around each other's 
necks : it's pretty, but aggravating. 
Its " AngelinP, you'll be 
sure and write to me ev..ry day, when you loay.1 school, won't 
von? 
And you'll come and be bridesmaid at my wedding. 
And did you bee that handsome 3
-oun4 man staring at me hi 
47 
Church?" 
No, dear ; he was staring at me." " No ; at me, 
pet." " I 
tell you lie was looking at me duck." ' You're a 
story, darling." 
" 
You're a 
falsehood, sweet." 
I'll tell gover-
ness." " I 
don't care." " I'll blap you, & c., &c., 
Beautiful girls, &c. 
Then there's the girl who's just come out, 
And conic out very strong, 
Who's looking for a 
husband in 
The fashionable throng ; 
'Tis lovely woman's business, 
To settle well in life, 
So none can blame a 
pretty girl, 
Who seeks to be a 
wife. 
SPOKEN—This is the sort of thing. " Ma, dear, may I 
dance 
with young Simpkins?" " Certainly, not, he's only two hun-
dred a 
year." " Then may I 
waltz with old Jones ?" " Certain-
ly. he's very rich and can't live long." " Oh, you dear child !" 
Then isn't it nice to stroll about on a 
summer's evening, with 
a 
beautiful girl of this sort, when nobody's looking. 
And isint 
it nice to choose a 
quiet arbor where you can go down on 
your knees to her, and oh, rapture! is'nt it lovely to discover 
you're kneeling on perriwinkle shells,— 
Beautiful girls, &c. 
Then there's another sort of girl, 
Whose childhood's really past. 
Who's tried to win a 
husband, but 
Is single left at last. 
Iler girlish manner she retains, 
Although her time is o'er, 
This giddy forward little thing, 
Of sixty-three or four. 
Beautiful girls, &c.

RAILWAY GUIDE. 
As sung by JENNIE iluGaxs. 
I 
IIAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know! 
A 
splendid-looking man, he was seated by my side, 
lie asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man he was troubled with absence of mind, 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
He could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that he wished to travel to. 
Could only remember that 
the word contained the letter B, M or K. 
So I 
began to run 
through a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such 
as: 
CHORUS. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunck, Neverink and Squedunk, 
There's Peekskid and Fishkill and Catskill heside, 
Weehawken and Ilohoken, Bingliainpton and Stouinzt on, 
Ile said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide. 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him " Good wan, 
Take the book I'm reading, and find it if you can ;'' 
Ile took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried; 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide, 
lie searched o'i r 
every leaf, and turned o'er every page, 
ht Cie felLy,v he got IA gni:e v, rage. 
bl 
lie soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried: 
Dear Miss! I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.---Although he said he had read all through, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight, 
lie placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
Oh, dear miss ! don't leave me, all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide. 
Raid I: Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well: 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
lie kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN; And, said lie, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover, whether it is 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, &c. 
Ile walked with me in silence, some distance on the road, 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode: 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me, and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my little glove, 
lie puldenly discovered that he was deep in love; 
Ile proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN: And he tells me it makes him feel so harpy, that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Maynunk and Mauchchunk, Ltc.

Oh! havv

We do not wear a

We've got a

With Cherry ribbons on it, 
We dress now in bed furniture, 
Just like a

A

And they call it Dolly Varden.

Dresses like a

I 
purchased it one fatal day, 
Immediately my mother, 
Whose weight is nearly half a 
ton, 
flushed out and bought another, 
Miss Smith—and Jones must have one too. 
They're as bold as a 
brass farden, 
And now I'm blessed if grandmother, 
Ilas'nt got a 
Dolly Varden. 
I 
see it in my dreams at night, 
No rest I 
ever find sirs, 
I've Dolly Varden on the brain_ 
And Chintz upon the mind sirs, 
This fearful fashion haunts me now 
I 
really beg your pardon, 
But is there any body here, 
Who wants a 
Dolly Varden.

It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
All the while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! it's naughty but it's nice, and we like it so, 
'Tis sure fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All the while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet! 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pass the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears, 
And such lots of sweet nonsence to them say. 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a 
spice, 
Our arms around their wa.is ts, del ightfully are placed 
All the while we know it's naughty but it's nice.

My Charlie is my darling, 
The beau ideal of loves, •• 
With his hair so black and curly, 
And his whitest of white gloves,

With his Baton in his hand, 
And leads the Instrumentalists, 
In a 
style that I 
think grand.

They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, Polka and Quadrille; 
And sometimes play so feelingly, 
It gives me quite a 
thrill; 
The Leader sometimes gives a 
frown, 
And looks as though he's rash ; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a 
crash.

Now where my Charlie's to be seen, 
I 
don't intend to tell ; 
For fear that he might captivate, 
Some other Belle as we11 ;

In about a

naughty little boy, as naughty as could be, 
Who used to scream; and vex his 31a, and spill his daily tea ; 
his leisure moments he'd employ regardless of her cries, 
In sticking pins and needles in his little sister's eyes ; 
He often used to lose himself, and gave his parents pain,— 
By turning up his little nose, when he timed up again ; 
lie kicked his mother's poodle and then out of window threw 
him, 
And bit his little brother so, that people hardly knew him 
lie usod to smash his pretty toys, his Noah's Ark likewise, 
Where Elephants and Beetles were exactly of a 
lIe size ; 
amputated Japhet's arms, and cut of Noah's feet, 
Persisting- as he swallow'd him— that ham was good to eat ; 
He never once repented, though his gentle parents frown'd, 
But took a 
holiday from school, to see the kittens drown'd ; 
In hiding Fido.s 
meat he seem'd to take an honest pride, 
And teased the cat so much, that she committed suicide. 
He never shed a 
single tear o'er Pussy's mournful fate, 
But called his nurse a 
naughty name, and went to bed at eight; 
lie put the candle out, and with the last expiring spark, 
He thought he saw two eyes that glared and glistened in till 
dark; 
He thought he saw a 
mewing, and he thought he heard a 
head, 
61 
That would have been like Pussy's only she was cold and dead. 
Tho' dreadful eyes drew nearer—oh, most terrible of sights--
Be screamed aloud—the cat 
the cat! and then they brought 
the lights. 
They look'd about all in and out, but nothing could they see, 
That threw a 
light upon the cause of this catastrophee; 
Until the morning came, when nurse with dreadful horror saw, 
Each nail had grown a 
talon, and each little hand a 
paw; 
lie took to catching, mice, and even rats he'd not refuse, 
Was seized with cataleptic tits, and hungabout the mews, 
And thinking he had got nine lives, he played at Pool all day, 
And joined the hippo-phalog,ical society, they say. 
He took to hating pastry, and he grew quite sick o' tart, 
Sat musing at the window, till he heard the cat's-meat cart; 
his parents tried to win him back, with coaxes and with smiles, 
But he wouldn't own a 
feather bed's superior to tiles; 
I 
don't know what became of him, and what's more do not 
care, 
For naughty little boys like that, I 
never could a-bear,— 
Be kind to cats and kittens is the moral I 
would tell, 
And send a 
friend to see ' em drowned, and that'll do as well.

Waiting, My DariTng, for Thee. 
Sung by Miss ADA W RAY. 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
thy: 
Cnonus. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lex 
fly the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, wailing, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coining this way, 
When the dim, misty vall of the twilight 
1.1as shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lilies, (te. 
Hung with great success by EDDIE NORWOOD. 
AS I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A maiden fair, with golden hair, came gently tripping by; 
The lustre of her dir.mond eyes, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch? 
Cnor.us. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic. circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl, 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took her to a 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took bold ofher My-white hand, and fell down on my knees; 
Beloved, cried I, arise, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
nie imprinted a 
one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, Ike. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
fri3- hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely stam7; 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch, 
Then round her lovely form, & c. 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a big fat horse 
marine; 
A 
ring I 
give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely form, &c.

SHE RAN AWAY TO FOREIGN CLIMES. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGE1 
I 
SAT me down and wrote a 
song 
I 
wrote it well, I 
wrote it long, 
At every line I 
shed a 
tear, 
At every verse I've lost my dear. 
My heart will break, and I 
shall die; 
And when I 
think, it makes me sigh, 
That I 
should love, with such a 
love, 
And now I've lost my turtle dove. 
She ran away to foreign climes, 
She loves the man who plays the chimes. 
Her name was Susan Sarah Jane, 
And don't you think it quite a 
shame, 
hat I 
should pine in such like times, 
Just for a 
man who plays the chim 
She's not so tall, but very fine, 
Alas, she never can he mine; 
Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her month is small with teeth so white 
She ran away, .kc 
She's curly hair, as dark as night; 
Her skin as fair as lilies white; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing rose, 
A 
merry laugh and Roman nose; 
She's rather stout alai in!! of prate, 
And when she walks she takes a 
stride, 
She swings her arms with such a 
grace, 
No Venus e'er had such a 
face. 
She ran away, &e. 
I 
decked my hair with violets blue, 
To let you know I 
loved her true, 
I 
bound my calves in black and white, 
Because I 
lost my heart's delight; 
My coat I 
changed to cabbage green, 
Which means forsaken by my queen, 
My corpus thus in colors slashed., 
To let you know my heart is smashed 
She ran away, Lte. 
I'll seek some spot where lambkins play, 
And gently breathe my grief away, 
Where little pigs and ducklings quack; 
You'll find me stretched upon my back. 
And in my hand a 
carving knife, 
To let you know I 
took my life, 
Through loving one that ne'er loved me, 
Became defunct for love of she. 
She ran away, ctc.

Tyrolean Ducks. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
Whenever ducks go two by two, 
They're surely got something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
Although themselves they know it well, 
They smoothe the feathers on their back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
CHORUS. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh In uh, Tra in, tra la uh, ah 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me, 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a 
single drake in luck. 
They smoothe the feathers on his back. 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack,quack.

Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh la uh, tra la, tra la uh, ah,

Beautiful Star; or, Star of the Twilight. 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star, 
Gladly I

Rest from your labors, children of toil, 
Night closes o'er ye, rest ye awhile; 
This is the greeting, signall'd afar, 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star. 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star, 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star. 
Eagerly watching, wating for thee, 
Looks the lone maiden, o'er the dark sea; 
soon as thou shinest, soft on the air, 
Borne by the light breeze, floateth her prayer; 
Watch o'er him kindly, home from afar, 
Light thou his pathway, beautiful star. 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star, 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star.

Marching Through the Park 
or the Drum 
Major. 
' 
By J. F. Brian. 
BEHOLD a 
warrior bold, 
Who is not too fond of fighting, 
Home service suits me best, 
Its so much more inviting. 
Tho' men may laugh at my walking staff, 
They envy me, I 
wager, 
And would not they all like to be 
The Grenadier's Drum Major I 
CitoRITS. 
Marching through the parks, 
Marching through the parks, 
You hear the drum go rum, turn, turn, 
As we march through the parks. 
As we go marching by, 
There is many a 
pretty face 
That always has a 
smile 
For me and my bright lace. 
At a 
girl I 
wink, which makes her think, 
In talk I 
should engage her; 
But bless their hearts, I 
love 'em all, 
Does the Grenadier's Drum-Major. 
Marching, &c. 
At night, with what delight 
Do we beat the grand tat-too--
Then every drummer-boy 
To his sweet-heart bids adieu. 
We've beaten the drum, then out I 
come, 
To meet Matilda Pager, 
Who thinks it grand, you understand, 
To walk with her Drum-Major. 
Marching, &c. 
Now, ladies, pray don't start 
At what I'm going to mention: 
Although I 
love you all, 
To wed's not my intention; 
The band would so make fun of me, 
My wife it would enrage 
But, ladies dear, are any here 
Who'll walk with the Drum-Major? 
Marching, &a.

THAT'S WHERE I 
KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sung by JENNIE rinamis. 
GOOD people I 
ask you to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song, 
Common sense is the best kilid of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys. 
So be careful when you fly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys, in a 
fight; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eyes, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pic-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport. 
Take your girl, your father and mother; 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
quaker, 
Be merry, cheerful and bright, 
And when there's a 
dance, 
Bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun day and night; 
Laugh and grow fat, don't look like a 
cat, 
74 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
If you're wise enough to save money 
And send all your children to school, 
The world will call you a 
miser; 
Just kick 'gainst the world like a 
mule, 
For when you are aged and decrepid, 
From hard work you take a 
respite, 
Then you will say I'm dry on a 
wet day, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
For money, you know, makes the mare go 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight; 
You can be a 
good fellow 
Without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad-tempered woman, 
One who could give you a 
look; 
That would send you out in the kitchen 
To wash, to scrub, and to cook : 
Go tie up your things in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night, 
As a 
matter of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
To the ladies, God bless you, 
I 
say the same thing; 
If you're brute of a 
husband gets tight, 
Lock him up in a 
room, 
Beat him with a 
broom, 
And that's where I 
know you are right.

It's Easy, if You Only Know the Way: 
Sung by JENNTE ErgGzr.. 
I'VE heard some people say,—If you only know the way. 
Success is very easy to obtain, 
Of that I've not a 
doubt, the way you first find out 
And then success you certainly may gain; 
Some men as you're aware, build castles in the air, 
But very soon they vanish and decay, 
Whilst others on firm ground build castles firm and sound 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
CHORUS. 
My advice now don't forget, and never run in debt, 
One hundred cents in the dollar always pay; 
Then Fortune's sure to smile, and you may live in style, 
it's easy, it you only know the way. 
Some men of honest mind, examples to mankind. 
Who never do a 
fellow creature wrong; 
Because they're not unjust, get lower in the dust 
And vainly struggle in life's busy throng. 
Some men you may remark, like working in the dark, 
And others in the honest light of day, 
But be it dark or light, some gain ambition's height 
It s 
easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, 
76 
Some bankrupts, when in debt, soon out of trouble get, 
And companies there are too by the score; 
Whose base Directors will their gaping pockets fill 
With savings of the honest, needy poor, 
Then fortune-hunters bold, although they're sometimes sold, 
A 
winning card will very often play, 
And wed some foolish dame, with money and a 
name, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, &c, 
Let each one do his best, and luck will do the rest 
As on life's stormy ocean we are tossed, 
Don't borrow from a 
friend, and don't too freely lend 
For through it, friends are very often lost; 
Then try with all your might, to do what's just and right 
And don't let vulgar tastes your judgment sway 
But work with right good will to climb Dame Fortune's hill, 
It's easy, kr you only know the way. 
My advice now, &c,

CURRANTS AND PLUMS, 
SO early in the morning my sweetheart Rosy May, 
Rose to make her pudding upon the Christmas day ; 
The prettiest girl of any, whatever people say, 
And while she mix'd her pudding, she sung this Christ-
mas lay 
CHORUS. 
Currants and Plums! citron and crumbs! 
The best way to mix it's with fingers and thumbs. 
I 
rose betimes that morning, and went to wish my dear, 
A 
merry, merry Christmas and a 
happy glad new year ; 
I 
look'd in at her lattice, she didn't notice me. 
But humm'd and mixed her pudding like a little busy bee. 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
I 
watch'd her pick the raisins and wash the currants o'er, 
I 
blessed her tiny fingers while they dabbled in the flour ; 
But when she'd chopped the suet, put the big pot on the grate, 
I 
sung this Christmas carol for I 
could no longer wait. 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
My darling, little Rosy blushed a 
rosy, rosy red, 
She left her Christmas pudding and hung down her pretty 
head ; 
Then looking up, she clapped aloft, her floury hands in glee, 
Crying—" Come and see the pudding, love, I've made for you 
and me." 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
We put the pudding in the pot, and watch'd it while it boiled ; 
For a 
Christmas pudding left alone's a Christmas pudding 
spoiled ;, 
Then side by side before the fire, with many a 
loving kiss, 
We passed the happy hours away, and sung a 
chant like 
this. 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
Of Christmas puddings in my time, I've tasted many a 
score, 
But I 
never tasted pudding half so good as this before : 
And I've got a 
precious promise, from my darling Rosy May— 
To make another pudding on our happy wedding day. 
Currants and Plums, & c.

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by E. DevrEs, espresely for JENNIE Realms. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence 01 Erin's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, I'll spake of Dan 
O'Connell. 
Emmett, Moore and Grattan for the services these have 
done. 
There's the " Dargle" and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone

THE KILKENNY BOY. 
As sung by JENNIZ H UGHES. 
I 
WENT to school to Darby Toole, who'd been a 
soldier I've 
been told. 
His talk of wars and drums and scars came over me when 
nine years old; 
Then I 
took to drums instead of sums, shillelah being my 
writing pen, 
My only books being outside crooks, my only joy being 
fighting men. 
Disdaining brogues, I 
erossed the bogs, with heart as light 
as any boy, 
The girls would cry when me they'd spy, " Sure there's Larry 
Moore the Irish Boy !" 
CHORUS, 
Oh ! the nice, the:neat, tse tall, complete, 
The handsome, fine Kilkenny boy. 
When older gr.iwn, the girls—och hone !— about their hearts 
they twisted me,. 
T.11 Seueatit Shay, he came one day, and with a 
shilling he 
listed me ; 
Then Kitty Burn she left her churn, saying, "Och ! youve 
been deceiving me." 
And Kate O'Neil—faith I'll go bail—will break her heart for 
leaving me. 
So, in this plight, a 
soldier tight, I 
marched as fine as any boy 
The fair to melt, the to pelt, none equalled the Kilkenny boy. 
Oh ! the nice, the neat, ike. 
Bnt Sergeant Shay he died one day, a 
bullet laid him on the 
floor, 
That same polth9gue that stopped his brogue a 
sergeant made 
of Larry Moore ; 
And when the peace bid fighting cease, of girls—och hone— 
I 
had a 
few 
Who tried to tease, but none could please like the charming 
widow Donoghue. 
It is herself that has the pelf, it is myself can spend it with 
ion 
She cried "Och hone! you're all my own, my darling, fine 
Kilkenny boy." 
Oh 1 
the nice, the neat, &c.

GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many tnousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
And noble as thine own. 
83 
Then do not turn away from them, 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend, 
No matter what the faults may be. 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance. 
84 
HE'S WORSE THA.N MY BIG BROTHER. 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
I 
AM tormented night and day, 
The fact I 
cannot smother, 
By my intended husband, 
And also my big brother ; 
They're always teazing me, they are, 
I've not one moment's quiet, 
From morn till night, ' tis their delight 
In the house to cause a 
riot. 
SPOKEN : I 
used to think my brother a 
harem scarem, but 
I 
assure you my sweetheart, Lionel, is a 
perfect limb, always 
playing tricks.upon us, but notwithstanding his faults— 
CHORUS. 
Ohl He loves me and I 
love him, 
We both love one another, 
lie's such a 
dreadful teaze, he is, 
He's worse than my big brother. 
My brothers led my sweetheart 
To bitter beer and smoking ; 
They don't indulge too much, 
But then ' tis really so provoking. 
In the drawing room or sitting room, 
The fumes are wafted freely, 
The smoke in fames does arise 
And always chokes me nearly. 
85 
SPOKEN: No matter how I 
lecture them about smoking in 
the drawing-room, they won't desist. 
Then Lionel says to me, 
"Now my darling wife, that is to be, you wouldn't debar your 
husband that will be, of one of his greatest enjoyments, would 
you? 
Well, there, I'll 
put out the pipe to oblige you? 
Directly I 
leave the room, there they are puflIng clouds out 
again, but 
Oh! Ile loves me, (tc. 
Now my brother climbs the house-top 
And down the chimney cries, 
When we're talking of the future, 
And arranging nuptial ties. 
Then Lionel my intended 
Makes all sorts of false alarms, 
By saying the wardrobe is on tire, 
And swoons in the servant's arms. 
SPOKEN : Well, I'll let him have his own way while he's 
single, but I 
believe he'll be just as bad when married. 
Well, 
I 
don't care if he is. 
For Oh! Ile loves me, S:c.

Who has eyes like a

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP. 
Written and composed by SAx. 13AoNALL. Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
All! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her face. 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, &c. 
88 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
. 
Who stood so forlorn in the streets for a 
while, 
Her sobs wrung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle: 
My parents are dead, and I 
wander dejected, 
In search of a 
boy that I 
love and adore; 
lie's long since departed from me broken-hearted, 
And I 
am alone far from Erin's green shore. 
The wind whistled, ,fcc. 
Need I 
say, I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her, 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's green shore, 
I 
watched her on deck till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out from my sight, and I 
saw her no more; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire. 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp, 
I 
think of the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkled the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled, &c.

STANDING AT THE GATE winr ADA. 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone tc 
sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep; 
The lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
CHORUS. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late, 
r 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek. 
Her pouting lips were just apart, her sigh was soft and sweet; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
I 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole it thrice. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
A. naughty bee out rather late, that moment by me flew, 
And his style quite plainly told lie had been drinking dew; 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung 
And as he flew into his hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate with Ada. &c. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
gate ; 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed, good night 
fair maid, 
And to my love my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade. 
I'm waiting at the gate for Ada, &c.

Suny by JENNIE ENGL. 
MY wife and I 
lived all alone, 
In a 
brown stone house we call'd our own, 
She had money and I 
had none, 
And that is why we were joined in one. 
Cnonus, 
Ha! ha! ha! just bear and grin, 
When you have found you're taken in. 
Ha! ha! ha! just sear and grin, 
When you have found you're taken in. 
I

That mine was hers and hers was mine, 
With golden hooks we fish'd for fate, 
And both caught gudgeons with our bait. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
For she supposed that I 
was rich, 
While I 
was on the self-same " hitch," 
The cruel vixen had me pinned 
To one lame leg, and a 
bag of— mind. 
Ha! ha! ha! &e.

THE VILLAGE CLOCK. 
THE village clock is striking eight 
As the misty twilight closes, 
And some one stands in the cottage porch, 
Under the clustering roses; 
And ever she gazes down the road, 
Her young heart anxiously beating; 
" 
Why stays he so late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating 
" 
Why stays he so late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating. 
The village clock is striking ten 
While two 'neath the roses linger, 
And something bright in the fair moonlight, 
Shines on the maiden's finger; 
.And whispers the youth " to morrow moru" 
As he bids good-bye in the door way: 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR 
was on one cold Winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
'Till she came to her own father's door. 
s' Oh! father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open thd door, 
Or the child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moo?. 
°Oh! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free, 
But now, doomed•to roam without friends or horn, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The old man was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
But the watch-dog howled and the village bell tolled, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
\Vhen he came to the door in the morn, 
For Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
buying, " This cold Winter's night she perish'd and di., 
By the cold wind that blew across the wild moor." 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon, 
And no one, they say, has Hied there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gone. 
The villagers point cut the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the dear, 
tying, " There Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
wind that blows across the wild moor." 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
PITY my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you wouldn't suppose, 
How I've been treated and snubb'd all along, 
Listen to me, and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
In the last form I 
continued to rest, 
Getting well flogg'd when I 
tried to rise higher, 
'Twas out of the frying pan into the fire. 
CHORUS. 
Out of the Frying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
P.rhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire, 
Out of the Frying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
Out of the Frying Pan into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
batchelor's life, 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
Cherub's that sits up aloft, 
Oh! how I 
pictur'd cur lives free from care, 
Happy as dicky birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria, 
'Twas out of the Frying Pan into the fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, ..te. 
Doting on children, to babier: endear'd, 
Happy was I 
when the first twins appear'd, 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
f3omehew or other I 
wasn't so glad;

Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did I 
ever to marriage aspire, 
Twas out of the Frying Pan into the Fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, Ice. 
Once I 
bought shares in a 
line that they made, 
Twenty per cent, was the dividend paid, 
Crash went the bubble, my savings entire, 
Went out of the Frying Pan into the Fire, 
Since then I've found that it's best to stand still, 
Letting the world jog along as it will, 
Fearful to move lest I 
sink in the mire, 
Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, tte...

WRECK OF TE 
ATLANTIC. 
Copyright Secure 7. 
Written. Composed and Sung with great Success, by T.Idaxwr.r.t.. 
I 
AM going to say a 
word of the shipwreck that occurred 
Cu board the steamship Atlantic, which no doubt, you all have 
heard. 
It is fcarful for to tell, of the sorrows that befell 
That ill-fated vessel, and the passengers as well. 
For they danced with . 
right good glee—every night when on 
the sea; 
Never dreaming for a 
moment but. safe-landed they would be. 
For they all joined tog-ether in making fun and mirth; 
To make the voyage pleasanter across the raging surf. 
Oa the 20th cf March, they sailed away from Liverpool, so 
bright, 
With ;oval! hearts 
sa:lec". aiong, till land. was far front 
sight. 
Thinking of friends they loved so dear, and the welcome when 
arrived, 
But alas ! for them it was not to be; of their hopes they were 
deprived; 
For on the first of April morn, whilst to Halifax being borne, 
This nol,le vessel struck a 
rock just before the daylight's dawn. 
Then Captain Williams said: " Lower the boats! save the p . ss-
engers and crew 
But the ship keeled o'er so- suddenly that they had no time to do. 
In less thn a- than it takes to tell,- the Atlantic was a 
wreck: 
The passengers startled front their sleep rushed out upon. the 
• 
99 
But on the face of everyone o:: then was a 
picture of dismay, 
And the survivors say they will ne'er forget the cries thy heart 
that day. 
It was then brave officer Brady, with a 
rope around his waist, 
Plunged off the ship into the sea, and to the rock made haste. 
To fasten the rope unto the rock was this brave man's plan, 
When from ship to the island rock through the raging waters 
swain. 
It is hard to thin)- not a 
woman or child, was saved that dread 
NI night; 
But all were consigned to a 
watery grave whilst land was it 
their sight. 
For the water rushed into their berths, drowned them just as 
they were, 
Knelt praying to the Almighty Gal for him their lives to spare. 
It was hard to perish, and land so near; scarcely three hundred 
yards away, 
7 
Some of them  
managed 
to 
get 
on 
deck, but were 
quickly 
swept 
away. 
It was then the cry that rent the air so very wild and high, 
To God they alt resigned their souls, when they knew that 
they must die. 
The scenes of that wreck no one but the survivors can relate, 
Some with despair like demons were, and some did calmly wait, 
When the fishermen came to their aid, and rowed all alive to 
land; 
Though some were penniless yet proud, when on the ground 
did stand. 
Theft they took their last look at the place where they lost their 
friends so dear, 
• 
And consigned them to thei r resting place that th ey 
Lad 
been 
so near. 
S4 let this Ue a 
prayer for all, wherever you may be 
Obi God; look down upon Viers all who cow lie ia the sea.

BANJO DUET. 
I 
SUPPOSE you've all had dreams, 
Scme strange awl very curious, 
At least we've been there ourselves, 
The last it was most furious; 
We dreamed we were two eagles bold, 
Called the king birds of the air, 
Together with all the birds and berlstg 
Assembled at a 
Fair. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas at the animals' fair 
All birds and beasts were there; 
The big baboon, by the light of the moon, 
Was combing his auburn hair; 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Stepped on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed and fell on his knees, 
Oh I 
how was that for the monk, monk, monkt 
The donkey and the cow, 
And a 
great big dog called Gypsy, 
Got drinking soap-sud smash, 
And soon became quite tipsy; 
The ring-tailed ape and crocodile, 
Two such jolly fellows, 
The black snake kissed the turtle dove, 
Which made the pigeon jealous.

A 
fight then soon began 
'Twixt the cat and the black and tan, 
The cat got bit and.fell in a 
fit, 
And died like a 
bold Soldier man; 
The monkey then came up, 
And challenged that ere pup, 
But the pup couldn't see 
Where the fun could be, 
So he quickly threw up the sponge, sponge, sponge,. 
After everything was quiet 
The tables than were spread, 
They'd butternut.; and corn, 
And grated Indian bread. 
They'd cod fish balls made out of mud, 
And brick-dust succotash, 
They had mince pies made out of flies, 
Red herring, toast and hash. 
CHORUS. 
It soon began to rain, 
The mule went home with the crane, 
The wolf and bear then chased the bars, 
Which caused the bed bug pain; 
The jackal he did cry, 
The spider eloped with the fly; 
Tne lion and bee they went to sea, 
How is this for high, high, high. 
I 
AM a 
poor deluded girl 
Left all alone to moan, 
For the loss of one I

But he has gone across the sea,

THE MIDNIGHT RANGER. 
I'M a 
boy that is fond of a 
midnight lark, 
Some folks call me a 
gay young spark; 
The reason I 
suppose is, my deeds are dark, 
And they call me the Midnight Ranger. 
Music pealing, oft reveal,ng 
O'er my senses softly stealing, 
Gas lamps burning, home returning 
Just before the break of day. 
• 
CHORUS. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, 
Tickling the girls is my soul's delight; 
I'm going to be married to Mary Ann White, 
And I 
really believe she's an auga. 
Shouting and bawling with might and main, 
Wetting wit- gills with bright Champagne, 
I 
never have a 
loss, it's always a 
gain, 
I 
find for the Midnight Ranger. 
Organs winding, purses finding, 
Hats all batter'd, torn or lost; 
Umbrellas, drunken fellows, 
To the station— fine and costs. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, &c. 
Each pal I 
have is a 
gay young spark, 
And good for a 
spree when the night is dark; 
Our howling makes the watch-dogs bark, 
And we laugh to scorn all danger.

And pull out, dis yer briar. 
CHORUS. 
Oh darkey don't you linger dere, 
Lord, I

Come help dis bleeding finger, 
And subtract away the briar. (Repeat.) 
I 
grabbed this fainting fair one, 
Right by her little thump. 
And pulled the thorney dagger out 
Like ' possum from the gum.. 
The more I 
kissed the finger, 
De more it seemed to heal, 
And when I 
kissed her two lips, oh, 
How happy she did feel. 
Oh, darkey,

courted sweet ARM 'Liza Jane, 
And well I 
played my part,

NITIVE LAND SO GREEN. 
Written by F. P. CAREY. 
Sung by JOHN FIELDING. 
t 
AM a 
true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure' does 
abound, 
And good nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native laud so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
he'll treat you to the very best, quite welcome you will be, 
he'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he willc h :er, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so dear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Itelend, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have 
al home, 
^ 
112 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must awn, 
And if you're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile, 
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so green.

('HE LITTLE CHURCH AROUND THE 
CORNER. 
BY J. C. !STEWART. 
Air—'• The Veteran. 
'Twas in a 
christian land, 
A. veteran actor lay, 
Whose sands of life bad near run out 
And soon must pass away: 
‘` I 
fear not death," quoth he, 
"My life has been upright ;" 
A heavenly smile pased o'er his face, 
A 
soul had taken flight, 
But, alas! he was an actor. 
His friends had gathered ' round, 
Their last respects to pay, 
And one who knew hi christian heart, 
Now sadly wound his way 
To a 
minis-ter, and begged, 
That he'd read a 
funeral prayer. 
" 
We never pray for Actors, no, 
But, I'll tell you where, 
There's a 
litt!e church around the corncr." 
In vain the friends did plead, 
But Sabine would not budge, 
Instead of trying to redeem, 
lie fain would be the judge. 
The felon in his cell, 
Or murderer doomed to (lie, 
Can have a 
sermon read for them 
But not our friend, and why ? 
Alas! he was an actor. 
With pity and disgust, 
The ft lends now turn toward 
A sleTheid, who protects his flock. 
And lives to serve the Lord. 
The set-Nice he performed, 
And prayed for that poor soul, 
Time friends discovered they had fount) 
A Chestian, not a

Far, far away,

Der's wha de old folks stay. 
And up and down the whole creation, 
Sadly I

Still lonzing for de old plantation, 
And for de old folks at home. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I

Oh !

Far from de old folks at home.

Many de songs Isurig.

AFTER ME. 
ag by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
I 
AM a 
joviaf customer, all miseries I 
shun, 
And as the proverb tells us, I 
take care of number one, 
I'm not at all a 
selfish man, my maxim don't you see, 
is to let other folks go first, go first? yes, after me. 
Cuoitus. 
After me, After me, tor greediness don't thirst 
Alter me, Yes, After me and then you shall be first. 
Whilst walking out the other day 'twas somewhere near 
strand, 
In my coat pocket soon I 
felt a 
rather clumsy hand, 
Some rough was just about to take my handkerchief away, 
But I 
was quick I 
collar'd him, and thus to him did say 
After me, &c, 
I 
had a 
dance one night last week 'twits at a 
tradesman's ball, 
With such a 
charming partner too, the handsomest of all, 
At my expense she drank Champagne when some swell said 
my dear, 
When the ball is done I'll see you home, I 
whisper'd in his ear. 
After me, 
c. 
I 
know a 
sponging fellow who somehow will not act square, 
And when the ' settling" times come round will never pay his 
share, 
He did the usual greedy at a " Wine Party" to day, 
lie seized a 
bottle but I 
snatch'd it from him and did say— 
After me. &c. 
YOUNG folks I 
come to sing a 
song, 
I'm old I 
won't detain you long, 
I'm eighty four, you must know I 
am, 
And the young folks call me grandfather Sam. 
ly hair once black, has now turned gray, 
But what of that while I 
feel gay, 
I 
could sing a 
song and dance with glee, 
Oh 1(1 was as young, as I 
used to be. 
Cuortus. 
Ilipity, hipity, hop do do, 
Oh how I 
love to sing for you, 
I 
could sing a 
soneand dance with g:ce 
Oh if I 
was as young as I 
used to be. 
When I as young I 
knew life's joys, 
But many sorrows have come, my boys, 
My dear old wife, the joy of my life, 
I 
lost some twenty years gone by. 
I 
could tell a 
story ' twould break your heart, 
But let all sorrow and grief depart, 
I'm a 
jolly old fellow as you can see, 
And I 
feel just as young, as I 
used to be. 
IIipity, bipity,.te. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
was with the girls the most of my time, 
I'd take them out each day for a 
ride, 
And I 
always had one by my side. 
I'd hug and kiss them, just for fun, 
And I've proposed to more than one: 
If there's ayoung lady here wants a 
kiss fro:n rrle, 
She will find me as young, as I 
used to be, 
Hipity 
ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without °Tie 
of those useful articles (holding up Umbrella)—when she 
)opped her little arm in mine, my heartbeat to that degree it 
wady dislocated my 
ribs (of the Umbrella I 
mean) It's a 
fact I 
'.hought to myself, here's a 
chance to go— 
CHORUS. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the law 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst courting Mary Jani 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name, 
also told me where she lived. 
With Pa dr.:wn at the farm, 
'13n-ter's daughter: well, sald

what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would keep on as s. 
rather liked— 
Courting.in the rain, &o. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOIKEN.—" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
ask my Pa—" So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform Ur) 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, &c. 
We reached the old farm-house, and th3n 
She Introduced to me 
Her Pa, a

made quite free:

MY name is Peter Simple, and I 
give you all a 
warning, 
That I'm an early riser, for I 
wake when day is dawning; 
At four o'clock I 
leave my bed in dreadful agitation, 
Awakened very early by this farm-yard conversation. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
At morning's early dawning, 
Cock-a-doodle-doo my friends, gives us all a 
warning, 
Fresh new laid eggs for breakfast ev'ry morning, 
Chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck ! cock-a-doodle-doo 
Bright Chanticleer proclaims the morn, no doubt that's ver3

I 
wished he not proclaim the hour so near the dead of night, 
He is the best alarum, he ensures a 
fellow's waking, 
I 
wish he'd not begin before the early morn is breaking. 
Oh! cackle, & c, 
I 
go to bed at tea tline, glad to rest my weary legs, 
And my revenge upon the fowls, is eating up their eggs, 
I 
have perchance a 
pleasant dream of fairies witLut number, 
All singing sweetly to me, when I'm waken'd from my slumber. 
Oh! cackle, & c. 
I 
wish they'd let me lie a 
bed, but then you see they won't, 
Oh! cruel cock-a-doodle-doo, please cock-a-doodle-don't! 
I've not a

Oh! cackle, & e.

MABEL WYLDE. 
As sung by Johnny Nolan. 
In our dreams we often hear sweetest voices soft aril clear, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died, 
Of our darling angel-child, happy little Mabel Wylde, 
Now at rest where no sorrows can betide; 
Angels guard, protect and bless, cherish thee with tenderness, 
Till we meet at heaven's portals, Mabel Wylde, 
And we ever love to think, that we soon shall reach life's 
brink, 
And we're nearing thee and heaven's angel-child. 
Cnonus. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering, gently whispering 
Of the little one that died, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died. 
Is we wander day by day o'er life's weary fruitless way, 
Angels' voices seem to murmur in our ear, 
Do not think that she is dead, tho' she was by death's hand 
led, 
Happy is our darling little angel-child ; 
When clouds and shadows fade and the future seems arrayed; 
With a 
promise that when happy visions smile, 
That when life's sad dream is o'er on the great eternal chore, 
We will meet our little, darling angel- child. 
In our dreams we, S:c.

RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on nib door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
C 
HORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their right. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Heaven a 
glad shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ling the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet 
One who walks with them in Heaven's briglit street; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
F783 from earth's trials, and taking sweet rest. 
Yes! there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door:

And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills, 
To seg_the darting little ones at home. 
Ali !

seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh! I

The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light,

As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I

I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee; 
Oh! I

The little ones at home, etco 
May rruardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep,

And meet a;ain with those I

Her name was Selina Belinda Crow, 
And I 
thought her so tender and mild; 
I 
called on her every day ye know, 
And followed her just like a 
child; 
I 
poured out my heart to Belinda Crow, 
Said for her to the end of the world I'd go; 
But she giggled at me and my love ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
3 I 
bought her a 
beautiful duck one day, 
And a 
basket with eatables piled; 
She said, Tommy, come in the evening, pray, 
And potatoes we'll have with it Wed. 
I'll be out all the day, said Selina Crow, 
Come at ten o'clock, then 
be in you know; 
That's the night I 
received such a 
terrible blow, 
Aud it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
4 
New trousers I 
wore that ccst fourteen and six, 
Had my hair cut and beautifully ded; 
In the evening I 
called at her house about six, 
As the time I 
thought might be beguiled; 
I 
looked in at the winder and didn't I 
stare, 
Miss Crow and a 
dapper young man were thcro; 
They were eating away at my duck I 
declare, 
Oh! it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho.—I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
5 I 
rushed on the pair like a 
lion ye know, 
And I'm sure I 
look'd awfully wild; 
Crying, oh! you deceitful, you false young Crow, 
But she turned up her nose and she smiled; 
Then the young man arose and to me did say, 
With his mouth full of duck for which I 
did pay; 
That young lady's my wife, we were married to day', 
Oh, it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
6 
Said I, you're a 
swindler and cheat, Miss Crow, 
Said her husband, I 
say, draw it mild; 
Then he kicked me right into the street ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild; 
I 
certainly thought they were very unkind, 
And I 
think that they might have enquired if I'd dined; 
I 
get mad even now when it crosses my mild, 
And it makes me so awfully wild.

ON BROADWAY. 
Words by George L. Stoute, and expressly adapted to the air 
of "Piccadilly for Miss Jennie Hughes. 
You talk about your languid swells 
Who Central Park parade; 
But there's a 
gent, I 
know right well, 
Who throws them in the shade 
But where he lives or what's his name,. 
I 
do not wish to say, 
hut the first time that I 
met this gent, 
'Twas on the gay Broadway. 
CHORUS. 
On Broadway, on Broadway, 
For elegant swells, and the fairest of Boas: 
On Broadway, On Broadway, 
That's where I 
am seen when in town, 
This handsome gent I 
sing about, 
This dashing Broadway swell, 
Has pearly teeth and deep blue eyes, 
And Blonde moustache as well; 
And like Adonis is his form, 
He always dresses gay, 
With a 
nobby air and curly hair, 
lie walks in gay Broadway, 
CHO.— 
I 
meet him at the matinee, 
And much do him admire, 
But when he looks me in the ace, 
I 
think I 
shall expire; 
At the Comique he buy's a 
chair, 
But more I 
dare not &ty. 
Of course you know the Comique is 
Five fourteen Broadway.

The Bashful Girl. 
As sung by Miss Jennie liughes. 
I'm a 
stupid bashful girl, 
How f 
titty-ti-ti-tremble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing, 
Such a 
multitude assetnble, 
Oh, pray don't, or f 
won't, 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at late, 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make rue niny-ni-ni- nervous, 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying heaven preserve In 
How they stare, I 
declare 
I 
get red as any peony, 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Oh, George isn't she a 
very, very Bashful Girl. 
Won't some gentleman be my friend, 
Like a 
bibby-bi-bi-bi-brother, 
Telling me my fault's to mend, 
And this silly shyness smother, 
HI can find a 
ma; 
Who belires in love that is pl-atonitml, 
might get courage yet, 
Really I'm a 
very, very, bashful GiA.

AWFULLY , CLEVER. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
lie's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
his fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
In the park he is often see' driving, 
He thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
Ile thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleea

LITTLE COQUETTE. 
Oh 1 
how I 
lore to flirt, 
Yes, to flirt; yes, to flirt; 
To coax in manner pert, 
And bring men on their knees; 
With love they say they'll die, 
And they sigh, and they cry; 
But this is my reply, 
And this is how I 
tease.

Singing,

Yes, the day, happy day,

And so I'm called coquette, 
Yes, coquette, yes, coquett 
But then I 
never fret, 
Nor heed a 
word they say; 
For flirting is such fun, 
Yes, it's fun; oh ! such fun; 
And till my heart is won 
I'll laugh and sing all day, 
Spoken; 
Singing, 
Tral lal lal, tte., 
Twas just about a 
year ago, 
When I 
was down at Glo'ster, 
I 
found a 
lass but now, alas 1 
I 
find that I 
have lost her. 
For sure I 
never cart forget, 
The happy days that we saw 
Before the day on which we met 
Her country cousin Esau. 
Spoken.—For it NV/14 on that unlucky day, that— 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw Esau kissing Rate, 
And the fact is—we all three SIN; 
For I 
saw Esau, he saw me, 
And she saw I 
saw Esau. 
I'd rather go without my beer, 
Or even get my sconce hurt, 
Than ever go again to hear 
A 
Crystal Palace Concert, 
For. I 
took Kitty there, and then, 
Unfortunately she saw 
That horridest of countrymen, 
Her country cousin Esau. 
Spoken.—But even then I 
never thought I 
should 
hava to say—CHO.— 
She introduced this man to me, 
And soon, behind a 
statue, 
I 
saw what made me audibly 
Sing out, "I'm looking at you," 
'Tis sad indeed to have to state, 
What poor unlucky me saw, 
For there was Esau kissing Kate, 
And Kate was kissing Esau. 
Spoken.—Yes! they had commenced the business 
arithmetically, they began with simple addition, 
went right through subtraction, and would have 
gone on to multiplication, had it not been that— 
CHO.— 
Is this why you both quitted me I 
Said I, you little Tartar / 
Oh yes said she, the Rule of Tree, 
Is not so good as Baxter. 
I 
went to school with him, she said 
And used to play at see- saw, 
&'0, if you please, I 
think I'll wed 
My country cousin Esau. 
Spoken.— Well, said 1, I 
came here to a 
concert, 
but this is a 
concerted piece I 
didn't c.spect to see. 
I 
scarcely knew what to say, for it was enough to 
disconcert me altogether, when—CII0.— 
I 
went away in quite a 
pet, 
And toddled home to tea, oh 
For I 
could see that their duet 
Had put me up a 
tree oh 1 
But still ray sorrow wasn't great, 
When in the papers we saw, 
That Mr. Esau'd married Kate, 
And Kate had married Esau.

SKELLY. 
Arranged by R. 
STSIRLY. 
Published by E. 
H. 
H ARDIN°, 288 Bowery, New York. 
I 
TOOK my love one evening 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' the silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control, 
I 
wanted to tell her, 
how dearly I 
adored her; 
But Oh! she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implor'd her, 
Oh I 
love, oh! love, why don't you heed me, 
flow can you treat me so, 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turn'd away her head, 
And this was all she said. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! aint you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me so. 
Yes you are awful, 
Your like I 
ne'er did see; 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me you're horrid, 
Why don't you let me be. 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to see her, 
Say yes and ease my mind, 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention; 
She said mamma woull scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention, 
Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she said, 
Don't ask me now to wed, 
What would the people say, 
If we should run away ? 
Oh! ain't you awful, (16s 
She talk'd on useless matters. 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be, 
I 
begg'd her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me, 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her bead, 
And this was all she said. 
Oh, aint you awful, ..te.

COMING HOME illOM THE BALL. 
Written and Composed by JOSEPX P. 
SKELLY. 
Arranged by It. STEIELY. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When were dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us, 
In the flush of the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home 1:)oking sleepy and sore. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we all know there is nothing more delightful 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance alt night -with a 
pretty girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and flirt a 
little in a 
quiet corner, and 
all that you know; but when reflecting on it the next day, one 
can't help but think, 
CHORUS. 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall, 
But you know how we feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome where ever we go; 
But when morning comes round we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thint we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOKEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while it 
, 
lasts, but we have to pay for it in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
my, I'm so sleepy." 
Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly, and so on. 
And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
sympathize with each other in our misery; and go home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Oh it's all qery well to go waltzing, etc.

MY LOVE TO THE WAR HAS GONE. 
As sting by Miss Axsrz ADAMS. 
FM broken hearted quite. 
For me there's no delight; 
Oh, dear, oh dear, what shall I 
do. 
My love to the war .htla gone, 
And left me here forlorn, 
Oh, dear, oh, dear, my hopes are few. 
Cnortus 
I 
wish there was no fighting, 
I 
wish there was no war; 
If I 
the Goddess were of love, 
I'd rule it over Mar ; 
Or if our kings and rulers, 
They must bark and bite, 
Let those who make the quarrel take 
Upon themselves to fight. 
I 
shed tears fast as rain, 
And when I 
sleep would fain, 
My screams in dreams alarm the neighborhood. 
For I 
fancy I 
can see. 
My love so dear to me; 
Oh, Fred, there dead on the cold, cold ground. 
I 
wish, &c. 
cannot sleep at night. 
And I've lost my appetite, 
Behold, untold you all may plainly see, 
I'm wasting fast away 
By inches every day. 
Oh, yes, oh, yes, it's a

Oh, how my heart beats whenever I

His rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tats 
No music's so sweet, with joy my heart beats 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pic-nic we met, one bright summer's day, 
A 
day that I 
ne'er shall forget; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods and somehow lost our way, 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet: 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
And of it may he ne'er be bereft. 
After all we've concluded ' tis but an exchange, 
And 'tis said that exchange is no theft. 
Oh, how my heart beats, &c. 
Fie has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down; 
lie has vow'd to be mine, In fact we both vow'd, 
Each other to Ilve evermore; 
Ali! where's there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears ! ter love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, & c.

That's Where You're Bound to be Right. 
THERE are thousands of people who think they're so smart, 
That are far too clever by half, 
Who often times think they are performing on us, 
When against them we all turn the laugh; 
They are too wide awake, and you'll make a 
mistake, 
If you let them get out of your sight, 
Don't let them have you, but try to have them, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
CHORUS. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, 
And trust no one out of your sight, 
Take care of your health, take care of your wealth, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
Advertisements show in the papers each day, 
That a 
firm has got money to lend, 
A 
hundred or so on your own note of hand, 
If you're hard up to them never send; 
For it's only a 
swindle got up by some rogue, 
Who gets all lie can, then takes to flight. 
So from them keep apart, you can do the laugh, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide. awake, etc. 
Now if you get tired of a 
bachelor's life, 
I 
hope now young men you'll take care, 
For to make this arrangement with your better half, 
To your home no relations are there; 
For you'll find that your mother in-law will want to be, 
At your house from morning till night, 
When such is the case, close the door in her face, 
For that's where you're hound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, etc.

THE YOUNG ,MEN OF THE DAY. 
I'M a 
young man of the present day, 
And the fashion has created— 
Many men like me, as you will say, 
Tho' not so bad as stated. 
About the little village I 
can find my way, 
And I'm Tery seldom seen inebriated, 
Tho' a 
fast young man of the present day, 
Of the present, of the present day. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
young man of the present day, 
Tho' I'm not so bad as tome people say; 
If I 
drink, and I 
smoke, and I 
dance and play, 
I'm not such a 
bad one for all that. 
1Tow and then at Billiards I've a 
spin, 
In a 
Theatre oft am seen, o' 
At Music-Halls sometimes I 
look in, 
Or else at the Casino. 
A 
little recreation in the dancing way, 
Is enjoyed with a 
zest so very keen o' 
By the fast young men of the present day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, dm

DOLLY DUE-, 
146 
I 
find myself in togs and tiles, 
My ties and crabs providin', 
And if I 
have to go two miles— 
A 
handsome cab I 
ride in; 
The cost of washing linen I 
of course defray, 
For a 
nobby-looking shirt, I 
take pride in, 
Like the other young men of the preseut day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, S:re. 
They say that I've a 
wish to roam, 
And that I 
avoid as blisters,— 
My Pa and Ma, also my home, 
My brothers and my sisters. 
To stay out half the night, I 
am inclined, they sly, 
That my manners altogether are remiss, sir=, 
Like the other youRg men of the present day. 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, &c. 
Now, as my faults to you I've told, 
Or, of what my friends accuse me; 
To ask a 
favor I 
make bold, 
And know you'll not refuse me, 
Be a 
little lenient to me, I 
pray, 
For what I 
have done was only to amuse ye 
AS 
a 
fast young man of the present day 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, &c.

As sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she repaired to Madison Square 
• 
While he repaired at home. 
CII0ELTS. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh! Dolly Dot was charming, Dolly Dot was gay 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart. away 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'Tis said that it held, 
She won the heart of one who came 
His daily bread to sell; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was always found, 
And he went round the Square because 
The Square was in his round. 
Dolly Dot, erx.. 
148 
But Dolly hati a 
black amour 
A 
chimnej sweep so cute, 
Averts she hsllped the black-a-moor, 
She looked apon his soot; 
An all persuAling tongue had he 
And was sc,zh an adept, 
That all he cr,ed was chimneys weep 
And theu tto chimneys wept. 
Dolly Dot, &c. 
These two her&es were bosom frienda 
Until it caase about, 
That they fell in with Dolly Dot 
And then they both fell out; 
Beside poor Dolly's can they met 
For her fair hand to fight, 
And soon they had the matter up 
And down in black and white. 
Dolly Dot, &c. 
The bak4 3oon began to tire, 
For dough is tender stuff, 
And when they'd a 
bout or two 
He'd had about enough; 
The lucky chimney sweep thus proved 
his right to Dolly's charms, 
And soon his sweetheart flew unto 
Her love's victorious arms.

THE FACTORY GIRL OF MANCHESTER, 
As sung by Miss JENNIF. ENTIEL. 
'TWAS down in Lancashire in the wintry iaonth of March 
To commence my unhappy little story: 
I 
met a 
little lass, whom none could surpass, 
But she's left me alone in my glory. 
She wore a 
blue print gown, and a 
shawl on her arm, 
And a 
handkerchief, the color I've forgotten; 
she'd a 
charming little head, the hair of which was red, 
And smothered all over with cotton. 
CHORUS. 
I 
brought her up to town into Westminister, 
She was highly delighted with the dancing; 
And her pretty little clogs went tap, tap, tap, 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her prancing 
She said she was single, and would like to wed 
To some one who was a 
famous Comic Singer, 
Then she said to me, I'd like to marry thee, 
If thou'll place the little ring upon my finger; 
I 
ran as quick as thought, and the little gem I 
bought 
And gave it her for ever, as I 
told her; 
But the naughty little Miss, a 
few weeks after this, 
Was married to a 
six-foot soldier. 
I 
brought. her. &c. 
What these pretty girls will do to lovers kind and true, 
how they fool them, teaze them, and despise them; 
Until it is too late, and they have joined their fate 
By wedding those who know not how to prize them. 
So you see I've lost the girl, who I 
thought a 
priceless pearl, 
it serves me right for being such a 
spooney, 
So young lads beware, of this factory girl take care, 
Or like me you'll beoorne a 
perfect looney.

brought her, kc.

SHE SAID 'TWAS DELIGHTFUL 0, VERY. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
A IR.— Think of Your Head in the Morning. 
NOW I 
fell in love with a 
charming young gal, 
Her name it was Arabella, 
The first time I 
met her, forget it ne'er 
As I 
carried her blue silk umbrella; 
Her father a 
baker, in Jersey lived, 
Free, open-hearted, and merry, 
Whenever. I 
called Arabella to see, 
She said ' twas delightful, 0, very. 
To Cape May one day, 'twas arranged we should go, 
Which pleased very much Arabella, 
Would it rain she asked me, wishing to know, 
Should she take her blue silk umbrella; 
If you wish I 
replied, tho' a 
very fine day, 
By omnibus started so merry, 
Were chatting and laughing the whole of the way, 
She said 'twas delightful, 0, very. 
At Cape May arrived, first the hotel went through, 
In a 
skiff then I 
rowed out my Bella, 
When she said for a 
sail suppose that we do, 
Open the blue silk umbrella; 
We were sailing but slow, when of wind such a 
gust, 
Came as we were singing so merry, 
• 
151 
Upset the skiff, the moment when just 
She said, 'twas delightful, 0, very. 
An oar about floating I 
luckily found, 
But alas! of my dear Arabella, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see nowhere around, 
Or Sae blue silk umbrella; 
A 
boat from the shore to my rescue soon came, 
Whilst dragging me into the wherry, 
How do you feel all did exclaim, 
I 
said not delightful, 0, very. 
Some drags were obtained, two boats were mann'd 
To search for my lost Arabella, 
From the bottom they dragged, grasp'd in her hand 
Was the ill-fated blue silk umbrella; 
In blankets they rolled her, gave...brandy hot, 
'Till her face was as red as a. Cherry, 
When rolling her over, to her senses she got, 
She said 'tis delightful, 0, very. 
Home we returned, of the accident spoke. 
That it was'nt no worse, were delighted, 
Then laughed as they thought a 
capital joke, 
To strengthen it we were united. 
Since married, we've bless'd been by children three, 
With faces so rosy and merry. 
As each one is born, Arabella to me, 
Says this is delightful, 0, very.

MOTHER SAYS I 
MUSN'T, 
A NICE young man I 
once knew well, 
A 
few short years ago, 
He courting came, in hail or rain, 
He vowed he loved me so. 
He'll long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time he was away; 
And when he'd ask a 
parting kiss, 
I 
always used to say: 
CHORUS. 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Oh, George, dear George, 
Not just yet awhile, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I

Oh, George, dear Georgc, 
Not just yet. 
Ile waiting kept, at last one day, 
He thought he'd know his fate, 
And sank upon his knees in quite 
An agonizing state. 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
He longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
c. 
From then he went to work, indeed, 
He left HO stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed, 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased and so at last 
I 
lovingly did say: 
SPOSEN.—Well, George, darling, as you have improved in 
circumstances since we last met, suppose you ask me again 
that question, eh, what say Georg,ie Porgey?

I'll tell you boys from whence I

Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
No Country is more dear to me, 
Than the little isle stands in the sea. 
Where boys and girls are gay and free, 
Deny it if you can. 
Sure old Ireland's the place, 
That there's fame for fun and mirth, 
Its equals you cannot find, 
And search all o'er the earth. 
Good-natured boys and girls there, 
With few of them you can compare, 
Their hearts and minds are free from care, 
That makes an Irish- man. 
CHORUS. 
Then Kate O'Brien is my name 
I'll tell you boys, from whence I 
came. 
Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
Oh Dan O'Connel, Ireland's friend, 
lie struggled hard her to defend 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend 
To crush poor Paddy's land, 
lie always proved poor Paddy's friend 
_ 
154 
When on his trial he did attend, 
And made the noblest back to bend, 
To the honest Irishman. 
In the high court of justice, 
He made them all to stare, 
With his learning, wit, and humor, 
To hear him it was rare. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In our little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men. 
Then Kate O'Brien, &c. 
In Eighteen forty-eight gone by 
The Irishmen they had to fly, 
For famine stood in every eye 
Along old Grannia's shore; 
Thousands to America did sail 
Leaving their wives and babes to wail, 
They were determined they would not fail, 
But their hardships undergo. 
The Harp that once through Tara's Halls, 
Its cord shall strike again, 
And welcome back the exile 
From across the stormy main. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In that little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men.

MUSIC 
by DANID 
OH I 
I'm very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky; 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words he whispers, 
And his eyes are sparkling blue; 
But what he tells, you may be sure, 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh! we wander while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes are my light; 
Of all the joys it beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS-
Oh ! my heart kept going pit-i-pat, 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was at; 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But his beaming eyes they were my light. 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
(Symphony, when dance is am:W(1.) 
/s7Jw he called me " pet " and " dearest." 
And I 
could not tell you half 
And he said I 
was the " nearest " 
Then I 
laughed a 
little laugh! 
His arm he kindly offered. 
Then he offered me his hand, 
And said, he'd make his darling one 
The happiest in the land! 
Tho' twas darkness in the pleasant air, 
Yet his beaming eyes were my light 
He kissed me—ere I 
was aware— 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, Stc. 
Now I 
never can forget him, 
Nor his dear, enticing way! 
Near the place where I 
have met him 
0, I 
wander every day! 
My heart is in his keeping, 
He has stolen that I 
know, 
lie really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau! 
So we wander in the darkness yet, 
But his charming eyes are my light! 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &C.

TWILIGHT IN THE PARK. 
'TWAS on a 
summer's day. 
I 
met her all by chance; 
Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the " mall," 
We strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take I 
We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words! 
She leaned upon my arm; 
The sun went clown the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast! 
Cnonus. 
Twilight in the Park! 
Twilight in the Park! 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark! 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the Park! 
She left me at the gate. 
And sweetly said good bye; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh! 
158 
She said she'd come again, 
And nam'd the time and place; 
Her absence gave my heart such pain, 
For heav'n shone in her face! 
So every day I 
watched 
In love's delightful trance, 
And sure enough, we met again, 
She knew me at a 
glance! 
'Twas love at sight, I 
said, 
And as the day grew dark, 
I 
won her heart for ever more, 
At twilight in the Park ! 
Twilight, &c.

Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs. 
Written by P. 
GILITER1 
I LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but hi a 
knowing way,— 
She slyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me dais sag— 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever see an oyster walk up stairs? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank; 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, &c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shall go, 
But still she asks the question, and so slyly wants to know— 
' 
I 
ever saw, &c. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertake the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I 
ask— 
Cuouus. 
Have you got a 
leetle native that cat 
Ap stairs? 
Walk up-stairs ? 
walk up-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and sham my cams, 
But not before you ina ay lyster walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will make my own, and use it when I 
can., 
No matter what the query is, I'll answer every man; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding six month's irnt 
I'll say, "Old boy, you'll got it, if you witness the event.'' — 
Cum:Ts. 
The day ah artrul oyster walks up stairs ? 
Walks up stairs ? 
walks up stairs? 
For when you do, I'll pay it you, and ease your car, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs.

My Charley is a

A 
coat of blue he 
got; 
He is a 
son of Uncle Sam! 
And for our flag does fight; 
That banner that we all do love, 
Which does defend the right. 
When the cry of battle's heard—he flies (lutck at the word. 
Ile cares not, he heeds not, he fears not defeat; 
rle's always first in fight, beneath our banner bright, 
Is Charley, my Charley, my Charley in the Key West flea. 
I 
last saw my young hero bold, 
'Twas on a 
Summer's day; 
lie stood upon his vessers deck, 
As she sailed down the bay; 
Ile gave me one sweet parting smile, 
He waved his hand and cried; 
"I go to fight that foeman bold, 
That has our flag defied! " 
When the cry, ct.c..

I 
wish him luck from morn till night, 
My gallant Boy in Blue; 
I 
know unto his country's cause, 
And me I 
he will be true. 
I 
know beneath the stars and stripes, 
he'll fight the battle well; 
As Farragut, and Lawrence did, 
And history will tell. 
When the cry, &c. 
I 
love the Soldier bold and brave, 
lie well defends our land; 
But better still I 
love to praise, 
Our nation's sailor band! 
I 
know to me he'll soon return; 
In joyful glee we'll meet; 
I 
long to clasp my Charley's hand, 
Safe from the Key West Fleet. 
When the cry, ttc. 
Kind friends, your attention 
I'll ask for a 
while; 
And I'll try to amuse you, 
In my simple style. 
To sing to you nightly-, 
Its a 
pleasure, I 
see, 
For the gents in the house 
All keep winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at mo 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While they're winking at me. 
There's a 
gentleman sitting 
Down there on the ri.;.ht; 
He came here to day, 
In a 
terrible plight. 
He's lately been jilted, 
By a 
fair one, you see, 
And now he comes here, 
And keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at me. 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While he's winking at me. 
There's a 
gent sitting there, 
Dressed in elegant taste, 
fl y 
the side of a 
lady, 
His arm round her waist. 
An artful deceiver I 
fear he must be, 
For while he makes love to her, 
Ee keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at me, 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While he's winking at me 7 
Just one year ago to-day, love, 
I 
became your happy bride, 
Changed a 
mansion fJr a 
cottage, 
To dwell by the river side: 
You told me I'd be happy, 
But no happiness I 
see, 
For to-night I 
am a 
widow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Alone, all alone by the sea-side he ler.t 
And no other's bride I'll be; 
For in bridal flow'rs he deck'd me, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
From my cottage by the sea- side. 
I 
can see my mansion home, 
I 
can see tho ,e 
hills and valleys, 
Where with pleasure I 
have roamed ; 
The last time that I

But to-ni - ht I

If he only knew his sister, 
Was a 
widow by the sea. 
CII0.—. 
138 
Good-Bye, Charlie. 
OH, how I 
envy girls who have 
Their lovers close at borne, 
While distance keeps me far from mine, 
Who o'er the seas muct roam ; 
Should I 
but see him twice a 
year, 
Contented I 
must be, 
And hope he'll ne'er forget my words 
When last he went to sea. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away, 
Write me a 
letter, love; send me a 
letter, 
love, 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away 
Do not forget your Nellie, darling ? 
How nice the drive, the game at chess, 
Or moonlight walk must be! 
How nice to have one's love " drop in" 
To take a 
cup of tea! 
How nice to have sweet billet-doux 
Arrive by ev'ry post! 
The whilst poor me can but expect 
Just two a 
year at most. 
Good-bye, Charlie, &c. 
It's hard to see such swarms of swells, 
Who stay at home at ease, 
The while my darling has to sail 
The wide and stormy seas. 
But I 
suppose it would not do 
For all to stay at home, 
And so I 
can but hope my love 
Ere long will cease to roam. 
Good-bye, Charlie, &c.

JUNIUS BROWN THE TRAGEDIAN, 
Or " No 
Matter." 
nr an actor who's seen better days, 
For I 
once was a 
star I've a 
notion; 
I've been toss'd about all sorts of ways 
Upon the theatrical ocean. 
But jealousy, spite and all that 
Has brought me down to but a 
seedy ' un, 
It's been all caus'd by envy—that's flat, 
For I 
once was a 
heavy tragedian. 
CHORUS. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, 
Though now I'm reduced to a 
seody ' un, 
In me you may please to behold, 
Junius Brown, the Tragedian. 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Antonius Brown, sirs ; 
And I 
flatter myself I 
have caused, 
Great excitement in many e. town, sirs: 
My last " shop " was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
In a " part " that I 
could above any fit, 
My " screw " sirs, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and a 
half a 
clear benefit. 
SPOKEN. — ThaLzas money, but what do they offer talent 
now ? I 
was actually oflered the other day twenty-live " bob " 
per week to play Othello, the Clown in the Pantomime, and do 
bill-sticking in the morning. 
Did I 
accept it? 
Blood mid 
blue fire? 
Never! NEVER! but no matter, a 
time may come 
when they will be glad to secure the services of Brown the 
Tragedian. 
I've been it bright star in my time, &c. 
170 
- 
Simce Kemble none like me's becn seen, 
Yet nought but bad luck 13 my my portion ; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard" and " Hamlet-s" a 
caution. 
They say my declaiming's a 
treat— 
In the speech over Cxsar by Antony; 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can " pile up the agony." 
SPOKEN.—For two consecutive weeks was I 
the leading 
attraction at the Royal Bower, and should have startled the 
world at Drury Lane; but for professional malice. 
I 
am kept 
off the boards out of fear. 
They know I should render 
Shakespeare's great characters as they have never been ren-
dered before. 
My reading of his plays is entirely ditlerent to 
Macready, Kean, Phelps, T. C. King and all those fellows— 
they know that—but, no matter, a 
time may come when they 
will cringe to Brown, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, ..tc. 
I 
search through the " Era" each week 
And I " write in" when talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me, ( there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tired). 
They offer me terms for a " super," 
Or ask if I'm up to " utility, 
But I 
11 starve and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous ability. 
SPOICEN.—Me, ME! Junius Antonius Brown descend to do 
the cock in Hamlet, or Bobby in the Pantomime. 
Ye Gods 
and small fishes! 
Rather would I 
descend from my pedestal 
of fame and become a comic vocalist, but no matter! NO 
MATTER!! The time may come when they will be glad to 
pile gold at the feet of Brown, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, &c.•

ITS WEALIN A DWEADFUL AFFAIR; 
FM sure I 
can't think what the world's coming to, 
The times are so wretchedly slow. 
'Tis hard to make out what a 
fellah should do, 
Or yet where a 
fellah should go. 
I've puzzled my bwain and I've scratched at my wig, 
Till I've almost torn out ev'ry hair ; 
But I 
cannot produce an idea worth a 
fig, 
It's weally a 
dweadful affair. 
C 
110RUS. 
Oh, pity my case, I 
never can carry my cares, 
I'm crushed, fairly crushed with the weight of these dweadful 
affairs. 
I'm iather ambitious, and yet cannot tell 
how to get up the ladder of fame ; 
As Snodgrass and Snooks does'nt sound very well— 
But for that I've my father to blame. 
There's the bar, and the navy, and aw I 
forgot 
There's the army, I 
might get on there— 
But if war should break out I 
might chance to get shot, 
And that would be a 
dweadful affair. 
Oh! pity my case, &c. 
One day I 
went out with my dog and my gun, 
Intending to pop at some game ; 
But, whethaw from weakness of sight, or the sun, 
I 
nevaw could get a 
good aim. 
I 
fired my piece and I 
raised quite a 
log, 
The bird it new high in the air ; 
But somehow I'd shot off the tail of my dog, 
It was weally a 
dreadful affair. 
! 
pity my case, &c. 
I've often heard tell of poor men being lamed, 
Or of losing an arm or a 
leg, 
Or their backs being broken, or otherwise maimed 
And then of their having to beg. 
All this they will bear and with scarcely a 
grin, 
Well! I'm not a 
muff you're aware ; 
But I 
screamed like a 
rabbit, when pricked with a 
pin, 
It was weally a 
dweadful affair. 
Oh! pity my case, &c, 
It's a 
dweadful affair when my boots are too tight, 
Or my coat is not properly made, 
Or my tie will not fit, or my collar's not right, 
Or my gloves not exactly the shade. 
But I've run through my song and endeavored to please. 
Being anxious to make matters square ; 
So I 
beg to retire, If I 
don't I 
shall sneeze, 
And that would be a 
dwealful affair. 
Oh! pity my case, & e.

Miekey, put your Frieze Coat on. 
As sung by JENNIE ilUGHEO. 
ARRATI! Mickey, will ye leave us thus, 
To cross the raging main; 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Should you ne'er come back again: 
The Hawthorn it may flower in Spring! 
The Daisy bright may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
if you, my darling, go. 
CHORUS, 
Arrah! Mickey, put your frieze coat on, 
Walk through the bog with me; 
Anti you can whisper in my ear, 
how dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land, 
We've courted many a 
year— 
Then stop where sweet the Shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear. 
Though peace and plenty waits you there, 
In that land  ' beyant " the sea! 
To break my heart is hardly fair, 
So stop with love and mn. 
Arrah ! Mickey, &c. 
My Granny's got a 
cow and pig, 
An eight-day clock and all; 
With a 
picture of St. Patrick, 
That hangs against the wall. 
There's an arm chair stands beyaut the nook, 
Close by the bright turf fire; 
Where the " potheen " bottle lies concealed, 
What more can you desire. 
Arrah Mickey, gtc. 
I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our Cottage out; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear, 
The welcome news to shout, 
That you will stay among us all, 
And the lark will sweeter sing; 
And the bell 
from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring. 
Arrah! Micl:ey &c.

A

sq.) that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad lu bit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining"how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising vvhat 
is commonly called " flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
2.5 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. FiAter & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocerst 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to oui 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

CfMnOTTE 
To those who have never perused the sad story of CHAR-
LOTTE TEmrLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor-
tunate Charlotte Temple : 
ller form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."
