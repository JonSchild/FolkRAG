HANNAH BEASLEY. 
Sung with success by J. D. Roome all over tha country. 
Good folks listen, and listen to me right, 
I'm chock full of trouble from morning until night, 
Fell down stairs with my bead full of bother, 
If I'd fell another step, I'd fell a 
step farther, 
Sisters won't you come and join our band, 
Brothers won't you come there toe, 
Come_and join us without a 
boot or shoe, 
For nobody knows, no not even to you. 
ClIORIJS. 
Nobody knows what trouble I 
see, 
Nobody knows in the world but me. 
Nobody knows what trouble I 
see, 
Nobody knows nobody but me. 
Skeeter and a 
bed bug kept a 
hotel, 
Had twenty boarders doing mighty well, 
Business got bad, hotel went to smash, 
Skeeter and the bed bug smothered it the hash, 
Had a 
crate of chickens and they flew so mighty high, 
One of them flew in the skeeter's eye, 
Chickens got sick all laid up with the croup, 
Skeeter and the bed bug drowned in the soup. 
No body knows etc. 
Went to the ball at the other end of town, 
Down in the celler on the bare ground, 
Do a 
double sh uffle just as I 
please, 
Dog was a 
dancing, so was the fleas, 
Went to the meeting and they axed me to kneel. 
In come Dinah with a 
square toed heel, 
Head in the house and heels in the street, 
And the preacher said, well Dinah, now I'm glad you brought 
your feet. 
No body knows etc,

THE AUCTIONEER. 
Banjo Solo, sung by T. D. Rooms. 
'AsI was walking down Broadway, 
I 
saw a 
serious sight to day, 
An auctioneer and I 
heard him say, 
lie had strange things to st.41, 
He exhibited a 
curious lot, 
Which he told me had lately bought, 
„Could you but seen you'd ne'er forgot, 
To laugh I 
was compelled, 
Oh I 
smiled when I 
went in, 
And the man he commenced to grin, 
Hejumped upon the counter, 
And loud began to call, 
Bow legged cats and cross eyed rats, 
A Dutch giraffe and an Irish bat, 
a 
tenor voice sang in a 
flat, 
Who's going to buy them all. 
The first thing that he tried to sell, 
Was the oaken bucket, and then the well, 
Then a 
peal from the independence bell -, 
The nead of a 
river too, 
He then put up the forks of a 
road, 
He tried to sell the hop of a 
toad, 
The patience that belonged to Job, 
From a 
mountains foot a 
shoe, 
There was old rheumatic pains, 
And some fancy new chillblains, 
Some ague shakes and two earthquakes, 
Some smoke and a 
pound of air, 
He tried to sell the golden rule, 
The sheep .that followed Mary to school, 
Then tried to sell the kick of a 
mule, 
The claw and the growl of a 
bear. 
An oar he had from Noah's boat, 
And a 
patch that came from Joseph's coat, 
Then a 
whooping cough he'd warrant to choke. 
And destiny's left hand. 
He wanted to sell the rail road strike, 
Two rounds of the Sayer's and Heenan tight, 
The wings with which time takes it's flight, 
And a 
rope from freedom's strand, 
The presents that Grant had refused, 
He offered unto me, 
The axis on which the earth revolve, 
And part of the Artie sea, 
From a 
vessel's log he had a 
ship, 
'From a 
skating boy he had a 
skip, 
From a 
tunnels mouth he had a 
hp, 
— And the horns of a 
honey bee, 
I 
WENT TO SEE TAY LOVE. 
End song, written. by C. R. Doekstader, for J. D. Roome. 
I 
went to see my love last night, 
She was there when I 
arrived, 
I'm getting on fast in love I 
guess, 
I've got an Irish rise, 
I 
asked her for her coal black hand, 
Be mine forever more, 
De dog gone family flew at me, 
Layed me out for dead on the fkor 
Cuonus. 
I 
gwine away for to leave you, 
And I 
won't stop on de way, 
Don't pester me but char de track; 
For I 
can no longer stay. 
(Repeat.) 
I 
took her little hand in mine, 
Den on my bended knees, 
I 
vowed to her I 
would be true, 
She allowed I 
was a 
tease, 
She pitched mein the cistern, 
And she scared me up for life, 
She scandalized my name and fame, 
Declared she'd be my wife. 
I 
gwine away etc. 
Den fare you well for ever, 
You Sophia den good bye, 
I'm foolish now for mourning gal, 
But long for you I've cried, 
I'll buy a 
ring for another gal; 
And put it on her finger' 
And take her to de preacher man, 
Wid her for life I'll linger. 
gwine away etc.

TROUBLE ON A 
FARM. 
Am—Around her splendid form I 
drew my magic circle. 
Written by C. It. Dockstader, and sung J. D. Rome. 
Oh, I 
got tight the other night, 
De boss gave me de sack, 
He tole me I 
might leave de place. 
And never more come back, 
I 
left de town without a 
cent, 
My trunk hung on my arm, 
That very night with stomach light, 
I 
hired out, out on a 
farm. 
ClIORUS. 
Dey boost me up at 4 
in de morn, 
To go and wake de cattle, 
To feed de sheep, de cow to beat, 
To make de chickings cackle, 
De bay mule pranced, brindle danced. 
De goat his horns did rattle 
De colt did laugh at the muley calf, 
Kick high, den fit a 
battle. 
Den farmer's gal came down to de barn, 
De yellow cow to milk, 
Wish I 
may die, kick me in de eye, 
Den de pail and de gal got spilled, 
De farmer swored, ole cow roared, 
An de gemmen cow did cheer, 
Den dey got a 
gun, and by de rising sun, 
hey finished his career. 
CHORUS. 
Bantam flew on de ox's horn, 
An loud for help did shout, 
Shanghi rooster raised a 
fuss, 
An de jackass kicked him out. 
De sheep, and de lamb, an ole black ram, 
Tryed to stope de fussing, 
Got on dar knees, begged and teased, 
Farmer swearing an cussing. 
De big pig looked like he'd been drunk, 
And had delirium jim jams, 
When de brindle cow, an bob tail nag, 
Began for to hug de black ram, 
Boss cut loose at do one eyed goose, 
I 
reckoned he was a 
goner, 
Dey raised up a 
shout pranced all about, 
Shanghi sobbed in de corner. 
Cuoaus. 
De brindle cow fell on her knees, 
An offered up a 
prayer, 
hey flew at her and killed her dead, 
De ole bay mule did scream. 
Dey scratched and bit, dey pawed, and dey fit, 
I 
shook wid fear, and shivered, 
I 
flew out de town, over de gravel and de ground, 
And landed in a 
river. 
Written by C. R. Dockstader, and sung by J. D. Roome, with 
great success. 
I'm no ways tired dis evening,

Been up de street, wid my shoe shod feet,

WHAT I 
WISH I 
WAS. 
I 
with _ was a 
rooster, for every one I'd crow, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
green-back, I'd be good where' ore I 
go, 
I 
wish r 
was a 
rich man's son so I 
could see the sights, 
I 
wish the women were all men so they could have their 
rights. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
waterfall the ladies would me wear, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
Grecian bend the men would at me stare, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
Congessman how happy I 
would be, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
IT. 5, bond they'd be no tax on me. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
stock holder of the city railroad cars, 
Not the fellow that holds the mules, but the one that takes 
the fares, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
velocipede, through the streets you'd see me 
A new fashion they got now-a-days of riding on a 
rail. 
I 
wish I 
was collector of the infernal revenue, 
I'd stir up all the whiskey frauds, I'd make a 
million or two, 
I 
wish I 
was Uncle Sam so I 
could have my say, 
I'd settle the Alabama claims by taking Canada. 
OLD BILL &ETHERS. 
Banjo Solo, sling by J. D Roome. 
Ohl Bill Sinithers, he was a 
masher. 
He was a 
nickel- plated son of a 
gun. 
He was head centre in a 
caravan circus. 
And he manipulated on the big bass drum, 
He had a 
pair of feet like a 
canal boat's rudder. 
His lip bung down like a 
policeman's jaw 
Had a 
set of teeth like an aligator. 
That would cut through bash like a 
big rip sa\l", 
CII011US. 
Big Dutch dough- nuts with Havana wrappers, 
Sleep quiet boys with your windows up, 
Assasinate a 
ten cent barber, 
Drink hair oil from a 
custard cup. 
Bill went over to New Jersey, 
Lived on gravel and limburger cheese, 
,Put all money in his mother-in-law's pocket. 
And got out a 
patent for raisiog fleas, 
He could speak filtteen different kinds of language, 
He run out his tongue like an elephant•s tail. 
He could ride in a 
street car without a 
nickel. 
And be used to grub checks to Lret in jail. 
CHORUS. 
now your lingers on a 
frosty morni ng. 
Never eat hay mid think it's grass. 
If you are ever troubled with inflammatory rheumatism. 
Hub yourself down with a 
hunk of blue glass. 
Bill he never stood up against bunks, 
lie peddled pig sand in the public schools, 
Fell off the post office down in a 
sewer, 
And caught the epizootic from a 
mule, 
I 
le was charmed by flies in the month of August, 
Ile embalmed himself in a 
barrel of lard, 
Joined Buffalo -William on the western prairies. 
And enlisted in the Mulligan guards. 
Cnonus. 
Blow your fingers on a 
frosty mornin:5 
Never call me old time rocks 
Never wear a 
linen duster in the middle of N% 
Never go a 
fishing in sad l

CONUNDRUM 
Banjo solo, sung by J. D 
Roome. 
I've often asked some funny things, 
To please you for a 
while, 
And many a 
time that I 
know, 
Have caused a 
pleasant smile, 
I'm going to sing a 
song to-night, 
I 
hope it will please you well, 
A 
few conundrums, Iwill ask, 
And then the answer tell. 
The first one I'm going to ask 
By the way of table talk, 
Why is kissing a 
pretty girl, 
Like eating soup with a 
fork, 
Of course the answer I 
can give, 
For I 
am up to snuff, 
Eating soup with a 
fork, 
. ' Corse it's hard to get enough. 
The next one I'm going to ask, 
And what it is about. 
Is what does a 
little boy do, 
When he wears his pants out, 
Why he wears them out of course 
The answer it is plain, 
lie does not worry himself at all, 
But wears them home again. 
Now here's one on the ladies 
And it's just a 
posing hit, 
Why is a 
soldier like a 
girl, 
The answer it is it, 
The difference tween a 
soldiet 
And a 
girl so strange to sir, 
The soldier faces powder, 
I3ut the girl she powders her's, 
HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Written by Harry Bennett, and sung J. D. Roome. 
Of a 
hungry man, I 
am going to sing, 
And pity to your heart will bring, 
He swallowed almost every thing, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day, 
his boarding bill he couldn't pay, 
He'd get out side of a 
bale of hay. 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
CHORUS. 
The way he would eat, it couldn't be beats 
All kinds of meat, both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat every thing they had in the place, 
And bit a 
big chunk from his mother-in law's face, 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister, and tackled his brother, 
lie swallowed the clock, hit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed up the roof, and swallowed the floor, 
lie chewed up his shoes, he chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat, 
lie chewed umbrellas, and eat up the stove, 
And bit the broadside from the servants girl's nose, 
But he never had enough to eat, from hunger he was sick, 
He'd eat a 
pair of army shoes, and pulverize a 
brick, 
To see him tackel turkey would cause you to smile, 
He'd eat a 
horse and cart, and chase the driver a 
mile. 
He ate so much it made him thin. 
His hair fell out, and his clothes fell in, 
His bones was sticking through his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
He struck this city one fine day, 
But for a 
meal he couldn't pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
Cuoars. 
The very first thing no chanced to meet. 
Was a 
German band coming down the street, 
lie swallowed them all as fast as they come, 
Be chewed up their music, and ate up the drum, 
Ile tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance, and he swallowed them all 
Went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
Went out on election day and swallowed the vote, 
At last he came in Brooklyn town, 
He met big a 
preacher and gobbled him down, 
He swallowed a 
pump picked his teeth with the handle, 
And ate the reporter of the Brooklyn scandal, 
Then getting disgusted with being so light, 
He swallowed himself and went out of sight. 
11 
In August last, on one fine day, • 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
When Josh and I 
went to make hay, 
We went bobbing around, 
Says Josh to me let's take a 
walk, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Then we can have a 
talk, 
As we go bobbing around. 
We walked along to the mountain ridge, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Till we got near Squire Slipshop's bridge, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh and I 
went on a 
spree, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
And I 
kiss'd Josh, and Josh kiss'd me, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh's pluck no longer tarried, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around. 
Says he dear Patience let's get married, 
Then we'll go bobbing around. 
Now I 
knew he lov'd another gal, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
They call'd her long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When he went bobbing around. 
So after we got into church, 
A 
bobbing around, aroun—, arouna, 
I 
cut and left Josh in the lurch, 
Then he went bobbing around. 
So all you chaps what's got a 
gal, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
Do thinx of long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When you go bobbing around. 
tobbing Around.---NO. 2. 
Good evening white folks, here 1 
am, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Just listen to this colored man, 
For I've been bobbing around. 
Whenever I 
promenade the street, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Something new I 
always meet, 
As I 
go bobbing around. 
Our dandies now do dress so strange, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
One would think they were deranged, 
To ee them bobbing around. 
You'd laugh to see them walk the street, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
With Shanghai coats down to their feet, 
As they go bobbing around. 
Our ladies too they look so queer, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
With their bonnets behind their ears, 
As they go bobbing around. 
Their long-tail dresses take the lead, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Sweeping machines we no more need, 
Since they've been bobbing around. 
The Temperance men have passed a 
law, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
But made it worse than it was before, 
For it keeps you bobbing around. 
You must get a 
jug and fill it full, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
And when you're dry you take a 
pull, 
To keep you bobbing around.

String Clam Jimmy. 
Written and sung with great success by NED TA.z.ncrr. 
AIR 
" 
Champagne Charley." 
Some time ago there was a 
nig, 
Who used to go about, 
A screaming " Who'll buy my string clams, 
I 
feel so awful stout." 
This fig he was the size of a 
pig 
A 
feeding in the sty, 
And the only thing that happened him, 
He had a 
string clam eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy was his name, 
I 
us old woman never could make him tame, 
ile'd roar with fright both day and night, 
for String Clam Jimmy was his name, ta ta. 
Now Jimmy he fell in love one day 
With a 
girl with cross-eyed feet ; 
She said she would not let him go 
Until she'd cut his teeth. 
She busted his poor pocketbook, 
Which made him fell so sore; 
She gave him the slip and split his lip, 
Then skipped right out the door. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, &c. 
Dear Jimmy is contented now, 
He never goes about, 
He says bad times has spoiled the trade, 
Now don't that nigger shout. 
Ile feels so weak, he's got a 
cheek 
About three ton and a 
half, 
He looked so nice they put him on ice, 
Z;ow how's that for a 
laugh 2 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, & c.

GET THEE GONE GIRL. 
Written by C. It. Doeksttder, for and sung by J. D. Roome. 
As I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
It's about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk, 
She bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she'd die, 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
lie wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his bide 
With a 
hunk of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his slumbers like a 
hero did say, 
Get thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around and one evening he died, 
Ile opened his mug and he let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last 
Where the torn cats do fight and the bull dogs do eat, 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shovel she wrote, 
Now she gets boiling full and the boys all do shout, 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out.

FRENCH. 
Music by CHA.s. D. BLUM 
I 
am coming, darling, coming, 
Down the dear old shady lane ; 
Tho' the birds and bees are humming, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain: 
For I

will miss you, 
Something softly tells me so; 
So I'm coming, just to kiss you 
Once again before you go. 
Owens. 
I 
am coming, for I'll miss you, 
When you wander to and fro; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
lam coining, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mera'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I 
am coming, di4. 
I

The Songs My Mother Used To Sing. 
Sung by SAM DEvERE. 
The songs my mother used to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again, 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed my every ache and pain. 
Oh I 
how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice; 
Years, long years seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so 
Sweetest recollections cling; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother used to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
loved so well to hear; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs. 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Every simple little strain, 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green; 
Better to me than glittering gold, 
Greater by far than crown of king; 
Dearer to me than all the world, 
Are the Songs- my mother used to sirig.

INFLATION.' 
My beloved brothers and sisters and constituents, allow mo 
to call your particular attention to the great fact that is now 
agitation de public mind; 
if so, why not? can any man say 
otherwise, eh? 
This subject dat I 
am about to exponnd, my 
demoralized fellow-citizens and students, is that of inflation. 
If 
you get a 
Webster's unabridged spelling-book, and turn over 
the leaves, you will find something printed on them, and that 
something is the word inflation—blown up. 
Can any man say 
otherwise? well, if so, why not, eh? 
'Tis a subject that touches 
every one that stands under-
neath the folds of that glorious, ever-waving, star-spangled 
smasher, and reaches from the finest ladies in the land, inflated 
with her own beauty and the blood of youth, to the third-class 
politician, whose majestic soul soars into the realms of hash and 
fish- balls, snd thereby he is inflated by them. 
Now instead of calling a 
man a common drunkard, we oall 
him a 
universal inflationist. 
But where are we now ? for, if soy 
why not? 
Can any man say otherwise? 
Therefore, let us 
have plenty of it, and more too. 
I 
think as I 
stand here I 
can 
produce an argument that will convince you that a 
five dollar 
greenback is even better than a 
five dollar gold piece. 
Now, for 
instance, if a 
man has a 
five dollar gold piece, and it belongs to 
him, what does he do with it? 
Why he puts it in his pocket, 
and if he takes it out a 
year hence, what does he find it? Why 
a 
five dollar gold piece still. 
Now if a man has, on the other 
halal a 
five dollar greenback, and he goes to put it in his pock -
et, he doubks it, so to illustrate—don't he? and if he takes it 
out in five minutes after, he finds it in-creases! 
Can any man 
say otherwise? 
Well, if so, why not ? 
But, for gracious sake, 
don't tell my mother-in-law that I 
said it, or there would be war 
in my domicile.

- JULIA. 
As sang by TONY PAM& 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'LL sing in praise of Julia, a 
proper piece of stuff, 
A 
girl who knows her way about all over, 
She's been there once before, so of course she's up to snuff, 
And I'm the chap who'd like to be her lover; 
Although she seems to favor me somehow I 
cannot make 
An impression on her, though I 
often sound her, 
I 
really do believe, in fact a 
fever I 
will take, 
That there's not a 
living soul who can get round her. 
CHORUS. 
You might get round a 
corner, might get round a 
post, 
You might get round a 
square, and that's peculiar, 
You might get round the town, round the country, round the 
coast. 
But ' twill take you all your time to get round Julia. 
My Julia she is not a 
Westender, you must know, 
For Whitechapel is the place where she is housed up ; 
Although she's very plebian, in fact I 
might say low ; 
Her spirits they are high when they are roused up, 
Just touch her on her tender points, and you will quickly find 
She's not a 
girl on whom you'd ever practice, 
Although to hurt your feelings, she'd not be so unkind; 
But she'd give you a 
straight, because the fact is— 
You might get round a 
corner, etc. 
I 
often try to court her, but find it is no go, 
Although I 
have more influence than any, 
For, when I 
try it on, she quickly lets me know 
With her hands that she for me is one too many, 
Ah, but yet I 
live in hopes that I 
shall marry her some day, 
Although the date's beyond my calculation, 
I 
now know she really loves me, but she never tells me so, 
And so I 
tell you for your information. 
,You might get round a 
corner, etc.

I 
HET a 
lady at a 
ball 
As beautiful as day. 
Of graceful figure, slight and tall, 
And hair like golden spray. 
I 
said this is a 
happy chance, 
And I'm a 
happy man, 
And as I 
led her out to dance 
She laughed behind her fan. 
CHORUS. 
She laughed behind her fan, 
And said " Yon naughty man, 
You shouldn't do so, it's wrong yOu knoW r 
And laughed behind her fan. 
We danced the Lancers and Quadrille, 
Then rested for a 
while, 
But once we nearly had a 
spill 
Thro' some one's clumsy style. 
I 
clasped her waist more tightly then, 
'Twas nea and sweet to span, 
And when her eyes met mine again 
She laughed behind her fan. 
I 
saw her to the carriage door, 
When it was time to leave, 
I 
fancied, but I 
wasn't sure, 
She slightly pressed my sleeve. 
I 
squeezed her hand, the old resource, 
The good old-fashioned plan, 
And as she felt the gentle force 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She langeed, etc. 
I 
saw her- in a 
month or so, 
One Christmas party night, 
And then beneath the mistletoe 
I 
claimed the seiison's rite. 
She said " Oh,.dearl my husband's here, 
I'm sure you never can!" 
And I 
felt queer, for much I 
fear 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc. 
Sholaughed, 
I'll Laugh! And that's Always the 
Last of It. 
Original Music by PROF. JAS. KENNEDY. 
Sung by M. 
FRANK LEWIS,. at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'Tie my maxim in life to at oid care and strife, 
And to walk through this world with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile. 
Let us live by the wy, 
think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You will act a 
wise part if yea take to your heart, 
Every bright ray of light that is hining. 
CHORUS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is past cf it; 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try; 
I'll laugh 1 
and that's the last ol it. 
If the girl that T 
love, she should false to me prove. 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No I 
I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble, would try. 
I'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe ever scorning; 
Though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cloud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for despair, &c. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the sweet cup of joy I 
would quaff; 
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame, 
But my manhood I'd rouse wi h 
a 
laugh; 
n-t 
a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could borrow; 
I'd with patience abide, ' till the turn of the tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a 
fig for despair, .ko.

WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by FIRTH, POND & CO., 547 Broadway, New York 
I wandered by the brook-side, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy whee• was still. 
There was no sou nu of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird— 
/Lind the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
I 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer, 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
He came not, no, he came not ! 
The moon came out alone; 
'The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, silent tears were falling, 
When something stood behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
Ile could not speak a 
word, 
And the beating of own hearth 
Was all the sound we heard.

It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
As sung by Nisi Jennie Hughes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
All the while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice. 
CHORUS.

'Tis sum fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All tlae while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet t 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pass the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears, 
And such lots of sweet nonsence to them say. 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a

Our arms around their wais ts, del ightfully are placed 
All the while we kuow it's naughty but it's nice.

LITTLE BAREFOOT. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by the LA 
VERDE SISTERS. 
Words and Music by FRANK HOWARD. 
STANDING where the bleak winds whistled 
Round her small and fragile form; 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
'Cept to jostle her aside 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She in tones of anguish cried— . 
" 
Mister! Please give me a 
penny, 
For I've not got any Pa— 
Please, Sir, give me just one penny— 
I 
want to buy some bread for Ma!" 
CHORUS. 
While we beg for those with plenty, 
And for them to us unknown, 
We'll not forget our little " bare-foots," 
They are heathens nearer home. 
flailin4 thus each passing stranger, 
As they hurriedly went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
Others cast a 
frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry; 
"I must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die." 
Mister! Please, &c. 
There, one chilly day in winter, 
Barefoot sat upon the pave, 
Outstretched were her little fingers, 
But no pennies did she crave— 
There, while begging bread for Mother, 
Death had chill'd her little heart. 
Yet each day we see some other 
Playing Little Barefoot's part. 
Mister! Pleme, &c.

EYES OF SPARKLING I3RIGHTNESS, 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by the GIRARD BROTHERS. 
Those eyes of sparkling brightvess, 
How they haunt us in our dreams, 
They're as bright as flowing ripples. 
Beneath the sun's bright beams; 
Like dew-drops on the meadow, 
At morning's dawning hour, 
We feel within our heart and soul, 
Love's own sweet magic power. 
Over vale and mountain, (sm.) 
Violets and fountains, (
sym.) 
Then we'll sing the praise of summer days, 
Of eyes that sparkle bright, 
Through weal or woe, whereqr we go, 
They fill us with delight. 
When the nightingale is singing 
Her songs upon the lea, 
We hear sweet voices ringing, 
Of nature gay and free; 
When the sun shines on the river, 
And the shadow's on the hill, 
We'll dream of thee though far away, 
Those eyes will haunt us still. 
Over vale, ate. 
BOLIVAR BILL. 
Written by JIM MASS. 
Sung by J. 
D. 
ROOME, 
Bolivar Bill was a 
pea nut man, 
And he had a 
lovely daughter, 
With eyes that looked like oyster-shells, 
And nose as flat as a 
quarter; 
She was graceful as a 
cord of wood 
Her feet was full of bunions, 
Her mouth was as wide as tl e 
Eri!' 
And her breath was as sweet as onions. 
eito.—And she'd say oh, my! fie, for shame! 
Do you carry a 
pop, sir? 
Go, take a 
drop, sir. 
Oh, my! fie, for shame 
Jimmie, I 
think you're too fresh. 
She dressed up in the latest style, 
She looked just like a 
clothes- rack, 
With a 
horse's tail for a 
wa'er-fall. 
And a 
dish-rag for a 
pin- back, 
With government shoes, about nineteen. 
With a 
brick-bat for a 
locket, 
And a 
big tin pan for a 
diamond pin. 
And a 
ham- bone in her pocket. 
Cuo.—And he'd say, Tat, tar! tat, tar! my l'aby dear 
I'll meet you in the park 
If you treat to lager beer; 
Now, don't you think yourself, 
That you are a 
little queer, 
And, I 
think, the best thing you can do. 
Is slide off on your ear. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And tried his heart to slaughter, 
His hair was red, his teeth were loose, 
And he peddled chalk and water, 
He used to drive a 
stump tail mule, 
With eyes that folks call gugle, 
And when he went to see his girl, 
He whistled Yankee Doodle. 
Cuo.—For he was " the belle of the ball," yes, 
He wouldn't have it at all, yes, 
He sheried he shook her, 
Oh 1 
he had a 
terrible gall.

She hmked for me ne::t day,

Blow your own trumpet when you have the chance, 
It's a 
maxim I'll practice and preach, 
And sound your own praises, if-you would advance, 
Is what I'll endeavor to teach. 
Modesty's charming, no doubt, in its place, 
But I'm sorry to say it don't pay, 
For the madest man finds that he's soon left behind 
By the man who had plenty to say. 
Cnonus. 
Blow your own Trumpet where ever you go. 
For nobody else will, if you don't, you know, 
Make man respect you, or they will neglect you, 
Blow your own Trumpet yourself, you know. 
There have been men of genius who have died of despair. 
Unrewarded by fortune and fame; 
In vain they have struggled for many long years, 
They could not establish a 
name. 
Perhaps you will ask me the reason, it is, 
Their modesty caused their defeat, 
They've been passed, in the road, for position and place. 
By some numskull with heaps of conceit. 
Blow your own trumpet, &c. 
So, if you have talent, don't hide it, my friend, 
That is if to rise you aspire, 
The higher you raise it, the more men will praise it, 
If you tell them just what to admire; 
For the public will follow the jeader, my boys, 
Like sheep that are led to a 
fold ; 
So if you just tell them how clever you are. 
Ten to one, they'll believe what they're told. 
Blow your own trumpet, &c. 
Blow your own Trumpet and blazon your name, 
Wherever you happen to be, 
Don't wait for a 
herald to trumpet your name, 
If distinguished you're anxious to be 
Don't go to the rear, but push on, never fear, 
And do not forget my advice, 
But blow your own Trumpet as onward you go, 
And you'll get to the front in a 
trice. 
Blow your own Trumpet. &e, 
Broken Down. 
ONCE I'd money plenty, 
And. friends, too, by the score; 
Then fortune smiled upon me, 
And no one passed my door. 
Now I'm poor and. lonely, 
And not worth five cents, 
No one seems to know me— 
I'm completely broken down 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frow:L: 
No one seems to know Inc now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last, 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred 
But now for want of "bread" a'. 
I 
have to " fast" instead. 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says: " All the world's a 
stage," 
And every man must " play his part," 
From childhood to old age;

Good Evening, to you, white folks, all— 
We have just come here to sing our little dity; 
It's about those times that's past and gone-

He used to feed us on hoe cakes— 
But now we have sang our gags, 
We'll good go back to old Jim and Jack Rags. 
White folks, we can no longer stay, 
The Bugle sounds, of course we must away; 
I 
hope that I, kind friends, will forgive us, 
We'll go back again to the Grand Old Home. 
Our Massa was as good a

FASHIONABLE BEATS. 
Sung by J. D. ROOME.

Now, look out, boys, I'm coming. with 
Another rhyming treat, 
'Tis all about these Grand Mogtus 
Called fashionable bea's. 
They're such a 
lot of amiables, 
With such a 
gorgeous strut, 
'Twould be a 
pity to take them down, 
So I'll just show them up. 
CHORUS. 
Cheeky snoozers, sidewalk cruisers, 
Twirling their sticks—'nough to make a 
dog sick 
Dyed mustachios, waxed mustachios, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
You'll find them on big hotel steps, 
With toothpicks in their teeth, 
After eating cheese and crackers at 
The free-lunch bar beneath. 
And while talking dollars, dog, and horle, 
Just like some moneyed swell, 
They'll boast of how they dined and wined, 
_Al such and such hotel

flashy, flashy, anything but easily, 
Talking stock shares like some great millionaires 
Garret lodgers, creditor dodgers, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
They sneer at honest workingmen, 
While they all labor shirk: 
They live and sponge on others, but, 
Themselves, they never work. 
They toll around on corners, and 
At ladies boldly stare, 
But never pay their tailors for 
The flashy clothes they wear. 
Cn onus. 
Windy, gassy, cheeky, brassy, 
Putting on dash, without one cent of cash 
Free-lunch eaters, wash-women cheaters. 
That's the style of our fashionable )eats.

INCREASE OF CRIME. [Parody.] 
Composed by JERRY COHAN. 
Sung by J. D Room?.. 
Copyright 1877. hy A. 
d. Fisn ER, 9S Nassau Street, New York. 
I 
have recently been indulging in profound meditations, 
And the result of my reflections it is difficult to express. 
I 
have pondered on unreasonable individual contemplations 
BegaEding our nation's tendency to multiply misdemeanors; 
Uncle Samuel ejaculates ' tis extremely enigmatical 
And decidedly beyond my utmost comprehension. 
I 
would forfeit a 
diminutive consideration to derive information. 
Why progress of criminal license should demoralize our terra 
firma 
Together with peaceful inclinations, we have an unlimited 
amount of bullion : 
Our s;iving institutions require no pec.miary replenishing. 
We 
could purchase entire, the elements. according to informants, 
And still there's an increase of crime. 
Uncle Samuel there is truth in your singular conclusions. 
The tempter is infinitely difficult to successfully overcome; 
Behold the laboring portion of our female community. 
Exacting their utmost endeavors to sustain existence: 
Can you express astonishment at the occasional degradation. 
When penurious proprietors unfeelingly proffer 
Insufficient means to allay a 
destitute condition: 
In poverty a 
female would expire without lucrative assistance. 
Preserve our female manipulator of needles, most Omnipotent. 
Her sensibilities are refined and correspondingly sensitive 
As vain female cosmopolitans of gigantic arrogance 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
If you'll listen to me, just for a 
few minutes. 
I'll tell you of a 
dream I 
had the other night: 
I 
thought I 
saw an animal they call the Eackerinas 
Sitting on a 
wood- pile smoking a 
pipe, 
I 
thought I 
saw a 
bull- dog a- rolling a 
barrel, 
A 
one- eyed owl way up in a 
tree, 
Rats in the cupboard are getting mighty bold 
Because they live on:Limburgher cheese. 
Cliouus. 
Hop along Peer. 
Hop along Peter. 
Hop along Peter, dress mighty tine, 
Never go back on a 
gooseberry-vin. 
'Possum in a 
hay-loft playing casino. 
Big bull- frog singing bass, 
Gander and a 
goose doing double shuffle, 
And a 
little weasel washing his face, 
Double- headed pigeon throwing flip- flaps, 
Squint-eyed cats hunting up mice, 
Parrot and a 
jay-bird having a 
prize-fight. 
Spider in a 
cob- web throwing dice. 
Slianghie crowed until ' twas morning, 
A 
black-and-tan pig stood on his head, 
A. great big monkey was doing a 
trapeze. 
And a 
little sketer playing off dead, 
Cross-eyed grasshopper saying his prayers, 
The bees a- singing loud and high, 
Kangaroo playing tag with his brother, 
And bald-headed spider coaxing in a 
fly. 
Hop along, 
BIG-FOOT SAL, 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by J. L. 
FREENY, expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME, Banjoist. 
The gal that I 
will sing about, 
Is very fond of me 
Around the waist she's very stout, 
And stands about ten foot three. 
Her foot is a 
tremendous size— 
She wears number twenty-two; 
Her ears are like an elephant's, 
And she walks like a 
kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, she's the gal, 
That's known by every one; 
She can waltz on her ear, and drink lager beer, 
And she weighs about five ton. 
She can sing, and play the old banjo, 
At that she can't be beat; 
And dance the light fantastic toe, 
With her tremendous feet. 
Her mouth resembles a 
railroad tunnel; 
She presents a 
terrible sight; 
Her hand would cover an acre of ground; 
Like a 
bull dog she can fight. 
Oh, big foot Sal, etc. 
She went to a 
ball the other night, 
And what do you think she done ? 
To raise a 
muss, she put out the light, 
Then took to her heels and run. 
The gals did scream, the men did shout, 
To catch that crazy gal; 
But there wasn't a 
man with cluck enough, 
To tackle tag-lou). 
Oh, big- foot Sal, etc. 
As sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
LADIES' 
VERSION. 
WHEN first a 
courting I 
began, I 
was so shy, pray under-
stand, 
And how I 
was served by my young man, forget that 
night I 
never can; 
it was at a 
party, you must know, and underneath the 
mistletoe, 
Said he, I 
love you, cousin Chris; and then he stole from 
me a 
kiss. 
CHORUS. 
He kiss'd me once, how 'shamed I 
was, 
He kiss'd me twice, hey, how 'shamed I 
was; 
He kiss'd me thrice, and said it was nice, 
La! no one knows how 'shamed I 
was. 
First we danced and then we sang, our voices thro' the 
whole house rang, 
And all enjoyed themselves but I 
really felt so dreadful 
shy; 
Soon I 
found I 
was in love, for cousin Fred call'd me a 
dove, 
He pressed my hand and then said this, I 
intend to have 
another kiss. 
Then he kiss'd me once, & c. 
When he kiss'd me the second time, I 
heard Big Ben com-
mence to chime, 
The clock struck twelve and then you know I 
thought it 
was quite time to go; 
So wished good night to every one, who hoped I 
had en-
joyed the fun, 
So Freddy thought it 'twoul.cln't be amiss just to steal 
another kiss. 
Then he kiss'd me once, & c. 
He saw me home, it's really true, and we chatted on ;;:i 
lovers do, 
I 
don't remember all he said, I 
know he asked if I 
v,.ould 
wed; 
I 
felt I 
blushed, turned very red, and said, I'll marry yOu 
dear Fred, 
Said he I 
feel so happy, Miss, that we'll seal the bargain 
with a 
kiss.

Iler name was Selina Belinda CroW, 
And I 
thought her so tender and mild; 
I 
called on her every day ye know, 
And followed her just like a 
child; 
I 
poured out my heart to Belinda Crow, 
Said for her to the end of the world I'd go; 
But she giggled at me and my love ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
3 I 
bought her a 
beautiful duck one day, 
And a 
basket with eatables piled; 
She said, Tommy, come in the evening, pray, 
And potatoes we'll have with it biled. 
I'll be out all the day, said Selina Crow, 
Come at ten o'clock, then 
be in you know; 
That's the night I 
received such a 
terrible blow, 
And it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
New trousers I 
wore that cest fourteen and six, 
Had my hair cut and beautifully ikd; 
In the evening I 
called at her house about six, 
As the time I 
thought might be beguiled; 
I 
looked in at the winder and didn't I 
stare, 
Miss Crow and a 
dapper young man were there; 
They were eating away at my duck I 
declare, 
Oh! it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho.—I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
5 I 
rushed on the pair like a 
lion ye know, 
And I'm sure I 
look'd awfully wild; 
Crying, oh! you deceitful, you false young Crow, 
But she turned up her nose and she smiled; 
Then the yoUng man arose and to me did say, 
With his mouth full of duck for which I 
did pay; 
That young lady's my wife, we were married to day', 
Oh, it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
6 
Said I, you're a 
swindler and cheat, Miss Crow, 
Said her husband, I 
say, draw it mild; 
Then he kicked me right into the street ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild; 
I 
certainly thought lhey were very unkind, 
And I 
think that the sr might have enquired if I'd dined; 
1 
get mad even now when it crosses my mild, 
And it makes me so awfully wild. 
CU. —I 
really felt ilreaafully riled ye know. 
THE LETTER IN THE CANDLt. 
As sung by ALICE BEN/N.61i. 
Xords by JAMES CLARE. 
Arr. by GEORGE T. 
Everp• 
Published by M. GRAY, Sacramento, California. 
Price 80 cents. 
There's a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct 4o 
me ; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whomever can it be ? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray ; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And send a 
loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And speed the loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh ! superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark, &c 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months, no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle, 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger, 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
flow welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark,

Robin again with you-- 
Ito - bin 
ne-ver again with you. 
The Lads in the village, by chance seeing me, 
Whisp'ring will speak of you; 
They hint, with a 
smile, of a 
wedding to be, 
But Robin you know it's not true, 
But Robin you know it's not true; 
And the girls they were asking but last market day, 
" 
Would my bonnet be white or blue." 
So never by brook or in meadow I'll stray, 
Robin again with you, 
Robin never again with you. 
There's never a 
night but across the dark lake, 
Jamie comes here, to woo, 
With vow, he would " die any day for my sake," 
And I'm sure that he loves me true, 
I'm sure that he loves me true; 
So now if there's nothing you're waiting to say, 
Don't you think we had best say: " adieu." 
Then never by brook or in meadow I'll stray, 
Robin again with you, 
Robin never again with you!

NIGGER DAT KNOWS HIS PLACE. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year ISM. by A.J 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Music by Wm. CA.RTER. 
Now my banjo is in tune, I'm feeling happy; 
I 
think dat I 
can sing a 
lively song, 
So if you'll listen, I 
will try to please you. 
I 
also make the rhyme while I 
go along. 
Since I 
commenced to vote I 
am no prouder. 
Cause to be dat way I 
tink it's a 
disgrace ; 
I 
radder kill myself by taking chowder; 
I'm a 
nigger man dat always I:mows his place. 
Josephus Persimon Leaf, 
I'm de greatest nigger in de collor'd race ; 
You bet dat you can reckon on me truly; 
I'm de nigger man dat always knows his place 
We all know dat it's coming close to lection ; 
Our country, too, is worked up to a 
heat; 
Segars, some people think they are perfection, 
While other ones are always on the beat. 
We are at peace with every other nation, 
De Eagle 's 
soaring high on land and sea. 
I 
tell you ' tis a 
splendid situation, 
And I 
hope de same it will forever be. 
Sunsh:ne—ain't it prime--
For ourselves, if truly, isn't a 
disgrace. 
I'm as happy as a 
c'am down in de cellar, 
I'm de nigger man dat always knows his place.

The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love. 
As sung by LurA M ORT1MOR. 
Published by E. II. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot. 
All around you may be ice. 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze, 
As you both gaze afar; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
..l'OKEN.—When you *are in love, and sitting on some ro-
tantic cliff, by the light of the moon you gaze in the girl's 
face, and imagine how much powder and rouge she has been 
putting on; and she's thinking at the same time what express-
ive eves, how his nose turns up, and I 
think I 
should love him 
a 
little more if it was a Roman, and the moon is winking at 
you and seems to say— 
Ciro.—The man in the moon is looking, love, 
He's winking, love, he's blinking, love : 
And each little star can tell where you are, 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, on Dover cliffs, 
A 
girl sat there with me ; 
The moon above kept peeping ou 
With look of naughty glee. 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said. 
Don't be a 
timid miss, 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud 
,Tust one sweet little kiss. 
SPOKEN — Not now. 
Don't you see the man ? 
What man ? 
Why, the man in the moon! 
He's laughing at us. 
But just 
one, dear! 
No, no!—(CnoRus.) 
As we sat gazing at the moon, 
Like spooney lovers do, 
My arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two. 
I 
heard the moon say to the stars, 
That pair I'll go and wed, 
And as the moon came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SPOKEN.—It was a dream. 
I 
was not on Dover cliff sitting 
with a 
girl by moonlight. 
I was in bed at Brixton with a 
rushlight shining upon me, and dreaming it was the moon, and 
my darling Matilda saying—(Citoaus.)

Sung by Andy Collum. 
As I 
was coming down Broadway to- day, 
The boot-blacks ou the corner at leisure did play, 
They all looked up and saw me by chance, 
Cried one stag the gauk he's got fringe on his pant. ; 
I 
took my girl to the ball last night, 
The gang on the floor commenced for to fight, 
My daisy got drunk and they slugged her by chance. 
For mashing a 
sue who had tar on his pants. 
Now all you young blokes take a 
warning from Inc, 
Oh, never get married how sorry you'll be, 
You'll go to the parks and you will meet them by chance, 
But beware of the daisy who wears fringe on her over-alls.

HARD UP. 
Written and sung by HARRY W OODSON. 
Oh where is all my money gone to ? 
Oh! where is my friends I 
used to treat? 
Now I 
can't get a 
drink when I 
want in, 
For they call me an old played- out dead beat. 
Once I 
had money and friends too—yes, plenty, 
But now they all since have flown, 
For my stomach and pockets they are empty, 
And I've got ne'er a 
red to call my own. 
CHORUS. 
Nary red, nary red, 
Nary a 
single red cent to call my own. 
Nary red, nary red, 
Nary a 
single red cent to call my own. 
T 
ow bloated, forlorn and dejected, 
My clothes are all ragged and coarse, 
I 
am homeless, despised and neglected, 
And covered with shame and remorse; 
Oh ! where arG the treasures that have vanished ? 
That were mine when the girls I 
used to court, 
Where has my suit of broadcloth gone to ? 
And my handsome watch and chain I 
used to sport, 
CHORUS. 
Up the spout, up the spout, 
You will know the place by three golden balls; 
Up the spout, up the spout, 
The rum- sellers got my money all.

and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
Sour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an , 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
Method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
16 meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dill!. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the difd-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  ... • Price 25 Cents.
