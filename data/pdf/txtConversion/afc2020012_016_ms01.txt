[0:00] Introduction to Cody Clark, where he grew up, his formative childhood experiences and 
his family.  Cody talks about growing up in the South, being a part of a blue collar family, and 
what he wanted to do when he grew up. 
 
[5:34] Cody talks about the jobs his mother and father have, his mother being a teacher and his 
stepfather being a land surveyor.  He talks about his biological father being in the Army but 
being more influenced to join because he brother had enlisted.  Cody talks about enlisting at 19 
after trying to live on his own. 
 
[9:13] Cody’s childhood and how being a kid who liked to cause trouble led to him losing 
electronic devices which led him to become interested in reading books.  Cody became interested 
in travel, cooking, and going to places very different from Texas after experiencing the 
fantastical nature of books.  While many people in his area turned to blue collar jobs or sports, 
Cody wanted to do something different. 
 
[14:00] Cody’s arrival to his first posting and how the Army taught him to redirect anger from 
childhood bullying into something more constructive.  Cody talks about his ambition to be 
promoted, how he found position of Behavioral Health Technician, and the different places he 
was stationed. 
 
[20:09] Cody’s training for the Behavioral Health Technician position and what he learned to 
prepare for the job. 
 
[22:02] The patients Cody treated, the fun experiences he had with the 82nd Airborne Division, 
and his experience in the first days of his position.  Cody talks about the different types of 
evaluations he did, what different areas of the position he learned, and what areas he did not 
pursue.  Cody also talks about different diagnoses and gives examples of what some of his 
patients had experienced. 
 
[29:40] Cody talks about the percentage of people who are accepted into the military, including 
the rigorous testing people undergo before they are accepted, and the common conditions he saw 
in his patients.   
 
[32:04] Cody explains the general opinion people in the Army have of mental health 
professionals.  He explains why some people wait until close to their retirement to see mental 
health professionals and gives another example of a specific patient he saw.  Cody talks about 
the difficult but rewarding aspects of the work he did.

mental health professionals and how he was able to build rapport with his patients. 
 
[55:20] What Cody did in the Army outside of his work as a Behavioral Health Technician.  
When he knew it was time to leave and what he wanted to pursue educationally and emotionally 
to preserve his own mental health. 
 
[58:33] Cody’s take on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what kinds of 
diagnoses he’s seeing more of as a result.  He talks about how he copes with stress and what he 
does to avoid anxiety and stress.  He talks about living in New York and what he’s seen during 
the pandemic in a large city versus how his family in a small town is experiencing it.  Cody also 
talks about his experience interning in a hospital during COVID-19. 
 
[1:05:56] Specific examples of Cody’s mentors and what each of them has helped him learn.  He

HS: Hi, Cody.  Thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this Library of Congress oral 
history project.  I’d like to open our discussion by inviting you to introduce yourself and share a 
little bit about you. 
 
CC: Yeah.  Of course.  My name’s Cody Andrew Clark.  I was born 
 1992.  I’m 
originally from Texas, a real small town called Celeste, Texas.  At the time when I was growing 
up, it was a small town of about maybe 850 people, a really small, somewhat farming 
community.  That’s that’s really where I’m from.  I don’t know if you want to ask any further 
about that, but. 
 
HS: Yes.  Let’s dive into a little bit about your early life, if you’re comfortable with that? 
 
CC: Certainly, yeah.  I’ll get into it. 
 
HS: I’m curious about what it would be like to grow up in a small town in Texas in the 1990s.  
Was there anything that was formative to your experiences then, that sticks out to you as an 
adult? 
 
CC: Yeah.  It’s such a weird thing really, because, formally speaking, you don’t know where 
you’re at in the world, as far as culturally, until you leave it.  So a lot of my early formative 
experiences were these very, very southern experiences and ideas.  Most of my childhood, I was 
raised very religiously.  So, Southern Baptist was what we were.  Every Sunday we would go 
over to my grandmother’s house after church and she would cook a lunch, and it was southern 
soul food, a lot of things like that.  Lots of football, lots of sports, things like that.  That was 
really nice, but then there was also some negative aspects about growing up in the south that you 
didn’t really get until you got a little bit older, so. 
 
HS: When we’re all younger, we always dream about what we’re going to be when we grow up.  
When you were younger, what did you want to be and is it in any way related to who you ended 
up becoming today? 
 
CC: Let’s see.  So, younger, I went - I was a weird kid.  I was a weird kid, because I - this is 
really good and really reflective of where I am now.  Growing up I wanted to be everything that 
kids want to be.  I was like, I want to be a firefighter, I want to be a pastor - which is absurd to 
me now - but I wanted to do a lot of different things and none of them were related to where I am 
now in my life and my career.  So, yeah, I can’t say for sure what I think I wanted to be when I 
was a kid.  I know I did say I wanted to be a pastor at one point, and that was - that obviously 
didn’t pan out, so. 
 
HS: What did your parents do?  And if you have any siblings, who are your siblings and what are 
they like?

5                                                                                                                                            2020012 
 
CC: Right.  So, my siblings - all right, my parents - real blue collar family.  My dad - this is 
where it gets tricky.  Okay.  Do you mind if I take a step back to kind of explain this a bit? 
 
HS: Please do. 
 
CC: So, I was raised - until I was five years old, I was raised by my biological mother because 
my biological father left when I was a child.  I was born, he said I don’t want anything to do with 
you, I’m out.  He left, and I didn’t really hear from him again until I was maybe nine, and then 
again when I was 18.  So, until the age of 5, it was me, my mom and my older brother, Chris, 
who is four years my senior.  We were just absolutely dirt poor, because you can imagine, a 
woman without a college degree - that’s what my mom was, because she started having kids 
when she was 19, we were phenomenally poor.  She did things like being a waiter, working at 
Dairy Queen, things this.  It didn’t really work out well.  Things didn’t start to pick up until she 
met my stepfather when I was five years old, they ended up getting married.  My stepfather was 
a land surveyor, which is not an illustrious career but it still helped provide dual income family.  
Four years later, my mom gave birth to my little sister, Emily.  Eventually, about when my mom 
was about 30, she went back to school - or went to school - and she got her bachelors in 
education and she became a teacher.  So, stepfather who I consider my dad, Russell, great guy, 
and he was a land surveyor, and my mom is a teacher - still a teacher.  Yeah. 
 
[5:34] HS: What does your mom teach, and can you speak a little bit about what a land surveyor 
is? 
 
CC: Oh, of course, yeah.  So, my mom teaches first grade.  She teaches first grade, and she’s 
very passionate about it.  She loves children, and I think that’s a very good - it’s a great career 
path for her.  By the way, as a side commentary, she works far harder than I think that any 
teacher should have to and gets paid far less than what they deserve.  My stepdad, my dad - when 
I ever refer to my biological dad, I’ll just say my biological dad - he’s a land surveyor.  So, what 
a land surveyor is, is essentially - think of the earth as a map that has these imaginary lines on it 
that dictate where property ends, begins, shows on city plans, where streets are marked and 
property lines.  Maybe you cut off a piece of property and you sell it to your neighbor, a land 
surveyor will come in and they’ll do these very, very precise measurements, and then that gets 
recorded and it ends up in City Hall.  Anyways, it’s a very blue collar job and that’s kind of what 
my dad has done since he was maybe 22, and still does now at the ripe age of 60.  Yeah.  So 
that’s what my parents do. 
 
HS: So, you ended up enlisting - excuse me, joining the armed forces later in life.  Was there 
anyone in your family who had previously joined the armed forces? 
 
CC: Certainly.  My biological dad joined really young, I think.  Yeah, he joined after I was born, 
I believe, and that didn’t play anything into me joining, because I had no idea about this until 
later in life.  And the year I joined, my older brother Chris had just left the service and then I 
ended up joining because I was - again, when I was 18, I graduated high school, 19 I joined the

Army.  In that hour - or, not hour, but that year between, I was phenomenally poor because I 
tried to live on my own.  I was eating ramen noodles and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, 
like, every day for every meal, and I just couldn’t do it anymore.  I thought to myself, all right, 
my brother joined, whatever, at least it’ll give me food and some place to stay, and that’s 
enough.  At the time, I never really thought about pursuing an education but that came of it 
eventually.  So, yeah, of course. 
 
HS: You describe yourself as kind of a weird kid and when you were growing up, you were 
doing things that sort of - to me, it sounds you ended up in the Army, it wasn’t a goal or an 
aspiration that you had since you were a kid.  What happened in the years, as you were going 
through your education, to sort of get you to this place where you wanted to join the Army?  You 
spoke a little bit about the economic factors and the familial influences with your brother.  Was 
there anything else that made this a really appealing option for you? 
 
[9:13] CC: Yeah.  So, growing up, I was - one, I was a troublemaker.  I wasn’t really a 
troublemaker that I wanted to cause trouble, I was just mischievous.  So, always getting into 
things, making jokes in class.  So, as a punishment, your mom says, “Okay.  You can’t - I’m 
taking away your Xbox, I’m taking away your PlayStation,” whatever it was, from the years of, 
like, 1992 leading up to 2011.  Yeah.  Takes away everything, and I just - I was always very 
resistant to these things.  So it came to a point in my life to where I had nothing in my room 
except for my bed and books.  So, I’ve read a lot of books.  I read so many books.  I read Lord of 
the Rings in its entirety by the time I think it was, like, 12.  So this kind of put into my head the 
idea of fantastical places, and this idea of travel and adventure.  I was also - as another part to 
this, as a kid, I was weird.  I would watch the Food Channel a lot and I would watch the Travel 
Channel a lot.  Now, at this point in time, the Travel Channel actually had travel stuff on it, so I 
would be looking at top five places to visit in Algiers, or some other thing, or the biggest hotel in 
the world, and these things were so interesting to me.  It was so interesting to me that, in some 
point in time in my head, I wanted to leave where I was from.  Because while the South, and 
especially these small farming communities, they have these very unique charm to them, when 
you’re a young kid and you’re reading about these fantastical places in the world, it just makes 
you want to get out and experience something else.  And further to this point, when I say that I 
was a weird kid, on top of those things, I was never very super southern.  A lot of the young men 
became welders and plumbers, played sports, all that.  I was like, no, I don’t want anything to do 
with that.  I had no desire to play sports.  I was a really skinny, nerdy guy, and I just wanted to 
read my books and go somewhere different and try interesting things.  I think all of those things 
kind of created this perfect stew of influences to help make me desire to do something better for 
myself.  I also had quite a bit of friends, I would say mentors.  There was this one mentor - you 
can cut me off if I’m going too deep into this.  There was this one mentor named Chris, who kind 
of took me in in high school and kind of showed me how to work with my hands a lot.  He also 
was like - at one point in time, he kind of pulled me aside and he’s like, “Hey, listen, you can’t 
do this forever.  You can’t be working with your hands like this.  This isn’t - there’s no longevity 
to this,” and I expressed some interest in joining the Army, and he’s like, “Hey, you really want 
to become something of yourself, you really should do that.”  And I think it was an

amalgamation of all of those influences that really pushed me towards pursuing the military as a 
last ditch effort.  I was a bit of a hippie when I was a young man, so I was just, “Hey, whatever it 
takes.  Right?” 
 
HS: So, what year did you join the Army and what were your early experiences like in the 
Army? 
 
CC: Right.  So, I joined the Army - I still remember it very vividly because it was just so jarring.  
I joined the Army March 12, 2012.  That was my very first day of me getting off that bus and 
stepping into Fort Benning, North Carolina, that started my military career.  You asked me what 
my initial experiences were like? 
 
HS: Yeah, the couple early years, or boot camp, or anything that came formatively for you. 
 
[14:00] CC: Okay.  So, I’ll work through this.  It’s going to take, like, seven minutes for me to 
get through this.  So, 
, 2012, get off the bus.  I’m 6’3.  A description of me, I’m 6’3.  
Currently I weight about 215 pounds.  When I first joined the Army and I got to Fort Benning, 
Georgia - it’s Georgia, not North Carolina - Fort Benning, Georgia, I weighed approximately 155 
pounds.  So I was this tiny little guy, and I was - to not be too crude about it, I had a tough time 
because I was kind of the runt.  I was the guy who no one wanted to pick for these competitive 
events.  I was struggling, but one of the good things that came out of basic training was, it 
instilled being picked on early in my childhood, which I did.  I got bullied quite a bit.  I had this 
inner rage and anger, and the military was kind of like, hey, do you want to improve yourself?  
This is how you do it.  It taught me how to exercise, it taught me how to work towards 
something, it gave me a goal to strive towards.  And that, just, inner rage from the things that I 
experienced when I was younger - because, mind you, as we were just speaking, a lot of my 
childhood was just me reading books alone.  So I had this immense amount of anger, and it gave 
me this drive to try to, like, push through something, towards something.  I hated that I was 
surrounded by people who were better than me, and the military gives you this step-by-step 
process of, like, yeah you want to be successful?  This is how you do it, this is how you 
accomplish these goals.  So it really, really was the catalyst to who I am now, and that was only 
basic training.  I was still very - I could be brash, occasionally ran my mouth too much, but I was 
still very good-natured and I still had this drive, so I kind of pushed through.  My first duty 
station was El Paso, Texas, which is Fort Bliss, I spent three years there.  I got promoted to 
sergeant because, again, I was hungry.  Probably my favorite unit, by the way, it was fantastic, 
people were immensely kind to me.  That’s when I first started working in mental health.  My 
second unit was Fort Detrick, Maryland, which was a fantastic experience for me.  It kind of took 
a little bit of the edge off of the whole military experience and it showed me a more humanistic 
aspect of what it is to be a leader.  And then, I ended my career at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 
which was such an interesting experience.  By that time, I was in my mid 20s and I was very - 
they’re very indoctrinated there.  They have a very immense pride in airborne operations, and I 
was kind of like, yeah, yeah, okay, you guys are you guys are cool.  But yeah, I don’t know if

you want me to go much more into the military thing, because a lot of that is tied into clinical 
experiences as well. 
 
HS: Let’s definitely dive into how you ended up working as a mental health tech, and did you 
see it coming? 
 
CC: Behavioral Health Technician. 
 
HS: Okay. 
 
CC: 68X, Behavioral Health Technician.  At the time of my enlisting, that’s what it was called.  I 
don’t know what it’s called now.  So I became a Behavioral Health Technician.  Now, it’s 2012, 
there’s scrawny little Cody and I’m sitting in this recruiter’s chair in McKinney, Texas.  He’s 
just pulling up jobs, and he’s like, yeah, what do you want to do, man?  And I’m just thinking - 
again, at this time, I’m a little dude and I didn’t want to choose a career path that could be too 
difficult, because at the same time I was still very scared.  I was very scared about a lot of things 
in life.  So, he brought up this very niche job which is called Behavioral Health Technician.  It’s 
mental health.  I open up the flyer, and I’m looking at it.  I’m like, oh, this is one of the jobs that 
I had highlighted.  And as many people who get into behavioral health, psychology, clinical 
therapy, whatever you want to call it, I also struggled with depression through my life.  So that 
became immensely interesting to me, because I thought, wow, I can help people and I can also 
learn about myself, and at the same time, this doesn’t seem too physically taxing.  Unbeknownst 
to me, I would get into the physically taxing stuff a lot more later on because I became really 
interested in that.  So, yeah, that’s how I got into the role.  Do you want - what else do you want 
to know about that?  Because that’s what I really - that’s how I picked the job, as a whole. 
 
[20:09] HS: When you picked the job, what was the training like to prepare for the job?   
 
CC: Remind me to go more into the stuff that I got to do as a Behavioral Health Tech, because 
that, I think, is very interesting now that I’m on the civilian side, but.  So, the training was a very, 
very intense crash course at Fort Sam, Houston, Texas.  For 16 weeks, we were given an 
immense amount of information in clinical psychology, medication, testing, everything.  How to 
restrain patients, how to interview patients, the textbook stuff, the practical stuff, it was a lot.  At 
the first day, they were talking to us and they’re like, listen, you’re not going to remember all of 
this because we’re giving you a gallon and your head is a shot glass.  So, just take in what you 
can take in but you’re not going to take in all of it, and I certainly didn’t, I tried.  I did pretty 
decently well but, at the same time, I wasn’t paying attention too much because I was still very 
mischievous and I would rather flirt with girls in my class than pay attention to what I was 
supposed to be paying attention to.  But yeah, it was really interesting and I got to do some other 
cool stuff. 
 
HS: So you had this crash course, you’re beginning your job as a behavioral health tech, what is 
the day-to-day like?  What’s your work environment like, what patients do you interact with?

Feel free to take this in any direction.  I can follow-up with whatever questions are good to 
follow that path. 
 
[22:02] CC: Yeah.  So it’s a two - I worked primarily in an embedded behavioral health clinic in 
a combat brigade.  So, an embedded behavioral health clinic is essentially - it’s, hey, we have all 
of our behavioral health resources within this unit, right?  So, I had a stagnant population pool.  I 
mean, they weren’t stagnant because people would leave and go, but I knew who I was treating 
because I knew that it was these 4,000 soldiers that we were responsible for from these units.  
Now, because it was a combat brigade, I got to do some really fun stuff on the other side of it, 
like go on training missions.  I would go out to the field, drive tanks around and stuff, that was 
really cool.  I went airborne, when I went to the 82nd Airborne Division, which, airborne is just 
jumping out of planes for dummies.  They make it to where you almost can’t kill yourself.  But 
yeah, that was the field aspect of it, that was the combat brigade side of it.  And then, there was 
the clinical aspects of it.  Working in the civilian sector now, I am able to realize that I was able 
to do an immense amount of things that only a licensed professional should be able to do.  But 
it’s the military, so it’s like, go for it.  How much do you want to do?  I don’t know, whatever 
you want.  So, from the clinical aspect, they started you off easy.  They’d say, “Okay.  You work 
the front desk.  And then, after you get good at the front desk, you start triaging patient.  You 
start triaging patients, and then eventually you’ll lean into it a little bit more,” and then I really 
leaned into it.  So I started doing things that only a physician was supposed to be able to do, 
which, that included recruiter evaluations, drill sergeant evaluations, special forces evaluations.  I 
taught a sleep hygiene class for three years.  Let’s see, what else did I do?  I assisted with trauma 
groups.  I sat in on one sexual trauma group, but I was like, no, this is a terrible idea.  The doctor 
was like, “Yeah.  This is - it’s too much.  We can’t have a male in the room.”  But I did a lot of 
stuff like that that’s outside the auspices of what is traditionally considered a behavioral health 
technician.  On the civilian sector, behavioral technicians primarily escort patients around and 
make sure they don’t get up to any mischief.  But, at one point, not only did I coordinate with 
outside facilities, I was a care coordinator for outside facilities and arranging treatment for things 
like specialized care for, let’s say, bulimia, eating disorders, what have you, but I would also do 
these follow-up appointments with some of these more mild cases, which is absurd to think about 
now, but they’d be, “Yeah.  How about you just do this follow-up appointment and see how this 
patient is doing?”  And then, I’d go in, write my note, send it to the provider, they’d sign off on 
it.  So I got to do - have some of those really, really intense, enjoyable experiences working as a 
behavioral health technician.  But, at the same time, it was so much.  It was so much for - 
because, mind you, I started doing this when I was 19.  I was a 19 year old kid.  Not that all 19 
year olds are kids, but when you get older, you start to realize that 19 is a kid.  You’re a kid 
when you’re 19.  So, you would just have things - patients come in, and they would - I wouldn’t 
be ready, but I had to be.  So, a patient would come in and they would - it’d be like - I remember, 
I think I could have - I might have been maybe 21 when this patient came in.  Patient comes into 
my office - and no, I’m not violating HIPAA here because I know that I’m not giving any patient 
information out.  But the patient came in, and he sat down.  I was like, “Hey, brother.  What can 
I do for you?  How you doing?”  You know, a lot of people are like, yeah, I hate my command.  
They ignore my my PT profile, they’re making me run.  A lot of stuff like that, which would be

adjustment disorder, right?  But this guy sits down and he just starts crying - I’m 21.  Come to 
find out, his girlfriend died in a car crash the night before.  This is first thing in the morning, it’s 
7:30 AM.  He starts crying, and he’s telling me that his girlfriend just died.  And when you’re 
that young, you have a really hard time, kind of, dealing with that level of raw human emotion, 
because - when I was 21, most kids were in college, playing beer pong and chilling with their 
boys, and I have this grown man across from me that’s crying, telling me that his girlfriend died.  
And the worst case about bereavement is that when a patient is suffering from bereavement, 
there’s nothing you can do for them, there’s nothing.  If someone has bipolar or maybe 
borderline personality disorder, I can be like, “Okay.  Borderline personality disorder, we’ll get 
you enrolled in a DBT therapy group.”  “Depression, gotcha.  We’ll throw some medications 
your way.  We can do that.  We can work you through therapy.”  Bereavement is so tough 
because there’s nothing you can do for your patient, and you can’t tell them that it’s going to be 
okay.  So there’s a lot of situations like that, that I - I wasn’t out of my depth, because you kind 
of can feel yourself rise to the occasion when these things happen because you don’t have a 
choice, but there was a lot of times where you just struggled with it.  You compartmentalize, but 
you struggle with this level of intensity, especially at such a young age.  doubly more so for the 
guys that came in with, like, combat trauma.  Those guys were - those guys are real, real tough, 
because they just - they really - they had a really hard time handling the - combat guys, or I did. 
 
HS: When you were interacting with patients, was their most common diagnosis or affectation 
that you would need to assist them with? 
 
[29:40] CC: Yeah.  So, here’s the thing about the military.  About one percent of Americans - is 
it one percent?  I want to - I’ll just air on the side of caution and say that less than 10 percent are 
even eligible for service.  Of those eligible, very, very few enlist, and the medical process is very 
rigorous.  So the people with some of these more - these heavier diagnosis do not get in, and they 
don’t make the cut.  So, maybe I had one patient in my entire career with borderline personality 
disorder, a couple other more serious diagnosis, maybe one or two schizophrenic patients.  The 
most common thing we got was adjustment disorder, which, adjustment disorder is essentially 
like saying, yeah, that guy’s - the Army sucks, and he’s mad because he hasn’t seen his wife.  He 
doesn’t get to go home until eight o’clock at night, every night, and then sometimes he has to 
come in and work weekends.  So that led to a lot of things like, you know, that level of stress.  
That level of stress kind of leads into other issues.  So, marital issues were really big, which - 
divorce, drinking, drug use.  On top of that, polysubstance abuse wasn’t uncommon.  A lot of 
kids doing stupid things.  They’re like, I can’t handle this anymore, and they’re like, I’m going to 
call my dad.  It’s like, no, your dad doesn’t care, this is the military.  A lot of, really - a lot of 
people adjusting to the stress of the military.  And then, there’s the the combat guys.  Do you 
mind if I get into this a bit?  Right.  Okay.  Cool. 
 
HS: Please do.

[32:04] CC: Yeah.  Of course.  The combat guys were really my favorite and my least favorite 
patients, because the combat guys, they had legitimate stuff going on.  They had some really 
hard stuff, but at the same time they had a really good chance of recovery if we could get them to 
come in, because we could get them involved in the process.  But the issue is with that, is that, a 
lot of these guys, they think of behavioral health and mental health is seeking help as a 
weakness, especially - I came in in 2012, and a lot of these guys were part of the surge, or the 
initial invasion.  So they were, like, these hardcore pipe hitters, like, really hardcore guys that 
came in and saw some really rough stuff.  And so, getting them into therapy - oftentimes, they 
would wait until the end of their - right where they were - up until retirement, which is about 
three years - 17 years in, is when people would generally start to seek treatment for combat 
trauma, PTSD if you want to call it - it’s PTSD, but.  That’s when they would seek treatment.  
But a lot of the times, by the time they really got in to see us, it would be bad.  Just to give you a 
few instances, I had one patient who was a gunner - he was a door gunner.  I want to believe it 
was maybe - I don’t think they had door gunners on UH-60s, I can’t remember.  It might have 
been a UH-60.  But anyways, this guy was really messed up.  He’d been on a lot of combat 
missions, and he had this one really bad combat mission where he had some guys that were down 
on the ground, and these guys were getting lit up because it was an ambush and he was calling up 
to command, and command’s like, no, we can’t let you engage.  So, you have this grown man 
that’s in a helicopter and he’s telling me about how he’s in this helicopter, and he’s looking 
down at his boys on the ground and they’re dying.  He’s seeing them get shot, and he’s seeing 
them get messed up, and he just - this level of helplessness and survivor’s guilt is what a lot of 
them have.  Yeah.  A lot of guys like that.  I had another guy who - he kept on coming in, we’d 
see him once a week, and he was a - okay.  Before I say this, I feel like, for the sake of posterity, 
it’s important to note that a lot of times people who work in mental health, we develop these very 
hard, rough shells and we say things that can seem garish and brash, but it’s only - it’s self-
preservation through disassociation.  So it’s not meant to be tough or heartless, it’s just, kind of, 
one of those things that you develop.  Anyways, we had this one guy who kept on coming in, he 
had pretty bad PTSD and really bad suicidal ideations.  Suicidal ideations means thoughts of 
self-harm, wanting to take their own life, right?  This patient came in one time, and I was - as he 
was leaving, I was talking to my doctor who I worked under - under her license.  I was like, 
“Doc.  We know if he leaves the Army, there’s a really good chance he’s going to kill himself.”  
And she was like, “I know.”  She looked at me, and I was like - she looked at me and she said, “I 
know.”  So, a lot of stuff like that.  Those are my favorites but also my least favorite, because a 
lot of them you can save, but they - I think I related to that the most because - not enjoy it 
because enjoy is the wrong word, and relish is the wrong word as well.  I would say I appreciated 
those cases the most, because they signed up to do something knowing the consequences and, to 
no fault of their own, suffered an immense amount of trauma.  We had the beautiful - the dark 
responsibility of trying to help these men and women out of these holes that they, kind of, found 
themselves into, that someone dug for them and put them in.  That was really tough, but it was 
very rewarding.  I still have a couple thank you notes from a few of my patients that I worked 
with, and that’s also great.  There’s some great success stories.  One final thing I’ll tell you 
before we can move on, I don’t want to get into this too much or talk about it too much.  A

success story for one of my patients.  I had this one patient who came in - the guy came in 
because he had PTSD.  This young man - I say young man, he was 26 but he was a young man.  
He was married, had two daughters, and he was from Chicago.  He was coming in for trauma.  
And I was like, okay, you need to do the assessment on him, and and just talking to him.  Turns 
out, his trauma wasn’t from - it wasn’t from the Army.  His trauma was because he was from 
Southside Chicago and he grew up in a really rough neighborhood.  This guy had been stabbed 
when he was, like, 22.  Luckily, never been arrested.  One of his cousins had been killed.  He 
was talking to me about how he had a daughter at the time when he lived in Chicago, and he 
would tell me, like, yeah, I have to tell my daughter that - I had to tell my daughter that gunshots 
were fireworks because I didn’t want her to be scared.  He was like, yeah, you know, just don’t 
go outside.  Those are fireworks, let’s stay inside.  But this young man had joined the Army to 
get himself out of that lifestyle, and he was lucky enough to be in a position to where he could 
get treatment for this level of trauma, and he had done something for himself to get his family 
out of this really, really bad situation.  They lived in a beautiful home in El Paso, and they were 
doing great.  And while the man had a - he had some level of trauma, I held an immense amount 
of respect for him because that’s a small price to pay for him to be able to help his family and do 
something selfless for his family.  So there were good and bad things about it, but it’s just a draw 
of the cards, usually, yeah. 
 
[39:51] HS: Thank you for sharing all of those stories about your time - the parts you appreciated 
the most but are probably parts that you hold dear to your heart.  When you think about how - 
you said earlier that you had to rise to the occasion, that you had no choice but you would rise to 
situations that may stretch you as a behavioral health technician.  So, now that you’re a couple 
years out, do you carry any of these experiences with you and how did they affect you mentally 
at the time? 
 
CC: All the time.  Yeah.  All the time.  Yeah.  Like I told you before we started, I probably saw - 
I saw a bit over - I worked with about over 5,000 patients over seven years.  Worked with, 
interacted with, some more intensively than others, but there are things that stick with you.  
There are patients that I think about once a week.  Door gunner guy, he’s one of the guys I think 
about once a week.  It’s a lot.  I think there’s only so much human suffering that a person should 
have to witness and experience.  A lot of these providers that I’ve worked with, they get burnt 
out and they become very callous and cold.  It’s kind of one of the reasons why I wanted to leave 
the field.  Near the end of my career, I had become detached from how human - a lot of these 
experiences were, and I had started to become almost cold and callous.  Now I’m out of it, I 
think about a lot of these patients a lot.  And I’m not too proud to say I’ve cried a few times 
thinking about some of the worst, most unsalvageable patients I’ve had, because you can’t fix 
everyone.  It may be an unpopular opinion, but you do this - you do it long enough, and you can 
look sometimes - a licensed psychologist is never going to say this, but everyone deserves 
treatment.  Everyone deserves to be able to be treated and get the most help.  But there would be 
times where I would look at a patient, and they would come in month, after month, after month, 
after month, and they - we’d be treating them for, like, two years.  It just becomes so immensely

2020012 
 
sad because, some of these patients, you just can’t - you want to help them and you want to 
believe that you can help them, but it just - maybe they could on a long enough timeline but, at a 
certain point time, it becomes immensely depressing to see this, and see - not just that, but the 
immense amount of sadness these battle-hardened Army guys, these soldiers - which is what 
they are - grown man crying.  It’s so jarring, I think, that it’s something that is, kind of, carried 
with me.  Yeah.  I witnessed a woman come in who had lost her husband, a 43 year old woman, 
she had lost her husband, and telling me that she didn’t care to go home and see her kids because 
she was so depressed.  Stuff like that, that I think that I kind of think about now, because it’s so 
tough.  And a lot of these guys, I would get them - I say guys, but I mean men and women.  A lot 
of times we would get them immediately after these things happen, so you’re getting, just, this 
most raw experience.  Yeah, it definitely affected me a bit.  I think it’s gotten a little bit worse as 
I’ve gotten more detached from it and I’m getting a bit more of my emotional connectivity back.  
So yeah, I’ve carried some of it with me, but I don’t want that to make it seem I, myself, have 
PTSD or anything that, because that’s not true at all.  I didn’t - I never did anything crazy or 
heroic.  I literally just went in and worked with patients, and I - I’m man enough to admit that 
some of these patients, I kind of have carried with me and it makes me sad sometimes, so. 
 
[45:48] HS: Thank you for sharing that - 
 
CC: Yeah, of course. 
 
HS: - honest insight about yourself.  When you say that patients are admitted right after they 
have a traumatic event, how do patients come to you?  Is it an elective process, are they referred 
to you? 
 
CC: Well - okay.  So, they’re not admitted.  I worked in an outpatient clinic, so every patient that 
came to see, me most of the time they were voluntary.  A command team can put in a mandatory 
referral to the way - they have to come see us, but I would see the patient first because I would 
screen them.  So, they didn’t come in right after traumatic events - they did if they voluntarily 
wanted to do it, like that young man whose girlfriend had passed away or that woman who had 
lost her husband.  That, it was all - most time it was volunteer.  I’d say, like, 97 percent of the 
time, it was voluntary.  So, what they would do is, since it’s an outpatient clinic, is these patients 
would come in, fill out a little bit about what was going on with them, and then I would take it.  
I’d look at their medical record, and I’ll just be like, okay.  Do they have a history of anything 
going on?  What’s going on with this patient?  Do they have any history of substance abuse?  
Okay.  Because it kind of gives me an indication as to what is going on with this patient.  Maybe 
this is just a - they’re substance abuse has gotten worse or maybe their depression has come 
back.  The problem is that people, much like the doctor’s office, they don’t - if it’s something 
that they’re uncomfortable with, which, most of behavioral health is stigmatized at this point in 
time - at the time of when I was in the service, and I assume a little bit at the time this recording - 
was stigmatized.  So what they would do is - this is why it became so jarring - they would write 
things like - I’d be like, “What are you here for today?”  “Depression.”  I’d be like, “Oh, okay.

14                                                                                                    
2020012 
 
So, he’s got a little bit of depression.”  And they’d come and sit in the chair across from me, and 
they’d be like, “Yeah, so my sister died this morning.”  I’d be like, “Oh.”  I mean, I wouldn’t say 
it like that, but mentally it’s very jarring because usually people hold it in until they actually get 
into the office.  But it was always an elective process.  It was never - well, I don’t say never 
because it was occasionally a non-elective process, but most the time it was elective.  These 
patients came in on their own volition. 
 
HS: When you were treating patients, you said that you were with a patient population that was 
relatively stagnant.  People would come and go, but you knew the people that you were treating.  
What was the camaraderie like amongst your fellow behavioral health techs and other people 
working in the healthcare system with you, and what was that like treating this patient population 
that you got to get to know? 
 
[49:06] CC: So, I should put it like this.  I worked in an embedded behavioral health team.  My 
team consisted of four people.  We had some civilian healthcare workers, behavioral health 
technicians that helped us out, but it was a junior psych tech, a senior psych tech who was 
usually a noncommissioned officer, a psychologist, and a licensed clinical social worker.  Those 
four people created a team.  This is for a patient population size of 4,000.  So that’s what we had 
to work with.  And we were not popular, because you’ve got to think, I worked in an embedded 
behavioral health clinic, but my actual unit that I was assigned to, which was within the brigade, 
was a BSB, Brigade Support Battalion.  So we worked with a lot of medics, and we had a lot of 
medics that were my peers and comrades, and I got to know.  I did well with them, but to a lot of 
the combat guys, mechanics and what have you, we were, kind of, the - we were the - I don’t 
know, we were the shrinks.  We were the guys who you didn’t want to talk to because they could 
get - you could get in trouble, because, again, there was a huge stigma against behavioral health.  
So, breaking through to these guys, I was never too - I didn’t try to be too professional.  I tried to 
just be one of the guys, so to speak.  I’m trying not to use too much slang because I don’t want 
this to be a non-translate.  But yes, so I tried to just be a person and usually that worked because 
I would just come up and I would usually talk to some of the guys.  I wouldn’t bring behavioral 
health up and all, because that’s not what they wanted to hear.  So I would just talk to them, 
smoke a cigarette with them, do my thing, talk to them a little bit, and maybe down the line one 
would reach out to me and say something, that happened a few times.  A few guys - there were a 
few times guys came to my barracks room door - which, a barracks is just kind of like a college 
dorm, if you didn’t know.  He would come to my barracks - there was a few times where guys 
came to my barracks room at, like, midnight and was like, “Hey, can I talk to you?”  I would be 
like, “All right, sure.  Why not.  Of course.”  If you had my job, you didn’t say no to that.  You’d 
be like, “Okay.  For sure.”  And a couple late nights in the ER, making sure guys didn’t end up 
hurting themselves.  So I’d say my tactic was as successful as it could be, but I wasn’t exactly 
best friends with a lot of people who were wary of behavioral health. 
 
HS: With your small team serving such a large population, how did you guys support and 
communicate with one another?

CC: Well, we had to be on good terms.  Working in such an intimate environment in such an 
intimate field, a lot of these people that I worked with were very emotionally intelligent.  So, we 
just talked to each other about what was going on.  We were very open with each other.  If we 
were having things going on, we’d talk to each other normally.  A lot of the doctors that I 
worked with, they were officers and I was enlisted, and they’d be like, “Just call me by my first 
name.”  And I’m like, “All right,” Captain so-and-so, I can’t do that.  But we did have a very 
good, close working environment, or at least all the best teams did.  So, yeah, it was good.  We 
communicated very well.  I was very - I was always very happy with our team dynamic.  Yeah. 
 
HS: So, you - correct me if I’m wrong - said you were serving in the Army for seven years, 
correct? 
 
CC: Seven years, four months. 
 
HS: Did you commit to that long of a time period, or did you end up extending your contract? 
 
CC: I extended my contracts twice, because I’m dumb.  There was no reason for me to do that.  
It was just that, at the end of my first - when I was getting near the end of my first four years - at 
three years, I was like, yeah, I’m loving this.  I was still in that really motivated mode of thinking 
education - what had occurred to me - I was like all right, this is my career, this is what I’m 
doing.  So I ended up re-enlisting twice.  The second time, I was really just trying to get to do 
something cool.  I really wanted to deploy, because I never deployed.  I worked entirely stateside 
all my career, which is - it’s fine for my MOS, it’s just a pride thing.  But yeah, the second time, 
I just wanted to deploy, so I re-enlisted for an airborne brigade and that was pretty cool, 82nd 
Airborne Division to be exact, but I didn’t commit to that long of a time initially.  I should have 
gotten out in my first four years and just went to college, but c’est la vie. 
 
[55:20] HS: So, when you were in the Army, how many years were you a Behavioral Health 
Technician? 
 
CC: All of them. 
 
HS: Even when you were in the Airborne Division at the end? 
 
CC: Yeah.  I was a - jumping out of planes in the P.M. and seeing patients in the A.M. 
 
HS: Okay.  Thank you for clarifying. 
 
CC: Yeah.

HS: When you left after finishing your term of contract, why did you know that it was time to 
leave then? 
 
CC: It becomes so stagnant, that I was having a lot of issues.  I was having issues with my 
mental health at the time.  I just was - I felt so stagnant.  I just couldn’t - I had to get out.  Sorry, 
what was the second half of that question? 
 
HS: How did you know it was time to get out?  That was the whole question. 
 
CC: Yeah.  And the - I would give you a why to that.  I knew, because my mental health was 
starting to deteriorate, I was just really struggling with realizing the fact that I was nearing my 
late 20s.  I had no degree.  I think I had an associates at the time.  I had no degree and I knew that 
I had no future in the Army.  So I was kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I knew 
that I wanted to do other things, and there was more for me.  I also saw - this isn’t to disparage 
these veterans who did 20, 30 years, but a lot of the guys that I saw who were into their - closing 
in on 20 years.  A lot of times, I saw that they had just lost their personality into the military.  
They were so very about that lifestyle that it had crept into the various other aspects of what they 
liked, their mannerisms became very militaristic.  I kind of - I just thought to myself, I’m like, 
you’re Cody, I want to be Cody.  I want to make sure that I preserve who Cody is and what I’m 
about, as opposed to adopting this as my person.  I just - I didn’t want that to be me.  I didn’t 
want to be Sergeant Clark for the rest of my life, I wanted to be Cody Clark. 
 
HS: I have a couple of larger thematic wrap-up questions that will relate to your time as a 
Behavioral Health Tech but also relate to our current time, mainly COVID-19.  So, the first 
question that I have is, from your time working as a Behavioral Health Tech in the Army, how 
has that affected your experience with the pandemic or your interpretation of how the American 
healthcare system has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic? 
 
[58:33] CC: All right.  So, let’s break that down into two parts here.  I understand people a lot 
more now.  I understand people, I pick up on a lot of cues that people exhibit.  And then, that’s 
on - that translates to me also understanding a little bit more about myself and how I respond to 
things.  So, under stress, I’ve gotten a lot better about having - knowing what’s best for me and 
what I need to do.  Because the pandemic was very tough on a lot of people, a lot of people have 
been going through depression and anxiety and, as you probably know, sexual assault has gone 
up, suicidal ideations have gone up, depression has gone up, substance abuse has increased over 
the pandemic.  So, while I am lucky enough to not have experienced those things, I do attribute it 
to knowing - having those understandings of what good coping mechanisms are for myself in 
knowing that, like, okay, you can’t go to the gym, go over the park, work out there.  Don’t drink 
too much, you know what happens.  You can’t be drinking too much, it’s bad, it’s bad for 
depression, anxiety, what have you, and that’s an internal question about myself.  Societally, I 
have a great amount of concern about how the pandemic has affected the general American 
populace.  That’s really concerning to me, because I know it’s had immense effects and I feel

bad for a lot of these individuals who - I live in New York right now.  I live in New York City.  
Especially a lot of these individuals who are working out of these small, small studio apartments 
and for a long time they weren’t able to leave their houses.  That’s terrifying and my heart really 
bleeds for them, because I know New York is a very - it’s a very be outside doing things city.  
My folks back home in Texas, they were fine.  They have a farm, they were fine.  My mom 
would go out, and have coffee on the porch and look at the cows walk around.  They were fine, 
but it’s these people in these cities that have probably been suffering the most, and I would - I’m 
very interested in looking at the data that is going to result from this.  Now, as far as from a 
healthcare perspective, looking from a healthcare perspective as to how the healthcare industry 
has managed this.  Is that a good enough way to frame this question?  Okay. 
 
HS: That’s good. 
 
CC: So, I actually interned at Memorial Sloan Kettering during summer of 2020, right, so I got to 
be - I really got to be in the heart of it.  Some of these organizations have done an exceptional job 
of - what’s the phrase?  I can’t remember what the phrase is now.  It’s essentially, COVID-19 
was a phenomenally difficult time for healthcare organizations continuing to operate, especially 
for a healthcare organization Memorial Sloan Kettering where you have cancer patients, because 
cancer does not stop for a pandemic, it does not, you still have these very high risk patients.  
Places like Memorial Sloan Kettering did an exceptional job of dealing with what I can only - I 
guess would you call it colloquially referred to as a trash fire.  It was difficult to deal with, but 
the turnover in the way that people adapted to treating their patients in the COVID era was very 
impressive.  I think it’s a testament to human ingenuity and motivation.  But, at the same time, 
not to name names, but on the federal level, I was less than impressed with how it was handled.  
That was very upsetting.  It’s really upsetting to see - it’s, like, 50,000 Americans dead, and then 
you have people in places of immense power and influence saying, oh, it’s a hoax, it’s not real, 
when I’m trying to be humanistic about this, right?  It’s more than was necessary.  And, of 
course, we knew going into it that Americans were going to die, which is unfortunate and may 
seem callous to say, but - COVID-19, we lost more people than almost double what America lost 
in World War II.  We hold World War II in such high regard, yet we roll over the fact that 
500,000 Americans died during COVID-19.  I know of a 32 year old man that died from 
COVID.  Then, you have individuals saying oh, it’s just - it’s not that big of a deal, you’re not - 
and it’s - of course I’m not trying to be dramatic about it, but it’s still - that was upsetting.  But I 
give nothing but the utmost praise for our healthcare workers that came in and did their jobs, 
because when you work in healthcare, it’s not about politics, it’s not.  You come in, you do your 
job because it’s about the patient and it’s not about yourself.  You get your vaccine, you come in, 
do your thing, treat your patients, and you go home.  You know the risks, because we work in 
healthcare, and that’s what we do.  So yeah, that’s kind of what I would - I’ll get off my soapbox 
now.

[1:05:56] HS: So, you’ve spoken a lot about your experiences through the Army and I’m 
wondering who’s mentored you or guided you on this path, and what were those experiences 
like? 
 
CC: Yeah.  Certainly.  I’ve had - I don’t know.  See, I think about this a lot because as you go 
through your life, you think about who’s helped mold you into who you are and the people that 
have helped influence you.  I can think of three people in my life that have really been influential 
to me.  There would be my dad, his name is Russell Shaw.  Really, as I spoke earlier, very blue 
collar man but immensely hard working, impressively so, and also one of the kindest people I’ve 
ever met, the type of person to treat - everyone he has ever met, he’s treated like he’s known 
them for years.  I think that’s been instrumental into who I am, because now I try to emulate that.  
I fail often, I do, but I try.  I think that’s phenomenally important.  He taught me just how 
important it is to be kind to others.  There’s Chris Burns, which is a man that kind of helped 
influence me when I was a bit of a troubled teenager, taught me how to work with my hands, do 
a lot of things.  He was really, really influential because he was just so open-minded to everyone 
that he experienced, and he really taught me the value of how to work with your hands.  The man 
taught me how to do construction, he taught me how to do roofing, he taught me how to build 
barb wire fences.  And then, when it was time to move on, he was nothing but supportive of me 
doing things better for myself.  He pushed me to want to do other things.  That’s amazing, I 
think, that a lot of times we meet people who just want to hold us back because of their own 
insecurities, and then you have these people like Chris Burns, who’s a very blue collar guy, and 
he’s like, “No, no, no.  I’m blue collar, it doesn’t mean you have to be,” and I have an immense 
amount of respect for that.  And then, there’s JoAnn Talib (ph), Captain - I think she’s a Major - 
she might be Lieutenant Colonel now, but when I worked under her, she was Captain Talib.  She 
was a licensed clinical social worker.  And legitimately, without a doubt, one of the best leaders 
I’ve ever had in my life.  I will never forget this time that she told me, she was like, “Clark, this 
is how I think.  I’m going to sit here at my desk, and I’m going to work my ass off, but at five 
o’clock I’m going to go home and see my babies.”  Because she had an immense amount of 
respect for her job and her career, and giving all that she could, but she maintained this beautiful 
line of where her career ended and her family began, and she treated me with the same regard.  I 
remember, one time I was going through a hard time - this is a captain that I worked under.  She 
was like, “Do you need to borrow some money?”  And I was like, “No.  Ma’am” - I was like, 
“Ma’am, no.  No.  Of course not.  No, I’m fine.”  And she was like, “Okay.  I’m just checking on 
you.”  And she was just such a phenomenal leader because of that immense emotional 
intelligence, I believe - it’s important to call - because that immense emotional intelligence, it 
made me want to be a better soldier and work harder, and without ever her being domineering or 
demeaning towards me.  So yeah, those are the three people that I think have kind of helped me 
be a better person throughout my life - or mentor me, I should say. 
 
[1:10:47] HS: Thank you for sharing your mentor experiences as you progresses through your 
personal life and through your career.  The last question I have for you today, Cody, is, what is

your final thoughts or anything that you would to share that you think would be a theme or a 
standout moment from your career that you’d like to share? 
 
CC: I’d say that you should never - if you’re angry, use your anger - bad things happen to 
everyone.  No one in life is dealt a perfect hand.  Just because one person struggles more than 
another, it doesn’t make the second person’s struggle any less valid, because what seems 
immense to me may not seem immense to you.  With that same thought, I think it’s important to 
realize and never forget that discomfort is good, it’s good for the human condition.  They say 
that when people retire, that’s when their health starts to go downhill because they become too 
comfortable.  I would say that comfort is the brother of complacency, and complacency is 
dangerous to one’s ambitions and ideas of success and motivations.  It can destroy those things 
but, at the same time, that only depends on what your idea of success is.  So, I don’t know, I feel 
like I’ve had a weird life, but at this the time of this recording I’m only 28.  So those are the very 
modest takeaways that I can give at the relatively young age of 28.  So, I don’t - maybe in 10 
years I’ll think of that as an absurdly naïve thing to say, but at this point in time it seems to be 
how I feel.  So I think that’s all I have for you.   
 
HS: Thank you for sharing what’s true to you right now in this moment and participating in this 
oral history project.
