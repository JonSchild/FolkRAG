[0:00] AG: Hi Fayrene . Thank you so much for participating in these Library of Congress oral histories. 
I'm gonna turn it over to Hannah to ask you the first questions. 
FT: Okay. 
HS: Hi Fayrene . I would like to open this interview by asking you to introduce yourself. 
FT: Good morning. My name is Fayrene  Jackson Tolbert. 
HS: Can we start by talking about your family background and your education history? 
FT: Okay. I was born in Terrell, Texas, and that was on 
 1944. My mom, when I was 
conceived, was in college, and so she dropped out of college, she gave birth to me, and she went back to 
school, and I was raised by my grandparents. I finished high school in Terrell in 1962. Actually, I didn't 
actually graduate with my class because I got married at the end of my junior year in high school. So, 
later on, after my last child was born, which I have five children, I went and got my GED. 
[unintelligible], they'll be in school, and then the rest is history as to getting into college. 
AG: Could I ask you, Fayrene , to explain what LVN is? 
FT: Okay. LVN in Texas is a licensed vocational nurse. Your training, and it's basically bedside nursing. 
It's a couple of steps up from a nursing assistant, but it's not a registered nurse status. I worked for the 
VA for 13 years as a LVN before I finished college as an RN, from Dallas Baptist University. 
HS: Fayrene , you mentioned a little bit about your parents' educational background. Can you speak a 
little bit more to that? 
FT: Okay. I'm pretty fortunate because my grandparents, my mom's mom and dad, her grandfather was a 
educator back in the 1800s. He went through different little counties in Texas where my grandmother 
and my granddad was born and raised, as well as my mother. So, I have a educational background from 
way back. My people thought it was important to be educated. I got married at the end of my junior year 
in high school, and so to further my education, in 1966, after my last child was a year old, I went and got 
my GED. That's a graduate equivalent degree or diploma, which is equal to a high school graduation, so 
that allowed me to further my education. 
HS: And you spoke a little bit about your mother's educational background. Where did she go to school, 
and what did she do after she went to school? 
FT: Okay. My mom was valedictorian in her high school class, and she graduated at the top 10. She 
went to a college in Tyler, Texas, and she was studying elementary education. That was her goal was to 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
2020012

be a school teacher. But things changed, and she didn't do that. She actually came out of school before 
she graduated. She spent a lot of her time as a chef, and that's basically what she did until she retired. 
  
HS: Do you know of anything that your father did? 
  
FT: My father was in the military, and once he left military, he went to tailoring school. He learned how 
to sew and make suits. Now, that wasn't what he did with his life. He actually went to work for a truck 
company, and so he did that for about 35 years. 
  
HS: And regarding your father's education, what was his highest level of education? 
  
FT: I'm not really quite sure. I know that he did not finish high school 'cause at that time, eighth grade 
was considered enough schooling for most people back there in those days, so he did not finish high 
school, but he did do well in his lifetime. 
  
HS: To clarify, when you say “back in those days”, what age were your parents going to school and 
what year? 
  
FT: Okay. My mom was born in 1921, so my mother started school in 1927, and she graduated high 
school in 1942. My dad was about four years older than my mom. Like I said, I'm not sure of that, but 
I'm quite sure that he did not graduate from high school. I have a sibling. I have one sister, and she's a 
year and nine months younger than me. She is a retired school teacher, and she also has a Master's in 
Library Science. We didn't do bad. 
  
HS: Is there anything else that you think is important to your later career as a nurse that may have 
happened in your early life? 
  
[6:03] FT: Oh, I'm glad you asked. Yes. I have known that I wanted to be a nurse since I was eight years 
old. Basically, when I was growing up, I had the opportunity to actually save a person's life when I was 
12. My grandparents now owned a restaurant, a cafe, and this person had a seizure, and was almost 
aspirating. For some reason I just knew to turn him over on his side so he wouldn't aspirate. I didn't 
know what that word was then. Later on, he told me, 'cause he could hear us but we didn't know that he 
could. He told me, "Thank you. You saved my life, because if you had not turned me over, I probably 
would have died of choking on my vomit." Then, by the time I was 14 until I was age 17, I actually 
helped a cousin deliver 3 of her babies. I was [laughs] not knowing that, but that's what I was. That's 
what I did. I delivered three babies from my cousin from 1958 until 1962. I pretty well have always 
known that I want to be a nurse. Just, I guess, intuition, or whatever you want to call it. It was just 
always there. I really enjoyed being a nurse. I still do. I don't do a lot of nursing, but I enjoy the idea that 
I was a nurse, is a nurse, 'cause I keep my license up as well. A little bit more education background: 
While I was in Dallas Baptist, I did a double major, so I have a major in nursing as well as a major in 
psychology.

AG: Fayrene , can you talk a little bit about the process of becoming credentialed as an LVN first and 
then as a registered nurse? 
  
FT: Okay. The requirements for being an LVN is that you-- it's a 12-month program, and you must 
attend the 12 months and as you're trained, they take you to different hospitals to give you educational 
background with patients. Then once that program is over, you have to go and take a test. You have to 
take a state board. Most states have a board for their LVNs or Practical Nursing, and then their RN 
board. Both boards are actually run by the same person. After a year, when I was complete with the 
LVN training, I went to Austin, Texas and I took the LVN state board. I started the school in '66 of June, 
and I graduated LVN in '67 of June, and I went to boards in July. I became an LVN, and I kept that 
status until 1980. 
  
AG: Was the position with the VA the first job that you had as an LVN? 
  
FT: Yes. All of my career with my nursing was with the VA. I started at the VA in 1967 as an LVN, and 
I retired from the VA in 1999 as a registered nurse. 
  
HS: What made working at the VA appealing to you Fayrene ? 
  
[10:14] FT: Well, when I was as an LVN, we were told-- and when I said "we", I'm talkin' 'bout the 
whole group that I was with, was about 12 of us. We were told that if we stayed at the hospital where we 
were, where we did training, they would give us certain benefits and perks, so I stayed where I was 
doing my LVN training. But when it actually came time for some of these things to be given that they 
offered us, they didn't do that. I lived about less than a mile away from the VA hospital. I just thought, "I 
can't do this. I'm not gonna start off with somebody that's not gonna actually do what they say.” So, I 
went to the VA on my day off, and I applied for a position at the VA. I actually went there, and the 
Chief Nurse that would interview people were actually getting ready to go home, but since I was there, 
they let me go speak to those two ladies. I spoke to those two ladies, and before I left, I was hired. I went 
back to my regular hospital 'cause I had to give her two weeks' notice. And I had told the VA that I 
wouldn't be able to come to them until about four weeks, but they said fine. Eventually, I actually gave 
the two weeks' notice at the hospital I was at and then went on my little two-day vacation and came back 
and gave them two weeks' notice. The VA called and said, "Can you come sooner?" and I thought, "I 
sure can.” So, I rescinded one week at the other hospital, and then the rest was history with the VA. 
  
AG: Fayrene , what was that first job like as a practical nurse at the VA? Can you remember what your 
experiences were like getting up and running? 
  
FT: Yes. When I went to the VA, I went to the VA, 
 1967, and I started on a med surg 
ward. It was really a good experience, because my intent always was to be at the highest level of the 
nursing that I could get. I went in with all those skills that I was taught as a child, how to be a leader. I 
worked that med surg ward for about two years. Then, the VA was getting ready to open up a coronary 
care unit for the first time, so after my two years on the med surg floor, I was chosen to go into the 
coronary care unit. I had a great person as my head nurse my first two years, and she was very

2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
2020012

instrumental in me learning the skills and definitely being a leader. She would give me the responsibility 
to be the team lead over the nursing assistants that I was working with during that day. 
  
AG: And how did you decide to go back to pursue the RN? Had that been something you were working 
toward the whole time? 
  
FT: Well, it was always my intent to be an RN, 'cause when I was growing up, I knew nothing about 
LVN, even though I know now it was there, but that was never my goal. I was always focused on being 
an RN. The whole time that I was at the VA, I just kept doing those things that I needed to do. Of 
course, I'm raising a family too and I'm married at that time, and I'm raising a family. I started working 
on my degree, working on my ability to go back to school, in 1969. I started part-time at a junior 
college. I got the courses that I needed to take out of the way. That took me seven years, 'cause I was 
working and I was going to school part-time and was raising my five babies. I went to this junior college 
for seven years, then in 1975, I enrolled full-time into the university for the RN program. I had to leave 
the VA because they didn't have a position for me. I left the VA, and I was gone from the VA for about 
a year, about a year and a half, actually. I worked then as part-time for nursing registries. Then in 1977, I 
was being divorced, and I needed more money than I was getting working part-time like I was, so I went 
back to the VA in 1977. I did not finish nursing school, RN school, until 1979. But at that time, the VA 
allowed me, when I came back, to work evenings. I was able to go to school during the daytime, and so I 
finished the nursing program at Dallas Baptist in 1979, December 1979. 
  
AG: It sounds like those were probably very busy years for you caring for your five children and 
working and attending school. 
  
[16:23] FT: It was a very busy year, it really was. I can remember times when I would leave school, get 
out of school, because once you're into the nursing program, you spend most of your time now in the 
hospital, so you're not in the classroom setting. So, that meant that I had to be up and be at the hospital 
every morning at 6:45, get the kids situated, so they would get up maybe before I left and sometime not. 
It was kind of rough, but it was something that I had determined that that's what I was going to do. A lot 
of distractions came but I just kept at it. It was a slow go, but it worked for me. 
  
AG: What do you think was behind your, you know, drive to become a nurse, even with all of the other 
demands on your time? 
  
FT: Well, I think mainly my first drive was that I knew that when I was eight that I wanted to be a nurse. 
I couldn't think of anything else that I wanted to do. I got married at the end of my junior year in high 
school. My husband at that time really didn't want me to work, but I felt like we couldn't really 
adequately take care of our kids like they should be without a extra income. I didn't know anything else 
that I wanted to be except for nurse. I decided I was gonna go to an employment office. During that 
time, they did what they call an aptitude test. They kind of looked at you and tried to determine what 
area of work you would be best in. At that time, there was a new company that had come to the Dallas 
area, and I thought, "Well, maybe I could go work there.” When I did the test and the test was 
completed, thank the Lord, they said to me, "All that you did, you did it right, but you wasn't fast

2020012

enough. You were little bit slow, so you can't go work on a line putting things together. You would be 
better off as a nurse." I thought, "Wow! That is exactly what I wanted to do." They were the one that 
told me where to go to go to the LVN school. So, the first nursing school I went to, I was directed by an 
employment office. I went to that place and applied for their LVN program. As I talk about and 
remember what happened, when I went to apply for the LVN school program, I was sick. I had the flu. I 
didn't know that I had the flu. I had the flu, and I was sick. But I went anyway, because they said, "You 
need to come 'cause this is a testing day." I went there, I did the test, and I heard the same thing I heard 
at the employment office: "You got 'em all right, but you didn't get enough of them.” Then, the lady 
looked at me and she said, "Sweetie, are you sick? You don't look like you feel good." I said, "No, 
ma'am, I don't-- I feel real bad." And she looked at me and she touched my head. She said, "Oh, you're 
burnin' it up". She said, "Go home, take some medicine, get well. We don't start school for two weeks, 
and I want you to come back in a week and retake this test.". I said, "Okay." I got well, I went back, I 
took the test, and I got into the LVN school. 
  
HS: Fayrene , you mentioned in college you double majored, and I'm wondering about your choice to 
double major. Why did you choose those two subjects? 
  
[20:36] FT: Well, I don't know. I kind of always been a person that would listen to other people 
problems. I had a grandfather. My grandfather raised me. I guess [unintelligible] I'm the oldest 
grandchild on that side, on my mom's side, and I'm the second grandchild on my dad's side and the first 
girl. That meant I got a lot of attention growing up. My grandfather was the person that always would 
help me figure out what I needed to do or should do. He never just told me, "Well, this is what you 
would do." He would walk me through situations. He would ask me questions. By the time we got 
through talking, I had figured out what I should do. I think psychology was always a part of my life. 
Then, one reason why I actually went into psychology was because [sighs], and it's kind of hard to talk 
about, but in the nursing program, there was not always equal treatment, according to what you look 
like, or the color of your skin. When I was in school, out of maybe 30 or 40 students being in the school, 
myself and one other lady was the only African American students, or Black students, in the school.  
It was a lot of pressure on us to succeed, or maybe it was a lot of pressure on us to make us not want to 
succeed. I had to work through a lot of prejudices, not from the students I was in class with, but from the 
teachers. They really made it hard for me. They took away some of my credits. I was made to retake one 
class, basically, because that's what they said I should do, not because I didn't make it the first time, but 
just because. But anyway, it was getting difficult, and I felt that I was in the school already, and there 
was no way I was gonna leave that college without a degree. It was gonna be nursing or something. A 
lot of my courses that I had taken for nursing would have, well, it really allowed me to move into any 
other major that I wanted, and psychology was what I chose. While I was still in nursing school, I started 
working on a degree in psychology. That's why I did what I did. I refused to spend all those years 
working toward a degree and come out with nothing. 
  
HS: Thank you for sharing that part of your story, Fayrene . I'm curious as you progressed through your 
education to complete your LVN and eventually your RN, did you experience prejudice in other ways in 
those later programs?

FT: Well, in the psychology group, I did not, because most people that go into psychology go in because 
they have issues themselves that they want to explore and be able to cope with. So, in my psychology 
group, I did not have. Actually, while I was in the program for the psychology part-- You remember I 
told you that I did graduate from the nursing program in December 1979, but at that time, the college 
only had one graduation date, and so that was gonna be in May. So, I actually marched in May of 1980, 
but by that time, state boards, which is what we have to do to get credentialed, was scheduled for 
February of 1980. So, by the time I graduated, by the time I marched, I was already a registered nurse. I 
had gone and passed the boards, the state boards, and had received my license as a registered nurse. So, 
what I did was, while I was still-- Well, I finished the nursing part in '79, and then I had to come back in 
'80 to complete my psychology part. I had really become real tired of going to school, and so I requested 
to just kind of halfway in the middle of the last two parts of my psychology program, to take whatever 
grade that they would give me, but I just kinda needed to get away. I was just being burnt out at this 
time. I had a child graduating from high school, and I just needed to spend more time. The 
[unintelligible] agreed, 'cause I had As in both subjects, so they let me go and gave me those grades. So, 
that's why I worked on that psychology degree, because it was just seeming real tough for me for 
nursing. That worked for me, because out of all my years at the VA, 13 of those years was as a 
psychiatric nurse, and I became certified as a psychiatric nurse in the VA hospital. 
  
HS: After you received your RN certification, how did your role change, and what additional 
responsibilities did you take on? 
  
[26:52] FT: Okay. You know, I had a supervisor that asked me that same thing. She was on this side of 
the nurse's station and I was on the other side, and she said to me, "Okay, now that you're an RN, how 
did your position change?" And I told her that I would take the 5th on that one, but I won't take the 5th 
with you all [chuckles]. Some things changed, but as I said, I was one of those persons that liked to learn 
as much as I could, and leadership and taking charge was always part of me. I learned a lot of the skills 
that I would use as an RN while I was an LVN, 'cause I worked in the coronary care unit and the MICU, 
which meant "medical intensive care unit". I worked in those units, so I learned a lot of things while 
working in those different areas at the VA hospital. Probably the only thing that changed from being an 
LVN to an RN, for me, was the responsibility of being a leader in the area of where I was. Say I worked 
med surg, so now I have to make a few more choices about what the other people under me are able to 
do. I knew what the LVN role was. I knew what a medical assistant role was. I was able to make sure 
that those people were able to do whatever was needed for the patients in the hospital. Of course, I did 
have some other duties. For instance, as an LVN, I couldn't hang IVs. Now I could. As an LVN, I 
couldn't make a choice about what I thought the patient needed, or directed a doctor toward what that 
patient needed at the time. I was able to do that as an RN, but I wasn't able to do that, at least legally, as 
an LVN. Just to add, my responsibility was whatever the role of RN was. That's the only thing that 
changed. 
  
AG: Fayrene , I'm curious when you were working as an LPV in intensive care and coronary care, what 
kind of patients did you typically see, or what kind of conditions did they often present with? 
  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
2020012

FT: Okay. In the CCU, which is Coronary Care Unit, that's a heart unit. I worked with patients that had 
heart attacks. That was what I did from 1969 when I left the med surg ward 'til I left to go to school the 
first time. These were heart patients, patients that had heart attacks, patients that was going to need a 
heart surgery, mainly that patient that had heart attacks, where we treated them so they could get better. 
Some of 'em had to have pacemakers and different things. But that was basically what that was, patients 
that had heart attacks, heart problems. 
  
AG: Is it okay if we move into talking about your most recent roles at the VA in psychiatric nursing? 
And I think the other Hanna's got some questions that she was going to ask about, like, what the day to 
day was like for you in that capacity. 
  
FT: Okay. 
  
AG: Okay. 
  
HG: Hello. So, could you talk a little bit about the most recent job that you had before retirement and 
what the job title was? 
  
[30:56] FT: Okay. The most recent job I had before I retired was in 1989. The VA opened up a homeless 
program, and so I was chosen as the homeless outreach nurse. My job was to go out into the community 
and find veterans, to find the veterans, see what their status was mentally, and provide care, and to get 
the patient to come to the VA hospital for inpatient care. At that time, with my psychiatric certification, I 
was given the challenge of making sure that the veterans outside of the VA hospital that needed care 
could come to the hospital and be treated. The doctor I worked with granted me the ability to write 
admissions. I could go out into the community, see a veteran that need care, I can write admission for 
him to be admitted to the VA hospital. I was a homeless outreach nurse for six years. I did that. 
Eventually, the VA secured a building downtown so we could have a regular place to stay, because 
before that, I would go to the VA with a social worker that I was working with, and we would go out 
into the community. Once we established the Resource Center for the VA, downtown Dallas, then the 
veterans would come there, and then I would admit them to the hospital as they were needed to or I 
would refer them to other shelters that they could have some place to stay that the VA would pay for. 
That's what I did for six years, and that was really rewarding because I met not only men veterans, I met 
a lot of women veteran. That's when I really realized that the mental health problem is really, really, 
really bad. I guess I would say, especially when it's a woman veteran and she's out on the street and she 
has children, and nobody really wants to help her or she won't allow anyone to help her. I did some great 
things. I was able to help some of the people get outside jobs. There became a job opening or a job 
availability at the VA. VA actually did a work-study where they got contracts and they hired veterans to 
work so they could have a place to stay at and food and money. That's what I did from 1990 to 1996. 
Then, in 1996-- One of my goals at the VA was to be a Chief Nurse, and I guess I kept that goal until 
maybe about '85. By that time, all my kids were out of high school, and then I decided, "No, I don't think 
I want to go back to school and get another degree. I'm just kind of tired, so let me just do what I'm 
going to do here, you know, at the VA." I was a homeless outreach nurse from 1990 to 1996. Then, the 
VA opened up some head nurse position training, and so I decided, "Okay, let me do this," 'cause I

2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
2020012 
 
10 
 
would always throw my name in the pot for whatever was coming up, because, you know, if I got it, I 
was gonna do a good job. If I didn't get it, that was gonna be okay. I applied for the head nurse position 
training, and I got the opportunity to go back into on-the-ground, 'cause I'm outside the VA now doing 
my homeless outreach stuff. I went back to inpatient setting, went back into the hospital setting in 1996. 
I was a head nurse, or in administration, from 1996 to 1999 when I retired. 
  
AG: What does the head nurse or Chief Nurse do, Fayrene , that's different from a floor nurse, or like an 
outpatient nurse? 
  
[35:58] FT: Well, the head nurse is really kind of like the supervisor. She or he is the one that makes 
sure that the patients are taken care of in the proper manner, that there's enough staff on each day. She 
makes a schedule out. She gives directions to all of the people, including RNs, that's working with her, 
and sometimes the doctors as well. She's the lead person. She's the one that make up the schedule. She's 
the one that gives the staff the patient that she know that they can take care of. She's the leader. She is 
the go-to person on that particular ward or unit. The Chief Nurse of the VA system, that person is 
housed in Washington, DC, and that is the person that's over all of the nursing staff, the nursing duties, 
and all of the VA hospitals in America. That's her job. 
  
HG: So, were you a head nurse when you were working at the homeless outreach center? 
  
FT: I was the only nurse. I was a homeless outreach nurse from outside the VA hospital, so I was the 
nurse that would make the determination if they needed to be admitted, and if they did, I would do the 
admission note and give it to them and they would take it to the VA hospital. Most of the time, they 
were admitted to the hospital on the basis of what I wrote up and what I saw. 
  
H2: So, what other kind of people did you work with at that center, and, like, what were your relations 
with the other professions? 
  
FT: In the position of homeless nurse, the people that was over this was the social work service. I 
worked with social workers, I worked with benefit officers, I worked with police officers, and I worked 
with the homeless people, I mean, the homeless staff of the city. I worked with a lot of different people. 
I worked with some of the other shelters that was in the area that allow veterans to come in. I saw a lot 
of people. I worked with a lot of different people. It was the social worker staff, it was the staff in the 
shelters, wherever the shelters were, it was the police officers that was there with the shelters, it was the 
other social workers that was there with the shelters, and some other nurses at times and staff. Like at 
the Salvation Army, was one of the big places where we paid to have our veteran stay. 
  
HG: And could you describe a typical patient interaction in that unit? 
  
[39:17] FT: In the homeless shelter, when the patient is inpatient, it's a difference in how you deal with 
them when they're a outpatient. Inpatient was basically pretty set and go because the patient is in the 
hospital, the doctor has seen him, the doctor has written orders that he want the nurse to carry out toward 
that patient. The patient is told what the doctor has ordered for him or her to do. It's pretty stable, and it's

an environment that you can control. When you're in a homeless situation, it's a environment that you 
have to take control of. In the homeless patients or the veterans that were homeless, it's a lot of distrust, 
so the first thing you have to do is try to build a trustworthy relationship with them. That's not always 
the easiest thing to do, but you can work at it, and then, you know, it does work. Most of the people that 
were homeless had mental deficiencies. They had mental illnesses, or they were on substance abuse, 
either alcohol or drugs, sometimes both. The thing there was trying to get them to understand that you 
were willing to help them help themselves to get better, to either get treated for the mental illness. We 
have substance abuse program. A lot of the homeless people have a lot of health issues: diabetes, high 
blood pressure, kidney failure, just a lot of things that happens with normal people. I had the 
responsibility of being a navigator for those people. Most of the time it worked. Sometimes it didn't, but 
we always kept trying. 
  
HG: Did they have a choice whether they were inpatient or outpatient, or was that just up to the nurses 
and doctors? 
  
FT: No, they had a choice. Yeah, they had a choice. If they wanted to go in, they could. If they didn't 
want to go in, they didn't have to. I only wrote admissions to the ones I wanted to go in, because you 
can't force anyone to do anything they don't want to do. So, no. We didn't force 'em. It was the same way 
inpatient. If there was a treatment that was offered to a veteran and that veteran said, "No," then we 
couldn't force that veteran take that treatment, even if it was life-saving. That was pretty much that, what 
we did. We always knew what we could do. We always knew what we couldn't do. In the best interest of 
ourselves and the patient and the veteran, we didn't cross that line. 
  
HG: Did you like going to work every day? 
  
FT: Did I like going to work every day? Is that what you asked? 
  
HG: Yes. Did you enjoy the work that you were doing? 
  
FT: [Chuckles] I loved the work that I was doing. I was very well known around the VA system 
hospital. I was very well respected. I won't say everybody liked me, but most of the people that I met 
they liked me. When the new administration would come in, they wouldn't know about me, because my 
thing was that I always treat people the way I want to be treated. Then when I tell you that I wanted to 
be a nurse ever since I was eight, it meant that I enjoyed doing for people what they couldn't do for 
themselves. That was just, that was my calling, and it still is. I enjoy working with the patients and the 
staff as well. I always determined to do my best, whatever I had to do. 
  
HG: You've touched on this a bit already, but overall speaking, what was the hardest part of your job, 
and then what was the most rewarding? 
  
[44:13] FT: Let me start with the most rewarding. I think the most rewarding thing about my job was 
that I realized that I had the ability to make a difference in the patient and the veterans' lives, so I spent a 
lot of time doing that. I also met a whole lot of friends in that 30-something years that I was working.

That when I retired, some of the people that I worked with and some of the friends that I had gave me a 
retirement party, and they had to put it in the biggest room at the VA hospital, which was the spinal cord 
unit, and it lasted four hours, and I think hundreds of people came through and said goodbye to me. I 
have a book, a album, a big board where people wrote what they wanted to say to me. And I think, out 
of all that time I realized that, "Yeah, well, maybe I didn't do bad at all here.” The thing that I might not 
have liked about the VA, or the thing that kind of caused me some problems, was that the VA, like every 
hospital, have rules and regulations, policies and procedures. Most people try to follow those. But then it 
doesn't matter sometimes. Even with your best intention, things can go awry. In some of the positions 
that I applied for, one in particularly, I did not get. It was okay that I didn't get it. I think the problem 
with me was that the word and the policies said one thing, and then when the hiring took place, 
something else happened. That was probably one of my lowest points at the VA, was that they didn't 
stick to what they had written down. But that was that. But anyway, overall, I did excellent. I achieved a 
goal which I had planned for myself. After I was at the VA for 10 years, I knew that I was going to 
retire, and I also knew that I needed to retire at the highest level that I could with my education. My goal 
was to work toward that. I had 20 years in which to plan where I wanted to be when I retired. With those 
goals came opportunities, and with those goals came oppositions. I worked real hard to make sure that-- 
VA has a system that after two years, if you-- Every two years, you get a promotion, and that is if your 
proficiency is good. Usually if you stay-- If you made it to the two years, you will doing whatever you 
needed to do to be able to go into that next grade level. But for me, that wasn't-- I mean, I appreciated 
the two years and I got 'em, but my goal was to get a promotion before the two years. So, 'cause I was 
working toward a specific goal that might not have been allowed in my degree plan, but did not deter me 
from what I thought I wanted. I worked real hard to achieve a certain grade level, which meant for me 
that every year I got a raise, because I met one or two of the goals in that next level. Then that next year, 
I got my two-year promotion. For six years, I got a promotion every year. Then, when I got to where I 
had met all of the standards for that next level, there was no choice. They had to give it to me. When 
they did, they gave me the grade that I had worked for so long. I was halfway across one stage, so they 
had to take it up a little bit higher. I did achieve that level of pay grade that I wanted before I retired. 
  
AG: That's so impressive, Fayrene . Is the grade system like the military grade, or is it something 
different in the VA system? 
  
FT: I think it's really kind of like the military grade, 'cause they have GS one up to 12. Then you have a 
step in there. You have GS 11 one, two and three. I think it's basically like the military, because they 
have certain grade levels according to your degree plan. They have certain grade levels for the LVN or 
the non-registered staff. I think it's kind of like the military. 
  
AG: When you moved into the lead nurse role that was inpatient, right? 
  
[50:07] FT: Well, I actually moved into the lead nurse role when I went into the homeless program, 
because I was on my own out there. I was one that had to make the decisions about what to do with the 
veteran. When I was out in the community, I was the VA according to everybody else out there in the 
community, and I was the VA according to that veteran that saw me. I was what VA represented. So, no. 
I was a person.

AG: When you switched roles in 1996, did that take you to the inpatient setting again? 
  
FT: Yes. In 1996, when I took the head nurse role, or head nurse programming, and became a head 
nurse, I was back into inpatient. All of my career, the basis of it was inpatient, and then was six years 
outpatient. When I went back inpatient, the head nurse role is to make sure that all the people that's 
working under him or her are doing their work, are doing their assignment that they have been given. I 
was back in charge again. 
  
AG: Was that on a med surg unit, or what unit was that? 
  
FT: Okay, I start-- Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead and complete your question. 
  
AG: That was it. Just, was that med surg? 
  
FT: I went back in on a med surg unit, yes. Yes, it was med surg. I worked as the head nurse in med 
surg, and then I worked as the head nurse in the spinal cord injury unit, and then I worked-- When I 
retired, I was like manager over one of the homeless programs that I had helped develop, and over a 
portion of the IV team, which is the intravenous therapy team, at the VA when I retired. 
  
AG: And what kinds of patients are typically seen in the IV team, or by the IV team? 
  
FT: Well, the person that the IV team see is the one that need IVs, intravenous therapy, where you stick 
a needle in so you can give 'em a bottle of fluid. Or, sometimes they would go and draw blood, lab work 
that needed to be done. I was over that group. 
  
AG: And those kind of conditions could range from, like, cancer to just a blood draw for routine exams? 
  
FT: Blood draws for routine exam and for people that needed IV fluid, or IV fluids, or medicines that 
had to be given by IV. They would put the IV in. Of course, they didn't give the medicines. The nurse 
did that. 
  
AG: Was the IV unit and the other units, were they all inpatient, or were those typically outpatient 
encounters? 
  
FT: Okay. IV is not a unit. It's a group of people that go and start IVs or draw blood. Yes, that's 
inpatient. It's like a lab technician. 
  
AG: I see. Fayrene , did you have any sense of how, more recently, things like the COVID pandemic 
affected the VA system? Or do you have any exposure to the patients now and how they've been faring 
in the past year?

[54:04] FT: No, I have not been involved with the [unintelligible] for vaccination or no at the VA, but I 
am aware that the VA is giving the veterans their COVID shots, 'cause I have relatives that are veterans. 
I have a neighbor next door, one across the street, that are veterans. The VA is taking care of the 
veterans with the COVID, but they're not taking care of the veterans' families with COVID. I'm aware 
that maybe a couple of people that I know that work at the VA in the [unintelligible], maybe I think one 
of 'em maybe got the COVID virus, but the VA is doing real good. They are making sure that, especially 
on an outpatient basis, 'cause I know those as inpatient are probably getting their COVID, but they have 
a pretty good system of working with the veteran that is not in the hospital. They're setting 'em up to 
come and get their first dose, and they're setting 'em up to come and get their second dose. Then I'm with 
a nursing sorority. I don't know if you heard of it, but it's Chi Eta Phi sorority. As a sorority, we put out 
our statements and what we know about the COVID virus to our members. Then, some our members are 
on the frontline. They're out administering vaccine too, as well. One of our members made the front 
cover of Time Magazine, because she was involved in the COVID distribution of vaccine. 
  
AG: Oh, wow, that's wonderful. I didn't realize that she had made the cover. That's very cool. But I think 
I was referred to you by one of your sorority sisters. Carmen, correct? 
  
FT: Yes, Carmen Hewitt. Yeah, she and I are sorority sisters. I actually met Carmen a couple of years 
when-- I guess I've always known her, but actually just look at her and talk to her, because we were 
working with the St. Jude Children Foundation. 
  
AG: This has been so helpful for me, Fayrene . Is it okay if I ask just a few kind of broad wrap-up 
questions before we say goodbye? 
  
FT: Okay. 
  
AG: When you think back over the course of your career, what do you think your role is in providing 
patient care, or has been? 
  
FT: I think my role in providing patient care was probably what I did in my 30 years as a nurse. That 
was to treat the patient with dignity and respect, give or allow the veteran to make a choice in how they 
wanted to be taken care of, and to make sure that I kept them informed of how well they were doing and 
what they needed to do, and to be an advocate. If I thought something that they were getting wasn't what 
they should have gotten, to be an advocate for that veteran. If they were unable to speak to the doctor or  
to the nurse or to whomever was giving them care, then I would be able to help them express what it was 
that they actually wanted, what they thought they needed, and what they were not [unintelligible]. 
  
AG: I see. That makes sense. Do you think that there's anyone in your life that acted as a kind of 
professional mentor over the course of your career when you look back on it? 
  
[58:01] FT: Yes! I have a person. She was my supervisor, and from the time I went into-- I didn't know 
her until '69, because when I first went there, VA has about three or four different buildings, and so I 
was in what they call Building Number One. When I went to the coronary care unit in 1969, which was 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
2020012 
 
15 
 
a new addition that they had built on one of the already existing floors, I had a supervisor that I met. She 
was just a god-send. I always had a higher standard of what I thought I should be doing, even though I 
was a licensed vocational nurse. That was a very distinction between a licensed vocational nurse and a 
RN, registered nurse, at the VA hospital. I would do those things that I thought enhance the care and 
gave the veteran a little bit more opportunity to speak up for themselves and to be involved in their care. 
A lot of times, that didn't go over too well with the RNs, with the ladies that was already the RN. They 
thought I was doing too much or being too friendly. They would sometimes get a little bit upset, and this 
supervisor, for some reason, every time somebody was ragging on me about the care I was giving, she 
would come in. She would hear us and she would say, "What are you all arguing with her about? How 
does the patient supposed to know how to take care of his blood pressure if he don't know what his 
blood pressure is?" She really was my mentor, and I told her this before I left, and she really was my 
mentor. She actually kept me engaged, and she helped me to understand that what I was doing was what 
I should have been doing, and that regardless of how somebody else might think about what I do, as 
long as I'm doing it for the patient and in the line, I'm making sure that that patient got the best care, then 
I was gonna be fine. She was one of the people when I went back to the VA-- Remember I told you, I 
left for about a year and a half, and when I went back to the VA, to the human resource department, and 
reapplied for a job, and the guy said to me, he said, "Well, your paperwork is in Missouri," I think is 
where they kept it. He says, "So I'm not sure that we're gonna be able to hire you,” he said, "but go 
ahead and fill out the application." I think I got my name down and maybe my social security number. 
He came back. He said, “Oh my God.” He said, "What did you do to the nursing service?" He called my 
mentor's name and said, "She and the head nurse say, when can you start? Can you come in on Friday?" 
"No," I said. "I gotta get my other job that I was working a two weeks' notice." They hired me back. I 
went back on the evening shift. That person was a great mentor. I even said, a couple of my chief nurses, 
they were great mentors, too. I think everybody needs someone that believe in what they're doing, and 
someone that's in their corner, especially when you are trying to do it right. That person, or those 
persons, really helped me know that I could go forward in the VA system, regardless to what obstacles 
was there and who said what, who can have this and who couldn't. Because my grandfather taught me 
that the only person that can tell me what I cannot do or cannot have is myself. I've never told myself 
what I-- Well, I won't say I never told myself what I can't have, but I try to make sure that what I want is 
what I should have on me. 
  
AG: That's really powerful. Thank you so much. I wonder, last question is how you have seen the VA 
change over the course of your many years working there. 
  
[1:02:41] FT: Wow. When I first went to the VA hospital back in 1967, I know for both you Hannah's, 
and I don't know Alana, when I started working, the VA had two buildings, and they could house 800 
patients and no air conditioning. Here in Texas in the summer, the weather can get real, real hot. It was 
real humid and hard to work at the VA during the summer. Then in the early part of the years, all the 
utensils, the bed pans, the urinals and all those things that the patient had to use, it was up to us, the 
staff, before the end of our shift, to make sure that those things was washed, cleaned and sterilized. We 
had to sterilize our own equipment at the end of each shift. Then as time went along, by 1969, when I 
went into CCU, coronary care unit, that was the first building, or the first unit, at the VA hospital that I 
worked at had air conditioning. I thought, "Oh, wow. I'm moving on up if I'm in the air conditioning."

Then the VA actually enlarged. They put in more different units. They enlarged the dental clinic, they 
came up with a spinal cord unit injury that was dedicated to those people that were paraplegics, because 
in the beginning, they were on the med floors wherever they needed to go or surgical floors. I saw a lot 
of changes: infrastructure, I saw a lot of changes in the buildings, I saw a lot of changes in how they 
promoted people, in how they encouraged and allowed the veterans to be more productive in their own 
care and hiring of veterans. I think when I first went there, there were a couple of guys that I met that 
was veterans, that really, those guys, they really gave a lot of us the incentive to move ahead in the VA 
system. But the VA changed. They changed a lot during that time. It became more inclusive. I saw more 
people of color get positions of authority, and that was great. That was great. 
  
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to add, Fayrene , before we conclude? 
  
FT: I guess the only thing I would like to say, 'cause I told Carmen I was really appreciative that I saw 
this opportunity to talk about my VA experiences. When I first saw it, I thought, "I don't know. I don't 
think I want to do that one." Then, a couple of days later, before it was too late, I said, "You know, I 
really do want to talk about my VA experience." I'm glad that you all have given me this opportunity to 
speak to you all about my experiences at the VA. Hopefully, I gave you a pretty good idea of what it 
was like to work at the VA. The challenges, I probably didn't go as deep into them, because I didn't think 
that was needed. I just think that there were some challenges and that I overcame them was the need and 
not to trash nobody. Thank you all again for allowing me to speak to you. I can see one Hannah, but I 
haven't seen the other one. And Alana, can I see your face? 
  
AG: You can't see me? 
  
FT: No. I have a H and a G that's just got a G circle. And I see Hannah. I see one Hannah. It shows-- 
yeah. 
  
HS: Hello. 
  
FT: There you are. Hey! 
  
AG: You can see me? 
  
FT: Yeah, I can see you now. 
  
AG: Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you could see me. I apologize. 
  
FT: And I can see the other Hannah. 
  
AG: Oh, my gosh, that's a bummer, because it's so much nicer when you can see that we're listening and 
engaged. I apologize. 
  
FT: That's alright.

the call for. This was such a wonderful interview. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. 
  
FT: Okay. Well, thank you all for having me.
