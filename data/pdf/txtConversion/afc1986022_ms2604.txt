them for a little while and one day the gate was open, and the dog got away and never did
come back. We had the dog about a year, and uh well, one of them was two, boy and girl
dog. The boy died on about three or four months after he died, the other-somebody left
the gate open and she got away and we never did see her no more. The we had a big old

come back, he got loose and somebody else had him, and uh they put a collar around him,

yeah, so evidently he must have been with two or three families. I forgot what happened
to him now, <unintelligible text> I don't know where, the last time the guy we never did see
him no more, that was it, its been so long ago, but I never did come <unintelligible text>

the house if I ever had any we would always keep them outside. I don't like no dog in the
house.I don't think its healthy for the dog to be in the house, let them stay outside. The
only time we would let them in the house- we give him a bath, you know, let him stay in for
an hour or two to get good and dry, and let him out again.

remember climbing, they maybe had a seesaw or something, but I can't remember
anything to climb on. Of course we use to climb on the post, you know, the swing, you've
seen them. We use to climb over them, and walk across them-like they have these
monkey bars nowadays, I don't think they had them back in those days.

IN: I had one in the fifth grade, hollering at the kids mostly to be quiet, yeah that was the
one thing, the kids was bad, you know, and she was an old maid teacher and she wasn't
too young either, you know, so I guess maybe the kids was getting on her nerves, and she

IN: I can't remember now, oh, uh I had a couple of them that was nice, I had one person
when I was in the third grade, and then when I was in the tenth grade, they just you know,
seem to be nice, you know.
<unintelligible text>
IN: Well, the one that I remember about, the one in the tenth grade was some of the kids
was bad, you know, and the good kids, you know, the good kids were making their own
business and keeping quiet, well, you wouldn't have to stay after school, but if you was
bad, you know, you would have to stay thats the one thing I remember about, about her, I
know I never did have to stay. I never did in high school, but I never was bad, never broke
up nothing you know, and try to keep someone else from going, if they wanted to go, but I
didn't care about going myself.
<unintelligible text>
of the kids nowadys, they don't want to go and they try to keep the other kids, you know,
they hang around school, and thats what don't make sense to me, if they don't like school
what why do they want to hang around it, you know, they've been put out, you know a lot
of them <unintelligible text> own and uh then they want to hang around.
