Charmin' Dame
CHARMIN' DAME
Russ Pike Visalia, 1941
Once I courted a charmin' beauty dame I courted her for love and her love I did obtain But
when her cruel parents they came this to know That her and I were together for to go They
put her in a room and they treated her so severe That I never but once more caught the
sight of my dear.
Then a glass window I chanced for to go To see if my love had forgotten me or no But
when I got there she wrung her hands and cried Now I love the man that loves me And
shall until I die.
Then I enlisted the wars for to go To see if I could forget my love or no But when I got
there the guns shone so bright It put me more in mind of my own heart's delight.
Then seven long years I served my king And in seven long years I returned home again
And when her mother saw me coming She wrung her hands and cried Oh my daughter
loved you dearly And for your sake she died.
Then I was struck li e a man that had been slain Tears from my eyes fell like showers of
rain Crying Oh Oh Oh the grief I cannot bear My love lies in her grave and I wish that I was
there.
