Alan Lomax has  done a great many things during his  life
 
-
-
 and he was  forever agitating to do more -
-
 but documenting
 
the varied musics he heard everywhere he went has always been
 
central to him.  He got to be astonishingly good at the
 
awkward act of field recording,  in part because he  just never
 
stopped doing it.  Time after time in place after place he
 
recorded the music he  sought,  somehow always able to infect
 
the musicians and singers with his enthusiasm for their work
 
and the total  joy he  felt when a particular performance  lived
 
up to its musical stature.
 
During his active career he recorded,  edited and
 
produced well over
 long playing records,  and it was
 
always his hope that they would stay in print,  especially so
 
that the musicians themselves could hear in tranquility how
 
beautiful their music sounded.  He coined the term "musical
 
feedback" to express his deep concern that the people
 
themselves must be the primary audience.
 
Now Rounder Records has undertaken to make Alan Lomax's
 
entire lifetime of recordings available to the world of
 
listeners  in the form of "The Lomax Collection".  Both re-
issues of discs  long out of print and new material from the
 
Lomax archive are being edited onto compact discs by
 
knowledgable colleagues under the general guidance of
 
daughter Anna Chairetakis,  sister Bess Lomax Hawes,  legal
 
representative Jefferey Goldberg,  and,  as far as possible,
 
Alan Lomax himself.  What great  sounds we will be hearing.
 
Alan Lo max has done many t
hings during h
is l
ife--and he was f
orever agitating t
o do more--
but docu menting t
he varied musics he d
iscovered everywhere he went has been h
is ruling passion. As
 
a
 f
ield worker, Lo max developed t
he keenest s
ensibility t
o t
he aesthetics of
 world music and g
reat
 
i
nsight int o and empathy f
or t
he a
rtists and cultures t
hat p
roduced t
he m. These qualities enabled h
im
 
t
o capture, t
ime a
fter t
ime and i
n p
lace af
ter p
lace, performances of
 surpassing beauty and r
esonance.
 
Although he has s
o metimes t
alked about t
he happy accidents t
hat b
rought h
i m t
o g
reat d
iscoveries, h
is
 
best r
ecordings were of
ten t
he r
esult of
 a
 patient and t
horoughgoing approach with h
is i
nformants.
 
Alan was s
o mehow a
lways able t
o i
nfect t
he musicians and s
ingers he r
ecorded with h
is enthusiasm
 
f
or t
heir work and t
he t
otal joy he f
elt when a
 particular performance l
ived up t
o i
ts musical s
tature.
 
Beyond t
heir musical worth, h
is r
ecordings p
rovide a
 unique window on t
he unwritten h
istory of
 t
he
 
world's peoples.
 
During h
is a
ctive career Alan Lomax r
ecorded, edited and p
roduced well over a
 hundred
 
r
ecords, t
apes and CDS of
 f
olk and t
raditional music f
ro m t
he United S
tates, t
he Caribbean, England,
 
Wales, Scotland and I
reland, I
taly and Spain, p
lus c
lassic compilations of colleagues' r
ecordings f
rom
 
e
leven o
ther countries. I
t
 was a
lways h
is hope t
hat t
hese r
ecordings would s
tay i
n print, e
specially s
o
 
t
hat t
he musicians and t
heir audiences could continue t
o hear i
n t
ranquility how beautiful t
heir music
 
s
ounded. Alan coined t
he t
erm "musical f
eedback" t
o express h
is deep concern t
hat t
he people
 
t
hemselves must be t
he pri mary audience.
 
I
n r
ecent years only a
 handful of Alan Lomax's f
ield r
ecordings have been com mercially
 
available. Now Rounder Records has undertaken t
o make Alan Lomax's entire l
ifeti me of
 r
ecordings
 
available t

i
