Abstract: Dennis Hardiman farmed with his grandfather and his father on their farms in Gibson
County. Mr. Hardiman was the first African American baby born in the “white” maternity ward
of the racially segregated Princeton Hospital in Princeton, Indiana. African American women
were relegated to a ward in the basement, but his mother almost died during labor, so she was
brought upstairs where the facility was better, and Dennis was born there. After earning his BA
at Purdue University, Dennis Hardiman went to Colorado to get his veterinarian’s degree. He
returned to help his father with the farm, and ultimately took over farming there. Dennis
Hardiman mentions in this interview that his family had not built a barn in generations, because
hostile white neighbors had repeatedly burned their barns in the past. This resulted in the loss of
their animals, their stored crops and their equipment. However, it is also very challenging to farm
without a barn, during the harsh Indiana winters. Mr. Hardiman is locally renowned for working
with ox and horse teams he trained himself, for his logging and farming operations, and he was a
skilled trainer. He came from a long line of metal-workers and metal forgers, a passion he and his
grandson, Logan, share.
