Dear Dr. Spivacke:
Inclosed is copy of official request for continuance of the project for recording folksongs in
Florida. We would appreciate anything your committee can do to expedite this.
Due to the fact that Professor Morris used blanks of the University of Florida for his
recordings, we are not short of a supply. We have experienced some delay in recording at
Fernandina and St. Augustine, due to reorganization of Writers' and Music, but we expect
to proceed this week. Indirectly we have received suggestions from Mr. Seegar and have
noted them carefully. We will be glad to have any further comments and directions you
may care to send us.
Sincerely yours, Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor, Statewide
