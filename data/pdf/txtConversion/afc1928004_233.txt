BIOGRAPHICA L SKETCH OF JOHNNY ROACH. 
- 
Tim now well-known and greatly admired comic vocalist is a 
native of this country. 
He was born in Newport, It. I., in 1840. 
From that town his parents removed, when " Johnny " was 
but a 
year old, to this city. 
They remained in this city until 
he had attained his eighth year. 
To 
Cold Spring, on the Hud-
son, opposite West Point, was their. next migration. 
Here the 
embryo vocalist remained at school until he became sixteen, 
when he was apprenticed to the machinist's business. 
At this 
trade he worked five years, alving his employers satisfaction by 
his skill and diligence, and leaving their employ with their ex-
pressed regret. 
The ancients would have said that the Muses of Mirth and 
Melody must have presided at the birth of Jouxsv ROACH, for 
he was a 
naturally born comic vocalist. 
To a 
rich, powerful, 
bell-toned voice, he adds a 
facility of facial expression absolute-
ly'marvellous ; he can give it at least twenty entirely different 
expressions in the same number of seconds. 
He has, also, the 
unusual gift of plainly articulating every word, so that his audi-
tors never miss a 
syllable. 
So early did he evince the poetic faculty, that when but 
twelve he wrote a 
song about a 
neighboring farmer, who once 
caught him in his orchard ; and many a 
hearty lat42,11 rang 
through the village in attestation of JOHNNY'S metrical and hu-
morous abilities. 
Not only did 3,-011112- ReAcii ridicule Ids 
schoolmates in juvenile rhyme, but his t;choolmaster was occa-
sionally the subject of his sportive verses. 
Still his hide re-
mained untanned and his head unpunched, though threats were 
frequent and loud. 
Having thorough'y learned his trade, Jousxy ItoAcu came to 
this city to and work. 
Here he married, and has continued 
ever since to reside, with the exception of a 
few short intervals; 
being now a citizen of some thirteen years standing. 
Ve”y 
many pressing invitations to visit other cities have been extend-
ed to him, but he seems fully satisfied with the great and en-
during popularity that he has gained at home. 
No wonder that JOHNNY ROACH cares not to leave New York, 
for here his name is " familiar in our ears as household words." 
(1) 
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF JOHNNY 
ROACH. 
Continued. 
The songs that he has composed have gained such boundless 
popularity, that many of the so- styled Professionals not only 
sing them, but try to palm them off on the public as their own 
originals. 
Mr. E.oAcu (unlike some.of his cotemporaries) makes no pre-
tensions to have written more songs than any one else, or that 
it has cost him a 
small fortune for his songs. 
But every song 
that he claims is his own, costing him only the ingenuity of orig-
inating and working up the subject and writing the words. 
He 
has never had to resort to the questionable aid of dramatic 
scribblers, or would-be song writers—fellows who are willing to 
write for merely a 
chance to hear their songs sung once, and 
then see them die. 
As he is one of Nature's rhymsters—to the 
manner born—he has no other motive for writing than is implied 
in the following 
"words 
As some rude bird, amid the trackless wild, 
Its inharmonious notes pours on the breeze, 
So oft have I 
the tedious hours beguiled, 
With scarce a 
hope, or even a 
wish to please." 
From time to time different publishers have issued books, 
bearing "JOHNNY RoAcu's" name, which have gained great 
popularity throughout the United States and Canada. 
This 
book far surpasses them all—it is unquestionably his master-
piece. 
It contains a 
great number of his own original songs, 
together with a 
careful selection of the most popular songs of 
the present day (both English and American) judiciously gath-
ered by himself.

THE HAT ME FATHER WORE. 
Composed by DANIEL McCAEry, and given by him to JOHNNY ROACH; 
as 
a 
token of respect. 
Ala.—" Irish Molly, 01" 
I'm Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea-, 
For singing or for dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye ; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's day I 
love to wear the hat me father wore. 
cuoacs. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen ; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green.. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore. 
It's old, etc.

JOHNNY ROACH'S VERSION OF THE SONG 
OF THE FLAGS . 
THERE'S a 
nation of good people who come from the River Rhine, 
who are famous for their industry— 
Good citizens in peace, brave soldiers make in war, ever ready 
in the cause of liberty ; 
Though bound by oppression's yoke, yet they love that father-
land, and ring its songs here in this land that's free ; 
May they ever dwell with us, and with us find a 
home in happi-
ness, in peace, and unity. 
ClIORUs.—German Flag. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, that fair land of the vine, 
And may its sons for ever sing their glorious Wacht am Rhein. 
There's another nation, no braver can be found, whose sons have 
won a 
name for chivalry, 
And well they do deserve it, as every nation knows, for they are 
found in every battle on land or sea ; 
They have struccgled hard themselves to throw off the tyrants' 
yoke, and 1 
only pray the day we soon shall see 
When the green flag is unfurled, it's proclaimed throughout the 
world, old Ireland, dear Ireland, you are free. 
ellORUS.—Irish Rag. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, that bright gem of the sea, 
And may we live to see the day old Ireland will be free. 
There was a 
band of patriots who struggled for their rights when 
the tyrant by taxation ground them down ; 
But they showed that mother country they hail rights she must 
respect, when her tea in Boston harbor they drowned ; 
They -have left a 
name behind them that time will no'er erase, 
and a 
home where every exile can be free ; 
May its flag for ever wave o'er the land of the true and brave, 
this God-like land of liberty. 
cnonus.—American Flag. 
Here's the flag of America, the home of the brave and free, 
And may its folds forever wave o'er this land of Fbortv.

Go with me and I'll treat you dacent ; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can ; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest ; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast ; 
I'm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan ; 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a

don't give a

As I

Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a

My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jamey, 
l'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I

STOKES' 
VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON. 
AIR.—" Never go Back on the Poor." 
IF, you'll listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this " glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference " I'll show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of " stamps," you can bold up —our head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold— 
Let the " rich" go, but hang up the poor! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we've had now-a- days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his grave— 
A 
good man as ever was born— 
Jim Fisk he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast, the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure ; 
Though be lived like a " Prince" in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf " from the door ; 
He strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But be never went back on the poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his " heart on his sleeve," 
No matter what people would say, 
And he done all his deeds (both the good and the bad) 
In the broad open light of the day. 
With his grand " six-in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash " to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire" show'd the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his 
wealth," still remembered the poor ! 
(1) 
STOKES' VERDICT.—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
us " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk,' 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor! 
Now, what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this friend of the poor ? 
When such men get free, is there any one safe 
If they step from outside their own door ? 
Is there one law for the poor and one for the rich 1 
It seems so, at least so I 
say; 
If they hang up the poor, why—damn it !—the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way ! 
CHORUS. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe," 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back en the poor. 
Oh shame on this " land of the free and the brave,"/ 
When such sights as this meet our eye! 
The poor in their prisons are treated like slaves; 
While the rich in their cells they live high. 
A 
poor devil " crazy with drink," they will hang 
For a 
murder he didn't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " political friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to snend! 
CHORUS. 
But if things go on this way, we'll stand it no more J) 
The people will rise up in bands; 
A Vigilance Committee we'll raise on our shore,} , 
And take the law in our own hands!

YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND TO ME. 
Sutr,! by ED. BURTON, the popular baritone. 
MY 
bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when youth was in its 
prime ; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my sorrowed heart was 
free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend to 
me. 
CHORU S. 
ne'er forget where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be 
If ever I 
have had a 
friend, 
You've been a 
friend to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been for you ; 
Sind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life : 
I 
now look back upon the past, along life's stormy sea, 
I 
smile to think ' mid all life's scenes, you've been a 
friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc.

THE GIRL ACROSS THE WAY., 
Ant.—" Ten Thousand Miles Away." 
I 
SUPPOSE yes all heard this tune, 
It's ten thousand miles away, 
But's not the one Pin going to sing 
For that has had its day. 
But I'm going to tell of an Irish girl, 
Who loves me, so they say, ay, ay 
She's plump and fat as butter, boys, 
And she lives across the way. 
cnouus. 
My Peg she has blue eyes, 
her trade is making pies, 
her cheeks is red, 
And so is her head, 
And she hails from Dublin Bay, ay, ay, 
She is as thick as she is tall, 
And she wears a 
waterfall, 
She's gone on me, that's plain to see, 
My girl across the way. 
Her father is a 
Connaught man, 
her mother is a 
Tip, 
And she was born in Kerry, 
So yes see she's not a

I've told yes all I 
can, me boys, 
For I 
must not delay, ha, ha, 
For this very night Pm to be spliced 
To this girl across the way.

KY LITTLE ONE'S WATCHING FOR ME. 
IN 
the dell where the brooklet's gently flowing, 
On the bench ' neat!' the old willow tree, 
Where the birds • theif songs are gently singing, 
My little one's waiting for me, 
And she knows well the sound of my footstep 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretched to greet her, 
My little one's waiting for me. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
And at night when my daily toil is over, 
And Pm wending my way towards my home, 
My heart always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one's waiting for me. 
As I

Their watching I

On the bench ' Death the old weeping willow 
My little one's waiting for me.

How dear

(

I 
remember the fire-place with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stood by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving, came puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes. 
And then, too, Saint Nicholas, slyly and still, 
Caine down every Christmas, our stockings to fill. 
But the clearest of mem'ries I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor. 
Cho.- 0 
the old kitchen floor, ecc. 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
Her footsteps were busy, her heart always light; 
For it seemed to me then, that she knew not a

The smile was so gentle her face used to wear. 
I 
remember with pleasure what joyitilled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new ev'ry night, though we'd heard them before, 
From her lips, at the wheel, on the old kitchen floor.

To-night those old visions come back at their will, 
But the wheel and its music forever are still ; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie mould'ring to clay; 
The hearthstone, so sacred, is just as ' twas then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor.

I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That, when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of the mother who long ago died. 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
To have them tell often, as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor.

WILL YOU EVER SHOOT THAT HAT ? 
Composed and sung by JOHNNY ROACH.

Ain.—" My Love Nell." 
My name is Mike McClusky, from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've declared my intentions as an American citizen ; 
I'm proud of my ancestors, for I 
came from the rale old stock, 
And on Patrick's day we march away and parade with our old 
bats.

When the band does play we march away, the Kerrigans, tho 
O's, and Macks, 
And the boys all shout, when we turn out, " Will you ever shoot 
that at 1" 
This hat was made for a 
cousin of mine in seventeen ninety-
eight, 
And when he died he left it to me, so it will never be out of 
date. 
It's travelled the wide says over, from Ireland to America, 
And it's seen to the best advantage upon St. Patrick's day. 
When the band does play, etc. 
Then come, brave boys, and join with us before it is too late, 
And we'll all turn out on Patrick's day, and that day we'll cele-
brate 
In honor of our native land, that land we wish was free ; 
We invite all true-bred Irishmen to join in our company.

T.GE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
As sung by NED HARRIGAN. 
0 t 
list to the lay of a 
po r 
Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by thorn, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Cull me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dwehing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget Phelim Braly, the Bard of Armagh. 
ROCK THE CRADLE. PAT. 
Ant:—" Rock the Cradle, John." 
Paddy Burke was a 
man of work, from Limerick town he came, 
He married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the name of Kane; 
Now Pat and his wife, through six years' strife, were never blessed 
with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is what she'd cry: 
CHORUS. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore he'd go and ' list; 
4k 
I 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, ' twould drive him out of 
his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly song 
Rock the cradle, Pat, & c. 
Now Paddy Burke, this man of work, be ha,In't been long away, 
Till his wife fell in with a 
big spalpeen, who soon led her astray; 
For three years long, their love was strong, till one fine summer's day 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her favorite lay : 
Rock the cradle, Pat, kc. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby hale and strong, 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
"Woo has been here since I 
was gone 7" 
"It was Providence, Pat," she said, " done that, be was good to me 
three years long. 
And now you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song." 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR 
Ala.—" Don't put your foot on a 
man when he's down" 
IN 
this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar content day by day, 
Or else home in hun ,*er to go 1 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door, 
Assist hint in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never go back on the poor. 
From the will waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron-bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar, 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
CIIOIIIJS 
Can it be such neglect shall by us be forgot 3 
Or that money shall triumph once more? 
A 
good willim* hand a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
For those who go back on the poor.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR.—Continued. 
When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
" ' Tis only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shot out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own; 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth, 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CLIORITS. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood- red, afloat and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor- house that they might be free. 
But now, stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmothers driven away ; 
I 
don't think the people rill stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
CHORUS. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night 
To keep hunger and pain from the door 
have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
Let us never go back on the poor.

And every time I'd chance to meet

COMING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. II. H ARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. II.Atinnto, 233 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball- room, 
When we are dancing, in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's all Very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coining home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn collies around, we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our liemls, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our beds. 
Oh, it's all, ete. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long ; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
A 
nd we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
Oh, it's all, etc.

NEW 
VERSION OF THE BELLE OF THE BALL. 
To a 
ball I 
one night wa4 invited, 
And being so fond of the dance, 
At the prospect I 
felt quite delighted, 
And eagerly jumped at the chance ; 
There were swells looking out for belles, 
And belles were fishing for beaux, 
But a 
pal introduced me to one 
Whom I 
thought far outrivalled the rose. 
CHORUS. 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the best of them all, dear boy, 
She is the belle of the ball. 
The envy of all the fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy-like grace, 
But just in the midst of the lancers, 
The lady turned black in the face ; 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she glared, 
And seized hold the tail of my coat; 
Alas, the top teeth of my partner 
had slipped down her beautiful throat. 
SPOKEN.—Well, there's nothing so detrimental in a 
false 
tooth or two ; so I 
thought still that— 
She was the belle, etc. 
How the ladies they giggled and tittered, 
Of course you may easily guess ; 
Though my feelings were sadly embittered, 
I 
would not leave a 
girl in distress ; 
So we madly rushed into a 
waltz, 
When she tumbled o'er some fellow's leg, 
When off came her hair—'twas all false, 
And her head it was bald as an egg. 
CHORUS. 
How is your belle of the ball, dear boy 
how is your belle of the ball, dear boy 7 
0, wasn't she bald at the ball, dear boy 7 
How is your belle of the ball 7

BOSTON FIRE. 
As sung with success by Miss ANNig RATELLE. 
Am.—" Pat Won't Go Home Till Morning." 
IT 
was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we h?ard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fl- king had cast its burning embers 
O'er anotl:.?r fated city in our land. 
As the woeftf tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophy so dire, 
That Boston, beuteous city, was on fire, 
And sinking ' Leath the fiend's relentless hand. 
CHORUS. 
Fire ! fire I 
was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all this world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish prayed, 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed ; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
As the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fire! fire! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king so tyrannic, 
But the brave hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than the soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story. 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
CHORUS. 
And soon will no trace remain. 
Of this vast sea of flame; 
Boston will rise again remember; 
Brave men will be found, 
,Who will build a 
fairer town 
Like Chicago, from the ground, 
Before the next November.

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN. 
W HEN I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me ; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
If; 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
lat!,an. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I ' listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
SPOKEN.—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six feet 
five, and as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's walk— 
people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to come in-
to my mother's shebeen-shop every morning for a 
noggin of \OILS-
key, and he'd talk to me about the battles be was in and the 
battles he wasn't in ; about the Generals he killed and the Gen-
erals that killed him, until he had me as full of military ardor 
as an egg is full of' 
meat. 
One morning he said to me, 
" 
Paddy," said he, " will you take a 
shilling's farth ?" 
Said I, 
" 
I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute." " Oh," said he, " you 
don't understand me, the Queen wants men." " Well," said I, " I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the Queen." 
No, 
no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you list ?" " I 
don't 
mind if I 
do," said I. 
So I 
donned the regimentals and off I 
started to his 
C110ItUS. 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy, 
Hub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy. 
Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing 
it ; 
Bat something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, you're put-
tin ,
r, your foot in it; 
Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Cala-
gan ; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in my eye, to go marching with Briga-
dier Branigan. 
Sea K Ex.—We were all drawn up in rasp and file—or rank and 
tile as ' lie Brigadier called it. 
One fine morning I 
walked over 
to him a, ,wilite as you please. ' Good morning, your honor," 
said I; " would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater this 
morning ?" " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the road 
(1) 
BRIGADIER BRANIGAN.—Continued. 
we started to a 
shebeen-shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. I 
was 
pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug out of 
my hand. " Hould on, Paddy, me boy," said he ; " discipline 
among the men. 
The private are never allowed to drink while 
the officers are around." 
He put the mug to his mouth and 
divil a 
sup lie left for poor me. " Fall in !" he cried. " Arrah, 
we'll not fall out," said I. " Stand at ase 1" " How can I 
when 
there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot ?" " Forward, 
march 1" 
I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, he drew 
his sword and hit Inc with the flat of it across the hip, which 
made me limp off to his 
Rub a 
dub, etc. 
Soon into battle we went, where the bullets where shooting and 
flying sure ; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying sure ; 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy O'Ca-
lanan; 
With the Brigadier's head it made free, faith it finished Briga-
dier Brani,gan. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there we stool, Murphy on one side, I 
on the 
other and the Brigadier in the middle, when along came a 
bomb-
shell taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah 1" 
cried Murphy, raising his hand. " We're free at last!" when 
along caine another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah 1" cried Murphy, " Pve lost inc hand 1 
I've 
lost me hand !'' " Hould your gab, you black- guard," said I, 
" 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
says about it." 
I 
went over to where be was lying. " Are you kilt '?" said I 
He didn't condescend to speak to me. " If you have any request 
to make," said I, " if you tell toe what it is, I 
will do it for you." 
" 
Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and spach-
less, and if you have any regards for me, you'll he after going 
over the field and looking for my head, place it on lily should-
ers, and see me buried dacently." " 
do that same," said I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head ; at last I 
came to 
it, tryinc, to roll over to a 
canteen full of whiskey. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his noqe. I 
brought it over to him. " There's your head," said 
I. " No Paddy, that's not my head." " Yes it is," said I. " No, 
it's not," said he. " Well, head or no head," said 1, " divil an-
other head you'll get from me 1" So I 
threw his head in his face 
and I 
ran off singing

ANL —" Crime." 
I'TE been cirir.lting of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now l'm obliged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar :" You're a

You're something I

You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your band. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I

You could drink a

And drink cocktails all night and all day ; 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger; 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin- sling, sir, 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry 
'Tis true what you say, Mr Landlord, 
Good liquor is hard to resist ; 
Just look at that poor drunken rounder— 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed ; 
Can you wonder at his weak constitution, 
When he drinks every time that he's asked t 
(

THE INCREASE OF THIRST.—Continued. 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last. 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend her ! 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her— 
Can you wonder they're hungry and dry ? 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder, 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat ? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight ; 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too prowl to drink rum; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one! 
Go visit the places that I 
take in ; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold! 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under ; 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
! 
why will you let me go dry ?

She makes me do the household worL.

She kicks inc round about the room, 
Yet not a

say; 
I 
have to wash my stockings, 
My fronts and shirts, I 
vow, 
And if I

There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, &e. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her every farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek 
To give me two pence for myself, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, die. 
When we had neither girl nor boy, 
She cast on me the blame; 
Now that we've five little ones, 
She grumbles just the same ; 
But I 
no longer must be stopping, 
So at once I'll make my bow, 
For if my old woman should but pop 
There's bound to be a

THE BUGABOO° 
As Sung by JERRY BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I went 
throurYh,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
B 
ugAboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first 1 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
B 
u4a boo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the boo of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate crave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
Ile called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out ; 
But the helinsm -in was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so bard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*RTeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and ri0,000 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo.

DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA. 
By II.Esny TUCKER. 
On ! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime ; 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
Is the sunlit face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call. 
! 
most I 
love the twilight when time pearly dew-drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they a.11 will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc.

Written and composed by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning,, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control ; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
How dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her; 
Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you heed me? 
How can you treat me so '1 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful ; 
Your like I 
ricer did see; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me bel 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention ; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said. 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away ? " 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc.

AIN'T YOU AWFUL.—Continued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatter; 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be ; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me. 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That, he did not care for me ; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said--
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
A HANDFUL OF TURF. 
As sung by Ell HORTON. 
IT'S sailing I 
am at the (lawn of the day. 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor beart will be; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin. Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland one more.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY . 
Revised and Sung by JOHNNY Roscit with great success. 
Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm ,God knows how far awly ) 
There's politicians now- a-days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows. 
Good gracious that's a 
joke 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
In Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
beard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
The thought I 
was a 
little fiat— perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
GRANDFATHER SAX 
Young folks, come listen to my song, 
I'm old, I 
won't detain you long, 
Eighty-four you must know I

The young folks call me grandfather Sam. 
My hair once black has all turned gray, 
But what, of that while I 
feel gay,

if I

When r

But many sorrows have come, toy boys,

But now it has fallen from me,

And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me. 
Yet whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other years: 
And forever, and forever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As the symbol of love in heaven, 
And its waTering image here.

THE HEN OONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
-Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
sl.ow of fuss and loathers 
Ne'er before was Seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitap•ongs, 
And game- fowls, fine and tall ; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged ti-me highest 
At the Hen Convention Show. 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick'd 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantanss 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Bays Bantam, ‘` If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, eka. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip. 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show.

THAT'S THE PROPER CAPER.

That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; 
When things are done in proper style, I 
always like to say, 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; be fair and. 
True in all you do, for that's the proper way. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
A 
very nice young man; 
I 
asked him could he dine with me; 
Of course he said, I 
can; 
We dined and wined in sumptuous style. 
And smoked our Henry Clays ; 
And when we parted he remarked, 
My friend, I 
like your ways. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
My sweetheart is a 
pretty girl, 
So lovely and so fair; 
Some day she's going to marry me, 
My future life to share ; 
A rich young man was after her, 
But his love she could not see ; 
She told him he was not the thing, 
She rather fancied me. 
That's the proper caper, etc.

Y OU N EV ER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught o 
the were quite a 
charm 
She would often tike me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say ; 
cuoncs. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch- word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your hances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For pm nev, r 
miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years mild on f 
grew to be a 
mischief- making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when of hues well chastised, 
how father sat beside me, aud thus ha:, me advised ; 
Waste not, want not, cto. 
When T 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
ragged road, hestrmn with care and strife, 
1 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering int my ear. 
Waste not, want not,

As swig by Gus WILLIAMN 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue ; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you sqy so before ! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop ; 
Said T, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I

Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me ;

THE ORPHAN BOY. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
MY 
poor old mother and I 
did part when I 
was very young, 
her memory still around my heart like the morning mist has 
clung; 
They tell me of my mother's form, she watched o'er me \while I 
slept, 
And with her light and gentle hand she wiped the tears I 
wept. 
enouus. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purest joy, 
I 
wonder it' she thinks of me, her little orphan boy. 
And that same hand that held my own when I 
began to walk, 
And the joy that sparkled in her eyes when 1 
began to talk; 
I 
remember, too, when I 
was ill she'd kiss my burning brow, 
And the tears that fell upon my cheeks, I 
think I 
feel them now. 
CHORUS. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purest joy, 
I 
wonder if she thinks of me, her little orphan hay. 
And then she used to kneel with me and teach me how to pray, 
She'd lay her hands upon her breast to teach me the way. 
Oh, mother—mother 
in this breast thy image still shall be, 
And I 
will strive even to the last for to remember thee. 
CHORUS. 
But now my mother's gone to rest in realms of purea joy, 
I 
wonder if she thinks of me, her little orphan buy.

Pat OO'Brien 
ien it is my name, 1'11 tell you, boys, from whence I

Ould Irelan 1 
is the place I

No country is so dear to me as the lietle isle stands near the

the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and 
mirth, 
It's equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them ytm 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS 
Pat O'Brien is my name, ill tell you boys, from where I 
came. 
Ould It-el:1rd is the place I

Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defend, 
Gainst all invaders who di& intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
lie advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all 
Ii 
s 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare, 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
lie always proved poor Paddy's friend when to his trial he did 
attend, 
lie caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien. & c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and labies to 
wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each chord 
again, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea, 
And all our toasts be, Ireland free 1 
and you'll la, happy then.

To escape his glances Fan did try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
pie,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
The pie, it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the way the story goes; 
The rival of Dan was a

That's the way the story goes. 
Fan gained her father's and mother's consent, 
To get married, and off with the pieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
For coming away from church that day, 
That's the way the story goes; 
A German band began to play, 
That's the way the story goes; 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, 
Knocked down and killed the poor pieman, 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
Now, broken-hearted, about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
lie heeds her not, but passes her by ; 
All hot! two a

And" she's sorry she ever took the pie,— 
That's the way the story goes.

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
lye lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go ; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive. perhaps she's on the sea; 
Perhaps she's goite to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk ; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea.

Perhaps she's, & c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she

Perhaps she's. &c. 
I 
hope she'll have a

And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day

THTI LAD FROM IRELAND. 
By JOHRICY ROACH

I'm one of them curious roving young blades, 
That don't care a 
snap whatever I'm at ; 
I 
can handle the stick though I 
was raised to the spade, 
In the land where the buttermilk flows ; 
It's there you will find the colleens are fair, 
And the boys areas brave as can be; 
There a 
stranger is welcome, no matter from where, 
And receives hospitality free. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm the lad from Ireland, ha, ha ! from Ireland, ha, ha! 
from Ireland, ha, ha ! 
For I'm the lad from Ireland, ha. ha ! of my country I 
ne'er 
was ashamed, hurrah ! 
When at home my delight was a 
fine jaunting car, 
With my lassie so dear I'd drive to the fair, 
And there on the green we'd trip lieht as air, 
There was none that with us could compare ; 
But if a 
spalpeen would dare make too bold, 
aid he'd dare to g 
fiend, 
I 
would soon draw my cabine and then crack his pole, 
Fr the girl I 
was sure to defend. 
For Tin the lad, etc. 
Whenever I 
could, the girls I'd annoy, 
To my perfect jay they'd cal me their boy, 
And many a 
one that dropp ,g1 a - alt tear, 
When I 
left dear old Ire!and so far. 
I 
could dance a 
neat kr, or sing a 
good song, 
0: at burly for a

There's none that love3 his native land more—

NEW 
VERSION OF SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
W HEN I 
landed in swate Castle Garden, 
I 
just come from off the big say; 
In me pocket I 
hadn't a larthen 
When I 
lepped out upon the Broadway. 
I 
stepped up to a 
lamplighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, but his hair 
Was cut like a 
prize fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my trunk and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
So hurrah for the stars and stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs ; 
If I 
hadn't come here, 
I'd be digging turf in the bogs. 
The road it was dirty and slippy, 
Till I 
came to a 
street they called Wall, 
When the blaggua.rds called out, " There goes croppy," 
Till I 
came to the big City Hall. 
I 
axed a 
Dutch peddler the way, 
And he answered me " Thunder and blitzen!" 
Judge Connolly lepped out, be me sowl, 
And made me an American citizen. 
So hurrah, ctc. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
He tould me his name it was Hobbes, 
lie sold me a 
pass for Chicago; 
Be me sowl, it was the old j-:.ck of clubs. 
But I 
mustn't indulge in reflection, 
For what I 
have said ain't worth note; 
Ill be running for sheriff next election. 
So step up, me heroes, and vote. 
So hurrah, etc. 
Its when I 
arrived in Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm; 
The commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm ? 
"No," sez I, " I'll go back to New York, 
For the politics there are so pretty; 
Send your Dutchman way out on the farm, 
But, be jabers, I'll stick to the city." 
So hurrah, etc. 
Then come along, Jimmy; don't tarry, 
And bring along Jerry and Pat, 
Brien Connel and Mickey and Larry, 
Big Dennis and Darby and Mat; 
You'll get your citizen's I 
ape's 
As you step on the dock lrom the boat, 
And the big Tammany Ingin, be jabers, 
Will show ye the right way to vote. 
So hurrah, etc.

4 ' KEEP TO THE RIGHT .* 
Words by Monty LINN. 
Music by RotAxn Bownite. 
One day while walking thro' the streets, amidst a 
busy throng, 
Studying and nansing on a 
subject for my song, 
A hoard naird to a 
corner, it quickly caught my sight. 
And painted there I 
saw the warning, " Keep to the right," 
cnonts. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, shun whate'er is wrong, 
Then upon life's billoWS you'll go merrily along. 
Be hoaest in your dealings, morning, noon, and night, 
And let your watchword always be, boys, keep to the right. 
Keep a 
smiling countenance, never wear a 
frown, 
Do not try to raise yourself by pulling others down, 
Envy not your neirrhbor, ne'or indulge in spite. 
Malice brings unhappiness, so keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c. 
Be sober and industrious, ambitious to get on, 
For in life's unequal battle you must struggle hard and strong, 
In gossipiu! , or meddling, never ta..0 delight, 
Always mind your own affairs. and keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, & c. 
Beep to the right then, bow happy you will be, 
Your hart will be as light as air, your conscience pure and free, 
Behind the darkest cloud, the sun is always shining bright, 
Prosperity will crown you if you keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, & c.

" 
THE SPADE." 
As sung by Gas W ILLIAMS. 
Give me the Spade and the man who can use it ; 
A fig for your lord. and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver— the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create I 
our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons— the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade. there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done. boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
ing, 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, &c.

LITTLE NELLY RAY, 
As sting by James Mc CALE, the English Comic. 
I 
love a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown 
hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
CHORUS. 
Nelly Ray, Nely Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle ; 
Nelly Ray like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farm house, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went ; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nay Ray, &e. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass; 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her sido, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride. 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
And now we'ved named the happy day, and bow h:Ippy 
we shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or 
me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy, night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I have the 
brightest ray. 
Nelly Ray, &c.

JERSEY SAN. 
Oh! I 
was bo771 in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the. wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHOU'S. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah ! hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Thought some, they call me Sam, 
And through this work! I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can ; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For am one, &G. k 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten ; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for mint and beer, 
And smoke cigars, heigh-ho ! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sot ,e 
Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, &o. 
At inidnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing. 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, ko 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line; 
But wear our hats mid jackets, 
And appear quite masculine ; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own ; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one Sto.
