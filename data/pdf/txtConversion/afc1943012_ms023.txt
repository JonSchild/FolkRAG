Archive of American Folk Song Music February 24, 1943
On the invitation of President Horace Bond, of the Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley,
Georgian, the Archive of American Folk Song has been asked to cooperate with the
College in making recordings of an army show to be staged in connection with the Fourth
Annual Negro Folk Festival at Fort Valley, on March 5, 6, and 7. The importance of the
event may be gauged by the fact that Time magazine is scheduled to publish a prevue of
the show in its forthcoming issue.
Since the College has its own recording machine and the Library has been requested
to furnish only blank discs and cutting needles, and since this is an unusual opportunity
to forward our war-time program of recording soldiers' songs and other folkloristic and
documentary material growing out of the war, I recommend that these recordings be
acquired in accordance with the following budget:
50 12-inch discs at 80 cents $40.00
50 duplicates at $2.00 100.00
2 sapphire cutting needles 10.00
Shipping 10.00
$160.00
Laboratory handling charge 32.00
$ 192.00
