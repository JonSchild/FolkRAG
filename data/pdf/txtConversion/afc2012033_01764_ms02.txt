JB: This is Jill Breit speaking. Today is Tuesday, July 16, 2013. I’m at the Vincent Farm in Burke and I’m 
sitting at the table with Joyce Godbout who is the herdswoman here at the Vincent Farm. Joyce, I 
wonder if you could just start by telling me just a little bit about your background, where you grew up 
and how you got into working with cows? 
JG: I’m actually a native Vermonter. I moved to the state of New York when I was – early marriage. I took 
and actually started out with dairy cows growing up in 4H. My families were actually always dairy 
oriented so I always grew up with cows when my parents were married together and then they took and 
got divorced when I was about twelve so my mother ended up being the hired employee of different 
farms and so us kids took in—helped on the farms there too. And so from then I just did 4H Dairy Project 
and then I took in—my husband and I decided to stick with doing dairy together and tried farming a little 
bit together and decided that we didn’t want the overhead, overall responsibility of farming so we went 
to actually being employees and still being in the management position of it and having still our own 
cows and keeping them with the herd that we work with. 
0:01:50 
JB: And how old are you? 
JG: I am forty six. 
JB: And how old were you when you came to New York? 
JG: Um…twenty three, twenty four. 
0:02:03 
JB: So initially, just to make sure I understand…growing up when your parents were still married, they 
had a farm together in Vermont? 
JG: Um, my father actually was an employee of a farm, they didn’t actually own a farm. 
JB: Ok, but they always worked on dairy farms. And then after your parents’ divorce, you stayed with 
your mother and she continued to work out on dairy farms?

JG: Yup. 
JB: Was she a herdswoman also? 
JG: Yeah. 
JB: Ok. and would you tag along with her and learn things? 
JG: Oh yeah, most certainly. 
JB: So could you describe that a little bit before we get into your life now, sort of what that was like,, the 
routine on that Vermont dairy farm and what you can remember—sort of your feelings about the cows 
when you were young and working with your mom? 
JG: Um…it was always a typical thing, you got home from school, you would go out to the barn. Usually I 
would help feed calves and as I got older I would help milk some of the cows. And of course we would 
be in the 4H project and I always had those extra responsibilities to take care of those animals too. And, 
you know, we took—still  on the weekends—you know, I got up and helped milk cows morning and 
night with her. And just learned a little bit. You know we had the veterinary that would come and I 
would help, you know, learn, do some of that stuff—work, too. So. 
0:03:21 
JB: Were they Holsteins? 
JG: Nope. Actually most of them—all Jerseys. 
JB: And why was that, in that particular circumstance, why were they all Jerseys? 
JG: Just because that’s where we ended up, was a Jersey farm. You know, wasn’t any particular reason. 
0:03:39 
JB: So did you—did your mom have a long standing working relationship at that one particular farm? 
JG: Um, I can remember maybe, three probably. Three—you know, the first one I remember was 
actually Holsteins but we weren’t there very long, maybe a year, and then went more to the Jerseys. 
Just happened to be where the job was. 
JB: And did you like it as a kid? Did you like the cows? 
JG: Oh yeah, most definitely. 
JB: And did you think then that this was the kind of work that you would want to do? 
JG: No! When I got to be a senior in high school I said I wasn’t going to milk cows for the rest of my life! 
JB: And why was that?

JG: Had other interests. I was very music/art oriented type person. So that’s where I was gonna be, and 
was gonna go to college for that. Changed my mind, stayed home, and ended up finding out more of my 
interest was cows and now that I look back I can tell you where my real interest is. It’s not in the milking 
of cows, it’s more in the science of it. You know, the reproduction part of it.  
0:04:52 
JB: And breeding a good herd, that kind of thing? 
JG: Yeah.  
JB: So, you changed your mind, you stayed home, you continued to work with cows, you eventually got 
married. And why did you and your husband leave Vermont and go to New York and have a farm? 
JG: Opportunities just to possibly own a farm. We rent to own, just said—to see what it was like first. 
And just decided that, you know, wasn’t the avenue that we wanted. We’d already had, a portion of the 
herd was ours, so to speak it was already bought and paid for, so that’s the part of the herd we kept and 
that’s all the descendents we have now, are from those. 
0:05:35 
JB: So where was the farm that you and your husband ran? 
JG: We lived in Gouverneur, New York.  
JB: And then you just sold that farm, somebody else took it over and you took your herd? 
JG: Well, it was actually that we just rented to own so it wasn’t, you know, it was just—notice we were 
leaving and that was that. 
JB: And you decided you wanted to focus really on building a strong herd. So how did you end up 
developing a relationship here on the Vincent Farm? How did you end up here? 
JG: We worked actually at a farm previous to here for seventeen years. In Bangor, New York. And we 
ended up—that farm sold out so then we were looking for a place to go that we could still bring our own 
animals, still work together. Didn’t have any other ideas to sell out completely or go to two separate 
jobs; it just wasn’t—not even remotely possible. 
JB: So you really wanted to continue to work together and to have your own cows wherever you were. 
So that was bottom line, that had to be the case wherever you went? 
JG: Yup. and it just happened to be that Vincent Farms had an opening. The mom had just passed away 
and—and the farm was looking for a person to replace an employee that was looking to go out on his 
own into a different type of business. And they also ended up having another employee at the same 
time that were looking to go to their own farm, too. So ended up—had two openings, kind of correlated 
together, and it opened up doors for us.

0:07:15 
JB: And what is your husband’s name? 
JG: Edward. 
JB: Godbout? 
JG: Yup. 
JB: Ok, so your maiden name is something different? 
JG: Yes. 
JB: Ok, so what is your maiden name? 
JG: Way. 
JB: Way? Ok. 
JG: It’s simple. It’s Scottish! 
JB: It’s Scottish? Ok, so that’s your background, is Scottish, and you married a Frenchmen? 
JG: Yeah! 
0:07:32 
JB: And what does Ed do here at the farm? 
JG: He’s a feedsperson. 
JB: Ok, so he works in the barn with you? 
JG: Actually, he works more of the nutrition to the cows. So, I mean, lots of times I don’t see him 
throughout the day very much, except lunchtime or break. But, he’s in charge, just making sure the 
cows—the cows’ feeds are mixed properly. 
JB: So which part of the farm does he normally work on? 
JG: Um, he works with—tractor with a mixer wagon, in the bunks that have the silage, haylage, the 
grains that are in it.  
0:08:14 
JB: So do the two of you live on this farm? 
JG: Mm-hmm.  
JB: So you’re in one of the houses on the farm, here? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

JG: Yup. 
JB: Ok. 
JG: There’s actually only one house to the farm. 
JB: Oh, is that right? Oh, it’s the house right here? 
JG: Yeah, it’s right here. 
JB: Oh, right here. I’m pointing in the wrong direction, but along side where the potato cellar is that 
we’re sitting in. Ok. Well that ‘s nice, you have a very convenient walk to work then! Few feet and you’re 
in the barn! Alright, well let’s talk a little bit more about the cows, then. How does it work first of all, 
that—how do you keep your herds separate from the herd of this farm, like what’s the set up physically 
in terms of how the cows are housed and how you handle it? 
0:08:55 
JG: There really isn’t anything, physically, you know. The only thing you can tell the difference is that 
mine all have tails, the rest of the herd is docked. And I have actually physical ID with a chain with a neck 
tag on them, that’s—we have to have that purpose anyway for DHI records and for when the tester 
comes so that the ID is there. Other than that, no. 
JB: So, there are ways—you know your own cows when you’re looking at them (Joyce saying yes) but 
they mingle in with all the other cows (Yes)  on the farm here and they’re not kept separate. 
JG: No. 
0:09:37 
JB: Why do you not dock the tails on your cows, because I don’t really know what that’s all about? 
JG: Open doors! Um, well, I’ll put the theory to you that docking tails was brought about when they 
thought it would bring cows to be cleaner. That was more when freestyles were being built, the cows 
were going from tie stall to free stall. Different types of milking facilities were being built, such as a 
parallel, which means milking from the rear, so a docked tail is easier to work around versus a longer tail 
that has a switch. We keep our tails basically, I have strong beliefs that cows should have a tail! Plus, we 
also show cows and if you show a cow it’s frowned upon usually if she has no tail. 
JB: Ok, so that’s part of the reason for that. Now, in terms of your knowledge of the science of breeding 
and herds, is this acquired on the job, or did you at some point go off for some sort of training or degree 
in this? 
JG: I’ve done a lot of workshops, conferences….learning a lot from veterinarians that, you know—a lot of 
them are very willing to teach you even more, even just ask a simple question to do with it. That’s 
probably—and just learning over time. Didn’t go to any special schooling for it. You know, the 
cooperative extension’s very good about offering, or Pro Dairy’s very good about offering classes about

them. And sometimes they’re good just to get a refresher course, even if you did it ten years ago just do 
it again because there might be something new that’s come out, you know. Opens your eyes. 
0:11:35 
JB: Now given the rhythm of work on the farm, do you mostly have to take those kinds of courses in the 
winter when work is a little less? 
JG: That’s usually when they’re offered, yes. 
0:11:45 
JB: So what are you striving for, with the herd? In terms of being a herdswoman, and being interested in 
the breeding, what kinds things are you breeding for? 
JG: Healthy cows. Happy, healthy cows! Just, you’re always striving to keep them healthy, no matter 
what. I mean, this hot weather throws you a curve so you’re trying to make sure they stay comfortable 
the best you can. You know cold weather, extreme cold weather, same thing. You’re always battling 
different diseases, you know, and there’s always different things you’ve gotta do to prevent them the 
best that you can. 
JB: And what are you doing right now in this extreme heat to try to keep the cows more comfortable? 
JG: Making sure that the fans are running, if you need to lower the curtains more they get lowered; right 
now they are the lowest they can be, obviously. Hopefully we won’t see cows that’ll be panting heavily, 
if they do, then yeah, we might need to have to consider something else. Sprinkling water, which we’ve 
never had to do, but I’m not saying it couldn’t be done. Making sure their water sources are clean so 
they’re wanting to go drink, and you know, that the barn—that their gates are where they’re supposed 
to be so they’re not shut off, making sure the windows are open where they can be for calves or young 
stock. Adding a fan or two more if we need to,  you know. Best we can do. 
0:13:21 
JB: Now when I arrived at the farm and I asked you how you were doing, you said terrible! And that’s 
because it’s so hot, right, that’s what you were suggesting. You’re suffering too in the barn right now. 
JG: Yup. 
JB: And you’ve improvised your work outfit too. 
JG: Most definitely! 
JB: So why don’t you, for the sake of our listeners, describe what you were telling me when I got here 
about what you’ve decided in the last couple of days as far as working? 
JG: My normal attire to wear would be coveralls, and I can wear those pretty much until the 
temperature changes to about seventy degrees and then I might wear—normally I would just wear 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
6
pants or a shirt underneath that so that when I leave the barn, I take the coveralls off, I’m done. The last 
few days, I’ve had to improvise a little bit. Actually in the last two weeks I’ve improvised, I’ve gone to 
wearing bib overalls with a tank top and that was working pretty good. Well, now the temperature has 
reached 85 degrees and our parlour temperature is 85 degrees plus with the cows that are in it to be 
milked. So I have decided to change my attire to a tank top, shorts that I can wear to my knees to keep 
at least my upper legs covered for the stalls that I milk in, and cut my old pair of boots off down to the 
ankles so that it exposes at least the lower part of my legs, and took my old apron and cut it down so it 
took off about—about eight inches off the bottom so it’s not as long as it normally would be. So…it’s 
made it a little more comfortable this morning.  
0:15:03 
JB: Yeah. And you were also describing having to clean out some machinery yesterday, and what was the 
situation there? You were talking about with the compressor running, it gets a hundred and twenty 
degrees? 
JG: Yeah, last night, I decided, I was washing the machines up, and I decided—I was standing in the milk 
house where the floor is clean and I took my shoes and socks off and washed machines in bare feet! 
JB: Because you said it can get a hundred and twenty degrees! 
JG: Because it was getting a hundred and twenty degrees, yes. 
0:15:33 
JB: Oh my goodness, yeah, so this is tough. Now, is this typical of the summer weather, or is this a hotter 
than usual summer? 
JG: No, this is hotter than normal. You know, we might get a few days of eighty degrees…we might, very 
seldom, a day or two of ninety degrees, but the humidity hasn’t been as high as it is right now, the 
humidity has been—it’s what makes the temperature tough, for us anyways. We’re not used to it. And 
there’s a few days it can be hard to breathe, you know.  
JB: Do you ever feel like you’re dizzy or gonna keel over from the heat? 
JG: Oh  yeah, most certainly. When it’s hardest is when you’re in the parlour milking, you know, you kind 
of have to stop and recollect yourself just to get a drink and start in again.  
0:16:28 
JB: Well, take us through a typical day for you, this time of year. Let’s say here we are, in July, what is 
your workday like? 
JG: Um, well, I started out at—the alarm goes off at ten minutes to four, I’m in the barn usually about 
five, seven minutes after four o’clock. I usually set up the machines to start milking in the parlour at four 
thirty and usually I can get started about twenty after. And then I start milking the cows and my prep 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

person comes in and joins me at four thirty, so I usually have the first set on. And this saves him having 
to be in a half hour earlier. And then it takes us until about eight o’clock to get all the cows milked in the 
morning. When I shut down in the morning from the morning’s milking then I usually have my calves to 
feed and usually I’ll have six to eight calves to feed on the most. That means just the Jerseys because 
that’s all I feed, the others are fed by the other feedsperson or the other calf person. From then we take 
in—usually from feeding calves, then I usually end up—I’ve got fresh cows to take care of, to doing what 
we call the Kamar check, or heat observation time, doing dry cow shots, typically—it depends what day 
of the week it is, Monday—that’s the dry cow day shots to do. Fresh cows can happen any day of the 
week, any time of the day. And so if there’s fresh cows that have to be brought in, they’re brought up 
from the outside paddock in the summertime. And then we bring in the calves and the calf has to be fed 
its colostrum. And I’ll make sure all that’s done so we don’t have to do it in the afternoon, but the 
quicker the calf gets colostrum the better. And usually I can be done about ten thirty, eleven o’clock, 
with most of my herdsperson work to do. And then I usually go in between chores and don’t have to 
come back out until three o’clock in the afternoon. I usually will sneak a nap in the course! Lately, 
because we’ve had a change of different employees of different schedules and stuff, I usually’ll have to 
milk straight through until about seven o’clock or seven thirty at night. It—you know, usually—normally, 
my normal job is done at five o’clock. Somebody comes in and relieves me, but there’s another person 
that comes in later in the day so it kind of bumps his day from say ten to seven and this would be his 
normal hours. But we’ve had to juggle quite a bit here lately just because of employee changings around 
and so we’re looking for a new person right now to help fill in. 
0:19:41 
JB: And, do you work seven days a week? 
JG: Nope, nope. My days usually off are every other Sunday, and I work every Saturday morning. So 
what does that mean, it means I have Saturday afternoon off every other week and day and a half off 
the opposite. And you know, we’ve had to juggle that some a little bit just because of the employee 
change, but usually like—during the week, I can get an extra afternoon off or something. So it depends 
what we’ve got for extra help. 
JB: Right, right now you’re squeezed. 
JG: And when it was raining so bad, the other guys didn’t have work to do, so that was kind of time to 
nab—to give somebody else time off kind of thing. 
JB: Right, they couldn’t be out in the fields with the tractors or anything, so they could come in the barn 
and help you. 
JG: Yup. 
0:20:40 
JB: So, generally though, on a typical day, your free time is say from ten thirty to three. So when do you 
eat? Like when’s breakfast, lunch, and dinner? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

JG: Breakfast for me is actually usually a package of crackers, pop tarts, something quick like that, and 
I’m usually nibbling on it during milking. Usually it’s always something I can handle without fingers 
basically, you know, be able to take a bite off from it and keep going. That’s my typical breakfast time. 
And then lunch is usually right at noon because my husband comes in at noon, and he’s in there from 
noon to one and so then supper usually happens after milking is done. I might grab a snack out the door, 
but… 
JB: But dinner would be typically, if you’re relieved at five, then you might have dinner by five thirty? 
JG: Dinner actually wouldn’t happen until six because Ed wouldn’t come in until six, so…but typically on 
the average our supper is  usually around seven/seven thirty even, still. One way or the other. You know, 
this time of the year you usually cook on the grill because it’s hot inside, or in the winter time if I know 
I’m milking definitely the whole milking at night I usually will use the crock pot a lot. So then it’s all ready 
and I don’t have to worry about cooking when I go it. 
0:22:02 
JB: Right, and then you must go to bed early, because you get up at ten of four? 
JG: Yes and no! Remember, I usually sneak that afternoon nap in there, there is a reason for it! Generally 
my days are usually nine o’clock, and oftentimes will see ten before I lay down. This time of year it’s not 
hard. I’m usually only a six hours sleeper, and—but yeah, usually grab that extra nap, that half hour nap 
in the middle of the day. And I do a lot of community service, so I usually do a fair amount of meetings in 
a month, so you know, it’s…gotta keep going! 
0:22:47 
JB: So what kind of community service do you do? 
JG: I work with Franklin County Dairy Princess Program, I’m on their committee for that. So there’s a lot 
of responsibility of we have a court of seventeen, and that’s including the Princess and the ambassadors. 
And so it’s making sure that they’ve all got a ride to an event they need to be at, or being supervision, 
because they have to be supervised. And they don’t like it to be called “being supervised,” they’re all ten 
years and older, but they still have to be! I don’t like the word use of supervise, but anyway…. 
JB: Chaperoned! 
JG: Chaperoned, yeah, whatever, it’s just—protected, protected is more, I like to think that they keep 
them protected! You know, we have a lot of crazy people out there! I’m a 4H Dairy Leader too, and so 
we have a club of thirteen members. I don’t have sole responsibility but I am a project leader for that. 
And showing cows…I’m part of the Board of Directors for Franklin County and the 4H program Advisory 
Committee. I think that’s it. 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

JB: That’s a lot! That’s a lot. But it sounds like—based on what you’re choosing to do for work, and what 
you choose to do for community service, it sounds like you do in fact love this farming lifestyle, is that 
fair to say? 
JG: Oh yeah, most definitely. 
JB: So you’re not thinking about switching to some other line of work? 
JG: No. No, definitely not.  
0:24:35 
JB: I didn’t ask you , do you have any children? 
JG: Oh yeah. 
JB: Ok, well let’s talk about your kids! 
JG: Let me see, I have—my youngest is at home, and he’s thirteen and a half, almost fourteen, in about a 
month and a half he’ll be fourteen. He’s been the only grandchild with red hair! 
JB: It’s the Scotsman coming through! 
JG: Yeah! Actually they say some French too, believe it or not, the funny part about it is, both Eddie’s 
and my grandmothers—great grandmas—both had red hair. Very interesting. So he helps out a little bit 
on the farm, usually he’s a big calf chore person if I’m really busy, if I have a night meeting, does night 
chores—he does the calves for me lately. So he’s been a real big help, learning and doing that. My 
daughter is away, actually she lives in Sharon Springs, just graduated this spring from Cobleskill, which is 
also an agriculture related college. She graduated with a four year degree with Ag/Business 
Management. And she’s landed a job in Sharon Springs with Lee’s Publications, which publishes a lot of 
different newspapers, one of them being Country Folks. So far, loves her job! 
JB: So she’s working in the—writing about agriculture. 
JG: Actually, she’s doing the desk job, doing the sales part of it, believe it or not. 
JB: Interesting. 
JG: Part of her job is to make sure she gets sales and advertisements for the newspaper. 
JB: But because she understands the industry, she’s able to talk to people? 
JG: Exactly, and she deals a lot actually with Ohio—even though it’s out of New York, she deals with a 
section of Ohio, part of it. Because they have different—I think there’s three different regions to the 
newspaper, so yeah. She’s doing that part and she’s actually going to be going to Ohio in August as a 
Farm Show Trade salesperson. So that’s part of her responsibility she has to do twice a year. She’s 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
10
looking forward to it, she’s a very people-oriented person. Just a very bubbly type person. So, everybody 
loves her! 
JB: Well, she’s in the right line of work then, for sure! Yeah, that’s great. 
JG: And my oldest is actually my nephew—I raised him since he was a baby. So he— 
[Phone rings] 
JB: Let’s pause… 
[Resumed] 
0:27:29 
JB: Ok, so when we paused the tape here, you were talking about your oldest. 
JG: My oldest I’ve raised since he was a baby, and he’s actually my nephew but we still call him our son, 
and he’s living at home, and does his thing, works his jobs, and usually works—occasionally a few 
hourshere and there at the farm too, just—he’s been helping out some, so, it’s been working out. 
JB: How old is he? 
JG: He will be twenty seven this fall. 
JB: Okay, alright, great. But he’s not one in the family who sounds like he necessarily wants to make a 
career of dairy? 
JG: I would say, no, no, he’s managed to stay some working on the farm just because that’s extra income 
for him. 
0:28:22 
JB: Alright, let’s go back to the cows. Well, before we do that, let me just ask you quickly, in terms of 
your work routine, you’ve described a typical July day. Is that pretty consistently what your routine is 
like throughout the year, or would it be different in say, January? 
JG: That’s pretty typical what it would be. All through the—actually, all year long. I mean, the other 
things I would have to do would be help move heifers around, that’s done, you know, in the spring, 
moving them out to pastures and etcetera, but we still have to move around calves and heifers from 
different age groups in the barns. And that stuff. It’s help filling in where I might be needed, I don’t do 
much out in the fields. I have helped drive tractor for picking stones and that stuff, but that’s pretty 
typical, what I do.  
JB: Ok, so let’s talk about the actual breeding of the herd, and a little bit more about that. First of all, 
what is the composition of your herd? It’s a mix of Holsteins, and Jerseys, is it? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
11
JG: We’re a—majority of them are Holsteins, and there’s about thirty of them are Jerseys, then we have 
some red and whites; they’re purebred red and whites. And there is a small portion of the herd that are 
crossbreeds. I mean they’re Jersey-Holsteins, there’s a few Norwegian Jersey-Holstein crosses, which is 
three different generations of the breeding to get the crosses in. Just because that’s what’s 
recommended to breed them. 
JB: And, of the total herd, how many of the cows are yours? Is your own herd? 
JG: There’s actually thirty two of them that are mine, that are Jerseys and the red and whites, and 
they’re milking. And then I have twenty five young stock, right now. 
JB: That are not Jerseys or red and whites? 
JG: Those are Jerseys and red and whites, too. 
JB: Oh, they are, ok. So that’s what your preferences is personally, for your herd. 
JG: yes. 
0:30:23.  
JB: And why is that? 
JG: Hmm. I’ve grown up with Jerseys, gotten to really know their personalities, their breed 
characteristics. They’re obviously a smaller type cow, I’m a smaller type person! My daughter got the 
red and whites because she wanted a red and white Holstein, had the opportunity to buy it from 
another person that also showed cows, another young man that was going off to college; he had one 
left and so he had offered her to buy one and she raised her own money and purchased that animal too, 
and so now the red and whites that we have, the most of them came from that one cow. We had one 
other red and white cow from our original herd, there’re offsprings from that one cow, there’s actually 
two separate red and white cow families. But they’re all related one way or another. So…and I don’t 
know, I’ve just grown up with the Jerseys and that’s what I like. You know, no particular reason being 
income wise, or better fats, or anything like that, it’s just….I like the cow, personality wise.

JB: And you started by saying that your objective in terms of the herd is just to make sure they’re happy 
and healthy. Are there other reasons, though, or other goals as well? That’s your overarching goal, but 
are you trying to breed for better production or…? 
JG: I mean, it’s definitely…confirmation is a big plus with me because of showing them. We have to 
strive to actually keep our breeding… for the udder composites a plus side to the production on the 
Holsteins probably, really being pushed a little bit more than on the Jerseys; the Jerseys tend to get—
they get deeper uddered if you’ve gotten more production into them. Sure, I mean, we would like to 
have a herd of twenty thousand pounds of milk, but in order to make that milk you’ve gotta have the 
capacity in the udders, they tend to end up being deeper. In this type of parlor a deeper udder, they

don’t stay in the herd long enough to even think about that kind of goal. So I mean right now, being at a 
sixteen to seventeen thousand herd average I’m satisfied as long as I can keep my udders up there, and 
so that’s what I strive for when I breed. 
0:33:08 
JB: I actually don’t know what it means to say, “a deeper under.” What does that mean? 
JG: Ok, um, if their udder is down to their knees or their hocks, or lower, that’s pretty deep. You know, 
do I have a couple in the herd that are deep uddered, yes. Will that be what will cull them first, yes. Just 
because it isn’t safe, you could end up having a teat get cut off, or stepped on very easily. They don’t, 
when they get up into our parlour, because it’s a step up of seventeen inches, they actually will drag 
their udder up on it so you can get a lot of abrasion. And the cow is trying to be careful with her udder, 
being aware that it is bigger, she’s gonna take her time to get up there. Which is okay, but we also don’t 
want to take that chance of her slipping and falling and getting in the udder, too. 
JB: So it’s a disadvantage in this particular set up here, to have deep uddered cows? 
JG: It is, it is. 
JB: And those are the ones you’re saying that don’t stay in the herd very long, because they don’t work 
well in this particular parlour. 
JG: Typically I’d like to see a ten year old cow be in a herd….well, now I think it’s probably been…well, 
my oldest is right now a seven, which isn’t too bad. But I’d like to see a ten year old cow. But if you have 
a ten year old cow you’d like to see her udder be ideal anyway, you know, so it’s…obviously if they get to 
be five years old and the udder is starting to get on the deep side you’d better be thinking about she’s 
gonna be in your cull count the next time around. Just because, you know, it’s just not beneficial to 
leave her in the herd. 
0:34:53 
JB: So how often do you do a cull count in the herd? 
JG: Actually, you’re always looking and keeping an eye on cull cows. Sometimes you’re using those cull 
cows as extra income when you need it, but you’re always keeping an eye on somebody that’s—I’ll say a 
hazard to keep in the herd, walking around lame is not safe just for a beef cow, so to speak, because 
you’ve gotta make sure they’re safely on the beef truck. They’re frowned upon now, if you’re sending 
them there extremely lame. Lame cows will also lose weight, so then you’ll lose that benefit of weight in 
the beef market. Because they’re sold by pounds. And the cow that, you know, might all of a sudden 
abort a calf could be another reason that she’s culled out and if she’s out there already so many days of 
milk, you may not decide to breed her back, you may just cull her instead. So it’s always, always open 
to….when you’re thinking about culling cows. You heard the conversation! (referring to an earlier phone 
conversation she’d had with the farm’s owner.)

JB: Right, you don’t like 150, I think you said! 
JG: Yeah. 
JB: So is that a cranky cow, or you don’t like her for some other reason? 
JG: Nope, she has udder trouble, related to mastitis. And is just not getting any better, and I don’t see a 
prognosis for her to be better. She was a problem last year, so it’s…you know, she is a fresher cow, so 
you’re kind of like, well, you’d like to keep her because it’s more milk in the tank right now, but really, is 
she gonna be helping us in the long run? She’s costing us time right now, because we’re taking that 
extra time with her. And in this heat, mastitis can cause a lot of trouble, environmentally, mastitis…. 
JB: Can it spread to the other cows? 
JG: Certain types of mastitis, sure.  
0:37:04 
JB: Now when you cull cows, are they going to different places, some of the go to the meat market, 
some of them go to other people who want to have a cow for whatever reason, or, where do they go 
when you cull them? 
JG: Our cull cows actually go right to commission sales, which is the beef market….where other people—
buyers will come in to buy beef. We don’t have any others that go anywhere else. 
0:37:31 
JB: So, are you the one who makes all the decisions about the entire herd, and who stays/who goes, 
who’s breeding, who’s not breeding…are you the mastermind behind the herd plan? 
JG: I have a strong decision in it, but I don’t make the overall decision to it. I definitely help make the 
decisions. You know, I’m the one—yes, that works in with the cows, that needs to see those things to 
point them out to David and let him know. You know, and using our records, pinpointing cows that way 
too. Letting us know if somebody’s cell count is way out of whack and needs to be addressed and figure 
out why and that helps.  
0:38:17 
JB: What kind of record keeping do you do to keep track of the herd? How do you keep records on the 
cows? 
JG: We have breeding records, charts, we have DHI records; it’s just Dairy Herd Improvement or Dairy 
One named out of Ithaca, New York, does our overall computer generated records. My husband and I do 
one that’s on our farm computer, we just solely use it for our own—more of a backup if we ever had to 
have, and it keeps our own herd into it. More of its own information to it…trying to think what else. The 
breeding wheel in the barn holds a lot of the daily information so it’s right there to use, so I don’t have 
to go to the books to use…my calendar. My calendar’s my bible, because my calendar contains all of my 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

fresh dates, a little bit of notes that I need here or there pertaining to calving difficulties, to the sex of 
the calves, to –I write down a vaccine on a certain day, that’s my bible. 
0:39:43 
JB: And what do you find most challenging about the work? What is the most challenging part of being 
responsible for the herd and managing the breeding and so forth? 
JG: Hm. I don’t know! 
JB: Do you like it all? 
JG: Oh yeah, like all of it! I really don’t know as I have any…I guess if anything, if it got down to it, it 
would probably be working with that difficult cow. That’s probably the one, you know…if I have an 
injured cow, injury…injured udder is usually the difficult—most difficult thing. But other than that—
there’s a ways around handling whatever you have problems with, you know. My sidekick Kevin that 
helps me to, or any of the guys if I need help, are more than willing to help me. So it isn’t… 
0:40:44 
JB: You are not—in fact, you mentioned this earlier - -  not a very tall person. You’re petite, is how you’d 
be described. Have you ever been frightened by a cow? 
JG: Yup! I ‘d be lying! 
JB: And what kind of circumstance would that be? 
JG: Let’s see, uh…cow that acts like a bull! Last summer I was knocked down by a heifer in a pasture, saw 
that she was having a weird or strange behavior, being out in the pasture, and I was near the fence 
line….and she started running and I was about eight feet from the fence, and I got to the fence 
line….keeping in mind it was a barbed wire fence, four strands…I remember hitting her with my metal 
clipboard and somehow I got on the other side of the fence, but I don’t know how! Did she bump me 
over it, no, I know I climbed over it, that’s what my intent was to do, but from there I don’t remember 
anything. That’s how much scared I got, I don’t—I cleared the fence, I didn’t get scratched or anything; I 
don’t know if I went over it or under it, can’t tell you! Just got to the other side, that’s all I remember. 
JB: So what happened to that heifer? 
JG: She’s still in the herd, she’s actually being milked now, she’s on her—just fresh for a second 
lactation. Yes, I had to watch her last year…she took in—I would always have to watch out for her out in 
the free stall, make sure she’s always on the opposite side and I’m on the other side, know where she is 
at all times. And she’s fresh and again, this time, just barely. She has tried once already this year to come 
at me, and I got under the dividers in the stalls and got away from her, had to have help to get out of the 
free stall because she was standing at the end of the stalls….and needless to say, she hasn’t---somebody 
clobbered her since then, and hasn’t bothered anybody. Would I trust her now? No! No. 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033

0:43:07 
JB: So would you consider culling her for that reason, just because of that uncertainty? 
JG: Most certainly it’s been talked about, but as long as I’m able to still steer clear of her, hopefully there 
isn’t some moment that I forget and she makes some bad error and… 
JB: So does it seem like she’s targeting you in particular, or is she this way with everybody on the farm? 
JG: She’s bothered one other employee, but not anybody else, so that’s…why, who knows. 
JB: Are there other instances where cows frightened you, or possibly even injured you? 
JG: Oh yeah, actually had one two years ago, we did sell her, because she did pretty near get me. And 
she was bothering more than one person, and she had other strikes against her, like being a light 
quartered –or almost three-titted, I mean,  being a  slow hard milker, and being a  first calf heifer…so 
there was three strikes against her and the fourth one made it that she almost nailed me, so that did her 
in. I’ve had—there’s just a few here and there, and there’s one other cow that we have in the herd, 
she’s one that you don’t get near her head zone, so to speak….and she’s fine. Walk by her, close by her, 
she’ll try to play tag with you, but other than that it’s pretty much…we have one other heifer right now 
that actually is a bred heifer out in the pasture, that everybody has witnessed and seen—I told them 
that she would bother me, and she got out, and I didn’t realize it was her, and she did: she pinned me 
into the fence post. But luckily Eddie was right there and she backed off, but I got a few bruises out of 
that one. 
0:45:01 
JB: How about the other physical aspects of this work, you look pretty darn strong to me! Is it hard, 
physically, to do this work? 
JG: I don’t think of it that way. Maybe it is, I just don’t think of it that way. 
JB: So it’s comfortable enough for you. 
JG: Yeah, I think so. You know, I’m getting older—my back’s starting to tell me. I don’t think of it that 
way…obviously I’m the only woman on the farm, but, you know… 
JB: So you’re well suited for this. Um, in terms of thinking about people listening to this interview in the 
future, and I know that I’m using your very precious free time here to talk to you about all of this: 
thinking about people listening, what would you like them to know or understand about the work you 
do that I haven’t asked you about already? You know, if you were gonna ask the questions of somebody 
doing the work and describe for somebody who’s maybe in the city and knows nothing about this kind 
of work, what do you want them to understand about the work? 
0:46:11 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
16
JG: Cows can be—I wouldn’t say the word “fun” to work with, but cows can be a learning experience 
and can teach you a lot, too. And…I mean, they just—they can be enjoyable to work with I guess, that’s 
probably, you know, given the chance, a lot of people don’t have a—some people don’t have a 
consideration to a cow as being an animal that can understand, but they can. And I have learned a lot, 
you know, just with animal behavior, you know, as I’ve gotten older. Just need to think of—think of a 
cow as not just something that gives milk and eats and has to have their manure taken away, because 
that’s not all there is to it.  
JB: Do you recognize different personalities in the cows? 
JG: Oh yeah, most definitely. Most definitely.  
JB: I know there are some cows you’ve become very attached to. 
JG: Oh yeah, that too. Yeah, that too. I just had my nine year old Jersey put down last winter, and just 
decided I wasn’t gonna breed her anymore, yeah…. 
0:47:34 
JB: Because I guess that’s the other thing, we talked about culls going up to the meat market, but some 
cows just live out their lives here on the farm, and some cows end up being put down here. 
JG: Yeah, yeah, you do. And we’ve got one Holstein actually, she’s…I think if I looked her up—I think 
she’s probably twelve years old, you wouldn’t know it, and she is my favorite of the Holsteins just 
because when I first come here, she got her leg caught in the stanchions, so she tore the tissues on her 
knee and needed a lot of TLC, a lot of first aid care…not knowing the cows at all in the herd, we’d given 
her the “box style care” as we call it for about six to eight weeks and took care of her wound. Could do 
anything I wanted with that cow, and her name is Babe, and I can do anything I want with her. Could 
they be all like that, no. And would have taken one miserable cow to be—that would have been a 
different story or a different outcome, who knows, you know, but she was willing for me to take care of 
her and never got any infection into it, which we should have, as bad as it was. I’m pretty sure if I looked 
her up, she’s probably twelve years old; I know she was at least five when I came.  
0:49:02 
JB: And do all the cows have names, or only the ones that you develop a particular relationship with? 
JG: You’ve got some with nicknames, but all the Jerseys and the red and whites do have a name, they’re 
all registered. And they have to have a name given to them. But…we’ve got, you know, the ones out in 
the herd that are just—and you give them a nickname. There’s one that stays “Fatty” all year long! Or 
the one undesirable name that we don’t want to call them but everyone knows who she is! 
0:49:39 
JB: Now do you have an inseminator come for the cows, or do you bring bulls in? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
17
JG: Yes, we have an artificial inseminator that does breed the cows; once the heifers are freshened for 
the first time, then the cows are exposed to the breeder for artificial insemination. All of the Holsteins 
are actually bred with a Jersey bull, they’re actually grouped out on the pasture; actually, all year round. 
For those just for calving purposes, but all the registered stock is bred with artificial insemination.  
JB: And how often does it happen that when a cow is giving birth to a calf things go wrong and you have 
to—either you have to intervene or you have to bring a vet in? 
JG: Um, the cow, if she has a large calf for the size of her pelvis area, or the calf has gotten into the 
wrong position, that’s when we usually—we’ll usually call the vet if I can’t get it. Obviously because of 
my small size, often I have to call the vet just because of that purpose and…my husband will usually try 
to help me if I know what’s wrong, because he’s a lot bigger than I am to be able to pull the calf up into 
the right position if need be; but lots of times I call the vet for wrong position.  
JB: But you feel comfortable if it’s something that you can manage with your size… 
JG: If I can manage it, yeah. 
JB: You feel comfortable reaching in there and repositioning the calf? 
JG: Most certainly, you know, usually if its coming backwards, that’s usually not a problem; twins are 
what causes your troubles sometimes, one’s tangled up with the other one. Sometimes you don’t know 
if you have a front foot and a back foot of two different calves. Sometimes the head, even though the 
calf is coming in the forward position, the head could be back; those, I usually can’t get, even with 
Eddie’s help. Usually we end up calling the vet for those. Upside down and backwards, those are hard 
for me to turn, even with help. I’m trying to think what else I’ve run into. I’m trying to think. That’s 
pretty much the ones that I’ve really had problems with. Heifer calving, sometimes we’ll have an 
extremely large calf, and usually she’s been at it too long, and then the pelvis area—vagina—gets dry. So 
there’s not much lubrication for the calf to come out. I’ve been in a few instances, not here at the 
Vincent Farms, but where I have actually had to make an incision on the vulva to allow more room for a 
calf to come out. And been successful at it. 
JB: So you learned on the job doing this, like just by years of being at farms, and you’ve just learned how 
to do this? 
JG: Yeah. Well, we’ll work with a vet and stuff, you know, if we’ve had to call in a vet to do prolapsed 
uterus…I’ve been shown how to actually sew up a cow if I think she’s going to prolapse and be able to 
sew her up before the vet gets there to have to do anything further. 
0:53:17 
JB: And how old is a cow usually, the first time it’s bred? 
JG: They average about, twenty months old, yeah about twenty to twenty one—that’s wrong. That’s 
wrong. It’s actually, she’s calving at twenty one months old, sorry. They’re actually being bred anywhere 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
18
from twelve to fifteen months old. And a lot matters on their weight, of the animals, because obviously 
you have the difference between an Holstein and a Jersey and then what throws that off a little bit more 
is the crossbreeds, because you can’t really—you might have a heifer that’s twelve months old that’s not 
quite heavy enough to breed her, so you’ll wait a little bit. Couple months. A heifer that’s at twelve 
months old and definitely heavier or fatter, you want to get her services, because by the time she’s 
fifteen months old, they end up having more problems breeding back.  
JB: And do they get bred once a year thereafter? 
JG: It’s on the average, about thirteen months calving interval. It’s roughly thirteen and a half, thirteen 
point two if you want to be exact! 
0:54:36 
JB: Are there many women on farms around here doing what you do? You’re the only woman on this 
farm, what would you say about women doing this kind of work in general right now in the North 
Country on dairy farms? Are there many of you? 
JG: A lot of them are wives on the farms. I can’t think of anybody that’s actually a hired herdsperson that 
I know of. A lot of them are just wives that I know of. And, you know, they all help on the farm in some 
aspect of the farm but I can’t say as I know anybody that’s a woman herdsperson. 
JB: And are there, besides you, are there other herdspeople--hired herdspeople—males, then, ifyou 
don’t know any females, who are specialists like you who get hired to manage herds and are not 
necessarily part of the family that runs the farm? In other words, do you have professional peers, I guess 
that’s what I’m asking. 
JG: Not that I can think of, anyway. 
0:55:40 
JB: Have you kept in touch at all with what’s happening with dairy farming in Vermont? 
JG: All the time!  
JB: Because you still have family there… 
JG: Yeah, yeah. 
JB: Do you think it’s comparable? Do you think things are different in New York than they are in Vermont 
in General? 
JG: Um, I mean, they have to deal with more of the hilling, doing crops on hills, and that stuff. They’re 
striving just like we are, I don’t think there’s any different…They have hired help problems just like we 
do, you know. I think they just—this is comparable. 
JB: And what part of Vermont did you come from? 
Dairy Farm Workers in New  York's North Country, afc2012/033
19
JG: It’d be northern Vermont. 
JB: The Northeast Kingdom? 
JG: Actually, it’s Richford. Ed’s from Richford, I was more from the Burlington area, I graduated from 
Colchester. So, but I’ve lived from one end of the state to the other, where Eddie was—just Richford.  
0:56:42 
JB: I think I’ve covered everything I wanted to cover. Are you optimistic about farming, as an industry 
going forward? 
JG: Yeah. That’s probably putting it nicely. We’d like to see us be able to progress, go farther, get into 
the big technology, you know we’ve even thought about doing robotic milking…just so that we could 
eliminate maybe that extra need for a hired help to milk cows. Anything—you know, put more money in 
the bank would be nice, you know, just be able to—I don’t want to say live like the rest of the world, 
but, that’ll probably never happen but we can always think that, right? 
JB: Right. 
JG: I can’t think of anything else. 
JB: But in general, you think that people will continue to run dairy farms here and that will continue to 
be part of the economy here? 
JG: It’d have to be, it’s the only thing that makes food in this world! You’re talking to a Dairy Princess 
Committee person! That’s drilled into us all the time! Milk makes what? 
JB: Cheese! Which I love! 
JG: Milk, and yogurt, the three necessary things that everybody needs everyday!  
JB: Alright, fair enough, that sounds good! Ok, well thank you Joyce, I appreciate this very much. 
JG: You’re welcome.
