It is a 
well known fact, that Messrs. JonNsoN AND BRUNO 
are the most versatile song and dance arsists at present in the 
profession. 
Their business and style are not only original, but 
there is a quiet finesse about every thing they do which at 
once commands the admiration and applause of their auditors. 
This is not merely the assertion of an individual, but the opin-
ion 
of thousands who have witnessed 
their 
performance. 
Their acts are unique, sparkling, and brimful of quiet wit and 
humor, without the slightest tinge of vulgarity. 
Their success 
in the principal cities of the United States is entirely without 
precedent, and in most instances, they have fairly taken the 
audience by storm. 
The linguistic powers of Mr. Bruno are 
truly wonderful, he speaking-:and sinning correctly in seven dif-
ferent languages, in wh;.ch he is ably assisted by his partner. 
They are good singers, fine grotesque dancers, and were the 
first to introduce feats of contortion in song and dance. 
A 
visit to the theatre at which they are playing will fully substan-
tiate the above. 
Respectfully Yours, 
A. J. DICK.

JUST FROM TENNESSEE. 
Original by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left oar homes to have some recreation; 
Greatly delighted we will be, 
If we can only gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them there a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, 'deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
Because the boys have left the old plantation. 
When moon-light streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twas then the old man sat the banjo Iinging; 
The darkies used to gather round the door, 
And mass:1 too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old ho:r.e, 
For it is the happiest spot in all theination 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we are going to try 
To show the style down on the old plantation.

BARNEY THE BOLD. 
Written for BARNET W ILLIAMS, BY MR. GUEST. 
Should the mind be over-burdened with sorrows or care, 
Should Fortune betray us, or Friendship turn cold, 
What can turn into laughter the groans of despair, 
Like the wit and and the jestures of Barney the bold; 
With his toe and his heel, and a 
twirl of his stick, 
He'll bate the blue devils at once to ould nick 
Oh Comedy laughs in each glance of his eye, 
And his brogue it is sweeter than mountains poteen 
To match him for humor, in vain ye may try, 
Whilst night follows morning, and noon comes between; 
And " Barney, bold Barney," cry thousands with joy, 
" 
Is the raal spalpane, is our own Irish boy! " 
Come watch him, ye actors, come one and come all! 
How dull is your wit, and heavy your heels, 
Your efforts are great, but your acting is small, 
And Barney's the boy, all your humbug reveals I 
In the wide world he has not equal in that, 
For Paddy is Barney, and Barney is Pat! 
PATHETIC BALLAD. 
Original by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
If you will listen to us, we will sing you a 
verse, 
And when we feel better, we never feel worse; 
Some people do say, we were born too young. 
And if we are shot, w&will never be hung. 
There was a 
young man, from Leavenworth town, 
And when he was standing he never sat down; 
He had a 
voice like a 
saw mill, and a 
head like a 
calf, 
And when he was crying, he never would laugh. 
There was a 
young woman from Kalamazoo, 
Her eyes they were blonde, and her hair it was blue; 
If she had not been white, she would have been black, 
And the hump of starvation was stuck on her back. 
We never stand still when we are walking around, 
And when we are up in the air, we are not on the ground; 
And when we feel better, we never feel sick, 
And if you paste together, we never will stick.

Gwine to take de Tickets at de Gate, 
As sung by JOHNSON AND BBAJNO. 
Oh my soul, my soul, Fin a 
going for to rest, 
In the arms of the angel Gabriel; 
And I 
climb on de hill, and I 
looked to de West, 
And I 
cross over Jordan to de Lamb; 
And I 
sit me down in de old arm chair, 
Oh brethren, I'll never tire ; 
Oh Satan may sneeze, but I'll take my ease, 
And I'll warm myself at the holy fire. 
CHORUS. 
For we'll dance, (
Break) 
And we'll shout, (Break) 
And we'll rise up so early in de morn; 
Den we will rise, and rub our sleepy eyes, 
When a 
Gabriel am blowing his horn. 
Oh we shan't weep long, when we're going to leave 
So we'll pack up our band box, and we'll go; 
Oh me brudder I'm a 
thinking, and dont you ever grieve 
For we's gwine up to glory very slow; 
And we'll eat our meals three times a 
day, 
And you'll bet your life we won't be late; 
Oh we'll have lots a 
fun, when you and my brudder come, 
For we's gwine to take de tickets at de gate. 
For we'll dance, &c. 
THE PAR EX, NIGS, 
Dedicated to JOHNSON AND BRUNO BY JAMES F. 
DOOLZY. 
Behold before you here to-night, two double-breasted tnokes; 
We guarantee to cure the blues, and we'll prove that we're 
no hoax; 
We'll do our best to please you, if we dislocate our necks; 
Observe us get our work in, then you'll gamble we're 
Par Ex. 
CHORUS. 
If we watch the capering of these gents, (
Break) 
We know you'll say that we're immense; (
Break) 
Just watch us while we sift around, and dance two or three 
steps; 
And when we're through, we know that you, will gamble 
we're Par Ex. 
When we worked upon the levee, way down at New Orleans; 
We had some very happy times, and seen some joyous scenes, 
We used to juggle cotton bales, upon the steamer's decks, 
And when the work was over, why, ' tis then we'd feel 
Par Ex. 
If you watch, &c. 
But perhaps we are intruding, upon you're precious time, 
II so don't be offended, nor consider it a 
crime; 
For we always labor hard to please, and do not wish to vex, 
So we leave it to your judgment, if these coons are not 
Par Ex.

Dry goods clerks in bathing,

Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like naaids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Young man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden wash,

There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be,

As through our evolutions we do go. 
And we captivate the girls.

With the fair sex us nigs are number one; 
And we're sure to make them smile, 
With our easy, graceful style 
Our dancing is to them a

THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
As snug by him 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both tue great and the small; 
It's about sonic good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced")} Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
Thera was fun, you can bet at the Actor's Great Ba111 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he took 1 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave them 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo. 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall I 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her fligs used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble. 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his boiler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Braharns to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett Iv Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then 13oucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen. 
And closed up the daylights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
I Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ' gainst the wall. 
Harrigan S.; Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
, And that put an end to the Actors Great Ball!

PRETTY ROSY POSY.

SONG ANE DANCE. 
I 
was rambling by the sea shore, one pleasant afternoon, 
The breeze so sweet so softly bore, a 
nice and pleasing 
tune; 
We wondered much from whence it came, no other sounds 
were sure, 
Had ever, o'er ourselves, gained a 
power so secure 
CHORUS. 
The fairest beauty glided by; [ Symph.] 
I 
saw she had a 
bright blue eye— [Symph.] 
Our Pretty Rosy Posy's gone and left us in despair, 
The loss of her we'll always mourn, she was so sweet and 
fair. 
While slowly walking up the beach, a 
maiden there we 
spied, 
With her a 
few words we did beseech, she answered with 
a 
sigh; 
Of all the treasures we possess, we truly make a 
vow— 
If with her love she had us blessed, we'd freely give them 
now. 
Chorus as before, 
/I sad misfortune we have had, in this our love affair; 
gut now its o'er, we feel quite glad, our hearts can be 
repaired; 
But still at times we love that maid, who look'd so neat 
and cosy— 
With us her charms will never fade—Our Pretty Rosy Posy.

DELEHANYY • 
CHARLEY. 
There's a 
lovely little maiden, 
Living down in yonder lane, 
Who has promised that she'd see me here to-night 
And my heart with love is laden. 
Oh ! the sweet, delicious pain, 
That enraptured hearts experionce with delight! 
And oh! she is charming 
As the flowers in May ; 
Or as lovely as a 
peach in the fall! 
And I 
could'nt see the harm in 
Giving her my love to-day. 
For I 
really think she's sweetest of them all 
CHORUS. 
She's my own—my heart's desire— 
Is my dark- eyed sweet Maria ! 
Oh! tell me why you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly ! 
As if you knew the reason I 
am here. 
And merrily from every tree, 
The pretty warblers sing to me! 
Because they know Maria loves me, dear! 
MARIA. 
Now I 
wonder, where's Charley ? 
Surely, this is where he said 
That he'd meet me when the evening's shadows fell. 
May be I 
have come to early; 
Or, perhaps he has delayed, 
31 
Culling posies for me in the flowing dell. 
But I 
feel just as happy 
As a 
sweet Magnolia flower! 
Or the Honeysuckle, hanging to the wall! 
When I 
saw his manly beauty, 
I 
was victim of its power; 
So I 
cannot help but love him best of all! 
CHORUS. 
He's my own—my heart's desire— 
And he calls me his dear Maria! 
&c., &c. 
CHARLEY. 
Why, my pretty little primrose, 
I 
have heard your pretty song, 
Low and sweet as zephyrs passing thro' the trees ; 
Then a 
feeling in my heart arose 
That I 
had kept you long. 
And now, I 
hope that you'll forgive me, won't you, 
[ 
please? 
MARIA. 
Never ask me, Charley, darling! 
Long as you may ever live ; 
And of your importunities I 
pray be doue. 
CHARLEY. 
Yes! and now desist our quarrelling, 
Loving hearts must soon forgive ; 
And when our minds the same, two hearts must boa

No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a

Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs;

Where all do darkies sing and crack their jokes, 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dose Indian Rubber ldokea.

We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not the a

We are doublo-broasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh! the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around; 
Oh I 
we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found ; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double-twist. 
We're sure to make you, &a.

Many h

For refuge flew to thee ; 
Your ports are always open, 
Ever ready is your hand, 
To welcome here both great and small 
From dear old Ireland. 
When I 
was home I 
often heard 
Of a 
country far away, 
Where the rich and poor they both enjoy 
The same bright light of day ; 
Then my heart says Pat don't work no more 
For nobles without pay, 
But go and gain your liberty 
in sweet America. 
Many a

I'll not lor2eet the noble flag, 
That guards our iiberty,— 
Inviting those who are opposed, 
To come across the sea ;

For sweet America.

RINOROSSOROSOS. 
As sung by JoEnisoli & BATINO. 
Have you seen the curious beast, 
They call the Rinorosos, 
With horns upon their noses like 
That Elephant's probosos. 
Oh, yes, my dear! I'm told they come 
From Africa's morasses; 
And that they revel in the mud— 
Eats -various kinds of grasses.

Oh yes! We've seen the curious beast, 
The Rinoroesorosos; 
With horns upon their noses, like 
That Elephant's probosos. 
In their heads they have a 
sparkling eye, 
Like those of the young lasses; 
And curling o'er their backs a

Has the Rinosoros.

Of beautitul Jackasses, 
And then we'll go right down the stiviit

The Old Home Ain't What it Used to Be 
By C. A. 
W HITE. 
OH, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and folorn, 
'For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes mo sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the fields l've worked when I 
thought 'twas pa-d., 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the childred that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, &e. 
Now the old man would rather lived ar.d died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the coloreo mar., 
He left the cotton-field and corn. 
This old mati has lived out his three ,:core ah.1 Leg, 
And he'll soon have to . ay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better laud, 
ONV old cabiza borne, good-bye.

We wa.nder'd 'mid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet

Where the pretty little water-lilies grow.

I 
KNOW SHE LOVES ME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. TIENGLER. 
I 
know a 
little maiden, fair and young, 
The sweetest little creature in the village, 
Her face is like a 
garden of flowers, new sprung, 
And she lives within a 
rustic little cottage. 
There may be maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright winning ways ; 
But none with eyes so lovely, 
Such a 
sweet bewitching gaze. 
Oh, yes, she is a 
beauty, so loving kind and true, 
And the only girl to suit me, 
With her laughing eyes of blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden ; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away, 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, ( symph.) 
Her actions prove it clearly. ( 
) 
C 
HORUS. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden : 
Cupid came and drove dull care away. 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
One day, while we were walking side by side, 
I 
never shall forget the look she gave me; 
-Iwas when I 
asked her would she be my bride ? 
She smiling said, of course, if you will have me, 
Then threw her arms around my neck— 
Which I 
took not amiss, and in that happy moment. 
You might have heard a 
kiss. 
Oh yes, she loves me dearly, and I 
love her the same ; 
While her actions prove it clearly 
That she'd like to change her name. 
So there will be a 
wedding some fine day, 
And you will hear the merry bells a 
ringing ; 
We'll live out in the country in grand array, 
In a 
flow of joy we'll dwell—to birds a 
singing. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, (symph) 
Her actions prove it clearly, ( " )

Bowery, New 'York. 
Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twits only an innocent spree— 
Ny wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears ; 
Oh she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears', 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
Y. kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, Ix. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
if she'd let me alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile.

A..STOR*S, B.Way, N. T. 
There was a 
young mau who never had his health. 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to be& 
And soon he was fast asleep • 
And to his surprise when he opend up his eyes. 
He was tuned to a 
big dead-beat. 
0. — That's: the reason. Ladies and G-entlemen. you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
CHOUI-S. 
For if you do. surely youl rue it. 
Though strang,e to you it seems. 
For how funny you would look, all strunc,
. . upon a 
hook. 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head. 
And she sent for her darlinc, 
She says, Co bring me that same box of pills, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse. when she sent for the nurse: 
After taking in a 
great big. number. 
When she look'd in the glass she was just as green as 
She had turned to a 
big. cucumber ! 
For if you do, Arc. 
Now the old passie mt was loes-ing for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pills: 
She was loos-in,- 
all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
She thought they would cure all her ills; 
But then the fun began when the oat began t 
From the cellar clear up to the garret:

Oh! we were at a

But then we never run, for we're always in for fan, 
And to sing and dance you find is or delight

When we started it was early in de Fall. 
We're not such very fancy darkies, 
Although we always keep a-looking clean, 
And we hope when you go home to-night your verdict it will be, 
That you are satisfied with what you've seen. 
We used to pick de oranges and sell dem in de streets, 
And seldom dat we made enough to lib; 
So den we went to blacking boots upon de gemmen's feet, 
But we got too big and had to quit de biz. 
Now we ain't got time to tell you all our history, 
For which, we hope, you will not think us mean, 
For where we go we always like to hear the people say 
Of us, they're satisfied with what they've seen.

• 
Now I 
hope I 
don't intrude, and you mustn't think me rude. 
If a 
question I 
should offer to suggest; 
Some philosvers do say " every dog will have his day," 
And they tell us everything is for the best. 
But as I 
look around, so many things I've found 
Which seem to me quite wrong and all awry; 
I've noted down a 
few, which I'll ncw recount to you, 
I'd correct them—or TA know the reason why. 
The papers all do state that at Washington, of late, 
Dishonesty in office has been found; 
There's crooked Whiskey Rings, and a 
heap of other things, 
Where bribery and thievery abound. 
If I 
was only President, I'd settle that machine. 
To rob our Uncle Sam they shouldn't try; 
For every office-holder should show a 
record clean, 
And they'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
In time not long gone by, we the world could defy, 
On the ocean, just as well as on the land, 
But no navy now we've got, and our vessels go to rot, 
Yes, our National shipbuilding's at a 
stand. 
If I 
but had my say, I 
would start at them straightway, 
Our mechanics, who for work do daily cry, 
And each for honest labor should have his honest pay, 
Well, I'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
There's Justice figured blind, the reason you will find— 
For the rich and poor a 
different law we've got; 
If a 
rich man runs away with his thousands, they will say— 
He's absconded simply—but a 
thief he's not I 
fit 
But let a 
poor man steal but the buying of a 
meal, 
He's arrested, and his case at once they'll try; 
Now if I 
was but the judge, even justice I 
would deal, 
Yes, I'd do it— or I'd know the reason why. 
Another Indian war we have got to settle for, 
With the hostile Sioux we've trouble got on hand; 
TZ. each manly heart alarms, for the Redskins are in arm ,
:, 
They've slaughtered gallant Custer and his band. 
The only way, no doubt, the reel devils to wipe out, 
And safety for our settlers there to buy, 
Is to send a 
thousand riflemen, and every on a 
scout/ 
And they'll do it—or they'll know the reason why.

Sting With great. success by FANNY 
W ENTWORTH. 
AIR: Exile Of Erin. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appeared on the chit of a 
bleak rocky share, 
Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets, 
As heedless she gazed on the dread surges' roar. 
Loud rang her harp in ,vild tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more. 
Oh Erin, my country, thy glory's departed, 
For tyrant's and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core. 
Thy daughter's now leave in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots are fled or lie stretched in their gore. 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl in thy hamlets forsaken, 
And from pale hungry orphans their morsel have taken, 
Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the brahmin. 
us heart bled in anguish at the wrongs of the poor. 
To relieve their hadd sufferings he braved every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
Even before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower, 
But alas he is gone, he has fallen a 
young flower, 
They have murdered my Emmet, my Emmet's no rry‘re

And if the Treasury is rol- - f 
Why we are not to blame. 
Oh I

It was by the people's voice; 
They knew that we were honest, 
And we were their willing choice; 
And soon we will be Ministers, 
To England or to France ; 
And with the beauties of the Court, 
Oh! we will have a

leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening :Vail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, 99 Nas-
sau street Ca led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
whereto do if, 
and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.' 
The N. 1. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat Jiffs 
book, bound in Moroeco leather, costing twen'y-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and or the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do Rot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

erties have been taken in ihe translation, than merely to adapt it to tho 
usages of this country.

listinpty Dumpty.—The greatest Trick Book of the Age 
It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Fac-simile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a single pe-
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it : 
"An ingenious little book of the thaureaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called ilumyry DIThIPTY.' and bound in such a 
way as to give oppoitu-
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap-
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is ill 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting Ulf= leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Ball Price 30 Cents.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We ha-7e 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non- committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too (Hifi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and an,wers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
