" 
NOW I LAY BEE DOWN TO SLEEP." 
Words by Miss HarTip; A. Fox. 
Music by Artrucn D. Warm:mar:. 
Published ky Wm. A. PoND & Co. 547 Broadway, Nov York. 
Price 49 cents. 
Now I 
lay me down to sleep, 
And the blue eyes dark and deep, 
Let their snowy curtains down, 
Edged with fringe of golden brown. 
All day long the ange!'s fair, 
I've been watching over there ; 
lleav'ns not far, ' tis just in sight, 
Now they're calling me, good night; 
Kiss me, mother, do not weep, 
Now I 
lay me down to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Over there, just over there, 
I 
shall say my morning pray',r 
Kiss me, mother, do not weep, 
Now I 
by we down to sleep. 
Tangl'd ringlets, all smooth now, 
Looped hack from the waxen brow; 
Little hands so dimpl'd, white, 
Clasp'd together cold to-night. 
Where the mossy, daisit-cl sod, 
Brought sweet messages from God; 
Two pale lips with kisses press'd, 
There we left her to her rest; 
And the dews of ev'ning weep, 
Where we laid her down to sleep. 
Over there, just over there, 
List the angel's m,)rning pray'r ; 
Lispings low tbro' fancy creep, 
Now I 
lay me dawn to sleep.

THE RETIRED SOLDIER

THE MARINER'S GRAVE. 
I 
remember the night was stormy and wet, 
And dismally dash'd the dark wave, 
While the rain and the sleet, 
Cold and heavily beat 
On the Mariner's new dug grave, 
I 
remember ' twas down in a 
darksome dale, 
And near to a 
dreary cave, 
Where the wild winds wail, 
Round the wanderer pale, 
That I 
saw the Mariner's grave. 
I 
remember how slowly the bearers trod, 
And how sad was the look they gave, 
As they rested their load, 
Near its last abode, 
And gazed on the Mariner's grave. 
I 
remember no sound did the silence break, 
As the corpse to the earth they gave, 
Save the night-birds' shriek, 
And the coffin's creak 
As it sunk in the Mariners grave. 
I 
remember a 
tear that slowly slid 
Down the cheek of a 
messmate brave, 
It fell on the lid 
And soon was hid, 
For closed was the Mariner's grave. 
Now o'er his lone bed the briar creeps, 
And the wild flow'rs mournfully wave 
And the willow weeps, 
And the moon-beam sleeps, 
On the Mariner's silent grave. 
-••• 
The retired soldier, bold and brave, 
Now rests his weary feet, 
And in the shelter of the grave, 
Has found a 
safe retreat; 
To him the trumpet's piercing breath, 
To arms, they call in vain ; 
For quartered in the arms of death, 
He'll never, never march again. 
March, march again, march, march again, 
March, march again, march, march again, 
For quartered in the arms of death, 
He'll never, never march again. 
A day when he left his father's home, 
The charms of war to try. 
O'er regions hath he had to roam, 
No friend or mother nigh, 
But still he marched contented on, 
Met danger, death and pain, 
And now at rest, all dangers o'er, 
He'll never, never march again. 
March, march, &e. 
The sweets of spring by beauteous hand, 
Lay scattered on his bier. 
Whilst listening round his .comrades stand, 
Gave honest Ned a 
tear, 
Whilst lovely Kate, for Ned's delight, 
Chief mourner of the train, 
Cried, as she view'd the solemn sight. 
He'll never, never march again. 
March, march, &c.

BONNIE KATE. 
Oh, meet me at sunset, my own Bonnie Kate, 
By the holly-hush tree near the meadow gate ; 
In childhood we wandered the wild wood among, 
And listened with joy to the lurk's merry song. 
CHORUS. 
So come, love, that way, at close of the day, 
The sound of thy footstep, 'tis there I 
will wait, 
Oh. meet ire at sunset, my own love, I 
pray, 
By the holly- bush tree, near the old meadow gate. 
01. don't you remember, my own bonnie Kate, 
The fllwers I 
plucked for my merry playmate, 
When I 
carved the big ' K" with my grandfather's knife, 
Oa the withered oak tree, for my young baby wife. 
So COme, JO e, & cr.. 
No jewels or riches have I, bonnie Kate, 
A strong arm to labor's my on y 
estate. 
And a 
heart that is honest and constant and true, 
Is all that I 
have, love, to offer to you. 
So come love, trzo. 
WHEN I AM FAR AWAY FROM Holx.E-. 
When I 
am for away from home, 
On Afric's distant shore, 
I'll think of those I 
left behind, 
And never may see more. 
No matter where I chance to roam, 
The burden of my lay, 
Shall he, may heaven guard my friends 
When I 
am far away. 
When I 
am far away from home, 
Across the troubled nntin, 
I 
pray that he who made us all, 
May let us meet again. 
Thourb we may part for many years, 
Too burden of may lay 
Shall be, may heaven guard my friends 
When I 
am far away. 
'When I 
am far away from home, 
New friendships may arise, 
But. oh ! my heart sincerely feels 
Affection never dies. 
So let me fervently declare, 
in this my simple lay. 
Nov heaven protect and guard my friends 
Wheu I 
am far away 
THE 
GIRLS 
For England's daughters rosy cheeled, 
Nor Scotia's lasses fair; 
Nor Erin's blooming maiden can 
With the Yankee girls compare; 
Though what they tell us of their charms 
All very true may be, 
They'll not compare with Yankee girls, 
The Yankee girls for me. 
Let Byron, of Italian maids, 
In glowing numbers sing, 
And let the Turk his Georgian bride, 
And black-eyed Houries bring; 
Yet what they tell us of their charms, 
All very true may be, 
They'll not compare with Yankee girls, 
The Yankee girls for me. 
Their faultless forms I 
their peerless eyes, 
- 
As bright as morning dew, 
Their cheeks so fair ! their spirits li ,ht ? 
Their hearts so warm and true! 
They're chaste as fair, their minds unchain'd, 
In thought and action free, 
There's nothing like the Yankee girls, 
The Yankee girls for me. 
Unto Columbia's damgher then, 
We drain the goblet dry, 
Naught can the universe produce, 
With Yankee girls to vie; 
0! they're time fairest of the fair, 
And ever may they he. 
There's nothing like the Yankee girls,

THE ROSE BY THE FOUNTAIN.

BY THE MARGIN OF FAIR Mil:UCH'S WATERS. 
By the margin of fair Zurich's waters— 
Ay 
ieo I 
Dwelt a 
youth whose fond heart, night and day, 
For the fairest of fair Zurich's daughters— 
Ayieo 
In a 
dream of love melted away. 
When alone no one bolder than he, 
But with her none more timid could be ; 
Will you list to me, dearest, I 
pray 2—Ayieo, 
When she did, this was all he could say :— 
Ayieol ayieo ! alack, well- a-day, 
.Ayieo ! ayieo 
was all he could say. 
By the margin of fair Zurich's waters— 
Ayieo ! 
At the close of a 
fine summer's day, 
To the fairest of fair Zurich's daughters— 
Ayieo I 
This fond youth found at last tongue to say: 
I'm in love, as you plainly may see, 
Could I 
love any other but thee: 
011! say then, wilt thou be my bride ? 
Ayieo! 
Can yen tell bow this fair one replied ? 
Ayieo 1 
ayieo! I 
leave you to guess, 
Ayieo! ayieo! of course she said, yes! 
The wild flowers awoke in the woodlands, 
'File lark soar'd aloft in the sky; 
The lilies looked up from the bosom 
Of the stream that went murnaming by. 
King Oswald came down from the mountain, 
With banner of crimson unfurled, 
To pluck the first rose from the fountain, 
With dew-drops so softly itupearled. 
He bore it away from the forest, 
To give to his beautiful queen, 
Away to the home of his father, 
The old castle built up on the green. 
A soft smile play'd round her sweet features, 
The rich blushing flow'ret to see, 
And together they formed this compact. 
The wild rose their emblem should be. 
ADIEU, NY NATIVE LAND, ADIEU. 
Adieu, my native land, adieu I 
The vessel spreads her swelling sails, 
Perhaps I 
never more may view 
Your fertile fields, your flowery dales! 
Delusive hope can charm no more: 
Far from the faithless maid I 
roam ; 
TJnfriended seek some foreign shore; 
Unpitied leave my peaceful home I 
Farewell, dear village, oh ! farewell! 
Soft on the gale thy murmur dies; 
I 
hear thy solemn evening bell : 
Thy spires yet glad my aching eyes; 
Though frequent falls the dazzling tear, 
I 
scorn to shrink from fate's decree, 
And think not cruel maid that e'er 
I'd heave another sigh for thee, 
In vain, through shades of frowning night, 
Mine eyes thy rocky coast explore; 
Deep sinks the fiery orb of light ; 
I 
view thy beacons now no more. 
Rise, billows rise ! blow, hollow winds! 
Nor night nor storm nor death I 
fear: 
Unfriended, bear me hence to find 
That peace which fate denies me here. 
TOLL THE BELL. 
My Lilly dear is sleeping, 
'Neath the old chestnut tree ; 
The spot Where oft she ‘‘ ander'd 
When innocent and free. 
The wild rose and the myrtle, 
Still cluster round the spot; 
But my heart is filled with sorrow, 
And lonely is my lot. 
CHORUS. 
Toll, toll the bell, for gentle Lilly Dale, 
And let its tones echo through the vale ; 
Our Lilly dear we've lost, so loving, kind and true— 
Ring to-day one sad lay, lost Lilly Dale. 
'Tis spring, the birds are warbling 
A sad and mournful tale, 
Of beauty, once so blooming, 
Now lying cold and pale. 
The streamlet ripples onward, 
So quiet through the vale; 
The wild rose drops a 
dewy tear, 
For earth-lost Lilly Dale. 
Toll, toll the bell, e:c. 
My Lilly dear I'm watching, 
Oh 
wilt thou never come; 
To greet me with a 
blessing, 
From thy far angel home. 
Mv sad heart now is aching, 
With weary care opprcst, 
Oh I 
may I 
quickly meet thee 
In that pure laud of rest.

BANKS OF ALLAN WATER. 
On the Banks of Allan Water, 
'When the sweet spring time did fall, 
Was the miller's lovely daughter, 
The fairest of them all. 
For his bride a 
soldier sought her, 
And a 
winning tongue had be; 
On the Banks of Allan Water, 
None was so gay as she. 
On the banks of Allan Water, 
When brown autumn spreads its store, 
Then-I 
saw the miller's daughter, 
But she smiled no more ! 
4 
For the summer grief had brought her, 
And the soldier false was he ; 
On the Banks of Allan Water, 
None was so sad as she, 
On the Banks of Allan Water, 
When the winter snow fell fast, 
Still was seen the miller's daughter, 
Chilly blew the blast. 
But the miller's lovely daughter, 
Both from care and cold \'; as free; 
Oh the Banks of Allan Water, 
There a 
corpse lay she.

Mother dear, you're always sighing, 
Since you last the papers read, 
Tell me now why you are crying, 
Why that cap is on your head? 
Oh I 
I'see you can not tell me— 
Father's one among the slain, 
Although he loved us very dearly, 
He will never come again?' 
Yes, my boy, your noble father, 
Is one number'd with the slain— 
We shall not see him more on earth, 
But in heaven we'll meet again. 
He died for America's glory, 
Our day may not be far between, 
But I 
hope at the last moment, 
That -we alien all meet again. 
MAMA, AINT I SWEET? 
15 
Song and Chorus written on Dan Bryant, Jr., by Rollin Howard. 
With golden hair so lovely, 
And eyes of softest blue, 
That say, in looks so heav'uly— 
Mama, I 
so love you! 
Our' lovely little darling, 
With footsteps light and fleet, 
With pleading looks comes asking— 
Dear mama, aint I 
sweet ? 
CHORUS. 
Rosy little cherub, 
With hair of golden hue, 
Ah, you know not, my darling, 
How veil mama loves you 
The first thing in the morning, 
That voice so soft and sweet, 
Comes its little song a-singing, 
Its mama dear to greet; 
And, at the hour of evening, 
Its evening prayer ' 11 repeat; 
But ever before its sleeping, 
Says, Mama, aint I 
sweet ? 
Rosy little cherub, &c.

THERE'S A PATH BY THE RIVER. 
Words by COL. ADDISON. 
Music by E. 
J. 
LODER. 
There's a 
path by the river o'ershadow'd by trees, 
Where people may walk and may talk if they please ; 
And save by a 
bird not a 
sound can be heard, 
So do not come there, if you please, if you please, 
So do not come there, if you please. 
I 
feel that I'm lonely, my mind's ill at ease; 
l'ut sure it would mend me to feel the soft breeze 
As it plays on the shore, at the hour of four, 
So mind you don't come, if you please, if you please, 
So mind you don't come, if you please. 
There's a 
path by the river o'er shadow'd by trees, 
Where people may walk and may talk if they please, 
And save by a 
bird not a 
sound can be heard, 
So mind you don't come, if you please if you please, 
So mind you don't come if you please. 
Yet if others should like to enjoy the fresh breeze, 
Some who feel, like myself, that their mind's ill at ease. 
If yourself you should go, I 
can't help it you know 
You've a 
right to walk there if you please, if you please, 
You've a 
right to walk there if you please. 
There's a 
hive near the walk, and I'm frightened of bees, 
The Gipsies might rob, and the urchins might teaze, 
And really I 
fear quite alone to appear, 
So, I 
think you may come, if you please if you please, 
Yes this once you may come, if you please, just this once, only 
once. 
There's a 
path by the river o'er shadow'd by trees, 
Where people may walk and may talk if they please, 
And save by a 
bird not a 
sound can be heard, 
So 1 
think you may come, if you please, if you please, 
Yes, this once you may come, if you please. 
KISS THE LITTLE ONES. AT HONE. 
Evening shadows now are falling, 
Sad and lonely I 
have grown; 
0, to hear the children calling, 
In their old familiar tone 
Far away my steps are roving; 
Weary now as heart can be! 
Darling one, so kind and loving, 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
CITOEUS. 
0, to see their laughing faces, 
While I 
join in all their glee ; 
0, to feel their warm embraces— 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
When the darkness gathers round me, 
How I 
miss their sweet good night— 
Miss the dimple arms that bound me— 
Miss the little hands so white. 
Still, in pure delight, I 
ponder, 
Whilst I 
dream of them aud thee. 
forget, tho' far I 
wander— 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
0, to see their, &c. 
What, tho' little forms we cherish. 
Angels soon may call away, 
Can the love for ever perish 
That we bear for them to.day ? 
Tho' from out our homes we miss them, 
Yet our Father's they will be ; 
Air I 
know that he will kiss them— 
Kiss the little ones for me 
0, to see their, &c.

TWILIGHT STEALS SOFTLY. 
By 
ERNEST Fox. 
Twilight steals softly over the ground, 
Buried in shadow all nature around. 
Sin ,ring so gaily as my bark glides along, 
Murmuring waters re-echo my song 
Gently and gaily I 
ride down the stream 
Purling so softly like love's young dream. 
Nearer and nearer my own loved home, 
Nearer and nearer onward I 
come. 
Twilight steals softly over the ground 
Buried in shadow all nature around 
Singing so gaily as my bark glides along 
Murmuring waters re-echo my song. 
The twilight hath gone, fled from the night 
The moon now bath risen so broad round and bright 
Her beams from above in the cool waters hive 
As I 
float gaily on with the silver tipp'd wave. 
Sweet music I 
hear, how great the spell 
It is the dear voice of her I 
love well. 
My bark now is anchor'd, I 
leap on the moor, 
The melody ceases and dies from the shore 
The twilight hath gone, fled from night, 
The moon now bath risen so broad round and so bright 
Her beams from above in the cool waters 1 
kve, 
And floats gaily on with silver tipp'd wave. 
SWEET LOVE, GOOD NIGHT TO THEE. 
Words by JOHN DUFF. 
Music by J. L. HATTox. 
The exile leaves his native land, 
With sad and tearful eye, 
He thinks upon his village home, 
And heaves the bitter sigh ; 
But air, he feels not half the grief 
That now is felt by me, 
As when I 
falter out the words: 
Sweet love, good night to thee, 
Sweet love, good night to thee, 
Sweet love, good night to thee 
Sweet love, good night to thee, 
Sweet love, good night, good night to thee. 
The miser views his golden store— 
With joy it fills his heart, 
His sordid mind is pain'd to see 
One single coin depqrt 
Then let me be a 
miser too,— 
Thy smiles are gold to me, 
Ne'er let another's voice repeat ; 
Sweet love, good night to thee, & c. 
SLEEP WELL, THOU SWEET ANGEL. 
By 
FRANZ ABT. 
The bells are hush'd, the world is still, 
The sound of toil is heard no more, 
The bird has ceased his tuneful song, 
And heav'n with stars is spangled o'er. 
Sleep well, sleep well, and let thy lovely eyelids close, 
Sleep well, sleep well, dear angel sweet be thy repose. 
Oh, didst thou think of me to-day, 
The thought of thee my heart could fill, 
And now to breathe a 
fond good night, 
Beside thy door I 
linger still. 
Sleep well, sleep well, and let thy lovely eyelids close, 
3.1eep well, sleep well, dear angel, sweet be thy repose. 
There comes to thee from heav'nly realms, 
A 
holy messenger, to-night, 
He brings you bright and peaceful dreams, 
Til you awake in morning light. 
Sleep well, sleep well, and let thy lovely eyelids close, 
Sleep well, sleep well, dear angel, sweet be thy repose. 
Sleep well, dear angel, sweet be thy repose. 
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. 
Slowly twilight shadows fall, 
A dreamy' tone of rest 
Bath hush'd the flow'rets in their'sleep, 
And calmed -the water's -breast--
Beautiful night;-- beautiful night 
The stars are looking softly down, 
With gentle loving eyes, 
They light their lamp to keep their watch, 
While earth in slumber lies— 
Beautiful night—beautiful night / 
Moon, in thy spangled home afar, 
How sweet thy pensive beam, 
Fair is thy silvery path on high, 
Far o'er the rippling stream— 
Beautiful night—beautiful night! 
The heart it feels thy holy spell, 
And bids its murmuring cease, 
And o'er the troubled spirit sheds 
Sweet rest and holy peace— 
Beautiful night— beautiful night

WBECICED AND SAVED. 
Words by J. BENDAIIL. —
MRSie by W. KNOVirLES 
The day was fair, the sun was bright, 
Our ship so gaily dress'd, 
All hearts were bounding with delight, 
Not one with fear oppress'd. 
The anchor weigli'd, each sail was spread 
To catch the fresh'ning breeze, 
And on our way we swiftly sped, 
Upon the boundless seas. 
But soon a 
dreadful storm began, 
The livid light'ning flash'd, 
The troubled seas lile mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
And loud the thunder crasled. 
The raving waters swept the deck 
And shiver'd ey'ry mast, 
All sails were gone, the ship a 
wreck. 
And down- ward sinking fast. 
Our Captain calm, serene his brew, 
The fearful sentence gave, 
" 
We're lost, no pow'r can help us now, 
The sea must be our grave." 
E'en then we wept not in despair 
Tho' hope of life had flown. 
But rais'd one voice in holy pray'r, 
To Ileavn's benignant throne. 
The last farewell, the last good-bye 
We gave, for death seened near. 
When ho I 
a 
sail, a 
ship conies nigh. 
Thai:k God, thank God, thine aid is near. 
Hurrah we're sav'd now homeward bound. 
The ship speeds on amain. 
Soon shall our joyous shout resound 
In Eno-land once 
H urrah I 
we're say'd, now homeward bound 
The ship speeds on amain. 
Soon shdl onr j,,yous shout resound 
lu England once again.

LOOK ALWAYS ON THE SUNNY SIDE." 
Words by STUART 
AnQuitmtsoN. 
Music by E. L. 
HINE. 
Look always on the sunny side, 
'Tis wise and better far, 
And safer thro' life's cares to glide, 
Beneath hope's beaming star, 
The springs of rosy laughter lie, 
Close by the well of tears, 
Yet why should merry fancies die, 
O'erwhelmed by idle fears. 
Look always on the sunny side, 
'Tis wise and better far, 
And safer thro' life's cares to glide, 
Beneath hope's beaming star. 
Look always on the sunny side, 
The guiltless bosom can, 
Nor tremble ' midst life's roughest tide, 
It is not worthy man, 
Why should the heart with vain regret, 
Break joy's enchanting spell, 
Tito' age has come, love lingers yet 
In ev'ry flow'ry dell. 
Look always on the sunny side, 
'Tis wise and better far, 
And safer through life's cares to glide, 
Beneath hope's beaming star. 
Look always on the sunny side, 
Earth's not forlorn or drear, 
Hope ever be through life our guide 
My friend ! nor shadows fear. 
The clouds around the setting sun, 
Add glory to the skies, 
Thus shadows round us darldy flung, 
Make brighter days arise. 
Look always on the sunny side 
'Tis wise and better far, 
And safer through life's care to glide, 
Beneath hope's beaming star.

THE LITTLE DROOPING FLOWER. 
Words by G. W. Moon.E. 
Music by CHARLES BLAIIPIHN. 
Once in the spring time of my life, 
Tirhen all around ‘‘ as clear, 
There came a 
little drooping flow'r, 
Who wept a 
bitter tear ; 
Her father gone long, long ago, 
Her mother too, is dead, 
"Oh, pity me, poor little one!" 
Were all the words she said. 
ClitoRUS. 
Oh, heaven bless the little ones, 
She rais'd her drooping- bead, 
"Oh, mother dearest, mother dear," 
Were all the words she said. 
I 
took her soft and snow-white hand, 
And led her to the door 
Au I 
bitterly we both did weep, 
As never wept before; 
She rais'd her little hand and cried, 
" 
Can this Le true, they're dead ? 
Oh, would my time was come to die I" 
Were all the words she said. 
Oh, heaven bless, & c. 
The time roIrd on; I 
priZd and lov'd, 
As never loved before, 
And oft times think of when I 
met 
My love at father's door; 
Those days are past ; we're happy now 
Our sorrows they have fled, 
I 
wisit'd her mine, she answeed, ' Yes, 
I'm thine alone," she 
Oh, lieav,,n 
bless, Lic, 
LOVE ME LITTLE, LOVE ME LONG. 
Say not life is dark and dreary, 
While around us flowerets bloom, 
All is bright where love abideth. 
His fond smiles can all ilium.); 
is there not a 
spell in beauty, 
Bow we not before her shrine ? 
Is the coldest heart not wakened 
By the power of sung divine? 
CHORUS. 
Then no more be sad and weary, 
When amid the world's cold throng, 
If thou hearest one soft voice whisper, 
"Love me little, love me long." 
Yes. ' tis love can soothe and cheer us 
Down the thorny va!e of life, 
Better far a 
peaceful cottage, 
'Than a 
palace full of strife ; 
I 
am happy while fate leaves TIM 
One kind heart to warmly prize, 
While the light of pure affection 
Beams within those gentle eyes. 
Then no, &c. 
SILVERY WATERS GLIDE. 
I'm lonely since my brother died, 
My heart is filled with pain, 
And oh. the dreary night of woe, 
ne'er shall see his face again, 
I 
loved hi in oh. so tenderly, 
And many bitter tears I've shed, 
For now I 
bear his voice no more, 
lie's sleeping with the silent dead. 
For now be sleeps 'Death sacred sod, 
Where silvery waters softly glide, 
The tears rush back upon my heart, 
I'm lonely since my brother died. 
He left me oh, so bright and gay. 
Wile!' sunbeams showered from the sky, 
And said that he'd come back some day, 
And kissed me when he said, Good-bye 
But now he'll not return to me. 
I 
ne'er shall see his face again, 
And heavy tears bedew my eyes, 
While sorrow fills my heart with pain. 
For ow 
lie sleeps, &c.

The way that I

'Twas one afternoon that I 
went to Bellevue, 
A

And took little Polly for whom he'd to pay; 
'When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his chance 'twas all U. P. 
And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, && 
She said " she'd be mine" and she swore to be true 
We've since been like doves, billing and cooing I 
We never fall out as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you; 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
If she don't mind, well I 
don't care, 
She says " that her fortune I 
shall share," 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &a 
She's published the banns, were going to be wed. 
I 
leave those matters for her to settle, 
To-morrow, for time so quickly has fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led; 
I 
need not work whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea I'm not averse, 
And p'rhaps one day I 
may have to nurse,

HAPPY BIRD 
Words by II. S. LEIGH.—Music by W . 
MEYER LUTZ. 
Happy bird, 0 how swift is your flight to the west, 
To the shores that I 
dream of in vain. 
You are wafted on wings that will never know rest, 
Till they reach the dear home once again ; 
If one tear-drop of memory starts from the source, 
I 
could pray happy bird as it flows, 
That this eye which is dimm'd while it follows your course 
Might but follow that course to its close. 
CHORUS. 
Happy bird, 0 how swift is your flight to the west, 
To the shores that I 
dream of in vain, 
You are wafted on wings that will never know rest, 
Till they reach the dear home once again. 
Happy bird, how I 
wish when you traverse the sea, 
You could bear with you over the foam, 
The regrets, and the sighs that I 
give to the breeze, 
For the sake of the loy'd ones at home ; 
Yet I 
would not embitter their thoughts by a 
word, 
Which may sadden the hearts that are dear, 
Never speak of my Sorrow to them, happy bird, 
Since the message might cost them a 
tear. 
Happy bird, arc.

My heart is full of joy to-day, 
The air hath music in it; 
Once more I 
roam the wildood way, 
And prize the passing minute. 
The balms of heaven are on my cheek, 
My feet in meadow mazes; 
Let me alone, and I 
will speak 
My blessing on the daisies. 
I 
have not seen for half a 
year, 
Sore pent in cares and labors ; 
These grins of earth, these blossoms dear, 
These free and gladsome neighbors 
They smile upon me as of old, 
Through mem'ry's shifting phases ; 
My blessing on your white and gold, 
Ye well beloved -
daisies. 
I 
love ye for yourselves alone, 
Ye bright perennial comers ; 
Ye ease my brow of winters known, 
And crown my locks with summers. 
Ye give me back the thoughts of youth, 
Its feeling and its phases; 
Its careless joy, its simple truth, 
My blessing on the daisies. 
If only once each hundred springs 
Ye bloom'd the long grass under; 
The crowd, with all its priests and kings, 
Would throng to see and wonder. 
Religion's self would kneel and pray, 
And hymn your Maker's praises ; 
But you, ye blossom every day ! 
My blessing on the daisies.

A 
maiden stood at the cottage door 
And eager look'd down the lane, 
Then in she ran and look'd at the clocr., 
Then off to the door again, 
And she look'd before and look'd behind 
For one she wished to see, 
When soon as the postman appear'd she ask'd 
Oh have you a 
letter for me ? 
But the postman pass'd without speaking a 
word, 
And sad she seem'd to be, 
A tear fell down her rosy cheek, 
Which plainly proved to me 
That shake of the postman's head had caus'd 
A wound no eye could see. 
For she thought all day of the postman's no I 
When she ask'd a 
letter for me? 
Next morning she stood at the self same spot, 
She look'd at the clock again, 
As eagerly look'd for the well known form, 
And d. opp'd a 
tear of pain; 
And her heart beat fast, as he came at last, 
For he never smil'd, not he ? 
But answer'd yes as she gently ask'd 
Pray, have you a 
letter for me ?

THE MAIDEN IN THE GREENWOOD. 
Words by W. Haas. 
Music by G. FORBES. 
A maiden stood in the gay greenwood, 
The fairest of all things there ; 
And her face was mild as the face of a 
child, 
With the sun on her golden hair; 
Her head was bent, and her gaze intent 
On the leaves she plucked from a 
flow'r. 
And they floated down to the edge of her gown, 
As snowflakes fall in a 
shower. 
And they floated down to the edge of her gown,, 
As snowflakes fall in a 
shower. 
She breathed a 
spell as each leaflet fell, 
In a 
voice that was soft and low,— 
" 
Oflow'ret, tell! does he love me well ? 
Ali! will it be yes, or no ?" 
She pluck'd each leaf in the fond belief 
It would tell her her future lot, 
But the last leaf came, and she murnmr'd his name: 
" ! Harry, you love me not I" 
But the last leaf came, and she murnmed his name: 
"Ah i 
Harry, you love me not l" 
But Harry was nigh and heard her cry, 
And his face was alive with glee ; 
And his glance was bright, and his laughter light, 
As he stept from the old elm tree; 
He look'd in her face with a 
lover's grace, 
As he sought her hand to press; 
And the rest of my song, not to make it too long, 
Is a 
riddle for you to guess. 
And the rest of my song, not to make it too long, 
Is a 
riddle for you to guess.

The summer sun shines bright to-day, 
But not bright as yore, 
As years ago down by the Bay. 
I 
played upon the shore. 
The winds they whisper still to me, 
But do not seem to say, 
Such things as caused my childish glee, 
In the old House by the Bay. 
1 
see the breakers come and go, 
As they did in days gone by, 
On the -white bench shining down below 
The bluff that stands so high. 
But my mother's lov'd voice singing, 
Comes not to me to- day, 
With its hallowed sweetness ringing, 
Near the old House by the Bay. 
But sweetest memories ripened, 
In the spot my heart first knew, 
Where my infant eyes first opened, 
On the waters calm and blue. 
And the greatest earthly blessing, 
But seems to me to- day, 
To at last be sure of resting, 
Near the old house by the Bay.

When the flowers like angels breathing. 
Grateful incense to the skies; 
Close their leaves, in fragrance wreathing, 
Peaceful twilight as she lies.

A SWEET SONG-BIRD WAS SINGING. 
By W. F. Temoa. 
A sweet song-bird was singing, 
Singing in the old elm tree ; 
And sown'd to say in notes so ringing, 
"Fly away, 0! fly with me." 
Come into the clear blue sky, 
And leave behind the mouldy earth; 
Come unto the heavenly feuntain, 
Where the muses had their birth. 
Fly away, fly away. 
It flew away still singing. 
Fly away, 0! fly with me; 
'Until it vanished in the tether, 
As I 
gazed beneath the tree. 
Still its song does linger long. 
And makes me long to leave the earth ; 
And take my thoughts unto the fountain, 
Where the muses had their birth. 
Fly away, fly away.

THE WIDOW'S SON. 
The Mnsic of this Song is published by E. H. ELIRDENI
G, 288 Bowery. 
Price 10 Cents. 
A widow stands upon the shore, 
Her boy clasp'd to her heart ; 
She prays that heav'n will him watch o'er, 
Since they are doom'd to part. 
Alas ! the signal now is given for them to seperate, 
Whose tearful eyes are turfed to heav'n, 
Its aid to supplicate. 
Long years of absence have pass'd by, 
When on the beach once more 
Toe mother stands with tearful eye, 
Amid the tempest's roar; 
For struggling with the ! nighty deep, 
Breasting the surging wave, 
The bark that bears her only child, 
She prays great heav'n to save. 
Her pray'r heav'ns aid hath surely won, 
For storm —clouds flit away, 
And brightly beams the morning sun 
Amid the ocean spray. 
The gallant bark at anchor rides, 
While kneeling on the shore, 
The mother clasps her darling boy, 
In life to part no more. 
THE BATTLE PRAYER.' 
Father, I 
bend to thee, 
Life, it was thy gift, 
Th ou now can'st shield it, 
From thee it came, and to thee I 
yield it, 
In life or death for sake not me. 
Father I 
bend to thee. 
Fa: tier ! I 
trust in thee, 
When trid'st the Battle's strife, 
Death, did surround me, 
E'en at the cannon's mouth, 
Death has not found me, 
Father 'twas thy will 
I 
trust in thee. 
Father still guide thou me, 
All I 
give back to thee ! 
When at thy call, I 
my 
Life then shall yield 
When in the cold tomb my fate shall be seal'd 
Fattier my soul take unto thee ! 
Father forsake not me. 
0 GIVE ME BACH, BUT YESTERDAY. 
By F. ROSIER. 
Oh give me back but yesterday 
I 
know what I 
would do, 
What friends I'd cherish in my heart, 
What dear ones I 
would woo, 
What dear ones I 
would woo. 
I'd listen to no envious voice 
To part me by its breath, 
And cause me during life to shun 
Those fondly loved in death, 
Oh, give me back but yesterday, 
I 
know %%lint I 
would do, 
What ft lends I'd cherish in may heart, 
What dear ° ins I 
would woo. 
Oh useless are these dreams of joy, 
And vainly I 
deplore, 
It only bids me live in love, 
And close my heart no more, 
And close my heart no more, 
Then let me cherish yesterday, 
Since lessons it will give 
Nor leave for friends but sad regrets 
But love them whilst they live. 
Oh, give toe back but, yesterday, 
I 
know what I 
would do, 
What friends I'd cherish in my heart 
What dear ones I 
would woo. 
SHE IS NOT FAIR TO OUTWARD VIEW. 
Words by HAartx.y COLERIDGE, —Music by AuTura S. 
SULLIVAN. 
She is not fair to outward view, 
As other maidens be ; 
Her loveliness I 
never knew 
Until she sinil'd on toe, 
Until she smil'd on me; 
Oh I 
then I 
saw her eye Nyns bright, 
A well of love, a 
spring of light, 
Oh ! then I 
saw her eye was bright 
A well of love, a 
spring of light. 
But now her looks are coy and cold, 
To mine they nu'er reply : 
And yet I 
cease not to behold 
The love light in her eye, 
r1,110 love-light in her eve: 
Her very frowns are fairer far 
Than smiles of other maidens are; 
Her very frowns are fairer far 
Than smiles of other maidens are.

LITTLE MARY ANN. 
In a 
quiet little village near the banks of a 
stream, 
Where poets love to wander and sweet music seems to dream, 
'Where the ivy-covered spire points aloft to happier spheres, 
And bids both young and old prepare to meet declining years, 
In a 
green and shady lane, long ere I 
became a 
man, 
I 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
My little Mail Ann, 
Sweet little Mary Ann, 
I 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
But as years passed slowly on I 
impatiently did wait 
To reach that joyous time which gives to manhood its estate, 
When I 
should plow and mow and gaily sing the jocund song 
Of the husbandman who plods his way so merrily along. 
Then I 
did as duty bade me, and ever sought a 
plan 
To enable me some summer's morn to wed my Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, &c. 
By industry I 
gained a 
little fortune of my own, 
For well I 
knew what I 
would reap, must first be duly sown ; 
I 
bought a 
pretty cottage and a 
garden in full store, 
Where roses twined with honeysuckle graced the rustic door. 
Now my joy was near complete and to perfect make my plan, 
I 
hastened and I 
married my dear little Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, (ke. 
The squire of„the village gave the blooming- bride away, 
And often have we eilled on him-. to c,lehrate the day ; 
Upon her brow ho place I 
a 
wreath 
flowers choice and rare, 
Full many a 
year that wreath we've kept and o'er them breathed 
a 
prayer. 
Each day our bliss increases Finee our wedding life began, 
And the village song from m-Jrn to night. is little Mary Ann.

THE BROOK. 
'.Words by TENNYSON 
Music by DoLoma. 
With many a 
curve my banks I 
fret, 
By many a 
field and fallow; 
And many a 
fairy foreland set 
With willow, weed, and mallow. 
I 
slip, I 
slide, I 
gleam, I 
glance, 
Among my skimming swallows; 
I 
make the netted sunbeams dance 
Against my sandy shallows; 
I 
chatter, chatter, as I 
flow, 
To join the brimming river, 
For men in fl 
come, and men may go, 
But II go on for ever, ever, 
I 
go on for ever, ever. I 
go on for ever. 
I 
wind about, and in and out, 
With here a 
blossom sailing; 
And here and there a 
lusty trout. 
And here and there a 
grayling-, 
And here and there a 
snowy flake 
Upon me as I 
travel, 
With many a 
silver water break 
Above the golden gravel; 
And draw then' all along, and flow, 
To join the brimming river. 
For men may come, and men may go, 
But I 
go on for ever, ever, 
I 
go on for ever, ever. I 
go on for ever. 
I 
steal by lawn and grassy plots, 
I 
slide by hazel covers; 
I 
move the sweet forget-me-nots, 
That grow for happy lovers. 
I 
murmur under moon and stars 
In brambly wildernesses; 
I 
linger by my shingly bars, 
I 
loiter rInind illy cresses, 
And out a! ,ain I 
curve and flow, 
To join the brimming river, 
For men may conic, and men may go, 
But I 
go on for ever, ever, 
I 
go on tor ever, ever. I 
go on for ever.

SWEET J.ENY O'F:' THE MOOR 
One morn, for recreation, as I , trayed by the sea side, 
The sun was gently rising, bedeek'd in all his pride ; 
I 
beheld a 
lovely maiden sitting at a 
cottage door, 
With roses blooming on her cheeks, sweet Jenny of the Moor 
1 
stood in contemplation as I 
viewed each charming scene. 
And fill'd with admiration, as if some fairy dream ; 
Enchanted by this fair one, as she Nvniked along the shore, 
Gathering of staweeds was sweet Jenny of the Moor. 
said `• My pretty fair one, why so early do you rise ?" 
"I love to breathe the morning air, when the lark soars tn the 
skies; 
This spot is sweet to wander by, tho' the breakers often roar. 
And wake the bosom of the deep," says sweet Jenny of the Meer. 
We both sat down together by a 
pleasnnt shady side, 
I 
said, " My dear, with your consent, 1'11 make yen my bride ; 
I've plenty at my own command, brought front a 
foreign shore. 
For prond's the man that wins the hand of sweet Jenny of the 
Moor." 
"I have a 
true-love of my own, tho' long he's been away, 
And true I'll be to him while lie is on the sea ; 
His vows were fon 1v spoken w hen we parted at tile door. 
I 
will wait till his return," says sweet Jenny of the Moor. 
" 
Oh if your love a 
sailor, pray, tell me now his anine 
name is Dennis Ryan, from Newry Town lie came, 
With laurels I 
II entwine him, when he returns, on shore, 
-We'd join our hands in wedlock's bands," says Jenny of 11.-• 
Moor. 
" 
If Dennis was year own true-love. I 
knew him very well, 
Vei.bst 1.14.1iting A the Alnnt, by an argry ball he f ; 
Behold this true love token, which upon his hand he wore." 
Sine fell and fainted in his arms, sweet Jenny of the Moor. 
" 
Since you have proved so kind and true, look up, my girl, I 
cried, 
Deltoid, it is your Dennis, now standing by your side; 
Let us be united, and live happy on the fillore,

MARION'S SONG. 
Music by CLABIBEL. 
Once in the cool of early morn, 
The lark was singing aloud ; 
Like a 
king in state lie was high up borne 
his throne was a 
crimson cloud ; 
While titre' the air his song was ringing, 
Came the sweet sounds of Marion's singing; 
The echoes listen'd and caught the strain, 
I 
heard them singing the song again, 
I 
heard them singing the song again. 
Then in the turf a 
violet sweet, 
Looked up at the music rare; 
The sunbeams crept to my darling's feet, 
And worshipped the singer there ; 
The lark came down from his cloud to hear her, 
The linnet flew up into a 
briar near her 
The dewdrops clung to her garment's hem, 
She sings not now for any of them, 
She sings not now for any of them. 
Angels who sing in the heav'ns above, 
Bent over their hat ps and smiled ; 
For their love to me was a 
cruel love, 
They robbed me of may child. 
In vain may lark and linnet listen, 
In vain may the sun on the dew drops glisten; 
No Marion sings to them, never, oh, never, 
The Angels will keep her, for ever, for ever. 
The Angels will keep her, for ever, for ever.

THE BRIDGE. 
W ords by II. 
W. 
LONGFELLOW. 
Music by Miss M. 
LINDSAY. 
I 
stood on the bridge :4 
midnight, 
As the clocks were striking the hour; 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Behind the dark church tow'r. 
And like the waters rushing, 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That fill'd niv eves will( tears. 
How often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky ! 
How often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on the bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky 
How often, oh ! how often, 
1 
had wished that ebbing tide, 
Would bear me away on its bosom 
O'er the ocean wild and wide. 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care; 
And the burthen laid upon me, 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear. 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It is buried in the sea ; 
And only the sorrows of others 
Throws its shadow Over TOO. 
Yet whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other y( ars ; 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As lonL, as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As the symbol of love in Heaven, 
And its wavering image here. 
THE HEART TO LOVE. 
Music by EMIL STAPLER. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. 11. HARDING, 288 Bowery, 
Price 10 cents. 
Though old and ragged be his coat 
And poor his richest fare, 
Though he may not possess a 
groat, 
Yet still I 
do not care. 
If brother like he'd share his store, 
I 
care not who may know it, 
I 
would not heed the coat he wore, 
But love the heart below it. 
No king or prince with garter'd knee, 
Or lord of noble birth, 
Could e'er such homage win from me, 
As one of noble worth, 
Let others praise the blaze of arms, 
I 
care not who may know it, 
No gaudy show for me has charms, 
But 'tis the heart below it. 
The man that acts an honest part, 
With bold and daring eye. 
Whose breast contains an honest heart, 
That throbs with sympathy, 
I'd ever love though weal and woe, 
I 
care not who may know it, 
The clothes are but the out- ward show, 
The manly heart's below it.

LITTLE DIAMOND DEWDROP. 
By CHARLE8 BLAMPHIN. 
I 
saw a 
diamond dewdrop, 
Hang trembling on a 
thorn, 
At the coining of Aurora, 
On a 
balmy summer morn. 
And rtund it winds were wooing, 
In sighs so saft and low, 
That, the fairy drop blusli'd rosy red, 
In the dawning's ruddy glow. 
CHORUS. --All ! gentle crystal dewdrop, 
Thou diamond of the morn, 
Thou welt the fairest dewdrop, 
That ever waved on thorn.

-Upon the thorny leaf. 
And pray'd its sweet existence,

HALF MAST HIGH. 
Words and Music by CLAILIBEL. 
With silver gleam the moan's pale beam, 
Fell on the sleeping wave; 
Yet o'er the main there seem'd to reign 
The stillness of the grave. 
Each fishing boat seem'd scarce afloat, 
Dark ships were anchor'd nigh. 
On one alone the moonbeams shone, 
Whose flag was " half mast high." 
On one alone the moonbeams shone 
Whose flag was " half mast high." 
And then I 
knew, while stars were few, 
The Angel had come down 
And o'er some brow, all peaceful now, 
Had held th' immortal crown. 
His race is run, his voyage done, 
I 
could not choose but sigh. 
Sad tears would flow if some could know 
That flag was " half mast log-h." 
Sad tears would flow, if sonic could know 
That flag was " half mast high." 
Shine on fair moon and set not soon, 
Look down ye golden stars, 
And shed your light on souls to-night 
Twit feel their prison bars. 
For that glad soul who sees 
The goal, The heavenly haven nigh, 
We will not weep tho' on the deep 
A ila -4 
rides " half roast high." 
We will not weep, tho' on the deep 
A flag rides " half mast high."

THE VALLEY BY THE STREAM. 
She lives near the old Mohawk, 
In the valley by the stream, 
Where many an hour I've passe'd 
That seems now like a 
dream. 
My home, though so far away 
In other lands, I 
see, 
With father, mother, standing by, 
When I 
parted, love, from thee. 
CHORUS. 
Ere long, in summer time, 
Down the valley I 
will roam, 
To gather flowers with my love, 
Who soon will be my own. 
When I 
left the old Mohawk, 
Heart- broken then was I; 
Father, mother, both did weep, 
The day I 
said " Good-bye." 
I 
press'd my love's soft hand, 
And fondly kiss'd her brow ;— 
These are the dreams of the past 
That ever haunt me now. 
I'll return to the old Mohawk— 
How happy we shall be I 
I've wander'd many a 
year 
To gather wealth for thee. 
Soon shall we meet again, 
My cherish'd angel guide, 
And never more from thee part, 
My own, my darling bride. 
Ere long, (Ix. 
Ere long, 
"OH, WOULD I WERE A BIRD." 
By CHARLES EL:121E11W. 
Oh would I 
were a 
bird, 
That I 
might fly to thee, 
And breathe a 
loving word, 
To one so dear to me, 
How happy would I 
be, 
Carolling all the day, 
If only blest with thee, 
Beguiling time away, 
Then life would be a 
pleasure, 
My mind would be at rest, 
If with my only treasure, 
This heart was ever blest. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
bird, that I 
might fly to thee, 
And breathe a 
loving word, to one so dear to me. 
Oh, would that I 
could fly, 
This bright and glorious day, 
To give a 
sigh for sigh, 
To thee so far away, 
My heart would beat for joy, 
To see thee once again, 
Thy sorrows to allay, 
For cherished is thy name. 
And when the moon is beaming, 
O'er distant grove and lea, 
And joyous stars are gleaming, 
Then would I 
were with thee. 
Oh would I 
were a 
bird, that, I 
might fly to thee, 
And breathe a 
loving word, to one so dear to me.

She sings her wild songs to the murmuring sea, 
She'll dance on the sand where the fisherman stands, 
And join in the music of a

She sits in her boat and sings o'er ths billow, 
And till is with the spray like a

She laughs at the winds whose revelo are music, 
And bests to the time with the stroke of her scull.- Clio.

She shall go like a

With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.-CAo.

THE SCARLET FLOWER. 
Site's gentle as the zephyr , 
That sips of every sweet. 
She's fairer than the fairest lily 
In nature's soft retreat. 
Her eycs are like the crystal brook, 
And clear and bright to see, 
lien lips outshine the scarlet flower 
Of bonny Ellerslie. 
Oh, were my love a 
blossom, 
When simmer skies depart, 
I'd plant her in my bosom, 
Her garden, here, my heart. 
And oft I'd kiss her balmy lips, 
So beautiful to see, 
That far outshines the scarlet flower 
Of bonnie Ellerslie. 
Might I 
be king of Scotland's throne, 
And a' the world beside, 
Right glad I'd give my crown to her, 
That lovely maid, my bride. 
The gates 
of 
heaven is at her lips, 
Denied, alas ! to rne— 
That lip which shames the scarlet flowei 
Of bonnie Ellerslie.

MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD. 
Oh! the happy days of childhood 
Have pass'd like summer show'rs, 
When from meadow-grass and tangled brake 
I 
culi'd the fairest flow'rs. 
No bird could be more happy, 
When the sun shone on the lea, 
Than when I 
sported thro' the field, 
So blithe, so gay, and free. 
Oh! the happy days, & e. 
And when at school the task was o'er, 
I 
with my ctliool-mates stray'd, 
Seeking, with anxious, longing eyes, 
For birds' nests in each glade. 
Indeed, it is a 
happy time, 
When, free from toil and strife, 
The child ne'er thinks of after cares, 
With which our lives are rife . 
Oh I 
the happy days, &c. 
I 
often turn a 
wistful gaze 
Upon those days gone by, 
When thoughts of home and happy hours 
Will oft provoke a 
sigh. 
'Tis but a 
bright and transient dream, 
Which makes the bosom burn; 
Those days are past, have swiftly fled, 
And ne'er will more return. 
Oh ! the happy days, & c. 
Si 
LOTTIE LEE. 
I 
think of the loved one Lottie, 
And I 
often wander ' neath that willow tree ; 
Where the merry birds above are singing, 
Just the same as when you heard them Lottie Lee. 
CITORUS. 
Merry, warbling birds, happy joyous birds, 
Oh I 
how sad your songs to me ; 
Merry, warblieg.,, birds, happy joyous birds, 
O'er the grave of Lottie Lee. 
Lottie Lee, Lottie Lee. 
I'm lonely now, so lonely, Lottie, 
Like a 
sobbing child I 
grieve and weep for thee ; 
While the merry birds are o'er me singing, 
Happy now as when you heard them Lottie Lee. 
Merry, warbling, &c. 
OH I MEET 311E AT SUNSET MY OWN BONNIE 
KATE. 
Oh 1 
meet me at sunset, my own bonnie Kate, 
By the holly bush tree, near the old meadow gate ; 
Where in childhood we wander'd the wild woods among, 
And listen'd with joy to the lark's merry- song. 
CHORUS. 
So come, love, that way at the close of the day, 
The sound of thy footstep ' tis there I 
will wait. 
Oh I 
meet me at sunset, my own love I 
pray, 
By the holly-bush tree, near the old meadow gate. 
Oh ! don't you remember, my own bonnie Kate, 
The flowers I 
pluck'd for my merry playmate ; 
When I 
carved the big K with my grandfather's knife, 
On the wither'd oak tree, for my young baby wife. 
So come, love, dr.c 
No jewels or riches have T, bonnie Kate, 
A 
strong arm to labor's my only estate ; 
And a 
heart that is honest, and constant, and true, 
Is all that I 
have, love, to offer to you. 
So conic, love, dzc.

PLEASANT MEMORIES. 
Pleasant memories softly stealing, 
Echoing thoughts of former years, 
Faces of the past revealing, 
Bathed in memory's silent tears. 
Feelings buried with the past, - 
Come like some remembrance strange; 
Joys by sorrow long o'ercast, 
Pleasant memoties wake again. 
Wake again, wake again, 
CHORUS. 
Pleasant memories softly stealing, 
Echoing thoughts of former years, 
Faces of the past revealing, 
Bathed in memory's silent tears. 
Plea,sant memories, dearest blessing 
Heaven bath given to soothe the breast, 
Life no greater charm possessing, 
Lulling aching hearts to rest. 
Hopes long faded, passed away, 
Bloom as in life's early spring. 
Dreams of many a 
happy day, 
Pleasant memories oft ye bring. 
Oft ye bring, oft ye bring, 
Pleasant memories softly stealing. 
Echoing thoughts of former years, 
Faces of the past revealing, 
Bathed in memory's silent tears.

What were life without some one to cheer ns, 
With a 
word or a 
smile on our way, 
frif ad who is faithfully near us, 
And heeds not what others may say. 
Die bravest of spirits have often

So say a

One of us owns to some failing, 
Though some may have more than the rest, 
But there is no good in heedlessly assai.ing, 
Against those who are striving- their best. 
Remember a 
word spoken complaining, 
May blight every effort and plr.n, 
Which a 
kind word would help in attaining, 
So nay a

OH, LET ME GO TO DIY HOME AGAIN. 
Oh, let me go to my home again, 
The home my childhood knew, 
'Twos there I 
dreamed that earth was fair, 
And every heart was true. 
'Tis sad to wake from pleasant dreams, 
Into a 
world of pain. 
Oh ! let my footsteps wander back 
To that dear home again. 
'Twas there my mother held my hand, 
There first my footsteps trod, 
'Twas there I 
gazed upon the stars, 
And lisped the name of God. 
Its there my only sister laid, 
Upon our garden's verge, 
And mourning winds among the flowers. 
Still chant, her nightly dirge, 
Oh I 
I 
am weary of this change, 
As here, and there, I 
rove, 
And time but rivets in the heart, 
The links of what we love. 
Then Lt me go to my childhood's home, 
And I'll no more complain, 
Tnat sacred spot, my father s 
hearth, 
lo dear old home again.

OR LET ME DREAM OF FORMER YEARS. 
Oh let me dream of former years, 
When I 
was happy, bright and gay, 
When I 
was free from grief and tears, 
And joyfully passed the time away ; 
But now these happy days are gone, 
All hopes and joy must soon depart, 
I'm left alone to weep for one. 
Who has betrayed my faithful heart. 
CHORUS. 
Oh let me dream of former years, 
When I

When I

And joyfully passed the time away. 
Oh weary are the passing hours, 
That once to me were dear and gay, 
For now my hopes like faded flowers, 
No longer bloom but pass away, 
And as I'm now by one forgot, 
For whom I

Oh grant me but the happy lot, 
To close my eyes fore'er in death.

I 
twined him, when he left me, 
A scarf, around his spear; 
Oh! has my gift bereft me

Say, have they marlr'd him for it ? 
Was it throuirli that he fell ? 
But still I'm glad he wore it—

THE FISHERMAN'S BOY. 
Down in the lowlands a 
poor boy did wanaer, 
Down in the lowlands a 
poor boy did roam, 
By his friends he was deserted, he looked so dejected, 
Cries the poor little fisherman, so far away from home, 
Oh ! where is my cot, oh ! where is my father ? 
Alas ! they are gone and caused me to roam-. 
My mother died on the pillow, my father sunk in the billow, 
Cries the poor little fisherman, so far away from home, 
Bitter was the night, and loud roared the thunder, 
The lightning did flash, and our ship was overthrown, 
I 
clasped my master round 0, I 
gained my native ground 0, 
Lost my father in the deep, far, far away from home. 
I 
waited on the beach, right round me roared the water, 
I 
waited on the beach, but alas ! no father came, 
It's now I'm forced to range, exposed to every danger, 
Cries the poor little fisherman, so far away from home. 
A lady when she heard him, she opened her window, 
In the kindest manner desired him to come, 
Tears fell from her eves as he heard his mournful cries, 
Cries the poor little fisherman, so far away from home. 
She begged of her father to find him some employment, 
She begged of her father, no more to let him roam; 
her father said, & ail grieve me, this boy shall never leave me, 
Poor boy I 
will relieve thee, so far away from borne. 
Many years he labored to serve his noble master, 
Ma, y 
years he labored, till a 
man be became, 
It's now I'll tell each strannr, the bar ! ships and the danger, 
Of a 
poor little fisherman's boy, far, far away from home.

THE GALLANT HUSSAR 
A damsel possessed of great beauty, 
She stood by her own father's gate, 
The gallant Hussars were on duty, 
To view them the maiden did wait. 
Their horsos were capering and prancing, 
Their accoutrements shone like a 
star, 
From the plains they were nearer advancing, 
She espied her young gallant Hussar. 
Their pellises were slung o'er their shoulders, 
So careless they seem'd for to ride ; 
So warlike appeared those young soldiers, 
With glittering swords by their sides ; 
To the barracks next morning so early, 
This damsel she went in her car, 
Because that she loved him sincerely— 
Young Edward, the gallant Hussar. 
It was there she conversed with her soldier, 
These words they were heard for to say— 
Says Jane, " I've a 
heart none more bolder. 
For to follow my laddy away." 
"Oh, fie I" said young Edward, " be steady 
And think of the danger of war, 
When the trumpet sounds I 
must be ready, 
So wed not your gallant Hussar." 
"For twelve months on bread and cold water, 
My parents confined me for you, 
Oh, hard-hearted friends to their daughter, 
Whose heart it is loyal and true, 
Unless they confine me forever, 
Or banish me from you afar, 
I 
will follow my soldier forever, 
To wed my gallant Hussar." 
Said Edward, " your friends you must mind them, 
Or else you are forever undone, 
They will leave you no portion behind them, 
So pray do my company shun," 
She said, " if you will be truehearted, 
have gold of my uncle's in store, 
From this time no more we'll be parted, 
I 
will wed with toy gallant Hussar." 
As he gazed on each beautiful feature, 
The tears they did fall from each eye, 
"I will wed with this beautiful creature, 
To forsake cruel war," he did cry, 
So now thev're united together, 
Friends think or I 
1,,•in now they're afar, 
Crying, " heaven bless them now and forever, 
Young Jane and her gallant Hassar." 
THE WIDOWS LAST PRAYER. 
Oh! mother dear, leave off crying, 
Your only child is by your side, 
On you all my hope relying, 
Ever since my father died ! 
My child ! my thoughts are ever on you; 
My nightly prayer for you is given; 
My health, my dear, is fast decayin ,, ; 
My soul must take its flight to Heaven I 
Come, my child, come nearer to me; 
Do not fret, do not despair : 
A parting kiss before I 
leave you, 
pin going to IllePt your father there. 
It is our lot, we must not murmur : 
It is our Great Creator's will ; 
When I 
depart this world of sorrow 
He'll be a 
Father to you still. 
She clasped her child clme to her bosom, 
While her eyes were closed in death. 
God. bless my boy ! she faintly murmured, 
It was her last exoiring breath. 
Alone and helpless stood the orpha n, 
With tearful eye and aspect wild.

De Witt's Ten Cent Romances No: 88 
'rile Partizan's Oath: 
OR, 
THE TROOPER'S REVENGE. 
No war for freedom was ever carried on in which that 
noble goddess saw so little to deplore on the part of her 
votari:s as in the glori-us one of the American Revolution. 
Not one drop of blood was uselessly shed. 
It is this splen-
did epoch which this capital romance vitaliies. 
The bold, 
brave sons of liberty make the green woods. ring with their 
rifle shots. 
The air seems tremulous with the booming of 
the bell of liberty. 
No one can read this work without 
being thrillingly interested in its striking pictures.
