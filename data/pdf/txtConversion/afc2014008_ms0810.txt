CSUN ARCHIVE

/2/98
 
Thank you.  I
' ve been fortunate enough to have received
 
several honors in recent years,  but none has been quite as
 
important or as precious to me personally as this one.  I
 
spent so much of my own learning time on this very campus,
 
while I most improbably taught in both the Music and the
 
Anthropology Departments.
 
So first I want to try and express my very real and
 
strong gratitude to the California State University at
 
Northridge,  the institution that housed me,  the
 
anthropologically and musically trained colleagues who
 
tolerated me,  the students who showed me what was what,  not
 
forgetting,  of course,  the fabled California taxpayers
 
including me
 who probably quite unwittingly paid for my
 
participation in what is to me one of the most meaningful
 
professions in the world -
-
 university teaching.
 
Academicians often down-grade the importance of what
 
they're doing,  especially the teaching part.  I guess they
 
know so much more than they believe they are transmitting in
 
the classroom that they think their efforts are ultimately
 
pointless.  But I urge you all to think carefully about film-
director Frank Capra's remarkable comment that movie
 
producers should forever be grateful that they were actually
 
allowed to speak to hundreds of people at the same time,
 
sitting there quietly,  in the dark.
 
Well,  the lights were always on at CSUN when I taught
 
there and I see they still are.  But the principle is the
 
same:  all of us involved with education -
-
 teachers,
 
students,  supporters,  taxpayers -
-
 must be grateful that we
 
have in the university system a structure that from time to
 
time allows trained and thoughtful specialists to speak at
 
least a bit of what they believe to be true and good and
 
useful for people to know.  The classroom then becomes in some
 
degree a place for experimentation,  for helping old ways lead
 
into new,
 
But let me go back to my old teaching days -
-
 and to our
 
archive. When I was teaching,  I had many goals -
-
 I wanted
 
excitement for my students,  I hoped they would see brand new
 
worlds,  especially those most imm ediately around them that
 
they so often overlooked.  I wanted them to be masters of the
 
skills of university education -
-
 writing,  analysis,
 
research,  debate.  In pusuit of these dreams,  I decided it
 
would be important for my students to experience and respond
 
to living folklore,  not just read about it.  I wanted to upset
 
their general idea that folklore was really just trite old
 
primary grade corny stuff -
-
 things like Little Red Riding
 
Hood,  or labor protest songs,  or Greek myths,  or wart cures.
 
Good for children,-- or maybe good for radicals and other
 
oddballs,  or people who died a long time ago -
-
 but I wanted
 
students to see this material today:  alive,  kicking,
 
omnipresent,  feisty,  and essentially grownup.
 
Now,  I was always honest with my students. At every
 
first class meeting I informed them that very few folklorists
 
ever made a dime being a folklorist -
 and it was highly
 
improbable that they would even make that much.  However,I
 
also pointed out that they were likely to live a lot longer
 
than earlier generations,  and that they might well need to
 
look around for things that could make those long lives that
 
they were expecting more interesting.  They might find,  if
 
they really worked at it,  that folklore is a rather special
 
discipline in that it can be pursued at any age,  without
 
complex equipment,  anywhere on the planet that there are
 
people. And it would always give them something real,
 
interesting,  and challenging to think about.
 
So I persuaded every student to take a shot at
 
documenting some of the folklore that they either sought out
 
or simply came across in their daily rounds.
 
Some of them elected to choose a particular topic.  I
 
have told this story before,  but it is especially appropriate
 
here,  so please forgive me. A lively student came to me at
 
the end of a semester and said,  "Mrs.  Hawes,  YOU taught me
 
all about how to collect folklore,  but you never told me how
 
to Stop collecting it.  I've been collecting  (hiccup Cures?)
 
and this lady lives right next door to me,  and every time I
 
come home she calls me over because she's just remembered
 
another one,  and she waits out on the porch for me.  I've
 
tried to explain to her that this was just a semester project
 
and I'm all through with it,  but she doesn't understand  and
 
I' ve begun coming down the back alley to keep from running
 
into her. What Should I do?"
 
I had little help for him.  He had,  as I pointed out,
 
gotten his  "A"  for the project; he had done it very well. Now
 
he had to start to work out how to get an equivalent A for
 
his collaborator.  He could explain to her in folklorese that
 
his
 
interest in hiccup cures had been limited to the spring
 
semester,  so she should locate an appropriate repository for
 
her new materials,  or maybe she should develop further
 
research projects on her own.  But I doubt any of those would
 
have interested her.  What she wanted was somebody to talk
 
hiccups with or maybe warts or arthritis or other generally
 
friendly topics.
 
Now this lady was not uneducated or ill - informed
 She
 
undoubtedly had the various nostrums of conventional medicine
 
in her repertoire as well as the traditional ones that
 
interested her.
 
And looking at her data overall,  much of it was quite
 
old -
 a generation or two or even three. Now,  any statement
 
by anybody,  no matter how bizarre,  that has survived over
 
generations without reinforcement by standard schooling,  or
 
by religious doctrine,  or by legal prescription,  deserves at
 
least a second look by social scientists.  Behind these
 
irradicable statements lies a kind of logic,  a certain
 
fitment,  a comfortable kind of authority,  it is no accident
 
that most traditional cures center upon conditions with which
 
standard western medicine has real difficulty.
 
You see what a tough job it is to be a folklorist,
 
trying to think seriously about those things that most of our
 
culture absolutely refuses to take seriously.
 
Think of the most fatuous childish rhymes you carry in
 
your heads: maybe "Rain,  rain,  go away" or "I see London,  I
 
see France" and then think how many other endlessly repeated
 
verbal items you would rather remember,  that would be really
 
"useful".  -
-
 your social security number? the date of your
 
spouse's birthday? if "We,  the people" start off the
 
Declaration of Independence or the Constitution? Wouldn't you
 
rather remember any of these than "Star light,  star bright"?
 
When one considers how incessantly and how passionately
 
traditional voices continue to give forth their messages,  it
 
is calamatous how few ears are tuned to their larger
 
meanings.  This is partly because figuring such meaning out is
 
extremely hard work.
 
For by the time several generations of transmitters have
 
gotten through polishing a particular item -
-
 a song,  a
 
riddle,  a tale,  a verse,  a cure,  a proverb -
-
 -- passing it on
 
and on past one elegant editor after another -
-
 -
-
 each one
 
has been boiled down to a kind of an intense elixir. And
 
fathoming just what has gone into that final composition is
 
extremely difficult--- it requires the most delicate
 
dissection techniques.
 
That is one reason why archives such as this particular
 
Folklore Archive are important.  Together with other similar
 
files,  such as the major west coast repositories at the
 
Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses of the University of
 
California,  they can all together help establish base lines
 
against which both the normal and the non-normal can be
 
measured.
 
I am going on and on about this because I believe that
 
many well-intentioned people totally mis-understand the
 
purposes and therefore the contents of folklore archives.
 
They think of them,  for example,  as a place where you
 
might go to find the printed words to all Woody Guthrie's
 
songs.  But they will probably not be there because most of
 
the people who contributed to the CSUN files at least,  were
 
the kind of ordinary joes who never heard of Woody Guthrie
 
though they might have heard his songs.  Official printed
 
versions of the Guthrie songbag  might much  more likely be
 
found in a music archive.
 
Woody and I were discussing songs one day and I remarked
 
that I thought that a part of one of his songs had totally
 
passed into the public domain,  that is,  nobody connected it
 
with him or any other songwriter -
-
 it was just what you
 
sang under certain circumstances.  (
I was thinking of the
 
chorus of "Union Maid" -
-
 "Oh you can't scare me,  I
'm
 
sticking to the union" which I have heard spontaneously sung
 
on many a picket line.)  And Woody said to me,"Bess,  that's
 
the greatest honor I'll ever get." Think how few other
 
songwriters would feel that way.
 
And now if we were talking about an historical archive,
 
a single verifiable document may establish an historical
 
fact,  and that is a very important thing to do.  But when
 
using the contents of a folklore archive,  you must remember
 
that the material recorded is simply what somebody -
-
 whoever
 
-
-
 has said that he heard from somebody else.  I should more
 
accurately have said -
-
 somebodies..
 
Now such informal communication may sometimes produce a
 
verbal testament of strong historical interest and
 
importance,  as interesting as the single verifiable
 
historical document.  There are several local poems and songs
 
in this archive that describe or comment on timely events,
 
including the Corrido de la Inundacion de la Presa de San
 
Francisquito  (
the San Francisquito dam break of 1928) .
 The
 
local composer of that ballad makes the terror and horror of
 
the event come alive in ways that no formal study could or
 
would even try to achieve. An eminent historian once remarked
 
to me that there are two kinds of historical truth -
-
 what
 
actually happened,  and what everybody thought  (
or now thinks)
 
happened.  Both,  he commented,  are vital,  especially because
 
what everybody thinks happened will probably lay the basis
 
for the next action.
 
To continue Pointing out some of the features of this
 
folklore archive,  its childrenst  section is especially hefty,
 
and if you look into it you may well find several hundred
 
reports from the San Fernando Valley of exactly the same jump
 
rope rhymes -- perhaps "Late last night and the night before,
 
twenty-four robbers come a-knocking at my door" or "Doctor,
 
doctor,  I am ill Send for the doctor over the hill" or "Blue
 
Bells,  cockle shells".  It gets boring after a while.
 
On the other hand,  this is extraordinarily impressive
 
statistical evidence of juvenile preferences,  especially when
 
lined up against the jump rope rhymes only heard once or
 
twice from the same population. And the situation extends
 
beyond California. A gifted writer has remarked that if you
 
stretched a jumprope from Bangor,  Maine to San Diego,
 
California,  all the children along that line will be jumping
 
to the same five or ten rhymes.  Now,  there is a piece of hard
 
statistical information that should set young researchers
 
salivating.  But at the same time,  where did the jump rope
 
nonconformists come from and where do they fit in?
 
Other materials in the CSUN student folklore archive
 
include personal recollections of California immigrants from
 
the south and southwest,  reminiscences from African Americans
 
searching for better job opportunities during world war two,
 
casual autobiographies by older entertainment figures,
 
vignettes of family life from rural and urban settings,
 
practical diaries of schoolyard experiences by English and
 
non-English speakers. All of them enrich and enliven our
 
understanding of just how our part of the world became what
 
it is today.  They aren't all properly organized,  neatly
 
printed,  or even correctly spelled.  Some of what's in there
 
is even offensive and vulgar,  enough so you wish you hadn't
 
read it.  Tradition includes all parts of life.
 
And I think my students of twenty/thirty years ago did a
 
marvellous  job of preserving for us the truth and the whole
 
truth as their informants saw it,  and I want to thank each
 
and every one of them right now.  They did the work;  i just
 
tried to keep up with the filing because i couldn't bear to
 
throw all that effort away.  If we had had better control of
 
video and audio techniques,  if I had had the perspective to
 
sit back and think long-range for just a few minutes,  this
 
archive might well have been better.
 
But we did what we could and,  it is what it said it was
 
all along. And what we said and did was honest. And now we
 
can begin to look forward and maybe even decide to try some
 
new ways to improve upon that great old performance
 
The Anthropology Department of CSUN has recently hired a
 
new folklorist
 What a joy.
 Dr.  Sabina Magllocco has
 
herself taken over responsibility not just for the archive of
 
student folklore that so many of us labored over but the
 
eventual development of a folklore curriculum
 She's added to
 
all this her own research concerns heralding some new
 
archival considerations.
 
So centuries come and centuries go but work and life and
 
teaching and archives go on and on and I'll tell you now,
 
I'll be right in there with you,  as long as I can keep up.  I
 
apologize for my irrepressible tendency to preach -

 I even
 
overheard a Smithsonian staff member say one time,  "Bess
 
doesn't ever let up on you,  does she?"
 And I didn't and I
 
don't,  and I never will.  There's just so much to do and it's
 
so much fun to do it.
 
Well,  let me thank again our remarkable President,
 
Blenda Wilson,  Provost Louanne Kennedy,  Dean Susan Curzon,
 
Dean Bill Flores and Dean Jorge Garcia,  my ab so lutely
 
irre
placeable daughter,  Dr.  Naomi Bishop,  the entire
 
Anthropology Department faculty and staff -

 including its
 
first chair,  Dr.  Edmund Carpenter,  who had the nerve to hire
 
me to begin with,  And then there is Barbara Rahm who marched

i
fe d
uring
 
y
our c
hildhood?
 
Bess: I
 was s
elected by my f
amily
 
(
I say t
his t
otally without rancor)
 
as the "musical one." Perhaps I
 
was. Anyway, I
 was s
et t
o l
earning
 
p
iano as s
oon as I
 was physically
 
able, and s
tudied i
t i
ntensively
 
until my t
enth year, when my
 
mother d
ied. Somehow, I
 couldn't
 
ever p
ick i
t
 up again.
 
P
lO!: Was t
here a
 l
o
t o
f
 s
inging i
n
 y
our
 f
am-
i
l
y?
 
Bess: We a
lways sang i
nformally as
 
a
 f
amily —around t
he house, dur-
i
ng car t
rips especially —and I
 
guess I
 knew a
 l
ot o
f s
ongs. I
 e
spe-
c
ially r
emember t
he t
hrill one day
 
when I
 was s
inging an o
ld r
oman-
t
ic s
ong, "
Juanita," and my mother
 
suddenly sang t
he harmony part
 
with me. Wow! That was music -
 
t
he most beautiful I
 had t
ruly e
ver
 
heard. But notice t
hat music was
 
provided by my mother and me.
 
P
lO!: And what k
ind o
f music d
id y
ou l
i
ke
 
t
o l
i
sten t
o?
 
Bess: Music emerged f
ro m our
 
l
arge V
ictrola v
ia a
 s
tack o
f 78-rpm
 
V
ictor Red Seal c
lassical r
ecordings
 
(
Bach and Beethoven, mostly). We
 
a
lso had t
he complete Mikado, as
 
Bess L
omax Hawes
 
sung by t
he D
'Oyly Carte, and a
 
small p
ile o
f 10-inchers, smuggled
 
i
n, I
 believe, by my o
lder s
ister,
 
Shirley (
a f
lapper and a great
 
Charleston dancer). She and my
 
two o
lder brothers provided us with
 
Bessie Smith s
inging "Baby Won't
 
You P
lease Co me Home" and o
ther
 
early jazz c
lassics. Mother smiled
 
with r
ather t
ight l
ips when we put
 
t
he m on, and we t
ended t
o p
lay
 
t
hem i
n her absence.
 
P
lO!: What e
lse d
o you r
emember a
bout
 
l
earning music?
 
Bess: There i
s a l
ast i
nf
luence so
 
vague I
 barely catch an edge o
f t
he
 
memory; but i
t
 s
eems t
o me a
 l
arge
 
box came one day, containing a
 l
ot
 
o
f equipment, i
ncluding a
 bunch o
f
 
d
ifferent c
elluloid b
irds that could
 
be perched on l
arge s
taf
f l
ines. My
 
s
ister believes i
t was f
ro m the
 
Montessori s
chool i

taly. The
 
Montessori s
ystem with a
ll those
 
p
lastic-bird t
oys was designed t
o
 
t
each western European musical
 
l
i
teracy —note r
eading, s
tandard
 
chord f
ormation, and so on. The
 
i
nteresting part t
o me i
s that I
 ap-
parently absorbed these principles
 
on a
 l
evel t
hat a
llowed me t
o make
 
good use o
f t
he m the r
est o
f my
 
musical l
i
fe, t
hough I
 don't r
emem-
ber how i
t a
ll worked any more.
 
How Mother was i
n t
ouch with t
hat
 
syste m i
n the early 1920s, I
 don't
 
know, and I
 don't r
emember much
 
about i
t
, but I
 probably l
earned i
t
 
i
f
 Mother had her heart s

ix months when I
 was not quite
 
16, I
 bought myself
 a
 guitar f
or $20
 
and f
igured out f
or myself how i
t
 
had t
o be p
layed. Happily, a
 previ-
ous owner had written t
he notes
 
each s
tring should be tuned t
o on
 
t
he bridge. Armed with t
hat i
nfor-
mation, I
 worked out where you
 
would have t
o hold each s
tring
 
down t
o produce a C chord, and
 
f
rom t
here a D, and on t
o g
lory.
 
Actually, I
 never was a
 particularly
 
good guitarist, and never t
ruly en-
j
oyed performing publicly, but I
 had
 
t
he f
undamentals and f
ound, i
n
 
l
ater years, t
hat I
 could t
each o
th-
e
rs as easily and imperceptibly as
 
I
 had l
earned.
 
P
lO!: So music was a
 p
retty
 s
ignificant
 p
art
 
o
f
 y
our c
hildhood
.
 
Bess: I
 t
hink t
he most important
 
thing I
 l
earned during my child-
hood was t
hat I
 could do music; I
 
understood i
t on a
 s
imple but e
s-
s
ential l
evel, and my confidence
 
never l
ef
t me af
ter t
hat, r
eally.
 
P

Bess: I
 developed guitar and t
radi-
t
ional-stringed-instru ment c
lasses
 
i
n t
he Boston a
rea as a
 f
undraising
 
device f
or t

 t
aught a mixed
 
g
roup o
f parents, and t
he l
essons
 
worked s
o well I
 s
tarted t

a
fter we moved t
o Los Angeles.
 
During the 50s and early 60s, t
hey
 
r
eally t
hrived —big r
oaring s

o meti mes
 
more —singing and p

I
 actually hadn't t
hought about t
he
 
c
lasses as being particularly impor-
t
ant until my r
ecent r
eturn t
o
 
California, where every day I
 run
 
i
nto so mebody who t
ook one o

t

 t

Bess: I
 paid very l
i
ttle a
ttention t
o
 
children's' music until I
 began t
o
 
have my own k
ids —three o
f t
hem,
 
i
n '
46, '
47, and '
48! Then I
 mostly
 
t
ried t
o r
emember t
he s
ongs and
 
baby games t
hat my parents had
 
used with me. My husband Butch
 
and I
 a
lso t
ried t
o keep t
he home
 
a
tmosphere casually musical, be-
cause t
hat was t
he way we l
iked
 
i
t—lots o
f i
nformal s
inging, r
ecord
 
p
laying, f
ooling a
round with i
nstru-
ments. So one o
f our year-old
 
babies "
sang" t
he t
une o
f "Twinkle,
 
Twinkle, L
ittle S
tar" with obvious
 
p
leasure. Another, as a
 preschooler,
 
summoned me t
o t
he back yard t
o
 
hear h
im p
lay on h
is "

wobbly arrange ment of small
 
s
tones on which he t
apped with
 
another r
ock, i
ndeed producing a
 
vaguely up and down version o
f
 
"Twinkle, Twinkle" —a song that
 
was apparently t
ops on t
he Hawes
 
Hit Parade.

 I
:
 D
id a

f
 y
our c
hildren t
ake u
p mu-
s
ical i
nstruments?
 
Bess: Yes. Later, t
hat sam e child,
 
N
ick, became obsessed with t
he
 
t
rumpet, a
t f
ar t
oo early an age. My
 
husband and I
 had, perhaps un-
wisely, decided t
o provide our
 
f
amily only with "
real" (
albeit t
oy)
 
i
nstru ments, and then we got
 
s
tuck. There was no way, armed
 
only with a
 cheap t
oy t
ru mpet, t
hat
 
N
ick could b
low a
 golden ho r
n l
ike
 
t
he Louis Aitustrong r
ecords we
 
p
layed, o
r even emulate t
he l
ocal
 
Boy Scout bugler. We d
idn't want
 
t
o r
isk h
is i
nevitable d
isillusion-
ment. But a
t t
he age o
f f
our he had
 
concluded that, i
f he only an-
nounced h
is desires f
requently,
 
l
oudly, and c
learly enough, per-
haps t
hey might be g
ranted. He was
 
deep i
n this process when Pete
 
Seeger spent a
 n
ight with us and
 
happened t
o hear N
ick's breakfast
 
l
i
tany: "
I
 w a
nna t
rumpet! Hey, dad,
 
I
 w a
nna t
rumpet!" I
t was hard t
o
 
avoid! "You know, N
ick," Pete said,
 
"
let's t
alk about t
his a
fter break-
f
ast." And af
ter breakfast he d
id
 
i
ndeed t
ake N
ick i
nto t
he back yard
 
and s
oberly d
iscussed with h
im t
he
 
f
act that i
n order t
o p
lay the
 
t
rumpet one had t
o develop an "
em-
bouchure." This e
legant quality
 
could only be obtained by d
iligent
 
practice on a
lmost anything t
hat
 
had a hole i
n i
t
, and so Pete
 
i
nstructed N
ick i
n t
he art o
f pro-
ducing sounds out o
f soda-water
 
bottles, garden hoses, and so on.
 
until I
 u
ltimately became skittish
 
about p
icking up a
lmost anything
 
a
round t
he p
lace.
 
P
lO!: D
id N
ick g
o o
n t
o
 p
lay t
he t

Bess: Yes, he d
id l
earn t
rumpet and
 
p
layed i
t
 i
n t
he h
igh-school march-
i
ng band. And eventually a
ll our
 
three children made music as
 
adults —professionally, s
e mi-pro-
f
essionally, and f
or their own
 
amazement. Our s
ix grandchildren
 
have varying degrees o
f musical
 
i
nterest. I
 do not, however, believe
 
t
hat we a
re a s
o-called "
talented

f t

t
 
now s

N DEFENSE OF "BARNEY":
 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL TV
 
For t
hose o
f you who have pushed
 
your TV out your s
econd-story win-
dow, more power t
o you! But f
or
 
mDst people i
n t
he United S
tates,
 
a
1id i
n particular f
or immigrants,
 
TV continues t
o be a powerful
 
source o
f i
nformation about t
he
 
culture, as well as a l
anguage-
learning resource. Fortunately for
 
a
ll concerned, t
here i
s educational
 
t
elevision, t
ruly the "
free c
lass-
r
oom" f
or preschool children and
 
adults. Whatever you think of
 
"Barney" (
and I

welcomes a

The "

s t
ranslated
 
i
nto Spanish and has been sung on
 
"Barney" by t
he Hispanic children
 
actors, who t
aught i
t
 t
o t
he o
thers.
 
Multiculturalis m abounds in
 
"Barney" and a
lso on "Sesa me
 
Street": t
ogether they provide a
 
musical and artistic welco me,
 
e
specially f
or newly arrived Hispan-
i
cs. I
t
 would he n
ice i

new im migrants encountered a

n t
heir dealings with "
the
 
system" were as war m and welcom-
i
ng as the characters i
n these
 
programs. I
 belabor t
his point be-
cause I
 believe children's musicians
 
shouldn't t
urn up their noses a
t
 
l
earning t
he songs on these shows.
 
They
're known and l
oved, e
specially
 
by im migrant children, and the
 
songs are r
equested a
t my chil-
dren's programs, as I
'm sure they
 
a
re a
t many o
thers'. Learning and
 
s

hem i
s just an-
o
ther way o

"Your experience counts."
 
SOME SUGGESTIONS ON
 
I
NCLUSION
 
When you a
re s
inging f
or an audi-
ence t
hat i
ncludes new immigrants
 
o
r r
efugee children, here are some
 
h
ints t
hat might make the experi-
ence more enjoyable f
or a
ll:
 
1
.
 Your f
ast, witty songs with l
ots
 
o
f f
unny words are great f
or the
 
native speakers, but t
he immigrant
 
children may miss the j
okes. Make
 
Pass It on!
 
sure t
o balance t
hose s
ongs with
 
o
thers t
hat are s
imple i
n l
anguage,
 
with a
 smaller vocabulary l
oad.
 
2
. A f
ew words o
r phrases i
n an-
o
ther l
anguage, even pronounced
 
badly, will be warmly r
eceived. I
 
r
emember t
he huge, appreciative
 
g
rins o
f a deaf couple when I
 i
n-
c
luded ASL s
igning with one song I
 
sang. They encouraged my c
lumsy
 
e
fforts, just as your immigrant l
is-
t
eners will appreciate a word, a
 
phrase, o
r a chorus i
n t
heir l
an-
guage.
 
3
. I
f
 you're performing i
n a
 s
chool,
 
i
t
's g
reat t
o have s
ong sheets avail-
able, with t
he words t
o some o
r a
ll
 
o
f your songs. A
lthough t
hey can
 
ruin a
 show i
f
 d
istributed a
t l
arge,
 
t
he sheets can be g
iven t
o t
each-
e
rs, f
or use i
n f
ollow-up activities.
 
ESL s
tudents can t
ake t
he l
yrics
 
home and s
tudy t
hem a
t t
heir l
ei-
sure, i
ncreasing t
heir satisfaction
 
with your performance.
 
4
. While your impulse may be t
o
 
draw out immigrant children, i
n an
 
a
tte mpt t
o acknowledge their
 
culture, r
e me mber that they're
 
g
rappling with a
 new i
dentity and
 
may want t
o b
lend i
n with the
 
c
rowd f
or t
he t
ime being. And when
 
immigrant children sometimes ap-
pear t
o be non-reactive during
 
programs, keep i
n mind t
hat t
hey
 
may just be unable t
o t
ake part
 
because o
f t
heir l
anguage l
imita-
t
ions o
r cultural uncertainty.
 
5
. As a
lready s
tated, don't s
corn
 
age-appropriate s
ongs f
rom educa-
t
ional t
elevision progra m ming.
 
They'll bring b
ig smiles o
f r
ecogni-
t
ion, especially f
ro m im migrant
 
children.
 
Working with l
anguage d
iversity i
s
 
just one more way children's mu-
s
ic can make a
 positive d
ifference
 
i
n young l
ives. Andale!

Other members
 jumped i

he
 
f

isions:
 
• The membership o

• P

• CMN should sponsor a
 summer
 
i

eachers, a
 p
lace t
o
 
share unusual and i

i
deas.
 
• CMN should provide support and
 
i
deas f

• There should be a

• More CMN packets should be
 
d
istributed each t

goes t
o a

• CMN should have a

• As we f
ocus on bringing new l
o-
cal people i
n
 when gatherings a
re
 
i

can a

about ways t

Multiple Languages, Multiple Learning Styles
 
by E
lise Witt
 
According to educational theorist Ho ward
 
Gardiner, there are at l
east seven i
dentifiable in-
t
elligences that we hu mans use t
o l
earn. * For a
 
l
ong t
ime our schools have emphasized just two
 
of these intelligences (
verbal/ l
inguistic and l
ogi-
cal/ mathe matical. or the "
three Rs"), with the
 
result that many children who don't l
earn easily
 
in these two s
tyles have been l
abeled "
slo w l
earn-
ers" or "
learning d
isabled."
 
W hile this article won't delve into Gardiner's
 
theory, his i
deas now infor m many t
eachers' work
 
with children, including my own. We understand
 
now that so me of us l
earn best through our ears,
 
so me through v
isual cues, so me through move-
ment that i
ncorporates our ne w kno wledge, so me
 
through interpersonal interaction, so me through
 
self-ref
lection, and so me through s
inging. And just
 
as a musician i
s s
tronger i
f she can l
earn and
 
perceive music both by ear and by reading writ-
t
en notation, so we a
ll can broaden our minds by
 
s
trengthening our skills in a
ll seven-plus i
ntelli-
gences.
 
W hat f
ollows are l
esson p
lans f
or t
eaching two
 
international songs, using multiple approaches
 
that are more inclusive of s
tudents' d
ifferent l
earn-
ing s
tyles and backgrounds.
 
SETUP
 
Ages o
r grades: I
've had great success (with a
ttitude
 
adjust ments!) i
n using both o
f these l
esson p
lans with
 
k
indergarteners through h
igh s
choolers; most f
re-
quently used f
or e
le mentary grades 1
-6.
 
Class s
ize: One c
lass o
f up t
o 30 s
tudents.
 
Space needed: One c
lassroo m, with s
tudents i
n a
 c
ircle,
 
e
ither s
eated a
t desks, s
tanding, or s
itting on the f
loor.
 
T
ime needed: 10-20 minutes per song, t
o s
tart; s
ee
 
i
deas f
or using "Moja" over several weeks.
 
Equipment: Guitar, p
iano, or o
ther i
nstru ment can be
 
f
un t
o acco mpany the songs, but i
s not essential.
 
S
inging i
s the key.

 NEW LANGUAGE
 
Every l

K
iswahili, or American S
ign Language —was c
reaieJ
 
because so meone had so mething r
eally important t
hat
 
t
hey wanted t
o communicate t
o another person. So t
hcv
 
c
reated sounds or, i
n the case o
f s
ign l
anguages. ges-
tures/signs. As I
'm t
eaching l
essons i
nvolving songs
 
i
n l
anguages o
ther t
han English, I
 l
ike t
o t
ell children
 
a
 s
tory about what i
t
 was l
ike f
or me, born i
n Switzer-
l
and where everyone around me spoke German, t
o
 
move t
o the United States a
t the age o
f t
hree and sud-
denly be surrounded by English i
n nursery s
chool. At
 
f
irst I
 thought these new sounds were t
he weirdest
 
thing I
'd ever heard; when I
 t
ried t
he m out, t
hey f
elt
 
s
trange i
n my mouth and t
ickled my t
ongue. But be-
cause I
 wanted t
o know the i
nteresting things my
 
s
chool mates were t
elling each o
ther, I
 opened my cars,
 
imitated the new sounds, and, l
i
ttle by l
i
ttle, began t
o
 
understand. You or so me o
f t
he children you t
each
 
may have s
imilar s
tories t

lass. Do-
i
ng t
his helps everyone t
o embrace the s
trangeness o
l
 
t
rying out the songs i
n these l
esson p
lans.
 
REPETITION
 
After t
eaching these songs f
or the f
i
rst t
ime, make sure
 
you r
epeat the m a
t l
east one more day. We never t
ruly
 
l

I

 r
eco m mend that you t

f you're
 
dependent on a

you're s

"Moja": Lesson Plan
 
Step 1
. At t
he beginning o
f t
his l
esson, t
ell t
he s
tu-
dents t
hat Kiswahili i
s t
he o
ff
icial name o
f a
 
l
anguage spoken i
n Africa. Swahili
 i
s t
he na me
 
of
ten used t
o r
efer t
o a
 particular g
roup among
 
t
he many peoples who speak i
t
, and t
he pre-
f
ix k
i means "
language." Explain t
hat t
here
 
a
re more t
han 2
,000 l
anguages spoken on t
he
 
continent o
f Africa. I
f
 you walk only as f
ar as
 
f
ro m your s
chool t
o your house (
or choose
 
another example o
f about 2-5 miles), people
 
might be speaking a
 d
if
ferent l
anguage! So i
n
 
Africa, there a
re s
everal "
trade l
anguages"
 
used over l
arge geographic a
reas, making i
t
 
possible f
or people who come f
rom many d
if-
f
erent l
anguage g
roups t
o communicate with
 
each o
ther. I
n more t
han 9
 countries i
n East
 
Africa, many people speak t
heir e
thnic g
roup's
 
l
anguage a
t home, but use K
iswahili when
 
they go t
o market o
r o
ther p
laces where t
hey
 
will i
nteract with people f
rom o
ther l
anguage
 
g
roups. Take t
his opportunity t
o l
ook a
t a
 map
 
o
f Africa and f
ind one such country, Kenya,
 
i
n t
he middle o
f t
he eastern coast. The o
ther
 
countries a
re Congo, Somalia, Tanzania, Za m-
b
ia, Moza mbique, Malawi, Burundi, and
 
Rwanda. Locate t
hese on t
he map as well.
 
Step 2
. Teach t
he numbers 1
-10 i
n American S
ign
 
Language (
see ASL chart). Have s
tudents t
ry
 
t
he m f
irst on one hand, t
hen on t
he o
ther, t
o
 
practice being ambidextrous (
one o
f my f
avor-
i
te words). They might even t
ry t
hem with both
 
hands a
t once.
 
Step 3
. Using t
he s
ign numbers, t
each t
he numbers
 
1
-10 i
n K
iswahili. As you show t
he s
ign and
 
say t
he number, have t
he children mirror and
 
e
cho you.
 
Step 4
. When I
'm t
eaching t
he l
esson, t
his i
s t
he point
 
where I
 get out my guitar t
o t
each t
he melody
 
t
o our a
lready-learned number-lyrics. I
 t
ell t
he
 
s
tudents that i
f! p
lay t
he guitar, I
 won't have
 
any hands l
ef
t t
o do t
he s
ign numbers. So!
 
bring up s
everal s
tudents t
o be "
sign l
eaders"
 
o
r "
sign mirrors."
 
Step 5
. S
ing t
he numbers i
n K
iswahili (
see "Moja"song
 
sheet). Teach t
hem one a
t a
 t
ime, using e
cho-
i
ng, just as i
t
's sung i
n t
he s
ong. Then put a
ll
 
t
ogether and s
ing and s
ign "Moja." Be sure t
o
 
r
eally ham i
t
 up on nu mbers 8
 and 10, which
 
are drawn out i
nto l
ong running-note phrases.
 
The l
essons l
earned i
n "Moja" can be s
tretched out
 
over s
everal weeks. Here a

s
tudents who know the numbers 1

an-
guage t
o t
each t
hem t
o everyone. Students who speak
 
o
ther l

s a
 wonderful way t
o
 
l
et ESL (

ind you have a

and can t

Conduct community r
esearch. Ask the s

o t
each their f
ellow

and t

tudents some
 
examples. One i
dea could be t
o ask t
heir waitperson

estaurant t
o t
each the m the nu mbers

hem, while t
hey're a

Encourage v

U
r
owing
 up with my two
 
 
 brothers, we a
lways used
 
t
o p
lay "Cowboys and I
ndians."
 
Chris was a
lways Chief Cherokee:
 
Johnny would be Wild B
ill o
r Gen-
e
ral Custer. A l
ot o
f t
imes they'd
 
want me t
o be Annie Oakley, o
r
 
s
omething l
ike t
hat, but I
 a
lways
 
wanted t
o be Medicine Man or
 
Rainmaker. And I
'd make up a
 
chant and a dance, and a magic
 
potion (
usually out o
f
 d
irt and holly
 
berries —the d
irt would make a
 
neat dust c
loud, and t
he holly ber-
r
ies would pelt whoever was nearby
 
when I
 t
ossed out t
he magic po-
(
ion). And we would do a
 dance and
 
run a
round t
ogether.
 
As children, t
he notion o
f
 r
itual was
 
s
till i
ngrained i
n our beings. We
 
s
till understood, f

out and make potions and chants.
 
We just i

lub, where t

re a
ll
 
uniform i
n shape.
 
There used t
o be a
 t
ime when we
 
danced, and t
he r
ain came. Our
 
symbolic gestures meant so me-
t
hing, not just t
o ourselves, but t
o
 
our f
a mily, our t
ribe, our co m-
munity. And l
ook how many com-
munities t
here used t
o be —diverse
 
and unique and special. Yet t
hey
 
a

he r
ain came. They
 
a

away. They were connected t

how t
o dance. We t
hink we know
 
what t
he world i
s. Everything i
s
 
explained i
n meteorological t
erms
 
and mathe matical equations.
 
Yet I
 have wondered t
his past year,
 
Who was dancing? Who are the
 
parents o
f E
l N
:
iño? Who howled
 
and brought t
he winds and t
orna-
does t
hat pulverized t
he Southeast
 
l
ast winter, during a
 t
ime when t
or-
nadoes a
re r
are?
 
Or have these things happened
 
because we've s
topped dancing?
 
We've s
topped c
elebrating t
he r
ain
 
and t
he sun and the t
ides and the
 
s
easons, because, mathe matically,
 
we've l
earned t
hat t
hey will occur
 
with o
r without us. R
ight?
 
Lately, I
've come t
o d
isagree. And
 
i
t
's my i
nvolvement with d
irecting
 
community performance that has
 
a
ltered my prior Newtonian/Dar-
winian v
iew o
f l
i
fe. Working with
 
t
he co mmunities t
hat I
 have i
n t
his
 
past year, I
've s
een miracles. I
n
 
our songs and s
tories —and yes,
 
dances —we d
id so mething. We
 
changed t
he t
ide. We d
iscovered
 
community where i
t was believed
 
t
o have been d
issolved —or a
t l
east
 
on i

I
 witnessed t
his most specifically
 
while working with the Mennonite
 
Group i
n Newport News, Virginia.
 
The open l
and that once t
ied t
o-
gether t
he Mennonites —formerly
 
an agriculturally based com mu-
n
ity —is now gone. A l
ine i

P

, asks, "How do you

row-
Pass It On!
 
i
ng, without t
he o
ld way o
f l
i
fe,
 
without t

d
iscovered how: You bring the
 
people t

e me mber
 
what i
s important, o
r even what
 
you t
hink i

share your past and c
reate new

o. You get t
he chil-
dren and t
he g
ra dpaients and t
he
 
next-door neighbor, and you ask
 
one o
ther what i
s peculiar t
o each
 
o

hen you gather t
he
 
s

urn t
hem i
nto a

s
 
a

And yet t
here i
s no personal c

by a sold-out f

Midwest Gathering
 
i
n the
 
Heart of the Beast
 
by Sandy Byer
 
T
n October o
f 1997, a
t the
 
 
CMN National Gathering i
n
 
Nashville, Tennessee, t
here was a
 
panel d
iscussion on co m munity
 
building, i
n which CMNers ex-
p
lored (
1) how we could connect t
o
 
t
he co m munities we l
ive i
n and (
2)
 
how we could r
elate t
o the co m mi i
 
n
ities i
n which we hold our natioi i
 i
 
and r
egional gatherings. Spurn
 
on by this d
iscussion, Barb T
ils
 
volunteered t
o help organize I
I
 
1998 CMN Midwest Regional Gath-
e
ring t
o coincide and i
nterweave
 
with the annual spring May Day
 
celebrations i
n Minneapolis. Barb
 
was j
oined i
n her e
fforts by o
thers
 
f
ro m t
he Midwest Region, and her
 
i
dea was enthusiastically endorsed
 
by the organizers o
f the c
ity's an-
nual May Day Parade and Festival.
 
I
n r
esponse t
o the CMN proposal,
 
t
he the me selected f
or the May Day
 
events was "music," c
reating a
 wel-
co ming environ ment f
or CMN
 
participation.
 
I
 was t
otally i
nspired by
 
t
he c
ommitment t
o
 
c
ommunity demonstrated
 
by t
he artists who l
ive
 
and work t
here and by
 
t
he neighborhood council
 
t
hat helps support t
hem.
 
Although I
 am not an of
f
icial me m-
ber o
f t

 decided
 
t
o a
ttend f
or a
 variety o
f r
easons,
 
and I
 am so g
lad that I
 d
id. I
 am
 
very interested in co m munity
 
building through art r
ight now, so
 
I
 began my Minneapolis v
isit with
 
an i
ntroduction t
o Barb's section
 
o
f the c
ity, known as Powderhorn.
 
I
 f
ound myself entering a model

neighborhood that has i

t
 a

trong t
ra-

people are working t

 good and enriched p
lace

o l
ive, by using the arts as an
 
i
ntegral part o
f co m munity organiz-
i
ng and co m munity building.
 
Fro m the mo ment o
f my arrival i
n
 
Powderhorn, Barb helped me meet
 
and interview e
ight artists and
 
ad ministrators, i
n addition t
o a
t-
t
ending and participating i

CMN gathering and the c

PO WDERHORN PARK
 
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION
 
The f
irst person Barb i
ntroduced
 
me t
o was Akh miri Sekhr-Ra, who
 
i
s the arts organizer f
or the Pow-
derhorn Park Neighborhood Asso-
c
iation (
PPNA). As the l
iaison f
or
 
artists and the PPNA, one of
 
Akh miri's major r
oles i
s support-
i
ng the d
ifferent arts projects hap-
pening i
n Powderhorn. I
t i
s quite
 
wonderful that the association de-
c
ided t
o use c
ity f
unding f
ro m the
 
Neighborhood Revitalization Fund
 
t
o help pay f
or Akh miri's position,
 
so that she could assist i
n the
 
f
undraising f
or the artists i
n the
 
co m munity. A f
ew o
f the projects
 
she supports are ArtPower at
 
ArtStop, the Powderhorn Writers
 
Festival, and Crepuscule: as well
 
as a

The PPNA a

which the artists and arts pro-

eceived by the puppet
 
makers, who patiently explained
 
t
heir work t
o us. Before we l
ef
t, we
 
sang t
he songs t
hat we were t
o s
ing
 
i
n t
he parade, and a
 bunch more
 
besides.
 
I
 spoke l
ater with Sandy Spieler,
 
one o
f hearts o

f t

and was impressed by her deep
 
spiritual s
ense and her dedication
 
t
o community a
rt. She r
emarked
 
how wonderful our v
isit t
o her t
he-
a
ter had been, on t

ight before
 
t

hat we gave
 
t

o

and f
inish a

As noted earlier, i
n honor o
f CMN's
 
Minneapolis gathering and our par-
t
icipation i
n t
he f
estival, "music"
 
was the the me chosen f
or this
 
year's event. Through i
ts many
 
c
reatures, the parade explored
 
s
ound and s
ong, as well as s
ilence;
 
our musical past; t
hose t
hat s
i
lence
 
us; and, o
f course, t
he j
oy o
f s
ing-
i
ng. This i
s where we CMNers
 
j
oined i
n and sang our hearts out.
 
CMN a
lso participated f
ro m the
 
audience during t
he cere mony and
 
a
t t
he K
ids' Stage during t
he f
esti-
val.
 
To quote again f
rom the CMN f
lyer,
 
"
From i
ts humble beginnings as a
 
small neighborhood event, May
 
Day has g
rown t
o be Minnesota's
 
quintessential spring celebration,
 
drawing t
housands o
f people each
 
year t
o Powderhorn Park.... Over
 
t
he past 24 years. May Day has
 
deepened i
nto a
joyous c
elebration;
 
an awe-inspiring pageant o
f g
iant
 
20-foot puppets, f
loats, masked
 
and costu med c
reatures, and r
ev-
e
lers, marching down the s
treet i
n
 
af
f
irmation o

hese words could be the
 
 
 motto f
or our working r

ionship, an unusual b
lending o
f
 
t
he t
alents o
f two performing art-
i
sts f
ro m very d

tory o
f our co ming
 
t
ogether begins s
everal years ago
 
a
t an a

were d
iscussing, over coffee, our
 
f
eelings about being women i
n t
he
 
a
rts and how, i
f
 we could a
ll net-
work more, we could r
eally help
 
each o
ther. Sarah b
lurted out en-
t
husiastically, "We should do
 
s
omething t
ogether someti me!" Kay
 
l
ooked a
t her b
lankly and said, "But
 
what would we s
ing?" And o
f
 course
 
Sarah f
elt pretty s
tupid t
hen, be-
cause she had no i
dea what we
 
two —a f
olk s
inger and an opera
 
s
inger —would do t
ogether. So t
here
 
we sat, s
taring i
nto our cof
fee cups,
 
tr
ying t
o t
hink o
f how we could col-
l
aborate. I
t
 t
ook us about f

t

 have come
 
t

s
cribe a

The I

 guide the
 
F
olk-opera c
ollaborators, Sarah Goslee
 
Reed a
nd Kay Raplenovich
 
s

n writing t
heir own op-
e
ras. They c
reate the s
tory, the
 
l
ibretto and t
he music, t
he designs,
 
t
he s
ets, and t
he costu mes and
 
props. They a
lso perform on s
tage
 
and are t
he back-stage c
rew.
 
The s
tudents choose which area o
f
 
t
he project t
hey want t
o work on.
 
Their t
alents b
lossom as they work
 
i

tory, which might be based on
 
t
heir l

ead, s

orm, with arias that com-
municate t
he deep f

f t
he
 
characters, t
he composers s
et t

words t
o music.
 
Because I
 am not a prolific song-
writer, i
t
 i
s an i
ncredible
 j
oy t
o have
 
my f
r
iend Sarah come i
n a
t t

point and share the songwriting
 
process with me. When she shares
 
her method o
f writing songs, t

he g
if
ts
 
o
f t
his p
lanet t
hat i
s our home.
 
Our p
lanet i
s part o
f a
 wondrous
 
universe i
n which, I
 believe, every-
t
hing coexists i
n a s
tate o
f i
nter-
dependence. Based on t
he principle
 
o
f "
all f
or one and one f
or a
ll," our
 
natural s
tate o
f being i
s one o
f
 
unity, a
 sacred t
rust imbued with
 
openhearted g
raciousness and gen-
e
rosity. To me, t
his means t
hat our
 
r
elationship t
o what i
s outside us
 
necessitates s
eeing t
he s
elf as t
he
 
o
ther, and t
he o
ther as t

elf
. I
t
 
necessitates l
iving with caring and
 
c
o mpassion i
n our words and ac-
t
ions, and i
t r
equires r
espect and
 
t
olerance i

ntentions.
 
Even so, we hu mans so meti mes
 
r
elate i
n very hateful and v
iolent
 
ways. Through materialis m and
 
t
reed, which I
 believe are bred by
 
our f
ear and i
nsecurity, we r
ob
 
ourselves o
f our i
ntegrity and i
n-
t
rinsic s
ense o
f justice. All t
oo

I

know t

re i

t
han what we a
re t
old every day by
 
t
he i
ncessant barrage o
f negative
 
and destructive messages about
 
us. I
 know t
hat we are more t

war mongers, g

and s
elfish i

 know
 
t

by Bob B
lue
 
eachers and administrators
 
 
 a
t t
he Fort R
iver E
lementary
 
School, where I
 work as a
 volun-
t
eer, consider i
t important f
or
 
children t
o know about and appre-
c
iate cultural d
iversity. What
 
happens during a t
ypical day a
t
 
Fort R
iver f
requently t
ouches on
 
s
ome aspect o
f cultural d
iversity.
 
Of course, t
here a
re o
ther t
hings
 
t
o t
hink about —awareness o
f and
 
concern f
or t
he natural environ-
ment; caring about each o
ther;
 
l
earning t
o r
ead, write, and com-
pute; and much more. But the
 
t
eachers and administrators a
t t
he
 
Fort R
iver School do a
 l
ot t
o f
ocus
 
on d
iversity.
 
Margaret S
immons, one o
f t
he par-
ents o
f two children who a
ttended
 
t
he Fort R
iver School, decided t
hat
 
cultural d
iversity deserved more
 
emphasis t
han i
t
 was getting i
n t
he
 
r
egular curriculum. Rather than
 
s
tart a
 petition and/or o
rganize a
 
protest march, she acted on t
he as-
su mption t
hat the t
eachers and
 
administrators, f
or one r
eason o
r
 
another, were not f
ree t
o devote any
 
more t
ime o
r energy t
o making cul-
tural d
iversity a more prominent
 
part o
f t
he curriculum —that t
hey
 
were a
lready doing what they
 
could.
 
Local musicians
 
r
epresenting
 
Cambodian, Puerto
 
Rican, and African-
American cultures
 
played and sang
 
music and danced
 
with such energy
 
that the whole room
 
seemed t
o dance and
 
s
ing a
long.
 
And so Margaret and s
everal o
ther
 
parents decided t
o arrange an
 
evening assembly a
t t
he Fort R
iver
 
School, devoted t
o cultural d
i-
versity. Children and adults r
epre-
s
enting s
everal cultures prepared
 
musical performances t
hat gave us
 
t
astes o
f t
heir cultures. Local mu-
s
icians r
epresenting Cambodian,
 
Puerto R
ican, and African-Ameri-
can cultures p
layed and sang mu-
s
ic and danced with such energy
 
that the whole r
oom s
ee med t
o
 
dance and s
ing a
long.
 
F
irst t
here was a
 t
rio o
f Cambodian
 
musicians. They p
layed music
 
most children and adults i
n the
 
audience had never heard before.
 
I
t wasn't t
he s
low, quiet, penta-
t
onic sound so me people I
 spoke
 
t
o had expected t
o hear, but nev-
ertheless, i
t was music that
 
brought broad smiles t
o l
ots o
f
 
f
aces. And several Ca mbodian
 
children d
id so me dances they
 
had r
ehearsed, wearing t
radi-
t
ional Cambodian c
lothing.
 
The music f
rom Puerto R
ico made
 
everyone f
eel l
ike dancing; I
 could
 
s
ee l
ots o
f bodies r
ocking —lots
 
o
f people who probably wanted t
o
 
get up and dance, but weren't sure
 
t
hat would be a
ll r
ight. By t
he end
 
o
f that performance, there were
 
p
lenty o
f
 people dancing, proof
 t
hat
 
music, an i
nternational l
anguage,
 
o
ften t
ells us what's a
ll r
ight t
o do.
 
And t
hen about 40 African-Ameri-
can children danced out t
o t
he beat
 
o
f
 an African drum. Their spirit was
 
contagious, and again, i
t d
idn't
 
t
ake l
ong f
or many audience r
ner
n-
bers t
o j
oin i
n.
 
Throughout t
he f
estivities, t
here
 
was a
lso g
reat potluck f
ood avail-
able t
o t
aste, f
ro m the cultures
 
r
epresented.
 
This multicultural f
estival hap
-
pened i
n t
he evening, not during
 
t
he s
chool day, and i
t had been
 
arranged by parents and children,
 
not t
eachers and administrators.
 
School personnel were there,
 
t
hough, and i
t
 was c
lear that they
 
g
reatly appreciated what was go-
i
ng on.
 
Amherst i
s a culturally d
iverse
 
community, and a
 f
ew parents who
 
cared about r
ecognizing and c
el-
ebrating t
hat d
iversity were able
 
t
o mobilize and bring t
ogether
 
musicians i
n a j
oyous celebra-
t
ion.

encouraging greater d

within our o

s a
 
p
lace where members can connect
 
and f
ind opportunities t

appreciate one another.
 
Naturally, we have many o
f the
 
same s
truggles as t

ar
 
as we'd l
ike, e

From here on, I
'm
 
going t

pects o

Everyone i

acial
 
d
ivisions i
s adversely a
ffected i
n
 
some way by t
hat oppression, so
 
i
t
's i
n everyone's best i
nterests t
o
 
end i
t
. I
n t
he United States, white
 
people (
l
ike me) are t
he ones with
 
the built-in "
skin privilege." Be-
cause o
f
 t
hat privilege, white people
 
must assume much o
f t
he r
espon-
s
ibility f
or healing r
acism. We must
 
do much o
f
 t
he change work within
 
and among ourselves, by l
earning
 
about t
he destructive e
ffects o
f
 r
ac-
i
sm on ourselves and o
thers and
 
by l
ooking deep within our i
ndi-
v
idual s
elves t
o f
ind r
acism's h
iding
 
p
laces. Yet, s
ome healing can only
 
be done with t
he participation o
f
 
people who a
re t
he objects o
f our
 
r
acism, who can show us t
he many
 
ways i
n which we're unaware o
f
 
how we act r
acist. Therein l
ies a
 
d
ilemma: People o
f color have no
 
obligation t
o assist white people
 
with this work, but without the
 
help o
f
 people o
f
 color, white people
 
can't complete t
he healing.
 
All o
f us, i
n a
ll e
thnic and r
acial
 
g
roups, hear t
he same messages
 
about each o
ther f
ro m society.
 
People o
f

re bombarded with
 
negative messages about the m-
s
elves. S
ince we humans t
end t
o
 
l
ive up t
o what i
s expected o
f us, t
o
 
beco me who we believe we are,
 
many people o

t
ake on t
hese negative images as
 
part o
f their own i
dentities and
 
even apply t
hose racist s
tandards
 
t
o each o
ther. I
f
 you're a
 person o
f

f your challenges may
 
be t
o work on t
his i
nternalized op-
pression. This i
s a
lso t
rue f
or those
 
i

negative messages about their

Yes, t
his s
tuff i

f
 i
t

we'd have solved i

who had "

t t
he same way
 
we d
id —from t
heir e
lders and t
he
 
society o
f t
heir t
imes.
 
What t
o do? Here are some sugges-
t
ions I
 have f
or i
ndividual white
 
people:
 
1
.
 Be aware. Pay a
ttention t
o how
 
your associates o
f o
ther r
aces are
 
being t
reated i
n g
roup s
ituations,
 
such as a
t CMN f
unctions. Speak
 
up p
lainly, but gently and r
espect-
f
ully, about what needs changing.
 
2
. L
isten t
o your associates f
rom
 
o
ther r
acial g
roups. Make space f
or
 
t
hem t
o t
ell you about their own
 
experiences.
 
3
. F
ind and participate i
n organi-
zations or groups working on
 
r
acism i
ssues.
 
4
. Attend s
ome events organized by
 
persons o
f color that are open t
o
 
t
he public o
r with which you have
 
s
ome connection. See what you can
 
l
earn. Experience what i
t
 f
eels l
ike
 
t
o be i
n t
he minority.
 
5
. I
f
 you don't a
lready, by next f
all
 
be sure you have i
n your l
i
fe a
t l
east
 
one person o
f color you're c
lose t
o,
 
sharing each o
ther's ho mes and
 
enjoying social activities t
ogether.
 
6
. I
nvite one or more persons o
f
 
color t
o a
 CMN event and urge t
hem
 
t
o
 j
oin. Be an a
lly, a
 buddy, i
n help-
i
ng t
he m f

Pass It On!
 
And here a
re s
ome i
deas f
or i
ndi-
v
idual people o
f color:
 
1
.
 Consider t
aking on a t
eaching
 
r
elationship with a
 white person,
 
helping the m understand how
 
white privilege and r
acism a
ffect
 
you and your g
roup.
 
2
. Work on your i
nternalized r
ac-
i
sm. F
ind and participate i
n g
roups
 
working on t
his i
ssue.
 
3
. Bring o
thers o
f your g
roup t
o
 
CMN events, and help make t
he m
 
welcome.
 
4
. I
nvite CMN members o
f a
ll col-
o
rs t
o your g
roup's events.
 
5
. Re main open t
o f
riendships
 
with white people. Personal r
ela-
t
ionships provide everyone with
 
opportunities t
o c
lose t
he gap o
f
 
understanding caused by r
acism
 
and t
o s
ee more c
learly t
he human-
i
ty we have i
n common.
 
F
inally, as an o
rganization, CMN
 
could be t
hinking about t
he f
ollow-
i
ng:
 
1
.
 Keep doing what we're doing well,
 
and keep l
ooking f
or ways t
o do
 
better.
 
2
. Seek out o

members a
re predominantly people

Bess: Just l
ike t
he gruesome o
ld
 
f
airy t
ales, many o
f t
he songs our
 
children casually l
earn and r
emem-
ber f
orever deal with the great
 
subjects —love, hatred, passion,
 
death, t
reachery, courage. Both
 
children and adults need t
o l
earn
 
how t
o t
alk about t
hese t
hings, and
 
f
or my money, "Barbara A
llen" o
r
 
"Who K

r "Old
 
B
lue" a
re solid ports i
n t
he s
torm,
 
as solid as "
Little Red R
iding Hood"
 
and "Hansel and Gretel." They've
 
l
asted a
 l
ong, l

endurance i
s a

have been drowned out i

years by t

haps. I
 r
emember noting, when I
 
f

n t
he 50s,
 
that though I
 d
idn't of

"Hide-and-Seek" p
layed i
n San
 
Fernando neighborhoods, there
 
was a
 s
trangely s
imilar game called
 
"Marco Polo" e
choing through t
he
 
backyard swi m ming pools. Per-
sonally, I
 r
eco m mend that you
 
announce t
he death o
f children's
 
t
raditional p
lay activities with some
 
r
estraint. I
 hardly ever do i
t any
 
more. Truly useful, important, ben-
ef
icial, supportive material rarely

When my children came  (
three of them in a total of 2 1/2
 
years,  no twins)  I began to concern myself more specifically
 
with music for,  of,  by,  and about children. Looking at my own
 
there seemed to me to be variations in the amount and
 
intensity of interest each of my particular infants showed in
 
music,  and these remained relatively stable as they matured,
 
though I never really reached any conclusions as to which
 
child was more or less "talented".  Indeed as I went on
 
teaching and mothering I began to feel that the word
 
"interest" should be often if not always,
 substituted for
 
)
 )
 
the word "talent"
 
My son appeared to be the child most actively
 
interested in what one might call the "physics of musical
 
instruments" and he once requested my attendance in the
 
backyard to listen to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" played on
 
"my rocks".  "My rocks" turned out to be an irregular
 
assemblage of pebbles,  each of which,  when struck by another,
 
did indeed have a slight variation in pitch. And then when
 
struck by someone determined to wrest "Twinkle Twinkle Little
 
Star" out of them,  they did a fine job indeed.
 
The older girls paid less attention to this element.
 
One did stun me by distinctly babbling "Twinkle Twinkle
 
Little Star"  (
obviously a big song in our family)  before she
 
could truly speak;  another,  older,  more sophisticated and
 
5u
 ...
 
more interested in complex narratives,  actohi
od us all by
 
her mastery of longer and more wordily complex songs.
 
In all of this hullabaloo of babies and little ones
 
moving in all kinds of directions -
-
 musical, poetic,  and
 
complex -
-
 it began to seem to me that there were two major
 
kinds of childrens songs -
-
 songs that children made or had
 
made for themselves and sang mostly to other children  (game
 
5 4'ngs,  "naughty songs",  endless songs and the like)  and
 
songs that grownups had either sel
cted or written
 
themselves as appropriate and even "good" for children.  There
 
was overlap of course.
 
-
 -
7
 
The grownup songs
 e sometimes
 e1 
tcd
-it
 an
 
earlier
 adult repertoire -
-
 "Frog Went A-Courting"
 
"Who Killed Cock Robin" etc.  Many such songs are songs about
 
animals,
adults seem to feel that all kinds of behavior can
 
be harmlessly discussed if only an animal did it and children
 
appear to agree.
 
L\ AJ\-&
 
Some l
idult songs are selected out by children
 
themselves; my lively pre-schoolers
 picked up a song from
 
a Pete Seeger record that they sang loudly every time we went
 
to the bank for an entire summer -
-
But the banks are made of marble
 
With a gu/ard at every door
 
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
 
That the,
' f
irmer's sweated for.
 
There's ro-tb-i g- to be done about that kind of thing;  it too
 
will pass.  But it is important to bear in mind that children
 
a
 
are payin
attent±on to the words of the songs they sing and
 
hear.
 Silly,  political,  complex,  romantic,  religious,  sexy,
 
tragic,  whatever -
-
 the words go into the memory and stay
 
there until again activated.  Just like the gruesome old fairy
 
tales,  many of the songs our children casually learn and
 
remember forever deal with the great subjects -
-
 hatred,
 
-
r
 •
•
 
love,  passion,  death. f
 t
r need to learn about how to talk
 
about these things,  and for my money,  "Barbara Allen" or "Who
 
Killed Cock Robin" or "Old Blue" are solid ports in a storm,
 
as solid as "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Hansel and
 
Gretel".They've lasted a long long time. And always remember,
 
it makes a big difference if you're sitting in your mother's
 
lap when you hear about these things.
 
The songs that children make up themselves or learn from
 
other children are also pretty down to earth.  Furthermore,
 
some are remarkably stable,  and have lasted centuries,
 
suggesting some
 -ee of importance.  Such songs often
 
accompany traditional dances,  clapping patterns,  chasing or
 
partner choosing games;  some are just sung in moments of
 
group joy or individual reflection.

INTERVIE W -
 CHILDRENS MUS.
 
I am writing under a handicap since my computer has
 
managed to chew up your initial request. As I recall,  it had
 
to do with my early musical life.
 
I was selected by my family  (
I say this totally without
 
rancor)  as the "musical one" -
-
 perhaps I was. Anyway I was
 
set to learning piano as soon as I was physically able and
 
studied it intensively until my tenth year when my mother
 
died.  Somehow I couldn't ever pick it up again.
 
We had always sung as a family though,  informally,
 
around the house,  during car trips especially,  and I guess I
 
knew a lot of songs.  I especially remember the thrill one day
 
when I was singing an old romantic song,  "Juanita" and my
 
mother suddenly sang the harmony part with me. Wow.  That was
 
Music,  the most beautiful I had truly ever heard.  But notice,
 
that Music was provided by my mother and me.
 
The other Music emerged from our large Victrola via a
 
stack of 78 rpm Victor Red Seal classical recordings  (Bach
 
and Beethoven mostly) .
 We also had the complete Mikado,  as
 
sung by the D"Oyly Carte,  and,a small pile of ten inchers,
 
smuggled in I believe by my older sister,  Shirley  (
a flapper
 
and a great Charleston dancer) .
 She and my two older brothers
 
provided us with Bessie Smith singing "Baby Won't You Please
 
Come Home" and other early jazz classics. Mother smiled with
 
rather tight lips when we put them on and we tended to play
 
them in her absence.
 
A last influence so vague I barely catch an edge of the
 
mnemory; but it seems to me a large box came one day
 
containing a lot of equipment including a bunch of different
 
celluloid birds that could be perched on large staff lines;
 
my sister believeds it was from the Montessori school in
 
Italy;  how mother was in touch with that system in the early
 
20s I don't know and I don't remember much about it,  but I
 
probably learned it if mother had her heart set on it.
 
So -
-
 when I went to Europe for six months when I was
 
not quite 16,  I bought myself a guitar for $20.00 and figured
 
out for myself how it had to be played. Happily a previous
 
owner had written the notes each string should be turned to
 
on the bridge. Armed with that information I worked out where
 
you would have to hold each string down to produce a G chord
 
and from there a D and on to glory. Actually,  I never was a
 
particularly good gutarist and never truly enjoyed performing
 
publicly but I had the fundamentals and found in later years
 
that I could teach others as easily and imperceptably as I
 
had learned.
 
Actually,  I think the most important thing I learned
 
during my childhood was that I  
could do music,  I understood
 
it on a simple but eventually essential level and my
 
confidence never left me after that,  really.

brother,  John A,  and Alan Lomax,  are distinguished names in
 
the history of American folklore studies.
 
Her professional career has been varied.she has taught
 
American folk instruments,  written songs,  performed,  and made
 
films;  she is co-author of a book on African American

local,  regional and state offices to help carry out its basic
 
activities of identifying,  supporting and presenting skilled

Answer t
o BB Question #
2:
 
I
 paid v
ery l
i
ttle a
ttention t
o c
hildrens' music until I
 b
egan t
o h
ave my own k
ids: t
hree o
f
 
t
hem -
-
1946-7-8! -
-
-
 when I
 mostly t
r
ied t
o r
emember t
he s
ongs and baby g
ames t
hat my parents had
 
u
sed with me. My husband Butch and I
 a
lso t
r
ied t
o k
eep t
he home a
tmosphere c
asually musical,
 
because t
hat was t
he way we l
iked i
t
, l
ots o
f i
nformal s
inging, r
ecord p
laying, f
ooling a
round with
 
i
nstruments. So one o
f our year o
ld babies "
sang" t
he t
une o
f "
Twinkle Twinkle L
ittle S
tar" with obvious
 
p
leasure. Another a
s a p
re-schooler s
ummoned me t
o t
he backyard t
o h
ear h
im p
lay on h
is "
rocks" -
 a
 
wobbly a
rrangement o
f small s
tones on which he t
apped with another r
ock, i
ndeed p
roducing a
 vaguely
 
up and down v
ersion o
f "
Twinkle Twinkle" -
-
 apparently t
ops on t
he Hawes Hit Parade.
 
Later, t
hat s
ame c
hild, Nick,. became obsessed with t
he t
rumpet, a
t f
ar t
oo e
arly an age. My
 
husband and I
 had perhaps unwisely, decided t
o p
rovide our f
amily only with "
real" i
nstruments, and
 
t
hen we got s
tuck. There was no way,armed on l
y with a
 c
heap t
oy t
rumpet, t
hat Nick c
ould b
low a
 
golden horn l
ike t
he Louis Armstrong r
ecords we p
layed, o
r e
ven emulate t
he l
ocal Boy S
cout bugler
. We
 
d
idn't want t
o r
isk h
is i
nevitable d
isillusionment. But a
t t
he age o
f f
our, he had c
oncluded t
hat i
f
 he only
 
announced h
is desires f
reqwuently, l
oudly, and c
learly e
nough, perhaps t
hey might b
e g
ranted, and h
e
 
was deep i
n t
his p
rocess when Pete S
eeger spent a
 n
ight with u
s and happened t
o hear Nick
's b
reakfast
 
l
i
tany. (
"I wanna t
rumpet!" -
-
 i
t
 ws hard t
o avoid -
-
 "Hey dad, I
 wanna t
rumpet!".)
 
"
You know, Nick," Pete s
aid," l
et's t
alk about t
his a
fter b
reakfast". and a
fter b
reakfast he d
id
 
i
ndeed t
ake Nick i
nto t
he backyard and s
oberly d
iscussed with h
im t
he f
act t
hat i
n o
rder t
o p
lay t
he
 
t
rumpet one had t
o develop an "
embouchure". This e
legant quality c
ould only b
e obtained by d
iligent
 
p
ractice on a
lmost anything t
hat had a
 hole i
n i
t
; and he i
nstructed Nick i
n t
he a
rts o
f p
roducing s
ounds
 
out o
f s
oda water bottles, garden hoses e
t
 a
l
, until I
 u
ltimately became s
kittish about p
icking up a
lmost
 
anything a
round t
he p
lace.
 
Eventually, a
l
l our t
hree c
hildren made music a
 b
it p
rofessionally, s
em-iprofessionally and
 
f
or t
heir own amazement. (Nick e
ventually d
id p
lay t
rumpet i
n t
he h
igh s
chool marching b
and.) Our s
ix
 
g
rand-children have varying degrees o
f musical i
nterest. I
 do not however b
elieve t
hat we a

o-called
 
t

The concert '
1
10hana - We Are Family" was presented on
 
2/22/198 in Long Beach,  California by a tri-partite group:
 
Public Corporation for the Arts  (
Long Beach
 
Arts Council)
 
Carpenter Arts Center  (California State
 
University at Long Beach)
 
'Ainahau 0 Kaleponi - 
Hawaiian Civic Club,  Long
 
Beach
 
First,  this is a very nifty combination: local arts agency,
 
university, local business/ethnic organizztion.
 
Public Corporation for the Arts, Long Beach
 
James Irvine Foundation,
 
Fund for Folk Culture,
 
National Endowment for the Arts
 
Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum.
 
cultural or g a n i z a t io n s .
 
Such a complex group of supporters could not have been
 
brought together without exceptional effort.  I suspect a
 
large part is due to the determined and sophisticated work of
 
Terry Liu, the Folk Arts Coordinator at the Long Beach PCA. I
 
mention this particularly because Liu received little notice
 
in the printed materials;  however,  I observed the affection
 
and familiarity with which organizers and artists greeted him
 
backstage.  If the NEA is still responsible for paying part of
 
his salary,  the money is being well spent.
 
Now to the event 
It was a genuine stunner. I have
 
rarely attended a traditional arts performance in which my
 
knuckles didn't whiten with anxiety at least once,  if not all
 
the way through. Not here.
 
It is so hard to present genuine traditions within a
 
formal public venue in a way that is meaningful. I have from
 
time to time thought it impossible.  But again, not here. This
 
was a real beauty -- a local concert,  seriously undertaken
 
for the cultural well-being of the local ethnic population
 
and the joy of the performers -- a kind of artistic spring
 
tonic. At the same time its reach was hospitably extended,
 
without strain, to all surrounding cultures.
 
And it sold out!!!!  In a theater of 1060 seats!!!  (Just
 
before the concert started I chanced to pass the ticket
 
office where I saw an elderly Anglo lady standing in despair
 
saying,"It can't be that there isn't one ticket left!" I left
 
them trying to see that she got one.)  The advance publicity
 
had been appealing,  accurate,  and well timed;  its efficiency
 
was demonstrated by the fact that,  in terms of ethnicity,  the
 
seats were filled by a heady combination of Hawaiians,
 
Anglos,  and a complex Pacific mixture including Polynesians,
 
Micronesians,  and Melanesians,  not to mention university
 
professors,  musicians,  children.  and school janitors.
 
The concert opened in a dignified way with a capella
  
singing by the Ainahau o Kaleponi Hawaiian Civic Club Choral
 
Group from Orange County.  They represented the Polynesian
 
polyphonic tradition,  a theme which was to emerge later in
 
the program.  The audience seemed to enjoy them,  though they
 
did not generally participate in the singing as requested.
 
(
Probably they had difficulty finding the words in the
 
printed program.)
 
The concert proper involved three strong hula halaus
  
Hula Halau o Keali'io Nalani (West Angeles)
 
Kumu Hula:  Keali'i Ceballos
 
Hula Halau o Kamuela  'Elua  (Glendale/ Burbank)
 
Kumu Hula:  Kunekwa Mook/Paleka Mattos
 
Hula Halau o Lilinoe  (Cardon)
 
Kumu Hula:  Sissy Kaio
 
The program was divided by an intermission,  the first
 
half devoted to hula kahiko: dances both ancient and recently
 
composed venerating the ancestors;  the second,  hula  'auana
  
presenting new compositions celebrating contemporary life
 
styles. All three halaus participated in both traditions.
 
The ancient chants were appropriately accompanied by
 
sticks,  rattles and drums played by the chanters.  The
 
contemporary melodies were accompanied by Kalakapua,  a group
 
of family members and friends,  including vocalists,
 
guitarists,  slack-key players,  and percussionists.  I was
 
happy to note that Kalakapua used a tasteful minimum of
 
amplification.  In fact.  overall,  the sound balance for the
 
entire concert was absolutely superb.
 
Some other overall impressions:
 
The audience was  joyfully supportive
 
they loved being in such a happy mix.  Throughout the concert
 
they whistled and hooted and clapped and hollered in,  I
 
assume,  a Pacific way.  I was happy to note that they didn't
 
stand up every five minutes,  Even at the end,  it was a slow
 
and respectful uprising,  very meaningful.
 
The paired Master and Mistress of
 
Ceremony -
-
 Michael Kalelokalanakila Crabbe and Wenonah
 
Keikilani Lyons -
-
 handled their bi-lingual responsibilities
 
with great credit.  Overall,  the concert script and the
 
program book were lucid and informative, presented without
 
strain as translations from one language to the other;
 
The discipline of the performing groups
 
equalled every important Hawaian group I have ever seen.
 
Every halau came on and off stage without fuss,  and arranged
 
their diagonals with calm and surety.  Their unison dancing
 
was flawless and elegant.  I cannot over-praise them.
 
The costumes.  curtains,  drops,  and the
 
like were serene,  simple,  and totally appropriate.
 
Various halaus allowed their children to
 
participate.  This not only intensified the  'ohana theme but
 
brought things back to center,  so to say.  It was difficult to
 
get too far outside the central issues when a group of
 
children was involved.
 
Backstage conversation alerted me to a
 
probably old problem,  but one new to me -
-
 that halaus, at
 
least in California,  rarely meet except in circumstances of
 
competition.  The various convenings of kumu hulas necessary
 
for the production of this particular event required a new
 
interactional pattern. And I was told a newly cordial
 
atmosphere was gradually achieved.  Everybody seemed to like
 
it.  It will be interesting and maybe even hopeful to see how
 
these energies balance out in future.
 
* * * * * * *
 
Finally,  I must report a striking,  though temporary,
 
airing of the various contrastive tensions I sensed.  I've
 
begun to feel that with really knowledgeable and tender
 
support,  the folks themselves come up with extraordinary
 
cultural statements and solutions.  I think that happened
 
here.
 
These three halaus and their supporters chose,  for a
 
finale,  to display the qualities that held them together,
 
along with those that distinguish one from the other,  all at
 
the same moment.  One of the announcers,  in English and
 
Hawaiian,  pointed out that this was the first time these
 
groups had ever danced together,  except in serial
 
competition.
 
So at the end of this startling afternoon,  there was
 
only a bare stage.  Kalakapua began a minimalist instrumental
 
accompaniment. A first halau, identified by one of the two
 
hosts,  came on stage and moved as a group to the right,
 
performing a repetitive pattern of dance movements in unison.
 
They continued the same dance while a second halau entered
 
and was announced.  This group moved to center stage and
 
performed in unison a different repetitive movement pattern
 
which they then continued.  The third halau occupied stage
 
left. with yet a third
, movement pattern. All were continuous,
 
all were different,  all were in unison within their own
 
group,  all were in rhythm with the other two.
 
Many of the audience were in tears.  I was,  and so was
 
Dr.Amy Ku'uleiaoha Stillman,  who had acted as curator and
 
cultural  "auntie"  for everybody,  and who had prepared the
 
informative and elegant program book,  as well as pre-program
 
interviews and public statements.  She did a truly effective,
 
scholarly and responsible job for this event.  The entire
 
local Hawaiian community honored and esteemed her for it.  Dr.
 
Stillman will be leaving the West Coast for Michigan this
 
fall.  She will be greatly missed on the west coast.
 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 
This event was,  I do believe,  a kind of triumph,  both in
 
local and national terms. As I think about it,  it seems to me
 
that its success had to do with several factors  (
and I am
 
sure there will prove to be more)
 
1
)  There were already in existence several old,  strong,
 
well-established,  and community-supported participating
 
performing groups,  each one properly attempting to preserve,
 
understand,  interpret,  and represent their especial view of
 
the Hawaiian aesthetic.  That they might not agree was not
 
particularly unsettling.
 
2
)  There was strong generational participation -
-
 the
 
steadying influence of older traditions as well as the
 
invigorating influence of newer ideas.  This was in part
 
demonstrated by the wide age range of the performing artists.
 
3
)  The structural system of Hawaiian culture,  in many of
 
its aspects,  stresses disciplined,  uniform behavior.  This
 
happens,  ironically,  to fit nicely with the requirements of
 
contemporary European concert presentations,  such as ballet
 
and musical comedy.  Such a venue may come to be one of the
 
major platforms upon which serious Hawaiian culture may be
 
presented world-wide.  It certainly worked well here in this
 
elegant college theater.
 
4
)  I am not quite sure how it was accomplished,  but the
 
preliminary publicity for this event was extraordinarily
 
successful. A sell-out was predicted a week in advance.  The
 
content of the publicity was partly responsible -
-
 Amy
 
Skillman and Terry Liu kept feeding the media fascinating
 
stories. And then there is something about a triumph that
 
announces itself in advance -
-
 the air becomes electric,
 
5
)  There was an overall steadiness about this event that
 
I picked up on early. Many folk arts efforts,  though
 
brilliant,  lack a strong,  unflappable support body that will
 
see everything through.  I think the experienced and focussed
 
direction of the Public Corporation for the Arts urged on and
 
counselled by Terry Liu,together with the cultural authority
 
evidenced by Amy Skillman -
-
 all sensible people working
 
together -
-
 made all the difference. Anyway it was a gala
 
affair.
