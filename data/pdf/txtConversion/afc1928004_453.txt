That bloom 'd

'While her loving watch o'er us she's keeping. 
She was called away in springtime— 
All nature seemed to smile ; 
The birds with sweete4 music 
My sorrow tried to ' guile ; 
I 
read our dear old Bible ; 
Its counsels made me brave ; 
This little green leaf then lightened the grief 
I 
felt at mother's grave. 
This little green leaf. etc. 
When ' tis withered, old and faded, 
And I 
close my mortal eyes, 
Preserve it as a 
token 
Of love that never dies ; 
Through grief and tribulation, 
Recall the hopes it gave ; 
This little green leaf will strengthen belief 
In bliss beyond the E/-ave.

Our horses were first-class, fresh and rosy from the 
stable, 
A 
dapple mare named Barney that would stand with-
out a 
whoa— 
And a 
little sorrel gray that he called Hardly Able ; 
He was a 
honey cooler when he determined not to go. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
A 
funeral came along, these horses them did follow 
Right benind the hearse in a 
regular dead-march line ; 
Denny said " get up," like a 
trapper he did holler, 
But right or left they wouldn't stir till they saw a 
tav-
ern sign. 
ne'er forget, etc. 
Yienny gave them watEr with the devil in his eye, sir, 
Saying, •‘ I'll make the blackguards trot," 
Then the horses gave a

foot 
Will we move from Le.' till alt hauds get a

THE DANCING TAILORS.

HERE'S Paddy Mann and poor Pete McCann, 
We are not bothered, boys, with any riches ; 
We earn a 
dacent living, shure, 
By making coats and breeches. 
We're at the needles all the day, 
At night we go to dances ; 
We're sure to get the head of a 
set, 
In a 
cotillion or a 
lancers. 
Thin forward four, (symp.) 
Upon the floor there's none can whale us, 
Hands arounds, (symp.) 
Look out, look out for the dancing tailors, 
CHORUS. 
In the terpsichorian arts, 
We break the ladies' hearts; 
We forward, we balance so lightly on the toe, 
Upon the ball-room floor, the girls they do adoro 
The tailors, the tailors, 
-We captivate them so. 
To music sweet we move our feet, 
We're light upon the floor as any feather, 
And if ye s 
give a 
ball, my boys, 
Invite us both tog: ther. 
We know the rules of etiquette, 
A 
nd admire the ladies glances, 
They all agree my friend and me 
Are really the best of dancers. 
Thin forward four, (symp.) 
Our legs we're sure will never fail 
Club the nine-pin, (symp.) 
Look out, look out for the dancing tailors.

Cut up half the state,

Got milk in de milky way, 
Clear up above Hell Gate.

HARRIGAN'S DREAM. 
Dedicated to MESSRS. HARRIGAN & HART. 
BY 
ROBERT MCKAY. 
The " Mulligan Guard" tamed out in force, 
In the " Patrick's-day parade;" 
The " Skidmores," too, were also there— 
A 
fine display they made. 
It was remarked by every one. 
As they ‘• Down Broadway" did go. 
There were no finer men in all 
The " Regular Army, Oh."

With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A ; 
Proud steeds prancing bright eyes glancing 
So they march away 
" 
The °aid Hat," blocked for fifty cents, 
Again gleamed 'mid the throng, 
And " McNamara," proud's a 
lord, 
Beneath it matched along ; 
He heeded not the naughty boys ; 
But from a 
well-filled can, 
Drank frequent healths to Ireland, with 
" 
Muldoon, the Solid man."

When recognized by every one, 
Passed by " Old Uncle Pete."

In this little plain gold ring.

MICHAEL MURPHY. 
Sung by ED. ItAantoAN, at Theatre Comique. 
TEN years ago I 
stepped on board, 
A 
ship to England bound, 
My heart and pockets both were light, 
Though I'd not got a 
pound ; 
I 
was but a 
young greesheen then, 
Without deceit or sham, 
But times and things have altered 
With myself, and now I 
am— 
Cnouus 
Mister Michael Murphy, a 
man of great ability, 
Known and respected too by all the gentility, 
Patronized by all the nobs amongst the great nobility, 
For Mister Michael Murphy is a 
well known man. 
I 
got some work to carry bricks, 
At fourteen bob a 
week, 
But soon I 
got the sack because 
They said I'd too much cheek ; 
So I 
fell back upon the club, 
And when I 
let them see 
That I 
was full of book laming, 
They made a 
secetary—Of. 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
From that they made me President 
Of our new Home•Rule League, 
And I 
soon got acquainted with 
An M. P., Mister Teague ; 
My speechifying was so good, 
I 
soon got into fame, 
And everybody tells me that 
The man to make a 
name—is 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
MICHAEL MURPHY.

Continued 
My 
letters now are all addressed 
Michael Murphy, esquire, 
And if I 
get in Parli anent 
Ill set the honse on fire ; 
With my great and burning eloquence, 
teach them the right way 
To satisfy the Home Rule League, 
Then every one will say — 
Miter Michael INIurphy, etc. 
MY LITTLE ONE WAITING FCR ME. 
IN 
the dell where the brooklets gently flowing, 
On the bench 'neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are sweetly singing, 
There my little one's waiting for me ; 
And she knows well the sound of my footsteps, 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretch'd to greet her, 
My little one waiting for me. 
And at night when daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way toward my home, 
My hent's always beating with p-easure, 
For my little one surely will come ; 
As I 
pass o'er that clear rippling brooklet, 
There, watching, I 
always can see, 
On the bench 'neath the old weeping willow, 
My little one waiting for me.

ME

She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea, 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroy me family.

There's her father, and her mother, 
And her sister, and her brother. 
1700 babies laying on their knees, 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozen 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Maloney. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece ; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof; 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, 
Root leer by the pail ; 
I'd have to wait ' till they were full 
Before I'll get me male. 
CHORUS. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you burst a 
button, 
And a 
fiery-head Corkonion 
By the name of Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable 
While they ate up all the labor of Pat Aroloney. 
PAT MALONEY'S FAMILY

Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head ; 
When tired out wid labor 
They'd kick me out of bed.

For keep them from Bellevue, 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew.

LET grasses grow rind water flow, 
In a 
free and euy way; 
Give me enough of the prime old stuff, 
That's made in Gramm. 
Ye gauges all from Donegal, 
Galway and Leitrim, too, 
We'll give ye the slip, and take a 
sip, 
Of the rale old mountain dew. 
Under the bill there's a 
little still, 
Where the smoke rolls up to the sky, 
You'd easy tell by a 
whiff of a 
smell, 
There's whiskey, boys, close by, 
it fills the air with perfumes rare— 
And between both me and you, 
When home you roll, come take a 
bowl 
Of the rale old mountain dew. 
All learn'd men who use the pen, 
Have wrote the praises high, 
Of the sweet poteen, from Ireland green, 
Distill'd from the wheat and rye. 
Away with pills—'twill cure the ills, 
Of Pagan, Christian and Jew, 
Off wid yer coat, and wet your throat 
With the rale old mountain dew.

Aunt Chloe come to town to-day, 
To see old Aunt Jernima, 
She came in on a 
load of hay, 
With a 
big bull-dog behind her. 
She had a 
jug in the cart 
Of real old apple-toddy, 
She wasn't proud, bless her heart. 
She'd notice anybody. 
Hurrah ! for Aunty Chloe; 
Her hair as white as snow, 
She's come to town to look around; 
To sing the jubilee. 
She had a 
bonnet on her head, 
That. was in the revolution, 
Six) had no teeth to chew her bread, 
She was tough as any Russian. 
She had a 
sorrel old grey horse, 
He had the clampus vitus, 
And when she holler hal-le-lu; 
He'd kick up like the riteous. 
Hurrah! etc. 
When Chloe met old Jeminia, 
I 
declare she really kissed her, 
She stamped her feet just like a 
slnep, 
And hollered welcome sister. 
'Twas joyful, joyful, hail de news, 
When Chloe told de story, 
It melted all de rubber shoes, 
Jemima shouted glory. 
Hurrah I

Now everything am silent as the grave ;

Whar we'll meet again no more, no more to part. 
But while I

I'll try and please you white folks all a

I'll collapse, I'll go under, I'll expire, 
Dat's what'll become of Uncle Pete.

Oh, I 
love to see the ships, 
Sail in from foreign trips, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
mermaid in the watEr; 
Or else a 
little pearl, 
Or the darling little girl, 
That the sailors call jolly :ceptune's daughtea, 
Then when a 
ship would wreck 
I 
would jump upon the deck, 
Or through a 
golden horn I 
would hail her ; 
I 
pick out from the crew 
Some jolly tar in blue, 
For my heart is always on a 
sailor. 
I'd be constant as a 
dove 
To my bonny own true love, 
If he left we the seas to go a 
roamin' ; 
I 
would dream at night of him, 
Aloft in a 
gale of wind 
iou'd never catch me sighing or a 
moaning. 
Saying " I'll meet my darling boy 
With his jolly ship ahoy ; 
Who'd be a 
lawyer or a 
tailor, 
I 
never will get wed 
Unless my husband tread 
The deck of a 
vessel as a 
sailor."

RALE AIeMULLIN STYLE. 
Words by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
Music by JOHN BRAHAM. 
Stage representations only by consent of the author. 
! 
I 
am a 
rale descinclent of McMullin from GlendaII, 
For beauty and education the McMullin's bate them all, 
The name is handed down from the days of Adam's time, 
Wid the greatest admiration, I 
claim the name as mine. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, I 
keep up my noble head, 
I'm a 
credit to my country, Erin's Isle ; 
McMullin is my name, without any fear or shame, 
I'd stand out here forninst you in the rale McMullin style. 
My father often tould me to never tell a 
lie, 
I 
will alway help a 
beggar if I 
saw him passing by, 
Be free and independent as the bird that flies the air, 
Let my heart be like a 
dove and my spirit like a 
bear. 
Mr. Shakespeare's brain said there's nothing in a 
name, 
But he was a 
total stranger to McMullin all the while, 
For if he'd lived to- day, one thing he'd surely say, 
There's nothing can compare, my boys, to rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
My father's blood is in my veins, and McMullin is my name, 
It's known from Ireland unto the river Nile, 
And when you have bad luck, don't cry out like a 
duck, 
But put your shoulder to it in the rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AWAY. 
Written expressly for NED BARRY, by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
I'LL tell you something that happens 
Most every day of our life ; 
They come in some way or other, 
Like bees flying into their hives. 
They come in ail sorts of fashions. 
And sometimes they make a 
long stay, 
But keep a 
still tongue ill your head, my dear boy, 
And don't give yourself away. 
CHORUS. 
It is the very worst thing you can think of, 
No matter what people may say ; 
Don't be a 
fool, be as dumb as a 
mule, 
And don't give yourself away. 
If yofi're poor and ain't got a 
dollar, 
Just keep a 
stiff upper lip ; 
have a 
laugh and a 
smile for your neighbor, 
Don't let your tongue ever slip. 
One word of your poor circumstances, 
I 
fell think you've a 
nice pleasant way ; 
You've a 
chance then to make a nice borrow 
know, 
But don't give yourself away. 
If you're a 
lawyer, or doctor, or actor, 
Awl clever in business or art ; 
And blow it all over creation, 
Don't think for a 
moment it's smart. 
Each man you know has an opinion, 
And a 
right to express it, you say, 
So he tells all his friends and relations he meets, 
That you give yourself away. 
You fall in love like all other mortals 
With a 
girl that's modest and sweet, 
Don't act like a 
fop or a 
noodle. 
Or she'll usher you into the street. 
But treat her you know like a 
lady, 
Be familiar, witty and gay ; 
And you'll find she will call you her dumpling so 
sweet, 
But don't give yourself away. 
A QUIET LITTLE HOME. 
Originally sung at I 
fairigan & 
Iart's Theatre Comique, Broad• 
way, by NED BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in it quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay ; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or plaC01 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet 
pace. 
A quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A qui,t little parlor, a 
qui 4 
cup of tea, 
A 
life of poiteJ and quietness, tlylni the life for me. 
I 
like to have a 
social song, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I

A

So now, my friends, take my advice, awl do the best 
you can 
To earn a 
name tlitt, will become an honest working-
ing man , 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll 
find 
A 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind.

ALWAYS SPEAK A KIND WORD WHEN YOU 
CAN. 
Sung by NF,D BARRY, at I 
farrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique. 
AIR.—Slavery Days. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find ; 
But there's one more than the rest, 
Seems to linger on breast, and very oft comes stealing o'et 
my mind ; 
I'll sing a 
song to night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can, 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he had been to all. 
And while upon this hearth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans; 
But his stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
The workingman to- day with his pier and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can.

AS LONG AS THE W ORLD GOES 
RO UND. 
Sung by NED BARRY, at I 
farrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique 
There are times to be merry, and times to be 'sad, 
On this changeable earth of ours ; 
There's a 
share of the good and a 
share of the bad,Lj 
In our journey through thorns and flowers. 
There are parts of the way that are blooming and gay, - 
There are parts that are stony ground. 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As 
long as the world goes round. 
CHORUS. 
As long as the world goes round, as long a,s the world goes 
round. 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
Tho' our hearts may grow faint in the battle of lite, 
'Tis a 
comfort at least to feel 
That the morrow may bring a 
new turn to the strife, 
In a 
turning of fortune's wheel. 
Tho' the sky be o'ercast, there is sunshine at last. 
Where the blackest of clouds are found, 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, etc. 
Let us bow to the sorrows fate throws in our way, 
There is hope when its frowns are worst ; 
And enjoy the bright weather of life while we may, 
For to morrow the storm will burst. 
Seize the best when you can bear the worst like a 
man, 
'Tis a 
motto bath safe and sound, 
And so it will be, I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, etc.

Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I

Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I

He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine.

As sung by him with great 
success, at HARRIGAN S: 
ilART's Theatre Cumique, 
I'VE got a 
sweetheart, she looks like a 
queen, 
I 
ler hair it is red, and her age is sixteen, 
She's from Kildare, she's not very green, 
She's one of the fairest your eyes ever seen. 
She sings •‘ 
Been Manna," plays on the piano, 
With a 
voice soprano, that's cozy and sweet, 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney" 
She frightens the children off of the street. 
CHORUS. 
You should see Mary, she's light as a 
fairy, 
Sings like a 
canary, from ould Tipperay, 
She is not airy, she attends to the dairy, 
She's never contrary, my own Mary Ann. 
I 
took lovely Mary one night to a 
ball, 
To a 
massacred hop, down to Walhalla IIall, 
She swung the side quadrille the best of them all, 
But gel her to dance, faith I 
couldn't at all.' 
Says I, lovely Mary, will you svaltz the next quadrille ? 
Says she, excuse me, Levi, I'm losing my health. 
Her corns they did ache her, she took off her shoe, 
-• 
And in two minute's time she had the hall to herself:. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
When the dancing was over, some one sung a 
song, 
And in popped a 
nagur, and struck a 
big gong, 
I 
Ie shouted out fire, and flew straight along. 
She fell down the steps, and I 
thought she was gone ; 
I 
caught her and convinced her the gong went for supper, 
She sat down to the table, and done it up brown. 
The fruit that she eat was onions and garlic ; 
The perfume from her breath would knock a 
man down. 
You should see Mary, etc. 
SAM DEVERE'S VILLAIN 
STILL PURSUED 
HER. 
Written and sung with immense success by SAM DEVERE. 
Of the troubles of a 
nice youir-
•, gal I'll tell, 
Oh, she was a 
South Fifth Avenue belle ; 
There was a 
tall, short, thick set built man, 
"Who was mashed on Liz McGruder ; 
Wherever she went, she was never content, 
For the villain still pursued her. 
She washed her face and wiped her nose, 
Then dressed herself in her Sunday clothes ; 
As stiff as starch was the dress she wore, 
She wits an ironer, a 
washer and a 
fluter, 
On her head was a 
wreath, and she wore false teeth, 
But the villain still paasned her. 
Oh, the ducks and the gees.3 were a-singing lin tke trees, 
The air was soft with a 
clammy breeze ; 
At .the hour of tyyt,lv. on a 
moonlight night, 
She went to meet her suitor. 
She slipped on a 
pie, run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain s 
ill pursued her. 
One day she went in a 
Dutchman's store, 
Her dress wa -i 
InuisAl and It'd r 
eye was tore ; 
Oh, she tried to conceal in her pocketbook a 
ham, 
And the Dutchman than did shoot her ; 
She fell on her knees Arith a 
mouthful of cheese, 
And the villain still pursued her.

As originally sung by Goss & FOX. 
Jonah ran away, he went to sea, de ship got wrecked 
upon de coast, 
De captain and de mate had trouble on de mind, 
De captain and do mate said dey better draw straws,

For three long days and three long nights, 
Jonah; he lay in de bottom of de whale, 
Live humble, live humble, humble yourself to me, sir.

Glory in de honor, bress de lamb. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Now de whale he commanded de Lor's right band, 
To cast brudder Jona_ on de innocent land, 
to heave 
brudder Jonah on dry sand ; 
And de moon shone down from de promised land, 
Now dat ain't all dere's besides. 
Take a 
little nigger to a 
new burying-ground, 
New burying ground opeii all de time; 
Dat put a 
frown on Jonah's crown. 
Live bumble, live humble, bumble yourself to me, sir;

Glory in de honor, bress de lamb. 
Repeat last two lines.

Then we put all the niggers in the missionary

THE KIND LOVING' FACES AT HOME. 
Written and Sung by BEN DODGE. 
I'm thinking to-day of the home of my youth, 
Near the brooklet that runs through the glade, 
The green grassy lawn and the orchard so dear, 
Where oft in my childhood I've strayed ; 
'Tis many a 
year since those scenes I 
have left, 
Through far- distant countries to roam, 
But where'er I've wandered I've still longed to see 
The had loving faces at home. 
CHORUS. 
And though we parted, yet ever to me 
Sweet thoughts of my loved One3 will come ; 
And where'er I 
wander I 
still long to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
How oft in my dreams have my thoughts wandered 
back 
To my mother so kind and so true, 
Who whispered " Good by and God bless you, my 
boy," 
When I 
bid her and father adieu ; 
E'en now in my fancy I 
once more can feel 
Her warm, loving kiss on my brow, 
And sigh when I 
think that ' tis naught but a 
dream, 
For I'm wandering far from her now. 
And though, etc. 
My sweet loving sister, with whom I 
have played 
So oft in our childhood at home, 
Has sent to me many a 
message of love, 
To cheer me wherever I 
roam ; 
My father is waiting to greet me again, 
When my long weary journey is o'er, 
And soon we will meet round the old fireside, 
To part until death, never more. 
And though, etc •

NEVER DESERT A FRIEND. 
Sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
A man who's close-fisted, and selfish, and mean, 
Is a 
man who would never suit me, 
For though I'm not wealthy I 
always have been, 
To my friends open-handed and free ; 
I 
don't think .
you're poorer for helping a 
friend, 
With a 
dollar or two when in need, 
But you're certainly worse if you worship your purse, 
And give way to a 
miserly greed. 
Citottus. 
Never give way to a 
stingy way, 
I 
don't say it's wise to lend ; 
It's right to put by for a 
rainy day, 
But not to desert a 
friend. 
Some men go on scraping anti pinching to save, 
Till it makes them decrepid and old, 
And although they may stand on the brink of the grave, 
They'll be planning and scheming for gold. 
It's a 
sorrowful sight to see pet pie who might 
Live in comfort and peace to the end, 
By their pitilul ways only shorten their days, 
To make money for others to spend. 
Never get into, etc. 
Now although I 
advise and I 
think it is wise, 
To be generous, honest and just, 
Pont imagine that I 
wtntld not have you put by, 
And provide your old tig with a 
crust ; 
For prudence wid tell you there vill come a 
day, 
When you'll find you are laid on the shelf, 
And you tray depend from beginning to end, 
That the best friend of all is yourself. 
Don't get into, etc.

AIR.—Charming Young Widow. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
As I 
was a 
reading the " Herald" one morning, 
The " Personal Column " I 
happened to see, 
And I 
made up a 
song while I 
was a 
reading, 
Of the things that I 
saw so funny to me. 
There were strange informations and friends and re-
lations, 
For each other asking, both old and the young, 
And chaps with their sweethearts appointments were 
making, 
How some of them read now I'll sing in my song. 
Oh, Baby, my darling, now meet me at " Bigots," 
And I'll buy for you, precious, a 
camel's hair shawl; 
There's a 
love of a 
diamond, that I 
have my eye on, 
And I 
also have tickets for " Lamiigan's 
Oh, beautiful Georgy, oh, where art thou, darling ? 
The store I've been passing for many a 
day, 
Oh, tell me, my darling, have you ben arrested, 
Or up on the island, or gone far away ? 
Will charming young widow, so guiless and pretty, 
The night it was storming, I 
met on the train ; 
Who told her sad story on which I 
took pity, 
Please be returning my gold watch and chain. 
Oh, why don't that fellow bring back my umbrella, 
The day it was raining he borrowed from me, 
To see home a 
lady, and carried her baby, 
While his wife was a 
waiting his coming to tea.

RING DOWN THE CURTAIN. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by CHARLES E. 
PRATT. 
RING down the curtain !" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, -unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast ! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife. 
AVItile tears diumfd each sorrowing eye ; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
"It's no use, God bless you ! Good-bye !" 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" 
Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high 1 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep ; 
" 
It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, good-
bye! 
"Ring down the curtain !" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew. 
Dear is the vision that menfry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye !"
