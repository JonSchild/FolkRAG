Put the Brake on when you're go-
lug Down the Hill. 
As sung by W. F. Sinclair, the great English sensational coat-
ique. 
The " journey of existence" 
is a 
rugged one, we know; 
Then as you drive along the road, 
Be careful how you go; 
Keep a 
tight rein in your hand, 
Or you may get a 
spill; 
And, mind you, put the brake on, 
When you're going down the hill. 
CHORUS. 
For life's a 
rugged journey, 
Let men say what they will; 
So, mind and put the brake on, 
When you're going down the hill. 
The world is always moving, 
And man is not allowed 
To loiter by the way-side, 
But must go with the crowd, 
Who travel on life's dreary way, 
To bring grist to the mill, 
But he's bound to put the brake on, 
When he's going down the hill. 
1For life's, etc. 
The fastest race is soonest run 
Upon the great highway , 
Of life, as folks discover, 
If they travel night and day 
10 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER. 
The road is sometimes level, 
But, in spite of strength and skill, 
You're bound to put the brake on, 
When you're going down the hill, 
[For life's, etc. 
In search of empty pleasures, 
Many travel on so last, 
But find the pace too killing; 
So, they come to grief at last— 
And when " Old Time Tho'ertakes them, 
And Nature claims her bill, 
They'll wish they'd put the brake on, 
Ere they'd travelled down the hill. 
For life's, etc.

As sung by Johnny Roach, the favorite Irish comedian. 
When on the road to old Athy, ahoo, ahoo,

The French Gentleman from Limer. 
Wk. 
Ant.—" Paddy is the Boy." 
Now a 
French gentleman from Limerick, one Pad-
dy Burk by name, 
Took a 
passage to America, to come all the way by 
steam, 
As Pat had never seen a 
ship before he wasn't much 
to blame, 
His troubles ye may take as a 
warning. 
'When looking down the batch-way, be jabers what 
is that ? 
Is it ducks and geese you have on board, be gob 
but I'll get fat; 
When the captain cried, lay to 1 
shure one at the 
time will do, says Pat, 
And I'll swallow all their eggs in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
For Paddy is the boy that looks out for number 
one, 
Paddy is the boy where the eating first begun, 
His mother was a 
Murphy and he was her_only 
son, 
And he'd eat till he'd burst in_the morning. 
When Pat upon the ocean got, he began to get 
quite sick, 
Like a 
drunken man he staggered and he rolled 
about the deck, 
And he cursed the day he started from ould Ireland 
avic, 
The pigs and potatoes a-scorning. 
;Aakilk4,,

THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER. 
When getting in the captain's way, he cried heave 
ahead, 
Arrah my stomach too, says Pat, be jabers I'm near 
dead, 
Stop the ship and let me out, there'll be murder on 
your head, 
It's an inquest you'll hold in the morning. 
For Paddy, etc. 
Ziow, 
at a 
little better got, as they got upon their 
way. 
Till one_night, a 
storm arose, and raging was the. 
sea, 
And he cursed the day he started to go see Amer-
ica,. 
To leave the dear old country he was born in. 
Then the vessel sprung a 
leak, she letting water in 
below, 
Go fetch the doctor quick says, Pat, it's a 
shame to 
leave her so, 
For I've had the same complaint myself since from 
Ireland I 
did go, 
And Pm trotting up and down night and morn-
ing. 
For Paddy, etc. 
Now when they sighted Columbia's shore, Pat cried, 
God bless the soil, 
It's the place where every dacint man can live be-
yond his toil, 
And not be taxed and ground to death, to increase 
the Saxon spoil, 
I Let freemen take this as a 
warning. 
It is the land where Erin's harp is free from every 
tread, 
Where every noble Fenian can proudly _raise his 
head,

Und she hollered so when you knocked her

In a

in a

They was fitted a 
great big slap from dat slemt so 
grose, 
Und dat sourerkrout lays under dat stone. 
Oh, don't you remember dat market, Sweet Bolt, 
Dat stood on the corner of dat street ? 
How often nights when we got on a

We used to get in there und sleep. 
Dat market was all played out now, Sweet Bolt, 
Und dat sauagenisagliun dat used to go so sweed,

Und they don't make no more boloneys from dogs, 
Sweet Bolt, 
Und the rats was allaways stealing all the meat. 
Oh, don't you remember dat school, Sweet Bolt, 
Dat master licked me when I 
come so late, 
Arber don't I 
got the best from him nice one day 
When I 
hid him on the head mit my slate ? 
Dat master was died, died, Sweet Bolt,

Und all of them boys dat was little schools then, 
There was only me und you. 
Rolling Home in the Morning. 
As sung with great success by Charley Kimic. 
I 
am of a 
school of boys who're always gay and 
free, 
And good for any little game, whatever it may be ; 
For, fun at night is our delight, and then let come 
what may, 
We never think of going home, until the break of 
day. 
Rolling home in the morning, boys, in the morning, 
boys ! 
Rolling home in the morning, boys, before the break 
of day. 
At eight o'clock we start from home, and then our 
pals we meet : 
We " Tommy Dodd" for glasses round or some ono 
stands a 
treat. 
If once we enter dancing rooms, we never leave 
again, 
Until we've wound the evening up with glorious 
champagne. 
Rolling home, etc. 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER. 
21 
Uproarious we sally forth, a 
lot of jolly sparks, 
To chaff the cabbies and police, who grin at all our 
larks, 
We don't indulge in foolish tricks, house-bells we 
ring, 
But " Up in a 
Balloon," boys, we don't forget to 
sing. 
Rolling home, etc. 
Of course, when we reach home, my boys, it's diffi-
cult to see 
The number of the house, or even— where to find 
the key; 
And when the morning breaks, we are so queer 
about the head, 
We wonder how we staggered home, and found our 
way to bed. 
Rolling home, etc. 
But here my sorrows do not end, for when I 
call 
to see 
The little darling of my heart—she's not polite to 
me; 
She's heard how I 
went on last night, it's useless to 
explain, 
And so I 
promised—till next time—I'll not roll

While one gives us a

Bad luck does us attend, 
How few will give a 
hand, and say, 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
How few, etc. 
A 
friend in need, is one indeed, 
His heart and hand he lends: 
How different where we have to say, 
Oh! save us from our friends!

No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say,

Captain de Wellington Boots. 
As sung by George W. Ifellville, the successful comic vocalist 
You must know I 
belong to the army, 
You can see that, of course, by my style, 
I 
delight in the title of 
Captain," 
And upon me the ladies all smile. 
In the ranks of the First Mounted Out-'o-sights, 
I 
hold an important command. 
And perhaps you'll permit me to tell you, 
There are no finer men in the land. 
SroREN.—Yaas, we are all fine men, brave men, 
and what I 
like best of all is 
To—la de da with the ladies; 
For, that is the style that suits 
The noble frame and glorious name 
Of Captain de Wellington Boots. 
You may talk of the Bar or the Navy, 
My life beats the couple to smash, 
You can get a 
fine post in the Army, 
That is, if you've got but the cash. 
My dad, you must know, was a 
Grocer, 
Who contrived to scrape up a 
good sum, 
Bought rue a 
commission with " Sugar,". 
And afterwards left me a " Plum." 
SroKEN.—To enable me 
To—la de da, etc.

At Soirees and balls I

And quarrel almost for " The Captain 1" 
Or implore I

But dancing for me's too much bother,

I 
tell them fine tales about battles 
Which the darlings are anxious to hear, 
But what the smell of powder is like,

They think I've done glorious deeds, 
And have oft made the enemy fly, 
But I 
haven't as yet—and what's more, 
I 
have no intention to try. 
SPOKEN.—Not in the least, I 
prefer by far 
To—la de da, etc. 
I 
drive a 
fine Drag that's a

I've a

Of an afternoon I

They whisper—" See! there goes the Captain!"

Pretty Little Flora. 
As sung by George W. Mellville, the successful comic vocalist. 
I 
sing of Pretty Flora, a 
gem behind the bar, 
At the " Bird" in Highbury you'll find my guiding 
star. 
She is the sweetest treasure, all round, near or far, 
And to speak the truth, I 
adore her 
Swells flock, like little flies around a 
treacle pot, 
And want to steal my fair one, but don't care a 
jot, 
They chaff and drink just to look large, and fancy 
they're A 
1, 
But they have not half a 
chance with little Flora. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Flora serves behind the bar 
Bass's bitter ales and porter; 
I 
stand there all the day, and cannot keep away, 
It breaks my heart to leave my little Flora. 
How I 
love little Flora, and for hours there I 
stand, 
The proudest of the proud, the grandest of the grand, 
:And soon I'll place the gold ring on her tiny hand. 
Yet I 
keep my eye on .all who stand before her; 
When swells they pass a 
jcrke, she says, " Sir, don't 
be rude," 
And popping on a 
frown, declares they do intrude; 
Then turning round she looks at me, as just to say, 
" 
Ah I 
George you have the heart of little Floral" 
Pretty little Flora, etc. 
I 
could eat pretty Flora, my love is so sincere, 
She wants no " Rachel" touch, her skin it is so fair, 
Her eyes are full of fire, and you should see her hair, 
in a 
brooch she carries me before her;

And drive off to church with little Flora?

So on it you must lie;

Take my advice, don't try.

But when she's gone, we miss her;

Why, call her back and kiss her

Of course that's very proper; 
And if she means to rule you, too,

Do nothing that will tease her, 
And if you wish to happy live, 
You'll do your best to please her.

I 
drain it dry, for what care I? 
It's all the same to Sam.

tised to mope, and never hope, 
But sigh and mope again; 
But now I

And never care to sham, 
I 
don't pretend to foe or friend;

chance to be neither, I 
cannot describe 
How a 
prince or a 
pauper may feel, 
I 
belong to that highly respectable tribe 
Which is known as the Shabby Genteel. 
CHORUS. 
Too proud to beg, to honest too steal, 
I 
know what it is to be wanting a 
meal; 
My tatters and rags I 
try to conceal, 
I'm one of the Shabby Genteel. 
I'm a 
party, in fact, who has known better days, 
But their glory is faded and gone; 
I 
have started in life in a 
lot of odd ways, 
But have not found the way to get on; 
There are are only three roads, I'm afraid, that are 
left; 
I 
shall have to beg, borrow, or steal, 
Yet, I 
don't quite encourage the notion of theft, 
Tho' I'm awfully Shabby Genteel. 
Too proud to beg, etc. 
I 
am dressed in my best, though I 
cannot pretend 
That my costume is quite COUME IL TAUT ; 
You'll observe that my watch has been left with a 
friend, 
And my gloves are unfitted for show; 
There are traces of wear on my elbows and knees, 
And my boots have run down at the heel; 
But it's cruel to criticise matters like these, 
When a 
man has grown Shabby Genteel. 
Too proud to beg, etc. 
Still I 
strive too be cheerful in all my distress, 
And I 
bear my bad luck like a 
man; 
If I 
can't have my way as to feeding or dress 
I 
must still do the best that I 
can;

TILE .TOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER* 
And remember, good people, that Fortune some day.. 
By a 
turn of her treacherous wheel, 
May reduce one of YOU in the very same way, • 
To the level of Shabby Genteel. 
Too proud to beg, etc. 
Bourbon on the Brain. 
As sung by Johnny Roach, the favorite Irish comedian. 
Just before the battle, mother, ( hic) 
I 
was thinking least of you, 
While upon the field we're spreeing, ( hic) 
With the enemy in view. 
Comrades ( hic) drunk around me lying, 
Filled with bitters made by Dod; 
For, well they know that on the morrow 
Some will lie drunk on ( hie) the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell mother, you may never, (hic) never, 
See me sober home again; 
But, oh, you'll not forget me, mother, 
If dead with " Bourbon on the brain." 
Oh I 
I 
long to have, dear mother, 
A 
demijohn sent me from home; (hic) 
First thing, at morn, I 
like my bitters, 
Ere to picket post ( hic) I 
roam. 
Tell the traitors all around you, 
That ( hic) their cruel deeds we know, 
In every instance, kill our soldiers 
With their stuff caged " Kill ( hic) 'em slow." 
Just before the battle, mother, etc. 
Hark! I 
hear the fish-horn sounding, 
'Tis the signal ( hic) for a 
muss; 
May I et no bruises, mother, ( hie) 
As I 
jcin into this fuss. 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER, 
61 1 
Hear the battle-cry of ( hic) Bourbon, 
How it swells upon the air ; 
Oh I 
yes, l'Il rally round the bottle, 
And get blind drunk, ( hic) while 1 
am there. 
Just before the battle, mother, etc. 
Conte Back to Erin. 
As sung by John Nolen, the silver-toned tenor. 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Come back, Aroon, to the land of thy birth, 
Come with the Shamrock and spring-time, Mavour-
neen, 
And it's Killarney shall ring with our mirth. 
Sure, when we lent you to beautiful England,' 
Little we thought of the lone winter days,' . 
Little we thought of the hush of the Star Shine 
Over the mountains, the bluffs, and the brays. 
CHORUS. 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Come back again to the land of thy birth, 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
And it's Killarney shall ring with our mirth. 
Over the green sea, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Long shone the white sail that bore thee away, 
Riding the white waves that fair summer mornin', 
Just like a 
May-flower a-
float on the bay. 
Oh 1 
but my heart sank when clouds came between 
us, 
Like a 
gray cartain the rain falling down, 
Hid from my sad eyes the path o'er the ocean, 
Far, far away where my colleen had flown. 
Come back to Erin, etc. 
62 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER. 
Oh 
may the angels, 0 
wakin' and sleepin', 
Watch o'er my bird in the land far away ! 
And it's my prayer will consign to their keepin' 
Care o' my jewel, by night and by day. 
When by the fireside I 
watch the bright embers 
Then all my heart flies to England and thee, 
Cravin' to know if my darlin' remembers, 
Or if her thoughts may be crossin' to me. 
Come back to Erin, etc. 
Crossing on the Ferry. 
As sung by John Nolen, the silver-toned tenor. 
Oh! please don't laugh when I 
relate 
To you a 
story sweet: 
It's all about a 
charming girl 
That I 
by chance did meet. 
.'Twas love at first sight when we met, 
• 
Those lips so red and cherry, 
Ohl what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
Walking through the cabin, passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me: for I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear crossing on the ferry. 
• 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look; 
For she a 
magnet seemed, 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beamed ; 
For every glance was like a 
lance, 
As in my heart they'd bury: 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce know how, 
While crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through, etc. 
1 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER: 
Our journey's end at last approached, . 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed. 
She turned her head and spoke to me, 
In a 
voice so soft and merry, 
saying: Write a 
note to Station D, 
Sign, Crossing on the Ferry. 
Walking through, etc. 
Never push ' a Man, because he's go. 
ing down the 11111. 
As sung by W. F. Sinclair, the great English sensational come 
ique. 
In this sensation century, 
Good songs are very few; 
The words are little cared for, • 
If the music is but new. 
The Subjects, too, are nearly done, 
But I 
have found one still: 
'Tis don't push a 
man, because 
He's going down the hill. 
CHORUS. 
But help one another, boys, 
If fortune on you smile, 
Remember, when you give your mite, 
That poverty's no crime. 
Though little be your offering, boys, 
Give it with good will, 
But don't push a 
man, because 
He's going down the hill. 
In this wide world there's many men, 
With truly honest heart, 
64 
THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN SONGSTER. 
To help their wives and families, 
In business make a 
start, 
But yet somehow their ends don't meet: 
Turn which way they will, 
Fate seems to be against them, 
And they are going down the hill. 
But help, etc. 
And as we jog along through life, 
How many men we find . 
That poverty's a 
grievous sin, to 
Think they are inclined. 
They meet in sad adversity 
Some old friend, Tom, or Bill; 
They smile on him disdainfully,: 
And push him down the hill. 
Then help, etc. 
If you meet an honest man, 
Struggling hard with fate, ' 
Don't speak words of discouragement, 
Or tell him ' tis too late: 
Don't sneer as you pass him by, 
But help him with a 
will, 
And perhaps some day you'll meet him 
On the summit of the hill. 
Then help, etc
