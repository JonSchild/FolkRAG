Dear Professor Smith:
 
As Chairman of the College Personnel Planning and Review Committee,
 
I am sure you will be interested in my general appraisal of Mrs. Bess
 
Lomax Hawes as a folklorist.  I was asked by one of her friends to write
 
you in view of employment and tenure matters affecting her at this time.
 
Although Mrs. Hawes is best known for her work in the field of
 
American balladry and folk songs, a reputation which has won her a wide
 
following in Southern California and elsewhere, she has also systematically
 
trained herself in the broader field of American folklore over the last
 
'veral years, and has gone on to widen her knowledge and scope of interest
 
include folklore in its broadest possible context.  Her teaching posi-
n in the Department o
f 1
rithropology has l
ed naturally to this broader
 
r
.  h
.
 
From her fine grounding in folk musical scholarship, Mrs. Hawes has
 
;
o:rkeu analogically out into other fields in terms of the key works and
 
other materials available to her.  She has consulted many practitioners
 
about introductory folklore courses and has tried to utilize the best in-
formation and ideas she could gather in this way.  I remember her talking
 
to me on two or three occasions about these problems, and have been impressed
 
with the professional approach and the professional dignity with \hich she
 
has proceeded.
 
lithough she is primarily oriented toward undergraduate teaching,
 
rs. Hawes has nevertheless inculcated in her students the spirit of re-
m
arch and inquiry.  Over the years she has shown me several papers which
 
r students have done, solicited opinions from me for their betterment,
 
ond in general has sought to train up a young generation of folklorists.
 
It least one of the papers submitted to me in the manner described vas
 
pood enough to publish, and is presently being edited for publication in
 
Western Folklore, which 1 edit.

has made the time and effort to travel to other c
arts of the state ahen
 
the meetings have been scheduled there.
 
Having spoken in laudatory terms nb ut f
lrs. l
iawea as a ICaC r
IO T,
 
and as a scholar, I think I can talk in even warmer terms about her as a
 
person.  She has warmth and a full measure of human dignity.  At a time
 
when there are becoming more and more shouters in academe, Mrs. Hawes
 
ommands attention and respect for her ladylike qualities, her modesty. ass
 
i
er charm.  I know few people who have fuller mastery of the English
 
and who can express themselves as well and as easily as Mrs. Hawes.
 
At a time when young people seem more restive and irresolute than ever
 
before, I think it would be a great loss to the teaching profession if a
 
person such as Bess Hawes, who has been such a salutary influence on so marl:,
'
 
thousands of young people in this area, were to be relieved of the teachini
 
duties which she carries out with such effectiveness and aplomt.
 
I should consider it a pleasure to be asked to reiterate tmeac
 
statements, and to amplify them, before your Committee or any other r

folklore around him and its effect on him.  In the beginning the student may
 
suffer some confusion because of the infinite variety of material, but this
 
provides a wider range of motivation and the opportunity for the student to
 
concentrate on material of particular interest and meaning for him.  Out of
 
the course comes a more lively awareness and a deeper appreciation of our
 
cultural traditions."

u  eaguec have
 i
i
iv
 
attention t
o the fact that Mrs. Bess Hawes, who has been teaching
 
in the Department of Anthropology st San Fernando Valley State
 
College for the past three years, is about to be released.
 It is
 
n
y understanding that this is being done because she does not hold
 
nhe Ph.D. degree and therefore lacks formal training.  My friends
 
L
ell me that Mrs. Hawes is an exciting and creative teacher, that
 
she is knowledgeable and cautious in the best academic tradition,
 
and that she has engaged in original creative activity of a
 
eholarly kind.
 Though I know Mrs. Hawes personally, I have not
 
had the opportunity for firsthand knowledge of these evaluations.
 
and yet I am convinced through long and detailed conversations
 
t
hat they represent a fair evaluation.
 
I should like to urge that the matter of Mr
's. i
lawes'
 
ront i
nued employment be reconsidered.
 I think there are two
 
matters that our particularly pertinent.
 The first is that
 
the development of anthropology at San Fernando Valley State
 
College had acquired a rich and creative character.
 Professor
 
Carpenter and his colleagues succeeded in drawing together
 
unusual and creative personnel and, considering the necess
y
 
[imitations of State College appointments, had developed a
 
unique institution.
 It has saddened me and many other anthro-
pologists in the area that this group has b
een d
isbanded, anu
 
i
t  i
s a shame to lose one more.
 
The second is the matter of formal training.  Without
 
siiigrating the importance of formal training in academic fields
 
;s a basis for sound scholarship in general, it is a well-known
 
i
'
act that individuals can and often do arise who have great force
 
i
n university and scholarly matters without formal training.
 
This has been particularly true in anthropology, with its wide-
ranging geographic, tempo"and substantive interests.  One could
 
cite innumerable examples, such as Professor Gifford whose long

caliber and scholarly contributions are of the highest ord.r.
 
and with her father, who was the first scholar in this couniiv
 
to recognize the literary value and social importance of the
 
indigenous American folk ballads.
 It is not surprising that
 
under these circumstances Mrs. Hawes should have in her very
 
lifeblood the qualities of scholarship and know1vcien that we.
 
make her an exciting and creative teacher.

Dear Dr.  Prutor:
 
I have been asked oy one of your graduate students in
 
anthropolo gy to write to you concerning the discontinuance
 
of the combined Folklore end Folk Music program at Fan
 
Fernando State College.
 
I may be quite out of order in commenting on this question
 
especially regarding the dismissal of Bess Lomax Hawes;  on
 
the latter issue, I make no comment whatever.  But as for
 
the position of folk studies in anthropology, I can assure
 
you that folk studies are a very important aspect of our
 
discipline.  The American
 Folklore Society, of which I am
 
general Editor, will publish as a special, triple-sized
 
issue this month, a collection of anthropological aporoachE
 
to myth, entitled THE ANTHROPOLOGIST LOOKS AT MYTH.  This
 
willbe reprinted shortly afterward as a hardback book by
 
the University of Texas Press.
 
Anthropologists directing their energies to this most
 
rewarding aspect of behavior are presently in the minority,
 
but there is no doubt that interest is growing, and in the
 
next generation,  the study of folklore will be firmly
 
placed in the anthropological eamp.
 I should be grieved
 
lo see any regression such as the graduate student in
 
question su
ests.
 
If you wish further information on this,  o
i-iph.. look
