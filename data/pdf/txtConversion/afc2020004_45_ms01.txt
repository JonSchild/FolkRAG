HELL’S ACRE 
I. THE HEX 
Last person doctored on Hell’s Acre, 
was an alcoholic ex-boxer. 
Supposedly, later that year, he exhumed all his dead pets 
and moved out of state. 
 
I was on Hell’s Acre 
because I was hexed 
by looking into a broken piece of mirror 
wrapped in a black silk handkerchief 
placed inside my boot. 
 
Ever since, a skeleton followed me, 
always trailing so closely behind 
like a friend sending me off on my way. 
 
On the west side of the mountains, pine needles were sharper. 
I heard a far-off river valley. 
I heard panthers summoning rain 
to hide their wedding.                                                              
 
The skeleton got scared and held my hand. 
The skeleton held my switchblade 
on our way down an ancient hog trail. 
“Oh, there goes your corpse again,” the skeleton lullabied. 
 
II. BLOOD MONEY 
That night, fifteenth night of the month, 
the moon hesitated to rise after the sun set. 
 
Throughout the valley, all the lost hunting arrows, 
 and knives sang. 
 
I made a campfire. 
The skeleton made a grave, 
roasted marshmallows over this grave. 
We slept at the property gate of a paper company. 
 
I dreamed I was back in Indiahoma 
with a case of Coors and all my dead cousins. 
I dreamed Indiahoma was a pale star 
in the rearview mirror. 
I dreamed the eight-headed Mupits carried spiral keys. 
I dreamed I was helping Quanah Parker move back into the Star House. 
I dreamed the winged snakes came back to the sky. 
I dreamed I was dreaming about Ten Bears  
and how he drove his knife into his own hand 
to prove an obvious point to a bluecoat. 
I woke up with my hands bleeding like stigmata. 
 
The skeleton was talking in his sleep 
about mason jars filled with blood money buried in dead river mud, 
about the governor of the Devil’s wardrobe 
drinking pop with peanuts floating in it. 
 
I couldn’t tell between the humidity and skeleton breath. 
The skeleton woke up, 
hanging inverted on the fence with the debris. 
 
That damn skeleton flipped me off 
when pretending to offer coffee. 
 
After breakfast, at the first willow tree we came to, 
I saw four screech owls under it 
throwing their eyeballs into the air 
and catching them with their eye sockets.                                          
A fox was learning this.                                                                 
 
Every now and then, the bones ask, 
“When are we not in a dream? 
. . . When are we not skeletons?” 
 
III. SECRET ORIGIN OF ESQUELETO 
It was Saturday 
under the sign of the Siamese. 
I placed a half dollar 
on a crescent-moon altar of caliche clay. 
 
The moon taken, chewed up, 
then spat into an empty hand, 
and rubbed in a circular motion to the left. 
 
That’s how the wilderness tends to bones. 
 
Every time they prayed for me, 
all my worn-out things turned to smoke 
and rose to heaven. 
 
Really I was nothing more 
than a toothpick from somewhere or another 
held in the mouth of an angel 
whose name comes from the sound of shivers  
it causes 
running down people’s spine. 
 
A single deerfly cut across 
the space of my breath, hovered close 
as we both listened 
to the excuse of a hundred eternities. 
 
IV. SKELETON SAYS 
The skeleton says we’re together. 
We’re Siamese twins. 
The skeleton thinks we’re on an old style horse raid. 
The skeleton put an old horse bone in its mouth 
to conjure up a herd.  
 
My Siamese twin is a boring partner 
and insists beer be served in cold, beveled mugs. 
 
I need to go back to Indiahoma. 
He wants to go to Branson.                                                                         
 
We set out on a bicycle with a banana seat. 
We listen for stray dogs, 
rain clouds popping their collars, 
for the Comanche Moon wandering the countryside, 
who’s not ashamed to laugh 
with someone else’s blood on its teeth. 
 
So focused on listening, 
we pedal out to where 
moonlight breaks like a knife blade on the silence. 
 
V. RAID 
Lighting out after Beelzebub, 
chimera, 
medicine. 
I had business. 
 
I climbed down a ladder of wolves 
to follow unraveled entrails from an old kill. 
 
One can read the future from such.                                              
 
I took shelter in abandoned blankets 
piled high in moonlight 
at the border of the floating world. 
 
During a thunderstorm, Zeus and Jesus 
licked the rain off each other’s hands and arms 
like wild animals. 
I saw their connection. 
 
The skeleton confided in me and said, 
The two things you do best 
are keeping me from dying and telling scary stories . . . 
 
Then we cut through the Ozarks 
like cicadas released by the breath of a vampire.
