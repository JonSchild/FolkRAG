16E-A1 W. F. THE LASS OF GLEN SHEE
Ward E. Ford singing from Central Valley, California. The song THE LASS OF GLEN SHEE learned from
Steve MacGinty of Bear Creek Wisconsin, about fifty years ago.
One bright summer's morning as the day was a-dawning, Bright Phoebus arose and shone o'er the
sea, I espied a fair femal female as homeward I was riding; She was hearding herding her flocks
on the hills of Glen Shee. Her cheeks were like roses and unto them dimples, And keen was the
blink of her bonnie black eyes. She was neat, tall and handsome, her ways ? so enchanting That my
heart soon belonged to the lass of Glen Shee. I stepped up unto her and said to her kindly, If she
would not go along to Saint Johnstown with me, No one in this wide world shall equal your castle,
No one shall be clothed any finer then thee. They'll say, "Look at him yonder with his highland lady."
"Stuck up like a doll in the window," said she, "Stuck up like a witch in your [?] homespun claddie ? A-
herding,your flocks on the hill hills of Glen Shee." Nie, believe me bonnie lassie, Caledonia's bright
waters Will all change their course and flow back from the sea, And the revolving sun shall be bound
down in fetters, Before I prove false to my darling Jennie. 2 THE LASS OF GLEN SHEE "No, don't tease
me any longer for fear I might blunder, Which would cause all your kinfolk to laugh at me, For they're
puffed up in manners, both the older and the younger," Cried the innocent lassie, poor maid of Glen
Shee. "Don't talk of such nonsense, but get up here beside me, 'Fore the sun it rolls round, oh, my
bride you shall be, Before night in my arms I will fondly embrace you." She smiled and consented,
I took her with me. Many years have rolled round since we two were united, Many seasons have
changed, but there's no change in me; My love is as pure as the rose on yonder mountain, That lies
out and gets bleached by the dews of Glen Shee.
