I 
met a 
friend the other night, " Where off to, Brown I" said he. 
I 
told hint, he said, ` No you don't, you'll go along with me ;" 
I 
first said " no" and then said " yes,"—as with a 
knowing look, 
Said he to me. " 
go and seo Miss Sally Jt;o:‘.s, the cook." 
CHOIZUS. 
0, deary me—'twas such a 
spree, I 
never langliEd so hearty, 
By jingo! I 
enjoyed myhelf at Sally Jones, party, 
Well, off we went, on pleasure bent, quite a 
jolly pair, 
Arrived, Smith pulled the kitchen bell. Close to Union Square; 
And when we in the kitchen got, me by the hand Smith took, 
And I 
was kindly introduced, to Miss Sally Jones, the cook. 
0, deary me, &e. 
Now after tea was over, the butler, Mr. Vance, 
He kindly took his fiddle for its to have a 
dance : 
And when the Itityhen floor was cleared, law how the girls did look, 
When the first dance was led by me, and Sally Jones the co- k. 
• 
0, deary me. &c. 
Well, in and out we danced about, upon the kitchen floor, 
I 
thow!ht I'd never leave off dancing any more; 
When suddenly I 
smelt fire, and round to turn did look, 
When the crinoline was blazing away of poor Sally Jones the cook. 
0, deary me, &c. 
We 
got the fire under when Sally began to faint, 
We doused her face with water, which brought off all the paint; 
But as soon as she recovered, my arm again she took, 
And off again 1 
danced lhe mad, with Sally Jones the cook, 
0, deary me, &c. 
Now the supper preparations were all one could desire, 
A 
lovely plump fat leg of pork was roasting by the fire; 
When some one hump against us came without giving a 
look, 
And slap into the dripping pan went Sally Jones the cook. 
0, deary me, & c. 
But you must know, in such a 
mess, Sally picked herself up quick, 
She spoiled her new merino dress, that she had got on tick; 
The boss he returned to town, go to our legs we took, 
But I 
never shall forget the day, or Sally Jones the cook,

She hung her head, and smiled, and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss; 
And when we parted on that night, 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss.— Cho. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And I'd take her here and there, 
And every time I 
got a 
chance 
My passion I'd declare. 
I've vow'd to be true on the top of Saint Paul's, 
On the Underground rail, Richmond Hill. 
At last I 
said, " if she wouldn't wed, 
By jingo! myself l'd kill."—Cho. 
I 
thought it was " right," and so I 
had 
The banns put up " on spec," 
And sent ray love a " sweet silk dress," 
Her darling self to deck. 
Upon the wedding morn I 
called, 
My intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all, and worst of all, 
She'd not made up her mind. 
Spoken—She said she thought— 
Cho.—At first she would, and then she wouldn't, 
And then, somehow, she thought she couldn't, 
And then she said, - I 
really shouldn't," 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty man. 
Well, after that, we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home; 
To one thing, though, my wife objects, 
That's when I 
wish to roam. 
She says that " home's the proper place 
For all good married men," 
If I 
trot out at night I 
have 
To be in bed by ten. 
Spoken—As for letting me have the latch-key--
Cho.— Once she would, but now she wouldn't; 
I 
say " she could," she says " she couldn't," 
She says, " what's more, she's sure she shouldn'f,'"' 
And I'm a 
naughty, naughty man,

At the gay Masque Ball, At the gay Masque Ball, 
I 
am knoWn as the Belle of that charming Ball. 
The first I 
danced with was a 
Gent 
Of the Lord Dundreary school. 
But after waltzing, I 
found out 
His exception to that rule. 
Spoken.—No, he was not exactly a 
Lord Dundreary—but still 
there was a 
decided sttffness about his whole demeanor, which 
made it rather awkward to dance with him, and after every dance 
he'd an incessant habit of saying—Thank yah! Yes 
So do I, 
'Tis very warm, Yes thank yell

We've something novel Wry day, 
As round the world goes moving, 
Invention's always bud at work, 
And on we go improving; 
Fast coaches are not last enough, 
For this high pressure age, sir ; 
The steam engine is quite eclipsed, 
Velocipede's the rage, sir.

On the new Velocipede so gaily, 
You'll see the people riding daily, 
Ey'ry one should try one, ev'ry one should buy one, 
See the new Velocipede. 
Men talk about horse racing, 
Of Epsom gains and losses, 
And how the race depends upon 
The mettle of their horses ; 
The next time that the Derby's run, 
The horses won't be in it, 
Our metal steeds, Velocipedes, 
Will run the race and win it. 
Spoken And the papers will describe the races thusly— 
The Derby Stakes for Velocipedes of all ages. — Grocers

DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN. 
W ritten and Snug by TONY PASTOR. 
Air: —"You May Call M e 
a 
Quiz." 
I'll take this occasion to give you advice, 
It's meant in good part, so receive it quite nice. 
Don't ever be urged to take out a 
kink, 
When you know you don't want it. by taking a 
drink. 
I'll tell you the reason, and this is the why. 
And the truth, if you're smart, you cannot deny, 
There's no luck in a 
drink, I 
tell you again, 
No luck with anything square on the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, what's the use of punishing one's bowels to 
accommodate a 
friend, and keep a 
shingle on some bum-
flier's house ? 
Whisky on the brain is a 
bad complaint, and 
•o is this fashion of 
don't spend all your money in one 
ilouse." and rushing around from gin-mill to gin- mill for 
he sake of a 
familiar nod from a 
bar-keeper, for the pur-
-,)ose of making folks think you're somebody. 
This fancy, 
A' 
a 
man's trying to prove he ain't a 
sardine, always proves 
;lie lad only lacks the pickle to make one. 
These are the 
elnips who chuck their money over the bar as fast as they 
set it. and generally wind up as free-luneh fiends. 
No, no, 
')oys! keep your heads clear, and, above all things, never 
-set rum on the brain. 
There's more I 
will tell yon, and I 
want yon to hear, 
And the truth, laddie bucks, )(nill see will appear, 
Don't spend all you're time at poker and bluff. 
Or keno. or faro, or prize- candy stuff. 
Your friends and yourself %yin serve you the best turn, 
By keeping the money whatever you earn ; 
Don't spend it in hair-grease. or la-da-de-da's, 
Or taking out lady-loves with their maufmas. 
Spoken.—Yes, these are some of the things which young 
.
-:en should avoid ; a 
little game occasionally, however 
• 
armless, is a 
bad thing to get on the brain. 
In most of 
tese games the more you lay down the less you take up; 
[
1J 
•?: 
• 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN.—LCONCLuDED 
and as to making anything out of a 
prize-candy package, 
why, you might as well lay a 
ten- cent stamp on the side-
walk, and wait for some one to come along and cover it, 
with as good a 
show as you have in getting anything out 
of a 
prize-candy package. 
No, no, save your money ; buy 
a 
house, put a 
Bowery girl in it, and set her to work mak-
ing a 
uniform for the expected little la-de-da. 
There's another thing, laddies, on free-love don't bet, 
Against Woman's Rights just make a 
dead set, 
And don't get polities or office on the brain, 
But stick to square labor, and honor you'll gain. 
Be honest, be brave, act square with a 
friend, 
Be true to your country, and money don't lend, 
Your words keep together, stay shady and sane, 
And nothing whatever gets on to the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, above all things. put your foot down on 
these free- love doctrines; give the coming generation the 
same chance to know their daddies that you have had ; 
give a 
woman the right to do anything but make a 
darned 
fool of themselves. 
Don't it sound nice for an old maid of 
sixty to go upon the public platform and cry out against 
these horrid, horrid men; and ain't they high old subjects 
that lecture on the manner of bringing up babies without 
nursing. 
And, above all 
things, don't spend your life 
loafing around, waiting for a 
change of administration, or 
something to turn up. 
Get knowledge, but nothing else 
on the brain, and you'll be hunkie, and that's where the 
duck swims. 
You may call me a 
quiz, you may call me a 
qui, 
But these are the things that are queer to the eye, 
And III tell you in earnest, and tell you again, 
Never get anything square on the brain, 
But- keep it stray oar, whatever you do, 
With freedom to paddle you own canoe, 
As there's nothing so fatal, I 
tell you again, 
As getting any one thing square on the brain.

ALDGATE PUMP. 
Aa Sung by ToNY PesTaa. 
You here behold the remnants of 
A 
blighted, sad young man, 
The victim of a 
faithless girl, 
Forget her I 
never can. 
Ah, she was fair to look at! 
Her sweet name was Betsy Crump; 
The first time that I 
saw her, 
It was close to Aldgate pump. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, naughty Betsy, 
Farewell Bet-y 
Crump, 
I 
never shall forget the gal 
I 
met near Aldgate pump. 
'Twas at the pump we used to meet, 
And then we'd take a 
walk; 
She used to dress so nice and neat, 
And, ob. how sweet she'd talk ; 
But when we used to part, my heart 
With agony would jump; 
And in my sleep -I'd dream sweet dreams 
Of her and Aldgate pump. 
Farewell, ctc. 
But all my dreams ox future bliss 
Were turned to grief and woe, 
I 
found that the cloceitfullfiss 
Had two strigs to.

„rE VUXP.—[Commzeze 
This (b) arrowed up my feelings so 
I 
told her plain and plump 
That either he or I 
must die, 
And I 
swore by Aldgate pump. 
One night, whilst at the usual spot, 
Expecting her to see, 
Some fellow came up like a 
shot, 
And gently colIared me; 
'Twas my sanguinary rival ! yes 
The beau of Betsy Crump; 
Somehow he got me underneath, 
And then began to pump. 
Farewell, itte. 
Spoken—I 
shiver when I 
think of the drenching I 
received at 
/ the hands of that bloodthirsty individual, but nevertheless I 
re-
peat— 
Farewell, ctc. 
I 
don't believe in cold water cure, 
don't believe in love 
Since she's turne] ont a 
viper 
Whom I 
fancied was a 
dove. 
They're ma ried now, and I 
am told 
They've got three children plump 
One's like hei• and one's like „him.= 
And one's lilce Aldgate pump.

sufficiently placid to once more remark—

I'LL STAND SAN 
FOR TO-DAY I'M TWENTY-ONE. 
Suug, by ToNY PASTOR. 
I'm not a 
man who cares for cash, 
I 
like what cash will buy ; 
And when I'm out I 
cut a 
dash, 
There's few more free than I. 
Some fellows want to Tommy Dodd, 
And all that kind o' sham, 
.No" odd man out" for me, my boys, 
I'd rather stand for Sam. 
Spoken. 
None of you Tommy Dodd for me, the " odd 
man's" quite out of my good books, and as Pm not quite 
such a 
Sam as to be done out of glasses round to folks I 
don't care about, by Jove, I'll stand Sam to those I 
do. 
CHORTJS . 
$o come along, boys, I'll stand Sam, 
I'll stand Sam, I'll stand Sam, 
With glasses round or bottles o' chain, 
To-day I'm twenty-one. 
Let other fellows hoard their gold, 
My coin was made to spend; 
And as I've plenty, I 
contrive 
My quantum to expend. 
And while with friends who're well-WA° 
I 
poverty may sham, 
But yet I 
never meet a 
poorer pal 
But what I 
will stand Sam. 
Spoken. 
Mind, I 
like to go to Yorkshire and pay in my 
turn, that's when I'm out with pals as well off as myself, 
but when Pm out with a 
poocer pal I 
don't let him pay. 
I 
say : 
Come along, Sco. 
I'LL STAND SAIL—[CONCLUDED. 
I've started several Yankee themes, 
And then, I 
must confess, 
I've always found it requisite 
To stand well with the press; 
No matter if I 
wrote a 
play 
Or just laid down a 
tram, 
If good, the press would praise it up, 
And I, of course, stood Sam. 
23 
Epoken. 
Take my advice, my boys, and stand Sam oc-
eassionally ; you'll feel all the better for it. 
It's more gen-
erous than tossing, and not so risky, as I 
see our noble 
army of blues have orders to take away any one into cus-
tody found gambling in any way, so follow my example, 
plid say : 
Come along, Sce. 
I 
think, though, I 
shall -soon lay by, 
And settle down in life ; 
When Ma'mselle Right but takes my-eye 
Then I 
shall take it wife ; 
And at our wedding party, you 
Shall all partake of Chum ; 
For on that 
reat occasion I'll 
Most handsomely stand Sam. 
Tpoken. 
Stand Sam—I 
should say so—fancy going with 
Jemina to 
the palace at 
Sydenliam. 
Fare there and 
back, inclusive of cabs and busses— and lunch, two dinners 
and a 
tea, bitter beer and ices, swings and extra shows, 
altogether six pounds seven shillings tor both ,of us; that's 
the style of Sam with'a 'vengeance.

But many guid things in the Highland,

Then first in the big town o' Glasco', 
She wad be a

For she lik'd baith nue° wed,

But the shop no wi' Dougal was canny, 
The NvIii9V and sneeshin' were knne; 
Shell broke, an' the shop it was lockit, 
And she like was to rin free the town. 
But no—soon a

When just at the iron-dcor chreppit, 
Her seven-times cousin Rob Roy.

The Highlandmen then wad be right. 
And tak' what she liket awn. 
Her cousin the Gregarach tell her, 
Her post no for shentlemans be, 
And bid her gang aff to the Highlands, 
And fling awe prison-door key. 
She soon did her biddin', for surely 
Macgregor will fight 
them a'; 
She kens that she never will starve, 
While her sword for the spuilzie she'll draw. 
0

And 0

For there's ne'er a

Wha tak's free his neighbours that have. 
Whenever she land in the Highland. 
The loons wi the red coats be there; 
They're wantins to catch the Mrcgregor, 
But to seek her—they didna ken l‘here; 
So they gripped hersel', Dougal Cratur, 
And draggit her wi' them to gang. 
But she wadna betray the Macgregor, 
Afore she do that, she'll be hang. 
Then hey for the heart that is true, 
Gude luck to the sword in the hand, 
He's nae worth a 
sneeshin' that wadna 
Beside you in jeopardy stand. 
But Dougal got five gouden guineas, 
To show them where Gregarach stood 
And faith she did lead them a 
dance, 
To lilt out o't the best way they could. 
For there was the Lady Macgregor, 
mcny a 
braw kilted lad, 
Wha laid on the Sassenachs brawly— 
My faith they their haffits got claw.c1--. 
Just so did our braw country lads, 
Lay round them at fierce Waterloo; 
Then buzza for the hero wha glories, 
To staad for his country sae true.

THE OLD DUN COW. 
As Sang by Tozsy PASTOR. 
Some miles from here, down in Jersey, 
There stands a 
large frame-house, 
And in that hose there was a 
girl, 
I 
thought would be my spouse; 
Her name was Dolly. 
And she was a 
jolly good-looking girl, there's no doubt, 
She was round and plump, and my heart goes thump, 
When I 
think how she serv'd me out, out. 
CHORUS. 
I 
went many a 
mile over hedge and stile, 
To court this girl, I 
vow, 
I 
fancy I 
see her on the three legged stool, 
Milking of the Old Dun Cow. 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, she'd a 
purple skin, 
And a 
kind of a 
dark green eye, 
With a 
wicked wink, and I 
really think 
To get such a 
girl you'd try; 
For a 
plain gold ring she'd often sing, 
While milking of her cow, and the chorus was, 
"I must be married soon, 
For I'm old enough just now! now I 
now !" 
I 
went many a 
mile, 'rte. 
It was quite by chance, at a 
country dance, 
I 
first met Dolly May, 
She invited me to go and see 
Her milk the cows next day 
Next morn at five I 
was all alive, 
And was quickly off to the farm, 
The cocks all a-crowing, and the cows all a 
lowing, 
But her milking did me charm! charm charm! 
I 
went many a 
mile, Jac. 
Now, every morn at daylight's dawn, 
To milk the cows she'd go, 
Singing a 
song as she tripp'd along, 
No matter frost or snow, 
And the cows seemed pleased, when Dolly had eased 
Them of two or three gallons of milk; 
Though she had a 
large hand, you must understand, 
The palms were as soft as silk ! silk I 
silk ! 
I 
went many a 
mile, eze. 
I 
now regret the day I 
met, 
This false, deceitful maid, 
Make no mistake, I 
was a 
cake, 
To believe all that she said; 
Yes! it was my folly to love this Dolly, 
Too dearly, I 
must say, 
For she's left cow and can for a 
big plowman, 
And was married on last Monday! day !
day! 
I 
went many a 
mile, ctc.

"Oh Randal was a 
bonnie lad when ho gaed awa'— 
A bonnie bonnie lad was he when to gaed 
'Twas in the saxteenth hunder year of grace and threttytwa, 
That Randal, the Laird's youngest son, gaed awa'. 
'Twas' a

To fight the foreign loons in the Hie Germanic',

Oh Itandal's cheeks were roses red when he geed awa;

THE LAY OF THE LABORER. 
AS 
sang by TONT PASTOR. 
It was a 
long, lank Jerseyman. 
And he stoppeth one or two: 
"I'm not acquaint in these here parts. 
I'm a-lookn for Datil Drew. 
" 
I'm a 
laborer in the vinnard, 
My calm!): I 
pursue 
In the Institoot at Madison, 
That was built by Dan'l Drew. 
"I'm a 
laborer in the vinnard, 
My worldly wants are few; 
But I 
want some p 
ints on these ere sheers 
I'm a-lookin' for Datil Drew. 
Again I 
saw that Jerseyman— 
Corner of Wall and New— 
He was looking for a 
ferry- boat 
And not for Dan I 
Drew. 
Upon his back be bore a 
sack, 
Inscribed " Preferred Qu," 
"Canton," " Northwest," •‘ B. H. and E."— 
I 
saw that he'd found Drew. 
And he was short of Old R. I, 
And full of Bourbon new— 
There was never another laborer 
Got just such pints from Drew. 
I 
saw him next at the ferry slip— 
His white cravat askew— 
A 
paving his fare with a 
registered share 
Of that " Preferrred Qu." 
And these words came back from the Hackensack; 
"Ef you want to gamble a 
few, 
Just get in your paw at a 
game o' draw, 
But you hain't no bizness with Drew.

"FLIRTING WITH ME." 
AS 
Sung by Tor PASTOR. 
Ant :—" Winking at Me." 
I'll tell you my troubles as soon as I 
can, 
For I 
certainly am an unfortunate man ! 
Wherever I 
wander, ' tis a 
fact, you'll agree, 
All the girls in the street keep a-flirting with ITIC. 
CHORUS. 
Flirting with me ! 
Flirting with me! 
It's really a 
shame how they're flirting with me. 
I 
rode in a 'bus down the street fother day, 
When a 
charmer she gave me her " fare " for to pay. 
She smiled so bewitchingly that I 
plainly could see, 
Her dear " little game " was just flirting with me. 
Flirting with me, &c. 
My wife and myielf to the theatre went, 
For a " play," why, of course, I 
would spend my last cent, 
My wife got a 
letter, that was dropped on my knee, 
From a 
girl in the box who kept flirting with me 
Flirting with me, &c. 
l'd like to tell all of my woes, but I 
can't— 
I 
have been down to " Long Branch," with " Gen.
.' Grant," 
But while I 
was bathing, to my neck in the sea, 
All the girls on the shore kept a 
flirting with me! 
Flirting with me, &c. 
I'm in such a 
flurry right here where I 
stand, 
You can see now yourself how I'm truly unmanned. 
I'd sing all the evening, but I 
know how %would be, 
There's a 
girl over yonder keeps flirting with me I 
Flirting with me, &c.

MY PET. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Though others may harp on their own darling treasure. 
The name of their favorite often repeat, 
There's naught unto me affordeth such pleasuie, 
As my mouse-colored kitten with little white feet, 
CHORUS. 
My r 
retty, soft kitten ! 
My bright, playful kitten I 
My little pet kitten— 
So loving and sweet! 
She's as sly as a 
fox—so mischievous and cunning, 
And keeps one ear open— e'en when she's asleep; 
She knows in a 
minute whenever I'm coming, 
And springs from the cushion to give me a 
seat. 
My wide-awake kitty! 
My frolicking kitty ! 
My mouse.colored kitty— 
So loving and sweet I 
Lilly may sing of her charming canary, 
Exult in his warbling throughout the long day; 
Emma, enjoying her fair garden—so airy, 
Charmed by the sweets of a 
fragrant bouquet; 
Minnie has chickens, and pet lambs so pretty, 
And little gray rabbits so lively and neat, 
Yet none so cheerful, so pleasing as kitty— 
My mouse-colored kitty—with little white feet! 
My wonderful kitty 
Intelligent kitty! 
My beautiful kitty— 
So loving and sweet! 
JOHN CHINAMAN. 
As Sung by TONY Paszon. 
Ant:—" Green grow the Rushes, 0" 
Now Coolie labor is the cry, 
'.Pat " must give place to Pagan " John," 
Whom Christian bosses, rich and sly, 
Have anxiously the heart set on. 
For he's a 
nice, cheap Chinaman; 
A meek, submissive Chinaman, 
Who ne'er " turns Turk," or " strikes" his work 
For more pay, like the Irishman. 
Good " John" knows no Trades Union schemes, 
Nor what is meant by " scab," or " rat," 
He never calls the boss bad names, 
Or threatens him like saucy " Pat," 
But is a 
quiet Chinaman ; 
A 
harmless " John Chinaman ;" 
A 
mild, contented, patient drudge, 
Or white slave of a 
Chinaman. 
And won't he a 
fine Christian make ? 
The gentle, lamb-like Chinaman, 
And for much toil small wages take, 
The sweet, soft, yielding Cninaman. 
The weak, tea-drinking, Chinaman, 
The shallow- thinking Chinaman ; 
The unassuming, unp resuming, 
Rice-consuming Chinaman. 
No fear that John will Congress " bore," 
'Bout Cuba's belligerent rights 
Or " Alabama Claims," or sore 
Feel, when some cur our standard slights. 
For he's an opium-using man, 
An apathetic Chinaman, 
" 
The powers that be must " surely see, 
The value of John Chinaman.

You'll a

The lad that played the fiddle wee! I 
I

canty chiel, 
And dearly lo'ed Vie whisky, 0 ! 
And aye since he wore tartan hose, 
He dearly lejed the Atli°le brose ! 
And wae was he, you may suppose, 
To play fareweel to whisky, 0 
I 
Alake, quo' Neil, I'm frail and auld, 
And find my blude grown unco cauld! 
I 
think '
twad mak' me blythe and bauld, 
A 
wee drap Highland whisky, 0! 
And yet the doctors a' agree 
That whisky's no the drink for me, 
Saul! quo' Neil, 'twill spoile my glee, 
Should they part me and whisky, 01 
Tito' I 
can get baith wine and ale, 
And find my head and fingers haill, 
11 be content tho' legs should fail, 
To play fareweel to whisky, 0 
I 
But still I 
think on auld langsyne, 
When Paradise our friends did tyne, 
Because somet lug ran in their mind, 
Forbid, like Ilighland whisky, 0 I 
Come a 
ye powers o' music, come, 
1 
find my heart grows unco glum, 
My fiddle strings will no play bum 
To say fareweel to whisky, 0! 
I'll tak' my fiddle in my hand, 
And screw the strings up while they 1! stand, 
To mak' a 
lamentation grand, 
For guid auld Highland whisky, 0! 
THE KISS AHINT THE DOOR. 
There's ineikle bliss in r 
e 
fond kiss, 
Why- le mair than in a 
score; 
But wae betak' the stouin' smack, 
I 
took ahint the door.* 
" 
0 
ladie, whislit I 
for sic a 
fright 
I 
ne'er was in afore, 
Fu' brawly did my rnither hear 
The kiss ahint the door." 
The wa's are thick, ye needna fear, 
But gin i
hey jeer an' mock, 
I'll swelr it was a 
startit cork, 
Or wyte the rusty lock. 
There's rneikle bliss, etc. 
We stappit hen, while Maggie's face 
Was like a 
lowire coal; 
And as for me I 
could hae crept 
Into a 
rabbit's hole 
The mither lookt, sa'ff's how she lookt ! 
Thae mithers are a 
bore, 
An' gleg, as ony cat to hear 
A 
kiss ahint the door. 
There's meikle bliss, cEc. 
The douce guidman, though he was there, 
As wed l 
rnicht been in Rome, 
For by the fire he fuff'd his pipe 
And never fasli'd his thoom. 
But titt'rin' in a 
corner stood 
The gawky sisters four, 
A 
winter's nicht for me they micht, 
Ilae stood ahint the door. 
There's meikle bliss, dr,c. 
"How daur you tak' sic freedoms here? 
The bauld guidwife began. 
Wi' that a

THE BIRTH OF GREEN ERIN, 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
With all condesintion, 
I'd turn your attintion 
To what I 
would mintion, 
Of Erin so green, 
And without hisitation, 
I'll show how that nation, 
Became of creation, 
The gim and the queen. 
It happened one mornm,' 
Without any warnin,' 
That Venus was born 
In the beautiful say; 
And by that same token, 
I'm sure ' twas provokin', 
Her pinions were soakin', 
And wouldn't give play. 
So Yeptune who knew her, 
Began to pursue her, 
In order to woo her, 
The wichked ould Jew: 
And he very nigh caught her, 
A 
top of the water; 
Great Jupiter's daughther, 
Who cried 
Po-ta-to." 
But Jove, the great ganions. 
Looked down, and saw Vanious, 
And Neptune so hanious, 
Pursuin' her wild ; 
So he roared out in thunder, 
He'd tear hint asunder; 
Alf sure 'twas iio woudher, 
For teazin' his child.

THE BIRTH OF GREEN ERIN.—(CoNnumm. 
So a 
sthar that flyin', 
Around him espyin', 
He saized widhout sighin, 
And hurled it below; 
Which tumbled like winkin", 
On Neptune, while- sinkin', 
And gave him, I'm thinkin', 
A 
broth of a 
blow; 
And that shtar was dh7 land, 
Both lowland and highland, 
And formed the srvate island, 
The laud of my birth. 
Hence, plain is the shtory, 
'Rase sent down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary 
Is a 
heaven on earth. 
Shon Vanis jumped naity, 
On Erin so staitly, 
But fainted, kase lately 
So bothered and preshed ; 
Which much did bewilder, 
But e'er it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her 
A 
drop of the best. 
An' that glass so victorious, 
It made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious, 
I 
fear it might prove. 
Then how can yce's blame us 
That Erin's so famous, 
For witisky and fightia', 
And murdher- and love.

"My boy, was ye iver in China ?" 
"Be gob," answered Mick, just handy quick, 
"My boy, and it's damfino." 
Says Cfcsar, the nig, when dancing a

"Does yet- play upon the piano?" 
Miss Dinah replied, as the cuffoe she eyed, 
"My friend, it's damfino." 
And a 
Frenchman one day, when asking his way, 
"Pray tell me is this the Albino?" 
But the stranger said, rough, while taking some snuff; 
.‘ My friend, it's damffno." 
A Dutchman cried, " Here, you haf trank up your beer, 
Now will you hand over the rhino?" 
When the customer swore, when he rushed to the door, 
"Mein friend, it's damfino." 
Said a 
judge in his charge to the jury at large, 
"Come, will you this verdict all signo?" 
When each juror spoke out, with a 
terrible shout, 
" 
You honor, it's dainfino." 
"Has there been a

Was asked of a

WAITING FOR CHARLEY AT UNION SQUARE. 
Ant:—" Waiting for Nally at Temple Bar." 
By H. FITCHETT, Jr., 
Thece's nothing half so jolly 
As courting, 1 
inn sure, 
For so experience teaches me, 
I 
wish for nothing more ; 
As I 
love a 
chap so fervently, 
A most enchanting fel', 
And there's not another I 
declare, 
Can equal Charley Bell. 
CHORUS. 
Waiting for Charley t

Waiting for Charley at Union Square. 
Every night when the stars shine bright, 
I'm waiting for Charley at Union Square. 
'Twas fortunate 1 met with him, 
For with friends I 
used to go. 
And dissipate and waste my time, 
I 
thought. love-making slow. 
And when I 
chance to meet them now, 
They say " I 
stay away," 
Where are you to be met with ?" 
So this is ‘vhat I 
say. 
Waiting for Charley, (tc. 
Industrious my Charley is, 
And works throughout the day, 
Froin Union Square, liot very far, 
Where 1 
so often stray. 
In that neighbohood I 
always am, 
I've oft heard folks declare, 
They'd fail to recognise the spot, 
If by chance I 
were not there. 
Waiting for Charley, itc. 
My hub. my Charley soon will be, 
And then my- task Nv i 
I 
1 end, 
1'll not desert the " Square," till then, 
On that you may depend ; 
And any night that way you stroll, 
Fixed as the evening star, 
You'll find inc vaiding ' near the gate, 
For Ohm ley at Union Square.
