Baby Out of Cut-Open Woman 
 
 
so-called because he was sckweɫťelénč, “cut out of the stomach” 
as an infant.   Indeed, he survived the un/believable, a lucky break, 
to become the only living member of his immediate family.  
 
Another lucky break, he won his race against the cold birds,  
earning the right 
to make a law that they could no longer control all the weather,  
ending the age of ice. 
 
Next, he gathered his families’ bones  
their marrowed limbs, each rib, forearm  
and finger. 
 
 
Covering them with his blanket, he jumped over 
 
  
 
 
four times,  
bringing them, 
each one 
back  
to life.

These are the stories that belong here, 
that pushed up through this soil unfurling  
as arrow-leaved balsamroot leaves and boulders found in unusual  
places.    
 
How else does a thing enter this world  
now so changed we struggle to hear the shapes of a language  
that no longer fits every ear.

ment   
moves 
over hills the highest reaches of trees  
 
 
without catching in memory.   But 
 
the crispness of Snlaq̓ éy of Kʷĺncutn like fire  
crackle the flick of sound a body remembers. 
 
 
(Sckweɫťelénč: “Cut out of the stomach;” the name of the part of the weather, or a weather being, whose actions 
brought about the end to the last Ice Age.  Snlaq̓ éy: Sweat lodge.  Kʷĺncutn: Creator, Maker of Ways/Mannerisms, 
also referred to as Amotqn or Great Spirit.)
