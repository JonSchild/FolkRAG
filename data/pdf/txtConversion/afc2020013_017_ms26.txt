Slowpoke Club 
A Ransomville youth group, with Â· the 
slightly inept name of Slowpoke Club, has 
come up with a plan to keep speeders off the 
streets and highways and on the racetracks 
where they belong. 
The "Slowpokes" are hot-rodders, but 
they're hot-rodders who believe in safety. They 
hold stock-car races in cars with all approved 
safety devices such as crash bars and safety 
belts. They band out trophies to winners but 
they also hand out fines to members caught 
squealing tires, speeding or racing on the high-
ways. 
Two "constables" nail violators who 
are ordered either to pay a fine or get out of 
the club. 
Two sets of brothers, Richard and William 
Cantara and Edward and Douglas Ortiz, the 
club's officers, sparked the plan and soon got 
the support of some. village garagemen and 
merchants. 
The Slowpokes' method may not bring an 
end to reckless driving but, if it could prevent 
only a single tragedy on the highway, it would 
be a worthwhile plan for other communities 
to follow.
