was a

Until t

S
haker Hymn Singer
 
Poland Springs, Maine
 
I
n
 
S
ister Mildred  Barker  i
s  t
he principal  conservator of  the
 
Shaker song tradition.
 
The Shaker sect traces i
ts l
ineage back to the Camisards, a
 
Protestant group who foretold t
he cowing of Cod's Kingdom.
 Ann
 
Lee, t
he l
eader of the group in England, came to the New World to
 
escape  religious  persecution  in  1774,  and  founded  a  Shaker
 
community  i
n  upstate  New  York.
 The  r
eligious  and  social
 
contributions of the United Society of Shakers to American culture
 
are widely acknowledged.
 The  Shaker concern  for  the aesthetic
 
dimension  of  l
ife  has  revealed  i
tself  in  social  behavior,
 
furniture, architecture, textiles, s
ignage, dance, narrative, and
 
song.
 
Shaker hymnody borrowed  widely  from  t
he  Anglo-American  f
olk  song  t
radition.
 As  t
he  music
 
Shakers knew and  l
oved best,  t
hese  traditional  tunes met one of  t
heir major aesthetic  criteria:
 
helping members t
o "unite" in worship.
 
Born i
n 1
897, S
ister Mildred Barker i
s now t
he spiritual l
eader of t
he Shaker Society in Maine.
 
She i
s a person of remarkable musical gifts with a f
ine musical memory and a t
horough knowledge of
 
the  Shaker  r
epertory  and  song  s
tyle.
 She  a
lso  knows  how  to  pantomime  S
haker hymns,  a custom
 
practiced by f
ew Shaker singers today.
 
The services of S
ister Mildred Barker have been outstanding in fostering t
he song tradition of
 
t
he S
haker community, documenting i
t for posterity, and s
haring i
t f
reely with t
he outside world.
 
RAFAEL CEPEDA
 
Bombs and P
lena Musician and Dancer
 
Santurce, Puerto Rico
 
Rafael Cepeda i
s known in Puerto Rico as the patriarch of the
 
bombs  and  plena, two  of  the  i
sland's  best  known  traditional
 
musi al forms.
 
The bombs grew out of t
he colonial African s
lave experience.
 
I
n i
ts style of drumm i
ng,  singin g , an d improv
isational
 dancing,
 
t
he bombs r
esembles several other West African-derived music and
 
dance  f
orms  i
n  t
he  New  World.
 The plena emerged  as  a local
 
popular music around t
he turn of t
his century.  Its spontaneously
 
i
nvented t
exts  with
 group refrain,  one-step dancing,  and lively
 
rhythmic  drive  brightened many  a social  occasion  among  t
he coastal  B
lacks.
 Rafael  Cepeda,  his
 
grandfather, great-grandfather, and now his wife and children have all contributed greatly to making
 
bombs and plena important symbols of Puerto Rican identity.
 
I
n recent years,  don Rafael, his wife,  dons Caridad Brenes de Cepeda, his  three daughters,
 
eight  sons and  t
heir f
amilies have performed  together as  "La Familia Cepeda."  They have toured
 
extensively  i
n  Puerto  Rico,  t
he  United  States,  and  Europe,  bringing  t
heir  art  to  an  immense
 
international  audience.
 Rafael  Cepeda  has  written  more  t
han  600  compositions,  many  of  which
 
appear on commercial  r
ecordings.
 Through his dedication  to  t
he bombs and plena, don Rafael has
 
insured  t
hat  t
his  paramount expression of  t
he Afro-Puerto Rican experience will be carried  i
nto
 
the future.

A mountain f
armer from North Carolina and cousin of Stanley
 
Hicks,  Ray Hicks  t
ells traditional  f
airy t
ales and  l
egends t
hat
 
date back hundreds of years.  "Used t
o be," he says, "whenever we
 
had a long, s
low job to be done, l
ike a cornhusk t
h' or something,
 
we'd just gather all the young '
uns around and put them to work.
 
Then's when we'd tell  t
he o
ld t
ales about Jack.  Why,  them kids
 
would work for hours and never a sound out of t
hem,  long as I
'd
 
keep t
elling t
hem tales."
 
The "Jack" in Ray Hicks' Appalachian tales i
s t
he same Jack who c
limbed t
he beanstalk and killed
 
t
he giant, the hero of a cycle of ancient t
ales of magic and adventure known t
hroughout Europe and
 
around the world.
 When t
he Jack tales were transplanted by immigrants t
o t
he New World, they were
 
adapted  to  f
it  the  experiences  of  t
he  Appalachian  mountain  f
armer.
 The  t
ales  t
ook  on  the  new
 
characters,  local place names and adventures t
hat were part of everyday l
ife i
n t
he region.
 For
 
generations,  t
hese folk tales have been passed down through word of mouth by t
he Hicks  family of
 
B
eech Mountain.
 
Through  his  masterful  s
torytelling,  Ray  Hicks  has  p
layed  a major  r

STANLEY HICKS
 
Appalachian Instrument Maker, Musician and S
toryteller
 
Vilas, North Carolina
 
Instrument maker,  singer, dancer, musician and storyteller,
 
S
tanley Hicks  i
s  a f
ine  representative  of  t
he  f
amily  folklore
 
t
raditions of Appalachia.
 
Born in 1911, Stanley Hicks was r
aised on his parents'  farm
 
in Watauga County,  North  Carolina.
 He possesses  an unswerving
 
devotion  to  the  traditional  ways  and  customs  t
hat  his parents
 
passed on to him from earlier generations of t
he Hicks and Harmon
 
f
amilies of Beech Mountain.
 "You know, back i
n -them days," he
 
says, "we made a lot of stuff.  My grandpa made t
he f
irst pair of
 
s
hoes I ever wore.
 He was a s
hoemaker, made dulcimers, banjos,
 
s
hoes, anything. .
 .
Daddy sharpened mill rocks and made mills and
 
made banjos and dulcimers."
 
Like his f
ather,  Stanley Hicks tells traditional stories and makes f
inely crafted banjos and
 
dulcimers.  Walnut and cherry for the musical instruments come f
rom trees t
hat grow on the ridge of
 
his mountain f
arm.  "
I made my f
irst banjo when I was 15 years old and I
've made t
hem off and on ever
 
since.  We used to use cat hides for banjo heads.  Now I use groundhog hides on mine."
 
He sings the old ballads, too, and when he f
inds himself unable t
o sit s
till any longer, he
 
l
eaps up to dance in t
he f
lat-footed "
jumping jack" style he l
earned l
ong ago.
 
For S
tanley Hicks, to preserve t
hese o
ld traditions i
s to carry forth t
he spirit and heritage of
 
his forebears.  "Here's my dad's dulcimer.  There's his dulcimer he built years ago--it still lives,
 
i
t's still here.
 And s
ame way by myself, when I
'm gone,  t
here's some of my s
tuff for the young
 
t
uns .. . you know, i
t s
till l
ives."
 
JOHN LEE HOOKER
 
B
lues Guitarist and Singer
 
San Carlos, California
 
The  music  created  by  John  Lee  Hooker  makes  an  essential
 
s
tatement about t
he development of t
he b
lues.
 
Born  i
n C
larksdale,  Mississippi,  i
n  1917,  John Lee  Hooker
 
l
earned to p
lay the guitar from his stepfather, a Louisiana blues
 
guitarist.
 At  an  early  age,  he  joined  other  Delta  bluesmen
 
performing at  l
evee camps,  bars  and  f
ish  fry s .  Even  in t
hose
 
days,  his  heavily  percussive  guitar  style  and  dark,  powerful
 
vocals were unique among local musicians.  At 14, John Lee Hooker
 
ran away from home, and eventually joined other southern Blacks
 
seeking  war  i
ndustry  jobs  i
n  t
he  urban  North.
 Settling  in
 
Detroit, he adapted his musical style to suit the changing times
 
and t
he new urban landscape.
 
The extensive repertoire of t
his post-war b
luesman includes early "field holler" forms as well
 
as l
ater styles such as "boogie" and "rhythm and blues."  In 1948, John Lee Hooker made his first
 
r
ecording, "Boogie Chillen," p
laying an e
lectric guitar i
n a new "boogie" style.  The success of this
 
song and subsequent recordings l
ed to his being called "King of t
he Boogie" and being credited with
 
putting t
he "rhythm" i
n "rhythm and blues."  Many early "rhythm and b
lues" and "rock and roll" bands
 
were i
nspired by John Lee Hooker's stomping and soulful b
lues.  His guitar l
icks continue to be found
 
i
n t
he s
tandard repertoire of contemporary bands.

Lanier Headers i
s one of the f
inest, t

still active i
n t
he United S

He r
epresents t
he s
econd generation of potters in a family
 
that took up t
he craft i
n 1893 in the foothills of Mu te County,
 
Georgia.  Historically, his coimnunity of Mossy Creek has been one
 
of t
he l
argest pottery centers in t
he South, supporting more than
 
70 potters since t
he 1820s.  Lanier Headers still practices the
 
a
lkaline-glazed s
toneware  tradition characteristic of  t
he  area.
 
He works l
argely within t
he t
radition of pre-industrial technology
 
t
hat  i
ncludes  a f
oot-powered  treadle  wheel  and  a wood-fired
 
"tunnel" kiln.
 
Born i
n 1917, Lanier learned his craft f
rom his l
ate father, Queever Headers, a
 highly skilled
 
potter.  The Headers were production potters, producing t
he utilitarian wares such as churns, whiskey
 
and molasses jugs, crocks and pitchers t
hat were n
eeded by t
heir north Georgia f
arming neighbors.
 
These wares were made f
rom a sturdy, high-firing s
toneware c
lay glazed with t

g
lazes distinctive of t
he Deep South.
 
After his f
ather's death i
n 1967, Lanier Headers worked hard to keep alive t
he r
egional pottery
 
tradition of his f
orebears.  His vibrant earth-brown, o
live green and rusty-grey g
lazes and strong,
 
straightforward  s
hapes  attest  to  t

l
isted a hundred songs that she could call to mind right then, and
 
t
hen added t
hat she could put down another hundred if she had the
 
t
ime.  S
he i
s a
lways surprising; her retentive memory periodically
 
c
hurns up yet another stunning song, generally in response to a
 
particular set of circumstances or i
n answer to an enthusiastic 
a
n
 
audience  reaction.
 She  especially  l
ikes  the  old  ballads,  or
 
narrative songs, many of which date back to the middle ages.  Her
 
s
tock of hymns ranges  from the  tried and  true  to the  rare  and
 
special, and s

he most elegant versions

known of s

A
lmeda Riddle--who prefers to be called "Cranny"--was born i
n 1898 and has spent most of her
 
l
ife  i
n White or Cleburne County, Arkansas.
 These are  foothill counties, not deep in the Ozark
 
o
n
 
14
 
hills,  and Granny thus did not grow up i
n an i
solated neighborhood.
 Her f
ather's work with the
 
railroad necessitated f
requent moves; f
or t
his reason she was educated mostly at home by her parents.
 
Her f
ather was especially i
nterested i
n her musical  training,  and Cranny l
earned to read musical
 
notation before she could r
ead books.  He a
lso taught her the principles of harmony and to accompany 
o
n
 
songs  on  the  f
iddle  and  parlor  organ.
 He worried  sometimes  that  t
he  o
ld  British  ballads  his
 
precocious  daughter was  l
earning "by ear" would  keep her  f
rom practicing t
he more conventional
 
musical t
echniques.
 
Granny's singing style, s
he c
laims, was strongly influenced by her f
ather, yet it is difficult 
I
N
 
to i
magine a man's voice performing t
he f
alsetto leaps, breaks, and decorations that are such an
 
i
ntrinsic  part  of  her  s
inging  style.
 They  seem  to  come  from  an  attempt  to  keep  the  volume
 
rock-steady, so that she does not a
llow her notes to trail off but cuts t
hem sharply.  Some people
 
describe her as "singing at t
he edge of her voice."  Her singing is not rigidly rhythmic, but she 
i
n
 
displays a strong sense of pulse, which s
he often marks with her right hand as she sings.  She always
 
sings without i
nstrumental a
ccompaniment i
n t
he o
ld a cappella style of t
he southern mountains.  She
 
i
s a true national treasure and a true daughter of t
he Southern Uplands f
rom which so much of our
 
musical heritage has come.

s  one  of  the  l
ast  r
epresentatives  of  the
 
"American" s
tyle of p
laying the uilleann pipes.
 
The  bagpipe  i
s  one  of
 the  o
ldest
 types  of  musical
 
i
nstruments.  A distinctively Irish version of t
he bagpipe, known
 
as t
he union or uilleann pipe,  emerged i
n I
reland i
n the early
 
18th century.  These pipes were distinguished by a chanter with a
 
range  of  two  octaves  and  the  use  of  a bellows  i
nstead  of  a
 
blowpipe t
o i
nflate t
he bag.  The elaborately ornamented style of
 
p
laying t
he uilleann pipes requires great s
kill and dexterity.
 
Joe S
hannon was born in County Mayo, I
reland i
n 1920.  His family emigrated to Chicago i
n 1926,
 
where he has lived ever since.  Joe S
hannon became i
nterested in the pipes i
n his early teens.  By
 
then,  t
he once  great  tradition of playing t
he uilleann pipes had a
lmost completely died out  in
 
Chicago.
 One of t
he last remaining pipers was his uncle,  Ed Mullaney, who gave him rudimentary
 
instruction on  t
his most  difficult of  t
raditional  I
rish  i
nstruments.
 Joe  Shannon a
lso  l
istened
 
avidly to t
he early recordings of f
amed uilleann pipers Patsy Tuohey and Tom Ennis, and from them he
 
acquired  t
he  articulation,  phrasing  and  drive  t
hat  i
s  characteristic  of  early  20th  century
 
Irish-American piping.
 
The virtuosity of Joe Shannon's piping i
s a dazzling source of wonderment to everyone who hears
 
his music.  He has kept a
live a f
ragile musical tradition during a period when i
t might have been
 
lost.
 The  depth  of his  knowledge  and his  dedication  to  Irish  traditional  music can hardly be
 
equalled.

Living  i

t
hird generation of his family to follow t
he coopering trade, an
 
essential craft in t
he isolated,  agrarian mountain community in
 
which he was born  and  raised.
 His  grandfather,  Boyd  Stewart,
 
opened a cooperage i
n 1860.  Alex Stewart's f
ather, Joseph, took
 
over t
he family trade i
n 1880 and passed t
he coopering skills down
 
to his son.
 
Mr. Stewart  makes the  traditional  cooper's wares:  churns,
 
barrels, buckets and piggins, all elegantly crafted and ingeniously joined, without using glue or
 
nails.  He cuts and seasons his own cedar i
n his small sawmill and forges tools i
n t
he blacksmith
 
shop on his f
arm.  "I've made a
ll my tools--matter of f
act, everything I
've got.  My grandfather, I
 
learned t
his f
rom him.  He made everything--wheels, anything t
hat could be t
hought about, be made it,
 
and I got t
he pattern off of his.  And my daddy, he worked at it as l
ong as he l
ived.  I

t s
ince I was old enough t

t--about 10 years."
 
In addition to coopering, A
lex Stewart has been a chairinaker, blacksmith, basketmaker, musical
 
instrument maker, bowl and rolling pin maker, and whittler.
 "I can make anything t
hat can be made
 
out of wood and I don't use nails or g
lue.  I
t's better t
han the stuff you buy, and i
t makes me feel
 
good,  too."  Mr.  Stewart's skilled craftsmanship, his vast wealth of traditional wisdom,  and his
 
s
pirit of s
elf-sufficiency have earned him t
he respect and admiration of his community and nation.

Ada  Thomas  i
s  the  sole  surviving  maker  of  doubleweave
 
basketry of t

Before  European  settlement  of  the  United  States,
 the
 
Chitimacha  Indian  tribe  consisted  of  17  bands  l
iving  across
 
Louisiana.
 They  were  hunters  and  f
ishermen,  but  above  all,
 
they  had  perfected  t
he  craft  of  basketry,  taking  i
t  to  a
 
complexity  and  sophistication  achieved  by  few  other  southern
 
tribes.
 Ghitimacha  basketmakers  took  great  pride  i
n  their
 
t
# 
workmanship
 Their
 elegant
 split-cane
 baskets
 were
 
s
c 
-  
i
ntricately patterned with dyed  strips of red,  yellow  and black
 
i
nto f
anciful designs of nature.  These designs, i
nspired by the local environment, bear distinctive
 
names, such as "Rabbit Teeth," "Mouse Tracks," "Alligator Entrails" and "Blackbird's Eye."
 
By 1900,  Chitimacha Indian lands had been drastically reduced.
 Today only a few Chitimacha
 
I
ndians  r
emain,  most  of  them  l
iving on  a 2
65-acre  reservation  at  Charenton,  Louisiana.
 As  the
 
changing agronomy destroyed the natural habitat t
hat supported the cane and the plant material used
 
f
or t
he natural dyes, Chitimacha baskets became i
ncreasingly rare.
 
Born i
n 1924, Ada Thomas learned t
he traditional Chitimacba basketweaving techniques from her
 
grandmother when she was a young girl.
 During her middle years,  Ada Thomas moved away from t
he
 
Chitimacha reservation to work and raise a f
amily.  After years of inactivity as a basketweaver, Mrs.
 
Thomas r
esumed her i
nterest in the art after s
he moved back  to the Charenton rese rvation.
 It i
s
 
l
argely due to her s
kill and dedication t

today.
 
LUCINDA TOOMER

Lucinda Toomer creates quilts t

of Afro-American artistry and spirit.
 
Born i
n 1
890 on a cotton and peanut farm in Stewart County,
 
Georgia,  Lucinda Toomer has been quilting for a
lmost 90 years.
 
The oldest daughter of s
even children, she learned to quilt from
 
her mother when s
he was a young girl.  "We just had a better time
 
t
han we  do now," Lucinda Toomer  remembers.
 "Everything people
 
had, they made."  Made out of necessity, Lucinda Toomer's quilts
 
are  a  striking  blend  of  beauty  and  utility,  Euro-American
 
materials  and  f
orm,  and  African  and  Afro-American  conceptual
 
design.
 
In s
harp contrast to Euro-American quilts i
n which t
he primary design principles are order,
 
symmetry and  rigid  repetition of motifs  and patterns,  Afro-American quilts are  characterized by
 
i
nnovation  and  improvisation.
 Lucinda  Toomer's  s
trip  quilts  reveal  t
he  p
layful  creativity  and
 
f
ree-flowing variations on a t
heme t
hat pervades other Afro-American art forms, including jazz and
 
blues.
 
Maude Wahiman, s
cholar of Afro-American quilting, writes, "Her visual improvisations establish
 
Lucinda  as  an  artist  i
n  total  control  of her  art  f
orm  in  the  same  way  that  thematic  musical
 
improvisations i
ndicated master jazz musicians."
 
This emphasis on i
mprovisation and t
he use of t
he strip pattern as a unit of design is s
trongly
 
rooted i
n t
he African cultural aesthetic.
 Through her powerful quilt designs, Lucinda Toomer has
 
captured and carried f
orth t
he heritage of her people.

LEM WARD
 
C
hesapeake Bay Decoy Carver
 
Crisfield, Maryland
 
Lem Ward i
s a master d
ecoy carver.
 
Decoy carving i
s a
n i
mportant regional folk craft a
long the
 
coastal and i
nland waterways of North America, where i
t grew out
 
of t
he need to l
ure wild birds t
o be killed for food.  Designs and
 
materials used  i
n t
he carving and decorating of working decoys
 
reflect t
he local needs of t
he decoy maker and t
he customs of his
 
community.
 
Lem Ward and his brother,  Steve,  l
earned  to carve working
 
decoys  from  t
heir f
ather  i
n  the  Chesapeake  Bay  community of
 
Crisfield,  Maryland.
 Trained  as  barbers,  t
hey  began  t
o c
reate  decoys  i
n  1918  as  a part-time
 
occupation.  By t
he 1930s, t
he Ward brothers had brought t
he distinctive Crisfield decoy type--flat
 
bottom, exaggerated head s
hape, and s
imple painted patterns--to a new perfection.  The Ward brothers
 
continued to experiment with various decoy positions and s
hapes.
 They developed t
he technique of
 
"stippling" t
he painted s
urface, and employed an impressionistic painting style to achieve a more
 
l
ife-like decoy.  The quest for realism l
ed Lam Ward i
n t
he direction of decorative bird carving.
 
His central role i
n t
he t
ransition f
rom making working decoys t
o purely ornamental birds has brought
 
him wide recognition.
 
Decoy carving i
s now a widely acknowledged decorative art form.
 Nevertheless, Lem Ward has
 
never forgotten t
he community roots t
hat characterize his t
raditional craft.  As he said, ". .
 .
 it i
s
 
important to t
he carver not merely to have something to c
arve, but to have something that be or she
 
has l
ived with, t
hat has been a part of his or her l
ife or t
he experience of his daily adventures..."
 
DEWEY WILLIAMS
 
B
lack Sacred Harp Singer
 
Ozark, Alabama
 
Dewey Williams has p
layed a major role  i
n t
he preservation
 
and promotion of t
he c
entury-old tradition of B
lack Sacred Harp
 
singing.
 
The tradition of S
acred Harp singing takes i
ts name from the
 
song  book,  The  Sacred  Harp, f
irst  published  in  1844.
 This
 
technique uses differently s
haped note heads to designate the fa,
 
sol, I
s and mi syllables and pitches of t
he musical scale.  First
 
developed i
n New England, S
acred Harp or s
hape note singing is now
 
immensely popular i
n t
he Deep South, but southeast A
labama is the
 
only  region with  a vibrant  Sacred  Harp  tradition  among  Black
 
Americans.
 
Dewey Williams f
irst l
earned this vocal tradition f
rom his grandparents.  Later he studied with
 
two Black singing s
choolmasters.
 By 1938, at t
he age of 40, Dewey Williams was teaching singing
 
schools, a profession to which he has dedicated himself s
ince r
etiring from f
arming.  He is able to
 
key and sing the more t
han 500 songs in The Sacred Ha   I
n 
i
n a
ddition to t
he 7
7 songs in The Colored
 
Sacred Harp, t
he only published collection of B
lack Sacred Harp compositions.  Through his singing
 
schools he has i
ntroduced hundreds of young singers to t
he rudiments of Sacred Harp singing.
 
Dewey Williams  i
s honored  and  respected among a
ll S
acred Harp singers  for his  70 years of
 
leadership and dedication t
o t
his s
turdy and joyful American vocal tradition.  His vivid personality,
 
engaging enthusiasm f
or his music, and compelling vocal s
tyle have helped keep an i
mportant aesthetic
 
tradition a
live.

The 1982 honorees will personally receive their certif-
icates and cash awards in ceremonies at the Festival of
 
American Folklife on the Mall in Washington, D. C. on July 3
.
 
The Festival is sponso re d by th e Smithsonian Institution and
 
the National Park Service.
 Following is a list of the
 
National Heritage Fellows, and background on their art.
 
Dewey Baif
 a
  
Basile, LA
 
An eloquent musician (fiddler)  and spokesman
 
for Cajun culture.  His peo pl e , ex iled  
centuries ago from French Canada, carved a
 
new homeland in the swamps of the Mississippi.
 
Delta and over two hundred years gradually
 
created a new music to celebrate their
 
achievement.
 
Joe Heaney 
An Irishman and a fabled sean nos singer
 
Brooklyn,Ny
 (
balladeer) of great range and
pth.  As
 
Irish workmen helped push the expanding system
 
of canals, roadways, and railways across the
 
young nation, Irish tunes became part of this
 
country's standard repertoire.
 Joe Heaney
 
is one of a long line of Irish bards whose
 
songs speak to our deepest remembrances.
 
Tommy Jarrell A countryman and a mountain fiddler of
 
Mt.  Airy, NC
 storied repertoire and technique.
 The home-
made fiddle was the most important instrument
 
of the frontier, easy to carry along and an
 
orchestra all by itself.
 In Tommy Jarrell's
 
wise and experienced hands, it still is.
 
Bessie Jones 
A Black woman from rural Georgil with a head
 
.
Brunswick,GA
 full of the oldest and strongest songs of her
 
African-American heritage.
 Like Joe Heaney,
 
Bessie Jones sings  the "deep songs" usually wit:_
.
 
out accompaniment; unlike him, her tradition
 
calls for her children and neighbors to sing
 
in harmony with her,  to bear her up, and so make
 
her joyful sound the more joyful.
 
George Lopez 
A sixth generation woodcarver from the Sangre
 
Cordova, NM
 e Cristo mountains of northern New  exico.

Bremen, GA

Bill Monroe
  
Nashville, TN
 
Elijah Pierce
  
Colombus, OH
 
45
 
-3-
A guitarist who lays bare the wit and
 
ironic detachment that characterize the
 
blues of the upland South.
 His brilliant
 
guitar work is almost casually tossed off;
 
his musicianship is impeccable.  Together
 
with his long-term partner, Sonny Terry,
 
Brownie McGhee has influenced many
 
generations of bluesmen and musicians.
 
A singer who has labored tirelessly on
 
behalf of his beloved Sacred Harp music,
 
an American choral religious tradition that
 
dates back at least two centuries.  A song
 
leader and singing school organizer beyond
 
compare, Hugh McGraw's dedication, knowledge,
 
and musical skills have inspired Sacred Harp
 
singing conventions across the entire south.
 
A Mexican-American singer, who began singing
 
in her family "conjunto"  (musical group)
 
as they entertained in small towns along
 
the lower Rio Grande Valley a generation
 
ago.
 She was only six when she began, but
 
her vibrant personality, strong singing
 
voice, and vigorous twelve-string guitar
 
work broughther into early prominence,
 
and many songs now considered standard in
 
the Mexican-American repertoire were first
 
recorded by Lydia Mendoza.
 
A song-maker ,
 a mandolinist, and father of
 
bluegrass.  Once described as "folk music
 
in overdrive",  this brilliant musical style
 
takes the familiar Amer
 ican country string
 
ensemble of fiddle, banjo, guitar, and
 
mandolin into a new dimension.  Bill Monroe
 
is one of the few living American musicians
 
who can justly claim to have created an
 
entire new musical style.
 
A carver and painter who began to carve wi t
h
 
pocket knife at the age of nine.  Beginning
 
with traditional forms,  such as walking
 
sticks, Pierce later came to carve free-
3tana na fi ures and then lar ge e_aDorate
 
as-reliefs  f 3i iical scenes and ?ers0na.
 
experiences.
 His "sermons in wood" reflect
 
the importance of traditional religion in
 
much Afro-American folk expression.
 
Adam Popovich
 
Dolton,  IL
 
Georgeann Robinson
  
Bartlesville, OK
 
Duff Severe
  
Pendleton, OR
 
Phillip Simmons
  
Charleston,  Sc
 
-4-
A senior musician and a principal shaper
 
of the American  tamburitza, the most
 
important form of traditional music in
 
older Serbian and Croatian-American
 
communities.
 Like bluegrass, tamburitza I
 
music is played by small ensembles of
 
stringed instruments improvising end-
lessly and brilliantly around traditional
 
melodies.
 Unlike bluegrass, tamburitza
 
singing is full-throated, liquid and
 
choral.
 Adam Popovich i
s master of both
 
voice and instrument.
 
A member of the Deer Clan of the Osage
 
Tribe and one of the most skilled
 
practitioners of the Osage art of ribbon-
work, a needlework tradition that features
 
striking geometric designs executed in
 
brilliant bands of contrastive color. 
t o
 
Mrs. Robinson works from designs she has
 
learned from old Osage women and research
 
through family and museum collections, 
I
n
 
becoming both scholar and artist of this
 
almost lost tradition.
 I
_
u
 
A saddlemaker and rawhide worker.
 His
 
work occupies a central place in con-
temporary Western folk art.
 Well-made,
 
well-crafted saddles, reins, bits, and
 
bridles are the occasion not only for
 
expert craftsmanship but for the 
4 4
 
of an aesthetic dimension in silver inlay
 
and engraving,  in leatheiirork  and design,
 
in rawhide and in horsehair work.
 
Duff Severe is legendary throughout 
1
_ 4
 
the western States for his mastery of
 
all these crafts.
 I
.
 
A blacksmith and ornamental ironworker
 
from South Carolina exemplifies skill,
 
excellence and a deep knowledge of
 
traditional design.
 The lacy tracery of
 
black iron spearpoints,  leaves, and
 
scroi.s  eccra ing :omes and ;ar ens
 
through Charleston and other
 
ort:nate
 
southern oi: es are owed  to  :e work
 
of such skillful artisans as Phillip Sir ni
 
his many apprentices and fellow workers.

Sanders (
Sonny)  Terry 
—
 A master musician, peerlessly
 
Holliswood, Long Island,
 inventive, who has developed his tiny
 
NY
 instrument, the simple harmonica,
 
into a mini-orchestra.  When Sonny
 
whoops  the blues, one often does
 
not know which voice is speaking,
 
the instrument or the man.  The
 
balistic movements of his hands,
 
the c
o
n
stant interplay between voice
 
and instrument, the infectious beat
 
of his music distinguishes him among
 
all American folk musicians.
 
The actual awards ceremony will take place at the final
 
evening concert of the Festival of American Folklife.  The
 
concert is jointly sponsored by the Office of Folklife
 
Programs at the Smithsonian and the Folk Arts Program at
 
the Endowment.
 
The announcement of the first National Heritage Fellows
 
culminates nearly two years of special effort by the Endow-
ment's Folk Arts Program to devise a meaningful program
 
for recognizing the contributions of outstanding folk artists
 
across :he nation.
 
The progr a
m is open to exemplary master folk artists and
 
artisans who are nominated by one or more citizens for the
 
one-time-only National Heritage Fellowship.  Qualifying
 
criteria are authenticity, excellence, and si1nificance within
 
a particular artistic tradition.  Those nominated should have
 
a record of ongoing artistic accomplishment at a level which
 
would make them worthy of national recognition.
 Selection of
 
the fellows is by peer panel review from among those nominated.
