I Won't Marry at All

I used to have a sweetheart dear, And I was most happy when he was near. But one day
he pierced my heart with a spear, So now I'll not marry at all.
So, I'll not marry at all, at all, I'll not marry at all, at all, I'll not marry at all, at all, I'll not
marry at all.

marry at all, at all, And I'll not marry at all.

all, at all, I'll not marry at all.

marry at all, at all, And I won't marry at all.
