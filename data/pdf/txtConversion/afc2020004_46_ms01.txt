like any good indian woman  
 
i pull my brothers from words, stupid injun, shot like bullets. when people 
ask why my brothers hated school i say: the spirit remembers what it’s like 
to be left behind when america took children from homes, displaced 
families with rupture, ripping a child’s hand from a mother’s to put them 
in boarding school buildings. my brothers are mourning a loss they try to 
fix in finding home in another person, so they travel from reservation to 
city singing blues and 49 songs about love. 
i pull my brothers from cars named after indians: 
navajo, cherokee, & tacoma. on a danger destined road my brothers are born 
longing for a way back from relocation & long walks across miles & miles 
& miles of removal. my brothers search for themselves in unhealthy 
addictions disguised as makeshift bandages.  
i pull my brothers from bottles they think answers might 
be hidden at the bottom of. my brothers stumble through back alleys 
looking for a love & laughter that was stolen from them like the land. and 
when their brown bodies try to find healing & love, other brown bodies 
cringe at their touch because like any good indian woman, our bodies are 
connected to an earth, still being raped by the pipelines forcibly laid down 
inside all that we hold sacred. and my brothers hold onto their colonial 
emotional baggage so tightly they think it’s gravity 
so i pull my brothers from oceans believing 
they deserve the hurt so much they nearly drown themselves in it. and 
sometimes my brothers knife ancestral grieving onto their wrists, slits to 
remember the only time we are ever red, skinned is when blood flows from 
the open wounds america knifed onto our brown skin. self-love: apply 
pressure.  
i pull my brothers from 
ashes. america tried to burn us not knowing we were already flame.  
 
& these will be the stories i tell my grandchildren when one day, they ask 
me – why being a good indian woman means we burn like phoenix 
repeatedly pulling our brothers.
