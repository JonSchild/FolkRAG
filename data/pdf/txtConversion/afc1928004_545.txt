Now here we are, fine Irish coppers, you will all agree, 
That with the members of our force, we're happy as can be, 
With our determination, we are a 
holy show. 
We are the concentration of, the glorious Mac's and 0-0'a. 
Then it's up and down our beat we go, with our clubs 
about just so, 
Every man his place does know, in Murphy's Police Squad, 
The divil a 
bit of prida we know, but our pluck we 
always show, . 
When we're out on duty, in old Jerry Murphy's Scaled. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's Jerry Murphy's Squad, they work and tug so bard, 
W 
hers out on drill they'r stiff and still, as any 
Etnperor's Guard. 
You ought to see them stand, when the captain 
gives command. 
For you have to be a 
solid man to stick in Murphy's Squad. 
And when we're on our post my boys, like statues 
we do stand, 
When the haies go to cross the street we always lend a 
hand, 
We raise each lady gently, give them a 
lift or two, 
They exclaim with admiration, ain't they darlings 
dressed in blue, 
Then it's up and down our beats we go, with our clubs 
about just so, 
Every man his place does know in the Murphy Police Squad, 
The divil a 
bit of pride we know, but our pluck we show, 
When we're out on duty in old Jerry Murphy's Squad.

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen ; 
A

In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS. 
Rise it, Reilly! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly ! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet bad better Omit, 
When in the chorus wild they shout, Rise it Reilly! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd scorn to have the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor. 
The " Rocky Road " is startin', 
A 
tune they luve so well, 
'Tis now the ruction boornin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
A. few nate words of blarney, 
ho some bright buxom lass, 
A

And soon the shrieks of music,

When up and once again

It's lightnin' points I

In 
collar and elbow." 
I

Then I

I'd crack their necks if they'd not drop, 
For I 
can down them all.

I'll toss Muldoon and Bauer too, 
And make McLaughlin sick, 
I'll break the honk of Miller 
With my Greco Roman kick.

A horse or a 
stone wall, 
I'll even wrestle with a 
mule, 
For I 
can down them all.

I 
live with Widow Higgins, 
In her famous boarding house, 
Which used to be before my time, 
As quiet as a 
mouse. 
But with my sweet accomplishments, 
And style so very cute, 
There's lots of fun for every one, 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
CHORUS. 
Tootle- a-- toot. I 
play the flute, 
So lively and so gay, 
I 
charm the neighbors all around, 
And pass the time away. 
My tootle-e-toot sweetly played 
Would charm the savage ute. 
The boarders are enchanted quite, 
With Finnegan and hie flute. 
Some say I'm quite distracting, 
And I 
ought to be suppressed, 
They threrten me with lynching, 
if I 
don't give them a 
rest; 
But on I 
play NA ithout dismay, 
Th.' they cull me a " galoote, " 
They inu,:t not, date to interfere 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
I 
don't belong to Gilmore's Band, 
Nor any batid at all, 
But play for scciability, 
At many a 
private ball. 
'Twas at Maloney s 
raffle 
There was such a 
great dispute, 
And down the stairs they threw at once 
Both Finnegan and his flute. 
I 
charm sweet widow lligc,Yins, 
And her daughter Rosy Jane ; 
We duet on the piano 
\ 
ith such a 
sweet refrain. 
And if she does not smile on me. 
Or her sweet voice is mute, 
I 
go into the parlor, and 
charm her with my flute.

And it's soon I'm going to claim her as my bride—for,

And it made my heart with joy beat, I 
will own, 
'I hen quickly I 
did glide, 
To the garden by her side, 
And we walked and talked together until noon. 
And she said her estrents were willing, 
And their consent they had given, 
And we are going to marry very soon— tor,

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are tr3ing the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS'. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con- nun-arum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants, 
Cho, 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend l'addy Brock, 
We tho t

to try ri.Acti of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried. there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar- tender shot Inc a 
glance, 
Howld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Mickey Flahrity is a

He's a

He's educated illegant, 
And he came twin Erin's Isle. 
He likes the girls, with their flowing curls, 
And I

His ways are like some Duke or Lord, 
He's a 
darling Fla,lirity. 
CHORUS. 
lie plays the " cordion," 
And the barmonicon, 
On the old bag-pipes he's as lively as a 
flea, 
And the jigs do spin from his violin ; 
He's a 
thoroughbred with side whiskers, 
Is my Mickey Flahrity. 
Mickey took me out for a 
ride one day, 
In an Irish jaunting car, 
He drank so many whiskey slings, 
He was per-pen-dic-u-lar, 
Says he. " more drink," ' twas a 
bottle of ink,

I 
sang in praise of kisses, 
As a 
soft and gentle hint, 
And soon upon my lips, my love 
A 
greeting did imprint ; 
But while intoxicated 
With its measure deep of blise, 
Alas! my mamma witness was, 
Of our delicious kiss. 
"Au explanation I 
demand," 
I 
heard to my dismay, 
And in such trembling accents then, 
I 
ventured this to say. 
CHORUS. 
I 
couldn't help it, ma, 
I 
really couldn't ma; 
He spoke so sweet, and said, 
I 
was his guiding star. 
He showr d 
kisses fast, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
couldn't sto p) 
his kisses, ma, 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds, 
I've surely had my share, 
From formal kiss of friendship, 
To love's salutation rare; 
But of them all I'm free to own, 
The so+ eetest one by far, 
Was the first kiss of love which °pea 
The eyes of my mamma. 
her voice how quick our dream did change, 
From plea sure unto pain, 
Ah! bow I 
faltered, when in tears 
• I 
softly did explain.

Last winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilv did you say, 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man MeGuiness didn't get no job at all. 
The politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him pt. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dtn't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn tor to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring tin ir money home, taste 110 gin or wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and mine. 
Chorus. 
Ah ! the spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
handsome clerk. 
You soould see him climbthe ladder as nimble as a fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is always bawling, hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
Alt ! the old man he is always careful, nothing he lets fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to toy old man at all.

I 
am bard up, you don't know me, 
For my clothes are tat'ed and torn, 
My parents died when I 
was young, 
I'm forsaken, dislikd and forlorn. 
I've travTd this country thro' and thro,' 
On the road and on the rail, 
limbs are getting stiff and cold, 
For the want of a 
warm meal. 
CHORUS. 
They say why don't you go to work, 
Whed they know there's none to be had, 
They slam the door in front of your face, 
If you ask them for a 
bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to door, 
And they ask for charity, 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't support their family, 
But place e 
nickle in their hand, 
To some grog shop they will run, 
A poor man's money they will take, 
And spend it all for rum 
CHORUS. 
Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak aud sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw, it away 
From a 
workingman's poor family. 
'Twits at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapped at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave inc bread and tea, 
lie was a 
son of Erin's Isle, 
Toiling for his family.

We walked the town in search of work, 
Faix we did seek for graft. 
We met a

He treated us to lager beer, 
And enlisted us next morn, boys, 
In the Irish Volunteers.

We felt so gay as we marched away, 
With thoughts of ould Erin's Isle, 
Our guns shone bright in the clear sunlight, 
Oh

In suits of blue we marched two by two, 
The girls gave hearty cheers, 
For old Erin's boys, brave soldier boys, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
They dressed us up in soldier clothes, 
And faith drilled us three times a

Received orders from head-quarters,

To fight the red-skin Indilns, 
And the " Nagur " fusileers ; 
The knapsacks were shot off our backs,

And shipped us to New York City,

Darling, I 
have roamed to-day, 
'Mid the scenes of long ago ; 
Change has taken all away, 
That we lovEd and cherished so. 
Time has touched both cot and tree, 
Friends we knew no more remain, 
And I 
found naught left to-day, 
But the old church down the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Dear old church down in the lane, 
It brings back with a 
fairy spell, 
Bright and beautiful again, 
Days, dear heart, we loved so well, so well. 
To its walla the ivy clings, 
And the roof was green with moss ; 
Crumbling are the stones where sings, 
Lark and thrush amid the dross. 
It is going to decay. 
From the touch of time and rain, 
Just as we are love, to-day, 
Like the old church down the lane. 
Chorus. 
Long I 
stood beside the door, 
Dreaming of the joys we know, 
In the golden days of yore. 
When we I 
crossed its porch with you, 
When we left it hand in hand, 
For our journey o'er life's main ; 
Drifting back upon the strand, 
To the old church down the lane.

In looking at the lads and lassies on the green; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coining, but she hasn't come as yet; 
The tiuth seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe Ii- r 
true, 
Sbe'a my darling blue-eyed scotch Lassie Jean.

Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, eome to your laddie

You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch la ,sie Jean.

She said you would meet ms, but I've waited long in vain— 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
promise she will keep— oh ! break it, not my Jean ! 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let me long not wait, let me meet thee 
soon, my Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and blirs abov e.

The miller long has gone to rest, 
The clanking wheel hangs still, 
For everything has gone to ruin, 
but the old bench near the mill. 
Old winter's snows have come and gone. 
Spring hatli decked with beau' eons flowers, 
The trysting place where you and I 
Have passed such happy hours. 
Now I 
wander there alone, 
Yet fancy oft cloth fill 
The spot where I 
have held thy form, 
On the 
ld bench near the will, 
Chorus. 
They tell m^ thou art gone my own, 
To a 
home beyond the skies, 
Gone where the stars are shining gold, 
Where friendship never dies. 
When the messenger cloth come, 
To bid this heart he still. 
Dlay we find in heaven another spot, 
Like the old bench near the mill.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day toy infant died, 
This day one year ago. 
A 
tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's bin-tainied air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in sweat compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
his lireless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one ye:tr ago, to-day,

In meek submission bow I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
He only took unto Iliniself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sending tears will start, 
And longly I 
crave to clasp ' 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reio.ns, 
I'd ask to d 
well with angel bribes, 
Ever singim2; heavenly strains ;

Good evening, kind friends, I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
It's of dear old Ireland the sweet land of song, 
I 
will sing you of heroes, of men iron-hearted, 
Of brave ones, and of true ones, to Ireland belong, 
For the day we are longing when we'll see Erin free, 
And all sons of Ireland strike for liberty, 
For starved and oppressed they're stricken with awe, 
They're driven from Ireland, and Erin go Bragh. 
CHORUS. 
Then farewell to Ireland, the place I 
was born in, 
Farewell to Erin, the fairest of earth, 
Farewell till liberty on tra is dawning, 
Farewell to Ireland the land of my birth. 
The sweet girls of Erin are hopeful yet weeping, 
They're singing for freedom which to them belong. 
And the heroes of Ireland whose name I 
will mention, 
Whose fame in Irish hisCry is twirked very strong. 
There was Daniel O'Connell a 
well known hero bold, 
And brave Robert Emmett, we're always been told, 
They fought for old Ireland were true to the core, 
They Loved that dear shamrock and Erin go Bragh.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
CIIORUS. 
Go for my boy for T 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing. 
Chills the poor wanderer, friendless, afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is lie going? 
Must he repose ' neatli the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking, 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Chorus. 
CONTINVID. 
Oh ! 
how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting. 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy; 
While with his evil companions lie's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home be has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day I 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of loit friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcume her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, dte. 
Go for my boy to-night 
search through the city I 
Tell him that mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy; 
Bear him this message, where'er he is straying, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Go for my boy, dm.

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed ; 
I'm the father of a 
lhtle boy, 
I'm not happy, but I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she wants him Michael, 
Her sister wants him Matt, 
Rtr brother wants him Charlie, 
.Whilst her aunty wants him Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus, 
And my father wants him Paul, 
I 
do declare, I 
don't know what, 
I'll name the child at all. 
'Twas only 'here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy. 
He swore by this, he swore by that, . 
That he would name the boy.

I'll Name the Boy Dennis, or; no .

Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie,

And my father wants him Paul, 
By heavens sure I 
don't know what 
I'll call the child at all. 
Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I'll tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their conniving., 
I 
in bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all.

TV name is McNamara, I 
came from County Clare,-
In the darling little isle across the sea ; 
Where the mountains and the hills, the lakes and 
ripplirg rills; 
Are singing sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home ; 
I 
bid them all good-bye, with a 
tear-drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, of work I'm not afraid, 
if it's pleasure to you I 
will sing or dance ; 
I'll do anything you say if 
only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, I 
tried hard to get work, 
And I 
traveled through the streets from (-Ply to-day, 
I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help, they say. 
Bnt still I 
wandered on, a 
hoping to find one 
That would oive a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But then it's all the same, for I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And oftentimes I 
wished that I 
was dead. 
Chorus. 
But I 
know I've one kind friend, who will lend a 
helping hand' 
To a 
poor boy, an d 
to help him on at home ;  
I 
will bring my mother here, and my little sister dear, 
And never more again from them to roam. 
I 
will try to do what's right, I 
will work both night and day, 
Yes, I'll do the very best I 
can 
And God will bless the heart that will take a 
poor 
boy's part,

And thinking of the good olden times, 
When we were all schoolmates together, 
And need to sing Old Grimes, 
When mother mended my old clothes, 
In the good days of old Lang Syne, 
And she every day told all us boys and girls, 
"That a " &kat in Liwe saves nine.

So make hay while the sun does shine, 
And remember the adage so often told,

Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dodeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a

And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green,"

Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGui -mess swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the baud, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
-He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

Beneath the greenwood tree, 
And if I'd tell, you'd not believe,

Life's winter now is on my heart, 
And all to me seems dark and cold, 
Since we must sadly drift apart, 
walo, to wake from that sweet dream of old. 
Now bitter are the years to me. 
That bring no calm or sweet repose; 
But while I 
roam life's restless sea, 
No time can sts.al affection s 
rose. 
CHORUS. 
The world to me is d‘rk and cold, 
With but one dream as on I 
go, 
Yet in life's winter dreAry fold 
That rose, that rose will blossom in the mummer. 
The spell you east about my way, 
Will ever with m0 surely last , 
But hope once bright now must decay, 
And all, yes, all that on love's shrine we cast, 
Tho' I 
may roam from you afar, 
'Mid summer flower's or winter's snows, 
Thy name shall be my guiding star, 
No time can steal affection's rose. 
No day so bright but has its night, 
The night is near, the day must go ; 
The birds of song may take their flight, 
That rose still blossoms in the snow. 
The buds of friendship may be dead, 
Yet sadly will its tendrills close,; 
While other joys I 
ptized, have fled, 
No time can steal affection's rose.

There's a 
dear spot of land far out on the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be-sure, all the while. 
They shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Noblensons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Borogline, and our bold Emmett too, 
8aw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine, 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are secoed to none. 
For their beauty is really sublime. 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock, 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet smile, 
Dear land of-my birth, garden soot of the earth, 
You're my idol fair Erin's Green Isle.

The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled, 
United all like brothers we'll join hand in hand, 
We'll drive the proud Saxon away from our land. 
The land is the people's and who dare dinpute, 
The word of our Maker, for He ', flake the truth, 
Then descend from the hill and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin.

Give me back my dear old borne that I 
used to love so well, 
In the dear old sunny south so far away, 
Where the breeze is softly sighing Biro' the trees every night, 
And the mocking-bird sings sweet the livelong day. 
Take me back, oh! take me back to that old familiar spot, 
And Biro' the cotton fields, oh! let me roam; 
For, I'm old and feeble, and before I 
leave this land, 
Let me see once more my dear old Southern home. 
CHORUS. 
'Take me back. take me back, 
Take me back to my dear old southern home 
Take me back, take me back, 
Take me back to my dear old southern home. 
'They were happy, happy times, at the old plantation home, 
When at night we would play the old banjo ; 
I 
was a 
picaninny and my heart is light and gay, 
But the days tho' short they seem, are long ago. 
I've traveled the wide world o'er and in distant lands 
have roamed, 
But the dear old sunny south I 
love the best, 
Take me back and leave me there in my dear old 
southern home, 
In the dear sweet sunny south lay me to rest. 
Chorus. 
We may never meet again for my time is drawing near, 
When I'll have to leave ibis world tor evermore ; 
So then take we back to die in the dear old sunny south, 
Where my wife and children have been laid before. 
Old ma:sa and old Inisus they w . re always kind to me, 
But they've both gone to the better land I 
know, 
xtilyae—,\ 
Aare, no grief, nor pain, comes to cloud 
their aged brow, 
To that bright and happy land I 
lung to go.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer, 
In the azure- tinted sky ; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Win 
rile Wane. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the ‘vOrds of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go among the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with pain, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er our wiosome Winnie Wane.

Once upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden, 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honey-suckle fair to see; 
And the maiden watched the blossoms daily, 
heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent above it singing ever gaily, 
Every bud end every blossom knew. 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Came a 
sudden dainty frown; 
Jealous was the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love she did not know, 
No I 
greater love she did not know, 
Know, know, know, know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave, and full of manly grace s 
Whispering lender words he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny smiling fan% 
Underneath the honey- suckle walked they, 
But her eyes were cast demurely down; 
Seeing not as softly, sweetly talked they, 
flow its leaves were turning sere and brows 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the vine. 
Careless is the maid I 
trow, 
Greater love hath learned to know, 
No I 
greater love hath learned to know, 
Know, know, know, know,

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I

Flowers of the wild wood and home by the river. 
Yen gone are the joys that were once dear to me.

Once more in my fancy I

That flowing streatulet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old mill. 
Forest o: oaks where the sweet birds were singing. 
And roses abloom 'neath the fair summer sky, 
In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
Of days I

Days of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the pint with their merry good cheer ; 
Bloom of the valley from May to December.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow- W01111 soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Dance.) 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer day is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes. ( Dance.)

THE DAY I 
TOOK MY PEGTO CONEY ISLE.

Sung by Kerrigan & McCarthy, the Irish Pipers. 
Copyright 1880 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the while. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water • sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
'1 hey all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached, the pier, 
We weet . and. had some beer, 
And after.that, ere.weet and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk abeet your fat woman 
That trayeled with. Barnum s 
show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang commenced. to guy us, 
My bosom was on. fire. 
When the gang gave tome a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
Beheave us" shouted out, ( Chorus. 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feet mad, after listening to that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life thilt•I would break his heart, 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
can tak..: my own part all the while. 
Arrah-tnusha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her bead, 
Before I 
bring her again to Coney Isle. 
Chorus.
