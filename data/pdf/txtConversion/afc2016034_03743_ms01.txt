that shared their information with Ramsey County; a committee is looking at how 
coordinated entry works with culturally specific populations; fair housing laws may not allow 
prioritizing Native American youth; 
00:04:46 Discussion of coordinated entry; youth used to have to call many places to seek 
service/shelter; coordinated entry means you make one contact and are then assigned 
services based on a score of your needs; challenges include reaching young people once 
their "turn" comes up; window for getting that service is small; Ramsey County began 
coordinated entry in June 2016; 
00:07:42 Discussion about youth homelessness, specifically Native American youth; Ain Dah Yung is a

outside; camping; 
00:09:10 Outreach Team will talk with anyone homeless under age 24, but especially seek Native

drawn to this work due to their backgrounds with trauma; 
Challenges of this work; as an outreach worker, trying to find shelter for a youth when beds 
are full, below zero in a Minnesota winter; as a program coordinator, funding is challenging

care and data entry and other administrative duties;
