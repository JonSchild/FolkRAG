THE OLD HOME. 
A Negro Sketch, by W ILLIAM H. 
TRIMBLE. 
CHARACTERS. 
UNCLE JEFF. 
GEORGE ANDERSON. 
Scene.—A 
desolate plantation. 
Sett Cottage R., with rail fence 
at back. 
Cane brake on flat. 
Enter Uncle Jeff. 
JEFF.—ITern I 
am at last. 
(Looks around.) '
Tis now forty 
years since T 
left home. 
Eberything am changed now. I 
won-
der if ole massa am still libin'? 
But no; de ole—good kind olo 
massa—am dead by dis time. 
I 
wonder if any oh de ole folks 
am libin' yet ? 
I 
feel so tired. 
Seats himseff on stump.) 
When 
I 
think ob de ole man, it makes me weep, fo' massa was always 
good an' kin' to me. 
(Enter George from cottage.) 
Master, can 
you tell me if ole Massa Stono am libin' yet? 
Is ole Masse, 
der d? 
GEORGE.—Yes. 
111 go and attend to them black devils, and 
see what they are making all that noise for. 
JEFF. — Yes, you am worse dart a 
black debil. 
Dey am black 
folks, but dey hab a 
white heart. 
How folks am changed! 
When I 
was young no one would dar' to speak in de manner 
dat white trash does. 
Time changes all things. 
Yonder on de 
hill was de place whar my ole wife Hannah an' I 
once libed; 
but dey am no cabin dar now. 
And dar, whar dat ole cottage 
is, was Massa Stone's cottage, but it am wasted away. 
Yonder 
under dat ole tree is whar de darkies used to gather, and play 
de banjo an' sing an' dance. 
What happy days dey was deal 
Massa an' ole Missis am dead an' gone, an' dar am no one lef 
but me; an' it mos' breaks de ole man's heart to think dat de 
Ile home ain't what it used to bo. ( Sina,v) 
THE OLD HOME AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE. 
Be ole home ain't what it used to be, 
De banjo an' fiddle dey am gone; 
An' no mo do we hear de darkies singin', 
Among do sugar-cane an' corn. 
Great changes hab come to de poor culled man, 
But di s 
change makes me sad and forlorn; 
Fo' no mo' do we hear de darkies singin ) 
Among do sugar-cane and corn. 
Cif ouus. 
No, de ole home ain't what it used to be, 
De change makes me sad and forlorn; 
Fo' DO more do we hear de darkies ingiu' 
Among de sugar- cane — I' corn. 
In de fields I 
hab worked when I 
thought ' twas hard, 
But night brought its pleasures an' its rest; 
In de ole house down by de ribber side, 
De place ob all de best. 
Oh, whar are de children dat once used to play, 
In de lane by de ole cabin door; 
Dey am scatter'd now, an' o'er de world dey roam, 
Be ole man will neber see dem more. 
No, de ole home, etc.. 
Now de ole man would rather libed dan died, 
In de home whar de children were born; 
But when freedom came to de culled man, 
He lef' de cotton field an' corn. 
Dis ole man has libed out his threescore and ten, 
An' he'll soon hab to lay down and die; 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better lan', 
So now, ole cabin twine, good bye. 
No, de ole home, etc,.

Enter Susie, who sings.) 
No doubt you all have heard the song, 
Of father dear come home; 
And the fate of 1.ungry little Ben, 
Who sent for :lint to come. 
16 
How de ole man used to smile, 
And cause de family, pain; 
He'd let up for a 
little while, 
And then get drunk again. 
Cnottus. 
We've given him up for gone, 
He's lying in do lane; 
And almost everybody knows 
De old man's drunk again. 
(Goes to Dan and sings).— 
Oh, father dear, come home, 
Stop drinking like a 
sow; 
You drank up all the furniture, 
Don't swallow up the cow. 
And don't abuse poor mother, 
And cause de family pain; 
For you will treat us all so mean, 
For you are drunk again. 
(Dan wakes and sings)— 
I 
was dreaming of your mother, 
And the little ones at home; 
I 
thought you all did leave me, 
And I 
was left alone. 
I 
thought your mother died, 
And you were in great pain; 
I 
thought your mother asked me 
Not to drink again. 
But now I 
will stop drinking, 
And go right home with you; 
And then we'll be so happy, 
'Won't we, my little Sue? 
I 
know dat it grieves you, 
And causes you all great pain; 
As long as I 
ever live, 
I'll not get drunk again. 
(Both)— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, father, he'll ( I'll) stop drinking, 
And cause us no more pain; 
We 
all will be so happy now, 
He (I) will not drink again.

good many chances in dis world. 
M.—Oh, yes. 
B.—Some fellows take a 
good many overcoats, and a 
heap of 
nedicine, and they keep taking chances like that all their lives. 
Yes sir, life has many chances—so's Christmas turkeys; their 
3hances are in-dire-ing.. 
You take an in- ant when he's born; 
see the paregoric chances he takes, and if he's putty, see the 
two lips he's got to eat; and when he grows up, see the barrels 
of oil he's got to use in his head to in-grease lus beauty; see how 
many times he's actually forced to say "my darling," when he don't 
mean it: see the new clothes he has to wear out when he ain't 
in the house; see the terrible amount of duels he has to fight 
with tailors and shoemakers—why, it's enough to dissect him. 
See the chances he takes at boarding-houses on the you-rope4n, 
plan; see the dyspepsia dumplings he has to devour, with lots 
if old ledgers for stuffing. 
Then watch him benzine it from 
his youth up, till he co-operates in the connubial bliss of a 
mat-
ter- a' -money. 
See the symptoms; sec him go to a 
ball; sees a 
blonde or a 
brunette, or olive—a 
fair creature who dazzles his 
optics—she waltzes, 'tis the redaway or haulaway. 
At last she 
comes in his way; and, as she dances, he and she glances; two 
glances make one look; he and she look—two looks make one 
sigh; he and she sigh—two sighs make one waltz; he and she 
waltz—two waltzes make one -palpitation; he and she pal-
pitate—two palpitates make one call; 
he and she call (for 
cream)—two calls make one attention (and four dollars and a 
half); two attentions make one fool—sometimes two; two MIS 
make one flirtation ; two flirtations make two bouquets; two 
bouquets make one engagement; one engagement makes one 
marriage, one marriage makes— 
M.—What? 
B.—One marriage makes— (Bus) 
M.—Well, sir? 
B.—Makes a 
heap of trouble around the house!

WHAT I 
KNOW ABOUT FARMING. 
Burlesque Oration by En. HARRIGAN. 
Co-laborers and tillers of the soil—we meet and I 
trust, 
not the Tribune, but you lend your ears (and three or four dol-
lars) to the cause of farming. (Bus) 
A farm, my friends, is composed of mud or dirt, and is called 
by some eminent philosophers, land. 
I 
suppose they have sub-
stantial grounds for their lay-out. (
Bus) 
Farming was introduced first in a 
town called Eden. 
It's not 
down on the map, and never was interviewed. 
The farmer's 
name was Adam; he had one wife, Eva. 
Adam never was 
Aformonized, and, they do say lie raised the largest pippins and 
rusty-coat apples in that district. 
Adam didn't succeed well at 
farming, simply because he pulled the apples before they were 
ripe. 
It was on that farm we got the first pair, but the farms of 
Long Branch and Saratoga can raise more Belle Pairs than 
Adam did. (I 
thought I'd ring the Belle in once, as I'm mighty 
fond of 'ern.) 
Now, my friends, let us wade into beans—a 
soup-a-fluous fruit. 
The bean was first introduced by the Pilgrim Fathers, who 
brought a 
ship load over with 'em, and while the ship lay at 
‘6 
anchor, she sprung a 
leak, and the beans wouldn't mingle with 
a 
leek. 
They skedaddled in the water, where they formed a 
club or a 
rock, and every bean on ' ern was a 
brick. 
(Aside— 
Page 44, New York Riots.) 
Well, the Pilgrims landed in the 
morning on beans, and called them Plymouth Rock— I've 0(_‘ati 
there. 
The bean factories of Massachusetts have done a 
flour-
ishing business since that day—that is, if we take the word of 
Bean-jamin F., of Lowell. (Bus) 
The next thing we have before us is the potato, called in 
Latin, Hui:1)hp or Fogarty°, where we get the Greek of the 
Latin and Irish translation, thus :—Fo, Fogo, Fogardus, and 
Fogarty! 
If you don't believe it, go ask Fogarty ; he keeps 
the little saloon around the corner. 
It is a 
substantial fruit, 
and it came from Cork, an Irish town in Italy, where it was 
devoured with great eclat by the cannibals of that place. 
It is 
highly recommended for corns and bunnions. 
It will produce 
a 
bunnion ou your nasal organ when thrown with the gentlest 
force. (
Bus) 
Now let us take Salary; there is no family should be with-
out it—not even the Dent family. 
During a 
conversation with 
General Grant, he informed me confidentially that his relations 
kept eating salary, while he kept saying, " Lettuce have peas.' 
You take a 
bundle of Salary, and you will observe it covered 
with a 
green back and tied up with Bonds. It's generally taken 
by senators and politicians as a 
relish. 
I 
must say I 
like it 
myself. (Bus) 
The next fruit we demonstrate is the Beet. 
Beets . were first 
found and planted by our government. They stand any amount 
of wear and tear. 
They have to be beat to make, 'em fit to I 
swallow. 
They are an idle fruit, and hard to get rid of; they lay 
on your hands a 
long time. There are different classes of beets 
there is the full round plump beet, the spruce spicy beet, the 
turned-up beet, and the hotel beet, which are served up at 
hotels. 
The principal beet is the dead beet; they weigh from 
one hundred to four hundred pounds, and the market is gener-
ally overrun with 'ern. 
I 
admit I've been taken in on beets; 
but I 
have had many a 
beet taken in to get even. (Bus) 
eigke.1.-
27 
The next thing before us is the Onion. " In Onion there is 
Strength." 
The onion was first discovered at Lexington, and 
it has grown in size and strength since that day. 
It has made 
us shed tears many a 
day. 
But still we love our onion. 
its 
breath is strong and sweet, and covers up a 
great deal of ground. 
They tried hard to dig the onions up in the southern country, 
but its root was so strong it wouldn't be dug. 
It's a 
fruit that 
will stand a 
heap of preserving—yes, a 
heap-- a 
heop of pre-
serving. 
So I 
ask you. one and all to go farming. Some of you 
might say, 
what on?" I 
answer, on anything. 
If you liaxe 
to sell your false teeth, your wife's false hair, your shoes—buy 
a 
farm. 
Git West! 
Go w 
ay out West! 
Go where the 
Rocky Mountains, with their snow-capped pinnacles of mighty 
elevated dizziness, looks down with supreme disgust on the 
herds of buffalo that bellow on the Western prairie. 
I've heard 
'em 
se's Alexis. 'Yes, let the young and old, and old and 
young, git West! 
You'll git a 
farm for twenty-two dollars arid 
a 
half, close figures. 
Oh, my friends, think of the beauties of farming! 
In the 
balmy Indian Summer, you can set by your wigwam, like 
Minnehaha, the Indian basket- maker's daughter, and sew quilts. 
And, amid the dark and languishing smoke of a 
Henry Clay 
pipe, you kiss your wife and babe, and haste to the village, and 
get drunk on pressed cider, (only five cents a 
pail.) 
And, if 
you ain't married, whar can you get a 
wife like a 
farmer's off-
spring ? She milks the cows, she feeds the pigs, she eats seven 
• 
times it day. 
Whar can you get such another appetite? 
I 
repeat with increased vehemence, git West! Go plough, mow, 
reap, and sew—your own clothes.

SUSAN.—I

Two o'clock, and my hus-

dear, why did I 
marry? (Sings.) 
Air—" Wait till the Xoonlight." 
Why did I 
marry is what I 
often wonder, 
When I 
was so happy in my single life; 
I 
really do believe I 
made a 
stupid blunder, 
When I 
did consent to become his wife. 
But he coaxed and teased me. 
And his adoration pleased me. 
And he swore that he would kill himself 
Unless I 
did him wed. 
So I 
finally consented, 
But have bitterly repented, 
And I 
feel so very miserable 
I 
wish that I 
was dead. 
CHORUS. 
So, ladies, take warning, and never think of mar-
rying 
A man who belongs to a 
secret lodge, 
For late hours he will keep, 
And rob you of your sleep, 
And think that he is playing 
A very cunning dodge. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, a 
very cunning dodge, indeed. 
Keeping their 
wives up till two or three in the morning. 
And if you say a 
word about it, they'll coolly reply, " Well, why didn't you go to 
bed ?" 
But I 
have thought of a 
plan that, I 
think, will keep 
my husband at home in future. 
I 
will write a 
letter as if from 
a 
gentleman, to me, asking my acquaintance, etc. 
That will 
make him jealous, and he will remain at home to watch. 
(Sits down at table, writes, and reads aloud)— 
" 
Dear Susan—Excuse me for being so presumptions as to 
call you ' Dear Susan,' but I 
have long admired you, and pitied 
your sad fate—left alone night after night, while your husband 
is out enjoying himself. 
He is unworthy the affection you 
bestow upon him, as he plainly shows by his neglect and ab-
sence from you. 
If you will only permit me to call and en-
deavor to cheer your solitude, you will bestow inexpressible 
happiness upon your devoted admirer."--
Let me see what name to sign— Oh. yes, " John Brown." I 
will leave it on the table, where he will be sure to find it, (
sings) 
Air—"Letter in the Candle." 
There's a 
letter on the table, 
Which I 
think will work a 
cure, 
For, although he is not jealous. 
will hurt his feelings sure. 
For he'll see how very careless 
Anti neglectful he has been, 
And I 
think he'll truly promise, 
Never to offend again. 
SPoKEN.—Hark! I 
think I 
hear his voice. 
(Singing outside. 
Mr. George Walker, a 
little tipsy, sings chorus through, entering on 
last Pine—" For Pm a 
meinher of the Rollicking Rams.")

SPOKEN.—Ilello, my dear, not gone to bed yet? 
SUSAN.—No sir; I 
waited to see what time you would come 
home. 
And now, sir, where have have you been? 
GEORGE—Where have I 
been? 
Why, as the old song goes, 
rye been— (Sings) 
Air—" Monkey's Wedding." 
Up the outside down the middle, 
To the music of a 
fiddle, 
How I 
did it was a 
riddle, 
For I 
was awful blue. 
SUSAN —Am I 
to understand that you have been to 
and without me? 
GEonGE.—No, my dear, I 
was only jokin 
by very important business at the lodg 
SUSAN.—The lodge, indeed!

GEORGE.—It's a 
fact, my dear; The truth of the matter is, 
the goat fractured one of his horns while initiating the last can-
didate, and I 
remained to assist in setting it. 
(
Aside.) 
And I 
think I 
got a 
few horns too many. 
SUSAN. (
sneeringly)—Now, I 
presume, you think you have 
said something very witty. 
But, I 
can tell you, I 
shall not 
stand this sort of treatment any longer. 
What would mama 
say if she knew all ? 
(Sings) 
Air—" What would Mama Say? 
Oh, George, ain't you ashamed? 
What would mama say, 
What would mama say, 
She'd call me foolish if I 
remained, 
And let you treat me treat me so. 
(George sings) 
Air—" I 
Want to go Home to :llama." 
Then why don't you go home to your ma? 
Likewise your respectable pa; 
If I'm such a 
brute, why, you'd better scoot, 
And trot along home to your ma,

Air—" He's Gone to Join the Army." 
I'll leave you in the morning, 
Though you don't care of course, 
Ill take the train for Chicago. 
And sue for a 
divorce; 
And, when I'm gone away, 
You'll be quite happy, then. 
For you can rest assured that I 
Will never return again. 
(Repeat the last two lines.)

(George sings) 
Air—" Hildebrand Montrose." 
Ta-ta, ta-ta, my darling wife. 
You've made me very happy, 
You have, upon my life; 
No more your " curtain lectures " 
Shall torture my poor brain, 
For I 
shall be that happy elf — 
A 
single man again. 
SUSAN (
speaks)—George Walker, you are a 
brute. I 
did think 
you loved me, but now I 
am convinced you do not care a 
fig for 
me. 
But, thank goodness, there are sonic people in the world 
who appreciate my worth, as I 
think that letter will convince 
you 
GEORGE (
takes Wier, reads it aloud)---aside—Her own hand-
writing. 
I 
see it's a 
put up job to try and make me jealous. 
(Aloud) Well, my dear, this is a 
very nice affair, but a 
little bit 
too thin. 
(Sings) 
32 
Air—" John Brown's Body." 
John Brown's letter is a 
little too thin, 
For I 
am not so stupid or so easy taken in; 
So do not be so foolish as to try it on again, 
For at plotting you're not at home. 
SUSAN (
sings) 
Well, the truth I 
won't deny, 
I 
did it just to try 
To make you jealous— 
(Aside)-0h, dear, I 
feel as if I'd like to cry. 
GEORGE (
sings) 
But you see it wouldn't do, 
For I 
know a 
thing or two, 
And I 
never could be jealous of one. 
I 
love as dearly as you. 
SUSAN (
Rpeaking)—Do you really mean that, George? 
GEORGE.—Of course I 
do, my dear; so now let its cease this 
bickering, and see if we can't live harmoniously together. 
SCSAN.—But you won't go to the lodge ? 
GEORGE.—No—that is, I'll only go once a 
month, and then I 
will endeavor to return in good season. 
SUSAN.—Then you shall have no cause to dread what you 
call our family jars. 
SusAx (
sings) 
Air—" Genevieve." 
For when you do return at eve, 
I'll never meet you with a 
frown; 
No bitter words shall you receive, 
For I 
will keep my temper down. 
GEORGE (
sings) 
And I, my dear, will strive to be, 
As gentle as my loving wife; 
So all the world shall envy me, 
My happy cheerful wedded life. 
(Both sing) 
Air—" Silver Threads Among the 
Gold. 
And now, kind friends, our troubles through, 
And we must bid you all adieu. 
GlioRfiE (
sings) 
But, in what's occurred to me, 
I 
trust a 
lesson you will see. 
Gents don't tarry from your home, 
And leave your loving wives alone. 
SUSAN (
sings) 
And wives, whate'er your trouble be, 
Don't raise the demon, jealousy. 
(Both sing) 
For when you both are growing old, 
And silver threads are ' rnong the gold; 
Then what happiness ' twill be, 
To know through life you did agree.

SPEECH. 
By N ED H ARRIGAN. 
I 
have been requested by the members of the Academy of 
Design, the Humane Society, and members of the Board of 
Health, to elucidate, to compound, and thoroughly sift the most 
mome-quous questions of the hour. 
There has been a 
stereo-
typed impression perambulating and meandering the rounds of 
the backward numbers of the various country newspapers, 
wondering and exciting the populace as to which, what and 
who I 
am ; 
and I 
to- night stand here to uphold the national 
integrity of my individuality. 
Yes, I 
am here to point out to 
you the snags, the bars, the slates against which we are drift-
ing; 
drifting, drift, but whither are we drifting? 
Hold on, 
don't speak, you don't know. I 
am paid for enlightening you, 
and I 
will lighten you of all earthly possessions, such as board 
bills, bank bills and other auxiliaries, too numerous to articulate. 
(Bus.) 
As I 
ponder in my reveries strange fancies, wild hallu-
cinations, night mares and circus horses hold high carnival in 
my brain casket. 
Do not say its drink, for on my honor, as a 
gentleman, I 
defy my most intimate acquaintances to affirm 
that I 
ever refused an opportunity to drink when invited. That 
brings before me the subject of etiquette; and what is etiquette ? 
Simply a 
boarding house, no napkin, no hash, and one tooth-
pick. 
And can you conscientiously ask whither are we drift-
ing? A limited few will remember reading in the Scriptures 
the prodigy of the parable son, where we find the son revolts 
against his pa, the pa against hi i 
son; hence the revolution of 
1776. 
At that time. B. 1
0. 
C., before the fire in Chicago, corn 
had gone up to 40 cents. 
Erie had fell. 
There was a 
strong 
minded movement going on among the fair sex, in this wise: 
A caravan of camels had crossed the desert of Sarah, and they 
made things lump; they eat all the corn and left the husks 
hence the husky voice of the speaker. 
But still Jane Maria 
and Victoria Wood-hull the corn ever since. But I 
ask you what 
did the boy do? He stood on the burning deck—no, burning 
r) 
sand, and eat raw sandwiches 'Twas then for the first time 
we heard that beautiful ballad, " Out in the Cold -World, Out 
in the Streets." 
So I 
ask you what was the boy's father when 
he turned him from the door? 
He was a 
cannibal, he was 
cruel, he was an iceberg, and Bergh ought to take him for his 
cruelty. 
But we drift. 
I 
would ask you, what is cruelty? 
It 
is a 
solution of drugs taken from the various lunch counters in 
the different parts of the world. 
It is the inhaling tube from 
which children derive their gruel nature. 
The first case of 
brute cruelty was a 
certain Mr. Bailim, who owned a 
mule. 
lie 
took him to a 
well to water him, a 
fly alighted on the mule's 
narrative; the mule said shoo fly, the fly didn't shoo; the mule 
kicked, and Mr. Bailim went in the well before he could send 
for Greely to bail him out; hence the antagonistic disposition 
of boys and girls at the present day. 
Oh, yes, my confused 
hearers, when you lay on your couch at night studying Hoyle, 
you are awakened by sweet sounds of music, borne softly, not 
harshly, on the midnight air. 
You spring from your couch, and 
spring into your overalls—no, dollar vardens, from the dollar 
store, out into the Kreet, over fence, -housetop, and sty away 
goes the pursued, pursued by the pursuer; but you do not over-
take the enemy. 
They return with an army of cats, Thomas's, 
Williams and Mariars. 
Your bootjack, your washstand, your 
bureau, your ammunition is gone; you are a 
prisoner, you can-
not toe the scratch. 
Wherein hangs the claws of cruelty. 
But 
we drift. 
My friends, I 
have here a 
board, not the Board of 
Health, but simply a 
blackboard. (
Bus.) 
If there is any gentle-
men present that would like to transfer their debts from the 
blackboards in the different saloons around town to mine, they 
can do so, without offending the proprietor. 
(
Bus.) 
Now we 
are all aboard. 
This small substance I 
hold in my hand is 
called chalk. 
It is good for the heartburn, and is used princi-
pally by men of mark—Mark Twain, Markquis McCoole. 
It's 
quoted middlings in the market. 
I 
would also remark that 
chalk is chalk full of alkali, so am I; and its billiard propen-
sities gives it a 
billions apperranee; hence the cue-riosity of it. 
But we drift, (Bus.) 
Now we strike temperance. (
Bus.) 
It's 
harder than a 
divorce. (Bus one moment.) 
The picture that I 
have drawn for you is one of those scenes which we have all 
seen and felt; 
you will observe the giant proportions of the 
subject. 
You will observe the hogshead which has never been 
tapped; you will follow my finger slowly, and we strike the 
guitar or bugle. 
In the spring the roses bloom on the hedge of 
it. 
That is the first sign of the drunkard's doom. 
That is the 
first picture of the series of Temperance. 
Oh, how is it; how 
is it that men will drink. The next picture of the series of Tem-
perance is a 
serious one; one moment. (Bus.) 
There's where 
he performs Rummeo in Jolliyet. 
There's where he is in the 
degraded state, New Jersey. 
An outcast, cast out of the back 
door of some saloon, to have boys cast east iron at him, simply 
because he is shabby genteel, and an old castihon. 
He's never 
had no daddy to push him along in the world, but a 
policeman. 
Where will he be in a 
few moments? 
In a 
felon's cell, on hem-
lock boards, and hem locked up, and he whiskey he was out of 
it; and yet, and yet men will drink. (Bus.) 
Ladies and gen-
tlemen, excuse these tears; you will prepare yourselves with 
handkerchiefs for the flood, for the last picture of the series is 
a 
thin one. 
Oh, it's too thin, too thin. 
(Bus.) 
One moment. 
There's where he weakens; there's where we drift. 
You will 
observe the only relic his pa and ma could recognize is his 
guitar. 
There's where he is Barnumed, Barnumed and bared 
out, bared down with grief and Monongahela, he is what is 
called in the dictionary a 
snooze.

American Fortune- Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We hreie 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numh:rs 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions hare 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too di& 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
.the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
aecessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
