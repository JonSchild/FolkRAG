Two telegraph lads are Bobby and I, 
(Telegraph) 
We look rather quisby, but oh! ain't we tly; 
(Telegraph) 
For singing and dancing we've gained great renown,-
(( Telegraph) 
We're always quite happy with never a 
frown. 
(Telegraph) 
'When drowsy folks are sleeping 
We're up at the break of day; 
Dispatches we're delivering 
From friends that's far away. 
CHORUS. 
Jolly, happy, merry, natty, 
As the hours go by, 
You'll seldom find two telegraph lads 
More happier than Bobby and I. 
(Dance) 
No telegraph lads as clever you'll find, (Telegraph) 
At a 
song or a 
frolic we're never behind, 
(Telegraph) 
Now while we are dere a 
few steps we'll show, 
(Telegraph) 
Though telegraph lads you'll find were not slow. 
(Telegraph) 
Though far and wide we wander, 
We hope for joy and glee, 
And trust your smiling faces 
Some other time to see. 
Jolly, happy, merry, etc.

Kathleen, my darling, though we're far apart, 
Still fresh is my memory it seems, 
That when you were leaving your once happy home 
Our parting was just like a 
dream. 
How can I 
forget you, my heart has gone with you, 
From your old home by the sea; 
Still I 
am waiting, watching and praying, 
For some one to bring Kathleen back to me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Kathleen, my darling, for you I 
am waiting. 
Sure if it is only your sweet face to see, 
Though sad was our parting still I 
am praying, 
For some one to bring Kathleen back to me. 
God bless you, my darling, were the last words I 
spoke, 
As the ship it was leaving the Bay, 
You promised me then you'd return home again 
Only one year from to-day. 
So last night, my darling, of you I 
was dreaming, 
And my poor heart was free from all pain; 
For I 
saw in my dream a 
ship in the stream 
Bringing sweet Kathleen back home again.

I 
went one day out to the park 
In the merry month of June, 
A pleasant time I 
thought to find 
And spend an afternoon. 
'Twas there I 
met a 
pretty girl— 
A 
lovely little miss,

raised my hat, she turned her back, 
And to me answered this: 
CHORUS. 
There you are, there you are, 
You naughty young man, you're going too far,) 
I 
have no time, so must decline 
To flirt with you, please bear in mind. 
I 
told her that she need not fear, 
As I 
meant her no harm, 
She didn't object when I 
asked to accept 
The offer of my arm. 
We then strolled round the shady walks, 
And I 
whispered, 
While's none nigh, 
One little kiss, please give me this," 
Instead she did reply:

There you are, etc.

I 
NEVER GIVE NOTHING AWAY. 
Words and Music by }Imlay S. M ILLEn. of Phi'adelphia, and sung 
with immense success by LEONARD St: JONES, 
I'm a man that has traveled around in my time, 
Some curious sights I 
have seen, 
And queer remarks I've heard people make, 
Quite clever to me some did seem. 
It would take a 
long time to tell you all 
What I've seen and heard people say, 
But I'm one of the kind you don't often find, 
For I 
never give nothing away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
never give nothing away— 
No, nothing, I've heard others say, 
I'm a 
man of my word and I 
have heard 
I 
don't go and give it away. 
There's Mr. De Booth, a 
cashier in a 
bank, 
A 
position he's held many a 
year, 
And lives in great style up the avenue away, 
Though I've heard he's a 
little bit queer. 
Each day he drives out in his new double team 
That cost more than two years of his pay; 
Though I'll not say a 
word ' bout what I 
have heard, 
For I 
never give nothing away. 
There's a 
pretty young girl ' tends a 
store o'er the way 
Who I've seen once and awhile, 
And met in the park with a 
gentleman friend, 
Dressed in the latest of style. 
Now I've heard many say they don't understand 
How she dresses herself up so gay; 
If you I 
should tell you'd know very well, 
But I 
never give nothing away. 
Now Mrs. Kelly's daughter quite a 
delicate girl, 
Has improved very much here of late; 
And the neighbors all say she's the picture of health 
And gaining each day in weight. 
Though she's married, she says, to a 
wealthy young 
man 
She met on a 
car one day, 
Now I 
could very well quite another tale tell, 
But I 
never give nothing a 
way. 
A LITTLE FADED ROSEBUD IN OUR BIBLE.

LEONARD of LEONARD 3: JONES. 
Copyright secured, 1881. 
'Tis a 
little faded rosebud in our Bible, 
A memory and, to us, it's ever dear, 
'Twas placed there by our loving angel mother, 
And has remained as placed so many years. 
Our token is a 
little faded roseind— 
A rosebud that we've long since laid away; 
We miss it ever fondly in our old home— 
A rosebud that has long went to decay. 
CHORUS. 
A rosebud—a 
rosebud in our Bible, 
Only a 
rosebud that's decayed, 
Though its ever-loving sweet remembrance 
Will bring back the happy years that's passed away 
The scattered leaves that lay within our Bible 
Are fresh within our memory as the day, 
When mother pluched this blushing little rosebud 
That now lays in our Bible all decayed. 
Though we've laid away our precious darling— 
No more we'll see the one we dearly love, 
For we know she's gone to join the angels 
In that happy home so far above.

ater, Hew York. 
How happy is the evening 
When the moon o'er the hilltops peeps, 
And the dew is softly falling 
To lull the flowers to sleep. 
It's then my menery's stealing 
Back to a 
happy scene, 
Of one I 
never will forget--
Is my pretty little Irish queen. 
Chtoitus. 
Oh, my pretty little Irish. queen, 
Whoever happy seems, 
With golden hair and eyes so fair, 
This pretty little Irish queen. 
Oh, my pretty little Irish queen, 
The fairest ever seen, 
It's hard to part from the darling of my heart, 
My pretty little Irish queen. 
(Dance) 
Her eyes are like the dewdrops 
That glitter on the rose so bright; 
And teeth just like the lilies, 
Which bloom so fair and white. 
When the shades of night have fallen 
Her face then haunts my dream, 
But there's a 
day when 11,1 
return 
And claim my Irish queen.

ARE YOU GOING PAR? ONLY TO THE CAR. 
Copyright Secured 1:.-1,„ 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR. 
Strolling out the other evening, 
Such a 
fairy girl I 
met, 
Eyes so bright with love-light gleaming, 
Her first glance I'll ne'er forget. 
Softly I 
addressed the maiden— 
In her face my fate I 
read— 
" 
Tell me, sweet one, whe're you're going," 
•` Just to meet my pa," she said. 
CHORUS. 
"Are you going far?" " Not too far, 
Only to the car just to see pa, tate..." 
In a 
pleasant way we chatted, 
I 
asked leave to call next day, 
She of course felt highly flattered 
To be courted in that way. 
To her ma she introduced me, 
Then my way was smooth and clear, 
There was nothing she refused me, 
When I 
whispered in her ear. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, she was very obliging; she was 
kindness itself; she would do almost anything for 
me. 
Why, one day, as we were passing Dehnonico's, 
I 
asked her to come in, and, do you know, she con-
sented without a 
murmur. 
Her mother, too, is a 
real 
nice old lady. 
Whenever Blanche and I 
are going 
out for a 
walk, she will say— 
Are you going far, etc. 
But one day we met her father, 
Then there was an awful row; 
Was he angry? Well, yes, rather, 
Such a 
frown upon his brow; 
" 
Who are you, sir, with my daughter?" 
'Twas a 
voice like thunder's roar. 
" 
Dm't you know me, sir? You'd ought to, 
I'm a 
swell called Theodore." 
SPOKEN. — It was quite a task to make an impres-
sion on the old gentleman, but I 
finally succeeded in 
convincing him that it was perfectly right and proper 
for Blanche and I 
to say to one another— 
Are you going far, etc.

LITTLE ROSES, DON'T YOU TELL. 
Words and Music by HARRY S. 
M ILEIER of Philadelphia, and sung by 
Mr. P. 
BRADLEY. 
While strolling through the garden, 
Where roses bloom so fair, 
With one who was more charming 
Than all the roses there; 
And we sat beneath the ivys 
And where honeysuckles dwell; 
Now if you heard one whispered word, 
Little roses, don't you tell. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little roses, don't you tell, 
Violets, lilies, nor bluebell, 
Where we strayed or what we said, 
Pretty little roses, don't you tell. 
The moon was softly gleaming 
Through the trees and ivy; 
I 
could not think of leaving 
The one that sat beside me. 
The air was sweetly laden 
With the perfume of that flowery dell, 
So if you heard one whispered word, 
Little roses, don't you tell. 
Pretty little roses, etc. 
The moon had long since risen, 
Still I 
could not leave, 
While the roses seemed to listen, 
We're nodding in the breeze. 
I 
said as we stood by the garden gate, 
One kiss and then farewell, 
And what was said in the moonlight shade, 
Little roses, don't you tell. 
Pretty little roses, etc.

DOING THE ELEGANT. 
Words and Music by HARRY S. 
M ILLER of Philsdr.Iplijao 
Pm fond of viewing pictures 
And go most every day 
Out to the Park and Art Gallery 
To pass the time away. 
The prettiest pictures in the Art 
Are the darling girls you see, 
And you care nothing for the paintings, 
But would really like to be— 
CHORU6. 
Doing the elegant, 
There is nothing half so grand, 
As to promenade with a 
pretty maid 
And a 
catalogue in your hand, 
You try to explain the paintings, 
Which you really know you can't, 
And you little care for the pictures there 
When doing the elegant. 
One day while at the Gallery 
I 
met a 
darling fair, 
She really was the masterpiece 
Of all the pictures there. 
I 
said as I 
approached her, 
" 
My forwardness please excuse," 
41 Oh, certainly, sir," she softly said, 
"No apology you need use." 
Doing the elegant, ete. 
Now I 
own I 
love this darling 
From the first time that we met, 
'Twas among the arts and paintings, 
The place

'Twas there I

That will make us both one, 
And the fellahs say I'm a

And that it all came from—

OUR PATRICK IS AN ACTOR. 
Written expressly for LEONARD & JONES, by FRANK DrawNT. 
.We've raised a 
dozen childrem—proud of them am I— 
Some of them are influential and hold positions high; 
And I

They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride. 
There's Barney, Dan and Jerry, with Larry, Ted and 
Mike, 
All elegant and scholars—you never saw the like; 
But the worst of all is Patrick; the facts are, as you 
see, 
He's traveling with a 
circus an actor man to be. 
CHORT'S. 
Patrick is an actor, and wears the finest clothes; 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes, 
With a 
diamond on his shirt-front--a lump the big 
of that; 
'Tis folly to deny it-La dandy is our Pat.

When he's home upon a 
visit, neighbors far and near 
Will send him invitations to have cigars and beer. 
'When I 
cook corn-beef and cabbage to make a 
lovely 
meal 
Patrick doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel; 
But he'll eat ice cream an' peaches, blanc mange and 
custard pie; 
It's the style he learned from actors; they're always 
living high. 
But in spite of all his manners a 
word for him we'll 
speak: 
He don't forget his parents with money every Week.

Our wives work the garden, in the market have a

While we go out parading through the land.

We crawl through the sewers just to keep them

Oh, we lay for the cattle and drive them to the pond, 
And steal all the bull-dogs when we can; 
If your neighbor's yard is dirty, sure we'll tell you 
what to do, 
Just send for John and James O'Hoolahan. 
We're two Micks, etc.

But if I

• 
Every morn of the week first before I 
depart, 
My children they flock around me, 
Then I 
will think of the workingmen killed, 
Oh God! what a 
loss it must be; 
When father is dead their trouble sets in, 
To beg is poor mother's best plan, 
How hard death must come, when your family is young 
Are the thoughts of a 
poor workingman, 
how hard death must come, when your family is young 
Are the thoughts of a 
poor workingman. 
On Saturday night with the money I've earned, 
I 
pay all my debts of the week, 
When a 
trifle's laid by for to pay the month's rent, 
find re's nothing to keep. 
Still I 
don't complain, there's poorer than me, 
I'll see to their wants while I 
can, 
But if I 
was dead would my family be fed, 
Are the thoughts of a 
poor workingman, 
But if I 
was dead would my faintly be fed, 
Are the thoughts of a

We 
sat on the bench 'neath the old elm tree 
One evening in years long since fled; 
I 
remember it well, of it lovingly tell— 
The linnet sweetly sang overhead. 
Your merry brown eyes outshone the stars in the 
skies, 
Our hearts were throbbing with glee, 
While my arm did entwine, you said you'd be mine, 
As we sat on the bench ' neath the old elm tree. 
Cnortus. 
Your merry brown eyes outshone the stars in the 
skies, 
Our hearts were throbbing with glee, 
While my arm did entwine, you said you'd be mine, 
As we sat on the bench 'neath the old elm tree. 
When you'd promise to meet me, with your sunny 
smile greet me, 
I'd haste at the close of the day, 
Where the roses did bloom shed their balmy per-
fume, 
And the robin sang merry and gay. 
When dewdrops were falling, the whippowil 
And tiro daisies seem to smile on the lea, 
While the stars shone above we would whisper our 
love, 
As we sat on the bench 'neath the old elm tree. 
Your merry, etc. 
But those days now are o'er, we will see them no 
more, 
Yet in memory still do they gleam; 
And often I 
find they will flit through my mind 
Like the vision of some happy dream. 
Your silvery locks now were like jet on your brow, 
Yet you still are as dear unto me 
.As that evening you said that me you would wed, 
As we sat on the bench 'neath the old elm tree. 
Your merry, etc.

BOYS, LEAVE DRINK ALONE. 
As sung by CHARLES DIAMOND, 
Motto songs of every kind, 
Have through the world been sung; 
But I have one, the truest Own, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I will unfurl, 
A sad one you will one; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
CHORUS. 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I 
give. 
Once I was a happy man, 
And had a loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can 
If you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
Now those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
Boys, leave drink, etc. 
This is a 
tale I know that's true, 
As hi the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
When I 
tell you, you will start; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
Is from this broken heart. 
Boys, leave drink, etc.

ARTHUR M'COY. 
While the snow- flakes of winter are falling 
On mountain, and house-top and tree, 
Come, olden weird voices, recalling 
The homes of Hy-Faly to me. 
The ramble by river and wild wood, 
The legends of mountain and glen, 
When the bright magic mirror of childhood 
Made heroes and giants of men. 
• 
Then I 
had my dreamings ideal, 
My prophets and heroes sublime, 
Yet I 
found one, true, living and real, 
Surpass all the fictions of time; 
Whose voice thrilled my heart to its center, 
Whose form 'tranced my soul and my eye, 
A temple no treason could enter, 
My hero was Arthur M'Coy. 
For Arthur M'Coy was no bragger, 
No bibber, no blustering clown, 
'Fore the club of an ale- house to swagger, 
Or drag his coat-tail through the town; 
But a 
veteran stern and steady, 
Who felt for the land and her ills; 
In the hour of her need ever ready, 
To shoulder a 
pike for the hills. 
As the strong mountain tower spreads its arms, 
Dark, shadowy, silent and tall, 
In our tithe- raids and midnight alarms,. 
His bosom gave refuge to all! 
If a 
mind clear, and calm, and expanded, 
A soul ever soaring arid high, 
'Mid a 
host—gave a 
right to command it— 
A hero was Arthur M'Coy. 
Whilst he knelt, with a 
Christian demeanor, 
To his priest, or his Maker, alone, 
He scorned the vile slave or retainer, 
That crouched round the castle or throne. 
The Tudor, the Guelph, the Pretender, 
Were tyrants, alike, branch and stem; 
But who'd free our fair land, and defend her, 
A 
nation, were monarchs to him, 
ARTHUR WOOL 
(Concluded.) 
And this faith in good works he attested, 
When Tone linked the true hearts and brave, 
Every billow of danger he breasted— 
His sword-flash, the crest of its wave; 
A standard he captured in Gorey; 
A 
sword-cut and ball through the thigh, 
Were among the mementoes of glory 
Recorded of Arthur M'Coy. 
Long the guest of the law and its beagles, 
His covert the cave and the tree; 
Though his home was the home of the eagles; 
His soul was the soul of the free. 
No toil, no defeat could enslave it, 
Nor franchise, nor " Amnesty Bill"— 
No lord, but the Maker who give it, 
Could curb the strong pride of his will. 
With the gloom of that ever laden— 
Seldom seen at the hurling or dance, 
Where, through blushes, the eye of the maiden 
Looks out for her lover's advance; 
And whenever he stood to behold it, 
A 
curl of the lip or a 
sigh, 
Was the silent reproach that unfolded 
The feelings of Arthur M'Coy. 
For it told him of freedom o'ershaded— 
That the iron had entered their veins— 
When beauty bears manhood degraded, 
And manhood's contented in chains. 
Yet he loved that fair race as a 
martyr, 
His bosom had bled for them all. 
And he died for his love—I 
remember, 
On a 
mound by the Shannon's blue wave, 
On a'dark snowy eve of December, 
I 
knelt at the patriot's grave. 
The aged were all heavy-hearted— 
No cheek in the grave-yard was dry: 
%he sun of our hills had departed— 
God rest you, old Arthur M'Coy.

BESSIE LEE. 
Written expressly for CHARLES DIAMOND. 
We will meet to-night, my darling, 
My own bonnie Bessie Lee, 
Where the cooling zephyrs wander 
From the ever restless sea; 
Yes, my own, my bonnie Bessie, 
On the wave-washed bank we'll be, 
And again my lips will whisper, 
"I am still the same to thee." 
CHORUS. 
We'll meet to-night, my darling, 
My own sweet Bessie Lee, 
And again will we be straying 
Down by the restless sea. 
When the moonbeams pale the shadows, 
And the twilight fades away, 
I 
will wander toward thy cottage 
In this blissful hour of day; 
Then I'll come to greet you, Bessie, 
In this happy wooing time, 
And I 
then shall ask you, darling, 
" 
Will you promise to be mine?" 
We'll meet to-night, etc. 
So when the waves keep rolling 
Past thy little cottage door, 
We'll wander, Bessie darling, 
On the sparkling, pebbly shore, 
With our hands and love united; 
You will name the happy day. 
When I'll take my darling Bessie 
To my own cot down the bay. 
We'll meet to-night, etc.

CASEY'S PARTY. 
Composed by Fftexa E. McNisn, and sung with great succeed by 
ROSE and JENNIE LELAND. 
We were down at Mrs. Casey's 
A week ago to-night; 
And we never saw such goin's on. 
Since first we siw the light; 
We arrived at the house quite early, 
So to see the fun begin; 
We were stopped at the door for the entrance-fee, 
Which we paid, and then went in. 
CHORUS. 
There was a 
fiddle and a 
banjo 
In a 
corner on the table, 
And P. J. Farrell called off the sets 
As loud as he was able; 
Murphy, he got noisy, 
And was hit by Bill McCarthy, 
'Twas then and there the war commenced 
At Mrs. Casey's party. 
O'Brien jumped upon the floor 
And challenged all the gang; 
When some one split the top of his lip 
With the corner of an oyster can; 
Clarkey tried to stop them 
And got fired through,the door; 
And with old crippled Callahan 
They fairly wiped the for. 
There was a

DON 'T CALL IN THE MORNING. 
Written, composed and sung by E. C. Di/20AR. 
Music published by E. II. HARDING, 2'29 Bowery, New York. 
'Twas at an evening party where I 
first met Milly Green, 
And thought she was the sweetest girl that I 
had ever seen; 
I 
sought an introduction which I 
happily did obtain, 
And in nearly all the dances I 
her little hand did gain. 
And when the time for breaking up the party did arrive, 
To see this little damsel home somehow I 
did contrive; 
But ere we parted at the door I 
boldly asked if I 
Might call and see her sometime when she gave me this reply. 
CHORUS. 
Don't come in the morning, for that will be too soon, 
And never call to see me iu the afternoon; 
Don't come in the evening and never call at night, 
But call at any other time and then you'll be all right. 
So strange an answer really I 
could not make out at all, 
Unless it was a 
gentle hint that I 
must never call; 
And yet I 
did not think she could treat me so unkind, 
For somehow she to favor me appeared to be inclined. 
So once again I 
asked her, but the answer was the same;-
And at that very moment to the door the servant came. 
Good-night, she said and vanished, did this darling little dear, 
And kept me standing with an answer ringing in my ear: 
Don't come in the morning, etc. 
I 
strolled along and wandered what the dickens could she mean 
As all night long I 
dreamt about-that darling little queen; 
Btu more her answer came to me, which seemed to be absurd; 
But in the morning when I 
woke a 
happy thought occurred. 
She said if I 
would call at any time I 
should be all right, 
Except the morning, afternoon, the evening or at night; 
Any time that T 
could call was neither late nor soon; 
Of course you all have guessed by now she never more will 
say: 
Don't come in the morning, etc.

There is a 
new discovery 
That's making a 
great noise; 
It's used by all the men, the girls, 
The ladies and the boys. 
It makes the siek folks well again, 
No longer they feel sad, 
And they all swear they'll always wear 
The Electric Liver Pad. 
CHORUS. 
This discovery is so great, 
It makes all people glad; 
And they holler, here's my half a 
dollar 
For an Electric Liver Pad. 
It draws like a 
circus team, 
In fact it draws so hard; 
It'll draw money from a 
bursted bank, 
And from a 
hog draws lard. 
From a 
bum's pocket it'll draw wealth, 
And pimples from his nose, 
And if wern before a 
clothing store, 
It'll draw you a 
suit of clothes. 
This discovery, etc. 
To the girls ft draws Leans, 
To the young fellows cash; 
And to the hungry folks it drama 
A 
good old plate of hash. 
If you're married and have war 
Keep quite as a

Put it on the jaw of your mother-in-law, 
And draw her from the house.

Oh, come, my darling, ' tis just the hour, 
When moonbeams dance o'er all the happy earth 
and sea; 
We, too, 
will dance, my dove, 
while starbeams 
gleam, my love, 
Oh, scorn not moments made for love and thee. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm-in-arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms, 
Here alone, secure from ev'ry harm; 
Not a 
care, free as air, 
Come, my love, and gaily dance around. 
Come, kiss me, darling—I 
know what love is: 
Two pretty little arms that round my neck en-
twine, 
Two ruby lips, my love, that warmly kiss, my love; 
Two pretty eyes of azure blue like thine. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm- in-arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your'song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms, 
Here alone, secure from ev'ry harm; 
Not a

Come, my love, and gaily dance around. 
FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE. 
W ritten and composed by SAX DEVEItg. 
Deception just now is the rule all around, 
It's practiced in all shades of life; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful, my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
_Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid; 
Be careful, look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is -made. 
In the good days of old, in our grandmothers' time, 
Girls didn't enamel or paint; 
Didn't wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didn't lace themselves up till they'd faint; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheeks didn't fade, 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didn't pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now it's combed on the back of a 
(
1hair. 
I've got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid, 
But before you get married examine them well* 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made,

THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 
Sung with great success by CHAS. DIAMOND. 
The terror-fraught legend concerning the " Flying 
Dutchman" runs thus: 
Vanderdecken is reported to have been a Dutch 
captain entrusted with the conveyance of the mails 
from Holland to the Dutch settlement at the Cape. 
In one of his voyages, when off Table Bay, he en-
countered a 
furious gale of wind, and for a 
long time 
was blown before it, during which all his attempts to 
enter the harbor were made in vain. 
His mate, an 
experienced seaman, endeavored to persuade him to 
give over his fruitless struggles with the elements, and 
is reported to have received from him the reply, that 
he would beat about until the Day of Judgment, 
which awful speech instantly brought upon him the 
punishment of Heaven. 
Consequently his doom. 
'Twas on a very stormy night, far southward of the 
Cape, 
When from a huge nor'wester we just made our 
escape; 
Like an infant in the cradle each breeze was hushed 
to sleep 
And peacefully we sailed along the bosom of the deep. 
(Repeat). 
At length the helmsman gave a 
shout of horror and 
of fear 
As If he'd just had gazed upon some sudden danger 
near; 
We looked around the ocean, and just upon our lee, 
We saw the Flying Dutchman come bounding o'er 
, 
the sea. 
(Repeat). 
thl 
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 
(Concluded.) 
Take in your flowing canvas, boys, our watchful 
master cried, 
To us and our ship's company great trouble does 
betide; 
The billows crested white with foam, all angry cloth 
appear, 
The wind springs up, a 
hurricane, for Vanderdecken's 
near. 
(Repeat). 
He comes, the Flying Dutchman, comes light o'er 
the loftly spray, 
Preceded by the tempest dire, he makes for Table 
Bay; 
With birdlike speed he booms across the wild and 
howling blast, 
But ere he can cast anchor there, the bay also is past. 
(Repeat). 
He speeds along too rapidly to mark his elagle flight, 
And lightning lit, the Dutchman's helm full soon is 
out of sight; 
The 
rews of ships far distant, now shudder at the 
breeze, 
That bears dread Vanderdecken in fury o'er the seas. 
(Repeat). 
Then mourn for the Flying Dutchman, for terrible 
his doom, 
The ocean round the stormy cape it is his living tomb; 
There Vanderdecken beats about, forever night and 
day, 
And tries in vain his oath to keep, by entering the 
bay. 
(Repeat.)

To an evening party once I 
went, 
I 
met such a 
nice young girl, 
Dressed oh, so fine and smothered in scent— 
My head soon felt in a 
whirl. 
I 
asked her if she'd dance with me, 
She gave a 
languishing smile; 
She wouldn't say no—she didn't say yes— 
She'd quite a 
peculiar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she would, and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smil'd and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh! my, you shouldn't, 
Oh! you naughty, naughty man! 
I 
sat down by the fair one's side, 
And handed her wine and cake; 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare 
For such a 
darling's sake. 
She hung her head and smiled and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss, 
And when we parted on that night 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
First she would, etc. 
I 
often met her'after that, 
And I'd take her here and there, 
And every time I 
got a 
chance, 
My passion I'd declare. 
I've vowed to be true as long as I'd live, 
That my love was as big as a 
bill; 
At last I 
said if she wouldn't wed, 
By jingo, myself l'd kill. 
First she would, etc.

Tim GARDEN WHERE THE PRATIES GROW. 
Written and sung by the great Irish Clown, JOHNNY PATrEssott. 
Have you ever been in love, boys, did you ever feel that pain? 
I'd rather be in jail, I 
would, than be in love again, 
Though the girl I 
loved was beautiful, I'd have you all to know 
That I

creature that nature did intend 
To walk straight through this world without the Grecian bend. 
Nor did she wear a 
chignon—I'd lia-ve you all to know 
That I 
met her in the garden where the praties grow. 
She was singing an ould Irish song, called " Gra gal machree," 
Oh, says I, what a 
wife she'd make for an Irish boy like me; 
I 
was on important business, but I 
did not like to go 
And leave the girl or the garden where the praties grow. 
She was just the sort, etc. 
Says I, " My lovely fair maid, I 
hope you'll pardon me;" 
But she v.-r.sn't like those city girls that would say, you're making 
free; 
She answered right modestly, and curtsied low, 
Saying, you're welcome to the garden where the praties grow. 
She was just the sort, etc. 
Says I, my lovely darling. rm tired of single life, 
And if you have no objections I'll make you my deg wife;

THE GIRL IN THE " JERSEY." 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
There's a 
new style of dress called the " Jersey," 
Which makes all the girls look so nice, 
The stuff is much finer than kersey, 
'Tis made to attract and entice; 
On each side there's a 
nice little pocket 
Where the darlings can keep their hands warm; 
They're worn by all ladies of fashion, 
As a 
part of the new Dress Reform. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the very latest thing in dress is 
the article called the ' Jersey." 
When Lauretta tip-
proaciLes her father now, she will not say, 
Pa, dear, 
I 
want a 
new sacque, or a 
cloak, or an ulster." 
Oh, 
no! NOw it is, " Pa, dear, I 
want a Jersey.' 
Why, 
the other day, I 
was completely fascinated, when I 
beheld for the first time strolling up Broadway, 
CHORUS. 
That beautiful girl in the " Jersey," 
That glorious girl in the " Jersey," 
So lovely and fair with her golden hair— 
That beautiful girl in the " Jersey." 
I've gazed upon girls of great beauty, 
The belles of the opera and ball, 
But to tell you, I 
think ' tis my duty, 
That mine is the sweetest of all. 
'Tis only of late I 
have known it; 
The charm is not all in her face, 
But comes from that new-fashioned " jersey,' 
She wears with such infinite grace. 
That beautiful girl, etc. 
Sarah Bernhardt has greatly excited 
The girls with her dresses, so grand; 
But what good are they when you're plighted 
To the one who has captured your hand? 
My advice is to dress in a " Jersey," 
And look with a 
bright roguish eye; 
You'll set all the young fellows crazy, 
And only for love will you sigh. 
SeOKEN. — Yes, I 
think all the ladies ought to wear 
'• Jerseys," they look so well, and by-and-bye you'll 
bear somebody singing about you as

Written and sung by JOIllas'Y Pensnsos. 
Oh! from Ennis to Limerick one thy 
With some neighboring boys I 
dii go, sirs, 
it was race time I 
heard people say, 
And a 
pleasanter time I 
don't know, sirs; 
They came down from Cork and kildare, 
From Kerry and sweet Tipperary, 
The Waterford boys they were there, 
And each heart was as light as a 'aim. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for a 
race or a 
fair, 
When the boys are all jolly and frisky; 
Sure you'll never see the blackguard dull ears, 
Where there's colleens and plenty of whiskey. 
In those days it was horses, not steam, 
That took you so neat and so cosy; 
By your side sat your own sweet colleen., 
And her cheeks they looked blooming and rosy; 
In the front sat the driver in state, 
With his whip flying away with the wind, sirs; 
And to save his poor htvses the weight, 
The gossoons he wou'Al knock down behind, sirs. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
On the course there were tents, boys, galore, 
There was dancing and plenty of singing; 
The piper were playing " Rory Olfore," 
While the bell for the start it was ringing. 
" 
They're off!" was the cry; 
Sure it was true what the people were saying, 
For two jockey's on the ground I 
did spy, 
And if there were three, two to one would be laying. 
Then hurrah, etc.

THE HEALTHY GANG. 
Airritten by Jim J. 
NELSON, and sung with great 81.100086 by 
JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Now if yet listen for awhOe, a 
song I'll sing to you, 
And every word I 
utter now, believe me it is true; 
AA a 
party where I 
went last night, a 
healthy gang 1 
saw, 
The first salute they gave me was assasinate the chaw. 
A 
bruiser from the bloody Eigth was singing " Sweet 
Aleen," 
And then he asked the gang to see his grave would 
be kept green; 
And then he did a 
song and dance he called " Sweet 
Kitty Ann," 
And it paralyzed the members of that tough and 
healthy gang. 
C 
RORus. 
Oh, such a 
crowd I 
never saw, on that my oath r11 
take, 
They played casino, pedro, dice and ev'ry kind of fake, 
They said I 
was a 
tarrier, they said I 
shoveled sand, 
I'm sick and sore since first I 
saw that tough and 
healthy gang. 
They asked me up to sing a 
song, when I 
graciously 
declined, 
When Denny Flynn, the fighting man, he struck me 
from behind; 
Says he if you don't sing a 
song I'll show ye who I 
am, 
So I 
got up and vocalized " Muldoon the Solid Man." 
I 
tried to get Pat Rooney's walk, but hardly stepped 
a 
yard, 
When something hit me in the neck, and it struck me 
mighty hard, 
I 
stopped the music right away, I 
then did kick and 
roar, 
I 
said, be Heavens, come what may, I 
will not sing 
no more. 
Oh, such a 
crowd, etc.

THE HEALTHY GANG. 
(Concluded.) 
I 
waltzed around the room to where the gang of row. 
dy's sat, 
I 
said I'd give them fifty cents to tell me who done 
that; 
Says I 
just let him face me now, if he is in the gang, 
And 
make him rue the welt he gave O'Malley's 
cousin Dan. 
I 
struck a 
fighting attitude, and gave an angry scowl, 
I 
thought to scare them by my style, but they set up 
a 
howl; 
One fellow hit me in the ribs which nearly broke his 
hand, 
Oh, I'll ne'er forget when first I 
met that tough and 
healthy gang. 
Oh, such a 
crowd, etc.

LET ERIN REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD. 
LET Erin remember the days of old 
Ere her faithless sons betrayed her, 
When Malachi wore the collar of gold, 
Which he won from her proud invader. 
When her Kings, with standard of green unfurrd, 
Led the Red Branch Knights to danger, 
Ere the Enfrald gem of the western world, 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
On Lough Neagh's bank, as the fisherman strays 
When the clear cold eve's declining, 
He sees the round towers of other days, 
In the wave beneath him shining! 
Thus shall Mein'ry often, in dreams sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpse of the days that are over; 
Thus sighing, look through the waves of Time 
For the long faded glories they cover.

rare battalion of renown, who'd fight as tho' twete

Oh! its strained with admiration is the glance of ev'ry

When tramping by with elegant step, the Hickory

Boldly they tramp away without a

Scowling as though they wished a

On to the field they'd march away so wild, 
It's cannons they would love to bear, instead of the 
muskets mild.

Sung with immense success by 11sansar CANPELL, and also 
HARRY 3IONRROCSE. 
I've had all the ills that belong to our youth, 
The whooping cough, measles and cold, 
I've cut all my teeth, and don't eat with a 
spoor; 
So now I 
begin to feel old. 
Ity ma gazes fondly upon her dear boy, 
With traces of care on her brow, 
And the tears fill her eyes, while fondly she sighs, 
"He's getting a 
big boy now."

CHORUS. 
I'M getting a 
big boy now, 
And I 
fancy it's time I 
knew how 
To brush my own clothes and to wipe my own naki1/
2 
For I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
I 
smoke my papa's best cigars every day, 
And once a 
week I 
get drunk, 
I 
wink at my nurse when she puts me to bed, 
And rocks me to sleep in my bunk; 
I 
once tried to kiss her, she sternly refused, 
And said 
That I 
cannot allow, 
And in future, you elf, ,you must sleep by yotirself, 
For you're getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
PM getting a 
big boy now, 
I'm getting a 
big boy now; - 
Sometimes I 
get tight, and stay out all night, 
For Pm getting a 
big boy now. 
If I 
go to a 
party I 
flirt with the girls--
That is, if they're bigger than I 
am; 
I 
wink and I 
squeeze, and make love on my knees, 
And always ready to sigh am. 
I 
once took my cousin away from the throng, 
For a 
kiss 'neath the mistletoe bough. 
She did what I 
bid. and she liked it, she did,

CHORUS.

And they say before long, they're afraid I'll go wrong, 
For I'm getting a

This Christmas I 
went to my 
first pantomime— 
I'd never been taken before; 
And now that I've been, and the fairies I've seen, 
I 
want to see several more. 
When I 
saw the fairies trip on to the stage, 
I 
felt, I 
can scarce explain how, 
But I 'mow that I 
thought their skirts rather short, 
And I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And that's the best part, you'll allow, 
Where they dance in a 
row and stand on one toe, 
Oh, I'm geting a 
big boy now. 
Sometimes I 
go out for a 
spree with my pal, 
And we jump on poor cripples and babies, 
Old women and such, but men we daren't touch, 
For we're only a 
parcel of gabies. 
And when we can muster a 
hundred or more, 
We're ready to pick up a 
row, 
I 
in a 
coward, I 
own, for I'm no good alone, 
And I'm only a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I 
can fight, kick and bully, I 
vow; 
And of course I 
don't tnind. for I 
only get fined, 
because I'm a 
big boy now.

As sung with great success by the Derroxs. 
Roaring through the forest, 
Gliding through the vale, 
Slipping through the tunnel, 
Flying over the rail; 
Train behind her dancing 
All along the line, 
While you hear the whistle 
Of the Twenty-Nine. 
CHORUS. 
Clear the track the bell is ringing, 
Here she comes on time; 
Hark! oh, hark! I

Of number Twenty-nine. 
Here she comes a- flying 
Through the silent night; 
Don't you hear the whistle? 
Oh, here I

Hear comes Twenty-Nine.

My thoughts are wandering back to-day, 
On joyous scenes of yore; 
The merry boys and girls at play 
Around the cottage door.

The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
CHORUS. 
I 
see again the winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the olden vows; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see again, etc.. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee; 
The girlish voices that I 
hear 
Renew sweet youth in me: 
I 
hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to school.

SUCCeSS. 
Now, ladies and gents, to you, one and all, 
I've come out again in response to the call; 
I've sung many songs in my time but not new, 
But now I 
will sing one I'11 make about you. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh and be merry, laugh and be merry, 
Don't you get mad while I

You must not get angt:y at what's said or done, 
For remember it's jesting and all said in fun.

Now, the first of my subjects is one that I

With hair very slick, by the help of soap fat, 
He's a 
Frenchman from Dublin, his first name ain't 
Pat. 
Laugh and be merry, etc. 
Now 
there's a 
young lady, she appears of good cheer, 
You can tell by her nose she is fond of her beer;

He looks like a 
man that's going to fight; 
He strolls around the Bowery and cuts quite a 
dash, 
He is very fond of that dizzy mustache. 
Laugh and be merry, etc 
Now there's a 
young lady, she works in a 
store, 
She gets three dollars a 
week—I 
know it's not more; 
She wears such clothes that make her look neat, 
But there's one fault about her— she's got such big 
feet. 
Laugh and be merry, etc. 
Now there stands another, with a 
flour-starched 
collar, 
He thinks he's so charming the girls will all follow; 
But there's one thing quite certain, and that he well 
knows, 
He is making a 
splurge in his brother's best clothes. 
Laugh and be merry, etc. 
Now there's a 
young lady looking all over the hall, 
Waiting to see where the nest shot will fall; 
She'd better keep quiet, or I'll let these folks know, 
flow often she fondles and kisses the beau. 
Laugh and be merry, etc. 
Now, ladies and gents, I 
have kept you too long, 
Making my jingles and singing my song; 
To please you to- night I 
have earnestly striven, 
And hope for all wrong I 
shall be forgiven. 
Laugh and be merry, etc. 
In conclusion I 
ask you to call here again, 
Come listen to my speeches, songs, and refrains; 
Throw off all your sorrow about the hard times, 
Come and hear Bruno in his comical rhymes. 
Laugh and be merry, etc.

Oh many a 
time I 
am sad at heart. 
And I 
haven't a 
word to say; - 
And I 
keep from the lads and the lassies apart, 
In the meadows atnaking hay. 
But Willie will bring me the first wild rose, 
In my new sun bonnet te wear, and 
Robin will wait at the keepers gate, 
For he follows we everywhere.

But I

For my heart, my heart is over the sea; 
j3ut I

For my heart, my heart is over the sea. 
Two summers ago when a 
brave ship sailed 
Far away to the golden west., 
Oh nobody knew that my heart went too, 
For the secret I 
never confessed. 
A mother took leave of her boy that day, 
I 
could hear her sob and cry 
As I 
followed her back to her dreary home, 
But never a 
word said I. 
But I 
tell them, ett. 
I 
sat by his mother one midsummer's day 
And she looked me through and through, 
As she spoke of her boy that was far away, 
For she guessed that I 
loved him to. 
She turned to me fondly and whispeyed I, 
You are worthy my sailor boy, when 
My foolish tears they began to flow, 
But my heart beat high for joy. 
But I

I 
love to play my harp and sing 
To all this happy throng. 
I

So just listen for awhile, 
And I'll show you something neater 
In my own peculiar style. 
Now watch the motion, etc. 
I

But I'll leave it all to you,

As the motion of my shoe? 
You can search the world all over, 
You can travel mile and wile, 
Ani you'll find I've not an equal 
In my own peculiar style. 
Now watch the motion, etc.

THE NEVER EMPTY CRADLE—TWINS IS BORN. 
Sung with enthusiastic applause nightly by the ever popular 
HAPPY CAL -WAGNER. 
Never empty cradle, though you're in my care, 
With your precious burden to be fed; 
You're a 
precious nuisance and you make me swear, 
Keeping me out of my snow-white bed. 
With her pimpled cheeks and Sairey Gampey eyes 
Nursey pumey came one wintEr morn; 
Goading me to madness with the " sweet surprise;" 
Crowded was the cradle— twins were born. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle, making twenty-four, 
Sons and daughters making me forlorn, 
I'll go to the 
angel" Ind have two penn'orth more 
Crowded is the cradle—twins are born. 
In her shady bed-room nurse is always found 
All night long the fat old humbug sleeps, 
Or she's round the corner standing glasses round, 
Drinking till she gin and water weeps; 
While the little twinses squalling more and more, 
Swell until they burst their little bed; 
And one little angel wallops on the floor, 
Tumbles from the cradle on his head. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle making twenty-four, 
In my side they are a 
dreadful thorn, 
They don't sing of angels, I 
am blessed sure, 
Crowded is the cradle—twins are born.

Just as I 
get into my first snore; 
Twinses with the quinses wake me in a 
fright. 
Keep me up till half-past three or four. 
Mother sleeps in comfort, says she knows that dad, 
Sees her little chicks don't come to hurt. 
But, poor me! the father, I 
get cold and mad, 
In my cradle costume—that's a 
shirt. 
CHORUS. 
Never empty cradle, baby's in galore, 
Bachelors against it I 
would warn 
If you wed your angel you'll find it a 
bore, 
When you rock the cradle in the morn. 
Who would be a 
father when he knows the price, 
Sees how soon the punishment begins? 
Half a 
dozen times I've been a 
father twice— 
Half a 
dozen pair of healthystwins. 
All my pieces spent and all my peace is gone, 
All my friends now look on me with scorn, 
Say there is no reason in such goings on, 
Worn out is the cradle—twins are born. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle, both are in a 
roar, 
Aroarer early morning to adorn, 
They make pretty angels, never sure before 
Were such little cusses ever born. 
THE POOR GIRL. 
Written by BILT.Y LESTER. 
Once there was a 
young girl 
Named Susie Green; 
She done a 
song and dance 
With 
day and Be 
A 
slack-wire jig 
Which took very well, 
And she married a man 
Named John J. Kerne11. 
CHORUS. 
She'd write out for dates 
On a 
cheap postal card, 
Get answers back to 
Wash clothes in some yard; 
She worked one week for eighteen doNars, 
And used such mean slang 
They sent her to double 
With little 
Lang. 
She was as gentle as a 
pig, 
As fresh as a 
dove; 
She is playing for a 
season 
With Valentine Love. 
Her busiwss is bad, 
Jt could be no finer, 
She has at offer to marry 
From a, 
Miner. 
She'd write out, eta. 
SWEET SIXTEEN. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAtm SERTEMV. 
As sung by CHARLES DiAMONT), 
The first time that I 
fell in love 
I 
never shall forget; 
My heart was pied right thro' and thrict, 
Just like a 
flageolet. 
The gal I 
loved she was a 
blonde, 
The sweetest ever seen; 
She'd sky-blue eyes and rose-bud cheeks, 
And only sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! oh, dear! 
Myself I've never been, 
Since I 
fell in love with that charming girl 
Of only sweet sixteen. 
I 
took her out to see the sights, 
And cut a swell and dash; 
She said she was her daddy's heir, 
And sure to get his cash. 
But things they took a 
chequered course, 
Just when I 
thought she'd wed; 
She fell in love with a 
Chinaman, 
And married him Instead.

UNDER THE SNOW. 
By W ILLIAM GLENDINNING, 
Nay, blame me not for hoarding long, 
With all a 
lone heart's fondest care, 
This bit of broken heather- bloom 
And this wee tress of nut-brown hair. 
In lonely moments they bring back, 
With all their own sweet, mystic powers 
The tones of girlish laughter sweet— 
The gladness of a 
vanished hour; 
CHORUS. 
For oh! my Maggie sleeps to-night, 
Under the snow—under the snow, 
Down where we gathered cowslip- bells, 
In days so long—so long ago. 
She gave me these dear, treasured things, 
One gloaming ' neath the sumnier stars, 
Whose soft light thro' the old eIin leaves 
Fell o'er our path in golden bars; 
While heather- bells and clover-blooms 
Shed on the night their rich perfume, 
And never shadow cross'd our hearts 
To tell of all the coming gloom. 
For oh I 
my Maggie, eta. 
I've prized them more than aught beside, 
E'er since that tender, sacred hour, 
And hid them from cold, careless eyes — 
This curl of hair—this withered flower. 
And oh! they're dearer far than gold, 
These trifling things embalmed in tears, 
They'll link my heart to all I 
love, 
Thro' all the weary tide of years. 
For oh! my Maggie, ate.
