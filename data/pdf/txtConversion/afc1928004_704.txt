PURTY PAT. THE MASHER. 
Written and sung by PAT. Roorrmr. 
I'm purty Pat. the masher, 
They say my photograph 
Looks so very handsome 
It makes a 
jackass laugh. 
Some think I'm Roscoe Conkling 
When I 
swell out my chest, 
You'd think I'd a 
bale of cotton 
Stuffed inside my vest.. 
SPOKEN.—I'd be happy, only l'm married to a 
red-
headed jealous wife. 
The other evening as meself and the 
Jersey Lilly were drinking caster oil sangaree at Delmonico's 
sly wife rushed in, grabbed me by the hair and said: 
CHORUS. 
I've caught you Patsy, 
You can't fool Mary Ann, 
Its queer tricks you're playing 
For an ould married man. 
Come home and rock the cradle, 
You know the twins are sick, 
Or I'll crack your thick skull 
With the soft end of a 
brick. 
When I 
go to Coney island 
And put on a 
bathing suit, 
1 
look like an alligator, 
And me they try to shoot. 
If 1 
see a 
purty lady 
Swimming on the beach, 
flow to swim like a 
porpoise 
The lady I 
do teach. 
SPOKEN.— As I 
was teaching my lady friend, the grand 
Duchess of Hoboken, how to go into the water without 
getting wet, I 
saw what 1 
supposed was a 
bag of rags 
Boating toward me. 
It was my wife. 
She caught me 
and held my head under the water for four } Mors, anti as 
soon as she let me up, she said: 
CH0.—Vve caught you Patsy, etc.

WHEN BORDIII_JA LEAPS OUT IN 
SILK TIGHTS. 
Written anti swigs by PAT. RooNEY. 
My daughter Bordelio's the queen of the stage, 
And her cheeks with red paint she chalks, 
She hires a 
handeart to bring home bouquets, 
And she mashes the baldheaded gawks. 
She sings opera like a 
sick Thomas Cat, 
And gets called out thirteen times at nights, 
The gahory-boys raise the tar off the roof 
When Bordelia appears in silk tights. 
CHORUS. 
(411 her out, the gang do shout, 
hit is a 
county cork rose, 
'1 lit: boys rear aid enehore 
When Bordello puts on her stage clothes. 
She wears plate-glass diamonds that weigh half a 
potrod, 
Her blonde wig is :q?NrCd on to her hair, 
The cast-iron bracelets she wears in her ears 
Cost ,eventeen cents for two pair. 
She will make people sick in her new tragedy, 
Called, " My Rig Mothu-in-law's Rights," 
The gang wants to know, is it Juniho•s cluomo ? 
When Bordella appears ; it silk tights.

MISTER JAMES DOYLE. 
As 
sung by PAT. ROONEY. 
I'd be s 
smart man if I 
only had brains, 
And handsome if I'd change my face, 
Because I 
took a 
prize at the last dog show 
And I 
don't think its a 
disgrace. 
I'm the pet of the ladies and the diamonds I 
weal 
Are made out of glass and tinfoil, 
And no swell in the land looks half as grand 
As the celebrated James doyle. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mister James Doyle, 
My wiie's nane,-! was Boyle, 
I 
play my Gilds ceording to Hoyle, 
so . resh tilia I 
spoil, 
At hard 
work I 
den't toil, - 
For a 
great p,litian i.s Mister James Doyle. 
Some say to Congress I 
ought to be sent, 
While some would send me to jail— 
I 
smoke a 
cigarette, they call me a 
pet, 
And I 
drink champagne by the pail. 
I'm the man who built the big Brooklyn bridge, 
I 
live on the free lunching plan— 
iv'e got a 
face like the man in the moon, 
Mr. James Doyle is the man. 
I'm Mister James Doyle, ea.

DENNIS DOOLAN . 
Written by PAT. ROONEY, the great Irish Comedian. 
I'm a 
man of influence and cultivation, 
Where the Shamrock grows I 
first saw the light, 
And I 
emigrated to this great nation 
Six years ago come next Thursday' night; 
At Castle Garden when the big ship landed, 
Oh! the crowd did gaze with admiring eyes, 
As my friends received me so open handed, 
And " Welcome Dennis!" each one did cry. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah! Dennis Doolan, is my appellation, 
'Tis an honest name which I'll never deny, 
And my friends all say without hesitation, 
The world contains no such man as I 
I 
am naturalized, and a 
politician, 
In the old Fourth Ward I 
have gained renown, 
And I've raised myself to a 
high position 
By the votes I 
own in that part of town. 
The resolutions of our ward meetings 
Are framed by me, for I've lots of lore, 
And the bosses say, each with friendly greeting, 
That I'm a 
credit to old Erin's shore. 
Arran ! Dennis Doolan, 11610. 
At the last election I 
was selected 
For a 
magistrate. out of twenty-
three, 
And I'm proud to say that I 
was elected 
By an overwhelming majority. 
To take my scat I 
was well contented, 
But I 
was not proud of my high degree— 
By admiring friends I 
was then presented 
With this diamond pin that you see on me. 
Arrah 1 
Dennis Doolan, eta 
With the Fourth Ward ladies Pm quite a 
darling, 
For my claims to beauty are by all allowed, 
But although I'm flattered from night till morning, 
It doesn't make me a 
damn bit proud. 
I'll say, adieu, for it don't become me 
To tarry longer than I 
really can; 
My friends expect better things now from me 
Since I've been elected an Alderman! 
Arrah ! Dennis Doolan, et&

AIN'T HE QUITE A DUDE. 
Wanda and music by HARRY S. 
M ILLER, and sung 
Miss Isint.i.AE PARKER with great success. 
I 
wish to speak of one you meet, 
No matter wherever you go, 
In city or town, he's sure to be found, 
He's one that you very well know; 
His style and dress, I 
must confess, 
Is very much fop to see, 
While every day you hear them all say, 
'Oh! ain't he quite a 
dude?" 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't he quite a.dude, they say, 
Isn't he quite a 
dude? 
The dear little pet's a 
darling, you bet, 
But isn't he quite a 
dude. 
Around each hotel yon'll find the swell, 
Dresiod in the Dude's own taste, 
From morning till night, it is- his delight 
To show off his corsetted waist; 
his legs so frail and face so pale, 
He's quite a 
fairy, you see. 
And every day you hear the girls say, 
"Oh! ain't he quite a 
dude?" 
by 
Oh, ain't he, etc 
Too sweet, too fair, yet void as air, 
We find him now every day, 
Too feeble to work, does nothing but flirt 
In his quiet and lif..rinless way, 
An evening call, the girls they all 
Invite him through fun to ..ee; 
When going away, they laughingly say. 
"Oh I 
ain't he an awful thole!" 
Oh, ain't he. ate

GEORGE TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE Ma 
Sring by Jous -NY STILLS with N. 0. Minstrels. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl 
As meek as any lamb, 
She was Ireckled and oilly had one eye, 
And her front name it was Fan; 
She weighed about six hundred pounds., 
And she wanted me to wed, 
She nearly drove me crazy 
When at upon my knee and said:

George, tell me that you leve me; 
Ge•rge, do y,,u love me still? 
If you don't kis:, me twice right in the same place, 
I'll go and drown myself—1 
will. 
When on the street we chanced to roam, 
We mild not help being seen, 
She is so stout and weighs so much, 
While I 
am very lean; 
On her feet she wears number seventeen shoes. 
And the color of her hair is red, 
She'd make me blush behind the ears, 
When in the presence of a 
crowd she said• 
George, tell me, eta 
We're married now, they call us one, 
But I'm certain we are more, 
For when I 
wish to purchase food, 
I 
have to buy the store; 
Her appetite is very great, 
She never gets her fill, 
Be can eat a 
watermelon 
Just like I'd take a

EGGS FOR YOUR BREAKFAST. 
As

I 
love to roam in the bright green fields, 
I 
love to live on a 
farm, 
I 
love to be where the primrose grows, 
For a 
country life has a 
charm. 
I 
love to wander by the old mill stream 
Down by the old hay stack— 
Where you get up in the morning and you see the stin Akins 
And you hear the little ducks quack, quack. 
Quack, quack, quack goes the pretty little ducks, 
The chickens cackle, cackle, that's a 
warning, 
The rooster crows, most everybody knows, 
There are eggs for breakfast in the morning. 
t 
love to wander by the old mill stream, 
I 
love to roll in the grass, 
I 
love to play with the pretty little lambs, 
And along with a 
pretty little lass. 
I

Down where the winds do blow ; 
Where you get up in the morning and you see the sun shinive 
And you hear the little rooster6. crow.

ITS JUST AS CHEAP TO SIT DOWN. 
'Written and sung with great success by HARRY McAvow-
at M INERS Eight Avenue Theatre, New York City, 
I 
fell in love with a 
sweet young miss, 
When I 
was but eighteen, 
We met, was at a 
country fair, 
Her name was Matilda Green. 
Such roguish eyes and curly hair, 
I'm sure I 
can't forget; 
She was her mamma's own baby 
And her papa's little pet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Georgie come and kiss me dear, 
And don't stand there like a 
clown. 
But come into the parlor where 
dark, 
For its just a 
cheap to sit down.---( Repeat.) 
We spoke of love till we fell asleep, 
When I 
awoke it was half past four, 
I 
found that her parents they had been

'Twos packed from pit to dome, 
She fainted twice right in my arms, 
There scarce was elbow room ; 
I 
called a 
oirriage to take her home, 
She recovered when half- way, 
Then straight we went to a 
minister's house 
Just a 
year ago to-day. 
Oh, Georgie come, eta.

He's as black, as black as he can be, 
Now I

De chile dat I

Of de trubble dat she would be to me— 
She had eberyting dat her heart could wish, 
She was raised in de laps of luxury; 
But I

But dat she reflected, before she selected, 
A

Less darkly complected, and not so dejected—

NsANITY. 
We 
just dropped in to bid you all good evening, 
And while we're here, we're going to have some fun, 
We're going to take our girls down to the party 
And dance till the rising of the sun; 
They're as pretty as the snowflakes on the mountain, 
And their eyes are brighter than the lightning flash— 
And when we're Married we've a 
notion 
With the pretty red-haired girls to cut a 
dash. 
You can bet your life we are two dandy Hebrews, 
We're as lively as two crickets on the water, 
And you ought to see us when we cut this figure: 
For we're going to marry Eliza the barber's daughter.

POOR MARRIED MAIL 
Sung with tremendous success by the great SANFORD 
AND W ILSON. 
You may talk of joys of a 
sweet honeymoon, 
I'll agree they're nice while they last, 
But in most every case they are over too soon 
Aml counted a 
thing of the past. 
Your troubles they Legit]. 
You try to do the best you can, 
You will wish you was out of the clatter and din, 
Mat follows a 
poor married man, 
CHORUS. 
With a 
trouble and muss, 
And a 
racket and a 
fuss, 
his face is haggard and wan; 
You can tell by his clothes, 
Wherever he goes, 
That he is a 
poor married man. 
He walks all day to try to be gay, 
Forgetting his sorrow and care ; 
He goes through the town and whistles it (town, 
Though his heart is full of despair'. 
His very last cent is taken for rent, 
While at home there is Mary and Dan, 
They are crying for shoes, which gives him the blues 
To think he's a 
poor married man.—Cno. 
When he goes-to bed, his poor tired head. 
It hangs on the edge of the rail— 
Like the colic and croup, he will jump up and whoop, 
Like a 
dog with a 
can to his tail. 
He must rock, he must walk, he must sing, he must talk, 
And run for the water and fan, 
He must bounce, he must leap, he must do without sleep, 
Because he's a 
poor married man,—CHo.

I've passed through many stirring scenes, 
In distant sunny lands, 
I've seen the foe fall at my feet 
Upon the tropic sands; 
I've heard the hero of the fight 
Bring out his hearty cheers, 
And point me out as I 
passed by, 
As the the pride of the Muskateers. 
Always in the front,

For I

FORBIDDEN FRUIT. 
Written and sung by MANCHESTER and JENNINGS. 
Jtuat. at the time mother Eve she did climb 
The apple tree long ' fore the war, 
She threw down the core, though it made her feel sore 
For her hen-pecked husband to chaw. 
Without evil intention Adam made an invention, 
It was got up both simple and cute, 
And he thought to distill from an old-fashioned mill, 
The juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
Now ever since then all manner of men, 
The deaf, dumb, blind and the mute, 
Our bankers and clerks, politicians and Turks, 
Drink the juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
Now, there's all our preachers and Sunday-school teachers 
Drink what they call sas:afias root, 
But I 
bet all the same, if it had its right name, 
It's the juice of the Forbidden Fruit, 
There's my wife, Holly Ann, she takes out the can 
Whenever we have a 
dispute, 
We sit and we sup, as together we make up, 
From the juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
When our leader has time, from his chair he will olingtio 
And the gang they all follow suit—

IT MAKES A MAN LOOK LIKE A POOL. 
Written by CARL HERTZ. "King of Cards." 
If you meet with a 
figure all satin and lace 
it makes a 
man look like a 
fool! 
If you rush to catch but a 
glimpse of her face 
It makes a 
man look like a 
fool! 
If you place your hand on her shoulder so bold 
And she lifts up her veil and lets you behold 
A 
wrinkled old maiden some fifty years old, 
it makes a 
man look like a 
fool. 
If you're asked for the time, and you've only a 
chain, 
It makes a 
man look like a 
fool! 
If your umbrella turns inside out in the rain, 
It makes a 
man look like a 
fool! 
if you go out with a 
lady, for whom you do care, 
And you meet with you're tailor before you're aware, 
And he asks you to settle that little affair 
It makes a 
man look like a 
fool! 
If a 
youth goes to get shaved with no hair on his face, 
It makes him feel just like a 
fool! 
If you lose all your money on a 
bet or a 
race, 
It makes a 
man feel like a 
fool! 
If you go out with a 
lady to see a 
new play, 
And ask her to supper at a 
fashionable cafe, 
Putyour hand in your pocket and you've no money to pay, 
It makes a

MeGILLIGAN'S SPITZ PUP. 
RECITATION. 
Written by M ANCHESTER and JENNINGS and recited b
.) 
them with great success. 
McGilligan had a 
spitz pup 
Whose maiden name was zip, 
And everywhere he set his teeth 
He never lost his grip. 
His appetite was wonderful, 
He was never known to fail, 
And he'd bite a 
sirloin from your leg, 
If you stood upon his tail. 
MeC.;illigan's Spitz Pup. 
His eyes they shone like diamonds, 
His head was small and round, 
And his tail it curled so tight 
It rais'd his hind legs from the ground; 
His hair was gray and shaggy, 
His skin so loose and slack, 
And the fleas had built a 
boarding house 
In the middle of his back. 
MeGilligan's Spitz pup. 
Now, every dog must have his day, 
And then come down a 
peg, 
He met McGee's blind mule one day 
And grabbed him by the leg; 
In about two minutes 
He was plowing up the sidewalk with his head; 
He'll never bite another mule— 
MeGilligan's Spitz is dead.

I

There's a

But calm yourselves at once and be serene; 
You can bet your bottom crown

Though appearance indicates that I 
am green. 
But make no ghastly error, 
I

A

And the boss bee of the hive 
Is among you and alive, 
Bringing simon-pure distraction in his train.

There must have been some trouble, 
For not a

PICTURES IN THE FIRE. 
A RECITATION. 
Written and performed by CHA.s. T. 
ELLIS and Mpg 
CLARA M OORE, in their Comedy Drama of 
GOTTLIEB THE W ANDERER. 
Sweet Norah, come here and look into the fire, 
Perhaps in its embers good luck we may see, 
But don't come too near or your glances so burning 
Will put it clean out, like the sumbeams machree. 
Just look ' twixt the bars where the black sod is smoking, 
There's a 
sweet littte valley with rivers and trees, 
And a 
house on the bank quite as big as the Squire's, 
Who knows but some day we'll have something like these 
And now there's a 
coach with four galloping horses, 
A coachman to drive and a 
footman behind, 
That shows that some day we'll keep a 
fine carriage, 
And fly through the streets with the speed of the wind, 
As Gottlieb was speaking the rain-drops came hissing 
Down the wide chimney—the fire went out, 
While mansion and river and horses and carriage, 
All vanished in smoke wreaths that whirled then about 
Then Norah to Gottlieb this spee.'h softly whispered, 
It were better to do than idly desire, 
And one little hut by the roadside is better 
Than a 
palace with servants and a 
coach in the fire.

And I'll meet her when the sun goes down.

And I'll meet her when the sun goes down.

In a

babbling brook, 
I

When Sunday comes we take a

In the woods we stroll all around; 
Next Sunday at nine, I'll call her mine— 
We'll be married when the sun gees dews.

When some one pulls the string; 
CHORUS. 
I'm called a 
monkey jumping jack, 
And a 
nasty, naughty thing, 
Let him alone and he'll come home, 
When some one pulls the string. 
I'm matched against the great Langtry, 
A chance you don't get often, 
To dance a 
jig for an eight day pig, 
But they say my brain will soften. 
'We're to meet next Sunday over the Rhine, 
And her lovers she will bring, 
But I'll be there if I 
lose my hair, 
And some one pulls the string. 
I'm called. etc. _

LUNACY. 
Written by JAMES S.

While running down the street one afternoon, 
For to catch a 
butterfly,' 
I 
jammed my head into a 
big spittoon, 
Oh, how is that for high. 
Kaiser don't you want to buy a 
dog, 
Or a 
sixteen carat pin. 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows, 
Vith a 
bunion on her shin.

Oh, my, you ain't catch me, ( Break.)

They call me a 
big bag of hay, 
Six times I

Good evening white folks one and all, 
I've a 
gum bile on my neck. 
Oh. here I 
am a

Singing, dancing all the day, 
A 
regular Hanky Panky cove, 
I'm all dressed up in my Sunday clothes. 
I

They say my face would stop a 
clock, 
I 
work out here a 
blasting rock, 
Oh, how is that for low. 
I 
put on style with my stand-up collar, 
When I 
sing I 
never holler, 
You can bet your bottom dollar 
I 
never miss a 
meal. 
When I 
hear the music playing 
I 
rattle off my heel and toe, 
I'm Erastus Henry Johnson, 
And I've got tar upon my heel.

And love the daisies, 
Love the sweet daiitiew, for you.

The fairest, sunniest summer

Oft from this pale, dead blossom,

A

Out of its faded heart.

Price 40 cents. 
The spell is past, the dream is o'er, 
And tho' we meet we love no niore, 
One heart is crusl.'d to droop and die, 
And for relief must heav'nward fly. 
The once bright smile has faded—gone— 
And given way to looks forlorn, 
Despite her gm-ideur's wicked flame 
She stoops to blush beneath her shame. 
CHORUS. 
We never speak as we puss by, 
Altho' a 
tear bedims her eye; 
I 
know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I 
sought her side, 
And she became my virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace—so fair, so bright; 
One sunny day, no gloomy night. 
No life on earth more pure than ours, 
In that dear home midst field and flow'rs, 
Until the tempter came to Nell, , 
It dazzled her—alas, she fell! 
We never speak, etc. 
In gilded hall, midst wealth she dwells; 
How her heart aches her sad face tells! 
She fain would smile—seem bright and gay; 
But conscience steals her peace away. 
And when the flatt'rer casts aside 
My fallen and dishonored bride, 
I'll close her eyes in death—forgive! 
And in my heart her name shall live. 
We never speak, eta.

ONLY A PIN. 
POEM. 
As Recited by CAVANA and MASON. 
Only a 
pin, 
Yet it calmly lay, 
On the turfred floor in the light of the day, 
On it slim:L.!, shone serenely fair and bright, 
Rellc,.:ting back from the noon day's light, * 
Only a 
boy, 
Yet he saw that pin; 
And his face assumed a 
fiendish grin, 
lie stopped for a 
while, with a 
look intent, 
Until him and the pin alike were boat. 
Only a 
chair. 
But on its seat, 
A 
well bent pin found safe retreat,. 
Nor had the keenest eye discent, 
That heavenward its point was bent. 
Only a 
man, 
But he chanced to drop 
Upon the chair when biff bang pop, 
He leaped like a 
cork from out of a 
bottlq, 
And opened wide his valve-de-throttle. 
Only a 
yell, 
Though an honest one, 
It lacked the element of fun, 
The boy and man and pin and chair, 
In wild confusion mingled there.

Written and composed for Miss KATIE COOPER by CHAIM= 
CONNOLLY, author and composer of "Dancing in the 
Dreamy 'Waltz," "Twilight Coterie," "Levi 
Kassiday," " Waltz with me," etc. 
There's a 
fellow so simple who calls upon me, 
Who thinks he's surprisingly clever, 
To be posted on every expression that's new, 
Is always his eager endeavor. 
"Are you going very far ?" "Yes I 
are," "Well, ta, ta," 
And such brilliant nonsense he mutters. 
But of late he has caught something crazier still. 
And this is the question he utters t 
CHORUS. 
Is your mamma well, baby, is your mamma very well; 
Health of papa good, daisy, is your papa cheerful, tell, 
And your sister is she very bright, brother, too, is he all 
right ? 
And again, love, are you quite sure your mamma's well ? 
In the talk of the day he's a 
genius indeed, 
For certainly none could be wiser, 
Not a 
thing that occurs but he's sure to insist, 
'Was "all on account of Eliza." 
"Not this eve !" " Well, good-eve !" he so quickly did learn 
When "What, never 1" he had to smother, 
'Are you going to the ball, love, this evening?" came next, 
With its answer, "Not this, but some other." 
SPOKEN,—He's a 
regular dictionary of popular slang, 
He knows all about "jays, gillys, fre,she,s, gawks, rubes, 
terrors, daisies," and other curiosities, 
and talks about 
"Shooting dicers, Taking tumbles, Bracing main guys," and 
"Going to the ball this evening, or, some other, no other, 
this other, or any other, good evening" until he crazes me. 
And now he makes matters worse by asking me, 
Is your mamma well, etc.

PARODY ON SCOTCH LASSIE JAINIB. 
As sung with great success by CAVANA and M ASON. 
Not many blocks from here, 
Where they sell good lager beer, 
I 
Ayes a 
maiden who has got me on the string, 
She's the worst you ever saw, 
And she nearly broke my jaw, 
And made me wear my left duke in a 
sling, 
She's a 
female pugilist, 
Holy suffering what a 
fist, 
She'll send you where you won't come back again, 
Tier nose is like a 
beet, 
She's the terror of Bleeeker street, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Jane, oh! Jane, my Kentucky Jane pants, 
Busted Friday evening at the dance. 
They say that she is crazy, 
But I 
still think she's insane, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane. 
She promised she would meet me, 
When the clock struck seventeen, 
At the stock yards, a 
mile out of town, 
Where the pigs feet and the pigs ears, 
And the tough old Texas steers, 
Sell for sirloin steak, at ten cents a 
pound. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She is hump-backed and she's crazy, 
She's knock-kneed, she's bow-legged and she's lame, 
She's always full of blarney, 
And she's struck on Dennis Kearney, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Jane, Oh! Jane, my poor foolish Jane, 
Slug me with your suspenders once again, 
They say her teeth are false, 
From eating Rochelle salts, 
She's my skinny, lanky Sarah Bernhart Jane.

PARODY ON LOVE. 
Whoa a 
fellow falls in love with a 
little turd* dove, 
He'll kiss her all around the under jaw, 
He'll kiss her for her mother, her sister and her broths. 
Till her father comes and kicks him from the door. 
Pulls a 
pistol from his pocket, pulls the trigger for to welt 
And vows he'll blow away his giddy brain, 
But his ducky says he mus'n't—it isn't loaded, so he doesn't. 
And then they're kiasing one another once again. 
CHORUS. 
Old maids love it, old women are above it, 
Everybody's got a 
finger in the pie; 
Some women are so haughty, they say its very = Ugh% 
But you can bet they'll kiss you on the sly. 
When a 
girl is seventeen, she thinks its awful mean 
If she cannot get a 
fellow for to mash, 
She'll pucker up her lips with such a 
pretty pout, 
And she'll slobber all over a 
big moustache. 
They'll make a 
fellow shiver and make him jump diethyl? 
Till he thinks his clothes are granulated glue. 
Its no use to tell her your some other girl's fellow, 
For she'll smash you in the smeller if you do.

There it stands in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so statety and tall! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no ene now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh 1 
how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I, 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tell: 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS. 
DEHN-
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years had she sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell: 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
Ile cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue! 
It could tell of bright days and of dark one, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have follow'd her, yes, one by one, 
/They have all gone to meet her in the "sweet by-and-by," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs, or her cap; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. ,

THE OLD FIRE-PLACE. 
iforia and music by T. V. SHORT. 
Written expressly tot 
and sung only by NELLY RICHARDS. 
Last night when dreaming by the fire gleaming, 
In fancy, before me a 
vision appeared, 
As I 
lay sleeping, old friends they came tripping, 
Friends of the by-gones to childhood endeared; 
Father and mother and each childish lover, 
All seemed in my dreams, as I 
left them to roam, 
The bright fire burning did greet my returning 
To that old fire-place in my dear old home. 
CHORD'S. 
Scenes now vanished, forever vanished, 
Still through this world as I 
roam; 
My heart it is burning to be quick returning 
To that old fire-place in my dear old home. 
In arm chair sitting, my mother was knitting, 
My father he still did his old Duddeen.smoke, 
'While to the rafters ascended the laughter 
As he'd be repeating his often time told joke. 
Up on the landing the old clock still standing 
Proclaimed the swift hour from cellar to the dome— 
From my sleep waking, I 
found my heart breaking, 
For gone was the fire-place in my dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Scenes now vanished, forever vanished, 
Still through this world as I 
roam; 
'My heart it is burning to be quick returning 
To that old fire-place in my dear old home.. 
THE SAUSAGE MAN. 
Written by Charles Glidden for CAVANA and M ASON. 
• 
I'll sing of a 
man he could stand on his head, 
He used to sell sausage with mustard and bread 
He used to sell sausage two for a 
dime, 
In sweet Cincinnati, way over the Rhine. 
This man had a 
can, it was made out of tin, 
He used to put sausage and horse radish in 
With a 
lamp in the bottom the sausage to cook, 
For a 
nickel he'd bring you up one with a 
hook. 
When night would come up he would shoulder his can,. 
And he'd sail around the great city of Hams, 
He'd swell himself up like a 
big lump of yeast, 
And he'd yell out "hot weinerwust five cents a 
piece-
Of a 
sausage machine this man he was boas, 
If a 
dog went that way he surely was lost, 
And the cats on the fence, oh ! how they would hustle, 
When they saw old Weinerwust out on his muscle. 
One night he got full and he went to a 
show, 
And like a 
steam engine this man he did blow, 
He got hit in the head with a 
schooner of beer, 
And he died with a 
weinerwust stuck-in his ear.

Ebry where I

Oh! darkeys, how my heart grows weary, 
Far from de old folks at home. 
All around de little farm I 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brodder, 
Happy was I;

take me to my kinf, old mudder, 
Dere let live and die. 
All de world, eta 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I 
love; 
Still sadly to my memory rushee, 
No matter where I 
rove. 
When will I 
see de bees a

All round de comb? 
When will I 
hear de banjo turuming, 
Down in my good old home.

OLD TIME'S ROCKS. 
Banjo Solo sung by BILLY W INS 
The way we travel now-a-days, 
Surprises us with its different ways. 
In Chicago they go it by pitch and tow, - 
You can jump off for ten minutes 
And get a 
divorce. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's old Time's rocks is number one, 
Oh how is that for high. 
The telegraph workers are on a 
strike, 
The way things are working 
They don't seem to like. 
The last message they sent I 
think was a 
stunner, 
To fight it out on one wire if it took all summer. 
Then its, sta. 
Oh, Fisk, the Erie Prince, is pie, 
He's always exclaiming, "How's that for high?" 
I 
hear from Alaska, he's buying up bears, 
But in Jersey they've snatched him 
?or raising the fares. 
Then its, eta 
The Morman's they have had a 
flare, 
Each other's opinions to pieces they tear, 
Brigham Young still coos like an ol& turtle dove, 
Says he's coining on North, 
To go in for free love.

OUR BABY'S GOT A CRAMP. 
WAtten expressly for BOB. SLAVEN by FRANK DUX0111%. 
Pm the daddy of two infants 
Who raise an awful fuss, 
And if I 
try to spank 'em, 
Why, it only makes ' em worse. 
The police say they cannot sleep 
When they are on their beat, 
And all the neighbors are compelled 
To go and walk the street. ' 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Bob! dear Bob I 
do get out of bed 
Stand that sassy brat on its little head! 
To the doctor run and frolic, 
For the kids have got the colic, 
Get a 
dose of paregoric, 
Baby's got a 
cramp, 
When I 
sit down to eat my meals, 
They climb upon my knees 
And fill my ears with mucilage 
And stuff my nose with cheese. 
They make an omelette in. my hat, 
They stick me full of pins, 
You don't know what enjoyment is 
Till you have a 
pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Bob! dear Bob! do put on your boots, 
Get some laud-en-um for those two galoots,. 
We've emptied all that's in the castor, 
Do make haste a 
little faster, 
Run and get a 
mustard-plaster. 
Baby's got a 
cramp. 
They fill my shoes with water, 
They try to shave the cat; 
They stuck a 
pin into a 
chair 
And on its point I 
sat; 
60. 
OUR BABY'S GOT A CRAMP .—Concluded. 
They greased the stairs with tallow, 
You'd ought to hear me " beller" 
When I 
fell down from the garret and 
I 
landed in the cellar. 
HORUS. 
Oh, Bob ! dear Bob get up and walk the floor 
Slap that.sassy brat ! make it hold its Jaw 
I 
cannot get a 
wink of shunber, 
Of chloroform give them a 
tumbler, 
Make 'em eat a 
green cucumber 
And kill 'em with a 
cramp.

HOME SWEET HOME. 
Mid pleasures and palaces though we_ may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home; 
A 
charm from the skies, seems to hallow us there, 
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er net with elsewhere, 
Home, homsp,- sweet, sweet home, 
There's no place like home. : II 
I 
gaze on the moon, as I 
trace the drear wild, 
And feel that my parent now thinks of her child; 
She looks on that moon from her own cottage door, 
Through woodbines whose fragrance shall cheer me no more 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, &c. 
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain, 
0, give me my lowly, thatched cottage again; 
The birds singing gaily that came at my call, 
Give me them with the peace of mind, dearer than all, 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, &c.

For she's buckled on her ulster and skedaddled to Cheyenne 
To civilize the nasty, naughty Sioux.

And how old Bill the Biter, that companion for Old Nick,
