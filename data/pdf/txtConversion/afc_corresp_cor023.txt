[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
August 28, 1939]
August 28, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Director, Federal Writers' Project 49 West Duval Street
Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Thank you for your letter of August 24 with reference to the shipment of needles. This
settles all the doubtful points regarding shipments. We have ordered from Presto extra
records to be sent to the address you have us in your last letter: Writers' Project Office,
712 Wallace S. Building, Tampa, Florida. Please let me know when these arrive.
I am anxiously awaiting the recorded discs.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
