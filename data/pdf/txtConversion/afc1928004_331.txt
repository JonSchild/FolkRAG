BIOGRAPHY. 
SAM MARTIN.—This celebrated one-legged Song and 
Dance Artist and Jig Dancer, made his appearance as a 
public performer in San Francisco, where he was wel-
comed with great demonstrations of approval by the 
entire populace, who were familiar with his daring ex-
ploits as a 
soldier, and sympathizing with the misfor-
tune that he had sustained by the loss of a 
leg while in 
the discharge of his duty as a 
soldier. 
Mr. Martin is an 
unusually fine singer, having attained a 
musical culture 
which enables him to execute difficult aria's from the fa-
vorite Opera's 
and his simple renderings t)f home bal-
lads and plantation refrains, endears him to the hearts 
of his audience. 
His literary ability is most pronounced 
and acknowledged. 
He is the author of some of the 
most popular songs sung on the Concert Stage. 
His re-
cent engagement, in New York, was an ovation that any 
one might be proud of. 
In Boston he was greeted with. 
the same demonstrations of approval: and, in fact, 
wherever he appears, the wildest excitement prevails to 
witness his extraordinary and artistic performances. An 
elegant vocalist, an accomplished dancer, and a 
cultured 
gentleman, Mr. Martin is an ornament to the profession 
and an honor to society. 
The contents of this book will 
comprise some of his latest and best productions, to-
gether with celebrated authors, and embrace a 
few of 
Claude De Haven's most eagerly sought after poems.

Song and Dance. 
Written and sung with tremendous 
success, at TONY PASTOR'S New Theatre, New York, 
BY SAM M ARTIN, America's Premier One-legged 
Song and Dance Artist and Jig Dancer. 
In the Central Park, the other day, 
I 
met my charmer fair, 
Her pretty face and beaming smiles— 
And she had such lovely hair— 
While from beneath her jockey hat 
Those curly tresses fell ; 
And when I 
smiled she blushed, and look'd 
Like the roses in the dell. 
CHORI7S. 
And it's Oh, My ! she looked divine. 
(sym) 
How I 
wisheclathat she was mine. (Sym) 
She's the fairest little flower I've ever seen ; 
In the Park she is the Belle! 
Whene'er we meet, her blush is just 
Like the roses in the dell. 
We sat awhile beneath the tree, 
The time flew swiftly by; 
She said she felt so happy then. 
But could not tell me why ; 
I 
asked her, then, if she'd be mine 
Into my arms she fell, 
And answered " Yes 
and crimson blushed, 
Like the roses in the dell. 
And it's Oh, My!

And compliment my crutch.

111,0UND OF ROSES. 
Written by ANDY MCKEE, for SAM MARTIN, America's Most Won. 
derful and Artistic One Legged Song and Dance Artist and Jig Dancer. 
THE shades of night had fallen, 
The dew was on the:ground, 
'Twas near a 
bed of roses, 
I 
saw while gazing round 
A 
figure pass before me, 
I 
scarcely heard a 
sound, 
She seemed to gather roses, 
From ofl a 
little mound. 
CHORUS. 
She spoke— her voice it charmed me, 
Then to my side did bound, 
" 
You're welcome to a 
flower. 
From off my rosy mound." 
I 
drew her mantle closer, 
Around her beauteous form, 
That I 
might keep her near me, 
And kiss that hand so warm. 
She passed her little arm through mine, 
We walked the garden round, 
She said I 
might assist her, 
To pick roses from her mound. 
Oh now we have a 
garden, 
Which all belongs to me, 
And several little gardeners: 
That's beautiful to see, 
And should you want some flowers, 
I 
hope you'll call around, 
And gather those to suit you, 
From off our little moun,l.

Written by SHORT STOP. 
Sung by THE FIELDLNGS. 
Know'st thou the land whose stormy shore 
E'er echo's to the billows' roar, 
Whose cliffs frown o'er the briny spray ? 
To that fair land let us away. 
Where e'er I 
live—where e'er I 
stray— 
It haunts my thought by night and day. 
CHORUS. 
America the great ! 
America the free T. 
America the brave ! America for me 1 
Know'st thou the Nation, great and free, 
Whose sway extends from Sea to Sea ; 
Whose equal has ne'er yet been found? 
Search where you will—the world around. 
It is a 
Nation great and proud— 
Who, self-reliant, sings aloud— 
America the great! Ars-
Know'st thou the lay, whose stirring strains 
Each free and noble soul enchains ; 
The lay that makes the heart rejoice, 
When it is sung with heart and voice ? 
It is a 
lay of wondrous might— 
O'er land and sea it brings its flight. 
America the grest! tte.

Oh! say, can you see by the dawn's early light. 
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleuming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous tight. 
O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red rclare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there. 
Oh! say, does thaT7tar spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave ? 
CHORUS. 
Oh! say, does that star singled banner yet wave, 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
On the shore, dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep, 
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes— 
What is that which the breeze, o'er the 
twering steep 
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses— 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam; 
In full glory reflected, now shines in the stream? 
'Tis the star spangled banner, oh! long may it wave 
O'er the lamt of the free and the home of the brave! 
Uhl say, 
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, 
'Mid the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, 
A home and a 
country they'd leave us no more? 
Their blood had washed out their foul footsteps' pollution! 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight. or the gloom of the grave. 
And the star spangled banner, in triumph shall N1-ave 
O'er the land of the free mid the home of the brave! 
Oh, say, & c. 
0, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand 
Between their loy'd home and the war's desolation; 
Blest with vict'ry and peace. may the heav'n-rescued land, 
Praise the pow'r that hath made and preserved us a 
nation. 
Then conquer we must, since our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto:—" In God is our trust!" 
And the star spangled banner, in triumph shall wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A 
dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pAss before my eyes ! 
I 
r 
iised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pals'd, iu sfrane array, 
A 
great and bustlin..; crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred 3 
ears— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Theie shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft— she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
That) the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men cf Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop 
By F:eedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main ; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle slain; 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant O.:, 1 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washinulon upon the ice 
Of Delaware. adrift 1 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, f :Horn; 
And still their hearts with patriot fire 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold, 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went torth to die! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more! 
Our glorious Constitution, boys! 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe; 
And Taylor ', old our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling! 
I 
saw old Independence Ball, 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock io the people spoke, 
"'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia. far above, 
She pointed clown with pride. 
Unto our Flag. and proudly said--

SLAVERY DAYS.

POND, N. 
Y. 
I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd. away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night, when all was da-
rk, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road ; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our inem'ry will turn roun, when our souls dey were 
tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

No more a

But stay at home with me.

FAIR AMERICAN GIRLS. 
As Sung by THE BRIHAIVIS. 
What shall I 
sing to you, 
What for a

Some sad love story, or 
Some poet's dream ? 
No, I've a

Far dear,r than pearls, 
What we all love the most 
Fair American girls. 
CrtoErs. 
Fair American Girls, dear American Girls ! 
Where can they equall'd be ? 
Bright American Girls, dear American Girls! 
Fair American Girls for me. 
Talk not of damsels 
Of sweet sunny France ; 
Nor Italy's daughters, 
With dark flashing glance; 
Proud Spanish maidens, 
Though haughty and grand. 
Can ne'er equal those 
Of our dear native land. 
Fair American Girls, &c. 
No American e'er spreads 
His fair sails to the wind, 
But sighs for some dear one 
He's leaving behind; 
And though he may wander, 
The world o'er and o'er; 
No fairer maids meet him, 
Than those we adore. 
Fair American Girls, &c. 
Each darling may rival, 
The Lily or Rose! 
Each American for their sake 
Would conquer all foes; 
E'er may America's fair diadem 
Be deck'd with such pearls, 
Is alone she can boast of, 
Her fair American Girls.

THE STARS OF THE PERIOD, 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Masten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day ; 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In t
iheir great act, " Slavery Days," 
Dearning applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" (the " gallant") 
Observe the boys possess men's talent. 
Nature, Harrigan has surely blest, 
Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so well, 
In dancing none can him excel; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this arti-t know. 
Homage should to both be paid: 
Astonishing 
The Day Parade ;" 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Braham bad its birth; 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
S 
ATISFACTION, great, is given to all— 
Now don't forget this night to call.

"OUR BOYS." 
An American Patriotic and Humorous Song, written and 
Sung by Jou./ NASH. 
Copyrighted 1E75, byW. POND & CO, Music Pub., 547 B'wa.r. N. Y. 
Uncle Sam he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they called upon Sam for a 
strain, 
So he put out his weed, and toss'd off his glascs. 
And then he commenced this refrain : 
I'll sing of " Our Boys" who have made a 
great name 
Their is Captain Bogardus, said he, 
In Europe he showed them how well we could shoot. 
His equal you will seldom see. 
CHORUS. 
lie is one of " Our Boys," he is; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are ; 
If he is honest and true, we give him his due; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," Hurrah! 
We have got a 
very good Rifle Team, 
They eross'd the wide ocean, you know, 
And defeated the Dollymount marksmen with ease, 
And won all the prizes, that's so! 
They've defeated, since then, the Canadian Team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They could easily beat any marksmen on earth— 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
They belong to " Our Boys," they do, &c. 
81 
When Old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair, 
It was one of " Our Boys,"—Jim Bennett, who said— 
For the Doctor I'll now have a 
care. 
It was one of " Our Boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found; 
All honor to Stanley! may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
He is one of " Our Boys," &c. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame, 
Is one we must never forget; 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished the world you may bet! 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring, as we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty good man. 
CHORUS. 
Ile was chief of " Our Boys," he was; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
ke was honest and true, so give him his due; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," we are.

Words by J. C. Goonwrg. 
Music by EDVD E. Iticit. 
When first the sound of battle came, 
We gaily marched away, 
For when we heard our country call, 
We could not but obey; 
For truth and right the first to fight 
And never known to flee, 
Our fathers recognize their sous, 
The gallant Ninth are we. 
CHORUS. 
A 
hundred years ago we stood in fight arrayed, boys, 
And boldly met the foe, for truth and liberty : 
our voice is living still, and we should be obeyed, boys, 
Who gave our lives to make you free a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
little band of earnest men, 
Who knew no law but right; 
We just a 
century ago 
Set Freedom's torch alight, 
We fought and fell and ages tell 
The story which you know, 
Of how the sun of Glory rose 
A 
hundred years ago.

Before old master's soul did roam, 
But now the poor darkey's have to wander, 
Far from de old Kentucky home. 
Good bye, old folks, good bye, 
Now we'll have to roam, 
Since master's gone and left us,

HICKORY JACKSON. 
Sung by HARRY W ESTERN, ill 
Rose's Courtship, at the 
Park Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
NOW kind friends do look at me, 
And an old man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday. 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle, 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle, 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay. 
Dem was de good old times, 
When you could save de dimes. 
But now tern times am gone and passe,d away, 
But give ire de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
Dats when old man Hickory Jaekson had his day. 
One thing more I'd like to say, 
Just before I 
go away, 
Of the times I 
use to have in Dixie's Land. 
I 
use to hoe de corn from de breaking of de morn, 
And many a 
clod of earth has bruised de'se hands. 
But when de work was done, we darkey's had de fun, 
Old master got our jug and cleared de way, 
For de old Virginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel, 
Pats when old man Hickory Jackson had his day.

And soon

When before my e. es a

I

And the people I 
saw were very queer; 
First Moody and Sankey appeared on the scene, 
„logs on their feet, and suits of bright green; 
They aaced a 
hornplw, and tumbled about, 
'Till 2.Ioody gave up with a 
twinge of the gout, 
N7ard Beecher in my dream took a 
part, 
And turned six somersaults over John Hart; 
Men ire•ident Grant went on the trapeze, 
Turned eighteen flip- flaps, and frit on his -knees; 
Lilly :Jo rtwright rode on a

Kernell cam3 . n

terrible spree, 
And told John Hart " not to give it a

Then Big Six-came in— the once famous " Boss"— 
And sang a 
duet with young Charley Ross. 
Sweet Susan Anthony stood on the floor, 
And wit t 
her jokes kept the house in a 
roar. 
Tony Pas or san,t: " Ta, ta Baby Dear," 
And Tennie C. Clan' walked in on her ear. 
The ghost of Toni Collins appeared in white, 
And went 'round the room looking for fight. 
John Raymono raw turnips gave to the band, 
While Scanlon and Cronin stood " Hand in Hand 
Sam Rickey was there, with " John Wi:d's Oid Man;" 
Barry kept time with 11 s " Alabann." 
Allen was " Schneider" than ever before, 
And John Thompson was " 
nand" at the door. 
Harrigan and hart dre.ssed in " Blue and Gray," 
And evidently both hail been " Led Astray." 
Sam Sanford was seated on a 
high throne. 
And played " Little Sty etheart" on the j 
twhone. 
Dick Carroll danced till he quite lost his mind, 
And dvxed Gus Wi hams LO •` Pull Down the Blind," 
George Knight made love to II - mfler's •‘ Sweet Aleen," 
And Ad. llyinan tried to eat a

They kept up their frol:c an hour or more. 
When, to my surprise, [ ! ward it great roar. 
The floor gave way, and they all tumbled in t

Emblem, sweet Nellie, of my love for you. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I

Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same ; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again. 
Boy.-0! here you are, my own sweet love, 
0! come and sit down by my side, 
And answer, darling quickly, do! 
And say you will be my bride.

Of when we first did meet; 
And now we are happy with our joys, 
In love and kisses sweet.

AMERICA my jewel, 
We sing most cheerfully;

Hurrah l 
for our gallant soldier boys, 
Let's shout a 
wild hurrah! 
Hurrah! for our gallant sailor boys, 
Each gal ant bold Jack Tar. 
Should a 
foreign foe insult us, 
Right eager for t 
he f 
It's hand to hand with Dixies band 
We'd march in Blue and Gray. 
Oh, noble men have fallen 
On each and ev'ry side, 
We uncover to their mem'ry, 
Graves cannot gl y 
hide. 
We 
4 nly have one country, 
The people firmly say, 
Our flag, the glorious stars and stripes, 
To guide us on our way. 
Chorus.— Hurrah! &c.

To honor and obey.

Its now a 
hundred years ago, 
Since freedom first did dawn; 
And many a 
thought comes o'er us, 
As we hail the coming morn; 
So we'll make bold, the Scenes unfold, 
The changes from that day; 
The battles won, the great things done, 
Since Freedom gained the day. 
Well tell you, first, of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe 
Who wished to tax the people 
That the Tea did overthrow. 
He nobly tried, and bravely died, 
He well the battle won. 
Nnd Washington, the finish gave 
To what he'd left undone. 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy-Six! 
One hundred years since we did the tyrants fix ! 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy-Six! [Repeat] 
Then Jackson! with his cotton bales, 
He made the red-coats fly; 
Our banner, still triumphant, 
The invaders did defy; 
And Lawrence fought, the lesson taught, 
Not to give up the Ship! 
And Winfield Scott, at Lundy's Lane! 
Tri, the days of Seventy-Six: 
Sung by ROLLIN HowLED, in his celebrated character of 
" 
thpt. Mantraville," in his emotional play of 
CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
Yes, let me like a 
soldier fall. 
Upon some open plain; 
This breast expanding for the ball, 
To blot out every stain ; 
Brave, manly hearts, confer my doom, 
That gentler 'ones may tell, 
Howe'er forgot, unknown my tomb, 
I 
like a 
soldier fell. 
I 
only ask of that proud race 
Which ends its blaze in me, 
To die the last, and not disgrace 
Its ancient chivalry ; 
Though o'er my grave no banner waste— 
That gentler ones may tell, 
Howe'er forgot, unknown my tomb, 
I 
like a 
soldier fell.

For Scholars, the Brady's were famous— 
For beauty, the equal of Venus.

OUR CENTENNIAL. 
AIR: 
Crime. 
As sung by ToNY PASTOR. 
THE years now will soon be one hundred. 
Since the people united combined, 
Since Jeilerson framed independence, 
Which 2:ohn Hancock so boldly he signed 
Each patriot he : otig,lit for ' ifs homestead, 
And c.'et! Lie its iberty '
on, 
So I'll describe the 
completed, 
And so well .),y 
our 
begun. 
We have crossed the great plains to the west, sirs, 
Our Republic has stood a 
hard test, sirs, 
But in all things we have got the best, sirs, 
As well I 
will prove in my song. 
We fight the wild Indians with quakers, 
Give them ruin when they ask us for bread, 
The police beat the honest hard workers, 
For expressing the wrongs they have had, 
We take the back pay from the members, 
But allow them more mileage instead, 
We allow twenty wives in Salt Lake, sirs, 
Though two sure would drive a 
man mad, 
But the years now will soon be one hundred, 
Since we from John Bull first were sundered, 
When King George he went crazy and blundered, 
And Columbia her freedom did gain. 
We made great mistakes in our time, sirs, 
As every young nation will do, 
But if we, like our fathers combine, sirs, 
The Stars and the Stripes will pull through, 
We 1r,ve 0-
:)t the great wealth of this world. sirs. 
Our share too of muscle and brain, 
Why should we our our old banner close furl, sirs. 
And .-
shov: the white feather to Spain. 
I 
think if 7,-e 
all had our wish, sirs, 
The cabinet spooneys we'd dish, sirs. 
And Cook to perfection that Fish, sirs, 
Who apology made in our name. 
The years now will soon be one hundred, 
And what unto us is now left, 
The people they state every day, sirs, 
From every small comfort bereft, 
We've a 
navy whose ships will not sail, sirs, 
We've an army that Congress won't pay, 
We have bankers, oh. no _ ;_in wrong sirs. 
For our bankers they al: ;mil away. 
But in spite of the politicians that rule us, 
Let no nation beside try to fool us, 
Once angry, the world couldn't cool us, 
Nor tread on the tail of our coat.

Music by M. de DONATO. 
AS 
sung by JT.NNIE ENGL. 
Music to be had of G. D. RUSSELL & Co, Boston, Mass. 
'Tis sweet on the sea side to wander 
With the darling who gain'd your first love, 
Or alone o'er his kind words to ponder, 
As with joy you his constancy prove; 
But if pleasure you would be receiving, 
A 
pleasure you would not forget, 
'Tis the greatest of fun I'm believing, 
To waltz witn a 
West Point Cadet. 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet. 
Cflonus. 
As around with a 
feeling entrancing, 
You gaze on your partner with pride; 
You dream of his future, when dancing, 
How to glory he proudly would ride, 
As fondly your waist he is pressing, 
And a 
glance from his bright eye you get, 
You think to yourse:f, what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet; 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet, 
I /-
You see him in fancy preparing 
To march as a 
Warrior co bravt.., 
For his life in the battle not caring, 
That his country's bright banner may wave 
In glory and triumph above him; 
To rout the brave foe he has met ; 
You wake from your dream but to lovo him, 
That noble young West Point Cadet. 
You wake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble West Point Cadet. 
As around, dr,e. 
Some years have passed by since that morning 
When I 
and that loved one did meet, 
But the memory oft is returning, 
How together our young hearts did beat. 
I 
have oft in the dance trod a 
measure, 
But the night I 
shall nevcr forget, 
It is stored in my heart like a 
treasure, 
That waltz wIth the West Point Cadet, 
It is stored in my heart like a

That dance with a

THE YANKEE SHOOTELEERS. 
Dedicated to the gallant " American Rifle Team,"

Brooklyn,

Washington. D. C. 
WE are the pluck little " Team 
Of Yankee Shooteleers, 
Who marched way to Dollymount

We score I

Or nine times out of ten, 
And won a 
Cup of Friendship from 
Warm-hearted Irishmen. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, we're the boys to shoot, 
And never miss the mark; 
We often have, w.th ease, put out 
A 
candle in the dark. 
We've shot with Lord and Duke, 
With nobleman and Prince, 
And some really do believe 
We've been " shot" ever since.

Mark time! left foot! 
St-ady on the right! 
We can beat cr ,ation when the target is in sight. 
Hay foot

We'll give them Yankee Doodle, and hu• rah for " Uncle San0 
From Irish hospitality 
We marched with deep regret, 
For ",Wimbledon," to try out me% 
With England; but, you bet. 
Old Johnny Bull was in no mood 
To give us boys a 
chance; 
Someyears ago a Bunker Hill, 
Our " shots" made Johnny dance. 
Chorus.—Oh, we're, &a. 
It seemed too bad to march away 
Without a 
sin le show, 
So Captain asked for just m e 
turn, 
And promised them to go. 
They picked the best men in the land 
To shoot for Cousin John, 
But next day we for Scotland marched, 
And took the Cup along. 
Chorus. —
01 1, we're, &c.. 
In Scotlaud—so the peo le said— 
We'd learn a 
thing or too; 
They pro .nised, in a 
boasting way, 
To show what " Scots" could do. 
And so they did! 
With might and main 
They tr.ed their very best, 
But that same night their little Cup 
We packed up with the rest. 
Chorus.—Oh, we're, &O. 
And now we're safely horn' again; 
No place like home to me. 
Some think we're looking better since 
We crossed the stormy sea; 
Perhaps we look a 
little dark 
From sunshine on the sand, 
Or, like the " Teams" on t'other side, 
Perhaps we're rather " tannefi"

, 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, at the Opera House. 
And by JENNIE HuoitEs, at the Metropolitan Theatre. 
THERE'S a 
nation of brave people held in bond against their 
will. 
But to them will come a 
day of liberty, 
When to the world they can proclaim their little Emerald 
Isle, 
As added to the nations of the free, 
Our sympathies are with them for Americans 'believe, 
That the laws of God and man, have been profaned. 
When the governed have to suffer and are held in cruel bonds, 
By laws against their interest maintained. 
(Irith Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, a 
flag of liberty, 
All friends of Erin now do drink a 
ruby toast to thee. 
There's a 
nation of brave people from the storied river Rhine, 
Whose emigrants are welcome to our land, 
They are law-abiding citizens, the very last in war, 
And in peace the first to give a 
riendly hand, 
Of Europe's civilization they are the greatest nation, 
I 
hope a 
Republic they'll soim be, 
For they're people that we love, and will like to see them free. 
As those in this great land of liberty. 
(German Fidg.) 
Then here's the flag of Germany, floating proudly free, 
May "Die Waeht am Rhein," be one day sung, in the Halls of 
Liberty. 
Thrre's a 
band of noble patriots by Spanish tyrants ruled, 
Who are fighting to gain their liberty, soon with victory they'll 
be crowned, 
For they've many honest friends in America, the home of the 
free, 
Our flag has been insulted, and we'll show these Spanish dons, 
That the time has now arrived we're not afraid, 
The Virginius and her crew we'll speedily avenge, 
And to poor suffering Cuba lend our aid, 
(Cuban Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, so very dear you are, 
May soon in freedom proudly float, the flag of a 
single star. 
There's a 
country of brave people, 
Who stand head upon the list, 
Of any throughout this mighty world, 
She's a 
refuge for the oppressed. 
From every other land, 
And for freedom her banner is unfurled, 
Our centennial anniversary, we shortly hope to write, 
Upon the immortal scroll of fame, 
In memory of the blessings bequeathed by Washington, 
Then forever revered be his name. 
(American Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of America, the flag of Washington, 
The greatest flag throughout the world, that e'er the sun shown 
on.

Music by Wm. CARTER. 
'Tis well to be up to the mark, my boys, 
Just think of the days gone by, 
When Washington planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on high; 
When Jefferson stood by the land of the free! 
And Lafayette, too, he fought in the field, 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
Cuonus. 
For those men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They hrought sweet sunlight from the dark, 
And made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark. 
And they'll find the North pole before long, my boys, 
Or travel that Northern sea through, 
Or die at their post like brave hail, my boys, 
'Neath the icebergs of cold 82 ; 
We Yankees, 'tis said, through this world, my boys, 
Do know not the meaning of defeat, cr fail; 
Our banner will soon be unfurrd, my boys, 
The future will tell of the tale.

monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen.

for Knave, and numbers 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many or the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters hi relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been pro!onged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Oirds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every-
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The N. Y. Evening Mail writer 
"A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fianna's, 98 Nu-
sau street ca led the ' Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there iii enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, when and 
nohere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the
