Parody on Flower from Mother's Grave. 
Written and sung by PAIM DRESSER. 
I've had a 
toothpick at home that I've had for ninety days, 
The one who gave it does a 
song and dance; 
He wears a 
high silk hat, and carries an actor's ten-cent 
cane, 
You can tell him by the fringe that's on his pants, yes, 
at a 
glance; 
But there's one sweet, little relic that I 
can never forget, 
And the giver has long since slid up the flue; 
Oh, it is not a 
faded flower, nor a 
brandy smash and sour, 
It's a 
bunion that I 
found in father's shoe; yes, it is true. 
CHORUS: 
Treasured in my memory like a 
free lunch route, 
Is this little story. true it's yet; 
But I 
never can forget when he whistled Olivette, 
And the bunion that I 
found in father's shoe, the wind, 
it blew. 
Now I 
thought it would be best to tell you papa went out 
-West, 
The little Indians struck him deaf and dumb; 
Ile was not a 
readjuster, yet he'd go upon a 
buster, 
Get full of sherry cobblers and bad rum just like a 
bum; 
He was formerly a 
sailor, and he sang in Billec Taylor, 
Every word that I 
have spoken friends, is true; 
But be died in Omaha from eating a 
barrel of cold slaw, 
That's where I 
found this little bunion in his shoe; how 
do you do? 
CHORUS: 
Now my story's almost told, yet a 
tale I 
will unfold, 
Of cours ,
!, you wish to know what it's about; 
,is the sanm old shoe that made Senator Platt feel blue, 
It's the; one that kicked old Roscoe conic:ling- 
out, 
BILLY BARRY'S PINAFORE, 
Composed, and sung with great success by the Great 
Billy Barry. 
I 
am the monarch of Limburger cheese, 
When I 
cat, it's go as you please; 
I 
wear piccadilly's and tight-legged pants, 
And so does my sisters, cousins and my aunts. 
Now I 
think that it's awfully mean, 
To treat a 
girl to ice cream, 
When you've only got a 
half- a-dollar in your pants, 
And she invites all her sisters, her cousins and her aunts. 
Henry Ward Beecher is a 
fine plum, 
He says that he never drinks rum, 
But he'll kiss a 
pretty girl when he gets a 
chance, 
And he'll never tell his sisters, cousins or his aunts. 
I 
am a 
pedestrian by trade, 
Seven hundred and fifty miles I've made, 
1'11 make another lap if they'll give me the chance, 
For to sit on my sisters, cousins and aunts, 
MARIE THE TRAMP, 
Written and sung by Billy Barry, with great success 
We sat on Blackwell's Island, Marie, 
It was far better than Sing Sing; 
You remember down at Geoghegan's, Marie, 
We got two year's for stealing a 
watch and ring. 
We sat upon a 
beer keg, Marie, 
A 
policeman our breeches he did fan; 
It was a 
nice June morn in January, Marie, 
We were trying to work the racket with a 
can, 
We sat upon a 
church steeple, Marie, 
Nearly on the verge of ruin; 
We were eating freckled pies, seven miles just from 
the skies, 
And trying to mash the man lives in the moon.

A 
Quiet Little Home. 
Originally sung at Harrigan at Hart's Theatre Comique, Broadway, 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little borne, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you caii 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
4. life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, &c.

Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will be false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will he false, ah, no! no matter what they

No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
.1.nd though far away I 
roam, ah! I 
know there is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
FIt come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying, for you; 
Of all this world so fair I

. 
rooklyn, N. Y. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves—. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well. 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave.

Sung also by M ISS FANNIE BEAN. 
You have all had a 
Rose from my Angel Mother's Grave, 
And a 
Violet that I 
plucked long ago; 
But as years roll on, I 
will never once forget, 
How I 
loved my Angel Mother when alive. 
But there's one request I'll make, just for my mothers sake 
Don't forget it, attend to it I 
crave; 
A.nd when I'm far away, remember what I 
say, 
Plant Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Then remember what I 
say, when I 
am far away, 
And sailing o'er the dark blue sea; 
And God may bless you always, if you'll do as I 
request, 
Plant some Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
We'll put a handsome marble headstone o'er Angel 
Mother's Grave, 
To remind us of the days gone by; 
And we'll have inscribed upon it our Angel Mother, dear, 
With a " Cross and Crown" engraved so bright and 
• clear. 
In the Springtime every year, we will visit that spot so 
dear, 
And ask God to make us strong and brave; 
When wandering from that spot, plant a 
Sweet-Forget-
Me-Not, 
And some Orange Blossoms on Dear Mother's Grave.

I've a 
daughter Clarabel, 
She's a 
rose-bud rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's derby 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Her nose is GrEeco-Roman, 
Her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of sweet Clarabel Magee.

She smashes every swell—Break. 
When she is at a

'Twould break your heart to see, 
How mashers fight to get a 
dance 
With Clarabel Magee. 
Oh! she has lots of beauxs, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a 
wife; 
Says she I

Says I

What happy man will win the hand

POOL. 
—•o:— 
As sung by ANDY COLLOM with great success. 
—:o:— 
I 
am a 
hard working man that's fond of good living, 
I've a 
fair education that's to say I'm no fool; 
Some very hard problems of late I've been solving, 
But I 
can't understand that game they call Pool; 
You pick up your cue and rub it with chalk, 
And you fool around the table like an over-grown galk; 
You first make a 
scratch and that sets you crazy, 
And if you keep it up you get terrible lazy;' 
How you are stuck every game you can never suspect, 
Until you get humpback from carrying checks. 
It costs a 
small fortune when you first learn the game, 
You walk round the table until you get lame; 
There's some that get cross-eyed and others humpbacked, 
And others you will see do a 
contortion act; 
Now there's some sleeps on a 
pool table, 
To play a 
good game he will never be able; 
He is played for a 
sucker always get beat, 
And from walking he is got bunions all over his feet; 
If he takes my advice he'll not be a 
fool, 
And spend all his salary to learn to play- pool.

111 Take You Home Again, Kathleen. 
As sung by W ILL SMITH, with BAIRD'S M INSTRELS, 
I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To whf2re your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
searcely‘ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many times I 
see 
A. dark'ning sit 
our brow. 
WHIST 
I 
WHIST I 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
CHORUS: 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark. 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist; 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get.

Por it's in a 
birdie's cage,

Oh! carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn, 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park, 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street, 
I 
always do give him a

They tell me to go over to England,

Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a

Behind the big man in the band. 
When a

on receipt of 40 cents. 
Copyright, 181'8, by HARRISON MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED A.T1.111, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As 
e 
sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
t-n 
i 
we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
how poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the st as mid the stripes he fought bravely and true 
cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN COLLYEIL 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe ; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nom 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good onc, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the Dootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city strange2—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
re was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried 0 
stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story--common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or it-ter we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg•

Pm a

The fairest and dearest place to me; 
Although small, its the gem little spot on the ocean, 
And how I

There's where you'll find the true sons of Nature, 
All open-hearted, although some be poor; 
It's the land of my birth-place, forget it, no, never, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

Then hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
Where true Irish hearts loved with fondest devotion, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Soon I'll be back to my forefathers' country, 
There's where I 
ever long to roam; 
Where stout Irish lads they are willing and hearts 
To make for their friends a 
pleasant home. 
There's where my father and my poor aged mother 
Have lived, and are happy on Erin's green shore; 
'Tis the land of St. Patrick, forget, I'll never, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a

All the gang will sure be down.

All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there be a

When the gang gets in a 
row; 
none but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will :slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall.

I 
attended here last night, 
It was down to Casey,s at the old Sixth Ward, 
Now it was an eli-gant sight. 
There was singing, yes, and dancing, 
And whiskey there galore, 
And the boys would smile, and the girls put on style, 
As they danced and welted the floor. 
CHORUS. 
Wid me fa-did-ne-ah did-ne-ah oh, 
Wid me thah-sha-shin-go-mis-ka Joe, 
And around on their toes they danc'd just so, 
At Casey's ball last night. 
Oh, we kept the ball a 
rolling, boys, 
Till the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey, swallow'd glass and all, 
With the laughing I 
nearly died. 
Then we all flew for the kitchen, 
Put the turkey out of sight, 
Little Widow Dunn, by the crowd was sung, 
And they kept it up all night.

HORSESHOES. 
Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
But the only ones ' cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
To. do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fingers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everyw here, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luck to 
'ern pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe see, sQ I'll wish you aAis 
good luck,

Can make these Rangers run? 
With our feet of wondrous strength, 
And our head upheld so high,

When us yaller coons go by.

Pass all us warriors bold behind the calcium light, 
Bent low with prizes grabbed, and clutched, and Nvoi, 
Alive with home-made glory,

walked down the street, by chance I 
did meet 
A man who was riding a 
donkey, 
On his back was a 
card offering a 
reward, 
Which sed that he'd lost his monkey. 
Then the crowd, don't you see, gathered round him ana 
And the street then it couldn't be crossed ; 
He pulled out a 
big key, and pointed at me, 
And sez " There's the monkey that's lost." 
I 
sez "Get out you old lump, sure you're off of your chump, 
And look out, for I 
give you fair warning." 
So I 
up wid me stick, and I 
hit him a 
lick, 
I 
sez " I 
landed in town this morning ;" 
He threw a 
rope on the fly, and me neck he did tie; 
The end to the gang then he tossed. 
Then he sez in a 
rage, " lIa.ul him into the cage, 
For he is the monkey that's lost. 
So they pulled me along, yes, forty-five strong, 
Till they got me to the door of the jug.

No doubt you've all heard of the proud Sixty-Ninth, 
The pride of the American army, 
And you'll oft find a 
captain of that gallant corps, 
Whose danger oft-times has alarmed ye. 
Old Ireland thinks well of her brave Sixty- Ninth, 
And to Erin her men are no strangers; 
And are they not christened, in proof of my word, 
" 
The brave Sixty-Ninth Musket Rawer*?"

On Indian territory, or where duty calls, 
' For our country we'd shed blood like water. 
Our courage has never been daunted as yet,

Should foreign invaders come thither our shores, 
Then they'll hear from the bold Musket Rangers.

If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolty good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to u, all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes ate won by sheer pluck 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Sumthrkr 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget mkt?

But one thing troubles me: 
I'm getting thin for want of sleep, 
My head with pain is sore, 
And the cause of all my trouble 
Is the family next door. 
CRORUS: 
They'll drink and smoke, and laugh and joke. 
Like Cannibals they do roar; 
I 
am kept awake the whole night long 
By the family next door. 
They beat their children every day, 
They have them black and blue; 
And when the landlord comes for rent, 
Lord knows they beat him, too. 
They'll turn his pockets inside out 
As he lays upon the floor, 
There the toughest nuts in all the tows, 
Is the family next door.

Oh, my gracious! let me look round, 
I 
look in dis morning's paper lost and found; 
Mr. Levy lost his cornet down at Manhattan Beach 
While trying to eat some sweet oil salad, pickeled eel's 
feet and beets. 
" 
For iy is de reason," said Levy, " the sky overhead is 
clouded?" 
Veil, I 
know me de reason, I 
dink yet dish country mit 
Irish is crowded. 
I 
am a 
poor Hebrew !Jew peddler, I 
once had plenty of 
money and friends, 
Dot was before I 
got wealthy, and lightning struck me 
every two minutes dead. 
I 
went me to sweet Saratoga, to try make my water and 
bread, 
On 1111-tons of coal I 
shoveled till my back was sore and 
asleep, 
And spiders crawled into my whiskers, and huckelberries 
grew on my big feet. 
You dink dat Zubrinski's my cousin, I'm a 
liar, he's a 
reg-
ular son of a 
gun, 
If ever I 
catch him on Good Friday I 
will h 
s_oot him with 
a 
hot cross bun; 
I 
am now going to leave dis country along with my dear 
brother Bill, 
We have made over one hundred and thirty-three dol-
lars by returning the great Stewart's stiff. 
Of my trials I 
could tell you a 
handful, how I 
fight mit 
de boys in de street, 
When they holler out, Solomon Isaacs, take a

and shave off your feet.

Sling with success by ANDY COLLOM. 
In my backyard there dwells a 
cat, 
In my backyard there dwells a 
cat. 
And hi ,1 
nibs is very fat ; 
He watched four years for a 
bob-tail rat, 
He tore in two my high silk hat. 
He s 
lazy, he is crazy, lazy, crazy, 
He is a 
tramp. 
He is hu . ky, is musty, 
His ears they are musty, 
His name is McClusky, 
He is very fond of beer. 
He is a 
snoozer, a 
boozer, 
All night he is a 
cruiser. 
The butchers they are losers, 
Who live both far and near. 
In the daytime be sleeps in the sun, 
In the daytime he sleeps in the sun, 
And you can bet he i
, full of fun; 
teeth is loose from chewing gum, 
his nose is blue from drinking rum. 
He is a 
howler, 
A prowler, and a 
tne-owler, 
Lives on clam chowder, paint and powder, 
He is a 
bum. 
When the stars are beaming, 
This Tomcat is screaming, 
The neighbors they are dreaminz, 
And pull their hair with fright. 
Bootlack.s and pistols, 
Policemen's clubs and missiles, 
Tills cat does always whistle 
As he flies through the air.

Little Cabin Home in South Caroline. 
Written by NRD OLIVER, and sung by J. F. Ftst,ns, 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm glad to see you all; 
I 
was just a 
passing by this way, 
I 
thought I'd give you a 
call, 
To tell you how the darkies 
Used to frolic one and all, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
Don't talk of 'mancipation proclamation unto me; 
I 
was happier in slavery then I've been since I've been free. 
Oh ! we war so jolly, we war as happy as could be 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
Cmotus. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow,, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which I'll have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline.

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grow& 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
Bubdrinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat A 
got a 
temper which don't last very long. 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of year. 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same.

Wenches on Our Block. 
Written by BOB BRIMMER. Sung by PETTIT and WHITE in the principal 
Variety Theatres in the Canary Islands. 
If you want for information, just list to what I 
say, 
And I'll tell all about the wenches up our way. 
They're dirty and they're greasy, each face would stop a 
clock, 
There ne'er was such a 
terrible gang as the wenches on our block 
There's dirty Lize, big-foot Sal, and cross-eyed Sarah Jane; 
There's bow-legged Sue and pug-nose Loo, and some without 
a 
name. 
They'll cut you with a 
razor, they'll hit you with a 
rock— 
And that's the way the wenches fight a 
living on our block, 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Snodgrass, playing in the mud, 
When they want to wash her they throw her in a 
tub. 
They throw her on a 
line to dry, and wipe her with a 
frock, 
That,s what you'll see the wenches do a 
living on our block. 
They stand upon the corner und fight about their beaux, 
They always have a 
big black eye or else a 
broken nose. 
They work and get a 
dollar a 
day, and hide it in their sock, 
And that's the way the wenches act a 
living on our block. 
When they fight they will bite, and gouge out your eye, 
And they'll cut and they'll but, and fight till they die. 
They drink coal oil and alcohol, or anything that's hot, 
And now you know a 
thing or two of the wenches on ow 
block.

Of the Great men of Ireland, I've often sung, 
And boasted her soldiers in war; 
But I'll now change the subject, and raise here to-night, 
The warrior born true Irish Tar; 
No nation in this world more sturdier Jacks 
Ever had than the boys from our land; 
For in foul or in fair, when wanted they're there, 
At their post, boys, they ever will litand. 
Oetoetre: 
Able and willing to do and die, 
Ever there when wanted, never known to fly; 
To uphold their Country's honor against the world 
you may rely, 
Will the Warrior born Sons of Erin. 
Though blue are the clothes in which I 
now dress, 
The green shamrock's dearest to me; 
And the man too must light, who before me dare slight., 
That dear little Isle in the sea; 
'Tis the land I 
was born in, and though far away, 
If on me she ever should call; 
For my Country's good in warfare I 
should. 
Be prepared lads to conquer or fall. 
(Chorus). 
The old Union Jack knows an Irishman's worth, 
For he's oft proved her best friend at sea; 
While the brave stars and stripes, gladly gives him a 
birth, 
And a 
home in the land of the free; 
There's Irish descent in the Fleet of proud France, 
In fact I 
should like to know where 
Is the Country can show better seamen than Pat. 
Or whose Sons (gin do more than we dare,

WHAT I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO.

E. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
If you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as'it moves round, none of us can tell, 
How soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, when too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Chorus—So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
If your wealthy why stretch out your band to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-off and great 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old; 
Had they but their time to live over again, 
They freely would give up their gold. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard. 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in hen ." 
And with it don't know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin. 
His family from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on. 
debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. 
Clurrits 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er, 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If to- day you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're cosey and warm and not out in the storm, 
And you see a 
friend raked and bare; _ 
Oh ne'er let him pass by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give hira a

Water on the Brain. 
Comeosed by PETE CANNON, and presented to J. F. FiELDS. 
I've always been a 
drinker, 
Since the day that I 
was born ; 
I 
never could resist it, 
Though it caused me much pain. 
My head is swelling lately, 
And I'm broken up completely, 
And all my friends imagine 
I 
have water on the brain. 
[Repeat last two lines. 
I 
went into a 
porter house 
To get a 
glass of porter, 
When a 
man came up to stab me, 
And I 
thought he was insane; 
He made at me some frightful blows, 
I 
knocked them off and broke his nose, 
Oh, to see me fight you'd not suppose 
I 
had water on the brain. 
[Repeat last two lines. 
My wife is home and in her bed, 
And sleeping very quietly, 
She says that I'm a 
drunken brute 
And that I

She calls me a

And a

Says it's whiskey, and not water, that 
I've got upon my brain.

PATSY KELLY'S BEAU. 
Parody ••n" Mary Kelly's Beau," as sung by lie.r.rn.o-As 
Haul esof 
the TnEATRE COMIQUE. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
Little Patsy Kelly, 
A 
dandy very small; 
Sells evening papers, 
On the Bowery for a 
Batt, 
The gang upon the corner, 
Nct many days ago; 
Introduced me ye's can 
As Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Dandy Patsy Kelly, a 
Handy Andy lad, 
When I'm strolling with him the mashers get it bady 
-Its naughty, but nicey, I'm still a 
friend to you, 
Go tell it to your Fairies, I 
am Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
He lives in Mulligan's building, 
Just up nine flights of stairs; 
He keeps his Father and Mother, 
And Silks and Satins wears. 
Be takes care of his Brother, 
His Sister to Jail did go; 
Oh swell the story all around, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Down around the bloody Fourth, 
He's a 
Politician tart; 
And after Election day, 
To Congress he will start. 
I 
live upon 5th Avenue, 
Wear a 
Gold Ring on my toe; 
The spellers tells the Daisies, 
I'm Pat 
ey Kelly's Beau.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great maces* by 
M URPHY RIld MAGIC. 
Only To See Thee, Darling. 
As sung by W. 
J. Sastmov. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Vainly I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart, 
Longing once more to see thee, 
Once more before we part. 
Cuortus. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
CHAP•at.) 
Gone is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy so bright, 
Now every gleam hath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas I 
I 
knew thee, 
Ah I 
could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
7,a that sad word, farewell. 
(Oksrem.) 
osi1P
-." 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
' SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout. 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
Pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN— Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw t Bt abcrvit All they wildly ask— 
. 
What is it, Ike, 
Composed and sung by ANDY COLLOM with the Lx.i.virr's TROVPS 
• 
Oh, you talk about your travels and something good to eat. 
Of all the bum hash houses there is ono on Clark street; 
The bill would set you loony, and paralyze your feet. 
Your tongue it would go crazy and fall out in the street. 
Roosters' spurs in jelly, Bull fro_gs' toes in wine, 
Elephants' tonr
o,mes in sawdust, Tom cats baked in lime; 
Oysters stuffed- 
with monkeys, fried in powdered steel, 
I'd rather be a 
young girl's pet than tackle such a 
meal. 
Second-handed hash house, old galvanized beds, 
Electric tallow candles burning overhead; 
Mosquitos chasing with a 
lively flea, 
Dancing in the Pinafore and singing let me be. 
Oh, the next day came on Sunday, everything looked neat, 
We had parrot soup with chilblains, of course that was a 
treat; 
Duck tail roast with bull dogs, elephant's ears on toast, 
Indian-rubber doughnuts, of course there was a 
dose; 
There was freckle-headed lobsters, and salivated clams, 
Magnesia, horse tongue, all done up in a 
jam; 
The boarders all got moon struck, like pigs they all did 
squeal, 
A.nd fired the cook out in the street for cooking such a 
meal. 
Old galvanic butter, frozen reed birds' ears, 
Water baked in dish pans too dirty to appear; 
Bloated apple dumplings, fly's wings mixed with fleas, 
It's the wickedest house I 
ever struck, it gave us all the 
heaves, 
Words and Music by 3. L. FEENEY. Copyrighted, 1880, by 
B. W. IhTencocs, 166 Nassau Street. Sung by 
MISS KITTY COLEMAN. 
I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I 
often think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm longin!, 
to see; 
There's a sighing in my heart which kcep 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
CUORUS: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
flow happy then I 
will be; 
When I'm welcomed back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
Whe4 I 
used t;) play on the green; 
How oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A wander no longer I'll be; 
Yor my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me,

MeCORMICK14 MULE 
Written by .141.nrs Iticstitoitn. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great SUOMI. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule: 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politician; 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

FILIMPTY DRIPPY 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
Ft is a 
Fa° simile of a Trick practiced by cat. 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordei 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DITUPTY.,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a. practiced manipulator, taking if 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap• 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand..
