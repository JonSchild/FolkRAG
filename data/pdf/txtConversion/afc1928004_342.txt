Englishman, Scotchman, and Irishman. 
As sung by Thomas wiNNE•rr. 
An Englishman, Scotcliman and Irishman 1‘ eve sentenced to death 
for stealing sheep, and his Honor the Judge informed them he would 
be very lenient with them, and give them their choice of dying, that is 
they could die according to their own nationality. So the first 
to 
take the Door was the ENGLISH mAN, who sang as follows: 
Let me die on the oak, 
The brave old oak, 
That stands in the greenwood lawn, 
Let me die on the oak, 
The dear old oak. 
With its hundred of arms so strong, 
The next was the SCOTCIIMAN who sang as follows: 
The moon's on the lake, 
And the mist on the g'en 
And the glen that was known 
That is nameless by day, 
If their robbers by night, 
And pursue us with beagles, 
give the flood to the rocks, 
And the flesh to the sea-gulls. 
Then Iloilo 
hollo! hollo I 
Then Iloilo ! hollo ! Iloilo! 
While there's rope in old Scotland, 
And a 
tree by the river, 
It's there let me die Judge, 
And hang there forever. 
Third and last was the IRISHMAN, who sang as follows: 
There's the Englishman and Scotchman 
As you plainly see, 
have their own way of dying 
And that you'll agree, 
But I 
would be hullg to a 
gooseberry tree, 
Before the dayligEt in the morning. 
But a 
goosebery tree says the judge is too low 
To hang a 
man on it and that you all know, 
Then Pat gave a 
wink to the Jury below, 
Saying, I'm in no hurry, 
Paith, I'll wait till she grows. 
(And the tree never grew.) : 
Written and sung by the W INNETTS, in their own great musical 
sketch entitled Love in Broken German. 
Oh ve're going to got married, 
Dhere'll be a

Irish Duett and Dance. 
Sung by THOMAS AND LOTTA 
W INNETT, at the principle Vaudeville 
Theatres of America. 
We're a 
happy Irish pair YOU see, 
And we lately came from dear old Tipperary ; 
Where the Irish boys are happy as can be, 
And the Coleens fair yolfil never find contrary; 
We can sing and dance the whole day long, 
Our hearts are ever gay; 
And when you see our movements. 
I 
am sure you all will say, 
That no other style that's in the land, 
Outrivals that of Mike and Kate O'Leary; 
We've lately come across the sear 
From that dear old spot they call it Tipperary. 
[Dance, regular Irish Breakdown.] 
When we landed upon Columbia's shores, 
Among the boys we caused a 
great sensation ; 
For as we said to you before, 
We're the happiest Irish that's in the nation ; 
Whether here or there, it's all the same, 
No matter where we go, 
Our movements seems to please you, 
When we twist our heel ana toe; 
We ask of you your kind applause, 
'Twill help to make our hearts feel light and airy, 
And we'll finish with a 
little dance, 
And show you how it's done in Tipperary. 
[Same dance as before.]

That's What Gives You Away, 
Copyright secured, 176. by A. J. 
FISHER. 
Written by HAREY FENNE-rr. 
Sung with great applause 
by PAT ROONEY. 
When I 
landed in America. I 
settled in New York, 
And wandered up and down the streets a 
trying to get work, 
But eveiy place that I'd inquire. oh this is what they'd say, 
For heaven's sake take that dicer off, for that is what gives 
you away. 
CHORCS. 
Go where I 
may, roam where I 
will, 
The blackguards they do say— 
Oh ! Take that dicer out of the draft, 
For that is what gives you away. 
I 
walked the streets from morn 'till night, my heart was 
sore distressed ; 
And whin I'd ask for wcy k they'd say, oh, go, pull down 
your vest ! [ key pray ; 
They said go on to the platform and with Moody and San - 
And get those peg- tops taken in. for that is what gives you 
away. 
Go where I 
may, &c. 
I 
went into an eating-house to get a 
bit of bread, 
he waiter called me Jimmy Lush and put me on my head. 
I 
axed the Mayor for a 
job and to me he did say— 
You'd better get another face, for that one gives you away. 
(
-norms. 
They say, hay., you time to carry a 
trunk ? 
How lon;:, are you going to stay ? 
And get those side-hoards taken off. quick, 
For that is what gives you away. 
RATHER TOO OLD FOR ME. 
As Sung by THE BroccrAlts 
I'm one of those very unfortunate men 
You read ot. and sometimes oehold, 
No matter how careful I 
am, now and then 
I 
feel certain I'm sure to be sold.: 
For I'm always meeting with people who try 
To ease me of what I 
possess. 
Which they very soon do, though I've got a 
sharp eye, 
And so I'm compelled to confess,—that 
CHORUS. 
They're a 
little too old for me, 
Rather too old for me; 
Though youthful in years, to me it appears, 
They're a 
little too old for me. 
If ever I 
go to the races, I'm sure 
To come home with tar less than I 
start , 
For even if I 
back the horse that has won, 
I 
can't get the fellows to part. 
In fact, I'm wehiled when I 
fancy I'm right, 
And sharpers get off with my pelf; 
So, when I 
return home a 
skinner, at night, 
I'm forced to admit to myself,---- that 
They're a 
little, Re, 
I'm a 
pretty good player at billiards, I'm told, 
I 
can handle the cards pretty wed. 
Fut I'm bound to be done if I 
play for much gold, 
The reason I 
really can t 
tell. 
Bat, perhaps, just a 
game or two I 
may win, 
mat is if the stakes are but small ; 
But when, at the finish, I 
lose all ,ny tin, 
I'm forced to admit, after all,—that 
They're a 
little, &c. 
With the fair sex I'm no better off, I 
declare, 
I 
can't get on that way at all— 
Except the girl turns out more ugly than fair— 
Or her fortune 'tis wretchedly small 
Though the wealthy and gay are awfully fond 
Of flirting, just in a 
mild way; 
But as for the ladies going beyond, 
From experience I'm bound to say. —that 
I 
bey're a 
little, &c.

On the shores of the Isle of the Sea. -

Lay panting and bleeding alone, 
Ere the brave hearts had rallied around our dear land, 
And had offer'd their blood to atone. 
And the Angel of love, looking down from above, 
Dropped tears on the blue ocean cold, 
And plashing that flag, they enfigured each star 
On this " banner a

That Dan McGowan and Mary Maloye, 
In wedlock were united: 
And as they had borne cash on hand, 
Says Dan, our wedding will be grand; 
More power

Music playibg, whiskey flying, 
Boys and girls with love a

Children in the corners crying— 
At McGowan's wedding. 
Some were playing forty-fives--
More of them were shaking dice--
And the girls were making pies ; 
The bride was telling stories. 
Some e

And boys a

More were eating Pig's crubeens; 
Sure all were in their glory.

That was the time that things got hot!

UNDER THE ROSE BUSH, 
Sting with great success by MISS CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WHEN eighteen years old, and just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A. gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying- his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose- bush full burdened with bloom 
So kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose- bush, 
He asked me to kiss him. I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May- bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright-rose bush full burdened with bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
it seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush. tte. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet may romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we n: 
prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose-busn, full burdened with bloom, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Ned for a 
happy bridegroom. ,

Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
I'v(, only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
_I kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark ; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor. 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, 
c. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-plece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile.

assure her once more, a-:

A

While riding on a

lie had his little boy with him, 
Which caused us both great pain.

When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on my journey down ; 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch— 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
Th widower loved romantic scenes, 
And 
squeeze on the sly; 
So when hisI rm went round my waist, 
Tlit boy began to cry.

To watch the passing triti.i ; 
But no, he said, Papa you'll kiss

And he was not himself; 
For who could make love on a

In front of that young elf.

I 
met my love at twilight, 
Where the Royal Roses beam! 
She spoke of love, below and above,

Her blue eyes so full of pride, 
The prettiest I

Invited so sweet, in Paradise to meet, 
Affectionate Amy Lee!

Increasing love each time we meet; 
Sweetest girl I

Is affectionate Amy Lee ! 
When the birds they are all singing, 
Her rosy cheeks do blush; 
With her blue eyes and cunning, shy, 
She seems to say oh hush! 
Her wealth of Ringlets flowing!

Like Cupid's dart she won my heart, 
This girl with an Angel face.

Courting Cards. — This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want Lequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-cornmittaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, e 
hien might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The N. Y. Evening 1Iai1 writes . 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street ca led the 4Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when. and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting!" 
The N. Y.. Eeening Telegram writes " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do net hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
