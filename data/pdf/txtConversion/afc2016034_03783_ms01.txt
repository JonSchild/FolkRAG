During the oil boom, there were only two domestic violence or sexual violence shelters in 
the Bakken area of western North Dakota; AARC got many calls from trafficking victims and 
still do, but not as many; 
Flow homelessness is different from violence specific homelessness; can be more 
complicated as trauma is an additional layer and finding a house will not fix the other issues 
that come with being victimized; addiction services and mental health services are not 
readily available in the Bismarck area; some victims have not been allowed to make

to volunteer as part of her degree and met Diane at a friend's house; Diane told her to come 
to AARC; Michelle intended to work in probation or parole;

and she worried about the victim and knew she had to learn to separate work form personal

seven times before finally breaking free; success stories balance out the challenging work; 
story of a woman who was recovering well and then got involved with a problematic 
individual; 
Emergency Shelter stay doesn't have a time limit, depends on space and on the women; 
Funding streams dictate some things such as target numbers; Michelle manages the work
