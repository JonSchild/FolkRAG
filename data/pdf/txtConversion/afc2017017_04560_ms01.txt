KS: Okay, so this is Kim Stryker, and today is Monday, February... 
 
TW: It is a... Yes, yes, yes, Super Bowl. 
 
KS: So today is January-February, 5th 2018, and I'm sitting here in a conference room of 
the AHS, Jr. Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Winchester, Virginia with 
with Dr. Tony K. Wolf. [pause] Okay so, we'll start talking, if you wanna just tell me a 
little bit about what it is that you do. 
 
[00:41]   
TW: Sure, well, welcome Kim. We're pleased to have you visit us today. I'm a... 
Viticulturist... 
My title is professor of Viticulture with Virginia Tech. A viticulturist as somebody who 
studies the science of grape growing, and I have done this since graduate school, so I've 
been with Virginia Tech a number of years, and specifically I have a... A research and 
extension component of my job. The research has to do with solving problems that affect 
our industry here. The extension is the educational part of the mission. I am associated 
with a land-grant institution and as such, we have research, extension, and instruction as 
part of our tripartite mission. So we do, principally do two of the things here, the research 
and the extension part. I also do have an instructional role though too, in that I teach an 
online viticulture course Fall semesters to undergraduates, principally at Virginia Tech. 
 
Okay, actually this came up in another interview. That part of the problem, some 
winemakers and vineyard owners were saying is that it's even though you have a lot of 
young people that have maybe some background in agriculture coming up here in more 
rural areas of Virginia, that by the time to go to college, maybe they're already thinking: I 
wanna go a different direction. And there's some interest in how do we educate and bring 
people into it. Maybe even earlier. 
 
So that's something... So in fall semester for undergrad, they're still quite young and. 
[02:39] ____... 
 
TW: Well we, in the last two years, we've implemented a viticulture minor within the 
horticulture program at Virginia Tech, and I capture anywhere from about 22 to 25 
Winery Workers in Virginia

2 
students each fall when I teach that course. Of those, probably only two, maybe three will 
go on and do something within the fruit industry in a general sense, and whether it's 
specifically within grapes or wine remains to be seen. 
 
So yeah, there's probably more money to be made in other areas of horticulture, the so-
called "green industry", which has to do with ornamentals, turf industry, for example, 
those are generally somewhat higher paying jobs and what one might find, unless they 
have to own their own vineyard and the winery as a business. So we don't get a lot of 
people, but those that we do in the course are usually pretty interested in the subject, at 
least as an undergraduate course. 
 
KS: Are they generally like the traditional undergraduate students as well, or they 
sometimes the older coming in or... 
 
TW: They're typically undergraduate students. It's a fairly expensive course to take -as 
collegiate courses are. So if you're already enrolled as a full-time student it's cheaper to 
take another three credits under that umbrella than it would be for somebody like you or 
me who's outside the university community coming in and taking it would be close to 
$2000 to take the course. 
 
KS: Ouch! 
 
TW: And there are probably better courses that are more comprehensive that are 
associated with certificates, for example, that you can be able to train somebody in the 
same way. So this course is more in the theory, but also practices less on the hands-on 
type of thing, because I'm three and a half hours from campus, it's all online taught, so it's 
little difficult to do an instructional workshop or something like that. 
 
KS: Right, right, get everyone to meet in the same field at the same time! 
 
TW: We shouldn't dwell too much on the instructional role because it is really... 
 
KS: A small part. 
 
TW: Yeah, it is the research and extension activities of what I do is really the bigger part 
of my job. 
 
KS: Okay, so um. Research and problems of your industry. Going back to that, some of 
the problems I would assume or things like pests and funguses and things that attack the 
actual plants. So probably one of the biggest problems people face. 
 
So what types of things, especially in the context of growing in Virginia, do you find... 
 
[00:05:20] 
 
TW: Yeah, you're correct. The pest management, the disease management in particular, 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

is... On a year in year out basis, probably the most challenging thing that growers will 
face. And you'll speak with our Dr. Miznho Nita a little bit later about the disease issues. 
We also have in the general area of pest management, we also have invasive insect 
problems. We've just learned since the beginning of this year of a new invasive insect 
pest here in Virginia now: Spotted lantern fly, which is like brown marmorated stinkbug 
is a indigenous to China. Where it originated. And it has recently been found in the US 
within the last few years in Pennsylvania, we've now found it in Virginia within the last 
two months. And so, grape growers are gonna have to deal with that in the future. 
 
[00:06:16] 
 
But on the viticulture side, if we look at just the cultural things that I've been involved 
with over the years, if we go back to my original hire in the mid-80s, the thing that the 
industry needed most at that time [that I felt it needed most] was an appraisal of which 
varieties do well in our environment here. We had a number of wine grape varieties that 
were being grown, some of which we still grow because they were good choices, they do 
well, they reasonably well-adapted. Things like Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, for 
example, continue to be mainstays of our industry. 
 
We had other varieties, some that were more suited to a more northern climate. Things 
like Riesling or example which we still grow some of... But not very much, so early on, I 
decided that variety planning would be in order and something that would serve the 
industry very well in terms of trying to decide or come up with answers to which varieties 
would do well here that hadn't been widely tested yet. 
 
KS: And maybe make it easier on people as well... 
 
[00:07:24] 
 
TW: I mean, well, it's cheaper for us, if you think about it this way, it's expensive to put 
in an acre or two acres of a variety. We're looking at 15 or more thousand dollars, to 
establish an acre of grapes in the state. If you make the wrong choice on a variety, that's a 
large investment that it's gonna take you a long time to recoup, and... If you have the 
wrong variety, you may never recoup your investment with it. 
 
KS: Yeah. 
 
[00:07:48] 
 
TW: So you have to make a good choice on that. 
 
We can do the testing under controlled conditions, of course, the testing is most 
representative of the site at which they're growing. So if we grow these varieties in 
Northern Virginia, or here in the Northern Shenandoah Valley, the responses that we 
came up with in the performance of the varieties is gonna be most indicative to this 
particular area, but we can translate to an extent, we can translate to other parts of the 
Winery Workers in Virginia

state as well. 
 
[00:08:20] 
 
At the same time, we were doing the variety evaluations though, there was a need to help 
more new growers, existing growers pretty much had already decided where they're 
gonna plant their grapes and their grow their grape vines, but new growers were asking 
questions about what constitutes a good site to grow grapes at. 
 
What is a good vineyard site? And... 
 
it does vary a little bit depending on where you are in the state. But we had a fairly 
extensive program that took existing information and experience from growers, and we 
put that into a format that other potential growers could use to help make those decisions 
about whether they had sites that were suitable or not from a climate standpoint or 
climatic standpoint from a soil standpoint, from a pest management standpoint, all of 
those things impinge on that decision. Is this a good site, or not? We also worked with 
economists, Farm Business Management Agents, extension agents that could help us 
come up with a budget to explain to people what it would cost to put in a vineyard and 
what their potential returns would be from the vineyard. 
 
Grape growing itself is fairly expensive in Virginia. 
 
The returns for grape growing, per se, are fairly shallow compared to the returns, for 
example, on wine making. 
 
So, the reason we have so many wineries in the state, it says so many of our grape 
growers have found that grape growing is fine, but making wine and selling wine is even 
better. From an economic standpoint. The other things that we've been involved with over 
the years with the research working collaboratively with our wine-making colleagues on 
the main campus, we've been able to make recommendations on how we manage the 
grape vines. Canopy management is a broad area, it's really defined as how you 
manipulate the foliage, the shoots of the vine during the growing season, there's a 
tremendous amount of labor involved in doing that. Some of it can be mechanized, but 
there's still a lot of that is done manually. And some of our work was really aimed at how 
much fruit exposure do you need, for example, how much... What kind of shoot density 
do you want, what kind of cropping level do you want on vines to optimize the quality... 
Of the wine quality potential? 
 
[00:10:40] 
 
All of those things have really fundamental questions that growers are asking, and we 
have an opportunity through our research and through graduate students, the people that 
help us do this research to address those questions. 
 
KS: So let me break down a little bit of that to lay people language, so literally what 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
 
5 
you're talking about in canopy management is like how much sun, and air circulation are 
getting to the fruit, and there's different techniques for how you prune, the vines and how 
they go out on the trellis, which clusters, you would let develop and which ones you 
would pair off. 
 
TW: Yep, yeah. 
 
KS: Okay, yeah, and I know one of the growers was showing me different pruning 
techniques, a lot of them, and I find this with orchardists as well, they won't let anyone 
else prune because they don't trust that they're gonna prune it right. 
 
TW: Uh huh. 
 
KS: And so the idea of mechanized pruning and stuff, I think many of these small 
growers just even though it's so much work, they wouldn't trust that. Or... 
 
TW: Well, I think some of the small ones might trust it if they could afford it. The bigger 
issue is the machinery to do some of these things is fairly expensive and things like 
dormant pruning can be mechanized to an extent and it IS mechanized, you can do rough 
pruning with a piece of machinery and then do follow-up pruning, which is much more 
rapid after the mechanized part that comes through. So many of our larger growers were 
using the combination of the machinery and hand pruning. 
 
KS: Fine turning. 
 
TW: Exactly, yeah, because you don't wanna leave too many buds on the vine, you'll get 
too much fruit in following year. So there is some judgment involved in doing the 
pruning that our best grape growers and vineyard managers really do wanna do that fine 
tuning, sure. 
 
[00:12:42] 
 
KS: Yeah, we were talking about -before I interrupted- was how you were compiling 
through research and with graduate students and different people being able to create 
guidelines for people to say like, Okay, usually in most cases, the best thing to do, best 
courses of action for pruning and managing the vine and treating and all that. 
 
TW: Yeah, that's a good way of putting it there. There's a term called "best management 
practices", which is often used to describe in a very broad sense, what the consensus of 
ideas would be on how grape vines should be managed, how do they should be grown at 
a particular location? That's not to say everybody should do it that way. 
 
KS: Right. 
 
TW: There's a lot of fine tuning, again, and things like crop management. Some wine 
makers are very, uh... They're very set or they have their very specific ways of cropping 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
 
6 
vines to meet the standards that THEY want for the wine quality that they're choosing to 
make the difference between a $50 bottle of wine and $20 bottle of wine has a lot to do 
with the management that goes into those vines as well. 
 
[00:14:04] 
 
In most most cases. We're growing grapes in a very challenging environment here, 
compared to some areas of the world that have a more constant weather conditions, or 
climate particularly during the fruit ripening phase of the season... 
 
Our summers can be pogo sticks. 
 
TW: Well our summers can be, but it's really the most important part of the season in 
terms of wine quality potential is probably gonna be the last 45 days before harvest. 
 
KS: Oh really? 
 
TW: Yeah. 
 
And so much can happen then, you can have a beautiful season. 2011 was an example of 
this. 
 
You have a beautiful season up through the middle of August, and then you have a series 
of hurricanes or tropical storms come through and everything that you've done up to that 
point, then becomes vulnerable and is often compromised by the amount of rainfall that 
you have after that. 
 
KS: Right. 
 
[00:15:03] 
 
TW: So the best management takes that into consideration. And grape vines are 
somewhat resilient, but there's still a lot at stake. It's not really any different from any 
other fruit, but... But grape vines and grape berries themselves, they're subject to those 
problems with climatic situation, so doing the best... You know, growers try to do the best 
they can in terms of the vineyard management. But there's a lot that is beyond their 
control too, with the weather that we have here. 
 
KS: Right. Yeah, I know with tree fruit growers, it's more the Spring where you have the 
freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw cycles. 
 
That's what they really get hysterical because that can determine their whole season even 
before the sun's come out and you have any fruit on the trees. 
 
TW: Yup. 
 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
 
7 
KS: Is it as much of an issue for... 
 
TW: It is it is, it's probably not as great a. 
 
problem as with say, stone fruit producers, cherry and peach producers, for example, 
because those crops are blooming so early. And those blooms, of course, are the 
beginning of the fruit that'll be produced. Grapevines -for the most part with the varieties 
we grow- they tend to break bud, that is they start that Spring growth a little bit later in 
the Spring, maybe two weeks later than peaches are blooming -something along those 
lines. We still have problems in some locations. So with Spring frost, I like to tell... 
 
[00:16:40] 
 
I mentioned the first 45 or the last 45 days of the season being -probably the most 
important from a wine quality standpoint, the first 30 or 45 days of the season though, 
were most important from a crop quantity standpoint. 
 
KS: Oh okay. 
 
TW: So, yes, if you have a Spring frost, you can lose 80 or 90% of your crop right at the 
beginning of the season, and there's no way you can really put it back on at that point. 
 
KS: [laughter] Right. It does not. You can't just tack it back up there! 
 
TW: Yeah, fortunately they're perennial plants and the following year might be better. 
 
And that's part of the reason why growers will grow different varieties. You don't put all 
of your risk into one variety, but rather spread it out over maybe several varieties. 
 
KS: Right. 
 
Just so you know, what I'm doing now, I'm making time stamps. 
 
TW: Yeah I know, you're writing notes. 
 
KS: I'm not drawing pictures of you or anything! 
 
Okay, so we're looking at the two danger zones are really that late season where you 
might get the hurricane, the rain, the winds that could damage the beautiful ready-to-go 
fruit or the early season in bud zone. And then what is unique with Virginia, what are 
some, the Virginia aspects that bring to bear? Obviously, we're not like California in our 
climate, but what are the different things that present challenges in Virginia especially? 
 
[00:18:12] 
 
TW: Well, so you've already stated when you say different. Most people will compare us 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
 
8 
to the major grape growing areas of the US, and those are on the West Coast, California, 
Oregon, and Washington State are top three wine-producing states. Most of the grapes 
grown in those three states are grown in a more arid environment where rainfall 
accumulations during the growing season may be 10 inches or less. Here with a regular 
general rainfall pattern per month. We're seeing three to five inches of rainfall per month. 
So for growing season, we might have closer to 25 or 30 inches of rainfall, just during the 
growing season. That rainfall and the relative humidity that we have here... Do increase 
the risk of diseases of grapes, fungal diseases, primarily. And again, Dr. Nita, can go into 
more detail about that, but that is from a unique standpoint, that is one of the features that 
we have to deal with. 
We're not really different from New York State or the other states around the 
Great Lakes that have historically grown grapes for a number of years. Of course, the 
New York industry is a very diverse industry, includes wine grapes that are common to 
what we grow here- the Vinifera wine grapes, but all of the states around the Great Lakes 
region also grow juice type grapes like Niagara and Concord. They are generally a little 
more resistant to some of the diseases than the wine grapes that we grow. 
 
KS: Oh okay. 
 
TW: So there's a difference there. They've been doing it for years, and they have pretty 
good systems in place for disease management. Again, it's not that they're immune, but 
they're just a little bit more tolerant to some of those diseases than we are. The other thing 
that the rainfall does is it stimulates vegetative growth of the grape vines. So rather than 
having vines that…
