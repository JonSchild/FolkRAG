SPEAKERS
Jill Allen, Jared Schmidt
Jared Schmidt 00:01
All right. This is Jared Schmidt with Jill Allen. It is Wednesday, March 30, 2022. We are doing this
interview via Microsoft Teams. Before we begin, Jill, I just want to make sure I have your
consent to record this interview.
Jill Allen 00:19
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 00:20
Great. How are you doing today?
Jill Allen 00:22
Excellent. Thank you.
Jared Schmidt 00:24
Good. Uh, Jill, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself a little bit, like what
year you were born, where you're from, and maybe some of your educational/work background.
Jill Allen 00:34
Excellent. I am Jill Allen. I was born in Tillamook, Oregon, Tillamook County. I have been with
Tillamook as my full time career, uh, 21-plus-years . And I state that, because, when I was in
high school, I scooped ice cream. I was a Tillamook County Dairy Princess. I worked in the
J
J
J
high school, I scooped ice cream. I was a Tillamook County Dairy Princess. I worked in the
visitor center greeting people. I went to Oregon State and I did an internship in accounting, and
I hated it. Hated it. So, that's, you know, a little bit. We can deep dive into any of that. So, I've
probably been at Tillamook, you know...I mean, I'm 42, born in 1979, so, I don't know, 30,
almost, I mean, 28 years, probably somewhere around there, with Tillamook, off and on.
Jared Schmidt 01:28
Really?
Jill Allen 01:30
Yep.
Jared Schmidt 01:31
That's cool. So, wait, so you said you scooped ice cream at the Creamery?
Jill Allen 01:36
I did. So my very, well actually my very first, my very first job was many, many years ago was
as a little kid picking green beans for Bear Creek Artichokes in Sand Lake, where I lived. That's
another little story, but...My first job at the Tillamook County Creamery Association was
scooping ice cream in the visitor center.
Jared Schmidt 01:58
Okay.
Jill Allen 02:00
And I've been involved in the dairy industry in many different facets. I milked cows for a couple
of dairy farmers through high school here in Tillamook County as well. So, I have quite a bit of
knowledge throughout the whole industry.
Jared Schmidt 02:15
Did you grow up on a dairy farm, then, Jill, or?
Jill Allen 02:18
Um, well, I grew up on a dairy farm but we, my parents didn't operate it. They had just leased
out the land and somebody had, was farming, dairy farming on, but we were not dairy farmers.
J
J
J
J
out the land and somebody had, was farming, dairy farming on, but we were not dairy farmers.
Jared Schmidt 02:30
Okay. What, what what did your parents do for work if I may ask?
Jill Allen 02:34
Yeah, so my mother was a teacher, an elementary teacher and my father was a captain for
American Presidents lines when he retired for...bringing goods you know, the maritime, what do
you call that? It just slipped my mind. But anyways, you're bringing goods across back and forth
between different countries. So...
Jared Schmidt 03:00
That's cool. So, you definitely you grew up as a Cheesemaker to become a cheesemaker than if
you went to the school here in Tillamook, right?
Jill Allen 03:07
I did! I was a Tillamook High School Cheesemaker. And two of my sons are, currently, and my
daughter will be next year. So they are the Cheesemakers, so yes. And then I graduated from
Tillamook High School as well. [Redacted]...Through and through, very active in the dairy
community.
Jared Schmidt 03:42
Okay, so there's, your family's still, your, your children are still active and...
Jill Allen 03:46
Still [ILL] still Yes.
Jared Schmidt 03:48
Okay.
Jill Allen 03:49
But I support the, I support the whole industry and...
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 03:52
Nice. You mentioned a minute ago that you were a dairy princess?
Jill Allen 03:56
Yes. So, 1997, I was the Tillamook County Dairy Princess. So I learned how to do the princess
wave [Laughs] So, going to grade schools, teaching about the dairy industry, dairy products,
dairy farmers, going to county fairs, state fairs, going to agriculture events, representing
Tillamook County's dairy industry. The Oregon Dairy Women's Association sponsors the dairy
princesses, so I did that for a year.
Jared Schmidt 04:32
That's super cool. And
Jill Allen 04:34
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 04:35
you got the crown and everything.
Jill Allen 04:37
I did, I did. I got the crown and it was, the year I ran for this, the dairy princess, it was, there
was a lot of competition. And it was just something that you got to meet so many different
people and you had even the other ladies that ran for the title still, throughout the year
participated in helping, you know, educate the communities around us about the dairy industry.
And I think it's, you know, it's really fun. You get to meet, just so many people.
Jared Schmidt 05:10
So, so it wasn't just like a standard, you go, you become, like, Miss Whatever. And you
represent in a parade you actually did educational programming as well?
Jill Allen 05:21
Yes, yes. That's what it's, that's what it's all based on. We do, of course, you know, a parade
and you wave, and you handout, you know, stickers or...Yeah, and you get pictures or
autographs. But we also went to local schools, and we'd bring, like, different kinds of cattle feed
to show, like, "This is cotton seed, this is corn," you know. And so,"This is what the cows eat.
J
J
J
J
This is how much water they drink in a day. This is a Jersey, this is a Holstein. Farmers love
their cattle. It's like their family." You know, like, we go in and we educate, so it wasn't, that's
why you had to be really good speaker for the competition. A big portion of it is, um, you have
to do public speaking, give a speech, you had to create your own little advertisement on a dairy
product. So it's really fun. It was really, it was really fun.
Jared Schmidt 06:13
Do you remember what your advertisement was for?
Jill Allen 06:16
I do [Smiles].
Jared Schmidt 06:18
What was it?
Jill Allen 06:18
You're gonna laugh [Laughs]. So, back, I can't remember which year Forrest Gump, the movie
came out [1994].
Jared Schmidt 06:26
Mhm.
Jill Allen 06:26
So, I did it, the Forest Gump...You know how he talks about, like, the different types of shrimp
there are like, there's coconut, I don't know, remember it, coconut syrup gumbo, whatever blah
blah.
Jared Schmidt 06:36
Mhm.
Jill Allen 06:36
I did this same type of skit but for dairy products. So there's, you know, chocolate milk, and I
did it with the accent too, which is horrible, but, your like, "There's cheese, there's cheddar
cheese, there's mozzarella, there's, you know, strawberry milk." And I just, just really [Laughing
J
J
J
J
cheese, there's mozzarella, there's, you know, strawberry milk." And I just, just really [Laughing
quietly] rambled on, like, millions of different dairy products, but everybody they knew what it
was from. So, and then I had this little, like, little plastic shrimp [Laughs]. Pretty corny, but I
won [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 07:11
But it worked, and that's the important thing right?
Jill Allen 07:13
It worked, yeah, it makes me laugh because it's so embarrassing. But...My, actually, my son, for
my birthday this year, some you'll get a kick out of this because this is how our community
works in Tillamook. Yeah, everybody here is genuinely, we'll help you out. And my son Breckon
goes, this guy pulled up to their dairy farm and said, "I have a DVD," or not DVD, a what are
they...
Jared Schmidt 07:39
The VHS
Jill Allen 07:40
[Excitedly] VHS! Of the crowning of your mom and I...And he gave it to him and Brekcon gave it
to me for my birthday press. I was like, "What is this?" He goes, "I don't know some guy." And
I'm like, "Who's this guy?" {Jill and Jared Laugh] I have it. I have it.
Jared Schmidt 07:58
Maybe. Maybe we can get that for the Library of Congress.
Jill Allen 08:02
Well, that'd be cool because, actually, so I haven't seen it yet. But it might be great because, I'll
tell you why. Because it's really part of...It's actually is very, that goes back a long time. I can't
remember when we started this but um, that for in Oregon, Oregon dairy princesses, and it's
part of the Tillamook cheese, you know, we, were promoting not only, you know, Tillamook but
all of our dairy products and the products that...You know the Oregon State drink is milk.
Jared Schmidt 08:29
Mhm.
J
J
J
Jill Allen 08:30
So yeah, so anyways, but if you want to see it you can [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 08:34
I would like to. I would, I would enjoy that. That would be fun. So then, do you still, so it sounds
like you still get comments from, from locals about you being the dairy princess.
Jill Allen 08:46
I mean not so much anymore.
Jared Schmidt 08:48
Not anymore.
Jill Allen 08:48
But that was just an odd one that came out of nowhere. I mean, just random so...
Jared Schmidt 08:55
Yeah.
Jill Allen 08:55
But, yeah, it was, that was cool.
Jared Schmidt 08:58
Mkay, so then after your reign as dairy princess was complete, you went to OSU, you said?
Jill Allen 09:04
I did. So I actually milked dairy cattle for the Bennett Family Farm, and then also for the
Rousses Family Farm in Tillamook. Then I went to Oregon State and I'd come on weekends,
then I'd milk once in a while, but then I also milk dairy cows at Oregon State dairy, going
through college, you know, making some money. Actually, will actually worked, I went to Linn
Benton [Community College] for two years, then transferred Oregon State to finish out, which
was great for me because Linn Benton's and a little bit smaller.
J
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 09:37
Mhm.
Jill Allen 09:37
And coming from a small community to a larger university, I just wasn't ready for that, so it was
good for me to stair step. And then I went to Oregon State, and I got my degree in Agriculture,
Business Management and Speech Communications. I was on the, I participated in the Oregon,
OSU dairy, not committee but um, like, what do you call it? Clubs, the clubs?
Jared Schmidt 10:05
Okay. Yeah, like a student club.
Jill Allen 10:06
Yeah. And then through high school to at Oregon, at Tillamook High School, um, I did FFA and I
did dairy products judging.
Jared Schmidt 10:16
Okay.
Jill Allen 10:16
That's another key, important, that kinda, like, opened the door to where I am today.
Jared Schmidt 10:21
Yeah. I was gonna, I was going to ask if you did FFA, so...
Jill Allen 10:24
I did four H and FFA. I show, I didn't show dairy cattle, but I showed sheep and pigs.
Jared Schmidt 10:31
Okay.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 10:32
But, the dairy products judging in FFA, I did that. And that, you know, was an opportunity to see
in the dairy industry of other jobs there are to do besides just people thinking, "Oh, dairy, it's
just dairy farming."
Jared Schmidt 10:44
Mhm.
Jill Allen 10:44
There's much more to it.
Jared Schmidt 10:46
Yeah. Mkay.
Jill Allen 10:46
Yup.
Jared Schmidt 10:47
I did, I judged general livestock in FFA.
Jill Allen 10:51
I did that, too, I did that as well.
Jared Schmidt 10:54
I was not very good at it [Laughs]. I will self-disclose that, for the record as for perpetuity, I was
not very good at it.
Jill Allen 11:02
I wasn't, I was not on the top, but I was not on bottom either, but I was not on the top [Laughs].
J
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 11:07
You were, you were better than me. So then, you were on the dairy team, so what was that
like? What did you have to do in, on the FFA dairy team?
Jill Allen 11:16
Yeah, and I actually still help out today, I fully support our local FFA chapter at the Tillamook
High School and I will go in and help with their dairy products judging team and other kids
working on their speeches. But, for that, what you would learn, you'd learn a bunch of different
answers to questions that pertain to the dairy food industry, like, I mean can be anything from
what type of cheese, you know, was created in, you know, Kobe, Wisconsin? Or something like
that, you know, those kinds of questions. And then you did a milk taste test to taste different
off flavors, um, and then cheeses identifying the cheeses. So we'll get into that, because that
really leads into...Another thing I didn't tell you a little bit about my credentials, which is
important also is I'm a national and international cheese judge for 10 years now.
Jared Schmidt 12:19
Really?
Jill Allen 12:19
And I can...Yeah, and I can send you over my bio so you have everything.
Jared Schmidt 12:24
That would be great.
Jill Allen 12:24
But yes, I judged in Italy, I've judged in England the last few years, um, and then nationally in
America. All different types of cheeses all over, you know, from all over the world, which is
amazing and fun, and you get to learn about something every single time. But I've also
received, I took the test a couple of years ago for the American Cheese Society, CCP, the
Certified Cheese Srofessional which is like the wines, sommeliers for wines, but it's for cheese. I
passed that, and I have that now. And if you go to their website, it'll state what you need to, to
have experienced in order to take the test. It's like thousands of hours of experience in the
dairy industry. And then I've also been a contributor writer for the James Beard winning Oxford
Companion to Cheese. I have two entries into that, one's on cheese wire, and one is on cheeses
marinated in oil. So, I can also send you those those as well, if you want to see those.
Jared Schmidt 13:32
I would love to read those. Congratulations on those publications and being a sommelier for
J
J
J
I would love to read those. Congratulations on those publications and being a sommelier for
cheese.
Jill Allen 13:39
Yep, yep! So I do, that's just a little bit more of my, just credentials because, people go, "Oh,
you went to school for agriculture business management, Speech Communications, but I have
so much more layered in of, like, taking other classes, you know, Wisconsin, you know, Babcock
Hall and um...
Jared Schmidt 13:58
Yup.
Jill Allen 13:59
You know, it's just, there's so much.
Jared Schmidt 14:01
Mnm.
Jill Allen 14:01
It's been over the last 20 plus years of just layering in and just...I tell people, I go, "Yeah, well,
that was a degree like from, you know, 2000 or [laughs] or so. It's been a while."
Jared Schmidt 14:12
It's been a little while. So you've been to Babcock Hall in Wisconsin?
Jill Allen 14:15
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:16
Okay.
Jill Allen 14:16
Yeah.
J
J
J
J
J
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:17
My, my...
Jill Allen 14:17
I worked with CDR, too, Center for Dairy Research, as well.
Jared Schmidt 14:21
Okay. My department was right next to Babcock Hall. So...
Jill Allen 14:24
Oh, excellent! Excellent.
Jared Schmidt 14:24
Yes, so I've gotten many scoops of ice cream from Babcock Hall before.
Jill Allen 14:30
I like the dairy is like, right, like everything is built up around it. It's just, so...
Jared Schmidt 14:35
It is very surprising. Okay, so, okay, so we have a lot to...Oh my goodness, that's so great. I did
not know
Jill Allen 14:46
...
Jared Schmidt 14:47
Great. So, you studied at, it was Agriculture Business and Communications at Oregon State
University.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 14:54
Correct.
Jared Schmidt 14:54
Then you, when you completed your degree you, what was the next step, for you, before you
became a sommelier for cheese, which is just the greatest thing.
Jill Allen 15:04
I know. Um, so once I graduated I literally,I remember thinking, "I needed a job. Like seriously."
And so, I actually, the, the when I was working at Tillamook, so ,not only did I scoop ice cream,
did I greet guests into the visitor center and did an internship in Accounting. I also, a few
summers, I think, two or, maybe two summers, I actually, also, worked in the Quality Control
Lab in the Sensory Lab during the summer, like, helping run whey powders, helping plate
micros and then the sensory lab.
Jared Schmidt 15:48
Mhm.
Jill Allen 15:48
So they're like, "Hey, we need help in the sensory lab." And I was like, "Oh, that's cool,"
because, you know, I mean, I did dairy products judging, so, I didn't really know much about it.
So I started working in a sensory lab just as a temporary help during summer, but realized I
really loved it.
Jared Schmidt 16:07
Mhm.
Jill Allen 16:07
And, and then that's really where I found out that I was really good at tasting products.
Jared Schmidt 16:12
Okay.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 16:13
And so, then when I graduated from Oregon State, a job came open for a sensory lab technician
at Tillamook. And you had to pass the sensory taste test, which is different varying levels of the
basic off flavors, bitter, sour, salty, sweet, in a water solution. And then, are you able to identify
which varying level it is,
Jared Schmidt 16:40
Mhm.
Jill Allen 16:42
and a control. And so I took that test, applied for the job, I passed. And so then I started
working as a Sensory Lab Technician at Tillamook for about eight years. And I can send you
over my resume, I have everything in writing too,
Jared Schmidt 16:58
That'd be great.
Jill Allen 16:58
because I might be a little fuzzy on my exact dates.
Jared Schmidt 17:02
That'd be great, yeah.
Jill Allen 17:03
And so, so I'm working in the sensory lab. And then I became, eventually, the sensory lab
manager. And my goal was to make that the best in the world, like the best said, like...And I
thought to myself, "Well, who does it the best in the world that are close by?" You know,
Wisconsin, Wisconsin does the best. So, because they're the only state, and you may know this,
that requires cheese graders to have a state certified grading cheese license.
Jared Schmidt 17:33
Hmm.
Jill Allen 17:34
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 17:34
And to have a state certified cheese maker on site in your cheese plant. So, I was like, "Well,
when I hire individuals, I want to give them a test besides the taste test, but something that's
meaningful like, and how we can continue to build upon our current talents and knowledge of
100 year old company and make it the best in the world."
Jared Schmidt 17:56
Right.
Jill Allen 17:56
And so. I was like, I'm gonna get my Wisconsin State graders cheese license. Which I did get, I
just haven't paid the money to have it updated because I don't need it. I'm not in Wisconsin.
But I just took it. I did, you know, have it for, for a few years.
Jared Schmidt 18:14
Mhm.
Jill Allen 18:14
I take the test, passed, and their state grader, he goes, "You're really good at tasting cheese,
like identifying different off flavors and defects." And I said, "Oh, thank you." And he goes,
"Hey! We're looking for a West Coast judge. Would you want to be, would you want to judge for,
um, The Wisconsin Cheesemakers Associations, USA, it's every other year, national contest,
cheese contest". And I was like, "Oh my gosh! Yes!" And so I judge the first year they're like,
"Now, you know, first time year, you know, judges, we usually don't ask back to the world
because it's, it's half the amount of judges because the other half is from out of country."
Jared Schmidt 18:59
Mhm.
Jill Allen 18:59
But I did, apparently did such a good job, that they said, "Oh, do you want to come for the
world?" And I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" So I've been judging with them ever since. And then, I,
part, another part of my job, which I do a lot. But, I also help with technical sales.
Jared Schmidt 19:16
Mhm.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 19:16
So, helping to sell our cheese. We have our sales team, but they're not the technical experts of,
like, explaining, like, you know how it melt or what, you know, what we did to the product or
why it's better. And so, I was giving a technical tour to the Irish Dairy Board, and they were like,
"You're really good at this taste testing. Would you want to judge at the International Cheese
Awards in England?" I'm like, "What's going on here? Like this is the second time this..." And I
was like "Yes!" So they said you have to submit your resume and I'm like not a problem, submit
a resume, and I've been judging for them ever since. And so, um, it's just been, it's been
fantastic to get to know people and get to know, and I'll tell people I'm a turophile, which
means I'm a lover of cheese because it tells a story of, like, where the product...the ingredients
came from who made it. And that's what I really appreciate you doing here, because people, I
don't know if they realize, like, how much cheese tells a story. So, sensory analysis, I can look
at a piece of cheese and go, "This cheese is telling me this." So you, know kind of like you say,
"Oh, your tea leaf reading, uh, tea leaf reading." Well, I can tell by a piece of cheese, like, "Well
it has this defect so something happened here in the make process, or in the aging process, or
in the retail side." But it also tells just a story of how well it's made, or poorly it's made. So it's
always fun to look at, I always look at cheese and it's, that's my, my biggest passion is cheese
for sure.
Jared Schmidt 20:50
Nice. That's, that's so exciting. You said, uh, turophile? [Jared's audio has reverb]
Jill Allen 20:57
A turophile. So, I would have to give you a spelling on that.
Jared Schmidt 20:59
Okay.
Jill Allen 20:59
But it's like t-u-r- something. Anyways, it's just really just a lover of cheese. So, I always say, I
just you know, or we'll say like, oh a curd nerd, you know [Laughs]? Really, truly, just, it's
ridiculous to the point of you know like, "Why do you always got to smell your cheese on
your...?" Because if you go to a restaurant, well, I've got to look at it, I got to look at the
cheese. You've got to see what they're selling here.
Jared Schmidt 21:26
That's exciting. That's super cool. Um...
J
J
J
Jill Allen 21:28
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 21:29
as somebody who worked at a craft brewery, I can, I can understand the smelling, looking, over
critical analysis
Jill Allen 21:35
Yes!
Jared Schmidt 21:35
of what's going on.
Jill Allen 21:37
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 21:38
That's cool. So, could you talk about what it's like to be an, a cheese judge on national and
international levels? What's that like? What do you do?
Jill Allen 21:47
Mhm. Yeah, absolutely. So when you're, when you're asked to judge cheese at a contest, you
are there to give an unbiased opinion on the cheese itself and you're going to be following
standardized defects that are industry standard. Now, I have to do it a little bit different in the
UK because they accept certain defects that the US doesn't, so you have to switch those out.
But, when you go to judge the product there's all, there's lots of people around, sometimes
even the producers are watching, there's media, there's cameras. But in general, the point is
not about, you know, you. So when you're judging the product, it's very stoic, just you know,
really becoming intimate with the product, smelling it, and feeling it. Because those are going
to tell you, be key indicators, telling you about the cheese. You know, people purchase with
their eyes first if they've never had the cheese, right? So, looking at the packaging, is the
packaging closed well? There's no wrinkles in it, there's no free serum in the seal, or excess
cheese particles in the seal, because, you know, if you go to the store and you find, like, food
J
J
J
J
items in the seal of whatever you're purchasing like, "I'm gonna grab a different one." But you
know the color. So there's, and each cheese has different standards. So I always tell people it's
like a dog show, right?
Jared Schmidt 23:23
Mhm.
Jill Allen 23:24
So, you have the standard of the dog, the breed, and then you start deducting points. So every
cheese that's brought to your table, it starts out a hundred points, basically, and then you start
looking for defects in that cheese. And then you start deducting points depending on the
severity of the defect.
Jared Schmidt 23:43
Okay.
Jill Allen 23:43
So, and then there's a scale for that. So, the cheese itself um you know you're you're treating it
with the highest respect. Because, also these producers, cheese producers believe their
cheese, this is, your know, their art, this is the best product that they make. So, we want to be
able to evaluate that and give them honest feedback and critiques on it. And then also leave, I
usually leave nice comments as well, you know, with within my evaluation so that they know
you're, like, "Hey, this was great, however, we're seeing these defects in your product." But no
cheese is 100. Ever. So, there, you can always find something, even if it's like the slightest
little, little thing, this...But usually, it's like, you know, something about the packaging, or, if it's,
you know, amazing cheese but, um...It's just, cheese is very complex. And it's, it really honestly
saddens me when we talk about cheeses in America that were originally protected designated
origin, you know, like in another country, but then we've Americanized them, so they're not as,
as typical as you'd see over in Europe and they're maybe not as complex in flavor, and texture.
And so it's, you know, like, "Ah, we're losing some of that story." So it's been more modernized,
or industrialized, I should say.
Jared Schmidt 25:12
Mhm.
Jill Allen 25:13
So that's why I really also love Tillamook cheese, because we do, and Dale would have told you,
we do a lot of methods that, I'll tell you, a lot of large scale and small artisan cheese makers do
not do. So it makes it very unique.
J
J
J
not do. So it makes it very unique.
Jared Schmidt 25:28
Such as...?
Jill Allen 25:31
Yep, such as...So I consider our cheese an American original. And I will say that through and
through. And the reason, I'll get to your question, too, but the reason I call our cheddar an
American original, is because you can make cheddar cheese anywhere in the world. I have
visited the cheddar cheese caves in Cheddar, Englandm down in Somerset, and it's a beautiful
cheddar, but it does not taste like Tillamook, right? Because we're, it's, our cheddar is made
with different types of cultures, those starter cultures, those enzymes create different flavor
profiles. So you still go through the cheddaring process, but how it's, you know, the different
types of yeasts and molds, whether it's cave age, or how it's being handled is going to grow
different flavor profiles. So, in America, we follow the Code of Federal Regulation for cheddar,
which means we have to follow a couple of the matrix rules. So our cheddar cheese in America
cannot be greater than 39% moisture,
Jared Schmidt 26:32
Mkay.
Jill Allen 26:32
and it has to be at or above 50%, fat-dry basis. So as long as we follow into those rules, we can
be considered a cheddar cheese, you can make it stirred curd, you can make it the old flipped,
milled curd way. So, there's different ways that the industry, nowadays, can speed up the
process because time is money! So they'll move things as fast. But, at Tillamook, there's things
we want to go as fast as possible, and then we want to go slow as possible.
Jared Schmidt 27:03
Mhm.
Jill Allen 27:04
So, fast, bringing the fresh milk in and then converting it to cheese and then letting it naturally
age, you know, with time in our warehouse facility.
Jared Schmidt 27:12
Okay.
J
J
J
Okay.
Jill Allen 27:12
But, one thing I don't know if Dale brought up, but I find it extremely unique to Tillamook. So we
grow, we grow our own starter cultures on site.
Jared Schmidt 27:23
Okay.
Jill Allen 27:23
So that's what we inoculate the milk with to get it to start the fermentation process. But what
else is unique, which I don't see anymore, also, is very rarely, is that we do the old traditional
back slop method. So there's a book called from, Dr. Michael Toucan. And he's a cheese
professor. And he talks about this old method of back slopping, which I can get you the
reference of the page.
Jared Schmidt 27:52
Cool.
Jill Allen 27:52
I have the book somewhere here, or I took it upstairs.
Jared Schmidt 27:55
Okay.
Jill Allen 27:56
But we, which means, we're pulling our sweet whey from the previous day's cheese make and
using that as the starter media to start to grow up our cheese cultures to, for the next day's
cheese make.
Jared Schmidt 28:11
Okay.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 28:12
So, that process is, is unique to Tillmook like because we don't come in to phage problems.
Like, we're so consistent, we're so clean, and we've been doing it, you know, forever.
Jared Schmidt 28:26
Yeah.
Jill Allen 28:27
So you just don't even see small artisan cheese makers do that anyore because it's so volatile.
If you have a phage out problem in a dead vat, then you're not making cheese. So,
cheesemakers now, will fully buy that, you know, starter culture. So buy that, you know, direct
vat sets and the, not only the non-starter lactic acid bacteria for flavor, but the starter bacteria
as well. So they'll even pop in flavor to it. Because our cheese also is heat shocked, which, did
Dale talk to you about that process as well?
Jared Schmidt 29:01
A litle bit, yea.
Jill Allen 29:01
Right. So, that's also unique for us because we fall in, if you look at the regulations for the FDA,
they really have two worlds: They're saying your raw, or your pasteurized. Well, we're not raw,
we're not pasteurized, we're heat shocked. Okay. So, we're not cooking up every single particle
in the milk to have that kill log, we're only doing part of it. So, we're not fully raw and we're not
fully pasteurized, but so we have to follow the raw milk ordinance which means we have to eat
or cheddar cheese at or above 35 degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum of 60 days. And that's
where Tillamook Medium is born, it starts. I shouldn't say born, but it's released as Medium.
Jared Schmidt 29:42
This all sounds so easy [laughs].
Jill Allen 29:45
It is! It's amazing, and it's so fun! [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 29:48
Such a simple process.
J
J
J
J
Such a simple process.
Jill Allen 29:51
I might be jumping around but I just want to make sure I, you get as much as you want today. I
mean we can meet again, but...
Jared Schmidt 29:56
That'd be great. Absolutely, I really appreciate it. You mentioned a fosia problem? Is that would
you said?
Jill Allen 30:03
Phage.
Jared Schmidt 30:03
Phage problem.
Jill Allen 30:05
I'm not the best speller, Jared, but...
Jared Schmidt 30:07
Don't worry about it.
Jill Allen 30:09
Maybe it's p-h. Anyways, you will Google it, and you will find it. So it's a bacteria, it's a virus-
bacteria. So, we have, you know, viruses all around us all the time [Jared laughs]. So, if you
have a phage problem, the, you know, in your starter culture, it's going to kill the fermentation
process, so you're not going to be able to produce, you know, start that, that process, creating,
you know, curds and wheys.
Jared Schmidt 30:40
Okay, I heard that word, I wanted to make sure I got you to explain what that was.
Jill Allen 30:46
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 30:46
I can send you links, I can send you everything, if you want more information, so.
Jared Schmidt 30:50
Don't tempt me with that, that'll be...
Jill Allen 30:52
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 30:54
So, okay, so, so...So you are responsible, you became the director of product excellence?
Jill Allen 31:01
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 31:01
And when, that was after you were serving as a sensory lab technician for eight years, and then
manager, and then did you become director or?
Jill Allen 31:10
No, um, you know, my, I read, my resume will say everything, because I've been at Tillamook,
where my title, they would just change your title, you know, here and there and tweak it. But, I
worked in sensory and then I would say about after, I can't remember the eight or ten years, I,
between that, I took on research and development. So actually, because,we were, we were not
a big CPG company. And, when you worked at Tillamook, you kind of need a little bit of
everything.
Jared Schmidt 31:40
Okay.
Jill Allen 31:41
And so, I actually managed sensory and research and development. And I didn't go to school
and research and development. So everything I had to learn I learned on my own. So then I was
doing that, and that, and then all of a sudden I was like, "Hey, we're growing, our company is
J
J
J
J
J
growing and where do you want to focus?" You know, I'm like, I love sensory but there's an
opportunity to focus sensory and research and development for new product development. So
sensory, on the quality side, is where you're evaluating the product day in and day out.
Jared Schmidt 32:13
Mhm.
Jill Allen 32:14
And you're, you know, to do that positive release, but I wanted to really, like, help build new
products and develop the sensory that goes along for the new products that in the sensory
quality lab preys upon.
Jared Schmidt 32:27
Okay.
Jill Allen 32:27
So then I went into research, or development, full time. And then we started to grow our team.
And this new title of Director of Product Excellence is actually, I think I'm going on my second
year with it, but I was a director before that, but it was a Director of Research and
Development.
Jared Schmidt 32:47
Okay.
Jill Allen 32:47
But now it's, but I still am in research and development, but it's product excellence. So, right
now, I do some product development work, but I also ensure that all of our products are doing
right by everybody, making sure that our ingredients are clean and simple. Taking a third look
at, you know, the ingredients statements, what after the developers have done to say, like
challenge anything within our development process. I work on, you know with chefs, I do
pairings, I do digital footprint sensory mapping. I lead our team for non-bias sensory analysis on
new product development work. So we have a, our QDA panelist. I do a lot of different things
but, to button it all up just in a few simple words, it's big pieces. The non-biased sensory
analysis work for new product development and I still specialize in cheese, working a lot in
cheese. Did Dale by chance talk to you about the Cape Mears, aka English Style Sweet
Cheddar?
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 33:57
Yes, because that is, if I may say so, my partner and my favorite cheese.
Jill Allen 34:05
Aww, yeah! I love that! Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 34:06
The day we felt the most clever was when we ate Cape Mears cheese at the Cape Mears
lighthouse.
Jill Allen 34:12
Oh my god, Jared, guess what?
Jared Schmidt 34:15
That was before you all changed the name on the label.
Jill Allen 34:18
[In disappointed tone] Oh...I don't have any control or what the name it really but [chuckles].
So, did Dale tell you the story behind that?
Jared Schmidt 34:25
He told me something about it. I want to hear your side of the story.
Jill Allen 34:29
[Excitedly] Yeah! Well, so um, I, as I told you, I was judging in England and I went to Cheddar,
England, and learning about their cheddar. And I realized that they have a different flavor
profile.
Jared Schmidt 34:46
Mhm.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 34:46
So, a lot of times they'll put a secondary adjunct culture in there called helveticus. So, what it
does is it helps to, it can help to, de-bitter the cheese so the cheese does not have a bitter note
to it as it ages. But at higher levels, it'll create a sweeter profile.
Jared Schmidt 35:07
Mkay.
Jill Allen 35:07
So, uh, tasting different cheddars from England because there's lots of them and they believe
they are, you know, theirs is the real deal ours is not, you know, in America.
Jared Schmidt 35:17
Right, because England.
Jill Allen 35:18
Yeah. So fun fact, really quick. So when I enter our cheese into contest, we American chedders
don't compete against the UK territorial cheddars because they can't go in the same contests
So, I have to, my cheddar goes, competes against other, like, non-, non-UK cheddar cheeses.
Jared Schmidt 35:40
Ugh.
Jill Allen 35:42
Because I know...
Jared Schmidt 35:43
I'm rolling my eyes so hard.
Jill Allen 35:45
What if we won? It would be, like, that would not over well. So anyways, that's a fun fact.
Anyway, so judging I was like, "I think we could, let's do a, let's do a you know, English-style
version but Tillamook!" So I went home, I talked to Dale about it. So this was back when I was
J
J
J
J
J
just, I mean there was no category manager, there was no director lead for like new, there was
like one lead, Joe Pruitt, for all of the portfolios. And I said, "Hey, I want to make this cheese."
And he goes, "Go ahead!" And so, I went and met with Dale, and like, "Hey, let's do this,"
because he's the, you know, head cheese maker. I'm not a cheese maker by trade. I,
everything I've learned on cheesemaking was from Dale.
Jared Schmidt 36:32
Okay.
Jill Allen 36:32
Which, I think, you know, I mean, that's better than going to the university. I mean, he is the
real thing.
Jared Schmidt 36:38
Mhm.
Jill Allen 36:38
So everything I've learned is from Dale. And I just, I also speak so highly of him, he's just so
amazing and kind. So, he's like, "Yeah, let's do it!" So, we worked with the Culture House and
Dale's absolute, you know, rock star cheese making methods. At Tillamook, you know, how we
do things with are, are heat shocked and our products and...So, we created this white aged
cheddar cheese, typically 12 to 15 months when that sweet note starts to pop.
Jared Schmidt 37:15
Okay.
Jill Allen 37:15
And it took a few years to get the cultures, um, to really be standardized. And cheeses takes a
while to create because you gotta wait you know over a year! Did it work? No.
Jared Schmidt 37:29
[Laughs]
Jill Allen 37:30
J
J
J
J
I mean, it's a pain, painful. And so we, then, now we have this wonderful new cheddar, and it's
my, I say, "Oh, it's my baby." I just, I just, it was just such a fun project making it with Dale and
his expertise. And then the idea of, "Oh, let's make an English-style version cheddar with the
Helvetica so it makes it more sweeter.
Jared Schmidt 37:54
Okay. Ah, that's so great. Well, I have to, I have to share with you them. So the other, I think it
was last week I was in the creamery. And you know how they
Jill Allen 38:02
Uh-huh.
Jared Schmidt 38:02
have this, this, the displays for people to buy the cheese's like, like Cape Mears and the
smoked stuff.
Jill Allen 38:09
Yes!
Jared Schmidt 38:10
And there was this young couple who looked like they were debating which one to get. And I
was on a mission just to get the Cape Mears and some curds and leave. And I told them, I said
"Get this one. This is my favorite. I know the people who make it."
Jill Allen 38:24
Yeah!
Jared Schmidt 38:25
They looked at each other and I said "I live here, it's okay." And
Jill Allen 38:29
Yeah! "I'm not a weird-o".
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 38:30
Yeah. And they laugh, grabbed it, and said, "Okay, we'll give it a shot." And so...
Jill Allen 38:36
Aw, so, yeah. I liked the name Cape Mears, I really did. But, you know, when you get out of our
region, what's Ca[e Mears to somebody else?
Jared Schmidt 38:45
Right, yeah.
Jill Allen 38:46
So, but, then they named it English Style Sweet Cheddar, but, I know they're having some
questions from buyers. They're like, "Well why would you buy this and we can buy the real
product from England." I mean, I'd say valid question, so...
Jared Schmidt 39:02
Right.
Jill Allen 39:02
I really don't know if this is still the right name for it, but...
Jared Schmidt 39:05
Things can change right?
Jill Allen 39:07
Yeah, things can...but the cheese the same recipe. Same cheese [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 39:10
Yeah, there you go. You bet. What, so, you called it your, your baby a minute ago.
Jill Allen 39:15
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 39:15
Yeah!
Jared Schmidt 39:15
What do you think when you see, if you go to an event, and you notice it's on the table or you
see people at the Creamery buying that, what makes, you what does that make you think?
Jill Allen 39:26
Oh, you know, it takes a whole team to make a product.
Jared Schmidt 39:29
Right.
Jill Allen 39:29
But, I crie me Dale, he was, you know, the head cheese maker. He really made, made my idea
happen. And then I did the sensory profile work. So, as the cheese you know, it's like I have this
idea, he made the cheese and then we'd go into the sensory analysis like oh, if you know he
would taste it like oh, it's not really there. The body texture is not right or the flavor is not right.
So we did a lot of like there's a lot of work to it. But no, it just makes me happy. Just happy that
people Enjoy and like it. It was, you know, made during a time until McMullen we didn't have a
lot of people working here as much as we do today. So we had a little bit more free rein to play.
And we did. So we had a lot of fun doing it. But, ya know, it makes it easy to have food to be
fun. She should be fun. People should enjoy it and fun trying different pairings with it. You
know, do you know do you like honey with it? Or do you like certain kind of, you know, local
beer with it. So it's just fun. And you find new things that work and things that don't. You never
know what you can discover.
Jared Schmidt 40:40
Karen likes to my partner likes to pair it with a raspberry jam.
Jill Allen 40:45
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a good one. Yeah,
Jared Schmidt 40:48
I told you, we've bought a it lot [Laughs].
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 40:50
Good! I have a bunch in my fridge. I'm actually leaving for England this Friday.
Jared Schmidt 40:55
Oh!
Jill Allen 40:56
And, so, I'm taking a bunch with me, so.
Jared Schmidt 40:59
Are you doing another cheese competition, or?
Jill Allen 41:02
No, I'm just gonna go visit my boyfriend this time.
Jared Schmidt 41:05
Oh, okay. Right, right.
Jill Allen 41:05
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 41:06
Nice. Excellent. So, you said you do the sensory profile, is it? Or?
Jill Allen 41:13
Yes. Mhm.
Jared Schmidt 41:14
Could you walk me through that process? What that's like?
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 41:17
Yeah, yeah! And I call it, you know, so there's a couple of different, sometimes I'll say, "Oh, the
digital footprint of it."
Jared Schmidt 41:23
Okay.
Jill Allen 41:24
Because, when we evaluate a cheese, I'm evaluating it that day. Cheese is living, it changes.
But in general, what we're trying to do is capture the essence of it that, when you purchase it,
that's what you're going to experience. Now, Jared, I talked a little bit about cheese judging,
how we're looking for the defects, right?
Jared Schmidt 41:46
Mhm, right.
Jill Allen 41:47
So that's, that's industry standard. However, when I go to sell you a piece of cheese, if I said to
you, this cheese has a very slight bitter note, and it's, has a sour forward aftertaste, or you
know, you're like, "I'm not going to buy that." Sounds horrible, right? But the average person
can't pick up some of those defects. So, if you go to our makers website, so I do all of that,
where you'll see the different flavor profiles, like it might say, custard, or, you know, notes of
sour grass.
Jared Schmidt 42:20
Okay.
Jill Allen 42:21
So, my goal there, is that, when I taste, I have my technical terminology that I can train our
sensory lab upon, but then I have my consumer facing verbiage. So custard, so our cheddar is
known for having low moisture, higher fat content with, compared to the CFR that I spoke to
earlier.
Jared Schmidt 42:41
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 42:41
Okay.
Jill Allen 42:41
So, it's really rich and luxurious. So, it's going to be really creamy, really milky, and it has our
cheese, our cheddar cheese on the West Coast is typically known to have a sulfur note to it. But
the whole process, the idea is to have a well balanced, but yet complex. So you don't want one
flavor really overshadowing the whole experience.
Jared Schmidt 43:02
Right.
Jill Allen 43:03
So technically, sulfur is a defect, but that is what's in our make of our cheddar. And so, I always
tell, it's a custard note, or, like, we have a version, I think it's 2018 Makers right now that's a
little bit Sivaji, a little bit wild, it has a little bit sour grassy note to it. So, say it's, you know,
essence of sour grass.
Jared Schmidt 43:23
Mhm.
Jill Allen 43:23
And, you know, maybe the cheese has a little bit of a yeasty note, you know, French bread! So,
those are terminology that the average person can understand and create this romance copy
for.
Jared Schmidt 43:37
Mhm.
Jill Allen 43:37
So, when I trade sense, train sensory graders, you know, we had to train upon, you know, the
salty, sour, bitter acid, blah, blah, blah, and then the, it had, and then the quantitative, quantify
those.
Jared Schmidt 43:52
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 43:52
Mhm.
Jill Allen 43:52
So, I don't care what you think in your mind, but as long as we get to the same result. So, a
good example is, Jared you think, "Oh, I love my grandma's beef stew." That's brothy.
Jared Schmidt 44:04
Right.
Jill Allen 44:05
Let's say that's brothy. So when you taste a cheese, okay, this is a brothy note, but this is an
intensity of a slight, or a very slight. And then we have a numeric value assigned to those, so 0-
1-2-3-4, with half points. So we're creating this robust sensory mapping of the cheese so that:
one, I can train this quality sensor team on how to, they should be grading the product, but
then how do we sell it? How do we go in and describe it and really draw people to think, you
know, bring inspiration. "Oh, when I put this on my cheese board, um, I see this cheese has a
note of black tea in it and strawberries. I think, you know, I'm going to pair it with the
strawberry jam." So, just, you know, really helps them to fold that in. But that's one of my
favorite things is to create these spider maps of our dairy products.
Jared Schmidt 44:59
Okay, so to kind of like a...[To his dog] Oh, hi! My dog just decided to show up.
Jill Allen 45:03
Aw, I love dogs. I have three, but I put mine all outside for this interview because...
Jared Schmidt 45:09
Aww. My dog just decides, she likes to hang out under my desk sometimes when I do these so
she just bumped me.
Jill Allen 45:14
Oh, Jared, I cut up some cheese, I use my home kitchen now a lot for my work. And they're all
like this [imitates dog begging look], they're like, they're just waiting, they want all the scraps,
they're terrible. [Both laugh]
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 45:26
Ours does the same thing. That's really funny. Um, so, you're basically kind of like a poet, in a
way, with cheese on the website, right? You're kind of trying to craft or kind of like, how would
you buy a bottle of wine? Right? It has notes of current or blackberry and, but with, okay.
Jill Allen 45:44
Yes. Right, because, you know, who's gonna bite, you know, like, "Oh, it's a stringent and it has
tannon note," you know, for the wine or whatever. And they're "Hmm, I don't wanna buy..." I
want something that's telling me a romance story.
Jared Schmidt 45:55
Right.
Jill Allen 45:55
So that's how you, you know, but it really, I can tell you exactly every single one of those
romance descriptors. I will, if you said, "Okay, Jill, on the Maker's..." So, on the Makers line, you
go to our website [https://www.tillamook.com/makersreserve], so, I did that work, not our
quality sensor team. So, I grade our makers line every single year that we're going to release.
So, if you said, "Hey, Jill, this year had this flavor. What, what technical terminology does this
line up to?" And I'll be able to tell you,.
Jared Schmidt 46:27
Okay, that's cool. So you have a correlation between this is you know, this fun, like playful word
equals this scientific.
Jill Allen 46:37
Right. So, you'll hear, like, a scientific term like, fruity, fruity is in cheddars, and you'll taste it in
a lot of goudas or Parmigianos, and, but, what's fun is, you'll go, "Well, actually, this, this fruity
note, to me tastes..." because you have different esters, and in acid and the cheese. So you
might taste something that tastes like pineapple or green apple, you know, like a malic acid or
something. So, people might not know what malic acid is, but they know what green apple is.
Jared Schmidt 47:08
Yeah.
J
J
J
Jill Allen 47:09
Right?
Jared Schmidt 47:09
Yeah, yeah.
Jill Allen 47:09
So, you know, I say, "Yeah! This cheese has a note of malic acid. And they're like, "Okay..."
Jared Schmidt 47:16
Yeah. Went right over my head, but green apple I get.
Jill Allen 47:20
Some people might know, but the average person would, like, what does that mean to them?
So, we have to come up with the...I like to make sure that I can sit and tell you everything that I
have on, on there for the Makers is going to align to a technical term.
Jared Schmidt 49:25
**Resume Interview audio and transcript** So, so your day, so it sounds like you get, your day
consists of trying cheese, writing about cheese...
Jill Allen 51:46
Mhm.
Jared Schmidt 51:46
...doing the diagnostics on cheese. It sounds kind of awesome.
Jill Allen 51:51
It is! I love my job! I love, and then I get to travel. Like I was in South Carolina two weeks ago
with the sales Food Service Team selling cheese, talking about the technical aspects of, you
know, our new mozzerella low moisture whole milk shred. And, you know, buy all our products.
So it's fun. It's, it's a lot of fun.
J
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 52:12
Okay, so you're, you're going to South Carolina, to, like, trying to get into more new markets, is
that what you're trying to help out with?
Jill Allen 52:20
Well, I go wherever the sales team, where they're selling products.
Jared Schmidt 52:24
Okay.
Jill Allen 52:24
So, that was for food ovation. That was just one time in South Carolina. That was like two weeks
ago. But what I'm just stating is, is that I'll travel to different locations with the sales team for a
bigger sales opportunities that they need a technical expert on site with them to help answer
technical questions for the buyers.
Jared Schmidt 52:45
Okay.
Jill Allen 52:45
So I just had one yesterday, but was virtual, with a big buyer. And, so, just discussing the
cheeses, comparing their current product that they purchased for their private label versus
ours.
Jared Schmidt 53:01
Yeah.
Jill Allen 53:01
Just in, so I did that all analysis, and show them cold and hot.
Jared Schmidt 53:06
Mhm.
J
J
J
J
Mhm.
Jill Allen 53:06
So, cheese, you know, you're not just eating it cold, you're also eating it and cooking with it hot.
Jared Schmidt 53:12
Yeah.
Jill Allen 53:12
So, flow, you know, flow and the melt, and the stretch, and the oil off. So, we're doing all of that
analysis as well.
Jared Schmidt 53:20
Okay.
Jill Allen 53:20
Not just tasting it, ya.
Jared Schmidt 53:22
No, so you're not just, you're not just sitting there eating cheese all day. You're actually melting
and doing all the...
Jill Allen 53:27
I was thinking about that the other day. I don't, there, I don't think there's a day that I don't, do
not eat, cheese, don't eat cheese. Yeah. [Both laugh]
Jared Schmidt 53:37
And it's seems like you're still excited about it.
Jill Allen 53:40
Oh, absolutely! You mean, you just it's,it's always fun. I mean, just you learn so much, or
something, like, "Oh, this is different today." Or, you know, just find, it's just telling you a story.
J
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 53:50
Mhm.
Jill Allen 53:50
It's just telling you how it's doing.
Jared Schmidt 53:52
Yeah, how's it doing [Laughs]. Imagine a cheddar just telling you, "I'm fine."
Jill Allen 53:58
Exactly! Exactly! Or, yup, nope, something's not right here, so.
Jared Schmidt 54:03
Okay. Um, so you said, well, we started, when we started, you mentioned that you worked at
the Creamery scooping cheese or, scooping cheese. Scooping ice cream. Scooping cheese
would be a whole different ballgame.
Jill Allen 54:16
Yeah, scooping curds.
Jared Schmidt 54:18
Scooping ice cream and working at the greeting guests. What has been probably the, the
biggest change you've seen in the creamery since you've started working there? I mean,
especially since you're from Tillamook. Like, what's something that maybe surprised you, or
impressed you as you've watched it grow?
Jill Allen 54:36
Yes. And, you know, what's interesting is we have so many new individuals that, they're coming
to work for Tillamook, and they might say, "Oh, I worked at four different other CPG
companies," let's say right?
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 54:48
Mhm.
Jill Allen 54:48
Well, I'll say well, I've only worked for one, but I've been through four CEOs. Every CEO has a
different vision. Patrick has had the biggest vision for Tillamook and the most growth. And
we...When I started at Tillamook, it was basic 40 pound block production, we made some ice
cream, and we maybe, maybe occasionally came out with a new, like, holiday ice cream flavor.
Jared Schmidt 55:13
Okay.
Jill Allen 55:13
And that was it.
Jared Schmidt 55:14
Yeah.
Jill Allen 55:14
And so now, it's like, this is a whole new world for us at Tillamook. Just all of our five portfolios
of different products, we have cream cheese spreads, now, we never had that before.
Jared Schmidt 55:27
Mhm.
Jill Allen 55:27
We really have elevated all of our products. So, I worked on the butter, changing our 80%
standard fat to 81% fat, salt of the earth to sea salt.
Jared Schmidt 55:37
Mhm.
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 55:37
So, just really taking what we had and elevating it, or leaving what we have and really just
helping to tell a better story of it. So, Tillamook, I feel like I'm at, you know, a different
company, but not a different company. Its the same, you know, we're rooted in the same
tradition and methods of, you know, these are our farmers, our member-owners, and we're
here to support and grow the business for them for, you know, so that they can continue
farming for their families and, you know, for another century, right?
Jared Schmidt 56:06
Right.
Jill Allen 56:07
Um, so, just the biggest change has been, you know, going from that standard block when
Patrick started, from that center block production, to this whole new, big world of CPG and
being, you know, a well-know, a billion-dollar brand.
Jared Schmidt 56:23
Mhm.
Jill Allen 56:23
And I've been telling Patrick that, we're gonna get there one day. And we finally made it, and I
almost, I got the email and I was like, I shed a little tear because I was like, I don't know if this
means as much to people that just started working here, you know.
Jared Schmidt 56:36
Mhm.
Jill Allen 56:37
But for, I was like, "No, we've been working on this forever!" So, it was really cool.
Jared Schmidt 56:41
Right.
Jill Allen 56:42
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 56:42
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 56:44
That's super cool. And when, was when was that the billion dollar? When was?
Jill Allen 56:49
It just, just happen. Uhh, like, I don't know, a month or two ago.
Jared Schmidt 56:53
Oh really?
Jill Allen 56:53
I mean, just recently, they notified us.
Jared Schmidt 56:56
Okay.
Jill Allen 56:56
Yeah. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 56:57
Congratulation, that's super cool.
Jill Allen 56:59
Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is.
Jared Schmidt 57:02
That's super cool. And then, so, you bring it back a little bit further, you being from Tillamook,
how do you think the Creamery has shaped the, the town, and the county, and maybe its
identity?
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 57:16
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's, you know, put us on the map for sure. I flew to Florida a
couple years ago for work, and I was renting a car and I hand my driver's license and someone
goes, "What? Tillamook's a real place." Like, they're like, "It's utopia!" And they were just like,
and knew about Tillamook just because of the cheese they didn't know it was a...And I, you get
that a lot, people like, "That's a real place? Or like I'm at a salesman, and they're like, "She lives
in Tillamook," and they're like, "What?!" and so it's pretty cool. Yeah, they're like, "That's a real
place!" It's not just, you know, a made up name. Because I think people think, because it has
M-O-O in the name that
Jared Schmidt 57:55
Mhm.
Jill Allen 57:55
you know, a cow, but no, it's, but uh...No, just really, you know, we become, we just became
this 2021, the B Corp Certified.
Jared Schmidt 58:11
Okay.
Jill Allen 58:11
Did you know that?
Jared Schmidt 58:12
No, I'm not familiar, what is that?
Jill Allen 58:14
And so, B, we're B Corp certified now. And there's a lot of paperwork that goes into that. But we
have been walking the walk talking the talk of, you know, sustainability, you know, growing our
community, supporting our communities at all of our locations, not just Tillamook, but we have
a, you know, we have a business office in Ohio, we have a business office in Portland. So, in the
plants in Boardman, Oregon, so, you know, all of those communities, taking care of the land,
taking care of our cattle. So, to your question, like, how has that changed Tillamook, it's just
really helping, you know. You know, the company is growing. So, we're going to also help grow
the community in a, in a positive way as well, you know, so.
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 59:01
Right. Yeah, like during the pandemic. During, because we're still in the pandemic. Throughout
this pandemic, I guess I should say, the community, the Creamery'ss like, given cheeses to
clinics and things of that nature, right?
Jill Allen 59:15
Right. And we also donated, oh my gosh, I can't remember how many like a million or 2 million,
or maybe it was...I'm getting my projects missed, I can't remember for million or two. Because
we also donated money to the American Farm Land Trust.
Jared Schmidt 59:37
Okay.
Jill Allen 59:37
So, we did that. And then we donated money to the COVID relief.
Jared Schmidt 59:41
Mhm.
Jill Allen 59:41
Like, millions.
Jared Schmidt 59:42
Right.
Jill Allen 59:42
We also donated, and I, we need to get these facts all straight for you, but we also don't if
you're putting in. But we also donated, like, a million and a half to Oregon State University for
the Auburn Odd Dairy Center to, which is really cool, I'm part of helping with, is to build, for that
program is a...A lot of our the, individuals that want to work in the dairy industry have to go to
Babcock, you know, Madison to get their dairy degree. Well, they, a lot of times, those students
might also come back to the west coast to work here to get experience, but then they leave.
J
J
J
J
Jared Schmidt 1:00:15
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:00:15
So, really, the opportunity to educate students in the Pacific Northwest or West, right?
Jared Schmidt 1:00:22
Mhm, mhm.
Jill Allen 1:00:23
So Oregon State is developing this robust dairy program with an amazing on site, pilot plant for
cheese and ice cream, educating those students, and then also people that are currently in the
dairy industry. And so, we put money into that, too, because that's gonna help support the
whole dairy industry.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:44
Right. That's cool. That's super cool.
Jill Allen 1:00:48
Yeah! It is.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:50
So then, now that you've mentioned that Tillamooks now, like, a billion dollar, a billion dollar
company, um, what's that like looking back, being, going from scooping ice cream, tobeing a
dairy princess, to your current position? Like, how does, that, I guess, how does it make you
feel with being a whole part of that, that story?
Jill Allen 1:01:11
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's amazing. I know when, like, Dale retired, it was, like, I
cried. It's just like, because you get to know people like, really like your family.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:23
J
J
J
J
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:01:23
And you just learn so much from them. But, I mean, I just hope that, you know, it continues and
continues to grow. And I can do good for the business. Because I don't want to see, you know,
the dairy industry to, you know, year over year, there's less and less farmers.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:42
Right.
Jill Allen 1:01:44
And just, really helping so that they can continue to do what, I believe is an American, you
know, tradition of...one of the agriculture pieces is dairy farming.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:55
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:01:56
So yeah, I just, just want to make sure that it stays, you know, for the farmers and so...
Jared Schmidt 1:02:03
Yeah, that's pretty cool. One more question before I let you go for at least today, because I'd
love to speak with you again here soon., um, and I want to respect your schedule. What is your
favorite cheese?
Jill Allen 1:02:18
Oh my gosh!
Jared Schmidt 1:02:19
[Laughs]
Jill Allen 1:02:19
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 1:02:19
So you know, what, people always ask me this a lot. And, I always say, "Well, it depends on,
like, you know, what, what event you're at or what dish you're making," 'cuz I love cheese so
much. I have so many [Jared laughs], like, so many favorite cheeses. But, my favorite,so truly
my favorite cheddar is, I love like, of course the English Style Sweet Cheddar is my favorite, you
know, Tillamooks. But, I really love, like, Jasper Hills Harbison and the, it's just a bark, rinded-
beauty that's just amazing. So good! And that's American made as well.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:00
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:03:00
But, I have tons of other like, I,there was a cheese I wanted to try and I got to try it for the first
time this October, Vacherin Mount Dior. And it's a French style, or it's, they can use, it's French-
or Swiss-made style cheese. And it's also a barked beauty as well. But that, that the American,
I, you know, there's so many different American cheese makers that make amazing cheeses,
Jared Schmidt 1:03:32
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:03:32
like so good. Like, just very, very good.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:35
Yeah.
Jill Allen 1:03:35
So.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:35
So, you're gonna sit down, let's say, you're having a special guest over, you pick one cheese to
share. What is it?
Jill Allen 1:03:44
Well, if I had a special, I would, well, I'm bringing the I was...
J
J

Jared Schmidt 1:03:48
Bringing the Cape Mears.
Jill Allen 1:03:49

creating it.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:56
Mhm.
Jill Allen 1:03:56
And I have a story, I like a, like a story behind it. So.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:00
Yeah.
Jill Allen 1:04:00
But I always like to see people tast it like, "What do they?" You know, so...
Jared Schmidt 1:04:04
Right.
Jill Allen 1:04:05
That, I would def, it would be that one.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:08
I like it. As if I'm gonna argue with you on that one [Laughs]
Jill Allen 1:04:13
J
J
J
J
J
Jill Allen 1:04:13
Yeah, no. But, um, yeah, so no, I know, there's, there's just so many. There's just so much
more. I mean, we could probably talk forever, but I do have a meeting at 2:30 and I need to
grab something to eat really quick.
