BULLETIN
 
Editor:  Pete Seeger
 August  1982
 
Editorial Committee:  Carolyn Bevis,  Marilyn Ackerman,  Julie Winter-

ham been prepared,  but there  is not
 
money to  typeset,  print,  and mail  it.
 
Rather than undertake emergency fund
 
raising,  Sing Out! has temporarily
 
suspended publication.
 It has not
 
gone bankrupt.
 Subscribers will re-
ceive  issues due  them eventually.
 
Oreditors will get paid.
 
On June  23,  1982,  the above editorial
 
committee met and decided to bring
 
out this monthly newsletter.
 Its
 
cain purpose  is to involve all  sub-
scribers in a discussion of the  best
 
cay to  solve  this crisis,
 be encour-
age  friends everywhere  to meet,  put
 
n paper their ideas.
 bail your let-
ters to our new address:
 Ring Out!,
 
0.  Box 1480,  Sew York,  SY
 10023.
 
Be concise.
 
Should SO!  continue  to come out five
 
times a year?
 Or should it be an
 
-nnual,  well-rounded journal of 120
 
pa 6
 art
 anould it have  no adat -
 0
 
ads?
 Should it broaden its coverage
 
to more  different kinds of music?
 
Should it concentrate mainly on one
 
or two kinds?
 Ohat kinds?
 
If we don't get enough letters from
 
you,  we will get the message:  you
 
don't think SO!  worth continuing.
 
But present subscribers will receive
 
this newsletter for at least four or
 
five months,  or until a decision is
 
nade.
 Anyone else  con get it regular-
ly by sending R5.00;
 they will also
 
get the next full issue of Sing Out!  
magazine.
 
Temporarily we are returning money
 
sent for new subscriptions to Sing
 
Out! until a new subscription price
 
and publication schedule is decided
 
upon.
 
This space will be  taken in the next
 
issue by letters you send us.

Friends,  this is a second short
 
newsletter.  The regular 49p.  SING
 
OUT!  magazine is ready to print,
 
but won't come out till 4000 readers
 
argue about format,  price.
 
We need,  of course,  thousands of
 
new subscribers, hundreds of new
 
advertisers.  Right now, we welcome
 
your letters.
 
Sing Out will be reborn.  How?
 
Read on.
 
Dear Pete and S.O.B.
 
Got the sob story in the mail today.
 
It was the first magazine I was able
 
to read through,  cover to cover,
 
STANDING at the head.
 
Those of us who still have copies
 
of Sing Out dating back to the first
 
one,  have seen some pretty interest-
ing changes over these years in terms
 
of who and what Sing Out has been
 
for. And I guess that the best way
 
to move on, would be to consider who
 
will the thoughts expressed by Sing
 
Out in the future,  end up being for.
 
The smaller the constituency,  the
 
easier itis to write for them.  What
 
we may have failed to see,  is that
 
the original purpose was to use Sing
 
Out as a way of reaffirming friends
 
and enlisting new ones,  to the ideas
 
that were contained between the pages.
 
 
Sing Out seems to have been
 
written for and by some kind of orig-
inal family, who keeps having kids
 
and their kids have kids and pretty
 
soon there's so many people in the
 
family you be in to lose track of
 
some of them.  If there is any purpose
 
to Sing Out in the future,  I think
 
it must be for the purpose of a fam-
ily reunion of some kind.  To reach
 
out to those who don't remember where
 
they came from and to unite them
 
once again with those who do. And to
 
enlist new folks and other families
 
into what we have grown to be.
 
That's my thoughts for tonight,
 
and I hope that sometime soon I'll
 
able to read Sing Out SITTING
 
an.
 Love from us
 
Arlo and family  (Guthrie)
 
Dear S. 0
.
 
Why not try a children's section
 
for them to submit songs-poems-ideas.
 
.
If an institution, magazine,  gov-
ernment or what have you fails to
 
serve the needs of the people,  it
 
has  to die.
 
Brother F
.D.Kirkpatrick
 
Dear  Sing Out!,
 
.use  SO!  of  the  late  50's  & early
 
60's  for  a model  of  the  new  SO!
 
Write  for  the  perpetual  beginners-
don't  be  an  elitest,  obscure  maga-
zine-that's  SO!'s  real  audience.
 
More  useful  information  about  songs,
 
clubs,  societies,  singers,  and
 
ideas.
 I don't  object  to  political
 
songs,  but  they  must  be  good  songs
 
first!...
 
Michael  Cooney
 
Dear Editor - 
A couple of evenings ago I had
 
some time and went through my carton
 
box of Sing Out!s.  I was surprised
 
by two things:  l)How little the mag-
azine has changed... .2) How little
 
of it I would recommend changing.
. .
 I
 
do have a list of likes and dislikes
 
though.  I like the ads.., the teach
 
In column, .  .
interviews with music-
ians .
.....Publications noted".
 
I am convinced that Sing Out must
 
be published on a more regular basis.
 
Sounds trivial,  but it could be real
 
important.  I'd like wittier and
 
sharper reviews.  I'd enjoy tOe return
 
of a fiery editorial column.. . expand-
ed correspondence,  and not just the
 
congratulatory glop.
 
Warmest regards,
 
Joe Heukerott
 
(For an unusual new song by Joe H.
 
see the back page. We had planned to
 
print it before we got his letter.)
 
Dear S. 0.
 
Please send me another 100 copies

Dear S.O.,  please note!
 
Give us the songs that bring the
 
dead back to life!  Songs that splash
 
light.  Songs like Atahualpa's that
 
excite Serge Rosario,  farm worker,
 
so that he weeps and pounds the ta-
ble and clenches his fist.  Songs
 
that a person would gladly go to
 
jail for singing.
 
Where are those songs that people
 
carve into the earth? Give us the
 
musical genius of Juan Rodriguez,
 
who improvises intricate decimas and
 
aguinaldos every Jan.  5th during the
 
promesa at Dona Rosa's house.
 
Let Sing Out introduce Americans
 
to the genius of Palestinian song.
 
In the words of Yiannos Ritsos:  "The
 
world is full of light behind the
 
closed door.
 
"You've got to open the door."

Now  people,  when  it  comes  to  the  scientifical
 
parts  of  music,  I know nothing  about  it,  but  I
 
can  play.
 And  thank  God  a man who  can't  read
 
the  Bible  can  pray.
 Listen,  a man  comes  into
 
this  world  naked  and  bare.
 He  goes  through
 
this  life  wich  troubles  and  care.
 He  departs
 
from  this  life  I don't  know where.
 But  he'll
 
be  alright  there,  if  he  l
ives alright  here.

DEAR EDITOR:
 
Schenectady, NY
  
I' d rather see a mimeographed
 
Sing Out with content,  than a pret-
tied-up,  once-in-a-while with debts
 
and doubts hanging all over it.
 
Beauty is only skin deep.
 It's the
 
content,  the inner soul,  that counts.
 
Jackie Alper
 
Columbia Univ.
 
New York, N.Y.
 
Songs, mostly American songs,
 
now have become the first internat-
ional language. This is exciting
 
news, but flawed in one way: Too
 
much of this music,  too many of
 
these songs, are poor in quality and
 
nil in content. We don't understand
 
enough about the process of the cre-
ation and the popularization of
 
great songs. We all know how good
 
they make us feel, how they live in
 
us and make us more alive,  but
 
those of us who are deeply concerned
 
with this strange but all-important
 
mode of human inter-communication
 
need to stay in touch, need to have
 
a forum that represents us, need to
 
have a way to interchange ideas.
 
Sing Out, with all of its prob-
lems and limitations,  has served
 
this function. We need to keep go-
ing,  to keep it alive,  to expand
 
its horizons in this time of shrink-
ing goals and ill-founded despair.
 
Alan Lomax
 
SO!  is too young to die.  I am
 
just a little older than the maga-
zine,  so I know.
 
I preferred six issues a year,
 
but.. . .quarterly might be good. Less
 
frequent and it would lose value as
 
a source for up-coming events....
 
.
1 shudder to think of your going
 
weekly.  Weeklies are to wrap fish
 
heads in. Please, no weeklies,
 
please.
 
Do what you have to do to stay
 
alive.. . .Just because this country
 
is wallowing in selfishness and cyn-
icism now doesn't mean it will stay
 
that way.

.Please don't limit the types of
 
music you cover.  I can't count the
 
artists and styles I've "discovered"
 
with your help. . . .raise the sub--
scription rates but please don't
 
stop.
 
Mark Sustic
 
Cambridge, Mass.  
Stir up some more controversy.
 
I used to love the arguments about
 
what folk is and isn't and every-
thing people used to get excited
 
about. . . .There is a need to know the
 
background of the songs we sing.
 
It's a shame how ignorant we are
 
about our own music.
 
Frank Hamilton
 
THIS IS THE THIRD MONTHLY
 
BULLETIN SENT TO THE 4200
 
SUBSCRIBERS TO SING OUT
 
MAGAZINE.  THE REGULAR 48p
 
ISSUE WILL NOT BE PRINTED
 
TILL WE GET MORE LETTERS,
 
ETC.
 
FROM THE EDITORS:
 
Washington, D...
 
You should continue the tradition
 
of doing selected music from the root
 
levels of cultures, focusing on the
 
United States of America but reaching
 
outside when there is a connection
 
and moving from root expressions to
 
contemporary statements of change
 
and struggle that are set in those
 
cultures. It may be good if you came
 
out twice a year with
 different
 
editors.
 Each issue would strive to
 
look at contemporary social, politi-
cal, and economic issues, and pre-
sent music from where the songs and/
 
or affected communities draw.
 You
 
should keep the categories: articles,
 
songs,  teach-ins, obits, events,
 
etc.-- it should be larger but
 
favor the old Sing Out.
 
I would be willing to talk
 
around Washington and head up a
 
committee that would produce a
 
D.C.  issue...
 
There has to be a fundraising
 
event, capable of pulling in $10,000
 
-
 $20,000 annually to make it work.
 
I vote for a Sing Out May Day Con-
cert in New York or D.C.  each year-
or maybe it could rotate.
 
Bernice Johnron
 Reagon
 
(Ed. note: the 2nd paragraph above
 
refers to an idea that perhaps groups
 
in different cities or regions could
 
edit the major part of different
 
issues.
 Faith Petric of the SF Folk
 
Music Club thought it was workable
 
also.
 Emily Friedman of Chicago's
 
"Come for to Sing" was doubtful.)
 
Slaterville Spring, N.Y.
 
.
Continue to come out 4 or 5 times
 
a year... more ads wouldn't bother
 
me.  I think Sing Out should broaden
 
its coverage to include more women's
 
& feminist music, and.. .a wide var-
iety of diverse cultures. . . .Enclosed
 
is my 5 bucks.

Sing Out has Sung Out so long,
 
the people and the land,  don't
 
it fall silent. We need it and
 
message now, more than ever!
 
John Henry Faulk
 
Friends,  since the last issue of S
.O,B., we have moved to a new home
 
in Easton, Pa.
 This move will cut our expenses.
 
Here is a proposal:
 Sing Out could be published, as regular as
 
clockwork,  six times a year.
 Lots of songs--old and new--of a wide
 
variety, columns,  features, ads, etc.
 There'll be enough "traditional'
 
material to satisfy some folks, and enough "contemporary" material to
 
satisfy others.
 No one will like it all.
 That's what civilization is
 
all about; you spread out a big enough covered dish supper,  folks can
 
pick out what they like and ignore the rest,
 
BUT,  subscription rates might have to double.
 You can't afford it?
 
OK,  let's double our circulation.
 Hold a S
.O. party.  Ding songs from
 
old issues.
 Get new subscribers.
 Buy a large quantity of back issues
 
at reduced price.
 Sell them and make a profit.
 Every Singer:
 hold a
 
benefit concert.
 
What we really need is a larger, wider readership.
 That is why we
 
offer a $5 trial subscription to these bulletins plus the next issue of
 
Sing Out.
 You can also get 100 copies of this bulletin for only $10.
 
When will the first issue of the reborn Sing Out appear?
 At the
 
present rate of contribution, next spring.
 If contributions increase,
 
sooner.
 Our goal is to raise $20,000 to resume regular publication of
 
the magazine.
 If each current subscriber could raise $5, or enlist one
 
more subscriber,  then this goal could be reached.
 It can be done.
 Box
 
1071 is waitinf to hear from you.

 Sing Out would be sorely missed.
 
There is no other national magazine
 
which fills this place .. . . It's
 
the tear between traditional .
 .
 .
 and
 
•
 .
 .
 political that is the source of
 
most of our troubles.
 Each one alien-
ates the other, although they shouldn't,
 
they do.
 So I feel that the magazine
 
should be devoted to music made by
 
people in the United States primarily
 
from a neutral point of view represent-
ing a certain amount of the contempo-
rary or topical song movement, but only
 
as part of the informal or folk music
 
creation.
 
Michael Seeger

If you were taking my ad-
vice,  I'd say get that magazine
 
the hell out of New York City
 
and into either (a) a place with
 
an industrial base or (b) a
 
place with community roots or

 As the hard times de-
scend upon us more and more,  our
 
songs need to be available to
 
people for a spectrum of uses
 
ranging from political rallies
 
to singing alone in the bathtub.
 
•
 .
 I'd like to see politic a l
 
(progressive,  loosely defined)
 
folk, bluegrass, as well as
 
classical or jazz pieces which
 
reflect people's stuggles.
 For
 
example, Giuseppi Verdi and his
 
operas played a fascinating part
 
in Italian unification.
 (
I know
 
because I did a primary research
 
paper on that topic.)  .
 
I'd also like to see more atten
 
tion given to children's music
 
that is non-sexist, non-racist.
 
I want Sing Out to continue.

Sing Out has been, for me, a
 
source of delight and richness.  I
 
know of no other magazine that has
 
been so valuable in the world of
 
folksong.  For years I've been look-
ing forward to each issue -
 and I
 
hope I shall continue doing so -
 
indefinitely.

1 fear you have often taken too
 
narrow a view.. . . the folk process is
 
fluid.. . .There is a lot of electric
 
music out there that qualifies in my
 
mind as folk. . . .

Bob Dylan went electric... .don't let
 
inhibition and arch-conservatism
 
strangle what was once a vital pub-
lication.

There is a t
endency towards snob-
bishness among the folklorists and
 
many of  the well-established per-
f
ormers of  the art  and some of the
 
denizens of the eastern seaboard
 
scene.  The affect of this is taking
 
t
he music of the people out of its
 
folk element and making a sort of
 
profession out of it...

We like t
he idea of shuttling edi-
torial t
asks around.  One of our
 
complaints about Sing Outl has been
 
its very strong east coast perspec-
tive. . .
Me agree that there is a
 
need for a national t
hread to tie
 
the various folk music communities
 
across the country together.

Personally I would like t
o see
 
the magazine retain its h
igh stand-
ard of content and production and
 
would suggest t
hat perhaps S

published twice yearly and certainly
 
keeping enough high quality advert-
isements to cover cost of product-
ion. Wishing you every success,

.Distinguish between '
political
 
folitsongs', which have no explicit
 
political message, are sung at folk
 
festivals or in peoples' front
 
rooms, but are political by the
 
implication of t
he story told, and
 
the '
message songs' which are explicit-
ly political, often boring, and sung
 
only by t
he converted. . . "
Children's
 
Cry" is a perfect example of what I
'm
 
talking about. . . lyrics too explicit
 
and too general... to be of any inter-
est except at a large singalong ral-
ly.
. .
 I think t
hat the worst songs my
 
favorite songwriters have written are
 
their message songs -
 eg. Phillips'
 
"
All Used Up"... Sl n go fill (
so
 
long for now)
 
Bill Dorris

my git up and go has got up and
 
gone but the Sing Out Bulletin is
 
damned impressive. The Song,  "
Child-
ren's Cry" a fine contribution to
 
the one and only vital issue of the
 
moment. Fervent good wishes.

A few days back, I went
 
through all of my issues, including
 
the  reprint series,  looking for "The
 
Days of '9."
 I found it.  Good, but,
 
as an introduction to the tune. I
 
had to wade through a-whole bunch of
 
crap about imperialistic ware and
 
their influence on people in the
 
gold f
ields.  Coma on. I am a singer

 "Think Globally, Act Locally."  Paul Robeson and
 
Woody Guthrie were amon& the fo*md.rs of Sing Out magazine 32
 
years ago, and we think they'd approve the selection of songs for
 
this November's S
.O.D.
Each song would be so
ng or listened to by
 
a different group of people.
 
First, the oldest traditional song of this land which we've
 
ever printed.  In 1952, Ray Padden (
Teban.torens), who i
s a Mohawk,
 
told the editor of this journal, "Pete, a lot of our songs are
 
sacred to us and should not be so
ng by a white parson.  But, here
 
is a Se
neca canoe song; I
'd be proud if you'd learn it and teach i
t
 
to others."  Ray has also taught it to folks at pow-wows and other
 
gatherings.  So, it has bac o
ne known among native people of the
 
plains, south and west.  Anthropologist Anthony Seeger (
editor's
 
nephew) writes:
 
"When I was with the Suyl Indiana of northern Hato Grosso,
 
Brazil, in August, the song was sweeping through the whole Xingu
 
region as society after society heard tapes of our singing of it.
 
The Suyl are fascinated by music of all kinds.  They sing songs
 
of people who bc a
ns extinct in the wars of the last century, and
 
songs of native societies that they have encountered since they
 
made peace in 1
959.  Everywhere I went, everyhere the motorboat
 
stopped, and every place I slept; they were asking me to sing
 
"Ka-yo-wa-ji-neh".  Asking me about the sort of people that sang
 
i
t in the USA; how it was that I had'learned it from my uncle.
 
Because of the structure of the song and the vocal style in which
 
it is sung,  i
t is particularly congenial to their own id e
s of what
 
beautiful music is.  The seriousness with which the Suy& listened
 
to the Seneca song is an indication of the new ways they are
 
thinking about the world and the people in it."
 
The song was taught to Ray Padden by Jesse Cornplanter, a
 
Seneca.  I
t's important not to change it; keep that unusual extra
 
beat (
ye-ho) in the middle of the first line.  Sing it high, with
 
a good l
tmgful of air to push it out.  You can hear the style of
 
singing on the Sing Out Radio Bulletin, or on the recordings of
 
Iroquois songs issued by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC
 
Seneca Canoe Song  Trad.

Next,
 
an example of the new Afro-American urban folk poetry
 
known as "Rap".  Useless to try and give music notation for the
 
syncopated, chanted words; the undercurrent in lyric and song is
 
exciting, electric, and a real call to action.  Write to the author,

You know we had to may about the way Mr. Reagan thinks
 
You know we told the whole wide world that Reaganomics stinks
 
He's the opposite of Robin Hood, Reaganomics just ain't no good
 
Are you hip to what we s
ay, if you're not it goes this way
 
Take it from the needy, give it to the greedy
 
That's what Reaganomics say, that's just it Reaganomics ain't hip

But didn't you really know, that you reap what you sow

Take it from the needy, give it to the greedy

• . .Stjck with folk music!
 An oc-
casional tangent might not be too
 
objectionable.
 However... pop,  rock,
 
top 40, and country have good
 
exposure in other organs.. .
Sing Out
 
should price subscriptions abreast of
 
these inflationary times.. .
charge
 
what it's worth!
 
There is a tendency towards snob-
bishness among the folklorists and
 
many of the well-established per-
formers of the art  and some of the
 
denizens of the eastern seaboard
 
scene.
 The effect of this is taking
 
the music of the people out of its
 
folk element and making a sort of
 
profession out of it.
 
Larry Penn
 
Seattle Folklore Society,
 
Seattle, iashirigton
 
.We like the idea of shuttling edi-
torial tasks around.
 One of our
 
complaints about Sing Out!  has been
 
its very strong east coast perspec-
tive. . .We agree that there is a
 
need for a national thread to tie
 
the various 101k music communities
 
across the country together.
 
John Ross
 
This is  the fourth monthly
 
Sing Out  Bulletin,  issued to draw
 
our 4200 subscribers into the pro-
cess of reorganizing our magazine,
 
refinancing it,  and republicizing
 
it so that  it can come out regularly
 
again.
 
The  fifth and  last S
.O.B. will
 
reach you next month.
 Then you
 
won't hear  from us till the  first
 
full,  fat,  fine issue of SING OUT!
 
magazine arrives  in your mailbox.
 
But,  exactly when it arrives,  and
 
how big it will be,  is now up to
 
you.
 We are asking every single one
 
of our  readers to do some sort of
 
fundraising:  A piggy bank on the
 
bookshelf.
 A Sing Out houseparty.
 
A concert.
 A raffle.
 Order a Sing

Personally I would like to see
 
the magazine retain its high stand-
ard of content and production and
 
would suggest  that perhaps S.O.  be
 
published twice yearly and certainly
 
keeping enough high quality advert-
isements to cover cost of product-
ion. Wishing you every success,

.Distinguish between 'political
 
folksongs', which have no explicit
 
political message, are sung at folk
 
festivals or in peoples'  front
 
rooms, but are political by the
 
implication of the story told, and
 
the  'message songs' which are explicit-
ly political,  often boring, and sung
,
 
only by the converted. . . "Children's
 
Cry" is a perfect example of what I'm
 
talking about. . .
lyrics too explicit
 
and too general. . .
 to be of any inter-
est except at a large singalong ral-
ly. . .
1  t
hink  that the worst songs my
 
haven fe :onewri t
ers have written are
 
their message songs -
 eg. Phillips'
 
"All Used Up". . .

.my git up and go has got up and
 
gone but the Sing Out Bulletin is
 
damned impressive.  The Song,  "Child-
ren's Cry" a fine contribution to
 
the one and only vital issue of the
 
moment.  Fervent good wishes.

.go back to the old size.
 I star-
ted buying S.O.  because I could fit
 
it in my back pocket.
 I'd like a
 
monthly... more international music...
 
a quarterly review of radio stations
 
that play folk music.. .
In these harsh
 
economic times a . . . job listing,  i
.e.,
 
classified sector,  migh t not be out
 
of  place.. .There's not enough materi-
al  dealing with folkdance,  folk-
crafts, storytelling.

Sing Out.. .has to survive.. .should be
 
based in folk and if it is to carry
 
pieces on rock and jazz and what-
ever (which I would welcome)  they
 
should not be so numerous as to ser-
iously alter the character of the
 
magazine.. .The radical political
 
stance of S.O.  is also important -  
linking music to politics without
 
being allied to a particular faction.
 
as a primary school teacher I'm in-
terested in homemade instruments.
 
Good wishes.

I have been a subscriber. . .since 1962
 
.Many times I have wondered, . .why
 
I continued. . .
A few days back,  I went
 
through all of my issues,  including
 
the reprint series, looking for "The
 
Days of '49."
 I found it.
 Good.  but,
 
as an introduction to the tune,  I
 
had to wade through a whole bunch of
 
crap about imperialistic wars and
 
their influence on people in the
 
gold fields.
 Come on.  I am a singer
 
of old songs, and I just don't need
 
that crap.

good to hear that S.O.  still wants
 
the article on southeast Alaska folk
 
music.. .
1 propose a general overview
 
.
songs in the fishery,  traditional
 
Indian music, and recently released
 
records and songbooks from the region.
 
I can send photos,  graphics.
 I hope
 
S.O.  picks up the pieces and goes
 
with it.
 This time,  let's avoid
 
party-line politics and "you should
 
believe" tones. . .
In song,

T.G.A.L. -
 'Think Globally, Act Locally."
 Paul Robeson and
 
Woody Guthrie were among the founders of Sing Out magazine 32
 
years ago,  and we think they'd approve the selection of songs for
 
this November's S.O.B.
 Each song would be sung or listened to by
 
a different group of people.
 
First,  the oldest traditional song of this land which we've
 
ever printed.
 In 1952, Ray Fadden (Tehanetorens), who is a Mohawk,
 
told the editor of this journal, "Pete, a lot of our songs are
 
sacred to us and should not be sung by a white person.
 But, here
 
is a Seneca canoe song;  I'd be proud if you'd learn it and teach it
 
to others."
 Ray has also taught it to folks at pow-wows and other
 
gatherings.
 So,  it has become known among native people of the
 
plains,  south and west.
 Anthropologist Anthony Seeger  (editor's
 
nephew) writes:
 
"When I was with the Suy
 Indians of northern Mato Grosso,
 
Brazil,  in August,  the song was sweeping through the whole Xingu
 
region as society after society heard tapes of our singing of it.
 
The Suy$ are fascinated by music of all kinds.
 They sing songs
 
of people who became extinct in the wars of the last century, and
 
songs of native societies that they have encountered since they
 
made peace in 1959.
 Everywhere I went, everyhere the motorboat
 
stopped, and every place I slept;  they were asking me to sing
 
"Ka-yo-wa-ji-neh".
 Asking me about the sort of people that sang
 
it in the USA; how it was that I had learned it from my uncle.
 
Because of the structure of the song and the vocal style in which
 
it is sung,  it is particularly congenial to their own idea of what
 
beautiful music is.
 The seriousness with which the Suya listened
 
to the Seneca song is an indication of the new ways they are
 
thinking about the world and the people in it."
 
The song was taught to Ray Fadden by Jesse Cornplanter, a
 
Seneca.
 It's important not to change it; keep that unusual extra
 
beat  (yo-ho) in the middle of the first line.
 Sing it high, with
 
a good lungful of air to push it out.
 You can hear the style of
 
singing on the Sing Out Radio Bulletin, or on the recordings of
 
Iroquois songs issued by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC

Next,  an example of the new Afro-American urban folk poetry
 
known as "Rap".
 Useless to try and give music notation for the
 
syncopated,  chanted words;  the undercurrent in lyric and song is
 
exciting,  electric, and a real call to action.

December  1902
 
Some years ago... I had nearly 150
 
students, mostly children.
 We had a good
 
crew committed to the notion that every-
body can play music, and should.
 What we
 
were trying to get at was "ear music" and
 
acquiring musical skills that would have
 
social as well as emotional value...
 
In all of this SING OUT was enormous-
ly important to us all...  In SING OUT we
 
had hoards of songs to teach and share...
 
The songs became a vehicle to give the
 
kids some history that they weren't get-
ting in school and a vision of who we
 
are, as seen through the eyes of those
 
who came before, a better, healthier,
 
more useful vision than the one being
 
pumped out by the schools, movies and TV.
 
Our American body of folk song is politi-
cal when you consider the economic and
 
social context from which each song aris-
es.
 (For example) Black music from John
 
Henry to Stagolee is a catalogue of abuse
 
which gives each song meaning on many
 
levels...
 
Now we didn't need for SING OUT to
 
be any more political than that.
 It was
 
subversive enough for us to teach kids
 
real songs about who we are and where
 
come from...
 
But somewhere along the line,  SING
 
OUT decided it wasn't political enough
 
• . . it would lay down the TRUTH,  that it
 
would take a sectarian line which ulti-
mately caused it to be booted out of
 
music stores around the country.
.. SING
 
OUT wound up marginalized somewhere out
 
there with the rest of the alphabet
 
song of the new and old left.
 
For the bulk of its career SING OUT
 
has done heroic service in behalf of
 
that part of our revolution that says
 
"Don't buy it, make it!"  And that's a
 
big step for most people.
 So..  SING
 
OUT was there to help us do it, not to
  
tell us what we should be doing... Let
 
0
 context of the songs and their
 
cries tell the politics.
 Have that
 
ch faith in the power of our music to
 
i
t; own work Fnr a

by and large.
 One t
ling lacking from your

Dear Reader,
 
This  is  the  fifth  monthly S. O. B.
 
be  are  proud  that we  have  gone  to
 
press  exactly when we  said we would
 
each month,  even though  the  post
 
office  has  seen fit  to  deliver us  to
 
you  three  to  nine weeks  later.  You
 
will next hear  from us  in April.
 
Some wonderful  songs  and articles
 
are  lined up already.  Also  reviews
 
of  records  and books.  Info  and dates
 
for 1983 festivals  and events.  Con-
tributors will  not  just be  from the
 
eastern megalopolis,  Boswash,  but
 
also  from £
4i1buff and San-San,  and
 
more  farfiung points.
 
So  far,  about  5
% of our readers
 
have  sent  in letters,  and many have
 
enclosed money,  which  is  why  this
 
S. O. B.  is  larger  than usual.
 
If  the  other  9
5% of you will  fill
 
out  the  form on page  five,  who  knows
 
what  glories  may be  in store?
 
See  you in  the  spring
 
(if we  can get  through
 
the  mattress)
 
The  editors.

I used to think that with a little
 
application I could learn any of the songs
 
or teach-in stuff in SING OUT.
 Seemed
 
like it was just folks doing what I could
 
do too.
 Then, all of a sudden I was faced
 
in each issue with phonetically syllabized
 
lyrics in languages I had no handle on...
 
me, who can barely say "bway-noss notches"
 
• . . Still,  I looked forward to each issue
 
and wish you a speedy recovery or some-
thing.
 Vie-sb Cone Dee-ohss!

We represent SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES,  a
 
project recently formed in Philadelphia.
 
We are convinced that there is a following
 
for songs of struggle and social concern.
 
We would like to hold a benefit concert for
 
Sing Out!  some time in the spring of  1983,

There is a strong grass roots revival
 
of  interest in folk music that SING OUT
 
with the benefit of its thirty years ex-
perience, and deep roots in traditional
 
music,  can encourage, expand, and educate.
 
.Too often bad songs,  that are little
 
more than bumper stickers set to music,
 
are printed for their political content
 
alone...  I
'm not saying abandon politics,
 
just make sure a political song is also
 
a good song.
 
The major change I would like to see
 
is more coverage of local folk scenes
 
around the country.
 The Minneapolis-
St. Paul area where I live has an active
 
folk community with several coffee houses,
 
dance societies and ethnic groups, not to
 
mention Garrison Kielor and The Prairie
 
Home Companion Radio show.
 I haven't seen
 
any mention of this in SING OUT.

.
.Sing Out!  deserves to survive because of
 
the service that it provides to the music
 
community, both in terms of the articles
 
that it publishes and the network it
 
creates,. ,From our end here in Winnipeg,  i
 
will propose to our Board of Directors that
 
we make a substantial contribution to SO!
 
This would be a precedent for the Winnipeg
 
Folk Festival since we also solicit dona-
tions, but this is an extraordinary situa-
tion.  .Perhaps you might consider a monthly
 
bulletin which would contain topical and
 
current information, and a quarterly
 
journal which would be oriented toward
 
scholarly articles, reviews of records,
 
books and concerts as well as articles of
 
political interest,

I don't want you to expire.
 Self-
examination once in a while isn't so bad,
 
though, and all these letters are sure to
 
help you grow.
 
I
'm fortunate that I make my living
 
telling stories and singing songs.
 But
 
like strings on the guitar if they're not
 
in tune,  they don't sound right...  I think
 
this means that for songs or stories to be
 
successful,  they should appeal to a wide
 
audience.. .  not just to a small group of
 
already admiring fans.

ABOUT THE SONGS IN THIS ISSUE:
 It is our editorial policy to try
 
• and touch base with as many sectors of the many peoples of this
 •
 
land as possible.
 Young and old.  Women and men.
 Black and white, :
 
• Singers of slow,  sad songs and singers of fast, happy songs,
 Mad  •
 
:
 
songs and bad songs,
 Old songs and new songs
 Relatively long-
 :
 
• lasting songs, and songs that may soon be out-of-date (But is a
 •
 
souffle the less great work of art for only lasting a minute?)
 
•
 Obviously even a fat,  48-page issue of Sing Out! has a hard
 •
 
• time doing this.
 It's even harder in a slim S
,O,B.
 The committee •
 
selecting these songs had to reluctantly postpone printing some
 
• wonderful songs,  either because we wanted to keep a balance or
 S
 
because they were available elsewhere (
"Only Remembered",  the
 
• harmonious, old religious song collected in the Ozarks by Vance
 S
 
Randolph, was going to be in this issue,  til we found that "Come
 
• For to Sing" of Chicago had printed it last year.).
 We count on
 
you to let us know what songs you'd like to see in print next year.:
 
Sorry Penn writes:
 
My wife Pat, who teaches damaged kids, Downs Syndrome, emotion-
i
lly disturbed, slow starters,  retarded, etc.,  said one night,
 
"[hey sure don't write many songs for this kind of kid."  We had
 
o cookie factory here in Milwaukee that used to hang up a shingle
 
,very week or so —
 Broken cookies!
 Then the people would know
 
thot  they could go and buy 5 lbs.  for $1.25.
 After you got into
 
'co you realized that they tasted just as good as the cookies you
 
hor,5ht in the store and got maybe 8 in a package for 89c,

A HI RT!II)AY SONS
 
Why is it,  that though literally thousands of birthday songs have
 
been written,  it is one very short song written by a New York City
 
schoolteacher in 1893 that we all know today?
 
Mildred J. Hill originally wrote it "Good Morning To All" and a
 
year later her sister Patty adapted it to make it a birthday song, It
 
was published by Clayton Summey Co., a Chicago firm specializing in
 
Sunday School books, and the copyright holds today, which is why we
 
can't print it here.
 
Probably what it doesn't say is the reason for its wide use. How-
ever,
 c S
.O,B,  editors hereby ask our readers what they think of the
 
idea that Yankees could do well to learn Latin America's most wide-
spread birthday song, also used for anniversaries and other personal
 
occasions  (
It's known in a dozen or more slightly different versions.)
 
This version comes to us from Jenny Vincent of New Mexico, who has
 
had success singing it bi-lingually ,
 first in Spanish,  then in Eng-
lish,  then in Spanish again. If only one person was singing,  they
 
would probably (but not necessarily)  sing the bottom note. But trad-
itionally it is sung by groups,  in harmony.

40 ACRES AND A MULE Dt9611
 hy0sca.,B m w1r .
T
r
 
If I am not mistaken I once read
 
Back during that short spell I spent in school
 
Where every slave set free was
 to get
 
For slavin', 40 acres and a mule
 
Now, ain't no
 how much work was done
 
By my ancestors under slavery's rule
 
But
 
sure as hell the total's got to run
 
At least to 40 acres and a mule
 
Now I
'm not sayin'  this to see folks sweat
 
'Cause I'm not bitter, neither am I cruel
 
But ain't nobody paid for slavery yet...
 
About my 40 acres and a mule,..
 
We had a promise but that was taken back
 
And when we hollered it was "Hush, be cool"
 
Well me,  I
'm bein'  rowdy, hot and black
 
I want my 40 acres and a my mule!
 
Don't tell me not to get myself upset
 
Don't look at me like I'm some kind of ghoul
 
Just answer quietly:
 When do I get
 
My goddam 40 acres and my mule?
 
No thanks,  I
'll take my own self out to lunch
 
No thanks,  I'll dig me my own swimmin' pool
 
And lay and play around with my own bunch
 
If I get 40 acres and a mule
 
'Cause interest gotta go on just like rent
 
I may be crazy but I ain't no fool
 
One hundred years of debt at ten percent
 
Per year per 40 acres and per mule
 
Now add that up:
 oohwee, looks here
 
No wonder you call great grandma a jewel
 
Just pay me that and call the whole thing square
 
Yes,  lordy!
 40 acres and a mule!

Maybe the time has arrived when we must
 
cultivate our gardens and relearn how to do
 
things on the cheap.
. . this does not mean
 
less poetry, less spiritual sustenance.
 
How about a love song corner. . the very
 
most beautiful love songs in all languages,
 
maybe get folks to vote for favorites?  How
 
about a page each issue to print the very
 
best songs to get groups singing together,
 
or the great songs about American places
 
(
cities, states, etc.)  This might mean re-
printing some oldies-but goodies, but
 
where's the harm.

I
'd like to see more participa-
tion of African, Arab, and Latin American
 
in SING OUT's editorial process.  Token
 
songs and occasional articles about the
 
colorful by the colorless are good but
 
not enough.  Let us not forget that our
 
present U
.S. system was built and still
 
stands on a foundation of racism and
 
genocide.  Therefore a move toward great-
er respect of different cultural groups
 
is a blow to all aspects of... oppression
 
from racist military intervention to
 
racist unemployment and racist desecra-
tion of the environment.

Jewish New Year comes at  the beginning of
 
it is a time of celebration,  but also of
 
Jl-searching,  re-thinking.  This year it came after
 
o Israeli  invasion of Lebanon and before  the brutal
 
:
;sacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps  in
 
irut were done.
 
The lighting of candles begins every Jewish
 
bbath and most Jewish festivals.  It is also a trad-
on to light candles for those who have died.
 
This song is  one Jew's New Year's prayer;  it's
 
not the only one,  but it's deeply felt.

OR
 
. Was it for this we lit the candles five  thousand times?
 
Was it for this we fought the fascists with our guns?
 
And tonight the flame of shame must burn in every Jewish
 
heart
 
or those who died in the camps of Lebanon
 
ow can we let them do this  in our name?
 
ever again can we let such deeds be done
 
nd tonight the flame  of shame must burn in every Jewish

a non-Jew?  For myself,  coming from  30 generations
 
or more of north Europeans who at best slandered Jews
 
(Merchant of Venice,  David Copperfield)  and at worst
 
shovelled them into ovens,  this song is impossible  to
 
sing unless I add another line".. .Tonight the flame
 
of shame must burn in every Christian heart,  for those
 
After all,  it was so-called Christians  that did
 
the shooting.
 
And if this human race survives,  we will all
 
survive.  Or none.  Perhaps we should sing". . . in every

The many friends and fans of Dick Weissman will be es-
pecially interested in his new book Music Making in America
  
(
150 pp.,
 $
12.95, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 250 Park
 
Ave. So., N
.Y., N
.Y. 10003).  Every member of Hey Rube would
 
find it useful.  Dick is a musician who is also literate and
 
perceptive and goes into detail on the various ways musicians
 
get started, make a living, or fail to make a living.  A "pro-
vocative and engaging book" it says on the flap, and they are
 
right.
 
Florence E
. Brunnings worked in a bank for 42 years.
 
She also liked to collect folksong books and records.  Almost
 
two thousand of them.
 In 1
969 she was annoyed at not being
 
able to locate a song quickly enough.  Ten years and 50,000
 
index cards later she had compiled an alphabetized file of
 
every song.  A publisher got wind of it; now it's The Folk
  
Song Index, a comprehensive guide to the Florence E
. Brunnings
 
collection, Garland Publishing, Inc., 136 Madison Ave., N
.Y.,
 
N
.Y. 10016.  Printed on acid-free, 250-year-life paper, $
75.00.
 
Yes, that's right, 75 smackers.  Unless you o w n  oil stocks,
 
your main hope is to mount a campaign to persuade your library
 
to get a copy...

500 entries at the moment.

Some of the perennial favorite children's songs are obviously
 
derived from Afro-American religious folk songs.
 This is one.
 
(Two others are 'Ain't Gonna Grieve My Lord No More'  and 'Rise
 
and Shine and Give God the Glory, Glory.')  A century ago, some
 
of America's first summer camps for children were adjuncts of
 
religious "camp meetings" which whole families attended.
 And
 
children have a way of making songs their own, adding handclaps,
 
responses, satirical comments.
 In this song,  the two extra
 
words, growled, squeaked, or snorted, are extravagantly acted
 
o ut,  and at the end of each verse repeated cumulatively, as you
 
see below.
 It's a classic.
 Readers:  want to nominate another
 
classic for a future issue of Sing Out?

FOLK PROCESS
 
Sing Out!  prints songs as their authors send them to us
 
But few songs remain unchanged.
 In every issue we try to
 
bring you up-to-date on new words, verses, melodies, rhythms,
 
harmonies.
 Keep in mind that the U.S.  copyright law says
 
that the writer of the original song has the power to stop
 
performance or recording of a change they do not approve of.
 
For example, Di Williams of Manchester, England, who wrote
 
the song "I Took Fair Rosie By the Hand"  (in the Oct.  '82
 
S,O,B,), writes:  "Frankie Armstrong came last Friday as a
 
guest to our folk club... she says she prefers to sing 'they
 
call her Ranting Rosie now.'
 I said,  'Fine',"  Frankie also
 
uses the term 'Fair Rosie'  throughout, rather than say 'Poor
 
Rosie'  at any time.
 
As for new verses, Isabel Martin sends in another verse to
 
"Guantanamera":
 
Para un mundo libre
 
Se necesita tener
 
No racismo ni pobreza
 
iY Is liberacii n de la mujer!
 
For a free world
 
It's necessary to have
 
No racism nor poverty
 
And the liberation of
 
women!
 
Mamie L. Anderson submits the following verse relating
 
"This Land Is Your Land" to the Warrenton P C B  land fill
 
debacle:
 
We said,  "We'll sit here
 
Those trucks rolled up there
 
To lay their waste C o
 
Our precious valley
 
They warned, "We'll jail ya."
 
We said, "We dare ya "
