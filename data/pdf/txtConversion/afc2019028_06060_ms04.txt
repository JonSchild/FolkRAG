Abstract: Barbara James Norman is a 4th-generation blueberry farmer in Covert, Michigan. 
Covert, Michigan is a small village in rural Covert township in southwestern Michigan. Covert 
has an unusual history of racial equality dating back to its founding around the Civil War. 
African Americans have owned land, farmed and been elected to high political office in the 
community since the 1860s (before it was actually legal for them to vote in the state of 
Michigan). Ms. Norman grew up in a completely racially integrated public school system. In 
2003 the USDA honored her as the national small farmer of the year. She has been a leader in the 
USDA small farmers association, as well as organizing with schools in Detroit and Chicago to 
bring large groups of inner-city children to her farm.

ALC: Alright good. 
 
BN: That should be the only important stuff I have to do.  
 
ALC: Oh yeah don't worry about it, this is just life, you know. Okay so we're back and 
continuing Miss Barbara and Norman, Covert Michigan January 15th, 2020 everything's working 
good, okay so now what were we talking about? [laughs] I can’t remember okay alight we were 
talking about relationship with the land...oh! Your first jobs, and I didn’t know you were farmer 
of the year 2003.  
 
BN: Mmm-hmm. 
 
ALC: Okay what was that USDA? 
 
BN:  Yes National. 
 
ALC:  Oh my gosh! Okay.  I would love to see that video. 
 
BN: We went to Dallas Texas yeah I think, each state picks, you know you do the counties and 
each state picks a finalist. 
 
ALC: Yeah. 
 
BN: And so when I was picked, it’s like oh, and so had a video made you had to have a 5-minute 
video Uh they’ve tried to nominate [unintelligible] but so anyway so went to Dallas Texas it was 
the top three. My sister, family went or whatever but had no idea, and they knew when they got 
the top three there who was what, but had no idea and loved it, loved it, loved it. It was really 
amazing and... 
 
ALC: See this is slow it's so slow to happen ‘cause I think the first African-American Farmer of 
the Year at the Indiana State Fair was just last year. First, last year. 
 
 
3 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
ALC: And everybody at the State Fair their jaws were on the floor you know the white folks 
[laughs] 
 
BN: Right and then plus... 
 
ALC: And they couldn't believe it you know. 
 
BN: And plus Statewide doesn't make it to National I think they send like ten out of the fifty, and 
then it's narrowed down to three. 
 
ALC: Mmm 
 
BN: So it is an honor to be National. Then under one of the secretaries of AG I think it was under 
the Val Sack [presumed spelling] When different ethnic groups was rising up and trying to be 
counted we went to one thing and they separated Nationally. It was at a USDA thing in Kansas I 
believe but they had a Hispanic farmer of the year and they had a Black farmer of the year and 
they had, they had maybe three. And it turned out it only happened one time.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: Because each group out of USDA, each group has a, but the strongest...and USDA used to 
support this, There were professional people in AG groups and Blacks had one and then the 
Hispanics wanted to have one and whatever and USDA took their money out the only ones that 
was big enough and bad enough to sustain is the Black.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: National professional AG employees.  
 
ALC: Yeah, and what I’m not sure what this refers to so what is this event you’re talking 
about… 
 
BN: It's the workers of USDA.  
 
ALC: Okay.  
 
 
4 
BN: And the people who do the land National Resource Conservation Services and it’s so 
amazing now...I am Black. Born bred and I'm going to stay,  I'm not going to change. They can't 
change my name anymore I'll only be negro, colored, or Black. I'm not African American. 
 
ALC: Mmm. Okay.  
 
BN: Because to me... and this is a different subject but it's important to me. You know I've 
watched them change the Mexicans or the Spaniards, or Spanish two different times. When you 
get ready for what you think is politically correct or what you want to do this year, you can't 
change my name every year. 
 
ALC: Mmm mmm mmm. 
 
BN: Now when I was born there were people they were colored. Then negro became the thing 
then we were Black, so that's good. 
 
ALC:  Well that's actually a question I ask every single farmer I interview: how would you prefer 
to be identified? 
 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
ALC: I ask every single, everybody says something a little different but that's all that matters. 
 
BN: Right.  
 
ALC: So how would you prefer that you would be known?  
 
BN: If I had to qualify what I'm known by, it's not that I don't recognize ancient history that our 
roots some came from Africa, although mine had some diversity with the South and what they 
were doing to people in the South the white people and whatever.  
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: But the reason that I don't want to [unintelligible] is that I resent...it goes along with me 
owning my own land and can make my own rules...I resent that a group of people in Washington 
or whatever can decide that well today you're Black or you’re negro, tomorrow you're African 
American so next year I might want you to be ABC. 
 
[5:00] ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
 
5 
BN: It's the fact that I'm not giving you that much power over me and I'm not so radical and I've 
never been a woman's lib or anything like that but I don't need a country to have power just for 
the sake of I can change things to call me one thing today and something else tomorrow. So I do 
relate to colored in the south and negro I think they were kind of interchangeable during some 
period. And I relate to Black ‘cause that's what you want to call me when you're upset. You 
either want to call me black or you want to call me N***** [racial slur]. In my growing up and 
then the dictionaries we read N***** [racial slur] doesn't insult me, ‘cause some dictionaries it 
says somebody who's ignorant of the fact, or a hillbilly or a low-class something, so that doesn’t 
bother me, you won't just... if you think you're disrespecting me that's you.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: I know who I am and I know whose I am. But growing up in Covert all of that didn’t come 
into place. One of my best girlfriends going up through school was a German girl. We called her 
Tina her real name was Gurteen or something like that but her grandmother could make the best 
pastry. And we were classmates, so all of that stuff doesn't get me.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: With the barriers that USDA has now with the people, with the farmers in the Midwest, is 
great. But I don't have that all woe is me you doggin me out ‘cause I'm Black. I don't have that, 
even though I know the playing field is not level I know I'm intelligent enough if you give me 
the program I can learn to walk it.  
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm, yeah yeah.  
 
BN: But some people who’s lived in a predominantly all Black area all their life or all white area 
that's where your prejudice and your, the bad feelings come be’cause they're not building 
relationships. I grew up with the diversity when a kid…the Mexicans who are mostly here 
they’re not Hispanic, they speak dialects, ‘cause I lived in Oaxaca seven weeks or so, but they 
came in the spring to work the land and they left at Halloween. So there were Mexicans here and 
I don't really call them Hispanics. ‘cause most of them are my friends and so and they're from 
Mexico! 
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: They're either from Mishawaka [presumed spelling] or Oaxaca.  
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm and you know that. 
 
 
6 
BN: Right. 
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: So all those things don't bother me but I do see the system and I do see the plight of the 
Negroes. 
 
ALC: Be’cause you were saying for a lot of people there's not a level playing field.  
 
BN: It's not as far as programs and whatever. But I also find when I did a project with barriers, 
barriers are the same whether you’re Black, white, Indian or whatever and it's the relationships 
and lack of knowledge. 
 
ALC: Mmm. So going back to your first job and you were starting to talk about being taught to 
hunt. Now that was fairly unusual to teach a girl to hunt in those days. 
 
BN: Well I was the only one of the next generation on the farm. My mother oh my goodness! 
Mmm-mmm she wasn't going in the field my grandmother wasn’t always she knew she did 
anything to work and make money and they were entrepreneurs but uh, same as in the Summers I 
learned to drive a cab I got a chauffeur's license in Chicago whatever my family did. And my 
grandmother always told me baby whatever your husband does do it. If it's driving a Zulu plane 
know it, you know. So hunting they did it was a sport with them plus they ate wild game. I grew 
up liking rabbits my grandfathers best meat was a squirrel my grandmothers was chickens we 
had chickens on the farm every day when it was in season, everyday we’d kill a chicken he’d 
give me a rabbit and he'd have squirrel or rabbit. I grew up I fixed two or three meats in the 
family now when my children was home it was nothing for us to have two things. Be’cause I 
grew up and that's why I think the land I almost want to say land of plenty ‘‘cause I hear a lot of 
kids saying yeah you know you ate whatever was fixed and all of that we you know we didn't do 
that and it wasn't wasteful ‘‘cause a squirrel or rabbit could last two days it's only three people 
are eating.  
 
ALC: Yeah yeah.  
 
BN: But be’cause it was on the land, and you know so we could he could shoot and with my 
uncles I loved going in the woods I love going in the field I could only shoot a 22 shotgun. I had 
one of my uncles the youngest uncle left me, gave me, and in fact bought it new for me when he 
got one but yes that was a part um... 
 
[10:00] ALC: And when did you start really going out and hunting with them? 
 
 
7 
BN: Well the squirrels and rabbits was always daytime hunting and whenever any of ‘em came 
up ‘‘cause different ones would come, that was a form of money with my grandmother we didn't 
have that you know some families are if you have a business just like with your books. If I'm in 
your family and you write a book and they’re for sale, I don't think I'm automatically entitled to 
it be’cause that's a part of your livelihood. So when my uncles would come up they would take 
turns and maybe two would come at once and they would stay at the farm. So my grandmother, 
or even some of our cab drivers and later years, so my grandmother was the cook and the 
housekeeper. So if you came and stayed a week you might want to give her, a stay of three or 
four days whatever your stay was, you'd probably give her a hundred dollars or fifty dollars 
depending on what was considered good at the time.  
 
ALC: Right right 
 
BN: You've got three meals she's going to make your bed, wash your sheets and do everything. 
Me and my great-grandfather, papa we're going to clean the animals when you and y'all come in 
and in the evening he's going to be on the back porch and I'm going to be there holding the ends 
of the squirrels. I know you got to skin it carefully, don't break that skin and all the different little 
things so that was a way of making money also and those were values that was instilled in me. 
And that was instilled in them to, you know help or do what you're supposed to do and if you're 
going to sell squirrels. Now my hunting career stopped be’cause I went, I had gone before a 
couple times before I-96 was built and they were possum or coon hunting. First couple of times 
were fine but one night my grandfather and my other uncle, uncle Roscoe [presumed spelling] 
they were coon hunting down near the end of our land off where there's a high now. But one of 
the dogs went off after a deer or something, and he didn't come back, one of the hunting dogs. So 
we had to stay in the woods my grandfather would not leave his dog so we stayed in the woods 
predominantly all night 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: Until this dog came back found his way back. So I announced that morning or that day at 
breakfast or lunch or dinner or something that probably the night was for the animals and I was 
not going hunting at night anymore. 
 
ALC:  Okay. 
 
BN:  But now one of my hunting things a possum was running up a tree and before they could 
get they guns I'm grabbing its tail and pulling him out and they're hollering “don't grab his tail!” 
but I did. So it was just a nature is just a part of me and I love it to this day so you know. 
 
ALC: [laughs] This is, these are really important stories. So you knew your great-grandfather. 
 
8 
 
BN: And my great-grandmother. 
 
ALC: So that means they lived a while, and I know we've talked about this a bit in the past you 
even brought in a physician to talk about this and the fact that it's widely acknowledged that 
today people of African descent here in the United States have, live less years then people who 
are considered Caucasian. But what I keep hearing from a lot of these farmers is how long people 
lived. So could you just tell me how long your great grandparents lived and how long your 
grandfather lived? 
 
BN: Okay,  now my great-grandparents were born in the 1800s the late 1800s and I can 
remember my younger sister did a history thing and my great-grandmother was her history 
book... 
 
ALC: Mmm! 
 
BN: And she got a A and ‘‘cause you know it was stuff out of the 1800s that big mama was 
telling her and stuff and we always laugh and remember that but they were born in like 1888 or 
somewhere in there before the turn of the century and I knew as a child that my grandfather was 
going to outlive my grandmother be’cause his side of the family even though they was mixed 
they grew up as Black but, and I used to think my great-grandmother was Indian be’cause of her 
cheekbones but they’re just straight Black and then whatever and as I got older I got old enough 
to kinda know some of the family secrets.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: Be’cause my, one of my older uncle's my grandfather's oldest brother he read all the time 
and he drove a cab so my grandfather but they said [unintelligible] he would always have a 
newspaper and he was always reading and this is when I heard the story about this grandfather, 
their grandfather which was an old white school teacher. 
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm. 
 
BN: Big Mama and aunt [unintellible] I guess they had been in that you know the mother this 
white man had this woman they weren't in slavery actually but their folks knew about slavery 
be’cause that's how their grandfather wind up being this old white man. 
 
ALC: Ahh. 
 
 
9 
[15:00] BN: So most of the Simmons and the… and it was two sisters my great-grandmother and 
her sister my great-grandmother had twelve children her sister had sixteen and so they lived 
down and next door in the South or whatever but they weren't a part of the slavery thing but their 
mother was so they had the hair and fair skin and all of that but the lifestyle in the South I guess 
didn't make that made prevalent or important with them they grew up as Black people. 
 
ALC: Mmm mmm mmm. 
 
BN: And they really were Black. 
 
ALC: Yeah yeah. 
 
BN: You know whether what society says is good hair or whatever you know they had all of that 
or whatever but they had these regular strong black values and work ethics and all that so. Fast-
forwarding ‘cause my great-grandparents my family is buried up in the cemetery. 
 
ALC: In the Covert cemetery. 
 
BN: In the Covert cemetery... 
 
ALC: Wonderful good.  
 
BN: My great-grandfather died in 1968, the year my son was born, in Chicago. So that made us 
bring big mama she came up here and she died up here. Oh she must have lived ten or fifteen 
years after him you know but the kids took care of her or whatever. 
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: And so family history and this is digressing again, you can cut any of this you need to cut. 
 
ALC: Mmm it's only up to you. 
 
BN: But Big Mama was here and she...no I like my story I love it you see how my lips are 
flapping, but she died up here so when Big Mama died these guys decided well my dad is over 
there in Bur Oak Cemetery this shows you they were comfortable, ‘‘cause who else would do 
this. They says, and my uncle up here and my aunt which is my grandfather's sister she's one of 
those Simmons when he had to move up here when they moved him, my aunt and her husband 
from the south, he never wanted to be a farmer he wanted to be in Chicago but he didn't get a 
house get a house they lived on the farm and took care of me for while my grandfather was 
making money and coming up here but anyway long story short when he got the house in Covert 
 
10 
he bought eight or ten cemetery plots which they said was $0.50 back then anyway, so after my 
great-grandmother died up here they says well shoot my dad's over there and Bur Oaks and we 
know dead is dead but anyway they exhumed his body and brought him here.  
 
ALC: From Bur Oak Cemetery [voices overlap]. 
 
BN: In Chicago and put it besides Big Mama so there's my great-grandfather, my great-
grandmother then my grandparents, my mother... 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: My stepfather and it's a whole we've got about sixteen people out there. 
 
ALC: And so this is when you talk about connection to the land, the connection to this area of 
Michigan it’s deep I mean it's not just farming it's literally grounded. 
 
BN: Right, right and so then some of my uncles and everybody then there's, there’s about three 
generations of us ‘‘cause my cousin her daughter died and her mother's up here so she naturally 
her daughter was a teacher in Atlanta but she wind up being here. Never had lived here but 
everybody the farm was like grounding for our family. 
 
ALC:  Now here's a question about the farming ‘‘cause at some point you took over the family 
farm how did that happen? 
 
BN: My grandmother, got sick but my grandfather all the Simmons and some people say that's 
the oh crazy bloodline they had trouble with cataracts so my grandfather was going blind and I 
always did the farm with him and that was part of... my kids and my grandkids everybody know 
my grandfather was famous for giving everybody in his family their first job.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: They'd come up in the summer my uncles would come and hunt and my aunts would come 
and can and could get fruit and do all of that. I grew up shaking the pear tree for them to get the 
whatever you know, my great-grandfather in the back of the field years ago, and this is going 
back to when we first started doing the blueberries, he planted nine pear trees one for each of his 
sons.  
 
ALC: That’s sweet.  
 
 
11 
BN: And then during years during my time or whatever after, before Papa was gone gram  
started letting them they some kind of way didn't get enough good treatment and while he 
planted them in sand for one it wasn’t a good soil it was just sand when we didn't have blueberry 
fields coming and so the trees kinda died and so papa said yeah [unintelligible] my sons. And my 
grandfather wind up saying it my grandfather died a youngin ain't going to do right be’cause he 
has let his dad's pear trees die back there. But we had pear orchard so anyway my grandfather I 
always farmed I started driving the tractor like I was on the tractor steering it at five or six 
literally 
 
ALC: Well that's not easy ‘‘cause you have to do the how to reach the gears. 
 
[20:00] BN: I couldn't do all that at first but I got to ride a couple of years just sitting by him on 
the fender and whatever ‘‘cause I actually wind up driving and inheriting the first tractor I drove 
with which is a 56 Ford and in 56 I wasn't even ten I had to be eight or whatever you know so I 
kept doing it and since I loved it it was never a problem with me going out and so that kept on so 
then my grandfather started I took him to get a cataract surgery when it was first getting popular 
or whatever and I was always just he’s my heart. So just farming and then he started getting 
blind and my my grandmother did more you know we had the pickers or whatever and I just kind 
of walked into it but anyway so my grandmother I knew and she always moved kind of fast and 
she could really multitask I knew he was going to be the longest liver and she was from a family 
of eight now she tells me she didn't like the fields and her mother and them had to pick cotton 
and her brothers and sisters she says at five and six she was fixing the family meals. She says her 
mother would make her a circle on the ground and she put a line for that 12 o’clock and so when 
the sun got there she knew to start the food.  
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: And she was a heck of a cook. They didn't live like my grandfather and them did but 
anyway when they came South and when she married and they got to the city or whatever 
whatever he did she was right there with him so anyway long story list my grandfather was blind 
at seventy-five but my grandmother died she had a massive stroke in ‘87 January ‘87 and she 
died August of ‘87 so that meant I'm already here so my two sisters from Chicago came so I did 
the fields and the farm and my one sister did the books and my other sister, but they put trails 
and [unintelligible] on the land for them to live so we did that for a while. But my grandfather 
lived till ‘94 not ninety-four years old ninety-four years in age he was eighty something.  
 
ALC:  Okay so this was 1994. 
 
BN: Mmm-hmm.  
 
 
12 
ALC: And he was about eighty-seven okay yeah.  
 
BN: Mmm-hmm, but my great-grandparents lived longer be’cause my great-grandfather lived till 
like ninety-two and ninety-three and died up here and pop it wasn't his late eighties ‘‘cause he 
died in ‘68 but I attribute that to lifestyles and my grandmother she did [unintelligible] and my 
grandfather never really rushed or nothin. This man got up every day and went out. He did more 
with that farm with one day worker than I do with a crew. But he was going to eat a bite of food 
he was going to eat breakfast he was going to eat some oatmeal drink some orange juice 4 glass 
of milk or water he was a statue of a man never had an ounce of fat nothing just healthy had his 
own teeth but then when his eyes went that was be’cause of the cataracts or whatever but he was 
going out to the field and going out to work his land keep his land looking good like now the 
way covid works a lot of these trees. Everybody's land was manicured then not just our but 
everybody whatever you owns you kept it all. All this stuff about the roads and growing up like 
this that wasn't when I was a kid. So he’d go out and at 12 o’clock the factory bells in South 
Haven, you could hear the horn blow for lunch up there he will come in my grandmother had his 
lunch ready he would lay down for 30 minutes might not sleep but I can see him laying on his 
back sometime meditating maybe praying whatever he did but he took some rest and then he 
went back to work till dinner time and he wasn't rushing it wasn't like he had nobody pushing 
him or he had to do this he might just be chopping part of a row whatever he needed to do was 
always comfortable. Once he had his day worker, Reverend Franklin he lived in Covert, my 
grandfather went in for lunch one day he said [unintelligible] you want to go in for a bite to eat 
he said no Rev. I'm going to finish my row. He said my wife got plenty, he said no I got 
[unintelligible] lunch imma finish my row. When my grandfather got back the man has finished 
his row and he had died. He laid down at the end of the row and died his family was from Covert 
I knew his granddaughters and great-grandkids or whatever but he died in the field and that's 
what he was telling him. Then he got another one but so the history and the Covert is far  
different Covert is, catalog said that Covert is a quaint little town Township with unique little 
problems with how they described it when I first when Dr. Ray first brought  
 
[25:00] catalogs to Covert so farming is just in it but it was easy for people and my grandfather 
never participated in no government programs. I wind up with a government loan be’cause I had 
to learned the program and they start trying to trying to come in and and identify and Covert was 
a gravy train to all the government people when all of this, you’ve gotta service minorities and 
you need someone, they didn’t know any, they never touched any. So then they found me it well 
this was like a plus ‘‘cause I can talk to this lady and you know she's got Black people Mexican 
people you can give me thirty, fifty people how ever many you want I can you know we want to 
learn. So you know I wind up with more equipment than my grandfather had in a lifetime and 
now the farm was better kept at some point you know but so he came out of the South with not 
all these government programs not knowing about USDA although USDA was not new, It just 
wasn't open to the people of color  
 
13 
 
ALC: Yeah right.  
 
BN: But he grew up in an era where you learned to do yourself. Never Social Security card never 
a job he worked two hours...one of my uncles went up here to the factory. And my grandfather 
went up there and stayed two hours she has always he was a self-made man. And I have lived 
well and to be able to say at seventy-one and a half I have always been able to live on the land of 
my family owned in two states 
 
ALC: Now I want, this is all tied into the farming but it's something I’m intrigued in especially 
as a parent by something you said. You have a heart for kids and for education and I want to get 
to that in a minute be’cause you've really used your farm as a base to educate. But you said 
something very intriguing to me about your grandfather, you said if you were a kid and you were 
at his house he would not hit you. He used his voice he used his speaking to discipline. That's 
fairly unusual from that period no matter what the race of the family is can you tell me maybe 
did he ever even talked about that decision about why he didn't hit and talked instead about, I 
mean ‘‘cause it's obviously was a lot of discipline you know its a very disciplined family, but 
what was that like? 
 
BN: It wasn't needed and he had a voice was teaching people and even as a minister he never 
wanted to be a pastor but he was a minister. And he did God's work but the church up here 
needed a pastor or whatever... 
 
ALC: What church was that? 
 
BN: It was in the first book Mehsana [presumed spelling] had First Baptist my grandfather and 
my uncle was in there. 
 
ALC: Okay okay. 
 
BN: And my uncle they needed a pastor my grandfather but be’cause of the life, my grandmother 
didn't hit me I never had whooping, but anyway it was just a lifestyle like I say if you can get up 
didn't have to do a lot of chores it wasn't a lot of kids so my grandmother loved him making that 
was her and she loved my grandfather oh my god did she love this man! And so it was like it was 
a pleasure in that house she enjoyed she came from that era that was a woman's job now she had 
a job one summer in Chicago my grandfather never did and she worked for this one this bowling 
alley came ‘‘cause she loved to cook she was an excellent cook and she loved salads and stuff 
and deserts but anyway so it was never much that you could do. He was big and now he's the one 
that started everybody with a college education. 
 
 
14 
ALC: Mmm 
 
BN: He always said as we get older you know by these things for these kids if you put that 
money in a job for a college education and he always wanted College grads. he sent his first 
brother to that came up here to a junior college and crane Junior College in Chicago, the one that 
wind up being in the cab company with him so that education was important and if you can get 
up you eat you know the routine you know you go out and play you go to school, you know 
some people had dressy clothes or for church. My grandmother's philosophy was you spend 
more time in school, maybe in church than you did anywhere else. So whatever I had I wore at 
school I was always well-dressed and it wasn't to go to school and well the kids up here were 
really bad ‘‘cause we knew nothing to do. You know we played ball if you went visiting it was 
usually outside playing even in the snow. So it was never discussed and it was never needed I 
can remember I think if anything with my grandmother I can remember her telling me one time 
once or twice and it's  
 
[30:00] probably me talking in school or something ‘‘cause I was spoiled. Imma bring you down 
a button or two lower, never happened! I can remember my youngest daughter my grandmother 
was still living she opened some gum that was my son's we were up here and when my 
grandmother was coming in the room she put the wrappers behind the couch and she's my 
psychiatrist now she's my author and all of that and so when my grandmother says what you 
doing and she put and saw it. She says I’m gonna whup you! And my daughter look at her well 
do it, and I guess she even knew that there was no whooping and my grandmother turned called 
my mother and told her, my mother says what did you do. I tell you she didn't do anything but 
made a promise, but with me outside on that land I loved everything I was doing so they never 
really had to discipline me. And I was [unintelligible] I never got caught with anything I did at 
school either.  
 
ALC: [laughs].  
 
BN: You know there’s two sides to that story. My friends know we could kind of be mischievous 
and then we had a party line during that time. Our roads was dirt but kids you didn't have to have 
a license to drive a tractor so this family down the road Anthony was my age he came and 
worked for my grandfather in the field and his dad sent him out to do different... so we could 
meet on the tractor and do, or we walk to each other’s. I don't think too many kids in my area got 
whoopings or got licks be’cause it was a different way of life, excuse me, I really do believe that.  
 
ALC: So you took over the farm approximately when? 
 
BN: 19... my grandmother died in 1987. 
 
 
15 
ALC: Okay. 
 
BN: So 1987 and then we were here whatever my mother didn't want any part my grandfather 
remarried really quick to a lady who we kinda adopted so for four or five years I didn't do the 
farm of course here's a poor lady with ten children and she thinks she has a gold mine. So it was 
a little stressful during that period. But my grandfather had always said you know when you get a 
wife you're supposed to take care of her and we felt that way he didn't buy her a ring my mother 
gave her one of her rings so you know but he knew upon his death and by then I had some uncles 
and stuff that had land on the farm you know they never separated or anything be’cause it is 
understood you know but this lady she kinda thought it would be different so five or six years as 
long as he lived with her and he was blind then I didn't do as much on the farm but I still was in 
the area. But I still had, I had ten acres of my own from my mother.  
 
ALC: You did? Okay.  
 
BN: Mmm-hmm ‘cause the last twenty-five acres that my grandfather and my mother bought 
together. He when her husband died she didn't want no parts and my grandmother was dead so I 
had that ten acres and anyways I still still was there. 
 
ALC: So was farming only thing you did or were you also like did you go to college did you 
were your teacher? 
 
BN: Yes I went to college twice.  
 
ALC: Okay.  
 
BN: My grandfather always wanted us to have degrees but when I first went I really don't think I 
wanted to be there I just thought I knew everything I needed to know and so I... 
 
ALC: It's pretty normal for that age [laughter] 
 
BN: Yeah I went to Western Michigan University but then I stopped I got married to keep from 
finishing College be’cause if you were in school in that era you wasn't considered grown. I could 
remember coming in the house at my mother's and with some adults and they stop talking and I 
had to be twenty or nineteen you know I was in college and they act like it was a eight-year-old 
coming in the room. So in order to not go to college then I did get married so they could think I 
was growing and could make my own rules but then I went back as a non-traditional student and 
I took an AG major... 
 
ALC: Good for you.  
 
16 
 
BN: At Western, and I learned a lot and it was really beneficial and it kind of helped with what I 
already knew had I taken maybe a clip test I probably would have could have tested out to a 
Bachelors. 
 
ALC: Oh sure right right.  
 
BN: But it wasn't really important to me and my grandfather stressed education and I was whip 
smart. I didn't have to study. And so it wasn't that important be’cause I grew up with these 
entrepreneurs in the family 
 
ALC: Well they sound absolutely brilliant actually.  
 
[35:00] BN: and my youngest daughter got it ‘‘cause I can remember for her ninth birthday her 
dad she wanted a popcorn machine so at nine years old this kid is sitting in the front yard on that 
Country Road selling popcorn and lemonade. Now she went straight through she had a plan she 
went one day she left Covert went to Talladega for undergrad, day of graduation we going on to 
Huntsville be’cause she’s getting her masters at ANM or whatever and she always she was 
gonna be a psychologist and then she did her PhD but she winds up getting my granddaughter at 
twe;ve whose mother got killed in a car accident. So she took off then she dropped out and she's 
a mortician at a funeral director but she never did that but she never finished her PhD but she's 
written a book she's very successful but she's always had that entrepreneur spirit.  
 
ALC: See that's interesting be’cause there's been a study lately that says it's not just intelligence 
in young people, it's about drive. It’s about self-confidence and persistence  and this is what I'm 
hearing over and over again these narratives that are instilled over generations of sort of making 
a way and going for it and it's just amazing, it's wonderful it's wonderful 
 
BN: ‘‘cause it was instilled in her but so and I’ve changed my way now I had maybe seventeen 
or eighteen success stories from the kids from Covert be’cause once I started doing outreach for 
USDA I came across this 1890s program and I can get almost any kid in college and the money 
is there and all of that. But now I've learned to change my spiel be’cause my during my era and 
even with my daughters, students think they have to go to school with Black students for their 
parents or that's what you do so I realize now that's not why you're going to college. I want you 
to go to be able to better take care of yourself one, but I want you to learn everything you need to 
know about what you want to do! My granddaughter wants to be a veterinarian. I don't need you 
to go to college for me ‘‘cause what I am today I'm just about going to be in that area tomorrow. 
But I need you to learn now you been doing animals and you like plants and all that and you've 
been on the farm but you really need to know the science of being a vet. That's what you're 
furthering your education for. It’s not be’cause I want you to go and so that's what if I've spread 
 
17 
be’cause now you have these people and I've had teachers when I was in the school system just 
say college ain't for everybody. I resent if you have a PhD or bachelor's and a master's and you 
make that sacrifice and whatever you do your title is going to have something to do with the 
funds you get for it. Now your a passion might make you do something for next to nothing 
be’cause that's your passion. 
 
ALC: Right right. 
 
BN: And your you feel this is important just like I do but basically if you had to take a job you 
would get paid far more with that doctorate then you would with the GED and you would get 
treated better and you know more! Even all this so to me that's my spiel now. I you know I want 
them to understand why their degree is necessary be’cause your knowledge will be better and the 
jobs that the kids are going to get now it's not even invented. Nobody's going to come and sit at a 
desk and do all this mess twenty years from now even ten years from now. So that education is 
important even with farming they've got the tractors that do the rows and you could do you 
know... 
 
ALC: Well tell me about the way that you started your farming to do outreach to bring ‘‘cause 
I've heard a little bit of all about you bringing kids in from Detroit or Chicago but tell me how 
that got started like what inspired you and when did that start ‘‘cause I don't know that much 
about it and I know people are going to be interested.  
 
BN: Okay back then Western was doing the hands-on science program for one, but I started a 4-
H group be’cause my kids always had to work the farm. Growing up in my era everybody was in 
4H and everybody was in FFA. 
 
ALC: So were you in 4-H too?  
 
BN: I was in 4-H I was in Girl Scouts… 
 
ALC: Was it integrated? Was it racially integrated?  
 
BN:  Of course I was in Covert! 
 
ALC: [laughs] See but this is going to knock people’s socks off! 
 
BN: I got in trouble with Pearl Sanders [presumed spelling] she was my girl scout teacher and it 
was after I'd flown up yeah I was a brownie first and my girlfriend had did something to me she 
was my friend and I went to snatch the chair for a laugh but Judy fell on the floor. 
 
 
18 
ALC: Uh oh. 
 
BN: And what Pearl Sanders I got in trouble twice with her...well actually three times... 
 
ALC: She was a white teacher in the area. 
 
[40:00] BN: She was my kindergarten teacher and that's the only lick it ever got in my life she 
told me not to go off the little thing it was raining and muddy and we didn't have on boots and I 
went off and get on the slide or something. So when I came in and she put me over her knee, and 
she popped me a couple of times. And as a... 
 
ALC: [laughing] Oh no Pearl can’t believe she did that! 
 
BN: Well you could whoop kids in Covert as an adult we would be in the swimming pool and I 
teased her all my life until she stopped me once I was older she was..says you the only whooping 
I ever got you spanked me. So one day she said you always tell me that Barbara, but tell me what 
did I teach you?  
 
ALC: Hmm. 
 
BN: And I said you know that saying everything I needed to know I learned in kindergarten. I 
said you always taught me I always loved you but you still spanked me. So that ended me telling 
her that be’cause she came back with something very powerful. Don't worry about that little one 
or two licks, and it didn't hurt! But what did I teach you and that's the kind of thing we came up 
in. ‘cause see [unintelligible] was my classmate. 
 
ALC: Okay when you, when did you start bringing...  
 
BN: Children. 
 
ALC: Children out to your, out to the farm? 
 
BN: I started with my grandchildren and then my sisters three and my other sisters one. My 
grandkids always had to do a garden and they'd have to bring them water jugs out ‘‘cause we 
didn't have irrigation or whatever and be’cause I did 4-H and did Future Farmers well the 4-H 
lady was dead. And so Girl Scouts was dying out after Pearl Sanders didn't do it and I had to 
[unintelligible] to get that. Oh probably elementary? ‘cause I got my sister’s three well it was 
hands on science. And then 4-H went and then when I found out my daughter was in 4th grade 
they went in 4-H and so I knew that 4-H had a million dollar insurance policy on all the kids that 
belonged so if you took ‘em somewhere but when Dorian was in first grade 4-H was making A 
 
19 
movie called spaces. And it takes kids from all over this area to go to Farmington Michigan 
which at that time had one of the biggest movie studios out. And so they picked my daughter and 
a kid from Covert so we went up there. And in spaces... 
 
ALC: So there's a 4-H movie called spaces I haven't even heard of this wow okay.  
 
BN: It had to be so Dorian graduated in ‘95  and if she was in fourth grade had to be... 
 
ALC: Some point in the 80s? 
 
BN: Yes uh huh.  
 
ALC: Okay yeah alright.  
 
BN: And then there was no Blacks doing the fair. Well we rode horses and Dorian barrel raced 
with me. She's my daughter that does everything I do.  
 
ALC: So did you Barrel Race? Oh I had no idea!  
 
BN: Oh my God. There's pictures at the I got to ask David if he’ll find some of those things... 
 
ALC:  I want some of those photos I do! 
 
BN: Oh yeah and we had a horse club and we traveled  
 
ALC: Let’s wait for this phone to finish just a sec ‘cause that’s gonna...hang on.   
 
BN: [unintelligible] Van Buren United Civic Organization how can I help you?  
 
ALC: Pause it.  
 
ALC: Hang on, okay we're recording on here, We're back we're back. Som so you and I know we 
were talking about okay so we just start talking about the horse racing and I want to get back to 
that be’cause you barrel raced... 
 
BN: Yes.  
 
ALC: And I had no idea, and at the county fair. 
 
BN: Well no my daughter did the county fair. 
 
20 
 
ALC: Okay.  
 
BN: Be’cause there was no blacks participating and she was probably the first Black that did 
showed a horse at the county fair. She did one event she did won the first place so on the 
Saturday night we had a lot of people from Covert there it was really exciting but she did barrel 
racing when we started doing horse shows and eventually rodeos. And I probably, I was, it was 
one girl out of Jackson Michigan that came close to me but I probably was the fastest barrel racer 
around. And we did, what we did was Black horse shows.  
 
ALC: That’s some dangerous scary horse racing I’ve seen it [voices overlap]. 
 
BN: No I love it! Well we did Detroit Black Horseman the most famed groups of horse people 
but then there was people there's one in Chicago and so each Horse Club did an event for 
somebody nonprofit every year. In Chicago we did a ride at high noon in Washington Park at the 
most I've been in it was three-hundred horses would leave Washington park and ride down to 
McCormick Place.  
 
ALC: Wow! 
 
[44:46] BN: It got so first year we didn't have anybody putting across the midway way then it got 
so big the Sheriffs and stuff it would be about eight or ten mounted horses putting us across. 
We've been in Washington Park and at the water fountain where they got the little one for the 
dogs. 
 
ALC: Yeah.  
 
BN: White guy asked Murdoch [presumed spelling], and Murdoch is a doctor. Adam Easel 
[presumed spelling] is a lawyer, he says, where'd you guys rent those horses at? 
 
ALC: Oh! 
 
BN: Murdock said these are, this is my horse.  
 
ALC: This is my horse he said yeah.  
 
BN: Says what? 
 
ALC: [laughs] This is in Chicago? 
 
 
21 
BN: Yeah we’d just come out of the tunnel under that Washington... Outer Shore Drive. So when 
you get on the side by the lake there's a water fountain for people and there's one for dogs. And 
actually the charter, the original city charter states that there always has to be at bridle path in 
Chicago. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN: And that Washington Park so then he says, it's your horse? and looked at Adam Easel he 
says, you didn't rent that horse? Now this guy's a lawyer, then he says, “Black man can't own a 
horse?” [laughter] and we were rolling.  But there's the Sheriff’s Posses there's the mounted 
police and so we would ride down the Midway but we got so we would do races too be’cause I'm 
a speed in action. And the first year that happened we got to talking and then you know the city 
people have all these fancy things or whatever. And I had some twine one year ‘‘cause they 
would come up here ‘‘cause this guy drove busses in Chicago up here on the corner in my row. 
And they would come so I had [unintelligible] and at our rodeo I would race. And so I knew I 
could run but they have all this fancy stuff that they love to put their six shooters on their guns on 
and their holsters in Michigan ‘‘cause we're open carry state… 
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: And so we wanted to race and so.  
 
ALC: In Chicago?  
 
BN: Yes on the Midway I'm coming we would be on Lake Shore Drive. 
 
ALC: Right.  
 
BN: But after part of the lake, the lake gets way out there and there's enough grass and that 
path... 
 
ALC: Right Ryan Hyde Park I can picture it! 
 
BN: Well we started Washington Park is on 55th Street and we cross that tunnel and they put us 
across Lake Shore Drive and stop traffic and here's all these horses and one year was an Indian 
there that was famous for all the parades in Chicago. But anyways so we go down and then we 
get way down by 31st Street there's a lot of grass and even there's a paved thing for the bikes but  
there's enough grass that we can kind of do what we wanna. So a bet got on and so here's the 
mounted police and so they did the race for us. They set everybody back and they let us take off 
and run and so we’ll ride to McCormick Place. 
 
22 
 
ALC: Oh my gosh! 
 
BN: That group over there their money all the money they raised at the ride for high noon it’s the 
last Saturday of July every year, goes to La Rabida Heart Hospital [presumed spelling]. 
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
BN:  Each group now I was there for Doctor Ray’s [presumed spelling] the Farm School. Every 
group everywhere we go every year whatever money was raised would be for their charity 
organization.  
 
ALC: Do you still have a horse? 
 
BN: They're over Lee and Lori's [presumed spelling]  and they're getting old my granddaughter 
has a mule named Jenny and that's what Iris learned to ride on and my grandson has a Tennessee 
Walker ‘‘cause we took them over there ‘‘cause the boys had left to go to school and graduated 
went to work and so Lee needed something for Iris to start riding with, and oh she's awesome 
now. 
 
ALC: She's been riding forever yeah she's good. 
 
BN: She started with Jenny and they came over her first lessons was over at the house they came 
over and the girl who was her teacher as a girl I had in school in South Haven. So they kept the 
horses are old and nobody rides them and Iris’s grandfather done bought her a horse. 
 
ALC: See I had no idea that there was this sort of public parade of African-American horse 
riders in Chicago that happened every July! 
 
BN: Oh gosh, the last Saturday of July the ride at high noon, 
 
ALC: The ride at high noon, 
 
BN: Then we went to Harvey for something then Dr. Ray [presumed spelling] and them they 
went to the one in Oklahoma probably the biggest group of Black cowboys, but the Detroit 
International Horseman's Club. And finally got enough recognition we were riding in the Clinton 
inaugural parade.  
 
ALC: Wow.  
 
 
23 
BN: Somebody in my family died, I didn't go. But everywhere we went we trailered the horses 
Charlie O's would get us out of Jackson a trailer or horses or whatever we went so when they got 
invited to the ride at, to the Clinton's inaugural, they rented a big trailer the professional looking 
stuff and everybody had their stuff. I didn't go but Janet and everybody else in the Black 
horsemen’s they got a breastplate from Clinton. 
 
ALC: Oh my gosh.  
 
[49:46] BN: That would have been the biggest thing but we did parades in South Bend we did 
parades all over 
 
ALC: So it’s a way of really being visible like making yourself known yeah yeah.  
 
BN: But with my horse in here, most Summers I would ride to school to work. And see you 
asked me about what did I do besides farming. There's an old farmer on airport road [presumed 
spelling] in South Haven Mr. Lindenbomber [presumed spelling] old white guy and he says 
Barbara I, he started driving school bus in ‘48 he did two thousand pounds of cabbage for 
chicken coop during the season he had never been married. He says “driving buses works so 
good with farming.” He says “I get up I take ‘em in the morning go back and farm and I go in the 
evening and take ‘em home.” Never had any kids so then I thought the Covert needed some bus 
drivers me and that guy out there Al started together in 1980 or ‘81 and I loved it ‘‘cause I loved 
the kids and it gave me access but I could go see the world ‘‘cause I wanted to be outside on this 
bus and then I come back and do what I want.  
 
ALC: Ooh you have to be a good driver though ‘‘cause Michigan Winters that's no joke.  
 
BN: Right well when you’re young it didn’t matter some roads sometimes ‘‘cause I wind up 
being transportation director. Some mornings I go down some of those roads and be the first 
tracks on the road but a bus is way up in those big tires it's nothing like a car. 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: And Covert’s school district is only twenty-six miles in diameter but I drove for South 
Haven too.  
 
ALC: Well back to these kids ‘‘cause you know I one of the when we were talking a couple 
years ago you were like yeah I'm bringing in all these kids from Detroit and Chicago to my farm. 
BN: this was their 7th year, Betty Wiggins  [presumed spelling] started that but that ties back to 
food and agriculture. 
 
 
24 
ALC: Okay so tell me about this. 
 
BN: Food and agriculture you know you are what you eat or whatever And now since everybody 
you know we went from the Agriculture Age of my great-grandparents and all of that then they 
went into the Industrial Age where everybody migrated from the south getting away from the 
farm and going to these big factories and big cities given up that cooking and all of that. And 
then the fast foods came along and killed our bodies. So when you went from the AG age to the 
Industrial Age so then here comes my generation at one point you said something about the 
image. So now most black people think and I can bring it down to closer to here, that farming 
they don't look at it as a business or a way of life much less what your body needs!  
 
ALC: I hear you.  
 
BN: It all separated with each change we gained a little something but we lost a little something. 
from the AG Age in the south or even up here is ‘‘cause there was always farmers up here same 
as in Nicodemus and I did that too. But the AG Age oeople could eat your health was better even 
though the data showed you might not lived as long but you were healthy. You lived a good life 
you didn't require as much. Then when we moved from the AG Age into the Industrial Age then 
that’s when people going in the factories and whatever that's what maybe not much but women 
they didn't quite leave the home that day was still at the domestic engineers but life was slowly 
changing. ‘‘cause you were going into these cities and you were working these nine to five’s and 
then whatever that's when that eating stopped and we started doing different things in a little bit 
later the women started having a job also. And hear the Technical Age technology is slowly 
moving in and this fast-food came with it. And with the fast-food came death.  
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
BN: Fast-food alone with chemicals on your crops so I became I went from a small family farms 
and producing good healthy foods be me Black, white, Puerto Rican, Native American or 
whatever. then all the rules and regulations start coming in and then the chemical industry started 
making money and everything changed. And then with the fast food and the grocery stores life is 
never the same. People are dying with you know we're killing ourselves. Well here I am stuck on 
this little ole’ country farm in a city, in a township no red lights no railroad tracks no tall 
buildings all this rural land. So we’re slower, we're behind, we're not up with the rest of the 
world. Thank God so that's how the organic started coming and stayed with me be’cause we 
didn't use a lot of chemicals growing up.  
 
[54:46] ALC: You know it's hard to get Organic certification so when did you decide to move 
towards Organic certification? 
 
 
25 
BN: Well be’cause I didn't really have to move toward it I just went back to what I know. We 
didn't have all those chemicals when we started planting blueberries or when I garden if you put 
anything in it might have been that little thing called seven but I learned from my grandfather 
that if your soil is completely balanced you won't have all of that. And I'm not moving so much 
towards Organic certification I'll get the label, I'm going to no-till and vermiculture. 
 
ALC: Oh wow okay.  
 
BN: Be’cause when you think if every time you know you cleaned up your house somebody 
came and let the wind blow in, or every time you know you have all these animals on the ground 
they have a purpose. The earthworms they’re air raking the ground they do everything and they 
got their houses and they got a system down there same as the bears and everything. So now 
‘‘cause here I come along with the tractor just ‘‘cause I'm getting ready to plant a crop and I'm 
going down in the ground I'm turning over that topsoil I'm breaking up roots or whatever’s in 
there. We ain’t even got to the chemicals yet. So then I'm messing up the ecosystem. I’ve got 
animals God has planted or nature whatever you want to call it whether you want to be scientific, 
spiritual whatever, nature is nature. It's set up so it'll take care of itself just like the earthworm 
grow another part or something happens. So now if I go in and mess up this system and tear up 
everybody's house every year my stuff can't produce anything that needs to eat if I've got green 
plants or trees out there and you're killing all my worms in your killing what I can naturally find 
to eat same as taking over all the land building stuff then you wonder why the deers are in 
downtown everywhere the raccoons people are...you're killing what's that movie with the man 
that talks to the animals? That second movie where they wanna yeah.  
 
ALC: Doctor Dolittle.  
 
BN: Yes! 
 
ALC: Yeah right.  
 
BN: It’s the same principle it’s real! So if you planting doing roads and stuff and keep tearing up 
my house I'm under the ground I'm not even bothering you. And you wanna dig and mess it up. 
So I'm really going to no-till and now with no-till and cover crops, people aren't keeping up with 
it. I visited Gabe Brown five-thousand acres in North Dakota this year then I went to this Dome 
farm [presumed spelling] ten thousand acres. But cover crops have now become vegetables.  
 
ALC: Oh wow.  
 
 
26 
BN: Gabe well Dome’s we went out there I’m looking out there you know he’s got ten-thousand 
acres and he grows Black English Gabe Brown has, in their network he’s probably the third best 
soil in the country. He's no-till and cover crops. So I'm looking at Dome’s land you know... 
 
ALC: And these are all African American farmers.  
 
BN: No these are big white farmers I don't, I don't discriminate I'm going wherever! 
 
ALC: Okay okay.  
 
BN: He'll be here March the 10th too. He didn't know nobody Black before me. But anyway the 
when I went, with him we went with Native Americans too. But anyway this guy ten-thousand 
acres you can see what the cows have walked over you can see carrots, you can see the top of the 
carrots you can see greens you can see string beans you can see little corn plants. And that's what 
they're using for cover crops. Now its a black farmer in Grand Rapids he's been doing greens for 
about five years. And so, black people love greens so he's let his church women...’’cause in his 
[unintelligible] Is it got so they were coming out one Sunday he’d get there, cows was looking 
but here's three or four ladies bent over trying to pick these greens! So it works... [voices 
overlap] 
 
ALC: Yeah, is that Roberts the… 
 
BN: That’s Reuben... 
 
ALC: Reuben Roberts I need to call him, I need to call him ‘‘cause I need to interview him too 
[voices overlap] 
 
BN: The dad you need to get the dad before he goes.  
 
ALC: Yeah.  
 
BN: But anyway so you're doing no till I'm not bothering the underground system. The worms 
are doing their jobs, there's what do you call them amatodes are nematodes or whatever... 
 
ALC: Nematodes right! 
 
BN: That do whatever they're supposed to do and then I have a vermiculture farm on my thing. 
My cousin is growing earthworms for composting. So I'm not so much worried about what the 
system says I need to be, but if that helps I'll do organic. Be’cause they say anything the 
 
27 
government gets in it kind of messes up after a while. But that's what USDA tells me but 
be’cause it's all natural and it's making us come back full circle is why I'm doing it. 
 
ALC: Mmm. 
 
[59:46] BN: Be’cause and it's easier with a small spot I had some farmers they’re both dead They 
had a really small spot and they bartered they use the barter system and they ate organic and then 
the food will be better but it's easy with a small spot to get a perfectly balanced that's why that 
one acre that I have was certified five or six years ago. And the difference in my fruit? The 
people I've got friends that only want, they'll come pick. I have professors and everything that’ll 
come out there and pick just to be Dr. Dallas [presumed spelling] is my doctor he loves it. It's 
different from my other fruit my other fruit is good and Michigan has the best fruits and 
vegetables but the taste and the fact that there's no chemicals but it's so easy to manage ‘‘cause I 
know I can take horticultural vinegar and kill the weeds. And then this stuff that kills the the 
stuff that you use for organic like anything for the pests or the bugs is so gentle you can...when 
they took Guthion off the market it had a fourteen-day re-entry. Now if I spray something on a 
tree today and I can't go back, I got to come out the field with the airplane comes or when you 
spray got to have on masks, you got all the farmers that's dying from inhaling all that stuff when 
they didn't know about protective covering. But if I spray something today and you can't even 
touch it or eat it for fourteen days don't you know you're eating poison? If I spray something 
that’s man-made that is not a chemical and it's natural ball mill [presumed spelling] or whatever 
it may be and I can go in the field and eat it that same day don’t that make sense to you? So that's 
where the education comes in with the adults and children. And when I started with the kids it 
was with my grandkids and then when I did the 4-H club I had my three my sister's three my 
daughter's one and then some distant relatives over there I had as many as I could pack in my 
Jeep. And we started... 
 
ALC: And you must have been one of the first African-American 4-H leaders around here right. 
 
BN: No!  
 
ALC: Okay.  
 
BN: Miss [unintelligible] did 4-H Right there behind that store all my life and she liked to do the 
crafts and everything you know we had to make stuff ‘‘cause we had home economics in Covert 
school we had Girl Scouts. Miss [unintelligible] always wanted you to show some, her house 
was always junkie not nasty she just had crafts. When you go just look on that chair whatever 
you was working on was on that chair.  
 
ALC: Yeah. 
 
28 
 
BN: So when it was no longer here now I got involved with Michigan State and did my own club 
we could do what we wanted, and so we had the garden. And to get the parents back involved the 
kids did the garden right along my pear orchard right by the roadside ‘‘cause I don't want this to 
be a drop-off I ain't the babysitter. Your hoes your everything is right there Mom and Dad you 
can sit there while they if they can't come do nothing but get them or a water jug or bring a 
gallon or two of water and water they three or four tomato plants. Give them thirty minutes, give 
them whatever time you spare but you gonna to sit here on the side of the road and your kid is 
going to do their planting or whatever. And then that got good and then the things the Doctor 
Ray taught me be’cause Western was doing a Hands-On science program four times a year so 
school would let me take buses and that got up to sixty-two but be’cause...  
 
ALC: That's in Kalamazoo? 
 
BN: That's in yeah. 
 
ALC: Okay wow. 
 
BN: But be’cause we all grew up with I got on with AG on the mind and eating it's just natural. 
Now the schools have to be tied in in order to get a 4-H thing or a Future Farmers. Then they 
have this envirothon thing, all that the kids need to know, and Anna it's as much difference of the 
people that grew up in my generation they got [unintelligible]. They had to pick berries and some 
family so they had to pick for their school clothes or whatever. As the people that on the lens 
kids it's night and day. Me and even my grandkids ‘‘cause we learned the kids and my cousins 
when they come up you know everybody went in the fields and pick or whatever you when you 
graduated you got to go into the packing shed, that was better money. But the people that know 
the whole blueberry story and know about owning the land I have friends who said they would 
never make their kids pick blueberries. They wouldn't go in the field. I had to pick blueberries! 
That's be’cause they didn't know it was a business. You see these movies of Blacks with the 
plow. You know that's why I was so interested in your second book when you taught about how 
the people knew how long it would take with that horse and plow to plow a block or a half an 
acre or how many foots and how [unintelligible] so many people. It was still a business. The 
pictures they show us are depicting, they don't look at the fact that the farmers even if they didn't 
make a lot of money they were feeding their family they were healthy, they were with nature, 
they were learning about the soil, they knew how to keep from starving. 
 
[64:53] ALC: So this was about empowering it was not just victimization. 
 
BN: Right! 
 
 
29 
ALC: Right, right.  
 
BN: It was learning something it was knowing how to eat day by and then you talked about when 
the farmers even though when they was way before there was states or whatever they were still  
Farmers. They knew this. I know how to feed I can plant, I would never starve. You could take 
you could give me a land just big as this room and I could feed myself and probably anybody 
else that was hungry 
 
ALC: Wow. 
 
BN: It's more good than bad and I'll tell you USDA I'm in a fight with him right now and I'm 
going to win. 
 
ALC: What's the fight? 
 
BN: About me not signing the paper for one of them programs and when they told me I didn't 
sign it and says well it's over it's done we can't do anything else, why? I've done this two or three 
years and it was okay every year you say I'm in good standing. Now you tell me be’cause I didn't 
sign a paper I can't participate anymore? 
 
ALC: Mmm and you were doing such important work bringing in these kids. 
 
BN: That’s not right and that’s my fight. And see I testified at the Senate AG committees when 
Debbie Stabenow first went to Senater. I went up in 2001 or something and testified the playing 
field wasn't level. You know first time we had a program down here for USDA and this I keep 
going back and forth back and forth you're going to have to really… 
 
ALC: That’s alright that's okay! 
 
BN: It was 1998 and all these people came from Lansing it was a snowstorm they thought 
nobody was coming but I had still had a room full of Black people from all over. And so talked 
and they talked and they told us all what we could do or whatever but the first time I went to 
Lansing and asked this guy and I shook his hand when he came out and spoke to him and he's 
lookin like where this Negro come from. Know my name and shake my hand and he says oh. 
And this is maybe a year or so later, you remember me you really have a good memory. I said it's 
not often that somebody tells me they have a two hundred million dollar budget and what they 
can do and then you tell me no, you can't do it. You know so it went on from there. And then 
when I first went over to try to get a loan or something they weren't even letting Black people 
come in the office. The do nothing secretary... one of my friends went in for a conservation plan 
with the government agency called NRCS. All of that's in the USDA building. Do nothing 
 
30 
secretary look like she didn't even have a high school education all white all female, marriage 
you know that was the thing. And they looking for NRCS which was housed in the same 
building, she says I don't know what you're... send him over to the human resource building 
[unintelligible] where MSU is. And they weren't doing anything so after they said about these 
programs I went for a program and they says no. Says I'm divorced. I have a job but I have bad 
credit from a divorce but I want to participate and I have I own fifty-three acres. Oh no I can't 
help you [unintelligible]. Maybe a year or two later when this big class settlement and stuff 
comes out or whatever so somebody calls me from Lansing and says go back over there 
Washington and them says they have to give out applications.  I says no, they said go back. I said 
okay. Now I can send twelve Mexicans in there get thirty applications so but I did outreach all 
across the country when they said they have to do outreach and do an outreach report they got so 
they knew they could call me and set up a program and they didn't mind coming from Lansing if 
they knew they was going to have twenty to thirty people there that would make a good 
impression like they you know... 
 
ALC: ‘‘cause I've been in some of your meetings you bring in people from all over, Chicago and 
all over.  
 
BN: Now with Project Fresh when they started doing this with the farmers could sell stuff and 
they would get these tickets. I wanted to do that. We had all these farmers around here. Well I 
called Lansing and they told me no. Says well first criteria is we have to know that the stuff is 
grown, you grow the stuff. And it's on your farm and blah blah so I says okay... 
 
ALC: So what’s project fresh can you explain that ‘‘cause a lot of people here won’t know.  
 
[69:46] BN: Now it's part of snap ed [presumed spelling] but Project Fresh is a thing with the 
government USDA comes out of the food program the food stamp program it's where I'm a 
farmer and you can get these coupons from like the WICK office or from the government that 
you can buy fresh food from me fresh vegetables and fruit without going in the grocery store. 
Well this is the time that food stamps is out and so it's easy to go to the grocery store and get all 
that old stuff from Mexico, but Project Fresh means you can buy from a farmer. 
 
ALC: Wow wonderful. 
 
BN: Okay so there was nobody around here doing Project Fresh so when I called back they says 
well no be’cause you know where are you and I tell them and whatever. Oh well no I don't think 
it's possible be’cause we do have to come and visit the farms, you know okay. So next time I talk 
to her name is Pam I says well listen I've got a bunch of farmers and all the farms are real close 
together we grow anything from blueberries to apples to tomatoes, row crops. I says why don't 
 
31 
you get somebody out here we’re about an hour and twenty minutes, we’re a hundred and twenty 
miles from you.  
 
ALC: Yeah.  
 
BN: I says when I come to Lansing hour-forty-five minute ride two hour ride but it's a nice ride. 
Straight shot jump on 94 and come straight to Covert.  
 
ALC: And it’s the state of Michigan1 
 
BN: I said why don't you get one of your buddies and take a day out of the office, now this is 
Summertime, and ride down here I said I'll feed you whatever. And you can see my farm and see 
that I'm growing. Mmm! I said let’s work on it Pam now see you got to build them relationships! 
 
ALC: Right right.  
 
BN: Well here I am [unintelligible] she says well I’ll think about it. So I gave her another call in 
a week, whoever I don’t know, who kept, I don’t know if she started calling me back or 
whatever. But she got two girlfriends and so one day here they come to Covert. By now, it’s 
okay, can you have the farmers at your place? Mmm-hmm how many you want?  So I had five or 
six we had stuff sitting out we by the garden they seeing we become, a relationship we have 
friends you know se wrote that thing. She made me the market master she certified seven of my 
farmers. 
 
ALC: Oh good 
 
BN: That day. 
 
ALC: Wow, wow.  
 
BN: So after we got that then well Eastern Market hadn’t come back up yet. So we said and the 
girl over here that does WICK she’s retired now so we did them over there and we would bring 
It’d come over there and so everybody that had stuff to sell... 
 
ALC: You’d bring food for WICK?  
 
BN: I brought the people the farmers or we’d bring the project they started bringing out the 
coupons so we did that thing down here then I found out Wick likes to do show you know some 
of the young people don't know how to cook fresh stuff. They're used to the store process stuff. 
And then despite the barrier would be that was if I'm getting food stamps it's so easy for me to go 
 
32 
to Jewels or Walmart or Meijers I don't really have to identify with a farmer, so we kinda, but 
you know some of the old timers they really loved it. So we start it got kind of really popular. So 
we set up somebody told me about the Eastern Market, me and Lupe and them I think it was 
about ten of us we picked black bell peppers out of one of the Hispanics there about four or five 
then we going to Detroit here we go! So we load up our stuff and we go to Eastern Market and 
we go by WICK place. And so we did that we had the little bags of blueberries we sold 
everything and then the WICK place they did a cooking session at the same time to show these 
young people how to do and so that got to be a tradition and a ritual... 
 
ALC: But you had to drive to Detroit to do that. 
 
BN: Yeah me and two or three other farmers… 
 
ALC: That’s the other side of the state! 
 
BN: That's all right we was rollin we loved it! 
 
ALC: that's like a four hour drive from here.  
 
BN: Well we loved it we got there at eight o’clock. And we did and we did a couple of times 
then a Lupe down,  went with us so we found out there on the other side of town there was a 
whole Mexican community. So the next time we went ‘‘cause Lupe her jalapenos they still sold 
them but this old guy work for the Government Hank Reed he made me so...he wanna come and 
squeeze my tomatoes he wanna try to [unintelligible] me. Man leave my stuff alone, I don’t care. 
I’d give it to these kids over here in the neighborhood before...don’t be squeezing it. Any that 
you’re gonna buy and we did drove for a while it was picked yesterday and some this morning 
and you used to getting stuff from Mexico with bruises. You either going to pay what I want or 
you're not going to get anything. We still ain't the best of friends but anyway it worked out so 
nice. Fast forward a couple years and all of this is with farming in all of this was teaching people 
about food but we hadn't caught on like they're catching on now. So I take my same farmers we 
set up a farmers market at what do you call at the Capitol. We did the first farmers market 
Mondo gave me some peaches and they was over ripe when got there the gnats was over that but 
we did that.  
 
[74:46] ALC: In Lansing. 
 
BN: Same little Covert farmers uh huh. That's where I met this guy that's a white guy he's retired 
now his son does it he grows the best organic his squash you can't hardly touch it with your 
fingernail it was so we're still friends I see him every year. Then along came the good food 
Charter. I'm still doing all this outreach we're still farming, I'm still growing farmers and the kids 
 
33 
came in place be’cause our thing with Dr. Ray was we grow scientists and farmers. There's not 
going to be a next generation and then plus I had kids! 
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: And my sisters and them have kids and they needed to learn this and we live in Covert so it 
was just a natural fit. Then when I met Lynn and Lori then we had Iris and them and they're 
doing Organics you just got you know churches don't want to get they don't want to sit down 
nobody thinks about a child until they get a teenager or older well by then they have so many,  
there's so much going on they've made up their mind or whatever. So my grandkids at three and 
four they was carrying them water jugs to their garden.  
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: You know and you're probably ‘gon play, but you're gonna to water these tomatoes and 
some of the things I found that work so well it’s so intriguing. With my grandkids they grew 
tomatoes and three or four bushes or plants would do you know. They would take the tomatoes 
to church on Sunday and they started giving ‘em to the old women there to anybody. And so they 
started giving them quarters and dollars so there's they're already sold. Then I had a thing where 
with my 4-H kids, I would sell them a square.  
 
ALC: Mmm, hmm.  
 
BN: A little square. Every year I would sell them in the spring I would sell them a square where 
they could do their gardens and I had to buy I most of it was educating them parents and getting 
them to help. 
 
ALC: Just a little square land of, a little square bit of land. 
 
BN: Yeah not near as big as this room just a little square with a good plant two or three plants 
whatever their attention span is going to do. And I'd sell it to them or I'd give it to them a dollar 
fifty-cents, but at the end of the season I wanted to buy my land back. 
 
ALC: Mmm! 
 
BN: And the youngest child or the oldest it only took one season. They never sold me my land 
back for what I sold it to them.  
 
ALC: Huh.  
 
 
34 
BN: so the way that they learned and the different things just like this kid remembers me until I 
looked up at his face I hadn't really paid him attention be’cause I was interrupted but I realized 
the value I was doing what I wanted to do and needed to do be’cause I loved it and I knew it was 
important but the value of what and then to the children. You know we were at a funeral here last 
year a kid’s nephew died he's grown now he says Miss Norman do you still do stuff with kids 
you said I never will forget the horse rides and stuff I want my kids to do that we’re in Grand 
Rapids they don't get no exposure like that. This kid is maybe thirty now. He's a man. So you got 
to it just comes natural and it's so easy it don't require a lot. 
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
BN: And so that's how I started with the kids in little pieces. 
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: And then when I did the catalog project with the fifty families the people that did the, we 
went to homes but hey let them plant gardens I got a video that they made it's a little family over 
there and most of them garden still. But they was so proud they just have them a little spot and so 
now here comes the food industry changing all while we’re farming, people putting more respect 
on the farmer.  
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
BN: When my tractor I could drive down and 140 but I always have a dress on be’cause I shop at 
Goodwill. And it was so people could be riding down when they see me on the horse people 
could you know, I could be flying down there 140 [unintelligible]. 
 
ALC: [laughs] 
 
BN: Then when I'm going down my tractor was orange, the first tractor that I bought. And I'm 
flying down the road with a dress on ‘‘cause I come from Goodwill. 
 
ALC: Haha I'm listening. 
 
BN: You know so and people would do a double-take. 
 
ALC: Right, right, right ‘‘cause you're on your horse. 
 
BN: And then I’m on a tractor they realize it’s a woman and they’re looking back, don't run off 
the road fella. 
 
35 
 
ALC: There it is there it is I want to have a photo of you on a, and I forgot to mention this they 
want pictures of you talking.  
 
BN: Oh no way not today you can take that some other time. 
 
ALC: Not today? Okay alright. Uh okay I won’t take it today then.  
 
BN: Okay yeah.  
 
ALC: But you know I want some photographs of you on your tractor.  
 
[79:46] BN: Lemme ask, yeah but that’s on the video. Wait a minute let me, is it stopped?  
 
ALC: No no no  I don’t have it stopped, do you want me to pause it, ‘cause you gotta pretty soon 
it’s like 11:35.  
 
BN: Nope that was tomorrow I called…. 
 
ALC: Oh good good good okay, lemme pause it be’cause I have another couple questions 
[unintelligible]. 
 
ALC: Get this started again, is this going? Alright. So two questions first what have I not asked 
you is there a question I should have asked you about farming being a farmer, a woman farmer a 
farmer in this area, a blueberry farmer, anything, any question I should have asked you which I 
haven't asked you. And you can take a minute. 
 
BN: I probably won't think of that until you leave but in ending I would like to say or to 
encourage anybody who ever hears this or see that farming is a business farming is a way of life 
and everyone has to eat and somebody has to feed the world. Be it Black white or whatever. But 
I would like to encourage anybody to consider Agriculture and know the importance of it in the 
world I would farm till I die if I only had a parking lot, a car space. I'm going to grow me 
something and it's that important to the world. I like the changing of you know from AG to 
industrial to technology and all but you still have to eat. And you are what you eat so even with 
and it's, even with it’s that smaller farmers go to to me it's not so much Black versus white a lot 
of times it's big versus little. Be’cause if we're not careful now even though we say it's farming 
and its agriculture big AG will swallow up little Ag if you're not careful. The Tyson's the what's 
this company that makes all this poison Guthion and whatever I can't think of it right now.  
 
ALC: Monsanto. 
 
36 
 
BN: The Monsanto's of the world people that the McDonald's the people that are doing cows and 
making the rules of how we eat how we get our food. That trade laws you know countries poor 
countries can bring in stuff you can tell stuff that comes from other countries that have scar 
tissue still have whatever but the American farmers you it's hard getting stuff on the market that's 
a good solid something and a decent something. So I just encourage everybody to farm be’cause 
now the larger farmers and the farmers that's always farming you know even the robots that's 
taking over with the jobs and stuff, just stay real and keep farming with good healthy food. 
 
ALC: Well so that I have a follow-up question to that. You must gain some satisfaction, some 
joy out of this work. What is one or two of your favorite times of year, favorite times of year, 
favorite thing you do on your blueberry farm that just gladens your heart? Favorite season... 
 
BN: It's all year round I love all seasons. as I get older I don't like to drive in ice as much now 
but all seasons everyday when I get up, if when I go outside I can look at the sky I look at that 
field right behind the house it just the land I love it. I just absolutely love it. I've had some tears 
I've had some good times, I've had some bad times and I won't complain but I just love the land. 
It's gorgeous. And anything that I could do to help anybody else, I'll ‘‘cause I eventually want 
my farm to be a demonstration farm. 
 
ALC: Yeah what are your plans for the farm for the future do you have?  
 
BN: I want it to be a demonstration farm and I want it to be, if it would have to have 
[unintelligible] ‘‘cause I have fifty-three acres so twenty-five acres is a producing organic so 
natural and the farm is set up so I have a county draine  running through it and there's trees so I 
could have somebody could do some tests with chemicals on one part and it wouldn't affect the 
organic part. I want my farm to be sustainable and I want people to learn on it as long as there's a 
life. 
 
ALC: Do you have friends or family or someone who might run it after? 
 
[84:46] BN: My grandchildren they said of course they want it but they have different things 
going on and I have a nephew but I want it set up as a demonstration farm even if it was a 
university or somebody for the funding. But there should always be a family member should 
always have some kind of ties to it. That's my goal but irregardless I still want somebody to be 
able to grow something and learn and the soil is so rich and the land is so good with three miles 
from Lake Michigan it just needs to stay in agriculture for eternity. 
 
ALC: What's your greatest concern about the future of your farm? 
 
 
37 
BN: I guess I'm, I’m not naive but I have so much faith that no matter what I go through with it 
it's not as groomed as it normally is be’cause of this problem and at first I couldn't even say 
anything about it be’cause you know I was entrusted with this land. It's my job to keep this land. 
But now no matter what I go through I still have enough faith to know that it will still always be 
a farm so. And I'm going to farm. You know I didn't do as much last year whatever but as long as 
I could walk and have breath and I'm seventy-one years old and I don't take medicine I thank 
God I haven't had any serious health problems and I know it's be’cause of this land. It was 
be’cause we were eating well and living you know and breathing with all this nice air and stuff 
I'm not cramped in a million-dollar home with you know to spare parking places around me it's 
important.  
 
ALC: Well you had Dr. Ray out was is last Summer? To talk about health and he said some 
really interesting things yeah hang on just a second just a second, hang on okay. And you can tell 
me that I don’t mind if you tell me in the recording. So Dr. Dallas came out and we’re talking 
about longevity And that's one of the things that's really struck me is I've interviewed a lot of 
these farmers is that they're still actively farming at eighty-four, eighty-seven, and they're living 
a long time and their parents lived a long time we're talking nineties, some of them a century, 
grandparents did. And this is, this is a group of people this is a region of the nation where people 
are not this is not what people are expecting they're not expecting to see this this longevity and 
you're sitting across from me you look younger than you say you are you're out there farming 
you've got all this energy and this and I think that I there's ways in which your narrative and what 
you're living is so important… 
 
BN: It is. 
 
ALC: It's going to be so important for people to hear.  
 
BN: It is. 
 
ALC: Yeah yeah.  
 
BN: And let me add this caveat and I love my country but our system our health system is after 
something happens and plus our whole system is wrong be’cause of my lifestyle and me and my 
health situation I didn't need doctors or whatever and when I did get ready I was late doing 
Social Security be’cause I didn't need it I was providing and living for myself and with my 
system that I lived in to my dismay and my shock when I somebody did tell me to go do Social 
Security I am being punished to the tune of almost fourteen dollars a month be’cause I didn't get 
in the system when the age came.  
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
38 
 
BN: They says you’re being penalized and I'm like okay what is a nd he says I oh thirteen 
something and I said okay that's no problem. And he says a month. And I'm saying how long? As 
long as you live. Now how do you live in a society now I know you got to pay taxes I swear by 
owning the land but they said they're for taxes I said okay I can live with that but how do you 
live in a land when you don't need a service that they've set up you don't need to be in this 
system right now. I get penalized.  
 
ALC: Mmm, mmm.  
 
BN: For something that I worked for be’cause I didn't join your party when you wanted me to 
join. Now if you change next year and said oh you have to be ninety-three before you can get in 
the system. That's okay be’cause you said I needed to get in at a whatever the age was and I 
didn't get in it and say as when my retirement I retired at fifty-two from the school system after 
twenty some years be’cause it went with farming. But be’cause I retired early and the age wasn't 
there when I got ready for my pension I got punished.  
 
[89:46] ALC: Mmm.  
 
BN: So we’re teaching different stories here. 
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm.  
 
BN: You know life is good and the government is saying they want so many thousand, fifty-
thousand new farmers by the year something they have these imaginary goals they're setting but 
they're not working toward them. They have very few programs for succession farming, for land 
transitioning. And then if somebody lives a good life and don't and saving you money you get 
punished for that to you know I had a problem be’cause I didn't have a doctor, hell I wasn't sick!  
 
ALC: Mmm-hmm yeah.  
 
BN: I don't have any prescriptions.
