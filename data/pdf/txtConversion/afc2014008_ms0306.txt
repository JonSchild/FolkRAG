FROM ANTIQUARIANISM TO CULTURAL ACTIVISM:
 
THE EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC SECTOR FOLKLIFE ACTIVITY
 
The field of public sector folklife has experienced tremendous
 
growth during the  last decade.
 The most visible growth has occurred at
 
the federal  level  (the Folk Arts Program at the National Endowment for
 
the Arts,  the Smithsonian's Office of Folklife Programs,  the American
 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress),  and in the proliferation
 
of state folk cultural programs, which now number in the forties;  but
 
municipal agencies,  museums,  libraries,  historical societies and other
 
public institutions have also initiated new and increased public folklife
 
programming.
 
With strong emphasis on products and presentation of folklife to the
 
general public,  the past ten years,  have,  to a degree,  served as a
 
legitimizing decade;  that is,  public sector folklorists have often attempted
 
to validate folk cultural expression within the larger realm of all cultural
 
expression.
 Appendixed to a 1983 survey of state folk cultural programs  is
 
a listing of some 65 publications and exhibition catalogs,  20 recordings
 
and 30 films and videotapes produced by state folk cultural programs.
 
(Willett 1984).
 All of those were produced in the  last decade,  most in
 
the last five years.
 With numerous products,  festivals and exhibits
 
directed at audiences whose cultural backgrounds are often different
 
from those of the cultures being presented,  public sector folklorists
 
have brought folk cultural expressions,  in attractive gift-wrapped
 
packages,  to mainstream America.
 When presented with sensitivity and
 
dignity these  "packages"  have served to validate cultural expressions
 
of great power and beauty.

The field of public sector  folklife work,  having gone through a
 
number of evolutionary phases,  may be on the threshold of setting  its
 
course toward a new phase.
 The  last decade has brought a certain degree
 
of  institutionalization to public sector folklife programs.
 Several
 
public programs are still fragile,  and there will surely be both casualties
 
and births and rebirths,  but public support of folklife activities will
 
undoubtedly continue  in the foreseeable future.
 Indeed,  in the  last
 
decade only two states have discontinued their state folk cultural
 
programs,  and one of those was reestablished in 1984  after a six-year
 
interim.
I 
In 1983 well over 5 million dollars were expended on state
 
folk cultural programs  (Willett 1984:
 15),  a significant figure when
 
one considers that only a few thousand dollars were expended on such
 
programs seven years earlier.
 Public sector  folklife programs have
 
expanded dramatically and have served to validate traditional expression
 
during a decade of this  "Celebration"  phase of public folklife.
 
There are two historical phases  in the field upon which this
 
"Celebration" phase has built.
 The first,  the  "Discovery and Collecting"
 
phase,  corresponds roughly to the creation of the Archive of Folksong
 
at the Library of Congress  in 1928.
 Although collecting had been going
 
on since the nineteenth century,  the creation of the archive marked the
 
first time that a government agency had become significantly involved in
 
public folklife.
 The WPA,  under the New Deal,  extended that involvement
 
still further.
 This  "Discovery and Collecting"  phase marked the first
 
time that,  under government sponsorship,  the materials of folklife were
 
being sought out in a large scale fashion with the express  intention
 
of preservation for a population different from that of the culture from
 
whom the material was being collected.
 
Interest was 
-•  not only in the areas of traditional
 
and narrative,  but in material culture as well.
 This was the period
 
when Allen Eaton traveled the South in search of traditional crafts a
 
their makers,  his travels 
• in Handicrafts of the Southern
  
Highlands, published  in 1937  (Eaton 1937).
 It was when Doris Ulmann,
 
accompanied by John Jacob Niles,  discovered and photographed a family
 
of North Georgia potters,  the Meaders.
 It was when Federal Writers
 
Project Workers were interviewing other folk potters  in Baldwin Count
 
Alabama  (
:  •
 •
 i
 
In academia,
 
the discovery and
 
southwest Alabama
 
too,  there developed a vital and growing interest  in
 
collecting of things  folk.
 While the potters of
 
were being interviewed by Federal Writers Project workers,
 
John Wesley Work was  in southeast Alabama recording black Sacred Harp
 
Singers,  his  interest stimulated by one of his Fisk University students
 
from Alabama.
 These recordings were deposited in the Library of Congress'
 
Archive of Folksong  (by then a decade old)  and his discovery of black
 
Sacred Harp was recounted in a 1941 Musical Quarterly article  (Work:
 1941).
 
Two years later George Pullen Jackson documented the black Sacred Harp
 
tradition in his White and Negro Spirituals (
1943) , and again the next
 
year  in The Story of the Sacred Harp (1944).
 
The documentation of folk pottery and black Sacred Harp singing in
 
the South are examples of what was a growing preoccupation with the materials
 
of American folklife.
 Folklife was documented in photographs and recordings.
 
It was preserved in public archives.
 It was chronicled in numerous publi-
cations.
 During this  "Discovery and Collecting"  phase,  the Archive of
 
American Folksong,  under the initial  leadership of Robert Winslow Gordon,
 
-4-
and later,  John and Alan Lomax,  provided the major  impetus to a national
 
effort to systematically gather the materials of American folklife.
 
Although there was some effort to present folklife  (the National Folk
 
Festival had premiered in  1934),  the major thrust of folklife activity
 
in the 1930's,  40's and 50's was toward collection for collection's
 
sake.
 
By the  late  1950's there was developing an increasingly serious
 
effort toward the scholarly analysis of American folklife.
 Although
 
such scholarly attention had been paid to folklife in earlier decades,
 
the 1950's and 60's saw such activity become significantly more widespread.
 
This  "Analysis" phase roughly corresponds to the development of university-
based folklore programs.
 Although the focus of the beginnings of this
 
phase was  largely scholarly, 2 it influenced and provided impetus  to the
 
major growth in public sector activity that was to come in the  1970's.
 
This  "Analysis" phase signalled a time when scholars re-discovered much
 
of that material that had been collected in previous decades.
 Government
 
involvement with American folklife,  however,  hardly extended beyond the
 
Archive of Folksong.
 What the academics were providing was a new context
 
in which to analyze and interpret the materials of American folklife.
 
In the South,  folklorists re-discovered the earlier work of Allen
 
Eaton,  Doris Ulmann,  John Work and George Pullen Jackson.
 They studied
 
the Southern pottery tradition and the black Sacred Harp singing tradition
 
more closely and systematically than had their predecessors.
 It was during
 
this period that Ralph Rinzler developed a scholarly interest  in Southern
 
potters,  particularly the Meaders  family of North Georgia  (Rinzler and
 
Sayers  1980).
 John Burrison and Terry Zug began their  long-term commitment
 
to study of the pottery traditions of Georgia and North Carolina respectively.
 
Their work went beyond analysis of the pottery and its technology.
 It
 
- 5-
brought new attention to the potters themselves,  those  "dynastic clay
 
clans"  as Burrison refers to them  (

In traditional music scholarship,  too,
 
on the folk practitioner.
 Upon discovering
 
1984) .
 
there was  increasing emphasis
 
the earlier publications of
 
John Work and George Pullen Jackson, William Tallmadge arrived  in South
 
Alabama  in 1968 to record the black Sacred Harp Singers of that region. 3 
In 1969 Joe Dan Boyd,  also familiar with Jackson and Work's  investigations
 
came to southeast Alabama to research the  life of Judge Jackson,  the author
 
and publisher of the Colored Sacred Harp, a shape-note songster published
 
by blacks  in Ozark,  Alabama in 1934  (Jackson 1934).
 His biographical
 
analysis was presented in a 1970 Journal of American Folklore article
 
(Boyd 1970).
 In 1972-73, ethnomusicologist Doris Dyen made several extended
 
trips to southeast Alabama conducting research on the black shape-note
 
tradition.
 Her work resulted in a doctoral dissertation  (Dyen 1977).
 
During the initial stages of this  "Analysis"  phase there was  little
 
growth in public sector folklife activities beyond those few folk festivals
 
that had already established historical traditions.
 During this period
 
folklorists were primarily concerned with taking a new,  more  interpretative
 
look at folklife materials and traditions,  many of which had been discovered
 
during that earlier  "Discovery and Collecting" phase.
 This academic
 
activity provided that interpretive grist for
 
folklorists as they entered the public sector
 
materials of American folklife.

The federal
 
-6-
government's commitment to public folklife activities grew to an un-
precedented level  in the Smithsonian's Office of Folklife Programs,  the
 
National Endowment for the Arts'  Folk Arts Program and the creation of
 
the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.
 This federal
 
celebration of American folklife created ripples stimulating state
 
governments  to join in the celebration.
 
Although Pennsylvania had hired the nation's  first state folklorist
 
in 1966  it really wasn't until 1974 when the National Endowment for the
 
Arts-supported positions were created in Maryland and Tennessee,  that
 
the rapid growth in state public programs began.
 In 1978 there were
 
eight such programs.
 By 1983  there were over thirty.
 By 1985 there
 
were over forty  (Willett 1984:  3
).
 These public programs--federal,
 
state and local,  have produced hundreds of films,  records,  exhibits,
 
concerts and festivals over the last decade,  most designed for public
 
consumption.
 
The potters of the South and Alabama's black Sacred Harp singers
 
both were celebrated during this period.
 This  "Celebration"  phase has
 
seen a variety of public exhibitions of and catalogs on traditional
 
Southern pottery  (Willett and Brackner  1983).
 Films have been produced.
 
Traditional Southern potters have demonstrated their skills throughout
 
the region and at

 Two Southern potters,
 
Georgia and Burlon Craig of North Carolina have

The South Alabama black Sacred Harp tradition has been similarly
 
celebrated through performances at the Smithsonian's  festival,  in films,
 
through school residencies and public performances  throughout the South.
 
Dewey Williams,  the leader of the Wiregrass Sacred Harp Singers,  received
 
-7-
National Heritage Fellowship recognition  in  1983.
 Schools and libraries
 
throughout Alabama own copies of  "Wiregrass Notes:
 Black Sacred Harp
 
Singing from Southeast Alabama,  "an LP record and booklet produced in
 
1982  (Willett 1982).
 This  "Celebration"  phase of public sector folklife
 
work has ushered in an unprecedented number of products and events all
 
offered for public enlightenment.
 
The discovery and collecting goes on--as does the analysis--as does
 
the celebration of American folklife.
 Each phase has built upon the
 
other borrowing the materials and insights of the previous generations.
 
No phase has superceded any former phase.
 The phases,  instead, are
 
simple indicators  in a logical evolution and maturation of the field of
 
public sector folklife.
 
As the field continues to grow there  is discernible growing emphasis
 
on advocacy and cultural activism in the field of public sector folklife.
 
Borrowing from related fields such as applied anthropology,  public sector
 
folklorists are beginning to redirect their primary focus away from the
 
audience and toward the practitioner.
 Cultural activism is not new to the
 
field of public sector folklife,  but has not,  thusfar,  been a defining
 
characteristic of public sector folklife work.
 
There are numerous precedents for the practitioner-directed approach
 
to cultural programming.
 In arts administration  (under whose umbrella
 
the majority of public sector folklife programs have developed),  it is
 
the artist,  rather than the audience,  toward whom most policy and
 
programming decisions are directed.
 The arts administrator does not
 
limit his work to the documentation and presentation of the arts.
 He,
 
instead,  acts as an artist advocate,  providing services,  exhibition
 
and performance opportunities,  facilitating commissions,  working to
 
-8-
improve environmental,  economic,  sometimes political conditions,  and
 
all the while trying to educate the public toward an understanding of
 
the artist's expression while allowing the artist to maintain his
 
aesthetic integrity.
 
Similar,  perhaps,  will soon be the function of the public sector
 
folklorist;  that is,  serving as an advocate to traditional communities
 
and individuals helping to provide those communities and  individuals
 
with the same access to economic resources and services that is provided
 
to other arts constituencies,  and working toward the creation of a social,
 
cultural and economic environment that will allow expressions of
 
traditional culture to thrive,  evolve or disappear according to the
 
needs,  will and desires of the community.
 
In certain measure,  the  1978 debate over the American Folklife
 
Center's participation  in the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Folklife
 
Survey initiated a still continuing dialogue on the appropriate cultural
 
activist role for public sector folklorists. 6 
The debate produced some
 
thoughtful
 and lively dialogue,  but never came to a definitive resolution
 
beyond the fact that the Folklife Center did not conduct such a survey.
 
What did become quite evident was the fact that public sector folklorists
 
suffered great ambivalence and uncertainty when dealing with questions and
 
issues of cultural activism.
 That ambivalence alone signaled
 
caution in 1978.
 
Perhaps the field is now at a stage where  it is redefining its
 
constituency and shedding that certain timidity that has characterized
 
much public sector work.
 Perhaps public sector folklorists are assuming
 
a bolder posture as advocates  to traditional communities,  and are adopting
 
"cultural activism"  as the defining characteristic of the next phase  in
 
the evolution of public sector folklife.

Notes
 
IThe Oregon Arts Commission formerly had a state folk arts program,
 
but does no longer.
 The Tennessee Arts Commission's program was re-
established in 1984.
 
2 
S  scholarship-oriented was this  "Analysis" phase at one point
 
that many folklorists  ignored,  or,  in some cases,  attacked those earlier
 
efforts at public presentation of American folklife,  as  in Richard
 
Dorson's continued criticism of Ben Botkin and other so-called "popularizers
 
At the 1985 conference on  "Folklife and the Public Sector"  at Western
 
Kentucky University,  folklorist Archie Green suggested that it might be
 
the appropriate time for a "revisionist"  treatment of Botkin,  Sarah
 
Gertrude Knott and others.
 
3These recordings are housed at the Archive for Ethnomusicology at
 
the University of Illinois-Urbana.
 
4Many folklorists were initiated into the public sector through their
 
work on the Smithsonian's Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife  in
 
1976.
 
5Lanier Meaders was honored in  1983.
 Burlon Craig was honored in 1984.
 
6The American Folklife Center,  in 1978,  entered into negotiations
 
with the Interagency Archaeological Services  (Department of the Interior)
 
and the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers over a proposed folklife survey of
 
the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway area  in Alabama and Mississippi.
 After
 
extended,  sometimes passionate,  correspondence and discussions  in the
 
field,  the Board and Director of the American Folklife Center decided not to
 
enter
 
into contractual arrangements with IAS and the Corps of Engineers.

RHETORIC AND REALITY:
 
THE FRUSTRATIONS OF CULTURAL CONSERVATION
 
IN AMERICAN SAMOA,  A CASE STUDY
 
The topic we are about '
to address is an elusive and
 
complex one,  with roots deep in a colonial history that we
 
do not h<
t
.ve the time today to investigate.  It is also a
 
topic rife with contested terms in the field of cultural
 
discourse--"culture,"  "art,"  "cultural conservation,"
 
"historic preservation." These are sensitive,  emotional
 
grounds upon which to tread,  and I do so only with a sense
 
o
f  trepidation and a feeling of urgency.
 
At the outset allow me to lay bare my own shortcomings,
 
as what is to  '
ollow is largely a critique of events in my
 
adopted homeland,  American Samoa.  First,  1 am not Samoan,
 
though I have  l
ived there for a decade now.  I am an Irishman
 
from Buffalo,  New York,  trained as a folklorist at Berkeley.
 
My command of the Samoan language is embarrassingly poor. My
 
bureaucratic/political experience in Samoa--though now six
 
years deep and getting deeper--still ranks me as only an
 
amateur in a culture where the art of oratory and service to
 
the extended family are of paramount,  life-long importance.
 
The sentiments and observations I am about to elaborate
 
upon I probable would not publically declaim in such a forum
 
at hur
ts  . The frustrations I speak of are the rules of the
 
game--
-if you can't stand the heat,  get out of the jungle.
 
t
i.
 
but  that does not mean  that these frustrations i speak
 
of are not rea,--and not only for me but for many Samoans as
 
well.  l am that confident about what I have to say.  Though I
 
may b
t> a palagi
.,  I have spent hundreds of hours talking with
 
R
 
fellow  i
slanders about  these topics,  and 1 assure you that
 
my grouses and  :
omplaints are beyond the purely personal;
 
they are endemic.
 
Similar grouses and complaints about the frustrations
 
of cultural conservation,  in fact s seem to be pandemic in
 
the Pacific.  As I was preparing this paper at home  in Samoa,
 
a friend at the East-West Center brought to my attention
 
that  the Center's Institute of Culture and Communication had
 
only  .
ast year conducted a '
'Workshop on Cultural Policy and
 
National
.  Identity,"  which had chewed over--with much sharper
 
teeth than
, mine--many of the questions we have been dealing
 
with in Samoa.
 
In  his opening remarks to that workshop Dr.  Tu Weiming,
 
the Director of the Institute of Culture and Communications,
 
drew an  incisive distinction between cultural  identity and
 
institutional  identity,  I would  like to borrow that
 
distinction to try and make sense of the frustrations this
 
paper addresses.
 
What exactly are these frustrations and whence do they
 
arise: The frus=trations arise from living with and dealing
 
with the gap between th- political rhetoric about the need
 
to preserve a cultural  identity and the reality of Samoan
 
administrative decisions that consistently seem to undercut
 
3
 
and belie  that rhetoric.  Some would call  it cultural  lip
 
sorvice,  but  it
,  is more complex than that.
 
There are,  for  instance,  the differences between the
 
Models and expectations of two demonstrably different
 
t
 
cultural  systems confronting one another.  There  is,  for
 
instance,  the  introduction of the  idea of a "culture''  that
 
nFeds  to be  "conserved."  There are,  for  instance,  two
 
ideational  idenr
.ities--a cultural  identity and an
 
institutional  identity--that coexist but fail to overlay
 
each other except at a few critical,  contested terms.  The
 
different meanings of those terms,  their disparate
 
understandings,  may be an essential seed of the frustrations
 
I am to speak about.  They are frustrations that rise from a
 
bed of c:
�nfusions and blossom into the abuses of power and
 
the  toll  in  human energies that are the harvest of those
 
confusions.
 
There seems to be a confusion,  for  instance,  about what
 
constitutes Samoan culture.  To what extent  is culture merely
 
what we do and say and believe today,  and to what extent  is
 
it  tied up  in  received  language,  traditions,  history,  and
 
the evidence of that history? The ethnocentric  innocence
 
that prevailed  in Samoa well  into this century has in recent
 
decades been overwritten by another set of standards,  one  in
 
which '
'culture''  (whatever that  is) and tradition have become
 
employable tenets  in a larger political game.
 
It  is a new political game for Samoa
 And Samoa is a
 
place where the communal,  consensual,  tightly layered social
 
Y
 
order often makes day-to-day l
ife look--to an
 
i
ncl.ividual
.istic westerner--like constant politics.  But the
 
new  twist is the prepotency that accompanies the dollar
 
power of America's ever increasing institutional presence.
 
When I use the term "institutional" I am denoting that
 
official bureaucratic structure that distributes influence

Our field i
s the arts,  and we tend to see a culture as
 
i
t is presented i
n its arts  We share,  to some degree or
 
another,  the subtle assumption  that art--that hyper-craft-
conscious moiety of culture--accurately reflects the state
 
of  its  larger polity.  And so when we see the traditional
 
arts badly served , ignored,  and generally given short
 
shrift,  we become concerned about the state of the
 
traditional  culture.
 
What are the major traditional arts of Samoa? Oratory,
 
first and foremost,  followed on the performance arts side by
 
song and dance and the satiric performances called f aleaitu, 
and on the matF
�rial arts side by tattooing,  fine mat
 
plaiting,  tapa,  house-building,  and boat-building. These
 
traditional practices constitute,  along with traditional
 
ceremonies and medicine,  the cultural aspect of the
 
fa' asamoa. 
One cannot discuss Samoan society or culture without
 
confronting the concept of fa'asamoa
., the "Samoan way." It
 
is a term one hears often in Samoa,  a term that has a
 
variety of meanings dependent upon context.  It too has
 
5-'
 
become a contested  term.  In  its most elusive and commonest
 
s
f ,nse  i
t
,  is used  aE
� a sort of enucleation meant to explain
 
both the obvious and  the  inexplicable.  When used  in politics
 
i
t
. usually means  '
'don't question authority."  Its social-
context sense encompasses  loyalty to the extended family,
 
the concept of service ; and adherence to Winship and  respect
 
systems.
 
A result of American Samoa's  inevitable struggle to
 
integrate new uu!
.tural  realities  into  its social fabric has
 
been  an  atomistic  reformulation of the traditional,
 
wholistic fa'asamoa.  So that when a politician says we must
 
respec+-.
 and  foster  the  ta'asamoa, he  is probably not talking
 
about support for the traditional arts.  At election time
 
especially,  we  near a great deal  about the fa`asamoa, about
 
the sacredness of Samoan  traditions and folk ways.  A
 
standard plank of every  local candidate's platform  is his
 
dedication  to maintainiAg the Samoan cultural  identity.  But
 
for  a period extending .
)ver  two gubernatorial
 
administr ation
 r
iow the,-e 
 has been zero  local government
 
funds allocated  for the maintenance of Samoan arts and
 
crafts.  The American Samoa Arts Council  is the only such
 
state or territorial arts organization  in the nation that
 
operates solely on  federal grants without any local
 
f
inancial support.
 
A major program supported entirely by the Arts Council
 
is  the Jean P.  Haydon Museum in Fagatogo on the  island of
 
Tutuila--the only museum in both American and Western Samoa.
 
y
 
G
 
The museum is housed  in a building owned and maintained by
 
the American Samoa Government.  Its exhibit  wing is now
 
entirely unusable,  indeed unsafe ; because for more than five
 
years now the government has refused  to perform essential
 
t
 
repairs  to the building's roof.  Repeated entreaties have
 
brought  repeated promises;  allocation bills have even been
 
passea  by the  legislature,  but the funds never seem to
 
materialize.  The museum's collection  itself has dwindled
 
drastically as opportunistic administrators have treated  it
 
a
:
:  a warehouse  .
)
f booty.  There are no funds for acquisitions
 
or ever
, maintenance of what remains  in the collection.  The
 
museum staff has been  reduced to one curator and one
 
custodian.  The current Governor,  in his third year of
 
office,  has not yet seen fit to appoint a new Board of
 
Director:: for  t
-
.ne  museum to attempt to address these
 
problems.
 
Performance groups chosen by the Arts Council to
 
represent American Samoa at regional and  international
 
festivals must find  funding elsewhere--if they can--as the
 
leca
.l governmert refuses to assist.  Etcetera.  Yet,  the Arts
 
Council  was created by Executive Order of the Governor and
 
is organizationally an agency of the Governor's Office,  and
 
the museum was created by legislative mandate and  is also a
 
budgetary responsibility of the government.  The Historic
 
Preservation Office and the American Samoa Historical
 
Commission  likewise receive no  local support.  All efforts to
 
7
 
establish a Samoan Cultural Center have been defeated
 
through a similar  lack of  local  interest or support.
 
In  the ar,-na of political rhetoric,  however,  cultural
 
conservation  is not  ignored.  In  its published Statistical
 
Digest
. the  local government has claimed to spend close to a
 
quarter of  its annual budget on a category of expenditures
 
described as  "Education and Culture."  While in reality,  its
 
current annual expenditures for support of the Arts Council,
 
museum,  and other cultural programs is nil.
 
but  lack of  institutional support for culture and the
 
arts  is only one (rather western) symptom of the situation
 
we are  looking at.  Two  recent  instances  involving
 
archeological
 ites on Tutuila are informative.
 
Now,  archeology is not an art;  it  is a science,  and it
 
is definetly not a traditional Samoan concern--beyond an
 
interest  in family burial sites.  But from a western. point of
 
view it  is a science that can be a valuable tool  in
 
understanding  ,
;he history and evolution of a people by
 
supplying information about that peopl es past that was not
 
carried forward  in their oral,  material,  or performance
 
traditions.  It can supply evidence that enhances cultural
 
identity;  it is a connection (albeit at times abstract and
 
esoteric)  to the ancestors.  (But then,  what exactly do
 
ancestors have to do with culture?)
 
The two s tes  in question are
 
villages of Leone and Fagasa.  They
 
to archeologists,  as the discovery
 
adze quarry sites  in the
 
are of extreme importance
 
of these two quarries--
-
y .
 
8
 
the most extensive
 
Tutuila"s position
 
evidence  indicates
 
in all of Samoa--has thrown  light upon
 
in pre-European-contact Polynesia.  The
 
that  the  island was in all probability a
 
major supplier of stone tools to much of western Polynesia
 
f
 
and Melanesia.  Tutuilan stone implements from these quarries
 
have been  found as far away as the Solomon
.  Islands.  This
 
information adu
is new importance to the historical self-image
 
of Tutuila,  which in the predominant view of Samoan oral
 
history was priri
iarily an  island for political exiles.
 
Rec,
.ntly,  a contorversy has arisen over roads being cut
 
through these two sites.  On one side of the controversy are
 
those  interested  in Samoan prehistory and the conservation
 
of  cultural artifacts and monuments.  On the other side are
 
those concerned more with the rights of property and freedom
 
from regulator:;  agencies.  Or,  one might say,  the controversy
 
is between the interests of preservation and the interests
 
of progress--in
isofar as road construction can be considered
 
progress.
 
One of thc
-  more  interesting aspects of this controversy
 
is that  it might be construed as a seeming reversal of
 
traditional colonial roles.  It seems to be largely Samoans
 
arguing  Cor the roads and the accompanying destruction of
 
historically meaningful sites,  and white Americans arguing
 
for efforts for cultural conservation.  Those familiar with
 
the history of America's dealings with indigenous peoples
 
might be surprised by this alignment,  Within the past
 
several years,  for  instance,  major court battles have been
 
I? 
waged by the Yurok Indians  in the Pacific Northwest and by
 
native Hawaiians against_ just the type of road-cutting
 
destruction of t
.raditicaal  lands and sites that the
 
primarily Samoan  interests  in these  instances are arguing
 
for. 
Of course the controversy is nowhere near so simple.
 
There  is a sort of  '
'town/gown" dichotomy of  local interests
 
vs.  outside academic experts,  So,  a few off-island Ph.D
 
types have come here,  poked around on other people's
 
p
;-operty,  picked up pieces of stDne and taken them back to
 
wherever they'd come from;  and then they wrote reports that
 
were read only by a han ,lfull of other palagi eggheads.  What
 
does that have to do with our getting on with life and
 
development here on Tutuila?
 
Another aspect of this controversy is the conflict
 
between  regulatory agencies and  land owners,  a conflict fed
 
by the  intense emotions that always accompany questions of
 
land and property rights  in Samoa.  The American Samoan
 
Government has adopted American-style regulations that
 
recognize sites of particular historic  importance as having
 
certain rights,  in so far as they belong,  in a sense,  to all
 
Samoans and not merely to those on whose  land they happen
 
now to be  located.  But  ,hose regulations n
,ust be enforced to
 
be meaningful,  and the people charged with that enforcement
 
are most often people from some downtown agency,  not a local
 
chief.
 
z
.
 
t
o
 
My feeling  is that the majority of Samoans really
 
couldn  t care  less about the archeological evidence of their
 
prehistory or even about their prehistory itself.  It  is not
 
an active part of their cultural  identity.  Samoans--like
 
most people--live  in the present,  and what is past is past--
except where their own family's titles and  lands are
 
concerned.
 
The e frustrations of the cultural conservationist that
 
I have been discussing are ultimately the result of the
 
attempt to establish an  institutional Samoan  identity.  They
 
arise from false or unstiared expectations,  from an improper
 
projection of values,  and from confusion over what
 
ccrrstitutes a culture or a cultural  identity.  What I have
 
been grousing about are the failures to establish the power
 
points of such e
rn  institutional  identity-
--a museum,  a
.
 
cultural center,  a meaningful historic preservation program.
 
But to what extent,  really,  is this  institutionalized
 
cultural  identity representative of the actual Samoan
 
culturai  identity? And  co what extent do the frustrations
 
arise fr;m native Samoans rather naturally resisting these
 
well-intentioned attemp.s to enroll their fa'asamoa into--in
 
Marcuse"s phrase--"the administered world"?
 
1 happen  to think  ,hat  it  is essential at this
 
precarious point  in time for every effort to be made to
 
establish an  i
nstitutional Samoan  identity.  The generation
 
of young American Samoans even now entering adulthood need
 
I
 
14 
such a reference point  i
n order to make sense of their own
 
identity and maintain a healthfully evolving Samoan cultural
 
i
dentity.
 
But those of us engaged in such an endeavor must
 
a
 
recognize that what we are doing is introducing this concept
 
of "cultural conservation"  into a vigorous indigenous
 
society that has never before isolated the concept of.
 
conservation from the actuality of being alive in a
 
continuous world,  a society that remains admirably adverse
 
to outside regulations while rapidly internalizing a host of
 
outside influences.  How long can one enjoy motorcars before
 
accepting speed limits?
 
In the final analysis,  the rhetoric is all
 
institut.onal rhetoric which is sometimes thrown back, and
 
the reality is that culture,  as always,  (whatever it is or
 
may be becoming) muddles on.

liven the issues I've been trying to raise, what sort of
 
postures  s u g g e s t $  the mselves  for  us?
 Here are  three  of  mi ne;
 
add your own.
 
l) Anarc'zist. 
In order to keep fragile,  smaller social entities in-
tact and out of the public's and the goverfi
nent's control, we
 
might fund local people to give them strength in the face of
 
modernity; randomize funding such that no patterns can develope
 
t
hat point out these groups; in short, do what we can to block, a 
totalizing perspective from forming in centers of power.
 
Were, we tabe stock of the mood of the country,  and finding
 
it one of xaaaagxgakadistrusting government intervention and
 
centralizing control, we embrace it,  roll with it, but point the
 
way for people to use it and triumph with it.
 If bureaucracy is
 
a problem because it creates confusion,  it is also possible to
 
encourage the spreading of bureaucratic functions--say,  encouraging
 
thearts in agencies all over the country.
 To quote a Polish artist
 
on the situation with government support in Poland,  "Confusion is
 
the best thing we have going for g
as.
 It keeps us free.")
 
2)  Radical Conservative. 
Aid in creating a totalizing perspective
 
in Washington and across the country;  put everyone in America in
 
the driver's seat; spread the power and control eve{ where, or at
 
least make knowledge about power and control available; expose the
 
forces working against the folk# see t
he Folk Arts Program as
 
an educational force., etc.
 
3)Fragmatic. 
Assume responsibility for everything; aid in the
 
shaping of definitions of folk arts, culture,  tradition,  etc.;  clarify
 
public and government values; educate; become a force to reckon with;
 
lead the way; if government shapes and determines much of life,
 
join in th
.e determining; focus moneys along NxiixfAx2ixx;J the lines
 
of well-defined rationales; leave nothing to chance; rule out
 
sCelr
is
 
nothing;  if nostalgia az a soft form of folklore, seek out and
 
trust its critical sides--nostalgia as an incomplete committ;aent
 
to the existing social order,_
 
Q
.
 Guess which one I go for?
 
Types of Audience-Performer :
relationships
 
Let's use a r
.
1at -rix in order to talk about audience-Derformance
 
relationships,  and,  as a model,  limit ourselves to questions of
 
ethnicity, although the general principle can be extended to
 
other relationships.
 
I want to make distinctions between performances where A)
 
members of an ethnic group
 erform arts which trey identify as
 
their own for their own group;
 ) members perform arts of their
 
own for other groups; C)  members perform arts identified with other
 
groups for their own group;  and D) members perform arts identified
 
with other groups for other groups.

The first case (A)  can be illustrated by instances such as Iiddish
 
theatre  (certainly up to the early 1940's);  Irish dancing schools
 
and concerts in :
nary of the larg-r cities of the U.S.; clack
 
caberets  (dinner and dance shows c

radio and TI programing;  and "sepia" films  (black films made for

outsiders may be part of the audi^nce,  there is no concern withh

(L)  is the most noted case, perhaps, with such examples as
 
foil: performers at national folk fetivals, vative American per-
formances for tourists, black musicians whb work primarily for
 
white audiences,  etc.
 All relocate their performances for diff-
erent settings from those in which they were created and shaped.
 
It is also possible to include here performances which are ident-
ified with specific groups when they're performed in public, but
 
are never performed by them for their own members:  examples of
 
the latter include Gypsy fortune telling and some of their music,
 
some
 
and/black comics in films before the 1950's.
 
(
C) is a complex case, where members of one group model them-
selves after, parody or imitate another groups' performances
 
(especially where one group has higher social standing in the
 
larger society, which presentes some interestign; issues.

include the minstrel show, much of the work of stand-up comics,
 
and God knows how much of American culture in general.
 
In (D) members of one group perform the arts of another group
 
for the ot',er group, and in effect become full-time specialists
 
in others' cultures.
 Fistorically,  this has been a much more
 
important relationship than it may be now, but one still finds
 
the occasional black band that cab play the music of various
 
white ethnic grours (for example, the string band of Martin, Bogan

 But my point here
 
is to try and shed a different light on some of the social •
relation-

ips involved in the folk arts,  and to see how differently they
 
might look from this angla.
 Note that what we sometlmes call
 
"commercialized" folk culture most often falls in box (B), what
 
we call "revival" falls in (C) and "nationalistic" music and dance
 
appears in (A).

L
 
Some General Notes on the
 alaation of Festivals
 
(perhaps
 to other folk arts presentations)
 
Things to assess and ask for grantees to assess:
 
1. The impact of the festival on its audience and its particirants. 
'
.
9e need first a clear statement frc?i grantees on what impact
 
they seek and what can be expectedt  then we can expect them to
 
access how well it was accpmplished.
 But we may also have to
 
court on advisers here to. ,rea&&M tell us what happened locally.
 
1
Some attention might -be given by the Program to the role or
 
advisers in :
-eneral--what can be expected of them, their relation
 
to folk intellectuals,  their relation to academic affairs,  etc.
 
But we also need to think about the role of local experts--how
 
do you find them, how do we judge them,  etc.)
 
Considerable thought needs to be given by the Program to what
 
"native" cooeptions of festivals are and how "ours" gear into
 
them.
 My experience with festivals suggests to me that � ey
 
are attractive generally only to a small group of middle  nd
 
upper-class people of a special type; they certainly do n�t
 
reach as many as they could nor do they fulfill their promise.
 
- 1 
2
. The make-up of the audience and the particibants. 
This point dovetails or overlaps with the first: how many were
 
there and who were they?  And who and how many were involved in
 
the presentation?  We generally know a good deal about who
 
performed, but not about who attended: the bias is understandable,
 
but not really acceptable.
 Again, drawing on my experience, we
 
are seeing a very limited. number of people attend festivals, of a
 
very special type.
 TherGare seldom many older people, for
 
example, and no apparent attempts are made to get them out--
by special bases,  special seating arrangements, visiting old
 
folks homes, etc.; ditto many other special groups--the ill,
 
the "marginal," etc.
 Consider hoer little multi-lingual ad-
vertising goes on for festivals,  even where they feature multi-
lingual performers (in Philadelphia, for example,  the two lang-
uage communities nev er see each other's advertsing, so split is
 
thesef media).
 These questions get very tricky, of course,
 
because with special audiences special concerns follow--with
 
the aged,  there is fear of crime and crowds, special food needs,
 
weather prohlems,  etc.
 But there are also special problems with
 
family-oriented festivals,  too.
 Fortunately, Jos dilson's
 
,wide deals with some of these.
 
"  The type, range and quality of the performances presented.
 
Again, this is something which we at the Program in theory know
 
something about in advance.
 But I have my doubts sometimes.
 
I
've been worried many times about
 _insensivitivity towards
 
"native" distinctions between sacred and secular: '
saving a special
 
sacred music concert on Sunday with all of God's religions on '
rand
 
i  just not enou;h, nor is it in good taste by all taste standards,.
 
V

. The quality and level of the commentary and information on
 
Uerformers available to the audiences.
 
T
'r
.,is is the educational f
:
-inc tion.
 It '
cegins with publicity and
 
I suppose goes on after t
11e festival is over,
 The media are
 
notoriously insensitive to festi,.

; ran ;es
 
from outri ht lack of interest to blatent stereotyping of the
 
performers and the festivals.
 It requires more t
iougi,t than we
 
;
:ave given it in the past.
 
Programs are a special
 #er, and again Jos ailson's book is
 
helpful, but we need to stress that this is not a matter to
 
be taken lightly by grantees. Programs might well have bibliog-
raphys, maps, means of contacting the performers for work, many
 
things we have not seen usually.
 And we might consider re-
quiring some kind of minimal program from each festival, perhaps
 
providing special funds for th en.
 
Crafts people take special care in this matter, and we might
 
think of providing visual models for grantees to follow in suci.
 
presentations.
 I
've n
_P
 been impressed with the presentations
 
of crafts at festivals.
 
Presenters,  too, are a part of this question.
 
The Quali t
y and type of production. 
My guess is that we underplay this issue in the name of folksi-
ness, but there is no contradiction in putting on folk per-
formers in the best of circumstances.
 
a.  sound equipment and the obtrusiveness of technicians.
 
b. physical layout,  seating, standing,  transportation, signs
 
and the like.

Few Personal Thoughts on Public Sector Folklife Work
 
�d�►n�-
, Wr'I E 1 f
 
�
 Iz
 q
 J
�
-
:
 
The entire field of public sector folkli�-e has grown by leaps
 
and bounds during the last decade.
 The most visible growth has
 
occurred at the federal level (NEA, NEH, Smithsonian, Library of
 
Congress) and in the proliferation of state folk cultural programs
 
(which will soon number over forty), but municipal agencies,
 
museums,  libraries, historical societies and other public institutions
 
have also experienced new and increased public folklife programming.
 
This past decade might be called the "legitimizing" decade.
 
With emphasis on products and presentation, we have all tried, and
 
succeeded by-and-large, to legitimize folk cultural expression
 
within that larger realm of cultural expression.
 The films,
 
festivals, and exhibits have been directed primarily, though not
 
exclusively, at audiences whose cultural backgrounds are different
 
than those of the cultures being presented.
 With aims of
 
legitimizing minority cultural expressions, we have brought these
 
expressions,  in attractive gift-wrapped packages, to mainstream
 
America. b erhaps we'll reverse that process at some point and
 
present the Dothan Country Club's Tuesday afternoon bridge club
 
to the members of the Greater Old Salem Baptist Church in Rocky
 
Head
., Alabama on a fifth Sunday afternoon (fifth Sunday, of
 
course, because nothing else will be going on).)
 
All these films,  festivals, exhibits and other pretty packages
 
have served, and, indeed shall continue to serve, a very important
 
function.
 When presented with sensitivity and dignity, these
 
packages do serve to legitimize cultural expressions of great
 
beauty and power.
 
1
 
2
 
During this decade of presentation and legitimization we have
 
struggled with questions of cultural manipulation.
 Of course we
 
are manipulating culture,  as is McDonalds,  cable television, welfare,
 
and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.
 We are supposedly trained
 
(indeed, more highly trained, on the average,  than most cultural
 
workers) to locate,  identify,  and work with traditional  cultural
 
expressions.
 We are cultural brokers.
 
As we enter this next decade I would hope that we take this
 
duty of cultural brokering in all its implicit seriousness.
 
As the field of public sector folklife continues to grow and
 
mature,  I feel we need to redirect our attention away from the
 
product and the presentation toward the community and individual
 
(the constituents).
 
I see a real problem with conferences and workshops that
 
address themselves to such topics as "Archiving," "Regional Folklife
 
Projects," "Media Production."
 I
'm afraid public sector folklife
 
has become too product oriented;  indeed we seem to place more
 
emphasis and attention on the product  (film,  festival,  exhibit)
 
than we do on the community or individual.
 I fear that we too
 
often view the product as an end goal rather than as a tool toward
 
achieving a more abstract goal.
 
As public sector folklorists our constituency is defined
 
quite clearly as those folk practitioners from diverse cultural
 
and ethnic backgrounds whose cultural expressions help define
 
their community's worldview.
 Our function should be,  quite
 
simply,  to service the needs of that constituent group.
 Our
 
primary role should be neither documentation nor preservation,
 
but rather advocacy.
 
3
 
I
' m afraid public sector folklorists have been too timid in
 
pursuit of an activist role.
 Other arts administrators have not.
 
The visual arts administrator,  for instance,  does not limit his
 
work to documenting and presenting the visual arts of his region.
 
He,  instead,  acts as a visual artists advocate,  providing services
 
exhibition opportunities,  facililating commissions,  helping
 
provide legal services,  economic opportunities,  and all
. the while
 
trying to educate the public toward an understanding of the artist
 
and his work while allowing the
 
integrity.
 Similar
 
arts administrator,
 
is the case
 
artist
 
of the
 
etc.
 They work to
 
cultural,  and economic atmosphere that
 
work,  create,  and evolve.
 
Such, perhaps,  should be the role of the public sector
 
folklorist.
 The difference between the folk arts administrator
 
and the visual arts administrator is that one deals with community
 
aesthetic expression where the other deals with individual aesthetic
 
expression.
 But that is the only difference.
 The folk arts
 
administrator can still pursue a constituent-oriented program,
 
acting as advocate to traditional communities helping to provide
 
those communities with the same access to public money and services
 
that is provided to other arts constituencies,  and facilitating
 
the creation of a social,  cultural,  and economic atmosphere that
 
will allow traditional expression to thrive, change, or disappear
 
according to the needs, will,  and desires of the community.
 
Legitimization must be a continuing process,  and products
 
(
films, festivals,  exhibits,  etc.) are often the most effective
 
services we can provide to traditional communities; but,  at the
 
same time, with the degree of legitimization we have thusfar
 
to maintain his creative
 
dance administrator, media
 
help provide a social,

and timidity that has characterized much of our work and assume a bolder
 
posture of cultural activism as advocates to traditional communities.

 For example, both folk music and
 
avant garde musics can be included within what can roughly be
 
called a Northern Earipean folk performance frame (

et ahother consi,leration:  t
here is reason to believe that
 
the U
.S. now has among its residents many of the leading
;
 
folk artists of the world--at least this is� rue of the Scots,  the
 
and
 
Irish, Caribbean dancers,/Zalkan crafts pr

zgeriating a -ba-t:e we ac least have many of the world's f
inest
 �
 
in performance on a more or less regular basis,  even if not
 
available to eveycne in the country.  What arc the implications
 
of this stat- of affairs?  1
4hat are our responsibilities?
 
Addenda to the section on Folk Arts
 
I don't believe that we have a list of the arts of all the
 
peoples  who live in th- U.S.
 Perhaps we don't even have a complete
 
list for one people.
 And I don't think this is such as bad th.in�.
 
X
11 t
}
;ough a sufficentl.y broad definition and listing of arts
 
might fully contain thr
. -
+at.
 it also, runs the risk of containin f?
 
everything.
 FUrtherm
iorr, a narrow definition of art opens th^ door
 
to t
)-.
e possibility uL becoming ethnoccentric and ruling
, out various
 
peoples' artistic forms anti behaviors.
 For example,  since all arts
 
p-rformed by m-mb-rs of ethnic groups are not public events ( such as
 
C ',t
1
,.
 
'
r
.arv-st festivals practiced within some Slavic groups,  some men's
 
-
tames played in Italian-American bars,  etc.) no one in America is
 
in a position to name all of the
 arts.
 This is partic-
ula:ly important when you consider that among some groups,  arts
 
performed publically are not viewed as arts within the group's
 
aesti,etic--s'loi+ is especially the case where  to group's EXX
 
xmmtkatixx such as Gypsies are established performers of other
 
pecplas'  culture.
 Py the same
. token, all arts do not require

For suci. reasons the arts cannot be gro ,iped under a simple
 
i
efiniti,)n and an ire

Life-as-art is taken for granted by preliterate peoples  many
 
of whom have no word for it.  . . . In such societie s,  art
 is
 
invisible:  it belongs to that pervasive environment which eludes
 
perception.
 It serves as a means of merging the individual
 
and his environment.  . . .
 
In native societies I know first-hand,  art belongs to ordin-
ary day-to-day experiences:  the  way a father addresses his son,
 
decorates his house door, butchers a pig,  dances,  puts on his
 
loin cloth in the morning or addresses his guardian spirit.
 
From "Art and the  Declassification and Reclassificiation of
 
Knowledge," Proposals for Art Education, The carnegie Corporation
 
of New York,  New York,  1970,  p.  36.
