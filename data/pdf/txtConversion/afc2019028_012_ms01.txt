Abstract: Vivian Nolcox is descended from the Nolcox family who settled in Gibson County,
Indiana in the late 1830s. The Nolcox’s were originally free people of color from Virginia who
moved to Tennessee around the early 1810s. The Nolcox and the Lyles families lived next to
each other in Tennessee, married into each other’s families and moved together to Indiana when
white men in Tennessee rewrote the state constitution making it illegal for African-descended
people to own guns (for more information on the Lyles and Nolcox families see The Bone and
Sinew of the Land by Anna-Lisa Cox). Viviane Nolcox grew up on her family’s successful farm
in Gibson County, Indiana, and went to college. Her son, Travis Nolcox, also has a separate
interview as part of this collection.
