LAW AND ORDER ON THE PLAYGROUND (
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON STABILITY AND CHANGE IN
 
THE TRADITIONAL GAMES OF WHITE MIDDLE CLASS CHILDREN)
 
Some ten years ago on a weekday afternoon, I was standing at the gate of , 
a southern California  -
lementory schoolyard waiting for one of my children,  f
fie
 
last bell of the day finally rang and the children began to pour out past me.
 As
 
the stream  slackened, two little girls aged, I should guess, about nine or ten
 
walked by
 and I heard one of them say, "Let's play '
Step on a crack, break
 
your mother's back'
."
 
"Naw, let's play '
Monkeyfaces' ,"
 her friend said.  "That's l
ots better
 
than '
Step on a crack, break your mother's back'
."  
-
1
1 how do you play 'Monkeyfaces'?"
 
the good thing about  '
Monkeyfaces'  i
s you can step on a
ll  t
he cracks
 
You can just stomp those cracks, you can wipe your feet all over those cracks
 
A
 
The only thing is, you just can't step in a square that's got a monkeyface in i
t.'
 
By this time, I had temporarily abandoned my o
wn child and was trailing the
 
two little girls down the sidewalk.  Eventually they came to a square i
n the
 
pavement which contained the contractor's symbol imprinted in the cement; apparently,
 
this was a "monkeyface" because they leaped over it with ceremonious care, and I
 
watched them walk away, "stomping" with delighted giggles on the cracks they
 
passed 1"wiping their feet all over" others, and now and again taking big running

j
umps over the taboned "monkeyface" squares.

.iJ.y little incident seems to me to contain the most
 
central of the elements that make the realm of play so intriguing and so complex.
 
To use Roger Caillois' d
ese pt4on of the nature of play a
s a starting point,  i
t
 
includes all those distinguishi
-ng characteristics  i  l
 e-basic.  First, the
 
play situation was free, not forced;  (
physical education teachers, take note.)  The
 
children themselves elected to play, thus simultaneously restricting and limiting
 
their o
wn freedom of activity by their own free choice - -
 anê absolutely essential
 
paradox.  Secondly, the activity was separate, not "for real" but distinguished
 
-2-
from all the other methods of walking home by mutual agreement and shared knowledge
 
of the limitations implicit to this particular game.  Thirdly, it was uncertain
  
(
though on a very simple level), the activity itself being unclear as to its
 
outcome.  And fourthly, it was unproductive, except insofar as the children
 
presumably eventually reached their respective houses; however, as soon as the
 
game began, their arrival home became not the essential objective of the activity
 
but simply its terminal point.
 
*
 
Lastly, the activity was governed by rules, not the everyday traffic and
 
behavioral rules, but special rules within which limits the children were free
 
to improvise and innovate -
-
 indeed, to I
tpl ay
.
H
 
This latitude of the player .
.. i
s equally accountable
 
for the remarkable and meaningful uses of the term
 
"play", such as are reflected in such expressions as
 
the playing of a performer or the play of a gear, to
 
designate in the one case the personal style of an
 
interpreter, in the other the range of movement of
 
the parts of a machine
 (p.8)
 
*1 am deliberately omitting, as not germane to this particular argument, Caillois'
 
sixth characteristic, make-believe, which he describes as functioning in alternation
 
to the fifth, governed by rules. In other words, play may contain rules or
 
make-believe, but not both.

L,
 
Play in action, however, is always more complex than play in analysis.  As
 
I watched my two little girls, it became obvious that the principal emotional
 
delight of the activity for them l
ay in the fact that they were doing more than
 
playing "Monkeyfaces"; they were also not playing, "Step on a crack, break your
 
mother's back."  The special quality of pleasure hinged upon their knowledge of
 
both games, not just the one they elected to play.  Were there, indeed, two games;
 
or was one possibly a reverse image of the other -
-
 in that sense, a permissable
 
variation in the rules?
 
-3-
The f
olklorist tends to pose this kind of problem in t
erms of stability
 
and variation in traditional forms.  And, when dealing with children's
 
traditional materials, he finds that he i
s confronted by both dimensions
 
stretched to their utmost extent.  The historical continuity of children's

Again, the pleasure intrinsic t
o parody -
-
 which i
s only a kind of variation,
 
after a
ll -
-
 seems t
o l
ie in a sort of double vision; one must know the original
 
in order t
o savor the adventuresomeness of the variation, and thus, to some extent,
 
both are reinforced.  In this sense, i
t seems quite possible that only those
 
cultural i
tems which are susceptible to change have much chance of survival; and
 
this may in part account for the l
ongevity of the child's own tradition wherein
 
variation flourishes.
 
r, e
.
 
I am suggesting, then, that the apparently parado
cal co-existence oAstablllty
 
and variation within oral tradition.  Let us see how this works in a few concrete
 
situations.  Folklorists sometimes distinguish between two types of children's
 
traditional information;,
that which they learn from adult sources and that which
 
they l
earn from their peers.  The games that Brian Sutton-Smith call  "games of
 
individual skill," generally fall into the latter category; such activities as
 
j
acks, ball bouncing and hopscotch are generally l
earned by simply watching other
 
children at play.
 
Most of these games are extremely tightly structured.  To take the game of
 
jø ks a
s an example, each player in turn must maneuver through a l
engthy sequence
 
of orderly and highly restricted movements, any variation in which requires the
 
player to give up his turn to the next player.  In actual play, however, in spite of the
 
l
arge number of stringent requirements on which agreement i
s general:
 (
 a player
 
may not move any jack except the one in play; all jacks must be picked up first one
 
a
t a time, then two at a time and s
o f
orth; a player who doesn't catch the ball on
 
one bounce has "missed", etc.) there are a large number of variables which are
 
f
ree-floating and considered open to discussion.
 
A
 
The order in which the various moves (or sub-games) are
 
made is a case in point; most children start with "babies" (or "plairisies"
 
in which each jack is simply picked up without additional flourish s,
 
but after the first round, any or all of the following moves may be
 
required:
 
Pigs in the pen
 
Eggs in the Basket
 
Up
 Si es
 
Downsies
 
Pick the cherry, eat the cherry, throw the pit away
 
Through the Golden Gate
 
Babies in the high chair
 
Babies in the low chair
 
Around the worlds
 
Rolling down Broadway
 
Shooting stars
 
Up quicks
 
Down quicks
 
No bouncies
 
etc.
 
are
 
The order in which these various sub-games/ta played has varied with
 
rou n
d
 
every game reported to me; it apparently negotiable each time a gxm
is
 
taxa
utakaicx of jacks is proposed.
 
And when the sequence has been a greed upon, there are
 
still a number of points of play that are open to a number of kinds
 
of settlement.  What is to be done about "kissies" (two jacks that
 
land touching each other) or "haystakcs" (one jack on top of another)?
 
Sometimes such jacks may be rethrown; sometimes they are considered
 
misses, and the thrower loses his turn.  Can you play "cart before the
 
horse" (
in which a player working on his "
foursies" is allowed to pick
 
up the ten jacks in the order of two, four and four, rather than four,
 
four and two)?  In between games, do you have to"graduate"
x wticg
 
by throwing the jacks in the air and catching as many as possible on the
 
back of the hand, or does play simply continue?
 
The significant point here is that agreement on all these
 
latter questions is only temporary; all rules reached are considered to
 
be in e
ffect only for the duration of the particular play session about
 
to begin.  Although children who often play together may evolve a mu-
tually acceptable routine, should one of or the other grow bored with the
 
arrangement, it is these points that would be open to re-negotiation, not
 
the "regular" rules.  Essentially, then, the traditional rules for playing
 
jacks are constructed to include a variation factor which is actually
 
a part of the rules themselves and which, through millions of rounds
 
of play, has successfully resisted all the powerful forces of stabiliza-
tion.
 
Observation of other traditional games indicates that
 
many of them contain a similar ratio of stability and variation factors.
 
Even more significantly, it appears that in games where the rules have
 
been officially stabilized by adult invention or degree, children have
 
countered by inventing their own areas of variation.
 
In many public schools in the Los Angeles area, the
 
traditional games such as jacks, jump rope, marbles and the like have
 
either been forbidden outright or are strongly discouraged.  Official
 
explanations of this state of affairs vary, but the general impression
 
emerges that the traditional games lead to "
fighting", they are disorderly
 
and hard to police.  The children instead are encouraged (and in some
 
cases required) to play officially approved games: most prominently,
 
tether ball, handball and four square.
 (Of the traditional games of
 
individual skill, hopscotch appears to be the principal one to have
 
passed the adult stability test; an unbariable diagram is occasionally
 
observable painted on the playground blacktop).
 
In the case of handball, tether ball and foursquare,
 
officially approved descriptions of the game are available in various
 
manuals for physical education teachers.  Most printed rules for hand-
ball, for instance, indicate that play stops i
f
 
a
. The ball is hit after it bounces twice
 
b
. The ball is hit on the fly
 
c
. The ball does not rebound past the 6 foot line
 
on the serve
 
d
.  The ball rebounds outside the court boundaries
 
e
.  A good serve is not made in two trials
 
f
.  A player interferesw with the play of another
 
xzexf xtk
 
and so forth.  The actual play of children observed in several Southern
 
California elementary school playgrounds, however, indicates that they
 
tacitly ignore points c
. and e
. and -
-
 normally before play begins
 
"tap" that the following be out or fair.
 
"Fifty-fifties" or "
Pop-ups"  Ball hits where wall and
 
ground meet.
 
"Waterfalls".  The ball slides up the face of the board.
 
Dead Killers.  The ball rolls back, preventing further
 
play.
 
Babies.  A low, soft hit.
 
Heebie-jeebies.
 Interference (noterule f
. above)
 
and so forth, through a list of perhaps twenty permutations.  Further,
 
play can be "locked out" by allowing no more players; a "tea party" can
 
be held, allowing only two players to participate; or the call can go
 
up for "pink elephants" in which some players line up against the board and
 
try to avoid being hit by the others.  Yone of the above variations
 
appear in the rule books, and very few teachers appear even to be aware
 
that the children are playing by their,
 own rules.

Thus in the life-style of the playground ,
 there appears t
o be
 
a kind of naiad  fundamental need for a bifurcated game structure, one
 
axis to consist of the unchangable rules and the other those aspects
 
of the game which are subject to variation.
 This then suggests -
-
 to
 
return briefly to our original problem -
-
 that the games "
Step On a
 
Crack" and "Monkeyfaces" are indeed two aspects of the same thing.
 
After all, "Step On a Crack" has an extremely simple structure; it has
 
only one rule, so to speak, so that a built-in variation factor is im-
possible:
w hence, the necessity of inventing a reversal or parody.  The
 
existence of the "two" games then allows the players the same leeway for
 
attaining temporary agreement that the variation factor permits in other
 
traditional games.
 
For it is critical to remember  that the agreement is xsx x
 
only temporary; it must be affirmed and re-affirmed each time play
 
begins via a pre-play discussion period which may be both prolonged
 
and vociferous.
 Indeed even after play is under way its course may
 
be altered by the shout of one player" "I tap...." or "Dibs on...."
 
The interjection of these magical formulae requires immediate readjust-
ment to the new "rule" on the part of all the players; lacking this,
 
the entire group shatters into passionate splinter units, the better
 
to debate the  
.
 
t3xS xhtg1I Not infrequently it can be observed that a group will use
 
the entire time available for play in a bitter -
-
 but apparently re-
freshing -
-
 discussion over the "rules"; no one seems to mind, really,
 
that the game never gets played.  No wonder the decibel rate o  our
 
it is so high; floating over our
 r=—s 
 taxlka are the
 
shrill intense voices of a thousand decision-makers at work, testing,
 
probing, re-arranging, counter-posing -
-
 all very exhausting and un-
necessary to a tt vxxxti
 tidier-minded adult world.
 
For variation can certainly result in disorder; there is
 
absolutely no doubt about that.
 However, it can also promote flexibility
 
and the knack of achieving compromise.  Our children appear to have
 
taken their cultural stance; they will cheerfully risk chaos any day
 
to
 
in order l
im preserve a
 satisfactory degree of group or individual
 
autonomy.
 It is-even possible that they are right, that in terms of
 
the democratic life style it is more important for them to practice
 
reaching and working within a temporary consensus than to learn obedi-
ence to an unchanging set of requirements.,
 
-
'The temptation to elaborate at this point is almost ir-
resistable; a number of juicy observations concerning the necessity of
 
flexibility in American adult role behavior and the temporary nature
 
of our decision-making and codification processes come immediately
 
to mind.  However, these are not only far beyond the scope of this
 
paper but quite outside my own area of expertise.  Further, even from
 
the limited perspective of this examination of play behavior, it is
 
clear that a great deal of work needs to be done before more than educa-
ted guesses can be made.  For example, much might be learned from a sys-
tematic examination of a number of traditional games in order to discover
 
if any coherent pattern exists determining which factors are stable
 
and which are in variation, as well as what kinds of variations are
 
allowable.
 To my knowledge, this has yet to be done.
 
However, if the above observations are accurate--- and I
 
believe they are -
-
 it is quite clear that there are deep cultural
 
processes at work in our childrensIx apparently off-hand selections
 
not only of what games they will play but, more critically, how they
 
will play them.  Perhaps we should try to understand these processes
 
better before we so casually - -
 and so ineffectually -
-
 interfere by
 
administrative fiat, invention or codification.  For clearly our children,
 
as they play, are grappling with an issue of central importance to a
 
democratic society - -
 the interlock u x f of order and flexibility,
 
individual freedom and group consensus, stability and change.

necessity of flexibility in American adult role behavior and
 
the temporary nature of our decision-making and codification
 
processes come immediately to mind.  However, these are not
 
only far beyond the scope of this paper, but quite outside
 
my own area of expertise.  Further, even from the limited
 
examination of play behavior, it is clear that a great deal of
 
work needs to be done before more than educated guesses can be
 
made.  For example, much might be learned from a systematic
 
examination of a number of traditional games in order to discover
 
if any coherent pattern exists determining which factors are
 
stable and which are in variation, as well as what kinds of
 
variations are allowable.
 To the best of my knowledge, this
 
has yet to be done.
 
However, if the above observations are accurate -
-
and I believe they are -
-
 it is quite clear that there are
 
deep cultural processes at work in our childrens' apparently
 
off-hand selections not only of what games they will play but,
 
more critically, how they wi].l play them.  Perhaps we should
 
try to understand these processes better before we so casually

(Some observations on stability and change in the traditional gaines of
 
white middle-class children)
 
Some ten years ago on a weekday afternoon, I was standing
 
at the gate of a southern California schoolyard waiting-for one of my
 
children, when the final bell of the day rang and the children began
 
to pour out past me.  AS the stream slackened, two little girls aged,
 
I should guess, about nine or ten, walked by and I heard one of them
 
say, "Let's play '
Step on a crack, break your mother's back'."
 
"yaw, let's play 'onkeyfaces'," her friend said.
 "T
hat's
 
lots better than '
Step on a crack, break your mother's back'."
 
"
I don't know how you play '
Ionkeyfaces'."
 
"Oh, theg ood thing about '
ionkeyfaces' is you can step
 
on p
 J
J
,
. the cracks.  You can just sto-n
o on those cracks, you can wipe
 
your feet all ove
,r those cracks!  The only thing is, you just can't
 
step in a square that's got a morLkeyf
 ace in it."
 
By this time, I had temporarily aba n
doned my own child and
 
was trailing the two little girls down the sidewalk.
 Eventually they
 
came to a square in the pavement w.ich contained the
 
symbol imprinted in the cement; apparently, this was a "monkeyf
 ace"
 
because they leaped over it with ceremonious care, and I watched them
 
walk away, "
stomping" wi t
h delight e
d giggles on the cracks they passed,
 
"wiping their feet all
, over" others, and now and again taking big
 
running jumps over the tabu "morikeyface" squares.

 Three successive workshops at the American
 
Orthopsychiatric Association annual meetings and a meeting Of
 
game developers with potential game users at NIMH have identi-
fied a host of "game" people from Head Start through graduate
 
school.
 Some of the thoughts and endeavors of these people are,
 
we feel,  worth sharing with others,  especially teachers,  curri

culum consultants,  school administrators,  school psychologist:,
 
and other school personnel.

Dear Loyda:
 
V
 
Your letter caught me j
ust as I was about to type li
p a re-write of my book
 
chapter for s
ubmission to the Southern Folklore Quarterly. Actually, I had
 
already re-written i
t twice before, but had not been satisfied with the
 
res I
ts.
 
The upshot of all this revising i
s that I no l
onger remember which (
or what)
 
version I sent you.  I don't suppose there i
s any f
urther editorial work I
 
could do at this point, i
s t
here?  I had not really l
ike the concluding pages,
 
and the opening section of the original grew to seem a hit sentimental and
 
flowery; but, as I say, I no longer remember which version you have.
 
The other thing that troubles me i
s the bibliography and footnoting, now, of
 
course, far out of date.  If there would be any possibility, in other words,
 
ot my having a fresh whack at the mss.. I
'd like to do i
t, and I
'd also pro-
mise to take no more than a week to the j
ob, since I was, as I say, all ready
 
to go here.  See what you can do for me, though I certainly do not want to
 
gum up the works in any serious way.
 
As for journal publication, shall I proceed with that angle?  Perhaps i
t would
 
be better to drop that idea entirely, though if i
t adds to the prestige qual-
i
ty of the book, I think I can "sell" it quickly - -  if not to the Southern
  
Folklore Quarterly, then to Western Folklore for sure.  (The l
atter has been
 
asking for i
t, but I have published a good bit with them, and I understand one
 
gets academic "brownie points" by publishing in more than one journal.)
 
I am so very sorry to hear about the break-up of your marriage.  These seem to
 
be difficult times for everyone; I do believe that what they're calling these
 
days "future shock" has an awful l
ot to do with i
t •
 There are just too many
 
new adjustments called for each and every day, too many demands being made on
 
the flexibility of our adjustment mechanisms.  I feel like an exhausted rubber
 
band.
 
All is reasonably well with us; my husband has been quite i
ll but now seems to
 
be recovering; our children are scattered all over the globe, from Canada to
 
Nepal.  I do miss them.  As for myself, I keep on teaching, probably too much
 
for my own or my students' good.  In a couple of years, I want to take a genuine
 
year off and get myself de-institutionalized.
 
,
 
With all best wishes,
 
Bess Haves
 
P.S.  As I imagine you have already noticed, Eli Bower's and my names are trans-
posed in the table of contents you sent me.  I appear to have written "Play's the
 
Thing", while poor Eli i
s made responsible for "Law and Order"; I am sure he
 
would object.

Dear Sirsi
 
enclose corrected galleys and the original manuscript for my contri..
 
b tion to the book, Games tn Education and Deve1QPm.nt edited by ELI
.
 
M. Sower and Loyda Shears.
 
I  connection with th
 e time limit specified on the enclosed slip, I
 
at point out that the manuscript was mailed to me, marI d Third
 
Class, on June l3thl it reached my home June 27th.
 1 was out of town
 
d did not return until July 1st.
,  Since I had no way of anticipating
 
arrival of these galleys, there was also no way in which I could
 
spond any faster than 1 am.  The corrections I have made are, it
 
ems to me, modest, and I wish to be sure that they are carried through,
 
teide of a few printer's omissions (check original meso sh
eets for
 
verification) the most serious problems are on the first page.  The
 
ersion of my name which I use for purposes of authorship/publication
 
I  Bess Lomax l
aweej the paragraph which I sent Loyda Shears for use
 
L  the author's biography section includes my name written out in full
 
s above.
 I would greatly appreciate it if this change could be made
 
not only on the first page of the galleys enclosed but anywhere else
 
in the book where it may appear.  This in of great importance to me.
 
The second problem concerns the phrase at the bottom of the first page
 
f galleyes, "Some observations on stability and change in the tradi-
tonal games of white middle-class children".  This phrase was conceived
 
of as a sub-title.
 It should not appear in isolation following the
 
paragraph of editor's comm nte.  Either the phrase should be set up in
 
type L!  a subtitle, or the entire phrase should be omitted •
 I would
 
prefer the former, but would accept the latter if the expense in re-
setting is too great.
 It should not be left the way it is,
 
The other corrections seem to me self explanatory; if there are any fur-
ther questions I can be reached at the above address or by telephone
 
at 2l3 885.3329 or 885 333l.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Haves

PLEASE READ THE FOLLO WING INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
 
BEFORE CORRECTING AND RETURNING THE PROOF
 
Two sets of galley proof and your original manuscript are en-
c
losed.  One  set of proof contains the printer's proofreaders
 
marks and i
s known as the " master set."
 
The r
oaster proof i
s the set t
o be read and corrected by t
he
 
author, and returned through  the editor o
f h
is Series  of t
he
 
A merican Lectures Series, t
o the publisher 
-  not the printer 
-  
with t
he original manuscript (f
low called the "foul copy"). An
 
author should keep the duplicate set of proofs and should mark
 
on i
t t
he sa me corrections t
hat are marked on the master set
 
which i
s returned t
o the publisher.
 
When there are several contributors t
o a book, galley proof will
 
be furnished in t
riplicate.  One set i
s t
o be kept for the senior
 
author's or editor's f
iles. The second set i
s t
o be separated by
 
contributions and sent t
o t
he contributors for correction. The
 
t
hird set (master set) i
s to be retained by t
he senior author or
 
editor and when a
ll corrected sections have been received f
ro m
 
the authors, a
ll corrections are t
o be t
ransferred t
o the master
 
set before i
t i
s returned, with t
he original mansucript, through
 
t
he editor o

f t
he Am erican Lecture Series, t
o t
he

PROOFREADERS S
IGNS
 
Learn t
o use the proofreaders s
igns when making corrections;
 
i
f you cannot do this, write d
istinctly in the margin what you
 
require. Do not assu me that the printer will guess the meaning.

M ARKING TEXT PROOF
 
Use a Pencil: Pencil should be used f

EFFECT OF TEXT PROOF ALTERATIONS
 
I
s a Correction Necessary? The  importance of a correction
 
should be carefully considered, and if i
t i
s really necessary or
 
very desirable, i
t should be made with knowledge of t
he con-
sequences.
 
- 4 -
Alterations  i
n proofs are t
roubleso me, as well as expensive,
 
and should be avoided when not absolutely necessary.
 
All matter t
o be printed has been set by t
he printer t
o confor m
 
to the copy delivered t
o h
i m.
 
What a Correction Entails: Much modern t
ypesetting i
s done on
 
machines which cast a co mplete l
ine of type a
t one t
i me; there-
f
ore, a change of a s
ingle l
etter, or any character, m a l
ine makes
 
i
t necessary to reset the entire l
ine; deletions or insertions o
f
 
one or two words i
n a paragraph often make i
t necessary t
o reset
 
the entire paragraph. A correction at the end of a paragraph, i
n
 
the proof, i
s l
ikely t
o be l
ess costly than one at the beginning
 
where a word added or t
aken out may mean the resetting of many
 
l
ines of type or of t
he whole paragraph and a possible re making
 
of several pages. I
n page proof, particularly, an author should
 
be especially careful t
o make a co mpensating deletion  i
n the
 
sa me l
ine, i
f possible, t
o a
llow f
or an addition; and, a co mpen-
sating addition f
or any deletion. For exa mple, i
f a word i
s added
 
to the f
irst l
ine of a paragraph, a word of the sa me l
ength should
 
be deleted in one of the l
ines im mediately following; so meti mes
 
i
t i
s possible t
o use a short word i
n p
lace of a l
ong one and
 
achieve the sa me results. Otherwise, l
ines may have t
o be car-
r
ied back, or f
orward, t
o the end of t
he chapter. And, i
f a
 change
 
should result i
n the l
ast page of a chapter being extended onto
 
an additional page, not only the page nu mbers, but most l
ikely
 
the page headings, would have t
o be changed t
o t
he end of the
 
book. I
t would be a v
ital correction indeed t
o be worth t
he hu man
 
l
abor and expense involved i
n such a change.
 
I
f there are many corrections, these will produce uneven spacing.
 
When type i
s f
irst set, t
he spacing i
s equal and unifor m. But as
 
changes are made l
ines must be squeezed  t
ight, others  b
lown
 
apart, and t

PROOF RESPONSIBILITY
 
Authors so meti mes assu me that their books receive a critical
 
and careful proof reading in the publisher's office in addition to
 
the reading given the work by the printer's proof readers andby
 
the author. This i
s not a general rule ,nor i
s i
t always necessary.
 
I
t should be understood that i
t i
s not the publisher's duty to do the
 
critical reading of proof. Corrections to text or engravings, up
 
to ten per cent (
10 %)
 of the cost of the original co mposition or
 
engravings will be at the expense of the publisher; corrections
 
above ten per cent (
10 %)
 will be at the, expense of the author.
 
All corrections and additions should be made in galley proof.
 
Errors marked in galley proof which t
he printer fails to make
 
in page proof should be t
he only corrections i
n page proof.

S
ubject:  Recommendation on Professor Bess Lomax Hawes
 
The Department of Anthropology recommends the article "Law and
 
Order on the Playground" by Bess Lomax Hawes for the 1975 Award
 
for Scholarly Publication.
 Professor Hawes was invited to con-
tribute this chapter to the volume Games in Education and Develop-
ment, edited by Loyda M
.  Shears and Eli M. Bower, which explores
 
the use of children's games as educational tools in a school setting
 
In this paper, Professor Hawes has looked at a familiar event-the
 
orderly but spontaneous game-playing of children-and seen in it an
 
illustration of underlying principles of human behavior,  the inter-
action of structure and indeterminacy.
 In thus recognizing the gen-
eral in the familiar,  she has performed a creative act of scientific
 
insight.
 
The fact that Professor Hawes was invited to contribute to the volume
 
Games in Education and Development indicates national recognition of
 
her contributions to the field of American Folklore.
 The article
 
has twofold significance:  1
) it suggests a principle of general appli-
cation to folklore and cultural anthropology, and 2
) it is of value
 
to educators in pointing out the essential nature of spontaneous group
 
decision-making in children's games.
 In elucidating the principles of
 
the game,  she also recognizes its social meaning.
 
The article is clearly and ably written to be read and utilized by
 
concerned educators.
 A xerox  copy of this work is enclosed.

LAW AND ORDER ON THE PLAYGROUND
 
(
This article has been exerpted from a l
onger version appearing in
 
Games in Education and Development, Loyda H
. Shears and Eli M
. Bower, eds.,
 
Charles C
. Thomas, Springfield, I

As Fred Ferretti demonstrates in the previous article, traditional
 
childrens' pastimes rarely disappear completely; they simply change,
 
j " 
adapt
i
n
g
 to any number of varying circumstances.
 In summertime
 
out ern California, where the afternoons are far too hot for vigorous
 
running and all >who can 1seek the solace of the swimming pool or the
 
beach, "Hide and Go Seek" is rarely played.
 Instead there is a "new"
 
game, "Marco Polo", in which swimmers try to outwit and outrace a
 
goal tender guarding a "base" at one end of the pool.
 
I
s this a new game or simply yet another variation on an age-old theme?
 
Folklorists dealing with traditional childrens lore continually confrnnt
 
just this kind of problem, because the twin dimensions of stability
 
and vrjation,are here stretched to their utmost.
 On the one hand,
 
the historical continuitr of childlore is one of the most remarkable
 
aspects of the human condition.  Revolutions, wars, vast migrations of
 
peoples often seem to have had little or no effect upon the private
 
worlds of the children involved.  Some of the counting-out rhymes still
 
chanted on twentieth century playgrounds can be Xxxd traced to Celtic
 
languages spoken by Britons in pre-Roman times.  Spanish-speaking
 
children in the new world still play the singing games that their old-
world cousins play, though an ocean and a two-hundred year time span
 
l
ie between.  Marbles, kites, cats cradle and hopscotch go back before
 
recorded history, and, as a child in Texas, I used to thump on my brother's
 
back in a guessing game mentioned by Petronius.
 
On the other hand, variation is apparently as essential as stability.
 
One of the perplexing difficulties in dealing with childrens' lore is
 
that )
C out of a hundred renditions of the "same" counting out rhyme,
 
for example, almost no two will be exactly identical.  The continual
 
co-existence of stability and variation in childiore is indeed so striking
 
one begins to wonder whether they are not perhaps complementary,3&k.

rather than antithetical.  Maybe, in other words, you mood to have both.
 
In investigating this notionX one summer, I decided to concentrate on
 
watching the actual play of children engaged in those play activities
 
sometimes called "games of individual skill" such as jacks, ball bouncing
 
and hopscotch.  Such games have at least two points in common: they
 
circulate primarily among the seven to tw lve year old age group and they
 
are generally learned informally, by simply watching and l
istening to
 
other children at play.
 
(
Go to last paragraph of att eke zxzti
 xpxgx page 16 of attached
 
article through first paragraph on page 19.)
 
Thus, in the life-style of American children, there appears to be a
 
kind of fundamental needy or requirement, for a bifurcated game structure:
 
one axis consisting of the unchangeable rules and the other those aspects
 
of the game tk which are subject to variation. Some stability is essential
 
so that you can know which game you are playing; on the other hand, there
 
are all those free-floating rules on which you must reach a temporary
 
agreement in order for play to begin.

Thus, in the l
ife-style of American children, there appears to be a
 
kind of fundamental need) or requirement, for a bifurcated game s
tructure:
 
one axis consisting of the unchangeable rules and the other those aspects
 
of the game tk which are subject to variation. Some s
tability i
s e
ssential
 
so that you can know which game you are playing; on the other hand, there
 
are a
ll those free-floating rules on which you must reach a temporary
 
agreement in order for play to begin.

(Some observations on stability and change in the traditional games
 
of white middle-class children.)

at the gate of a southern California schoolyard waiting for one of
 
my children, when the final bell of the day rang and the children
 
began to pour out past me.  As the stream slackened,  two little
 
girls aged,  I should guess, about nine or ten, walked by and I heard
 
one of them say,  "Let's play '
Step on a crack, break your mother's
 
back'
. "
 
"Naw, let's play 'Monkeyfaces'," her friend said.
 "That's
 
lots better than 'Step on a crack, break your mother's back'."
 
"I don't know how you play 'Monkeyfaces'."
 
"Well, the good thing about 'Monkeyfaces'  is you can step
 
on al
l the cracks.
 You can just stomp on those cracks, you can
 
wipe your feet all over those cracks!
 The only thing is, you just
 
can't step in a square that's got a monkeyf
 ace in it."
 
By this time,  I had temporarily abandoned i
n
'
f
r own position
 
and was trailing the two children down the sidewalk.
 Eventually
 
they came to a square in the pavement which contained the contrac-
tor's symbol imprinted in the cement; apparently, this was a "monkey-
face" because they leaped over it with ceremonious care, and I
 
watched them walk away,  "
stomping" with delighted giggles on the
 
cracks they passed,  "wiping their feet all over" others, and now
 
and again taking big running jumps over the tabu "
nionkeyface"
 
squares.

This pithy but quite everyday little incident seems to me
 
to contain the most central of the elements that make the realm of
 
play so intriguing and so complex.  To use Caillois' discussion of
 
the nature of play as a starting  oint, it includes all those charac-
teristics he describes as basic.
 First, the play situation was free,
 
not forced; (physical education teachers, take note.)  The children
 
themselves elected to play, thus simultaneously restricting and limiting
 
their own freedom of activity by their own free choice -
-
 an absolutely
 
essential. paradox.  Secondly, the activity was separate, not "for real"
 
but distinguished from all the other methods of walking home by mutual
 
agreement and shared knowledge of the limitations implicit to this
 
particular game.  Thirdly, it was uncertain (though on a very simple
 
level), the activity itself being unclear as to its outcome.  And
 
fourthly, it was u
ru,roductive, except insofar as the children presumably
 
eventually reached their respective houses; however, as soon as the
 
game began, their arrival home became not the e
ssential objective of
 
the activity but simply its terminal point.

)
 
Lastly,  the activity was governed by rules, not the everyday
 
traffic and behavioral rules, but special rules within which limits
 
the children were free to improvise and innovate -
-
 indeed, to "
play".
 
This latitude of the player .
.. is equally
 
accountable for the remarkable and meaningful
 
uses of the term "play", such as are reflected
 
in such expressions as the playing of a performer
 
or the Play of a gear, to designate in the one
 
case the personal style of an interpreter, in the
 
other the range of movement of the parts of a
 
machine...  (

)  I am deliberately omitting, as not germane to this particular argu-
ment, Caillois' sixth characteristic, make-believe, which he describes
 
as functioning in alternation to the fifth, governed by rules. In other
 
words, play may contain rules or make-believe but not both.  Cf Caillois,

Play in action, however, is always more complex than play
 
in analysis.  As I watched my two little girls, it became obvious that
 
the principal emotional delight of the activity for them lay in the
 
fact that they were doing more than playing "Monkeyfaces"; they were
 
also not playing "Step on a crack, break your mother's back".  The
 
special quality of pleasure hinged upon their knowledge of both games,
 
not just the one they elected to play.  Were there, indeed, two games,
 
or was one possibly a reverse image of the other -
-
 in that sense, a
 
pertnissable variation in the rules?
 
The folklorist tends to pose this kind of problem in terms
 
of stability and variation in traditional forms.  And, when dealing
 
with children's traditional materials, he finds that he is confronted
 
by both dimensions stretched to their utmost extent.  The historical
 
continuity of children's traditional lore is one of the most remarkable
 
aspects of the human condition.  Revolutions, wars, vast migrations
 
of peoples often seem to have had little or no effect upon the private
 
world of the children involved.  Some of the counting-out rhymes
 
still chanted on twentieth centuray playgrounds can be traced to Celtic
 
languages spoken by Britons in pre-Roman times.  Spanish-speaking
 
children in the new world play the same singing games that their old-
world cousins play, though an ocean and a two hundred year time span
 
lie between.  Marbles, kites, cats cradle and hopscotch go back before
 
recorded history, and as a child in Texas I used to thump on my brother's
 
back in a guessing game mentioned by Petronius.
 
At the same time, variation is apparently as essential as
 
stability.  One of the perplexing problems encountered in attempting
 
to organize a collection of children's traditional lore is that out
 
Hawes
 4
 
of a hundred renditions of the "same" counting-out rhyme, for example,
 
almost no two will be exactly identical.  And when adult intervention,
 
print, and other stabilizing forces enter the picture -
-
 as in the
 
case of the nursery (Mother Goose) rhymes, for instance -
-
 then the
 
parodies begin.

Again, the pleasure intrinsic to parody -
-
 which is only
 
a kind of variation, after all -
-
 seems to lie in a sort of double
 
vision; one must know the original in order to savor the adventure-
someness of the variation, and thus, to some extent, both are reinforced.
 
In this sense, it seems quite possible that only those cultural items
 
Hawes  5
 
which are suscei,tible to variation have much chance of survival;
 
and this may in part account for the longevity of the child's own
 
tradition wherein variation flourishes.
 
I am suggesting, then, that the apparently paradoxical co-
existence of rules and innovation within play may be analagous to the
 
co-existence of stability and variation within oral tradition.  Let
 
us see how this works in a few concrete situations.  Folklorists
 
sometimes distinguish between two types of children's traditional
 
information: that which they learn from adult sources and that which
 
they learn from their peers.  The games that Sutton-Smith and Rosenberg
 
1
)
 
call "games of individual skill"  generally fall into the latter
 
category; such activities as jacks, ball bouncing and hopscotch are
 
generally learned by simply watching other children at play.
 
Most of these games are extremely tightly structured.  To
 
take the game of jacks as an example, each player in turn must
 
maneuvre through a lengthy sequence of orderly and highly restricted
 
movements, any variation in which requires the player to give up his
 
turn to the next player.  In actual play, however, in spite of th
 
large number of stringent requirements on which agreement is general:
 
(a player may not move any jack except the one in play; all jacks
 
must be picked up first one at a time, then two at a time and so
 
forth; a player who doesn't catch the ball after one bounce has
 
"missed" and so forth) there are a large number of variables which are
 
free-floating and considered open to discussion.
 
The order in which the various moves (or sub-games) are made
 
is a case in point; most children start with "babies" (or "plainsies")

in which each jack is simply picked up without additional flourishes,
 
but after the first round, any or all of the following moves may
 
be required:
 
Pigs in the
 pen
 
Eggs in the basket
 
Ups

Babies in the -high chair
 
Babies in the low chair
 
Around the worlds
 
Rolling down Broadway
 
Shooting stars
 
Up quicks
 
Down quicks
 
No bouncies
 
etc.
 
The order in which these various sub-games are played has varied with
 
every game reported to me; it is apparently negotiable each time a
 
round of jacks is proposed.
 
And when the sequence has been agreed upon, there are still
 
a number of points of play that are open to a number of kinds of
 
settlement.  What is to be done about "kissies" (two jacks that land
 
touching each other) or "haystacks" (one jack on top of another)?
 
Sometimes such jacks may be rethrown; sometimes they are considered
 
"misses", and the thrower loses his turn.  Can you play "cart before
 
the horse" (in which a player working on his "foursies" is allowed
 
to pick up the ten jacks in the order of two, four and four, rather
 
than four, four and two)?  In between games, do you have to "graduate"
 
by throwing the jacks in the air and catching as many as possible
 
on the back of the hand, or does play simply continue?
 
The significant poi n
g here is that agreement on all these
 
Hawes
 7
 
latter questions is only temporary; all rules reached are considered
 
to be in effect only for the duration of the particular play session
 
about to begin.  Although children who often play together may
 
evolve a mutually acceptable routine, should one or the other grow
 
bored with the arrangement, it is these points that would be open
 
to re-negotiation, not the "regular" rules.  Essentially, then,
 
the traditional rules for playing jacks are constructed to include
 
a variation factor, which is actually a part of the rules themselves
 
and which, through millions of rounds of play, has successfully
 
resisted all the powerful forces of stabilization.
 
Observation of other traditional games indicates that
 
many of them contain a similar ratiotof stability and variation
 
factors •
 Even more significantly, it appears that in games where
 
the rules have been officially stabilized by adult invention or
 
decree, children have countered by inventing their own areas of
  
variation.
 
In many public schools in the Los Angeles area, the tra-
ditional games such as jacks, jump rope, marbles and the like
 
have either been forbidden outright or strongly discouraged.  Offi-
cial explanations of this state of affairs vary, but the general
 
impression emerges that the traditional games lead to "fighting",
 
they are disorderly and hard to police.  The children instead are
 
encouraged (and in some cases required) to play officially approved
 
games: most prominently, tether ball, handball and four square.
 
(Of the traditional games of individual skill, hopscotch appears
 
Hawes  8
 
to be the principal one to have passed the adult stability test;
 
an unvariable diagram is occasionally observable painted on the
 
playground blacktop.)
 
In the case of handball, tether ball and foursquare,
 
officially approved descriptions of the games are available in
 
various manuals for physical education teachers.  Most printed
 
rules for handball, for instance, indicate that play stops if
 
a
.  The_ball is hit after it bounces twice
 
b
.  The ball is hit on the fly
 
c
.  The ball does not rebound past the six
 
foot line on the serve
 
d.  The ball rebounds outside the court boundaries
 
e
.  A good serve is not made in two attempts
 
f
.  A player interferes with the play of another
 
and so forth.  The actual play of children observed in several
 
southern California elementary school playgrounds, however, indi-
cates that they tacitly ignore points c and e and -
-
 normally
 
before play begins -
-
 "tap" that the following be out or fair:
 
"
Fifty-fifties" or "
Pop-ups"  (Ball hits where
 
wall and ground meet.)
 
"Waterfalls"  (The ball slides up the face of
 
the board.)
 
"Dead Killers"  (The ball rolls back, preventing
 
further play.)
 
"Babies"  (A low, soft hit.)
 
"Heebie-jeebies"  (
Interference.)  Note rule
 
f
. above.
 
and so forth, through a list of perhaps twenty permutations.  Fur-
ther, play can be "locked out" by allowing no more players; a
 
"tea party" can be held, allowing only two players to participate;
 
1
.
 
Hawes

or the call can go up for "
pink elephants", in which some players
 
line up against the board and try to avoid being hit by the
 
others.  None of the above variations appear in the rule books,
 
and very few teachers appear even to be aware that the children
 
are playing by their own rules.
 
Thus, in the life-style of the American playground,
 
there appears to be a kind of fundamental need for a bifurcated
 
game structure, one axis consisting of the unchangable rules and
 
the other those aspects of the game which are subject to variation.
 
This then suggests - -
 to return briefly to our original problem - -
that the games "Step on a crack, break your mother's back" and
 
"Mor
ikeyf
 aces" are indeed two aspects of the same thing.  After all,
 
"
Step on a crack" has an extremely simple structure; it has only
 
one rule, so to speak, 80 that a built-in variation factor is
 
impossible; hence, the necessity of inventing a reversal, or parody.
 
The existence of the "two" games then allows the players the same
 
leeway for attaining temporary agreement that the variation
 
factor permits in other traditional games.
 
For it is critical to remember that the agreement is
 
only temporary; it must be affirmed and re-affirmed each time play
 
begins, via a pre-play discussion period which may be both prolonged
 
and vociferous.  Indeed even after play is under way, its course
 
may be aLtered by the shout of one player;  "I tap..." or "Dibs
 
on...".  The interjection of these magical formulae requires
 
immediate readjustment to the new
 "rule 1

the players; lacking this, the entire group shatters into
 
passionate splinter units, the better to debate the issue.
 
Not infrequently it can be observed that a group will use the
 
entire time available for play in a bitter - -
 but apparently
 
refreshing -
-
 discussion over the "rules";  no one seems to
 
mind, really, that the game never gets played.  No wonder the
 
decibel rate of our school yards is so high; floating over our
 
playgrounds are the shrill, intense voices of a
 usand decision-
makers at work, testing, probing, re-arranging, counter-posing -
-
all 
 very exhausting and unnecessary to a tidier-minded adult
 
world.
 
For variation can certainly result in disorder; there
 
is absolutely no doubt about that.  However, it can also promote
 
flexibility and the knack of achieving compromise.  Our children
 
appear to have taken their cultural stance; they will cheer-
fully risk chaos any day in order to preserve a satisfactory
 
degree of group or individual autonomy.  It is, after all,
 
possible that they are right, that in terms of the democratic
 
life style it is more important for them to practice reaching
 
and working within a temporary consensus than to learn obedience
 
to an unchanging set of requirements.  By the time our children
 
have reached the game-playing age, they have apparently already
 
learned that there are some immutables, some rules that cannot
 
be challenged.  It is the area in which change is possible that
 
is of most interest to them - -
 and quite properly so.
 
The temptation to elaborate at this poin  is almost
 
irresistable; a number of juicy observations concerning the

ays; Like "ham and eggs" one even wonders whether to use a singu
