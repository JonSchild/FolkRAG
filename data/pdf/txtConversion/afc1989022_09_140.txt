Log by Bea Roeder

March 14, 1990, Zoelsmann's Bakery 
-01 Women studying photograph of Bessie Ingo's (Saint 
Joseph's Day] Table. 
Photo is on bread-rolling machine. 
Ann Maserotti (white vest/apron), Bessie Ingo, and Josephine 
Martellaro in front. 
-02 Rose Roderick, Rose Dazzio, Jennie Rodasta and Annabelle 
Di Iorio in foreground. 
Check identities with Bessie or 
Josephine. 
-03-4 Baker Chuck Martinelli deftly weighs out 3 lbs. chunks 
of dough, at women's request; Josephine Martellaro, Rose 
Dazzio, and Rose Roderick (?) smooth them into loaves. 
-05-7 Bessie making bow for one Saint Joseph Day bread. 
After dough has been shaped into wreath, "fingers" cut into 
one end to overlap against other, and dough placed in pan. 
-08 Bessie using comb to start diamond design on next loaf. 
-09 After diamond design is pricked into bread, Bessie cuts 
bread at about one inch intervals, about 1/4-1/2 inch deep. 
Note yardstick; women have rolled each loaf out to desired 
length so it just fits pan. 
-10 Rose Dazzio pricking dough with comb. 
-11 Rose cutting dough with knife. 
Toothpicks will be used 
to hold "fingers" (where the ends of dough are joined) and 
bow in place. Josephine and Ann in background.

Open house at the Martellaro's home, March 18, 1990: 
-13-15 Josephine Martellaro holding plate of krumkaka to be 
placed on Saint Joseph's table. 
We later joked that this 
was the longest she had stood still all day. 
She also 
painted the picture of Saint Joseph that adorns the table, 
and most of the paintings on her walls. 
-16 Saint Joseph's cake (bakery made) 
-17-18 Daughter Debbie Carleo placing finoccio (sweet anise) 
[fennel] on table. 
Notice large bowl for donations. 
-19 Josephine welcomes a visitor. 
-20 Tony holds Brittany Carleo, who is not feeling well. 
Daughter Lisa Bottini and Father Bouchard are seated on 
sofa. Picture hidden behind [Brittany] is, I believe, one 
Josephine painted of the Last Supper.
