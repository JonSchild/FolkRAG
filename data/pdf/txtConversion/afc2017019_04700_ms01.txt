MANUEL, DUSTIN 
Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
October 14,2017 
 
SIMS [0:00:03]: Yeah, so I think it was mostly up at, is that 
Peason Ridge, north,  
MANUEL [0:00:11]: And that’s where they do their live fire 
training 
SIMS [0:00:14]: They had, some vil-, I mean like a POW kinda 
camp that people could practice escaping from and like some huts 
but nothing like anywhere near as big as what they have now. But 
it’s the same general idea, but not really like villagers, that 
sort of started in the mid-1990s. Alright these are just kind of 
back ups. 
MANUEL: Gotcha. 
SIMS [0:00:55]: Do you have friends coming to town, is that? 
MANUEL [0:00:58]: I have family, my sister’s coming down from 
[Baton Rouge] and my cousin’s coming, also from the same area. 
SIMS [0:01:04]: Okay, where do you live in, where, Singer? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:01:07]: Yeah, I live in Singer, Louisiana. It’s in 
between Dequincy and here so, it’s pretty much off the map. 
SIMS [0:01:15]: Yeah, I tried to find it, I think I did but- 
MANUEL [0:01:19]: It’s one of those, it’s one of those towns 
that you drive through, blink, and it’s gone. 
SIMS [0:01:23]: Mhm. I like this Rosepine, there’s that sign 
that’s like, “Warning, speed trap”. 
MANUEL [0:01:28]: Yeah, no, I’ve always, I’ve always looked for 
it but I mean, I guess it’s like that old, it’s just not there 
anymore. 
SIMS [0:01:34]: Right, I appreciate that guy putting the sign 
up. 
MANUEL: (laughs) 
SIMS [0:01:39]: Let’s start if you could say and spell your 
name. 
MANUEL [0:01:43]: Dustin Manuel, d-u-s-t-i-n Manuel m-a-n-u-e-l 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:01:51]: Dustin tell me where you’re from, where did you 
grow up? 
MANUEL [0:01:54]: I was born in Lake Charles but I pretty much 
grew up in the Denim Springs, Baton Rouge area. Moved here 
recently ‘bout a year and a half, two years ago. And, pretty 
much that’s me. (laughs) That’s it. 
SIMS [0:02:10]: Do you have any family history in the military2 
MANUEL [0:02:12]: My mom was in the Navy and my grandfather 
served in the Vietnam War as a Marine and as far as that, as far 
as I know, that’s the only two military family members I have. 
SIMS [0:02:24]: And when you were in high school, did a lot of 
people join the military? Was it something that was fairly 
common, in your circle of friends? 
MANUEL [0:02:31]: I mean, we did have, we did have a bunch of 
recruiters that come. I was one of those people that didn’t have 
any friends so I didn’t really see too many of them join but I 
myself tried to join and was denied due to my blindness in the 
left eye. And so I felt like role play was the next best thing 
to serve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:02:50]: So what was it when you were told you were 
unable to join, how did you take that? 
MANUEL [0:02:56]: I cried. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:02:57]: Uh huh. And what were you, looking to join the 
Army or?  
MANUEL [0:03:01]: I was looking to join the National Guard. 
SIMS [0:03:03]: Uh huh, so what did you do right after? How old 
are you, how old are you now? 
MANUEL [0:03:08]: I’m 20 now 
SIMS [0:03:10]: Okay so right after high school, where did you, 
did you leave your hometown? 
MANUEL [0:03:15]: Uh, what, Denim?  
SIMS: Mhm. 
MANUEL: After high school, I went and moved in with a, with a 
girl I was with at the time. But that fell apart and so I moved 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out here with my grandparents and that’s where I li-, I’m 
staying right now.  
SIMS [0:03:28]: Okay. And is that how, is that when you found 
out about the role play?  
MANUEL [0:03:32]: Yes. Surprisingly enough, I actually, 
everybody asked me ‘Hey, how’d you find that job’ and I’m just 
like, ‘Actually I went to the unemployment office and saw that 
they were hiring’. They needed 100 people so I figured that 
would be my best shot at getting a job. Little did I know what I 
was getting myself into.  
SIMS [0:03:48]: Mhm. So, was it just like posted on the wall 
there, what did it say? 
MANUEL [0:03:51]: It ju-, it was, it was a list of jobs that 
were currently hiring and there was the one that stand out and 
it said, all it said was ‘Role play’ and that it needed 100 
people and I’m just like ‘that, that’s, that seems something 
right up my alley’. 
SIMS [0:04:05]: Right, so you had never heard of it beforehand? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:04:08]: No, I never heard of Fort Polk before. I mean 
I knew of Fort Polk but I never knew of the JRTC program at all 
before that point and then, cause then I started looking into it 
and seeing what it was. 
SIMS [0:04:21]: And did you, before you did the interview, what 
did you find out about what it was? 
MANUEL [0:04:26]: I just knew that it was a training for the 
soldiers and then, instantly right, as soon as I read that, that 
was just like, that’s awesome.  
SIMS [0:04:34]: Right, so it seemed perfect for you. 
MANUEL: Yeah. 
SIMS: Cool, what was the interview process like? 
MANUEL [0:04:42]: The interview process, it was pretty much like 
anything else, well, I can’t really say that, I mean of course 
you have the normal, you go in, talk about yourself and what 
your experience is but then, the, the orientation was you had to 
be able to wear the, the harness which is like a laser tag 
system called the MILES gear and, you had to be able to walk a 
mile with it.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:05:10]: So they actually test you during?  
MANUEL [0:05:12]: Yup. They, we had to walk a mile during the 
orientation. Didn’t know about that beforehand. 
SIMS [0:05:18]: But you passed? So it was-? 
MANUEL [0:01:43]: Yeah, I was, I was one of the first three to 
finish so. 
SIMS [0:05:25]: Did anyone sort of drop out once they got a 
fuller sense of what the work was? 
MANUEL [0:05:32]: Oh, like, out of my orientation, I think there 
was 70 to a 100 people. And out of that, over half of them 
within the, within the year that I was there had fell-, fallen 
out, was fired, or just downright quit. Because they couldn’t do 
it.  
SIMS [0:05:52]: So tell me some of the reasons why like, first 
the, people who quit, like what, what was hard about it for 
them? 
MANUEL [0:06:00]: It’s older people, cause like out of that, out 
of that amount, mo-, like over 75 percent of them was in like 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 60, 70 age range, like seeing young people like myself is a 
dime a dozen over there, like we’re heavily outnumbered by the 
elderly.  
SIMS [0:06:20]: 509th elderly- 
MANUEL [0:06:21]: Oh no, no, that’s, that’s differently. 
SIMS [0:06:24]: But, so, basically it was too hot or too 
physically strenuous for them? 
MANUEL [0:06:30]: I mean, most, like they give, they give like 
the, us younger people like the, the police roles, the more 
active roles. They’ll give the older people that can handle it, 
they’ll put them on surge, which is the people that go out and 
do the IDP which is, something displaced personnel. 
SIMS [0:06:50]: Think it’s internally displac- 
MANUEL [0:06:52]: Yeah that’s it 
SIMS [0:06:53]: Kind of like refugees 
MANUEL: Yes  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL [0:06:56]: Mhm. And they’ll do that because there some of 
them ladies out there that they go wild out there and they are 
absolutely amazing at their job. Some of them can force 
themselves to cry. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:07:11]: The people who got fired, like what sort of 
things- 
MANUEL [0:07:15]: It’s mostly, it was mostly attendance, like- 
SIMS [0:07:19]: Oh, excuse me for a second  
[Slight interruption due to one of the recording devices running 
out of power] 
SIMS [0:07:58]: Alright, you were telling, people who get- 
MANUEL: Got fired. 
SIMS [0:08:03]: Yeah because they, because of attendance issues? 
MANUEL [0:08:06]: Yeah it’s, it was mostly attendance cause 
like, we only work two weeks out of the month and, pretty much 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you, if you’re, if you miss more than three days, you’re 
pretty much missing ‘bout a quarter of the whole rotation and 
you being gone for that amount of time, it kinda throws the 
training off a little bit cause if you have a major role out 
there and then the soldiers are in town and they see that you’re 
gone, they’re gonna be like ‘Well where’d they go?’ and then you 
have to, you have to make a story of, of why they’re gone.  
SIMS [0:08:37]: Right. So, I mean, so even if you’re sick, it 
doesn’t- 
MANUEL [0:08:42]: Oh no, if, if you’re sick that’s one thing, 
but like we had, we had people out there that just, they got 
tired of the heat cause it was too hot and they’re just like ‘I 
don’t wanna go to work today’. 
SIMS [0:08:53]: So, what was your first impression, like the 
first time you, after orientation, first time you’re in the box, 
like, what are you, thinking, like- 
MANUEL [0:09:04]: The, okay, my first rotation was actually a, 
it was a natural disaster one, and it wasn’t the actual, the one 
that you’re interested in which is the, the whole other country 
deal.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right  
MANUEL: We, the one that- 
SIMS [0:09:18]: Yeah, tell me about the-  
MANUEL [0:09:19]: The, the one we called, was called the Desurf 
rotation and pretty much, it was like a, nuclear facility blew 
up and, had a bunch of rubble, the soldiers, the national guard 
had to come out and rescue us. We’re stuck in buildings, all 
moulaged up. Some of us had, screw, screws lodged in our 
abdomens, me, I had a, somehow got a bullet wound in the, in 
the, in the chest, had a collapsed lung and, they pretty much 
had to, they had to quarantine the area, they had to, had to 
decontaminate us, cut off clothes that we were given. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:09:58]: So, is this set up at one of the villages? 
MANUEL [0:10:01]: Mhm, it was, it was set up in Dara Lam which 
is the, the main one and there was a, a, st-, I think they 
called it a stick lane, I don’t know why they call it that, it 
was just like an intense care in Tirani. Which is like, the one 
that’s like right down the road from Dara Lam. But my, my actual 
first rotation which is, which was the, I think I was stuck as a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
police officer. And, I didn’t, at the time, I didn’t know what 
was gonna happen and I didn’t know what to expect and so, I was 
put in Dara Lam if I remember correctly. And the first rotation 
I had, the, it was a couple days in, some of the bad guys 
actually tried to come in and I didn’t know what to do. I froze 
up. (laughs) I was in a-, I heard gun fire, and I was just like 
‘Wha-, what’s going on, what’s going on’? And they’re like 
‘Yeah, they’re trying to get in, we gotta go, gotta go’. I was 
like ‘No’! (laughs) And, and after that, I mean, it kinda got 
better as, as I, as I, as I kept doing the rotations and 
everything but my first was, yeah I froze up.  
SIMS [0:11:18]: Mhm, so, but you’re done as a police officer, 
does it interact with the MILES of- 
MANUEL [0:11:22]: Yes, it has, it’s, pretty much you get, you’re 
given an AK-47. It’s an electric airsoft rifle, they take the 
firing pin out, so that way you can’t shoot BB’s at people. And, 
and pretty much it has a little box that’s like that big, and, 
it shoots the little laser. So you can’t actually, as a police 
officer, kill the bad guy.  
SIMS [0:11:46]: Right, so did you ever engage in, combat with 
the bad guys? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:11:51]: Yes, prominently I have the most fond memory 
of engaging with the bad guys is the bad guys one time tried to 
rob the bank that was in Dara Lam. So, what happened with that 
is that, at the time, I had a side-, I had a sidearm and my, and 
my AK. And so, they had, they were talking about like a bunch of 
people going to the bank and not coming out. And so, we’re just 
like ‘Okay, we’ll go investigate’. And so, after we wa-, it was 
me, and two other officers. And so we walk up to the bank, and 
we had a police AK pointed at us, as soon as we walked to the 
door. And they said ‘Hand over the rifles’. Of course, we had to 
and they didn’t see the side arm I had on my, my ___ and they 
said ‘Go, go, go towards the counter and just stay put’. And so 
I lean up against the counter, I was sitting there talking to 
one of my other officers, he was a higher rank than me and I was 
just like ‘They didn’t take my sidearm’. And he’s like ‘Just 
wait for an opportunity, when you see it, take it immediately’. 
And so, of course, at the, at this time like, I tell thi-, I 
told people this all the time, you get stuck in these kind of 
situations, you’re not thinking ‘Hey, this is fake’. This, it, 
it literally kicks in your self-preservation, you’re just like, 
and you get, you get physically scared of a life and death 
situation. And, and so, my heart was beating and I was just 
like, I was waiting for him to, to, to look away or something. 
And I was-, I kept glancing around and eventually, they finally, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the gir-, the guy finally put down his, the AK. I undid it, 
popped the first guy, turned around, popped the second guy and 
then everybody just started cheering. It was just like (inhales) 
‘I did it guys’! (laughs) And the funny thing is, is that the 
media was there, and, because whenever the media came in, they, 
they took him too because they didn’t want him to go. And he was 
sitting there filming the whole time. And so he got the whole 
thing on camera! (laughs) 
SIMS [0:13:58]: So there’s no like, rotational unit soldiers 
like anywhere around at this point? 
MANUEL [0:14:02]: No, the-, I don’t think they, I don’t think 
they were in Dara Lam at the time. I think they were on their, 
on their way but they weren’t in, in there.  
SIMS [0:14:14]: Well yeah, it’s sort of cool that like, the 
storyline continues even outside of the, like rotational unit 
experience right?  
MANUEL: Mhm. 
SIMS: So what did the 509th guys do after you shot them? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:14:26]: Well, I was told there was a hit put out on 
me. I mean, I never did get killed, that rotation.  
SIMS [0:14:35]: But do those guys like, talk to you, or, like, 
like, I mean are like- 
MANUEL [0:14:41]: You’re supposed to stay in character so 
obviously you’re supposed to be hostile towards them but- 
SIM: Right. 
MANUEL: Unfriendly and, but, most of the time, we’re pretty 
cordial but, we know that at the end of the day it’s, it’s all 
roleplay.  
SIMS [0:15:00]: Were you given any, specific training to become 
a police officer as opposed to- 
MANUEL: No. (laughs) 
SIMS: A villager?  
MANUEL [0:15:10]: They, they pretty much saw he’s young, just 
kinda tell him the guidelines 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: And just throw him out there.  
SIMS [0:15:16]: But did you, get a name or like an ethnic 
identity? 
MANUEL [0:15:22]: Yeah, I was, I was giv-, you’re given these 
things called character sheets. And, the, it gives you your 
name, which you have, you have the badges and, you’re given the 
ID, and the police badge. And my name at the time was, Rameez 
Amaran. And, I was an, an ethic Atropian who dis-, heavily 
disliked the, the ethnic Persians, and as a police officer, they 
stopped this after a couple rotations but, normally, the, 
Atropians despised the Persians because, mostly the Persians 
were the ones that were with the, the bad guys, the SAPA. And, 
we had, we feared that they were spies and so anytime we’d have 
like IDP events, or, or anything like that, we abused the 
Persians (laughs) to see like, an-, like with the sol-, we 
wouldn’t do this, this, we, in front of the soldiers just to see 
how they’d react. And, and so like, we’d have like the fake 
blood and everything and like, my favorite, my, the favorite 
part was, there was these two guys out there. There’s a guy 
named Ian, he no longer works there, but there was a guy named 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Houdi who was a-, they were both police officers. Well, no, Ian 
was one of the Persian villagers, that was a, a displaced 
person. And Houdi was our chief. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
MANUEL: And so, whenever we were getting th-, unloading the, the 
people off the bus and everything, they got, they, they got the 
moulage out. And they, the consulate was right across the 
street. And Houdi brought up his fist and said ‘You dirty little 
Persian’, he got the blood out and just smacked it across his 
face. The soldiers just sitting there, watching, because they’re 
not supposed to get involved in ethnic strife. So, but, I mean 
they did the right thing but it’s like, ‘Really, you’re not 
gonna come here and help this guy’? And of course, all the women 
are screaming and hollering, and making a big fuss out of it. 
SIMS: This is in Dara Lam? 
MANUEL: Yeah, this is in Darilam. But, it, there’s a lot that 
goes on out there. 
SIMS [0:17:42]: So, did you engage in like anti-Persian 
violence, like as a police officer? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL: Yeah, yeah! 
SIMS: So what did it feel like in the, like actual moment of 
like pretending to hit someone, like how- 
MANUEL [0:17:57]: I mean, I didn’t do the whole moulage punch 
thing. I was using my gun to push ‘em back. Cause they were, 
they were trying to get to Ian cause he was getting hit and they 
were gonna try to tackle Houdi. And so me, as a police officer, 
‘You get back, you little dirty’ (hit noise). And so, I’m pretty 
much, butting them with my gun and telling them just to get 
back. And at the moment, I mean, it-, it’s adr-, it’s adrenaline 
is what it is cause like, like I said, the realism kicks in and 
you’re just like, you’re-, you’re thinking of what you, what you 
nee-, what you were told to do. And I mean, of course, you’re 
always scared of ‘Oh, I’m gonna hit somebody too hard’ cause 
you’re thinking, eventually you’re just like, you start to 
[reel] down and you’re just like ‘Oh yeah, these are role 
players, don’t push them too hard’! (laughs) Cause you don’t 
want to actually, actually knock down of these old ladies and 
they break a hip or something.  
SIMS: Right. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL: So. 
SIMS [0:18:51]: I mean, does it, how does it, like even though 
you’re acting, it’s like there’s adrenaline and some aggression, 
like, does it actually affect your, like relationship with these 
folks, like- 
MANUEL [0:19:07]: No. Like in the real world, y’all know that at 
the end of the day it’s role play and we’re just, we’re, acting 
it out! And some of us, we’ll actually plan things together-  
SIMS: Mhm.  
MANUEL: And that way we can better coordinate, and, a scene 
which was- 
SIMS [0:19:23]: Yeah, tell me, like, how that would go  
MANUEL [0:19:26]: Like, pretty much what I explained, the [Ian], 
[Ian] and [Houdi], they, like every rotation that, that’s pretty 
much what happens, they have that planned out beforehand. Cause, 
out of the view of Americans, they say ‘This is what we’re gonna 
do’.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL: And so, whenever the time comes, it plays out and it 
plays out perfectly, cause it was all planned beforehand. 
SIMS: It’s like choreographed. 
MANUEL: Mhm. 
SIMS [0:19:49]: To make it more, more of a spectacle. How does 
it, I’m, I’m guessing you didn’t necessarily have any like 
acting experience beforehand?  
MANUEL: I mean- 
SIMS: Maybe you did. How, how does it, how much, how hard is it 
to sort of like do the acting part of it? 
MANUEL [0:20:11]: Pretty much, if you have, if you have the, the 
drive to, and you’re really energetic, and you just, you love to 
make a scene, it’s pretty much the thing for you. But, I did, I 
like did two college films and, did a little bit of modeling 
but, other than that, I, I didn’t have, I had very minimal 
experience with acting. I was just one of those people, I was 
just a character. I loved it, be the center of attention. 
(laughs) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:20:40]: Right. So, what, did you have any roles besides 
police officer? 
MANUEL [0:20:45]: This is the one that I was telling you, you’d 
probably be interested in. But I can’t, go into too much detail, 
because of the nature of it. I was a, I was a sour-, a, a hired 
source for the Americans. I wasn’t hired, but I was a villager 
that, in the backstory, SAPA was forcing me to give them money 
and, and, in return, that they wouldn’t hurt my family. And so, 
wh-, out of fear for this, eventually the, the Americans, I was 
an electronic shop owner and of course, that looks really 
suspicious, because electronic parts equals bombs. And so, they 
come in, and just like, just like ‘What do you do’? And of 
course, I break down the story and everything, and, this-, this 
sergeant, did not believe my story, (laughs) and so he gets all 
in my face and everything and I break down crying, I’m on the 
shop floor and everything, I’m just like, ‘I’m just trying to, 
I’m trying not to, I’m trying to save my family’. And, you 
pretty much become an informant for the Americans. And of 
course, that comes with repercussions if you get caught by the 
bad guys and like I said, I really can’t go too deep into that 
so. 7 mins and 50 secs off 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:22:13]: Did it feel different sort of having, like a, 
like a, I guess some more nuanced role, or like a different, 
like a, I guess a more complex role? Like that rotation? 
MANUEL [0:22:24]: I mean, it, it, it’s always something like, 
with a role like that, you have to keep like a watchful eye over 
everything cause you, you’re trying to get information. But the 
downside of that is, if you make it too obvious you’re looking 
for information, you get killed. (laughs) And I made the mistake 
of one rotation, doing just that. I was just like, well, I’m 
just gonna sit and, sit, cause like the, the bad guys, they were 
using our town as their, their base. And it was a cold month, 
and so they had a fire going in the middle, and all the bad boys 
were sitting in the, the middle. So me, I just go over and walk 
over there and just started sitting and chatting with them. I 
did this for about three, four days. And eventually they caught 
on, and I was told to get out of town or I’d get killed. 
(laughs)  
SIMS [0:23:18]: So what do you do, like in that situation. I 
mean, are you, you actually leave the village? 
MANUEL: Yeah! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Where do you go then? 
MANUEL [0:23:26]: That was, I had to, I had to leave, and I fled 
to Dara Lam and- 
SIMS [0:23:31]: And how are you, do you have a vehicle or? 
MANUEL [0:23:33]: Yeah, like they give us, they give us vehicles 
also with the, the, the MILES system which can be destroyed. But 
the, the funny, the funny part about this certain rotation, of 
them kicking me out is I had to go through Tirani which, had an 
American checkpoint and whenever I was going through, of course, 
I was going pretty fast, and so I was just like, I’m not 
stopping at this checkpoint. And so I tried to go through, cause 
I’m, I’m fleeing for my life, and so, they, they, the-, 
eventually the soldiers started getting in their role and I had 
to stop. And they’re like, they, they aim their guns at me, 
telling me to get out the vehicle and everything. And at this 
time, they start taking mortar fire. And for some reason, in, in 
their heads, they’re just like, they prioritize me over these 
mortars that’s flying. And so, I’m knocked on the ground, I’m 
saying, ‘I gotta go, I gotta go, I’m being chased’ and 
everything. They don’t ask me why, or where I’m going, but I’m 
sitting there and I felt, I feel a gun butt into the back of my 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
legs, put me on the ground, and then my face is slammed into the 
dirt. (laughs) And, - 
SIMS: There’s mortars exploding everywhere. 
MANUEL: And there’s, there’s this mortars going off and - 
SIMS [0:24:51]: Like, with actual fire marker stuff? 
MANUEL: Yes. 
SIMS: Yeah, like real  
MANUEL [0:24:55]: And, and eventually they, they take me away 
from the truck and they, they brought, bring inside some 
buildings over here to the lieutenant and everything and, I was 
held, hostage. Well, not hostage, but I was detained. I can’t 
tell you anything that happened after that, cause that’s all.  
SIMS [0:25:15]: So, I guess because you’re military age and fit, 
like, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for the rotational unit to 
think you’re in the 5-0 - 
MANUEL [0:25:25]: They do it all the time. They, they, they, 
they really do stereotype. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Mhm.  
MANUEL: Like I get, like I was a fisherman one rotation and I 
was driving out to Tirani and it just so happened that as soon 
as I leave the, leave the town of Tirani, gunshots start firing 
towards the soldiers I didn’t see in the woods. And I was, 
again, yanked out of my truck, and I was hiding behind the do-, 
one of the doors of the truck that I left open and the guys 
telling me, “Get around this side, get around this side”. And I 
said, “No! I’m not leaving this spot, there’s gunfire going on”. 
And so he says, “If you don’t get your ass over here, I’m gonna 
shoot you in the foot”. (laughs) And so I said, “No, I ain’t 
leaving”. So he reaches around the door, grabs me and slams me 
over into the ground in front of the truck and they bring me 
into the woods. And the command sergeant that was over there, he 
was just like, he said, he started talking to me and 
interrogated me a little bit and I was just like, “I’m just a 
fisherman”. I pointed to the back of my truck which had an ice 
cooler and two fishing poles in the back. And he’s just like, 
“You guys brought me a fisherman?! I thought you got me the gun 
truck guy! Get this guy outta here”. And so they es-, they laid 
down some cover fire, allowed me to get in the, get in the truck 
and I hauled ass. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:26:41]: Was there actual, like fish and fake fish- 
MANUEL [0:26:44]: Yeah, I’d, I’d gone around to the markets and 
found some fake fish, got some ice bags from base and shoved 
them in there, just for some extra laughs. 
SIMS [0:26:55]: So like in that case, you’re basically by 
yourself- 
MANUEL: Yeah. 
SIMS: Like, not necessarily with a partner. So how much, how 
much of this are you just like deciding on your own, like where 
to go and when, and like how much is scripted? Like how does 
that, how much, I don’t know, you know like, authority do you 
have? 
MANUEL [0:27:18]: As, as like the, as like the source role, you 
have pretty much free reign of the box. You just have to inform 
your, your handler who is like, we call them work group leaders, 
of where you’re going and how long you plan to stay there. And, 
and so every time I make a move, I have to call and say, “Hey, 
I’m going this way” and this isn’t part of the scenario at all, 
this is jus- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: It’s just work place check-in. 
MANUEL [0:27:43]: Yeah, it’s just accountability but other than 
that, I had free reign of the box. But as like police officers 
and stuff, you can’t leave that, your town, unless directed by 
the police chief cause it’s in role. And the police chief is 
normally your work group leader and they take care of your 
accountability and everything. 
SIMS [0:28:05]: So do-, I mean it seems, if this were any other 
job, it would be tempting to like say “I’m gonna run this work 
area” and like take a nap or something, you know. Does just, 
stuff like that happen or is it pretty like tight where you, you 
know, people know pretty much where you are, if you disappear? 
MANUEL [0:28:24]: I mean, there, there, of course, you can’t 
keep track of everybody, at every given point in time. So it’s 
not like we have GPS trackers on us and everything but pretty 
much, it’s pretty relaxed. It just depends on who you get as, as 
your work group leader.  
SIMS [0:28:43]: So did you feel like, during the time that you 
were a role player, like you have a good sense of everything in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the box? Like you went everywhere often? Or is your knowledge 
just sort of like, only in certain areas? 
MANUEL [0:28:57]: I, I try to make my, my, myself familiar with 
pretty much every aspect in every town in the box. But like, for 
the most part, up until a couple month ago, I never visited the 
SAPA Stronghold which is Sangari because as a source, that’s a 
no no.   
SIMS: Right 
MANUEL: But, but after that, I pretty much knew where everything 
was in the box. 
SIMS [0:29:24]: Did you have, like favorite places? If so, what 
were they? 
MANUEL [0:29:29]: My favorite places was probably Dara Lam, 
Sangari, and Tufani. Dara Lam and Sangari are two of the biggest 
cities out there and Tufani, I liked it because it was a nice 
little quiet place. It had a little swing in a tree, that I 
liked to read over there, but.   
SIMS [0:29:55]: So what did you do for food? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:29:58]: Most of the villages actually, we cooked. It, 
like, cause we actually have like cafes in the towns. And so 
we’d cook, like sometimes we’d have gumbo, jambalaya, and 
everything. And of course, like, sometimes the bad guys would 
come in, buy a plate of food, be like, “Oh yeah, this is, this 
some good stuff”. We’d say, “Yeah it’s homemade, right here in 
Atropia”. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:30:21]: Should be a cookbook. 
MANUEL [0:30:24]: Atropian cooking 
SIMS [0:30:26]: Yeah, biscuits with gravy. Can you, do you, 
recall any other sort of strange or funny stories about your 
experiences or what you heard? 
MANUEL [0:30:43]: My, the last rotation that I did out there 
before I moved on to being a security guard out here in the mega 
project over here in Sasol, was, I was a police officer in 
Tirani during the night. And so, the SAPA, SAPA guys made their 
way in and they stationed themselves in the town. (indistinct 
yelling in background) And they- 
SIMS: Are they playing football? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:31:12]: Baseball, football, I don’t know what’s going 
on. But, it was like, I think it was like four, five days in 
that eventually they saw that I was, cause I was the highest 
ranking at the time, at, during the nighttime, cause the chief 
wasn’t there, he was there during the days. And, the SAPA 
commander, well one of them for that area, walks up to me and he 
gra-, he grabs me by the shirt and he says, “Where’s your 
vehicle at?” and I was like, “It’s right over there”. And he 
says, “Get in, I’m getting in there with you. I’m, I’m taking 
your vehicle and you’re gonna lead my gu-, my gun truck convoy 
through American checkpoints”. And all this while, I had three 
armed SAPA guys pointing their guns at me, and so, I had no 
choice. And so I had to go, I said, and at this time when stuff 
like that happens, when you’re taken hostage, you have to say, 
“Gimme a second”, unless this is, like you’re talking to 
Americans, but the, the bad boys know, so I had to go to the 
work group leader saying, “Hey, I’m getting captured. I’m going 
here” and- 
SIMS [0:32:23]: You just sort of say, say like “Time out, I 
gotta  
MANUEL [0:32:25]: I was like, “Real world, gotta go let my work 
group leader know I’m getting captured”, and then it goes on, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
continues the story from there. So, it takes a little, it takes 
about 10 or 15 minutes or so, for them to get loaded up and 
everything. They tell me to leave my headlights on and the whole 
convoy behind me has them off, they’re all driving blackout with 
night vision goggles and everything, the whole shebang. And, 
we’re sitting there, driving on the way to Patur and we hit two 
checkpoints. The first one, I don’t know if them guys were 
asleep or anything because we only had one of the American gun 
trucks go o-, go off, we only lost one vehicle off of our convoy 
of, it was like, I think 10 or 15 gun trucks. And, like-  
SIMS [0:33:12]: So there was a fire fight? 
MANUEL [0:33:13]: There was a fire fight that I had to drive 
through and the SAPA commander that was in my vehicle, which 
they called “the bait car”, he had grabbed my AK because, he has 
limited ammo, however my runs off battery power. And so he takes 
that, and he, he jumps out of the window and just starts 
lighting up the American soldiers on the road and we’re just 
tearing through the checkpoint. Of course, as soon as I hear 
gunfire, the realism kicks in, (snaps fingers) and I hit the gas 
and I’m, and I’m off. And eventually, we’ll pull up behind a, a 
small American convoy and he tells me, “Go alongside them”. And 
so, I pull over, I’m going across them, and he starts shooting 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at them through the window, and you start hearing the, the MILES 
go off. It’s a real loud thing, you can’t miss it. And then, the 
gun trucks behind us, they’re starting to catch up and they 
light them up too. And, all this while, we finally get to Patur 
and, the, the doctor comes in and assesses me and I got shot 
through the thigh and only through the thigh, through the door 
panel of the-, the door apparently, a gun truck got me with a 
50, and grazed me, so.  
SIMS [0:34:27]: Because you-, did your MILES gear actually go 
off? 
MANUEL [0:34:29]: Uh-uh. It near, I got a near miss and so they 
have to, that, that counts as you were injured. You weren’t 
killed. But like, if it goes off completely, cause like there’s 
two different things, a near miss and it’ll just, it’ll beep 
like twice and then it’ll just, it won’t do anything. But if 
you’re killed, it’ll just go off and it won’t stop until you hit 
a button on the, on the equipment.  
SIMS [0:34:53]: So are there like speed limits, like if you’re 
actually trying to, you know- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:34:59]: You’re supposed to go 25, but I mean, when 
you’re getting shot at, that kind of goes out the window. Like, 
cause you don’t, you’re not thinking of “Hey, I gotta, I gotta 
go 25 miles an hour”. You’re thinking “Hey, I gotta get away 
from these bullets that are flying”. 
SIMS [0:35:15]: Yeah, I mean it seems like, late at night, you 
know, on these like curvy roads, and there’s like a firefight 
going on, it would, you could see like where a real world 
accident could happen- 
MANUEL: Oh yes-  
SIMS [0:35:27]: Does it feel dangerous? 
MANUEL [0:35:28]: It does feel dangerous and normally at night 
time, the limit drops to 15 due to the, the gun trucks driving 
blackout or the American soldiers walking down the road, you 
can’t see them. And, but, like I say, when realism kicks in, 
realism kicks in and they understand that. Like, cause, at some 
point, there’s real fear in it for, for us, cause it’s, us as 
humans, self-preservation  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:35:59]: Do you remember any other strange stories or 
cool stories? 
MANUEL [0:36:05]: There was a point in time, we had an IDP event 
and we had a, an angry Persian in the mob, and the, the con-, we 
had the consulate, it was all, it was happening in front of the 
consulate. I wasn’t a part of this, I was just watching it 
happen. And they were all, it was an angry mobs and we, we can’t 
have any more Americans killing citiz-, citizens, everything 
like that. And there was a consulate going out there, trying to 
keep, trying to keep the crowd back from the consulate cause we 
had Marines in the consulate. Them guys don’t play. But, 
eventually, it came up to a point where one of the consulate 
guards got stabbed in the leg by an angry Persian, and there was 
blood and everything, it- (laughs), they do a really good job 
with the moulage. But,-  
SIMS [0:37:01]: So is this something where they say like, “time 
out” and they run and do that or- 
MANUEL: Uh-uh. 
SIMS: It’s already like there? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:37:06]: No, they, they have like a, the guy had a 
makeshift knife that he held it to where the blade wouldn’t do 
anything and he had a blood bottle and he just, as soon as he 
hit him, he just let it, let it loose. And that way, he had the 
weapon and he just kind of let the, the blood bottle drop and 
that way he, has a knife. 
SIMS [0:37:27]: So what did they, how did the Americans respond? 
MANUEL [0:37:30]: Oh, the Americans outside the consulate 
eventually got him and planted his face into the concrete 
curbside. You do get hurt out there sometimes, but-  
SIMS [0:37:42]: Is there like a safe word or something? 
MANUEL [0:37:45]: Not that I’ve ever heard of, but I mean, you 
can tell them, like if you, if you feel like you, you are in 
immediate danger, you can say “time out, this is, this is real 
world, you’re hurting me”. That way it kind of alleviates the 
safety thing cause just like us, whenever I say that realism 
kicks in, for them, realism kicks in, especially with these guys 
that have already been deployed and that PTSD kicks in. And, 
they’re thinking, “Hey, this is real”. But it, sometimes all it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
takes is, “Hey, remember, I’m American, this, this is just role 
play” to bring them back to - 
SIMS [0:38:24]: Did you feel like there were ever times when it 
went too far, like, people, you know, you felt like were 
actually getting hurt 
MANUEL [0:38:34]: I mean, I’ve heard stories, I’ve never seen it 
personally, of people getting butt stroked by the guns and 
everything, but they do tell us, as a safety precaution, to 
keeps an arm le-, arm length’s distance away from them. And if 
you break that gap, then you yourself are putting yourself at 
risk. 
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: Because that’s what they’re trained to do, they’re 
trained to keep that distance. So. 
SIMS [0:38:59]: What’s, what was the hardest part of the work, 
for you?  
MANUEL [0:39:02]: The heat. (laughs) Cause pretty much you’re in 
an open area that’s nothing but, especially in Dara Lam, it’s 
literally a concrete jungle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right.  
MANUEL: And so, as a police officer, we wear, most of the time, 
long sleeves and you can’t roll them up. Because of uniform.  
SIMS [0:39:21]: So what are, what things could you do to beat 
the heat? 
MANUEL [0:39:25]: Like, we can go in the police station which, 
sometimes, had A/C. Most of the time, it didn’t. Most of them, 
they just kinda had a café with a bunch of fans in it, sit in 
there for a little bit. It’s, I mean, there’s plenty of ways 
but, I mean, most of the time, we’re out there patrolling or 
we’re sitting on a checkpoint.  
SIMS [0:39:45]: Mhm, is it, would you say it’s sort of mostly 
boring with like moments of excitement? Or do you feel like time 
actually goes by pretty quickly? 
MANUEL [0:39:59]: It, it goes by pretty fast cause I mean, 
you’re sit-, oh excuse me, especially like as a police officer 
in Dara Lam, if you’re put on checkpoint, literally all day, 
you’re, you’re gonna have people coming in and out. We do have 
people that literally just do nothing but ride around the box to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
give it traffic. And so, you have people, sometimes you get the 
bad guys and you know it’s the bad guys but you can’t do 
anything cause there’s no probable cause. Because you know real 
world that it’s them but, and so you’re sitting there, you have 
to check through badges, look in their vehicle and of course, 
there’s the occasional crooked cop that throws a bullet shell in 
one of the vehicles and be like, “Oh what’s this?” and so 
(laughs), we detain them and question them. But, yeah, the one 
thing that, like, going out there that really excited me was 
the, the, the complete depth of what they, what they had out 
there. Like, we had, we had our own governor, assistant 
governor, police chiefs, like, heck, we had, we even had our own 
bank like I told you.  
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: And like we have a clinic, and we have like fake medical 
supplies, and some of it was actually like real pads and 
everything, medical kits and stuff like that. And like we’d have 
non-governmental organizations out there, like the WHO, the 
United Red Cross, the Geneva convention out there. And it’s 
just, there’s a lot.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:41:35]: What were some of your favorite props or like 
physical things that you came across?  
MANUEL [0:41:44]: Probably the boxes of medical supplies and 
water filters they got cause it’s literally just like they load 
up the back of the trucks with these big old boxes with a bunch 
of bricks in them. (laughs) And it just has a piece of paper 
that had a, it’s a printed-out picture of some water filters, or 
some medical supplies 
SIMS [0:42:04]: So it gets moved around village to village? 
MANUEL [0:42:06]: Mhm. And sometimes SAPA will steal them and 
then be like, “Oh yeah, look, we brought you this”. They’ll 
steal it from one town and bring it to the others saying, “Hey 
look, we’re nice” to win their favor.  
SIMS [0:42:19]: So why did, why did you move on to a different 
job? 
MANUEL [0:42:23]: It’s, it’s, it’s an amazing job, I will not 
lie. It is, it’s one of those jobs like, you can try and explain 
it to people but it’s one of those, you won’t know unless you’re 
there type deals. And, but like I said, you only work two weeks 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out of the month, it’s not full time in the least, and then some 
months you don’t work because you don’t work unless there’s a 
rotational training unit out there. And so, I needed full time 
work. I mean, on paper, I’m still out there so like if 
something, like if my other job decides they w-, they need to 
close down for a little bit, I can do a rotation over there.  
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: But, I mean, I would, I would definitely, if it was full 
time work, I would definitely be out there. 
SIMS [0:43:08]: So, even though it’s, if a rotation is two weeks 
but you work a ton of hours right, like it’s 12 hours a day, but 
it basically doesn’t equal, sort of, full time pay?  
MANUEL [0:43:22]: It, like, apparently, legally it’s not 
considered full time work 
SIMS [0:43:27]: So, there’s no benefits or? 
MANUEL [0:43:28]: Because technically, working two weeks-  
SIMS: Right. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL: That you’re not working 40 hours a week, or over 40 
hours a week, you have the two weeks off.  
SIMS [0:43:43]: Is there anything that, from that job experience 
that seems similar to your job as a security guard?  
MANUEL [0:43:53]: Besides checking badges, absolutely nothing. 
(laughs) 
SIMS [0:43:58]: Do you ever have flashbacks to being at the 
checkpoint while you’re-  
MANUEL [0:44:03]: I’m not gonna say that I have PTSD cause 
that’s a long stretch away but I will say that, like sitting out 
here at the park with my wife, like we, we both work out there 
and I would have her too, if she didn’t have some training to 
do, so that way she could tell you a bunch of stuff too. But we 
were sitting out here at the park and one of the 18-wheelers 
over here, there, they started revving up and everything and it 
sounded like machine gun fire. And I jumped up and I was just 
like, “Oh wait, I’m not in the box”. (laughs) But, there, 
there’s some stuff, like, that you’ll hear or you’ll see and 
you’re just like, “oh, that reminds me of, of Atropia”.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:44:47]: Do you keep in touch with, is that, did you meet 
your wife there? 
MANUEL [0:44:49]: Mhm. 
SIMS [0:44:51]: Really? Tell me about it- 
MANUEL [0:44:52]: That was another reason why Tufani was one of 
my favorite, towns. (laughs) 
SIMS [0:45:00]: Yeah, well that’s, that’s, I don’t know, it 
seems like the most important part of the experience, right?  
MANUEL [0:45:07]: Yeah, I mean, there was, as a role-play 
standpoint, they never really used that to, to their benefit 
but, I mean, it’s still work. But, of course, there would be 
times like we, like out there in Tufani, I’d just be sitting 
there with my arm around her, reading a book. I mean, if an 
Amer-, if some American convoy comes by, they’ll be like “Oh, 
there’s actual couples out here”. 
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: But, -  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So, you didn’t know her at all, before? 
MANUEL [0:45:34]: No, I didn’t.  
SIMS [0:45:36]: So, how did you, what sort of characters were 
you when you met? 
MANUEL [0:45:41]: I was a, I was the, the source but as a, in 
role, I was a electronic repairs, repairman. And she was the, 
the café owner slash blogger and, her computer broke, well 
“broke”.   
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: And so, that kinda started us talking and everything. 
And I started talking in role and pretty much every day after 
that I’d go to Tufani and talk to her. So, I mean, in a way we 
kinda met in role, which is kinda funny. But, - 
SIMS [0:46:19]: So, does that count as your first date? 
MANUEL [0:46:22]: I don’t know, I, I don’t know. But, - 
SIMS [0:46:28]: But you were, so how long were you all dat-, 
you’re married now so? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:46:35]: I’m not married, I just call her my wife cause 
it’s a lot easier than saying “fiancée”. But, - 
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: We’ve been dating for almost two years now. So. 
SIMS [0:46:47]: And does she still work in role play? 
MANUEL [0:46:50]: She actually works out there with me as a 
security guard.  
SIMS [0:46:53]: Oh okay, so now you’re in your second job 
together. So, did you, did you have to sort of, hide your 
relationship like in the box, or they don’t really care?  
MANUEL [0:47:06]: I mean, in a, in a role-play standard, yes. 
Because roles could conflict  
SIMS: Right. 
MANUEL: So, like a, if she was like a IDP and I was a police 
officer, that wouldn’t work.  
SIMS: Right.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL: But, but for the most part, they tried to keep us in 
separate villages because of the, I think they called it 
conflict of interest or something like that.   
SIMS [0:47:34]: Right, so you had to, at one point, report that 
you all were a couple? 
MANUEL [0:47:38]: I mean, it was pretty obvious. I didn’t have 
to report it. They kind of found out on their own. I mean, one, 
one week I’m just hanging off by myself and the other week I’m 
always hanging around her, so I mean- 
SIMS [0:47:52]: Yeah, there’s lots of time for, people to, you 
know, if everyone’s sitting around- 
MANUEL [0:47:57]: I mean, they don’t, they don’t make a willful 
effort to keep us apart except for putting us in different 
villages. Cause I mean, I can still visit and then talk to her 
for a little bit, then go back to my normal village. But - 
SIMS [0:48:08]: Yeah, I talked to some o-, retired people who 
were married and they were in different villages. Cause that 
wouldn’t seem uncommon around here right, if they have so many 
role-players, inevitably. So, the, I guess, is there anything 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about the experience that we didn’t talk about, you think would 
be important, for the public to know? 
MANUEL [0:48:46]: Really, like, I’m pretty sure you’ve heard 
this a lot, I mean, like the, they, they stress it a lot, like 
the things we do out there, it’s mistakes made out there that 
saves them from making mistakes out there. But the difference 
is, a mistake made out here, they can recover from, it’s not 
actual, it’s not an actual game over. But, out there, you get 
shot, real is real, and that, that’s what I’d like people to 
understand, is what we do is really important. 
SIMS [0:49:19]: Does it feel different, like working that type 
of job versus a, like a security guard in terms of like, the, 
you know, kind of the, bigger mission? Does it bring you-  
MANUEL [0:49:32]: I mean, like if you work in the pol-, as a 
police officer out there in the box, it’s pretty much at the 
same field, the only difference is that you have the cha-, I 
mean, of course as a security guard here, you have the chance of 
getting shot at. But out there in the box, it’s a much higher 
risk, but at the end of the day, it’s, it’s not real, you know 
that, but, really, like you said, the mission is pretty much the 
same, you’re protecting. But as a, as a citizen, I mean, pretty 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much the roles are same, the same, like if something happened on 
our soil and the, the soldiers started heading out, I mean we do 
everything we can to help them. But it’s, compl-, completely 
different across the seas when, where the citizens are uncertain 
and we try to portray that as well.  
SIMS [0:50:27]: Great, I really enjoyed talking with you, so, I 
talked mostly with older people so it’s good to get like, you 
know, a kind of younger perspective, it’s really great. 
MANUEL [0:50:42]: I’m surpri-, I’m surprised a bunch of the, 
some of the younger people didn’t actually step out, cause I 
mean, we, we’re the people that are out there getting thrown in 
the dirt and everything. 
SIMS [0:50:51]: Yeah, I’ve seen some of that, it was actually in 
front of the consulate in Dara Lam, it was like a kind of mob 
protest. And I just, it was confusing because I, I think someone 
was like slightly hurt, like the wrist or something, you know, 
but there was just like so much shouting going on, and like you 
couldn’t really tell, you know, like if it was real world or 
not,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUEL [0:51:18]: Oh, I didn’t even realize, my wife is texting 
me  
SIMS [0:51:21]: Oh.
