00:00    Introduction 
Lorio 
00:32 
 
Born and raised in Baton Rouge. Of French and Italian 
ancestry. Lorio is actually French. Had a “t” at the end at one 
point. “Know nothing but Baton Rouge.” Born and raised in 
Baton Rouge along with a sister. Attended Baton Rouge High 
School as did his parents.

02:23 
Started doodling and drawing around the 10th grade. Started 
becoming sort of a school artist painting the school “bulldog” 
mascot in the locker rooms and on the gym floor or walls. 
Volunteered to do it so he could get out of class. “That’s how  
it all started, drawing bulldogs.” Took some art classes while 
in college. Did not graduate. Instead sort of evolved into the 
sign business “one sign at a time.” Somebody needed a sign, 
Lorio had the confidence to say, “I think I can do that.” Started 
doing it trial and error, then got into the sign painter trade. 
 
03:49 
Era before computer graphics. Hand lettering was the way of 
signage be it a vehicle, building front, or a window. “That was 
my trade and that is my trade.” Worked at Lamar Advertising 
where all the billboards were hand painted. 
 
04:19 
Signboards now are composed of stretched vinyl. Large 
printers are used to print out the copy and design. When  
Lorio worked for Lamar Advertising, 14’ x 48’ highway 
signboards were all hand drawn on plywood. Blew up the 
pattern on the plywood, roughed in the design with charcoal, 
then hand painted the signs. 
 
05:25 
Lorio makes a paper pattern. Begins by taping the paper to an 
easel. Draws out the patten using charcoal, and then fine 
tunes it using a Sharpie.  
 
06:08 
 
Four or five years into the trade, sandblasted wooden signs 
began to appear in Baton Rouge for the first time. Something 
local residents had never seen. “Everybody was blown away 
by them things.” They soon took over. From the late 1970s to 
the 2000s, according to Lorio, everybody in Baton Rouge had 
a sandblasted wooden sign. Given their popularity, for 20 
years Lorio got away from the hand lettered signs focusing 
instead on carved wood signs. Does not use plotters or 
printers for his work. Now with the new technology hand 
rendered signs are no longer in demand. “The technology is 
really...it’s just taken over.” “Old school” style signs are a 
durable product that may last for twenty years or more. “Just 
like any wood product in the South, you have to maintain 
them.” Road film, mildew, sun beats the signs to death and 
breaks the paint down. Longterm weathering of the wood has 
hurt his trade.

09:44 
Top of the line clear grade, all heart, vertical grain California 
Redwood is Lorio’s first choice for all his signs. Baton Rouge 
once obsessed with sandblasted wooden signs. Now on to 
other things. Redwood sources dried up, so Lorio switched to 
Spanish Cedar. Not the same quality. Synthetic products now 
on the market, foam composites that mimic the density of the 
redwoods. The material carves and sands easily and holds up 
to weather. 
 
11:45 
Over time only a small circle of vendors in Baton Rouge 
produced the sandblasted signs so Lorio always had turn-
away business. All business was by work of mouth. Lorio was 
known throughout the city as the “wooden sign guy.” 
Sponsored sports teams with Al Lorio Wooden Signs on the 
jerseys. 
 
13:42 
Pricing? Always priced per square foot based on what his 
competitor(s) was doing. 
 
14:07 
Sample of a carved sign made from redwood brought into the 
shop where Lorio was working, “I mean, it changed my life, 
dude...oh my god, that’s what I’ve got to do...I’m going to do 
that for the rest of my life.” 
 
15:07 
Trend has passed except for special applications (i.e. lawyers 
offices, hunting lodges). Retail not so much anymore.  
Lorio’s current project is a sign with the lettering hand-drawn 
and hand-cut. Carved in old cypress with Christmas lights 
mounted in the letters, it will be sandblasted to lend texture. 
 
18:18 
Alway had one full time helper. Lorio would sketch out design 
in pencil. Helper would make a digital file out of it. “Sign guys” 
at one time were expected to provide the full package 
including design of a logo, if needed.  
 
20:32  
Technology has changed the industry. “Shot me in the foot.  
It’s great for everybody except an old-school sign painter like 
myself. The technology is cool if you’re using it, but it hurts  
me more than helps me.” 
 
20:57 
End of first segment.

00:00 
Unlike welding, or even saddle making, technology has had 
an enormous impact on the sign making trade. 
  
00:37 
Lorio is embittered and sad at the impact of new technologies 
on his old-stye way of making a living. At one time people 
would come just to watch Lorio work. They were in awe of his 
skill at drawing letters freehand with such perfection. More 
talk about new technologies with access to 1000s of fonts. 
Lorio typically designed his own lettering or logo unless the 
client had his or her own. 
 
03:38 
Most challenging jobs? Seafood sign for Mike Anderson’s 
restaurant. World’s Fair sign in 1984 for beer company. “This 
Boudreaux and Thibodeaux thing [sign is]“whipping my ass.” 
 
05:20  
Lorio commented on his ability to design a sign in his head as 
the client relates what he or she wants. Commented on  
“rush” the client experiences seeing his or her name on a 
sign. 
 
06:40 
To the surprise of the interviewer, Lorio pulled out his phone 
then began commenting about the signs pictured. Examples 
of hand-drawn letters on signs for hunting lodge versus letters 
on sign done with a plotter. More samples. Custom sign for 
Tasajillo Ranch in Texas, redwood, sand-blasted. 
 
09:15 
Lorio explained how sand blasting creates a ridge and valley 
textured effect on the sign.   
 
10:30 
Lorio related past situations where the client had given him 
free rein from the initial sketch to the finished sign. “I just did 
my thing.” Lorio continued, explaining how a sign is rendered 
from start to finish. 
 
11:20 
 
Lorio talked more about his ability to create fonts of all types 
by sketching them out, in lieu of using a computer generated 
print-out. He then spoke about the Al Lorio design look that he 
has developed over his career with its elaborate swoops and 
swirls.

12:10 
Lorio continued his commentary on the signs pictured on his 
cell phone. Township signs, more contemporary signs, classic 
attorney signs. “They are everywhere in downtown Baton 
Rouge...if it be for attorneys I’d be out of business a long time 
ago.” 
 
14:00 
Lorio has been in the sign making trade since 1976. 
 
14:40 
Lorio explained how he works with other materials including 
granite and steel. 
 
15:50  
Are folks getting away from handcrafted work? Lorio avoided 
the question. Question is repeated. Brief response: “Some 
people still appreciate it.” 
 
16:38 
End of second segment.

Interview shifts to Lorio’s workshop where he elaborates on 
how the pattern, once drawn, is transferred to a rubber 
coating on the sign itself with a pounce wheel. Used the 
expression “pounce your chalk.” Approach is now antiquated, 
replaced with newer technology. 
 
01:34 
Lorio talked about his current sign project for a bar downtown 
complete with LED lights. The sign is to made of old cypress. 
Spoke about other projects underway including signs he is 
currently refurbishing. 
 
02:45 
Shared a sample of a new composite material that replaces 
wood. Lorio mocked its termite-proof quality. 
 
03:30  
Pointed out other signs being refinished. 
 
04:35 
Lorio talked about the history of his home. 
 
05:06 
Remarked after his father and what an excellent carpenter  
he was. 
 
 
6 
05:50 
 
Conjecture on where Lorio’s drawing abilities came from. 
 
 
06:04 
All of Lorio’s work samples are on his phone now. Offered to 
show off examples of his work in the area. 
 
06:31 
End of third segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
Hereafter are comments recorded while Lorio was driving the 
interviewer around in his truck pointing out examples of his 
work. 
 
 
LS110336  
 
00:00 
Lorio talked about his boiled crawfish business that he runs 
on the side in season. Given the physicality required in the 
making and erection of signs, Lorio talked about the  
possibility of moving in other directions most noticeably with a 
bar and restaurant on site at his home place. 
 
03:36 
End of fourth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110337 
 
00:00 
Lorio talked more about his boiled crawfish business. “Always 
did it for friends and family. I was the guy that boiled.” Spoke 
to his future, mixing classic old-school sign making with a new 
bar/restaurant enterprise. That is, if the liquor license is 
approved. 
 
01:36 
End of fifth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110338 
 
00:00 
Lorio talked about the care he takes with the graded crawfish 
he buys and sells. 
 
01:11 
End of sixth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110339 
 
 
7 
00:00 
Lorio remarked there was a time when the sign business was 
so frenetic there was no time for boiled crawfish sales. Now 
with times changing he reflected on what might become of his 
home place. 
 
02:00 
End of seventh segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110340 
 
00:00 
Lorio commented on the importance of maintaining his signs. 
Talked about others stealing his ideas. Absolutely infuriates 
him.  
 
00:42 
Talked about how the business climate has changed. Less 
freedom to be creative as clients today often come with logo 
and design in hand. 
 
01:53 
“I value my creativity more than others do.” Creativity is what 
Lorio is selling. Absolutely infuriates Lorio when someone 
takes his design and gives it to someone else to use.  
Leads to feelings of betrayal. “Something you never get over 
as an artist. 
 
03:05 
Lorio commented about each sign as he pointed them out. 
 
04:05 
Lorio commented on the use of cypress.  
 
04:43 
End of eight segment. 
 
 
LS110341 
 
00:00 
Lorio talked about maintenance issues with his subdivision 
front entrance signs once the housing developer has left the 
scene. 
 
01:36 
End of ninth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110342 
 
00:00 
 
“Not interested in conforming to the technology.” Rather do 
something entirely different like opening up a bar or 
restaurant. “The sign business has outgrown Al Lorio.”

01:15 
 
Lorio talked about his involvement with The Walls Project. 
Winifred Riley one of the backers, wife of the owner of Lamar 
Advertising headquartered in Baton Rouge. Lorio worked at 
Lamar when he was 18. There he learned how to paint 
billboards. 
 
 
3:37 
When Lorio started creating his signature signs it was a new 
look altogether in Baton Rouge. 
 
04:28 
End of interview.
