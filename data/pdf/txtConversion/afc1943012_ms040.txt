James
July 9, 1943 Dr. Willis Laurence James The Fort Valley State College Fort Valley,
Georgia
Dear Dr. James:
In a conversation with me, Lewis Jones suggested that you might borrow the Fisk
University recording machine for the August Festival. This seems to me like a good idea
and I hope you will follow it up.
How is everything going?
With best wishes,
Faithfully, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
