ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN 
SONGSTER. 
The Rocky Road to Dublin. 
AIR :--" Irish Jig," 
In the merry month of June, 
When first from home I 
started, 
And left the girls alone: 
Sad and broken-hearted, 
Shook hands with Father dear, 
Kissed my darling Mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother: 
Then, off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout bl ack-
thorn, 
To banish glio,lt or goblin: 
With a 
pair of bran new brogues, 
I 
rattled o'er the bogs : 
Sure I 
frightened all the dogs, 
On the rocky road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
For, it is the rocky road, 
Here's the road to Dublin; 
Here's the rocky road, 
Now, fire away to Dublin!

6 The Rocky Road to Dublin 
The steam- coach was at hand, 
The driver said he'd cheap ones, 
But, sure, the luggage van 
Was too much for my ha'pence. 
For England I 
was bound, 
It would never do to baulk it 
For, every step of the road, 
Be dad I 
says I, I'll walk it! 
I 
did not sigh nor moan, 
Until I 
saw Athlone, 
A 
pain in my shin bone, 
It set my heart a 
bubbling; 
And fearing the big cannon, 
Looking o'er the Shannon, 
I 
very quickly ran on 
The rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is, &c. 
In Mullingar, that night, 
I 
rested limbs so weary: 
Started by daylight, 
With spirits light and airy : 
Took a 
drop of the pure, 
To keep my spirits from sinking. 
That's always an Irishman's cure, 
Whenever he's troubled with thinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while 
At my comical style, 
Set my heart a 
bubbling, 
They axed if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Until I 
was almost tired 
Of the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is, &c. 
In Dublin next arrived; 
I 
thoualit it was a 
pity 
To be so soon deprived of a 
view 
Of that fine city.

'Twas then I 
took a 
stroll 
All among the quality, 
My bundle then was stole 
in a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Thinks I: I'll look behind, 
No bundle could I 
find 
Upon my st ,ck a 
wobbling. 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue 
It wasn't much in vogue 
On the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is, &c. 
A 
coachman raised his hand, 
As if myself was wanting; 
I 
went up to a 
stand, 
Full of cars for jaunting. 
Step up, my boy ! says he, 
Alt, ha! that I 
will with pleasure: 
And to the strawberry beds 
I'll drive you at your leisure. 
A 
strawberry bed ! says I, 
Faith ! that would be too high, 
On one of straw I'll lie, 
And the berries won't be troubling. 
Ile drove me out as far, 
Upon an outside car : 
Faith! such jolting never wor 
On the rocky road to Dublin! 
For, it is, &c. 
I, soon got out of that, 
My spirits never failing, 
I 
landed on the quay, 
Just as the ship was sailing. 
The Captain at me roared, 
Swore that no room had he, 
But when I 
leaped on board, 
They a 
cabin found for Paddy.

I 
played such rummy rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
With the water round me bubbling. 
But when off Holyhead, 
I 
wished that I 
was dead, 
Or safely put in bed, 
On the rocky road to Dublin. 
For, it is, &c. 
The boys in Liverpool, 
When in the dock I 
landed, 
Called myself a 
fool, 
I 
could no longer stand it: 
My blood began to boil, 
My temper I 
wa4 losing, 
And Poor Old Erin's Isle 
They all began abusing. 
Hurrah ! my boys, says I, 
My Shillalah I 
let fly: 
Some Galway boys were by, 
They saw I 
was a 
hobble in; 
Then, with a 
loud Hurrah 1 
They joined me in the fray : 
Faug-a-ballagh ! clear the way 
For the rocky road to Dublin 1 
For, it is, &c, 
Take this Cup of Sparkling Wine. 
Take this cup of sparkling wine, 
Warm'd by shining sun above, 
In whose glorious beams combine 
Life of rapture, peace with love. 
Quaff the cup with sparkling wine, 
Nectar coldest hearts can move ; 
Quaff, and from its hallowed rim 
See its sparkling tide reveal, 
Through clouds, to eyes of mortals dim. 
The joys that spirits feel, 
To thee we drink then rosy wine, 
My heart and soul be thine.

Ant:--" The Young Man from the Country." 
When first I 
came from Dublin, 
A 
policeman's place I 
took— 
A 
silver watch I 
soon possessed,1 
And the right side of the cook. 
I 
looked so Nv el 1 
in uniform, 
That girls both dark and fair— 
No matter whether night or morn, 
On me their eyes would glare, 
Full of love for Mr. Peeler, 
On terrace, street, or square. 
Full of love, 8x. 
Now I 
was never cross my boys, 
When asked to have a 
drink, 
By swells who made a 
little noise, 
If the silver I 
heard chink. 
But if they wouldn't stand a 
brown, 
I 
stands none of their cheek— 
I 
lets 'em know I've been in town, 
Much ion crer than a 
w ek, 
On this gallant Irish Peeler, 
Who did thing on the square. 
Oh this gallant, &c. 
One niffht while eating chicken-pie, 
At my Susan's at the square : 
A 
thunderin' knock came at the door, • 
Which knocked me off the chair. 
'Twos her missus—an' I 
heard her say— 
What thief have ye below ?

I 
then recovered from my fright, 
And up the stairs did go— 
Wid Bulls-eye turned on, and staff in hand, 
Indeed I 
wasn't slow. 
Said I, madam, I've walked in here, 
My duty for to do, 
And lay my hand on any thafe, 
That comes to plunder you. 
For I'm a 
gallant, &e. 
Said she, policeman, come with me, 
And take a 
glass of wine— 
If you are her cousin, don't be free, 
With this servant girl of mine. 
Then in the drawing-room we went, 
An' was waited on by Sue; 
Her missus took a 
sly glance at me, 
Thinks I, this game will do. 
Oh this gallant, &e. 
Now a 
fortnight after this affair, 
Poor Sukey got the sack, 
My situation I 
resigned; 
An' married her in a 
crack. 
The lady—not the lady's maid— 
Do you think boys I 
was green, 
To force myself out of the force, 
An' marry this ancient queen. 
I 
am a 
gallant, &e. 
Her age it was three-score and ten, 
Her skin was rather tough ; 
A wig she wore, false teeth she had, 
Of her charms I've said enough. 
Three months of wedded bliss we spent, 
Sure, quite devoid of care; 
When she kicked the bucket one fine day, 
An' left me in the square.

am a 
gallant, &c.

Second Thoughts. 
When Orpheus went down to the regions below,. 
His Eurydice to fetch away 
The favor was granted, as we all well know, 
But on certain conditions they say. 
So returning from It— it came into his head, 
That wives are not always quite civil ; 
He paused for a 
moment, then turned round she 
fled, 
And quickly went back to the d—l. 
Farewell my dear wife, he gallantly cried, 
I 
find matrimony's no jest, 
My head is now clear, and I 
have espied, 
That oft second thoughts are the best.

When bachelors you courting come, 
Don't say " yes" until you know, 
If they've enough to keep a

For poverty's so shocking low.

You'll lead a 
very wretched life ; 
Your husband he will go to smash, 
And you be but a 
wretched wife. 
Never be in haste, Sze 
Should any widower appear, 
Altho' he may have lots of tin ; 
Learn if he has any children dear, 
Thfore, girls, you are taken in.

To nine or ten young squalling brats 
Your happiness will soon be o'er, 
And be, perhaps, reduced to dine on sprats. 
Never be in haste, &c. 
Beware, young damsel, of all men, 
Who sport beard and mustachios; 
I 
can assure you, nine in ten, 
To matrimonial quiet are foes. 
They only like to gad, and rake, 
And make of a 
girl a 
walkinstick ; 
And, it they con, will advantage take. 
Avoid them, as you would Old Nick.

The fiddler began for to scrape, 
Their feathers the ladies did shake: 
They all Taglioni did ape, 
Till the floor was in a 
quake. 
Toe and heel was all the go, 
With an elegance quite sublime: 
The fiddler they dodged too and fro, 
For they all danced in their own time. 
Och, it was, &c. 
Calamity water they took 
Till both of their eyes were wet; 
Tho' they tried engaging to look, 
They couldn't their nature forget. 
Lasses quarrelled ' bout Jack and ' bout Jim, 
And they foueht, and they swore, and they 
tore, 
But their heads beginning-

They one and all rolled on the floor. 
Och, it was, &c. 
The smoke of the pipe filled the room, 
They scarcely could each other see ; 
And their o'rles were all in a 
gloom, 
Through potations of ,gin and whiskey. 
The men now got in a 
rage, 
For they like the ladies were slewed, 
Their wrath no reason could assuage, 
So a 
general fight ensued. 
Och, it was, &c. 
Next. day when things came to view, 
As you may well suppose, 
Their eyes looked wondrous blue, 
And fat had grown each nose.

again. 
Dear voice of the past, like the lone harp of Tara, 
It wakes 'mid the ruins of all I 
deplore : 
Farewell to thy green hills, my fair Connamara,. 
First home of my heart, I shall see thee no

Mother Murphy as it has been said, 
Was fond of her little boy, Pat, 
But then it came into her head, 
As mice she had none—why a 
cat, 
" 
So " Paddy" she coaxingly cried, 
I 
have but yourself and a

And as I 
the latter have sty'd, 
I 
think you had better be off now. 
For sure you must see it is clear. 
That I 
cannot do without her, 
But as to yourself, my own dear, 
You, easy, the rest can infer, 
So Paddy set off on his legs, 
And soon o'er the ocean did sail, 
In a 
butter boat laden with eggs, 
And plenty of Guinness's ale. 
To London he straight made his way, 
In hopes that a 
fortune was there, 
Which he might seize on as his prey, 
Among the gay ranks of the fa•ir, 
He blarney'd and coax'd all he saw, 
With a 
smile and an elegant grin, 
But never a 
guinea could draw, 
From any he tried hard to win. 
The reason was obvious to all, 
They didn't much like his queer eyes, 
For one was that they call a " wall," 
The other a 
Cyclops in size. 
He danced with an air full of grace, 
And ogled the ladies all around, 
But none were pleased with his strange face, 
They looked at him, then on the ground.

None ever was equal to him , 
And his name was Arthur O'Biadley,

Sweet Arthur O'Bradley 0. 
Now Arthur being stout and bold, 
And near upon thirty years old, 
He needs a 
wooing must go, 
To get him a 
helpmate you know ; 
When gaining young Dolly's consent, 
Next day to be married they went, 
And to make himself noble appear, ' 
He mounted the old pad mare. 
He chose her because she was blood, 
And the prime of his father's stud ; 
She was windg,all'd, spavin, and blind, 
And had lost the near leg behind ; 
She'd been cropp'd, and deck'd, and fired, 
Yet seldom or ever was tied ; 
She'd got such abundance of bone, 
She was called the high bred roan. 
A 
credit to Arthur O'Bradley, &c. 
He had doffed his drudgery clothe? 
And put on his holiday hose, 
ills coat was of scarlet so fine, 
Full trim'd, with buttons behind ; 
Two sleeves it had it is true. 
One yellow, the other was blue, 
The cape and cuffs were of green, 
And the largest that ever was seen. 
A 
hat, though greasy and tore, 
Cock'd up with a 
feather before; 
And under his chin it was tied, 
With a 
slip of the old Cow's hide ; 
His breeches three times had been turn'd, 
And two holes through the left thigh was 
hurn'd;

One leather the other of tin. 
For stirrups he'd two patten rings, 
Made fast to the girth with two strings,

Which long had been eat by the moth ; 
A

Yet still he look'd gallant and gay.

Thus acoutred to the church he did ride, 
And Dolly she walk'd by the side; 
When coming up to the church door, 
In the. midst of five hundred or more,

Which put the old clerk in a 
fright ; 
The Parson so trembled and shook, 
That presently down drop his book. 
Which Arthur soon picked up again, 
And swore if he didn't begin, 
He surely would scuttle his nob, 
If he didn't get on with the job. 
With that he began for to sing, 
So loud that he made the church ring,

heard some strains of music

When a

Be you ready, sister Mary,

Till the semr so strange had ended, 
And the sin gers flown away.

And told her everything, 
But I 
could not guess the meaning 
Of the song I 
heard them sing—

heard them, 
And the third night, too, they sung, 
While I

heard a

Enough, they murmur at my grave 
He like a 
soldier fell. 
Beside yon stream whose silver light, 
Winds gliding through the vale, 
Now lost in shade, now glancing bright, 
Dwells Lillian of the Dale. 
The air that breathes around her cot, 
Not purer than her soul could be ; 
Contented in her bidden lot, 
A 
bright and peerless gem is she. 
But silent streams run very deep, 
A 
living calm they roll ; 
Yet in that calm those torrents sleep, 
Which freed, know no control. 
Thus deep and full flow Lillian's life, 
So full of joy, so trouble free, 
So deep with love, unchafed by strife, 
A 
pure and priceless pearl to be.

Bearing throug!1 winter the blooms of the spring. 
Charm of our gladness, 
Friend of our sadness, 
Angel of life, when its pleasures take wing,

She shall be first in the songs that we sing, 
Aye, she shall be first in the songs that we sing. 
Who shall ce nearest? 
Who shall be dearest ? 
Named but with honour and pride evermore, 
He the undaunted, 
Whose banner is planted 
On glory's high ramparts and battlements hoar. 
Fearless of danger, 
To falsehood a 
stranger, 
Looking not back while there's duty before. 
He shall be nearest, - 
He shall be dearest, 
He shall be first in our hearts evermore— 
Aye, he shall be first in our hearts evermore.

Marled you her eye of heavenly blue ?

The other blushing at the wound.

Have Faith In One Another. 
Have faith in one another, when ye meet in friend-
ship's name, 
For a 
true friend is a 
brother, and his heart should 
throb the same, 
Though your paths in life may differ, • since the 
hour when first ye met. 
Have faith in one auother, when you whisper 
love's fond vow, 
It will not be always summer, nor always bright 
as DOW ; 
And when winter time comes o'er ye, if some kin-
dred heart ye share, 
And have faith in one another, ye shall never more 
despair. 
And when winter time, & c. 
Have faith in one another, for should doubt alone 
incline, 
It would make this world a 
desert, where the sun 
would never shine, 
We have some transient sorrow, that o'ershadows 
us to-day, 
But have faith in one another, and it soon shall 
pass away. 
Have faith in one another, and let honour be your 
guide. 
Let the truth alone be spoken, whatever may be-
tide. 
The false may reign a 
season, and oh, doubt not 
but it will, 
But have faith in one another, and the truth shall 
triumph still.

Paddy's Dream. 
Am:— " Cow eat the Piper." 
Of the year sixty-one, that's the next one to come, 
I'll just give a 
short declaration ; 
And though strange it may seem, I'd a 
comical 
dream, 
Of which I 
shall make an oration. 
I 
dreamt I 
was dead, fast asleep in my bed, 
When Judy cried Paddy now wake up; 
Then up quick I 
rose, through a whack on the 
nose. 
And my darling ould stick I 
did take up. 
Singing whack fal de dal, &c. 
I 
thought in my dream of the beautiful cream, 
That makes every Irishman frisky ; 
At the famid " Pig and Cat," I was flat on my 
back, 
Blind drunk with a 
tight skin of whiskey. 
It was Donnybrook. fair, Prince and Albert was 
there, 
Knocking down three sticks a 
penny ; 
Jonny Russell likewise, with a 
pair of black eyes 
Just received from the boys of Kilkenny. 
Whack fal de dal, &c. 
In my dream too 1 
saw, knocking at the Queen's 
door, 
Napoleon the third in dejection ; 
And ' tis my firm belief he came for relief, 
Likewise to implore her protection. 
You must come bye and bye, said the queen rather 
shy, 
For my kitchen is all in a 
bustle ; 
And Pm all alone, for the prince has just gone 
Out on the fly with Jack Russell.

He was down on his luck, quite subdued was his 
pluck, 
The dirty half-starved looking sinner; 
For the Queen, with much grace, shut the door in 
his face, 
So he couldn't cadge even a 
dinner. 
He fled with dismay, every dog ins his day 
Not a 
bone even thrown from the airy ; 
And wherever he goes bad luck to- his nose, 
May he always be in a 
quandary. 
Whack fal de dal, &c. 
Now my dream 
conclude, and no. longer in-
trude, 
I've only just one thing to mention, 
I 
thought I 
had been out to fight for the Queen, 
And I'd got a 
most elegant pension, 
'Twas sixpence a 
day most astonishing pay, 
But the devil of any promotion ; 
And for glory and fame, it's a 
mighty big shame,. 
That's Paddy's identical notion.

Blue Eyed Nell. 
When at blush of day, carelessly I 
stray 
Amid the golden flowers, 
Tho' the fragrant rose beauties may disclose, 
To charm the sunny hours ;— 
Ali! no flowers fair can with her compare; 
She all others doth excel, 
Dark would be life's dream— cold this earth would 
seem, 
But for thee, my blue eyed Nell. 
When alone I 
rove in the silent grove, 
Beneath the pale stars' ray, 
Sweetly in the vale sings the nightingale 
As daylight fades away. 
Tim' each tender tone love might call its own 
Echoes softly thro' yon dell,--
Ah ! no sound so sweet this fond ear can greet, 
Like thy voice, my blue eyed Nell.

o. 
. 
The Demon 
of the Desert. 
This book is one of the most powerfully 
exciting 
novels 
ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in the land of the rifle, 
the tomahawk and the scalping-knife, 
Terrible 
adventures crimson almost 
every page. 
IS'o. 2. Prairie Pete; or, The 
Trapper'. Avenger. 
Of all the tales of 
wild adventure in forest and prairie 
this is the most excellent. The reader 
seems to actually hear the yell of the 
demon red- skins, sees 
their painted 
faces, and witnesses the lurid flames of 
the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. Wild .Bill, the Indian 
Slayer. Wild Bill, who is an inveter-
ate hater of the Indians. 
He never 
walks out of the house without a 
brace 
of fine revolvers slung to his waist, and 
woe to the Indians that cross his path. 
No. 4. The Death Trail. Vividly 
are these pages filled with the doings of 
the terrible Regulators of Arkansas. 
Some of these incidents are fearfully 
terrific, such as the vigil of the Indian 
by the corpse of his wife, and his awful 
revenge upon her slayer, in the ruined 
wigwam. 
No. 5. Grey-Eyed Luke. Every 
page of this thrilling book is full of in-
cident. 
The characters are natural, 
the actions life-like and full of daring. 
The hot sun of Sonora fills their veins 
and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begia to 
oompare with it. 
No. C. Six-Shooter Jim. This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a 
taste for the wild, the terrible, 
and the sanguinary. It is a 
truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rifle, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
.No. 7. The Wrecker's Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the iron-hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea-
sand. Her admirers were many among 
the ruffians that surround her—ruffians 
more cruel than the awful waves that 
dash on the wreck-strewn shore by 
which she lives. 
No. 8. The Storm Child. The 
dark caverns that honey-comb the storm 
lashed shores of Cornwall witness terri-
ble crimes in their recesses. 
Smugglers 
aye, and red-handed pirates, are the ac-
tors who seek by the fiercest means to 
perpetrate terrible and unholy crimes. 
[OvEn.] 
De Witt's Ten Cent Romances continued. 
No. 9. Captain Bob, the Moun-
tain Bevil. A 
few years ago there 
dwelt in the almost impenetrable reces-
ses of the Ozark Mountains, a 
wretch 
whose name was a 
terror to the inhabi-
tants of the surrounding region. 
With 
his band of outlaws, Indians and cut-
throats, he made raids upon the outlying 
plantations, plundered them, and, if op-
position were attempted, arson and mur-
der were added to the other dark deeds 
No. 10. Wild Bill's First Trait. 
Is a 
plain recital of the first of the many 
adventures in which this daring Indian 
Fighter, Buffalo Hunter, Trapper and 
Union Guide, was an actor. The story 
is told by himself, and is very entertain 
tug. 
No. 11. Sam Sutton, the Scalp 
l'aker. In this bock figure many of 
the Indians who are now making the 
Great Plains a " dark and bloody 
ground." Sam will be readily recogniz-
ed as a 
real character by all our officers 
who have been stationed in the Indian 
country. 
No. 12. The Crawling Snake. 
This famous Scout and Indian Scalper , 
went far ahead of the most cunning In-
dian in tricks and stratagems.- 
lie 
could crawl right through the best 
watched camp, and knife an Indian in 
the heart of his encampment 
No. 13. Big .Lige; or, The lied 
Cloud of the Soshones. The best of good 
stories. 
It tells of a 
young hunter who 
found a 
brave Indian-slayer wounded 
to death 
he succors him, and receives 
his blessing and his rifle. When he 
himself is attacked Big Lige comes to 
his aid. 
No. 14. Zoph Slaughter. A Scout 
with the eye of a 
hawk and a 
heart of 
steel—with a 
wit keen as his scalping-
knife. 
A love story runs its silver 
cord through the blood-stained tissue. 
No. 15. Tcatherskin; or, The 
Prairie Guide This well-hnown Scout 
was an odd mixture of Kit Carson and 
Old Adams the grizzly-tamer; and 
could out-ride, out- shoot and out-fight 
the tallest red-skin that ever took a 
white man's scalp. 
No. 16. Black-Beard. Thisfero-
cious pirate, who seemed to love crime 
for its own sake, was one oi the most 
skillful sailors that ever took his " trick 
at the helm ;" and Isis terrible deeds are 
lis•ened to with a 
strange intereat in tile 
fo'castle, when the wind is " blowing 
great guns." 
No. 17. Adelaide, the Avower. 
How a 
young, lovely and innocent girl, 
followed the fortunes of a 
black-hearted 
corsair, ( seeking to avenge the wrongs 
inflicted on her lover) is fully told in 
these pages. Amid toe hushed rains or 
the fearful storm, the fair girl follows 
the wretch like the figure of doom. 
No. IS. Old Pike, the Indian. 
Trader. 
Cobb, Robinson and Ben-
nett son to have united all their skill in 
producing this most capital Indian 
story. 
It has the boundless invention 
of the first—the fidelity of the second, 
and the fluency of the third. 
It is mar-
vellously well told, and true to life. 
No. 19. Tiger-lread; 
or, The 
Spectre of the Swamp. Fearfully inter-
esting are the strange scenes in this book. 
Wild hunters, wild beasts and witches 
savages, run riot in its exciting pages.
