J. H. RYAN'S 
Great Personation of the " Irish Guide." 
TRAVELLERS to the " Green Isle" never appear to tire of rehearsing 
the peculiarities, goad humor, and ready wit of the " Jarveys" that drive 
the little jaunting-ears about Dublin and its vicinage. 
These fellows rat-
tle over the stones, their tongues wagging all the while; their uncontrol-
lable spirits and rollicking humor making the roughest roads smooth. 
Many Irish comedians have essayed to represent this character; but 
rarely with success. They have too often mistaken " cheek " for wit, and 
vulgarity for humor. But no such faults are apparent in M. RYAN'S 
delineation of the " Irish Guide." He has studied the character from the 
life, and he gives us a 
delicious picture of the drolleries of the original. 
It is certain that the best dramatic critics vie with each other in eulogiz-
ing Mu. RYAN's capital rendering of the amusing " Jarvey," a 
character 
as essentially Irish as the Shamrock itself. 
Every person that delights in 
a 
perfect character-painting of that " mad wag," the driver of the jaunt-
ing-car, should See M R. RYAN play the part. 
It is reality itself, and it 
requires no great exercise of imagination, while listening to his inimita-
ble " soothering " brogue, to fancy one's self on the banks of the Liffey or 
driving through the unbrageous avenues of the incomparable " Phaynix." 
But while this gentleman is the very embodiment of " rale " fun and 
sparkling wit, he never sullies his lips by profanity or vulgarity to raise 
a 
laugh from the thoughtless or win the applause of the ignorant. 
It 
may here be appropriately mentioned that this present edition of his songs 
is in every way superior to all previous issues. 
The songs are more numer-
ous, are more correctly printed, and many of Mn. RYAN'S original poems 
and songs are given that have never previously appeared in print. 
Here, 
too, we should mention that Mn. RYAN'S literary abilities as a 
poet are 
not a 
bit less than his great merit as a performer. 
Permeated with a 
love of his native country, every throb of his heart is true to the beauti-
ful Isle of the Sea. We trust that the public appreciation and admiration 
of this young poet-actor's talents will be as universal as his deserts are 
great.

NOTICES OF THE PRESS ON MR. J. H. RYAN 
"SHANDY McGmr.E."—Mr. J. H. RYAN as Shandy, and also as the old 
woman, is almost unrivalled. 
His witticisms are splendid, and his jokes 
are such as to keep his audience lapsing from one fit of hysterics to an-
other.— Yew York Sunday Mercury, fan. 23, 1374. 
Tnr. Imsn COMEDIAN, M R. J. 
II. 
RYAN.—It is with great pleasure we 
hear of our young and talented friend RYAN's success in his specialty— the 
Irish Drama. He has revolutionized the burlesque, hitherto fashionable 
and popular with the thoughtless, who only cared that their risibilities 
were pandered to, while it has long and cruelly pained sensible and reflec-
tive men; but in his style they have more fun exhibited, more genius il-
lustrated, and more patriotism consecrated, than judicious lovers of " The 
Island of Sorrow" thought it possible to combine in exhibitions of the de-
scription to which Mr. RYAN iS attached. He has just published the third 
series of his stage songs—many of them his own composition—a 
perusal 
of which, together with his previous efforts, will illustrate our remarks 
above more bully than anything short of seeing or hearing himself on the 
stage. 
Mr. SF.AVY must be congratulated on having secured ter his " Hi-
bernia's Gems" the services of such a 
trio of stars ( we might justly say, 
such gems of Hibernia) as the handsom ,
., versatile, and gifted Miss .
NEL-
LIE VINCE ,T, the eloquent lecturer and inimitable pianist, Mr. M. J. 
O'MAnoNy, and the incomparable song, dance, and generally humorous 
artist, Mr. J. H. ItyAN.—Xew York Xelos. 
J. IL RYAN is an exception to the general rule of Irish comedians, who 
think the more ridicule they adopt the better they are received ; but this 
gentleman, in placing himself above the level of such performers, has won 
for himself the love and esteem of our Irish citizni.—itlbany Argus. 
J. II. RYAN'S original character of Shandy McGuire is one of true patri-
otic cast, and is highly instructive ; morality is conspicuous throughout, 
and it is really amusing, which takes an actor of ability to do it justice. 
Mr. RYAN'S conception of this role is unrividled.—Hackensuck Herald. 
Mr. IlYAN is a 
comedian of rare ability ; a 
native of Dublin city, he is 
quite young. has a 
good voice and a 
good appearance. 
He is rapidly pro-
gressiug.—Philadelphia Evening Star. 
J. II . 
RYAN has gained a 
good deal of importance as an Irish comedian, 
and renders his songs with that amount of patriotic sentiment and pa-
thos which only an Irish exile his he is) and worthy son of old Ireland can 
feel — Sunday Citizen, New York. 
It has been our fortune to witness many representations of our race on 
the st ;tge by various actors, but with none were we more pleased than with 
Mr. J. IL RY AN. 
It his been well said, " His witticisms are splendid 
and his jokes are such as keep his audience continually lapsing from one 
fit of hysterics into another." His attire is in keeping with his character— 
neat ; mil tidy ; assuming the character of shandy McGuire, lie dresses as 
to impersonate a 
comfortable farmer's son, and is perfectly Ire from vul-
garity. 
Id is episode, entitled " Shandy McGuire." is highly moral and in-
struct ive, and possesses much of that wondrous wit which is so conspicu-
ous in the general character of the Irish race. 
His Irishism is also promi-
nent in his every movement. He is a 
good Irishman, and more, an Iiish 
exile. 
We wish him every success in his dramatic career.—.1lusical Bou-
quet. 
SHANDY McGUIRE. 
Composed, and sung in the Panorama of Ireland, by J. H. Rwt... 
Ant. — ' 
Kingdom Coming." 
I 
AM a 
Dublin carman, as you see, 
I 
am always on the lob, 
By the appearance of my yoke, 
I 
seldom lose a 
job ; 
Young girls down about Sandy Mount, 
They like my yoke to hire; 
When I 
am not to their call, 
They ask for Shandy McGuire. 
CHORUS. 
As jarvey Shandy, 0, 
Some calls me Shandy McGuire; 
I 
can sing a 
song or dance a 
jig, 
And my jaunting car is for hire. 
One fine day on Stephen's Green, 
I 
met a 
charming cook ; 
I 
thought the best thing I. could do 
Her on my car to hook ; 
When up she got the mare did trot, 
And the people did us admire ; 
Her trottin' style it made them smile, 
As drove by Shandy McGuire. 
As jarvey, etc. 
At length we arrived at our journey's end, 
In the middle of Britain street, 
Where the cook she asked me in with her, 
I 
would for to have a 
treat, 
During, which a 
bobby he came up, 
For my name and number did inquire, 
And said next day at court should be 
Your servant, Shandy McGuire. 
As jarvey, etc. 
Sure next day 1 
appeared in court ; 
A 
Ftatetnent there did make ; 
By the statement that I 
made, 
My badge they did not take; 
So say you are satisfied with me, 
Sure what more can you desire ? 
If you say so, away I 
will go, 
As happy Shandy McGuire. 
As jarvey, etc.

MOLLIE DEAR. 
TO DONNYBROOK FAIR. 
Composed and sung by J. H. 
RYAN. 
Am.---" Limerick Fair." 
Now it was a 
Monday morning, 
In the pleasant month of May, 
As myself I 
took a 
jolly ride 
With charming Molly Gray, 
Whose eyes shone like the stars, 
And her cheeks were like the rose; 
I'll tell you all about it, 
Just as my story goes. 
CHORUS. 
But as I 
drive my jaunting car, 
I 
drive away dull care, 
And never can forget the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
And never can forget the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
Arrah, Molly had on her Sunday gownd, 
And I 
my Sunday coat ; 
It was in my breeches pocket 
I 
had a 
one pound note, 
With an odd few shillings or so, 
And the whip was in my hand ; 
She jumped upon my Irish car, 
And away we drove so grand. 
But as I 
drive, etc. 
But Molly and me both agreed 
To become man and wife, 
So the best we try in every way 
To be happy all our life, 
Or should the times be good or bad, 
We drive away dull care ; 
We never shall fo rfr,et the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
But as I 
drive, etc. 
So fill your glasses full, my friends, 
And give one toast with me ; 
Here's success to dear old Ireland, 
The brialit gem of the sea; 
Let us hope the day is drawing nigh, 
And may we live to see 
That poor, downtrodden Emerald Isle 
A 
land of liberty. 
But as I 
drive, etc. 
Ouim mountain brooks were rushing, 
Mollie dear, 
The Autumn eve was flushing, 
Mollie dear, 
But brighter was your blushing, 
When first, your murmurs hushing, 
I 
told my love outgushing, 
Mollie dear. 
How sadly they have ended, 
The ring betwixt us broken, 
When our vows of love were spoken, 
Of your poor heart was a 
token, 
Mollie dear. 
Ah, but our hopes were splendid: 
Mollie dear, 
Mollie dear; 
The primrose flowers were shining, 
Mollie dear, 
When on my breast reclining, 
Mollie dear. 
Began our tre-na-meala, 
And many a 
month did follow 
Of joy—but life is hollow, 
Mollie dear. 
For once when home returning, 
I 
found our cottage burning, 
Around it were the yeomen 
Of every ill and omen, 
The country's bitter foemen, 
But why arose a 
morrow, 
Upon that night of sorrow, 
Far better by thee lying, 
Their bayonets defying, 
Than live an exile sighing, 
Mollie dear, 
Mollie dear. 
Mollie dear. 
Mollie dear. 
Mollie dear ? 
Mollie dear.

IkITAAT 
T HREE years ago this very day 
We went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon. 
In tru3 military style. 
Seventeen American dollars 
Each month we surely get 
For to carry a 
gun and bagnetts 
With a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going 
To the army or to jail; 
Or its up the Hudson river 
With a " copper " take a 
sail; 
Oh, we puckered up our courage, 
Wid bravery we did go; 
Oh, we cursed the day we went away 
Win the Regular Army 0 ! 
CHORUS. 
There was Sergeant John McCaffery 
And Captain Donahue; 
Oh, they make us march and toe the mark, 
In gallant Company " Q." 
Oh, the drums would roll, upon my soul ; 
This is the style -we'd go 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army 0! 
We wint to Arizony 
For to flo-ht the Injins there ; 
We came near being made bald-headed, 
But they never got our hair; 
We lay among the ditches, 
In the yellow dirty mud, 
And we neNer saw an onion, 
A 
turnip, or a 
spud: 
(1) 
THE REGULAR ARMY 0 I—Continued. 
Oh, we were taken prisoners, 
Conveyed fornist the chafe; 
Oh, he said we'll make an Irish stew, 
The dirty Indian thafe. 
On the telegraphic wire 
We walked to Mexico; 
We blessed the day we skipped away 
From the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've been dry as army herrings, 
And as hungry as a 
iurk; 
Oh, the boys along the street cry out, 
" 
SoET,er, would you work ?" 
We'd ship into the navy 
For to plow the raging sea, 
But cold water sure we couldn't endure, 
'Twould never agree wid me. 
We'll join the politicians, 
Then we know we'll be well fed; 
Oh, we'll sleep no more upon the ground,. 
But in a 
feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, 
They call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes 
For the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, 
And bunions on our toes ; 
For lugain ,, a 
gun in the red hot sun 
Puts freckles on your nose. 
England has its Grenadiers, 
France has its Zoo-zoos, 
The U. S. A. never changes they say, 
But continually wear the blues. 
When we are out upon parade, 
We must have our muskets briglt, 
Or they'll slap us in the guard-house 
To pass away the night 
And whin we want a 
furlough, 
To the Colonel we do go; 
He says, go to bed, and wait till you're dead,

At Judy Callaghan s 
door, sitting upon the paling, 
His love tale he did pour, an c, this is part of his wailing: 
Only say you'll be

Oh, list to wnat I

I've got a ring to wed, some whiskey to make us gaily, 
A 
mattress leather Ied and a 
handsome new ahaiaty. 
Then do say you 11 be Mistre-s Bradla4lian. 
Don't say nay, charming Judy Callagnan. 
I've got an old tom eat, which through one eye is staring, 
I've got a

to ride on, 
A 
saddle and bridle to boot that you may ride astridt: on 
If you'll say you'll he Mistress Brallapan 
Don't say nay, charming Judy Callaghan.

THE GREENHORN. 
Composed and sung by J. H. R YILN. 
A IR.—" We are off to Paddy's Land." 
Wunx first I 
did arrive in the City of New York, 
It's the truth I 
tell, as true as I 
was born ; 
Some thought I 
came from Limerick, 
While others thought from Cork, 
But I'll tell you all what happened this greenhorn, 
From Ireland, Paddy's Land, och hone, och hone. 
CHORUS. 
But I'm happy as a 
king, 
I 
can whistle, dance or sing, 
And old Dublin is the place where I 
was born ; 
Though to fool me some would try, 
Yet that does not me annoy, 
For I 
am a 
sporting young greenhorn. 
When working, what do you think, I 
used to spend my stamps 
in drink, 
But sure I 
was so simple, gay and frisky, 
Some would take me by the hand, 
Saying, Come, boys, he will stand; 
While I 
had the stamps they would help me drink whiskey; 
Och hone, wirras thrue, what I 
tell you. 
But I'm happy, etc. 
But when I 
had no stamps to pay, some friends went back on 
me, 
And left me like a 
crature all forlorn ; 
Then I 
found a 
friend in need would be really one indeed, 
As I 
acted like a 
foolish young greenhorn. 
But I'm happy, etc. 
I 
worked hard for some time till I 
felt quite in my prime, 
So now I 
am done with whiskey or juice corn ; 
In places where I 
used to drink, I've seen each other wink, 
And remark, The Dublin Boy, a 
known greenhorn; 
Hullabaloo, phillaloo, ' pon my sowl it is true. 
But I'm happy, etc. 
And now I'm doing well—faith I'm sending for my girl, 
For, my boys, she loved me when I 
was forlorn; 
I'll make her my happy wife, and love her while I've life; 
She is from Dublin, where you meet a 
smart greenhorn. 
But I'm happy, etc.

beau-ty Prince Tha-dy Cor-ne - lius Mc-Murrough ICY-Toole. 
From the kings of ould Ireland descended am I— 
Though lo* my employment, my lineage is ligh— 
My silks are all worsted—of frieze is my robe, 
A 
spade is my sceptre, a 
football my globe. 
My mother's a 
great McNamara, 
My cousin, " Kill-divil O'Hara,"— 
And my forefathers flourish'd in Tara, 
In the days of King Turlough O'Toole, 
Dame Fortune looks queer, and I 
bask in her frown, 
The son of a 
king I'm scarce worth half-a-crown; 
Our jewels of state were all lost amid strife, 
But Judy's the jewel and crown of my life.

PRINCE THADY O'TOOLE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
• 
Stern poverty's self cannot ' bate us, 
Though fortune continues to chute us, 
And makes all our bread of potatoes— 
Hard fare for the house of O'Toole. 
Of donkies my dad kept an illigent stud, 
But I 
was the favorite prince of the blood— 
I 
don't mane myself with the donkies to class, 
Who makes such a 
bull is himself but an ass. 
For folks who were troubled with phthisie, 
The milk of the donkies for physic, 
(A mighty good thing when one is sick), 
Was sold by,my daddy, O'Toole. 
Great Shelah na, Guirah, and ould Granuwale, 
Though females, fought each in very strong mail, 
And some say the breeches was tacked to the coat, 
While they made smithereens of the spa] peens they smote 
My grandmother's great grand-aunt's sisters 
Were they—(as you'll read in registhers) 
As swordsmen renowned and as fisthers 
Unmatched, but by Turlough O'Toole. 
Last Donnybrook Fair was the day of all days 
When the clan of O'Toole met the spalpeen O'Sheas ; 
O'er the wide-tended field both our armies were spread, 
The pace soon was broken, and many a 
head. 
The Farrel's, the Foys, and O'Fagans, 
O'Flannigans, Rourkes, and O'Ragans— 
All scamper'd like so many pagans 
From the friends of Prince Thady O'Toole. 
Great Murtough McManus, whom few can resist. 
Made a 
mighty good hand of his foot and his fist; 
And Barney O'Brian, and Brian O'Flinn, 
Gave black eyes a-piece to O'Quigley and Quin— 
The Murphys, O'Moores, and OrMaleys, 
Most gallantly twirled their shillalaghs; 
And, back'd by the Hogans and Haleys, 
Supported Prince Thady O'Toole. 
The scrimmage thus ended, away we all went, 
To make ourselves merry in Rafferty's tent— 
Where friends and relations fell out, short and tall, 
But pace I 
restored, for I 
wallop'd 'em all. 
With hearts as light as a 
feather, 
They each seized a 
flowing mether, 
And drank, in the bumper together, 
"Long life to Prince Thady O'Toole."

" THE OULD HATS OF '98." 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND & Co., 547 Broad-
way, New York. 
Price 35 cents. 
Music by A. H OFFMAN 
THESE hats were made in Dublin town 
In the year of ninety-eight, 
And you can see they are still in style, 
For they look both clean and nate; 
These hats are very dear to us, 
Since we left sweet Dublin Bay, 
And the only time you see them out 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We are Irishmen, both heart and hand, 
From far across the say, 
And the only time we wear these hats 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
These hats were worn by heroes bold 
That lived in the Em'rald Isle, 
When O'Connell went to parliament, 
They were then just out in style ; 
They too were worn by dukes and earls, 
For they looked so trim and nate ; 
Three cheers, me boys, for the ould hats 
That were worn in ninety-eight. 
We are Irishmen, etc. 
Oh, when Saint Patrick's day comes on— 
It's the seventeenth of March— 
Then we turn out both brave and stout, 
Everything as stiff as starch ; 
We march along, and sing a 
song, 
Dressed up in green and blue; 
It reminds us of the good ould days 
When the ould hats were new. 
We are Irishmen, etc. 
THE OLD IRISH PEASANT. 
AN OLD MAN CHARACTER SONG. 
Composed and sung by J. IL RYAN. 
Am..—" I 
am Broken Down." 
I 
AM a 
poor old Irish peasant, 
Whose days are nearly gone, 
Yet 1 
have seen days were pleasant, 
But now I 
am left alone; 
I 
once was very happy, 
All with my family, 
But now they are all banishe I 
far, 
Yes, far across the sea. 
CHORUS. 
But now I 
am old and feeble, 
And quite gray is my hair ; 
Although I 
am old my heart is not cold 
Enough yet to despair. 
There was a 
time in Ireland, 
The recollection now I 
bring, 
When our boys they were so joyful, 
And our girls would merrily sing ; 
But now I'm growing old ; 
No such sights as those are seen ; 
Our girls so gay, while the pipers would play, 
Dancing on our village green. 
But not, etc. 
Each day I 
read of Erin, 
And I'm sorry for to see 
That those whom we've trusted 
Do still our cause betray, 
While our true sons they fly from her, 
To foreign parts to roam; 
Ali, it is a 
disgrace to the ancient race 
Such traitors to be known. 
But now, etc.

MURTY CAREY. 
17 
Composed by J. H. RY-kN, and sung by him in the Panorama of Ireland. 
Am.—" Sarah Walker." 
SURE I 
am an Irish boy ; I 
came from sweet Fermoy, 
Where the boys' and girls' hearts are light and airy ; 
'Tis in that little isle so green true fun is to be seen— 
Sure they can't compare with us in Tipperary. 
Since I 
was two days old, I 
often have been toll 
That I 
was christened by one good old Father Leary, 
And the name that I've been called since I 
was two dayl 
Is the rollicking, roving Irish Marty Carey. 
Then hurrah, my Irish boys, that's fond of fun and. noisc; 
There's not from Cork's own town to Tipperary, 
From Wexford to Fermoy, a 
dacent Irish boy 
To equal the roving Irish Marty Carey. 
I 
came over from old Ireland to this great counterie, 
Where I 
find my friends in many occupations ; 
And I'm proud on them to call, for they know me one and al; 
Because they're my own true blood relations. 
So as I 
sing my song, 
name them one by one; 
You'll no: wonder that my heart is light and airy, 
To see some in command of that gallant Fenian band, 
Sure it cheers the hear: of Irish Marty Carey. 
First there's General Burke who from our cause did never 
shirk. 
And Savage, Halpin, Costello, and O'Mahony. 
Ther.'s John Mitchell and Luby too. Kickitam and Martin 
true, 
Poor Mulcahy and bones: John O'Leary. 
Gene'f-als Sheridan and Francis Meagher, who're famed both 
near and far, 
Not forgetting O'Donovan Rossa from Tipperary, 
Allen. Larkin and O'Brien, with our Cuban Martyr, Col. Ryan, 
Stre they're all blood first cousins to Murty Carey. 
KITTY MURPHY. 
Composed by J. H. Itr.a:s.

KATE M URPHY is my name, 
From old Ireland I 
just came, 
And to my friends I've bid adieu; 
Yes, I 
left old Erin's isle, 
But I 
hope I 
will gain a 
smile, 
By the little song I 
am going to sing to you. 
cuonus. 
Shout, girls, shout, and let us be jolly ; 
Hurrah for the land we'll see again; 
May the Yankee flag still wave 
To cheer the free and brave, 
And happy here be all our gallant men. 
I 
to my Micky bid good-bye, 
As the big tear filled his eye, 
When I 
told him I 
was going to cross the sea; 
But I 
promised I'd go back 
TT) sweet Balibi.ack, 
That is, if Micky he could not come here to me. 
Shout, gills, etc. 
I've had a 
letter from abroad, 
In which is stated a 
word. 
And this is what he means to 
Cheer up, my Kitty dear, 
For I 
shortly will be here, 
And then, my coleen, married we will be.

THE TIPPERARY DRUMMER. 
Revised and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
Am.—" Paddy's Wedding." 
W ELL, I'm safe once more and landed on shore, 
As tight and as sound as a 
coldier, oh, 
No music so sweet my ear can greet 
As the noise of a 
fourteen-pounder, oh; 
When honor calls for bullets and balls, 
And my heart is light and airy, oh, 
And my eyes as bright as the stars at night, 
Which shine over sweet Tipperary, oh. 
SPOKEN.— Sweet Tip and the sky over, och, there's where we kill 
the landlords by firing stones at them. 
Yes, boys and girls, I'll be 
after telling you how I 
came to be a 
soldier. 
You see I 
had an 
uncle's first cousin's mother's brother of my own in the army, and 
he happened to be over on our side of the country in the recruiting 
sarvice, so he comes over to myself one fine morning. " Shandy, 
my Tipperary Bochiel,"k.says he, " do you know what I 
do be afther 
thinking 1" " Faix and sure, I 
don't know, uncle," says I, " until 
you be afther telling me." " Well," says he, " I'm thinking you 
are wasting your good looking time here, wherein you might go 
out to the war, and there join a 
respectable society." " Society do 
you call them ?" says I. " Faix and begorra, that's a society sure, 
and you must have the diva's own mortality of money to pay, but 
the divil a 
word you are saying about being kilt at all," says I. 
"Ah, by the husk," says lie, and that's what he called in Irish, 
" 
hold your tongue. 
Kilt," says he, " sure I 
never knew any of 
your family that cared to die more than once at a 
time, and sure 
when you're kilt you'll be done wearing ragged knee-breeches for 
the rest of your life." " Faix, and I 
think you're about half right, 
uncle, 
says I; so lie tipped the right side of the palm of me left 
hand with a 
shilling, and off I 
marched to his— 
CHORUS. 
Arrah, boys, Machree, come join with me, 
For the Russian apes won't harm you, oh; 
Both night and day you are sure of your pay, 
Then hurrah for a 
life in the army, oh. 
To the ship we got, and the day was hot, 
And meself being tired of lushing, oh, 
Says I, " Uncle, och hone, where are you going 7" 
Says he, " We're going down to the Russians, oh ;" 
"Is it a 
fight 7" says I. " Yes," says he, " or die." 
As the ship flew o'er the waves like a 
fairy, oh, 
And when coming near shore every man gave a 
roar 
For the boys of sweet Tipperary, oh. 
SPOREN.—Ah, faix, that's where you'd see the fun in real airn-
est, that's where you'd see heads looking for their bodies, and bod-
ies looking for their heads all at the same time. 
So I 
took it into 
my head to fight three or four dozen of them on my own account, 
(1) 
TITTI TIPPERARY DRUMMER.—Continued. 
and didn't I 
make them run too ? 
Yes, run, but they ran afther 
me. Ah, but when it came to the charge of the 87th Faugh au 
Ballaghs and the 88th Connaught Rangers and the Tipperary Ri-
fles, there wasn't the coat tail of a 
Russian to be seen on the heights 
of Alma in no time. 
So up comes the captain, and says he to me, 
" 
Come here, Shandy Maguire, my Tipperary soldier. 
I 
shall have 
you promoted." But no sooner was the last word d'ut of his 
mouth, than along came a 
ball from the enemy, and the captain 
gave another kind of a 
ball, do you mind, and down he fell like a 
pig 
in a 
fit. " Arrah, murder in turf," says I, " the captain's kilt. 
Ar-
rah, captain, darling," says I, " are you dead ?" 
But he would not 
condescend to answer me, and faix he got so devilish stiff that the 
divil a 
word he'd speak to me, so I 
took him on my shoulder, and 
we carried him off to the trenches, and buried him with all due 
military respect. 
Afther that both countries shook hands and 
made up friends again, and meself got sent home for good conduct. 
But wherever I 
go, I 
can never prevent my Tipperary tongue from 
singing— 
Arrah, boys, etc. 
TITF. 
COT ON THE MOUNTAIN. 
Written and sung by J. II. RYAN. 
Am.—" Original." 
On, farewell to the cot on the mountain, 
And the cradle first rocked me to sleep ; 
Tears are falling from nature's loved fountain, 
While breastino the waves of the deep, 
Though dashed like spray on the billows, 
I 
look up to heaven's blue dome, 
And each light as I 
rest on my pillow, 
I 
pray for the Irishman's home. 
Ali, the clarence is on thee, poor Erin, 
The race of thy true sons is run ; 
Where chieftains have fought for and won thee, 
Like swineherds now bask in the sun ; 
Oh, land of the loveliest sculpture, 
Unmatched wheresoever we roam, 
Thou seemest like a 
dove ' neath the vulture, 
But a 
shadow of the Irishman's home. 
But I've come to the land where there's plenty 
For the strong, but I've left far behind 
The poor souls they no more can plunder ; 
Unsheltered from the bleak winter's wind ; 
But I 
hope the day is returning, 
In grandeur like old ancient Rome, 
When there's no Saxon's foot on old Erin 
But thy sons in each Irishman's home.

THE EMIGRANT'S FAREWELL. 
Written, and sung at the departure scene in the Panorama of Ireland, by 
J. 
II. 
RYAN. 
Ain.—" The Dear Dish Boy." 
Out, Erin, my country, though thousands now leave thee, 
After suffering privations which no tongue can tell, 
To see the pride of my country depart sore does grieve me, 
While their sighs fill the sails as they bid thee farewell; 
Our foes they are smiling while wealth they are piling; 
Our brave boys are toiling by land or by sea; 
Oh, land of great plenty, with barns and stores empty, 
Farewell, dear ould Erin—Acushla Machree. 
Oh, why is my country in sorrow and in danger 7 
You rulers of Ireland can best understand; 
'Tis because all our strongholds are held by the stranger, 
Our houses, our cattle, our farms, and our land, 
While my country's declining far from her proud station, 
That once was the noble, the brave, and the free, 
And the pride of our people still seek emigration, 
Far away from ould Ireland—Acushla -
Machree. 
Though England may boast of her army and navy, 
And her conquests of old, which she ne'er fought alone, 
If a 
war should break out she may want a 
new levy, 
And need those poor exiles she is driving from home ; 
For Irishmen ever in battle none braver, 
They fight like the tiger by land or by sea, 
And in all England's quarrels, who won brioht her laurel'3, 
Faugh an ballagh for irelawl—Acirhia 
THE IRISH VOLUNTEERS. 
Composed and sung by J. II. RYAN in the Panorama of Ireland. 
Respectfully dedicated to the Irish Volunteers. 
Ant.—" The Mulligan Guards." 
I 
caarm your kind attention, 
While I 
sing for you a 
song ; 
Some simple facts I 
will mention 
As I 
proceed along; 
I 
enlisted for a 
soldier, 
Though not for many years, 
To fight the foe where'er I 
go, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
CHORUS. 
Then hip hurrah, and give three hearty cheers, 
To fight John Bull or the great big Russian bear, 
To fight () Ur foes we never showed our fears, 
As we march, march in the Irish Volunteers. 
Our Colonel's name is Murphy, 
lie is a 
native of Tralee; 
He is just the sort for raising sport 
When he goes on a 
spree; 
Sure he gives us lots of whiskey 
To drive away our fears, 
And leathers the foe where'er we go, 
In the Irish Volunteers. 
Then hip hurrrali, etc. 
Arrah, where upon the battle- field 
Were we ever known to run 7 
Not from Fontenoy to the Crimea War, 
Or the battle of Bull Run; 
With a 
loud hurrah for Erin go Bragh 
And three good hearty cheers, 
Our foes we chase if they dare to face 
The Irish Volunteers. 
Then hip hurrah, etc. 
Oh, where are the men upon the earth 
Like those from Ireland ? 
They have proved their worth in fight and sport 
Both by sea and land, 
But I 
hope the day is drawing nigh 
When we will show we have no fears, 
To all unite for Ireland's rights, 
In the Irish Volunteers.' 
Then hip hurrah, etc.

I 
AM an Irish boy as you may see, 
I 
am always happy gay and free; 
I'll tell you of America, 
And the boys who fought in the army; 
So now list to what I 
say, 
And we will tell you right away, 
For I 
mention in my lay 
The boys of the Union Army. 
Blow your bugle, beat your drum, 
For the fighting day has come ; 
It was each Irish mother's son 
Turned out for the Union Army.

March, boys, march, with hearts so light and airy. 
Shout, Boys, shout, for dear old Tipperary ; 
On, boys, on, united yet we'll stand, sir, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for poor old Ireland. 
It was in the year eighteen sixty-one 
The cruel war it first beffun; 
At the first attack upon Bull Run, 
Where they defeated the Union Army ; 
Aye, but in eighteen sixty-four 
Paddy's sons they went once more ; 
It was down the rebel's flag they tore, 
And gave three cheers for Ireland. 
March, boys, etc. 
Then why despise poor Pat, och hone? 
For if be had stopped at home, 
The North would never have her own 
From the rebel army, 
Aye, but they came from near and far 
To fight beneath the stripes and stars, 
When the brave Thomas Francis Meagher 
Was a 
general in the army.

PAT O'HARA. 
A NEW IRISH SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by J. H. 
RYAN, and sung by him in the Panorama of Ireland. 
My name is Pat O'Hara, 
• 
I've come from Conamara; 
I've been round to Tam, 
There some friends to see; 
I'm leaving poor old Erin ; 
The spot to me endearing; 
The troubles were overbearing, 
So, boys, I'm going away. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for Uncle Sam, 
And the boys of Paddy's Land; 
Let us united stand, 
True with heart and hand, 
And should war come again, 
You'll find that Irishmen 
Will stand by the Union for home and liberty. 
(Dance—after dance walk, around.) 
Farewell, old Erin, I 
will leave you ; 
I 
will go over to Columbia's shore; 
But if e'er I 
do come back again, 
Arrab, sure, I 
won't leave old Ireland any more. 
(Repea last line.) 
Och, the boys of poor old Ireland 
On brake, bog or mireland, 
They're so trampled by the tyrant, 
They have to leave their homes; 
But I 
hope the day's returning, 
When our hearts with vengeance burning, 
Well fight on every turning, 
And lay the Saxon low. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
So, my friends, I'll not deceive you, 
As now I'm going to leave you ; 
The ship it is ready and soon will set sail ; 
But 1'11 tell the men of freedom 
That here we greatly need 'em, 
To crush the English tyrant, 
And free old Grannawail. 
Then hurrah, etc.

To cry cead mille foiltha, like an honest Irishman; 
If he wants to drive round Dublin, there's my mare that is well 
bred, 
That will take him down to Irislitown or to the Strawberry-beds. 
Cuo.—Then going to the beds, etc. 
There are scenes and sights round Dublin that are dear to Irish 
hearts; 
What spot like old Glasneven can you find in foreign parts? 
There's Clontarf and famed Donnybrook, where Irishmen have 
bled; 
Besides the hill of Howth and the famous Strawberry-beds.

PADDY CARTY'S WEDDING. 
An answer to " Paddy Carty to his Sweetheart," by the Bard of Armagh. 
Written by M. J. 0'31AHONY (a 
Paddy from Cork). 
A TE.—" 
Paddy O'Rafferty." 
You tould me, Pat Carty, my eyes were the death of you, 
That my smile, like a 
thunder-bolt, knocked out the breath o' you, 
But I 
come with my eyes and my smile for to comfort you, 
And to give you my heart in the old village chapel, too. 
You tould me you'd purchase the best wedding ring for me 
In the town or the country to get, you would bring to me, 
But bring me a 
plain one without any stone, croon, 
On my finger there fix it, and call me your own, aroon. 
That night when they parted they kissed a 
dha vahasa,* 
And each minute an hour it seemed as it passed away, 
Till the curtains of evening were ope'd to the morning's gleam, 
When Biddy and Pat started up from love's golden dream. 
Before the cock crew, Pat was dressed in his Sunday clothes, 
And off for the road where the good old shillaleh grows, 
And a 
sprig in his hat of the sweet little shamrock, 0, 
To welcome his bride on the feast of St. Patrick, 0. 
Up to the church Paddy stepped light and airy, 0, 
No finer young fellow was seen in Tipp'rary, 0, 
From that day to this, and I'm sure no heart bolder, 
To strike for his country, and oft he told Biddy so. 
And scarcely the mass was all over and done, (Wife, 
When, by good Father John, Paddy's work was begun, arue 
And soon after that Biddy Sheehy was tied, ante, 
To brave Paddy Carty, and he to his bride, ante. 
That night to the supper the priest was called over, sure, 
To give them his blessing and join in the fun, galore, 
And scarce was it o'er, when he gave a 
toast freely, 0, 
The health of Pat Carty and Bridget McSheehy, 0. 
Dha Vahasa is Irish for " God save you."

PADDY CARTY'S WEDDING.—Continued. 
And then came the piper and fiddler along, arue, 
While a 
boy of the Murphy's was singing a 
song, arue, 
That the girls of the town had all joined in the chorus, 0, 
Till their throats from the screaming became nearly porous, 0. 
The dancing commenced, and up to gray morning, 0, 
'Twas kept up light and frisky, all care they seemed scorning, 0, 
" 
Shaun Buell," and the " Rocky Roads," " Sheilah na gig," 
ante, 
And " Leather the Divil" were danced in a 
jig, ante. 
From that day to this, in the town of Clonfert, ' tis true, 
That weddin' is kept up with the boys and the girls, arue, 
For when they go courting, they're sure for to say to you, 
Remember Bid Carty and Pat's weddin' day, arue. 
TROY. 
Ain.—" Pat O'Brien." 
WnEN at time age of twenty-three 
I 
landed in New York city, 
And soon found ' twas no place for me, 
A 
simple Irish boy, 
For like a 
simple, foolish lad, 
I 
soon spent every cent I 
had, 
And to leave the city I 
was glad 
On board a 
ship for Troy. 
We started out from New York Bay 
Upon one pleasant Saturday, 
And sure next morn at anchor lay, 
Which filled my heart with joy, 
For no politicians greet you there, 
No corner loafers at you stare, 
Where boys and men act on the square, 
In the little town of Troy. 
No city is so dear to me 
Thoughout the whole big country; 
'Twas here I 
found my wife, you see, 
And she found a 
little boy, 
So I 
invite, friends, one and all, 
The big, the little, great and small, 
The old, the young, the short and tall, 
To visit me in Troy.

BARNEY,

OH! Barney, sweet Barney, was blithsome and merry ; 
We met, where the wild thistle grew ; 
His cheek and his lips were as red as a 
cherry, 
His eye, like his jacket; was blue ; 
And he vow'd that I 
look'd like an angel above, 
And his tongue coax'd so swately, I 
tumbled in love 
Wid Barney, the tight lad of Derry. 
Oh! Barney, the tight lad of Derry ! 
But 0 ! the desaver, he set my heart bating, 
Then whisper'd, " Dear Bridget, good bye ! 
'Deed ! the times are so bad, that abroad I'm retreating, 
My fortune, far off, for to try 
And he kiss'd me, and told me to banish my fears, 
I 
spoke not, but moisten'd the cheek wid my tears, 
Of Barney, the tight lad of Derry. 
Oh ! Barney, the tight lad of Derry ! 
Long years have pass'd by, since I 
parted with Barney, 
And sadly I 
watch ev'ry day ; 
And lovers come coorting, so brimful of blarney, 
But my love is wid him, far away ; 
And should he come back with his heart left behind, 
lie shan't see me weep, for I 
still will be kind, 
To Barney, the tight lad of Derry.

Throw out your chest 
And keep your eyes right,

To the music of the fife ; 
Salute your officers, 
Keep in time,

It was this way we marched all day, 
All in the Badderskites. 
In our regiment we had twenty, 
Fire cannons and one gun, 
In our ba'nd we had a 
clarionet, 
A horn and a

Our fifer had a

And fingered with his thumb, 
When we turned out for miles about, 
You could see the people run.

WHEN ERIN FIRST ROSE. 
Written and sung by the FIELDINGS. 
W HEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, and saw it was good ; 
The Emerald of Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring of the world, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, in her soil, in her station thrice blest, 
With her back towards Britain, and her face to the West 
Erin stands proudly insular, on her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave ; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons, like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A partition of sects, from one foot- stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die. 
Alas ! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green, 
Yet, oh, when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save ; 
Let no feeling of vengeance presume to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men tney are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue, 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair ; 
Their bosoms heave high for the worthy and brave, 
But no cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave ; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise arch of the Ocean and queen of the West.

DEAR OLD IRELAND.

Why do we meet ?

Our vows both night and day 
To dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurra! 
We're not the fortune-favored kind, 
But rugged sons of toil ; 
We've got the muscle and the mind, 
That's sprung from Irish soil ; 
Our toil being done, and night come on, 
We meet to work and pray, 
For dear Old Irel:md, brave Old Ireland— 
Ireland, boys, hurra 
Some left her shores long years ago, 
Some never saw her hills ; 
But for her glory and her woe 
Each faithful bosom thrills. 
We give no cheers, but vow her tears 
Revenge shall wipe away— 
Au ! dear Old Ireland, brave Old Ireland—

And how our fathers died ; 
How creeds divided, where they ought 
To muster side by side.

THE OLD RACE. 
By T. D. a-turas. 
Garryowen." 
FItirrai for the brave old Irish Race 
That fire or sword could not efface; 
That lives and thrives and grows apace 
llowever its foes assail it— 
That point by point, and day by day 
Wins back its rights, and works its way! 
And bursts its bonds—flurra! nurra! 
With a 
hundred cheers we'll hail it ! 
What did those foes to the old race do? 
They wreek'd their countly through and through ; 
They robbed and suipped, and hacked and sIew, 
They hanged, and burned, and drown'd them ; 
But vainly spent wete storm and shock 
On that deathless seed, that living rock— 
The isle is filled with the brave old stock, 
And they've worth and wealth around them t 
When fire and sword had done their parts, 
Then tried these foes their baser arts, 
By dark degrees to change the hearts 
That never won hi yield or falter; 
But now, as in the days of old, 
The Irish heart is native gold, 
Cast in the glorious heaven-made mould, 
No power no earth can alter! 
And if good work is yet undone, 
If rights remain yet to be won, 
As sure as the rising of the Sim, 
'Twill be the same proud story, 
Till ends the strife in Liberty, 
Till stands the race redeemed and free, 
And all the iS!e from sea to sea 
Is one bright field of glory!

OUR OWN GREEN ISLE. 
By T. D. 
SULLIVAN. 
Come, chime a 
song with me, for our own green isle, 
For bright and fair to see is our own green isle, 
And down from times of old, 
As the ages on have rolled, 
There were true hearts, brave and bold, in our own green 
isle. 
To many lands, alight was our own green isle. 
For learning's lamp shone bright hi our own green isle, 
And filled with godlike powers, 
Saint and sage went from the bowers, 
And the abbeys and the towers of our own green isle. 
And when despoiling foes sought our own green isle, 
Our fathers brave arose in our own green isle, 
On valley, hill, and plain 
Fought and bled, and fought again, 
For they brook no foreign chain in our own green isle. 
And when unholy might, in our own green isle, 
Trampled justice, truth, and right in our own green isle. 
Still quick to do and dare 
Were the gallant sons she bare, 
For they never knew despair in our own green isle. 
Then let us all be true to our own green isle, 
Bear our parts as men should do, for our own green isle, 
And ours the bliss shall be 
In the coining years to see 
Peace and joy and liberty in our own green isle.

OUR TOASTS. 
By T. D. 
SULLIVAN. 
Last night three genial frienns with me 
Talked of the times, and soon we thought 
To try the question out if we 
Could do as England says we ought, 
Said one '• Let's toast that rnig,hty land, 
And drink ' confusion to her foes ' "— 
We poured the wine, and glass in band, 
Un 
to our feet at once we rose: 
" 
Success "— but no! 
Our hearts beat slow, 
The words stuck in our throats the while ; 
Then loud we laughed, 
And ere we quaffed, 
Our toast was this—" Our own green Isle!" 
"That time we failed," another said, 
" 
But let us try the task once more, 
And toast the foreign arms that shed 
Our fathers' blood from Shore to shore. 
The knaves ‘yho seized their fair domains 
More oft by fraud than warlik e toil ; 
The clown s who wrecked Oltr ancient fanea, 
And fattened on the sLcred spoil." 
we rose—but no 
Words would not flow_ 
Then grasped we each another's hand, 
And with a 
shout our toast rang out, 
" 
Tho heroes of our native land!" 
Then spoke a 
third---. Let's pass them by, 
Those gloomy years, forever flown, 
And see what winning ways may lie 
I
II later times. On 
our own. 
Coms, let its toast the thousand ills 
That waste our coun try's life away, 
And praise and bless the hand that fills 
Ti 
s 
Isle with grief and woe to day." 
We rose— but no! 
With cheeks aglow, 
Our heart's blood pillsing fast and free, 
We raised each draught, 
And when we quaffed. 
Our toast was •• Ireland's liberty." 
Then of the group one other spoke, 
And said. " Good friends, I 
hold it plain, 
God never made for bond or yoke 
This race so lonz assailed in vain. 
The free bold spirit that He gave 
To cheer their hearts no foe can kill; 
The hope lie set to guide and save 
Our people true, is living still." 
Wn rOgfi—rtild Oh ! 
With cheeks aglow, 
And j 
,, fq1 tears on every face, 
WI th cheer and shont 
0 
ir tol it rang out — 
The finite of tho Irish race!"

Sweet Innisfallen, fare thee well, 
May calm n 
and sunshine long be thine! 
How fair thou art let others tell, 
To /eel how fair shall long be mine. 
Sweet Innisfallen, long shall dwell 
In memory's dream that sunny smile, 
Which o-er thee on that evening fell, 
When first I 
saw thy fairy isle. 
'Twas light, indeed, too blest for one, 
Who had to turn to paths of care— 
Through crowded haunts again to run 
And leave thee bright and silent there; 
No more unto thy shores to come, 
But on the world's rude ocean tost, 
Dream of thee sometimes, as a 
I 
ome 
Of sunshine he had seen and lost. 
Far better in thy weeping hours 
To part from thee, as I 
do now, 
When mist is o'er thy blooming bowers, 
Like sorrow's veil on beauty's brow. 
For, though unrivall'd still thy grace, 
Thou (lost not look, as then, too blest, 
But thus in shadow, seem'st a 
place 
Where erring man might hope to rest— 
Might hope to rest, and find in thee 
A gloom like Eden's on the day 
He left its shade, when every tree. 
Like thine, hung weeping o'er his way. 
Weeping or smiling, lovely isle ! 
And all the lovelier for thy tears— 
For though but rare thy sunny smi.e, 
"fis heav'n's own glance when it appears. 
Like feeling hearts, whose joys are few, 
But, when indeed thy come, .divine— 
The brightest light the sun e'er threw 
Is lifeless to one gleam of thine ?

" 
GOD SAVE IRELAND!" 
AIR :-" Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching." 
High upon the gallows tree 
Swung the noble-hearted three, 
By the vengeful tyrant stricken in their bloom; 
But they met him face to face, 
With the courage of their race, 
And they went, with souls undaunted to their doom. 
"God save Ireland !" said the heroes ; 
" 
God save Ireland!" said they all, 
"Whether on the scaffold high 
"Or the battle-field we die, 
" 
Oh, what matter, when for Erin dear we fall!" 
Girt around with cruel foes, 
Still their spirit proudly rose, 
For they thought of hearts that loved them, far and near; 
Of the millions true and brave 
O'er the ocean's swelling wave, 
And the friemis in Ii oly Ireland ever dear. 
" 
God save Ireland!" said they proudly; 
"God save Ireland !" said they all:

" 
GOD SAVE IRELAND !"—[CoNcLuDED. 
" 
Or the battle-field we die, 
" 
Oh, what matter, when for Erin dear we fall 1" 
Climbed they up the rugged stair, 
Rung their voices out in prayer, 
Then with England's fatal cord around them cast, 
Close beneath the gallows tree, 
Kissed like brothers lovingly, 
True to home, and faith and freedom, to the last. 
"God save Ireland F' prayed they loudly ; 
" 
God save Ireland !" said they all : 
"Whether on the scaffold high 
Or the battle-field we (lie, 
" 
Oh, what matter when for Erin dear we fall !" 
Never till the latest day 
Shall the memory pass away 
Of the gallant lives thus given for our land. 
But on the cause must go, 
Amidst inv. or weal or woe, 
Till we've made our isle a 
nation free and grand. 
"

I AM AN IRISHMAN. 
LET them talk of rationalities, about their nationalities, 
And other specialties to praise them if they can, 
But attention give for charity, and I 
without disparity 
Will introduce a 
rarity, for novelly is my plan ; 
If you wish for pure philanthropy, which all should seek to scan, 
D.vested of licanthropy, which is a 
wolfi Ii plan, 
Look not for the Venetian, then, nor seek for the Parisian, then, 
But take the bold Milesian, then, and that's an Irishman ! 
CLIORITS. 
Then here's success to Paddy's land, where I 
was born, that's 
thady's land— 
In troth it was my daddy's land, for I'm an Irishman ! 
We ne'er feel melancholy, but let all grieving folly flee, 
And take our whiskey jollily when get it sure we can; 
Here's potheen I 
will wager, sirs, that's never seen a 
guager, sirs, 
Take the word of an old starxer, sirs, and he's an Irishman. 
Whether Wicklow is your native place, or born in famed Tip-
perary, 
Take that and you need never fear leperacharm or fairy; 
At the pattern you can lead the van when the skirmish has 
began, 
And show them your shillaleh plan if you're an Irishman 
Then here's success, etc. 
Now there's one great truth beyond a 
doubt, St. Patrick turned 
the vipers out, • 
But he did not tu-n the pipers out, who to play so lovely can, 
" 
St Patrick's day," or " Kiss the Cook," " The Rocky Road," 
" 
The So -rarth's Book," 
And the merry jiff of Donnybrook that Shelah danced with Dan. 
The old For-hunter's ji?- likewise, and Jackson's morning dream, 
They fall as gently on the ear as Liffey's murmorin,g stream ; 
To see the boys the chanter span to tunes composed carolan, 
Naught better since the world began deliobts an Irishman ! 
Then here's success,' etc. 
Then drink unto that island green, that long the wide world's 
pride Ins been ; 
'Tis poor old Ireland that I 
mean, may she never know a 
ban, 
For her daughters they as lovely are as is ihe brightly shining 
star, 
That o'er Dublin, Cork, or Mulliwiar, delights an Irishman ! 
May the shamrock, rcse and thistle by 110 tyranny be o'erran, 
But all unite together for to form one solid clan ; 
May hospitality dwell in our land, and poverty fly from the 
strand, 
And plenty be at the command of Crory honest man 
Thera hero's suCceSs, etc. 
POOR OLD MOLLOY. 
I 
WAS born and reared in Galway near fifty years ago, 
But the man and times are changed since then, 
But that you all well know. 
I've had my share of ups and downs where the blooming sham-
rocks grow— 
A 
poor worn out old harvest man, I 
hear them all say so ! 
Poor Old Molloy! 
CITORUS. 
But of course I'm growing old, and my hair is turning gray, 
A 
poor worn out old harvest man, I 
hear the Colleens say, 
Poor Old Molloy! 
Poor Old Molloy ! 
I 
was as tight a 
harvest man as stood on Irish ground, 
And at boxing with a 
good blackthorn I 
never was knocked 
down; 
At wrestling or at foot-ball I 
took the prize away, 
And now I'm getting rusty, I 
bear the gossoons say— 
Poor Old Molloy. 
But of course, etc. 
Eighteen or twenty years ago I 
was a 
rakish boy, 
And the devil a 
one could please the girls to equal Pat Molloy ; 
I 
was all their daddy's at a 
fair, or on St. Patrick's Day, 
But now my shamrock's fading fast, and I 
hear the colleens say 
Poor Old Molloy! 
But of course, etc. 
The African loves the soil where it first gave him breath, 
And like a 
true born Irishman I'll love mine until death ; 
And when the sods of Paddy's Land grows o'er me in the clay, 
You can drink success to Granur-ail, but don't forget to say— 
Pdar Old Molloy! 
tut of Ours°, etc.

THE DANCING IRISHMAN. 
I'm Pat Molloy, the Irish boy, I'm always funny when full of 
money— 
I'm the boy to take your taste; 
Come now, my lads, I'm singing right bowl(' and frisky, 
And don't you think that Pat with good sense he is graced; 
I'll tell you how to sing— tip you all an Irish fling— 
Then hold your tongues to me, for I'm the dancing king. 
cnont:s. 
I'll dance in spite of blarney, and I'll shake the heel and toe; 
Prn happy though I 
warn ye that I'll dance and off I 
go. 
The best of ways in our young days is whiskey tippling, all clear 
and rippling— 
Potheen's the Irish joy ! 
Though drunken men I'm blaming too full of whiskey— 
Now don't think that Pat is still an Irish boy ; 
I'll sing and talk sublime, tip ye, too, the Moore-ish rhyme, 
The lays of Paddy's land, for I'm a 
singer grand ! 
ril dance in spite of blarney, etc. 
The girls I 
love, and they approve of my country system—that'a 
when I've kissed them, 
And clasped them to my breast ; 
There's Biddy Lynch O'Leary, she's full of Venus__ 
Now don't you think that I 
can find a 
place of rest— 
On my knee she sits arid smiles, blushes redder than the tiles, 
But then her kiss is sweet—bedad, she thinks me great. 
I'll dance in spite of blarney, etc. 
When we are wed there'll be a 
bed—I 
cannot doubt it—can't be 
without it ; 
And when the stocking's thrown, 
I 
hope, my boys, all love will ao to fortune, 
And prove Molloy a 
man—no more I'll say, Och hone! 
The blackthorn I 
will take—no sculldragging we will make, 
But blarney, stop! you see, for Bid and my own sake. 
I'll dance in spite of blarney, etc.

THE FLOWER OF MACKFIRALLY, 
OH ! 
A CHARACTERISTIC IRISH BALLAD. 
'TWAS one fine summer's morning, 
When flowers they were a- blooming, oh! 
Meadows were adorning, and small 
Birds sweetly singing, oh ! 
I 
met my love near Bambridge, 
'Twas my charming, blue-eyed Sally, oh! 
And she is the beauty of the County Down, 
And the flower of Mackerally, oh ! 
With admiration I 
did gaze, 
Upon this blooming maiden, oh! 
Adam was never more struck 
When he first saw Eve in Eden, oh! 
Her skin was like the lily while, 
That blooms in yonder valley, oh ! 
And I 
think I 
am blessed when night 
To the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
Her yellow hair, in ringlets fair, 
Her shoes were Spanish leather, oh! 
Her bonnet with blue ribbons strung, 
And her scarlet scarf and feather, oh! 
Like a 
Venus bright she did appear, 
Did my charming, blue-eyed Sally, oh!. 
And she's the girl that I 
love dear, 
And the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
An Irish lad although I 
be, 
have neither wealth nor treasure, oh ! 
Yet I 
love my dearest dear--
I 
love her beyond measure, oh ! 
If I 
bad all the wealth that is possessed, 
Arrah ! by the great Mackerally, oh! 
I 
would give it to her I 
love best, 
She's the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
But I 
hope the time will surely come, 
When we'll join hands together, oh! 
It's then I'll take my darling home, 
In spite of wind and weather, oh! 
But let them all say what they will, 
Yes, let them scheme and rally, olf:i 
For I 
shall take my darling home, 
She's the flower of Mackerally, oh!

THE L IT TLE HIBERNIAIT H A RP. 
W ritten and couiposr.4by iSA:d BAGNLI.L. 
An! well I 
remember, one frosty December, 
The winds whistled cold, and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her lace, 
I 
thouo-ht it my duty to watch that young beauty, 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sighs, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes; 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying, 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow, 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden, 
Who stood like a statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, etc. 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
Who stood so forlort, in the streets for a 
while, 
IIer sobs wrung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle: 
My parents are dead, and I 
wander dejected, 
in search of a boy that I 
love and adore; 
He's long, since departed from me broken-hearted, 
And I 
am alone far from Erin's green shore. 
The wind whistled, etc. 
Need I 
say I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her, 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's oreen shore, 
I 
watched her on deck till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out front my sight, and I 
saw her no more; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire, 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp 
I 
think of the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkled the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled, etc.
