Bent My Gun a Circle
BENT MY GUN A CIRCLE 5121 A2
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
Get up early one morning A hunting for to go The trees was in full blossom And a cheerful
strata of snow.
Well, I bent my gun a circle To shoot around a hill And out of ten or twenty bucks, Ten
thousand I did kill.
I followed than to the water's edge Where all the rent went in And there they was so thick
and fat They couldn't hardly swim.
I taken both six-shooters And under water went To kill the biggest fattest buck, It was my
heart's content.
While I was under water A thousand feet or more I let off both six-shooters Like cannons
they did roar.
Out of my hard shooting Perhaps it's I killed one The rest turned up their bristles And at me
they did run.
