Oh, I

A cocktail or gin fizz,

To provide for me mother through life.

Be gave up his table to ate of their bread,

Was her bouncing big soft feather bed.

All slept on the bouncing big down feather bed. 
When the ship Idaho come over, you know, 
Me husband end me anyhow, 
Took passage outright in the dead of the night, 
And anchored ourselves on the bow. 
The rooms they were jumbled, the ocean was tutn-

Sick of the sea and, begorra. half fed, 
The ocean kept roaring, but I

In all sorts of weather I'd shako up the feathers 
That mother herself she did pluck, 
She stuffed the old tick. ' twas herself had the kniok 
To trim off a 
turkey or duck. 
It never was lumpy to make your back humpy, 
No bolster you'd need for to tuck up your head, 
When I would get dozy I'd lay down so cozy, 
And sleep in the bouncing big down feather bed.

I'll tell you what to do: 
You must buy a bran new silk high hat, a 
pair of 
patent leather boots, 
And a 
necktie that's too-too. 
You must wear a 
flowing ulster, and say that you're 
from Munster, 
And walk off eating quick, 
in your pocket carry a 
billy, in your buttonhole a 
lily, 
And they'll call you the testlietic Mick.

THE BELLS. 
Written, composed, and sang by Dalt KM 
When I 
was single how 
I 
long'd to gain a 
loving wife, 
And never tho't that one could be 
The cause of noise or strife, 
I 
used to think them angels quite, 
I 
fancied they were saints, 
I 
used to think them Venuses 
Without the aid of paints. 
SPOKEN. — When I 
was single how I 
used to envy 
the married men, and how the married mr.n must 
have been envying me at the same time. 
At last I 
summoned up courage and went for wedded bliss(?). 
The lady was found, the morning arrived, the deed 
was done, and as we left the church— 
CHORUS. 
The bells they rang merrily ding, dine, dong, 
I 
fancied they said " there's another gone wrong 
And the people titter'd while passing along 
And said " take that poor fellow home." 
My darling cried " Oh, heed them not 
A low and vulgar set," 
Said I " I'm well pleased with my lot 
I've no cause for regret." 
Alas! I 
soon recalled my words, 
I 
cry as now I 
roam, 
" 
Oh! why did I 
get married? 
Why did I 
leave my happy home?" 
SPOICEN. — Why did I 
leave the home where I 
NVIS 
free to do as I 
liked? 
There if I 
did not feel inclined 
to eat my crusts, 1 
was allowed to place them under 
the tea-tray, which I 
considered was " tray bang* 
(Tres bien). 
Now if I 
don't eat my crusts, she places 
my crusts under the tea-tray, and you can very often 
hear the " tray bang." The consequence is I 
often 
have an optical delusion of about five hundred stars, 
and an auricular delusion of the same number— 
Of bells ringing merrily, etc. 
13 
THE BELLS.. 
(Concluded.) 
I 
rise each morning at six o'clock, 
Because it's her desire, 
And minus trousers, socks, or shoes, 
I 
light the kitchen fire. 
I 
wait upon her hand and foot, 
But if I 
out should be, 
And get home rather late at night, 
She kindly waits on me, 
SPOKEN. — With a big stick; of course it's very' 
kind of her to sit up for me; it's very kind of her to 
open the door for me; but when she carries hex-
kindness to the extent of prostmting rue on the one 
and eleven-penny door-mat, then 1 
faLl to see the. 
joke. 
I 
never attempt to rise; if I 
did it would only-
necessitate her knocking me down again, so I 
gen-
erally tie myself up in a 
knot, go to sleep, perchance 
lAo dream, to dream of the day when— 
The bells they rang, etc. 
I 
cannot do a 
thing aright, 
I 
cannot speak correct, 
And if I 
stoop I'm c,a11d " a 
frie.1.*.i* 
Yet must not stand erect. 
I 
often wish that I 
were dead, 
Or never had been boil), 
Or never had been mar ri-ed, 
On that unlucky morn. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
get low-spiritPd I 
generally go=, 
to the little church around the John Burner. Es-
quire, and there I 
behold ' two more on em " going 
in; at least. I 
suppose there are two.

he, poor fellow, is hidden somewhere in the folds of 
her dress, ready to be dragged forth when Dequired. 
When the deed is done, the mournful procession, 
wends its -.
vay into the aisle. he, happy nica-tal, look-
ing as cheerful as if he had taken a dose of rat pa-
son, she looking gay and festive, as much as to Fan,

Long may you live, my noble gray,

IS 
THE CUE FOR THE CURTAIN. 
A poem written by FRANK W RIGHT, of Shelby's Theatre, 
Buffalo, New York, and recited by Lorna & 
THOMAS W INNETT, the popular favorites. 
:For many a 
year he had stood, true as steel, 
At his desk in the the theater's prompt-stand. • 
His hair white as snow in the service had grown, 
To thousands he'd lent a 
helping hand. 
At rehearsals, 01(1 Jimmie (he was so nick- named, 
Was attention—all smiles' not a 
frovna,1A( 
-Watching entrance and exit, while marking his book, 
For the cue the green baize to ring down. 
Young aspirants longing for histrionic fame 
Oft depended on Jimmie's quick ear; 
He'd throw them a 
line, when lost in their part, 
So none of the audience could hear. 
'Unseen, attentively each artist he watched, 
Whether leading man, beilarY,' or clown; 
And at each cue or trick, like the plot which he held, 
his bell rang the drop- curtain down. 
Not much of an actor; responsible, though; 
And if any time they were short 
For a 
second old man, or a 
character " bit," 
The manager always " Jim " sought. 
He'd play it, not brilliantly, let it be said, 
(You're gone from us now, poor Jim Brown;) 
But no matter what it was, he'd be off the stage, 
And watch for the cue to ring down. 
40ne night—it was Hamlet, 1 
think, that they played— 
Everything had gone smoothly and well; 
The cue for the curtain was spoken loud twice, 
But silent hung Jimmie's prompt bell. 
In amazement the actors rushed wild from the stage, 
Regardless of buskin or gown, 
To see, and inquire the cause of delay 
From Jim, why the drop wasn't down. 
In a 
heap by the desk poor old Jimmie laid, 
His hands clasping upward to hold, 
The bell-handle which, for twenty years past, 
He had rung at his post, true as gold. 
Paralysis struck him. 
His face, though in death, 
As in life, wore a 
smile, not a 
frown. 
'The angel of death had stuck his hand forth, 
And poor Jim's life-curtain rang down.

A box of old sea biscuits, by chance we found afloat; 
All tempest toss'd, with compass lost, we had no time

DAVY'S PROMISE, OR I 
MUST BE THERE ON 
NEW YEAR'S DAY. 
Concluded. 
'" Your mother dead, your father, Davy, where is he?" 
" 
Don't ask me, please. 
Father's dead, but not like mother, 
dead to me. 
Seven years ago, so mother said, be done some deed for 
which he Red; _ 
Now mother lies beside''the old church where we used to 
play, 
And before she died Lipromised I 
would always come on New 
Year's day." 
t' 
" 
Brave little lad, you shall not break your promise with the 
dead; 
Go, visit her, and may God pour choice blessings on your 
head, 
And always hold her memory dear; though far away, she is 
ever near 
To watch and guard you on your way; 
Remember her holy love, and keep your word on New Year's 
Day." 
" 
Dover Creek!" the brakeman shouts, in voice both loud 
and clear. 
Box on back, off on the track jumps the boy with the golden 
hair. 
And there he stands with the bitter past, just as the old year 
breathes its last. 
And a 
moment more and he is at the gate of the churchyard 
old and gray. 
" 
Oh. mother dear, I 
am not too late; I 
said I'd come on New 
Year's day." 
Long years have passed since that cold morn when the lad 
with hair of gold 
Came plodding along with box on back; and shivering from 
the cold; 
And many a new grave has been made in the churchyard 
where his mother's laid. 
Old age has bent his form a-low—he will be eighty-five in 
May; 
And at his mother's grave, in rain or snow, he asks her bless-
ing on New Year's day.

DAVY'S PROMISE, OR I 
MUST BE THERE ON 
NEW YEAR'S DAY. 
RECITATION. 
Written by CON. T. 
MURPHY. 
Recited by JOHN W ILLS of the Novelty Four. 
Trudging along at early dawn on a 
cold December morn— 
That on which the old year dies and before the new is born— 
Came a 
gentle youth, with hair of gold, shivering from the 
bitter cold, 
With shoekss feet and box on back, the switchman heard him 
say— 
"I will not give up, for there is the track, and I 
said I'd come 
on New Year's day. $ 
" 
All aboard!" The train moves off with its load of human 
freight, 
And a 
moment more and the little lad with box would be too 
late; 
But on the platform, with firm bold, stands the shivering lad 
with hair of gold. 
" 
Come, come, my lad, I 
want my fare." 
"I got no money, sir, to pay, and I 
cannot walk no more, and. 
I 
must be there, 
For I 
said I'd come on New Year's day." 
" 
You must be there! 
What's that to me? I 
have heard such 
tales before; 
I 
want my fare. 
It's- very cold—come in and shut the door. 
Where do you wish to go, my lad? .You got no money, well, 
that's too bad!" 
" 
I 
want to go to Dover's Creek, but that's so very far away, 
I 
couldn't walk it in a 
week, and I 
must be there on New 
Year's day." 
Sit down, my lad—come closer still; I 
am sure you must be 
cold. 
Blacking boots, is that your trade? 
You can't be ten years 
old! 
Your name, what might it be? to Dover? Whom do you go to 
see?" 
" 
The bootblacks call me little Dave; I 
will be ten years old 
in May. 
I 
go to see my mother's grave, and I 
must be _ there on New 
Year's day."

Sung by BAZ.I.RN & HART in their original sketch 4 Over the StIle5.• 
Silver starts are shining bright, 
Softly beams the moon to-night; 
Silver breezes blowing clear. 
Tells me my love Willie is near. 
Thanks to the stars that fondly shine, 
They keep the secrets of Willie and I; 
They are the ones alone that can tell 
How oft Pm waiting for Will. 
CHORUS. 
When in the eve birds build their neots, 
When from its labor the world is at rest, 
When the sweet hour chimes on the bell. 
Down by the river I'm waiting for Will. 
The moon shining bright. the wind blowing slight, 
No one is near when we're telling our love. 
Oh, how myleart beats, when he repeats, 
`• Be mine, forever, my sweet turtle dove." 
One little kiss, then soon we depart, 
One lingering look of rapture and love, 
One little sigh joy does impart, 
Tells me he loves me all others above.

I 
like to see round me some jolly good chums, 
Who earelesdy laugh at each trouble that comes, 
With hearts that are true when their friendship you 
try, 
And are good for a 
jolly few hours to cry: 
CHORUS. 
Encore, encore! we'll have one glass more, 
Encore, encore! we must have one more; 
Encore, encore! and then an revoir, 
And we'll all go sailing home. 
Some sing loud the praises of cheap foreign wine, 
But no—not for me—I 
must " beg to decline." 
The right, proper drink for a 
true jolly dog 
Is a 
stiff, steaming glass of good English grog. 
Encore, encore, etc. 
For those who'd be merry, I 
know of a Den," 
Where always are found merry, good, solid men; 
Who admire good fellowship, love a 
sweet lass, 
And pray their devotions to many a 
glass. 
Encore, encore, etc. 
Tho' many a 
glass to the lips there may rise, 
We remember the maxim of " Merry and wise;" 
Not one who's a 
nose that's inclined to be red, 
Not one but what knows how to climb into bed.

In a

When taking her away, 1 
could hear the neighbors

"Whatfl picnic in his yard there'll be at night." 
But 1

To make love around the sheds and catch the rat.si

When told to go away.

Yell till you burst a

But he only nods and chins to the monk 
in his own sweet native tongue. 
Firmly I've made up my mind, 
As he grinds so fast, 
That the organ will never grind 
if it's hit with a 
brick when passed. 
For the organ will never grind 
if it's hit with a

How the boarders shout, hurrah! to the dining room,

The proprietor looks pale and sick, as they all sit

Although, looking, he cannot tell which one Iii*. 
board will beat. 
Here! pass that onion butter, one of the boarders, 
said. 
The mill cannot grind if I 
don't get any bread. 
What a 
hard and hungry lot those boarders seem to be 
How they grasp and gormandize everything they see. 
They were never known to stop, unless they had 
their fill. 
After coming back again_to that corn beef mill. 
Truly speaks the lanflord, my clothes are fading fat. 
I cannot wash my ulster with the water that has

When my Mary Jane's my wife. 
Purest, sweetest love is ours, 
How happy -we will be,

THE MAN THAT WROTE PINAFORE. 
itTfrftten by Jim CAltrurtn and sung with great success by rAce,rxn, 
nustl. 
I 
am a 
man that's known far and near, 
I 
have a 
daughter, to nie she is dear, 
But late I 
have noticed she acts rather queer, • 
Since she saw the play called " Pinafore." 
It was last night a young man gave liar a 
call, 
And took her to a 
show in our big City Hall; 
She came home that night and began for to bawl, 
With terrible, horrible roar. 
Crrontra 
If I 
catch the man that wrote " Pinafore," 
rn break his jaw, knock him down on. the floor, 
1-k.V. wish he'd married his mother in-law, 
Lefore he wrote hardly ever. 
She's singing from daylight till darkness appears, 
When she goes to bed and snores through her ears. 
I 
often had wished she'd sleep for ten years, 
And forget all about "• Pinafore." 
he thinks she is Butterenp dressed up In blue, 
pia Deadeye, the sailor, she is going to pursue 
fAres, the deep waters that rages so blue, 
With a 
terrible, horrible roar.

NOBODY'S MULE. 
The mule seemed pensive, even sad, 
As if by conseience pricked; 
Vat when they came to share his woebi 
Ile raised objections—kicked 
cat came up to sympathize, 
With mew and gentle purr, 
Alas! she got within his reach, 
When—fiddlestrings and fur 
The dog, in pity, neared him to 
Alleviate his care, 
He tried to pass around him once, 
But-- sausage meat and hair. 
And John, the honest farmer boy, 
Who had the beast in charge, 
Tried recklessly to harness him— 
Ills funeral was large. 
Oh, trifling were the causes which 
his flexile leg.4 unfurled, 
And many were the quadrupeds 
That sought another world. 
He never did a 
decent thing, 
lie wasn't worth a 
ducat; -

And then he kicked the bucket.
