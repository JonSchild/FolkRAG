Introductions 
0.00.30 
Born in Beloit, WI, a border town of Illinois and Wisconsin. Went to school 
through high school there: “most of it was Catholic school, so a lot of guilt 
factors! [laughs].” Went to St Mary’s School of Nursing, got RN. Worked at St 
Mary’s for a year, then entered US Air Force, and worked in Air Force for several 
years, based in California. Intended to be a flight nurse with Air Force, but got 
married, and husband was posted overseas to Taiwan in veterinary service, 
inspecting food and meat being sent to troops in Vietnam. Stayed in U.S., and 
husband only saw baby six weeks after her birth. But later, “we had another 
problem and suddenly I was a single mom.” Didn’t go to psych until after 
divorce; had worked in school system, small hospitals in Beloit and California—
most of which was med/surg. After getting back to job at Mendota—the mental 
health institute in Wisconsin—needed benefits; had done student training in psych 
there. “And I felt that a nurse uses psych everyday—it doesn’t matter which 
discipline you’re in. I think you use that psych. So, I felt very comfortable going 
back there and working.” With scholarship, later went back and got BSN at 
Edgewood in Madison. Worked for 20 years with schizophrenics, sex offenders, 
juvenile. Worked in forensics the entire time—i.e., patients who were deemed not 
guilty by reason of mental disease. 
0.04.45 
“Never a dull moment. I went to training for getting CEUs [Continuing Education 
Units]. I still had my California license, so you had to keep up your education. 
Wisconsin didn’t have that, but Wisconsin has a very good healthcare system.” 
0.05.21 
“They all had different personalities, but they all were locked up. We took them 
on town trips, if they had a certain status. But it was very interesting. It didn’t 
matter if they came from a good home or from poverty—the mental health issues 
were the same.” 
0.05.57 
Patients would try to play tricks, “but the mom in me was always looking with the 
eyes in the back of my head.” 
0.06.12 
Worked with all males, “ran groups, did meds—you know, spent a lot of time 
with the guys”. Mendota now all-male, but before it became forensics, an equal 
Page 2 of 7 
 
population of male and female units. Geriatric units were mixed, male and female. 
The adolescent unit was also mixed at one time, but that became a problem, due 
to the combination of mental health and teenage issues. Another unit was focused 
on people who hadn’t committed crimes, as an emergency detention for people 
deemed a danger to self or others; that was also co-ed. But these were under a 
great deal of observation, so didn’t have the same problems. 
0.08.06 
“But the personalities and the crimes and reading their backgrounds, was just 
unbelievable. Some of them, you wondered how they survived. In the ‘90s, you’d 
have kids with fetal alcohol syndrome or cocaine in their bloodstream. So, they 
were very violent. And the ‘80s, a law was passed that the patient could refuse 
treatment … We couldn’t force them to take medication, unless we went back to 
get a court procedure, and then we could give them IMs—inter-muscular shots.” 
0.09.26 
“I saw a lot of changes in medications. And a lot of the new ones had a lot of 
horrible side-effects. And they wouldn’t want to take it after a while, because of 
the side-effects. And you can’t blame them. The young kids were developing 
breasts because of the hormones in the medication, and many would develop 
diabetes … You can’t blame them, but then they would become violent and have 
to go back to maximum security ... But it was so sad to see those young men who 
had been starting to show a lot of progress and then went off their meds and went 
backwards, and they never really got back to where they were.” 
0.10.58 
“But we did discharge a lot too. That was great. Probably a fourth or an eighth … 
but they didn’t have a lot of resources, and they would be back. And for some of 
them it was a comfort to be there, because in their life they had never been secure. 
So that really was an issue as well.” 
0.11.26 
Worked mostly with medium security. Maximum security was typically for 
adults, but there was a maximum-security unit also for teenagers. Sometime in the 
late ‘90s, another unit elsewhere was closed and these 14-19 year olds were 
transferred to a new unit in Mendota. “But they were kids really. And their 
histories too—they didn’t know their mother, they had no idea who their father 
was, and their grandmothers were the ones taking care of them. And then as we 
got further into the century, the grandmothers weren’t around too, and they were 
just on the streets. And you can’t learn [in that situation]: you’re hearing voices, 
you get into gangs … and it’s just sad.” 
0.13.18 
The youngest children were 3. “These kids, they had been severely abused either 
by their parents or friend of their parents or friend of the family or someone on the 
streets.” One girl, 3 years old, had to have a staff member constantly with her, 
because she would try to molest other children, “because that’s all she had ever 
known.” 
0.13.59 
On dealing with this kind of situation: “When I worked with some of those adults, 
it was kind of against my morals—these guys are kind of getting off from their 
terrible crimes. But I thought, ‘I’m keeping them here and healthy and see if they 
try to develop some morals. And I’m keeping them off the streets, so they don’t 
harm somebody else.’ And that’s how I dealt with it.” 
0.14.41 
“But it was kind of rewarding too, because there were times that a lot of them 
would come up and thank the staff if they thought they were being treated fairly 
or whatever. They knew the difference. They had a law card available, and some 
Page 3 of 7 
 
of them would be looking up the laws and they knew everything. Some of them 
were pretty darn smart.” 
0.15.27 
There was education in the institutions; many got GEDs and some could take 
college classes. Patients also got jobs and had a paycheck and were observed just 
as if it was a job in the community. “And that was really good for them too, you 
know, the structure.” 
0.16.12 
“Usually one nurse and then a head nurse, the unit manager they were called, 
usually an RN. And then, depending on the unit, there were three to five aides. 
And sometimes you’d get an LPN. But only one RN on a unit at a time. The units 
were maybe 25 people in it at the most. We had an outside patio, so you could 
always take them out there, picnics in the summer all the time. They had access to 
a gym, so they played basketball and volleyball and all that. There was a lot of 
structure so they could get some energy out! [laughs] 
0.17.27 
Felt that it was like a little community, with a school and church, and access to a 
chaplain at any time. Felt that many had a variety of issues—both psychological 
and family. And patients had access to a phone. 
0.18.19 
On memorable rewarding experiences: “There was one kid, he had killed his 
family—two sisters, his mother and father. He was probably maybe 17. And he 
was so remorseful. And they all had a treatment plan that we had to go over with 
them every week. So, I put it into his treatment plan that he was going to take one 
class and pass it … And he got to the point that he was able to take classes at the 
tech school in town. And he finished his schooling and got to get out and stay out. 
And another one—some of these guys couldn’t read. And I would have them sit 
and read with me. And they were so excited when they could read a whole 
paragraph. And it made me feel good. And it made them feel good. That didn’t 
mean they wouldn’t get mad at you three days later. But you know … They were 
doing things that other kids would normally do, but they might be 45 years old. 
People don’t realize the history behind these people, and I think it’s so 
important.” 
0.20.18 
“We also had the health nurse was very into helping staff, because we did have a 
lot of physical injuries and fights and things like that—we developed a program 
called SAFE, a group of first responders who were trained.” This program would 
help those injured at work and follow up after injury; interviewee felt this was “so 
important” for staff. 
0.21.20 
On injuries at work: “One time we had a kid who was suicidal, and he was in 
restraints. And every hour we would go in and exercise the limbs. And I had just 
done his leg and I thought someone had gotten this one back to being restrained. 
But oh no—he just went ‘Whfffft’ and I hit the wall and saw stars. So, I was off 
for a while after that. But I never had any major injury. There were people that 
weren’t able to return—back injuries or broken bones or broken jaws. But for the 
most part—and the guys that went off like that, they were very sick, and 
everybody, you know, knew that. We had some suicides. I was thankfully never 
on when anybody did it. Every once in a while you’d have one. They’d be very 
tricky and methodical; they’d be so depressed. We had one guy that plucked his 
eye out … so sad. And right now, you hear all these cop shootings and issues that 
are going on in the community. These people aren’t getting services. You fix a 
Page 4 of 7 
 
broken leg. But because when you look at a person you can’t see that they’re 
having mental issues. And it takes a lot of practice and training to be able to 
respond to people like that in a calm way. You don’t have to shoot ‘em all … And 
I’m not saying the cops are bad. They don’t know the background of these people. 
We knew the background. And we could try to talk ‘em down. And you’re not 
always successful with that. But someone comes at you with a knife or a gun, it’s 
human instinct. And we have to do better with education in the community.” 
0.24.52 
On learning these skills: “I think it’s kind of a combination [of innateness and 
training]. My initial training was hands-on, and we did spend three months at 
Mendota.” In this early training, got to practice these things. “And then as you got 
older, being a mom, no matter what you work at, you always have to have some 
kind of inner voice saying, ‘Don’t scream!’ [laughs] But I think compassion was 
something I learned from my parents and my teachers that I had. I think that’s part 
of it. I’m very fortunate to have a lot of friends, and I think that helps too, because 
I could vent a lot and not have to keep it all in.” 
0.26.23 
Was also able to get together and vent and keep each other happy. “We tried to 
have a sense of humor. And I know it’s terrible—you know, gallows humor was 
rampant. I remember one of the social workers and myself were running a humor 
group, and they were all schizophrenic patients. And we thought we were so 
funny, and they were sitting there with a poker face. And they didn’t have that 
ability to laugh. They couldn’t come up with a joke. And that was sad! … It was 
really an eye-opener for us—they just didn’t get it; they just didn’t have that 
capability. So that was interesting. But yes, the nurses, all the people that worked 
on the units, we all had each other’s backs, because you never knew what was 
going to happen. And after an incident, we always tried to defuse by sitting and 
talking what went well, what worked and what didn’t.” 
0.28.47 
Most nurses moved around, but interviewee stayed in forensics, working 5 years 
on one unit and 7 units on another. “If you felt you were getting burned out, you 
had the opportunity to go to a different type of unit. Working with geriatrics was 
fun. But the most injuries was with the geriatrics unit, because they didn’t 
understand. And they wanted to get their car and go there and do this.” This was a 
non-forensic unit, some with dementia, some with brain injuries, some couldn’t 
live alone anymore and couldn’t tolerate being in a nursing home, because they 
were too aggressive. 
0.29.49   
On changes in care at Mendota: “When I was there as a student, in the 60s, they 
were still doing electric shock treatments for depression. Now they don’t do there 
anymore—they do at some private hospitals in town—it’s not used so much 
anymore … And they would put them in big tubs in the basement, when I was a 
student, and they would put them in cold water. It wasn’t anything like that 
movie. But they were giving them insulin sometimes.” The medications were 
older. “And when I went back 20 years later, new medications were coming out. 
And they did see some success. But the side-effects were so horrible. And they’re 
still using some of them. But not at the same dosage. The dosage came down … 
[Restraints] are very rare. They still block them in a room called seclusion, but 
even now that’s not happening half as much. That’s really been curtailed as well.” 
“The major change that I saw was when the patients could refuse treatment. 
Page 5 of 7 
 
Because they were there because they supposedly couldn’t make decisions. 
You’re telling them they’re there because they can’t make decisions, but now 
you’re telling them that they can refuse treatment. So that changed a lot. And I 
think it became more dangerous.” 
0.34.19 
First impressions of place and atmosphere: “When I first went there … I had 
never been on a forensic unit with the grille gates and carrying big keys and all 
that kind of stuff. The max side, I interviewed over there and on the medium side. 
And I went over the max side and, oh my gosh, these patients were more unkempt 
because they were sicker. And the staff didn’t seem as friendly, but after I got to 
know ‘em they were great people. But initially I thought—but they had to be 
much more attuned to what was going on, more focused, on the day rooms. On 
the east side, the people were more relaxed, but the patients were not at sick.” 
0.35.44 
There was a nurse’s station, plexiglass, but mostly the door was left open. 
“Sometimes patients would come in and grab a staff, but it was pretty rare.” The 
final unit interviewee worked on had a population of sex offenders, and 
“oftentimes there was only one person left on the unit. I thought, ‘This is not a 
good thing’ but for years they had done that, but they felt that the patients they 
had were so much better that they could be trusted.’ But this arrangement was 
changed after a state survey when staff noted this as a concern. 
0.37.33 
Feels that training has gotten worse. Staff used to be unionized, but since new 
governor, union was taken away, and staff had to take pay cuts to pay for health 
and retirement. “It’s harder now to get people, and the training isn’t the same, 
because the old-timers are all gone—people who had experience.” One reason 
interviewee went to Mendota was because of these benefits—a pension, 
education, schooling. 
0.39.36 
On the hospital school and training: the nursing school was a diploma, with 
classes at Edgewood College for first year, with nursing classes at the school. In 
junior and senior year, had rotations—interviewee went to Mendota for three 
months, as staff with a mentor nurse; also medical, pediatrics, orthopedics. When 
graduated and took the state test, had an RN. But interviewee then went back and 
finished, taking elective classes, to get BSN. This didn’t change nursing license at 
all. St Mary’s nursing school closed in ’76; these no longer exist. In this 
institution, lived in a dorm for three years near the hospital, had all meals there, 
classes there, lived in the hospital. “It was very intensive, and we pretty much 
went all year round for three years. We’d have a couple of weeks off for vacation, 
but most of us would stay and work as aides on the unit to make a little money.” 
This gave a diploma with RN; but this no longer exists. Interviewee thinks that 
“Feds thought that the hospitals were using the students too much as staff … We 
were learning but we were also doing the job! [laughs] But we were learning so 
much. The doctors would tell us so much—we would scrub in and we were doing 
all the tasks.” 
0.43.35 
Madison College, the tech school, is closest to St Mary’s arrangement, 
interviewee thinks. Getting the RN/BSN is not the same, interviewee thinks: 
“that’s just truly college, they spend some time in the units, but they don’t get the 
hands on”; “at the nursing home, we would get graduates from UW and they had 
never put an NG tube [nasogastric tube] down. They just hadn’t done a lot of the 
Page 6 of 7 
 
things that were second nature to us after we graduated. So that’s why then they 
went to the BSN and then a fifth year that was more hands-on … So that was 
another change that I’ve seen over the years.” 
0.45.01 
Many younger students would come through Mendota. An instructor would come 
with them, and they would work on the units and be observed, and staff would tell 
them as much as they could, to understand things.  
0.45.32 
Enjoyed training new nurses. “I taught CPR for 20 years.” 
0.46.10 
Still keep up with old nursing coworkers; a group gets together monthly. “In fact, 
I worked at a nursing home in the ‘80s, and there’s a group of us that still gets 
together once a month for lunch.” 
0.47.01 
On what it takes to get into to psych nursing and enjoy it: “Well, I think they have 
to like people. [laughs] They have to be able to understand that sometimes—it’s a 
long process, whereas if you work in orthopedic and someone comes in and they 
get surgery or a cast, and you see immediate recovery or improvement. But in 
psych, you have to be ready for ups and downs or a longer process, because 
sometimes they don’t leave. And I think you have to tell yourself it’s not because 
of you, it’s not because you’re not doing the right thing. And you give pointers … 
and it’s just like I used to say in CPR, you can’t save everybody. But you can 
make it easier for them, to cope. So, I think that’s a good message for them to 
understand. Because some people think, ‘Oh, psych is nothing but playing cards 
and have them playing all the time.’ But you have to be able to share a little bit of 
yourself to.” 
0.48.53 
On stereotypes about nurses: “Well, I think people don’t understand that you can 
play a game of cards and do a lot of therapy during that process. But just coming 
in and seeing that, you might think, ‘Oh, this looks like a really easy job’—just 
from the outside. I think a lot of new staff don’t understand the volatility. But I 
think once you understand what’s going on, it becomes a lot easier.” 
0.49.53 
A lot of the job is about communication with people and finding different ways to 
do this. 
0.50.12 
On having to get creative with some patients: “Oh yes. We had some really 
interesting games on the unit. One was called ‘Social Security.’ It was about how 
people would respond in different situations. And I would get people who never 
wanted to go to group who would come and want to do that. So, you do have to be 
creative.” Interviewee also kept a bulletin board, so that other people wouldn’t 
have to know that they were reading it but could stand back and look at it; found 
that this surprisingly really worked for some patients. 
0.51.49 
Found that patients were very interested in nature of their medications. Since 
some side-effects weren’t visible, rapport with patient was very important. Felt 
that there was a large team, with a variety of different kind of care being 
provided, and that this is an important difference from work in a hospital. In a 
way, more similar to nursing home ethos. 
0.53.06 
On relationships among different care providers: “Everybody actually kind of 
worked together, because it was a team effort. And we’d have team meetings, and 
every couple months, another team would cover our unit, and we’d have a potluck 
and get some training. We were encouraged to intermingle and get to know each 
Page 7 of 7 
 
other, so you would know the quirks of the people you worked with … And that 
made it easier for the staff and easier for the patients.” 
0.54.09 
Could sometimes be ‘pulled’ to another unit, so that after a while you would have 
experience with different units, especially through ‘forcing’ where you required to 
stay for the next shift. “So, you never knew if you were going home a lot … [This 
happened a lot], it did, it did. More at ‘The Colony,’ for people with a variety of 
health issues.” This is close to Mendota but a different group of clientele; some 
transition of staff between these two institutions. 
0.55.56 
On work-life balance with overtime: found this harder when family was younger, 
but later became easier. Interviewee would often volunteer to preempt ‘forcing’—
“Even though you don’t [have control], you can tell yourself.” 
0.56.44 
“Well, I guess, change is so hard to deal with. And I see a lot of changes in 
healthcare in general. And we’re very fortunate here in Wisconsin to have a 
mental health institute, because most every state has closed them. So, I think we 
should be proud of that. And I hope it never gets shut down, because there’s such 
a need for it. But I think healthcare in general has swung too far this way … We 
need more compassion. We’ve had computers taken. And the nurse comes in and 
asks you some questions, but she’s not looking at you to see that you have tears in 
your eyes or you’re very uncomfortable or something—the assessment part is 
being lost. And I think that was drilled into us in our training in the three-year 
program. So, I guess that’s my addition. And not to be afraid of psych nursing 
either, because it can be rewarding—you can see progress. You interact in 
different ways. You give them medication, but that doesn’t have to be the be-all. 
Because it’s the communication and empathy you develop with people. Because 
people are people no matter what—no matter what their disease, color, sexual 
orientation, anything. And I think that’s a big part of nursing too … I saw staff 
[and students] come in who were very afraid … They were afraid of getting hurt. 
They were afraid they might say something too personal, and the patient would 
have somebody on the outside come to their home or stalk or something. It is kind 
of scary at first, especially when you walk into forensics … There are guards 
sitting at a desk. And then you hear somebody call a code, and everybody’s 
running to that unit, and there’s yelling. You never know what’s going to happen. 
But after you’ve done it a couple of times, you learn ways to protect yourself, so 
no one gets hurt. That is the goal.” 
1.00.41 
On getting acclimated to the environment : “I think I just thought, ‘This is where I 
needed to be’. And so, I could tolerate anything. But, you know, having had that 
experience not with forensic but with mental health as a student, that made it 
easier for me. I kind of knew what was going on, what to expect. And I had very 
good training. It was mostly unit staff who had the classes. They had a lot of 
incidences that they would discuss, so it wasn’t all new to you when you got on 
the unit to work.”
