SUNRISE. 
Quartette sung with great success all over the United States 
by the great 
Novelty Four," in their original Burletta 
Rehearsal in the Parlor. 
The morning sun 
Comes peeping over the hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills. 
SOLO. 
Oh, welcome, bright sun 
From the shadows of night! 
All hail to the sun 
We now crown the king of light, 
Oh, merry warbling birds, 
Happy joyous birds, 
Sing their sweetest songs 
To usher in the day. 
All the earth seems glad; 
Every heart shall bring 
Forth its need of praise 
To Him who made the king, 
The morning sun 
Comes peeping over the hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills, 
Comes peeping over the hills. 
The htlls, the hills, the hills, the—hills.

The .Merry Postillion. 
Sung by Miss Lizzie Hunter of the " Novelty Four," in 
their original burletta, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
I 
am the merry postillion, tra-la tra-la, 
All roads and ways to me are known, tra-la tra-la, 
I 
carry missives to and fro, 
Of tears and sighs and true love too, 
Of true love too, of true love too. 
Still ere the lark is singing, 
My little horn is ringing, tra-la. 
The postillion is near, tra-la, 
Tra-la—tra-la 
tra-la, 
The postillion is near, tra-la. 
I 
am the merry postillion, tra-la, tra-la, 
My horn has e'en the sweetest tune, tra-la tra-la, 
Deep longing lurks in its soft voice, 
My love is far and time is choice, 
My love is far and time is short. 
Still ere the lark is singing, 
My little horn is ringing, tra-la, 
The postillion is near, tra-la, 
Tra-la 
tra-la—tra-la. 
The postillion is near, tra-la.

MY DEAR OLD HOME. 
Sung by the " Novelty Four" in their original Burletta 
hearsal in the Parlor. 
Written and Composed by Lester Howard, and sung only by 
Lizzie Hunter, of the " Novelty Four." 
Why did I 
leave thee, my dear old home; 
Why did I 
leave thee, this world to roam ; 
When lonesome and cheerless I 
oft think of thee— 
The affections and kindness you bestowed upon me. 
When father and mother, so loving and mild, 
With a 
helping hand wou:d raise their child, 
When brother and sister gentle would speak, 
And kiss the tears from off my cheek. 
I 
shall ne'er forget thee, my dear old home; 
I 
shall ne'er forget thee, wherever I 
roam, 
Nor the words that my mother so often would say: 
"My darling boy, never go astray." 
And I 
still remember my father's farewell— 
The joy it gives me no words can tell; 
And in memory's mirror I 
still see traces 
Of my friends at home with their smiling faces. 
I 
am going hack to my dear old home; 
am going back, no more to roam, 
To the place where I 
first laid my infant cheek, 
Back to the home where I 
first learned to speak. 
I'll I
N! welcomed back by friends so dear, 
With beauty and happiness scattering there. 
No more, then, will I 
wander alone; 
Put I'll be back in my dear old home,

My Love He Is a 
Sailor Bold. 
Written originally for, and sung by Emma Whitney, of the 
"Novelty Four," in their original Burletta Rehearsal in 
the Parlor. 
Oh, my love he is a 
sailor bold 
And he shipped on a 
man-of-war ; 
He sailed away one year to-day, 
And I 
ne'er snail see him more. 
He is reefing on the main-top sails, 
Or hauling on the main-top gaff, 
Or winding in the slack when the ship takes a 
tack, 
And the wind three sheets and a 
half. 
CHORUS. 
He sailed away with his heart so true, 
He sailed away with his shirt of blue, 
He sailed away with his gallant crew, 
And he said, " I'll write, I'll write to yon." 
He sailed to a 
foreign port, 
Where the monkeys and the cocoanuts grow. 
He v.- rote to me most every week; 
For he loved me true, I 
know. 
He started on a 
homeward trip, 
And they shipped in awful sea; 
But my sailor brave came home on a 
wave 
With his heart still true to me. 
CHORUS. 
We were married in the month of June, 
Though he had a 
wooden leg. 
An organ he did buy to stop the passers-by, 
An t 
the government allowed him to beg. 
He made nine cents a 
day, 
But his heart so longed for the sea, 
That he started on a 
lark in a 
full-rigged bark. 
For the islands of Fiji. 
Chorus.

He Leads the Military Band, 
7 
Written and composed by Lester Howard and sung by Miss 
Lizzie Hunter, of the " Novelty Four," with great success. 
You've heard about the Brannigans Band, 
A 
nd the Hoolahan Musketeers, 
About the Skidmore's and the Mulligan's, 
And their little Irish dears. 
But I 
have seen the boss of them all, 
There is none like him in the land, 
When he takes up his silver cornet, 
To lead the military band. 
CHORUS. 
He marched so grand in the military band, 
And his uniform fits so neat, 
He makes me sigh when he passes by, 
With the military band in the street. 
Last week I 
went out for a 
walk, 
Who do you think that I 
should meet, 
Why ' twas of course my favorite band, 
Who were marching down the street. 
As I 
caught his eye he winked so sly, 
At me he kissed his hand, 
Now what d,t you think of that my boys, 
From the leader of the military band. 
[Repeat.] 
Chorus. 
With his large plumed hat and white kid gloves, 
You will see him at the head, 
Blowing his silver B 
fiat horn, 
So gracefully he does tread; 
Yes every one admires him, 
Where'er he takes his stand, 
They cannot help but doing this, 
For he leads the military band. 
Chorus

My Darling Blue-eyed Dan. 
Written and sung by Emma Whitney of the " Novelty Four, 
in their original burletta, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, my heart is filled with joy, 
I 
scarce know what to say, 
About my darling blue-eyed Dan, 
I 
think of night and day. 
'Twas on a 
Sunday that we met, 
Amon!)- the sweet grape vines, 
And the little birds were singing forth, 
Their sweet harmonious rhymes. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
little rosebud, 
That blooms down in the shady lane, 
And the sun shines from the sky so bright, 
On my darling little blue-eyed Dan. 
He dresses neat his voice is sweet, 
As the sound of a 
silvery bell, 
And often times I 
run away, 
To meet him in the dell ; 
He meets me at the orchard gate, 
Every Sunday eve at nine, 
And whispers love tales in toy ear, 
And Pm sure he will be mine. 
Chorus.

The Irish Fusileers. 
Written for and sung by the great " Novelty Four," with 
rounds of applause, in their original Burletta Rehearsal 
in the Parlor, by somebody of High Esteem. 
We are the famous fusileers 
You hear so much about ; 
We make the streets resound with cheers 
Whenever we turn out; 
Our uniform is neat and gay— 
The finest in the land, 
We muster in the Fourteenth ward, 
On Bowery street, near Grand. 
Our captain's name is Doherty 
A 
finer man you ne'er did see, 
Sure he's always gay and free, 
And he no danger fears. 
See him marching through the street? 
Watch the motion of his feet; 
No crowd that walks can ever beat 
The Irish fusileers. 
CHORUS. 
Eyes front, toe the line, 
Mind the step and keep in time, 
Now the band begins to play, 
The air is full of cheers, 
Right wheel, mind your eye, 
Pipe the girls upon the sly, 
Oh, aint they grand the people cry, 
The Irish fusileers, 
On the seventeenth of March, 
You'll see us every year, 
For that's the day of all, my boys, 
To Irishmen so dear. 
St. Patrick's praises then are heard, 
Around on every hand. 
And we fall in line and gaily time, 
The music of the band. 
Garryowen sweet and gay, 
Awkward squad and Patrick's day, 
Now the band begins to play, 
The air is full of cheers, 
Pretty girls upon us gaze, 
Say we have such martial ways, 
Oh, we're the boys receive the praise, 
The Irish fusileers.

Cat-eyed Sal, 
Written and sung by John F. Whitney of the " Novelty 
Four," in the original Burletta, Rehearsal in the Parlor. 
First Verse—Interesting ; not very. 
Cat-eyed Sal was a 
nice young gal, 
And her age was sweet sixteen, 
She was fat, she was fair, and had saffron hair, 
And she walked like a 
Chinese queen. 
She would burst your heart like a 
huckleberry tart, 
If her eye caught you, you were gone, 
But an Italian talked her sweet, 
Who played music on the street, 
And she left me here forlorn. 
[Spoken]. 
And the enticing music he played was: 
I'm called little Buttercup, sweet little Buttercup, 
'Though I 
could never (hardly ever) tell why, 
' I'm called little Buttercup, sweet little Buttercup, 
Dear little Buttercup I. 
Second Verse—Not so much interesting as the first verse, 
This nice young gal was a 
cook on the canal, 
For the boarders she used to make gruel, 
The second time I 
saw my love, 
She was heaving stones at a 
mule, 
She could yell " gee ha" with such a 
mighty roar, 
It would burst a 
brass horn in a 
band, 
But how could she be so tart, 
As to go and give her heart, 
To a 
daygo from a 
foreign land, 
[Spoken]. 
And: especially a human being who would 
have the gall to play: 
My grandfather's clock, etc.

Or to own another pup. 
Now some of you viii laugh at dis, 
Bud I

Might tackle the wrong Thomas cat.

Afternoon We Met. 
Song and dance by Emma Whitney, of the " Novelt 
Four," in their original Burletta Rehearsal in 
the Parlor. 
One afternoon in the month of June, 
About the hour of three, 
My heart went with a 
charming gent, 
Who smiled as he passed me. 
He saw me drop by accident, 
My dainty little glove, 
He picked it up and I 
gave him, 
A winning smile of love, 
CHORUS. 
He smiles the sweetest smile, [ Break]. 
You should have seen his style, [ Break]. 
He's the prettiest little darling ever seen, 
He's his mother's only pet, 
And I 
often think of the happy time, 
And the afternoon we met. 
In a 
ball room next I 
met him, 
And there he held full sway, 
We danced and then he asked me if, 
I 
would he his some day. 
He smiled on me so sweetly as, 
He clasped me to his breast, 
And that is why I'm dressed so fine, 
Now you can guess the rest. 
RECITATION. 
Written and Recited by John F. Whitney of the " Novelty 
Four," in their original burletta, Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
I 
don't exactly recollect, but ' twas at the full of the moon, 
About three years ag) in the middle of next June, 
That a 
gang of us assembled for to start a 
fishing club, 
And we elected all the officers midst a 
terrible hubbub, 
And McGowan was elected Treasurer pro tem. 
We came to the conclusion we'd go bobbing after eels, 
And fur fear we'd get the cramps we took along a 
keg of nails, 
We started very early so as we'd not start late, 
And we had a 
gallon demijohn marked B-A-T-E, 
On the night that we went bobbirg after eels. 
Wien we got near the place where we were going to bob, 
We pushed the boat about a 
mile up to our necks in mud, 
Devlin : ot excited and McCue was going to shoot, 
Because he had the gall to make an eel-trap of his boot. 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
MeSourly, the comic singer, he wanted to vocalize, 
But we beseeched him to desist for us he'd paralyze. 
But when he got about half full he started Pinafore, 
And they threw him over the side of the boat and I 
never see 
him more, 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
When we got tired of bobbing it was near the break of day 
Muldoon cried out breakers ahead and swore we were out at 
sea, 
I 
never got over it for a 
month, for the cook made a 
great 
mistake, 
He gave me an eel for breakfast, and by heavens it was a 
snake. 
[Whisper]. 
On the night that we went bobbing after eels. 
Pull Up Your Suspenders.

Ioward, of the Novelty Four, 
in their original Burletta Rehearsal in the Parlor. 
RECITATION. 
Dot vife of mine, dot vife of mine, 
She boders mine life out all der time. 
She slaps mine nose mid pulls mine face, 
Und knocks mine ears all out of blace. 
She drives me of mine own house out, 
Und make me wander der night about, 
Till ven morning comes, mit a 
dove-like smile, 
I 
am coaxed back to my domicile 
By dot vife of mine. 
Dot vife of mine, dot vife of mine, 
Yen I 
goes to der tavern in der evening time, 
I 
sits me down in mine easy chair, 
Und eats mine Limburger und drinks mine beer. 
Ven in she comes, mit an old broom stick, 
Und hurries me home on der double-quick, 
Vile der people all look and laugh and stare, 
Und wonders who wears der britches dere, 
Me or dot vife of mine. 
Dot vife of mine, dot vife of mine, 
She wakes me up in der midnight time, 
Und tells me a 
pain in her stomach she's got, 
Und vants me to make her a 
viskey hot. 
I 
goes down shtairs in my cold shirt-tail, 
Und shkins my shins on der bucket pail, 
Drying to make a 
viskey hot, in a 
coffee-pot, 
For dot vife of mine. 
Dot vife of mine, dot vife of mine, 
Ven ever vill come der happy dime, 
Ven on dis mortal earth her breath 
Forever shall be stopp'd mit death. 
No more, I 
wonder und slitare und see 
Der leetle shtars she make for me, 
Den I 
shall be so happy und free 
From dot voman of mine.

The Yankee Girl. 
'Written by JAMES RICHMOND for EMMA W HITNEY, of the W HITNEY'S, and 
uerforined by her with great success in their character sketch, 
" 
Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
yankee girl, 
My name is Sally Brown, 
I 
can eat more pumpkin pie or apple sass, 
Than all the girls in Oskosh town. 
I 
can hoe or plow upon a 
farm 
Till the sun my skin does tan, 
My brother Bill caught me last night 
A 
kissing the hired man. 
Spoken. — Yes, Bill catched me kissing the hired man, 
and I 
got the darndest thrashing you ever seen, I 
did, and 
the night before I 
had to go to bed at 4 
o'clock in the 
afternoon for sucking eggs. 
But me and the hired man 
has fun, by gosh, we do. 
We rigged up a 
stuffed man the 
other night, got a 
big white sheet around it, got charcoal 
and blackened him just like ribs, painted his eyes, and we 
got out of bed at 10 o'clock at night and went down to 
Parson Jones' house, stood it on the stoop, pulled the bell; 
the parson he came out, he got scared to death, he closed 
the door, ran in and got an old shot gun and fired out the 
window, and we were running down the street and he shot, 
the hired man's hat, and Si Green seen us and told Parson 
Jones, and he had me and the hired man arrested and old 
Justice of Peace Simpson fined us 25 cents apiece, but if

Sweet Voice at the Door. 
Originally sung by SHEPARD & W HITNEY. 
The summer sun was shining fair 
As I 
tripped o'er the lea, 
A 
damsel fair with golden hair 
And eyes too blue to see, 
The birds were singing sweeter 
Than they'd ever sung before, 
And echoing to the warblings of 
That sweet face at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
felt so happy when I 
saw (Break.) 
My Nellie sitting at the door, (Break.) 
Oh, music haunts my memory, 
And gently steals me o'er, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door. 
Long years have come and gone since then, 
And gently passed me o'er, 
But still my loved one sits and sings 
Her sweet songs at the door. 
But when I 
dream of other days 
I 
love them as before, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door. 
(Chorue.)

The Tipperary Couple. 
Written and sung by the W HITNEY'S. 
Arrah, we just come over from Ireland, 
As you can plainly see, 
We are the Tipperary couple 
That's full of fun and glee, 
For to sing and dance is our delight 
We'll have you all to know, 
For at it we always jump, me boys, 
Wherever we may go. 
CHORUS. 
For we're two Irish Paddy's, 
Yes, we're two Irish Paddy's, 
Arrah we are the Tipperary couple 
That's full of fun and glee, 
For to sing and dance is our delight 
Wherever we may be. 
Arrah, the day we left ould Ireland, 
Sure the morning it was clear, 
And as we sailed away, our friends 
They all did weep in tears, 
Saying, good-by my neat little Irish pair, 
We ne'er shall see you more, 
For your going away to the land of the free, 
America's lovely sho-,. 
(Chorus.) 
We Came From Ireland 
Written by BEN COLLINS for the W HITNEY'S. 
Oh, here we are this evening, 
An Irish pair so true, 
We're just from Tipperary, 
Across the ocean blue. 
We'll sing and dance to please you, 
Our style you see is grand, 
We're as happy as two thrushes, and 
We came from Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Then watch our easy motion, ( Break.) 
We have just come o'er the ocean • 
To sweet America, 
We're gay and free as the little birds, 
And we'll have you to understand, 
We are two Irish Paddy's, and 
We came from Ireland. 
We left our native country 
While the birds were singing gay, 
To meet you here this evening 
We've braved the stormy sea, 
We left our friends behind us, 
And as we waived our hand, 
We softly murmured to them all, 
We're leaving Ireland. 
(Chorus.)

Written and sung by the W HITNEY'S. 
We ran away from school to- day, 
A 
little fun to see, 
And you can bet that we will see it, 
For we're as gay as gay can be. 
The teacher said she'd lick us 
If we ran away again, 
But then we'll take the licking, 
For in school we can't remain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we ran away (Break.) 
From the school to-day, (Break.) 
Oh, we ran away from school to- day, 
To have a 
jubilee, 
So now we'll have a 
dance, and then 
Hook up the jamboree. 
Oh, Sallie, she's a 
daisy, 
The darling of my heart, 
And Georgie is my choice too, 
From him I'll never part. 
We'll live happy together, 
And one thing more we'll say, 
We'll come and see you all again 
When next we run away.

We are two honest emigrants 
Just landed on your shore, 
We left our friends and home behind,

Where many flowers grow, 
One of them, Hospitality,

And we're two more from Erin's shore, 
We travel hand in hand, 
And we grow in soil with honest toil, 
We're two flowers from Paddy's land.

Oh! If I Knew the Man That 
Tell Me Love, Will You Remember? 
Learned. Her to Spar, 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND fcr JOHN W HITNEY. 
• 
Oh, I've got a 
wife her name is Christine, 
She is a 
hundred and nineteen, her nose it is green, 
She can crawl through a 
gas pipe, 
She's getting so lean, 
She can waltz on her eyebrows all night, 
If I 
tell her to wash my porous plaster, 
Its then she will kick, slug me with a 
brick, 
Make me go to the butchers for tick, 
I'll bet you seven dollars Johnny Dwyer she can lick, 
For her breath is as strong as an ox. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, if I 
knew the man that learned her to box, 
I'd give him the small pox or Chastine Cox, 
I'd hit him with a 
brick or a 
dozen of rocks, 
For learning my wife how to spar. 
The other evening I 
came home with a 
new pair of pants 
She stabbed me with a 
lance, 
Then I 
fell in a 
trance, 
Then she picked all my pockets when she got the elm!) ,  
And danced a 
Dutch reel on my neck, 
She picked me up like a 
baby and thre.—

Put a 
bandage on my head,

Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling, 
When I'm sailing o'er the sea, 
Keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrance, 
Tell me, darling, only tell 
CHORUS. 
Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When the roses cease to bloom? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love,

I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave, 
Tremured in my mem'ry,

Don t

Or about your bells at balls, 
I've got a 
pretty little dear, 
Much gayer than them all, 
You can see a 
host of pretty little dears, 
As through the streets you go, 
But where I 
met this little dear, 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know. 
For she's handsome and she's neat, 
And she always looks so sweet, 
But as she skipped a 
past me, 
She was singing sweet and low, 
I 
inquired her name, but what it is. 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know. 
She's got a 
pretty little foot, 
She wears a 
gaiter shoe, 
Her slender waist is very small, 
Her eyes a 
purple blue, 
Her hand is like the lilly fair, 
When it is in her blew, 
But who she's going to give it to. 
Oh! wouldn't you like to know.

Even more than tongue can tell,

TRY A LITTLE DANCING— CONCLUDED. 
To the theatre we went one night, 
We heard Brignoli singing, 
The applaudits of the house just then,

Around the stage kept prancing; 
The singing it was very good, 
But we preferred the dancing.

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm- chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You cart then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night -would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, & c.

The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me ? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! ( Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not !" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, & c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower.

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you.

For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O-V-E.

bright summer, &c.

To support my family.

Oh, yes, that dear ould sod, 
And its here I 
am in America, 
Carrying the hod.

Oh, its mortar and bricks 
I

My friends thc y 
know both near and far, 
No matter where I 
trod, 
That there's not a 
man in this whole wide world 
Can bate me carrying the hod. 
At night when I 
am through my work, 
Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a 
smile, 
My children do also, 
It's take a 
chail• and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn out 
From carrying the hod.

'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so

I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Torn Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bathe, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and sung 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh2 comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [break. 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind. 
Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
Composed by JAs. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by CHAS. 
REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE, at Miner's New York Theatre. 
We are a 
gay laboring pair, 
And we have a 
beautiful daughter 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to 
We thought that she fancied the stage, 
So we greeted her final request, 
And now she's a 
gay ballet dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarthy, 
She comes home at night and from matinees 
With large baskets of flowers and little bouquets— 
Oh she is our only daughter, 
And her father's the man that taught her. 
She wears spangled clothes, goes round on her toes-
The pride of the ballet is Biddy. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
So I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
So I 
took the old lady along, 
And in the parquet I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance 
Our son Danny was up the tier, 
And he cried out " Go in, sister Biddy," 
And they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage she is, &c. 
Erin's Isle.

Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay J 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isl% 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. (Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do adore, and there is something more, you're a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, &c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greet me with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle. 
Yes, I 
am, &c.

Her parents they like me, 
And every Sunday fternoon 
Miss Nancy I

CHORUS. 
Pretty little Nancy will you love me ? 
For you know I 
love you, Nancy Green, 
I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My heart was in a 
trance. 
I 
asked her for to marry me, 
,She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

What Are You Up To, Jane? 
sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, N. Y. 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug little grocery store. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. • 
What are you up to, Jane? What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane? now what you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again. 
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.— And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.— As our " blessings" came into the room two 
by-two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old 'un • dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
What are you up to Jane? &c. 
fair,

Thou'St gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in you silent tomb ; 
Yet niem'ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I 
think of the day we were parted, 
The heart-broken friends that stood by, 
Death came and it severed that tie, love, 
Thy spirit did mount upon high. 
CHORUS. 
Thou'st gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in yon silent tomb; 
Yet mem'ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I've thought of our home in the West love, 
Of friends and kindred so dear ; 
Alas! death has entered that home, love, 
And robbed it of all that can cheer. 
I 
think of thee ever, my loved one, 
How hard it was from thee to part 
And while I 
have life and have hope, love, 
I'll cherish thee to my heart. 
(Chorus.) 
I'll come to thee soon, my dear 4arling, 
And never again from thee part; 
The sun then will shine with that brightness, 
And pleasure return to my heart 
Then life shall be sweet as before, love, 
And gladness re-echo with joy; 
To meet thee above in that realm love, 
Where death ne'er again can destroy.

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, & c, 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh ! sorrowful sungs unsung.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Ohl " chaw roast-beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
: made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus:) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

We are the two McMullens,

Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Barney, 
Just twenty years ago.

Oh yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell, 
And of us two McMullens 
We hope you will speak well. 
We have to toil and labor 
Our apples for to sell, 
And when he gets elected 
To you he'll quickly tell.

Written and sung by Gus WILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by LOUIS P. 
GOULLARD. 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And 1 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thin'- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, &c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
ean only say— 
Good-bye, &c.

Composed, by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
• And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lancers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

Arrah, give me your attention every one, 
And hear what I've to say; 
It's all about a 
daughter of mine 
That's bound to have her way. 
She goes to the theatre every night, 
For the stage sure she's got spooney. 
And now she's got a 
date, and is making out first-rate, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she walks, shure she catches the gawks, 
By my sowl I 
think she's looney ; 
On me she's brought disgrace since she weal off her base, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. ( Dance.) 
Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates, 
And I 
ask her for God's sake to give it up, 
She says go away your feet ain't mates. 
Sure the actors all give her the laugh, 
And say that her act is Juney; 
The gillies she does mash, she gets seven dollars cash, 
For imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
Shure she washed up in Pat Rooney's sponge, 
And stole his dialect ; 
She tried to do his funny run off, 
And nearly broke her neck.

From the fellows that's fly, they give us the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major Magoozlum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight; 
They call us two guagers, the Judge and the Major, 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
Told us it was a 
sin; 
We never do fight, if ever we're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear.

And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said: 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Takejhat apron from your eye; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a

A

Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a

courting Cards.--This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a, way as to be non-committal 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
) 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
it is a Fac simile of a Trick imacticed by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called FIUMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling- trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
