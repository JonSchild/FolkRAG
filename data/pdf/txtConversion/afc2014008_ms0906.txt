Folklorist A
lan Lomax's T
rove Goes t
o L
ibrary
 
By L
inton Weeks
 
The l
i
fework o
f t
he l
a
te l
egendary American f
o
lklorist A
lan Lomax has been a
cquired b
y t
he American
 
Folklife Center i
n
 t
he L
ibrary o
f Congress.
 
"
I
 t
h
ink i
t
's t
he j
ewel i
n
 t
he c
rown o
f t
he collections here," says Peggy A
. Bulger, d
irector o
f t
he f
o
lklife
 
center, "
because i
t
 spans 70 y
ears. I
t
's a
lmost an entire century o
f documentation by one person who was
 
an i
ncredible collector and who had an ear f
or excellence."
 
The Lomax collection, s
he says, o
ffers a
 vast sampler o
f "
the very best music, dance and s
tories f
rom
 
1
930s t
o p
resent day." The l
i
brary expects s
cholars t
o benefit f
rom i
t
 f
or eons t
o come.
 
The purchase o
f t
he r
esearch material was made possible b
y t
he g
i
ft o
f an anonymous donor; t
he l
i
brary
 
was c
lose-lipped about t
he a
ctual cost. To hear f
o
lklorists t
a
lk, however, whatever t
he l
i
brary paid i
s
 a
 
bargain: The collection i
s
 considered t
o be p
r
iceless.
 
The acquisition o
f t
he collection w
ill be announced t
oday b
y L
ibrarian o
f Congress James H
. B
i
llington.
 
Lomax, who t
ook h
is f
i
rst f
o
lkloric s
teps a
t t
he l
i
brary i
n
 t
he 1
930s, r
ecorded and collected i
ndigenous
 
music, dances and s
tories f
rom t
h
is country and o
thers. He was e
specially f
ascinated b
y t
he i
dea t
hat a
 
culture's music o
r way o
f dancing speaks t
o i
t
s very core.
 
He marveled a
t t
he r
e
lationship o
f one people's music t
o another's and he t
r
ied t
o b
reak down musical
 
expression i
n
to what he called "
cantometrics," a
 quantifiable set o
f a
ttributes s
uch a
s t
ones, beats,
 
phrasings. He conducted s
imilar deconstructions o
f dance and s
torytelling.
 
When he was f
e
lled by a
 s
troke i
n 1
996, he was a
ttempting t
o assemble a
 worldwide multimedia
 
database t
hat he called t
he G
lobal Jukebox. He d
ied i
n
 2002.
 
Some academics and melody l
overs saw madness i
n Lomax's obsessive methodology, but no one
 
questioned t
he ambition and g
randeur o
f h
is quest. "
I
t
's a
 beautiful i
dea," says t
he collection's curator,
 
Todd Harvey.
 
He's t
he guy who w
ill be dealing w
ith more t
han 5
,000 hours o
f sound r
ecordings, 400,000 f
eet o
f movie
 
f
i
lm and 2
,450 v
ideotapes. The l
i
brary i
s
 a
lso r
eceiving 2
,000 s
cholarly books and j
ournals f
rom Lomax's
 
personal s
helves, s
cads o
f photographs, l
e
tters, manuscripts, l
ectures and ephemera o
f a
l
l sorts.
 
With s
uch a
 multimedia t
rove, t
he l
i
brary could well become t
he cosmic carousel i
nside Lomax's G
lobal
 
Jukebox.
 
Harvey i
s
 only beginning t
o appreciate t
he mother l
ode. He opens one o
f t
he boxes, l
abeled 27-9, and
 
pulls out a
 copy o
f "
A T
reasury o
f New England Folklore" b
y B
.A. Botkin. The book was i
nscribed t
o
 
Lomax "
i
n t
he vanguard and i
n
 t
he t
raditions." Botkin, Harvey says, s
ucceeded Lomax as t
he l
i
brary
's
 
p
r
imary f
o
lklorist. Beside i
t
 he f
i
nds a
 r
are f
i
rst-edition h
istory book.
 
The r
e
lationship between Lomax and t
he l
i
brary goes way back. F
rom a
 very early age, A
lan Lomax -

ometimes working w

heir f
i
rst r

or t
he l
i
brary i
n t
he summer o
f 1

A
lan was 18. The t
wo t
raveled a
round t
heir native Texas, r
ecording ballads, r
eels, work chants, b
lues and
 
h
ymns. John Lomax became an honorary consultant t
o t
he l
i
brary's a
rchive o
f t
he American f
o
lk song.
 
A
lan was named t
he a
rchive's assistant i
n 1
937.
 
While working f
or t
he l
i
brary, A
lan Lomax became t
he f
i
rst musicologist t
o r
ecord t
he uniquely American
 
music o
f Huddie "
Leadbelly" Ledbetter and McKinley "Muddy Waters" Morganfield.
 
He sat down w

Guthrie i
n
to s

t
ill f
or f
our hours o
f s
inging and p

n 1
940. Lomax was a
t t
he l
i
brary f
or 10 y
ears
 
before l
i
ghting out on h
is own.
 
The l
i
brary has a
lways owned t
he work t
hat Lomax d
id while working t
here. Now i
t
 possesses h
is whole
 
k
i
t-and-kaboodle.
 
Lomax believed t
hat music was a
 way t
o u
nderstand how people r
e
late t
o one another, says B
runo Netti,
 
an e
thnomusicologist a
t t
he University o
f I
l
l
inois. "
Lomax was basically r
i
ght, but I
'm not s
ure he d
id a
 
t
erribly good j
ob i
n p
roving i
t
.
"
 
M
ichael Taft, head o
f t
he l
i
brary's a
rchive o
f f
o
lk culture, says Lomax "was a
lways on t
he margins.... He
 
has an i
n
teresting and controversial r
eputation."
 
Lomax "
gave h
is l
i
fe over t
o t
ry
ing t
o f
i
nd d
iverse sounds," says Roger Abrahams o
f t
he University o
f
 
Pennsylvania. "
Having t
he collection go t
o t
he L
ibrary o
f Congress means t
he l
i
brary now owns t
he
 
collection o
f t
he g
reatest collector who ever l
i
ved."
 
To Lomax, t
he work was a
l
l. He even r
ecruited h
is daughter, Anna, t
o help h
im when s
he was 1
1. I
 k
ind
 
o
f g
rew up w
ith a
l
l t
h
is a
round me," Anna Lomax Wood, 59, says. She continues her f
ather's work a
t t
he
 
Association f
or Cultural Equity, which he e
stablished a
t Hunter College i
n Manhattan. The collection has
 
been s
tored t
here, among o
ther spots.
 
"
Every p
lace t
hat he had," s
he says, "
was h
is o
ffice a
s well a
s h
is l
i
v
ing quarters, c
rammed w
ith papers
 
and t
apes and f
i
les and equipment."
 
S
ingers and musicians j
ust s
howed up on t
he Lomax doorstep -
-
 i
n
 Washington o
r New York o
r London -
-
and s
tayed f
or weeks on end. Anna r
emembers a
 day i
n New York i
n 1963 when "
the whole Georgia Sea
 
I
s
lands choir came and s
tayed f
or some t
ime. I
 t
ook t
hem a
round t
o see t
he s
ights."
 
Lomax t
r
ied t
o convince t
he s
ingers t
hat t
hey could make i
t
 commercially. "
He was a
 p
roducer, a
 
s
howman," Anna says. "
A l
o
t o
f h
is academic colleagues were l
eery o
f h
im. He wore so many hats."
 
She says o
f her f
ather, "
He had i
ncredible charm. He was genuinely warm and caring."
 
But a
t one point, s
he says, he t
ook her aside and said "
he couldn't be a
 r
egular parent. Basically he s
aid
 
t
o me t
hat he had t
o make a
 decision. H
is work had t
o come f
i
rst. He j
ust couldn't be s
i
tting a
round going
 
t
o PTA meetings. He couldn't be a
 normal f
ather."
 
Sometimes, s
he says, "
he was hypercritical. He would do t
hat w
ith h
is colleagues -
-
 y
ell a
t h
is colleagues
 
and t
e
ll t
hem t
hey d
idn't k
now what t
hey were doing."
 
He was a
lso c
r
itical o
f h
imself, s
he says.
 
Lomax, a
fter a
l
l, was a
 man on a
 m
ission. He was demanding and he was d
riven. Because o
f h
is
 
s
ingle-mindedness, h
is collection i
s
 a
 national l
egacy.
