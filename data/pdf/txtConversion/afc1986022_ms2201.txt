125. The President Requests War Declaration 125 ( "December 7, 1941 A Date Which Will
Live in Infamy" Address to the Congress Asking That a State of War Be Declared Between
the United States and Japan. December 8, 1941
Mr. Vice President, and Mr. Speaker, and Members of the Senate and House of
Representatives:
YESTERDAY, December 7, 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of
America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of
Japan.
The United States was at peace with that Nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was
still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance
of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced
bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States
and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American
message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing
diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.
It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack
was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time

the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false
statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American
naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.
In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San
Francisco and Honolulu.

125. The President Requests War Declaration
Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night
Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong: Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last
night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked
Wake Island. And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.
Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific
area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United
States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very
life and safety of our Nation.
As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken
for our defense.
But always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.

No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American
people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we
will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of
treachery shall never again endanger us.
Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our
interests are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we
will gain the inevitable triumph so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan
on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and
the Japanese Empire
NOTE: Less than 24 hours after the reciept of the first news of the attack on Pearl Harbor,
the President drove to the Capitol to deliever the foregoing message to a joint session of
the Senate and the House of Representatives. The President spoke grimly for six and a
half
