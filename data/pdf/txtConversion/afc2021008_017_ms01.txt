Elinor Levy (00:00:00): 
So today is Thursday, June 16th, 2022. This is Elinor Levy, E L I N O R. Folklorist on the project 
Community Health Workers in Downstate New York. And I'm here with... 
Kenney Gould (00:00:21): 
Kenney Gould. 
Elinor Levy (00:00:22): 
If you could spell that, please? 
Kenney Gould (00:00:23): 
Spell my name? K E N N E Y G O U L D. 
Elinor Levy (00:00:28): 
Who is a licensed clinical social worker. 
Kenney Gould (00:00:31): 
Correct. 
Elinor Levy (00:00:32): 
At Sun River Health. And Aaron Paige will be along soon, but we're going to go ahead and start. So we 
always start with something really easy. The very basics, tell us where you were born and you know, 
how you sort of... your journey to here. 
Kenney Gould (00:00:50): 
Oh boy. Oh my gosh. It is not simple. 
Elinor Levy (00:00:54): 
<laugh>. 
Kenney Gould (00:00:54): 
Okay. So let me think this out. I was born in Los Angeles, and raised in Los Angeles. I never would've left 
LA. But, when I finished high school, I moved in with a community called the Catholic Worker. I don't 
know if you're familiar with them. 
Elinor Levy (00:01:15): 
I am. 
Kenney Gould (00:01:15): 
In LA, they have a house and a community. They run a soup kitchen. They had a free medical clinic at the 
time, and a house of hospitality where people off the street lived in the house. And so I was living there 
and I went to college, you know, kind of off and on between my time at the Catholic Worker House. 
Elinor Levy (00:01:39): 
What college? 
Kenney Gould (00:01:40): 
I went to Loyola, Marymount, and then I dropped out of there, went to Antioch, which was kind of like a 
commuter school, You know? Long story short, I ended up doing a lot of traveling. One of my close high 
school friends, Mexican American guy, talked me into going down to Mexico with him. And when I went 
to Mexico, just fell in love and ended up staying for a while. It was there that I met my wife, whose 
parents were Catholic Worker folks from New York City and were getting ready to move out to the farm 
in Marlborough, New York. It was a Catholic Worker farm out there. I don't know if you've ever been 
there. Interesting place. When we met in Mexico, she dragged me up to the Northeast. When we got 
here, we were living at the Catholic Worker Farm, and we were expecting our first child. And I started 
doing work wherever I could around the area. One of the farms actually hired me and another guy that 
was living at the house at the time, Mexican guy. And so we started working there at the farm picking. It 
was my first time doing any work like that, and it was just so hard. It was overwhelming. I couldn't 
believe it. 
Elinor Levy (00:03:11): 
I actually in college, spent two weeks picking beans for an experiment and then I'm like, they fired me 
because I was... 
Kenney Gould (00:03:20): 
They fired you! 
Elinor Levy (00:03:22): 
I've never been so happy to be fired in my life. Why don't we take a pause while you get set up? 
Kenney Gould (00:03:27): 
Hello, Aaron. 
Aaron Paige (00:03:28): 
Hi, Kenney! Pleasure! 
Kenney Gould (00:03:30): 
Nice to meet you! 
Aaron Paige (00:03:31): 
Yeah, you too. 
Aaron Paige (00:03:32): 
I've heard so much about you! 
Kenney Gould (00:03:35): 
Are you serious? 
Aaron Paige (00:03:36): 
Yeah, from almost everybody that we've talked to. At least who are involved in outreach work. 
Elinor Levy (00:03:42): 
So, here we go again. So you were talking about how you were picking apples and pears and it was not 
good. 
Kenney Gould (00:03:48): 
And of course, I was lucky because our daughter was born, our first child. And so I got out of work and 
had baby duty, and diaper duty and all that stuff. It was during that summer, I guess it was '94, that I 
met this Christian brother named brother Dan Crimmins. I don't know if you're familiar with the 
Christian brothers on nine. 
Elinor Levy (00:04:13): 
I know where they are. 
Kenney Gould (00:04:15): 
He was working for an organization called Reaping the Harvest. This started back in 1984. It was a 
church project through St. Mary's in Marlborough. They had a really progressive Monsignor there at the 
time who wanted to spend time working with farm workers. So they were doing all kinds of projects, 
and he ended up becoming the director of Reaping the Harvest. And what they do is they would drive 
people from the farms to a central location, a clinic. 
Kenney Gould (00:04:48): 
And this was back in 1994, when I met him. And in 95, since I was living at the farm, I started 
volunteering, driving people from the farms to the health center, and then we'd wait and we'd wait until 
they were done being seen. And then we'd drive them back home. And that's just the way it worked. 
And of course, Ulster County's a big county. It's not like Orange County, where everything's pretty much 
centralized. All the farm works here. You'll be going down, you know, up to Kingston and down, you 
know, almost to Newburg, the Orange County line, and out by Ellenville and Accord, you know, and all 
around the surrounding areas. And even the people that work in the packing houses in Ulster County, 
some of them may live in Newburg or in Dutchess and Poughkeepsie. It's a big area to cover. So, I 
worked with him for a couple of years, and then the clinic hired me. And when the clinic hired me, I 
became the full-time outreach worker. And that was almost....hired in 97. 
Aaron Paige (00:06:00): 
Wow. 
Kenney Gould (00:06:00): 
Yeah. And so what was happening at the time was around 92, 93, 94 in the United States, Mexico and 
Canada, the free trade agreement, right? 
Elinor Levy (00:06:10): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:06:10): 
And what was happening in Mexico was there was a lot of turnover. People were moving from the 
smaller towns into the cities, or bypassing the cities and coming straight up here. In fact, there was a 
Mexican anthropologist that said 50% of Mexican campesinos were living and working in the United 
States. So things really changed fast. And what happened in Uster county was you had traditionally an 
African American population that was migrating, to a Jamaican population, to an increasingly Latin 
American and mostly Mexican population. So the infrastructure wasn't set up for Spanish speakers. I just 
happened to, like I said, I was living in Mexico with my wife, and I just kind of stepped in and had enough 
Spanish to be able to work with, you know, interpreting and things like that. 
Aaron Paige (00:07:01): 
So when you joined, did you get to experience some of that transformation also? 
Kenney Gould (00:07:07): 
Yeah, definitely. So I knew a lot of African Americans...and there is still remnants of the African 
Americans that that came up that had originally come to Florida or North Carolina that ended up settling 
up in the area. In fact, I still know a few in their seventies and eighties that are in the area. Same thing 
with Jamaicans. The nature of farm work is, especially in this area, it's heavily seasonal. So it makes 
organizing a little difficult when you have a migrating population. And the infrastructure is kind of set up 
around that, but they don't really hit the nail right on head. 
Elinor Levy (00:07:52): 
Right. 
Elinor Levy (00:07:52): 
And you can't. You take your best guess. It's almost kind of like the flu shot. You say, "Well, this is 
probably the way it's going to be." So we'll give them this strain and hope that it's going to match with 
the needs. And so there's a lot of improvisation in the way it works. But when you work with 
institutions, improvisation isn't really the nature of the game, right? And so that's why outreach is so 
important, because you need somebody that can be out there that has got of sense of what's going on. 
Maybe get a little bit of the bigger picture. And of course, the structures always take a... There's a lag 
between when they can react. And then by the time they react, of course, we're onto the next thing, 
you know? 
Aaron Paige (00:08:31): 
Reflecting on that kind of history of working with several different cultural communities, have you seen 
the needs shift from community to community or just over time? 
Kenney Gould (00:08:44): 
Really great question. So the way that I've seen, and of course, I'm just going to give a disclaimer, this is 
from my working experience, and somebody else might give you a completely different impression. In 
my experience, what was happening was when I came, it was moving primarily from Jamaican H2A 
workers as the seasonal workers, to Mexican workers and families. So when you're dealing with a single 
male population, whether or not they're married or not, when they're up here and working, they're 
single males. And the needs and the healthcare needs that they have, totally different than when you're 
talking about a family with children and the needs and stuff that they have. And of course, remember, 
I'm working as an outreach worker for a health clinic. So sociologically, it's really interesting and 
fascinating, but my goal and focus is really on meeting the healthcare needs of these people. So what 
are the healthcare needs of these people? So, we've got these things like ABCD, migrant education, 
programs that exist to serve the farmworker community. And of course, this is like a boom time for 
ABCD, because they are agribusiness daycare, right? And so they're getting more and more kids in the 
program. And in order to get in the program, you need to get a physical. And if you just arrived, this was 
back in the time before Child Health Plus, people didn't have health insurance. So they come to the 
health center, right? So we had to adapt. And what were some of the requirements? You know, PPD for 
tuberculosis. A general physical exam, right? 
Kenney Gould (00:10:28): 
Make sure immunizations are up to date. And of course, people traveling don't always have all the 
records with them. Some people are coming from Mexico, the records look different for immunizations 
than the way we do things here. So these are all these kind of modifications and adaptations that had to 
be done in the health center to meet the needs of the most recently arrived folks. 
Elinor Levy (00:10:49): 
But also going, the Jamaicans would speak English. 
Kenney Gould (00:10:54): 
The Jamaicans are English speaking. That's right. And we have a Spanish speaking population, that's 
right. And for some people, it was, you know, pretty much exclusively Spanish speaking. And of course, 
as years go by, you have kids and they grew up here. They're the interpreters for their families and 
become the go-between in terms of language. 
Aaron Paige (00:11:15): 
That's Nicki, right? 
Kenney Gould (00:11:17): 
Hey Nicki, how are you? 
Nicki (00:11:18): 
You want to get in? 
Kenney Gould (00:11:20): 
No. I was in there. Fernando's in there. 
Nicki (00:11:23): 
Okay. 
Kenney Gould (00:11:23): 
And I'm doing an interview. 
Nicki (00:11:26): 
Oh, yeah. 
Aaron Paige (00:11:26): 
Hi, Nicki! 
Nicki (00:11:27): 
Hi. 
Elinor Levy (00:11:27): 
Hi. 
Kenney Gould (00:11:28): 
Good to see you Nicki, I'll check in with you a little later. I heard you were in Walden... 
Nicki (00:11:33): 
What's that? 
Kenney Gould (00:11:34): 
I heard you were in Walden. Ah look, talk to you about that later. 
Aaron Paige (00:11:40): 
Please keep going. 
Kenney Gould (00:11:42): 
I kind of lost my train of thoughts. 
Elinor Levy (00:11:44): 
You were talking about, as the populations start to equal out as being Latino, that the children start to 
interpret for the... 
Kenney Gould (00:11:53): 
That happens a lot. Yeah. So, you have the needs of a Jamaican population who's here seasonally, to all 
of a sudden, you got this population that's moved in with families. And then some of them will just end 
up becoming year-round people, because the most difficult folks to work with are migrating families. 
They were the worst off. And so there were a lot of farms that had tons of families. Really big farms. 
We're talking like over a hundred people, you know? And they'd be there for a period of a few months. 
But those folks had it really tough, because if you think about it, they'll start school year here in New 
York, September. Then they'll move on to Florida. Good morning. 
Person (00:12:40): 
Good morning. 
Kenney Gould (00:12:41): 
How are you? Then from Florida, they may go to another place, and then they'll come back to New York. 
So the kids weren't in a consistent school year, they're moving. You don't bring everything that you own 
with you. A lot of these guys, undocumented, majority of them no driver's licenses. The cars are kind of 
rigged together. And there are total, you know, ____ for all the state troopers from Florida to New York. 
And then when they get to New York, of course, the fact that undocumented people are able to get 
licenses is a really recent development. 
Elinor Levy (00:13:18): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:13:19): 
Completely vulnerable people. And so when you're a vulnerable population... Now the Jamaicans, of 
course, everything was about, Look you're H2A worker, you're coming, you're living on the farm. You're 
not going to own a car. You're bussed to the store once a week. You cash your check, and you bus back 
home and it's like, work is what you're here for. And at the end of the season, you go back home. With 
the Mexicans, it's a little bit different. So you may have people here year-round in a hostile 
environment. Anti-immigrant, hostile environment. And they've got to live here, but they got to remain 
under the radar. So it's a really fascinating development. 
Kenney Gould (00:13:58): 
And these are things that is really hard to appreciate. You know, if you don't have that experience, that 
you have to be like, "Everybody's suspicious. Who's coming in? What's going on here?" So there's a lot 
of... And then of course, the systems really aren't set up to meet your needs. 
Aaron Paige (00:14:19): 
Yeah. And along those lines, thinking about continuity of care, especially when you have a population 
that's moving around, how in your role as an outreach worker did you negotiate that? 
Kenney Gould (00:14:34): 
Really easy. So I say it's easy, but there are actually there are systems that are set up. A lot of people, 
whether or not they work with them or not, these systems exist. One is Migrant Clinicians Network, 
which is kind of set up for migrating populations. Have you heard of them? 
Elinor Levy (00:14:50): 
No, this is the first... 
Kenney Gould (00:14:51): 
It's a really great system. So, it's a little bit unwieldy to get started. And now of course, on computers, 
unless your computer savvy, it's really difficult. But it's really set up so that if somebody has chronic 
severe disease, they can hook them up with an outreach worker. And in some cases it's more like a 
virtual outreach worker that's going to be calling them and making sure. And not only do they work 
within the United States, but they'll follow people to their countries. 
Elinor Levy (00:15:18): 
Oh, okay. 
Kenney Gould (00:15:19): 
So I've had people sign up for that. People with cancer or HIV, back in the day. Just a similar story. Okay, 
so we got a guy who tested positive for HIV down in Florida. Came up to New York, of course, tested 
positive, but wasn't sure if he wanted to deal with it or not. Didn't want to deal with it. The stigma. 
Couldn't accept he had it. All those things. And so he decided he was going to leave at the end of the 
season. Go back to Florida. Deal with it later. Right? Well, unfortunately, or fortunately for him, was in 
one of the towns, buying beer late at night, gets accosted by two guys. Punched simultaneously in his 
jaw breaking both sides of his jaw and had to get his jaw wired shut. And so, because he had his jaw 
wired shut, he wasn't going anywhere. Had to eat through a straw for two months. And the whole 
situation got really complicated. But because of that, he was able to establish care, start treatment, and 
then of course, stayed for a year. And at the end of the year, he wanted to move on, because you know 
the seasonal life and following the work and stuff. So he moved on, but because of Migrant Clinicians 
Network, we were able to get him a virtual outreach worker and they were able to make sure that he 
got his bills. Got set up with the local department of health who was doing those kinds of treatments. 
Access to his lab reports up here or wherever he might go. So they'd basically follow him until he came 
back up here again. 
Aaron Paige (00:17:04): 
Have you ever worked in that capacity? 
Kenney Gould (00:17:06): 
As an outreach worker doing international or national? 
Aaron Paige (00:17:08): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (00:17:08): 
Well, informally, but not formally. I'll give you an example. Some people that I know that...very sad 
story. Some older folks that were up here, and this is in the 1990s, the grandfather, if you will, also had 
HIV and was diagnosed up here, and of course with some other things. And so after a couple of years, 
they wanted to go back to Mexico. So they went back to Mexico. The informal kind of outreach is I was 
able to go down to their village, meet with them. They took me to the health center, introduced 
everybody to me as their doctor. I was like, "Oh, yeah right. I'm the doctor." But that was the way they 
introduced because that was the only way they understood it. The thing to remember about outreach, 
the really important thing, the nut of it is, is that you've got to meet the people where they are and not 
when they get to you. Because when they get to you, often they're in really bad shape and a crisis 
situation. The fact of the matter is, according to the National Center for Farmworker Health, 75% or 
more of the farmworkers don't get services in the health centers. They just don't. 
Kenney Gould (00:18:42): 
For variety of reasons, right? So you have to be able to meet people exactly where they are. And in 
order to do that, you have to build up a certain level of trust, or trust among other people to be able to, 
you know, people feel comfortable enough to ask you for things. So informally, I've done a little 
outreach like that. But really, my focus was in Ulster County. Now another really interesting thing is, 
back in the late 90's, early 2000's, my wife and I were able to also go down to Florida and see some of 
the crews that were coming up here. We got to stay with a crew leader, who's also a compadre. So you 
build these relationships, and then of course, the relationships are like a whole other network of friends 
and loose associations. 
Elinor Levy (00:19:38): 
I've become interested in the issue of children having to be interpreters for their parents, and the effect 
on the children sort of... 
Kenney Gould (00:19:55): 
Like having to be adults before they are adults biologically, physiologically, psychologically. 
Elinor Levy (00:20:00): 
I guess we heard from someone that it wasn't that big a deal. But I do wonder, if from your perspective 
as a licensed social worker and as someone who's been observing this for a long time, what is the effect 
on the relationship of the parent and the child, especially if the child was born in the U.S., or was 
brought here young enough that they're really socially acclimated to be more American than being 
Latino or? 
Kenney Gould (00:20:39): 
Yeah. So, it's a good question. And I think for some people, it may not have been such a big deal, right? 
And it's part of their process. For other people, it might have been devastating, especially if parents are 
going through really difficult or crisis moments. They have to step up to the plate, and they're not 
prepared. It runs the gamut. Another thing is, we have a lot of Mexicans and Central Americans and I 
think that more and more Spanish has become much more acceptable. It's easier to get an interpreter. 
Elinor Levy (00:21:19): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:21:21): 
But there are some families, for example, that maybe Spanish is their second language because they 
speak an indigenous language. That might make it more complicated. Or also, there's a family in Ulster 
County and there was a significant number of Bangladeshi farmworkers in Ulster County. And I can tell 
you, the kids when they came, and I remember one family, when the kids came, after kind of culturally 
adapting and assimilating to a certain extent, became the spokespeople for their parents. Now the 
children have grown up and have gone, and the parents are, again, very isolated and lonely. 
Elinor Levy (00:22:09): 
I didn't even think of that, that if the parents never have to learn. 
Kenney Gould (00:22:16): 
Right. It can be very isolating. 
Elinor Levy (00:22:17): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (00:22:17): 
And you know, Mexicans, and that's my experience of working mostly with Mexicans, but they have 
intergenerational families living together. In this one particular family, it's a Bangladeshi family living in 
Highland, New York, and there are not too many other Bangladesh families in the area. It was a duplex 
they lived in. There was another Bangladeshi family, and that family moved out. And the nature of the 
farm work is, this is the lowest end of the working ladder, right? The lowest rung of the working ladder. 
And as soon as people get established, they're going to make friends, they're going to maybe go into 
construction or maybe landscaping, or maybe they heard about a factory that's hiring that's year-round, 
that's not seasonal work. And so the goal for people is they move in and they move out of farm work. 
There's an agency called Pathstones, I don't know if you're familiar with it. Pathstones used to be called 
Rural Opportunities. Their mission was to get people from the farms off into other sectors of the 
economy. 
Kenney Gould (00:23:22): 
Because farmworker, like I said, is the lowest rung. Now you're going to have some farmworkers and 
that's it, it's as good as it gets, and that's the way it's gonna be. I mean, it's interesting, you know? Most 
of the people that we work with and you run a variety...Of course, in Mexico, a lot of migration from the 
south to the north, you will get some people that have education and certain levels of formal education. 
Elinor Levy (00:23:56): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:23:56): 
But you get a lot of people too, that...I can name a number of people who've never learned to read or 
write. And they don't want to learn to read or write. They've been able to make ends meet without 
learning how to read or write. 
Aaron Paige (00:24:09): 
We talked to a young CHW about that. She was talking about how her grandmother couldn't read or 
write. And then one of the roles that she's been playing at the health center is... 
Kenney Gould (00:24:21): 
Filling out paperwork? Yeah, right. 
Aaron Paige (00:24:22): 
Filling out paperwork. Taking people through documents. You talked about trust building. Just 
wondering how you kind of approach that in your work. How you instantiate trust. If there are methods. 
Or if it's just kind of improvisatory, as you were saying? 
Kenney Gould (00:24:38): 
Yeah. That's a really good question. It's so hard, because as we've developed technologically, we seem 
to rely more on these mediums to be that buffer, or even connector to people. A buffer in what way? 
Well, you got to schedule the appointment online. Well, forget it. You just lost half the people right 
there, right? For some people, you got to call and navigate the telephone system. Forget it, you lost the 
other half. So the few that have the patience to get through, and that's not just with healthcare, you call 
your bank. God, if you have insurance, forget about it, and then you got to get authorization for 
everything. Right? 
Aaron Paige (00:25:23): 
Right. 
Elinor Levy (00:25:23): 
I'm a client of Sun River Health. 
Kenney Gould (00:25:25): 
Oh my God! 
Elinor Levy (00:25:26): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (00:25:26): 
The phone system, right? 
Elinor Levy (00:25:28): 
Oh my. I tried to schedule an online appointment, and it was impossible, so I know the feeling. 
Kenney Gould (00:25:37): 
I sympathize with you. That is really tough. And so what happens is, is we become... Systems go from 
more simple, to more complex, generally. And as you get more successful the more complex you 
become. And we're talking big stakes at that point. So I think the first thing to do, and God, it just sounds 
ridiculous, but it really does begin with a knock on the door. "Hi, my name is... I work at... If there's 
anything that we could be helpful with, this is what we can offer you. And this is what it looks like." You 
ever been in line at at a DMV? Back in the days where everybody is sitting around? You wait about a half 
hour and you start recognizing, "Okay, that guy was ahead of me. I know that. And these other guys, 
they're just arriving. They don't know what the hell's up." But you sit in that room and all of a sudden, 
you kind of get a sense, and people also kind of their feelers, they know where you are in the rank of 
who's gonna get seen next. And you get a sense of the people around you. Maybe you get some talkers. 
Maybe you got some very quiet don't mess with me types. But you sit in that room long enough, and 
you start feeling a little bit more comfortable, and it becomes an acceptable place to be sitting and 
waiting. Right? 
Kenney Gould (00:27:08): 
You may strike up a conversation, you may not. But when those new guys come in, it kind of throws off 
that homeostasis of the groove. It's like, "Oh, now these guys got to adapt to this. Let's make it 
comfortable for everybody again here." So outreach is really a long game. It's not a short, lightning. It's 
not speed dating. It's a long game. And it requires lots of patience. And that's just the way I see it. And 
so, the best way to do it is just by being there. You can come in with a lot of splashes and bangs and 
noises, but it's a long game. 
Aaron Paige (00:27:52): 
Like continually showing up. 
Kenney Gould (00:27:56): 
Yeah, exactly. 
Kenney Gould (00:27:56): 
That's just the way I see it. And that's the way I've done it. Just so you guys know, for me, you know, the 
Tortoise and the Hare? The race? I'm the tortoise. I'm slow. It takes me a while to come to decisions. I 
just take things really nice and easy. Excuse me one second. 
Person (00:28:14): 
Because we have no internet. 
Kenney Gould (00:28:17): 
No kidding. 
Person (00:28:19): 
It's weird, I have no app. I can't get onto Google. The thing for Google's completely gone. 
Kenney Gould (00:28:25): 
How about Fernando? He's online. 
Person (00:28:26): 
Yeah, but he's on a whole different... 
Kenney Gould (00:28:28): 
Oh, he's got his own... 
Person (00:28:30): 
He's online in there. He can't go on our line, you see? 
Kenney Gould (00:28:33): 
Check it out. I haven't seen it. I know Marilyn's up there. She'll be on it. 
Elinor Levy (00:28:39): 
It sort of reminds me of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, where, I think it's her sister Mary, who says, 
"Once trust is lost, it's gone." I imagine that would be the same. 
Kenney Gould (00:28:53): 
Totally true. 
Elinor Levy (00:28:54): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (00:28:54): 
Takes forever to build up a certain rapport and you just screw up once, that's it. Takes a second to lose 
it. It's so true. And that goes with everything, you know? Integrity is super important. And we just talked 
about people who don't read or write. Don't rely on, well you signed a contract, that means nothing. But 
what you say, they remember. So you have to complete, if somebody asks you or you tell them you're 
going do something... This is something that really happens a lot. Agencies will say, "Oh yeah, we can do 
that. We can do that. We can do that.'" But if you don't complete it, that's it. It's super important. Being 
present, available, integrity. And then just knowing that half the seeds that you sow aren't going to 
come up anyway. But you still sow them. 
Kenney Gould (00:29:57): 
And that's just the way you have to do it in outreach. You have to develop a little bit of a thick skin. But 
at the same time, you have to be open enough to be able to be... Because you're going to meet new 
people. Needs are going to be different. You have to be able to change as things change. Like with 
COVID. Really threw everything off for a lot of people. And how do you adapt to that? Sometimes you 
just can't. You're not going to make it work. 
Aaron Paige (00:30:30): 
Is showing up for you, does that involve being present in non-professional situations, in the sense of that 
there are events, community events or birthdays and things like that? I'm just wondering... 
Kenney Gould (00:30:50): 
Okay. So, this is another really crazy thing. For most people, it's not legitimate, good way to do it. And 
this is one of the reasons why I was moved all the way out here from Ulster County. So what happened, 
is I'm Catholic, my wife's Catholic, we lived at the Catholic worker farm. We were raised this way. Most 
of the arriving immigrants, especially the Mexicans, a lot of them come as Catholics. And so what 
happens is if you have a child, you want to get it baptized, first communion, confirmation, you know? A 
lot of the people, they have more informal weddings, which they call union libre, which means they're 
committed. They may have children. They may have been together for 25 years, but they don't actually 
have a marriage certificate. And it's very common, especially among working people. So we have 
probably over 30 God children. 
Kenney Gould (00:31:46): 
Some of them are adults, for their weddings. And some of them are baptism, first communion, 
confirmation. And then we did like confirmation prep. So like I said, I worked with brother Dan and the 
Reaping the Harvest. That's a Catholic organization. We did a lot of preparations. And then of course on 
the weekends, when I wasn't working at the clinic, we get Spanish-speaking priests to come out to the 
camps, have mass for 150-200 people during the season. It was just really amazing times. So those are 
things that we did that, that were not formal, but that's being present in a different way. 
Aaron Paige (00:32:22): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:32:23): 
And of course it spills out, because you work professionally at the clinic. 
Aaron Paige (00:32:28): 
Now, I've got it. 
Kenney Gould (00:32:28): 
You got it. 
Aaron Paige (00:32:29): 
Dry throat. 
Elinor Levy (00:32:29): 
And then they see you on the weekends... 
Kenney Gould (00:32:33): 
Exactly. So, you go to parties, birthday parties, baptisms, quincenieras, the whole gamut. 
Elinor Levy (00:32:42): 
Yeah. I think we find the same thing as folklorists. When you work with a community, there starts to be 
these expectations that you'll show up and... 
Kenney Gould (00:32:53): 
Oh yeah. 
Elinor Levy (00:32:53): 
And then suddenly every weekend it's... 
Kenney Gould (00:33:01): 
That's it. That's your life right there. Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (00:33:03): 
It's hard to say no, because they get insulted. Not even upset. They get insulted. 
Kenney Gould (00:33:09): 
Right. And then if you don't go, then you won't be invited the next time. So it's like a chain. 
Elinor Levy (00:33:15): 
And then, you know, but it also can seep over into... 
Kenney Gould (00:33:23): 
Seep over into what ? 
Elinor Levy (00:33:23): 
It can seep over into the work. "Well, you didn't show up for this party which I invited you to. So why 
should I..." 
Kenney Gould (00:33:30): 
So this is a really tricky thing, because as you can say, "Well, I just wear many hats." Doesn't really work 
like that. You're the same person. I've talked to people, and of course, I'm running into people in the 
grocery store. Used to be in the laundromat until I got my own washing machine. And you're going to 
run into people in all kinds of, you know, driving down a road and you see a car full of people. You're just 
going to run into people. And when you run into people, they may just ask you, "Hey, can I get in to see 
the doctor?" And it's Sunday, and it's like..."Tell you what, here's, what we'll do." But some people that 
are not outreach oriented are like, "I'm not at work right now, wait until..."You know what I mean? 
There are ways of talking to people. There are ways of answering questions. There are ways of saying, 
"Hey, I don't have an answer for you right now, but let me get back to you on that." And then you better 
get back to them on that. And then there are ways of saying, "Don't talk to me." People often don't get 
the second version. It comes off as "They don't like me." And then there you go. You just shut the 
communication and relationship down. 
Aaron Paige (00:34:43): 
And people draw that line at different places. We've talked to outreach workers who have had patients 
sleeping on their couches, because they were homeless at the time. Or they were in situations where 
they're experiencing domestic abuse, and they had nowhere else to turn. And they are a trusted 
resource, whether it's a community health worker or an outreach worker. 
Kenney Gould (00:35:03): 
That's right. 
Elinor Levy (00:35:03): 
And others who definitely say "This is my job." You know? 
Aaron Paige (00:35:15): 
So while that's not necessarily part of the job description a lot of people doing the work, see that as part 
of the work. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. 
Kenney Gould (00:35:27): 
So slippery and tricky, because here's the thing. So it's like the boundaries issue, basically. That's what 
we call it. Educated white folks, we call it boundaries. Right? 
Elinor Levy (00:35:40): 
Work-life balance. 
Kenney Gould (00:35:41): 
So here's the thing. When I started studying to become a social worker that was like, "Oh dude, your 
boundaries are way off." Right? I've been beating with it. And I've come to an understanding that I think 
that there's a context to it all too. And the higher up that you move in that ladder, professional, 
respectability, there are certain ways and modes of behaving that you have to abide by. Most outreach 
workers and community health workers, are basically on a more horizontal level with the groups that 
they're working with. So yeah, you're compadres with somebody. You are Padrinos of somebody, and 
when they want to get an appointment in the clinic... Well, back in their country, if you want to get 
something and you've got a government official, that's, you know, a cousin of somebody you know, you 
go through that avenue. And so that becomes the avenue. And you have to be really careful, because for 
some people that can be a source of power that can be abused and work to that person's advantage. 
Kenney Gould (00:36:54): 
And so I'm always constantly self-reflecting. "Okay, how does this play off in the bigger picture? Is this 
an abuse of my position of power and privilege?" And it's always going to be an issue. Now, even if it's 
more horizontal, and you've got a Mexican outreach worker dealing with Mexican people, that's still a 
position of power and privilege to a certain extent. Maybe they've had the exact same experiences. 
Maybe they've worked on farms and stuff like that. And so for me, it's a really tricky one. Don't want to 
call anybody out, but there's been many people come from the farms, land a semi-professional job as a 
receptionist in a health center. And the next thing, you know, all the patients that are getting in happen 
to be family or extended family of that person and other people have a hard time breaking in. That's a 
problem. 
Kenney Gould (00:37:49): 
And it happens because it's human, it's totally normal to look out for your people. So I'm outsider 
enough, being a white guy, that I can have that perspective. I'm not letting my own immediate family 
down if they're not able to get an appointment right away because my immediate family's all out in 
California or, you know what I mean? But my in-laws are Sun River Health patients. My brother-in-law 
and my in-law parents are Sun River Health patients. I try and keep it a respectful kind of like, "Well, 
okay. Look, I can help you out with this, but you got to understand. I have certain limitations when it 
comes to that stuff." 
Elinor Levy (00:38:36): 
I just have never used my connections at Sun River Health. 
Kenney Gould (00:38:38): 
Well, you should start using them! 
Aaron Paige (00:38:42): 
Now you've got a lot, so. 
Kenney Gould (00:38:43): 
Yeah! 
Kenney Gould (00:38:43): 
And, you know, that's a real issue. It's a real concern. And so you always have to balance it, and not 
everybody can do it gracefully. And I'm not saying I do it gracefully all the time. There are times when I 
step right in it. 
Elinor Levy (00:39:01): 
This is a job where the health workers in the migrant program who were migrant farmworkers, they're 
changing their job, but they're not moving to a new area. So they're maintaining the same friend base. 
Everything else stays the same, except for the job, in a sense. So, it doesn't surprise me... 
Kenney Gould (00:39:27): 
That that would happen, yeah. 
Elinor Levy (00:39:29): 
Again, seeing the parallels between folklorists and community health workers is... I don't know about 
Aaron's history, but my history is I've always gotten jobs in places where I don't know anyone. 
Kenney Gould (00:39:42): 
Really? 
Elinor Levy (00:39:42): 
I'm from California, I'm from Oakland. 
Kenney Gould (00:39:45): 
Okay, cool. 
Elinor Levy (00:39:46): 
And since I left Oakland in 1995, I don't go back to live there. So I've always had to make a new set of 
friends. And inevitably that first base of friends would be folk artists which creates trouble with my 
bosses. Becuase those are the communities I work with. So I have to maintain this really careful balance 
to not be seen as favoring... The problem is when I get to a new job, I'm so...That's the focus. That I don't 
go anywhere else to meet people. So I can understand where that impulse to go over the line, that they 
don't see as a line, because it's the way things are done in their community. 
Kenney Gould (00:40:36): 
Exactly, yeah. 
Elinor Levy (00:40:36): 
Because they don't see that professionally, there's that line. 
Aaron Paige (00:40:43): 
Right. 
Kenney Gould (00:40:44): 
Right. And there's also for lack of better terminology, there's small mind, medium mind, large mind of 
looking at the situation. There's an outreach worker, I knew her father. Farmworker. Brothers, sisters, all 
working in the farms. And for me, my personal thing was, I want to get these people, the children of 
these guys, in working with me, because I think that they're the ones who can be more sympathetic to 
the folks that are coming in. Now that can be true, but also my sister and my nieces and nephews are 
still working and living on the farms and I'm going to take care of them. That's a little bit more of a 
priority. 
Elinor Levy (00:41:25): 
I would wonder if they would also have, the problem of having to prove that they haven't moved on, or 
they haven't moved away. They haven't... 
Kenney Gould (00:41:38): 
Yeah. They're distinct. 
Elinor Levy (00:41:40): 
That they haven't... "Oh, you got this job, so you think you're better than us." 
Kenney Gould (00:41:46): 
That's... Okay. 
Elinor Levy (00:41:47): 
That overcompensation. 
Kenney Gould (00:41:48): 
That's definitely a very big, important factor. Yeah, definitely. So I heard this joke in Spanish, and I don't 
know if it's useful or not, but, you know, the guy that told me was a Mexican, so I'm just repeating his 
words. I'm not saying it to be racist or anything, but there was a market where they were selling crabs, 
And there were American crabs and Chinese crabs and Mexican crabs. You heard the story? 
Aaron Paige (00:42:21): 
No, but it just reminds of...Anyway, the setup. 
Kenney Gould (00:42:24): 
Yeah. The setup. And American crabs had a tight lid on it. The Chinese crabs had a tight lid on it. And the 
Mexican crabs, the lid was off and... 
Aaron Paige (00:42:32): 
Because they pull each other down. 
Kenney Gould (00:42:33): 
You got it. That's right. That's right. 
Aaron Paige (00:42:35): 
There's a similar saying in Malaysia, actually. 
Kenney Gould (00:42:39): 
Oh really? 
Aaron Paige (00:42:40): 
A lot of my research has been focused, as an academic, on the Tamil diaspora in Malaysia. And so 
Tamil's talk about their community like that. So they say... 
Kenney Gould (00:42:49): 
The Tamils from... 
Aaron Paige (00:42:49): 
"We pull each other down." In the Malaysian Diaspora. 
Kenney Gould (00:42:53): 
From Sri Lanka into Malaysia? 
Aaron Paige (00:42:55): 
And Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu . 
Kenney Gould (00:42:56): 
Oh my gosh. Interesting. 
Aaron Paige (00:42:57): 
And they're the working class, underdog, highly marginalized population 
Kenney Gould (00:43:02): 
So, it's a similar kind of story. The crabs are pulling each other down. Because as soon they get too high, 
everybody else will pull them down. And so another thing about it is there's also all these economic and 
social leveling events that go on. Such as, people might make a lot of money, they'll be asked to be the 
Padrino, and they'll have to throw these big parties. "Okay, everybody's invited. We're all on the same 
level again" So nobody gets too high or too far without being pulled back, for better or for worse. 
Aaron Paige (00:43:35): 
You had mentioned knocking on doors. My question here is how does that door knocking happen? Or 
where is that door knocking happening? 
Kenney Gould (00:43:46): 
So, let's see. I'm just trying to think back, way back to how this kind of started. The first times, I'd have a 
reason to knock. "I'm looking for so and so. I'm looking for this person. He's got an appointment. I'm 
taking them to the clinic." The clinic provided that opportunity. And the Christian brother that I worked 
with, knew well. The clinic provides a service that people are asking for and need, and we're going to 
help them. But there's more to just getting people from point A to point B. And so you'll meet people in 
the supermarket. Now, when know people and you know, stuff, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, 
and outreach becomes... You just ride on the tailwinds. That's what happens after a while. But to get to 
that point, it takes a lot of work, and it's the long game. But now, if I want to do outreach, man, you got 
to be crazy if you think I'm going to just start all over knocking on doors, because I've already got this 
whole kind of social capital built up. So, I see the bus at the supermarket, the guys are shopping, before 
they leave, hop on the bus, give a presentation. You know what I mean? 
Kenney Gould (00:45:06): 
Things like that. Because you know the driver, you know half the guys on the bus, it's not that strange. 
You walk out from God knows where, you knock on the bus door, "Can I talk to your people?" "Who the 
hell are you? What's this all about?" Do people do that? Yeah, they do. But I think that in terms of my 
own personal style, it's way off the mark. I wouldn't do it. Occasionally, I'll be invited to ABCD schools to 
give a presentation, or Migrant Ed to give a presentation. Where did I ask to give a presentation 
recently? I can't remember. 
Elinor Levy (00:45:45): 
Well, it seems the program has been around long enough. 
Kenney Gould (00:45:48): 
This one? 
Elinor Levy (00:45:48): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (00:45:48): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (00:45:49): 
That knocking on doors is kind of old school. You don't need to do that anymore. 
Kenney Gould (00:45:56): 
Yes and no. So that's a really good point. So what happens is, we have a migrating population, and you 
have to change and move as the people change and move. So what's gonna happen is that those people 
that have settled, and it happens with every immigrant group, the one that was just there prior, the 
homeowners that are renting to the new guys. Right? And this is just what happens. The Puerto Ricans 
took a lot of blows when they moved up to New York. Some of them were able to get an education and 
move to middle class and professional jobs. When the Mexicans came in, they're the new guys on the 
block, and they're going to take a lot of blows. And some of the first blows they're going to get are the 
people that speak their language, right? And this is just part of the transition in America, the waves of 
immigration. And right now what's happening is we're in a totally different moment. So we've got 
people that have been here 20, 30 years and have families. And they've kind of established themselves. 
Sunk in their roots. Are they immigrants? Yeah. They're still immigrants. 
Kenney Gould (00:47:00): 
But then you've got these new people, especially for the last few years, Guatemalans, who don't speak 
Spanish. They really have to struggle to get in. And they will meet some of these Mexicans, and some of 
the people that have been around for a while, they'll have these cleaning services, and these are the 
first people they're going to hire, and they're going underpay and take advantage of. And it's like, "We 
went through that ourselves." And this is how the cycle works. So right now what's happened with 
farmworkers, remember I told you African American and Jamaican H2A workers, and then the Mexicans 
came and they were with families, and they kind of settled. And that's who the folks are we're seeing 
now, the people that are working here. Benny. Olga. Yaneli. They're a little bit more established. And the 
new folks are coming in, and they're Spanish speakers or Indigenous speakers. And now what's 
happened is the bosses have gone back to H2A, but they're bringing in H2A workers from Mexico and 
Central America. And so again, you have to change. What's the difference? Well, first of all, they may be 
family members, extended family members of the people that have been here or been doing the work, 
or from the same village. 
Kenney Gould (00:48:17): 
But they're only coming in here for a few months out of the year. Their needs are different, and they're 
going to get out here. And maybe next year they'll come back, or maybe they won't. So if you build a 
relationship with somebody, whatever it might be, they may not come back next year or the following 
year. And there'll be new people coming in. So you always have to have your ears and eyes open for 
those changes and those new people who are not part of the fold. And like I said in the beginning, 75 to 
80% of the farmworkers are not coming to the health center looking for services. And a lot of those are 
new people. And the people that are here, they know somebody or they're connected in some way. So 
that's why outreach, you have to be on your toes all the time. You can't become complacent. So 
knocking on doors is still important, but you have to be there. Because you won't even know these new 
guys are here if you're not there. If you're waiting in a clinic for them to show up, you'll never know. 
Aaron Paige (00:49:13): 
Does that mean visiting camps? 
Kenney Gould (00:49:15): 
You have to visit camps. Yeah. You have to go. That's the way I see it. There's a new guy. Alright, the new 
guy happens to be a godson of mine who came into outreach. He's now in the Ulster County clinic. And I 
helped him get the job. He grew up in a family, campesino family. Settled in Newburgh. His family got 
work in industrial jobs. He finished high school. He got a scholarship to college. Graduated from college. 
No connections to the professional world. "Okay, let me help you out. You need to do this, that, and the 
other, if you want to get this kind of job. And if I can help you get this job in outreach..." Well he gets 
into outreach, and the only training he's got is he did lan internship at, I don't want to drop names of a 
non-profit organization, but a lot of them they're sitting in the office waiting for the phone calls, waiting 
for people to show up, and you can't do that in farmwork outreach. You just can't, because you're gonna 
miss 80% of the people. And of those 80% of the people, there's all kinds of needs going on. That's why 
outreach still continues to be important, and you can never become complacent about it. You never get 
there. There's always going to be another challenge. 
Elinor Levy (00:50:37): 
It sounds like one of the challenges now is how to work with people who don't speak Spanish, who 
speak a dialect, and either don't speak any Spanish, and there's no one around. I know that happened in 
Kingston with the Kʼiche? 
Kenney Gould (00:50:53): 
Yes. Yes. Kingston's got a whole other series of issues. 
Elinor Levy (00:50:55): 
And finally, there seems to be enough people who speak K'iche and Spanish. And there was one guy 
who spoke English, K'iche, and Spanish. It's hard to find him because he didn't... 
Kenney Gould (00:51:10): 
How did they organize? Well, they basically organize themselves and they're doing it through now 
through this church. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but the, the point is, we see them sometimes 
as disconnected in terms of our way of seeing the world and our schema. When they look at the world, 
it looks quite different. They've got their own schema of who counts, who doesn't, what's important, 
what's not. And it doesn't really overlap with ours. And so part of it is, if you can, try and see the world 
as much as possible in the way that they see how it's organize. Even though you can't fully. But that's a 
really big, important step in it. So when you're actually approaching people, gently, you know, not 
aggressively... because theNew York voice is very aggressive. So you have to be just a little bit, you 
know, gently ease into it. And that's why I think it's the long game. And just take your time. 
Aaron Paige (00:52:15): 
What role, if any, has social media played in outreach, in your own work, in recent years? 
Kenney Gould (00:52:22): 
Really wonderful questions. I love it. These are all things that I'm not really good at. I don't have a 
Facebook page. So this is what I've discovered. Social media is important for a lot of people. But again, 
for people that can't read or write, they're left out. And during COVID, they're left out even more. So 
people, they're already marginalized. People who could not adapt to the changes, more marginalized 
and less within that loop or sphere of getting into services. But another thing is that social media... One 
of the stories I really like is, when the first iPhones were coming out, these guys on the farm bought 
them. And they spent hundreds of dollars, and they're making pennies compared to what these phones 
cost. Brand new phone and what do they do? "Hey, what what's going on over there?" "Not much, 
what's going on over there?" What are you doing with it? Right? But now, you've got people connected 
to Facebook and sending pictures. From a social worker perspective, what's happening is that you're 
always taking pictures of yourself, having fun, great time, a lot of good friends around you. And it makes 
other people feel like "I'm isolated, I'm lonely, I'm left out." Horrible stuff. But this is like television. 
When it came out, "Look this could be a great learning tool." What is it really about? Well, it's the... 
What's that guy who did that circus daytime TV and soap operas. That's really what everybody wants to 
see. That's what fascinates the hell out of us. Social media could be a great instrument to do these 
things, but I think it's just become a circus. 
New Speaker (00:54:08): 
And so people get trapped into that circus. And, of course, I've also had a lot of people who break up 
with their boyfriend, girlfriend, you know, and abuse, because "I saw a picture with so and so on social 
media, and you know..." "This person's posting that, and they're making comments." "And did you see 
these texts?" 
Aaron Paige (00:54:29): 
But not that critical in the work of health outreach. 
Kenney Gould (00:54:33): 
It could be. Just like TV could be really useful for educating. The reality is, if you give somebody, what 
was that? Maury Povich or... People are going to gravitate to the lowest common denominator, sex, 
violence, all the things that we're not supposed to be doing and watching. 
Elinor Levy (00:54:54): 
But also with TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, isn't there a limit on TikTok of how long you can be? And 
let's face it, medical issues or not, TikTok, you can't get deep. And that's the problem. If you can't get 
deep then people are missing... Maybe they're going to miss that they actually are having that problem. 
Kenney Gould (00:55:24): 
You could. So the thing is about the social media and all those things, is that it's quite possible to use it 
for that. The reality is, how many people do? And there's so much distraction out there, how do you 
know what's legitimate and not legitimate? I think that's probably the biggest difficulty in terms of 
health. How are you going to treat your diabetes? I saw this website 
Person (00:55:48): 
Buenos dias. 
Kenney Gould (00:55:48): 
Buenos dias. 
Aaron Paige (00:55:48): 
I just have a couple other questions. I know you're... 
Kenney Gould (00:56:10): 
I'm good. I'm good. 
Elinor Levy (00:56:11): 
It's 10:44. 
Kenney Gould (00:56:12): 
You know what? I may have a little extra play time. 
Aaron Paige (00:56:15): 
When you were doing outreach work, you're on the front lines. You're learning a lot. You're probably, in 
some cases, seeing needs that haven't necessarily been seen before. Seeing changes in the field that the 
institution isn't necessarily seeing. I'm wondering what kind of feedback loop is in place that allows you 
to communicate that information back to the institution, so that they can also... 
Kenney Gould (00:56:51): 
Respond to those needs. 
Aaron Paige (00:56:52): 
Yeah. Is there a process? 
Kenney Gould (00:56:54): 
So you know, it's really great. The strength of any chain is really the weakest link. Because if you're 
pulling on a chain, it's always the weakest link that's going to break. So if you have some really good 
people in the chain, you can get a lot done. Just an example. So when COVID happened, nobody knew 
really, had a complete sense of the information, what's going on. People are getting it. There was Elba 
and Mirta. Mirta is a nurse manager. Elba was the practice manager able to make a shift to be able to go 
out to farms on the mobile unit, do COVID testing, do vaccines on site at the farms. And these are really 
necessary, important things. They're time sensitive things. You don't want to wait until two years later. 
Now we're gonna get it together because it takes that long for it to go through policy, create documents, 
workflow. So Mirta has been really good about that. Elba was really good about that. And of course, the 
players change too. You don't have somebody that's in charge forever and for always. So as those things 
change, we're in a new moment now. What's the need now? But that would be one of the ways. Does 
the system always respond? No, it doesn't. It's impossible to, because you're asking a big institution to 
turn on a dime, where one person can do it, ten people can do it. But a thousand people? It's not going 
to happen that fast. 
Kenney Gould (00:58:29): 
Takes a lot. Another thing about working in migrant health is that the needs of the migrant population, 
totally different from the needs and demands of established semi-urban or town population. It seemed 
to be that as our productivity would go up in the summer, they'd say, "Oh my gosh, we need to get more 
hours at that clinic." And we'd get more hours. And then of course in the winter, it'd drop off ,and 
they're like, "Oh no, we've got some big challenges." It's like, no, this is the seasonal nature of the work. 
But if you don't know that cycle, then it looks like, "Oh my God, what the hell's going on?" So there's had 
to have been some adaptations. But it doesn't really work with the flow of an established, ongoing day-
by-day clinic that has this kind of incremental increase in growth. The migrant seasonal workers, it 
doesn't work like that. But what'll happen is if you lose touch with those migrant seasonal people, you'll 
have a nice steady flow all year long, but you're going to miss a really important population. 
Aaron Paige (00:59:38): 
That's an important point. 
Kenney Gould (00:59:39): 
Alright, Fernando. So another really interesting movement in terms of the way that migrant health has 
been carried out. Migrant health existed before the Medicaid program, through a policy signed by 
president Kennedy. The Migrant Health Act. And so what that meant was that the federal government 
was going to take responsibility for the healthcare of migrant farmworkers. Over time, the migrant 
health grant that this clinic gets folded into the community health center. So what you used to have was 
migrant health centers. Now they become part of community health centers. There's some really good 
things that happen, which is you have a stability. You can create the infrastructure such as electronic 
medical records. You can have a full-time staff, which you couldn't do with a seasonal clinic. 
Kenney Gould (01:00:41): 
There's some drawbacks, too. And the drawbacks are you're very administrative heavy. You're very 
infrastructure, maintenance-oriented. And you will miss a lot of people who are not easily able to 
integrate to those systems. And that's why outreach in the organization has kept outreach as an 
important part. Whoever comes into the leadership or into the management on lower levels, if they 
don't have that kind of orientation towards outreach, they don't really understand the importance of it. 
And so that is always also another challenge, because it's not just about reaching the people. It's also 
letting those people who are managing know that that's not the way that... 
Elinor Levy (01:01:32): 
Trusting the process that's in place. 
Kenney Gould (01:01:36): 
It doesn't always work that way. Does that make sense? 
Elinor Levy (01:01:39): 
Absolutely. 
Aaron Paige (01:01:39): 
Totally. Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:40): 
Way too much sense. 
Aaron Paige (01:01:42): 
The other two questions that I have, one was the day-to day. And then also just the shift from outreach 
work to social work. How outreach work has informed and maybe informed that decision in some way 
and shaped it. But maybe we'll get there in a bit. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:58): 
I would ask that question first, because the day-to-day is really different for him now. 
Aaron Paige (01:02:03): 
Oh, I meant the day-to-day as an outreach worker. 
Elinor Levy (01:02:05): 
Yeah. 
Aaron Paige (01:02:05): 
So if you could take us into...I know each day is probably different but what did a day as an outreach 
worker look like? Maybe two examples of that. 
Kenney Gould (01:02:18): 
So, this is a really interesting thing to keep in mind. And this is why I love working with the farmworker 
population. They're just the best people to work with, hands down. You go to any site and I'm like, "No, 
I'm happy with the farmworkers. They're just the best." Honest, hard working, just very sincere. So the 
thing is that these are all working people. Everybody's got a job. They're going to be working from 
sometimes sun to sun. And the only people you're going to see in the daytime are people who have 
appointments. And you're only going to go to appointments if you really have something that you need 
to be seen for, because you're not going to get sick time. You're not getting vacation time, and you're 
going to make the boss a little upset for having to miss out on work when everybody else is working. 
And maybe even the coworkers too, right? So when I'd come around, they'd be like, "Oh, you again?" It's 
like, yeah, but this person needs something. In the daytime, you would probably be doing more 
individual stuff for people who have fallen off of that wheel of being able to maintain and take care of 
things. But in the evening is when people get off of work, and that's when people need to get services. 
So it used to be farmworker services were after 12 noon, and they'd go on until way late at night. Now, 
it's hard to keep a staff when you're doing a nighttime clinic. And so we've had to add some 
modifications and changes in that. And there's been some changes. 
Kenney Gould (01:03:48): 
We're open here tonight until eight o'clock, which is really good. But you're not going to keep a doctor 
four nights a week working until eight o'clock. Especially if you got kids or whatever. You know how it is. 
At nighttime is when you'll get people into the clinic who will not take the day off of work, but it's also 
the time to reach people at home. So you'll go make home visits. And when you make a home visit, 
people love it when you come with things like giving out condoms. Or sometimes you got giveaways. 
You'll see other people from other organizations like Migrant Ed or Farmworker Legal Services. There's 
many organizations around. That would be like the nighttime. When I was doing it, it was like three 
nights a week. And I'd often get home after 10 o'clock at night, which was tough on the family. I'm not 
doing that kind of schedule anymore. But I do stay here until eight o'clock at night on Thursdays. Even 
though I don't get out of work at eight o'clock. I get out after because I've got to do my paperwork, and I 
don't get home until 10 o'clock at night, often. But it's only one night a week instead of three or four 
nights a week. 
Elinor Levy (01:05:08): 
But again, it's meeting them where they are. 
Kenney Gould (01:05:10): 
Exactly. 
Aaron Paige (01:05:10): 
Yeah. 
Kenney Gould (01:05:10): 
Makes no sense. I can stay here nine to five. First of all, I'll only get those people who probably have 
health insurance anyway and don't have a job or can get out of work to come. 
Elinor Levy (01:05:26): 
Last year in Kingston they were doing strategic planning for the city and everything. The people hired to 
do the arts and culture asked, because I've been working on a Latino study, "Well, how do we get the 
Latino population to participate?" And I said, "That's really easy. You have to do your focus groups at 
night." "Oh, we only work till five o'clock." 
Kenney Gould (01:05:50): 
There you go. You just lost everybody. 
Elinor Levy (01:05:52): 
Unless you do it at night or on a Sunday with the churches, you're not gonna get anyone and guess 
what? 
Kenney Gould (01:05:59): 
They didn't get anybody. You're right on. And that's the way it is. That's the way it is, for sure. 
Elinor Levy (01:06:08): 
So the last question that he had, and I guess my last question is, what was the decision to transition 
from outreach to LCSW? And what has that been like? 
Kenney Gould (01:06:24): 
First of all, I want you guys to know that my favorite job in the world was doing outreach, and it still is. I 
love the job. I love what I did. It didn't feel like work. I just loved it. I still do. I had a college degree when 
I came in. It has nothing to do with my coworkers, some of them, not even having a high school degree. 
It's not really relevant. The pay was not really good. Listen, my whole family and I, we qualify for 
Medicaid and food stamps. And because of that, my kids got really good scholarships. That wasn't a 
problem for me. Of course, when you start making more money, then you fall out of all those benefits 
and life can be really difficult. And right now it's like, "Oh God, man. I love what I did. What did I do? 
What was I thinking?" Part of the decision was not entirely mine. But another part was. So I'm going to 
have to say, there's a couple of answers for that. One is, my poor wife, we have five kids together. We 
took a time off from outreach and we went down to Mexico with Maryknoll from 2004 to 2007. We 
were in Oaxaca. When we got down there, we had three kids. Getting them into school and stuff, it was 
a little bit of a chore. But then she got pregnant. And we weren't looking to have any more kids. And she 
had two more kids, because she had twins. It was a total shock. It was awesome. Yeah. Thank you. But it 
was really rough, too. So I think she had a really hard time with it. I'm one of six kids. She's the younger 
of two. 
Kenney Gould (01:08:22): 
So it's been tons of adjustment. When we were coming back from Mexico, they said, "You want your old 
job back?" I said "I'd love my old job back." And I stepped right into it. By the way, when I was in Mexico, 
I worked with a doctor, and I was doing outreach. I'd work in the little towns outside of Oaxaca, on the 
Hills that were basically houses made out of whatever wood scraps and metal you could find, kind of 
tacked together. And I got to go door-to-door to spend time with families. I was part of a process doing 
an interview of, "What's your lifestyle like? What's this and that?" Kind of like what you guys are doing. 
And then at the end of the interview, I got to ask this question: "So if you could have three 
improvements to this neighborhood, what would it be?" Well, some people would say, "Oh, I'd like to 
get this road paved because they're all dirt roads up in the Hills." And by the end of the three years, 
wouldn't you know they paved the road. Had nothing to do with my questionnaire. But when I go there, 
people thought that I had a lot to do with them getting pavement on the roads. I just stepped right into 
it, right? And that's what outreach work is. You know you may not make those changes happen, but 
when they do, you're right there. You know what I mean? So anyway, my wife was not working. Our 
income's not very good. We struggled to make ends meet. The winters could be tough. I do have a 
desire to learn more and advance personally. I'm still learning. You never can learn it all. There is just so 
much more to learn. 
Kenney Gould (01:10:07): 
And I really feel like that right now. It's like, oh God man. Sometimes, you know, there's professional 
_____. I need to know much more before I can properly deal with this situation. But we have what we 
have at this moment, and we've got to do the best we can with what we've got. My wife, she really 
wanted me to advance more professionally. And there's good reasons for it. Because she wasn't 
working. Our income was low, and our retirement was nothing. What social security is going to provide. 
And so I started applying to schools. It was like hit or miss. I wasn't really driven and motivated. I was 
enjoying what I was doing. And so, I got into Hunter. The school of social work. And that was back in 
2012. And then another thing, there were a couple of incidents where because of my position, and I 
think I had a lot of respect from my coworkers, and maybe even some other people on the upper 
echelons of the organization who I worked with...But in any organization and in any situation, you will 
have people on the higher levels taking advantage of people on lower levels, and not even being aware 
that they're taking advantage and getting a lot of mileage out of it. And you really feel like you're being 
used. 
Kenney Gould (01:11:36): 
So that was a part of it. She felt that if I didn't do something to advance my status, that I was being 
played. Now, I don't really feel like I was being played all the time or in every situation. And maybe there 
were a couple times that I did. But the most important thing was, for me, that I really enjoyed what I 
was doing and felt it was meaningful. So when I went to school and I had to do my internship, I actually 
internshipped at Sun River for social work. Social work is this big broad field. And the way that we work 
at the health center is pretty much focused. Another reason why I wanted to go into it, and this just 
happened to do with my background in LA, was I encountered people with severe mental illness. I lived 
in skid row for a few years too. Severe mental illness was a big deal, and the existing resources were 
pretty minimal. Well imagine for farmworkers. They're like almost nonexistent. And then when you do 
get them plugged in, there's just this big disconnect about how to manage it. So dealing with the 
farmworkers in mental health, this is the system we've got. And so I've had to accommodate to the 
system to a certain extent. But there is a really big disconnect on what is really helpful in terms of 
mental health and how we've organized ourselves, and how we deliver mental health stuff. And it really 
doesn't need to be like that. 
Elinor Levy (01:13:23): 
I worked in a mental health halfway house for several years, and how mental health is viewed by 
different cultures. 
Kenney Gould (01:13:30): 
Exactly. 
Elinor Levy (01:13:31): 
And this was in Davis, California. This was in Woodland. 
Kenney Gould (01:13:34): 
Oh, okay. 
Elinor Levy (01:13:34): 
Any Latinos we got were most likely going to be farmworkers. 
Elinor Levy (01:13:40): 
And we got one, one year. I'll never forget it. And she heard voices, which is not necessarily a bad thing 
in the Latino community. And they were saints. Again, not so bad except for trying her to prostitute her 
daughter. That's where we drew the line. But you have to understand that. You can't approach it, voices 
are bad, because in some communities hearing voices is not inherently bad. 
Kenney Gould (01:14:12): 
Super interesting. There is a cultural element to it. 
Elinor Levy (01:14:15): 
Or even the confession. When I worked in Las Vegas, my assistant was Zapotecan. And the church where 
she went, they took the Latino priest away. They reassigned him and gave them a priest who spoke 
Spanish, and the diocese didn't understand why that was an issue. And so they had to get together. My 
understanding is, from her, confession is different, how it is approached by a priest who's Mexican, and 
a priest who's anything else. 
Kenney Gould (01:14:55): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (01:14:58): 
Im sure African priests in Africa, their confession is probably very different. 
Kenney Gould (01:15:02): 
Totally different. Totally different. And you're right on. There's a lot more power and connection with 
people who have similar backgrounds to you, and that's just natural. And so that's why I'm kind of an 
outsider. To be able to get a different perspective, that may be difficult for other people to pull off, just 
because of the indoctrination and all that stuff. 
Aaron Paige (01:15:36): 
What an amazing resource you must be to the community that you're working with in this current role 
that you're in too. 
Kenney Gould (01:15:44): 
I love being able to, you know, where you feel like you can make a difference with people. And also in 
Spanish, which is really good and important. We do have a couple other Spanish speaking social workers 
in the agency, which is also really helpful. And I can always check in with them too about things. But the 
reality is, we're talking very minimal resources for mental health, and the need is just gigantic. And the 
first people who are going to get the services are people who are already in the system. 
Aaron Paige (01:16:22): 
There's no field component to what you're doing now? 
Kenney Gould (01:16:25): 
No. In fact, it's really discouraged, because it's the professional boundaries business. And so that's why 
they moved me from Ulster county to here, because I don't have any God children here or compadres 
here. So I have this profession, I'm sort of dressed up today. You dress up and you sit in the office, and 
you...Filling that role, does it feel authentic to me? Not always, you know. But the thing is that there's a 
remove, whereas people will show up to my house all the time for the other stuff. In fact, even though I 
left the role, I'll still get people showing up at my house for things. 
Aaron Paige (01:17:09): 
And you're still helping, working with them? 
Kenney Gould (01:17:10): 
Well during COVID, interestingly enough. So these agencies in Ulster county, like United Way, discovered 
that all those people who were getting financial assistance and rental assistance in the beginning were 
all these people who were already in their systems. And they were noticing a lack of Spanish speaking, 
Spanish surnames. Somebody reached out to me and said, "Do you do you know any organizations or 
anyway to get help?" And I said, "Well, let me see what I can do." And of course, I found people who had 
been laid off, out of work, whatever. And these are all pay-their-rent-kind-of-people. So the United Way 
gave me this money through the organization that I was working with. And because of that, things 
started changing for me, and St. Joseph's Church in New Paltz, also very supportive, said, "Hey, we'd like 
to help you in doing this and maybe that." So I said, "I would be willing to reduce my hours at work." 
Because also what happened during COVID is all the video appointments, which for me, was really 
impersonal. It was literally, I had this terrible pain all here in my chest. I don't know if it was the way I 
was using the computer, or the stress or whatever it was. Isolated from other people who you're 
supposed to be working with. I really wanted to reduce my hours. So I reduced my hours to three days a 
week. And the other two days a week, I'm doing outreach work in Ulster county with the farmworkers. 
Actually last Sunday, we had a scholarship event for families of kids grown up in the farm that are going 
on to education beyond high school. So I'm doing things like that. That really charges my batteries, you 
know? 
Aaron Paige (01:19:08): 
And what umbrella is that under? 
Kenney Gould (01:19:09): 
Reaping the Harvest, it's called. It's an all volunteer organization. Low budget. 
Elinor Levy (01:19:17): 
That's amazing. 
Kenney Gould (01:19:17): 
So that's been really exciting. So anyway, I'm able to do more outreach, home visits. So I do that in 
Ulster County. And then occasionally I get people at my work and I'll say, "Look, man, I can't see you 
professionally because you come over to my house. "I can't do that. We had a beer together last week. 
We're not going to do that." So I can't do that. But if I reduce my days to three days a week, I can see 
everybody else and be the guy that's the professional who knows what he's doing. Listen, we're all doing 
the best we can with what we got right now. And I don't know it all. I'm still learning. There's so much 
more to learn and it's going to keep going. But in my role as the social worker, I have to have a certain 
level of, "Yeah, I know what I'm doing." I got this. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:12): 
And distance. 
Kenney Gould (01:20:13): 
And distance. Yeah. It's kind of hard for me though, because as human beings, we feel sympathetic, and 
people affect you. And at the same time, you affect other people too. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:32): 
Is that it? 
Kenney Gould (01:20:32): 
We're done. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:33): 
We're done. 
Kenney Gould (01:20:33): 
Alright. I hope it was useful. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:36): 
Oh my goodness. It was so, so helpful. 
Kenney Gould (01:20:38): 
You know, it's so, so rare that I get a chance to be able to share some of the stories and thoughts on this 
stuff. And when I do, having people that are interested, so thank you guys for being interested. 
Aaron Paige (01:20:50): 
Thank you so much.
