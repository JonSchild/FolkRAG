SH – Shahzad Hafeez (Interviewee) 
 
 
CT: We are here at Bollywood Salon in Queens in the Elmhurst, New York on 
Broadway Avenue. It is August 8th and it’s 1:50pm. I am here with Shahzad 
Hafeez. Can you state your full name and the number of years you’ve been doing 
hair? 
 
SH: Shahzad Hafeez, my name, and I went to beauty school in ’90 so I guess 
twenty-two years I’m doing hair now.  
 
CT: Talk about where you’re from and all the places that you’ve lived. 
 
SH: I come from Pakistan and I was born and mostly raised there and I lived in 
Utah my first four, five years in the US.  
 
CT: Where in Utah? 
 
SH: Logan, Utah. 
 
CT: Is that near Salt Lake? 
 
SH: Near Salt Lake about ninety miles west of Salt Lake City. I went to school 
over there.  
 
CT: So was that a culture shock? 
 
SH: Very much so. In fact when I was on the plane from New York to Logan, 
Utah, somebody asked me, “Do you know where you’re going?” I said, “I know 
I’m going to the University in Logan, Utah.” But I had no idea, for me, America 
was all one big country. So yeah, Logan, Utah was a very beautiful small town by 
 
2 
the canyon but I had no idea about the Mormons and it was predominately a 
Mormon state. 
 
CT: Why were you there? 
 
SH: I had a friend who was going to school there and he was the one who sort of 
motivated me, initiated me to go to University over there because he really liked it 
and he said the school was good so I just kind of followed him. 
 
CT: And how old were you? 
 
SH: I was in my late teens early 20s.  
 
CT: Were you “out” as a Muslim? Did you practice as a Muslim?  
 
SH: Yes, I grew up, I was born as a Muslim and I’m still a Muslim.  
 
CT: Did you feel free…in terms of the Mormon culture there, did you feel like it 
was an issue at all?  
 
SH: Personally, frankly speaking, I never felt that. Of course a few times when I 
was estaying in the dormitory some of the Mormons would come in and invite you 
to visit the temple or just [tell you] about the Mormon religion itself. But I never 
found them offensive. It was kind of like an introduction. To me it was perfectly 
fine. It was like getting to know the culture. I stayed in Logan, Utah and attended 
the university there, Utah State University. I graduated from there in 1983.  
 
CT: What did you study? 
 
SH: Mechanical Engineering. 
 
CT: So how did you become a hairdresser?  
 
SH: It was by accident. It was never a part of the plan. Even though I grew up 
liking every aspect of beauty or design, or color. I was very art inclined. I studied 
engineering because we had a family business back home in Pakistan, it was a 
manufacturing set up we had and me being the elder of the boys I was initiated or 
motivated to study engineering so I could be part of the set up. 
 
CT: Where did you go after Utah? 
 
SH: After Utah, I went to a town called Rolla, Missouri. It was about 80 miles 
from St. Louis. It was a small engineering-oriented university. University of 
Missouri at Rolla and I did my Master’s over there in Engineering Management. 
Soon after I graduated from Utah, I went home for a year and then after a year, I 
was in Missouri. I graduated with my Master’s in ’86, ’87. 
 
CT: Did you stay in Missouri? 
 
 
3 
SH: No, I moved back home, and I stayed in my country until about 1990. I was 
helping with the family business, the manufacturing set up we had, the industry we 
had. Also in between I worked for a bank for a year so I had another job in an 
engineering firm and then in 1990, I came back into the United States. First I was 
in Arizona, I was staying with my brother in Phoenix, Arizona. A friend of mine 
invited me to New York. I must say I was very, very frightened to come to New 
York. I said, “No, I don’t think I want to be in New York.” 
 
CT: Was this in the ‘90s? 
 
SH: It was 1990. I pretty much had no idea about New York at all so I took up the 
offer and I came to New York to see my friends who lived in Brooklyn. I stayed 
with them for…I guess I was only supposed to stay for two weeks and now I guess 
it’s [been] twenty-two years off and on in New York. 
 
CT: So what was that experience like? Were you in an area that had more 
Pakistani culture? What was the neighborhood like? 
 
SH: It was an Italian neighborhood — Carroll Gardens I didn’t see any Pakistani’s 
there. I think the Pakistani’s were further up, maybe like Coney Island. There was 
quite a Pakistani neighborhood in Coney Island. But I wasn’t so motivated or 
interested to venture out to Coney Island. I think I was part of the Americana. It 
was not conscious or unconscious. It was just natural to be there the time I was 
there. So I enjoyed living in Carroll Gardens, it was a beautiful neighborhood and I 
believe it’s still a nice neighborhood. There were nice pastry shops. And I was 
going to beauty school. In 1990, that’s when I decided to go to beauty school.  
 
CT: Did you ever work in the engineering field? 
 
SH: Yes, I did.  
 
CT: Did you not like it? 
 
SH: I liked it. It was fine. It’s just that when I was in New York in 1990, I was 
looking for work in engineering and I was having a hard time, there was some sort 
of recession going on and my friend who I was staying with suggested....I said,  
“I’ve always been interested in beauty and I’ve always looked at women’s fashion 
magazines and he said, “Well why don’t you develop another skill? Look for work 
in engineering…” I checked into it and it was quite a decision though because I 
know once I set myself to something then I’ve got to finish it. So I looked into it 
and of course I called up my brother, my family and said that I want to study, to 
go to beauty school, they were of course extremely surprised. [they said] “Why 
would you want to do that? After studying so much you just want to become a 
barber or somebody who cuts hair for a living?” They didn’t really understand 
that. Anyway I went ahead and joined the Wilfred Academy in Manhattan. It was 
a beauty academy and a year later, the end of 1990, early 1991 I finished my 
cosmetology school and [received] my license. And from that day on to this day, 
I’ve been doing hair. 
 
 
4 
CT: Have you had any regrets? 
 
SH: Well I often wonder in my destiny, what was the engineering for? But I guess 
maybe I’m a better person, the fact that I went to engineering school. Because 
everything I believe in [a] sense, you’re not a victim of anything. It’s a place where 
you wanted to be so I think that engineering definitely makes me a better person. 
Maybe if I wouldn’t have gone to engineering school, there would have been 
something missing in my life so I think somehow it fits into the picture. 
 
CT: Had you ever done hair before? 
 
SH: Yes, I used to cut my friend’s hair. I grew up playing with dolls. I would do 
their hair. I used to also do my mom’s hair and my sister’s hair. I guess if it was 
not the industry, the manufacturing industry with the family, I would have gone to 
an art school because naturally I was more inclined towards arts than mathematics 
or science. But hard work made me learn that too.  
 
CT: You kind of found your calling. 
 
SH: Yeah. 
 
CT: I know you went to school at the … 
 
SH: Wilfred Academy. 
 
CT: And then you went to Bumble and bumble.  
 
SH: Yeah right. 
 
CT: So you went to Wilfred and graduated. Did you start working after that? 
When did you go to Bumble and bumble? 
 
SH: Well at Wilfred Academy…different salons would come and interview people 
to take people on an apprenticeship. So I was interviewed by Bumble and bumble 
while I was at Wilfred Academy. There were two people selected from my class 
and I was one of them. I was really thrilled in 1991 to be picked up by Bumble and 
bumble because it was such a huge salon and they had so much success and all 
that. So as soon as I finished Wilfred Academy, I went to Bumble and bumble, in 
between I did join another salon for a short period, but Bumble and bumble was 
my really my first job in NY.  
 
CT: And what year was that? 
 
SH: I would say 1991.  
 
CT: Was Bumble and bumble an actual academy or a salon?  
 
SH: It was an actual salon. You joined it as an assistant. As you assist, you trained 
also. There were five days of work, six days of work and then you have a training 
 
5 
class as your reward as working as an assistant and you do get paid also as an 
assistant.  
 
CT: So how was that different because then you went to Vidal Sassoon?  
 
SH: Right.  
 
CT: After Bumble and bumble? 
 
SH: After Bumble and bumble. Actually I stayed at Bumble and bumble a year and 
a month or something and then I quit Bumble and bumble and I joined Vidal 
Sassoon.  
 
CT: Why did you quit? 
 
SH: At that time, I wasn’t too happy with the cutting program at Bumble and 
bumble. I didn’t find it very structured. It was very kind of free…and I felt that I 
needed more structure so I could see exactly where I was. I checked into Vidal 
Sassoon. And Vidal Sassoon had a wonderful program for their trainees. So I went 
in for an interview, there were about thirty people for an interview to join in as an 
assistant. Again, I was selected among two or three people. And I started my 
apprenticeship, I guess a week later at Vidal Sassoon and I must say that I was 
extremely satisfied and happy with the way my training went at Vidal Sassoon. 
 
CT: Out of all the schools? 
 
SH: Out of all the schools I went to. It was basically a salon training. I didn’t go to 
the Academy, I was part of the salon and you finish your training with the salon 
and you become a hairdresser or a colorist. It’s much more intense and much more 
strict because when you finish training you start working in that salon. If you’re 
fresh from beauty school it takes about two to three years to become a stylist or 
colorist at [Vidal] Sassoon. 
 
CT: And you make how much? 
 
SH: You make minimum wage while you’re apprenticing as an assistant in the 
salon and that’s the price you have to pay. It’s tough. It’s very tough because you 
don’t make much money at all. 
 
CT: Well the idea is that once you graduate and become a stylist and you become a 
stylist there right? Or the fact that you’re trained by Vidal Sassoon, does that mean 
if you go to other salons that you get a higher… 
 
SH: Well, if there is an opening at the location you’re training then you are hired 
there but if you finish your training and there is not an opening at that time they 
will send you to another location, in the city or in the nation. 
 
CT: And then what would you make, roughly? 
 
 
6 
SH: At that point, I’m talking like ’93 when I was at Vidal Sassoon, I think at that 
point, once you graduate in the salon as a hair colorist or a hair stylist. I would say 
you would start off at thirty something [thousand a year] and then it depends on 
your capabilities [and] how soon you’d make your clientele and then it’s all up to 
you. They do give you a base salary as a hairdresser every week and then your 
commission.  
 
CT: So how did you get to Bollywood Salon? 
 
SH: I’m afraid it was unfortunate that I couldn’t really complete my program at 
Vidal Sassoon, after staying there like a year and two months or something, I had 
to move back to Pakistan because of [a] family emergency and I ended up staying 
in Pakistan from ’93, ’94 to 2000, a period of approximately five to six years. Back 
home I worked out of my house. I was helping my dad also because the industry 
unfortunately was winding up and my dad wanted my help.  So I felt that while I 
was in Pakistan [phone ringing several times so he went to answer it, we discuss 
the possibility of turning the ringer off but he said he didn’t want the owner to 
“scream at me” So we left it on].  
 
So I felt that I worked really well with Southeast Asian hair because I was 
practicing that in Pakistan, the years I was there and I could be useful and I could 
really have fun with it. So I thought maybe I should find a place that attracts all 
the Southeast Asians and I can do their hair because I also developed a palate for 
make-up, for hair and make-up, especially for bridal [Indian] ceremonies. So I 
wanted to do that as well which I found that I might not have enough exposure at 
Damian West regarding the Southeast Asian market. I wanted to do the Southeast 
Asian market also, so I opted to work part-time at Damian West and that search 
led me to visit Jackson Heights. I came to Jackson Heights and looked at the local 
salons that were there and I met the owner of the Bollywood Salon. He was also 
working at one of the salons. Back then it was called Bombay Salon. So I talked to 
the owner and the owner was thrilled because of my training and my previous 
exposure, he was thrilled to have me on board. So I joined Bombay Salon part-
time, two or three days a week, especially on the weekends, where I could do some 
wedding work, because most of the weddings concentrated on the weekends. And 
if I was not doing a wedding then I would just do hair work. At that point we 
didn’t have much women cutting their hair in that salon. It was more for eyebrow 
threading and waxing and a lot more barbering was going on, generally men 
would come in and get their hair cut. So I started off, I would introduce myself to 
women who were there to have their eyebrows threaded and I would let them 
know of my expertise they would eventually sit in my chair and I would cut their 
hair.  
 
CT: And what year was this? 
 
SH: This was I guess 2000, 2001.  
 
CT: So the threading has been happening for… 
 
SH: I think even before, yeah. 
 
7 
 
CT: So now it’s really trendy? What happened? 
 
 
SH: It’s really picked up. Back then I don’t think there were many salons in 
Manhattan doing threading and now I guess it’s really common and threading has 
become an established means of doing the eyebrows and removing hair from the 
face area. It has really picked up and there are salons basically just doing threading 
only. 
 
CT: Talk a little bit about Indian hair and how it is different structurally than 
European hair or African hair. Do you know about the anatomical structure of 
Indian hair? 
 
SH: I think the inner structure is the same, it’s just the quantity might be more and 
the way the cuticle lies on Indian hair, that might be different and maybe that has a 
lot to do with the way the weather is, the way it’s formed. Indian hair can be 
anywhere from very curly to straight. More than hair it’s about determining what 
is the standard of beautiful hair. I think hair is just a medium and it might be 
common in every race. But I think most important is how did they conceive it [to 
be] beautiful? So if you’re from a certain culture, every culture has its beauty icon 
and other aspects of it, maybe color, maybe the way it falls, the way it falls around 
the face, the length or the whatever, so that you have to be really familiar with and 
once you’re familiar with that then you can play with the hair, which is a medium 
to make it go in that direction and then the most important is to be able to 
understand what the client wants as in for their hair and that has a lot to do with 
what they grew up with looking or finding beautiful. And that could be style, that 
could be actresses, or that could be just the folklore of that [culture].  
 
CT: Do you find that your clients want…you know say in Manhattan, Jennifer 
Aniston’s haircut was really popular say 15 years ago and everybody wanted that. 
Do you find that your clients want more American celebrity hairstyles or more 
Bollywood? 
 
SH: I think Bollywood…a lot of the fashion among Southeast Asian clientele 
comes from Bollywood. And I think Bollywood is also very, very influenced by 
Hollywood. So Jennifer Aniston’s hair, it was a worldwide phenomenon and 
everybody wanted Jennifer Aniston’s hair but maybe how that would transform 
into their hair and their look. 
 
CT: Even in Indian culture? 
 
SH: I think I’ve done Jennifer Aniston’s version of hair as long as I can remember. 
It was such a huge phenomenon, the way it fell the way the layering fell around the 
face and the shoulders. I did millions of versions of that hair but an Indian version 
of that. 
 
 
8 
CT: So how do you do that? What are the challenges? If you were doing a 
European woman’s hair, what changes would you have to implement to make that 
work on Indian hair? 
 
SH: I think Jennifer Aniston being a European or American or whatever, the hair 
texture, I mean to say, that hair [style] was created on that hair, on that medium. 
So Indian hair is very different from somebody like Jennifer Aniston’s hair, so as a 
hairstylist you’ve got to bring that, transform that look with a medium which is 
different from one that was created on but somehow make it look…maybe not like 
that, or maybe inspired by that?  
 
CT: So what is the biggest challenge? I’m assuming that Indian hair is heavier? 
 
SH: Definitely heavier. It falls different. And somehow the cut has to work for the 
features also. Indian features are very different from…Southeast Asian features are 
different from other people or other populations. So it has to somehow 
complement that. At the end of the day the hairstyle has to complement the 
person’s face or their personality.  
 
CT: How are their features different? 
 
SH: I would say every race has its own specialty. I wouldn’t say different, different, 
it’s just another variation of human form but very similar within the...  
 
CT: It seems like in Southeast Asian culture, especially with make-up, the eyes are 
very important. 
 
SH: Yes, I think you’re right. The eyes have…I guess the way the whole race has 
evolved the eyes are a bit more almond shaped they’re not as deeper set and the 
shape is a combination of a few races, a few kinds of people who’ve traveled to 
India. And I believe back in the day there are so many kinds of people who travel 
to India from Alexander’s army to the Arab traders to the Turks to the Europeans 
to the Africans to everyone and I think that India there is a huge spectrum of 
different looks right from the fairest yellow-toned skin, or the cooler/warmer tone 
skin to the darker tone. So we have everything in India in terms of the skin tone. 
 
CT: How curly does the hair get? 
 
SH: I think generally speaking, I would say India, because I personally feel that we 
are the Indian race whether we are in Pakistan or Bangladesh we are basically the 
Indian race from that subcontinent. South Indian’s tend to have curlier hair. 
Northern Indians have a mix of straight…then again, it’s the influence of all the 
people who have passed through that region. North Indians I would say are the 
most mixed Indians. So there’s a variety of hair, there’s straight hair, there’s curly 
hair, there’s wavy hair, but generally North Indians tend to have wavy, wavy/ 
straight and South Indians generally have curly, coarse thick hair. 
 
CT: So is there a preferred texture? 
 
 
9 
SH: As a hairdresser, I always motivate my clients to see the beauty in what they 
have. Because I personally believe there’s beauty in all kinds of texture, of looks 
and everything. I don’t generally like to work…let’s say the client has curly hair I 
will try to give her a hairstyle that will complement her own texture, may be curly 
or straight so that it can look beautiful in its own natural form. That is my aim. 
 
CT: I agree as well but do you find culturally, is there a preference? 
 
SH: I guess I have generally seen that since Indian clothes have embellishments and 
are very colorful and a lot of work…hair that does not have so much movement, 
that’s there but does not have a strong presence kind of works well with the whole 
ensemble and kind of complements better. 
 
CT: So is it sprayed? Is that how it doesn’t move?  
 
SH: Most of the time I see they get it blow dried straight. If they have curlier hair 
they prefer to have it blow-dried straight if they’re going out or wearing evening 
wear. Because maybe they don’t want the hair to have such a strong shape because 
the clothes have such presence and maybe they want to show the clothes or 
whatever. But there is a general tendency of getting the hair styled or straightened 
especially when they’re wearing an evening look or wearing party clothes or 
something like that. 
 
[A woman came into the salon and another associate was talking to her. She was 
there to get her eyebrows threaded] 
 
CT: Can you think of other celebrities that were influential to hairstyles, either of 
Indian culture or American culture? 
 
SH: I think Hollywood celebrities, women or European celebrities, their hair and 
make-up has always been popular in the Indian film industry, which is Bollywood. 
Because of the media, now we can see exactly what trend or what’s happening in 
anywhere in the world. [Voices in the background getting louder] But back in the 
‘60s or the ‘70s or the early ‘80s when [internet] media was not really there, one 
wasn’t really aware of what was going on in the Bollywood film industry. In any 
country most of the time, fashion is led by popular actresses at that time. So of 
course in the ‘60s or ‘70s or ‘80s whoever were the popular actresses in India at 
that time in Bollywood the hair trends were followed by the common people. And 
at that time it was big hair, just like in the West, it was this big coiffed hair. And it 
was tough to do that because it was a lot of hair to handle and to make into the 
styles like the beehives or Audrey Hepburn’s hair in Breakfast at Tiffany’s but of 
course very much practiced in the Indian film industry. People may not be aware 
but all of these styles were very, very popular in India also. And even now, of 
course going back to your prior question, “Would they choose to have straighter 
hair?” I think if you look at all the popular actresses of Bollywood as of right now, 
I think maybe one has curly hair, they are always shown with straight-styled hair 
so I guess hence the follow up, that [straight hair] becomes a fashion icon. There is 
only one actress that I remember in the last couple of years who came in and 
showed her curlier texture, Kangana (Ranaut), she starred in this move and kept 
 
10 
her curly hair. She starred in a movie, the movie’s name was Fashion and she was a 
big hit with her curly hair. 
 
[The phone rings and more people come into the shop and we stop the interview 
because it’s too busy in the salon. The woman who was there to get her face 
threaded allowed me to photograph her.]
