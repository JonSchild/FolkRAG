Oh, we sport around the town,

Kind friends, your attention, 
And a 
story we'll relate ; 
It's about ourselves we're going to sing, 
And don't you think ' twas fate 
That brought us two together. 
Our styles are both the same, 
People can't tell us apart, 
Only by our names. 
CIIORUS. 
Now watch me sharp and catch this move, ( Break.) 
We're both alike, I'm going to prove. ( Break.) 
Now we hope you'll not complain, though 
We both do the same ; 
People can't tell us apart, 
Only by our names. 
You see now we both dress alike, 
From head down to our feet; 
That's what all the young girls say— 
All those we chance to meet. 
They all now do take us for twins, 
No doubt you think the same ; 
People can't tell us apart, 
Only by our names.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Original. 
Written and composed by BILLY M AYO, and originally sung by 
M AYO and FASH. 
TI E. 
Life is full of memories sweet, 
And every day some girls we meet 
That with coquettish glance of eye, 
Or, perhaps a 
loving sigh, 
Will cause our hearts to palpitate, 
Yes, such has been my fate. 
I 
first met Susie at a 
country dance, ( Break.) 
One glance did my soul entrance, ( Break.) 
Little hands and waist so neat, 
Oh, gently tripping fairy feet! 
Oh, how I 
loved each merry glance 
Of my Susie at the country dance ! 
SHE. 
Oh, dear, how can I 
ever tell 
You of that dear darling swell 
That at a 
country ball I 
met, 
His style and air I 
can't forget; 
For with one shy and loving look, 
From me my beating heart he took. 
He said," Dear miss, you waltz divine, ( Break.) 
Yes, skill and grace you both combine ;" ( Break.) 
His eyes so blue, and dress so neat, 
Oh, o't 
his figure tall and little feet 
I'll not forget, for I 
loved each glance 
Of my swell at the country dance. (Dance.) 
H E. 
I 
do declare, what shall I 
do, 
That looks like my dear charmer, Sue. 
SHE. 
Oh, stop, my heart, your beatings tell 
The one that's looking is my swell. 
TIE. 
I 
hope, dear Sue, I'm welcome here, 
SIIE. 
My heart, in answer, says yes, dear. 
HE 
Oh, ain't this happiness, my boys I (Break.) 
SHE. 
Earth can have no greater joys ! ( Break.) 
H E. 
Just see those eyes, and twig those feet. 
SHE. 
See that figure tall and dress so neat. 
Oh, how I 
love each merry glance 
Of my swell at the country dance!

Sweet Lido and Kitty Drew. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Original 
Written and comPosed by BILLY M AYO, and sung by M AYO 
and FASH in their original act, '' Colored Aristocrats.'' 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We've come to sing again; (Bang.) 
We'll try and give you something new. 
Dance all our might and main. ( Bang.) 
We'll knock each other all around, 
Until we're black and blue ; 
The crankiest coons that's in the World, 
Our equals they are few. 
CHORUS. 
So watch our acrobatic feats, 
Our steps they are not few ; 
There's no team yet that can compete, 
Now, ain't our business new ? ( Dance). 
It's just a 
week ago to-day, 
Our girls we went to see; ( Bang.) 
We asked them to marry us, 
They answered yes, with glee. (Bang.) 
But as it's time that we must go, 
Once more we'll sling the shoe ; 
And when we've done we'll visit our 
Sweet Lide and Kitty Drew. 
So watch, &c.

Success will Surely Crown You in the End. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Written expressly for BILLY MAYO by A. H. 
MORTON. 
If your path through life should be 
Full of thorns and misery, 
And disappointments meet you day by day, 
Do not discouraged be, 
You may happiness yet see, 
And your sorrows all be turned to pleasures gay. 
Then these words bear in mind, 
And in time you'll surely find 
That if success at first does not attain, 
Why, try and try again, 
If you would win a 
place among men, 
And success will surely crown you in the end. 
There's many a 
one to-day 
Idling precious time away, 
Who, if they put their shoulder to the wheel, 
Would then most quickly find 
That a 
calm, contented mind 
Is the greatest blessing that a 
man can feel.' 
Then, if riches you would enjoy, 
Faithfully your time employ, 
And if at first success does not attain, 
Why, try and try again, 
If you would win a 
place among men, 
And success will surely crown you in the end. 
Dancing in -de Barn. 
Sung by the great MAYo and FASH, in their original act, " Dancing for 
the Cake," at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
Olt, we'll meet at de ball in the evening, 
'Cause I 
love to pass the time away 
Wid Clementinia Constantinia, 
And my Angermia Mima May. 
Den we'll balance all to one another, 
Like de ship dat goes around de Horn ; 
Dar we'll meet you—yes, we'll greet you, 
While dancing in de barn. 
CHORUS. 
As we move so gracefully, ( Symp.) 
We're as happy as can be. ( Symp.) 
Den swing your partners altogether, 
'Cause now's the time for you to learn ; 
Music ringing, niggers singing, 
And dancing in de barn. 
Den we're off to work in de morning, 
Singing as we go out to de field, 
Picking cotton, all else forgotten 
Except to see how much de ground will yield. 
De black folks are happy while together, 
It's funny for to hear dem tell a 
yarn 
About a 
love wid kisses smother 
While dancing in de barn. 
As we move, &c. 
Poor Little Joe. 
As sung by BILLY M AYO, 
While strolling one night through New York's gay throw-
7, 
I 
met a 
poor boy—he was singing a 
song ; 
Although he was singing, he wanted for bread, 
Althougi. he was smiling, he wished himself dead. 
I 
spoke to this poor boy who was out on the street, 
I 
le had no place of shelter, nor had anything to eat ; 
No mother to guide him—in the cold grave lies low, 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Cold blew the blast, and down came the snow, 
Ni) place of shelter, nor nowhere to go ; 
Ni) mother to guide him—in the cold grave lies low 
Cast on the cold world was poor little Joe. 
A carriage rolled by with a 
lady inside, 
Sic fondly caressed her own darling child ; 
Joe followed the carriage—she not even smiled, 
As I 
looked on his face I 
saw that lie cried. 
lool;ed at this poor boy, and thought it quite odd, 
I 
lad this poor ragged ure'.iin been forgotten by God ? 
As I 
looked at the gaslight that fell on the snow, 
I 
saw the pale, deathly features of poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, & c. 
The lights had gone out, and the clock had struck One, 
When home came a 
policeman whose duty was done, 
And you'd think by the sound of his dull, heavy tread, 
That he was a-seeking the starving and dead. 
" 
Oh, what's this ?" ah, then the policeman he cried, 
'Twas poor little Joe—on the steps he had died ; 
With his face turned to lIeaven, all covered with snow, 
Died on the cold streets, did poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blasts, & c, - 
sweet Nosegay. 
Written by GEORGE FASH, of MAvo and FASH. 
When Flora decks the mantle bowers 
In elegant array, 
And scatters all the opening flowers, 
A 
compliment to May, 
With glowing joy my bosom beats, 
I 
gaze delighted round, 
And wish to see the various sweets 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis granted, and the bloom displayed, 
The treasure it is found ; 
I 
see them all, my beauteous maid, 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
The flowers blush and bloom each year 
The birds sing out their lay, 
The loveliness is in my dear 
When I 
am far away ; 
The roses blush whene'et she speaks, 
The lilies cease to bloom, 
The love which is but life to seek 
In one sweet nosegay bound. 
A 
Helping Hand. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Respectfully presented to BILLY MAYO by CHAR. P. DONNELEY. 
There are many sayings true 
That are known to me and you, 
Tho' perchance we have forgotten them, and yet, 
When a 
person has got means, 
flow easy then it seems 
That the sufferings of mankind we should forget. 
And now that pay is small, 
Some can get no work at all ; 
Many honest men are staiving through the land. 
So it's now I 
bring advice, 
For which I 
nothing charge in price, 
And my motto is— Lend a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
Then if riches you would gain, 
Or fame you would attain, 
Bear ia mind this noble maxim I 
command, 
And believe me wilen I 
say 
That in the end you'll find ' twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand. 
First we'll take an orphan boy, 
lie's no home he can enjoy. 
Ever since he can remember, he will say 
That his home has been the street, 
In winter cold and summer heat, 
Because his parents in a 
drunkard's grave did lay. 
Now I 
think you will agree 
With the idea held by me, 
That that poor boy should be allowed to stand, 
14 
A HELPING HAND. 
Con tinned. 
And in spite of croakers all, 
Who would his parents' sin recall, 
Every one should lend a 
helping band. 
IIORUS. 
For though it strange appears, 
Perhaps in course of years, 
That boy may be a 
credit to Rik land, 
If some one with kindly heart 
Would nobly take his part, 
And extend to that poor boy a 
helping hand. 
There is still another case, 
With which I'll bring you face to face, 
Thu its now we see it almost every day. 
'Tis when a 
widow, poor and old, 
Who has got no gold, 
In the street she's turned, her rent she cannot pay; 
While the grasping landlord be 
Looks on in silent glee, 
Throw her things in the street is his command. 
Oh what a 
world of good 
Some one could do if they would, 
By saying I'll lend to her a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
Now my little song is done, 
Tho' its true I've caused no fun; 
I 
hope you won't forget my motto grand, 
And believe me when I 
say 
That in the end you'll find ' twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand. 
WHERE YOU BEEN SO LONG. 
As sting by Goss and Fox. 
(Ile) 
Oh, where you been sister Hannah, 
Since I've been so long gone, 
(She) I've been out in the barnyard, 
Standing on my bead, 
But my body keeps a 
rolling on. 
(lie) 
Keep on standing. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'll rock and roll dem in your arms, 
Roll affil rock deni in your arms, 
Rock and roll dem in yuur arms, 
in de arms of Moses. 
Reprat. 
(She) Oh, where you been brother A 
ntfoony, 
Since l' ve been so long gone, 
(Ile) 
I've been traveling with a 
circus 
Playing with the monks, 
But itLy body keeps a 
rolling on, 
(She) Den keep on monkeying. 
Cllouus. 
Oh, we'll rock and roll dein in your arms. 
Roll mid rock dem in your arms, 
Rock and roll dem in your anus, 
In de arms of „Moses.

We'll all get Jolly as the Night Wears on. 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
error n, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown ; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily ing— 
Cum:us. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and hi ,1 
dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shout, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy 1,11b. 
And drown all your cares in a !Hass ; 
Let squeamish teetot'lers drink coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coopers they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, ; nd tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till Fin laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne ; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And thc.1 as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, & c. 
To fall deep in love with a 
sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
limit the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
has no great attraction for me ; 
At yonn :; 
Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll stick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And grily 
sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, & c. 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE BUGLES 
Written by Ned Goss. 
As sung by Goss and Fox. 
You may take me to the east, 
You may take me to the west, 
But I'll hear that bugle sounding in the morning, 
On the land or on the sea, 
No matter where I 
be, 
I 
will hear that bugle sounding in the morning. 
CIIORUS. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up to'ards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to'ard's the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Just at the nick of time, 
When we reach the dividing line, 
We will lwar that bugle sounditig in the morning, 
We'll see sinners on that day, 
Flop their wings and fly away, 
-When they hear that bugle sounding in the morning 
CHORUS. 
You will hear those sinners cry,. 
And look up to'ards the sky, 
r\rhen they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to'ards the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning.

I'M in love wi ii such a

And I

When I 
see him in his uniform so grand. 
The tirst time that I

With ove I

Oh ! my; but T

When Charley idays the drum. 
Oh ! he often comes to take me for a

And we stray along together side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovi gly he'll talk, 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev ry Thu: sday evening. 
As soon as work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Charley play the drum. And it's 
When the Birds Have Gone to Sleep. 
When the Purple Lilacs Blossom. 
Composed and sung by WILLIAM A. 
HUNTLEY. 
When the roses bud and blossom 
By the rippling river side, 
Where they gently nod and listen 
To the music of the tide : 
While the early stars are shining, 
In the far-off azure deep, 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep, 
In the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
How I 
long to hear you whisper 
All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above, 
Sweetest words to thee addressing, 
Loving arms around me creep, 
Could we evermore thus linger 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
Come to meet me, ea. 
Composed and sung by,WILLIAm A. HUNTLEY. 
When the purple lilacs blossom, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the robin and the bluebird 
Greet us with a 
sweet refrain? 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
CHORUS. 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling, 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
In the soft, &c. 
When in Heaven with the angels, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

Dedicated lo EmILE A IM 
by WILLIAM RADCLIFFE. 
Way down in ole Kentucky, many years ago, 
\\Thar I 
used to hunt de possum an' de coon, 
Whar de darkies ased to gather ' round an' hab a 
little dance, 
All' de banj-) an' de fiddle was in time. 
No more I'll bear doe merry sounds, or see dose days oh yore, 
Nor de little daikie; play in' on de green, 
Nor de merry smiles oh Rosie Lee, de only flower dat bloomed 
Near de little ole log cabin by de stream. 
CHORUS, 
Den hang up de fiddle an' de banjo on de wall, 
lay 
away de bones an' tambourine ; 
Since Death has taken off my Rose, the only flower dat 
bloomed 
Near dc little ole log cabin near de stream. 
I 
never, never shall forget those happy hours we spent, 
As we wandered together o'er de hill, 
Or sat beneath de willow an' watched de rollin' tide. 
Or listened to de clatter oh de mill. 
An' when de night was cumin' on, an' de dailies' work was 
done, 
How dey used to come an' gather on de green, 
An' de banjo an' de fiddle would make de forest ring, 
Near de little ole log cabin by de stream. 
Den hang up de fiddle, & e. 
De stream i; runo•ng just de : ame, de willows on its side 
Are now v‘aving o'er de grave of Rosie Lee ; 
'Tis dere I 
sit beside her grave to pass de hours away, 
An' v•onder when de same shall shelter me. 
My steps am growing feeble, my hair am turning gray, 
But still de grass am grow in' fresh an' green, 
An' here I'll wait till Death shall take me to my Rosie Lee, 
From my little ole log cabin by de stream. 
Den hang up de fiddle, &c.

Two Italians. 
Written by IluGI' FAY. and sung with success by Tu• RUSSELLS. 
We are two Italians, you see—that's all right, 
We work in the gas house one day and one night ; 
Them Irishmen wanted us for (-)
Ii di, 
So of course we had to swim 
', . 0. 
CHORUS. 
We handle our pick and our shovel, 
And we mind our own business, you see ; 
That pays better than picking them chestnuts, 
For two Italiati,, are we—that's so. 
Now we are going to work of the Park 
From seven of the morning until it is dark ; 
We feel just as happy like a 
little lark, 
For two Italians arc we—that's so. 
We handle our pick, &:c 
As soon as our day's work is over 
We take our hand-organ and seek 
Through the streets of this city all over, 
And earn a 
few dollars a 
week—that's so. 
We handle our pick, & c,

TWO LITTLE MEDI THAT JUST COME 
OUT, 
Written by Bonny KIRK, performed by KIRK & DRE*. 
ii
Oh! we are two hatniy little niokes, 
And we come from the sunny, sunny south. 
We're always gay and full of fun; 
You can tell it by looking at our mduths. 
For we sing and dance the whole (lay long, 
For we're happy, yes so happy, 
We're happy, yes so happy, 
For we'ro lke two little mokes that just come out. 
(Dance.) 
Oh! bro'her Pete and I, one day, 
Went out to see what we could see. 
And as we were going along, do lane, 
Brother Pete got stung with a 
bee. 
For I 
laughed just as loud us I 
was able, 
To see him kill de bee, 
fes to see him kill the bumble-bee, 
And I 
never will forret the bumble-bee.

Troublesome Wife. 
As sung by R. H UNTING. 
Is there any one here that has got a 
desire 
To wed with a 
troublesome wife? 
If they have, they had better put their head in the fire, 
And at once put an end to their life. 
When I 
married my love, I thought her a 
dove, 
But when married I 
wished myself dead, 
For in less than a 
week she got tired of love, 
And pulled all the hair out of my head. 
Oh, dear, & c. 
The first mishap, to my eyes did appear, 
She brought me home children two, 
And says, " you must father these two pretty dears !" 
Says 1, " I'll be Mowed if I (.1.)!" 
Then she says, with a 
sneer, " Low dare you presume 
To think of your case being hard ?" 
She knocked me down two pair.; of stair:, with a 
broom, 
And bolted me out in the yard. 
Oh, dear, & c. 
Now, before my song is done, I'll rub out as I 
run-
I 
don't wish the dear creatures to vex ; 
Every word that I 
spoke, it was only a 
joke ; 
God bless them ! I 
love the whole sex. 
Boys, take my advice-get spliced in a 
trice, 
And don't be of wedlock afraid ; 
And girls, do the same, go and alter your name, 
For ' tis shocking to die an old maid. 
Oh, dear, &c.

You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the sod, 
Where the summer winds are murin'ring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you plod, 
When my spirit rests rrom pain aim sorrow free. 
The sands of life arc slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when Fin laid away. 
CHORUS. 
For old Uncle Torn is feeble, 
And his head is bending low ; 
The Master calls, he can ro longer stay 
For his limbs are getting weary, 
And his eyes are growing dim— 
You'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
You will toll our little children that their father dwells above; 
how the angels led him up the golden stair, • 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and sacred love; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the judge his trumpet sounds from realms of bliss on 
high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling Chloe, and together you and 1, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast. 
For old Uncle Tom is feeble, etc, ' 
UNDER THE DAISIES 
VVE jut been learning the hisson of life, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving ; 
4...tal all that's left of the bright, ln•ight dream, 
With its thousand and brilliant phases, 
is a 
handful of dust, in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies, 
he beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And thus forever throughout this wide world, 
Is love a 
sorrow proving., 
There :. re still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the saddest of all is loving; 
l'he life of some is worse than Death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
.AnU far better than life with two heart-4 "varingcm.r 
Is a 
low grave stared with daisies, 
1)eaut ful, beautiful daisies, 
The showy, snowy daisies. 
And Sc LI 
lyttbqr we liv'd as we did, 
The summer or love together, 
And that one of us tired and lay down to red 
Fre the coming of wintry weather; 
For the saddest of Jove is love grown cold, 
And tis Due of Its surest 011IIERS, . 
SO 
I 
bless my .ot, though wit!) breaking heart. 
For tint!. -

GET THEE GONE OIRLI 
rItten by C. R. Dockstader, for and sling by J. D. uaonid: 
AS I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
It' :
4 
about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk; 
She' bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she'd die, 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
He wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his slit. 
With a 
hunk of blue riblam his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his slumbers like a 
hero Gid say, 
( ; et, thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But.the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around and one evennq he died, 
Ile opened his mug and he let his breath si me, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take n 
is last sleep. 
Where the torn cats do light and the bull aogs do eat. 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new .sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shove. she wrote. 
Now she gets boiling full and the boys all Jo shout, 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out. 
MERRY SAILOR LAD. 
Sung ( in character) by Miss CLARA MOORE: 
Oh, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free: 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
[ 
love the deep bhie sea. 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
Where ihe bounding billows rear their heads, 
To play with the tempest cloud ; 
(Hurried music.) 
To play with tempest cloud 
And the storm's deep voice comes o'er the main, 
In murmurs hoarse and loud. 
Oh, r111 a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
love the deep blue sea; 
I 
dearly prize my galkint ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
Huzza huzza! my heart beats glad, 
Wlic would not be a 
sailor lad; 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad, 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad? 
love to tread the vessel's deck, 
Amid the howling gale, 
And listen to the sea gulls' scream, 
And to the thunder's wail. 
And to the thunder's wail, 
And to the thunder's wail. 
(Hurried ,flash music.) 
And watch the vivid lightning play 
Around me bold and free, 
Around me bold and free. 
Oh, some may love the dull tame shore, 
But an ocean life for me. 
Oh, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free, 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea.

The Electric Light. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, Broadway, with great 
success. 
The time is coming when no one can tell the day from night, 
And that will be when we shall see the new electric light. 
Then gas will have to vanish, as all gassy subjects should, 
And the "Yankee Triumph" it will shine upon the bad and 
good; 
The bold policeman on his beat can never go to sleeps 
While all our ball- room beauties, who now look so nice at night, 
Will not seem quite so charming by the new Electric Light. 
CHORUS. 
There's some of us will welcome, 
And some will hate the sight 
Of the latest, greatest wonder. 
That's the new Electric Light. 
The light will show our loving wives if husbands come home 
" 
straight," 
And all the " spooney " pairs at night a 
kissing at the gate ! 
'Twill show the rich man just the way to help the starving 
poor, 
And the way to keep the prowling wolf from honest labor's 
door! 
'Twill show the road t 
o ' good old times," now specie ray-
ment's here, 
And how long Murphy's converts will abstain from gin and 
beer ! 
'Twill show us how our sweethearts keep their " curls" so 
long and bright, 
We'll see what makes their " blushes" by the new Electric 
Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
85 
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT, 
Continued. 
This light will show us how to got the " cash " from " broken 
banks," 
And why them bold directors are allowed to play such pranks. 
'Twill show us why policemen club the helpless and the old, 
When the banks are robbed in broad daylight by burglars 
stout and bold! 
'Twill help a 
girl to ferret out what tints her sweetheart's 
nose, 
And why her dashing neighbors wear such fine, expensive 
clothes. 
'Twill show us if those ' cyphers ' that we read of were all 
right, 
We'll find our honest statesmen by the new Electric Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
This light will show the honest man beneath the ragged coat, 
And why our " Little Johnny " wouldn't let the people vote. 
'Twill guide the Reverand Talmage on some other vice to 
speak, 
And will show him clearly " some" are " frauds" who hear 
him twice a 
week. 
'Twill show who writes the " Personals," and what they all 
may mean, 
And why the girls with " navy busts ' when dressed so stout 
are seen ? 
.Why some one found a 
baby on his door step one fine night, 
Will soon look quiet apparent by the new Electric Light. 
There's some of us, &c.

Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
At le German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of tile different kinds of Mermaids, 
And hear them yell and screech, 
While flopping in the water, 
At Coney island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Mackerelville, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like 'maids, 
floating from the shore, 
Toting man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden wal.Ji, 
swimming in the 
AU the biggest pclkizizzlIn: 
The fattest and the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Could'nt wash them clean. 
Barnum's big fat woman 
Swam our to a 
boat, 
All the buoys in the water 
Would'nt make her float. 
There were Hannahs and Johanna* 
Maria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers, 
Who came limn Brooklyn tows, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be, 
Nat chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea. 
BLUE AND GRAY. 
Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to-day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, lie fought for the gray. 
Now, be of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The other had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sad, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my ,-- ung blood thrill. 
The leg w° - 
'_.):3L in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm en Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew bright, and their warm hearts seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a

DOWN IN ALABAMA. 
Music Published by CHAS. II . 
HARRIS, 13 East 14th St., N. Y. 
Price, 40 cents. 
Sung by G. W. GRIFFEN, the Lone Star Song and Dance Artist. 
We belong away down South, 
Down in Alabama; 
We were raised where the cotton grows, 
Down in Alabama; 
Where the mocking birdies sing, 
Down in Alabama; 
Dar de woods wid music ring, 
Down in Alabama. 
°nouns. 
Wake up, Jacob, 
Make de banjo ring, 
Tune your voice sweet and low, 
When of home you sing. 
Nebber mind what' you he, 
On this great wide earth, 
A 
darkie's heart can never lose 
The spot that gave Mtn birth. 
Home, home, dear little home, 
We ne'er shall find anudder, 
hail so sweet, 
Half so swept, 
As our childhood's home and mudder. 
We got 'rudders ' way down South, 
Down in A lelmma; 
Woolley heads with great big mouth, 
Down in Alabama; 
Hearts as warm as a 
cup of tea, 
Down in Alabama; 
Dar is where we long to he, 
Down in Alabama. 
Wake up, Jacob, etc. 
We belong to the hoe brigade, 
Down in Alabama; 
All turn out in the great parade, 
Down in Alabama; 
Morning, noon, and night you'll see, 
Down in Alabama; 
Happy darkies just like me, 
Down tn Alabama. 
Wake up, Jacob, etc 
Written expressly for JOHNSON & BRUNO, by H. BFNNETT-
Oh ! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs ; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes. 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber Mokus 
CHORIPt. 
We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig ; 
Oh watch us while we sling these number ' levens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh ! the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around ; 
Oh ! we used to -
set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, lil.t ,. 
us, never could lie found ; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his list 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double- twist. 
We're sure to make you,

AMONG THE VIOLETS. 
Written by Wally West. Sang only 1,y Haley $t 
West'. 
By the streamlet when the violets bloom, 
As once by chance I 
strolled, 
I 
saw a 
dazzling picture bright, 
Like rubies set in gold, 
'twas the coral lips and golden curls, 
Of :t 
charming girl, 
Who:e heavenly eyes, so dazzling bright. 
Ilad set my brain 
oGred her my arm, she took it, 
TIlth we both did go, 
Stridling by the mu/inuring-stream -
lot, 
Where the violets grow. 
Cuottus.. 
Oh ! we spoke of love, so fondly then, 
As we wandered through the glen, 
She talked so sweetly then. completely, 
Charming me as on we went, 
I 
can't forget that happy meeting, 
Down among the violets. 
But earthily joys must fade away,. 
And time must take its flight, 
Yet, though the months have passed•since then, 
or forget that night, 
'Tis ever sacred to my heart, 
And will be all through life, 
For as we strolled beside the brook, 
She said she'd be in 
wife, 
And soon she will confide, 
Her darling, 
sel f 
unto my care, 
Then : 111 our paths through life, 
Must be blooming ever bright and fair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
we spoke of love, etc. 
ALABAZAM. 
Sung 1)y Pettit & White. 
I 
almost cried my eyes ou t, 
My clothes are getting thinner, 
All through a 
red heal, bald head girl, 
I 
tried my best to win her. 
I 
treated her to oyster stews, 
And i
ce 
cream every day, 
But when from me she got my stamps, 
Why then she skipped away. 
CHORUS. 
She's my darling Miehigander, she's my alabaster rose, 
Her ears SO Ion , her breath so strong, 
She wears a 
Roman nose, 
She juggles the hash, site's on the mash, 
Most everywhere she goes, 
She's my Kalimazamla, Zanda, Kalimazanda, Alabazaur 
The fellow she promised her heart to, 
Was an artist in his line. 
fle was by birth a 
snatcher of dogs, 
Cot rich in summer time, 
lie made her a 
present of a 
poodle dog, 
tier whole heart to ensnare, 
And a 
bottle of bald headed butter pomade, 
To grease her nice red hair. 
CHORUS. 
She's my darling Michigander, she's my alabaster rose, 
ffer ears so long her breath $o 
strong, 
She wears a 
Homan nose, 
She juggles the hash, she's on the mash, 
Most every where she goes, 
She's my Kalimazanda. Zanda, Kahmazanda, Alabazam.

Isaac and Moses. 
Written by DAvE, HowArtn, and sung by IloviARD and THOMPSON 
nightly at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
We keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little 11hile 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that conic to us, 
lie wanted to buy a 
coat ; 
So help my Jimmy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
CHORUS. 
Isaac and Moses sells old clotheses, 
Down in Baxter street ; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say: 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two. 
Ile made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store ; 
We pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang ; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
Tic brought in all his gang.

Then we march'd down to supper 
In 'ristocratic style, 
The coaches on the outside 
Would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled 
Were the pride of our city, 
The solid men from ev'ry ward, 
Were at Iligg,ins' Coterie. —Ref.

Reporters from the " Herald," 
The " Tribune," and the " Sun," 
Took the names of all the ladies, 
Just when the ball begun; 
The Haleys and the Daleys, 
Myself, and Nell Mc' Gee, 
Were paraded in the papers, 
From Higgins' Coterie. — Ref 
4 
There was Burns, the big distiller, 
We Bride, the alderman, 
And a 
wealthy Cuban lady, 
With diamonds on her hand; 
She walk'd around the ball-room 
Like a 
queen.of high degree, 
All the wealth was represented 
At Higgin's Coterie.—Ref. 
5 
At six o'clock next morning, 
The band played " Patrick's day," 
In horse-cars and in stages, 
The crowd all went away; 
It pulverized poor Higgins, 
And kill'd his family, 
He's living on free lunches 
Since he gave the Coterie.—Ref

Along with Hickory Jackson,

And through this world I

First She Would and Then She Wouldn't, 
As sang wail immense success by master Gii:ouctii:A. M URRAY, 
the rising Young Comic. 
TO an evening party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young 
Dressed oh, so line and smothered in scent, my heart soon hal 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her it she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a 
pecu-
liar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't, 
l'oe're a 
naughty, naughty man. 
I 
sat down by the fair one's side and gave her wine and cake, 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare all for her own dear sake, 
She then looked up at me and smiled, I 
took that smile for bliss, 
And when the time for parting came, I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, ladies and gentlemen I, came very near doing 
it too, but she was one of those peculiar souls that— 
First she,

And to make perfect with the rest, 
She has ' two little feet."

ir4i fir( ista Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arrange,;1 
to meet a 
want frequently felt, by young people— a 
want of means of 
sxpressing, one's sentiments in such s, way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
stlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment.. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which misht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, 
unless 
it 
accords 
with 
the sta te of their affections, which fact makes a 
fitrther explanation un-
necessary. 
The playins- 
of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
