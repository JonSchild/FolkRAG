THE NEW 
Dressed in a 
Dolly Varden. 
THE LATEST NOVELTY. BY G. W. MORRIS. 
Copied by pennissiou of JOHN CH 
unen & Co., Music Publishers, 
60 West Fourth St., Cincinnati, owners of the copyright. 
While promenading the other day, 
I 
chanced to stray, in a 
careless way, 
I 
met a 
pretty girl, she looked so gay 
Dressed in a 
Dolly Varden. 
I 
said, " My dear, don't think I'm wild, 
I 
like your style," she gave a 
smile, 
L 
followed her for fully a 
mile, • 
Eying her Dolly Varden. 
CHORUS. 
Dressed in her Dolly Varden, 
Dressed in her Dolly Varden; 
It was strolling through the park, 
That I 
felt love's subtle dart, 
And met my fate in a 
Dolly Varden. 
The band was in the park quite near, 
It enchanted the ear of my little dear; 
I 
thought the music I'd like to hear, 
So I 
followed the Dolly Varden. 
I 
said, " My dear, can I 
walk with you?" 
" 
That will never do, with a 
stranger too, 
What would ma say if she knew, 
I 
had on my Dolly Varden." (Ciao.) 
6 
Her Dolly Varden looked like 
Or New York milk, which is finer than silk, 
She said, " Sir, it's out of ma's bed- quilt 
I've made a 
Dolly Varden ;" 
I 
saw her home that very night 
The moon shone bright, my heart was light, 
I 
popped the question, and now ies'all right, 
I'm to marry the Dolly Varden. (Cno.) 
The Gipsy Band. 
List to the lay of the Gipsy band, 
Merrily roaming from land to land ; 
Free as the skylark's wing above, 
Fearing no hate, nor courting love ; 
We borrow from all, yet none we owe, 
Laughing at law where'er we go, 
The fattest deer, in park or wood, 
Of knight and peer, supply us food; 
Our drink's the best of contraband— 
Then shout for the merry Gipsy band. 
The wealthy may boast of stately halls, 
Streaming lights from pictured walls; 
Of molded ceilings, gilded domes, 
Flowered carpets o'er their rooms; 
But we're rich as they, below— aloof--.:%- 
The grass our fluor, the sky our roof; 
The bonny rays of yonder moon 
Can match the blaze of their saloon ; 
We've healthier 
cheeks, although 
they're 
tanned; 
Then shout for the merry Gipsy band.

I 
was in the public garden, 
The other afternoon, 
I 
saw a 
lovely maiden, 
Who passed me very soon ; 
The place seemed like an Eden, 
Myself I 
couldn't contain ! 
I 
asked her where she was going, 
She said to see the fountain. 
CHORUS. 
She's the loveliest girl I 
ever saw, 
She's touched my heart's fond chord 
And the prettiest girl I 
ever saw, 
She is, upon ray word ! 
She was dressed so gay and " nobby," 
And then so sweet she'd talk, 
I 
told her it was my " hobby " 
To take an evening walk; 
She said she'd take one with me, 
And pleased I 
was, " you bet !" 
She seemed, I 
think, to love me, 
But I 
haven't " offered " yet. (Ciro.) 
But on Sunday next I'm going, 
All dressed up in my best, 
To ask her if she's willing 
To answer my request! 
And that will be to have me, 
So never more to part, 
If from her soul she loves me, 
:She'll be " queen of my heart!" (Ciro.)

Meet me to-night in the path which lies 
By the side of the woodland hollow ; 
The moon will have opened her silver eyes, 
And tell thee which path to follow. 
Then tripping along to thy footstep's sound, 
Thy lip to thy heart will be humming ; 
If thy glance for a 
moment turn around, 
'Twill assure thee, love, I'm coming. 
Oh, do not fear, not a 
tone will break, 
On earth or in air, that can chide thee ; 
If a 
lonely rose perchance to awake, 
'Twill droop its bloom beside awe.

Pm a 
Paddy whack just landed from the sea! 
And from swate old Ireland all the way I've come; 
When I 
left, my darlin' mother says to me : 
" 
Don't forget the little cabin here at home I" 
For the party girl I 
had to leave behind, 
When the big ship sailed away I 
dropt a 
tear ; 
But in politics I've just made up my mind, 
And I'm bound to be an Alderman next year! 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
Paddy whack just landed, so I 
ant ! I 
am! 
And me mother was before me, so she was ! she 
was ! 
Oh, I'm here to work and fight for Uncle Sam, 
a, Paddy whack just landed, so I 
am I 
Oh, the good old times at home I 
can't forget, 
And the dancing and the whisky punch galore 
Thick as bees, the lively girls and boys we met, 
And we jigged it till we battered down the floor! 
Then we had a 
fight, av course you know for fun! 
'Cause we loved each other very fond and dear; 
So, I'll keep my old shillalah, boys, for one, 
For at " primaries" I'll have to use it here! 
When I 
saw swate Castle Garden, how I 
jumpt 
For they said that all the streets were paved wid 
gold; 
Then meself and duds upon the shore they dumpt, 
And the little boys they laughed at me, I'm told! 
11 
But I've wrote home to the brother, do ye see, 
And it's toilin' there he is like any Turk— 
" 
Come and lift the hod," I 
says to him, " like me— 
Sure, the chap upon the wall does all the work!" 
So I'm happy and contented as a 
king, 
For I'm risin' in the world, boys, every day ! 
But the mem'ries of my home around me cling, 
And I 
often dream of those so far away! 
For it's there I 
have the swatest little dear, 
Oh, it's on her lovely Irish eyes I 
dote! 
So I'll send for her this very condi)! year, 
And we'll raise up little Paddy whacks to " vote!"

There's a 
Good Time Coming, Girls. 
There's a 
good time coming, girls, 
A good time coming; 
When ladies need not sing their beaux 
The song, " Why don't the men propose ?" 
In the good time coming. 
When " eligible men" won't fail, 
The middle-aged and younger; 
And leap year be of no avail, 
But wait a 
little longer. 
There's a 
good time coming, girls, 
A good time coming; 
When Cupid's power shall be obeyed, 
Nor men to marry be afraid 
In the good time coining. 
When girls like girls, not women, dress, 
And make their charms the stronger, 
And ne'er say " no" when they mean " yes," 
But—wait a 
little longer.

The Broadway, Qpera, and Bowery Crawl. 
SUNG. IN THE BLACK CROOK-
Copied by permission of Wm. A. POND & CO., Music Publishers,

The afternoon's the time to see, 
The fashionable gent or belle, 
The morning's for the business man, 
The afternoon is for the swell. 
He struts on Broadway, gayly decked 
In beaver, broadcloth, gloves and all, 
And while the lads with envy Emile, 
He takes his usual Broadway crawl. 
CHORUS. 
The afternoon crawl, the afternoon crawl, 
For quizzing the darlings or making a 
call, 
The afternoon crawl, the afternoon crawl, 
I'll show you the Broadway afternoon crawl. 
Another style I'll try t..;. 
show, 
Through Bowery he often goes; 
With pantaloons stuck in his boots, 
And beaver pushed upon his nose. 
He's always ready for a " muss," 
And loudly boasts his want of fear; 
But oftentimes he finds his match, 
And then he "' crawls off on his ear." (Cno.) 
But in my song rit not forget 
The dandy of Fifth Avenue; 
Leave out the swell of " Upper Tent" 
By Jove! you know 'twould never do; 
Ho dotes upon the opera, 
And all that sort of thing, you know, 
For promenading afternoons 
He's just the fellow for a 
beau.

When I 
Courted -Mary Ann. 
Copied by permission of ROOT & CADT, Music Publishers, 67 
Washington St., Chicago, owners of the copyright. 
I 
remember long ago 
When I 
courted Mary Ann, 
When she told me that she loved me 
More than any other man; 
flow she laid her flaxen ringlets 
Close against my heaving breast, 
You may know 'twas mighty pleasant, 
And I 
needn't tell the rest. 
Oh! the evenings in the parlor, 
And the meetings in the streets, 
And the kisses on the stairway— 
By my faith! but they were sweet; 
Then the charming little letters 
That were always sent to me 
When we parted for a 
journey, 
Whether long or short to be. 
With her head upon my shoulder, 
And her little hand in mine, 
You may bet we didn't reckon 
On the passing of the time; 
Oft she'd tell me midst her blushes 
That site thought so much of me, 
And I 
fear it made me prouder 
Than a 
mortal man should be. 
I 
remember I 
was working, 
Building houses at the time, 
'But the airy, fairy castles 
That I 
builded were sublime; 
44,4 
15 
For my mind was always running 
On the girl that loved me so, 
And at last I 
found I 
couldn't 
Do without. her, as you know. 
Though I 
know it's,mighty pleasant 
To be settled down for life, 
Yet it's twenty times as pleasant 
To be- courting for a 
wife. 
Oh I 
the happy, happy days 
When I 
courted Mary Ann I 
So go in; you courting youngsters, 
And enjoy it while you can. 
The Woman in White. 
I 
am really a 
very susceptible man, 
So I 
vowed that no woman my heart should trepan, 
I 
have set at side tables and played at short whist, 
The charms of the polka resolved to resist. 
I 
have said to myself, " It's a 
folly, that's clear, 
In a 
man to get 
pl iced ' on three hundred a-year." 
But in spite of all this, since one unlucky night, 
I 
have been haunted each day by a 
Woman in White. 
I 
had my misgivings, it really would seem; 
This 'Woman in White, then, was only a 
dream. 
I 
went to a 
party again, in despair; 
" 
The Woman in White !" I 
exclaimed, she was- there; 
I 
led her aside ere the dancing had closed, 
She blushed, I 
explained; she looked down, I pro-
posed, 
lIer fortune her own, I 
was her Mr. Wright; 
So I 
married the dear little Woman in White. 
The Gay Young Swell. 
ROLLIN HOWARD'S POPULAR SONG. 
Copied by permission of ROOT & CADY, Music Publishers, 67 
Washington St., Chicago, owners of the copyright. 
I 
suppose you've heard of the gay young swell, 
Bourbon Bob, and the jolly dogs, 
But the one of whom I'm going to tell, 
He's a 
beau of mine ; 
I 
met him first in Central Park, 
A handsome, gay young swell, 
lie approached me with " My lovely dear, 
You are a 
charming belle," 
CHORUS. 
My dear girls, my dear girls, 
lie's a 
beau of mine, 
lie's a 
beau of mine, he's my beau, ha, ha! 
He's a 
beau of mine, he's my beau, ha, ha I 
We strolled along, he saw me home, 
To ask my ma could he marry me ? 
He'd seen the world, no more would roam, 
He'd be a 
beau of mine. 
At first mamma at him did stare, 
And said, " Oh, what a 
swell 
My dearest child, he's lovely hair, 
If he's money, all is well." 
I 
said, " Mamma, he's lots of cash, 
But little brains within his head, 
As long as I 
control the cash, 
He can be a 
beau of mine ;" 
When we walk out, the girls at us do stare, 
And say I'm quite a 
belle, 
When he's dressed up, I 
do declare, 
You'd say he's a 
gay young swell. (Cno.)

I'm very fond of music, 
To me it's quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German bands 
Or organs in the street. 
Through listening to the band, one day, 
I 
nearly lost my heart, 
The leader ' twas who found it, 
And he now with it won't part. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
feel so awfully jolly, 
When the band begins to play ; 
I 
am very fond of music, 
I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the band, Pom:Pom. 
My Charlie is my darling, 
The beau ideal of love, 
With his hair so black and curly, 
And his whitest of white gloves. 
My love sits in the middle 
With his baton in his hand, 
And leads the instrumentalists 
In a 
style that I 
think grand. 
(CHO.) 
They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, polka and quadrille, 
And sometimes play so feelingly 
It gives me quite a 
thrill. • 
The leader sometimes gives a 
frown, 
And looks as though he's rash, 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a 
crash. (Cno.) 
Glorianna Jones, 
A FAVORITE COME SONG. 
Exclusive permission to use this song granted to Beadle & Co., 
by J. L. PETERS, owner of the copyright and Music 
Publisher, 399 Broadway, New York. 
My love is just as sweet a 
girl 
As ever you did see ; 
Her golden hair is all a-curl, 
Her voice is full of glee ; 
Pure as the snow her spotless brow, 
And soft her winning tones, 
But oh, she glories in the name 
Of Glorianna Jones! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Glorianna, dear Glorianna, 
Oh, Glorianna, sweet Glorianna .Jones 
Though bright her eyes, and fair her cheeks, 
And soft her silver tones, 
She bears the unromantic name 
Of Glorianna Jones. 
That happy time I'll ne'er forget, 
When first I 
saw my fair, 
'Twas at a 
fancy fair we met, 
And all the swells were there; 
She said such pretty, artless things 
In such delightful tones, 
That I 
felt glorious beside 
Sweet Glorianna Jones. (Cuonus.) 
We sat together all the eve, 
And talked of this and that ; 
At last, although it made me grieve, 
I 
rose to take my hat; 
19 
And in the turmoil of tho street 
I 
lost her gentle tones, 
But I 
had left my heart behind 
With Glorianna Jones. (Cnonns.) 
Since then I've seen her twice a 
week, 
And she, my rose, my star, 
Refers me, when of love I 
speak, 
-Unto her ancient " pa ;" 
" 
What's in a 
name?" so Shakspeare says; 
My heart-she ever owns; 
It's understood between us that 
She soon shall drop the Jones (Cuo.) 
I've Something Else to Do. 
After waiting long and wondering 
Whether married life is best, 
I 
at last resolved to venture, 
And myself the question test ; 
But my wife, e'en in my honeymoon, 
Strange conduct did pursue, 
For she said, " My love, don't tease me, 
For—I've something else to do." 
I 
imagined all my bachelor 
Disconthrts then -would end; 
For her I 
gave up smoking, 
And I 
cut my oldest friend; 
But my collars are neglected, 
And my buttons she won't sew; - 
For she says " Pm not a 
seamstress, 
And—I've something else to do."

She leaned upon my arm; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast 
cnouus. 
Twilight in the Park ! twilight in the Park! 
Cupid lingers there, and no one near to mark! 
Some one by your side, happy as a 
lark! 
That's the time I 
love, twilight in the Park! 
She left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said good-by; 
I 
begged to know my fate, , 
And half suppressed a 
sigh! 
She said she'd come again, 
And named the time and place ; 
Her absence gave my heart such pain, 
For heaven shone in her fate! 
lk 
So'every day I 
watched 
In love's delightfurtrance, 
And sure enough, we met again, 
She knew me at a 
glance! 
'Twas love at sight, I 
said, 
And as the day grew dark, 
I 
won her heart forevermore, 
At twilight in the Park.

On, and destruction alone points the path 
" 
Mercy, oh heaven," the sufferers wail, 
Feeble humanity naught can avail. 
Thousands are homeless, and quick to their cry', 
Heaven-born charity yields a 
supply, 
Upward we glance in our terrible grief, 
" 
Give us this day," brings the promised relief. 
Treasures have vanished and riches have flown, 
Hopes for the earth life ane blasted and gone, 
Courage, oh, brother, yield not to despair, 
" 
God is our refuge," his kingdom we'll share.

Down in a 
Coal Mine. 
I 
am a 
jovial collier lad, 
And blithe as blithe can be, 
For, let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways, 
For where the dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found ; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground. 
My hands are horny, hard and black, 
With working in the vein, 
And, like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, . 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. (Cno 
At every shift, be 't 
soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait 
And watch for my return; 
For Death, that levels all alike, 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and damp may strike, 
And fling his darts at me. (Cno.) 
How little do the great ones care, 
Who sit at home secure, 
What hidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure; 
The very fires their mansions boast 
,To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can, 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man ; 
However fortune turns about, 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would England be without 
The lads that look for coals. 
What's a 
Woman Like? 
A woman is like to— but stay, 
What a 
woman is like, who can say ? 
There's no living with or without one, 
The sting rises like a 
fly— 
Now an ear, now an eye, 
Buz, buz, always buzzing about one. 
When ahe's tender and kind, 
She's like to m3,' mind, 
And Fanny was so, I 
remember, 
She is like to, oh dear, 
She's as good, very near, 
As a 
ripe melting peach in September. 
If she laugh, and she chat, 
Play, juke and all that, 
And with smiles and good- humor she meet me; 
She's like a 
nice dish 
Of venison or fish, 
That cries from the table, " Come, eat me."

You're an artful, deceiving coquette 
I 
whispered how fondly I 
loved her, 
She seemed to love me in return, 
And when I 
proposed matrimony, 
her cheeks with deep blushes did burn! 
I 
lived in a

And life was all roses and pearls ; 
I 
called her my darling, my angel, 
My sweetest of sweet little girls! (Cno.) 
But all is not gold, though it glitters ! 
I 
called on my charmer, one day, 
But found out that some other fellow 
had married and borne her away ! 
Oh! where are the presents I 
gave her ? 
Oh ! where are her smiles bright as gold ? 
It's no use in asking conundrums, 
For I 
have been splendidly " sold "! ( Crr)

IVhile jogging through life, with its sorrows and plea-
sure, 
Most all sorts of people we find, 
And changes in fashions we meet beyond measure, 
We see them every kind ; 
Appearances often deceive, it is true, 
And this much we all must confess, 
Wherever we go, or whatever we do, 
We can't judge a 
man by his dress. 
cnonus. 
Oh, broadcloth and jewelry don't make our gentlemen, 
No matter what they profess, 
And those who are posted, ' twill do to bet ten to one, 
Don't judge a 
man by his dress. 
Encased in a 
costly suit, kid gloves and beaver, 
With honest pretensions profound, 
A 
lawless, unprincipled, wily deceiver 
In each day of life can be found; 
With plausible words and a 
sinister smile, 
Great friendship for us they'll profess; 
But it's only for " policy," only their " style," 
We can't judge a 
man by his dress. (Cno.) 
It's really astonishing, truly a 
wonder, 
What faults a 
fine coat will obscure, 
But then there are certainly thousands in number 
With hearts that are honest and pure ; 
We'll trust to a 
disinterested true friend, 
Though ragged, we'll prize him no less, 
He'll not prove a 
wolf in sheep's clothing, depend, 
We ca.n't judge a 
man by his dress. . (Cno.)

'Twas milking time, and the cows came up 
From the meadows so sweet with clover, 
And stood in the lane, while pretty Jane 
Had a 
quiet chat with the drover— 
Such a 
quiet chat, that it scarcely seemed 
That a 
single word was spoken ; 
While a 
magic spell with the night dews fell, 
And the rhythm of song was unbroken 
The cattle stood at the lovers' side 
Without any show of vexation, 
As though impressed that a 
five-bar rest 
Was a 
part of their restoration— 
And as Jane listenel to notes that came 
Right under the bars and over, 
Her heart took wing, like a 
silly thing, 
And nestled up close to the drover. 
She heard him say that his home was poor, 
That he'd nothing but love to give her; 
And she smiled content as though love had spent 
Every arrow he had in his quiver : 
She smiled content, while the evening air, 
With the voices of birds was ringing; 
And her lips confessed that a 
lowly nest 
Should never prevent her singing. 
So over the bars the loverg lean 
In the joy of their sweet communion ; 
And their looks declaresthat poverty ne'er 
Shall be a 
bar to their union.

Oh, sweetest music, go thread your rhymes 
Now under the bars arid over ! 
Where pretty Jane, in the fragrant lane, 
Bewitched the heart of the drover.

I 
am a 
miserable man, 
As ever yet was seen, 
And since the hour when I 
was born, 
I've miserable been ; 
When born I 
had a 
brooding frown, 
A look foreboding ill, 
That settled gloom of infancy's, 
Stamped on my features still; 
I 
had a 
wicked mammy, 
And a 
more than brutal pappy, 
They starved me, beat me, pinched me, kicked 
me. 
Still I 
was not happy. 
When big enough to go to school, 
They sent me far away, 
Where all was work and drudgery, 
And never any play ; 
No marbles, tops, no kites or hoops, 
Allowed were, but such sums, 
Were set us, and small exercise 
For our poor teeth and gums; 
We had of meat the smallest cut, 
Of drink the wee-est drappie, 
I 
almost died from hunger, but— 
But still I 
was not happy. 
Before I 
left, as a 
reward, 
For never telling lies, 
The stern head master handed me 
A volume as a 
prize; 
'Twas bound in calf, with pages gilt, 
'Twas heavyish to lift, 
At length thought I 
is happiness, 
As I 
beheld the gift. 
All tremblingly I 
opened it, 
Alas! this eager chap he 
Read Martin Farquhar Tupper's works, 
And still I 
was not happy.

Angels have hung out their lamps in the sky, 
Evening has shadowed the brow of the day; 
Papa, come sit down 4nd answer me why 
Death called my beautiful mother away. 
When her sweet darling beside her they laid, 
how I 
remember she looked up and smiled ; 
Softly she called you unto her and said, 
" 
Promise you'll cherish and care for my child." 
Caw:us—Softly she called, etc. 
Many a 
night have poor mother and me 
Sat by the window, and, watching the gate, 
'Weeping, she'd ask me, " Oh, where can he be, 
What can be keeping your papa so late ?" 
Weary with waiting, she kissed me, and said, 
Just like an angel, so pleasant and mild, 
" 
I'll watch and I'll wait, darling ; go to your bed," 
Then she would pray both for you and her child. 
Cnonus—I'll watch, etc. 
Papa, stay home ; please don't leave me to-night, 
Think of dear mamma, in prayer let me bow, 
Asking our Father to guide you aright— 
Papa, remember, I'm motherless now. 
Kneel down with me, papa, come, let us pray; 
Mother, oh . smile as in life you once smiled ; 
Father in heaven, show papa the way 
lie may go home with his motherless child.

Mazurka never tire. 
But all of these, though good enough, 
Are not the thing, you see,

After the Opera's Over. 
A PoPITLAR SONG BY GEORGE LEYBOURNE. 
After the opera's over, 
.Gas tries to outshine the stars 
When half the world sleeps contented, 
We'll champagne and smoke fine cigars; 
For life without pleasure is cold, 
And I 
should not live very long, 
But how we survive at the west end, 
I'm delighted to tell in my song. 
cnonus. 
After the opera's over, 
Attending the ladies is done, 
We gems of the very first water, 
Commence then our frolic and fun. 
I 
keep my own box at the opera, 
I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and hinds in the country, 
So much money I 
can not tell ? 
Then why should I 
let myself down, 
And neither spend money or lend, 
For money well spent brings joys, 
Yes, money was made to spend. (Cno.) 
After the opera's over, 
Belgravia could tell many tales, 
But as I 
am one of its people, 
It would not be fair to drive nails; 
Suffice me to say that at night, 
We dance, we sing, and we play, 
We " upper ten" with hearts so light, 
Thus merrily Wile time away. (Crto.) 
After your business, take pleasure, 
But business, by Jove, I've none, 
A fellow to find out his troubles, 
Why hang it, I 
don't sec the fun; 
To you that have money to spend, 
Just take a 
lesson by me, 
Live in the squares of Belgravia, 
And the pleasures of life you'll see.

It's by night and by day I 
am dreaming of one 
Little maiden so gentle and true; 
Who's the sweetest that ever lived under the sun, 
With her eyes roguish, merry and blue ; 
Oh, her face is as bright as the dawn of the day, 
And her voice like the coo of a 
dove, 
There is naught in this world that can take me away 
From the dear little girl that I 
love.

Oh, I 
dream night and day of her sweet, sunny face, 
And her eyes like the stars above; 
For there's no other maid with the beauty and grace 
Of the dear little girl that I 
love. 
She's as pure as the lilies that sleep in the dell, 
And as fair as their blossoms of snow; 
While around my poor heart she has woven a 
spell 
That will follow me where'er I 
go. 
Oh, the heart in her bosom is trusting and kind, 
While all folly and art she's above, 
You may search far and wide, but none better you'll 
find 
Than the dear little girl that I 
love. (Cnonts.) 
Oh, she smiles when we meet and she cries when we 
part, 
And she cheers me in sorrow and strife, 
While her sweet words of love I 
will keep in my 
heart, 
Wherever I 
wander in life. 
37 
I 
have told her my love, yes, a 
hundred times o'er, 
As I 
called her my own pretty dove ; 
Oh, the future has many a

For the dear little girl that I 
love. (Cnonns.)

And bid me soft " Good-night " ; 
For I 
am happier in my dreams, 
And sleep in sweeter rest, 
If I 
have laid my lips to thine, 
And thine to mine are pressed. 
One kiss, dear mother, for the love 
My heart keeps warm for thee, 
And one for all the tenderness 
Thy sweet eyes look to me; 
Kiss me forgiveness of my wrongs, 
Kiss me with hope and prayer 
That I 
shall be a 
better child, 
And more reward thy care. 
Kiss me for some poor orphan child, 
To whom no kiss is given, 
And next, for all the happy ones, 
And then for one in heaven; 
-Kiss me for every thing I 
love, 
The beautiful and bright: 
Sweet mother, kiss me for thyself, 
And now, once more, " good-night."

Last night I 
met him orr the train, 
A man with lovely eyes; 
And he gave me such a 
searching glance 
Of sweetly charmed surprise! 
I 
knew 'twas he the lady meant, 
Who once my fortune told, 
By his jet-black eyes, his grand mustache, 
And his buck-skin bag of gold. 
CHORUS. 
Yes ! yes! he is the man 
Who does your fortune hold ! 
He has jet-black eyes, a 
grand mustache, 
And a 
buck-skin bag of gold. 
The dearest man you ever saw— 
How much I 
love him now! 
And if I 
should live a 
thousand years, 
No other hears my vow. 
Like Judas—no, like Jupiter— 
He looked so brave and bold, 
With his jet-black eyes, his grand mustache, 
And his buck-skin bag of gold. 
Sweet boy! bring me the " Morning Call," 
Perchance I'll find his name 
At the " Grand Hotel" he must have stopped, 
I 
wonder when he came? 
He must have charmed those Lumpkin girls, 
So haughty,' proud and cold, 
By his jet-black eyes, his grand mustache, 
And his buck-skin bag of gold. 
tI 
39 
How can I 
seek a 
name unknown ? 
Oh, tell me where he went! 
What is this I 
read ? 
Why papa's bank 
Is robbed of every cent ! 
The thief, it seems, left town last night, 
Well, well ! I'm nicely sold ! 
He had jet-black eyes, a 
grand mustache, 
And a 
buck-skin bag of gold. (Otto.)

It's very distressing, my lover is shy. 
My lover is ready and willing, I 
know, 
To come and escort me wherever I 
go, 
He never as yet sought a 
kiss it is true, 
While I 
am quite willing to let him have two. 
My lover's attentive, so gentle and kind, 
But always too bashful to speak out his mind, 
Else why don't he say with true fondness to me, 
" 
My own dearest Mary, shall we married be ?" 
But shoirld he some morning more courage com-
mand, 
And speak to me softly while pressing my hand, 
And ask me to wed him without more delay, 
My answer would be, " Let's get married to-day."

Behold, good people all, 
The military swell, 
The pride of rout and ball, 
The delight of every belle; 
The bosom friend and chum 
Of the worthy " Captain Jinks," 
Par excellence the swell 
Is your devoted Blinks. 
CHORUS. 
I'm young Captain Blinks, " of the staff," 
A sample of a 
soldier swell, 
Friend of all the fellows, 
And the ladies too as well. 
My stunning uniform, 
And noble martial air, 
Attack the gentler sex, 
The ladies sweet and fair; 
And when I 
tell them yarns, 
Of the battle's awful roar, 
How sweetly they say, " All! do 
Give up this horrid war." (Cnonts.) 
A merry life I 
lead, 
My load is light to hear, 
Of danger you may believe, 
I've not a 
terrible share; 
Thought well of by the fellows, 
Admired by all the girls, 
I 
thus enjoy a 
merry round, 
Of wine and style and curls. (Cno.)

Barney, say you'll not forget me, 
Though the Atlantic's waves divide;

While walking down the avenue 
The other afternoon, 
I 
spied a 
maid with smiles as bright 
As blooming flowers in June; 
With eyes as blue as violets 
Bedecked with morning dew, 
While on her quven-like little head 
Bright golden tresses grew. 
CHORUS. 
Roses upon each cheek, 
Bright eyes that seemed to speak, 
Graceful her sylph-like form, 
Her like I 
never kneiv ; 
To fall quite deep in love, 
With such a 
turtle dove, 
Could I 
do less I 
pray, 
I'll leave it all to you. 
With timid steps I 
walked beside 
This pretty little dear, 
She gave to me a 
sidelong glance 
That made me feel so queer ; 
I 
asked her to accept my arm, 
And tell to me her name, 
Said she, in tones so clear and sweet 
" 
They call me Emma Jane." (Co.) 
We talked of love and future bliss, 
The time flew quickly by, 
I 
asked her would she be my wife ? 
She gave a 
little sigh, 
AilikliA&Ait .4644

AL 
Then asked me were my parents rich, 
And what my prospects were: 
" 
You know," she says, " I 
must have silks, 
And jewels rich and rare." (Cuo.) 
Says I, " although my dress is rich, 
My purse is light indeed," 
She dropped my arm just like a 
shot, 
And started off with speed. 
A cruel " shake" I 
do declare, 
But oh what could I. do? 
The way to win her heart and hand— 
I'll leave it all to you. (Cnonus.` 
Why don't I 
Change my Name? 
I've chances had to change my name, 
And so to do I 
mean ; 
But oh ! it seems I 
never shall, 
I've so unlucky been. 
My name's a 
nice one—Fanny Good— 
It looks well on a 
letter ; 
Now who would change the name of Good 
'Unless ' twere for the better? 
A Rose by any other name 
They say would be as sweet; 
Alas ! it never was my fate 
A Mr. Hose to meet. 
A single maiden still I 
am 
In spite of all my trouble; 
I 
would be White—or Black—or Dunn, 
Or even Mrs. Double.

As you jonrney along through the valley of life, 
A happy and fortunate man, 
If you see a 
poor mortal who's weary and sick, 
Why help him along if you can; 
I 
have found it is better to whistle than cry, 
Make happy the days that you spend, 
And always remember, whatever you do, 
Don't you ever go back on your friend! 
CHORUS. 
Though fortune smile on you forever in life, 
There cometh a 
time it will end, 
It will be a 
great comfort and pleasure to -know, 
That you never went back on your friend! 
The journey of life is a 
beautiful walk, 
Which many a 
mortal has tried, 
And many have gone to the end of the road, 
Some fell by the wayside and died. 
When you see a 
poor man that befriended you once 
On whom you could always depend— 
Ask a 
favor of you—don't you turn him away, 
Oh, don't you go back on your friend I (Ono.)

Where the violets bloom so fair, 
Charming Jessie on my arm, 
She was with me there.

I 
to her did something whisper,

What we said beneath the tree, 
Yet I

She so dear to me.

As it did with me. (errours.)

There lives at the west end of the town, 
A. young female named Caroline Brown, 
She had lovers a 
few, 
But all she would do, 
Was to turn up her nose or to frown; 
But one day she was seen to succumb, 
And her frien ,ls they were nearly struck dumb, 
To sec her attached, 
To a 
person of color, 
Who plays on the Indian drum. 
CHORUS. 
For his name it was Thing- a-my-chum, chum chum. 
He played on the Indian drum, drum drum. 
And when down the street he would come, come, 
come, 
He'd make a 
most terrible noise. 
Now ICTiss Brown had once been to Bombay, 
And the fair creature had during her stay, 
Met a 
Nabob so grand 
Who owned jewels and land, 
And made love in a 
curious way. 
She thought she had hooked a 
fine prize, 
But she lost it in spite of her sighs; 
So the dear little sweet, 
Thought the blaeli in the street 
Was her Indian love in disguise. (Cno.) 
She threw money, and bid him to play, 
And so he did too the whole clay; 
'Till her frightened papa, 
Sent out wide and far, 
51 
For a 
policeman to move him away; 
Then Miss Brown tore her hair from her head, 
To her parent paternal she said, 
Since my love's far away, 
Oh, papa, let me pray, 
Have the man with the tonnom instead. 
Miss Brown now ( most sad ' tis to say,) 
Has never been right since that day, 
And Thing- a-my-chum, 
With his terrible drum, 
He's paid to keep out of the way. 
Miss Brown is kept under restraint, 
For she daubs her face o'er with brown paint, 
And fancies each day, 
She's the queen of Bombay, 
And it's useless to tell her she ain't. (Clio.) 
A 
Garden is my Lady's Face. 
A garden is my lady's face, 
Where roses and white lilies blow ; 
A heavenly paradise is that place, 
-Wherein the fairest fruits do grow. 
There cherries be that none may buy, 
'Till " cherry- ripe" themselves do cry. 
Those cherries fairly do disclose, 
Of orient pearls a 
double row; 
Which, when her lovely laughter shows, 
They look like rosebuds filled with snow. 
Yet them no peer nor prince may buy, 
'Till " cherry ripe " themselves do cry.

LOBBY NEWCOMB'S FAVORITE SONG. 
Exclusive permission to use this song granted to Beadle ft Co., 
by J. L. PETERS, owner of the copyright and Music 
Publisher, 399 Broadway, New York. 
It's nice in the twilight to meet at the gate, 
Or down in the dell, ere evening grows late I 
It's nice to be roving where lilies are sweet, 
And to bear a 
dear voice all its love-words repeat! 
But the nicest of places, where I 
meet my girl— 
She's as bright as a 
diamond and fair as a 
pearl— 
Is a 
dear little dell where the wild flower grows; 
I 
know she'll be waiting there under the rose! 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
sweet little flower, she is, I 
declare ! 
In fact I 
have never beheld one so fair ! 
I 
meet her at twilight, as you may suppose I 
For I 
know she'll be there, waiting under the rose I 
When out to a 
party or out to a 
ball, 
My rosebud is surd to be belle of them all! 
The ladies they envy, the gentlemen sigh, 
When off in the mazy she goes waltzing by! 
Then home I 
escort her and stand at the gate, 
Enjoying a 
sweet little short tete-a-tete ! 
And when I'm departing, she a 
kiss to me throws, 
Out there in her garden, just under the rose 
Some day we'll be married, and then you shall see 
The girl that is queen of my heart and of me! 
I 
know you will say she is all I've declared, 
And none that you've seen can with her be compared. 
I'd like to invite you the day we are wed, 
But I 
can't, for you see not a 
word have I 
said; 
Yet she told me she loved me, as you may suppose, 
While she stood in the twilight, just under the rose.

Oh, I 
often sit and ponder 
On youth's long departed days, 
With its scenes of mirth and beauty, 
That have vanished from my gaze; 
And I 
fondly dream of faces, 
Beaming with health's rosy glow, 
That were gathered round the fireside 
In the blissful long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Though the loved home circle's broken, 
And the stranger lingers there, 
Heaven bless the dear old fireside 
Is my spirit's yearning prayer. 
When the twilight shades were falling, 
Like a 
mantle over earth, 
Cheerily the bright flame glimmered, 
. 
On the peaceful cottage hearth; 
And a 
group of lovelit faces 
Smiled upon the hallowed scene, 
As they sung their simple ditties, 
By the firelight's golden sheen. (Cno.) 
But the household band is severed, 
Never more on earth to meet, 
Some are bound in dreamless slumber, 
In the valley calm and sweet; 
Others roam in climes of beauty, 
Far beyond the stormy sea, 
Yet my chidhood's dear old fireside 
Very precious is to me. (Cnonus.) 
Sally in our Alley. 
A POPULAR COMIC BALLAD. 
Of all the girls that are so smart, 
There's none like pretty Sally ; 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
There's ne'er a 
lady in the land 
That's half so sweet as Sally: 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
Her father he makes cabbage nets, 
And through the streets does cry them; 
Her mother she sells laces long, 
To all who need to buy them. 
But can such folks the parents be 
Of such a 
girl as Sally? 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
Of all the days that's in the week, 
I 
deArly love but one day, 
And that's the day that comes between 
A Saturday and Monday: 
For then I'm drest all in my best, 
To walk abroad with Sally: 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
When Christmas comes about again, 
Oh then I 
shall have money, 
I'll hoard it. up, and box and all, 
I'll give it to my honey. 
And would it were ten thousand pounds, 
I'd give it all to Sally : 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our alley. 
My master and the neighbors all, 
Make game of me and Sally, 
And but for her I'd better be 
A slave and row a 
galley. 
But when my seven long years are out, 
Oh then I'll marry Sally; 
And when were wed we'll blithesome be, 
But not in our alley. 
'Twas a 
pleasant summer morning, 
Just the morn that I 
enjoy; 
Waking early, I 
was puzzled 
How I 
should my time employ : 
In such fine and splendid weather 
I 
don't care for work—do you ? 
So I 
went to see my sweetheart, 
As I'd nothing else to do! 
But before the day was over, 
I'd, somehow, made up my mind, 
That I'd " pop the question " to her, 
If to me her heart inclined ; 
So I 
whispered, " Sweet, my darling, 
For my bride may I 
have you ?"' 
" 
Well," said she, " perhaps you may, dear, 
When I've nothing else to do."

He slept, and o'er his dauntless brow 
A shade of sorrow stole, 
As though some scene of deep distress 
Was busy with his soul; 
When suddenly the dread alarm 
Came ringing shrill and clear, 
Cleaving the night-air till it struck 
Upon his startled ear ! 
He bounded up ! 
His practiced eye 
Was turned upon the lurid sky, 
Lit by the flames which, mounting higher, 
Soon clothed the night in robes of fire. 
Cuonus--lle bounded up, etc. 
With lightning speed, he reached the scene— 
Oh ! What a

A mother stood amid the flames 
And shrieked in wild despair ! 
Her arms around her frightened babe 
Were thrown with frenzied clasp, 
As though she feared the fire- fiend 
Would tear it from her grasp. 
Wi:h helmet turned, through flame, and smoke, 
The gallant fellow fearless broke. 
He saved them both, hut ah ! his life 
Was lost in the unequal strife. 
Cnonus—With helmet turned, etc. 
Now in Greenwood's peaceful shade 
The noble hero sleeps, 
And o'er his grave full many a 
friend 
In silent sorrow weeps ; 
37 
A monument erected there 
Is pointed to with pride, 
By those with whom lie oft has fought 
The fire-fiend, side by side ; 
Sweet flowers exhale their fragrant breath 
Where now he calmly sleeps in death, 
And trees their spreading branches wave 
Around his solemn Greenwood grave. 
CHORUS— Sweet flowers exhale, etc. 
Chicago Rediviva!

Chicago's been burnt down in timber to-day,

Chicago has capital, losses to pay, 
Or, Chicago has credit her losses to borrow. 
No fabulous Phoenix, with flames circled thick, 
Give us henceforth, as swift resurrection's imago; 
In its stead paint up, heralds, an Illinois Chick, 
With the legend in gold letters tacked to it : "Ago." 
Po:: this Illinois Chick, from her circle of flame, 
Looks calmly and coolly, victorious o'er ruin : 
And this bird has a 
right to, in more than in name, 
For ago's " I 
do," and Chicago is doing. 
The Dolly Varden, 
Of all the flowers of woodland bowers, 
Of meadows sweet, or garden, 
None can compare with maiden fair 
Dressed in a 
Dolly -Varden. 
The laughing face, the blithesome grace, 
The lovely braided ,tresses, 
The boots that peep beneath the sweep 
Of these quaint, pretty dresses. 
The roguish eyes that feign surprise 
At looks of admiration, 
The rosebud lip that gives a 
skip 
To each male heart's pulsation. 
The way she holds the pretty folds, 
-When out perambulatitig, 
And lifts the skirt from dust and dirt 
Is very fascinating. 
But, ne'ertheless, the witching dress 
Must have the maid, that's certain; 
Or else it seems like morning dreams 
Of hideous chamber curtain. 
And should a 
lass who scarce could pass 
For aught that's sweet or winning 
The Dolly wear, against the fair 
And lovely she'd be sinning. 
But let the flowers of Beauty's bowers 
Monopolize tie fashion, 
And e'en the tints of figured chintz 
Will tire a 
man's love passion. 
And when he sighs to pluck a 
prize 
To plant in his own garden, 
he'll take a 
rose that sweetest blows 
When in d 
Dolly Varden.

And He's Got the Money, Too. 
WORDS BY C. T. LOCKWOOD. 
Copied by permission of ItooT 85 CADY, Music Publishers, 67 
Washington St., Chicago, owners of the copyright. 
I'm just as fond of beauty, 
As any one can be; 
The pretty eye, the rosy cheek, 
- I 
love so much to see; 
There is none of us that have them 
Except myself and you, 
But I 
know a 
little fellow, 
And he's got the money, too. 
CHORUS. 
Oh don't I 
love my honey, 
And won't I 
use the money ! 
I 
am happy as a 
flower 
That sips the morning clew, 
For I 
know a 
little fellow, 
And he's got the money, too. 
I 
shall have a 
nice piano, 
And won't I 
play and sing! 
I'll have a 
thousand-dollar watch, 
A chain and diamond ring; 
I 
shall have the nicest dwelling 
Upon the avenue, 
And the gayest little fellow, 
And he has the money, too. (Cm.) 
He takes me out a-riding 
Whenever he comes down, 
lie owns the nicest carriage and 
The fastest horse in town ; 
And he tells me that he loves me— 
I 
listen—wouldn't you ? 
Oh, he is the sweetest little . fellow ! 
And he's got the money, too. (Cno.)

Sweet Annie St. Clair. 
WORDS BY WILL S. RATS. 
Exclusive permission to use this song granted to Beadle & Co., 
by J. L. 
PETERS, owner of the copyright and Music 
Publisher, 599 Broadway, NeW York. 
In the springtime of life, when my young heart was 
free, 
No boy in the village was happy as me; 
This world with its troubles, and sorrows and strife 
Was a 
stranger to me all those days of my life. 
But pleasure so often takes wings to depart, 
And the first thing I 
knew I 
was robbed of my heart; 
I 
looked 'mongst the girls with precatnion and care, 
But I 
never suspicioned sweet Annie St. Clair. 
CHORUS. 
Of all the fair girls in the village so dear ! 
The fairest of all was sweet Annie St. Clair. 
She met me one beautiful morning in May, 
She was going to school—I 
had nothing to say— 
She smiled like a 
girl who some treasure had found, 
While I 
passed her by, looking down to the ground. 
" 
Have you lost anything ?" Annie said with a 
start; 
" 
Yes!" I 
meekly replied, " I've been robbed of my 
heart." 
I 
looked in her eyes, and saw robbery there, 
But I 
dared not suspicion sweet Annie St. Clair. 
That night we were talking about the bold theft, 
Of the heart and its love of which I 
was bereft ; 
And I 
told her I'd brin ,, the bold robber to grief, 
When she kissed me and told me that " she was the 
thief." 
Now what could I 
do, but to smile in her face, 
And asked her to give me her own in its place? 
So the girls in the village look at us and stare, 
But none can compare with sweet Annie St. Clair.

One O'Leary's Cow. . 
FRANK WILDER'S HUMOROUS SONG. 
Copied by permission of 0. DITSON & Co., Music Publishers, 
277 Washington :it., Boston, owners of the copyright. 
C. hi. DirsoN & Co., 'ill Broadway, New York. 
Oh, listen while I 
sing to you 
This flaming little ditty, 
About the fire that happened in 
Chicago's famous city! 
The greatest conflagration, sure, 
That ever yet was seen, 
'Twas caused by one O'Leary's cow, 
The brute so lank and lean! 
CHORITS—O'Leary's cow! O'Leary's cow 1 
'Tis so, I 
tell you now! 
'Twas the milking and the kicking 
Of one O'Leary's cow. 
It seems that Pat and Mike and Tim 
Were having quite a 
shindy— 
O'Leary's neighbors, so they say— 
The night was dark and windy; 
They thought they'd have an oyster stew, 
And wanted milk for it ; 
So out to Leary's barn they went, 
With pail, and lamp all lit! (Cinmus.) 
The old cow felt indignant, thin, 
It set her all a-nettle, 
Up went her legs, and over went 
The lamp and milking kettle ! 
And from that simple accident 
Came such distress and woe; 
Pat's oyster stew, that kicking cow, 
Near ruined Chicago! (Cnonus.)

All day long I 
hear them patter 
Up and down the peopled street, 
Oh, the music soft and gentle, 
In those busy little feet ! 
From the earth would fade the sunshine, 
And the bright and pleasant flowers, 
If we had no little footsteps 
In this weary world of ours. 
cnoitus. 
All day long I 
hear them patter 
Up and down the peopled street 
Oh ! the music soft and gentle, 
In those busy little feet. 
Wand'ring through the field and forest, 
Like the birds they speed along, 
Merry darlings of the household, 
Free from earthly care and wrong! 
Patter, patter, like the rain- drops 
On the roses, warm and sweet, 
Fall the lovely fairy echoes 
Of those busy little feet. (Crtonus.) 
When the strife of earth is ended, 
And the shadows fall around, 
When we hear no more the footsteps 
Patter o'er the mossy ground ! 
In that home of light and glory, 
Where the. loved and lost shall meet, 
Gentle Saviour, kindly lead them, 
Lead those busy little feet. (Cnonus.)

I'm about to sing to you,

Fast young men that we hear of, 
One half the clever things they do, 
I'm sure you've no idea of.

Over night it's fal, lal, 
Champagne, brandy and cigar ! 
But next day how changed they are, 
For then it's Soda Water ! 
See them, in their wild attire, 
"Ladies, touch not, but admire!" 
Is the thought their looks inspire ; 
If you meet them walking, 
We girls, they think, should all expire ! 
If to ug they're only talking. (CHo., 
All the latest styles they try, 
And the charming snits they buy 
Cost so much, that, really I, 
Wonder how they do it. 
A glass they wear, too, in the eye, 
Though I'm sure they can't see through it! 
Gentlemen, my song is done, 
have I 
your approval won ? 
Pray believe it's all in fun, 
That I 
satirize you. 
A. lady's tongue will have it's run, 
Though you know we idolize you! (Cu.)

You may praise the joys of sparking 
Beside a 
blazing fire, 
With grandma sitting near you 
And grandpa sitting higher; 
But for sparking in the winter, 
When the earth is white with snow, 
There is nothing like a 
sleighride, 
CHORUS—Oh 
no, oh no. 
Oh no, oh no, 
There is nothing like a 
sleighride, 
Oh no, oh no. 
Then harness up your pony 
Before your finest sleigh, 
Provide yourself with money, 
To treat upon the way. 
Get up, my trusty " Bobbin," 
Away like wind you go. 
Is there any thing like sleighing? 
Oh no, oh no. ( Caonus.) 
So wrap your furs about you, 
And leave the blazing fire, 
Where grandma sits beside you, 
And grandpa dozes higher ; 
For your sparking in the winter, 
When the earth is white with snow, 
There is nothing like a 
sleighride, 
Oh no, oh no. (CnoRns.)
