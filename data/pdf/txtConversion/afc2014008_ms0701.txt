Few contemporary vegetable gardeners p
lant by the moon or practice f
ertility
 
magic (
though some do), but folklore connected w
ith vegetable gardens continues
 
to f
lourish.  Orally transmitted beliefs, concerning several aspects of s
uch
 
gardening, are w
idely shared:  p
lanting practices;  comparative economics;
 
aesthetics of f
ood consumption and of the garden i
tself;  nutritional aspects.
 
Home vegetable gardening i
s now on the i
ncrease, and beliefs  -- true or not
 
so true -- are spreading accordingly.  We h
ave been studying agricultural
 
change and i
ts attitudinal correlates, and f
ind i
n this developing folklore
 
an i
nteresting and easily studied example.  Data h
ave been gathered from a
 
broad spectrum of gardeners.

The well-known children's folksong beginning "Old you ever think / As the hearse

n a
lmost medieval  f
ashion, the gruesome decomposition of
 
a human corpse.  Considering that adult society h
as made a v

the subject of death, the song exemplifies the child's tendency to f

The "Cajuns" of South Central  Louisiana are descendents of the French Acadlans
 
expelled from Canada i
n the early 1
800's.
 I
n Louisiana. while maintaining
 
many of the traditional e
lements of their culture, they have developed new forms
 
of expression, of which the Running Mardi Gras i
s one of the most exciting.  The
 
Mardi Gras i
s "run" on horseback, to the f
arms surrounding the town of Mamou.
 
The costumed revelers s
ing, dance, and commit general mayhem at each f
arm before
 
running on to the next.  This presentation i
s i
n the form of a motion p
icture
 
f
ilm,  following the travels of a group of more than a hundred men and horses,
 
w
ith explanation of the "run" and of details of costume, song, dance, and chicken-
chasing.

TOWARD THE CHINESE I
N N
INETEENTH-CENTURY CALIFORNIA.
 
Based on  newspaper articles dating back to the  Alta CaZifornia papers of the
 
early 1
850's, early anti-Chinese pamphlets, v
arious State and federal  documents,
 
etc., this paper w
ill trace the changes i
n attitudes toward the Chinese.  They
 
were at f
irst regarded as p
icturesque and quaint persons w
illing to do menial
 
work f
or l
ittle pay, but l
ater came u
nder continuous attack from the press, the
 
politicians, and the l
abor unions as "burlesques to humanity."  As soon as white
 
men realized that the wealth of the m
ines would eventually be gone, they began
 
c
laiming that the Chinese were a menace to health, that they degraded l
abor,
 
that they were i
mmoral, and that their assimilation i
nto the mainstream of Ameri-
can society was i
mpossible.

A number of stories describing T

ethnographic "expedition" to a technologically conservative f
ishing v

the south l
ittoral of Ecuador.  T

s responsible for many dastardly acts,
 
such as beating up l
one men and i
mpregnating married women when their husbands
 
are away.  A n
umber of residents say they h
ave seen T
in-Tin, or been molested
 
by h
im;  t
heir descriptions vary, but he i
s generally described as being one
 
meter tall and red-skinned;

both their products and their processes.  The creative process i

"MEMORATES" AND "URBAN S

NDEX TO URBAN
 
ADJUSTMENT.
 
The paper r
eports the r
esult of folklore research among an urban enclave of
 
w
hite southern m
igrants i
n southeastern L
os Angeles County. Two folktale genres
 
were collected: the Personal Memorate and the Urban S
aga. The l
atter genre was
 
set u
p by the authors, and i
s defined as a recurring story told i
n the m
igrant
 
community about their experiences after arriving i
n the c
ity.  The content of
 
this folklore i
s analyzed, common themes are i
solated, and these data are pre-
sented as an i
ndex to urban adjustment.

. Imnediate Background
 
The plan to be proposed in the following outline is the result of
 
discussions at the Conference of the California Folklore So:iety held a:
 
American River College in April, 1972.  A
t the business meeting luncheo;i
 
it became obvious--to me n at least--that many people in our Society, ha-r
ing
 
in mind the excellent example of Marjorie McLain's project ,

College, wanted something done along; the f
ollowing lines: (
1) t
o awaken
 
community colleges and regional undergraduate universities t
o the need "
or
 
trained instructors t
o assist with or t
o c
onduct properly disciplined ac
.ademic
 
programs in folklore in response to the pre�,c
cnt d
emand for ethnic studies and
 
multi-disciplined projects now emerging; (
2) to persuade graduate schools that
 
part of their responsibility in training f
olklorists  might well be to ;
arovide
 
opportunities f
or experience in applied folklore, such as working with -
.
ommun-
ity groups and undergraduate students in the discovery and '
anderstandin
,r o
f
 
their own cultural materials; and (3) t
o enhance the role of the Califo:-nia
 
Folklore Society in coordinating or articulating the movement of students
 
between graduate schools and community c
ollege courses or projects, wit
�i a
 
view t
o providing valuable experience and personal contacts.
 
In a moment of enthusiasm I made such a proposal.  The apparent co:1census
 
was highly favorable; hence, I must now f
ollow through with a plan.  I i
nvite
 
reactions to it, particularly from ;
:
he professors who design graduate c,i
rric-
ulums in f
olklore and mythology, the administrators in community colleges and
 
undergraduate universities who plan or approve ethnic or multi-cultural
 
studies in their institutions, and the officers of the California Folklore
 
Society, without whose endorsement and support the idea could not work.
 
II. Broader Background

His introductory paper includes comments relevant to the subject here:
 
Let me first support my credo that Folklore should push for
 
the major, the minor, the 1
l
.A., the Ph.D., in short thc
: works....
 
The humanistic values in folklore studies are especially appealing
 
in the contemporary climate of opinion..., The ration today is con-
cerned about its underprivileged, its poor, its blacks, its Appala-
chian whitos , its ethnics , its Indians , its Chicanos , its forgotten
 
and left-outs.  While I will not equate the folk with the "lower
 
orders," a
:; the Victorian folklorists were wont to do. I :
.
g
ym ready
 
to see, and claim, plenty of opportunities f
or the folklorist among
 
such tradi';ion-oriented groups.
 
the problem for the new doctor of folklore, and his sponsors, is to
 
persuade a department composed of doctors of English. or anthropology,
 
or history , or foreign languages , or music, to give him a home....
 
The question is, how do we get doctors of folklore onto the faculties
 
of many of the 2600 institutions of higher learning in the United
 
States?
 
In r
esponse to professor Uorson , Professor Robert A
. Georges (
UCLA) made some
 
comrents also relevant here:
 
The recomm,�
,ndations that he makes are not new ones, for such tactics
 
as convincing deans and department chairmen that every educational
 
institutio:z should have at least one folklorist on i
';s staff, working
 
for the establishment and implementation of folklore courses and "mini-
programs, " and attempting to get budgetary support for folklore studies
 
are all oli methods that have succeeded in some places and failed in
 
others ani which will continue to do so in the future.... So far as
 
instituting or adding courses or programs is concerned this is determined
 
by the desires and personalities of those who are doing the proposing
 
and upon t
.ne effectiveness with which they communicate with administrators.
 
And finally, comments by Professor Robert H
. Byington (
Point Park College,
 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania):
 
The folklorist, whose purview, unlike that of other specialists, take.+
 
in a sector of just about everything, is in an excellent position to take
 
part in, cair 9 or direct one of these enterprises zl.e., interdisciplinary
 
program
s which se4m, as I say, to be on the increase everywhereoe.o
 
Closely allied with this trend is what might be called the Ethnic
 
Recognition Movement; the melting pot is on its way out , and what did
 
not melt is soon , we hope , to be rediscovered , defined , and revitalized.
 
This process , which will go on for years , in and out of the academy,
 
must necessarily involve the folklorist as a key figure.  His skills
 
and knowledge are probably more important to this movement than those
 
of any other discipline , and the support he can provide through formal.
 
instruction and work in the field is bound to elicit more and more
 
respect.
 
The need for folklorists is increasing in our western state s, In California
 
the Community Colleges are moving rapidly toward developing curriculums in
 
American atudies, Black Studies, Ethnic Studies, Multi-Cultural Studies;
;
 
.
3-
Ch:Lcano Literature, Folklore and Mythology, Oral History projects, Ethnic
 
Ar -;
s and CraftF;--many approaches reflecting various local interests.  In-
se:-vice training for teachers of such courses in the lower schools is
 
of:'icially provided f
or in a recent addition to the California Education
 
Co{1e, as follows:
 
SEC. 3
E;.  Section 13345 of the Education Code, as amended and
 
renumbered by Chapter 4
38 of the Statutes of 1
971, is amended
 
and renumbered to read:
 
1
3344. On and after July 1
, 1
974, each school with a substantial
 
population of students of diverse ethnic backgrounds shall provide
 
an in-service preparation program designed to prepare teachers and
 
other professional school service personnel to understand and
 
effectively relate to the history, culture, and current problems
 
of these students and their environment.  For purposes of this
 
article a school shall be considered to have a substantial popula-
tion of students of diverse ethnic backgrounds where 25 percent or
 
more of all the students in the school are of diverse ethnic
 
backgrounds.
 
SEC. 3r'
. Section 1
3346 of the Education Code, as amended and
 
renumberec: by Chapter 4
38 of the Statutes of 1
971, is amended
 
and renumbered to read:
 
13344.1.  The Department of Education shall develop a list of
 
approved courses which shall be considered acceptable f
or meeting
 
the requirements of this article..  The department 8ball cause a
 
list of approved courses to be published and distributed to
 
interested teachers, administrators, and governing boards of
 
school districts.  The department shall be responsible for
 
coordinating the efforts of school districts and colleges to
 
develop adequate course offerings to satisfy the requirements
 
of this article.
 
1
3344.2  In-service programs designed to fulfill the require-
ments of this article may include, but need not be limited to g 
courses offered by community colleges and colleges and universi-
ties approved by the State Board of Education.  A district may
 
provide an in-service pro;ram consisting in whole or in part of
 
preparation other than college courses.
 
Such a program shall be developed cooperatively with the
 
Department of Education, and shall have prior approval of the
 
Department of Education.  An in-service program which meets the
 
intent of this article shall encompass the history, culture,
 
and current problems of the students of diverse ethnic background.
 
All college courses approved by the Department of Education
 
for the purposes of this article shall be acceptable f
or salary
 
credit purposes by any school district.  District in-service pro-
grams shall specify an amount of equivalent credit which shall
 
be acceptable for salary credit purposes in the school district
 
providing the in-service program.
 
13344.3  The Department of Education shall provide in its
 
budget for the necessary funds to employ appropriate staff to
 
implement the intent of this article.
 
III. What the Graduate Schools Can Do
 
I hope we can persuade those graduate schools which offer M
.A. or
 
Ph.D. programs in folklore to include in their curriculum (not necessarily
 
required, but acceptable if a student chooses to go this route) a substantial
 
block of work in directed field or intern experience in applied folklore.
 
1
. For one quarter or semester a graduate student could be assigned
 
to a community college or university or a school district to work
 
in applied folk culture projects,
, for example:
 
(a) Teach courses or conduct workshops in folklore,
 
mythology, or ethnic traditions*
 
(b) Assist in or actually develop studies and projects
 
in local folk-group lore among students or teachers.
 
(c) Assist in or develop community oriented projects for
 
the college in order to bring the college and the
 
ethnic groups it serves closer together.
 
(d) Assist with or produce folk plays, dance fes';ivals,
 
local history pageants, radio or TV documentaries, etc.
 
(
e) Assist with or direct collecting, exhibiting., and
 
interpreting elements of the material culture of a
 
community, occupation, or ethnic group*
 
2. The graduate student would work under the general supervision of
 
his professor, but would also be considered an adjunct member of
 
the faculty of the college to which he is assigned, working in
 
a department or administrative unit there.
 
3
. Placement in the assignment could by arranged either by his
 
graduate studies professor or by the Calif ornia Fol
.clore Societ;r.
 
4
. '
yhe student should earn credit toward his degree f
o
:^ such work,
 
the amount to be iecided by his professor or graduate departmen;.
 
If funds are available, he should also receive paym nt for his
 
expenses and an honorarium or salary for his servicas.
 
IV. I
Jhat the Community Colleges and Undergraduate Universities Cali Do
 
A trained graduate student of folklore serving as an intern or asEistant
 
should be a welcome addition to the faculty of a community college or
 
university.  He could provide the discipline of the folklorist to projects
 
and activities for which regular faculty members are not trained or do not
 
have sufficient -
t
ime s and his presence would stimulate more personal and
 
-
5-
meaningful conta ,'
t with those students whose cultural backgrounds have
 
set them apart from the traditional college curriculums.  In a recent
 
letter Professor Uaylaud D
. Band wrote, "With you, I have long believed
 
that much of the mischief and t
rouble, not to say tragedy, that young
 
people get into c
ould be avoided if their energies and talents had earlier
 
been riveted on .
some of the more basic aspects of their lilies.  But particularly
 
activities and concerns with the family, local community, and local history.
 
Much of the difficulties t
hat befall young people, I feel, comes from their
 
rootless existence."  that is what the provisions in the California 3
ducation
 
Code, cited above, are all about; and the teacher who can get closest to the
 
heart of the problem is the folklorist.
 
Community colleges, therefore, might consider the following:
 
1
. For one quarter or semester, under this p
lan the college would
 
accept the graduate student as an assistant, intern, or adjunct
 
faculty member.
 
2
. '
2he proposed projects, activities, or courses would be agreed
 
upon in advance.  The graduate student would be assigned to a
 
local faculty member for immediate supervision, and his activities
 
would be subject to the institution's policies, procedures, and
 
budgetary limitations.  To the greatest extent possible within
 
these controls ; however, he would be free to experiment, conduct
 
research
., and utilize available resources for the success of his
 
assignment.
 
3
. '
Jith the aid of selected graduate students, the colleges in
 
California can develop courses to meet the demands cited above
 
for in-service training of teachers in ethnic culture.
 
It might b
E , reasonable to hope that if the graduate student and the
 
ins4:itution to which he is assigned find the experience mutually satisfactory,
 
and if the courses or projects lead to the establishment of a new faculty
 
r
)os:
:.tion, the student may be considered to fill it.  This arrangement,
 
however, should not imply any commitment on either side.
 
V. What the California Folklore Society Can Do
 
The role of the California Folklore Society, as seen in this plan, would
 
be that of expediter.  Thus the Society would gain both visibility and
 
influence in applied folklore here in the West.  The discipline of the
 
:
f
olklorist would be up-graded, a needed service would be performed both
 
for public education and for graduate students, to whom we do after all
 
-
6-
have a professional responsibility.  And a closer relationship would be
 
established between the graduate schools and the community colleges or t
he
 
school districts electing; to participate.
 
To coordinate this long-term (
or possibly endless) project, the
 
California rolklore Society should appoint a standing committee.  In its
 
initial stages the plan could be guided by the regional vice presidents.
 
the committee's duties might be as follows:
 
1
. To see that this plan (
or any such plan as might emerge) is brought
 
to the attention of (
1) the folklore departments of graduate schools
 
with encouragement for them to enter into the operation; and (
2) the
 
community colleges and school districts with encouragement for C
lem
 
to utilize these services.  As a pilot program perhaps only three or
 
four graduate students should be selected for an equally limited
 
number of projects.
 
2
. To provide leadership (
if it is wanted) in negotiating -t
he terms
 
of the intern's assignment, including (a) payment of expenses, f
ree
 
housing if possible, and other remuneration available; and (b) t
ke
 
nature of the assignment as the community college or district
 
foresees its needs and as graduate students are found qualified
 
f
or specific assignments.
 
3
. To be available f
or consultation if their help is requested, but to
 
remain apart from the program if they are not needed,
 
4
. To explore ways to give recognition to undergraduate students whc
 
might make valuable contributions to folklore studiee, or multi-
cultural understanding as a result of this plan.
 
5
. To solicit grants-in-aid for the implementation and e
;upport of
 
the plan.
 
VI.  What I Can Do to Help-
--If I Am Needed 
As the formulator of this plan, I feel an obligation to contribute
 
whatever I can to its success if it is adopted.  In June, 19;
'3, I shall
 
ratire.  My writing and speaking commitments will probably increase, but
 
there are a few things I can offer to do if I am needed:
 
1. I could contact (with a form letter s I suppose) some 200 community
 
colleges and universities in California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington,
 
Nevada, Idaho, and Utah outlining the plan and offering the
 
services of the California Folklore Jociety.
 
2. I could offer to visit a college, if it is interested
. in the plan,
 
and (a) make a speech to the student body illustrating the
 
interesting aspects of folklore, or (b) meet with administrators
 
and faculty to discuss possible projects.  Through local funds the
 
community college could probably defray the expenses of the visit.
 
3
. I could meet with the California Folklore Society committee and help
 
coordinate the correspondence involved in the plan.
 
4
. In institutes, workshops, and summer sessions I could work with
 
secondary school and community colle t teachers on the uses of
 
folklore in the schools, with a view to stimulating an interest
 
in working with graduate schools and CFS on this plan.
 
This is essentially what I had in mind when I mentioned it at the CFS
 
meeting
, last April.  I submit it now to the officers of the Society for
 
whatever use they may wish to make of it.

April 10, 1973
 
To:  Board members, Califoi^nia Folklore Society
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, President
 
Subject:  Board meeting
 
Having heard no objection: to my a
2
ii&;estion that our next board
 
meeting be callod for the evening before the Dominguez Hills
 
meeting, the matter has been so arranged . We will convene at
 
8
:00 p.m. in the Business Suite, Room 135-6, of the Rodeway Ina,
 
1919 test Artesia Boulevard, Compton, California (
90220), on
 
the evening of May 17, 1973.  i had hoped to invito you  o my
 
home for this session, but decided against it in v ew of the
 
difficulties in transportation for out-of-town board members.
 
The Rodeway Inn is where most of us wt U be staying for the
 
duration of the meeting; it is a five-minute drive from

Here is your refund check.  Haven't finished the balancing yet... have
 
two dinners owed me, am hoping to show a profit which will not be
 
very large... if any.  I've had to go back to the grievance which should
 
be written by next Tuesday.  We all feel very good about the Folklore
 
meeting and enjoyed it, but can't say that for the grievance.  Sam got
 
his brief case back.  I will be writing thank you letters next week...
 
I have my list for Dominguez... where else do you recQ Wed.,,. should
 
I send one to your place?  Thanks for everything.

'C T
:  Panel Discussion on "Problems and Perspectives in the Study of ►

" to be Held at the 1973 '
Meeting of the California
 
Folklore Society at Dominguez Hills
 
Mr. S
am Hinton, program chairman f
or the 1973
 meeting of the California
 
Folklore Society in Dominguez Hills, has informed me that the panel di;
,cussion
 
on "
Problems and Perspectives in the Study of ►
Folk Beliefs+" has been s
cheduled.
 
The precise day and time(s) are not yet s
et, but once I have heard from Mr.
 
Hinton, I s
hall let you know.
 
In accordance with my initial request, Mr. Hinton will t
ry to schedule
 
the panel f
or t,,
r
o consecutive sessions.  During the first of the two s
essions,
 
e
ach panel participant T
rill be able to make a brief presentation (
of about 10
 
minutes), presenting what he conceives to be a meaningful problem and/or
 
perspective in the study of "folk beliefs."  The remainder of that initial
 
session will be devoted to discussion and interaction among the panel
 
participants.  The s
econd of the two s
essions, as I envision it, will be
 
an occasion f
or members of the listening audience and the panelists to
 
engage in a dialogue and discussion, either about issues raised or
 
proposals made by the panel participants during the initial s
ession or about
 
other matters relevant to the study of "folk beliefs."
 
Since each of the panelists will
 
different problem and/or perspective,
 
provocative and stimulating ones.  It
 
the participants and to help keep thin
 
directions.
 
be addressing himself to a somewhat
 
the sessions have the potential to be
 
will be my pleasure to introduce
 
gs moving in productive and profitable
 
Should you have any questions about, or suggestions for, the panel,
 
please let me kno�,
►.  '
Meanwhile, once I know when the s
essions are to be
 
held, I will let you all know immediately.

Since t
alking briefly with you in Austin about the possibility of having
 
a s
ession on "
folk belief
 /
superstition" at the California Folklore S
ociet'1"Y
 
have d
iscussed the matter with s
everal other individuals who indicated to t
oe
 
their interest in participating in s
uch a venture.  After t
alking with the
 
other three (Mike Jones, Ken K
etner, and Jerry Richter), it s
eemed to me that
 
a panel d
iscussion, r
ather than a s
et of p
apers, might be more realistic.
 
The f
ive of us are all c
oncerned, in s
ome way, with the c
oncept of "
folk
 
belief/superstition," the assumptions that f
olklorists tend to make about
 
"beliefs," and/or t
he most meaningful or intellectually defensible way(s)
 
t
o deal with those d
ata that have conventionally been labelled "
folk beliefs,
 
s
uperstitions, etc."
 
On the basis of t
hese c
onversations, and in light of the f
act that t
ime
 
i
s r
apidly p
assing, I t
ook it upon myself t
o write t
o S
am Hinton t
o request
 
program t
ime f
or s
uch a panel.  A copy of my letter to S
am is attached.
 
I hope that you will still be interested in being involved in s
uch a panel,
 
that I have not "misrepresented" the problem about which you might like to
 
speak, and t
hat you will (
if the panel c
an be s
cheduled) be one of the
 
participants.
 
It is my plan f
or those of us who do c
onsent to participate to try to
 
g
enerate a meaningful structure for the panel s
o as to minimize duplications
 
and t
o explore as many "
problems and perspectives" as time and our limitations
 
permit.  If each of us c
an deal (
as I have s
uggested to S
am that I think we
 
c
an) with a s
omewhat different "
-
problem" or "
perspective," then the discussion
 
which f
ollows s
hould have s
ome s
ound base and s
hould move in profitable
 
directions.  A
s moderator, I
 would try to keep things g
oing and to discourage
 
unnecessary d
igressions.
 
Please let me know if we c
an c
ount on you.  Meanwhile, if and when I hear
 
f
rom S
am, I
 will let you know.  '

I assume that there is still the opportunity t
o ask for "
time and s
pace"
 
on the program for the 1973 meeting of the California Folklore Society.  If
 
s
o, I would appreciate your considering s
cheduling a panel discussion on
 
"
Problems and Perspectives in the Study of '
Folk Beliefsf."
 
It is the judgment of a number of CFS members that the concept of "folk
 
belief" and the assumptions t
hat are implicit in past and many c
urrent studies
 
of what are called "folk beliefs" need to be critically examined and evaluated.
 
Five individuals have indicated their interest in, and willingness to participate
 
in, such a discussion:  Professor Bess Lomax H
awes, Department of Anthropology,
 
California State University, Northridge; Professor Kenneth L
. Ketner, Department
 
of Philosophy, Texas Tech University, Lubbock; Professor Michael Owen
: Jones.
 
Folklore and Mythology Group, UCLA; and Mr. Gerald J
. Richter. Folklore and
 
Mythology Group, UCLA.  I have agreed to s
erve as panel organizer and
 
moderator.
 
As we presently conceive of the discussion, it should consist of two
 
parts (
and thus be scheduled f
or t,,
;
o s
essions--preferably two consecutive
 
ones
}.  In the first part (
session), each of the panel participants will make
 
a brief presentation, each of which will deal with a different "
problem" or
 
"perspective."  Bess will t
alk about the problems in dealing with "
folk
 
belief" as a "form" or "
genre" of folklore, particularly in the classroom.
 
Xetner plans to t
alk about the continuing influence of Frazer's analysis of
 
"magic" and will discuss s
everal critical analyses of rm zer's
-c
oncepts and
 
assumptions written by philosophers.  Richter intends to present
-a s
cheme
 
for differentiating between what he is t
entatively c
alling "
self g
enerated"
 
and "
learned" beliefs and ritual behaviors.  Jones will explore s
ome possible
 
"
new directions" that students of "
folk beliefs" might c
onsider.  If I enter
 
into the "
presentation phase" at all, I plan to discuss the intellectual bases
 
for the existence of the concept "folk belief" and to offer some hypotheses
 
concerning the reasons for the nature of existing studies :
g
i
n the s
ubject.
 
The s
econd part (
session) would be !
evoted to discussion among the
 
panelists and interaction between the.panelists and members of the audience.
 
Hopefully, the earlier remarks by the panelists will provide a "
springboard"
 
to a discussion of both more detailed and r
a
:1-it:ed issues and also provide an
 
opportunity for others with s
1nzilar concerns to airy t
1
h
 eir views and t
o present
 
what they conceive to be viable alternatives or s
oiuti
.o :

are articulated by the panelists or !hich are raised by members cf the audience.

DominguiU Hills, California
 
Pear Polly:
 
have been shockingly remiss in not writing you before.  I will not bore
 
�
1
7ou with a recounting, of all the reasons for the delay but just plain apolo—
 
ize.  I really am sorry; this should have been taken care of months ago.
 
The meat of the matter is that 1 have at last communicated with most of th -
'
!
�
'
:� board members and the California i
�
'olklore .
society will be delighted t
(-1
 
accept the kind invitation of your president to conduct its .
3pring 19'13
 
meetings on your campus.  The Board members also join me in my pleasure
 
that you are willing to accept the job of Arrangements Vhairman.  It might
 
be appropriate for me to write a formal letter on both these points to
 
your president.  1
. you aEi ee, would you let me know his name, as I am
 
currently on vacation in Oregon and haven't access to the usual averlunic
 
i rosters.
 
1 had hoped by now to be able to tell you the name of the :
grogram Chairmar,
 
with whom you will be working; however, the matter is still up in the air.
 
You could, however, if you wish, get started on the first job at hand,
 
which is to determine the best possible dater for the meeting.  This mean:
 
checking your own college calendar as well as -representative calendars
 
from colleges such as :
'`V
_C which are on the semester system and those
 
such as U C L A  which are on the quarter system, to make sure you don't hit
 
exam week or some such unpropitious time.
 t
i
e also make an attempt to avoiu
 
V:
aster :
weekend an
al Passover.  A final consideration is that it would be
 
.
lice to keep our meeting as separated as possible from the annual meeting
 
of the :
southern California Academy of Arts and Sciences in which a number
 
of folklorists now participate; Joan Rman Perkal (
779—
'(600) or ;
dayland
 
Nand would probably know what their dates are by now.  Otherwise, our
 
meeting
; can be held any time in the spring
y; -- normally between March first
 
and May fifteenth -- at the convenience of the host institution.
 
1
'll w
rite you a more formally couches: letter later, which you can put in
 
your file alo W5- w
ith all the other kudos you'll receive, I
'm sure, for
 
carrying out this somewhat onerous but honorable chore.  This letter is
 
just to let you know the whole matter hasn't been totally forgotten.  If
 
you need to reach me, I shall be at Box 8
5, Tolovana Park, Oregon, until
 
September first, and then out of pocket until Oeptember fifteenth, when
 
I shall be back on the jq
.b at Valley Aate.
 I hope you are working in
 
some kind of vacation for yourself; I
've been teaching an inordinate amount,
 
until last week, at, Zortland Mate University and am about ready for a spot
 
of r
. and r
. myself.
 
Cordially,
 
I
 
yr
 
f
'
.:.  On rereading this, I discover I sound a bit peremptory especially
 
on the matter of the dates, as though you had just been holding your breL ,

ince
 
you were out I
'll
. have to rut my glaomy news in
 
written farm.  I talked with the Secretary of the
 
College and :
rith several other aAninist

,tors about
 
bringing the conference here.  They vointed o
ut to
 
me that we have no overnight .
facilities anywhere near
 
the campus.  (
The nearest is a ?
Toliday Inn near the
 
General Naspital, and it is right an the fr(-eway).
 
The parkin; would be extra tight on F
ridays.  It seems
 
that the only conferences held here are one-day
 
Saturday affairs.  Nor did anyone give me any encourage-
ment about holding such a meeting here in 174.
 
Discouraging!  One department chairman suggested that
 
the Kellogg campus (
Cal Poly Pomona) would have the
 
facilities.  They ap.narently have reasonably decent
 
dormitories there, and some spacious meeting rooms.
 
I don't know if anyone there is interested in folklore,
 
but it might be a possibility.

Lear Bess,
 
It was good to get your letter and know that Dominguez Hills will
 
be the host for the California Folklore Society in the Spring.
 I
 
admire your stamina for teaching summer school; Oregon would have
 
been ideal because LA was miserably hot.
 
Currently I
'm working on establishing a meeting time as you suggest.
 
I got a l-
-tier off to Dr. Hand, also have the dates for the South-
west Anthropology convention, April 18 to 20,  in San Francisco at
 
the St. Francis.
 Also I
'll check on what's doing at Long Beach
 
and Los Angeles State... keeping in mind for all of these that
 
there are exam weeks -rlus Easter and Passover.
 
Will get a note off to Barbara LaPan.
 She made such a good pre-
sentation at the Fullerton Folklore meeting that I prevailed upon
 
her to make a trip to Dominguez and talk to my folklore class.
 
They were delighted with the presentation.
 I will be more than
 
glad to have her assistance.  My main problem .
is that I can
 
rarely get away from the Dominguez campus, so most everything
 
will have to be done by letter and telephone.
 
Several of my students have volunteered to help.
 Possibly we
 
can reward some of these people b
1T  naming them on a committee
 
who lent assistance or some such thing... but I would prefe-
_ , 
to wait and see who really does pitch in.
 So far I
've lined
 
up a student from Long Beach and one from USC and some of
 
our local people.
 
As for the formal arrangements, Dr. Leo Cain is our college
 
president.
 I
'll enclose his address and also the name of our
 
vice president, dean, and department chairman so that you could
 
send a carbon of the letter to them.
 It is emphasized in our
 
school
. that we are also to be of some value to the community
 
at large (but I Hardly need tell you about that).
 As I said
 
before the school is quite receptive to the idea o_
' the meetin,_;.
 
ThJ_s is my first venture as an Arrangements chairman, therefore
 
I am open to suggestions, advice, what have you.  When I get
 
the dates cross checked and find what I t
"
_linl- i
s .
;
;r  be a suitable
 
one,  I
'll check with you.
 
We aren't the St. Francis, but hopefully we will be able to offer
 
some Southern California hospitality.

Dear Hector:
 
I have reread your proposal with regard to Applied Folklore.  What I
 
said about it in my letter to you of recent date, I still hold.  It i
s well
 
drawn, practical, and possible of attainment.
 
I cannot speak for t
he UCLA academic program in folklore, but 1 am
 
sure that Professor D
. K
. Wilgus, and members of the Folklore and Mythology
 
Group :
night view it with favor as part of our general plan of expansion and
 
service to the academic community.
 
If I mistake not, there have been over the years a few high school
 
students as part of an Honors Program who have come to the University to
 
study f
olklore.  I have had a couple myself and found that they did
 
excellent work.
 
I am sure that your proposition will be on the agendaeo t  C S
.
 
Insofar as the research arm of the UCLA Folklore Program i
s concerned,
 
namely the Center, I can assure you that students coming here from the
 
community colleges and elsewhere will get help on all of their projects, a
s
 
in the past.
 
I am sure that folklore installations up and down the state will try
 
to cooperate in any may that they can.
 
The arrangement of courses and credits, of course, i
s an academic
 
v
4tter and if this aspect i
s involved in the program, it will have to be
 
dealt with according to University regulations.
 
Professor Hector H
. Lee - 2 -
 February 9

I assume that your proposition will come up under Old Business or
 
some other suitable rubric  at the business meeting of the California
 
Folklore Society in l
-ay.  I do hope that you will be there to speak for
 
it, and some of the rest of us who voted for the suggestion in Sacramento,
 
will be there to help out.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Bess,
 
Happy St. Patrick's Day!
 
For a wonder, I still have the information about partcipants in last
 
year's CFS meetings, and here's the one you were asking about:
 
Mrs. Phyllis Quinn
 
470 East 7th Street
 
Chico, California  95926
 
Phone:
 343-5066
 
Her paper was called RHYMING PLAY AND ITS SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE.
 I hope
 
the address is still correct.
 
I just had a letter from Hector asking me to serve with you on a nomi-
nating committee, but am going to have to write back and ask him to
 
decide whether I can do it or not.
 I plan to go to the meeting at So-
noma State, but only for the firEt day;
 on the 27th (Saturday) I
'm
 
slated to do a program for the Community Concert Association in Fort
 
Bragg, and so will not be on hand for the business meeting that after-
noon.
 If Heck thinks that's all right,  I
'd be honored to work with
 
you and Tom . . .
 
Leanne has finished all her course work and has passed her Comps and
 
Orals with flying colors;
 nothing left for the PhD but the thesis,
 
which is already well in h
ard.  She plans to have it done and turned
 
in in about ten months.  Just yeatserday she was awarded a nice Thesis
 
Research Fellowship of $3000, to beging next September.  She is xXV1
 
leaving for Arizona f
an a couple of weeks (having persuaded her Depart-
ment that they can get by without her teaching Spanish in the spring
 
quarter) and will start the final putting together.
 The thesis is on
 
Havasupai music and language (the degree will be in Linguistics),  and
 
I fondly think it will be a work of some significance.
 
Matt is an Assistant Librarian III at UCSD, in charge of the afternoon
 
and evening shifts at the Science and Engineering Libnry.  He still
 
needs about four courses to graduate, and will get back to taking them,
 
one at a time, om of these days . . . Meanwhile, he's enjoying the job
 
and the freedom occasioned by his four-day (ten-hour days) work week .
 
Would you please send us Nick's address?  He called when he moved to
 
Del Mar, but I characteristically lost his address and have not got in
 
touch with him again, as ww want to do.
 
Leslie sends her love -- and so do I.

Editor's Report:
 D.K. Wilgus.
 
1
8 manuscripts have been accepted for publication plus one special_
 
edition on Don Yoderts Symposium on Folk Religion.  The University
 
of California Press is going through a retrenchment process and there
 
are numerous problems in getting the Journal printed.  We are receiving
 
a substantial subsidy (around :
;
;3,000) from the University of California
 
for editorial assistance and costs of publication.  We are now
 
dealing directly with the Kimberely Press in Goleta.  The material
 
that is being accepted for the Journal is first rate; the problems
 
are with the
, actual printing of the Journal.  Last year's statements
 
for the Journal:
 4
1
.9
,766 income, x
;
;
10,073 printing expenses, this
 
figure does not inlude overhead expenses of about k
;>
2,000.`  A suggestion
 
was made to approach the local book dealers to take advertise in
 
the Journal to implement the income of the Journal.  The possibilities
 
of having the Journal printed privately were exr
)lored, but in view
 
of the subsidy of the Tniversity of California Press ;to the Journal,
 
it does not seem feasible at this time to take steps in this direction.
 
The editor was conunended by the Board for the excellence of the Journal.
 
Crock Editor's Report:
 Barbara LaPan Rahm.
 
A proposed budget for the Crock was distributed.  The printing
 
costs were proposed on the basis that California State University,
 
Northridge, do the printing.  Subscription rates of x

issues was agreed upon.  An announcement of the Crock rates as well
 
as a subscription for will be put in Western Folklore. Scott B.
 
Smith suggested that folklore instructors take the responsibility
 
for encouraging their students to subscribe to both publications.
 
Barbara LaPan Rahm will continue as Editor for next year.  Subscriptions
 
will be solicited at tomorrow's general meeting; ,
$
,1.00 fo: 1
,
, issues,
 
renewable at annual meeting time.  Since '
'
lestern Folklore has almost
 
900 subscribers, if we had a response of at least 1/3 for the Crock
  
it would be feasible to run the newsletter without a loss.
 
Exnansion of Folklore Studies in the Calif. Educational System..Hector Le
  
If the universities wish to send out their graduate folklore students
 
to do field work on an intern system, can we make jobs available to
 
them?  A number of community colleges were interested in this proposal.
 
5 or 6 students a year could be placed in jobs, with university course
 
credit as ,t
ell as expense monies going to the student. Coordination
 
and funds for t
!iis program are needed.  1,
1estern Interstate Commission
 
for Higher Education has an internship plan in  the humanities and
 
social studies.  if they accept our proposal a student.would receive
 
about :
'
;1,$00 stipend.  W.T.C.H.E. expects the involved institution
 
to—nut uo at least Q
°600 and they will put up the rest of the money.
 
Other areas of possible funding will be investigated.  The sense of
 
the Board was that the California Folklore Society endorse this
 
proposal
. a
nd act as coordinators of this program under the Society's
 
name.  Hector Lee will serve as overall director of this program and
 
will elect a committee to assist him.  A recommendation was made
 
that the students under consideration for this program have at least
 
two years of graduate work behind them.  It was suggested that the
 
Society apply for a grant for this program.

Recognition of Society by the Community Colleges -
.Marjorie McLain.
  
Mrs. McLain reported that the California Folklore Society is not
 
on the list of approved institutions.  Because of this situation,
 
the community colleges are not permitted to become patron subscribers
 
to the Journal.  Mrs. McLain was asked to write a letter to the
 
Board of the Community Colleges to remedy this problem.  A copy of
 
this letter is to be sent to Mrs. Perkal to put into the Society's files.
 
oral Folklore Project..Bari Polanski and Scott B. Smith.
  
A recommendation was made that a committee be formed with
. both, 
faculty and graduate
t students to coordinate and organize a program
 
of oral history in folklore.
 U
.C.L.A. Oral History program has
 
both excellent facilities and trained interviewers and transcribers.
 
They have expressed in interest in the proposed folklore project
 
and the possibility of working with CFS on any future plans-to implement
 
this project. Several names of retired collegues were suggested to
 
the board as possibilites for interviews; Hector Lee, Sonoma State
 
College; A
.L. Gam Da, Denver; T
.M. Pearce, New 1
4exico; Frances Gillmore,
 
Arizona; Archer Taylor, Berkeley; Bertrand Bronson;
, Joseph Fontenrose.
 
Since the AFS is also trying to formulate an oral history project in
 
folklore, it was recommended that they be contacted by our committee.
 
Both Berkeley and U
.C.I.A. have archives where these tapes can be
 
stored. Proper care c
an be taken to see that any restrictions as to
 
use will be followed.  Michael Jones will
. be contacted to head the
 
committee to follow up on this project.  Bari Polanski and Scott B.
 
Smith as well as the in-coming student vice presidents will be contacted
 
to be part of this committee.  It was also suggested that the Society
 
anoly for grant monies to fund this project.  Another suggestion was
 
to tape the speech of the banquet speaker at the annual dinner meeting,
 
if he had no objection.

Name Change of the Society .
..
 Wayland Hand.
  
A discussion was held about the proposal at last year's meeting
 
to change the name of the California Folklore Society to the Western
 
Folklore Society.  Dr. Hand pointed out that many of the smaller
 
individual societies would be reluctant to give up their identities
 
and join a larger group,  and that spreading us out over a larger
 
geographical area would serve only to dilute our meetings.  Alan
 
Dundes felt that it was more inportant that the California students
 
have the onoortunity to meet one another and attend the meetings,
 
which would be most difficult if we began meeting in other states.
 
The Board will recommend to the membership that we retain the name
 
of the California Folklore Society.

The Place-Name Survey of the United States has asked Mr. Florian

The twenty-first annual meeting of the California Folklore Society
 
was called to order at 12:20 P
.M. by the President Bess Lomax Hawes.
 
The minutes were dispensed with and the recording secretary reported
 
that the Society has a bank account with the Santa Monica Bank, Pico
 
Branch with a current balance of '
;
512.30.
 
D.K. Wilgus gave the Editor's report.  Western Folklore has
 
accepted 18 articles plus a special edition on Folk Religion.  The
 
editor reminded the members that scope of the Journal has been
 
expanded to cover the entire world of folklore.  The Journal is
 
now dealing directly with the printer and is being subsidized by
 
the University of California to the extent of 12,000- 1
x3,000 a year
 
for editorial help.
 
T
ars. Havres commended the Anthropology Club of Dominguez Hills
 
for their decoration of the cafeteria for our luncheon-meeting.
 
Mrs. Hawes suggested a reinforcement of the resolution to
 
encourage people participating in the meetings to become members
 
of the Society.  A suggestion was made to give subscriptions to
 
WF as gifts.  A notice to this effect will be placed in the Journal
 
and in the Crock. 
Barbara LaPan Rahm gave the Crock Editor's report.  The Crock 
will be on a self-sustaining basis, the first two issues were
 
subsidized by the Ant hronology Department of California State
 
University, Northridge.  Subscription to the Crock will be X1.00
 
for 4
. issues, renewable at the time of our annual CFS meeting.  Any
 
items to be placed in the Crock should be sent directly to Mrs. Rahm.
 
Mention was made to the Society's relationship to and participation
 
in the Southern California Academy of Science.  The Society is one

of the sponsors of the SCAS.
 In addition to participating in their
 
yearly meeting, folklorists are encouraged to become members.  See
 
F
irs. Perkal for membership applications to the Academy.
 
Mr. Florian Carty was introduced.  Mr. Carty is Californiats
 
representative for a survey being done by The American Society of
 
Place Names to up-date Mr. Gudde's work on  California Place Names
 
from 1946 to the present.  A request was made to send any pertinent
 
information to Mr. Carty at 2
063 Duberry Court, 1
1estlake Village,
 
Ventura, California,  (phone:  $03- 497-7143) .
 
Mrs. Hawes suggested that the out-going student vice-presidents
 
give their help to the newly elected student vice-presidents.
 
Mrs. Hawes also discussed the progress
 A
 the California Folklore
 
Society Oral History project.  The preliminary work was done by
 
Bari Polanski and Scott B. Smith, student vice-president's from
 
the South and North.  A committee was set up to c
ontinue this
 
investigation with Michael Jones to act as coordinator and the two
 
out-going student vice-presidents and the two in-coming student
 
vice-presidents to make up the body of this committee.
 
Hector Lee gave a report on the proposal made at last year's
 
meeting to set up field work internships for graduate folklore
 
studentsin some community agency.  The roll of the Society would
 
be to coordinate this program by putting the student and the
 
interested agency together, and to seek out funds for this project.
 
A motion was passed to endorse and implement this proposal.
 
A discussion was held about changing the name of the Society from
 
the California Folklore Society to the Western Folklore Society.
 
A motion was passed to recind last year's motion to change the name
 
of the California Folklore Society.

 i
ch called me out of t
own (
in different directions !
 )
 
\ _)iiave combined t
o keep me from a proper follow-up.
 
First, let r
i
te say f
l
ow delighted I
 was t
hat the nominating c
cxmittee proposed
 
you a
s ?resident, and that you were t
;illi i
g t
o accept.  i
7iere couldn't have been
 
a Detter choice.  Tae :

ociety i
s exactly a
t the stage w
lien your exi,erience,
 
vision and wisdon will s
erve us best.  '
T
liough I
 realize your e
lection will throw
 
a few spokes into the whocis of your A

:., I am delighted
 
k
, j t
o have played a small part in the braking process; we ;
s
eed you t
oo n
iucl, t
r l
et
 
you retire.  And I hope you'll have as much E
lm at the job as I
 
D
I
 t
will "
i
his week bet out proper thank you letters t
o t
he various people who
 
l
iellied with the spring meeting, and then i
t i
s over t
o you, I
 guess.  Joan
 
Perkal t
ells we s
i
ie will f
ollow up on t
he state of the t
reasury, and she will,
 
no doubt, be writing you for i
nstructions as t

, t
o handle i
t.  (
:hiring the
 
past two years, we had i
t in a savings a
ccou i
t !
under t
he "
t
itle of
. Vie California
 
Folklore Society, with Joan and myself authorized a
s agents; I
 a
ssizae my n
ame
 
a
o off and yours on.)
 
Last
. week, I t
ook an afternoon t
o s
traightening out my CFS files, and Barbara
 
and I
 both pondered over what we f
ound therein.  I
 had had an  i
dea  of s
ending
 
t
hem a
ll up t
o you, by way of starting a s
ort of official presidential s
et of
 
records, but the more I l
ooked them over, the more they s
eemed e
ither personal
 
or redwidant.  You probably have your own f
ile of Crocks, past meeting programs,
 
revised constitutions and the l
ike.  However, should you f
eel t
hat setting  up
 
a basic s
et of files t
o be passed along from president t
o president i
s a g
ood
 
i
dea, l
et me know, and I
'll send you what seems t
o me relevant from my past two
 
year t
erm.  Also, of course, i
f you just want a s
ingle docw:ient or two, I can
 
easily xerox them and send them a
long.
 
C
ordially always,
