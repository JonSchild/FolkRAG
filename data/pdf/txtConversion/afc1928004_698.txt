RECITATION, 
n6eiteti by Lew Tatum, 
Old Gabe was old and feeble, 
He'd lived sixty years or more, 
He'd lost his wife and children, 
They bad departed long ago. 
There was no one left to cheer him, 
In his cabin built of log, 
But one fiithful friend stood near him, 
His poor old yellow dog. 
There's a 
lone grave 
On the other side of the creek, 
. 
That knows no decoration day, 
For the one that over yonder sleeps, 
Is only a 
nigger they say 
They gave him his freedom, 
And took away his home, 
lie died a 
poor vagrant uncared for and alone, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad. 
But an old yellow dog, 
That was all that he had 
They dug a 
rude hole, 
And chucked him away, 
This poor old colered slave, 
Not a 
pray( r 
for his rest 
Did any one say, 
And that yellow dog 
Lfly down on his grave, 
And there ) ou eau see hint day after day. 
And even in midnight's gloom 
And no inducement Cali get him away, 
From his place side the grave of a 
coon. 
There is a 
mighty fine monniLent close by, 
But to me that little wave looks bigger, 
For there's a 
monument money can't buy, 
A 
yellow dogs love for a nigger.

THE GLASS OF WATER AND GLASS OF WINE. 
RECITATION. 
Recited by Lew Tatum, 
There sat two glasses filled to the brim, 
On a 
rich man's table, rim to rim; 
One was ruddy and red as blood, 
The other as pure as the crystal flood 
Says the glass of wine to the paler brother, 
Let us tell our tides of the past to each other. 
I 
can tell of banquet, revel and ntyster, 
And the proudest and strongest of souls on Eastcx. 
Who fell under my touch as tho' touched with blythe; 
For when I 
was k 
rig I 
ruled at night, 
mom the bead of kings T 
tore the crown, 
From the height]) of fame ire hurled men down, 
I've tempted youth with a 
ei p 
and taste, 
That has made his future a 
barren waste. 
I've made the arm of the driver Li], 
I've sent the train from the iron mil, 
l've made good ships go down at sea, 
And the erys of the lost are dear to me, 
For they said behold how great you be, 
Fame, strength honor and genious before you fall, 
And thy might and power are over all. 
Says the glass of water. 
I 
cannot boast of a 
betrothed or a 
murderous haste, 
But I 
can tell of hearts once sad, 
By my crystal drops made light and glad, 
And brows I've laved, hands I've ccoled souls I've saved, 
I've dashed down the mountain flowed in the river, 
Played in the fountain steeped in the sunshine, 
And fell from the sky and every where, 
Gladdened the landscape and eye, 
I 
could tell of the powers of the wheel of the mill, 
That turned out the flour and ground at my will. 
1 
can tell of manhood deb.tsed by you 
That I 
have lifted and cro‘xneti a- new, 
I 
cheer, I 
help. I 
strengthen, I 
aid, 
I 
gladden the Ii art of man and maid, 
This was the tale they told each other, 
The glass cf wine and the glass of water, 
As they sat together filled to the brim, 
On a 
rich man's table rim to rim.

The old Baptis' Church on the Hill. 
By Lew Tatum, 
Bed cated to the Rev. C. C, Chapin. 
Air. Lit tie Brown Cot on the Hill. 
I 
remember the old baptis' church on the hill, 
Where 1 
wandered in days long ago; 
I 
re oember the many dear friends of my youth, 
And I 
long to recall them once more. 
I 
remember the old bell in the steeple so high, 
And my soul with joy it would fill, 
And I 
oft heave a 
sigh for those days that's gone by, 
A d 
the old Baptis church on the hill. 
Crion ns. 
It was lonely and old, and in winter it was drear, 
And the night winds could assail it at will. 
'Vet there's nothing on earth to my heart half so dear, 
As the old Baptis' church on the hill. 
Now I 
remember the preacher we all loved so well, 
As he'd stand in the wide open door; 
And his red rosy cheeks and the welcome he gave, 
And the grasp of his hand as of yore. 
I 
remember the pew where my father would sit, 
And my mother so quilt and still, 
Those scenes of my childhood I 
can never forget, 
And the old Baptis' church on the hill. 
Chorus. 
Now the old Baptis church has been torn to the ground 
And a 
new one built in its stead 
And those members who worshiped there long years ago 
They have been quietly layed with the dead. 
Their spirits have flown to a 
for better laud, 
But their names are held sacred still, 
! 
1 
oft heave a 
sigh for them Christians on high, 
And the old Baptis church on the hill. 
Chorus.

TRIG AND PICTURE SONG. 
By Lew Tatum for ?Miss Matt ie,131Iss, and snug by her 
throughout the United States. 
Your attention for awhile,

would kindly ask of you, 
To this 11 g 
I'm now holding in my Land, 
it's country s 
greatest pride, 
And for it men have died. 
make this a 
free and glorious lane., 
Now there is one who's gone. 
'Who stood the battle's storm. 
We know that he was loved b— every one, 
To the end he was true, 
Te the red white and blue. 
The father of this country Washington. 
d 
there's another yet. 
Whom we never can forget, 
Though his body is now lying in the so 
his spirit is up above. 
Mingling with he venly love, 
And resting with the angels of our God. 
II 
was his proclaimation, 
Which caused emancipation, 
And gave freedom to the slave, 
He was loved by one and all, 
And a 
nation 1110111MS his fall, 
Abraham Line In now sleeping in his grave. 
One more Ill show to you, 
And then I 
will be through, 
To your memory 1

While waiting for the train, 
lie was shot by a 
man insane, 
In a 
cowardly way Ill not mention here, 
With his family by his side, 
At Long Branch he died, 
And bravely he stood it to the end. 
But then you may rely. 
They banged Guiteau up high, 
And James A. Garfield was avenged, 
Slew-Footed Sal. 
Words by Lew Tatum. 
Music by Prof. Wilkerson. 
Now I've gct a 
gal called Slew-rooted Sal, 
And dey say she's de immage of me, 
She's cross-eyed in both her knees, 
And sings like a 
crow on a 
tree. 
She walks the streets late at night, 
The boys all try for to shoot her, 
She's a 
slasher and a 
dasher, 
And a 
third class masher, 
And the 
still persue her. 
Now these villian's know wher this gal lives, 
And they watch around the corner; 
And if they get their flzes on her. 
I 
know that she's a 
goner. 
For they are Tinian's, the deepest dye, 
And smart enough to elude her, 
She's a 
runner and a 
gunner, 
And a 
first class bummer, 
But the villian's still persued her. 
Now I've trtlked to her about running around, 
And tried for to get her to slack it, 
But she gets rl,d hot upon do spot, 
And won't listen to my racket, 
She says she am a 
thoroughbred gal, 
And I'm a 
nothing but a 
snoozer, 
I 
chewed off her nose, 
And tore off her clothes, 
And the villian's still persued her.

The moon was shining on the lake, 
The stars shone from above; 
Gazing on the water, 
My heart was filled with love; 
There I 
met my darling, 
Whose eyes with joy did beam; 
As gently I 
spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream. 
CHORUS: 
Moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh, what bliss a 
loving kiss, 
From hearts that beat with love; 
Oh ! moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh 
what bliss a 
loving kiss, 
From hearts that beat with love. 
'Tis by the margin of the lake, 
Battles have been won; 
Not by spear or sword, 
But blarney of the tongue; 
She I 
know believed me, 
As stars shone from above; 
She gently smiled upon me, 
While whisp'ring words of love.

Sweet Camille, 
Written by Jerry Coburn. 
Sung with great succesz by

Iii the hack line of the ballet, 
'Where I 
first met sweet Camille, 
As she tipped the light fantastic sweet and ga.i 
And evening after evening 
I 
watched her skip along; 
One night I 
flipped by charmer a 
bouquet, 
And in it was a 
letter 
All scented up with mush, 
Requesting that she'd grant an interv:ew,. 
She said that she would meet me 
Some evening af.3r dusk; 
So I 
went and ordered beer and feed fox twb. 
CHORUS. 
She had an appetite 
That was a 
daisy; 
She was hungry, she was dry, 
And I 
couldn't say 
Wheve she ever put away, 
Or where she stowed the oysters, beer and pie 
So when the show was over, 
She took me to her house, 
A brown-stone front up in an alley-way 
She sat me in the parlor, 
And I 
heard her tell her ma, 
She'd caught another sardine sucker meaning me. 
When she washed with soap and water 
The powdc7 f-om her face, 
t 
SWEET CAMILLE—CONTINUED. 
Her complexion was the color of ripe corn, 
And the wrinkles on her bald head 
I 
easily could trace, 
When her pretty brunette wig and crimps were gone, 
CHORUS. 
She was pigeon-toed, 
She was lap-eared, 
She's a 
corker, she's a 
plum, 
When she had off her pad, 
All the frame she ever had 
Wouldn't cast a 
clothes- pole shadow in the sun. 
She put on her greasy wrapper, 
And by my side she sat, 
She asked me if I 
wouldn't treat to beer. 
I 
thought a 
dose of onions 
tVould much improve her breath, 
For the flavor was so fierce when she was near. 
I 
gave my love a 
quarter. 
She bounded for a 
saloon, 
By the window I 
made my escape, 
I 
won't go near the show shop 
Where Camile is any more, 
For anOther dose of that would kill me dead. 
CHORUS. 
She's my epicac. 
She's an emetic, 
And her number eleven foot would fill a 
room, 
And when she perspired, 
She was very much admired, 
As a 
standing advertisement for perfume.

hump-backed bunion on her nose, 
And brick bat colored hair. 
loved her as I 
love my life, 
And she was gay you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarionette. 
CHORUS. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke. Italian Dutch, 
And every time I 
caught him there, 
You bet I 
made him dust, dust, dust. 
He played for her night and day, 
And murdered Old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold, 
He told her of his bully home 
And of his wealth untold. 
He played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat 
lie blowed the orains out of his lies4 
And spoilt his Sunday cravat. 
& 
YELLOW CLARIONETTE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turned her head, 
lie asked her if she'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to death, 
With a 
whortleberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And 1 
tried to cut my throat, 
I 
went alone to a 
beer saloon 
For a 
wooden overcoat. 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw the gal last week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a 
K tat clarionette, 
With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says old man don't fret, 
I've got two boys you bet, 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a 
yellow clarionette. 
YOUTH WITHOUT REPROOF. 
MAN FROM COMES. 
Words by JOHN M. 
TURNER. 
Sung by J. D. ROOME. 
Good evening folks, I 
have just dropped in 
To pla.‘ for you 7 and to swing my chin; 
If I 
don't suit, just call " Police I" 
And bind me over to keep the peace, 
Or lay me up on the mantel piece. 
My song relates to a 
youth named Slade, 
And biting pies was tins young man's trade; 
lie could bite any pie that he ever yet saw, 
Whether baked in the oven or served up raw, 
Fricasied pie from the hardware store. 
Cflonus. 
For he was a 
youth without reproof, 
He'd gobble a 
pie with a 
Mansard roof. 
A 
pie- us man was -Otis youth named ;; Iade, 
With a 
specialty net iii the pie-bitin: trade. 
Pies one foot thick were nothing to him— 
He'd open Ids jaws and in they'd skim ; 
Canned tripe pie just suited his taste. 
And a 
Washington pie he ne'er would waste, 
For he would stow it away in ha6te. 
But baker's pies he did most despise. 
Because he said they were stuffed with flies. 
His principal net was to stand on his eye, 
And catch in his mouth a 
home-made pie. 
For this young man was terrible fly. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
This mournful tale T 
must now conclude; 
If I 
stay longer you'll think me rude. 
But before I 
go I 
must here relate, 
That biter of pies' deplorable ;ate, 
Which happened precisely as I 
state. 
He made a 
match, to his friends surprise, 
To bite through ninety plates and pies ; 
But those big pies were stuffed with sand, 
And they gave him a 
walk in the promised land; 
o 
he's got a 
date you will understand. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
Sung by Billy Carter 
I'll sing of a 
gallant young man, 
Who was born in the town of Cohoes, 
his head was fiat as a 
bedstead slat, 
And he always wore lien-skin shoes. 
His neck was covered with scars, 
lie had freckles all over his tongue, 
His nose was hooked, his legs were crooked, 
And he look'd like a 
tramp or a 
bum. 
CHORUS. 
But lie caught the croup 
While eating soup, 
And they thought he was a 
goner, 
He got sore'.eyes, 
From looking.at pies 
In a 
grocery ' round the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texhs steer, 
Eyes like a 
soft-shell crab, 
He had the glanders, 
MAN FROM COHOES.—CoNTINtan. 
And yellow janders, 
Till they thought he would go mad. 
His bead was as big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in his feet, 
lie fell through a 
hall, 
And lit on his gall, 
And landed way out in the street. 
He'd a 
big wart on his ear, 
And a 
cancer on his back, 
While shovelling fog 
He was bit by a 
dog, 
And they pack'd him home in a 
sack. 
CHORUS. 
But his mouth got twisted, 
From eating biscuit, 
And his lungs turned inside out, 
His eye-balls grew 
on the back of his neck, 
And his teeth they all fell out. 
When he'd walk the street, 
his back would squeak, 
And he always had the blues, 
lie was long and thin, 
Like a 
piece of tin, 
This man that was born in Cohoes.

On a

And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring; 
Then you place him on th.: carpet, 
And you'll hide behind the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing;

Oh, my heart's always light when at home with my wife,

He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'ry thing nice, him I

Oh, if he attempts to cry 
When I

Just to please him I

Peek-a-boo ! peek-a-boo! & c. 
When he sunshine of yontb fades, and age bends us low,— 
like the birds, flown away; 
Then the smiles of our children ever brighten the path, 
Leading where loved ones do stray.

Will beam like a 
rain-bow in spring; 
By the sire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
Wa will listen while our children sing:

Mother Jones kent a 
snug '. itt:e grocery -;tarc. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and. plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. 
Jane ? 
What are you up to. Jane? 
girl in my life, you're up tc

girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married i 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &e. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
Itut she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKE,N.—As 
our " blessings" came into the room two 
by- two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old 'uti • dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
What are you up to Jane? &c. 
The Order of Old Burns, 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of oh.. '..ns, for gall will take the cake. 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip—password--What d 
ye 
drink? 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Bums" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze, 
THE ORDER OF OLD BUMS.—Continued. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO. 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share ' ern with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the bum is then a 
holster, 
As he samples with the keg election day.

CAPTAIN CUFF. 
As sung by Wm. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a 
fancy 
For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar. 
SPOKE.—
Yes, ladies and gentleman, for my great desire for 
Men, I 
have achieved the great and glorious title of— 
CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff 
Captain Cuff! 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar ; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi ! hi 1 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead.

And now I

For to get a

My throat is in a

THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the Gray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when this war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot. 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or be wid a 
bagnet struck; 
He can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well known, 
And feel like the King of Persia, 
When he goes. marching home. 
What is it? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great suecess by 
M mum' ant MAmc. 
It's very ,trange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day ; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is t" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as th-y saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching inc " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and 
" 
Look out for it, 
it's teethin !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
What is it, &c 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon may head I'd stand ; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
Pipe , 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of rne there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw I .13sz akev 
1.1 they wildly ask— 
What is it, 8c.c.

Don't Forget the Old Folks at Home. 
Words and Music by J. P. SHERIDAN. 
For the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind ; 
We hope they will not be offended— 
'Tis said, with intentions most kind ; 
We know as they spring up from childhood. 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom, if ever, a 
thought give 
To the old folks to lonely at home.

WE WANT A 
PRESIDENT, 
As sung b FRANK LEWIS, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates. 
Now I 
show no partiaFty, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present-taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
man who'll bring us back, the good old- times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land, and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe. for our next President. 
Our Country is a 
glorious one, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions, last September at Creedmoor 
But to make our rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in office who will violate their trust, 
By shielding " Crooked Whiskey Rings," or doing things unjust 
We care not for their politics, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
We want a 
true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want no men who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And trim to thro-,7 our hornet name forever in the shade. 
We've had enough of Useless Grant, and his relationc too, 
Wc) want a man who'll keep his oa''t and the constituti-u too.

Wow a 
few days ago while on things ruminating. 
I 
thought of the present, I 
thought of the past. 
I 
thought of the strange things we're every clay meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom ; 
We have not Lafayette, who from France came to fight--
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third term, just to set matters light. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Gettysbruigh's Hero, 
But we have the brave Sherman, wno marched to the Sea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend--
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago, 
When the fire fiend upon them made such a 
in-cat raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send you to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom I 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's : Teat Hero 
He strove for his country bright laurels to NV1:1 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have gallant Little Mac, who at Antietam fighting, 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also; 
Ben Butler's still with us, one eye on the spoons—.

BOY LOST. 
Missing from Philadelphia about the 3rd of next month, 1780, 
a 
tall complexioned young man, about five feet six inches 
of age; height, thirty-seven years ; had on when last seen a 
pair of swallow-tailed sealskin trowsers, with sausage stripes; 
fashionable mutton- chop waistcoat, with cast iron trimming; 
double barreled frock coat, with tripe collar and tobacco lining; 
watertight canvas boots, with patent leather tops, laced up at 
the sole; is deaf and dumb of one eye, and hard of hearing with 
the other; 
is slightly pockmarked at the back of his head; 
stoops upright when he walks crooked: a 
slight impediment in 
his look, and wears a 
Grecian bend on his upper lip; 
whiskers 
cut off short inside; was carrying an empty carpet box in each 
hand, and a 
wooden bag in the other, containing screw steam-
ers, railway tunnels and blacking. 
Was born before his young-
er brother, his mother being present on the occasion. 
Any one giving such information as will leave him where ho 
is, will be prosecuted as the law directs.

Frice 40 cents 
LITTLE darling, do you miss me, 
Wand'ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me, 
As you did in days before? 
Is your gentle heart repining 
For the joys that once were thine, 
With my arms around you twining 
And your little hand in mine. 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
As you dream of days before, 
Do you linger still to kiss me, 
By the little cottage door? 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
Roaming by the streamlet tide? 
Where I 
whispered as I 
kissed thee. 
You were more than all beside? 
Does sweet memory returning, 
Bring again those happy days, 
With the never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ? 
- Little darling, etc 
Little darling, do you miss me. 
Do you long to hear my voice, 
Breathhe , words so sweet and tender, 
That would make your heart rejoice? 
By and by I

As I 
did so long before, 
Are you waiting still to meet me. 
As you've done in days of yore?

IRISH ROSY. 
Words and Music by CHAS. R. 
DACHSTADEL 
Sung by ROBERT Maw. 
There's a 
little Irish lady 
has won from me my heart, 
She's as fair as fair can be, 
An' she's lately came from Ireland, 
Across from the ould dart, 
She's promised she'd wed me, 
Her eyes are blue as heaven's hue, 
She's got the sweetest name, 
0, I 
call her little Rosy, 
Ould Erin's pretty posy, 
She's handsome but not vain. 
CHORUS. 
She's so fair none compare, 
With my little Rosy, 
No, there's not another one 
Half so fair to me, 
Pretty pearl, my fresh girl, 
Love and truth combined, 
Won't it be a 
happy day 
When I 
call her mine. 
If you saw this little daisy, 
She'd surely set you crazy, 
You'd say none were so fair 
With her blush of maiden sweetness, 
She's elegance an' neatness, 
A 
jewel rich and rare, 
When all is done and we are one, 
With joy my heart will beat, 
An' a 
home I'll have so cosey, 
With little Irish Rosey, 
The sweetest of the sweet.

Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
it's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hat, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swelL 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And It empties your pocket-book as well.

I 
me, 
And 
tell you E-
 3tory strange, 
Of a 
wicked you:. L, 
:al and her front name was Sall, 
And she's driven me crazy deranged. 
We first met in the street, 
She trampled on my feet, 
She apologized genteely, 
And I 
thought that she was sweet, 
But qhortly I 
discovered she was full of vile deceit, 
CHORUS. 
She has gone to fight the Indians, 
She went West with Texas Jack, 
I 
bought her a 
Thomas J. H. hawk, 
And I 
hope she won't come back, 
She raised the riot and the R. II. strike, 
And the Russian war did start, 
She's head one of the Excise law, 
Farewell, good-bye, sweetheart. 
She sang a 
l!ttle song 
As her arm I 
took in mine, 
'Twas silver threads among the gold, 
I 
thought her voice was fine. 
I've changed my mind since then, 
I 
think it was very coarse, 
Like the captain of the canal scow, 
It was husky, base and coarse, 
And every time I 
think of it, 
It sounds nine times worse. 
WICKED YOUNG SALL. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
She's gorre to be an angel, 
Pushing clouds up in the skies, 
If she gets up to that happy land 
I 
never want to die. 
If she arrives on that bright shore, 
There'll be a 
commotion sure, 
She'll raise a 
fuss and a 
terrible muss 
On that Hallelujah shore. 
She took me to her home 
And her mother fired me out, 
With a 
club she fumbled away in my hair, 
And loudly for help did shout, 
She bruised me up most fearfully, 
Nine fat policemen came, 
They dragged me to the station house, 
And nine months I 
did remain, 
They beat and bruised my character, 
And tarnished my good name. 
Cuonus. 
She swore that I 
was Gen. Grant, 
From Europe in disguise, 
A General from the Russian ranks, 
Or one of the Turkish spies, 
She swore I 
was loaded with dynamite or nitro. 
glycerine, 
She starts away next Thursday night 
To fight the English Queen. 
FACTORY BOY. 
Written for JOHNNY W ILLIAMS by ED. II.A.RRIGAX 
From dear old Albion's shore, 
It's latel .: 
I've come o'er, 
To try to gain my fortune and a 
name; 
From old Manchester town, 
Where I've rattled up and down, 
And put the other factory boys to shame. 
With a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
'Which hard knocks never bruise, 
After working hard all day I've danced away with joy 
And the neighbors out to ride, 
Would stop at the old roadside, 
Admiring the nimble touches of this jolly factory boy. 
When I 
get through my meal, 
I'd use my toe and heel, 
just only to settle my dinner down, 
Then away to work I'd wing 
When I'd hear the mill bell ring, 
No livelier lad for 1
-Willy miles around. 
One day I 
took " French leave" 
And I

'GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG, 
-Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. E. 
DE 
SHEPPARD, 
'with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK Lzwin, alk 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry frog did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
Be tried his best to win the ght, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rase in their might, and saved our dete 
old flag. 
Again when .t 
hot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick afi) 
fast, 
.A gallant youth he braved them all as ho clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away-, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat. 
The boy descended to the deck. of Parragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hem; 
A noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty poiger. 
He stood upon the battle plain as thousands did him  
fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
.And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wast:efurrd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burn4,4clime, 
Yrom far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cr.,41,_Qod bless that dear old tagl 
AT HOME IN ALABAM. 
Original Song and Dance, by JouNsoN AND BRUM 
Oh I 
white folks all good evening, 
We've come to sing to you 
About our home in Atabarri, 
Our Massa and Alissus too. 
We use to work down in de field, 
Dey call us Pete and Sam; 
At evenings bow we'd sing and dant* 
At home in Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
The good old times have passed, but atilt 
We're happy as two clams; 
We'll sing and do a 
step we done, 
At home in Alabam. 
Old massa he was kind to us, 
But soon he passed away; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things wore once so gay. 
The aarkies they have all gone North, 
And scarcely left a 
man 
To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam. 
The good old times, && 
Oh ! .white folks all, we'll say good-bye, 
We're much obliged to you 
For listening to our little song, 
We tried to please you too. 
We're free and honest niggers now, 
We love old Uncle Sam, 
And the Lord up hip will give us en 
A home in Alabam. 
Thv ;pod old amen. &C. , 
Grandmother Pratt's Wonderful Cat. 
Written by Billy Carter, and sang by him with great success. 
Old Grandmother Pratt owned a 
fine Thomas cat, 
A beautiful sky-blue Maltese, 
And this wonderft 1 
cat often went on a 
bat, 
A. tearing, high old jamboree. 
I'm going to show that this cat wasn't slow— 
He was ringboned in one of his eyes— 
One day he did go down to Stetson's cat show, 
And he drew out a 
golden first prize. 
This wonderful cat he was hairy and fat, 
One ear was chewed off in a 
row, 
And his nose was as flat as the crown of my hat, 
It hapyened I 
can't tell you how. 
He was heavy and strong, but his tail wasn't long, 
It was ate off all but a 
short stump, 
And I 
hope it ain't wrong for to tell in my song, 
On his back was a 
three-
cornered hump. 
He could sing like a 
lark, every night after dark 
lie would get onto my back-yard fence. 
My watch-dog would bark like a 
man eating shark, 
When this cat his sweet song would commence. 
In a 
moment the ground would be covered all round 
With cats from the neighboring streets, 
Not a 
cat could be found that dared utter a 
sound, 
But they'd quietly sit in their seats. 
About midnight one night he got into a 
fight— 
He was fond of disturbing the peace— 
Through the dimness of sight of the eye on his right 
He fell into a 
pan of soap-grease. 
He squeled like the deuce, hut it wasn't no use, 
He couldn't get out of the pan, 
The grease held him fast, he died game to the last, 
As only a 
Thomas cat can.

The Cards are arranged in

swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under.

Courting' Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged

v 
ung ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dini, 
too fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking the momentona 
n. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from oing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
fedions existence', which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
haminess of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover ever 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not bt 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation tin. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards Ali not restricted to two players, 
but may be onjoyed'by evening parties.
