CORPORAL JIM AND I. 
Written by A. P. CHASE for JOHN QUEEN and W ILLIAM WESt 
and performed by them over three hundred nights in 
New York City alone. 
Music copyright by W M. POND, 547 Broadway. 
JUST look at us and you may know our likes before has ne'er 
been seen; 
We both belong to Company Q, and dress as gay as a 
horse 
marine, 
'Tis our delight, both day and night, at the tap of the drum to 
be ready to fight, 
And willing for our country to die, is nobby Corporal Jim 
and I. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, ain't we happy, just as happy as we can bet 
For we're going in to town the pretty girls to see. 
HALT I [
Business of burlesque drill.] 
Then come and be a 
horse marine, a 
gayer life has ne'er been 
seen; 
Get up courage, come and try to be like Corporal Jim and I. 
To•Jav we lei the camping-ground to march to town the sights 
to see, 
With martial air and looks so fine the ladies' pets we like to 
be. 
should see us when to town we go, the ladies at us sweet 
flowers do throw; 
They kiss their hand and vainly try to win both Corporal Jim 
and I. 
Oh, my, ain't we happy, etc.

THE NERVOUS CURES. 
As done by QUEEN and W EST in FELIX FERRY'S laughable sketch, 
"Who Would Get It," at the Theater Comique, 
New York City. 
W E 
came from "Old Lost ..Cation" the other afternom 
With money in our pockets and voices in good tune; 
And if you will attention pay and treat us as we deserve, 
You'll laugh and shout as you go out and say we've got the 
nerve. 
CHORUS. 
For we are two nervous cures—two curious nerves are we, 
The boys they shout as we go out the nervous cures to see. 
[Repeat.] 
When we walk out on Broadway we always look so neat, 
Dressed in the height of fashion from head down to our fiwt; 
Two ladies fair wo often see, and them we'd like to serve; 
We'd ask them both to marry us, but we haven't got the nerve. 
For we are two nervous cures, etc. 
Yes, we really would get married, but we are so very shy; 
Long single have we tarried, but we mean to have a 
try. 
If there's any two ladies present our curious nerves to serve, 
Oh ladies, don't forsake us now, but strengthen our poor 
nerves. 
For we are two nervous cures, etc. 
PERPETUAL MOTION. 
As originally done by QUEEN and W EST, at the San Francisco 
Minstrels, New York City. 
ALL around this blessed town we run for information, 
Trying to discover if there's any new sensation. 
Polities and accidents, and scandalizing too, 
These are all the same to its as long as they are new. 
CHORUS. 
Here and there and everywhere, we'll very quickly prove, 
Do what we will we are never still, but always on the move. 
Here and there and everywhere, you'll see at a 
glance, 
Do what we will we're never still, but always on the dance. 
Mr. Beecher asked us if we would be his mate, 
He would preach, and we would have to pass around the plate ; 
To sing a 
comic song or two, to please the congregation--
Anything is fair, said he, to raise a 
good sensation. 
Here and there, etc. 
A 
lessee of a 
theater, in manner most emphatic, 
Told us that we must not dance, because it was dramatic. 
Such petty jealousy, of course, arises from vexation, 
'Cause variety shows are all the go they feel a 
queer sensation. 
Here and there, etc. 
Now we must be going, but on sonic other day 
About the great sensation we'll have some more to say. 
So let us hope that we have gained your smiles and approb'ttion, 
For we have done our best to raise a 
laughable sensatio) 
_Here and there, etc. 
5 
CONUNDRUMS. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB expressly for BILLY W EST. 
I've often asked some funny things 
To please you for awhile 
And many a 
time as my reward 
Received a 
pleasant smile. 
I'm going to sing a 
song to- night, 
I 
hope to please you well. 
A few conundrums I 
will ask, 
And then the answer tell. 
The first one that I'm going to ask, 
By way of table-talk. 
It's why is kissing a 
pretty girl— 
Like taking soup with a 
fork. 
Of course the answer I 
can give 
For I 
am up to snuff, 
Like eating soup with a 
fo-rk it is 
'Cause its hard to get enough. 
The next one that I'm going to ask, 
And what it is about, 
Is what does a 
little ragged boy do 
When he wears his pants out. 
Why, if he wears them out, of course, 
The answer it is plain, 
He does not worry himself at all 
But wears them home again. 
Now here's one on the ladies, 
And it just a 
passing hit. 
Why is a 
soldier like a 
girl ? 
The answer what is it. 
The difference ' twixt a 
soldier 
And a 
girl so strange occurs. 
The soldier faces powder 
But the girl she powders her's. 
Written by NED STRAIGHT for QUEEN and W EST, and done by 
them in their original sketch, Old and Young, at the 
Olympic Theater, New York City. 
OLD MAN.— 
Good evening, folks; I'm happy to see you look-
ing so very gay; 
I've brought the old woman along with me a 
little while to stay. 
Although we're old and pretty well worn, we're 
always free from care, 
And all the people around the town in wonder Jo 
at us stare. 
CHORUS. 
OLD MAN.— 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hat 
OLD W OMAN.—He, he, he. he, he, hel 
BOTH.--
(Sym.) 
(SY711 .) 
Although we are getting very old, and haven't 
much time to spare, 
We'll laugh and sing and dance till we the, 
For we are the happy old pair. 
OLD W OMAN.—It 
pleases me much to see the old man put on 
such a 
smiling face, 
For when he was young, I'll tell you the truth, 
he was a 
very tough case. 
He smoked his cigai, he drove his fast team, and 
used to go out on a 
tare, 
And all the people around thc towr in wonder' 
did at him stare. 
Ha, ha, lic, lac, etc. 
Written by F. D. GOODING for JOHNNY QUEEN, and done by him 
in SAM NORMAN'S sketch, "Are You Working?" 
No doubt you've all heard about apples and pears, 
:‘.Iy father sold charcoal and things: 
But while I 
am here you can banish dull care, 
And mlnd the poor widdy that sings. 
Once happy as any, and the times they were many, 
When all the boys came to court me: 
But sorry a 
one now has a 
nod or a 
bow 
For poor old Malony's widdy. 
CHORUS. 
Yet I'll sing and dance for ye; 
I'll do, to please ye, whate'er ye bid me. 
Now I've a 
chance, ye see, 
Has any a 
job for Malony's widdy ? 
Sure, I 
married a 
builder a 
few years ago, 
And a 
very fine man, sure, he was; 
But for all that he died, I 
would have you to know, 
If you list I 
will tell you the cause. 
One day he did think that he'd just take a 
drink, 
To nerve himself up, don't you see; 
To think makes me sadder, for he fell down the ladder 
And left poor Malony's widdy. 
Yet T'll sing and dance, etc. 
Now I'm looking around me to marry once more, 
I 
can wash, I 
can iron or scrub; 
Is there any one can this poor widdy adore ? 
I'll give yez no end of good grub. 
If I 
can't, get a 
match, sure the first man I 
catch 
I 
will ask him right out to wed me! 
But by the old sod he shan't carry a 
hod 
And lave me another widdy. 
[Sym. 
[Spud 
If ye want to write to me 
[Sym.] 
I'll tell ye my first name, and that is Biddy ; 
Now take the last sight of me, 
[Syn.] 
And say a 
kind word for Malony's widdy. 
OLD TIME'S ROM, 
Banjo Solo sung by BILLY W EST 
THE way we travel now-a-days 
Surprises us with its different ways. 
In Chicago they go it by pitch and tos 
You can jump off for ten minutes 
And get 
divorce. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's Old Time's Rocks is number one, 
Oh, how is that for high' 
The Telegraph workers are on a 
strike, 
The way things are working they don't seem to like. 
The last message they sent I 
think was a 
stunner, 
To fight it out on one wire, 
If it took all summer. 
Then it's, etc. 
Oh, Fisk, the Erie Prince, is pie, 
He's always exclaiming, " How's that for high I" 
I 
hear from Alaska he's buying up bears, 
But in Jersey they've snatched him 
For raising the fares. 
Then it's, etc. 
The Mormons they have had a 
flare, 
Each other's opinions to pieces they tear. 
Brigham Young still coos like an old turtle dove, 
Says he's coming on North 
To go in for free love. 
Then it's, etc.

TOM MAGIIFFIN • 
Written by G. W. H. GRIFFIN for JOHNNY QUEEN. 
You look wid wonder now, I 
see, 
Upon a 
man like me; 
Because I 
am su-pa-ri-or 
To what you daily see. 
My classic face and Frinch " contour " 
Will make you gaze and stare, 
Because I'm a 
man of " ja-ne-us," 
And talents rich and rare. 
CHORUS. 
I'm called Tom Maguffin, 
I'm called it because it's me name; 
And I'll bate out the stuffin' 
Of the man who denies me the same. 
[Repeat. 
I 
landed here a 
month ago 
At the " Hotel de Garden Castle," 
A burly " Mick" came up to me 
And collared me for a 
wrastle. 
I 
gave him a " slug" bang under the " lug," 
And he snuffed the mud wid his pate; 
They took him off in a " covered wagon," 
Wid the boys pelting stones at his fate ( feet.) 
I'm called Tom Maguffin, etc. 
I'm studying for an alderman 
At old Tim Doyle's saloon; 
They said I 
must learn to read and write, 
And eat corned beef wid a 
spoon.

Come over here to rule, 
Who knew any more than I

And I

like this country. . I'd rather live here than in 
Ireland, because there's more room—they don't sleep so many 
in a 
bed as they do at home. 
But there's one thing I 
can't say 
I 
like, and that's the law and justice in America. 
You can get 
all the law you want from Ed. Price and Judge Howe, but 
where you going to get any justice? unless you can shake up

thousand dollars for securities and pay for the oysters be-

Whist! I 
brought my daughter Mary over wid me to 
see if I 
could get her married to some cashier of a 
bank on pa-
role. 
Well, when we were leaving the ship in a 
small boat for 
the " Hotel de Castle," she got into a 
dispute wid another 
" 
heifer" from Tipperary; and the first thing I 
knew poor Mary 
got a 
welt over the head wid an Irish umbrella, that knocked 
her clean over into the salt water. 
Well, I 
had the woman 
arrested and brought before the judge, and after I 
made the 
charge he told the woman to go away about her busines 
"What!" says I, " don't she go to .prison for lamming my 
daughter on the sconch?" " No, sir," says the judge, " I 
can't 
imprison a 
woman for giving Mary a 
little lamb'"

A
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing you the truth of a 
gallant youth, 
And his name it was Johnny Glass, 
He was a 
Glazier by trade, and the stamps he made, 
As through the back streets he'd pass. 
, He commenced in life Aith his putty and knife 
And a 
box full of glass to begin: 
H e was as fat as a 
cub, and fond of his grub, 
As he hallooed out glass put in. 
He would rise like a 
lark, from daylight to dark 
He'd trudge around through the wind and rain ; 
By the light of the lamp he would count out his stamps 
Next morning he would be off again. 
It was joy to his soul, a 
pane with a 
hole. 
Or a 
window patched up with tin; 
He would turn up his eyes, and yelp like a 
purp, 
Do you want any glass put in. 
But a 
sad mishap befell this chap, 
And the fault was not all his own; 
He was shot through the heart with a 
sly cupid's dart, 
By a 
little Dutch gal half grown. 
With her huge left paw, she'd smack him in the jaw, 
When she would get too full of gin; 
As he'd roll in the dirt, says she where are you hurt, 
But his answer was glass put in. 
He made her his frau, but I 
cant tell you how 
They passed their honey moon ; 
But the kraut was hot, a 
smoking in the pan, 
Every day as he'd toddle home at noon. 
As years rolled by. four babies would cry, 
Three boys and a 
girl, what a 
sin; 
lIe christened the lass put in glass. 
And the boys he called glass put in. 
Banjo Solo by BILLY WEST. 
sing of a 
darkie that lived in this city, 
He was a 
melodious and sweet-scented coon; 
His hatr it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
He was chief engineer cf a 
barber saloOn. 
To see him each mornirg a 
handling the razor, 
The people would gather in crowds round the door, 
And all would exclaim as he slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet- scented barber they ne'er saw before. 
There was a 
young maiden, her name was O'Brien, 
Provost Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by; 
She wo.uld pass by the shop on her way to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd throw a 
sheep's eye. 
The barber would wait till he saw her returning, 
And quietly then to the door he would come; 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip into her basket, 
And then drink her health in a 
pint of Bay Rum. 
But a 
young butcher boy by the name cf Hans Schneider, 
He heard of the barber and jealous he grew; 
He loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
And straight for the sweet- scented barber he flew. 
Then the battle commeuced and the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent on each other did rush; 
But the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
He blew out his brains with a 
lathering brush. 
When Matilda O'Brien she heard of the slaughter, 
She made up her mind to commit suicide; 
She swallowed three gallons of brandy and, water, 
And then she went down in the cellar and, died. 
Then the barber went crazy and busted his business, 
At policy played and his money let fly; 
He melted and melted clear down to a 
shadow, 
Then poisoned himself with a 
box of hair dye.

POOLE, expressly for BILLY W EST. 
Oh I 
am an unhappy moke, 
A more wretched one never was seen, 
I'll tell you the cause, 
And you'll say what a 
victim I've been. 
For I 
loved a 
fair maid, 
As black as the ace of spades; 
She was chief engineer of a 
kitchen near here, 
And boss of the scullery maids. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, what a 
shame, another galoot came about, 
He was a 
black millionare, and quickly he cut me out, 
My eye what a 
shame, if I 
only could catch that galoot, 
I'd send him a 
challenge ts meet me to night, 
And I'd bat him right in the snoot, 
Her name you must know 
Was Georgia Juliet Fan; 
His name I've been told 
Was Alonzo Othello M'Cann, 
He was a 
native of Greece, 
A man in the soap fat line 
And only she fell in love with his can, 
That kitchen maid might have been mine. 
Oh my, &c. 
One night to the kitchen I 
went, 
And then what a 
sight did I 
see; 
The soap fat man was there with his can, 
And she sitting right on his knee 
In a 
rage I 
rushed at them both.; 
Him to the ground I 
did fling; 
And there in the kitchen I 
knocked out his or;.ins.) 
With a 
stone from my Diamond ring 
Oh my, Stc.1 
She for a 
policeman did can, 
And quickly they rushed to the stoop; 
They found the girl was smothered right there 
With her head in a 
pot of clam soup 
They dragged me off to the court. 
And there not a 
word could I 
speak, 
They tried me for stealing the soap fat can, 
And hung me in less than a 
week. 
Cnonrs. 
Oh my, wha.,a sname, another galoot came about, 
Be was a 
black millionaire and quickly he cut me out; 
--4i 
My eye, what a 
shame, that yaller gal might have been mine, 
And we'd all be alive if it wasn't for him, 
That man in the soap fat line.

Add Ryman's Celebrated 4th of July Oration. 
4. 
It is useless and more than foolish to enter into prefatory 
remarks explanatory of the origin, growth and pedigree of the 
Fourth of July. 
That it was born of poor and honest parents, 
is a 
fact known to us all. 
That it's birth gave us freedom there 
can be no doubt. 
That that freedom inspired us with enter-
prise and industry make no blooming error 
That industry 
and enterprise has made us the greatest nation the sun ever shone 
on, you can bet your bottom dollar. 
And in how short a 
time? 
How rapid have been the strides of improvement. 
Rivers that 
but yesterday rolled from the icy north to the tropical south, 
whose surfaces were only disturbed by the Indian's canoe, to-
day are full of flat-boats and stern-wheef-steamers. 
In the lan-
guage 07 the Poet— 
Behind the redman's bark canoe, 
The steamboat puffs and raves, 
Aad city lots are advertised for sale, 
Above old Indians' graves. 
Hey! 
Where was this city two hundred years ago ? 
Where was it ? 
Was it where she now stands ? No, my hearers, it was not. But 
on this spot the war-whoop of the radian chief might have been 
heard to echo and reecho from Woodbine Cottage to the Jersey 
Ferry. 
But where is the War-whoop now ? 
It has passed into 
the dim distance, and to-day as you walk down Broadway 
instead of being greeted with the war-whoop of the Indian 
chief, all you hear is: 
How i the old thing working? 
But 
we know how it is ourselves. 
We. know that as a 
people 
we are huge. 
We have everything to be proud of. 
We have 
•,, 
a 
President that can smoke more cigars, make longer excur-
sions and shorter speeches, catch more trout and allow the 
American Flag tp ask more apologies than any other ruler on 
the face of the earth. 
We have men in our Halls of Congress 
who would sacrifice their lives rather than rob the government of 
17 
anything 
They couldn't get away with, and if we keep on 
progressing as we have been in the last few years, there will be 
nothing left of the Old Constitution but the Freedmen's Bureau, 
Woman's Suffrage and the 15th Amendment. 
Ain't we huge? 
I 
tell you we're business. We're the most peaceful when abused 
and the most warlike when let alone of any people on the earth. 
We had a 
standing challenge in the Clipper for years and years. 
No nation took it up, so we took it up ourselves. 
We had a 
fight in our own family just to show outsiders how we could 
make the fur fly. 
But the cruel was is over and how our hearts 
beat with joy, our bosoms heaved with emotion to see our 
brothers and friends after their long, tedious marches and hard 
fought battles, returning home 
from 
Canada. 
Yes, my friends, the war is over and the Star Spangled Banner 
still floats triumphant. 
We still celebrate the Anniversary of 
the Declaration of Independence. 
And the bald-headed eagle 
has perched himself on the snow-capped summits of the Mocky 
Rountains, flapping his wings, spreading his tail feathers, bid-
ding defiance to the world and spiling for a 
muss. 
But he'll 
never spile, he's not long to wait. 
We are on the eve of a 
great war, which if not stopped will cause rivers of blood to 
flow. 
I 
fancy I 
hear you asking yourselves, what will cause. 
this war? I 
will tell you. 
During the last three years there 
has been more emigration to this country than there has been 
during the last three years. 
Scarcely a 
ship arrives but that 
brings from twenty-five to one hundred Italian organ- grinders, 
sent to this country by Italy to make harmony between the two 
great nations, but how are they treated, how are Italians treat-
ed in this country ? Calumniously. Have we commissioners ap• 
pointed to show them around, to take them by the hand and 
guard them against the pitfalls and allurements that beset their 
path to lead them astray ? 
No, in Italic, No. 
Why it was only 
two days, three weeks and four months ago that an Italian 
friend of mine, an organ-grinder by profession, landed in this 
your beautiful city of New York. How was he received ? Who 
was there to take him by the hand and show him round among 
18 
c 
gang? Noboby, not even " Nobody's Daughter ' 
What 
was the consequences? 
He stood grinding his organ three 
clays and three nights, in front of a 
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. Its 
enough to bust up any business. 
And it is likely to cause war 
between this country and Italy. 
Let us prevent it, " Let us 
have peace," for, as Gen. Grant says, the country is in no con-
dition to fight and he wouldn't say so unless he was paid for 
it. 
But I'll detain you no longer, hoping you may all live for 
many years to fire your crackers and shout for the " Star Ban-
glett Smasher." The Fourth of July and the Dec—le--pru—dence 
oi In—dig—na—tion. I 
bid you a-jew, a—streetjew. 
AMONG THE SUGAR CANE. 
Way down in old Carolina, 
In good old Dixie's land, 
All among the sugar cane, 
A 
good old darky band. 
There we'd join together, 
Old Massa he would bring 
Kind Missis and de little ones 
To hear de darkies sing. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never !shall forget old Auntie Dinah, 
The sport we had in old Carolina. 
You may talk about your jubilee, I 
wish they'd come again. 
We'd roll around upon de ground among the sugar cane. 
When the sun was boiling hot, 
Like gravy in de pan, 
Oh, I 
could tote de sugar cane 
Like any other man. 
But when de work was over, 
To my Julia I 
would skip, 
She'd put ber arms around me 
And would kiss me on de lip. 
I 
never shall, etc.

CROCODILE! 
Copyright secured in 1874. 
Sung by JAMES BRADLEY & JOHN W ILD, at the Theatre 
Comique, 511 Broadway, N. Y. 
Sitting on the banks of the Mississippi, 
Down where the waters flow along, 
Happy as a 
worm in a 
barrel of mud. 
Levee niggers do nothing wrong— 
Steamboat whistle heard along the shore— 
Paddle wheel make the water bile. 
Putty soon the darkey heard an awful noise, 
Coming from the slippery Crocodile! 
Coming from the slippery Crocodile! 
You ought to see the tongue of that animile, 
When he opens his mouth and rolls up his eyer, t 
He's very fond of niggers that's young and fat! 
And little yaller speckled flies. 
Marster Jonah, he lived inside the Whale; 
You can bet your money that he'd spile, 
If he sleep one blessed moment, sure, 
Inside the slippery Crocodile! 
Inside the slippery Crocodile I 
Sung by JOHNNY W M', 
WHITE folks, your attention 
I 
ask- awhile of you; 
feel sb loose and careless, 
That I 
don't know what to do; 
I 
felt so good this morning, 
Down the stairs I 
slid; 
When they asked me what the matter was, 
Why dis is what I 
did. 
When I 
first come to this city, 
The folks they dressed so neat, 
All in the height of fashion, 
From their head down to their feet; 
I 
went into an auction store, 
And for dose shoes did bid, 
When dey tole me to lay down de cash, 
Why dis am what I 
did. 
I 
went den to get married 
To my Sue so slim and tall; 
My massa's clothes just htted me 
Like paper on the wall; 
When the preacher man he says to me, 
Which gal are you going to wed, 
And in answer to the preacher man, 
Why dis am what I 
did.

We lived down South at de breakin' of de war, 
As happy as Niggers could be; 
But the white men came and tuck us from our homes. 
And they told us that we were free ; 
We 'listed, den, with the Federal troops, 
And we went for to fight de foe ; 
And when de boys had sorrow in their hearts. 
Why dis am de way we'd go, 
CHORUS. 
Things am changed on de old Plantation, now, 
We hung up de shovel and de hoe; 
But we often think of those happy days, 
And de way dat we used to go. 
When work was done, we'd gather in de barn, 
For to rattle de heel and toe; 
And dance (-fat good old Mississippi fling, 
To de tune of de old banjo. 
We'll never see dem good old times again, 
For death has laid our Massa low; 
But de tears run down our cheeks like de rain, 
When we think of the way we used to go. 
Things am changed, &c.

Ohl good evening to you, one and;a11. 
Now what we say is true; 
We came from Alabama, 
With the gum-elastic shoe. 
We'll do our best to please you all, 
With our easy style so new 
We're two slim and slippery southern nigs 
With the gum-elastic shoe. 
CHORUS. 
Now watch our style and figures; 
We are two southern niggers. 
(Sym.) 
We sing and dance to please you all 
With our easy style so new. 
We're two slim and slippery nigs 
With the gum-elastic shoe. 
We are going back to our southern homes, 
Where we were bred and born. 
We sometimes pick de cotton, 
And sometimes hoe de corn. 
We hope dat we have pleased you 
With our easy style so new; 
We're two slim and slippery southern nigs, 
With the gum-elastic shoe. 
Now watch ouy style, &c.

NOW, then, subjects for songs ucwadays are so scarce, 
And to find one I've looked far and near every say; 
And the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For its something like looking fcr needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through 
thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as its nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little elf, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works your-
self. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right its tLeir wish you can wager to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you through thick and 
through thin. 
Our country's made up of all classes, all nations, 
Ev'ry mixture, lin colors, all kinds and all creeds; 
Don't frown on a 
man in a 
poor humble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds. 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger, 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now wave. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their grave. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and tried hard to win. 
And should they be called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through

Jos, Pucx SULLIVAN, and ANDY SOAP. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea. 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted, long ago, • 
My life has been a 
scene of woe; 
But now a 
joyful hour has come, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
CHORUS. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
FrOm friends that I've not seen for years. 
No Father 's 
near to guide me now, 
No Mother's tear to sooth my brow, 
.No Sister's voice falls on mine ear, 
No Brother's smile to give me cheer; 
But though I,wander far away, 
• 
My heart is full of joy to-day, 
For friends across the Ocean's foam, 
Have sent to Me good news from home. 
Good DQI,VS from home,

When shall I

Where I've spent years of joy before!

My heart was happy there; 
Though I 
may never see it more, 
Or stand upon my native shore; 
Where'er on earth I'm doomed to roam, 
My heart will be with those at home.

Oh ! such a

Oh dear! I

For she's sweeter to me than pumpking pie,

That she is the prettiest ever seen. 
Some day or other she'll be mine,

I'm Major de Voy of the Carbineers, 
Beloved by all the charming dears; • 
How many fair creatures I've left in. 
tears, 
In love with the handsome Major. 
My wife is as jealous ae can be, 
She thinks there's no husband alive like me; 
And certainly I 
think she has cause to be 
Conceited about her Major. 
• 
CHORUS. 
. — 
For Major de Voy ti such a 
fascinating boy, 
He still the dear ladies bewitches: , 
Tho' I'm sorry to say he can't have his own 
y, 
For Mrs. De Voy wears the breeches. 
Some time ago I 
went out to dine, • • 
With my wife (of course),dress'd out so fine. 
A 
beautiful dinner and splendid wine, - • 
".! Set out for the gallant Major... 
Some elegaet ladies I 
met there, 
One in particular—extra fair; 
I 
was flirting with her, when a 
voice near my chair,. 
In a 
sepulchral tone cried " Major!" 
SFOKEN.—It was my wife 
Ifis very disagreeable when you 
are caught flirting by your wife.NI say; when you are inter-
rupted in a 
quiet flirtation by your wife it is very disagreeable. 
But my wife is so jealous, yOu kiwi/— 
For Major de Toy, etc. 
47 
• 
She engages the ugliest servant girls,' 
With high cheek bones and corkscrew curls; 
And teeth that you cannot, with truth, call pearls, 
To wait on the gallant Major. 
My partner for life'was.my oWn -choice, 
And in my better half I 
rejoice; 
She's quite eighteedstone with a 
baritone voice, 
And cleats on her handsome Major. • 
.11 
SPOKEN.—
It is very disagreeable when.a wife.i.s.,too fond. of 
her husband. I.say when a 
wife displays an extra amount of 
affection toward her husband. it is very , disagreeable. I 
cannot 
leave the room to—to—wash my hands, bit *she folrows me, 
and waits 'till I'm done. 
It's very disagreeable, but she's so 
jealous you know. 
• 
For. Major de Vey, etc. 
If I 
want to go out, I 
must ask my wife; 
To prevent a. day of storm and strife; 
It is disagreeable; 'pon my life, 
To a 
man like the gallant Major. 
One evening I 
seized on a 
good time, 
Her temper all day had been quite sublime;' 
7 
asked her to take me to some pantomime, ' 
When didn't she scold her Major. 
SPOKEN.—Quite a scene I assure you—a 
transformation 
scene. 
Very disagreeable ,to have a 
transformation scene in 
a 
drawing-room. " Major," said she, 
You ask me to take 
you to see the, pantomime; you ought to be ashamed of your-
self. 
You know' you only want to-go and .see the girls' legs" 
" 
Well, my dear," r  
said, " there, is nothing at all disagreeable 
in a

NEW SUBJECT. 
BANJO SOLO. , 
NS, 
ritten and composed by J. D. ROOMIC-
:\ 
I .oft going to sing you a 
beautiful song, 
And the subject I 
know is quite new, 
Such subjects are scarce, as you're well aware, 
. And good things less frequent than few; 
So with your kind permit I'll proceed with my dit, 
Very close you must watch for the plot 
Of the beautiful thing which I'm going to sing, 
For the right idea surely I've got. 
Most every new song has the same old ding-dong ' 
Style of subject ' bout mottoes and dames, 
But this exhibition of my composition, 
Has new and original claims; 
There's one thing I'll mention—your quiet attention 
Is needed to help me along, 
For I 
want you to hear something good that's not queer,' 
So prepare for my beautiful song. 
And now as you're quiet, I 
think I 
will try it, 
But before I 
proceed I 
must say 
Of each beautiful verse that I'm going to rehearse— 
Don't steal it or give it away ; 
Yet I 
don't feel afraid to make a 
parade 
Of my modest but eloquent ditty, 
I'm among my friends here, and I 
hope to make clear 
Something sensible, solid and and witty. 
Now just one final word before I 
am heard 
In the rhymes of my recommendation— 
You are quite well aware that we all should prepare, 
To produce well requires preparation; 
So now if you please, with the greatest of ease 
Ill proceed, for I 
know it's all right, 
Just pull down your ears and tie back your vest, 
And I'll sing it to-morrow night. 
NAUGHTY SUSAN JANE. 
As sang by TONY PASTOR, 
011, once 1 
loved a 
little girl, 
IIer name was Susan Jane, 
She set my brain all in a 
whirl, 
My bosom in a 
flame, 
For Tony Pastor, she has sold me, 
A 
fellow you have heard, 
An ugly brute who looks like me, 
Now wasn't that absurd. 
elloRUS. 
Oh Susan Jane, oh Susan Jane. 
Once you said you loved me, 
Now I 
am full of grief a 
ni pain ; 
You'll burst my heart, I 
know you will ; 
Naughty Susan Jane. 
One night I 
asked my Susan Jane 
With me for to go, 
And hear the great star emnique, 
Tony Pastor you all know, 
lie came on the stage dressed up just so, 
In his hand be had a 
cane ; 
He touched his hat just like that, ( Bus) 
Then winked at Susan Jane. 
Oh Susan Jane, etc. 
8he waited for him there that night, 
While he came oft the stage, 
And then he kissed my Susan Jane, 
Which made me boil with rage, 
He made a 
start then for to go, 
Miss Susan did the same, 
He turned and said, good night young man 
Then walked off with Susan Jane. 
The reason that I 
am here to-night 
Is to tell you of my grief, 
That's caused by that star comic, 
The great big singer chief ; 
He sings right here upon this stage, 
And he has gained great fame; 
But please don't let him sing again 
Till he gives up Susan Jane. 
Oh Susan Jane. etc.

Sung by Miss JENNIX 
ENo3L. 
OH, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Virden, 
Every day I 
promenade along the street, 
While my friends they stop and say, " I 
beg Oil/. pardon, 
Really, do you know you look so ,very sweet ?" 
tint' the gentlemen give me such admiring glances, 
Smiling sweetly as I 
swiftly pass them n 
by, 
While I 
hear them whisper, " I'm going for . 
my chances, 
For that Dolly Virden suit just takes my eye." 
CHORUS. , 
Yes, I 
wear the 'at:ea hyle, the Deily Varden, 
In the fashion I 
am always sure Jo be,. 
So I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
For it suits, I'm sure, a 
dashing girl like me. 
Oh, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly, Varden, 
To the church and opera, it don't matter where, 
For I 
know it always is the height of fashion, 
You would think so could you see the people stare, 
All the girls with jealousy are nearly dying, 
Just because I've beat them in the latest style; 
Everywhere I 
go I 
find that they are trying, 
To imitate me, how it makes me smile. 
Yes, I 
wear the latest style, &c. 
Oh, I 
wear the latest style, the Dolly Varden, 
And I 
had it on the other pleasant night, 
When I 
wandered in the shadows down the ,garden. 
'Neath the shining of the Moon, so clear'and bright. 
Some one softly whisper'd that he had 
.learned to love me, 
When he saw me wear that fascinating style; 
Some one made me promise by the stars above me, 
That I'd be his darling then and all the while. 
1 
JUST listen to a 
song I'm going to sing, 
It's about a 
little girl that 'I know, 
She's fairer than all the flowers in Spring, 
Is this pretty little girl that I 
know; 
She's all the rage, we are engaged. 
How happy I 
shall be, 
She's in her teens, and just sixteen, 
And says she'll marry me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! she's all the rage, we are engaged, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know, 
How happy I'll be when she marries me, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know. 
Tke first time I 
saw her 'twas in the Park, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know, 
I 
spoke to her just for a 
lark, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know. 
When she rolled her eye, I 
thought I'd as, 
she turned and winked at me, 
She wears one curl, does this sweet girl, 
Ind she's going to marry me. 
Oh! she's, ice. 
She's got lots of money, and so she says— 
This pretty little girl that I 
know— 
She. falls into property some line day, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know. 
Her father's fast, he deals in gas, 
He's gone for his health they say, 
He's gone for his health, left her his wealth, 
And she's going to marry me. 
Oh! she's, .tc.

PLUNK, PLUNK, PLUNK. 
Written expressly for JA3fES D. RoomE, by BEN DODGE. 
I'll sing you a 
song, it's not very long, 
Of a 
charmer whose sweet name Was Sally, 
She lived with her mother, her sister, and brother, 
In alenementionse up an alley; 
But she gave me the shake for a 
fellow named Jake, 
In a 
manner that wasn't so slow, 
And she'd listen each night, in the greatest delight, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
CHORUS. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Nip up de .dooden day, • 
That was the music which stole her away. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Plunk, plunk, plunk. 
Now, I 
hadn't a 
show, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
I 
spent all my cash in cutting a 
dash, 
To try and win my charmer's hand, 
But I 
found mighty soon, that I 
was a 
loon, 
And no show in the game did I 
stand: 
I 
played a 
fool's part, for she'd given her heart 
To the fellow who beat me, you know, 
I 
had to take water, for I 
found he had caught her, 
While he played on the old banjo. 
Plunk, plunk, etc. 
At last they were wed, and I've heard it said, 
They lead a 
most miserable life, 
They're wretched and poor, and she's sorry I'm sure 
That ever she became his wife; 
For their bread and butter' they stand in the gutter, 
'And'giving a 
sort of st show; 
The jaw-bone she tickles, and picks up the nickels, 
When he plays on tte old banjo.

THE, RIDDLE SONG._ 
Words and Music by GEO. W ARE. 
I 
SING to you a 
riddle song, although there's little doubt. 
Before I 
get half through it, you'll be sure to find it out; 
But then there is no harm in that, so to pass the time away., 
I 
will commence my song at once, so listen to my lay. 
You will find it in the meadow, but never in the grass, 
You'll find it in the woman, but never in the lass. 
, 
You'll always find it in malt but never in the beer, 
• 
It comes twice in every moment, but not once in a 
year. 
So listen to my riddle song, & c. 
'Tis found in every workman, but never in his work. 
You'll alWaYs 'find it in the ham, though it's never found in 
pork; 
4 
You'll always find it in the ram, though never in the sheep, 
Though it's always found in mutton, it's never found in beef. 
So listen, &c. 
You'll find it in the mastiff, though it's never in a 
dog, 
You'll always find it in a 
mist, but never in a 
fog; 
'Tis found in every feniale, but never in a 
girl, 
"Fis found in every nobleman, but never in an earl. 
So listen, &c. 
You'll find it in the mother, though its never in the wife. 
You'll find it in the moving, though it's never found in life; 
You'll always find it in your mouth, but never in your taste, 
'Tis the centre of a 
woman, though never near her waist. 
So listen, &c. 
It's never in husband, or in the wife, but yet, 
twice in every married man, of that I'll make a 
het• 
It's never found in water, but found in every stream, 
You'll never find it out in sleep, but always in a 
dream. 
So listen, &c. 
'Tis the first thing seen in Moses, perhaps this is something 
new, 
`Tis the last thing seen in Abraham, though it's never in a 
Jew. 
Nor is it in the Gentile, the Christian or pagan, 
It's twice found in Mahomedans, and once in every man. 
So listen, &c. 
You can't find it in the silver—you can't find it in the gold. 
You can find it with your Bank notes, these facts I 
now unfold; 
You'll never find it in the Bank, although it may seem funny, 
You'll always find it in the mint, and find it out in money, 
So listen, &c. 
'Tis twice found in the human man. and now to make you 
stare, 
I 
really can't be pitman, for you'll find it's not, in Ware; 
And yet you see the thing in me, though I 
never can in you, 
Yet in all mankind you find it, ' tis singular but true. 
So listen, &c. 
And now I'll finish up my song, for what I've sung about, 
It was the simple letter " M," if you've not found it out. 
And if I

THE QUEEN OF ALL. 
Beautiful Artistio Song and Dance—(new.) 
By BURT. 
W AYNE, and sung by W AYNE ik LOVELY, with favorite 
success, at Howard Atheneum, Boston, Mass. 
While strolling leisurely along 
One day, I chanced to spy 
The sweet subject of my song, 
She had a 
dark and rolling eye; 
• . 
She waved her handkerchief at me— 
So light and gay was her step; 
And as I 
approached this maiden fair, 
Her distance sly, she kept. 
C 
HORIIS. 
Oh! Was'nt she a 
Beauty. 
I 
tell you she would suit me. 
Isyml 
Esyml 
She's the Queen of all the pretty girls, 
With love my bosom swells! 
Search this wide world o'er and o'er, 
You'll find none that excels! 
I 
immediately approached this maiden fair, 
And offered her my arm ; 
She looked at me such a 
look, 
My very soul did charm. 
A 
fan half hid her lovely face ; 
She kept it there awhile, 
When she took it down, then I 
saw 
Her bright and beautiful smile! 
Chorus as before.

Little Book has lately appeered in print at Mr. A. J. Pumas's, 98 Nair

Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommead 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
enoourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining" how, when anti 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the lute 
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "jlirting. ,' 
The N. Y. Keening Telegram writes: " We ha-A lately seen 
nest littge 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'ewenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fisnea, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modutt operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Charlotte Tempi 
e. — To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures, 
sympathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most ebsorbing works 
ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet'a lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple; 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
?hie book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only lead 
to misery and shame."
