ThEar's a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me ; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whoever can it be ? 
It get's brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CrIORES. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea. 
Rope and fear alike perplex me 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
now many idle fancies 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
how wantonly you play— 
Ev'ry shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months—no 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc.

2 
When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry! 
SPOKEN.— He declared I was hurting his Mamma, and would 
insist upon, sitting between, us, only fancy making lore to a 
girl with a 
boy in, the way, but, she said to him in a 
voice so sweet: 
Cno.—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &c. 
3 
The mother told her loving son 
To watch the passing train, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young Elf? 
SPOKEN.— 
Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, and 
the Widow said—" Not before the boy, Fred, not bedew e 
the boy; just 
then, we went under a 
tunnel, and she said: 
C110.— Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &e. 
4 
In a 
snug retreat at Rosherville, 
I 
went 
down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with we 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sighed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how about the child ? " 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I 
the agony piled! 
SPOKEN.—I 
said," My lovely of all lovely beings, let us fly to some 
foreign clime, where I 
will protect you and your boy." 
She answered, 
and said, " How about my 1;ttle pie shop in, Seven Dials?" " Oh 
Bloomsbury! do you keep a 
pie shop ?" 
Cno. — Tommy, make room for your Uncle, 8t-

DAISY DUNBAR.

MITCHELL.

The Music of this sung is published by G. D. R USSELL & Co., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, 3Iass. 
Price 'A cents. 
I 
mtEAm of the days that have vanished, 
The love I 
first whispered to you, 
My hopes of the past that were banished 
By one then so tender and true ; 
I 
think of the words that were spoken 
In walks through the meadows afar, 
And then of the promises broken 
By you, my sweet Daisy Dunbar. 
Oh, Daisy Dunbar, Daisy Dunbar, 
Think of our walks in the meadows afar; 
Oh, Daisy Dunbar, Daisy Dunbar, 
Dearest of all to my heart you are. 
dream of your long golden tresses, 
The blue that I 
loved in your eyes, 
I 
feel now and then the caresses, 
And see again sweet summer skies ; 
I 
think of the billing and cooing, 
The vows o'er the gate when ajar; 
Oh, that was a 
beautiful wooing 
With you, my sweet Daisy Dunbar. 
Oh, Daisy Dunbar, etc. 
Though things of the past we remember, 
Let's love again yet in the new ; 
In place of May now it's December, 
And lovers like me are so few ; 
Tho' you and I 
both have grown older, 
Your face is now sweeter by far 
Than when your head lay on my shoulder, 
My darling, sweet Daisy Dunbar. 
Oh, Daisy Dunbar, etc: 
TOMMY, MATCF1 ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
—" Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle." 
As sung by MISS JENNIE HUGHES. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
And you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A 
widower fell in love with me 
While riding in a 
train ; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me a 
great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CHORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here ; 
You know papa has got a 
cake, 
And that he'll give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
-Twas on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly ; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN.—Tie declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us ; only fancy making love to ft girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
so sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again '•  
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
in front of that young elf? 
SPOKEN,—YCS, it would never do to make love before the by, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
—not before the boy "—just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc.

OFT IN DREAMS A SWEET VOICE CALLS ME. 
Words by SAMITEL N . 
M ITCHELL. 
Music by H. P. DARKS. 
The Music of this song is published by J. L. PETERS, 843 Broadway, New 
York. Price 30 cents. 
OFT in dreams a 
sweet voice calls me, 
Calls me as in days of yore, 
And I 
hear the merry laughter 
Round the humble cottage door; 
Children ramble through the meadow, 
Robins carol in the wood, 
And my long lost darling waits me 
Where we oft together stood. 
CHORUS . 
Oft in dreams a 
sweet voice calls me, 
Calls me as in days of yore, 
And I 
hear the merry laughter 
Round the humble cottage door. 
Oft in dreams a 
sweet voice calls me, 
Calls me to her side again, 
And we walk along together 
Up and down the shady lane. 
Sunshine dances on the tree tops, 
Breezes murmur soft and low, 
And my darling gently whispers, 
" 
Oh, my love, I 
love you so." 
Oft in dreams, etc. 
Oft in dreams a 
sweet voice calls me, 
Calls me " darling fond and true," 
And I 
see her golden tresses— 
See her eyes of summer blue; 
Loving glances look upon me, 
As she lightly trips the lea, 
But ' tis only in my visions 
That my love comes back to me. 
Oft in dreams, etc.

W HERE the lilac bads and blossoms, 
By the tow'ring poplar tree, 
Eyes of loving blue are watching, 
Bonnie Katie waits for me; 
Merry birds among the branches 
Chirp together all the while, 
And the May flow'rs look refreshing 
As my Katie's winning smile. 
Where the lilac buds and blossoms 
By the tow'ring, poplar tree, 
Eyes of loving blue are watching, 
Bonnie Katie waits for me. 
'Neath the purple buds and blossoms, 
Where the scented breezes blow, 
There my pretty Kate is waiting, 
Bonnie Katie, pure as snow ; 
Merry birds among the hedges 
Answer one another's call, 
And the squirrels nimbly caper 
On the rugged, winding wall. 
Where the lilac, etc. 
Where the lilac buds and blossoms, 
Soon I'll meet thee, Katie, dear, 
For your gentle voice is falling, 
Sweetly falling on my ear; 
happy birds adown the meadow 
Call me with their merry voice, 
So I'm coming, darling, coming, 
Bonnie Katie, you're my choice. 
Where the lilac, etc.

TH.E YOUNG LADY WITH THE CURLY HEAD 
OF HAIR. 
I 
nAvsuch a 
lot of beaux, all eager to propose, 
But they're none of them approved of by mamma, 
And she keeps so strict a 
guard over me, that's very hard, 
For I'm fond of beaux, as all young ladies are! 
She will seldom let me out, for she knows they stroll about, 
In the hope that they will catch a 
glimpse of me; 
But as by the house they go, through the windows oft they 
throw 
Little notes I 
read when ma's not there to sea. 
SPOKEN.—Which generally contains something to this effect--
CHORUS. 
Are you coming out to- night.. for the moon is shining bright, 
And the little stars are peeping here and there; 
I 
am waiting here in doubt, & I ! are you coming out 
Little beauty with the curl:: head of hair. 
There is handsome Harry Lee, who is deep in love wit1-. me, • 
Whom I 
met at cousin Henrietta's ball ; 
But mamma declares him poor, says he's courted girls before, 
And she vihl never speak well of him at all. 
But he often passes by, and I'm sure I 
don't know why, 
But I 
at the open window sit and sew 
And my heart beats very fast, as he whispers going patt, 
In that voice of his so musically low. 
Are you coming out., etc. 
(1)

TITF, YOUNG LADY WITH THF. CURLY 'MEAD 
OF HAIR—Continued. 
Then there's Frank, who apes the swell, still I 
like him very 
well, 
Though I 
look upon him only as a " beau ;" 
lie will often wait about, pleading " Arn't you coming out," 
And declares it wrong of ma to treat him so. 
Then there's merry Philip Drew, he's a 
dear, but he's poor too, 
And so daring, not afraid of ma at all ; 
she's not deaf, so she must hear, when his voice rings out so 
clear, 
As beneath my window he will often call, 
Are you coming out, etc. 
If alone to walk I 
go, I 
am sure to meet a 
beau, 
Nearly crazed with joy to catch me out alone ; 
But there's one—I 
won't say who—of no consequence to you, 
Fond of me, and—well—my heart is all his own. 
Ile is handsome, good, but poor ; that's a 
fault ma won't ignore ; 
But it shall not make a 
difference with me ; 
For—you needn't tell mamma, but some day we really are 
Going to run away to church and married be. 
SPOKEN.—Then there will be no need for any to say— 
Are you coming out, etc.

'T1N-As adown the smiling meadows, 
In the joyous long ago, 
When the little chirping crickets 
Sang their songs of joy and woe, 
When the violets were blooming 
By the green and mossy lane ; 
There I 
first became acquainted 
With my darling Bessie Rane. 
CHORUS. 
Many years since then have vanished, 
Dreams recall the mossy lane, 
And the visions that are brightest 
Bring again my Bessie Rane. 
When amid the purple clover, 
We were men'y as the birds, 
And she'd whisper loving tidings 
In the sweetest kind of words. 
She would tell me of the beauty 
In the fields and pasture there, 
And the love she owed the hillside 
Where the flow'rs bloom'd so fair. 
Many years, etc. 
Oft I'd deck her hair with daisies 
And a 
honeysuckle wreath, 
While we lightly tripped the meadow, 
Tramping buttercups beneath. 
Tho' those happy days have vanished, 
Dreams recall the mossy lane ; 
And the visions that are brightest 
Bring again my Bessie Rane. 
Many years, etc.

When I 
am by your side ? 
And why within your handkerchief 
Your pretty dimples hide 7 
I 
try my best to win your heart, 
You answer " yes " and " no ;" 
Oh, darling, if I'm in the way, 
Why don't you tell me so ?

No satisfaction I 
can get, 
You answer " yes " or " no ;" 
Oh, darling, if I'm in the way, 
Why don't you tell me so 7 
Why do you turn that little head 
When I 
attempt to kiss 
And why your drooping eyelids close'? 
Oh, darling, tell me this ; 
To me you are the fairest flow'r, 
The sweetest bud r 
know, 
But if my love you can't return, - 
Why don't you tell me so 
No satisfaction, etc. 
Why is it that you cannot love 
When I 
am close to thee? 
Oh, tell me why you will insist 
To scarcely notice me 7 
My heart I'll fondly give to you, 
Tho' now ' tis bowed Ivith woe, 
And, darling, if you will accept, 
I 
wish you'd tell me so.

YOU'VE been drinking— what a 
pity 
Such a 
man should be a 
slave 
To that dreadful king of ruin ; 
Would you fill a 
drunkard's grave ? 
Can you know what you are doing, 
When you lift the fatal cup 
To your lips I Oh, think a 
moment; 
Father, husband, give, oh, give it up. 
CHORUS. 
You've been drinking; if you'll only 
Turn aside the fatal cup, 
Joy will take the place of sorrow; 
From this moment give it up. 
You've been drinking; oh what sorrow 
These few words to me impart; 
Think of friendship, think of honor; 
Think of mother's broken heart; 
Is it true that you are willing 
To be numbered with the lost ? 
Think of home; oh, think of loved ones ; 
Give, oh, give it up at any cost. 
You've been drinking, etc. 
You've been drinking; if you'd only 
See yourself as others do, 
You would listen to the pleadings 
Of the friends that pray for you. 
One by one companions leave you; 
One by one your honors fade; 
Step by step you'll earn the title, 
' 
Drunkard, drunkard, of the lowest grave." 
You've been drinking, etc. 
You've been drinking ; in all kindness, 
Listen, ere it is too late ; 
Choose between a 
man of honor, 
Or a 
drunkard's fearful fate ; 
One road leads to wealth and glory, 
And the other leads to shame ; 
Can you then refuse me, darling 7 
You will never, never drink again. 
You've been drinking, etc.

THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN IN THE LANE 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M . 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS— W rrrrE AND BLAcx. 
[Scene, a 
little log cabin. 
POMP is seated by the door. 
As 
the curtain rises the symphony of the song is played softly.] 
POMP.—How the good ole times am changed! 
Dare's no-
body left about the place to talk to old Pomp now. 
Massa 
gone, and missis too. 
Even my dog has left me. 
Well, well, 
I'm only waiting for de summons to come along for poor old 
Pomp. Many and many a 
year I've trabbled on de road, and 
Pm footsore and weary now. 
[Enter HENRY.] 
HENRY—W hy, as I 
live, it's old Pomp! Pomp, don't you 
know me? 
Pom:P.—Yes—no. Why—why, it's Massa Henry 
HEIN-Ev.—The same. I 
see your old eyes are good for some-
thing yet. 
Pomp.— Well, well, war did ye come from ? 
HENRY. — Oh, I've been traveling up and down the world 
for the last seven or eight years. 
But how is everything on 
the old plantation ? 
POMP.—All gone to ruin. 
Everybody 'cept me gone dead. 
llENRY. — Cheer up, old friend. 
Why, you used to be as 
lively as a 
cricket. 
lco song was as gay as yours on the old 
plantation. 
Where's the old banjo? 
PomP.—Hangs up on the wall; I 
haven't the heart to pick 
on de strings any more. 
HENnv.—Come, Uncle Pomp, sing us a 
song. 
Maybe 'twill 
rouse you up. 
Tell me something about the old home. 
POMP.—Well, well, Massa Henry, I 
can't sing like I 
used 
to, but I'll try. 
[The music plays " The Little Old Log Cabin." POMP is as-
sisted on his feet by HENPY. 
They come forward, and POMP 
sings. 
At the end of each chorus Pomp listens to the dance which 
is played, and after one or to efforts he throws aside his hat, 
and commences the step. 
At the conclusion of the song he is 
completely tired out, and is assisted to the door of the cabin by 
HENRY. 
The dance is' played softly until the curtain Xs.]

Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a

And my good old wife she wandered by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there,— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide. 
Now 'tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I 
hear upon the roof the falling rain ; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made my heart so glad, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Cho.—Ah, yes, I'm old and feeble now, &c. 
So 
totter to my journey's end, and try to do my best, 
Though I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door, and try to sing my song 
As I used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come along, 
To mv little old log cabin in the lave.

HUNGRY AND COLD.

L. 
PETERS, 843 Broadway, New 
'York City. 
Price 30 cents. 
I 
AM hungry and cold, I 
wander the street, 
And cannot find shelter from rain and the sleet; 
The people all pass me, the young and the old, 
No pity they offer, I'm cast from the fold ; 
I 
am hungry awl cold, I 
am ragged and bare, 
And tossed by the winds are my tresses of hair ; 
The ladies all shudder, each man turns his head, 
If I 
ask for a 
penny to buy me some bread. 
CHORUS. 
I 
ant hungry and cold, I 
wander the street, 
And cannot find shelter from rain and the sleet; 
The people all pass me, the young and the old, 
No pity they offer, Pm cast from the fold. 
I 
am hungry and cold, Pm weary and sore, 
And cannot much longer appeal at each door ; 
The people all tell me they've nothing to spare, 
And that's why I'm roaming with nothing to wear; 
I 
am hungry and cold, I 
am weary and sad, 
But none care to pity the way I 
am clad ; 
Oh, that I 
could leave them and go to that land 
Where help for the lowly is ever at hand. 
I 
am hungry, etc. 
I 
am hungry awl cold, I'm burdened with we, 
And get no assistance wherever I 
go; 
Some say they would help me if business was good, 
But such consolation will never buy food ; 
1 
ant hungry and cold, and my heart is bowed down, 
It makes me so tired to roam ' bout the town ; 
Oh, could I 
arise to that Eden above— 
That angelic city, the Palace of Love. 
I 
am hungry, etc. 
YACHTING IN THE BAY. 
Words by W M. F. 
BACOY. 
Music by LOII Duissioxs. 
Sung with immense success by JEPPE. 
THERE'S many pleasures in this life, 
But none that can compare 
With the one I'm going to sing of, 
Perhaps you have been there. 
With pretty girls, and jolly boys, 
All full of fun, I 
say, 
It's splendid on a 
moonlight night, 
A- yachting in the bay. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yachting in the bay, my boys, 
Yes, yachting in the bay ; 
There's nothing to enjoy so much 
As yachting ill the bay. 
Here's Ella, Sue, and Hattie, too, 
A- coming down the wharf; 
And Ella's friend, and Hattie's ma 
Are here to see them off. 
Now all aboard ! aye, steady there, 
Your big foot's in my way ; 
Up goes the mainsail, and we're off, 
A-yachting in the bay. 
Oh, yachting, etc. 
And now the " Belle” begins to toss, 
Likewise the " yachters," too ; 
And Sue and hat they both exclaim, 
" 
Good Lord ! what shall we do'? 
Oh, dear, I 
feel so awful sick !" 
We hear the land lubs say: 
" 
I 
wish I 
never had come down 
A-yachting in the bay." 
Oh, yachting, etc. 
23 
" 
Oh, let's go home I Oh, please go home !" 
The gitis in one voice said ; 
" 
We want our dear mammas to put 
Us in our little bed." 
We soon in calmer water got, 
And then we felt quite gay ; 
For we " spliced the mainlmce" coming back • 
From yachting in the bay. 
Oh, yachting, etc.

BECAUSE I 
am a 
countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh '1" I 
hear them shout, 
While they take long looks at me. 
SPOKEN.—I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
" 
Dem it, what does it mean '1" and echo answers, " Dem 
it, what does it, mean '?" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
asked a 
man up at the Grand Central Depot if he knew where I 
could engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he, " you're 
after furnished rooms, eh ? 
Well, sir, you're in the wrong 
neighborhood ; you don't belong here. 
Well, sir, I 
suppose 
you'll keep correct by following your nose !" 
I 
told him he 
was very impertinent. But as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
CHORUS. 
Young fellah, you're too fresh, 
Young fellah, you're too fresh; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocketbook, 
Though to prove it he defied me; 
I 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And begged his best advice; 
"My friend," said he, " you're very fresh ; 
Why, you've just come off the ice." 
(1)

YOUNG FELLAH, 
YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.—I 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
man 
of law. 
I 
told him be must certainly be mistaken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir ; you have been on the 
ice of innoc@nce; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
lie wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left bim; and as I 
came down stairs I 
heard him 
say— 
Young fellah, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Cent* Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me ; 
says she, " you must be loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, I'm quite sane; 
You know I 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SroKEN.---She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't please don't! I 
want to go home! please don't !" 
" 
Nay, home thou shalt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou wilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jingo! yes, the cause I'll know! 
Speak out! Oh, fairest creature speak 
Tell me what secret bate thou hast! 
The tale I 
bear may make me weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But I 
must know ! yes, I 
must know, 
Wherefore thou slightest me." 
I 
began to get excited, so she thou& she had better explain 
herself. 
You may judge of my astonishment when she remark-
ed—

WANDERER'S DREAM. 
Fyn been thinking of thee, mother, all this long, long summer 
day, 
For last night I 
dreamed ?met you, in our old house far away ; 
And methought you smiled upon me, as you used to do of yore, 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, but that sweet dream is-0'er ; 
My father's welcome, too, ' twas sweet; his words were soft and 
mild, 
I 
Just as they used to sound to me when I 
was but a 
child ; 
pressed his band within mine own, its clasp was warm and 
true ; 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, with father dear, and you. 
My sister's lips I 
pressed to mine, and clasped her to my heart, 
And she murmured softly in mine ear, " we never more must 
part; " 
She told me she had lonely been, and often wept for me, 
As she feared the wayward wanderer she never more might see; 
And last, my brother's welcome, his love had ne'er grown cold ; 
He pressed me to his throbbing heart, as he'd often done of 
old ; 
He told me I 
was strongly grown, since I 
crossed the stormy 
main, 
But, mother, if my form is changed, my heart is still the same. 
Then methought I 
stole away and sought the garden fair, 
Where blossomed many a 
fragrant flower, of beauty rich Q.nd 
rare, 
Then down beneath the orchard trees, where oft a 
child I 
played, 
Once more I 
sat upon the grass beneath the pear tree's shade ; 
Then, with a 
smile upon my brow, I 
sought the homestead fair, 
Lightly I 
bounded through the door; hush! ' twas the voice of 
prayer ; 
My father read the holy page, oh! how lifelike it seemed; 
And, mother, then it was I 
woke, and found I 
had but dreamed.

W HEN the little birds are sleepin 
In the forest glen and glade, 
When the tiny stars are peeping 
Down upon the quiet shade; 
Then I 
watch the vale and meado 
For a 
form of queenly grace, 
Bringing in the twilight shadow 
Such a 
sweet bewitching face. 
When the silver dew is falling 
On the clover's purple head, 
When the whippoorwill is calling 
To the loving mate it wed, 
Then I 
meet my cherished treasure 
Coming o'er the daisy lea; 
And to me it is a 
pleasure 
When Ur sparkling eyes I 
see. 
Then the brilliant moon appearing 
In the heavens far away, 
Makes our love the more endearing 
As we catch each gentle ray ; 
Buried deeply in caresses, 
Either one in loth to go, 
And those soft and golden tresses, 
Darling, oh, I 
love them so I 
And those soft and golden tresses, 
Darling, oh, I 
love them so ! 
Cl 
WOULD I 
WERE MOST ANYTHING. 
Written and sung by H ARRY STANWOOD. 
On, would I 
were a 
bird, 
I'd rather be a 
bear, 
And in a 
big menagerie, 
For folks at me to stare ; 
I'd dance on my hind feet, 
Then asleep appear to be, 
And when they'd tickle me, 
I'd growl in the key of G. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fish, 
I'd rather be a 
swallow, 
I'd fly so fast along the shore, 
I'd beat the lightning hollow ; 
And when the boys would come with guns, 
To shoot me on the wing ; 
I'd wink at them with my off eye 
And " Shoo Fly " I 
would sing. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
giant, 
I'd act upon the stage; 
In tragedy l'd play Hamlet, 
For you know it's all the rage; 
In dress like an Indian Tobacco sign, 
With moccasins number sixteen ; 
To froth at the mouth I'd chew brown soap, 
And eat up all the scenes. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
cat, 
I'd rather be a 
dog, 
A 
little two ounce black and tan, 
As frisky as a 
frog ; 
But best of all I'd rather be, 
The one to please you all ; 
And hoping I 
have done so now, 
Good-night, till again I 
call.

BEAUTIFUL thoughts linger near me, 
Sweetest of visions appear, 
Bearing their gladness to cheer me, 
Ev'ry bright day of the year. 
Velvety voices are bringing 
Tidings delightful to hear ; 
Heavenly angels are singing, 
Beautiful thoughts linger near. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful thoughts linger near me, 
Sweetest of vision's appear, 
Bearing a 
gladness to cheer me, 
Erry bright day of the year. 
Beautiful thoughts linger near me, 
Fairest of maidens I 
view 
Coming with roses to cheer me— 
Kisses so tender and true ; 
Bluest of eyes are a-peeping 
Slyly, and careless of fear, 
Blushes in cheeks are a-sleeping, 
Beautiful thoughts linger near. 
Beautiful thoughts, etc. 
Beautiful thoughts, never leave me, 
Always be ready and near, 
For you can never deceive me, 
All is so charming and dear ; 
While the days quickly are flying, 
Skies will be cloudy and clear, 
And when all others are sighing 
Beautiful thoughts linger near. 
Beautiful thoughts, etc. 
WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And hero, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tho' richer land's I've seen. 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will. 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, ecr,,, 
He's foolish, but not Vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend.; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For. there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &C. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, lie's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For. there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &C. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
13ut loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of brigia prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring het ter days to Erin, 
Where the grass grows green! 
For 1 
love my,

WILL A MONKEY CLIMB A TREE 
Written and composed by JOHN REED, and sung by Gus Wim.re 
WmLsT walking out the other night a 
girl I 
chanced to meet, 
A 
very simple looking lass, as I 
thought, in the street; 
She had a 
lovely head of hair, a 
dark and rolling eye ; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd walk with me, and this was her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Will a 
monkey climb a 
tre31 will a 
fish swim in the sea I 
Will a 
lawyer take his fee'? a 
Jew his money lose'? 
Will a 
hackman take his fare 7 
will a 
barber cut your hair 7 
If they say no, then, dear sir, you I 
will refuse. 
I 
thought her very witty, so I 
to her did say, 
" 
Will you go to a 
music hall to pass an hour away 7 
Now, miss, what do you say to this'? your answer, yes or no I 
Just tell me what you really think, and if you'd like to go." 
SPOKEN.— " 
Will I 
accompany you ?" she said ; " why "— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
I 
hired a 
hack, drove to the hall, and paid the man his fare, 
And when we got inside the hall saw the chairman in his chair. 
I 
shook him by the hand and said, " What will you have with 
me— 
Whiskey hot or brandy cold or a 
glass of soda and B.'?" 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
take a 
glass of brandy and water, did you 
say 
Oh !"— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
A 
waiter then he brought the drinks, which came to a 
dollar 
and four, 
The same time saying, " Sir, will you require any morel" 
I 
gave him a 
ten dollar piece, he looked at me so strange ; 
I 
then said to the waiter, " Will you accept the change 7" 
SPOKEN. — He first looked at the gold piece and then at me, 
and quickly putting the coin in his pocket, exclaimed— 
Will a

I

Her father, that's the old man, is very fond of me; 
We're soon to married be,

If fortune should but favor her 
With children for her knee, 
flow nice to be a

Thus happy night and day

With the little ones I'll play while round they cling, 
And thus so blithe and gay, 
We'll bask in love's sweet ray, 
When seated round the fire she can sing— Cho.

THERE'S no friendly voice to greet me 
In the home that once was dear, 
There is none to come and meet me, 
None to shed a 
gladdened tear ; 
All I 
fondly loyed and cherished 
Silently has pass'd away, 
And my brightest hopes have perished 
With the golden summer day. 
CHORUS. 
There's no friendly voice to greet me 
In the home that once was dear, 
There is none to come and meet me, 
None to shed a 
gladdened tear. 
There's no rosy lip to kiss me 
When I 
enter at the gate, 
There is none to say they miss me, 
None to ask what makes me late; 
All I 
clearly prized has vanished 
Like a 
ray of sunny litiht, 
And the happy scenes are banished 
Now foteyer from my sight. 
There's no friendly, etc. 
There's no smiling face to cheer me 
When the daily toil is o'er, 
There is none to sit and hear me, 
None to soothe the heart that's sore; 
All the vows of love are broken 
That had bound a 
happy pair, 
And the only treasured token 
Is this lock of amber hair. 
There's no friendly, etc. 
WHO STOLE THE DONKEY? 
Kind friends, just listen to my song; 
Its a 
new one I've invented; 
And when you've heard how I 
was wronged, 
I'm sure ' twill be larainted. 
One fine day, I 
took a 
stroll, 
Full of pleasure, fun, and glee, 
With a 
new white hat upon my poll, 
When some bows did shout at me; 
cubnus. 
Who stole the donkey ? who stole the donkey ? 
Who stole the donkey? those boys did say, 
WHO with a 
who, STOLE with a 
stole, 
With a 
who stole, THE with a 
who stole the 
DON with a 
don, with a 
who stole the don, 
KEY with a 
key, who stole the donkey? 
I 
turned around, feelinz in a 
rage, 
But the boys they kept on shouting: 
If they had been upon a 
stage, 
You might have thought them spouting. 
But I 
found myself in such a 
mess, 
White being out on this spree, 
With my new white hat and, evening dress, 
Those boys did shout at me; 
Who stole the donkey ? &c. 
A policeman came up at the time, 
The noise to ascertain, then, 
He tried to quell the mob, you know, 
But his efforts were in vain, then ; 
They began to smash him on the poll, 
And se ing he was in for a 
spree, 
I 
ran mtd left it to himself, 
While the boys did shout at me: 
Who stole the donkey ?

Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold; 
Now I 
knew a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old; 
About her, like some others, 
There was much pretence, 
For, at the least thing, 
she'd be sure to commence (with her) 
onorus. 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
What would mamma say ? 
What would papa say 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
Get along, Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss once a 
week 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when I 
tried for one, 
She'd he sure to object, (with her) 
Oh, my, etc. 
Her pa and her ma 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOREN.—There we were all in the dark. 
I 
was afraid to 
move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't or 
wouldn't find the matches. 
When she found I 
didn't move, she 
said— 
Oh, my, etc. 
She seemed oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure ; 
WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ?—Continued. 
So I 
asked " If she'd wed?" 
Did she think she would die? 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my, etc. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
Glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To two other parties 
Her kisses were free; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't " have me," ( with her) 
Oh, my etc.

SKELLY. 
LONG, long ago, when wild and gay, 
I 
rambled from friends awl home 
Strayed from the scenes of boyhood's play, 
'Mid strangers to live and roam ; 
Only in dreams and fancies bright 
Can I 
see my loved ones of yore; 
But now I'll go back to my old delight, 
And I'll be a 
rambler no more, 
No more, no more, no more— 
I'll be a 
rambler no more. 
Years I 
have lived in distant lands, 
And thought of the gladsome past; 
Oft 1 
have sighed to press the band 
That lingered in mine the last ; 
Sad I 
have been at night and day, 
Far away from those I 
adore; 
But homeward again I 
will go, so gay, 
And I'll be a 
rambler no more, 
No more, no more, no more— 
be a 
rambler no more.

To cheer our lonely way 
What is home without a 
babe

The best the world e'er saw ? 
But what is home, 
Ah, what is home, without a

now, ah! alas 
CHORUS. 
Oh, that man to joy is dead— 
Naught his gladness can restore— 
If he's to an orphan wed, 
And has no mother-in-law ! 
Home is sweet when full of love, 
Tho' poor that home may be.; 
Go and search the wide world o'er, 
No clearer place we see; 
When in distant lands we roam, 
'Tis cherished more and more, 
And then it is we sigh for her— 
Our own dear mother-in-law I

Without a

My early love is in the grave, 
My home once bright is so no more; 
Above her now the willows wave, 
And naught can e'er my joy restore!

All the world she was to me! 
Life it, was a 
blissful dream; 
"ris now a 
weary and troubled sea 
I 
lung to clasp her to my heart 
in yonder radiant home above ; 
There every sorrow shall depart, 
And be forgot in joy or love.

IN 
the cornfield ripe and yellow 
One delightful autumn day, 
I 
by chance became acquainted 
With the charming Silvia May; 
There among the stalks so golden, 
Not by any means forlorn, 
Arm in arm we walked together, 
Making love among the corn. 
CHORUS. 
Silvia May, Silvia May, 
That was to me a 
joyous day, 
I 
eall'd you sweetest ever born, 
While making love among the corn. 
Cheerful as the robin's carol, 
Or the linnet's morning lay, 
Was the laugh of my companion, 
Sweet, bewitching Silvia May; 
Dear, delightful, and melodious 
Was the pretty darling's voice, 
And with lips of ruby richness, 
She was then my only choice. 
Silvia May, etc. 
Though the zephyrs gently murmured 
Through the bright and yellow leaves, 
None was there to see our wooing 
'Cept the songsters on the sheaves; 
DLit they'll never tell the story, 
Little things, for they are gone, 
Followed by the angel beauty 
That I 
loved among the corn.

THE WAKE OF JAR. O'LEARY. 
AIR:—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
In Ireland, so I've heard, 
To wake the dead they have a 
way, 
They get dead drunk, and on the fmre, do lay 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
lie wint quite dead, one Sunday night, 
Which put his friends in sad affright, 
From this world he had taken flight, 
So they drank his heallh with all their mighty 
They danced and reeled about, Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made ' em feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
CI1ORVS. 
Swearing, tearing, all the night, 
Putting whiskey out of sight, 
Good cheer, did all the guests invite, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Twas in the first flare under ground, 
Where all the mirth, sure, did abound, 
And where the whiskey, quick Vnt round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. j 
There was a 
policeman off his hate, 
Among the rest, came to the fate, 
And rowled about like many a 
baste, 
I'm sure he did not drink the laste. 
Then Saul's dead march, the piper played, 
But I 
am told he ne'er got paid, 
To spake the truth I'm not afraid, 
About the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, &C. 
'Twas in the middle t,f the fun, 
I 
think just at the hour of One, 
The guests they mighty quick did run, 
From the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
O'Leary, if I 
don't mistake, 
Thought it high time, that he should wake. 
Wid fear, says be, I'll make `cm quake, 
So he gave the coffin a 
sudden shake, 
Thin ould Leary loud did cry, 
This waking me is all me eye, 
For I 
niver did intind to die, 
I 
didn't says Mr. O'Leary.

Swearing, tearing, Scc. 
For help the guests quite loud did call, 
Och, murder, thieves, each one did bawl 
Och, wasn't there a 
precious squall, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Old Leary thin did come to view, 
And at the company he flew. 
Andbate them all sure, black and blue, 
Och, 'pon my soul all this is thrue. 
Some on crutches hobbled home, 
And swore again they ne'er would roam, 
While others loud, with pains did groan, 
With the bating they got from O'Leary.

WREN the autumn leaves are falling 
From the locust near the mill, 
I'll be waiting 'neath the branches 
Just at eight, when all is still ; 
You will come, I 
know, my darling, 
With your smiling face so fair, 
For as true as star- beams glisten, 
Josie. I 
will meet you there.

Josie, darling, sweet Josie, darling 
Thou art beautiful and fair; 
Just as true as star- beams glisten, 
Josie, I 
will meet you there. 
There we often met in summer, 
When the cunning wbipporwill 
Mingled with the gentle music 
Of the little muenfring rill; 
Softly to my bosom, darling, 
I 
have held you oft of yore, 
Telling sweet and loving stories 
That you used to then adore. 
Josie, darling, etc. 
Soon the winter snows will corer 
Pleasant spots where we have met, 
So, when autumn leaves are falling, 
Darling Josie, don't forget; 
Underneath that ancient locust 
I 
will look for you, my dear, 
For this life is sweetest to me, 
Josie, love, when you are near.

Oh, the first time that I 
met her, sure I 
never can forget, 
It was up at Hohnes's, the day being cold and wet ; 
But as we rode out together, the people cheered with joy, 
To see the Widow Machree from Amerley, with 
the 
Roving Irish Boy, 
Crack, crack, Ix. 
The next day I 
call'd to see her, and vow'd we ne'ershould 
part, 
She swote upon that very day. I 
stole away her heart ; 
And it we're to he married, ' twill fill my heart with joy, 
To have the Widow Machree from Ameriey, with the

MosT ev'ry lady has a 
beau 
She thinks the best of all, 
And doats upon him night and day, 
Tho' he be short or tall ; 
She'll speak about his black mustache, 
Or else his curly hair, 
And kiss his " photo " now and then 
Because he is so fair. 
SPOKEN.—Tbat " 
photo" business may be all right, but no 
paste- board kissing for me. 
It's too much on the half- shell 
principle, and borders a 
little too far on the ridiculous. 
For 
myself, I 
prefer the genuine, original, " Down East" smack, 
that goes off like a 
pop-gun every time it falls on the real arti-
cle—a 
pair of ruby lips—that's me. 
For I 
prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack." 
Some take their follows by the hand 
While they are out to walk, 
And think themselves in Paradise 
When he begins t
,-) 
talk ; 
She'll say " ' tis p!easant since the rain,' 
He'll answer, " ' tis quite cool," 
And off they wander hand in hand, 
Like children going to school. 
SPOKEN.—Catch me and my fellow on that string and you'll 
catch eels edaeways—the weather has always been the stereo-
typed topic of conversation with the majo:ity of moon- struck

Why not talk about the stock 
market, financial fiascoes, monetary matters, bulls and bears, 
or even pet poodles. It's just as sensible, and far more interest-

Old Probabilities can attend to the 
weather question and spoony lovers should drop it. 
Then, 
when they get to the garden gate after a 
short ratable, they, of 
course, want to kiss.

I 
have some lady friends who say, 
When beaux have bade" good- night I" 
" 
Just wait a

Oh, do not leave my sight." 
Then they will take their lover's hand, 
And bold it for a 
while, 
And all the kissing that they do 
Is just a 
parting smile. 
SPOR'EN.—This may be well enough for those who like it, but 
give me something better. 
What does a 
fellow care for a 
little 
squeeze like that, and the outside door half open? Some would 
call it rather " tart," and several whom I 
know wouldn't stand 
it. The fellow that comes to see me—that is, one of them— fares 
better than that, and don't he like it, though; just before he 
steps out I 
put them to him right smart, and the beauty of it is 
he tetaliates.

.A.m —" Gens d'Armes Duet." 
Two policemen on the beat are we, 
Dressed in nice warm winter clothes, 
And we're strictly temperate, you see, 
You can tell it by our nose. 
We watch little boys upon the street, 
And when they to fight begin, 
We take ' ern in, (
Repeat twke.) 
For they are not strong, you know, 
We take ' em in, (Repeat twice.) 
But the big rascals we let go. 
Woodhull and Claflin good folks condemn, 
For they've blood upon the brain; 
But, George Francis Train, he coinforts then 
And keeps them on good champagne. 
Now if they get out and come to us, 
And wash them of their sin, 
We'll take ern in, (Repeat twice.) 
And show them something funny; 
We'll take 'em in, (Repeat twice.) 
And we don't want any blood- money. 
We are much obliged for your applause, 
And we're glad you like our song ; 
But our voices are about used up because 
Our throats are not very strong. 
Some other night when you come this way, 
With your pockets full of tin, 
We'll take you in ; (Repeat Twice.) 
So you should let us off, we think. 
We must away, 
We cannot stay, 
We must obey, 
Our orders say 
That we must eo and take a 
drink.

WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS. 
WE 
have been friends together, 
It cannot all be o'er; 
The flowers of love that decked our path, 
Oh I 
shall they bloom no more 7 
'Tis sad to live ' mid ruined hopes 
That. weigh upon the heart ; 
We have been friends together, 
Oh! why should we now part ? 
Oh! why should we now part? 
We have been friends together, 
When seated side by side, 
In the dear home of our childhood, 
Our parents' joy and pride. 
When hearts, that once beat warm and true, 
Were bowed with grief and pain, 
We have been friends together, • 
Can we not be again 1 
Can we not be again 
We have been friends together, 
In summer's softest hours, 
In winter's dark and dreary gloom, 
In spring- time ' mid the flowers ; 
When autumn leaves were round thee cast, , 
And sadness gloomed thy brow, 
We have been friends together, 
Oh ! what should part us now? 
Oh I 
what should part us now 7 
COME, REST IN THIS BOSOM. 
Comh., rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer; 
Thoucn tre, herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here ; 
Here sa :s 
the smile that no cloud can o'ercast, 
And a 
heart and a 
hand all thy own to the last. 
Oh ! what was love made for, if ' tis not the same 
Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame ? 
I 
know not, I 
ask not, if guilt's in that heart— 
I 
but know that I 
love thee, whatever thou art ! 
Thou hast called me thy angel in moments of bliss, 
And thy angel I'll be ' mid the horrors of this; 
Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue, 
And shield thee, and save thee, or perish there too.

THE UNLUCKY MOKE 
Banjo Solo. 
Am.—" Rose of Texas." 
I 
WAS once a 
gallus nigger, 
And used to cut a 
dash, 
But now-a- days am glad to get 
Some boarding-house hash. 
Once I'd plenty money, 
Now I 
am dead broke; 
And everything that 1 
have had, 
Has gone up to soak. 
My watch, clothes and everything 
Is laid up on the shelf; 
But what's the use of talking, 
You know how it is yourself. 
So now I'm going to leave you, 
To get a 
glass of beer, 
And if the man asks me for stamps,' 
Why, I'll slide off on my ear. 
CURLY-HEADED JOE. 
Am.—" Dry Dock Sal." 
Banjo Soto. 
On, there was a 
young chap not very long ago, 
In this city of high renown; 
The first two letters of his name was curly-headed Joe, 
And he sold hot chestnuts brown, brown, brown, 
And he sold hot chestnuts brown. 
ILA had a 
peanut roaster also on his stand, 
of which lie was chief engineer 
And there he would sit all day and warm his hands, 
In the freezing, sneezing time of the year, year, year, 
In the freezing, sneezing time of the year. 
Now he loved a 
gal named swivel-eyed Sal, 
But she loved another feller better; 
So this chestnut man resolved on su-i-cide, 
When he discovered that he never could get her, get her, get 
her, 
When lie discovered that he never could get her. 
So he put a 
pound of powder on his roasting machine, 
And seated himself on the top, 
And since that time he never has been seen ; 
So I 
wonder if be ever will drop, drop, drop, 
Su 1 
wonder if he ever will drop. 
THE USED-UP MAN. 
On! I 
ain't got no home, 
Nor nothing else, I ' spose; 
Misfortune seems to follow me 
Where'er abuts I 
goes. 
I 
shouldn't wonder if 
'Twoult1 be my pre&ms luck 
Forever in the mud 
Of misery to be stuck. 
ClIORIJS. 
Oh! I'm a 
used- up man, 
Oh I 
I'm a 
used-up man; 
But if ever I 
gets up again, 
I'll stick up like a 
man. 
I 
'
spose that when I 
dies, 
From Satan I'll be driven, 
And made to loaf around about, 
Outside the walls of heaven. 
With no one there to take me in, 
Like a 
true friend to greet me, 
And nary one to cheer me up, 
And not a 
soul to treat me. 
Oh! I'm, eta. 
I'd get along like grease, 
If it wasn't for these ere clothes, 
This crownless hat and shabby co-it, 
And also my rummy nose; 
My boots are waterproof, 
Whick makes me happy feel; 
For, the water comes in at the toes, 
And goes out at the heel. 
Oh! I'm, etc:
