Dear Dr. Corse:
I think there is little doubt that the dance called “La Paloma” was a native Indian dance,
related perhaps to the so-called “Feather Dance” of the Creeks although the latters is
danced, so far as I am aware, only in the square ground. It evidently corresponded to
the calumet dance of the Mississippi River tribes and may have derived some features
from that although the old Florida Indians were somewhat outside of the area in which the
calumet dance was particularly in vogue.
Sincerely yours, /s/ JOHN R. SWANTON
