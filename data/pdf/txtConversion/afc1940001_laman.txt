LAMANDAThe song LAMANDA as told me by Chas. E. Walker early in the19th century or late in the
18th written of an early Indian raidsomewhere in the mountainous regions of the eastern states.
Sung tome by Chas. E. Walker and learned from Randall MacDonald in Idaho in1906.
The sun it had sunk in his home in the west,The twilight fast faded o'er the mossy hill's crest,All hope
for our captive had fled in dispairFor Lamanda was bound by the hand of White Bear.At the foot
of the mountain Lamanda did sigh,At the hoot of an owl or a catamounts catamount's cry,Or the
howl of the wild wolf in his lone gorgeous cell,Or the crash of an old forest tree as it fell.In the shade
of the wild hemlock, the wild game was thrown,And down from its branches their rude hammock
swung.From murder and plunder each warrior reposed,From dawn of the day 'til the evening had
closed.Their campfires were kindled and fanned by the breeze,The light shining over the evergreen
trees.In the glow of the embers embers each warrior stood round,Impatiently waiting their death
dancing song.They brought forth their (captain) captive forsaken, forlorn,Her face bathed in blood
and her garments all torn.She viewed her [sad?] fate at the hands of her foes 2 Page 2LAMANDAAnd
sighed for the time when her suffering sufferings were o'er.To a stake they then bound her with
green willow thongs,Her courage had left her, her strength was all gone.To torture their captive they
then did prepare,And the fire was kindled by the hands of White Bear.Young Alvin, their chieftain
with pride did draw near,With an eye like and eagle and a step like a deer.Saying, "Forbear, noble
braves, your tortures torture forbear,For the white maid shall leave, by my wampum I swear."He
cut loose her bonds that caused her much pain,He gave her sweet freedom from her captors
again;It [filled?] [her with joy?] and she blushed like a rose,When he gave her a blanket on which to
repose.He watched all the night till the dawn of next day,When a light (bark was seen) canoe was
seen gliding awayRan swift as the wild duck [ skims swims ?] over the tide,Young Alvin and Lamanda
together did ride.It was early that evening, a white cot was seen,The blue smoke a-curlin' o'er the
[ low ?] willows green;Great joy was Lamanda's on reaching the shoreTo behold her dear father and
mothers mother once more.Young Alvin stood by (defective)And his heart filled with joy, tears ran
down his [ wace face ?],And all that (he said for) asked for the kindness he showedWas food from
Lamanda to the chief of the woods.
