New how many men there are who ride in fortune's car, 
And bar and bolt their door against the poor; 
Just because they've lots of gold, and their heart's 
turned icy cold. 
Now they ought to lie condemned for that, I'm sure. 
In egitrds to th ,tt, poor race, who tramp from place to place, 
And some of them are men from top to toe; 
And although they are forced to beg, they're not at 
all a 
dreadful plague, 
And if you study it I'm sure you'll find it so. 
CHORUS. 
Iticn whene'er you meet a 
tramp, who bears 
misfortunes stamp, 
God forbid a 
kick, or from that you might give, 
Bat give him a 
hearty grip, wish him luck upon his trip, 
And remember that the poor tramp has to live. 
Now once I 
knew 0. tramp whom misfortune called a 
scamp, 
And let lo ,se their d,
ugs for fear that he might steal; 
And as he turned away,..1 saw him kneel down and pray, 
And God above I 
knew heard his appeal.

.E1IEMBER THAT 'UHF, POOR TRAMP-HAS 
Now how little do they know, as 11 
tramps through 
rain and tin' 
But once he was as happy as a king, 
Until misfortunes cruel dart ctia;,e and pierced his 
noble heart, 
And robbed him of his name and everything. 
Chorus as before. 
Once I 
heard a 
tramp relate the sad story of his fate 
And why he was an outcast shuned by all; 
Once he led a 
happy life, and he loved home and wife, 
But, alas, like Eve that woman had to fall. 
And when she grew weak and pale, I've no need 
to tell the tal,. 
For he turned his manly form to sad disgrace, 
He left his home and child and never since has 
But sadly now he tr..raps from place toplace. 
Chorus as before.

No doubt you've all heard of the proud Sixty- Ninth, 
The pride of the American army, 
And you'll oft find a 
captain of that gallant corps, 
Whose danger oft- times has alarMed ye. 
Old Ireland thinks well of her brave Sixty- Ninth, 
And to Erin her men are no strangers; 
And are they not christened, in proof of my word, 
" 
The brave Sixty-Ninth Musket Rangers?"

We are members in the gallant 
Sixty-Ninth Musket 
Rangers, 
They are the boys who have seen many dangers, 
The pride of old Ireland, men that never changes,

hurrah, for the gallant Sixty-iVinth. 
When war's bugle calls to the front, off we march, 
And our foe we soon bring to the slaughter; 
On Indian territory, or where duty calls, 
For our country we'd shed blood like water. 
Our courage has never been daunted as yet, 
To fear, shure, our men are still strangers; 
ould foreign invaders come thither our shores,

Our name is Pat and Kittle Car, 
From Castle Bar we came; 
Two Irish dancers sure we are, 
And for it we've gained great fame; 
The boys and girls when work was done, 
They would come from near and far; 
All bent on dancLg reels and jigs, 
With the pair from Castle Bar. 
Cnonu.s: 
At a 
jig or a 
reel on toe or heel, 
We're unequaled near or far; 
Arrah by night or day there's none so gay 
As the pair from Castle Bar. 
Of champion (lancers we've a 
lot, 
Who dance with clogs or skates; 
Prize belts and silver medals 
They have got on their breasts as large as plates. 
When each comes on the stage to dance, 
Sure be thinks himself a 
star; 
With their fancy touches they stand no chance 
With the pair from Castle Bar.

Ow picture of his father, sure at least the women say. 
There v

Sure you couldn't think much less of him if he wasn't 
yours at all.

So it's Dominick, take the baby, don't you kear me what

With the rubbing and the scrubbing I'm nearly murdered 
all the day; 
The divil a 
bit of rest I 
get, and it nearly drives me wild, 
Arrah have you any reason, man, why don't you take the 
child? 
For you I 
left my father and my darling mamma, too, 
And I 
crossed the briny ocean in a 
ferryboat with you; 
'Twas in the days when I 
was young and my poor heart

DOMINICK, TARE. TIIE BABY—CONTINUED. 
There's something here about the men and so it is by you, 
For you think a woman about the house has very little to 
do; 
But. Dominick, if you had to nurse, I 
know it would 
drive you wild, 
For you little know the trouble that's connected wiih 
child. 
Yes, there's something else about the men and it's to your-
self 
tell, 
When a 
girl is young and single, sure you love her very 
well; 
BHI in the matrimonial state yot draw things rather mild, 
For you find 
on get less loving when you're bothered 
with a 
child. 
it's to the magistrate's I'll go, and divorcement I 
will gel. 
And I'll have the lawyer's papers fixed to suit myself, you 
bet: 
And in the lawyer's papers, I 
will have it clearly filed 
Thu I 
will take thefurniture. but you must take the child. 
Oh. Dominick, don't you mind me, don't you heed n'

There's where I

Where stout Irish lads they are willing and hearty 
To make for their friends a

Have lived, and are happy on Erin's green shore;

You may think that I 
am mad, but I 
only do feel sad, 
And the reason I 
will tell you every one; 
courted a 
nice young girl, and her name was Peggy Doylt 
And I 
took her to Coney isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, and she weighs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all the while ; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she wou'd never go to 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave their hats, 
And shouted float her Pat, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reahed the pier, we went and had some 
beer, 
And after that we went to have a 
bathe. 
You may talk about the fat woman that travels with Ba:: 
num's show, 
But you'd ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom was on fire, 
And some ot them gave me a 
grand hurrah ! 
WIRT" a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth 
Be heavens shouted out, there's one of the lions 
it 
That escaped the other day. Chora 
Now of course I 
did feel mad after listening to that lad, 
A 
nd I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
)3ut if I 
had him in New York, up near toe Central Park, 
You can bet that I 
would break his heart. 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
always take my own part all the while; 
Arrah musha! bad luck to Pea', 
May she lose one of ht legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island.

Till the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey, swallow'd glass and all,

Such a

never did see, 
And never in my life had I 
such a

Old Donovan himself was managing the floor, 
And old Casey, the piper, was sitting at the door, 
When Mrs. Moriarty, while a 
pedling out the boor, 
Run against old Casey and knocked him out of the ch...1 
CHORUS. 
There was lots of fun for all the boys, 
And lots of rum and lemon pies, 
There was pipes, tobacco, punch and tee, 
And we danced like the devil 
Until the break of day. 
There was One-legged Dougherty a 
sitting on a btrmt 
With long Gill Riley and cross-eyed Farrell, 
And Miss OlRooney's sister, Jane 
Ws 
dancing a

Then One-legged Dougherty—he got tight, 
Heaped on the floor and wanted to fight, 
And we fired him out before he had a

Sure we had the devils's owntime at Donovan's danr.

The Escape of the Catalpia Six. 
Words by TuoMAs illAntrinn, and sung to the air of " Little Robin, Tell 
Bitty I 
am Coming,'with great success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Come, gather kinds, and listen, 
And a 
story to you 1 
will tell, 
You, no doubt, have heard of Erin's great heroes, 
Who 
in the latest of battles have fell. 
But the greatest of things that have happened, 
And may never happen no more, 
Is the escape of the six Fenian prisoners, 
Away from Australia's shore. 
Let us hope then the day is not distant, 
When the Irish shall rise up in bands, 
And sever the bonds that unite them, 
And make of themselves a 
free laud. 
When these good men were sentenced in Ireland, 
Their country for trying to save, 
They were sent to the shores of Australia, 
And there made the proud Saxons' slaves, 
And they served out ten years of their life time, 
And they vowed that they would serve no more, 
So they escaped on the good ship Catalpia, 
And sailed for America's shore. 
(Chorta.) 
When the good men escaped to the whaleship. 
The authorities thought them to stay, 
So they sent out their warship Georgetta, 
Before they had time to away. 
" 
Now, we want you to deliver those prisoners, 
Or on you we will fire if you lag." 
And they answered, " If on us you fire, 
You will be insulting our American flag."

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better her, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
Cnouus. 
Just because I 
am Iri3h they would give me no work. 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aiut it bard now,I ask you,that such things shonld be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly as:k you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon .hem 
In America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to oflend, 
. As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of re-t 
away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there,

And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had a

Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that,

Dan McCarthy's Advice. 
Is you listen to me I 
will sing you a 
song 
Of something that happened to me, 
I 
went to the theatre a 
short time ago, 
All the pretty girls for to see. 
Now, the first that came out on the stage. 
Was a 
young girl in her teens, 
And she NN ore spangled clothes, 
And went around on her toes, 
And she roped me behind the scenes. 
Cnonus. 
So now, kind friends, take my advice, 
And keep away from the girls in their teens, 
For you \yin find them old enough to chew !. ay. 
When they get you Withal the scenes. 
It's the devil's own place, as you will find, 
But that's as you may think, 
Where the girls will tickle you under the 
in, 
And it will cost you a 
dollar for a 
drin, 
Yes, and they use all kinds of circus slang, 
"Stag the terrier with the striped jeans." 
Oh, they roped me in with the rest of the zt,-,nix, 
When they got me behind the scenes,

In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
A.re Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all

But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a

To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here,

can, 
A.nd God will bless the heart

I'm a

A

Music, sweet music by night or by day,

Oh ! Angel of Love, cone list to my lay! 
I'm proud of my country, that dear Isle so green, 
The fairest of lassies and lads may he seen, 
Where such men as Emmet, O'Connell :Ind Moore, 
Have lived, sang and cherished that bright sunny shore! 
The shamrock of Ireland and the lilly of France, 
We love with a 
fondness that nothing but chance, 
Will pluck from our bosom's kept warm and true, 
With a

Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and children home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father—the little son of a

Oh, oh, we're proud foremen on the Elevated

THE $5 
NOTE. 
A Comic Song sung by FRANK LEWIS, ESQ., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. 
Written 1;y FRED SHAW. 
trie night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree. 
Thro drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be, 
My cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
I 
borrowed from a 
friend a $5 
note. 
Cnottust 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things 111.quote, 
11.1 tell you how I 
spent that $5 
note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a WWI, 
\Villa into my note made a 
very big bole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
l:p went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
J ,I be boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
e 
walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
tn2,, throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be. 
A. poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And be got the last dollar of the 
note.

MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA.

I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love, 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner_ and a 
vulgar voice will „ 
shout— 
CHORt7s: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Yah! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob; 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For P-Aly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go. 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
39 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA.—CONTINUED . 
.FVe wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
he free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
could hear, 
Nitd whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus). 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
fl;lor everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must:know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOKEN.—Oh! oh! ob.! 
(Chorus).

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at H ARRIGAN

Broadway. New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned heft 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
Cnortus: 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they till my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells. 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands: 
There's an old wooden bench by that old iireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
smoking his old fashioned_ clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think. of the dear, old Nippy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, Yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
it is the earnest wish I 
give to you,

Soon he is coming to kiss me again.

Kiss me again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I

How it will cheer you and banish all cano• 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!"

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
line 
CHORUS: • 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
lie tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
Frovi the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there.

last limm}

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
A.a sung by FRANK Lswis at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I 
have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in Ole hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed*; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here: 
A. Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in Washington some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in it ,; 
day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men: 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warnintr, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced sonic good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage hal had yet, 
Ia Mayo's sweet face we should Iterer forget.

One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring; 
Then you place him on the carpet,

When the sunshine of youth fades, and age bends us low,— 
Joys, like the birds, flown away ;

Will beam like a rain- bow in spring; 
By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing:

Amber tresses tied in blue.

The Day When You'll Forget Me. 
OVER THE MOUNTAIN. 
Words by " Mono.ix." 
Music by J. R. Tnomin. 
As sung by JE>aran Monomc. 
b2teSiO to be had of OLIVER DirsoN 4: Co., Boston, Mass., Priee oohs 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
,The day when you'll forget me, 
The thy when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that evyry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush I 
let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above .me ; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet bush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
kh I 
nQ, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

I'm always light-hearted and aisy, 
Not a 
care in the woad have I, 
Because I 
am loved by a 
Colleen, 
I 
coukent forget if' I 
try. 
She lives far away o'er the mountain, 
Where I 
know she's still thinking of me, 
Arrah 
Cushla AleChree were I 
with you, 
This moment how happy I'd be. 
It's over; yes, over the mountain, 
Where the little thrush sings on the tree; 
In a 
cabin all covered with ivy, 
There my Eily is waiting for me. 
The day I 
bid good-bye to Eily, 
That day I 
will ne'er forget, 
How the tears bubbled up from their slumber, 
I 
fancy I 
see them yet. 
They looked like the pearls in the ocean, 
As she wept the tears of' love, 
Says she,— Teddy, my boy, don't forget me, 
Till we meet again here or above. 
— CHORCS. 
Oh ! water and land may divide us, 
Friends, like flowers, come and go; 
The face of my Eily will cheer me, 
For in that dear face I 
well know, 
The imprint of love and tkvotion, 
Surrounded by thoughts chaste and pure, 
Will serve as the sta.( to the sailor, 
Whilst plodding the wild raging moor.

Englishman, Scotchman, and Irishman. 
As sung by TnomAS WINNETr. - 
An Englishman, Scotchman and Irishman were sentenced to twain 
for stealing sheep, and hi i 
Honor the Judge ' wormed them he would 
' 
be very lenient with them, and give them their choice of dying, that is 
they could die according to their own nationality. 
So the tint to 
take the noer was the ENGLISiimeN, who sang as fellows: 
Let me die on the oak. 
The brave old oak, 
That stands in the greenwood lawn, 
Let me die on the oak, 
The dear old oak, - 
With its hundred of arms so strong, 
The next was the ScorcnimAii who sang as follow': 
The moon's on the lake, 
•And the mist on the gen,-
And the glen that was known 
That is nameless by day, 
If their robbers by night, 
And pursue us with beagles, 
Give the flood to the rocks, 
And the flesh to the sea-gulls. 
Then hollo! hollo! hollo! 
Then hollo 
hollo ! hollo 
While there's rope in old Scotland, 
And a 
tree by the river, 
It's there let me die Judge, 
And hang there forever. 
Third and last was the Imsnmes, who sang as follows: 
There's the Englishman and Scotchman 
As you plainly see, 
Have their own way of dying 
And that you'll agree, 
But I 
would be hung to a 
gooseberry tree, 
Before the daylight In the morning. 
But a 
goosehery tree says the judge is too low 
To Iraig a 
man on it and that you all know, 
Then Pat gave a 
wink to the Jury below, 
Saying, 
in no hurry, 
?aAth, 11L wait till she grows. 
,And the tree never grew.)

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN. 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companioos so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Ilecailitig each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
Arfd when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
tear the old village school on the green.

APPLES AND PEARS, 
Written and sung in character by JERRY COHAN. 
I'm a 
widdy wid fourteen small childer, 
My husband was kilt in the van; 
lie wint for to go for a 
soger, 
They murthered my darlin ould man. 
From the government I 
gets a 
pinsion, 
That stone wid me childer I 
shares; 
As it is'nt enough to maintain them, why 
I 
must sell Apples and Pears. 
Apples! Pears! do you want any Apples or Pears? 
Sure if I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
But what con a 
poor widdy do'! 
I 
cannot stand all day at the wash- tub, 
The raison I'll tell now to you. 
I 
am throubled bad wid the Rhumatics, 
So I 
often can't kneel for me prayers. 
So I 
saddles meself to the basket, 
Or stand selling Apples and Pears. 
SPOKEN — If my poor Dennis was to see Inc now—my 
poor Dennis was as dacint a 
father's and mother's child as 
you'd meet in a 
month of Sunday's—and when he took his 
hod up the ladder, he looked like a 
king assinding his 
throne, so he did. 
Ile always trates me like a 
lady; he 
comes home drunk and bates me black and blue; then he 
axes me pardon, and sez it was only lazing me he was; he 
fell from the ladder; he broke his back and busted his 
collar bone; then he had a 
touch of the grand epelacal, 
cut apical, penticurical supernatural eerebro spinal monan-
aigue, and now I'm selling— 
Apples! Pears! do you want any Apples and Pears?

neat little 
book. bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FISHER. No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the medus operandi ot flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

American Fortune-Teliing Cards.—This is the old-

These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts. Clubs, Dia-

and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rews, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated. but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemina. many li yea are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the mime as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
