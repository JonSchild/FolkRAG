The Mormon-eyed PreacherThere was in old man, his name it was George,A Mormon-eyed preacher
worked down at the forge.A good woman's husband was George's own friend,And oft came there
their souls for to mend.Wack fol-de-rol-lol, wack fol-der-eye; yoodle-eye; dinkie-ding-day. *This good
woman's husband no Mormon was he,But a jolly old churchman both jovial and free.He'd take down
his bottle and take a big dram,And kept his house stored with good bacon and ham.Refrain: [md]
Wack fol-de-rol-lol, &c.One day as George he chanced to be thereA-looking around with cunning and
care,A-looking around both cunning and sly,When into his pocket he cast a full sigh.Refrain: [md]
Wack fol-de-rol-lol, &c."Oh, what cha got there done up in a rag?Oh, what cha got there tied up in a
bag?"My Bible, my Bible, I'll tell you forthwith,And the secrets therein revealeth Joe Smith."Refrain:
[md] Wack fol-de-rol-lol, &c."If that is your Bible, you'd better your life,But I believe it's some bacon
you stole from my wife!So pull it out quickly," the old churchman he cried,"Or by the long devil, I'll
Bible your hide."Refrain: [md] Wack fol-de-rol-lol, &c.George hustled around, there fell on the floorA
big piece of bacon weighed twelve pounds or more.He took to his heels, no time for to idle.From
that day 'til this he has preached from his Bible.Refrain: [md] Wack fol-do-rol-lol, &c.Now, come all
you good old churchmen who live a jolly life;Take care of your bacon as well as your wife;Those
Mormon-eyed preachers great care should be taken,They'll preach all the time, but they're devils for
bacon.Refrain: [md] Wack fol-de-rol-lol, &c.
