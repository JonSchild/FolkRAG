THE NOON IS UP. 
The moon is up and in the sky, 
The stars are shining bright, 
And every breeze that murmurs by, 
Seems whispering with delight: 
Then come with me and roam afar, 
And listen to my sweet guitar. 
The waters on the lake are clear, 
And there the moonbeams play; 
My 
little bark is waiting here, 
To bear thee, love, away. 
Then come, &e. 
Hark I 
hark the gentle birds of night, 
Warble their plaintive song, 
And swiftly o'er the water bright, 
They seem to float along. 
Then come, dm. 
THE CANADIAN BOAT SONG. 
Faintly as tolls the ev'ning chime, 
Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time; 
Soon as the woods on shore look dim, 
We'll sing at St. Ann's oar parting hymn:. 
Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast, 
The rapids are near, and the day-light's past. 
Why should we yet our sail unfurl ? 
There is not a 
breath the blue wave to curl; 
But when the wind blows off the shore, 
Oh I 
sweetly we'll rest our wearied oar. 
Blow, breezes, blow, the stream, drc. 
Utawa tide I 
this trembling moon 
Shall see us float over thy surges soon: 
Saint of this green isle I 
hear our prayer, 
Grant us cool heavens and favoring air / 
Blow, breezes, blow, the stream, ctob

SAILOR'S WELCOME HOME. 
When first at sea the sailor lad 
With terror views the whitening billow, 
And sighs for cot, or main or dad, 
Where flows the stream beneath the willow. 
But safe returned, past danger spurned, 
He laughs at ocean's threanting foam : 
Main, sister, and he, all join with glee, 
And sing the sailor's welcome home. 
When next at sea the bolder youth, 
No more ascends the mast with terror, 
Yet pensive wishes Mary's truth, 
May clear the rocks and shoals of error. 
The 1,oyage o'er, he comes ashore, 
And finds her heart could never roam: 
Then Poll and he get wed with glee, 
And sing the sailor's welcome home.

'TIS SAD TO PART. 
Tis sad to part from those we love, 
We ne'er may meet again ; 
When kindred spirits friendship prove, 
They sever but with pain. 
And oh ! the parting word and tear, 
The sigh, the last farewell, 
Give to the soul a 
ton% of fear, 
Far more than Bpi, Wtan lips can tell. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis sad to part from those we love, 
We neer may meet again, 
When kindred spirits friendship prove, 
They sever but with pain. 
And when from those we have to part, 
Who've loosed a 
friendship's tie. 
'Tis there that sorrow wounds the heart 
And makes the bosom sigh. 
Kind words and acts will ever prove 
The means to bury bate ; 
Then let us all forgive and love, 
Ere it may be too late. 
'Tis sad to part, Sce.

HARRY BLUFF. 
When a 
boy, harry Bluff left his friends and his home, 
And his dear native land, o'er the ocean to roam ; 
Like a 
sappling he sprung, he was fair to the view, 
He was a 
trite Yankee oak, boys, the older he grew. 
Though his body was weak and his hands they were soft 
When the signal was given he first went aloft. 
The veterans all cried, 
He'll one day lead the van, 
For though rated a 
boy he'd the soul of a 
man, 
And the heart of a 
true Yankee sailor. 
When to manhood promoted and burning for fame, 
Still in peace or iii war Harry Bluff was the same; 
So true to his love, and in battle so brave, 
The myrtle and laurel entwined o'er his grave. 
For his country he fell, when by victory crowned, 
The flag shot away, fell in tatters around ; 
The the thought he'd struck, but he sung out—" Avast!" 
And Columbia's colors he nailed to the mast, 
And died like a 
true Yankee sailor. 
GALLANT TOM. 
It blew great guns when gallant Tom 
Was taking in a 
sail, 
And squalls came on in sight of home, 
That strengthened to a 
gale ; 
Broad sheets of vivid lightning glared, 
Reflected by the main ; 
And even gallant Tont despaired, 
To see his love agr
.tha. 
The storm came on each rag on board, 
Was into tatters rent; 
The rain through every crevice poured ; 
All feared the dread event. 
The pumps were choked—their awful doom 
Seemed sure at every strain— 
Each tar despaired. e'en gallant Tom, 
To see his love again. 
The leak was stop% the wind grew dull, 
The billows ceased to roar. 
And the torn ship alniost a 
hull, 
In safety reaehed the shore. 
Crowds ran to see the Nvond'rous sight! 
The storm had raged in vain ; 
And gallant Tom, with true delight, 
Beheld his love again.

THE SHIPWRECKED TAR. 
Escaped with life in tatters, 
Behold me safe ashore ; 
Such trifles little matter, 
I'll soon get togs galore: 
For Poll swore when we parted, 
No chance her faith should jar, 
And Poll's too tender-hearted, 
To slight a 
shipwrecked tar. 
To Poll his course straight steering, 
He hastens on apace ; 
Poor Jack can't get a 
hearing-, 
She never saw his face ! 
Front Meg, Dol, Sue, and Kitty, 
Relief is just as far, 
Not one has the least pity 
For a 
poor shipwrecked tar. 
This whom he thought love's needle, 
Now his sad misery mocks ; 
That wants to call the beadle, 
To set him in the stocks ! 
Cried Jack, this is hard dealing, 
The elements at war 
Than this had kinder feeling. 
They spar'd a 
shipwrecked tar. 
But all their taunts and fetches 
A judgment are on me ; 
I, for those hardened wretches 
Dear Nancy, slighted thee : 
But see, poor Tray assails me, 
his mistress is not far ; 
He wags his tail and hails me. 
Though a 
poor shipwrecked tar. 
'Twas faithful love that brought him, 
Oh, lesson for mankind ! 
'Tis one, cried she, I 
taught him, 
For on my constant mind 
Thy image, dear, was graven. 
And now removed each bar, 
My arms shall be the haven 
For my poor shipwrecked tar. 
Heaven and my love reward thee; 
I'm shipwrecked, but I'm rich ; 
I 
shall with pride regard thee : 
Thy love shall so bewitch 
With wonder each fond fancy, 
That children, near and far, 
Shall lisp the name of Nancy. 
That saved her shipwrecked tar. 
ROW, ROW. 
Row! row homeward we steer, 
Twilight falls oW 
us, 
hark! hark! music is near, 
Friends glide before us. 
Song lightens our labor, 
Sing as onward we go; 
Keep each with his neighbor 
Time as we row 
CHORUS, 
Row! row! homeward we go 
Twilight falls o'er us. 
Row row! sing as we flow, 
Day files before us. 
Row! row! sing as we go, 
Nature rejoices; 
hark! how the hills as we flow 
Echo our voices. 
Still o'er the dark waters 
Far away we must roam, 
Ere Italy's daughters 
Welcome us home, 
Row, row, etc. 
Row! row! see in the west 
Lights dimly burning, 
Friends in you harbor of rest 
Wait our returning, 
See now they burn clearer--
Keep time with the oar; 
Now, now we are nearer 
That happy shore. 
Row, row, etc. 
Home, home, daylight o'er, 
Friends stand before us ; 
Yet ere our boat touch the shore 
Once more the chorus.

TAX' IT, MAN, TAX' IT. 
When I 
was a 
miller in Fife, 
Bosh! I 
thought that the sound o' the happer 
Saul, Tak' hame a 
wee flow to your wife, 
To help to h brose to your supper, 
Then my conscience was narrow and pure, 
But someway by random it rackit; 
For I 
liftet twa neivefit' or mair, 
While the h•pper said, Tak' it, man, tale it. 
CHORUS. 
Then hey for the mill and the kiln, 
The garland and gear for my cogie, 
And hey for the whisky and yill, 
That washes the dust frac my craigie. 
Although its been fang in mitre, 
For rogues to make rich by e,ceiving; 
Yet I 
see that it disna-weel suit, 
Honest men to begin to the thieving. 
For my heart it gaed dunt upon duut, 
Od, I 
thought ilka dent it wad erackit; 
Sae I {tang frac my Delve what was in't, 
Still the happer said, Tak' it, luau, tak' it. 
Theu hey for the mill, &a. 
A man that's been bred to the plough, 
Might be deav'd wi' its clamorous clapper; 
Yet there's few but -would suffer the sough, 
After kenning what's said by the happer. 
I 
whiles thought it scald m') to scorn, 
Saying, Shame, is your conscience no eltackit; 
But when I 
grew dry for a 
horn, 
Itchauged aye to Tak' it, man. tale it. 
Then hey for the mill, &C 
Th smugglers whiles cam' wi' their packs, 
'Cause they kent that I 
liked a 
bicker, 
Sae I 
barter'd whyles wi' the gawks, • 
Gi'ed them grain for a 
soup o' their liquor; 
I 
had lam( been accustomed to drink, 
A nd aye when I 
purpose to gnat it, 
That thing wi' its clappertie clink 
Said aye to me, Tak' it, man, tak' it. 
Then hey for the mill, &C. 
But the warst thing I 
did in my life, 
Nae doubt but ye'll think I 
was wrang o't, 
Od' I 
taut(' a 
bit bodle in Fife 
A' my tale, and he made a 
bit sang o't, 
I 
have aye had a 
voice a' my days, 
But for singin' I 
ne'er got the knack o't; 
Yet I 
try whyiesjust thinking to please. 
My frieu's here wi' Tak' it. man, tale it. 
Then hey for the mill, &c. 
Now. miller and a' as 
am. 
This far I 
can see through the matter: 
There's men mair, notorious to fame, 
Mair greedy than me o' the muter, 
For ' twad seen that the hale race o' men, 
Or wi' safety, the ha'f we mak' it, 
Ha'e some speaking happer 
That says aye to them, Tak' it, man, tak it. 
Then hey for the mill, &e. 
MY FATHERLAND. 
I 
hear them speak of my fatherland, 
And feel like a 
mountain child, 
When they tell of the gallant jager band, 
And the chamois bounding wild, 
Of the snow-capped hills to heaven that soar, 
Where the avalanches fall, 
And the chalet's joys when chase is o'er, 
And the Itanz des Vanches, they call, 
cnonus. 
And when the tear would dim my eyes, 
I 
raise the Alpine lay, 
In the rapids' roar I 
drown my sighs, 
And dance sad thoughts away. 
La, la, In. 
O'er the mighty Hudson's bank I 
roam, 
Through the giant forest stray, 
And breathe a 
sigh for that mountain home, 
And the joys so far away. 
In thought at eve I 
join each sport, 
And the pastor's blessing share, 
With maidens in their kirtells short, 
And their golden bodkin'd hair, 
And when, SLe.

LOOK ALOFT. 
In the tempest of life, when the wave and the gale 
Are around and above, if thy footing should fail, 
if thine eye should grow dim, and thy caution depart, 
Look aloft and be firm and confiding of heart. 
If the friend who embraced in prosperity's glow, 
With a 
smile for each joy and a 
tear for each woe, 
Should betray thee when sorrows like clouds are arrayed, 
Look aloft to the friendship which never shall fade. 
Should the visions which hope spreads in light to thine 
eye, 
Like the tints of the rainbow the swifter to fly, 
Then turn and through tears of repentant regret, 
Look aloft to the Sun that is never to set. 
Should they who are dearest—the son of thy heart, 
The wife of thy bo.3om in sorrow depart. 
Look aloft from the darkness and dust of the tomb, 
To the soil where affection is ever in bloom. 
And oh ! when death comes, in his terrors to cast 
His fears on the future, his pall on the past. 
In the moment of darkness, with hope in thy . 
heart, 
And a 
smile in thy eye, look aloft and depart.

I 
All A HOMELY MAN. 
Written and Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air.—" The Album." 
I 
was not born a 
handsome man, 
The reason I 
cannot tell, 
But that I 
am a 
homely " cuss," 
Bedad, sir, I 
know it well. 
My nose it is a 
bit too long, 
My eyes they have a 
queer tip, 
And worst of all, I 
know I 
have 
An ugly and big hare-lip. 
CHORUS. 
I 
can't believe it yet, ' tis true, 
A gal once fell in love with me, 
And made me happy, happy, yes, 
Happy as I 
e'er could be. 
Spoken.--Y 
es, I 
tell you I 
present a 
sorry picture for a 
lover, and yet it was my good fortune the other night to 
rescue a 
fair damsel from the attack of a 
party of insulting 
ruffians. I 
offered her my escort home, and was glad to 
find that we were neighbors, I 
living at 42 and my fair lady 
at 43. just opposite. Next day I 
received a 
note, which ran 
as follows: 
Sweet sir, that lives at forty-two, 
My gratitude is very great. 
I 
know you're beautiful, and that 
With heroes you are a 
mate. 
Last night I 
spent in happy dreams, 
And I 
saw your handsome face 
Smiling sweetly down upon me, 
Bright with every manly grace. 
Spoken.— Now. just imagine an ugly cuss like me receiv-
ing such a 
dear epistle from such a 
lovely creature, as I 
uow this fair correspondent must be. 
Beautiful! yes 
[1] 
I 
AM A HOMELY MAN. , CONCLUDED. 
beautiful as a 
dream. From hence I 
felt that I 
should not 
regret my hideous appearance, since my heroic qualities 
had made me appear sweet and beautiful in the eyes of one 
of earth's fairest daughters. 
I 
can't believe, tte. 
Next night I 
also dreamed a 
dream, 
I 
loved and I 
was beloved; 
In fancy o'er themes of bliss 
In joyfulness I 
roved. 
I 
woke, and lo! a 
billet-deux 
Lay nestled beneath the door; 
My waking joy was lighter now, 
And my heart thrilled to the core. 
Spoken.—But, alas! how shaky are the castles which we 
build. 
Would you believe it, the lovely creature who had 
written to me the day previous, gushing. all over with 
gratitude and admiration. sent me a 
cold letter, asking me 
not to take to heart anything she had written, as she was 
a 
wayward, bitter thing, and often did very foolish things ! 
She added, that she had watched for an opportunity, and 
had caught a 
glimpse of me the day following the sending 
of her first note, and my dignified appearance convinced 
her that she had done a 
foolish thing. I 
tore the letter in 
pieces, frantically paced the room, cursed the ingratitude 
of the human race, and concluded by singing: 
I 
can't believe, Sze. 
I 
am a 
gay old bachelor now, 
But I'm fat and hale and rich ; 
I 
often meet that foolish girl, 
A faded, snarling old witch. 
She married soon a 
handsome man, 
But he's homelier than me ; 
He's bloated, and ain't got a 
cent, 
A slave to gin and whisky. 
I 
can't believe &c.

First he wriggled, then he striggled, 
In the water so briny; 
He bellowed, and he yellowed 
Out for help, but in vain; 
Then down did he gently glide, 
To the bottom of the silv'ry tide, 
But previously to that he cried, 
" 
Farewell, Mary Jane." 
CHANT—On arriving at the terra firma, at the bottom of the

Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the refrain of the gentle song he sung, 
pinkie doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
Said the bold fisherman. 
His ghost walked that night 
To the bedside of his Mary Jane, 
Ile told her how dead he was; 
Then says she, " I'll go mad." 
"For since my love's dead," says she, 
"All joy from me's fled," says she, 
" 
I'll go a 
raving luniack," says she, 
And she went, very bad. 
CHANT—She thereupon tore her best chignon to smithereens, 
danced the " Can-can" on top of the water- butt, and joined " the, 
woman's rights association," and frequently edifies the angelic 
members by softly chanting— 
Dinkle doodle dum, dinkle doodle dum, 
That's the kind of soul-inspiring song she sung,

TREAD LIGHTLY, TREAD LIGHTLY. 
Written and Sung by Tor PASTOR. 
Air:—" Down in a 
Coal Mine." 
It seems but yesterday, dear boys, when he was in the lines 
His uniform " so spic and span," his looks so bright and 
fine; 
'Tis little that we booted then, he looked so brave and gay, 
That ere that morning sun went down that he would pass 
away. 
CTIOnt7S. 
Tread lightly, tread lightly, dear comrades, step this way, 
And shed a 
tear for Charley, who's passed away. 
'Twas at the post of duty he bravely fell, 
Gren be the memory of him we loved so well. 
It was sudden when the call came to summon us to arms, 
And we hurri ,?d from our workshops, sprung from our 
children's arms. 
But brave Charley was the first one to come with martial 
"To uphold law and order," he cried, " everything 
dare." 
Tread lightly, &c. 
And when we sung the choruses which to our ranks be-
long. 
We heard our gallant Charley's voice come bravely out, 
and ., trung ; 
It was " Rally round the flag, boys, up with the Stripes 
and Stars," 
TREAD LIGHTLY, &O. (CoNcLuDED. 
The same so ninny heroes sung when marching to the 
wars. 
Tread lightly, Sze. 
But oh! we heard the long-roll, our ranks were quickly 
formed, 
We all then marched, and every heart with fiery courage 
warmed. 
'Twas then the roar of battle broke, we marched with 
quicker tread, 
When, lo! a 
shower of bullets came, and struck our com-
rade dead. 
Tread lightly, & c. 
We could not stop just that moment to take him to the 
rear, 
Aud on the field poor Charley lay through many night 
hours drear. 
But now his form we've rescued, boys, the muffled drum 
SOIMC1S low ; 
Advance! look on your comrade, then filled a 
tear, and 
go. 
Tread lightly, &c. 
How little those who stay at home know of a 
soldier's 
sorrow ; 
The friend with whom we've laughed to-day, we're called 
to " plant " to-morrow. 
If ever you go fighting, there's one thing you will find, 
That when a 
soldier's called away, the sorrow's left be-
hind.

JENNY DANG THE WEAVER. 
At Willie's wedding on the green, 
The lasses, bonnie witches! 
Were a' drest out in aprons ciean, 
And braw white Sunday mutches. 
Auld Maggie bade the lads tak' tent, 
But jock would not believe her; 
But soon the fool his folly kent, 
For Jenny clang the weaver.

For Jenny clang the Weaver. 
At ilka country dance or reel, 
Wi' her he would be bobbing, 
When she sat down— then he sat down, 
And to her would be gabbing; 
Where'er she gaed, baith butt and ben, 
The coof would never leave her ; 
Ave kecklin' like a 
clocking hen, 
But Jenny dung the Weaver.

And bade the coot no cleave her ;

And clang the silly Weaver.

CHARMING ARABELLA. 
WITH HER BACK IIAIR DOWN. 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
once went down to Margate, just for a 
change of air, 
Was never so amused in all my life while I 
was there; 
There were cockneys, dressed like sailors, who strolled upon the 
sand, 
Some snobs, a 
jolly lot of snobs, who liked to do the grand; 
There, 
were swarms of pretty girls and amongbt, them there was 
one 
Who seemed a 
perfect Venus. whose eyes shone like the sun; 
She made the people stare, she electrified the town, 
When she walked along the stroet, with all her back-
hair down. 
alone's. 
She was a 
charming belle, in love with her I 
fell, 
And I 
really couldn't help it, for I 
felt done brown; 
Enough to kill a 
fellah was charming Arabella, 
As she walked along the jetty with her back-hair down. 
Each morning in the water see her bathing I'd be sure, 
Of all the pretty bathers none like her could do the cure; 
After that she might be seen without her crinoline, 
A-strolling, on the jetty quite as proud as any queen. 
You may guess there would be lot after such a 
girl as this,

CHARMING ARABELLA, &C.
—(CoNcLuDED. 
But I 
made her acquaintance, which I 
thought the height of bliss. 
As we'd promenade together many jealous looks were thrown 
At me, and at my charmer with the back-hair down. 
She was a 
charming belle, & c. 
One day we walked the jetty, the wind was rather high, 
Arabella scarce could keep her legs, by Jove I 
no more could I 
But still we thought we'd stand it, altho"twas hard to stand, 
The show of pretty buckles upon that day was grand. 
Of a 
sudden I 
felt stupefied, with both my eyes did stare, 
To see her hat, back-hair and all, go flying through the air; 
When I 
from my fright recovered, my charmer she had flown, 
She hurried from the spot without her back-hair down, 
She was a 
charming belle, &c. 
I 
tried my best to find her, as laughter met my ears, 
Instead of her I 
found her hair, midst most derisive jeers ; 
It was her hair that charmed me, oh! false, deceitful miss, 
'Twas fastened to her hat, a 
fact, for here it i. 
(Produces hair.) 
I 
felt somewhat disgusted, and then tried her to find, 
But she'd started off for town, and left her lovely hair behind. 
I've never seen her since, tho' I've been in many a 
town,

But I've had enough of charm'ers with back-hair down-
She was a 
charming belle. &c.

FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY. 
Ain:—" There's nao luck about the house." 
Ben Battle was a 
soldier bold, 
And used to war's alarms; 
But a 
cannon-ball took off his legs, 
So he laid down his arms. 
Now as they bore him off the field, 
Said he, " Let others shoot; 
For here I 
leave my second leg, 
And the 42nd foot I" 
The army-surgeons made him limbs, 
Said he, " They're only pegs, 
But they're as wooden members quite 
To represent my legs." 
Now Ben he loved a 
pretty maid, 
Her name was Nelly Gray, 
lie went to pay her his devoirs, 
When he'd devour'd his pay. 
But when he called on Nelly Gray, 
She made him quite a 
scoff; 
And when she saw his wooden legs, 
Begfm to take them off; 
"Oh, Nelly Gray ! oh, Nelly Gray! 
Is this your love so warm, 
The love that loves a 
scarlet coat, 
Should be more uniform !" 
Said she, " I 
lov'd a 
soldier once, 
For he was blythe and brave: 
But I 
will never have a 
man 
With both legs in the grave; 
Before V 
on had these timber toes, 
Your love I 
did allow ; 
But then, you know, von stand upon 
Another footin: now."

FAITHLESS KELLY GRAY. 
—[ CONCLUDED. 
" 
Oh, Nelly Gray! oh, Nelly Gray 
For all your jeering speeches, 
At duty's call I 
left my legs 
In Badajoz's breaches." 
" 
Why then," said she, " you've lost your feet 
Of legs in war's alarms ! 
And now you cannot wear your shoes 
Upon your feats of arms I" 
"Oh, false and fickle Nelly Gray I 
To you a 
long farewell! 
For you will be my death—alas I 
Will you not be my Nell?' 
Now when he went from Nelly Gray, 
His heart so heavy got. 
And life was such a 
burden grown, 
It made him take a 
knot. 
So round his melancholy neck. 
A 
rope he did entwine; 
And for the second time in life, 
Enlisted in the line; 
One end he tied around a 
beam, 
And then removed his pegs; 
And as his legs were off, of course, 
He soon was off his legs. 
And there he hung till he was dead 
As any nail in town! 
For though distress had cut him up, 
It could not cut him down! 
A 
dozen men sat on his corpse, 
To find out why he died, 
And they buried Ben in four cress roads, 
With a 
steak in his inside I

DIRTY DICKS AND X ATILDA HICKS. 
AS 
Sung by 1 
ON Y _PASTOR. 
In a 
certain street, called Bishopsgate, 
For many months I 
used to wait 
Night after night, *bout halt-past eight, 
To see my little "rilda Hicks; 
Her Lige, I 
think, was twenty-four, 
For rags and bones she kept a 
store,

To the celebrated Dirty Dicks. 
Dirty Dicks, Dirty Dicks, 
At Dirty Dicks', at Dirty Dicks', 
That blow was like a 
load of bricks 
When I 
heard that Matilda IIieks 
Had married a 
clerk at Dirty Dicks. 
Now, always with the setting sun, 
Whenever my head work was done, 
I'd call upon my darling one; 
I'm alluding to Matilda Hicks. 
Then what a 
fuss there'd be with me, 
With her she'd make me have some tea, 
And after that, quite reg-lar-l„,, 
She'd get some gin from Dirty Dicks.

DIRTY DICKS AND 
111.A.TrLDA HICKS.—[CoNcLuDzp. 
As time rolled on, I 
began- to see 
A wondrous change, what could it be? 
She did not seem to care for me, 
As once did my Matilda Hicks. 
I 
then got quite weak, pale, and thin, 
For every night that I 
went in, 
And she went out to fetch the gin, 
She stayed too long at Dirty Dicks.' 
Dirty Dicks, Mucky Dicks, dx.. 
This anguish, then, from week to week, 
I 
could not bear; says 1,—" I 
11 speak, 
Tell me, you, who loOks so meek, 
The cause of this, Matilda Hicks." 
Then thus she spoke, in solemn tones. 
"I'm going to marry William Jones, 
We open a 
store for rags and bones,

clerk engaged at Dirty Dicks. 
Dirty Dicks, Dusty Dicks, (tc. 
My love is now turned into hate, 
I'll vengeance have, altho' I'll wait, 
For years and years it's not too late; 
Revenge is sweet, Matilda Hicks. 
By night and day may she hear my groans, 
May she be reduced to rags and bones; 
I'll triumph yet o'er Mrs. Jones, 
And her shabby clerk from Dirty Dicks'.

THE OLD BACHELOR. 
A IR 
The Old Maid." 
When I 
was a 
schoolboy aged ten. 
Oh mighty little Greek I 
knew; 
With my short stripd trousers, and now and then 
With stripes upon my jacket too 
When I 
saw other boys to the play ground run, 
I 
threw my old Gradus by, 
And I 
eft the task I 
had scarce begun— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that,' said I. 
When I 
was at college my Fide was—dress, 
And my groom. and my bit of blo3d; 
at as for my study, I 
must confess 
That I 
was content with my stud. 
T 
was deep in my tradesmen's books, I'm afraid, 
Tho not in my own, by the bye; 
An kben rascally tailors came to be pail— 
There'll be time enough for that,' said I. 
I 
was just nineteen when I 
first fell in love, 
And I 
scribbl'd a 
deal of rhyme; 
An 1 1 Iflik'd to mystlf in a 
shady grove, 
And I 
thought i 
was quite sublim., 
I 
was torn from my love 1 ' twas a 
dreadful blow, 
And t':e lady she wiped her eye; 
But I 
didn't die of grief, oh dear me, no— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
The next was a 
lady of rank, a 
dame, 
With blood in her veins, you see; 
With the leaves of the peerage she fann'd the flame, 
That now was consuming me. 
But tho' of her c
,r,Itt descent she spoke, 
I 
found she was still very high. 
And I 
thought looking up to a 
wife no joke— 
^ 
There'll be Lime enotr,Jh for that," said I. 
My next penchant was for one whose face 
Was her fortune, she was so fair I 
Oh! she spoke with an air of enchanting grace, 
But a 
man cannot live upon air.

THE OLD BACHELOR.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
And when poverty enters the door, young Love 
Wi I 
out of the casement fly; 
The truth of the proverb I'd no wish to prove— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
My next was a 
lady who lov'd romance, 
And wrote very splendid things; 
And she said with a 
sneer when I 
asked her to dance, 
" 
Sir, I 
ride upon a 
horse with win ,rs" 
Thee was ink on h, r 
thumb when I 
kiss'd her hand, 
And she whisper'd, " If you should die 
I, will write you an e, itaph gloomy and grand"— 
•".rhere'll be time enough for that," said I. 
left her, and sported my figure and face, 
At opera, party, and ball : 
I 
met 1)rett 
i 
Is at ey'ry place, 
But I 
found a 
detect in all. 
The first did not suit me. I 
cannot tell bow, 
The second I 
cannot say why; 
And the third, bless me, I 
will not marry now— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that,'' said I. 
I 
look'd in the -.
71ass, and I 
thought I 
could trace, 
A 
sort of a 
wrinkle or two ; 
So I 
Ina e 
up my mind that I'd make up my face. 
And come out as good as new. 
To my hair i 
imparted a 
little more jet, 
And I 
scarce could suppress a 
sigh; 
But I 
ca' not be quite an old b 
tchelor yet— 
No, " there's time enough for that, ' said I. 
I 
was now fifty-one, yet I 
still did adopt 
All the airs of a 
juvenile beau; 
But somehow whenever the question I 
popp'd, 
The nirls with a - augh said " No." 
I 
am sixty to-4ay, not a /pry young man, 
And a 
bachelor doom'd to die, 
So youths be advised and wed while you can— 
" 
There's no time to be lost," say I. 
THE LAST STAGE COACHMAN. 
I'm a 
broken down coachman, and the last on the road, 
And like a 
pincushion, completely up I'm sew'd— 
A1as, ' tis true, the glories of the good old whip are shorn, 
The last guard now has wound his farewell dirge upon 
the horn. 
ctionus. 
Then pity the fate of the last stage coachman, 
And whip out it tear for the poor eoachee. 
A 
victim to the railroads, in me you behold, 
Lor bless you, upon that head I 
could a 
tale unfold— 
With me them devil's ingine have play'd the very deuce. 
Steam used to cook my taters, but now it's cook'd my 
goose. 
Then pity, &c. 
Once I 
was as spruce a 
chap as any three together, 
White tile, white kickseys, fancy coat, and up to my knees 
in leather --
I've parted with each particle—what won't one do for tin ? 
l've even tried to pledge my word— but they doesn't take it 
in. 
Then pity, & c. 
Ten mile an hour was once consider'd quite a 
slapping pace, 
But now they've got you in a 
line, its quite another case— 
To have a 
leg or arm cut off, folks doe.m't care, my flower, 
As long as they can steam away at sixty mile an hour. 
Then pity, 8:e. 
When monarch of the whip I 
was all man could require, 
I 
was greeted with a 
nod from a 
shepherd to a 
squire— 
But now rm xvhipp'd slap-off the road, it's enough to make 
me grizzle, 
I 
used to hold the reins, but now, alas, Pin forced to mizzle. 
Then pity, &e. 
Horses the most useful beasts were thought— or I'm no 
scholar— 
And now to think that steam should throw the poor 
timings out of collar. 
They're going to the dogs post-haste, both piebald, black 
and brown. 
Cat's meat will be looking up, and horse flesh popping 
down. 
Then pity, &c.

THE LAST STAGE COACHMAN.—[CONCLUDED.] 
The view from a 
stage-coach was the finest ever seen, 
The valleys and the sloping hills, likewise the meadows 
green; 
But:now you go along at such a 
flash of lightning speed, 
To expect to see the green fields you must be green indeed. 
Then pity, &e. 
Time good old inns were once the pride of ev'ry country 
town, 
I 
used to run up many a score, but now we're all run 
do wn— 
Time hostlers are all ossified— the  
Stables taken rout, 
Nobody,' goes irul the inns, in fact we're all statv'd out. 
Then pity', & c. 
At a 
crack of my whip, or a 
solo on the horn, 
Some ruddy lace each cottage door or window did adorn— 
The rosy hutaladies or each known inn 1mm east to south, 
Would laugh and wink, but now they laugh the wrong 
side of the mouth. 
Then pity, &c. 
I've di:nivyggollue e, 
your native homes— alt, many a time 
with  
To the parish mansion—my home—they'll werry soon 
drive me— 
To break their stones, or crush their bones, they'll get me 
in a 
line, 
It's evident them railways are daily crushing mine. 
Then pity, &c. 
The coachman's occupation's gone, as sure as eggs is 
ergs— 
My darlin' tits, my four in hand, are quite knocked off 
their legs. 
These arn't the clothes I've got at home, so good folks 
pray be lenient, 
I 
don't say poverty's a 
sin, but it's devilish inconvenient. 
Then pity, & c. 
When T 
thinks on coals and water it gets my steam up 
high, 
If they busts their precious bilers, mind, you wouldn't catch 
me ery— 
I'll do a 
stuninat desperate afore I 
goes mnehfurder, 
I'll fling myself beneath a 
train, and then I'll pull 'em up 
for murder.

And blessed the lucky catch,

I

For at our wedding breakfast, oh I 
She gave the guests a 
treat, 
By seizing me by the hair of my head, 
And lifting me off my feet.— Cuo. 
Instead of walking down the stairs, 
She'll clear the flight at a 
bound, 
Catch hold of me by the tail of my coat,

She throws half-hundred weights about, 
And twirls the Indian club, 
Or balances two chairs and the cat 
On top of the washing-tub.

She does the dumb-bells twice a

In the garden she's fixed a 
high trapeze, 
And a

And there she sports her lovely form,

Going round and round in the air.

THE OLD MAID. 
When I 
was a 
girl ot eighteen years old, 
I 
was scornful as scorntul could be ; 
I 
was taugiit to expect wit, wisdom and gold, 
And nothing less would do for me. 
Those were the days when my eyes beani'd bright, 
And my cheek was like the rose on the tree ; 
And the ringlets—they curl'd o'er my forehead so white, 
And lovers came courting to me. 
The first was a 
youth any girl might adore, 
And as ardent as lover could be; 
But my mother having heard that the young man was poor 
Why ! he would not do for me 
Then came a 
Duke with his coronet of gold, 
And his garter below his knee ; 
But his face like his family was wonderfully old, 
So he would not do for me. 
The next was a 
Baronet, whose blood-red hand 
Was emblazon'd in heraldry ; 
But having been known at a

Then hobbled in my favor to beg, 
An admiral— a

THE OLD MAID.—[CONCLUDED. 
But I 
could not bear the thought of a 
horrid buz-wig 
So he would not do for me. 
Then came a 
lawyer, his claims to support, 
By precedents from chancery; 
But I 
told him I 
was judge in my own little court, 
And he would not do for me. 
The next was a 
dandy, who had driven four in hand, 
Reduced to a 
tilbury; 
In getting o'er the ground he had run through his land, 
So he would not do for me. 
Then came a 
Nabob, just landed six weeks, 
Late Governor of Trincomalee ; 
his sovereigns were yellow but so were his cheeks, 
And he would not do for me. 
He was nearly the last— I

But really I

THE FRENCH BALL. 
As Rung by TONY PASTOR —AIR : " immensiboir.” 
One afternoon, a 
few days since, 
A 
friend did on me call, 
4 Alld handed time a 
ticket for 
The fancy dress French Ball. 
Says he— the fun that we'll have there, 
I 
wouldn't miss at all. 
So come with me, and choose a 
dress, 
To figure at the ball. 
Spoken.— He's a 
gay boy, my friend is : his name is 
Jim 
Muscle. 
He's got plenty of money too. 
He's got a 
steady 
situation as head carver— in a 
coffee and cake saloon. 
Of 
course I 
accepted his invitation to go to 
CHORUS. 
The gay French ball, the gay French ball, 
To see the fun and frolic all, 
A 
ball, a 
ball, a 
ball. 
A gay French ball. 
Oh, what a 
time at the gay French ball. 
The evening came and off we went, 
The gayest pair in town. 
He figured as an Indian chief, 
‘Vhile I 
went as a 
clown. 
We crowded in, the sight I 
saw 
I 
tell you wasn't small, 
A 
thousand couples dancing at 
The jolly, gay French Ball. 
fpoken.— There they were, all sorts of characters, Indians 
fairies, 
harlequins. clowns, pantaloons, pages, demons, 
angels. Black spirits and white, red spirits and gray, all 
mixed up, in one conglomerated concentration. 
There was 
one fellow dressed as (description of the ball.) 
But all were going it at 
The gay French ball, &c. 
A charming creature dressed in blue, 
A sort of Black Crook page,

met, and for to dance with me 
liar hand I 
did engage.

THE FRENCH BALL.—(CONCLUDED. 
We took our places on the floor, 
The leader gave a 
call, 
And the band struck up his Can-can, 
At the fancy, gay French Ball. 
Spoken.—Only think of it, :just as I 
expected to tread the 
light fantastic toe in the mazes of a 
quadrille or lancers, 
or warm up in a 
cheat and jig or Virginia tee, they started 
the Can-can. 
The idea of me dancing the Can-can. My 
partner was a 
French lady, and she had it down fine. 
At 
it we went as well as the rest. 
I 
never danced so hard in 
my life. 
She seemed to fly through the air. 
At last I 
sank 
exhausted. 
The last I 
saw of her she had struck the 
chandelier with her toes, and bounded back like an India 
rubber ball; as for me, I 
started to look for the bar, to re-
cover my senses at 
The gay French Ball, & c. 
A Parley Voo excited came, 
And swore he'd take my life, 
Says he-- Mon Dieu, you know zat you 
have flirted wiz my wife." 
Says I—" Get out you pollywog, 
You can't scare me at all." 
Then off tie hopped just like a 
frog, 
At the fancy, gay French Ball. 
Spokem — The idea of a Frenchman trying to scare one 
of the boys. 
I 
asked him to come in it private box and 
have it out, but he wouldn't fight. 
he took the girl's arm 
and said. " Sacre by gar," half a 
dozen times, and was 
lost in the crowd at 
The gay French Ball, Sze. 
Now ever since that evening, 
has my brain been in a 
whirl. 
My charming Black Crook page I 
see, 
In every pretty girl. 
My thoughts by day, my dreams by night, 
Are on one subject all, 
The Can-can, and dear creatures at 
The tancy, gay French Ball. 
Spoken.—Yes, when I 
retire to my couch at night, reclin-
ing recumbent in sweet repose I 
fancy I 
see all sorts of 
pages in blue, green, red, pink and yellow, floating all 
around me, and one cold, bitter night this week, I 
woke up 
and found myself dancing the Can-can about the floor, 
with the pillows wrapt in my arms, I 
imagined that I 
was 
still at 
The gay French ball, itc.

Now where she lives, and what's her name,

don't intend to tell, 
For certain sure she'd soon be quizzed 
By every noble swell; 
You may See Me on a

The weather it is fine, 
As I 
takes my walk, and on my arm, 
Is the girl what I 
calls " mine."—Cno. 
There's servant-maids, and other maids, 
What's dealers at my store, 
They winks their eye, so I 
winks mine, 
In fun—but nothing more; 
If a 
duchess wished to marry me, 
I'd beg leave to decline, 
I'd rather live on bread and cheese, 
With the girl what I

'Twas on last Sunday afternoon, 
I 
plucked up nerve to pop, 
The question, if she'd have me, and 
My wegebles and shop. 
She didn't say " no," she didn't say " yes," 
But she said she'd " drop a 
line," 
'Cause so very bashful and so shy, 
Is the girl what" calls mine. 
SPOREN.—I 
do believe she'd blush herself to death if anybody'd 
let her; but it's a 
ton of coals to a 
pint of gooseberries she answers 
"yes"; so if the wegebles should go up a 
penny or so, it xvill be 
owing to the matrimonial speculation of this " umble hindiwiddle"

The wind in gentle gales did blow, 
An April s

Not having dar'd to steal a

Which set her quite a-longing.

And view'd each dale so flowery,

When loudly he did bellow, 
"Look here, my love, we can be snug; 
I've brought my umbrella."

Now Simon when he smok'd the plan,

THE CAVALIER. 
Music by CIIARLES W . 
Gwynn.. 
'Twas a 
beautiful night, the stars shone bright. 
And the moon o'er the waters played. 
When a 
cavalier to a 
bower drew near, 
A lady to serenade, 
To tend'rest words he swept the chords, 
And many a 
sigh breathed he; 
While o'er and o'er he fondly swore, 
" 
Sweet maid ! I 
love but thee. 
Sweet maid, sweet maid, sweet maid, I 
love but thee." 
Sweet maid, &C. 
Ho raised his eye to her lattice high, 
While he softly breathed his hopes; 
With amazement lie sees swing about with the breeze, 
All ready a 
ladder of ropes. 
Up, up he has gone. the bird is flown. 
" 
What is this on the ground ?" quoth he; 
"Oh it's plain that she loves, ln.re's some gentleman's gloves, 
She's off, and it's not with me; 
For these gloves, these gloves, they do not belong to me." 
For these gloves, &c. 
Of course, you'd have thought he'd have follow'd and fought, 
As that was a 
duelling age; 
But this gay cavalier, he quite scorned the idea 
Of putting himself in a 
rage. 
More wise by far, lie put up his guitar, 
And as homeward lie went, sling he: 
" 
When a 
lady elopes down a 
ladder of ropes, 
She may go to liong•Rong; for me. 
She may go, she may go, she may go to Itong-Tiong for me." 
She mv,-,y go, Ito.

Sweet walks, and the soft quiet air.

The scent or the newly mown bay :—

CHORUS. 
There are bonnets with ribbons and feathers, 
But mine's like a 
gipsy, so brown. 
A 
bonnet that's careless of weather, 
But happy's the head ' neath its crown. 
The day was intended for labor, 
But night was a 
gift to the heart, 
When neighbor mi! ,lit visit with neighbor, 
And love have his whisper apart,

BOLD ROBIN HOOD. 
Bold Robin Hood was a 
forester good. 
As ever drew bow in the merry green woi ,d; 
For the bugle's shrill ringing-, 
The echoes, the echoes. are singing! 
The wild deer, the wi1 
deer are springing from many a 
wood! 
The summons we'll follow, we'll follow, 
Through brake and hollow. 
We'll follow the summons of bold Robin Hood, 
We'll follow the summons of bold Robin Hood. 
Here is a

lay friar, as good as heart can desire. 
Who absolves all your sins as the case may require 
Who with courage so stout knocks his oak stick about, 
And he puts to tho rout all the foes of his squire. 
Bold Robin Hood, & C. 
What eye bath e'er seen such a 
sweet maidan queen 
As Mary, the pride of the forester green; 
The sweet garden flower that blooms in the bower, 
Where alone to this hour the wild rose bath been. 
We hail tier in duty, the queen of all beauty,— 
We'll live and we'll die by our sweet maiden queen.

And nothinA's heard in modern days, 
But Signoras and Signors: 
Such airs 1

Like a

gate 
Give me the good o'd strain; 
When '
twas merry in the Hall, 
When the beards wag,g'd 
We shall ne'er see the like again, 
We shall ne'er see the like again. 
On beds of down our dandies lay 
And waste the cheerful morn; 
While our squires of old would rouse the day 
To the sound of the bugle horn. 
And their wives took care 
The feast to prepare, 
For when they left the plain, 
Oh! 'twas merry in the Hall 
'When the beards wagg'd all, 
We shall ne'er see the like again, 
We shall ne'er see the like again. 
'Twas then the Christmas tale was told 
Of goblin, ghost or fairy; 
And they cheer'd the hearts of the tenants old 
With a 
cup f 
good Canary. 
And they each took a 
smack 
At the cold black Jack 
Till the fire burnt in their brain. 
Oh! 'twas merry in the Hall, 
When the beards wagg'd all. 
May we soon see the like again, 
May we soon see the like again.

NOTHING. 
Anti—" The Irish Washerwoman." 
When rhyming and verses at first were in fashion, 
And poets and authors indulged in their passion: 
Select what they might for their subject ' twas new, 
And that's more than our modern scribblers can do. 
The ancients have wro:e -upon cacti thing in nature 
Desci 
its variety, genius, a 
ad feature ; 
They having exhausted all fancy could bring, 
And as nothing is left— why of nothing I 
sing. 
CHORUS. 
From nothing we came, and whatever's our station, 
To nothing we owe an immense obligation ; 
What,•Ver we gain or whatever we learn, 
In time we shall all into nothing return. 
This world came from nothing, at least so says history, 
Of coot-se about nothing there's something of mystery ; 
Man came from nothing, and by the same plan. 
Why, woman was trade from the rib of a 
man. 
Since, then, a 
man thinks a 
nothing of taking 
A woman to join, and again his rib making, 
There's nothing can give so much joy to this life, 
Fur nothing's so rare as a 
good-humoned wife. 
From nothing we came, &c. 
Thinking of nothing is some folks' enjoyment, 
Doing of nothing is many's employment : 
The love of this nothing have some folks so strong, 
That they say nothing, do nothing all the day long, 
Some folks do pass their time. aGthing beginning, 
By nothing losing, and by nothing winning; 
Yothing they buy, and nothing t

Nothing tbq know, and of nothing they tell. 
From nothing we came, & e. 
There's something in nothing exceedingly clever, 
For nothing %%II t

Time will make everything fade away fast, 
While nothing will certainly durable last

And nothing I

Thus with this nothing the time oot I'm spinning,

When we all met last Christmas Day, 
Our families and friends so dear, 
Methinks it seems but 3

We joined in the Chrlstmas cheer. 
Once more we've met with joyous hearts, 
To be happy well endeavour, 
And pledge the " Queen," with all our hearts, 
Now we have me together. 
Since we have met, merry, merry met, 
Since we have met together; 
Long may we live to meet again, 
In health and wealth together. 
In childhood we can ne'er forget, 
Those happy days gone by, 
When under the mistletoe we did get 
Our sweethearts, now our wives. 
And when the merry dance bean, 
We mingled all together, 
With joyful hearts each song was sung, 
When we all met together. 
Since we have met, ch. 
There's gladness in remembrance still, 
Our friendship has been true ; 
The loving cup to you now we fill, 
Before we bid you adieu. 
And may we nice next Christmas Day,

In health and happiness we all pray 
We may meet again together.

If you civilly spike 
how d'ye do, Paddy Blake, 
The echo politely says very well, thank you. 
One day Teddy Keogh 
With Kate Connor did go, 
To hear from the echo this wandarful talk, sir, 
But the echo they say 
Was conthrairy that day, 
Or, perhaps, Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, sir. 
Now, says Teddy to Kate, 
Tis too bard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout 
To each other no doubt 
We'll make up an (, cho bewcen us, my daisy. 
Now Kitty says Teddy, 
To answer 
Oh, very well thank you, cries out-Kitty then, 
Would you like to be wed 
Kitt v 
darling, says Ted, 
Oh, very well thank you, says Kitty again, sir 
Do you like me, says Teddy, 
And Kitty quite ready, 
Cried, very well thank you, with laughter beguiling, 
think you'll confess 
Teddy could not do less 
Than pay his resp cts to the lips that were smiHng 
Oh, dear Paddy Blake, 
May you never f 
rsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing; 
And ma 
girls all translate 
Their answers like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubting, no treachery fearing. 
And boys be yon ready 
Like frolicsome Teddy, 
Be earnest in loving, though given to joking, 
And thus when inclined 
May all true lovers find 
Sweet echoes to answer from hearts they're invoking. 
Get the Best! Get the Best!
