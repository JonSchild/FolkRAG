Ben RiceThe Boston BurglarI was born in Boston CityA place you all know wellBrought up by honest
parentsThe truth to you I'll tellBrought up by honest parentsAnd raised most tenderly'Til I attained
my sporting mantAt the age of twenty-threeMy character was takenAnd I was sent to jailMy parents
tried to get me outBut nothing could availThe jury found me guiltyThe clerk he wrote dtwdownThe
judge pronounces my sentenceYou're bound for Charlestown.I seen my aged fatherA-pleading at
the barLikewise my aged motherA-tearing out her hairA-tearing out her old gray locksTill the tears
came rolling downOh son, dear son, what have you doneYou're off to Charlestown.I got on board
the village bound trainOne cold December dayAnd every station I went throughI heart the people
say"There goes that noted burglarIn strong irons he is boundFor some crime or other he's off to
Charlestown.In Boston City there lives a girlIt's one who I love wellIf ever I gain my libertyAt home
with her I'll dwellIf ever I gain my freedomBad company I will shunLikewise the street walking?And
drinking up a drum. ?Come, all you who got your livertyPray keep it while you canfor whey you take
your walks at nightDon't break the laws of manFor if you do you're sure to rueAnd find yourself like
meTo serve a term of twelve long yearsIn the penitentiary.
