The pride and joy of all of us 
Has got a 
nice front tooth. 
George,

Now married men take my advice, 
When first you do get wed, 
Don't ever try to go to sleep. 
Don't ever go to bed: 
But save yourself from trouble 
With the darling little pet, 
Don't wait until it gets a 
tooth, 
Buy it a 
nice false set.

If you listen to me

And when I 
feel better 
I 
never feel worse; 
Some people do say 
That I 
was born young; 
And if I 
am shot 
I 
will never be hung. 
There was a 
young woman 
Prom Kalamazoo, 
Her eyes they were blonde 
And her hair it was blue; 
She'd a 
voice like a 
saw- mill, 
A head like a 
calf, 
And when she was crying 
She never would laugh. 
There was a 
young man 
From Brooklyn town, 
And when he was standing 
He'd never sit down;

He would have been black,

Once he hired two Chinamen to blast

A ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES . 
Originally sung by the swell comedians, NILES AND EVANS. 
Air—Blue Alsatian Mountains. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair; 
Iler papa wore the trouses 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Sonic family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and eowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing! 
Ilust to hear that maiden sing. 
Oh. lie spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chick ens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy; 
So she called, her yaller dog. 
Hurra! hurra: hurra! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses 
For the dog to chew that day.

THE MARRIAGE OF DENNIS O'GRADY. 
Written by JOHN T. KELLY. 
Expressly for HARRY KERNELL. 
MY 
name is Dennis O'Grady, 
Some people call me Dau; 
My face, will plainly show, 
That Pin a 
German man. 
By trade an undertaker, 
Of business very sad, 
But I'm not like my trade 
For I'm a 
lively lad ! 
To-night I'm nearly crazy, 
As you may understand; 
To-morrow I'm to join 
The matrimonial baud. 
The pride of Baxter Street, 
A 
charmer, be your life, 
To-morrow makes Kitty Burns 
Dennis Grady's wife. 
CHORUS. 
We'll start at two, policemen Meek, 
With his big club will drive them back, 
There to the church in Sullivan's hack, 
"There get married and come right back. 
THE MARRIAGE OF DENNIS O'GRADY! • 
Continued. 
Then all the neighbors to the house will pack. 
Of gin and whiskey take a 
smack, 
Jigs and reels the ceiling will crack, 
At the marriage of Dennis O'Grady. 
We'll have the finest table, 
That ever yet was spread, 
We'll have three nigger waiters, 
And I'll sit at the bead. 
We'll have our gin and whiskey, 
Wine and sarsaparilla, 
The first man that makes a 
muss, 
I'll busted him in the smeller. 
I'll hire Johnny Mulligan, 
And his string band, 
Paddy Doyle, the fifer, 
The finest in the land, 
I'll invite all my friends, 
Now mind you what I 
say, 
I'll raise the very divil 
Upon my wedding day. 
We'll start at two, ete. 
i'Vribten by ED FREscn expressly for N ILES AND EVANS 
With great delight, the other night, 
I 
went to ' tend a 
raffle 
Pot- an eight-day balloon and an old bassoon; 
My heart was all aglow. 
There were crooked-ear'd girl and flat- nose boys, 
With sisters, and cousins, and aunts, 
All trying to flirt with a 
gay young clerk, 
Who wore the seal-skin pants. 
Cnouus. 
He wore the pants—the seal skin pants— 
This pirate of Penzance; 
They all fell in love with this dizzy young cove, 
Who wore the seal-skin pants. 
There was pitchers of beer, for each one there, 
To make them feel so friskey; 
some drank ale, from an old tin pail, 
While others they drank whiskey. 
While doing the grand in a 
Boston dip 
He put all the girls in a 
trance; 
They muzzled his snout, and his eye fell out— 
The bloke in the seal- skin pants. 
CHORUS. 
As quick as slick, he was hit with a 
brick, 
When he left all the girls, in the dance, 
With a 
base-ball club, he was knocked in a 
tub, 
That settled his seal-skin pants. 
I AM LITTLE, BUT YOU BET THAT I CAN 
DANCE. 
Copyright secured 1879. 
Written by ANDY HUGHES, for LITTLE ROSEBUD, and sung by bee 
with unbounded applause. 
No doubt you look at me 
As my tiny form you see, 
And think that I 
am very, very small ; 
But yet, despite my size. 
I 
will make you ope your eyes, 
And I 
hope for an encore you will call. 
I 
will now tell to you 
how it was I 
never grew, 
If you will only give me but a 
chance; 
And when I'm done you'll see 
You will all agree with me 
I'm little, but you bet that I 
can dance. 
(Dance) 
I 
used to watch the boys 
Dance around and make a 
noise, 
I 
used to try and beat the very best, 
And with my little jig 
I 
made a 
hit so big 
That they said I 
was the boss of all the rest 
I 
come here every night, 
When I 
see your eyes so bright, 
For I 
delight around the stage to prance, 
And when I'm done you see 
You will all agree with me, 
I'm little, but you bet that I 
can dance. 
REED'S MEDLEY. 
N.adly I 
wander up and down the street, 
Asking a 
house and lot from every one I 
meet; 
No one seems to know me, or care which way I 
go, 
Since I've been elected mayor, lam turned :aft in the 
SHOW. — 
Only a 
house to let, unfurnished, and quite new, 
With a 
patent electric skylight, 
So the rain can conic right through; 
But while life does remain 
You'll find I'm no sardane, 
For this house to let unfurnished and— 
" 
Oh! Fred, tell 'em to stop,' 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa! 
They said let her go— 
And the reason why she didn't went 
Was all on account of Eliza. 
I lost my umberella sometime in Lent, 
All on account of— 
Love, love, love, the first-born of creation; 
Love, love, love, the pride of every nation; 
Love, love, love, in this and every station; 
The ruler of the universe is— 
The man whose a 
friend when he's wanted, indeed, 
No matter on sea or on land; 
There's one thing above all others I 
like, 
It's the grasp of an honest hand.

tspoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove. 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love. 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to knowl 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
/Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shOUT 
CHORUS. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, Ill tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie for shame, Yah! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We wandeed through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought fro m  vul
gar 
people 
there, we should at least be free, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear, 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
',let just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
My Mat,' Ann declared to me she knew those people not, • 
in fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious illystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voiee came down the staircase, and her little brother cried—

Oh. ver

Little empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden it has fled. 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair, 
Peeping from thy tiny snow-white bed, 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigiti 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
CHORUS. 
Baby left her cradle for the golden shore, 
O'er the silv'ry waters she has flown, 
Gone to join the angels peaceful ever more, 
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound, 
Ugderneath my little darling sleeps. 
Blossoms sweet, and roses cluster all around i 
Over head the willow silent weeps.

And my heart doth sadly moan,

OH, 
FILM ! 
TELL THEM TO STOP. 
As sung by Coot BURGESS. 
No doubt you L 
xve heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to iake place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl theta 
To pass a 
duh hour away. 
We went in you must know a-kd saw Barnum's Great 
Show, 
Van Amburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were rowadabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, when we got to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I 
said: 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; but 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
out: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laugheit 
But I 
only said stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
'Twas then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Fred! eta. 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which- soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN.— Mark now, before you get into tho 
swing's boat, make a 
bargain with your young lady

A TRAMP. 
(A RECITATION.) 
As Meshed Iky CsAsurs BURKE, of CAMPBELL & Btriuts. with red 
success. 
Lemmt sit down a

stone's got in my shoe; 
Dont you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin'

Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it? 
Folks say we ain't 
no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't 
think we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash 
and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—.Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen, 
Beaux? Why she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near 
and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, gone of 'ern suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled fig-in that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young 
gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor 
young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her moth-
er's side, 
Fill'd with a 
raging fever—she fell at my 
feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took 
to drink. 
eimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way-
I'll tramp ' till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 'till

There is a 
great sensation, about 
word you hear 
nowadays, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's about going to the 
Matinees; 
You can hear them say to each other, when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the 
mat this aff?" 
CHORUS. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" "Not this aff,

I 
went with her a

left her on Broad-

And the time that we were parting, she winked at 
me and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going 
to the mat this aff?" 
"Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know

ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
By SOPHIE P. 
SNOW. 
Recited during the holidays by HARRY BRUNO. 
Published by request. 
'Twas the eve before Christmas, " good night" had 
been said, 
And Annie and Willie had crept into bed; 
There were tears on their pillows and tears in their 
eyes, 
And each little bosom was heaving with sighs; 
For to-night their stern father's command had been 
given 
That they should retire precisely at seven— 
Instead of eight—for they troubled him more 
With questions unheard of than ever before. 
He told them he thought this delusion a 
sin— 
No such person as " Santa Clan s" ever had been— 
And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear 
Bow he scrambled down chimneys with presents 
each year. 
And this was the reason that two little heads 
So restlessly tossed on their soft, downy beds. 
Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten; 
Not a 
word had been spoken by either till then, 
When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep 
As he whispered: " Dear Annie, is 'ou fas' asleep?" 
" 
Why, no, BrOther Willie," a 
sweet voice replies; 
" 
I've long tried in vain, but I 
can't shut my eyes, 
For somehow it makes me so sorry because 
Dear papa has said there is no Santa Claus. 
Now, we know there is, and it can't be denied 
For he came every year before mamma died; 
But, then, l've been thinking that she used to pray, 
And God would hear everything mamma would say, 
And maybe she asked Him to send Santa Claus here 
With the sack full of presents he brought every year." 
"Well, why tan't we pray dust as mamma did den, 
And ask Dot to send him with presents aden?" 
"I've been thinking so too," and without a word 
m 
ore 
Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor, 
ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Continued.) 
And four little knees the soft carpet pressed. 
And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast. 
" 
Now. Willie, you know that we must firmly believe 
That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive; 
You must wait just as still 
till I 
say the 
Amen,' 
And by that you will know that your turn has come. 
then. 
Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me, 
And grant us the favor we a-re asking of Thee. 
I 
want a 
wax dolly, a 
tea- set and ring, 
And an ebony work- box that shuts with a 
spring. 
Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see 
That Santa Claus loves us as much as does he: 
Don't let him get fretful and angry again 
At dear Brother Willie and Annie. 
Amen." 
"Please, Deesus, let Santa Taus turn down to-night, 
And bring us some presents before it is light; 
I 
want he should div me a 
nice Ittle sed, 
With bright shining 'unners, and all painted red; 
A box full of tandy, a 
book and a 
toy. 
Amen, and den, Deesus, I'll be a 
dood boy." 
Their prayers being ended, they raised up their 
heads, 
And, with hearts light and cheerful, again sought 
their beds. 
They were soon lost in shunber both peaceful and 
deep, , 
And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep. 
Eight, nine, and the little French clock had struck 
ten 
Ere the father had thought of his children again. 
He seems now to hear Annie's half-suppressed sighs, 
And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes. 
"I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said, 
" 
And should not have sent them so early to bed; 
But then I 
was troubled; my feelings found vent, 
For bank- stock to-day has gone down ten per cent; 
But of course they've forgotten their troubles ere this, 
'ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Concluded.) 
"I'm floppier to-night than I've been for a 
ycar. 
I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before— 
What care I 
if bank-stock falls ten per. cent more? 
Hereafter I'll make it a 
rule, I 
believe, 
To have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas-eve.' 
So thinking, he gently extinguished the light, 
And tripping down stairs, he retired for the night. 
As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun 
Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one, 
Four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide, 
And, at the same moment, the presents espied: 
Then out of their beds they sprang with a 
bound, 
And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found. 
They laughed and they cried, in their innocent glee, 
And shouted for papa to come quick and see 
What presents old Santa Claus brought in the night 
(Just the thins that they wanted), and left before 
light. 
" 
And now," added Annie in voice soft and low, 
"You'll believe there's a' Santa Claus,' papa, I 
know ;" 
While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee, 
Determined no secret between them should be, 
And told in soft whispers how Annie had said 
That their dear, blessed mamma, so long ago dead, 
Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair, 
And that God up in heaven had answered her prayer. 
"Den we dot up and prayed dust as well as we tood; 
And Dod answered our prayers; now, wasn't He 
dood?" 
" 
I 
should say that He was if lie sent you all these, 
And knew just what presents my children would 
please. 
(Well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf; 
'Twould be cruel to tell him I 
did it myself.") 
Blind father! Who caused your stern heart to relent, 
And the hasty words spoken so soon to repent? 
'Twas the Being who bade you steal softly up stairs, 
And .
ade you His agent to answer their prayers. 
ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Continued.) 
And that I 
denied them the thrice-asked-for kiss; 
And, just to make sure, I'll steal up to the door, 
never spoke harsh to my darlings before.' 
:-;o 
saying, he softly ascended the stairs, 
And arrived at the door to I 
war both of their prayers., 
Ili., Annie's " Bless papal - drew forth the big tears, 
And Willie's grave promise fell sweet on his ears. 
" 
Strange—strange- 1'd forgotten," said he with a 
sigh, 
" 
flow I longed when a child to have Christmas 
draw nigh. 
I'll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said, 
'• By answering their prayer ere I 
sleep in my bed." 
Then turned to the stairs and softly went down, 
Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing gown, 
Donned hat, coat and boots, and was out in the 
streets, 
A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet! 
or stopped he until lie had bought everything, 
From the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring; 
Indeed, he kept adding so much to his store 
That the various presents outnumbered a 
score; 
f1111 homeward he turned, when his holiday load, 
With Aunt Mary's help in the nursery was sto wed, 
Miss Dolly was seated beneath a 
pine tree, 
By the side of a 
table spread out for her tea; 
A work- box well filled in the centre was laid, 
Arid on it the ring for which An: 
had prayed; 
A 
soldier in uniform stood by a 
sled, 
With bright shining runners, and all painted red;" 
There were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to 
see, 
And birds of all colors were perched hi the tree; 
While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top, 
As if getting ready more presents to drop. 
And, as the fond father the picture surveyed, 
lie thought for his trouble he had amply been paid; 
And he said to himself as he brushed off a 
tear:

BLOW THE CANDLE OUT. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
I've just got wedded to a 
darling wife, 
We're, jolly as can be; 
There's only one thing causes strife 
On which we never agree. 
For now and then, like the best of men, 
I 
go out in a 
jovial way, 
And as sure as fate, if l' in home late, 
I 
hear the missus say: 
SPOKEN. —" ! there you are at last. 
Whatever 
makes you so late? Now, do be careful with that 
candle." 
You see, my wife can't sleep with the can-
dle alight., and I 
can't sleep in the dark, so disputes 
are always arising when she says: 
CHORUS. 
Blow the candle out, John, blow the candle out, 
How late you are— you know you are, 
Now, mind what you're about, John. 
Blow the cat idle out. Jolut. blow the candle out, 
Now mind you do, what I 
tell you to, 
And blow the candle out. 
When I 
get out for an hour or so, 
The time runs on so fast, 
'Tis time to go before I 
know 
The jolly night has passed. 
Up stairs I 
creep, she's fast asleep, 
I 
think I 
hear her snore, 
But, sad mistake, she's wide awake, 
And says to me once more: 
SPOKEN. —" Here's a nice tune to come home to 
your wife. 
I 
can't think what sort of company you. 
keep! What do you say? You won't put out the light? 
t 
lo vou expect me to get up and do it, you selfish 
tuar:. Now, John, I 
insist that you— 
Blow the candle 
(Concluded.) 
At one or two—it may be three— 
I 
quit the festive scene, 
And then my Sue will say to me, 
Now tell me where you've been. 
You're home so late in such a state, 
You're not yourself I 
vow, 
how strange you talk, how queer you walk, 
You really don't know how. . 
SPOKHN. —" You don't know how to walk across 
the room, sir. 
Ali! you thought if you took off your 
boots down stairs and left them on the 'mat, that I 
should not know what time you got home. 
But I'm 
not such a fool as you take me for, John, though, 
goodness knows, I 
was fool enough when I 
took you. 
Now, John, I 
tell you, onae for all, I , will not sleep 
until yon— 
I 
often say in a 
sleepy way, 
I'm tired and fzeel so queer, 
That if you want the light put out, 
Do it yourself, my dear. 
But that's no use, she plays the deuce 
Whenever 
late at night. 
Be quiet ! die 
:; 0 sleep I 
don't, 
Till I've nut out the light. 
SPORI2X. — She always gets the best of the argu-
ment. 
She says: " Blow it out now." 
I 
say-, " 
sha'n't! The candle be Wowed." " Ah!" says she, 
"there's language to use to your wife; it's scandalous. 
I 
will not put up with it; either the eatelle goes out', 
or I. 
So, John, if you care for me at all, you will—

DON'T CALL IN THE MORNING, 
Written, composed and sung by L. C. DUNBAR. 
itusle published by E. H. HARDING, 2'2) Bowery. New York. 
tirwes at an evening party where I 
first met :dilly Green, 
And thought she was the sweetest girl that I 
had ever seen; 
I 
soug-R an introduction which I 
happily did obtain, 
And in nearly all the dances I 
her little hand did gain. 
And when the time for breaking up the party did arrive, 
To see this little damsel home somehow I 
did contrive; 
But ere we parted at the door I 
boldly asked if I 
Might call and see her sometime when she gave me this reply. 
CHORUS. 
Don't come in the morning, for that will be too soon, 
And never call to see me in the afternoon; 
Don't come in the evening and never call at night, 
I3ut call at any other time and then you'll be all right. 
So strange an answer really I 
could not make out at all, 
Unless it was a 
gentle hint that I 
must never call; 
And yet I 
did not think she could treat me so unkind, 
For somehow she to favor me appeared to be inclined. 
So once again I 
asked her, but the answer was the same; 
And at that very- moment to the door the servant came. 
Good-night, she said and vanished, did this darling little dear, 
And kept me standing with an answc,r 
ringing in my ear: 
Don't come in the morning, etc. 
I 
strolled along and wandere.d what the dickens could she mean 
As all night long X 
dreamt about that darling little queen; 
BuGmore her answer came to me, which seemed to be absurd; 
But in the morning when I 
woke a 
happy thought occurred. 
She said if I 
would call at any time I 
should be all right, 
Except the morning, afternoon, the evening or at night; 
Any time that I 
could call Was neither late nor soon; 
Of course you all have guessed by now she never more will 
say; 
Don't come in the morning, etc.

We're not surprised to see you stare, 
Upon our neat-array 
Of dandy colored gentlemen 
Employed upon Broadway. 
We never lose our dignity, 
Though jingling plates of hash, 
We never could associate 
With common colored trash. 
CHORUS. 
We hear de gong a 
sounding, we hear the steward call; 
Now all the figs are ready for a 
slide into the hall ! 
Oh! flourish all de napkins, he sure to take your place, 
And skip around de tables with arist,ocratic grace. 
Take this 
mman's order, bring a 
glass of water, 
Soup and fich on separate dish, the steward's in a 
flutter. 
Ah, here comes a 
stranger, a 
hay-seed and a 
granger, 
Slightly stoop, and spill the soup, and grease him wid 
de butter. 
Polite attention to the man, 
That puts beneath his plate 
A 
dollar bill to make us prompt, 
Such folks will never wait. 
We'll smother him in luxuries, 
And eagerly prepare 
To order ev'ry dainty dish 
Dat's on de bill of fare. 
in summer time we wend our way, 
To Saratoga Springs, 
And answer ev'ry bell and call, 
For money that it brings. 
But white folks have to wait on ws 
In winter when we're grand, 
And travel like aristocrats, 
With a 
cclored minstrel band.

" 
The fisherman and his child are drowned I" 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide. 
And friends did mourn around. 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
" 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see." 
(Repeut lost two tines.) 
'Twas the voice of their Cod that they heard, 
As they sank in the deep: 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul HI keep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep." 
the fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
lit- battled the waves with all human power. 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
lie cried in de- air: " Thy win be done!" 
The child he loved wa• dead. 
(Repeut hi -t 
two lines.) 
And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore; 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their fitces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had olotsped his tqiild, 
In death they fouryl him ther..

charming retreat, - 
Where I 
have been lately residing, 
With everything cosey and neat. 
My neighbors are sweet and confiding; 
It's furnished in elegant style, 
Rich carpets and soft Turkish mats— 
And now I 
have something to tell you 
Of the people who live in French Flats. 
CHORUS, 
French Flats are charming retreats, 
For beautiful belles, for elegant swells; 
French Flats are charming retreats, 
But, oh, they would never suit me. 
There's an old Yankee lady from Maine, 
Who lives with her dear married daughter, 
All day you will hear her complain, 
Of the smoke, and the gas, and the water; 
There's an old maid who keeps herself jolly, 
With parrots, and poodles, and cats; 
And a 
barber, with eye melancholy, 
May be found in those fancy French Flats. 
There's an actor of fame and renown, 
Who practices terrible pieces ;

Can be heard up the WE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.

For opening some other man's door, 
And then be thrown over the RAILING;

Now there's a

The folks are going to dine; 
I

With all her might and main; 
And there's a

Who glances at the train; 
Oh! there's a

And a 
lady seems to play, 
While near her hangs a 
little bird, 
To sing its merry lay. 
Riding on the Elevated Railroad, etc. 
Oh! here's a 
woman holding up 
A baby very small; 
And yonder sits a 
tailor, 
With his back against the wall; 
While just beside, two idle men 
Are seated, playing cards; 
And people here are drinking beer, 
With " mutual regards." 
Riding on the Elevated Railroad, etc. 
I 
see a 
picture of distress— 
A barely furnished room; 
Three little ragged children, 
With their faces full of gloom. 
So many and so varied 
Are the sights that come to view, 
I'm sure I'd try your patience, 
If I 
told them all to you.

THE LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Music published, and Copyright, 1e79, by J. 
CHURCH & CO. words 
by Wm. CARLETON. 
Music by J. K. EMMET and sung by him in " Fritz in Ireland." 
Three little leaves of IriAh green, 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above. 
Cimitus. 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there. 
And liked the soil so well, 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc. 
To thee I 
give'the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc.

Sung by C. P.

I've a 
nice little house built on Harlem Flats, 
Things cosy you always find there, 
I 
have acres of land and men at my command, 
And I 
have always a 
dollar to spare; 
Oh, I 
didn't come here in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk down the street, people say that I 
meet, 
There's a man you don't see every day.

Then call for your glasses and hava what you want, 
And whatever's the damage I11 pay, 
Boys, be aisy and free, when your drinking with me, 
For I'm the man you don't see eve•ry day. 
When I 
landed in America what a 
sight met my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore, 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGtqrk, 
And around two or three dozen more; 
Oh murther, you ought to have seen them all start, 
And then they did all run away, 
Says I, " My spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because 
a 
man you don't see every day?" 
Then call for your glastses, etc.

will pay; 
And I

Who then will be able to say, 
To my friends roundabout, while pointing me out, 
There's the man you don't see every day.

Hang the blessed cradle, nearly every night, 
Just as I 
get into my first snore; 
Twinses with the quinses wake me in a 
fright, 
Keep me up till half-past three or four. 
Mother sleeps in comfort, says she knows that dad, 
Sees her little chicks don't come to hurt. 
But, poor me! the father, I 
get cold and mad, 
In my cradle costume—that's a 
shirt. 
CHORUS. 
Never empty cradle, baby's in galore, 
Bachelors against it I 
would warn 
If you wed your angel you'll find it a 
bore, 
When you rock the cradle in the morn. 
Who would be a 
father when he knows the price, 
Sees how soon the punishment begins? 
Half a 
dozen times I've been a 
father twice— 
Half a 
dozen pair of healthystwins. 
All my pieces spent and all my peace is gone, 
All my friends now look on me with scorn, 
Say there is no reason in such goings on, 
Worn out is the cradle—twins are born. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle, both are in a 
roar, 
Aroarer early morning to adorn, 
They make pretty angels, never sure. before 
Were such little cusses ever born.

THE SEVENTH REGIMENT. 
Words and Music by HARRY SAXTON, sung wadi great success by 
311E8 LIDA GARDNER. 
March songs are now sung by every one upon the 
stage; 
Good, bad, we must have them, for those songs are 
all the rage. 
Now, I 
have a 
new one, I'm sure that it will please a 
few, 
Of our greatest regiment out on the Grand Review. 
In their flashy uniforms, the finest in the land, 
Just fitting every man and cut by a 
tidy hand. 
Their rifles are so bright, they look like they were 
ne 
NV, 
Just go and see the Seventh when they go out on 
Grand Review. 
CHORUS. 
As they march along so proud. 
They are sure to catch a 
crowd 
And from windows high you're sure to 
A lady fair or two. 
As the band begins to play, 
-You're sure to hear them say, 
They're the finest men I 
ever saw 
Out on the Grand Review. 
Once more we see them now, every man looks just 
as one. 
This is the way, boys, au good drilling must be done; 
They march off by p;atoons, there is no stagger, 
break, or pause. 
Now the crowd cannot keep still, they must give 
loud applause. 
Right face! Forward! .‘ farch: 
Now every man's on 
tune, 
No waver in the line, 
Now, wasn't that done fine:" 
Says a stranger to his friend, now they deserve the 
blue, 
For they're the finest men I 
ever saw out on the 
Grin 
Review.

SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. W. FRENCH. 
Music by T. B. KELLEY. 
As sung by Ca,kaLss DIAMOND. 
The pet of the girls everywhere, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls; 
Nonsense now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
CHORUS. 
Something to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spooney and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores. 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some li,fiov.-s 
are shy, and (.t 
hers they try, 
To please when as crabbed as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
Sonwthing to tickle, etc. 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their frien d, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls.

Ye may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and

I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go, 
And be a bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and freer 
in the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of

They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a

We mareh'd unto the right and left, until me feet 
were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkard Squad."

" 
Lift! lift!" the sargint used to say, 
" 
Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it? 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! Shoulder arms!" 
An hour every day, 
Whi1 we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very diffikilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paradin' in the hall; 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint be would 
say: 
"Yer as awkard as the divil: doan't ye hould yer 
gun that way!" 
Whine'er he'd bpake an ordhr, but egad! 'twas wid 
a 
vim; 
I 
often wished, upon my soul, \4

head on him, 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was 
very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad."

Whin out into the strate we go to have a foine

I'll have 'em marchin' ivery day, or earryin' the hod, 
For being so Inkeivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk,

WALTZING FOR A PRIZE. 
Am.—Raffle for the Stove. 
Written by Jam EDWIN expressly for the Only FRANK BUSH. 
Last Wednesday I 
got married to Rachel Bloomen-
stein ; 
Her father keeps in Hester Street a 
school-house for 
de blind. 
It was there we were united by Alderman Isaac Wise, 
Who vas full of fun—de son-of-a-gun—while waltzing 
for de prize. 
CuoRus. 
Right and left all chte•Asay! der leader he vould cry; 
Yen de Sheeny's all for more would bawl, to hear 
them you you'd die, 
It was better than a 
circus to look at Jakey Strauss. 
Who danced the Hebrew fashion, and thought he'd 
carry the house. 
There vas about a 
hundred, a-vaiting for to dance. 
But the old man he stepped out, and said dat he must 
have a 
chance. 
So I 
vent and got him a 
partner, a 
girl about that size, 
Who valkedall over Bloomenstein, vile dancing for de 
prize. 
Right and left, etc. 
Ven de old man saw dat he vas st ttek, he told her to 
sit down; 
And said he'd dance vit her no more, for he lost near 
twentw pound; 
It's then she got insulted, and the tears came in her 
eyes, 
For she thought that she and Bloomenstein would 
surely win de prize.
