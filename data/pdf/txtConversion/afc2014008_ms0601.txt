cra1 Culture:  A Sense of Place With A Sense of Direction
 
Thank you for inviting me to speak at this conference.
 It gives me
 
great pleasure to visit Maine again.
 I have had the opportunity to
 
spend time  in Maine on several previous occasions and I am a big
 
fan of the work of Denny Wilson, Peter Simmons and Kathleen Mundell
 
at the Maine Arts Commission.  Their work in developing programs at
 
the  Commission,  sensitive  to  the  needs  and  reflective  of  the
 
deeply-rooted identity of local culture truly serves as a model for
 
us  at  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  and  for  state  arts
 
councils around the country.
 
And what an embarrassment of riches you have here in Maine.
 Your
 
traditional arts are as abundant and as varied as the spectacular
 
`aii  c
c,?ors  that  we  see  out  the  window,  _
 
�-
American fiddling and ballads in the Lewiston area as well as the
 
St.  John's  River  Valley,  Scandinavian  needlework  of  the  north,
 
Cambodian music and dance in the Portland area, Yankee storytelling
 
and  quilting,
 the  basketmaking  tradtions  of  the  Micmac,  the
 
Passamaquoddy,  the  Maliseet  and  the  Penobscot,  and  the  strong
 
maritime
 traditions
 of
 the
 coast
 which
 include
 skills
 at
 
constructing boats and models of boats.
 You also are blessed with
 
many fine workers in the field at the local level - Bau Graves and
 
Phyllis O'Neill  at Portland Performing Arts,  Theresa Hoffman who
 
works  with  the  Maine  Indian  Basketmakers,
 Sandy  Ives  at  the
 
University of Maine,  and Nick Hawes and Lisa Ornstein working at
 
Ft.  Kent.
 
I feel that I should be coming to visit you to learn about how you
 
do  things  here,  rather  than  rising  to  speak  to  you.
 My  folks
 
always told me that you really can't learn very much by listening
 
to yourself speak.
 
I think  I will  frame this  story by describing  several  different
 
trips taken by several individuals to Maine.
 The first is a trip
 
2
 
that  I took  in  1974.
 On  that  occasion  I was  accompanying  a
 
fiddler,  from a Franco-American community in Missouri not far from
 
where  I grew up,  on a musical  tour  of  French-American musicians
 
throughout New England.  This rather extraordinary gentleman was in
 
his 70's and had really never been out of Missouri.
 He lived near
 
Old Mines,  a small community of descendants of French miners who
 
had come to this region in the early 1700's in search of silver but
 
who instead found lead.
 Thus it was called the Lead Belt.
 These
 
people,  living in what could still best be described as villages in
 
a rather  isolated area of the state,  had maintained their French
 
language,  foodways,  music and craft for well over 250 years with
 
little attention from their Anglo and German neighbors and unlike
 
Louisiana  or Maine,  with very  few new  immigrants  from  France  or
 
French  Canada  after  their  settlement.
 This  fiddler,  named  Joe
 
Po? 1
 t t P . Wac
 r
ef
 members of this community who was bor-
to parents who spoke only French.  As a result, he was often teased
 
by other children because he could not speak English when he got to
 
school.
 Through the course of his life Joe had developed a rather
 
tough shell.
 He used to dip his hands in turpentine to toughen up
 
his fingers to play the fiddle.
 Joe was an exquisite fiddler and
 
the  possessor  of  a seemingly  endless  repertoire  of  fiddle  tunes
 
that no other fiddler in the community remembered.
 
I hadn't  planned  on  a trip  to  New  England  on  that  particular
 
occasion, but when it came time to drive Joe and his accompanist to
 
the St. Louis airport, Joe decided that he didn't want to get on an
 
airplane,  so I ended up driving him half way across the country to
 
Vermont,  the point  of  embarkation  for  the tour.
 The  tour wound
 
through Vermont,  New Hampshire and ended in Maine.
 On that tour,
 
which  included cajun musicians,  New England  Franco-Americans and
 
French Canadians,  Joe dazzled audiences with his superb fiddling.
 
As we caravanned along on our tour,  Joe seemed rather unfazed by
 
all of the beautiful scenery - we'd point out Lake Champlain,  the
 
Green Mountains,  the White Mountains and the Maine coast but the
 
most response that we ever got out of Joe was a brief glance out
 
3
 
the window and perhaps a nod.
 
After we finished our last performance in Biddeford, Maine, we set
 
out for the return drive to Missouri.
 Julia,  the accompanist,  and
 
I decided that we would take the northern route home and swing by
 
Niagara Falls.
 Neither of us had seen this wonder of the world and
 
we thought that maybe Joe would enjoy seeing it.
 After a daylong
 
drive we pulled into Niagara Falls just as the sun was beginning to
 
set but we couldn't find a place to park close by,  so we parked on
 
a side street and invited Joe to walk with us to get a view of the
 
falls.
 Even with special pleading,  we couldn't convince Joe that
 
the experience of seeing Niagara Falls shouldn't be missed.
 So,
 
a  bit  out  of  sorts,
 but  determined  to  enjoy  the  experience
 
ourselves,  Julia  and  I walked  to  the  overlook  to  take  in  the
 
panorama. After a time g
yp  ratn rn aa  +
-n t1, 4  r
,;4 r  i A:
 the near darkness,
 
and not to be defeated by Joe's obstinacy,  we decided to try and
 
pull the car close to the falls so that he could see it through the
 
window.  We were lucky enough to find a parking place at this point
 
near the overlook,  and by now the falls were fully illuminated and
 
a breathtaking sight.
 We said,  "Joe,  there's Niagara Falls."
 He
 
glanced over for a brief moment and turned back to say:
 "Yeah, we
 
have one of those back in the Lead Belt."  After a pause he added:
 
The one back home is a little bit smaller though."
 
I couldn't really argue with Joe about that.
 In fact  it sort of
 
brought home a certain difference in perspective that had been lost
 
on me up to that point.  We certainly didn't bring to Niagara Falls
 
the same point of view.
 I'm not sure that a short speech on local
 
culture
 is  capable  of  capturing  all  of  the  nuances  of  the
 
differences  in perspective of  localized situations.
 Perhaps the
 
best  I can hope  for  is that you might come away  from  it saying:
 
"Yeah,  we have one of those back home."
 
I turn now to another trip to Maine.
 I was engaging in my all too
 
infrequent straightening up of the office this past summer - I do
 
4
 
it every couple of years whether it needs  it or not - when I ran
 
across  a memo  written  by  Bess  Lomax  Hawes,  the  founder  of  and
 
moving  spirit  behind the  Folk  & Traditional Arts  Program at the
 
NEA, to Nancy Hanks, the second Chairman and guiding spirit for the
 
development  of  NEA  in  its  growth years.
 Oh  the  good  old days.
 
Bess was describing a trip that she made to Maine in July of 1977.
 
Chairman Hanks liked to mark up memos with remarks,  questions,  and
 
smiley  faces  or  frowny  faces  in  response  to  points  made.
 Bess
 
visited
 the
 Presque
 Isle
 area,
 the
 Bangor
 area
 and
 the
 
Lewiston/Portland area during a three-day sojourn.
 To quote from
 
Bess:
 "The leit-motif of the trip was struck by the co-chairwoman
 
of the Aroostook Arts Council...  who remarked with emotion when I
 
left that  I reminded her  of Mrs.  Roosevelt.
 Since  there  really
 
isn't any detectable resemblance,  I had to conclude that this was
 
G ?:i, p l y
 a  symbolic  statement.
 Mrs.
 ^^c^^.. c it t
er;
:
;-`  _ t
,c`vy
 
percentage of her time going to visit people who felt neglected or
 
left  out,  and  what  is  immediately  apparent  in  Maine  was  that
 
everybody (underlined)  feels  neglected and  left  out.
 The  State
 
Arts Council folks feel neglected by the Endowment;  the Aroostook
 
County Council feels neglected by the State Arts Council;  and the
 
Acadian and Swedish communities in northern Maine feel neglected by
 
the Aroostook Arts  folks."
 (note  by Nancy Hanks:  (
"hmmm.  Never
 
knew this. "
)
 
Bess continues to say that it all turned out to be true.
 She was
 
the  first person from the Endowment to have visited Maine during
 
the tenure of most of the staff.  At the same time the Arts Council
 
person  admitted  he  had  never  taken  an  official  trip  north  of
 
Bangor.  The local arts council representative had never driven the
 
twenty odd miles to visit the Acadian Village.
 She closes:
 "Some
 
day  I'm  going  to  write  a paper  on  the  social  effects  of  the
 
stranger's coming to town;  it really stirs things up."
 
I think we've gotten beyond that syndrome now, particularly here in
 
Maine.
 Arts  administrators  are  doing  a lot more  visiting  these
 
5
 
days.
 Our chairman has promised to visit all fifty states and six
 
special jurisdictions by the end of the year and she is well on her
 
way to accomplishing that.
 Folks working on the state and  local
 
level  in  Maine  are  getting  out  to  visit.
 These  comments  do
 
illustrate the importance of having a strong infrastructure through
 
local arts councils.
 It also brings home the need to have people
 
in positions at local arts organizations who are sensitive to the
 
needs of local culture.
 The theme of this meeting is " . . .
 and the
 
place of culture"  but I would like to turn that around and speak
 
for a bit about "the culture of place."
 
Yes,  it seems that we all need to travel that extra mile - in the
 
case of the NEA perhaps that extra thousand miles,  in the case of
 
the state arts council that extra hundred miles,  in the case of the
 
10 -a
 ?rt c  .
-
.,,,,;`; l diet  extra few miles to meet our consti`-..�,a -.
 
face-to-face.
 
In  a  democratic  country  such  as  ours,  made  up  of  a  diverse
 
populace, we have no national culture - no official culture - which
 
embodies and represents all of our people.  We have countless local
 
and self-defined cultures.
 We also have a popular culture which
 
aims at the mass audience.
 But,  with the increasing segmentation
 
of  that  audience  and  its  consumer  markets,  as  reflected  in  the
 
mind-boggling  number  of  channels  now  available  to  us  on  our
 
television sets,  our populace seems no more well connected.
 
The  information  age  seems  to have  brought us  a strange  sense  of
 
isolation and lack of consensus.
 People are linked to the outside
 
world - whether through a television screen or a networked computer
 
screen  -  but  they  feel  disconnected  from  one  another.
 The
 
prevailing  image  is  of  thousands  of  people  sitting  in  darkness,
 
each
 staring
 straight
 ahead
 into
 a  disembodied
 luminescent
 
electronic  tube  - alone.
 Even  with  virtual  reality,  we  still
 
struggle individually to reclaim a reality for virtue.
 
6
 
Critics have
 
authenticity
 
still unsure
 
pointed out that this disconnectedness has led to an
 
crisis.
 
As a young nation by most standards,  we are
 
of our  identity.
 Advertisers have realized this as
 
they market  to us  baby boomers.
 The Levi  Strauss  company  sells
 
Dockers  authentic  clothing,
 Gap  magazine  ads  validate  their
 
clothing with photo spreads that show Gene Kelly and Marilyn Monroe
 
wearing  chinos,
 or  mega-companies  such  as  AT&T  use  pseudo-
documentary  filmic  techniques,
 including  contrived  home-video
 
camera-work  to  convince  consumers  of  the  genuineness  of  their
 
message.
 I've even noticed that some of the Maine shoe companies
 
are advertising their wares to our urban populace with very lush
 
photos  of  muddied  and  scuffed  brand  new  shoes,
 as  if  that
 
authenticates  them.
 Of  course,  these  ads  are  in  GQ(Gentleman's
  
Quarterly), not Field and Stream.
 
In  light  of  this  nervousness  about  what  is  authentic,  what  can
 
local culture teach us?  Well,  local culture is about sharing.
 It
 
is about shared space.
 That is what makes it local. 
It is about
 
shared  ideas,  shared aspirations,  a shared sense of  enjoyment,  a
 
shared sense of beauty,  and a shared sense of the past.
 That is
 
what makes it culture. 
Wendell Berry eloquently says:
 "
...when a
 
community loses its memory,  its members no longer know one another.
 
How can they know one another if they have forgotten or have never
 
learned one another's stories?
 If they do not know one another's
 
stories,  how can  they know whether  or  not  to trust  one  another?
 
People who do not trust one another do not help one another,  and
 
moreover they fear one another.
 And this is our predicament now."
 
Having grown up in the rural midwest,  I am quite familiar with the
 
feeling that somehow local culture is inferior or behind the times
 
- maybe not as exciting as what is happening in Boston or New York
 
or  Los  Angeles  or  in  my  case  St.  Louis.
 Another  traveller  to
 
Maine, Henry David Thoreau, noted the tendency for citizens to look
 
elsewhere  for the good life and all  its trappings.
 I reread The
 
Maine Woods to prepare for this trip.
 Travelling to Maine in the
 
7
 
1830's, Thoreau gives us a beautiful description of Bangor as "like
 
a star on the edge of night,  still hewing at the forests of which
 
it  is built."
 He goes on to say that  it  is  "already overflowing
 
with the luxuries and refinement of Europe, and sending its vessels
 
to Spain,  to England,  and to the West Indies for its groceries."
 
on his trip away from Bangor into what was then the wilderness he
 
mentions encountering a mercantile cabin in the woods full of what
 
seem
 to
 be
 superfluous
 items,
 including
 many
 sophisticated
 
children's  toys.
 He  says:
 "As  if  a child,  born  into  the Maine
 
woods, among the pine cones and cedar-berries, could not do without
 
such a sugar-man,  or skipping jack,  as the young Rothschild has."
 
By the way, even then he mentions that at Oldtown there is a bateau
 
manufactory  and  that  the  Penobscot
 
---,, i } ;

island
 
consists of just 362  souls.
 That was in 1837.
 Thoreau engaged a
 
guide  from  the  Penobscot Neptune  family  to  accompany  him  on  his
 
journey into the woods.
 
Thoreau,  in passing, was making note of what he thought was a dying
 
culture.
 Thank  goodness  he  was  wrong,  but  he  was  right  to  be
 
concerned.  Local culture by necessity is continually inventing and
 
reinventing  itself.
 As Penobscot basketmaker,  the  late Madeline
 
Shay said concerning the traditional arts apprenticeship program
 
sponsored by the Maine Arts Council:
 "A person has to be really
 
interested  in  basketmaking.
 It's  the  same  as  the  Penobscot
 
language.
 You  have  to  keep talking  every day.
 You  can't  just
 
learn a few words a day and then expect to talk.
 You have to keep
 
going."
 
Madeline Shay was getting at the essence of local culture, of local
 
knowledge,  of  local  skills,  in  that  comment.
 You  have  to  be
 
"really interested."
 You have to keep doing it,  and you have to
 
see the connections - the link between art, culture,  language,  and
 
behavior.
 
8
 
This is what anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson gets at in her
 
wonderful new book Peripheral Visions. Peripheral vision allows us
 
to  be  aware  of  the  relationships  between  things  - to  see  the
 
cultural  surround,  the  contextual  richness  of  art  and  behavior.
 
This  is the opposite of the image of the singular person staring
 
straight ahead at the television or computer screen.  Local culture
 
connects  people  and  place,  process  and  product,  and  past  and
 
present.
 
The Maine Indian basketmakers have learned that their time-honored
 
and incredibly beautiful basketmaking traditions are linked to the
 
availability of the black ash tree.
 The availability of the black
 
ash tree  is  linked to climatic conditions,  harvesting practices,
 
acid
 rain,
 use
 of
 herbicides
 and
 pesticides,
 and
 other
 
environmental  fa ,fors.
 However  none  of  these  facto r=
 
significant if they did not want to make baskets .
.. if they did not
 
see beauty  in their baskets... if other people did not appreciate
 
their  baskets... if  they did  not want  to  teach  their  children  to
 
make baskets.
 
How  is  local culture a sense of place with a sense of direction?
 
Perhaps the hallmark of American culture is our mobility.
 As W.S.
 
Merwin says in his poem "Airport":
 
"we travel far and fast
 
and as we pass through we forget
 
where we have been."
 
I noticed an article in The Washington Post about Robert Frank, the
 
Swiss-born photographer who published his documentary photography
 
in the groundbreaking work The Americans. 
One week after arriving
 
in New York from Switzerland, he wrote back to his parents:
 "Life
 
here  is  very different than  in  Europe.
 Only the moment  counts,
 
nobody  seems  to  care  about  what  he'll  do  tomorrow."
 He  later
 
added:
 "Everything goes so exceptionally fast and I am only one
 
out of eight million people living here."
 
9
 
Change  has
 certainly  been  a  watchword  of  American  culture.
 
Progress seems to have been our most important product.
 I noticed
 
that at the recent anniversary gathering at Woodstock,  Peter Max
 
was assembling an audio time capsule but he decided to reopen it in
 
ten  years  because  he  felt  that  no  one  would  be  satisfied  with
 
waiting any longer.
 So much for our legacy to future generations.
 
Where  does  this  striving  toward  modernism  leave  local  culture?
 
Where does it leave cultures that respect tradition,  cultures that
 
honor  the  past?
 In  describing  the  sameness  of  mass  culture,  a
 
phenomenon he calls cultural grey-out, Alan Lomax quite eloquently
 
says:
 "Soon there will be nowhere to go and nothing worth staying
 
home for."
 
Drawing from my own experience,  rural life often does seems to be
 
going nowher.
 o.no ^ia?

'^ the
 As teenagers we certainly
 
weren't  prepared to  appreciate  the  subtle  distinction  between  a
 
cultural embrace and a straight jacket.
 We felt we weren't going
 
anywhere  fast.
 We used to drive out  '57  Chevy's around town....
 
round and round and round,  the maybe twenty block circuit over and
 
over on weekend afternoons,  as if driving were a sort of mantra on
 
wheels  - Irene's Cafe,  Sunset Park,  Riverfront Drive  .
..  Irene's
 
Cafe,  Sunset  Park,  Riverfront  Drive  - as  if  after  awhile  the
 
centrifugal  force  might  spin  us  off  into  some  new  and  exciting
 
domain.
 
We as small-town teenagers had the same problem that outsiders,  be
 
they tourists or cousins from the city, have in understanding local
 
culture.
 When you look at a specific place on a map, you can't see
 
a sense of direction.
 You can only determine direction when you
 
identify two coordinates.
 Then you can tell if you're going from
 
one place to another.
 
With
 local
 cultures,
 the  past  often  serves  as
 that
 second
 
coordinate.
 Indeed the past is as real as another place,  for there
 
is  in  local culture a culture of memory.
 There  is shared memory
 
to
 
and that shared memory conspires to provide many different places
 
within  one  place... the  town  before  the  highway  was  paved... the
 
neighborhood  before  the  fast  food  restaurant  came .
.. Main  Street
 
before  Wal-Mart  appeared... the  city  square  before  the
 local
 
raconteur passed on.
 Cliv Dore,  governor  of  the  Pleasant  Point
 
Passamaquoddy,  said at the 1993 basketmakers gathering:
 "Pounding
 
ash is like music to our ears.  A sound we don't hear often today."
 
The  Washington  Post recently  reported  the  National  Trust  for
 
Historic Preservation declared the entire state of Vermont as an
 
endangered place due to the recent influx of strip malls.
 
Local culture is not an extractive enterprise;  it does not reduce
 
community  resources
 or  ship  profits  away  from  their  source  -
rather,  it enriches citizens'  lives and multiplies a community's
 
artistic  wealth.
 Local  cultur - c
 a
 f r a
 f
i n_
 artistic
 
activity - a frame that both contains and presents.
 
pieced  quilt  with
 its  distinct  and  distinctive
 
encompasses  a variety  of  patterns  pieced  on  the
 
overlaid  with  stitches  that  provide  a  subtle
 
pattern.
 Quilts,  like  cultures,  demand  careful
 
patient contemplation to be truly appreciated.
 
Not unlike a
 
border  that
 
surface within,
 
pattern  upon  a
 
examination  and
 
When  we  address  the  needs  of  a  local  culture  the  process  of
 
discovery--or what folklorists call fieldwork--is important.
 This
 
is  why  projects  sponsored  by  the  Maine  Arts  Council  involving
 
fieldwork in Lewiston or in the St. John River Valley,  or projects
 
conducted by the Portland Performing Arts Center surveying the arts
 
of the Cambodian community of southern Maine,  or projects of the
 
Maine
 Indian  basketmakers
 identifying  needs  of  basketmakers,
 
deserve our support and our emulation.
 This  is painstaking work
 
but it is important.
 
Presentation of local culture to the general public is a daunting
 
challenge.
 As arts presenters, cultural specialists,  or community
 
scholars,  in order to do justice to local culture,  we are obliged
 
11
 
to meet it face-to-face, to get to know it over time,  and to listen
 
to  its subtler refrains.
 Local culture often does not shout,  it
 
whispers.
 
Sometimes we can try too hard or worry too much about the fragile
 
nature  of  local  culture.
 I remember  taking  a group  of  Ozark
 
musicians on a musical tour throughout the midwest once and on our
 
last  night of  the tour we were  booked  into Lawrence,  Kansas,  in
 
conjunction with a music edu ca tors
 con
ference.
 Our performance was
 
to  occur  just  after  an  operatic  recital,  which  happened  to  be
 
running overtime.
 As we sat backstage and the opera singer wowed
 
the audience with her vocal pyrotechnics,  I began to wonder how we
 
could make the transition to our rather low-key ensemble of ballad
 
singers and fiddlers.
 The opening act on our program was a cowboy
 
rle.
nn Ohrlin, who sang mostly cowboy ballads
 T cc
,
 
an  introduction  which  tried  to  point  out  that  in  traditional
 
singing such as his,  it was often the material that was important,
 
not  the  personality of  the artist.
 The artist  stood behind the
 
song  rather than out  in  front of  it.
 I thought  I might  explain
 
that our portion of the program would be a little more low-key, but
 
then  cowboys  who  were  used  to  singing  around  livestock  didn't
 
particularly cultivate great leaps in volume or in pitch in their
 
singing style.
 At the best that sort of approach might produce a
 
sidelong glance from a steer,  at worst it might incite a stampede.
 
Well, after my rather faltering attempt to prepare the audience for
 
this very different kind of music, Glenn Ohrlin ambled out with his
 
beat  up  guitar .
.. sat  down... strummed  a few  notes... cleared  his
 
throat... looked up at the audience and said,  "I'm not sure what to
 
sing, that lady just sang everything I know."  After that we didn't
 
have a thing to worry about.
 
So what is the place of art in all of this?
 In many cultures,  not
 
all,  art is at the center of identity.
 It is the glue that holds
 
it all together.
 Art is not medicine that you take because it is
 
good for you, rather it is nutrition that sustains you.
 It is that
 
12
 
which  affirms  who  you  are  and  opens  pathways  to  what  you  might
 
become.
 It provides a sense of place with a sense of direction.
 
Mary Gabriel, the fine Passamaquoddy basketmaker who just received
 
the  National  Heritage  Fellowship  this  past  month  in  Washington
 
reminded us of the close connection between art and life when she
 
said:
 "I've been making baskets for 77 years.
 Someone asked me if
 
that was my hobby.
 I didn't know how to answer.
 It is my life."
 
What  more  is  there  to  say?
 Local  culture  is  our  life,  whether
 
we're
 in  coastal  Maine,
 the  St.
 John's  River  valley,
 urban
 
Portland,  or Old Town.
 I can't help but return to my old friend
 
Joe Politte who  looked at Niagara Falls and said  "we have one of
 
those back in the Lead Belt."
 All the way home I wondered if any
 
of those si
 r
*hts  i
n Ncc.! vn r
il — A made an impression on him at all.
 
As we pulled up to his home off the gravel road,  way back in the
 
woods,  he  finally  let a little  smile creep across his  face.
 We
 
parked in his yard and his wife Margaret came out to greet us.
 As
 
she walked up to him and asked him how he enjoyed the trip, he bent
 
forward and softly said,  as  if  he didn't want me to hear - "You
 
missed half your life."
 Let's hope we still have a reason to both
 
travel  and to stay at home and  let's hope we don't miss half our
 
life.

REPORT ON THE JOINT PLAN REVIEW SESSION OF THE YUNNAN
 
NATIONALITIES CULTURE PROJECT SUBMITTED BY BARRY BERGEY
 
A Dai legend explains the proliferation of a particular style of
 
Dai singing.
 It recounts how a living Buddha who sang sutras at
 
a temple in the province of Xishuangbana was challenged to a
 
singing contest by a stranger who came to that locale.
 The
 
competition was staged and it became obvious that people of the
 
land preferred the stranger's singing.
 The Buddha,  angered by
 
this affront to his talent and authority,  threatened the people
 
with severe punishment if they learned to sing from the stranger.
 
In spite of the threats, many people emulated the singing of the
 
stranger,  his singing style proliferated,  and today he is honored
 
as the ancestor of the Dai singers.
 
This tale illustrates the circuitous and unpredictable route that
 
particular artistic traditions sometimes take in a culture's
 
history.
 The best laid plans often suffer the chance appearance
 
of strangers or the willful sidetracking of the general populace.
 
I mention this story because it embodies the very reason that
 
work in cultural conservation and cultural advocacy can be so
 
befuddling,  yet it also hints at the fact that artistic
 
traditions are central to the identity of many cultures and
 
exhibit a certain will not only to survive but to prosper.
 
The Review Session for the United States-China Arts Exchange
 
provided the opportunity to experience and examine a variety of
 
projects aimed at the conservation and perpetuation of artistic
 
traditions of Yunnan's ethnic minorities.
 I first want to
 
express my thanks to the U.S.-China Arts Exchange,  to the Ford
 
Foundation,  and to my many new-found colleagues and friends in
 
Yunnan Province for the opportunity to participate in this Review
 
Session.
 Certainly the Review Session could not have come off so
 
smoothly without a great deal of effort from the dedicated staff
 
of the Center.
 Thank you!
 
The Review Session made apparent the abundant cultural resources
 
of the ethnic minorities of Yunnan Province.
 It is encouraging
 
to see that at all levels of government,  from the provincial to
 
the local,  there is a recognition that the culture of the
 
minorities is a valuable asset and an important resource to be
 
documented and perpetuated.
 The U.S.-China Arts Exchange offers
 
a unique opportunity for a partnership in an effort,  unique to my
 
knowledge,  that will address governmental attention and cultural
 
retention on a number of institutional levels employing a variety
 
of targeted programs.
 
In writing my report on the review session,  I am somewhat sobered
 
by a recent article in Harper's written by Sallie Tisdale about
 
the subject of travel writing.
 She says:
 "We forget that
 
exotica is not merely a relative concept;  it is fundamentally
 
relative,  the very definition of relativeness.
 The visitor who
 
longs for China to stay Chinese wants the right to define Chinese
 
2
 
himself.
 He wanders the back roads,  then writes his book so that
 
everyone will know what matters most:  not to be the first to see
 
remote lands but to be the last to see the land remote.
 He goes
 
alone where no one he knows has been,  and then comes home to talk
 
about it.
 It's the new colonialism."  (
"Never let the locals see
 
your map," Harpe rs, September,  1995,  p.72)
 I will try to write
 
this with the caveat that these are the opinions of one who is
 
himself a novice traveler over the backroads of Yunnan.
 
Research and Fieldwork
 
The field researchers at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences
 
are a dedicated and hard-working group of scholars.
 I was very
 
much inspired by their presentations.
 Two things impressed me as
 
a common theme in the lectures of these scholars:
 first,  a deep
 
sense of personal commitment to their work on the part of the
 
individual scholars,  often expressed as a need to personally move
 
beyond the day-to-day aspects of the research to make an
 
emotional or spiritual connection with the members or cultures of
 
the nationalities;  second,  a common sense of urgency in t
tieir
 
work,  frequently reflected in statements that nationality culture
 
is fast disappearing and that we need to preserve it or tD rescue
 
it.
 
Mr.  Wang Qinghua quoted a poem that one of the Hani villagers
 
recited about a fieldworker that for me captured the dilemma
 
represented by the role of fieldwork in thinking about cultural
 
conservation today.
 In the poem the villager describes the
 
fieldworker as like a big tree.
 She could not climb the tree but
 
could only stand in its shadow.
 The villager says that the
 
fieldworker has come from afar and has hardly spoken a word and
 
now she can merely say goodbye big brother with the watch on your
 
arm.
 This richly metaphoric poem speaks volumes about the
 
pitfalls of fieldwork in geographic places and psychic spaces
 
remote from our own.
 Villagers may often feel that they are
 
diminished,  as  if  in the shadow,  in relation to fieldworkers.
 
The reference to the watch on the fieldworker's arm,  reminds us
 
that time,  a concept with vastly different  implications  in
 
different cultures,  often prevents the extended interaction
 
between fieldworkers and informants that would provide deep
 
understanding of one another.
 In the end,  the villagers often
 
may feel they have  in effect been seduced and abandoned.
 
Because culture and cultural process  is such an elusive concept,
 
anthropologists today are rethinking the role that fieldwork and
 
collecting might play in cultural conservation.
 Informed by
 
previous experiences,  scholars are challenging past fieldwork
 
approaches.
 Douglas Cole in Captured Heritage:
 The Scramble for
 
Northwest Coast Artifacts notes:
 "Anthropological collecting had
 
special  impetus behind it:
 the realization that time was
 
essential,  that civilization was everywhere pushing the primitive
 
3
 
to the wall,  destroying the material culture and even
 
extinguishing the native stock itself.
 'What can be done must be
 
done now.
 If it is not,  the possibility of ethnology is forever
 
annulled.'
 This sense of urgency,  this notion of a scientific
 
mission, was a constant theme of nineteenth- and early twentieth-
century anthropology."  (p.  287)
 He goes on to conclude:
 "The
 
salvage impulse was to an extent self-fulfilling.
 Much had
 
disappeared from the field not because Indians and their culture
 
were doomed,  but because it had already been swept up by other
 
museums."  (p.  288)
 
Fieldwork that is geared toward the extraction of information or
 
objects can be ultimately counter-productive,  mining the
 
localized cultural landscape of its most important resources,  be
 
they material,  ideological,  or human.
 More recently,  scholars
 
have emphasized the need for "cultural feedback" as a part of the
 
documentational process.
 Feedback would insure a system of
 
providing informants and informant cultures access to collected
 
or documented materials.
 In some cases this can be done through
 
local cultural centers or archives and in other cases it might be
 
as simple as developing a portable culture bank,  that is a
 
suitcase that might contain recordings,  slides,  photos,  objects,
 
etc.,  that could be used by local people as a source of
 
information about their cultural heritage.
 This may be something
 
that the Yunnan scholars would want to consider.
 
It seemed to me that the scholars at the Academy of Social
 
Sciences had given some thought to the potentially negative
 
impact of insensitive fieldwork.
 Mr.  Hao in particular mentioned
 
early mistakes and described a process by which the videographers
 
shared each day's recordings with villagers and sought their
 
input.
 This is one way to make fieldwork a genuinely
 
collaborative process.
 I was more concerned about some of the
 
projects described by fieldworkers at the Nationalities Museum
 
that seemed to focus on the acquisition of objects for the museum
 
collections.
 I would recommend that there be more training of
 
fieldworkers from the Museum,  perhaps through a collaborative
 
project with the Academy of Social Sciences.
 Also I was very
 
impressed by the knowledge and documentary work of Professor
 
Zhang Xingrong of the Yunnan Institute of Arts.
 I think that he
 
and his wife,  who also has documented a great deal of minority
 
music,  could be of assistance in any of the fieldwork projects.
 
At any rate,  in all cases there should be a set of ethical
 
standards developed for all fieldwork that would spell out
 
collecting practices,  including the need for informed consent,
 
the proper archival and storage procedures for material
 
collected,  and the rights of individuals to restrict public
 
access to information collected.
 Confidentiality and privacy are
 
often effective strategies designed by societies specifically to
 
maintain and perpetuate
 cultural traditions.
 It is important
 
I
 
4
 
for cultural workers to be sensitive to this fact and to respect
 
these boundaries that serve to demarcate conduits of cultural
 
continuity.
 
Fieldwork projects would benefit from cross-institutional and
 
cross-disciplinary collaboration.
 Projects that involve
 
ethnographers,  geographers,  artists,  demographers,  economists,
 
ecologists,  sociologists,  etc., would provide the opportunity to
 
look at the complex of issues that might be affecting minority
 
culture.
 In the long run,  it will be much more productive to
 
look at the processes rather than the products of cultural
 
retention and to be aware of the many forces at work presently on
 
these situations.
 
Mentorship/Apprenticeship
  
The Mentorship/Apprenticeship Program is another means of
 
addressing issues of cultural retention.
 The Yunnan Ethnic
 
Culture Institute at Anning is an ambitious program that
 
seemingly is aimed at bringing together mentors and students to
 
study music,  dance and craft traditions of several of the ethnic
 
minorities.
 As outlined in his paper "Preserving Ethnical
 
Culture of Original Inhabitants - Our Most Lofty Duties," Mr.
 
Tian Feng presents a rather apocalyptic view of the health and
 
fate of traditional ethnic culture with rather extreme remedies
 
prescribed for the patient.
 While the aspirations of this
 
program are laudable,  it seems to me that the strategies for
 
preserving ethnic culture might deserve further discussion.
 
As with projects involving the acquisition of materials for
 
museums,  the extended separation of individual mentors or
 
students from the context of the village setting can have
 
deleterious consequences in the long run.
 While attendance at an
 
intensive workshop or culture camp for a circumscribed period of
 
time might provide young people with an opportunity to learn a
 
great deal from a master artist and energize their interest in
 
and commitment to traditional art forms,  their extended absence
 
from the village context might prove to be injurious to both the
 
student and the village.
 Taking the masters or shaman out of the
 
village for some time might also disrupt ceremonial and cultural
 
cycles of activity in the village.
 
Sensitivity to the age-old processes of teaching and learning
 
would in the long run appear to best serve the stated purposes.
 
An apprenticeship program that occurs within the village context,
 
one-on-one,  is still the most effective way of transmitting
 
knowledge.
 Neither reconstruction of cultural context nor
 
reenactment of cultural activity has proven to be an effective
 
means of cultural conservation in my experience.
 
5
 
The evening performance at Anning raised several other concerns.
 
It seemed that this performance was designed not for internal
 
reenforcement,  but rather for an external audience.
 The program
 
had all the trappings of a highly choreographed folkloric variety
 
show.
 Reenactment of the shamanic healing made me uncomfortable
 
- this type of theatricalization of serious and heavily belief-
bound cultural practice further alienates cultural meaning from
 
cultural practice.
 
The fact that some of the ethnic participants performed in the
 
programs of other groups,  seemed to indicate a certain degree of
 
cross-cultural training at the Institute.
 Even within ethnic
 
groups,  it appeared that people from different villages were
 
studying together.
 This led me to question whether there might
 
not be distinctive village traditions that were not universal
 
among particular minorities.
 I would be concerned if this
 
training were a vehicle for muddying some of the distinctive
 
characteristics of particular village aesthetics or traditions.
 
Likewise the idea of creating a folk village to preserve the
 
cultures of the minorities is fraught with problems.
 Although
 
this idea is not new and relates to some of the anthropological
 
displays planned for World Expositions around the turn of the
 
century in which tribal members were presented in an almost zoo-
like setting,  I know of no instance where this type of program
 
has worked.
 The success of such an undertaking depends so
 
directly on the hermetic control of the physical and social
 
environment of the inhabitants that these utopian projects,
 
whether planned for cultural or religious reasons,  have done more
 
harm than good to my knowledge.
 
I would suggest that intensive short term workshops or mentoring
 
programs might be one use for a site such as Anning.
 Another
 
possibility might be to bring villagers and fieldworkers together
 
at such a site in order to collect information,  train
 
fieldworkers,  and train villagers in document5ation and archival
 
techniques.
 Ultimately the success of cultural conservation
 
programs will depend on the appreciation of villagers for their
 
own traditions and their commitment to the survival of those
 
traditions.
 As Clifford Geertz has pointed out:
 "Like sailing,
 
gardening,  politics,  and poetry,  law and ethnography are crafts
 
of place:
 they work by the light of local knowledge."
 (Local
 
Knowledge,  p.  167)
 Consequently,  in the end the issue of the
 
maintenance of minority traditions will return to the arena of
 
village life and more specifically to the light of hearth and
 
home.
 Any mentorship or apprenticeship program should be aimed
 
at taking the action and information back to the village and
 
familial setting.
 
Bringing artists and scholars together to discuss issues related
 
to transmission of artistic skills might help identify particular
 
6
 
impediments to cultural retention.
 Some questions that might be
 
addressed include:
 Is language retention a significant issue for
 
minority peoples and,  if so, how does this affect the passing on
 
of songs and verbal lore?
 For craftspeople,  is access to raw
 
materials used in making the crafts a problem?
 Are there
 
particular disincentives discouraging young people from learning
 
traditional artistic skills?
 Is the link between specific belief
 
systems and artistic practices or calendrical celebrations no
 
longer present in the villages?  Answers to questions such as
 
these will help in the design of a program that might provide
 
meaningful mentorships/apprenticeships.
 
Summary 
The partnership project in Yunnan Province offers many
 
opportunities to make advances in addressing issues of cultural
 
retention of ethnic minorities.
 The deeply-felt concerns
 
expressed by governmental and cultural officials about t
l-e loss
 
of minority artistic traditions in Yunnan was truly impressive.
 
Sensitivity to these issues is the first step toward addressing
 
these concerns.
 So many other governments,  when experiercing
 
dramatic changes such as these,  have either willfully ignored or
 
denied the potential negative impact of industrialization/
 
urbanization on minority cultures.
 My impression is that the
 
cultural crisis,  as described so passionately by scholars and
 
officials in Yunnan,  is not just manifest in minority culture or
 
in village life but indeed is also evident in Han culture and in
 
the cities.
 Change is rapid and is apparent in the daily clash
 
between bicycles and cars in the intersections of Kunming or the
 
dissonant sound of the old buildings around Green Lake being
 
leveled to make way for new high rises.
 
In some cases the disjuncture is not really about minority
 
cultures,  but rather about the uneasy transition from a village-
based culture to an urban-based culture.
 Cultural
 
distinctiveness and connection with a deeply rooted cultural past
 
is a universal need,  not limited to minority peoples.
 Robert
 
Critchfield has pointed out in his book Villages that villages
 
are civilization's oldest and most durable social institution and
 
that "village life is not only vital in itself,  but is also the
 
fundamental basis of all civilized behavior,  including our own."
 
(p.  viii)
 A governmental policy with regard to the viability of
 
minority culture must also take into account the viability of
 
village culture.
 
Fieldwork can serve the valuable purpose of pursuing an
 
understanding of the many factors that affect the transmission of
 
cultural and aesthetic values within the village context.
 This
 
knowledge can best be obtained by in-depth work in particular
 
villages rather than broad work on the surface in many locales.
 
Preferably this work could be done in teams involving the
 
collaboration of scholars from a number of different disciplines.
 
A specific aim of this undertaking should also be the sharing of
 
information with villagers and the training of community scholars
 
within the village to carry on activities after the fieldworkers
 
leave.
 
Information gathered by the scholars could also feed the various
 
other projects of the Joint Plan,  including the Nationalities
 
Museum,  the Nationalities Institute and a Mentorship/
 
Apprenticeship Program.
 In particular,  the Mentorship Program
 
would benefit from a collaboration with fieldworkers and
 
ethnographic scholars.
 By identifying key issues related to
 
cultural transmission in individual villages,  the fieldworkers
 
and researchers could inform the development of strategies for
 
supporting processes of cultural retention in those villages.
 
I have read that many of the minority people in Yunnan believe
 
that it is essential to maintain an eternal fire in the hearth
 
and to revere the three stones(guozhuang),  considered sacred,
 
that serve as a cooking stand over the hearth.
 Ultimately,  the
 
maintenance of tradition is likewise dependent upon a sincere
 
commitment by the villagers to the perpetuation of the spiritual
 
and aesthetic forces that catalyze artistic action and a respect
 
for those support systems that undergird the sustenance of
 
cultural identity.
 It is my hope that the Joint Plan can
 
continue to participate in that challenging process.
 
Kunming
 
Bicycles flow over the streets of Kunming
 
like water crashing fresh from the mountainside,
 
dodging obstacles with facile dexterity
 
while the faces of riders are polished of all
 
distraction.
 
Around Green Lake prodigal buildings
 
set off on a journey for the sky,
 
while ancient residences retreat
 
to undignified beds of rubble.
 
A group of elders glide in unison
 
and pause transfixed along the lake
 
poised in balance
 
against the early morning breeze.
 
Nearby incessant car horns
 
trumpet the dawn of a new world.
 
In the Museum
 
Surrounded by cases of artefacts,
 
the Red River Hani nervously glance back and forth
 
before their gazes fall to rest on the floor.
 
They are quickly encircled by tourists.
 
The couches swallow their spirits.
 
In a small voice the wizened leader chants,
 
soon joined by others, warping and wefting,
 
calling and counterpointing,
 
until the room is full,
 
embroidered with seamless song.
 
We walked six hours
 
to reach a carrier of people.
 
We rode four days and nights
 
to see a village where
 
darkness never blankets the light.
 
We walked down rock smooth pathways
 
amidst a forest of buildings.
 
We entered a chamber for dancing
 
to see clouds made by machines.
 
We ascended to this room of mysteries
 
to be blinded by boxes that flash lightning.
 
Surely this is heaven
 
Surely this is heaven.
 
Suddenly in mid-song
 
time is up.
 
The crowd drifts on.
 
Our song is not ended
 
Bamboo flutes exhale no warm breezes
 
Our song is not ended
 
Rice vessels yawn for nourishment
 
Our song is not ended
 
Silver adornments sleep in glass cases
 
Our song is not ended
 
Empty garments shroud the walls of the sepulchre
 
Our song is not ended
 
The room is overcome with silence.
 
Our song is not ended.
 
Our song is not ended.
 
Yao Rites of Passage
 
The villagers block our way
 
on the path to enlightenment
 
exacting a toll for the privilege
 
of witnessing the rites of passage.
 
The tricksters know
 
that we are mere children.
 
We must purchase
 
what we can never possess
 
in order to save Yao souls.
 
The Folk Village
 
The man in the grey suit and tie
 
sits stiffly in the chair
 
and explains that:
 
Culture is on a path to destruction
 
Change means death
 
We must wall out the world.
 
A Naxi shamen rehearses the desk-bound children
 
in the ancient hieroglyphs
 
pointing at the stick figures on the blackboard.
 
Chalk dust cloaks the mystery of the age-old story
 
and memory and meaning sneeze at good intentions.
 
Villagers dance our dinner
 
into the courtyard with great ceremony
 
Food floats overhead on styrofoam,
 
an immutable,  unforgiving alter
 
for an even-tide offering.
 
Rain riddles the dancing ground
 
Melting the paper lanterns hanging overhead
 
and staining the ground with unanswered questions.
 
Can the chrysalis forever sanctuary the slumbering
 
pupae?
 
Does not hope awake and take flight on freedom's
 
wing?
 
Does the bell jar beatify the butterfly,
 
captured by children in the hills of
 
Xishuangbanna?
