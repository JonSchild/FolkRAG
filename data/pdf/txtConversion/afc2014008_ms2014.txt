Some four years ago, without any particular fanfare, an event
 
of some interest to folklorists and cultural anthropologists took place
 
in Washington.
 It was just routine good governmental procedure, but it
 
still took some doing.  Four separate federal agencies concluded all at the
 
same time that they shared legitimate interests in the same area of the
 
American experience and that they needed to establish publicly just how those
 
interests fit together in order to minimize duplication, prevent confusion,
 
and ensure that the needs of the people were being seen to.

The agencies involved %
i6h& the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian
 
Institution, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
 
for the Humanities.  And thanks in no small part to the efforts of some
 
competent and experienced public sector folklorists who happened to be in the
 
right place at the right time, a sensible and clear document was produced.
 
Such official statements are ib often more important than they seem on the
 
surface since they can be used to lay the ground work for later efforts.
 
This one is titled 'Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Certain Federal
 
Programs Relating to Folk Culture", and it begins:
 
"The Federal government recognizes the need for fostering and supporting
 
American folk culture and encouraging a greater understanding of our traditional
 
and workaday history.  Recent efforts to answer those needs have built upon
 
earlier Federal initiatives such as the Federal Writers Project, the Bureau of
 
American Ethnology, the Farm Security Administration's documentary photography
 
project, and the Library of Congress' Archive of American Folk Song.
 
"Four Federal agencies bear prime responsibility at this time for
 
addressing the field of American folklife as it is evidenced throughout the
 
nation, its territories, and possession.s  The National Endowment for the Arts,

Folk Arts Program, provides funding to folk arts projects and to folk artists
 
and traditional communities across the land.  The National Endowment for
 
the Humanities funds scholarly research, education, and public programs
 
which bring the resources of scholars in the humanities to bear on folk
 
cultures.  The American Folklife Center ix in the Library of Congress provides
 
programs and services to the field, research and archival services, and public
 
programs and publications.  The Smithsonian Institution gathers, documents,
 
and maintains collections of the artifacts of American l
ife and presents both
 
museum exhibitions and the major festival of folk culture in our country as
 
well.
 It conducts scholarly research in the subject area of folklife."
 
Later in the document an example of the four institutions' varying
 
approaches is cited.  The Federal Cylinder Project was initiated some four years
 
ago to make accessible to the general public the various federal holdings of
 
cylinder recordings of music and song (
largely American Indian) recorded during
 
the period of 1890-1920, approximately.
 
"The Federal Cylinder Project", the document goes on to say, "provides
 
an ilustration of the potential for useful cooperation among the agencies
 
regarding folklife concerns.. .The cylinder recordings themsevesl are largely
 
in the possession of the Library of Congress (
though significant holdings also
 
turned up in the Bureau of American Ethnology and the National Archives -
 BLH)
 
The American Folklife Center is organizing, cataloguing and transferring the
 
cylinders to tape for future accessibility and use.  The Smithsonian is
 
contributing staff time to the pxajxx effort.  The National Endowment for the
 
Humanities funds research projects related to the Federal Cylinder Project.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts funds dissemination and presentation projects
 
related to the Federal Cylinder Project."

The general outline still pertains.  The two Endowments fund things -
-
scholarly research projects and artistic presentations respectively, while
 
the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian do things -
-
 research, archiving,
 
and publications on the one hand, museum activities and events related to
 
museum collections on the other.  From the federal management point of view
 
it's a pleasingly neat and well-proportioned picture of a sensible governmental
 
approach to a rather tricky and complex area.
 
Actually, it wasn't originally conceived of this way.  When the two
 
Endowments were put into place almost t
if
t
, ty years ago there was an idea
 
floating about that there should be a third Endowment concerned exclusively
 
with the grass roots, a sort of National Endowment for Folk and Traditional
 
Cultures.
 It was a pretty straight-forward notion: since the Humanities
 
Endowment basically addressed the needs of professional scholars, and the
 
Arts Endowment basically addressed the needs of professional artists (
almost
 
without exception those working within western European "high art" traditions)
 
a third granting institution was required to l
ook after the interests of people
 
from the small traditions -
-
 ethnic, tribal, and local.
 
I
t would have been, one must admit, simpler if things had worked out
 
that way.  Reorienting projects designed to benefit traditional cultures into
 
the particular shapes demanded by either the Huainnities or the Arts Endowments
 
has become, somewhat sadly, a routine, though specialized, bureaucratic exercise.
 
But the better we all become at the bureaucratic game, the harder it is to think
 
outside it.  Even the action agencies, the American Folklife Center at the
 
Library of Congress and the Office of Folklife Programs at the Smithsonian, appear
 
to find it difficult to think in holistic terms, so powerful is the aura of the
 
granting agencies with all their lovely money.
 I used to think that issues
 
4
 
involving structure and organization were not worth spending a lot of time
 
on and that only substance and content were really important to think about.
 
Perhaps the past seven years in federal service have bureaucratized me (
and
 
I know they have, though I hope not to the point of paralysis).  Still, I
 
certainly have more respect than I had when I came in for the limiting and
 
shaping powers of definition, structure and form.
 (
And as I write this, I
 
seem to hear echoes of earlier lectures by my old professior Frederica DeLaguna
 
on social organization and such ap parently useless topics..)
 
So, to take an example with which I am most familiar, to consider what
 
the Folk Arts Program does or does not do, it is necessary to realize that
 
it sits, structurally speaking, in the middle of a larger agency, the National
 
Endowment for the Arts.
 I
t is then important to know that it i
s a very small
 
4
. 4
. tL
is  A.f  tv
 po erf&I
 
part of that agency, spending somewhat less than 2% of the agency's program
 
funds.  The other 98% funds such matters as operas, literary presses, non-profit
 
theaters, design competitions, -
museum exhibitions, ballet tours, art-in-public-
places, symphony orchestra seasons, public building design competitions and
 
a
ll manner of like contributiQns to the general public weal.
 I personally
 
believe that such funding is an entirely appropriate expenditure of the public
 
purse.
 I heartily approve of the concepts behind the National Endowments, and
 
I think the National Endowment for the Arts in particular i
s close to a model
 
federal agency -
-
 small, humane, alert, and sensitive.
 
However, when the Folk Arts Program attempts to respond to the Hoopa
 
tribal e
lders' interest in reinvigorating their brush dance tradition and
 
teaching some of the young people how to sing the older songs and make the
 
appropriate traditional costumes, their problem has to be posed in terms
 
compatible with procedures that were really set up to help the Detroit Symphony
 
5
 
extend their season an extra month or to get a quarter of a million dollars
 
to Martha Graham to film her dance company repertoire for the benefit of
 
future generations. It does take some jimmying about.
 
However, the fact that the concerns for the future evidenced both
 
by Martha Graham and the Hoopa e
lders find their way to the same federal
 
agency is a fascinating comment on just how deeply the granting system has
 
penetraded the social fabric and how far-reaching are its effects.  If I
 
were making things up from scratch, I don't think I would come up with the granting
 
system as a mechanism for helping small cultures; it i
s too cumbersome, requires
 
too much paper, and depends too much on money as its sole incentive.  However,
 
for now at least, we are stuck with it, and so, in the Folk Arts Program, we
 
have tried to explore the farthest reaches of its limitations.
 
For example, with first-time applicants t we make a big scene about
 
working out hudgets and various kinds of hard and soft match.  When tribal and
 
small community 
,people realize that, yes indeed, their donated time and the
 
use of their community hail stand on the same level as the donated federal
 
.
0 . 0 \:
' 4 0-0 F
;
 
 
dollars, they find
 We also urge them to
 
include the costs of hiring those outside experts that they may need in order
 
to accomplish their particular ends, rather than our just sending them in.
 
The former procedure sets the ethnic organization or tribe up as the employer
 
and helps put the necessary l
inguist, sound recordist or folklorist into a
 
consulting relationship with a dignified, - tgp-i1i. exchange of advice and expertise
 
A
 
for dollars.
 
Finally, we've used the granting mechanism to induce a variety of state
 
agencies to set up positions for folklorists and ethnomusicologists and
 
anthropologiststo work full time as advocates and aides to the small traditions
 
6
 
in their respective states.  This idea has really caught on.  There are now
 
almost forty such positions in the states and territories with more joining
 
the program every few months.
 It has an exciting potential, this state folk
 
arts coordinator idea.  There are some real drawbacks -
-
 you have to work
 
with and within a bureaucracy, the positions don't pay all that much, and
 
l
ong-term job security is minimal.  But it's such a brand-new concept that,
 
with a l
ittle bit of luck and some sensible public strategies, you can often
 
set into motion whatever you think really needs doing.  Such a degree of inde-
pendence i
s a luxury these days.
 
Some coordinators run their own state granting programs; some work on
 
getting traditional arts and artists into local schools; some conduct state
 
durveys of folk
. arts and artists and turn their results into exhibits and
 
archives and festivals; some put out radio and television programs on traditional
 
artists, story tellers and musicians; some try to get old-timers to take on young
 
apprentices
..
 In many respects the work i
s l
imited only by the imagination and
 
energy of the incumbent.
 
Most importantly, through these programs and others l
ike them mounted
 
by other agencies, a gradual professionalization of approach has been developing,
 
right across the country, and it is already beginning to appear that the general
 
public is ever less willing to settle for the meretricious, the exploitative or
 
the phony.  They are beginning to demand more from their publicly-supported
 
agencies at least.  To ci te only one example of many, the Texas Agricultural
 
Department decided recently that their venerable state fair, long the exclusive
 
prdnrince of commercial food purveyors who gave out endless free samples of
 
canned chili and instant pudding, should include a major section demonstrating
 
traditional Texan food preparation and food preservation techniques, not just of
 
the Anglo majority a but of the many cultures that make up Texan diversity.
 
7
 
This was nice, but the fact that they knew that in order to reach
 
their goals they needed to advertise for and recruit a team of professional
 
folk l
ife advocates,who knew something about how to put such l
ive demonstrations
 
together conceptually and
 and how to locate and present the very
 
most interesting traditional farm women and cooks available )was even nicer.  The
 
last ten years have seen the standards for public presentation of folklife
 
raised measurably by a steady on oing process of public education.
 
Much of this may sound l
ike small potatoes to anthropologists working
 
AS
 
within economic and political arenas 1
.+
 land tenure c
laims and tribal status
 
problems.  But all the areas of folklife and folk art seem to function, on
 
their deepest levels, as public statements of identity, on the one hand, and
 
world view  on the other.  These are scarcely irrelevant or trivial subjects.
 
And thus we f
ind that expressive behavior i
s deeply involved with group morale,
 
that the recent  revival of the Wolf Dance for only a s
ingle performance was of
 
enormous spiritual importance for the King I
sland Eskimos, that Carnival still
 
brings hundreds of thousands of Caribbean peoples together in joyful demonstrations
 
of unity on the streets of Brooklyn and Queens.  And ze I keep on finding myself
 
excited that somewhere there i
s a formal piece of paper that says that the
 
federal government "recognizes the need for fostering a supporting American
 
folk culture and encouraging a greater understanding of our traditional and
 
'
be
 
workaday history..
. 
1
1  I
t has not always 4e
 so.
 
This brings me to a few final thoughts.  I am of a generation that has
 
seen its world turned upside down on several occasions and i
s used to dusting
 
itself off and ploughing on in whatever fashion appears most l
ikely to produce
 
hopeful results.  We are used to non-perfection.  We are used, also, to thinking
 
of things as temporary.  Many of my younger colleagues, I find, do not realize
 
r. I
 
how recent are the governmental agencies on which they so often now dQuald.  The
 
Endowments are not quite twenty years old, and their utility i
s still being
 
8
 
debated in the conservative press.  The Smithsonian Institution has only
 
been actively involved in folklife programs for  I
S years.  The Folk Arts
 
Program at the Arts Endowment is only seven years old.  The American Folklife
 
V
 
Center at the Library of Congress i
s
 
My point i
s that these are recent institutional responses to long-
standing public needs.  Federally speaking, all these organizations are
 
babies: experimental, still to be proven, hopeful, and very very vulnerable.
 
Remember that the huge mechanism of the Works Progress Administration disappeared
 
in what seemed to be only a week or two after Pearl Harbour -
-
 desks, telephones,
 
fi
les, workers.  The federal government can be fickle.
 
I would urge you t
hen to keep a kindly and watchful eye on the
 
government agencies that try to serve some of the needs of American traditional
 
communities.  With all our warts and spots and protuberances, we are still here
 
and still moving, but you could wake
-up some morning and find us gone.  But
 
you would find, I believe, that we had left a legacy, a legacy to which all
 
the "programs related to folk culture" have contributed, a legacy that would
 
require us to be re-invented 
)perhaps in a better form, but a legacy that would
 
require that attention to the needs of small American traditional communities
 
must continue to be paid.

Some coordinators run their own  state granting programs; some work on
 
getting traditional arts and artists into local schools; some conduct state

i
rveys of folk arts and artists and turn their results into exhibits and
 
archives and festivals; some p
_ .t radio and television programs on traditional
 
artists, story, tellers and musicians; some try to get old-timers to take on young
 
apprentices.

federal government "recognizes the need for fostering /'supporting American
 
folk culture and encouraging a greater understanding of our traditional and
 
workaday history.. ."  It has not always d
one so.
 
This brings me to a few final thoughts.  I am of a generation that has
 
seen its world turned upside down on several
 occasions and i
s used to dusting
 
itself off and ploughing on in whatever fashion appears most likely to produce
 
hopeful results.  We are used to
 
erfection.  We are used, also, to thinking
 
of things as temporary.  Many of my younger colleague , I find, do not realize
 
r
&I
 
how recent are the governmental agencies on which they so often now iopeiid.  The
 
Endowments are not quite twenty years old, and their utility is still being
 
'
jp1L
 
 
debated in the conservative press.  The Smithsonian Institution has only
 
been actively involved in folklife programs for 1
2 years.  The Folk Arts
 
Program at the Arts Endowment i
s only seven years old.  The American Folklife

My point i
s that these are recent institutional responses to long-
standing public needs.  Federally speahtng
., all these organizations are

xperiTnental, still to be proven, hopeful, and very,yery vulnerable.
 
Remember that the huge mechanism of the Works Progress Administration disappeared

 The federal government can be f
ickle.
 
I would urge you then to keep a kindly and watchful eye on the
 
government agencies that try to serve some of the needs of American traditional
 
communities.  With all our warts and spots and protuberances, we are still here
 
and s
till moving, but you could wake up some morning and f
ind us gone.  But
 
you would f
ind, I believe,
 that we had left a legacy, a legacy to which a
ll
 
the "programs related to folk culture" have contributed, a legacy that would
 
require us to be re-invented1perhaps in a better form, but a legacy that would
