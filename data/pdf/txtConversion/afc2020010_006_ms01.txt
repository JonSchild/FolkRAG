Transcript of Interview with Walter Mullins, October 9, 2020 
 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:00:05): 
Great. Okay. So I'm here with Walt Mullins. And we're here in Manchester, Kentucky. This is Ethan Sharp. 
It is--is it October the 9th? 
Walter (00:00:21): 
It is. 
Ethan (00:00:22): 
October the 9th, 2020. And you might want to, if you don't mind taking off your mask for the, just for the 
recorder. It's up to you. 
Walter (00:00:33): 
I'd rather not. We're required to keep them on in here. 
Ethan (00:00:38): 
Okay. You're fine. So you were gonna tell me a little bit about your, your, your background, you know, 
where you're born and where you grew up and how you got into this kind of work. 
Walter (00:00:52): 
Well, I am the program manager here at the Volunteers of America recovery community center. And I'm 
a person in long-term recovery from substance use disorder myself. And I think that's a good place to start 
because it all ties in together. Like we were talking about earlier, I began using drugs and taking alcohol 
when I was very young, probably about 14 years old. I first experimented with heroin when I was probably 
16, 17, and I had a 38 year journey with heroin and any other drug you can name and alcohol. It caused a 
whole lot of problems in my life. A lot of chaos. I became very depressed, I think, emotionally, even from 
very early on, you know. It was very troubling and the only way I could seem to escape from that was by 
taking more, using more. 
Walter (00:02:08): 
And it was just a vicious cycle. I ended up getting in quite a bit of trouble with the law in, in trying to 
supply, keep my supply up in the service of my addiction. Wound up in a treatment facility, probably the 
eighth treatment center I'd been to, in 2012. And it was a long-term men's recovery treatment facility in 
Cincinnati, Ohio. I stayed in treatment there for a year, and I lived in their transitional living that they had 
right there on the campus for another three years. And went back to college, finished my, got my degree 
in substance use counseling, substance use disorder counseling. And began working at that facility, yeah, 
first as a resident assistant, then as a case manager, and eventually as a counselor. So when, when this 
opportunity came open down here in Kentucky for this recovery community center, actually, I was working 
in Annville, Kentucky, at another residential treatment facility when this job came up. And I just, I couldn't 
say no. A recovery community center is, you know, it's a lot of people would say, that's, it's a dream job. 
And I'm one of them 
2 
 
Walter (00:03:46): 
Because what we get to do here is something that's somewhat new. It's certainly growing, and I believe 
it's extremely effective for a whole lot of reasons I can talk about, but that's a little bit about me. This 
program here is, it's been open for one year. We just celebrated our first year, and as we were discussing 
earlier, we do a whole lot of things here that are peer-based. The entire staff is, are peers. They're persons 
with lived experience in addiction, substance use disorder, and that have overcome that, you know, that 
are in recovery and, and they are here helping other people. 
Ethan (00:04:39): 
Yeah. Can you talk about a little, do you know a little bit about the history of how the organization came 
about? So you applied for the job, but there were already, it was already in the works, right? 
Walter (00:04:59): 
Well, Volunteers of America is a nonprofit based out of Louisville, and they do a whole lot. They, they 
work with the veterans, homeless people, people with disabilities. They work with addiction recovery 
services, and I believeâ€¦ 
Ethan (00:05:18): 
They were already active in Manchester? 
Walter (00:05:22): 
Well, I believe they were, a little bit over two years ago, they came down here and they were planning on 
building a women's residential treatment facility. I believe that was the initial idea. And because we're an 
underserved area, and the need is just fantastic. It's a desperate need. And they began collaborating with 
different community partners down here, other persons in the field, with the government, business 
leaders, the faith based community. And somehow, somewhere in the course of that action, they realized 
that there was a grant available for a recovery community center as well. And they just started. One thing 
led to another. And here we are. 
Ethan (00:06:19): 
So they just, you know, they got the grant, and then they just started advertising for folks to hire. 
Walter (00:06:26): 
Right, right, right. And actually we opened before the residential treatment facility for women opened, 
we opened about six or eight months before they did. 
Ethan (00:06:39): 
So they did open that? 
Walter (00:06:39): 
Oh, yes. Yes. That's, that's our sister program. Just down the road here. 
Ethan (00:06:45): 
3 
 
Yeah. Okay. So you do connect with the women who come out of that treatment facility. They do 
transition over here for services? 
Walter (00:06:57): 
They absolutely do. When they reach a certain point, a certain stage in their recovery, they come up here, 
and they interact with the peer support people, and they attend our 12 step meetings and other recovery 
support meetings and groups and activities that we have here. 
Ethan (00:07:18): 
I just wanted to go back for a minute. Just to talk about that transition for you, what kind of work did you 
do before you got into drug counseling? 
Walter (00:07:30): 
I was always in construction. I've had, I had a few sales jobs too. Which a sales job is not good for a person 
that's in addiction. I can tell you that, but we seem to gravitate to it. 
Ethan (00:07:47): 
How was that movement to drug counseling? What was that like for you? Did you feel a calling to do that? 
Or can you talk a little bit about that? 
Walter (00:08:00): 
I absolutely can. My counselor, this is quite a coincidence. He was born, probably, this was in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. He was born probably 12 miles from where we're sitting, right? He was from down here. And he 
passed away about three years ago, but he inspired me. He was one of a kind. One of a kind. He was a 
Vietnam veteran, and he at one time would have been a police officer. And he was a recovering alcoholic 
and drug addict. 
Ethan (00:08:35): 
And he went into the same field that you're in now. 
Walter (00:08:37): 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was, he worked as a counselor up there, where I went through treatment, for 
over 20 years. And I've never been able to find anybody that could relate, that I could relate to so well, 
and that understood me because he had been through the same exact thing. 
Ethan (00:08:58): 
Yeah. I think that, that's one of the things that you don't always find a counselor has the lived experience, 
you note that you do, or he did. 
Walter (00:09:08): 
To me, that was that was just a perfect fit. 
Ethan (00:09:13): 
4 
 
And when you were going through your training and you were working in Cincinnati, did, did you know 
about peer support, or was that a thing yet? Or a recovery community organization? 
Walter (00:09:24): 
I'm glad you mentioned that. Where I worked, they were pioneering this kind of thing 25 years ago. They 
didn't call it peer support, but it was exactly that. The guys that would graduate from that program and 
became members of their alumni association would come back to the treatment facility all the time, acting 
as peer support, not a sponsor, as you would hear. You know, 12 step programs have a sponsor. This was 
entirely, you know voluntary. They would act as peers. They would help the guys with their lived 
experience, you know, negotiate barriers and obstacles that you come up against. And they did the same, 
same exact kind of work. 
Ethan (00:10:24): 
Run meetings and things like that? 
Walter (00:10:26): 
Run meetings. Give guys rides. Help them. Talk to them about how you, you know, how your behavior 
should be and your appearance when you go apply for a job, you know. Helping them to, to plan and 
realize that we have to plan things in our lives and that we have, you know, a tendency to just jump off 
and, and act without thinking. That's one of the really big things in early recovery for, for people is that 
we, you know, we can make decisions that are really poor decisions without some guidance. And, and, 
and when you talk to somebody that's been through it and already made some of those mistakes, a lot of 
times that will sink in, and it'll make you slow down. 
Ethan (00:11:22): 
Yeah. I can see how that's important. I just want to ask you this, this comes up a lot. How do you make 
that distinction between sponsor and peer support specialist? 
Walter (00:11:34): 
That's a good one. That, that is, yeah, that is the hundred dollar question right there. A sponsor in my 
opinion--and I'm not, you know, I'm not the end all be all expert on this--a sponsor in a, in a traditional 12 
step fellowship program would be a person that assists you in walking through those 12 steps. It should 
be a very intimate relationship based entirely on trust. Should be, you know, ideally. And that person 
would be a guide to how one becomes involved in that particular 12 step fellowship. You know, hopefully 
showing them the benefits of it. Taking them to meetings, taking a person to meetings, taking them to 12 
step events and celebrations, that kind of thing. Introducing him to other people in the 12 step program. 
But the bottom line would be to assist that person in actually learning how to incorporate those 12 steps 
into their life as a program of recovery. Where a peer support would not necessarily be affiliated with that 
same 12 step program. A peer support person would hopefully be open to all pathways of recovery and 
be familiar with them, you know. In other words we, we, we know that everybody's different. People are 
individuals. However, I do believe we are far more alike than we have differences, if I've learned anything 
in this. And I've been doing this now for, well, I've been in recovery for a little over eight years. If I've 
learned anything, it's that human beings are far more similar than we are different. But it would still be 
some of the same things. Some of the things, they do have in common, peer support with you know, with 
a sponsor, you know. I mean, I've called my sponsor and asked him about things that, you know, like 
opening a bank account and what's the best way to, you know, should I, should I get a credit card? 
5 
 
Walter (00:14:10): 
You know, what kind of vehicle should I get? Should I, and because that was the person I trusted and I 
knew, and I had worked with. But again, when I went through treatment and, and I interacted with a lot 
of the persons that were acting in a peer support role, you know, and I might ask them those same kind 
of things. You know, I might get some direction and guidance from them on those same kind of things. 
Like, you know how, how did it go when you were, you know, decided to get into a relationship or not in 
early recovery? Some things like that, which you know, that's something that happens. That's realistic. 
That's what, and you sort of might be able to tell them what your experience looked like. And perhaps 
some things that you learned along the way with that. And of course, peer supports are also, should, 
should, and most of them do, know how to navigate things like, okay, if you've got a court, something 
going on with the legal system, peer support would be probably more an ideal, a better person to go to 
maybe than your sponsor. Or if you need some mental health help, maybe there's some depression 
cropping up that's, that's not just the fact that we're not taking drugs anymore. You know, itâ€™s something, 
something beyond that. And a peer support person, while not a trained mental health professional, they 
might be able to see some of these issues. 
Ethan (00:16:03): 
It's someone that's more plugged into other resources that are available and being able to direct that 
person to those resources. And did you also, when you were going through your training in Cincinnati, did 
you know learn, did they talk about recovery community organizations and recovery capital? Is that 
something... 
Walter (00:16:26): 
Yes, I took a whole course on that. I went to University of Cincinnati. 
New Speaker (00:16:34): 
Was that something that was important for you? 
New Speaker (00:16:34): 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought it was, I thought it was great. You know I think that it's like anything else. 
There has to be a process to it. There should be, you know, education. There should be boundaries. All 
these things. And if we put the, and I think we're still learning a whole lot about all this, I really do. I really 
do. 
Ethan (00:17:09): 
Because RCOs are kind of new, I mean, you know, I think that's something that's maybe taking off, but 
there's not a lot of them around. So I was curious, you know, how you first learned about it. 
Walter (00:17:25): 
Well, like I said, I, I took a course on this. And we talked about this a whole lot, and in some parts of the 
country, like, I think, in Vermont and Pennsylvania, they've been doing this for quite a while, and they 
really, you know, they've learned to be really good at it. But I think the most important thing is having 
supervision, boundaries, a clear definition of roles. You have to have people that are committed to it and 
committed to continue to learn about it. Because it is relatively new. It is relatively new. And, and as we 
know, you know, addiction, a substance use disorder is extremely complex, an extremely complex issue. 
6 
 
That counselors with years of experience and a lot of education are still baffled by it. I mean every day 
you're going to see things that are, you know, I don't understand this cause there's no explanation for it. 
A lot of it. You know, the human mind is, I don't know how much of it, how much of it, we know about, 
you know. I think a lot of times we think we know a lot more about it than we actually do. I think there's 
a lot more that we don't know, but I think that those roles, a peer support role and a counselor role, are 
not the same. They are not. And I think we're still learning exactly how, how peer supports and RCOs, you 
know, can, can serve folks the best way. 
Ethan (00:19:22): 
Yeah. Maybe we can come back to that. I did want to ask you, to give you a chance to talk about, so you, 
you moved down here, you said a couple of years ago, and you know, what is your sense of what's going 
on here in terms of the need for more services? I know there's a lot that's been in the press about, you 
know, the opioid epidemic and all of that, but from your perspective, what, what have you seen, you 
know, in Clay County and the surrounding counties? 
Walter (00:19:58): 
Well, you know, Ethan, like I told you, I've been coming down here for years and, and part of those years, 
and I'm talking 40, 50 years, part of that time, you know, I was in active addiction. And there was a time 
here when the Oxycontin was the really big issue, you know, back in the nineties. And what I see, and 
there's still, there's still a lot of that. There's still a lot of opioid use down here and misuse. The big thing 
that I see down here, that's an even bigger problem is methamphetamine. I think a lot of it comes, it's just 
so cheap, and it's just so abundant, you know. And, and most of the opioid use that I see or misuse is from 
Suboxone diversion, you know, improper use. It, it is rampant. And that might not be popular for some 
people to hear that. But it's the truth. It's something, you know, that I see every day. 
Ethan (00:21:24): 
It's easy, it's easier to get, I guess. 
Walter (00:21:29): 
It's, I mean, we could walk down the street and get one in about 10 minutes. I guarantee it and I don't 
even... 
Ethan (00:21:38): 
So you kind of saw that sort of that time when the prescription opioids, Oxycontin, and other things like 
that, you know, people were struggling with that. And then, then it sort of moved, you know, to other 
opioid use, and you sort of saw that happen in Clay County, and then now it's more an issue with what 
you're saying, with meth? 
Walter (00:22:00): 
Yeah. The meth and the Suboxone, because it's extremely cheap and it's so abundant. It's unbelievable. 
Ethan (00:22:09): 
And heroin, that's not so much an issue. 
Walter (00:22:12): 
7 
 
Not here. I mean, there's, there's heroin here and in the surrounding cities. We live in an area where we're 
about 20 miles from I-75. And there's London, Kentucky. And of course, Lexington. There's heroin in 
Lexington. And there's some here, you know, but overwhelmingly it's, it's Suboxone and other prescription 
opioids, and methamphetamine is just... 
Ethan (00:22:44): 
And in terms of resources, there's been a lack of treatment facilities, I don't know, from your perspective? 
Walter (00:22:56): 
I think there has been traditionally. I think in the last 10 years, there, there are several residential 
treatment facilities here. There have always been a couple over in Corbin. There's one that's been there 
for many years. Other than that, people had to go to Lexington. Now we have several within probably 20 
miles of here. Men's and women's over in London, Kentucky, which is about 22 miles from here. As far as 
residential treatment goes, there are several other providers in this area. There are, in Kentucky, there 
are far more residential treatment facilities than there used be. My organization, the Volunteers of 
America, as we talked about earlier, has just opened a brand new residential treatment facility for women 
and pregnant women and parenting women. About eight miles from here. 
Ethan (00:24:00): 
That's not the same one that you mentioned. Oh, it's the same one. 
Walter (00:24:06): 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's probably the biggest difference about it than others, that they do accept 
pregnant women and parenting women and women with small children. In other words, if they've got a 
two or three-year-old and a five-year-old, they come and live there at the residential treatment facility, 
which, which makes it quite unique. The thing is, not only here, but everywhere is that's, that's fine, that's 
great, residential treatment, if we're talking about 30, 60, or 90 days, is like going to the emergency room. 
We stopped the bleeding, and we set, we set the bones. Unfortunately, all too often after a person 
completes that phase of treatment, they're sent back into the community, back to the same place where 
they used to live, the same friends, little or no support, not any real support, not recovery support, not 
meaningful support. And without that, if, if you've just gone to the emergency room, say if you've got a 
broken leg and you go to the emergency room and you get it set, you know, temporarily, and they turn 
you, they let you go, and you don't go back and go to an orthopedic surgeon, you're in trouble. And that 
is exactly why we need places like this. Ongoing recovery support. And in a place, in a rural area like this, 
possibly even more important because in larger cities, you do have a lot of 12 step programs. You do have 
more mental health counseling. You do have an opportunity to get connected and get involved in some 
sort of ongoing recovery support, other than going back and seeing your probation officer. Because 
addiction, if you're on probation, say a person goes to the court ordered treatment, if they have a severe 
addiction or alcohol use disorder, knowing that I'm on probation really doesn't mean anything. The only 
thing that matters is getting more of the only thing I know that brings me some relief, and that takes a 
long time for that to start to change. For that obsession to go away. For that compulsion to begin to ease, 
to begin to develop a new identity, which I believe those are the vital elements in recovery. You know, 
and I need help. People need help, and ongoing long-term support for that. And that's why the transitional 
living safe, transitional living, sober living as they call it... 
Ethan (00:27:19): 
8 
 
Do they have facilities here? 
Walter (00:27:20): 
We do. Not enough. Not enough. Volunteers America is working on opening up their transitional living 
facility next to the treatment facility they just opened. And they're actually working on more long-term as 
we speak. They're, they're, they're trying to get some properties here in Manchester. But I actually know 
some people that just opened another sober living this week here in Manchester. There's a, there's a 
couple in London, Kentucky, but the demand exceeds the supply. 
Ethan (00:28:08): 
I was going to ask you how, so you, you mentioned that you, you know, so the women who are coming 
out of that treatment, you know, some of them transitioned over here for your services. What has been 
the response with other, I mean, how do you connect with other organizations or the courts, or how's 
that, how's that taking place so that they could, you know, be aware of the need for an RCO and what you 
offer? 
Walter (00:28:37): 
We, we talk to them. 
Ethan (00:28:37): 
How does that go? 
Walter (00:28:41): 
You know, usually very good, usually very good. I think what's happened that's so amazing, and the 
recovery oriented systems of care that have been developed, starting with your primary physician and all 
the ways, there's far more awareness of this issue as a public health issue, rather than a moral issue. Or 
you know, even when a person gets, certainly addiction, alcoholism and substance use disorder has an 
effect on our morals, you know, our behavior is, is impacted greatly, usually not for the good. And people 
go to any lengths to get that next fix or next drink, a lot of times, and people behave poorly when they're 
under the influence. So we have an intersection there with the--you're going to run into the criminal 
justice system a lot. It's just, just a fact 
Ethan (00:29:49): 
They do have a drug court program in Clay County? 
Speaker 3 (00:29:52): 
Yes, sir. And I believe that the courts, the whole court system is far more aware and willing to do 
something, you know, interventions, if you know, where appropriate, where appropriate. And we've 
talked to the local folks here, the drug courts, other treatment providers. We have relationships with other 
residential treatment facilities here in this area. And they know about us, and they refer their guys and 
gals to come here and they do. And pre-COVID, we were having several of them bring their people here 
on like a weekend in a van to attend meetings, to attend some of the groups that we did, some of the 
events, the celebrations, recovery celebrations, cookouts, that kind of thing, where they could, you know, 
sort of get their feet wet, so to speak, and get to find out what we're doing here. And if they're from 
9 
 
another part of the state, you know, we try to let them know that there are other recovery community 
centers in different parts of the state.  
Ethan (00:31:05): 
So maybe we can sort of walk through the kinds of things that you do here. And what are the services that 
you provide? So you talked about, you know, the celebrations and those kinds of events. And I know 
you've mentioned things here and there. I just wanted to kind of give you an opportunity to give the 
rundown, like, what are the things, and maybe some pre-COVID and some--with all the restrictions, I know 
it's changed a lot. 
Walter (00:31:37): 
It is. It has. But I'm glad you mentioned that again, too, because we have found when COVID, when we 
were under, you know, the early restrictions, and people were really extremely frightened--addiction is a 
disease of disconnection and isolation, not good to have to stay home and stay away from your friends 
and your, you know, other events. Even going to, you know, going out to the park, you know, that was 
taboo, you know, that was not allowed. And I think that is especially a bad thing for our folks. So, what we 
did is, realizing that, we opened, we opened back up for in-person services after about, I believe, we were 
shut down here for about six weeks. And then we began to have in-person services, limited number, of 
course, incorporating the masks and social distancing. The cleaning and all that kind of thing And our 
parent organization was really good about. They saw that need. Just, you know, overdose numbers were 
going up, other things associated with, you know, the lack of an ongoing recovery support. We did a lot 
of virtual stuff, and we still do some of it. We're still doing about four to five meetings a week online, but 
we're doing, we do, we do sort of a joint thing. We'll have, we'll have it online, but there will actually be 
an in-person meeting here too. We're limited to only having like 12 people in the building. But because 
we've had such nice warm weather, we've been outside and doing a lot of our stuff outside. 
Walter (00:33:56): 
But to answer your question about the different services, we do a whole lot of other things. We do 
smoking cessation. We collaborate with the local hospital up here, AdventHealth hospital. And they have 
a program, American Lung Association Freedom from Smoking. And we have a guy that comes down here 
from the hospital. Now he's doing it virtually for us, but he has come down and done it, you know, in 
person too in the past. But now we're actually right in the middle of one of our courses on that. It's like a 
seven week course, which is extremely, there's a huge need for that. Oh, yeah. I'm one of the, I'm one of 
the students. Yes, I am. 
Walter (00:34:50): 
We do, we do, we have Narcan trainings down here. The health department comes down, and you know, 
we have a lot of family members. And even though I said, you know, the most prevalent drug of no-choice 
down here is the methamphetamine. There is still opioids. There are still opioids. And it's still here. And 
people still overdose. And so that's, that's something we think is real important too. We do a lot of just 
public education. We have, we have a family group here that we do. I was doing just a substance use 
disorder education class in-person class for some of the other, there were some IOP's up here that were 
sending their folks down here. And I am a certified alcohol and drug counselor, so I can do some of that. 
But we've, we've kind of slacked off on that since COVID. And we do family education. We do relapse 
prevention groups, which are again, it's sort of like what I do, it's part of my role. But the peer support 
folks that I have here, I have three peer support folks. They, they assist with that. My peer support folks 
10 
 
go out to the needle exchange once a week with the health department. And we go to a mobile location 
way out in the rural part of the county. You think this is rural. You gotta see where they go for that. I mean, 
it's, it's out in the sticks, Ethan. They take a mobile needle exchange out to a place that really needs it, you 
know. The HIV and hepatitis C numbers in this county are not good, and that's a big reason for it. 
Ethan (00:36:58): 
And so they're there just to say, you know, just to let them know about your services, to establish that 
contact. 
Walter (00:37:08): 
That's, that's exactly right. And you know, in a non-confrontational way, you know, a nonjudgmental way, 
the peer support, when the folks come to get their, their syringes, they give them a piece of literature and 
just explain to them that, you know, there are alternatives. There is help available. And as much, or as 
little as that person wants to interact with the peer support, they're there. They'll stay with them and talk 
to them for two hours, and if the person doesn't want to talk at all, that's fine too. But we do hopefully 
plant a seed and let folks know that, you know, here, I've been there, I've done exactly what you've done. 
You know, I've come to the needle exchange. I've, I've been to the methadone clinic, you know. I've, I've 
stolen out of my mother's purse to get my next fix. And, and, and I don't have to do that anymore. 
Basically, that's the message. 
Ethan (00:38:10): 
Yeah. I just do want to ask real quick, the different meetings, and you said that you had the family meeting, 
are those 12 step meetings, are they, or do you have sort of a variety of meetings to choose from? 
Walter (00:38:24): 
Good question. Good question. Boy, you're good at this because, I mean, you're hitting on stuff that's 
extremely relevant. The things that we do, we do a family group that is not 12 step based. It's just 
educational. 
Ethan (00:38:41): 
It's not AlAnon. 
Walter (00:38:41): 
And we do, we do have Alanon meetings here. We have actually a lady that came down here pre-COVID. 
She's in her seventies. So she's at really high risk. Cause she's got a couple of other health issues going on, 
and she had been involved in Alanon for 30 years. So she was very knowledgeable, and she was facilitating 
those AlAnon meetings. But now we have other volunteers. We have one weekly. 
Ethan (00:39:14): 
And then you have the family educational meetings in addition to that, and then the other meetings, or 
just to make sure, are all sort of different. 
Walter (00:39:26): 
11 
 
Well, yeah, yeah. We host, there are AA groups that we host here. We host the narcotics anonymous 
group here. We, we have an MAT support group that has not been very well attended. We have reached 
out to... 
Ethan (00:39:50): 
Is there resistance to MAT in the community? 
Walter (00:39:55): 
Well, I don't think so. I don't think there's a resistance to it any more than there is in any other community, 
you know. You know, we know that MAT has its place. And if it's, if it's done right, and it's administered, 
right. And, and there's, and again, if it's the M-A-T, assisted treatment, we know that it works. It can be a 
very helpful tool. I believe that there's, there is quite a bit of resistance to it, not just here, but everywhere. 
And the reason for that is because a lot of times it's, it's diverted. And it's not used properly. And it is 
misused. And that's a shame. But as far as supporting folks that are, choose the MAT pathway, you know, 
we're 100% dedicated to that and committed to that, to assisting them. And we've reached out to some 
of the providers, and repeatedly in fact, and let them know that we do do MAT support group here. But 
as of yet, it has been, the response to, it has not been what we'd like to see. I know other areas have had 
different levels of success with that. 
Ethan (00:41:23): 
Yeah. I was just curious, because you had mentioned the issue with Suboxone before, and you know, sort 
of where people stood on that. 
Walter (00:41:33): 
I think it's the same thing. It was the same way in Cincinnati. There are a lot of people that are vehemently 
opposed to it. And you know, they can make a pretty good argument for reasons why, and then there are 
other folks that can say, well, here, I can point to some successes. And it's evidence-based. And you know, 
I'll leave that, like where it is. 
Ethan (00:41:58): 
So folks can also come and hang out. So, I mean, I mean, maybe, maybe not so much as, before you also 
have this space for hanging out? 
Walter (00:42:11): 
Yeah. We got one of our guys right out there right now eating a donut. I'm watching. He just walked in. 
He gets a cup. 
Walter (00:42:19): 
Yeah. Yeah. They just, we have, we have a whole that's, that's another big part of it is the whole 
socialization and learning to just, that folks have a place here where they feel safe. They know they're not 
being judged, and they're coming down and meeting people that are doing the same thing that they are, 
you know, just doing whatever they can to have a better life, a changed life. We have a guy right there I'm 
looking at out the window. He's a, he's been in recovery for 30 years. He just had his 30 year celebration. 
Walter (00:42:54): 
12 
 
Yeah. He's a Vietnam veteran. And he still, he still comes down here. And he basically comes down here 
to help the new people. He likes to come and socialize too. But we, we have like nights where we'll have 
basketball or football games. On the weekends, we'll have those. So folks, you know, instead of going to 
the sports bar, they can come here and, you know, cheer on the Wildcats or the Louisville Cardinals, God 
forbid. I'm just kidding. 
Walter (00:43:33): 
We, you know, they have a blast. We have cookouts. We have, again, like what, one thing that was really 
popular last Christmas, is we had a Christmas ornament group. And they came down about, you know, 
the four or five weeks prior to Christmas, and some of the ladies were teaching the other ones how to 
make Christmas ornaments, and they had cookies and eggnog and all that kind of thing. And it's a place 
for that. 
Ethan (00:44:03): 
Yeah. That's, that's how, that's how it's supposed to be. I was going to ask, you do also meet with folks 
one on one, right? You do. And the peer support specialists? 
Walter (00:44:15): 
Yeah. 
Ethan (00:44:18): 
Is that when folks come in, and do you sort of set up a schedule for that? Or is that just as needed, or how, 
how does that work here? 
Walter (00:44:31): 
It's as needed. We, we have sort of a little intake process that we do as part of our, part of our grant and 
part of our funding. That's, it's meant to gather information about the opioid crisis, the opioid use. So we'll 
do... 
Ethan (00:44:52): 
That's the KORE grant? 
Walter (00:44:53): 
Yeah. We do, we do a little assessment on folks that have had opioid use disorder, but we do an intake on 
everybody, just a little brief intake, and it is 100% voluntary. They, nobody has to do anything. You don't 
have to fill out any paperwork here. You don't even have to tell us your name. We don't care. But if folks 
do, and we, and we let them know this is to help with funding and research, which are, which are 
important. And 99% of the folks are good with that. But you know, if, if, as we get to know these folks 
and, you know, they get to know us and the trust, a little bit of trust begins to build. And, and the peer 
support folks that that work here are all from this area. And they know, this being a small, rural area, a lot 
of them know each other. And when they see this person that they may be even used to use with, or 
drank with, you know eight or ten years ago on a new pathway, going back to school, you know, working 
full time, having a relationship with their family, you know, and not, not showing up in the newspaper, 
they want to connect with them. And they come in here, and they talk to them and they do recovery 
coaching with those folks. And again, that's, that's, I guess the, the core duty of a peer support personnel 
13 
 
is doing the recovery coaching, and you know, and I do some of that too. I mean, I'm, I'm a counselor here, 
but I don't do, I don't do any like clinical counseling here. 
Ethan (00:46:48): 
That's what you had done before, and you kind of moved away from that. 
Walter (00:46:50): 
Yeah. Well, yeah, in this role, you know, it's not really, that's not what we're here for. I act more as a 
supervisor to the peer support folks. You know, I do a lot of the paperwork, a lot of the reports, the grants 
and things like that. And I just, you know, make sure that the facility is operating, like it should be. And 
some things that you know, you need to watch out for, make sure that the boundaries are being kept, and 
those kinds of things. And we refer, if we need to refer somebody for, you know, some mental health 
counseling or some substance use counseling, we do that. We refer a lot of people to treatment. That's 
one of our biggest things, Ethan, is residential treatment. Folks now that they have this place to gravitate 
to, and they know it's about recovery, and they might not know exactly what we do here, but they do 
know the basic idea. And this wasn't here three years ago. It wasn't here two years ago, and a lot of people 
are, and they talk about it. And they see it, and they know each other, "And, oh, what happened to John?" 
"Well, he's been going down there to that place and they helped him get into treatment." And that's, 
what's going on. I think we've-- 
Ethan (00:48:19): 
People just walk in sometimes and just say, where should I go? 
Walter (00:48:26): 
Yeah. I would say once a week. Yeah, we've referred. And then a lot of times, it'll be a family member 
calling, or somebody will call, or the social worker will call, or a boss, an employer will call and say, "Hey, 
I got a person that's looking for some help." I think we've referred over 90 people to residential treatment 
and actually gotten them into the treatment facility. Not just, here's a phone number, you know. We'll 
help them walk through, getting into it and getting into a program. 
Ethan (00:49:04): 
Are there ones, particular ones that you work with? 
Walter (00:49:08): 
Yes, we work with ARC, Addiction Recovery Services. We work with Recovery Works over in London. We 
work with another, Cumberland River, and we'll work, we'll work with any, any, you know, good 
residential treatment facility, wherever we can get a person. We've got folks into treatment in Louisville 
and Lexington and Falmouth. I think we've even helped a couple get into treatment out in, in Western 
Kentucky. You know wherever we can get them a place. 
Ethan (00:49:53): 
Then do you follow up with them sometimes and say, you know, "Once you're done with that, come back 
here?" 
Walter (00:50:03): 
14 
 
Yeah. And we do, and we tell them, "You know when you get out of there." Now, we, we, because of, you 
know, HIPAA and all that, you know, we don't contact them while they're actually in the treatment facility 
and do that. But we would talk to the provider and let them know, they would know that we're here. And 
if that person moves back here, it might be good idea if they come and see us again. 
Ethan (00:50:31): 
Yeah, I did want to come back to that question of roles and boundaries. I guess, cause I'm not quite sure 
what you're, what is it, is it making sure that--I'm not sure what you meant by that? For exampleâ€¦ 
Walter (00:51:00): 
Well, no, no. Well, boundaries would be like if a person came in here for services and you knew, and you 
knew their family, you probably wouldn't want to treat them any different than you would another 
person. That's one. We would, we would want to make sure that you don't have any, another relationship 
with this person, a dual relationship. For example, if a person comes in here, and I'm acting as a peer 
support person to that individual, I probably wouldn't want to go buy a used car from them, or sell them 
a car, or get into any kind of business relationship. Or romantic relationship, or even a romantic 
relationship with someone in their family. That kind of thing. You know that's, that's just... 
Ethan (00:51:59): 
It's kind of a smaller community, so that, that can happen. 
Walter (00:52:06): 
Right. And confidentiality too. I mean, that's, that's, you know, in the role of the peer support person, you 
take on, you take that, you know, the confidentiality is a part of it. And especially this being a smaller 
town, you know, I certainly would not like one of my peer support folks talking to somebody down at the 
corner store about who just came in and told them that, you know, "Hey, I've been doing heroin for three 
years, and nobody knows about it, but I can't keep it a secret anymore." You know, those sorts of things. 
And that happens, that happens a lot, those, those kinds of things, and people will come in, and you know, 
and they'll talk about things that are meant to be confidential. Also roles, again, I wouldn't want to have 
one of my peer support folks give their participants, any medical advice or any mental health advice or 
any legal advice. What they would do--and see that's, that's where, again, we're, we're learning all the 
time--is they can make suggestions about where you could go and how to get in contact with the proper 
person to, to address that issue. 
Ethan (00:53:27): 
Yeah. That's good. I think at first I was, I was thinking that you're trying to make clear, what's the difference 
between drug counselor and a peer support specialist, but you're not really doing any, counseling is not a 
big major part of your job? 
Walter (00:53:51): 
So, no. Not in this role, not what I'm doing here. I see what you're saying. I act more as a supervisor and a 
guide and a planner for this, for this facility, you know. I hopefully work with my staff to come up with 
ideas for, for good activities, good groups you know, some of it, I'm, I'm trained to run a group, to facilitate 
a group on, you know, family education. I wouldn't, I wouldn't come in and try to be, well, first of all I'm 
not credentialed to do family counseling. You have to be a licensed counselor to do that. But I can do, 
certainly, I can do family education. Talk to a family member. Talk to a group of, of family members and 
15 
 
just do some presentation, education type things. And I do that, you know. I do that. But I don't, I don't 
do any clinical services here in other words. 
Ethan (00:55:05): 
Do you miss not being able to do that. Or you feel like you're [inaudible]... 
Walter (00:55:15): 
If I was working at a residential treatment facility, you know, I would be doing assessments on people, 
and I would be doing individual counseling with them once a week, at least. I would be doing groups with 
the same people, you know, every day. I would, I would be doing documentation on this person. I would 
be checking their mental health status. If they had, if they had a co-occurring issue going on, I would be 
conferring with their mental health provider, you know, helping refer them to the right mental health 
provider and working out a treatment plan, which is clinical in nature, you know. And, and just having a 
whole plan for that person in, in a large context of their, you know, immediate treatment plan or their 
long-term. All that kind of thing. Here it's all based on recovery support. Most, most of the time, our folks, 
most of the people that come here, have already gone through treatment. They've already gone through 
that clinical phase. And this is sort of the next phase after treatment, where we actually start to put what 
we learned or began to learn in treatment into action. 
Ethan (00:56:47): 
Yeah. I was just curious if you have that experience and, you know, wondering if you sort of miss not being 
able to do that kind of work anymore. Or if you feel like this is sort of the next step for you? 
Walter (00:57:09): 
Well, I mean I enjoyed it. I enjoyed doing that a whole lot. You, you look at a comprehensive approach to 
assisting a person, from the day they get into a treatment facility to the time they graduate. It's very 
challenging and extremely rewarding, and it's a lot different than this. This is more, how would you call it, 
it's more of a casual type of relationship with folks, you know. We're not confrontational, whereas a 
substance use disorder counselor, that's something that they would, a lot of them, especially depending 
on their style, you know, that's something that they use. And they--no matter what anybody says. And I 
mean, I would be setting rules. I'd be actually basically in charge of that person's entire life, where they 
can go, when they can go. 
Walter (00:58:14): 
You know, even though, you know, they say that that's supposedly changing. And it's more of an 
interaction, and you know, more of a collaboration between the counselor and the resident. But in my 
experience, you don't actually, that is not the way it plays out, and for good reason, for real good reason. 
You know, a good counselor knows that. That's, they're basically in charge of that person's life. That's why 
they have to have so much training and supervision. 
Ethan (00:58:55): 
Well, I just had maybe two or three more questions, quick questions. Sort of to follow up on that, so one 
of the questions that we've been asking is what are some issues with peer support specialists? Because it 
is new, relatively new, I mean, I know they've been around a long time, but there's a lot more people 
coming on board as peer support specialists. And I don't know, we could just talk generally about, you 
know, some issues or challenges that you think need to be worked out. 
16 
 
Walter (00:59:33): 
Well, I think that, first of all, if you are using, utilizing peer support personnel in a residential setting, you 
have to be extremely careful. You know, even a peer support person does have, if they have any authority 
over another resident in a residential treatment facility, that can go south really quickly, and I've seen that 
happen. The way that would have to be done is with extremely comprehensive supervision and the roles 
defined very clearly. In other words, again, you know, the counselor, maybe it's more of an authoritarian 
job. You know, the peer support should be an assistant, up here, not a boss, not somebody with the--and 
there's, there's, there's different roles there. You have a peer support person that may be working in a 
treatment facility, learning how to be a case manager, or learning how to be a counselor at some point 
maybe, and they're going to school, and they can collaborate with the counselor that's working there and, 
and, you know, learn from them. 
Walter (01:01:08): 
But you know, those, those are things that can be really, really troublesome. Because a lot of times, they'll 
make mistakes, and they can make a big mistake with a person in, in a residential treatment facility. And 
talking, some of the things that they might share about other clients with a client, or talk about my 
counselor's doing this to me, you know, blah, blah, blah. And just a whole lot of things can--they're not 
counselors. And if they're being used in a residential place, they need to have extremely strong supervision 
and very well-defined roles. Another thing is peer support folks don't need to be overworked. They are in 
early recovery, most of them, themselves. They're still learning how to make good decisions themselves. 
A lot of them. And you've got some peer support folks that are, you know, they've, they've been 5, 6, 3, 8 
years into their own recovery. And you know, that's, they have learned to make better decisions and 
handle stress and be able to cope with it and cope with some of the things that we see. You know, we run 
into a lot of situations where we're dealing with people that are extremely ill and extremely vulnerable, 
extremely vulnerable. And that's the reason why you have to have a professional license, you know, to, 
to be able to deal with these folks. And so, again, I think it goes down to really good supervision, good 
training, ongoing training, and defined roles and not--making really sure that the peer support folks 
themselves are all right, cause they're gonna make mistakes. They're gonna make a lot of mistakes, to be 
quite frank. And, and I know a lot of counselors that I've spoken with, especially early on, that were dead 
set against the whole peer support thing, especially as--what they tend to, what they used to say is that 
they would try to act like a mini counselor, you know. And just some, some things that you have to be 
really careful about. I think you get the basic idea. 
Ethan (01:03:48): 
No, I know. I know. And the training, I think, may be improving a little bit--I don't know if you sort of see 
that. You know, I think there's a lot of training, like you're saying, needs to take place in the workplace. 
But there's also, I don't know how you feel about the training. 
Walter (01:04:15): 
Well, I think they're working on it. I think what happened, this is just what I saw, I saw a whole lot of 
people wanting to be peer support at places. And I saw a lot of places cropping up that gave the training 
and, you know, I didn't go out and check them all out and see who was, you know, what training was 
what. I'm sure there's some places that are giving really, really good training. I'm sure there are. I think 
that they're, they're improving that, the curriculum, and I believe that ongoing training is, is just absolutely 
paramount, you know. Ongoing, and they're required. They're required to have continuing CEU's. And our 
17 
 
folks here go to trainings a lot. And, and they, they are supervised by a licensed counselor, you know, that 
provides the supervision for them. 
Ethan (01:05:14): 
Well, just two quick questions. And when you do the intake, you were talking about the intake that you 
do, do you, do you do the recovery capital assessment? 
Walter (01:05:24): 
Oh, yeah. We do recovery capital scale. Usually the second time a person comes in. Maybe the, maybe 
the third, because you know, the first time we don't like to overwhelm them with paperwork right here. 
"I just got out of treatment. Now, you guys are going to throw a bunch of more questions at me. And they 
asked me a bunch of, gave me, I filled out forms there till I was blue in the face." And they do. And, you 
know, and you're, you're prodded and picked over and, you know, diagnosed and, and we try to keep it 
nonclinical. That's what I mean by more nonclinical services.  
Ethan (01:06:01): 
But you do collect that data and do some follow-up assessments? 
Speaker 3 (01:06:05): 
We do, we do a follow-up with the recovery capital scale after about six months. Someone suggested that 
we do one after three months. I've hardly ever seen anybody improve enough--three months in recovery 
is just nothing. Recovery is, it moves at a very slow pace, and it's not linear either. You know, a lot of times. 
But a recovery capital scale seems to be a good tool to get a good, good overall basic idea. 
Ethan (01:06:47): 
Yeah. Just out of curiosity. And that's not something that sort of you keep. It's, you also do share that with 
the person and go over with them and show, show them, where are their gaps--I was just curious. 
Walter (01:07:04): 
Oh, yeah. Ideally--and you're exactly right--and that's what it is, the whole thing. The recovery capital 
scale, for a lot of people that don't know, is it covers all areas of our lives. You know, it'll, it'll call it, how 
do we get out, what are our human capital, our personal capital, and it talks about our health. It talks 
about our mental health. It talks about our ability to interact with other people. And of course, we need 
to have, you know, our financial wellbeing. We have to have, people need resources to interact in the 
world, you know, and they are broken into those various segments. And a person can, we can look at it 
and see if this person's physical capital is, is, is quite low. What can we, what can we do to help them, you 
know, maybe a meditation class. Oh, we do meditation classes here too. Oh, Ethan, before COVID, we had 
a lady that worked--there's a federal prison here in Manchester. She worked up there as a counselor for 
years, I don't want to say, I think it was 18 years, and she is somebody you wouldn't expect to see in 
Manchester, Kentucky. She's very Zen. I think she freaked some people out. But she is, she is one of the, 
she's one of the people--I know a lot of people that are really into meditation, and she is one of those. 
And she's able to transmit the value of meditation and get you excited about it. And she used to come 
down here and do groups and they were becoming more, more and more people were coming to her 
group. 
Ethan (01:08:51): 
18 
 
I want to check that out. 
Walter (01:08:51): 
And she's about two miles down the road. 
Ethan (01:08:52): 
But she stopped because of... 
Walter (01:08:57): 
COVID. And, and not so much, I think she would have come herself to do a small group, but she's been 
overwhelmed. Because since COVID, she does a lot of individual counseling for folks, and the department 
of corrections has sent, she does contracts with them, and just other people, you know, just from the 
stress and associated fears and anxieties that come along with this COVID. And she has been swamped. 
And she's really about the only game in town right here, but she happens to be, she happens to be top 
notch. She's one of the best counselors I've ever seen. 
Ethan (01:09:50): 
I just wanted to ask you about, you know, where, you know, where you see things going. I know you've 
got the grant. I don't know how long that lasts. And you know, what do you see, beyond the grant, any 
new things coming down the pike. Sort of looking towards the future, what does that look like? 
Walter (01:10:10): 
That's a great question. The Department of Behavioral Health, we just found out they are going to extend 
our funding, I think for another year. I think we're through right now, we were through funded through 
December, but they're going to extend it for another year. They are actually putting bids out right now to 
have two more recovery community centers opened in the state of Kentucky. Which is again, we wonder 
why people go to treatment. They, they go, they, they stay 90 days. They get out of treatment. I don't care 
if you're in Manchester or Louisville or Lexington. And then we see them two weeks later, and they're 
right back in the bad shape again. Why is that? And, and we used to say, well, people, you know, the 
whole, a lot of the general thinking sort of looked like, well, treatment, isn't working. They're not doing 
treatment right. We need to go back and completely change the way we do treatment. No! The people 
that had been doing treatment and running treatment facilities for 10, 15, 20, 30 years know what they're 
doing. They have learned it the hard way, back before they were given all this Medicare money away, or 
Medicaid money away. There were people that were dedicated to this, and they weren't making any 
money. They were, they were doing it for, you know, $12,000 a year and working 60 hours a week. And 
they know what they're doing. The treatment, there's nothing wrong with treatment. It's, it's the duration 
of treatment. In my opinion, for persons that are severely impacted by substance use disorder, it should 
be a minimum, a minimum of six months, probably a year. And after that, the after, the ongoing recovery 
support, you know, it, it is the missing part of this. That's what we haven't had. 
Walter (01:12:22): 
And we're, this is beginning to take hold. And of course, it costs money. It costs money, but we say, how 
much money are we going to save? If we, we keep, help a person that maybe otherwise was gonna have 
a 20 year long history, continued history of using and getting in trouble with the law and health problems 
that develop over the years, and all of that. I mean, this is this, this kind of thing. The response we've seen 
here is amazing. I've seen many, many nights before COVID, we'd come in here, and there was 50 people 
19 
 
here that we would come to attend an AA or an NA meeting, or just one of the cookouts. And the people 
that come here, they're committed to it. And, and, I really believe that the whole community--again, we've 
only been open a year--the whole community becomes involved and aware. The stigma, we reduce the 
stigma, stigma. It's not, you know, it is a medical, it is a mental issue. It's a public health issue. And it has 
a spiritual side to it. But without a doubt, you know, anytime we do things that go against our values and 
our own belief system, and we lose the identity of our, you know, and lose contact and connection with 
our own inner self, you know, my inner self. I've lost it. And that is, there's nothing more traumatic than 
that. That's a spiritual wound. So there's a spiritual element to it too, and that's why this connection, 
building connection, ongoing connection, support, knowing that I have a place to go to, where I can feel 
safe, you know, where I can get some help and help others. So, yeah. We're... 
Ethan (01:14:37): 
So you, you see a bright future for recovery community centers. I mean, they will, you know, the need, 
they're beginning to recognize the need, and they will likely continue. 
Walter (01:14:48): 
I, you know, I hope it, I hope it's there. I remember, I remember a time when our national will was not 
harnessed in an effort to really make a difference in assisting people with substance use disorder. I can 
remember a time when that wasn't much of a priority. That's changed. That's changed. And I just, I hope 
that we keep the commitment. The war on drugs, so to speak, you see that that's never going to be won. 
No one can win that war. That's an unwinnable war. And that's, the way, that whole approach was flawed. 
And we've seen that. I worked with so many law enforcement people when I was a counselor up in 
Cincinnati that were dedicated, I mean, really dedicated to doing, helping with this kind of work, and 
getting involved in it, because they're the ones that see it every day. They see the, you know, the waste, 
the tremendous waste. And, and they began to realize that the, the approach they were taking was, it 
was, it was improper. And so, you know, I hope that there's still funding for it. There's public funding for 
it. Sure, like any other good cause, we, we accept, you know, donations. Hopefully business would help, 
but I think that we need public funding for these kinds of things. And I think it's a good investment. 
Ethan (01:16:34): 
Okay. Well, let's, let's end it there if that's okay. 
Walter (01:16:37): 
Is there anything else that you want to share? I'm sure we could talk all day. 
Walter (01:16:42): 
I so much appreciate you coming down here, and somebody, again, it just shows somebody having an 
interest that this is something that means something to folks.
