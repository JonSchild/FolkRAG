Sweet Mary, Weep no more for Me *The moon had climbed the highest hillThat rises over the source
of Dee,And from her eastern summit shedHer silvery light o'er tower and tree.When Mary laid her
down to sleep,Her thoughts were far on Sands at sea,And soft and low a voice she heardSaying,
"Mary, weep no more for me."She from her pillow softly raisedHer head to see who there might
be,And saw young Sandy shivering standWith pallid cheek and hollowed eye."Oh, maiden dear, cold
is my clay;It lies beneath yon stormy sea.The storm is past, and I at rest,Sweet Mary, weep no more
for me."Three stormy nights and stormy days,We tossed upon the raging main,And long we strove
our barque to save,But all our striving was in vain."E'en when cold horror chilled my blood,My heart
was filled with love for thee.The storm is past, and I at rest,Sweet Mary, weep no more for me."Oh,
maiden dear, thyself prepare,We soon shall meet upon that shoreWhere love is free from every
care,And thou and I shall part no more."Loud crew the cock, the shadow flew;No more of Sandy
could she see.Afast the passing spirit said,"Sweet Mary, weep no more for me." **

When Mary Laid Her Down to Sleep *When Mary laid her down to sleep,Her thoughts were far on
Sandys at sea.She from her pillow softly raisedHer head to see who there might be.When soft and
low a voice she heardSaying, "Mary, weep no more for me.Oh, maiden dear, thyself prepare,We
soon shall meet upon that shoreWhere love is free from every care,And thou and I shall part no
more."Loud crew the cock, the shadow flew,No more of Sandys could she see.And fast the passing
spirit said,"Sweet Mary, weep no more for me."
* Mr. Graham sang another version of this song, but under the title SweetMary, Weep no more for
Me.
