WE TAKE 'EM IN. 
Am —" Gens d'Armes Duet." 
Two policemen on the beat are we, 
Dressed in nice warm winter clothe; 
And we're strictly temperate, you see, 
You can tell it by our nose. 
We watch little boys upon the street, 
And when they to fight begin, 
We take ' em in, (
Repeat twice.) 
For they are not strong, you know, 
We take ' em in, (Repeat twice.) 
But the big rascals we let go. 
Woodhull and Claflin good folks condemn, 
For they've blood upon the brain; 
But, George Francis Train, he comforts then 
And keeps them on good champagne. 
Now if they get out and come to us, 
And wash them of their sin, 
We'll take em in, (Repeat twice.) 
And show them something funny; 
We'll take 'em in, (Repeat twiL•e.) 
And we don't want any blood- money. 
We are much obliged for your appla*.ise, 
And we're glad you like our son7 ; 
But our voices are about used up because 
Oar throats are not very strong. 
Some other night when you come this way, 
With your pockets full of tin, 
We'll take you in ; (Repeat Twice.) 
So you should let us off, we think-. 
We must away, 
We cannot stay, 
We must obey, 
Our orders say 
That we must go and take a 
drink. 
Oh, dear, rm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat 
I 
fancy' myself carving, 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose! 
C1101-113. 
For it Is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingtm, 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
Goose with sage and ingua. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is .my opinion, 53c. 
I've liver tried and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's- head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling. 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
Ms not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to Goose!

As years rolled on I 
grew to be 
A 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport, 
It was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, 
When oft times well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then, 
And thus has me advised :—CHo. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, 
I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, 
Bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly, 
My losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice 
Kept whispering in my ear :—Crto. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, 
And found, to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking 
Very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance, and always struck 
The iron while 'twits hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities 
And never once forgot :—Cao. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
We 
live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, 
As they prattle round my knee :—Cro.

FRIENDS THAT STAND BY US. 
Written and sung with great success by W M. Counrnicrrr. 
Now, then, subjects for songs nowadays are so scarce, 
And to find one I've looked far and near every day; 
And the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For it's something like looking for needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as it's nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little elf, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works yourself. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right it's their wish, you can wager, to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you thro' thick and thro' thin. 
Our country's made up of all classes, all nations, 
Ev'ry mixture, all colors, all kinds and all creeds; 
Don't frown on a 
man in a 
poor humble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds. 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger, 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through thin. 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now waves. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their graves. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and trienard to win, 
And should they lie called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through thin. 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE A LOVER. 
LADIES' COMIC SONG. 
Ant.—" It's Nice to be a 
Father." 
On, aint it something jolly, girls, 
To have a 
charming beau; 
To take you out—all round about, 
To every sight and show ? 
And when your darling asks you 
What you would like, to-day 
For a 
present ? it's delightful 
To know he means to pay. 
CIIORIIE 
Oh, it's nice to have a 
lover, 
It's nice to have a 
lover, 
it's fine to have a 
sweetheart, 
With him to kiss and toy. 
And if your beau's a 
beauty, 
How proud of him you are; 
And other girls, they envy you, 
At ball, fete or bazaar. 
Miss Johnson, with a 
frown declares 
He's nothing after all ; 
Jemitua says he's rather short ; 
Jane thinks him much too tall. 
Oh, it's nice to have, etc. 
When first you get a 
lover, girls, 
It is a 
great event ; 
Your bosom beats, as-Cupid's dart 
Riabt thro' your heart is sent. 
To take the arm of one, who'll charm 
Your ear with love, is prime ; 
If coy, at first, at kissing, 
You'll get used to it in time. 
Oh, it's nice to have, etc. 
It's splendid to have lovers, girls, 
For that's the overture 
To the drama of real life, when you 
A husband do secure. 
Samples of love I've tasted, and 
Say cordially can I, 
It's nice to have a 
lover, 
If you don't think so—just try. 
Oh, it's nice to have, etc.

HOP ALONG, 
PETER. 
Gamic Song by FRANK DUMONT. Sung by Wm. COURTRIGHT. 
OLD Uncle Peter got full last night, 
Looking out the window, saw a 
sight; 
This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see; 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray nag, 
Playing on do pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along,: 
Hop along, Peter; whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in de pantry, catching mice; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice; 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill- tub, 
Ducks in de ricer, tellin' lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Hop along, Peter, etc. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull- frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel ivid a 
wart on his face; 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally in de garden, lifting peas, 
Ootne and kiss me, if you please. 
Hop along, Petar, eta.

MULDOON, THE SOLID MAN 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. 
HARDLIG, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. 
HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and sung by ED. HANNIGAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line ?" 
I 
Am a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan ; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
citOnILTS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast; 
I'm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan; 
I 
Show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositiens or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a 
damn; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man.' 
I 
control the Tombs, I 
control tho 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man... 
For oppositions, et*.

OH ! 
GAYLY ! 
GAYLY ! 
THAT'S T RIP', WAY TO 
DO. 
LADIES' SEEIO- COMIC SONG. 
AIR.--` • 
Cackle, Cackle :" 
To be downcast is simple, 
So, fair ladies, take a 
warning ; 
Just, stick, like me, to gayety, 
And trouble bid good morning. 
I'm just the girl for m&rritnent, 
And laugh and prattle daily ; 
And I 
am in my element, 
Where life is passing gayly. 
CHORUS 
! 
gayly, gayly, gayly, gayly I 
Grief and trouble ever scorning, 
That's the way to do, my friends, at evening or morning. 
Let's make the best of this queer world we're born in ; 
Law4h, launh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, 
That's the way to do ! 
Oh, I 
was not born yesterday, 
And know it's only folly 
To pine for love ; by that you may 
Go mad thro' melancholy. 
I 
own I 
like a 
nice young man, 
And don't object to Cupid ; 
But then, my lover must be gay 
And not a 
moping stupid. 
Oh, gayly, gayly, etc. 
I 
know, if you like, gentlemen, 
You pretty fast can go it ; 
But there might be a 
Quaker here, 
So out this hint I 
throw it. 
If you'd prolong your precious lives, 
Be gay and never humpy, 
And then you'll please your loving wives 
More than by being grumpy. 
Oh, gayly, gayly, etc. 
Because I 
am a 
feminine, 
Don't fancy I'm a 
fast one, 
To go headlong in pleasure's line 
I 
just should be the last one. 
But. gents and ladies, while we do 
Go through existence daily, 
It's better far than looking blue 
To pass the hours gayly. 
Oh, gayly, gayly, etc.

TELel MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of H ARLIGAN and HART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED Henutoizr, 
in the Odice of the Librarian of long-ress, at 
azonington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by EfAialloA.N and HART, with iraziense sucees, at the 
Theatre comique, New York. 
W E 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The (Evil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fa. 
11 in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
Wo shouldered, eta.

But I

Of an evening after tea, 
While her daddy blew his 'bacca, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, . 
And ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden-wall, 
As though I'd just been shot. 
Cho.—I 
shall never kiss my love, dr,c. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistle& 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken.—At the end of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what "(arming" was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded 
Cho.—I 
shall never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away 
By her cruel dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
Clto.—I shall never kiss my love, do.

Dere vos ladies dressed ub so stylish, 
Und as I

But yust in de midst of de Landers,

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love 7 
love, ' tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to ycur 
bliss, • 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss. 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water ; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows bug 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc. 
p
. 
I'M AS HAPPY AS A SING. 
THERE are many ups and downs, as through this world you 
ramble, 
No matter where you go—go where'er you may, 
,And to get a 
bit of grub ' tis a 
hard thing to scramble; 
But push along, go ahead, you'll have a 
turn some day. 
Now, I 
don't care a 
jot, but take things rough and ready, 
Troubles and misfortune away from me I 
fling, 
And puts up with things hot, like Gubbins's old Neddy ; 
With my pipe and my pot, I'm as happy as a 
king. 
CHORUS 
Da diddley do, doodley di de do de diddley dum 
Do diddley do, doodley di de do de durn • 
There's my wife, she's very tall and slender, 
And, like the ladies generally, very fond of tongue; 
If I 
tell her just to holi it, bless you, it offends her, 
So say I, " Never mind, go it while you're young." 
She often blows me up, while smoking by the fire, 
My pipe sends up the chimney, the kettle begins to sing; 
The smoke ascends to the top of the house, but her tongue is 
heard much higher, 
But lor', I 
doesn't mind it, for I'm as happy as a 
king. 
Da diddley do, etc. 
The other night I 
was in bed, fast asleep and snoring, 
When I 
was awoke by a 
thumping at my head, 
And very soon after I 
was out upon the flooring, 
For my dearly beloy'd wife she'd kick'd me out of bed; 
But I 
slept like a 
top all night on the landing, 
In the morning lit my pipe and merrily did sing, 
"Cheer, boys, Cheer! " just at day-light's dawning, 
A fig for devils blue—I'm as happy as a 
king. 
Pa diddley do, etc. 
This morning, at breakfast, I 
upset the milk-jug, 
Milk and the pot both went upon the floor; 
But, in return, at my head my wife she throw :le teapot, 
Which scalded all my pate and left um very raw; 
Next over went the table, the bread, the water-cresses, 
Oh ! didn't I 
dance when I 
beard the crock'ry 
And sang, " Home, sweet Home," while picking up the pieces; 
All the time my wife was wopping :no I 
felt as happy as a 
king. 
Da diddley do, etc. 
So be of my fraternity, I'm a 
man as never hollas; 
Care's but a 
silly calf, life is but a 
span; 
Take things rough and ready just as they may follow; 
Live like a 
brick and do all the good you can. 
Never mind your wives, for the ladies at times will be vixens. 
Yet let them have their own way much comfort they will bring, 
And if they should like to wop you, let theca for amusement, 
For it won't hurt you—pl9am them—and you'll be as happy as 
a 
king. 
Da diddley de, etc.

An angry storm arose ; 
It first the wind it got to words, 
And then it got to blows,

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh!" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more, 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the 
floor! 
We march'd unto the right and left., until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad."

" 
Lift! 
Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
" 
Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it I 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! 
Shoulder arms!" 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very diffikilt to Impe the step at all 
Along wid all the others whin paradin in the Hall 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
" 
Yer as awkward as the divil; doan't ye bould yer goon that 
way!"

Whineer he'd spake an ordher but egad! ' twas wid a

I 
often wish'd, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we will plod, 
Shouldher arms, and counter marchin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid; 
And wid the Eargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make 'em feel me ving,eance, all the sargints under me! 
have 'em rnarchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retallyate or give me any talk, 
I'll rejuce thim to the ranks at wanst, and there I'll make 'em 
walk! 
If that ain't punishment enough " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

To get all dat I

Den all de vay back, I'm compell'd, den, to go, 
And dey don't spend vun farthing on poor little Mo. 
And dey don't, etc. 
Day say I'm a

All de harm dey can say, is to call me a

Dey are right, and vat then ? " I

who made dat remark, may imagine himself a 
gent, I'll show

Jew. 
He

fine blade, but if he don't mind, he viii

shaved 7" " Never mind about mine getting shaved, you take 
care as you don't get veil lathered." 
Den dey look in mine box, and I 
cry " Vat you puy V' 
Vid shlippers and sticks den dey play me such tricks, 
Den dey tink I've all profit, but leetle dey know 
How ill-used and abused all de day is poor Mo. 
How ill-used, etc. 
De city I

Vid my shop round my neck, you'll each article find ; 
Near St. Paul, and de Bank, and de Royal Exchange I

Your smiles repays mine toils, yid great glee, I

M Y

For I

l'm goine for to see my Cloe dear, 
For to drive away the blues.

By the light of the silver moon.

We'll tap de With° and sing de chorus, 
And I'll bid you all adieu. 
Well dance, etc.

NOW-A-DAYS. 
ALAS! how everything has changed 
Since I. was sweet sixteen, 
When all the girls wore homespun frocks, 
And aprons nice and claan; 
With bonnets made of braided straw, 
That tied beneath the chin, 
The shawl laid neatly on the neck, 
And fasten'd with a 
pin, 
And fasten'd with a 
pin. 
I 
recollect the time when I 
Rode father's horse to mill, 
Across the meadow, rock, and field, 
And up and down the hill ; 
And when " our folks " were out at work, 
(It never made me thinner), 
I 
jumped upon a 
horse bare back, 
And carried them their dinner, 
And carried them their dinner. 
Dear me young ladies now-a- days, 
Would almost faint away, 
To think of riding all alone, 
In wa7on, chaise, or sleigh ; 
And as for giving " pa " his meals, 
Or helping " ma " to bake, 
Oh dear ! 'twould spoil their lily hands, 
Though sometimes they make cake, 
Though sometimes they make cake. 
When winter came, the maiden's heart 
Began to beat and flutter; 
Each beau would take his sweetheart out 
Sleigh riding- in a 
cutter. 
Or, if the storm was bleak and cold, 
The girls and beaux together 
Would meet and have the best of fun, 
And never mind the weather ! 
And never mind the weather! 
But now, indeed, it grieves me much, 
The circumstance to mention, 
However kind the young man's heart, 
And honest his intention, 
He never asks the girls to ride, 
But such a 
man is caged; 
And if he sees her once a 
week, 
Why, surely, " they're engaged," 
Why, surely, " they're engaged."

THE YOUNG LADY WITH Tin/ CURLY HEAD 
OF HAIR. 
I 
HAVE such a 
lot of beau; all eager to propose, 
But they're none of them approved of by mamma, 
And she keeps so strict a 
guard over me, that's very bard, 
For I'm fond of beaux, as all young ladies are! 
She will seldom let me out, for she knows they stroll about, 
In the hope that they will catch a 
glimpse of me; 
But as by the house they go, through the windows oft they 
throw 
Little notes I 
read when ma's not there to sea. 
SPOKEN.—Which generally contains something to this effect— 
CHORUS. 
Are you coming out to-night, for the moon is shining brigh 
And the little stars are peeping here and there; 
I 
am waiting here in doubt, oh! are you coming out ? 
Little beauty with the curly head of hair 
There is handsome Harry Lee, who 
Whom I 
met at cousin Hen 
But mamma declares h'

don't know why, 
at the open window sit and sew ; 
nd my heart beats very fast, as he whispers going past, 
In that voice of his so musically low. 
Are you coming out, etc.

THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE 
OF HAIR.—Continued. 
Then there's Frank, who 
well, 
Though I 
look upon him only as a " beau ;" 
He will often wait about, pleading " Arn't you coming out," 
A 
apes the swell, still I 
like him very 
ncl declares it wrong of ma to treat him so. 
Then there's merry Philip Drew, he's a 
dear, but be's poor too, 
And so daring, not afraid of ma at ; 
She's not deaf, so she must hear, when his voice rings out so 
clear, 
As 
beneath my window he will often call, 
Are you coming out, etc. 
If alone to walk I 
go, I 
am sure to meet a 
beau, 
Nearly crazed with joy to catch me out alone ; 
But there's- one— I 
won't say who— of no consequence to you, 
Fond of me, and—well—my heart is all his own. 
He is handsome, good, but poor; that's a 
fault ma won't ignore; 
But it shall not make a 
difference with me; 
For—you needn't tell mamma, but some day we really are 
Going to run away to church and married be. 
SPOKEN.— Then there will be no need for any to say— 
Are you coming out, etc.

The pretty little infant there, who's playing with a

Weighs six pounds two and six, and lives on Thorley's food for 
cattle! 
You see that pensive piebald child, that interestinc, pet, 
Takes first prize at the show, and t

The baby show, Icc. 
That olive branch, of six months old, although he cannot speak, 
Can, read and write, and understands his Latin and his Greek; 
The next child, only ten days old, has grown so very stout, 
He takes his mother in his arms and carries her about. 
The baby show, ike. 
The next one is a. knowing child, he must be, for be states, 
" 
That though his mother whacks and laves, his doctor whacks an

The way he bit his aged nurse brought tears into her eyes, 
He says, " That as he is a

prize." 
The baby show, &c. 
That boy there is a 
little girl, just two foot high of age, 
She's took to drinking, and with her the bottle's all the rage; 
That other child does nothing else but suck his little thumbs, 
Just put your finger in his mouth, you'll bless his little gums. 
The baby show, 4e. 
It's feeding time; step in to see the pretty little dears, 
But if your nerves are weak at all, you'd better stop your ears; 
Then, when we think you've seen enough, we give a 
hint to go, 
And pinch the children till they cry, which clears the baby show.

I AM BO THIRSTY. 
You often meet folks who are fond of a 
glass, 
But of all thirsty souls I 
all others surpass, 
Each hour of my life I'm afflicted with thirst, 
And I've drank enough liquid to make forty burst. 
Whatever I 
drink and whatever I 
take, 
Nothing on me will an impression make; 
I 
have never been satisfied yet since my birth. 
In fact I'm the thirstiest man on the earth. 
SPOREN.—When I was a 
baby it took thirteen wet nurses, 
six feeding bottles, besides my mother to keep me alive, and they 
had to employ two women all day to make pap for me, but then 
they couldn't satisfy me. 
CHORUS. 
I'm drinking from morning till evening, you see, 
Yet still I'm as thirsty as thirsty can be; 
All night I 
drink and I 
don't get a 
wink, 
In short I 
do nothing but drink, drink, drink. 
I 
don't mean to say that a 
drunkard am I, 
But still Tam always so terribly dry; 
And so to get rid of the feeling severe, 
I 
drink quarts of spirits and barrels of beer, 
Hogsheads of ale, and coffee, and tea, 
Oceans and oceans are gulped down by me; 
Sometimes I 
try, vainly, the dryness to stop 
With hundreds of dozens of prime ginger-pop. 
SPOICEN. —
Yes,talk about drinking, I'm always drinking. Some 
(1) 
I 
AM BO THIRSTY.—Concluded. 
people are fond of a 
drop or two, and a 
thousand drops wouldn't 
satisfy me, and the wonder is where it all goes to ? 
Some say it's 
because I'm so long, that before the liquor gets half way down it 
evaporates. I 
don't know if that's true, but I 
do know they've 
doubled my water rate. 
I've drank so much water, that the 
neighbors a 
mile round me can't get any; the New River Com-
pany wont supply me any more, so I'm going to have a 
main of 
my own laid on from the Thames. 
I'm drinking, etc. 
I've worn out the pump that near our house stood, 
And dried up the fountain in our neighborhood, 
I've finished a 
well a 
small way beyond, 
And now I'm at work at a 
large fishing pond. 
I've drank all the milk from each dairy around. 
And the milkmen say " Simpson " thro' me can't be found; 
All the publicans tremble when they see me nigh, 
For they know that my wants they can never supply. 
SPOKEN.—Most people when they drink will find it quench 
their thirst, but the more I 
drink the more I 
want. I 
once went 
fishing in a 
small lake belonging to a 
country cousin of mine, and 
I 
drank so much of the water that at last there was none left for 
me to fish in, nor the fish to swim in. 
After that he invited me 
to spend a 
day or two at his house; I 
rather surprised him I 
can 
assure you. 
My usual performance was something after this 
style—a 
pail or two of coffee, ditto tea for breakfast, drain all 
the cups, and sometimes finish up with the slop basin; unlimited 
quantities of ale till dinner time, then half- a-dozen tureens of soup, 
ditto of broth, and then wind up by swallowing the vinegar and 
all the sauces on the table.

" THE WAY TO KISS IN STYLE." 
Words by SAMUEL N. 
MITCHELL. 
Music by Jon!? BRAHADS. 
The Music of this song is published by G. D. RcrssELL & Co., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. Price 90 cents. 
MOST ev'ry lady has a 
beau 
She thinks the best of all, 
And doats upon him night and day, 
Tho' he be short or tall; 
She'll speak about his black mustache, 
Or else his curly hair, 
And kiss his " photo" now and then 
Because he is so fair. 
SPOICEN.—That " 
photo " business may be all right, but no 
paste- board kissing for me. 
It's too much on the half-shell 
principle, and borders a 
little too far on the ridiculous. 
For 
myself, I 
prefer the genuine, original, " Dowd East" smack, 
that goes off like a 
pop-gun every time it falls on the real arti-
cle—a 
pair of ruby lips—that's me. 
CLIORUES. 
For I 
prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack." 
Some take their follows by the hand 
While they are out to walk, 
And think themselves in Paradise 
When he begins to talk ; 
She'll say " ' tis pleasant since the rain," 
He'll answer, " ' tis quite cool," 
And oftthey wander hand in hand, 
Like children going to school. 
SPOKEN.—Catch me and my fellow on that string and you'll 
catch eels edgeways—the weather has always been the stereo-
typed topic of conversation with the majority of moon- struck

lovers, and it always will be. 
Why not talk about the stock 
market, financial fiascoes, monetary matters, bulls and bears, 
or even pet-poodles. It's just as sensible, and far more interest-
ing than weather lingo. 
Old Probabilities can attend to the 
weather question and spoony lovers should drop it. 
Then, 
when they get to the garden gate after a 
short ramble, they, of 
course, want to kiss. 
He's afraid, and she darsn't; and they 
finally part by throwing one at each other. Now, if I'd been her, 
and the chap was worth it, I'd let fly one of this kind. (

imitation of a 
healthy smack.) 
CHORUS. 
For I 
prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack." 
I 
have some lady friends who say, 
When beaux have bade " good- night l" 
" 
Just wait a 
moment longer, dear, 
Oh, do not leave my sight." 
Then they will take their lover's hand, 
And hold it for a 
while, 
And all the kissing that they do 
Is just a 
parting smile. 
SPOKEN.—This may be well enough for those who like it, but 
give me something better. 
What does a 
fellow care for a 
little 
squeeze like that, and the outside door half open 
Some would 
call it rather " tart," and several whom I 
know wouldn't stand 
it. The fellow that comes to see me—that is, one of them— fares 
better than that, and don't he like it, though; just before lie 
steps out I 
put them to him right smart, and the beauty of it is 
he retaliates. 
CHORUS 
For we prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack."

THE LAZIEST MAN IN ALL THE TOWN. 
W HEN I was but a 
little lad, 
Not more than five years old, 
I 
always listen'd when my dad 
This curious story told ; 
Of one who wander'd up and down 
The laziest man in all the town. 
This man's estate, or rank, or name, 
No person seem'd to know, 
Nor what his calling, whence he came, 
Could any person show; 
They knew he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town. 
He never laughed, he never spoke, 
Nor did he ever think; 
And when the dust blew in his eyes, 
Too lazy he was to wink. 
And so he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town. 
The reason why he never talked, 
And why he never sung, 
Was, that he found it quite too great 
A 
task to wag his tongue. 
And so he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town. 
He was so lazy that he slept 
While standing on his feet; 
And I 
had almost said—but no— 
One thing he could do—eat. 
And so he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town. 
And when he slept, the people all 
Looked on with great surprise ; 
He was so plaguey lazy that 
He didn't shut his eyes. 
And still he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town. 
At length this man so lazy grew 
He couldn't draw his breath ; 
For troublesome he deemed that, too, 
And- so he met his death. 
No more he wander'd up and down, 
The laziest man in all the town.

THE LAZIEST MAN IN ALL THE TOWN.— 
Continued. 
If that had been the last of him, 
It had,Indeed, been well ; 
The strangest part of this strange tale 
Remains for me to tell ; 
His ghost still wanders up and down, 
The laziest ghost in all the town. 
For instead of leaving him to take . 
His journey down below, 
It was, like him, so lazy, 
That it quite refused to go. . 
And still it wanders up and down, 
The laziest ghost in all the town.

I 
CAME from the east, 
And I 
went to the west, 
To hunt for a 
house for to board in, 
And I 
soon found a 
rest, 
When I 
dressed in my best, 
And put down my name as Johnnie Jordan. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
took ()flaw coat, 
And I 
rolled up my sleeves, 
And I 
made myself at home accordin', 
For when a 
fellow's tired, 
He generally leaves, 
And so does the legs of Johnnie Jordan, I 
believe. 
They served four kinds of meat, 
When the boarders came to eat; 
'Twas shesp, ram, lamb, and mutton; 
So I 
tried to eat a 
slice, 
For it look'd so mighty nice; 
But I 
couldn't if I'd been an awful glutton. 
So I 
took off my coat, etc. 
I 
said I 
had enough, 
For it was so mighty tough - 
That I 
couldn't eat the piece that I 
chaw'd on; 
So the landlord took the bread, 
And struck me on the head, 
And blackened up the eye of Johnnie Jordan. 
Then I 
took off my coat, etc. 
The landlord said, " Oh, no! 
Young man, you cannot go: 
You cannot leave this house until you piney; 
And 
hit an awful smash 
On that curly calabash, 
If you don't plank down with your money." 
So I 
took off my coat, etc. 
He kept a 
skinny horse, 
And a 
dog so fnighty cross, 
With a 
broad brass collar with a 
cord on; 
He caught me by the hip, 
When out I 
thought to slip, 
And nearly was the death of Johnnie -Jordan. 
Then I

DON'T EVER LOSE YOUR GRIP. 
As through the world in search of pleasure, 
We wander, boys, together ; 
We're knocked about, up and down, but 
The Storm of life we weather. 
Some there are who don't succeed, and but 
Let their chances slip ; 
Take my advice, you'll find I'm right, 
Boys, never lose your grip. 
When courting, be the man throughout, 
And if your girl's inclined 
To act the flirt, why shut your eyes, 
Her little faults don't mind ; 
Don't act the fool, be true to her, and 
Darn it, let her rip. 
If she cares a 
cent for you, my boy, 
You'il never lose your grip. 
When you meet a 
skunk, pass him by, but 
Remember at some time, 
That to be hard up, is no sin, and poverty no crime. 
And when a 
friend is in distress, why 
- 
Your hands in pocket dip, 
And until you find a 
stamp, my boys, 
Why never lose your grip. 
When going home late at night, 
Look out for an attack; 
It happens oft a 
loafer steals like, or 
Sneaks behind your brck. 
Punch him well, he'll ,r.r,ice you no 
Chance, ar.d quickly give the trip, 
And until he kisses mother earth, boys, 
Never lose your grip.

ETHIOPIAN AND COMIC DRAMA. 
PRICE 15 CENTS EACH. 
The following list includes some of the most justly popular ETHIOPIAN 
Duel:axle SKETCHES ever produced upon the boards. 
They are artistically 
constructed in plot-full of humorous incidents and laughable situations-
the charecters are genuine darkeys, both in thought and expression. 
There 
is more first-rate fun in one prize of these plays than a 
whole volume of 
most ( so-called) funny books. They are admirably suited for private ama-
teur performance. Everything is made as plain as possible, so that any of 
the pieces can be easily produced without the aid of a 
professional.
