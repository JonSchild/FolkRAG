"Dear Mr. President", Galena and Crane, Missouri, January or February 1942
AFS 6424A
Morgan Southridge: My name is Morgan Southridge, superintendent of schools at Crane, Missouri.
My dear Mr. President, I want to pledge to you and Congress the allegiance of our school to your
program. I am sure the schools of America will go with you one hundred percent. As we are with
you in this fight, we want you to remember that the schools are an important institution in our
democracy and that we must continue the school's program.
Recently, there has been much discussion relative to the elimination of the NYA Our school has
participated in that program for a number of years and have found it helpful. However, I believe that
part of it can be eliminated as an economy measure. However, I would recommend that the college
age for students who wish to go to college would not be eliminated.
Another phase of your program which I want to commend is the school lunch and garden project
program which was inaugurated a few years ago. We participated in that program last year and
have found that we can furnish to our underprivileged boys and girls one good meal a day. We
are participating in that program again next year and nearly all of the schools of our county will
participate with us.
Until recently, I have been reluctant to accept your foreign policies. However, as events unfold, you
are being proven right and I wrong. I have recently read Berlin Diary. This book has done much to
change my opinions and show me the objectives of Hitlerism. I believe everyone should read this
book.
Now in conclusion, may I again pledge my allegiance for myself and my community to your program.
I thank you.
