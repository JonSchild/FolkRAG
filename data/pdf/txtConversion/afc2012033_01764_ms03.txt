Field Notes 
Interview with Joyce R. Godbout, on the Vincent Farm in Burke, NY 
Interviewer: Jill Breit 
Date: July 16, 2013 
I arrived at the Vincent Farm on an 85 degree, high humidity day.  It was 10:30 in the morning, and Joyce 
was just finishing a 6-hour shift in the stiflingly hot barn.  When I asked her how she was doing, she 
responded with an expletive.  Her first stop was the bulk tank room, where she hosed down her arms 
and legs with cold water before leading me to a cool shed (former potato processing shed on the farm) 
for the interview.  Joyce is the hired herd manager at the Vincent Farm, and, unusual for women on 
North Country dairy farms, not related to the owners of the farm. 
Two months before this interview, I accompanied photographer Martha Cooper to the Vincent Farm to 
document work ongoing there.  Many of the photographs taken that day were of Joyce working in the 
milking parlor.  She’s fast, efficient, and confident around cows who dwarf her.  She often stopped to 
put a comforting hand on the back of a cow who seemed uneasy. 
Joyce is lean and strong, her muscles well-toned by a lifetime of farm work.  At the time of this 
interview, employee departures had her working longer than usual shifts, a situation she hoped would 
soon change.  Fatigued by the extreme temperatures in which she had spent the morning, she yawned 
periodically throughout the interview, which you can hear in the interview.  That said, Joyce is upbeat, 
comfortable with the lifestyle she has chosen, and she laughed throughout the interview. 
There is really no quiet place on the farm to conduct an interview.  Where we sat, you can occasionally 
hear traffic passing, and more distractingly, a compressor that kicked on often. 
At one point in the interview, Joyce talks about balancing the desire to get increased milk production 
from a cow against the physical consequences to the cow.  In particular, cows pushed hard for 
production develop abnormally oversized udders that reduce the number of years a cow can safely 
produce.  In general, Joyce errs on the side of caring for her cows when it comes to pushing the cows to 
generate more income for the farm. 
Off-tape, Joyce talked about the ‘merchandising” aspect of the farm, which in their case means selling 
cull cows for extra cash.  Joyce said that with gas prices so high, it costs about $350 one way to take a 
trailer to a sale, so she feels you have to fill the trailer to justify it.  Ideally, you’d get $1.50/pound for a 
quality cows.  Recently sales had been shy of that, around $1,100 for a 900 pound bred heifer.
