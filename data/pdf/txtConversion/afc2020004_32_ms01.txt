Advice to Myself 
 
Leave the dishes. 
Let the celery rot in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator 
and an earthen scum harden on the kitchen floor. 
Leave the black crumbs in the bottom of the toaster. 
Throw the cracked bowl out and don’t patch the cup. 
Don’t patch anything. Don’t mend. Buy safety pins. 
Don’t even sew on a button. 
Let the wind have its way, then the earth 
that invades as dust and then the dead 
foaming up in gray rolls underneath the couch. 
Talk to them. Tell them they are welcome. 
Don’t keep all the pieces of the puzzles 
or the doll’s tiny shoes in pairs, don’t worry 
who uses whose toothbrush or if anything 
matches, at all. 
Except one word to another. Or a thought. 
Pursue the authentic—decide first 
what is authentic, 
then go after it with all your heart. 
Your heart, that place 
you don’t even think of cleaning out. 
That closet stuffed with savage mementos. 
Don’t sort the paper clips from screws from saved baby teeth 
or worry if we’re all eating cereal for dinner 
again. Don’t answer the telephone, ever, 
or weep over anything at all that breaks. 
Pink molds will grow within those sealed cartons 
in the refrigerator. Accept new forms of life 
and talk to the dead 
who drift in through the screened windows, who collect 
patiently on the tops of food jars and books. 
Recycle the mail, don’t read it, don’t read anything 
except what destroys 
the insulation between yourself and your experience 
or what pulls down or what strikes at or what shatters 
this ruse you call necessity.
