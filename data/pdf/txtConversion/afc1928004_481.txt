NILES AND EVANS. 
THE subjects of this brief sketch first attracted notice, 
while performing at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, in the Bow-
s 
cry. 
It was in the year 1873, that they produced an act 
called "Riding in a 
Street Car "—a 
Belle and Swell Flirta-
tion Scene piece—which soon rendered them famous. The 
characters fitted the young performers to perfection. 
Mr. Evans, who took the part of a 
young girl, has a 
fine 
soprano voice, which exactly suited the personation. 
Wherever Messrs. Niles and Evans appeared, and they 
travelled very extensively throughout the country (ap-
pearing in the leading Novelty Theatres), they always de-
lighted large houses, and were the recipients of the warm-
est encomiums from the press. 
They have also appeared 
with Zimmerman's and Swain's Minstrels, 
Hooley's 
Minstrels, Sam Purdy's Minstrels, and Sweatman's and 
Frazier's Minstrels. 
They are the originators of the 
style of 
act known as " Comedy Mixtures "—which 
consists of sentimental and comic songs, and humorous 
conversations and dancing, all blended happily together 
under the appropriate name of COMEDY Mix-a:BE:I 
They are deserved favorites at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, 
Broadway, New York, where they have appeared several 
times this season, and they are engaged for his travelling 
company the coming one.

COMEDY MIXTURES . 
An entirely new style of act performed only by the Autocrats of 
piau Comedy and great English Swell Burlesques. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
I 
KNOW a 
little maiden, ever light and free, 
Her beauty's bright and pearly- as a 
shell ; 
In confidence I'll tell you she said she loved but me. 
She lives among the flowers in the dell. 
We often sit together beneath the leafy vine, 
And to each other we confess our love ; 
I 
am so elated to think that she is mine, 
She seems to me an angel from above. 
CHORUS. 
"Walking in the starlight," " where flowers blush and 
bloom," 
With the " Lily of the Valley " by my side. 
" 
Dancing in the Moonlight " " Down where the Pansies 
grow," 
" 
Rowing on the Lake" at eventide. 
(
Dance.) 
I'll sing of a 
daisy, I 
know he's not lazy, 
A " Lord Byron " collar he wears with great ease, 
His cuffs are the latest make, his blue necktie he'll ne .
Ver 
shake, 
When he meets the boys, he's sure to quake 
And shudder with fear. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing, prancing so light and airy, 
Skipping about, he's just like a 
fairy ; 
Eats only cake, and says he won't marry— 
Charley's a 
jovial young man.

COMEDY MIXTURES.—Concluded. 
While walking down the street one day, 
I 
met the girl I 
love 
She wore a 
pair of over-ails, 
On her heiLil a 
boxing glove; 
Was cross-eyed and left-handed too, 
But of that I 
need not speak; 
She lieul false teeth, her nose was red, 
And plumpers in her cheek. 
CHORUS. 
But now she's gone away, 
And her no more I'll see, 
She's drivin,g on the Erie Canal, 
She thinks it is the sea ; 
If ever she comes back, 
get her a 
job on the track, 
Shovelling sand and carrying rails, 
From here to Kalamazac. (Dwice0 
Whenever I 
go out to walk, 
With her along the street, 
She's sure to cause me terrible pain 
• 
By tramping on my feet. 
The shoes she wears 
They are so large, they'd really make you mile. 
They were made out-doors in the summer time, 
And took up half a 
mile. 
But now she's gone away, etc.

WHEN ' TIS MOONLIGHT. 
WALTZ SONG. 
Music published by W HITE, S3IITH & Co., Boston, Mas3. 
Au, ah, 
ah, ah, ah, when ' tis moonlight, when ' tis star-
light, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee sweetest flowers, 
From the woodland, from the woodland o'er the lea ; 
Ah, ye birds of spring, tell what joys ye bring, 
Merry birds, happy birds, joyous birds, birds of spring. 
Ali, when 
moonlight, when 'tis starlight, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee, 
Sweetest flowers from the woodland, 
From the woodland o'er the lea. 
Long have I 
waited here for thy coming, 
Often in doubt my poor heart sank within me ; 
Hope I 
must cherish, though life may perish, 
'Tis but a 
vision of sorrow that never can be, 
'Tis but a 
vision of sorrow that never can be. 
Ali, when 'tis moonlight, when ' tis starlight, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee, 
Sweetest flowers from the woodland, 
From the woodland o'er the lea, ah, ah, ah, ah, ad.

JANE OVERSHOE, 
PARODY ON NANCY LEE. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with big success by NILES and 
EVANS. 
OF 
all the dizzy girls that ever I 
knew, 
There's none can compare with Jane Overshoe. 
Her nose is long, and her month is large, 
She is always good to herself; 
She can eat clam pies, that for a 
year was laid on the 
shelf. 
One Saturday night I 
got my pay, 
I 
took her out for a 
walk ; 
To a 
beer- saloon at first we went, 
Bat the man to death she talked : 
A 
freezer full of ice-cream 
To her was only a 
taste, 
Then fourteen oyster stews she laid waste. 
CHOI:US. 
Oh, my, did you ever see such a 
girl before', 
She ate till she fell on the floor, 
Then I 
run out of the door; 
I 
left her there to pay the bill; 
Now what could I 
do more ? 
I'm sure my dream of love is o'er. 
To balls and parties we often go, 
Ye-ho, boys ! ho ! for Jane Overshoe ; 
She is like the rest, she wants the best 
Or else it will not do, 
And your pocket- book she will go clear through. 
When I 
call for wine, she says she's mine, 
And to me she wilt be true : 
Bat when she lets to pay the bill, 
It makes her feel so blue : 
She can waltz, polka, and quadrille 
For hours at a 
time ; 
Oh, this darling she never can be mine. 
Oh, my, did you ever, etc.

MR. 
JOHNNY DOUGKEIRTY. 
Written and sung by HENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony 
Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
Pin certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected mart 
In this great town; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS.. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor,. 
A man of great renown; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch, 
As very well they know. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, etc. 
SEE THAT MY GRAVE IS KEPT PADLOCKED 
AND BOLTED. 
Written by JAMES NILES. Sung with great success by NILES and 
EVA.NS. 
W HEN I 
shuffle off this mortal coil, terra firma, 
And I'm stowed away in a 
dark cellar called a 
grave, 
When I'm climbing the skies without a 
ladder 
Here is one little wish I 
would crave ; 
Build the fence around the cemetery ten stories high, • 
Get me a 
masked battery, an iron club and a 
screen, 
Don't give the combination of the lock to the janitor, 
And see that my face is shaved clean. 
CHOEIIS. 
Oh the days will come to this country, 
When I 
in the ground will be moulded, 
Please keep my address from all the medical 
college students, 
And see that my grave's kept padlocked and bolted. 
When I'm sailing through the air with an ulster, 
When I'm skipping away on the fly, 
When I'm swimming on the ice in the summer, 
Will you meet me in the sweet bye-and-bye ? 
Never let anybody against a 
savings bank steer you, 
If you do you'll have nothing in your pocket; 
Always keep one eye on a 
tramp in the winter, 
And around my grave put a 
chain and locket. 
Oh, the days will come, etc,

FREDDY THE SWELL. 
Written by JAMES NILES. Sung with great success by NILES 
and 
EVANS. 
I 
KNOW a 
young fellow, his name it is Fred, 
He is as giddy as giddy can be, 
His step it is light, his pants they are tights, 
He is one of the tra in in lee ; 
He owes for his clothes at the tailor's below, 
And the style is the latest you see, 
To the club he will go in the evening, you know, 
And with a 
friend he'll take tea. 
CHORUS. 
He carries a 
cane and an umbrella too 
He always looks so stylish and so neat, 
His hat is No. seven and his shoes are No. eleven, 
But he don't wear any socks on his feet. 
He walks in the park, goes out on a 
laA, 
His necktie is all in a 
flutter, 
The people they swear, to each other declare 
That he ought to be kicked into the gutter ; 
On a 
corner he'd stand, oh, he looks so grand, 
In the windows he'd peep half the day, 
At the show-cases stare at the jewelry there, 
And pull his mustaches in an elegant way. 
He carries a 
cane, etc,

She first cap-

ball. 
We danced every set ; she had a 
lovely 
pair of slippers on when she commenced ; but when she left off 
I 
had to take her home without a 
sole. 
In fact, being one of the 
" 
upper ten" she walked home on her uppers. I 
love her, and 
fear no, rival. 
What member of the fair sex could withstand 
these charms?

Exquisite! A-

Disth; f 
We met by chance, the usual way. I 
was in-
troduced to her at her father's mansion, four flights up. 
It was 
a 
case of love at first sight. 
She was reeliumg upon a 
sofa, after 
the fatigues of a 
ball the night before, and she looked weary, 
but charming-. But I 
know she loves me! Yes, and 1 
do not fear 
a 
rival in my affections. 
Oh, no ! with this figure, I 
flatter my-
self, that would be .impossible. 
Then what a 
lovely dancer she 
is!

She stood at the front gate with a 
barrel of those what-
(10-ye-call 'ems in her dainty hands. 
I 
don't mean apples— but 
ashes. 
There she stood. like a 
kitchen Venus rising from the 
coal-hole. 
She saw me. I 
advanced. 
She smiled. 
I 
smiled 
likewise, and after one sweet wor!i we p:iried. 
But she told me

THERE'S a gold watch in the window, 
'Tisn't mine, ' tisn't mine ; 
But I 
think I'll have to take it, 
It keeps time, it keeps time; 
Though if I 
should be caught, 
All my trouble will go for naught, 
To the Island I'll be brought 
Right on time, for the watch not mine, 
And on mush and milk I'll dine 
Six months at a 
time. 
T 
here's a 
horse and cutter in the street, 
'Tisn't mine, ' tisn't mine, 
But I

For a 
pleasant time, pleasant time ; 
And if I 
don't come back, 
They can look for me with a

When I

What a

So I 
think I'll change my mind, 
And ride behind (

Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle nest. 
Far above the starry heavens 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle net. 
Far adown the dewy meadow 
All the daisies are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us 
Angels' eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
As if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, etc. 
In the early morning, darling. 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber 
When he sings in merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the pane 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day has come again. 
Go to sleep, etc.

JOHNNY NEW. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with great success by NILES and 
EVANS. 
I 
AM going to tell you of a 
nice young man, 
His name was Johnny New, 
He carried water for saloons, and cleaned out spittoons. 
And for you anything he would do ; 
Every day about nine he would call for wine, 
But the seltzer he would get instead ; 
They would squirt in his face with terrific pace, 
Until he was nearly dead. 
CHORUS. 
For he was a 
lusher you see, 
With money he had no use ; 
On errands he, would run, oh he was a 
bum, 
But now he has gone to the deuce. 
On the sidewalk he would stand with a 
but in his hand, 
And horses to him they would tie, 
He would kick like a 
steer when they would offer him 
beer, 
And he would sigh for the good old rye ; 
His feet wasn't mates, they looked like skates ; 
His dark flowing locks were gray. 
His pants and his vest were made out West 
And in his hair was a 
load of hay. 
For he was a 
lusher, etc.

TEN years ago I 
stepped on board. 
A 
ship to England bound, 
My heart and pockets both were light,' 
Though I'd not got a

I 
was but young and greesheen then, 
-Without deceit or sham, 
But times and things have altered 
With myself, and now I 
am—

Mister Michael Murphy, a 
man of great ability, 
Known and respected too by all the gentility, 
Patronized by all the nobs aniongst the great nobility, 
For Mister Michael Murphy is a 
well known man. 
I 
got some work to carry bricks, 
At fourteen bob a 
week, 
But soon I 
got the sack because 
They said I'd too much cheek ; 
So I 
fell back upon the club, 
And when I 
let them see 
That I 
was full of book laming, 
They made a 
secretary—of 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
From that they made me President 
Of our new Home Rude League, 
And I 
soon got acquainted with 
An M. P., Mister Teague; 
My speechifying was so good, 
I 
soon got into fame, 
And everybody tells me that 
The man to make a 
name—is 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
My letters now are all addressed 
Michael Murphy, esquire, 
And if 
get ill Parliament 
set the house on fire ; 
With may great and burning eloquence, 
I'll teach them the right way 
To satisfy the Home Rule League, 
Then every one will say—

iTURN OFF THE GAS AT THE METER. 
Written and Composed by J. 
STAMFORD. 
'A NS-0=11Y old bachelor was Peter LeLean, 
In business for several years he had been, 
In a 
shop somewhere out on the Elevated Road, 
Where the neighbors all call him a 
stingy old toad. 
His habits were frugal, he lived all alone, 
Economy seem'd grafted into the bone, 
And for fear of a 
fire, ere at night he'd retire, 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter. 
cuoims. 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
Every night he would go to the regions below, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now as he grew older he took rn a 
maid, 
And fifteen new greenbacks a 
year to her paid ; 
She had to attend to old Peter and cook. 
And sometimes she read him the news or a 
book. 
Now McLean, who'd a 
bachelor been all his life, 
Began to have thoughts about taking a 
wife, 
For with the old fellow she'd go down the cellar, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gas, etc. 
So useful he found his young housekeeper to be 
He soon raised her wages another new V. 
He then began spooning and telling such fibs, 
"While she in return used to nudge his old ribs. 
Though sixty, 'twas plain he with Cupid was struck, 
He kissed her, and squeezed her, and called her his 
duck, 
But though his love was so hot he never forgot, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gas, etc. 
One morning they walked off to church all serene, 
And the girl after that became Mrs. McLean. 
They haven't a 
family, but he doesn't fret, 
But tells his young wife that there's time enough yet. 
They've a 
cot out of town where for light they've no 
lamp, 
But he's best pleased when living in town, the old 
scamp, 
For he says it's a 
lark going down in the dark, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gas, etc.

Oh, Lor' a

make them sing. 
I 
suppose you all have seen my brother Joseph, 
And his dancing you have found it hard to brat, 
For he never had a

So he only tried to educate his feet. 
CHORUS. 
Come soon (sym.), plenty of room (sym.), 
Come, we'll give all a 
good fair chance, 
For I 
tell you it runs right in the family 
For all of us to play and sing and dance. 
Now Joe is getting old and rather shaky, 
And thinks it's time for him to take a 
rest; 
So he sent for me to come up here before you, 
And to fill his place, I'll try and do my best. 
I 
know that Joe has made a 
good impression, 
And I 
only hope that I 
can do the same; 
For I

As that will help keep up the family name.

Written and composed by SAM DEVER& 
Of late I've had some funny thoughts, 
I 
don't mind telling you 
Of this next hundred years to come, 
And what ' twill bring to view ; 
The things that will be said and done 
And the million little tricks, 
Will go to make a 
wonderful change, 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
Things will be accomplished then 
The greatest ever heard; 
People then will sail around 
On wings just like a 
bird, 
Rings and third terms looming up, 
With White House politics, 
We'll probably have an emperor then, 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
Women's rights will be in force, 
And women cast their votes, 
Men stay at home to mind the babes 
And wear the petticoats; 
They'll marry arid get divorced in a 
day, 
Make money with bran new tricks, 
Free love will be served up on toast 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
If this great big United States 
Keeps on as from its birth, 
We'll knock the tar right out of any 
Nation on the earth. 
But there's one thing I 
want to say 
Before I 
cut my sticks, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar I 
ain't alive 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
THEODORE McCARTHY. 
IRISH SWELL SONG. 
By JOIIN KERNELL. 
I 
AM a sporting Irishman, 
As you can plainly see ; 
I'm as happy as a 
little bird, 
Or a 
frog upon a 
tree ; 
I 
dress in the latest style of course, 
And my manners always tell, 
I'm what you'd call a 
gallus Mick, 
Or a 
regular Irish swell. 
CHORUS. 
Theodore McCarthy, that's my name, 
Billiards and croquet, that's my game, 
With a 
rosebud on my coat, 
And dashing style as well ; 
I'm what ye call a 
gallus Mick, 
Or a 
regular Irish swell. 
I 
drive a 
first-class trotter, 
And he is number one, 
And when there's a 
party in my ward, 
I'm always in for fun ; 
I 
live upon canary birds, 
And never eat kidney stew, 
My income is one dollar a 
day, 
On my soul—the sole of my shoe.

I WON'T HEAR OLD IRELAND RUN DOWN. 
Written and sung by HENRI" CARNEY, with great applause. 
There's a 
dear little spot cali'd the Emerald Isle, 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils 
When people speak of it with scorn; 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand 
That I 
cannot imagine why people should speak 
In dispraise of my dear native land. 
Clioncs. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
wont hear old Ireland run down! 
I'm sure no Irishman ever need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishmen only can do 
When foes of their country were nigh ; 
And in modern times, when for England they fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea when danger was near, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, etc. 
The name of O'Connell, and all such as he, 
4 
Should make every Irishman proud; 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were 
With wit and with wisdom endowed; 
They spoke for their country, as every man should, 
No matter what country or creed ; 
So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, 
For they proved true in thought, word, and deed. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, etc. 
Made popular by our Song and Dance Artists, Messrs. W AYNE and 
LOVELY. 
I SHOULD like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
I 
ask'd my cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet ! 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go ! 
And Sally rills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, etc. 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer-by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style ; 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile! 
She blushed, etc. 
As performed only by the " Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN. 
We are two Irish boys so frisky, 
None better sure you can't find, 
To twirl the twig, or drink strong whiskey, 
Or bate a 
big foe, do ye mind; 
If the four leafed shamrock we could get now, 
All barefooted cripples would be shod, 
No poor needle woman would sit down, 
But be gay, like the boys that carry the hod. 
Drink success to Irish labor, 
Just now over from the sod; 
All we want is laborers' wages, 
For we're the boys that carry the hod. 
We'd have no shifting politicians, 
But every man would honest be; 
Old starvation, he'd have no relation, 
And ould Ireland would be free ; 
We'd have Saturday night three times a 
week, 
Fine roast beef, and less salt cod; 
Then everyone would be happy, 
Just like the boys that carry the hod. 
Drink success, etc.

()MONT, weirasthrue! sure my heart's nearly breaking; 
Farewell of my senses I'm sure I 
am taking ; 
Thro' thinking of Nancy, asleep or awaking, 
I'm just like a 
long fishing rod. 
My bosom with anger and sorrow does throb, 
Aich breath that I 
take is turned into a 
sob ; 
I'm as wake as a 
drink of could water, by gob, 
I 
wish I 
was under tile sod. 
CHORUS. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, of me you've made a 
looney, 
You know since we were childther on you I've been 
spooney ; 
If you don't dhrop gallavantin' with that blackguard, 
Mickey Rooney, 
I'll dhrown myself, and thin my ghost will haunt yon 
night and day. 
Ochone, weirasthrue ! black-eyed Nancy Machree, 
I 
know you're too good for a 
fellow like me; 
But as sure as the birds love the leaves on the tree 
I 
love you far dearer than life. 
If you'll only become Mrs. Mulligan soon 
I'll sing like a 
bird in the sweet month of June, 
And I'll hop on one leg from Drumlish to the moon, 
The day that I 
make you my wife. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, etc. 
Altho' I 
am delicate, lonely, and wake, 
I'll smash every skull in the land for your sake, 
I'll pitch the ould castle right into the lake, 
I'll ride Prince O'Dououghue's horse, 
I'll swear by all colors—black. yaller, or red,— 
That I'll smash like a 
turnip Mick Rooney's big head ; 
You have broke my poor heart—och, I 
wish I 
was dead, 
Then you might shed a 
tear o'er my corse. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, etc.

I 
WANT a 
beau, now please don't laugh, 
I 
mean just what I 
say, 
I 
am determined I 
shall now 
No longer single stay. 
But where there are so many, 
It is difficult to choose, 
Some may have other fish to fry, 
And therefore we refuse. 
CHORUS. 
He must be neat; he must be sweet, 
His brains in his head must be ; 
He must not stare at girls whene'er 
He walks abroad with me. 
He must not drink, he must not think, 
When I 
speak, to make reply, 
Work every day, give me his pay, 
None other need apply. 
I 
fancy that with such a 
man, 
Life would a 
pleasure be ; 
But where to find just such a 
man 
Is what perplexes me. 
Perhaps he may be here to-night, 
Collected in the throng; 
If so, I 
hope he'll step right up, 
I'll make the rest all right. 
He must be neat, etc. 
Written by Sr DEVERE. 
Nov long ago, while riding down 
In a 
car to the lower end of town, 
A 
gal got in who was dressed in brown, 
She was a 
nice young girl from Harlem. 
Her style was great—eordd not he beat— 
I 
winked at her, she smiled so sweet, 
I 
walked right up and took a 
seat 
By this nic young girl from Harlem. 
I 
spoke and said I 
meant no harm, 
She carried a 
book upon her arm, 
She said her farther owned a 
farm, 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
She said she was going to meet her pa, 
Her little brother and dear mamma, 
She was " giving me taffy " and " tra-la-la-la," 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this girl I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two _flours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten-dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back—but I'm waiting still 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
UNCLE RUFF. 
As sung with immense success by HAnny IlLooDuoon. 
OH! when I 
was a 
little piccaninny, 
I 
used to love old Massa and Missus too; 
They brought me all the way from old Virginity 
And not much work they ever made me do; 
But now I'm growing old, yes, and feeble, 
And my hair is all a-turning into gray, 
And when the leaf is brown upon the tree, 
'Tis then old Uncle Huff will pass away. 
Muffle up the banjo, put away the bones, 
The jawbone and the fiddle hold aloft, good lamb, 
Place my old white hat on the peg behind the door, 
And say good•bye to poor Uncle Huff. 
The Lord has given me orders to be ready, 
And I'll be on 11:knd when Gabriel blows his horn. 
I 
thank the Lord for keeping me so steady, 
To meet Him up on high when I 
am gone. 
They say that heaven is a 
mighty kingdom, 
With corn and cotton fields so bright and gay, 
Where there is no oberseer and but one master, 
And from where de darkeys ueber runs away. 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE BUGLE. 
W ritten by NED GOSS. 
As sung by Goss and Fox. 
You may take me to the east, 
You may take me to the west, 
But I'll hear the bugle sounding in the morning; 
On the land or on the sea, 
No matter where I 
be, 
I 
will hear that bugle sounding in the morning. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up towards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up toward the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Just at the nick of time, 
When we reach the dividing line, 
We will hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
We'll see sinners on that day, 
Flop their wings and fly away, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up toward the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Yes, they'll look up toward the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
DENNIS GRADY'S HACK. 
By ED. HARRIGAN, as ring by ALFRED ANSON. 
Last Sunday afternoon I 
took. my wife and children, 
I 
hired Dennis Grady and his beautiful painted hack; 
Across the river Hudson, where there's seagulls by the million, 
We were out for a 
day of pleasure to the town of Hackensack. 
Cuoncs. 
I'll ne'er forget the hour my wife and my boy, Tack, 
We all got inside to take a 
ride in Dennis Gray's hack. 
Our horses were first class, fresh and rosy.from the stable, 
A dapple mare named Barney that would stand without a 
whoa— 
And a 
little sorrel gray that he called Hardly Able; 
He was a 
honey cooler when he determined not to go. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
A 
funeral came along, these horses them did follow 
Right behind the hearse in a 
regular dead march line; 
Denny said " get up," like a 
trapper be did holler, 
But right or left they wouldn't stir till they saw a 
tavern sign. 
• 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
Denny gave them water with the devil in his eye, sir, 
Saying, " I'll make the blackguards trot," 
Then the horses gave a 
wink just as if they said 
"Mister Grady, you're dry, sir; the devil a 
foot 
Will we move from here till all hands get a 
drink."

ST. 
PATRICK'S MORN. 
Written and sung with great success by ITENur CARNEY, at TONY 
PASTOR'S Theatre, New York. 
THERE'S a 
day that comes but once it year--the 17th of 
March, 
And upon it every Irishman is drinking ; 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they 
play! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking, 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock is our button holes adorning ; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout Hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamrock don't be scorning ; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's (jay in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky ; 
He's a 
coin or two to spend, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night be goes to bed feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning ; 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " Bedad," he 
cries, 
"It's St. Patrick's day in the morning." 
Then shout Hurrah, etc. 
And. when parade begins, och, it's murther for our shins, 
Such hustling and bustling and squeezing ; 
Then of drink there's such a 
lot, and it's always thunder-
ing hot, 
So there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the band and pipes are blowin' to the chune of 
" 
Garry Owen," 
For to have another chime we would be scorning. 
It's the finest bit of spree that ever you did see 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Then shout Hurrah, etc.

GRASSY CLAD IILLLSOF OULD IRELAND. 
As sung by JouN FIELDING. 
Let every one cherish the land of their birth, 
No matter what creed on the face of the earth, 
With conviviality, friendship and mirth, 
And charms their own little sire land ; 
For it's all botheration to spake of a 
nation, 
Or run down its station from bottom to top; 
The same sky is over its wheat and its clover, 
The time it moves o'er its strength to each crop. 
Cuoitus. 
Hurrah for the hills and murmuring rills 
Where the shamrock illumines the mire land! 
Hurrah for a 
home. musha vilan och hone, 
Near the grassy clad hills of ould Ireland I 
In praise I 
will sing of that swate little place, 
Its name from my bosom will ne'er be erased 
Until the cold turf o'er may body is placed, 
'Neath the soil of my d. or native Ireland; 
Where there's rale hospitality, friends in reality, 
An abundance of charity always in store, 
Plenty to t 
ate yer with, milk and potatoes. 
And plenty to greet yez with, whiskey galore. 
Hurrah for the hills, etc. 
Those fond recollections of Erin asthore 
Will never be effaced from my mind, I 
am sure; 
For my heart dwells in transport on that little shore, 
Near the grassy clad hills of ould Ireland ; 
For near those hills a 
place is, where a 
swate little face is, 
Whose presence it graces a 
chine little cot, 
A sweet little creature, an angel of nature, 
Her features if once seen would ne'er be forgot. 
Hurrah for the hills, eto.

YOU MAY 
LOOK, BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH, 
Sung with overwhelming success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be obtained at SPEArt & DEnNuorr, 717 Broad-
way, New York, HARRY MONTAGUE'S sole publishers. 
When I 
was a 
boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I 
had a 
very had habit of helping myself; 
My mother put every thing out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say : 
CHORUS. 
You may look, but you mustn't touch, 
Mutsn't touch, keep your hands off, 
You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude. 
(
Repeat.) 
At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me : 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid, 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this : 
You may look, etc. 
When we were engaged, I 
said, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day; 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her say : 
You may look, etc.

D. C. 
Sung with great success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
You see I 
am so very good, I 
never claim a 
thing 
That don't belong to me, you know, for that would be a 
sin ; 
I 
assure you I 
am honest and as truthful as can be, 
And I 
wouldn't think of picking up what don't belong to 
me. 
While walking down the street one day, by a 
policeman 
I 
was stopped, 
NVho said, " I 
think this purse, young man, from your 
coat pocket dropped ; " 
Now, as I 
never carry one, I've so little cash, you see, 
Like an honest man, I 
said at once, " It don't belong to 
me." 
CHOP.US. 
It don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You'd better inquire of somebody else, it don't belong 
to me; 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about it, it don't belong to 
me. 
My wages being very small, I 
live in quiet style, 
But with the girls I 
kth-de-dah, and the agony I 
pile; 
( 
1 ) 
IT DON'T BELONG TO ME.—Coneluded. 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I've got lots of cheek, 
They little think I 
do the grand on eight and a 
half per 
week. 
One day I 
bought a 
waffle, which I 
popped inside my hat, 
For I 
saw a 
lady coming along, and I 
knew she'd stop and 
chat 
My hat blew off, the waffle fell out, the street boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said, " It don't belong 
to me." 
I 
never saw that waffle before, etc. 
I 
occupied a 
front room in a 
house not far up town, 
And in the back room lived a 
girl, whose name was Jenny 
Brown, 
Whene'er I'd chance to meet her, well, I'd pass the time 
of day, 
And have a 
little talk with her, in a 
friendly sort of way. 
The other night when I 
got home, oh 
what a 
dreadful 
scene, 
And my landlady asked of me, " Now, what does all this 
mean ? 
"Miss Brown has gone, but left behind this bundle, as 
you see." 
Said I, " You quite surprise me, but it don't belong to 
me." 
I 
never saw the bundle before, etc.

have it for dinner and tea. 
Sonic folks take their ills, one by one, just like pills, 
But I 
usually swallow the box. 
First it rains, then it pours misfortunes by scores, 
And calamities follow in flocks. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come--
Troubles and bothers, one after the other, 
Still they come, still they come— 
There's nothing but trouble for me. 
I 
wish I'd been dead on the day I 
got wed, 
'I'would have saved me a 
terrible life, 
For nobody knows what I 
could disclose 
Concerning the friends of my wife— 
There's my mother-in-law, and her sisters a 
score, 
And relations a 
wonderful share. 
They come and they stay, and they wont go away 
For no matter how many are there. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they came— 
Uncles and cousins, and aunts by the dozen. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Boarding and lodging with me. 
I 
once thought I'd enjoy a 
sweet baby boy, 
To cheer me, and cause me delight. 
I 
didn't mind two, and with four I 
could do, 
And I 
thought that with six I 
was right : 
I 
put up with my fate when the number was eight, 
But the tenth brought me sorrow and woe, 
For now she begins—just think ! to have twins, 
Although I 
may try all I 
know. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Doctors and nurses, and babies : I 
cusses, 
Still they come, still they come— 
A 
very large family for me. 
DAN AND TEDDIE'S PARTING. 
Written by C. B. DOCKSTADER for HCRI.EY and MARE. 
Sung with success and made popular,by DENTLIN and D UCEY. 
I AM bidding you good-bye, Dan dear, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm leaving Ireland far behind, 
Going to America; 
Thin you be good to mother, Dan, 
And little Patsey, too, 
I'll get work in America, 
And send for all, of you. 
ClloRUS. 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, 
Teddie, are you leaving ? 
Let your heart be of good cheer, 
And try and not be grieving. 
Bear this parting like a 
mall— 
Teddie, I 
will try, 
Good-bye, Daniel, 
Farewell, Teddie, 
Daniel—Ted—good-bye. 
Our home will be a 
sad one, 
-Whin you have gone away, 
And we will watch until a 
later 
Comes across the sea. 
And mother says her prayer shall ' 
oe, 
God speed her own son Ted, 
Yes, you'll be always in our mind, 
Each day we break our bread, 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, etc. 
So now I 
must be leaving you, 
But, oh, it won't be long, 
I'll save up every cent I 
earn, 
For I 
am young and strong. 
And whin I 
reach America, 
I'll be soon sending home 
The money for my brother Dan, 
To come across the foam. 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, etc. 
DO YOUR DUTY WELL.

THERE'S a 
maxim I 
can give, 
Simple, clear, and true, 
Teaching you the way to live, 
Showing what to do. 
Stand by this where'er you go, 
Wheresoe'er you dwell, 
Be your station high or low, 
" 
Do your duty well." 
CHORUS. 
If you would from care be free, 
Every grief dispel, 
Let your motto ever be 
" 
Do your duty well." 
If you rule yourself aright, 
If you persevere, 
You may make the future bright, 
Though the past be drear ; 
Every man must play his part, 
Sorrow comes to all, 
But a 
light and cheerful heart 
Makes the trouble small. 
If you would, etc, 
Don't let envy fill your mind, 
If upon the road, 
You should meet a 
friend and find, 
His a 
lighter load. 
Though you have more hardly fared, 
Lessons you will learn, 
Which will make you well prepared 
When the tide shall turn. 
If you would, etc.

THE sun was shining at twelve at night, 
Keep it dark ! 
When this individual first came to light, 
Keep it dark! 
My mother deserted me, how could she do it ? 
My father he landed me one with his boot ; 
Some are brought up by hand—I 
was brought up by foot, 
Keep it dark ! 
You can safely believe every tale that I 
tell, 
Keep it dark ! 
For I 
never tell truth if a 
lie does as well, 
Keep it dark ! 
At school my romancing got me in a 
mess, 
For I 
was so untruthful, I 
blush to confess, 
Schoolmaster advised me to write for the press, 
Keep it dark 
The ladies wear dresses remarkably tight, 
Keep it dark! 
Their beautiful forms are developed to sight, 
Keep it dark ! 
If they took my advice, you'd certainly find 
They'd wear them much looser before than behind, 
For the very best way to bamboozle mankind, 
keep it dark ! 
I'll let you off easily, just for a 
treat, 
Keep it dark ! 
And I'll tell you some news the next time we meet, 
Keep it dark! 
If you don't quite agree with the things that I 
say, 
With my rhymes on the times in my topical way, 
I 
can easily alter them some other day, 
But keep it dark 1 
HEROES, 
Written by C. R. DOCKSTADER. 
Sling by Miss ALICE HALE. 
ON 
the struggle for freedom our forefathers had, 
On a 
war for dear home and sweet life, 
Brave Washington came in his glorious way, 
And led through the terrible strife ; 
And when the loved union of states was attacked, 
A 
savior was asked for the land, 
The spirit of Washington came to the task 
And he raised up Abe Lincoln's strong hand, 
The father and savior we call them now, 
And they we're both true to the core, 
They were wise, patriotic, noble and brave, 
And hearts of great heroes they bore. 
Men sometimes do wrong when they mean to do right, 
But we should always bear closely in mind, 
It is nature to err, in these low grounds of sin 
But forgiveness is truly divine. 
No man ever lived on the face of the earth, 
On the land or the treacherous sea 
Who was better to friend or truer at heart, 
Than gallant old Robert E. Lee ; 
He was just, kind and good, beloved by the world. 
Life was done, when his sword he gave o'er, 
He fought for his dear native 8,,nth like a 
god, 
And the heart of a 
hero he bore. 
There's a 
country we love for the brave hearts she bears, 
And they call it the gem of the sea, 
"Cis the land that produces the stout Irish lads, 
Poor Ireland I 
wish you were free ; 
Will the sun never shine on you brightly again, 
Through the dark clouds that shadow you now ? 
Oh ! why can't you break the cruel bondage chains, 
Ne'er again to their laws have to bow ? 
You had brave sons who fought, yes, and died for your 
sake, 
In the year of '98 on shore, 
And their names are enrolled in the history of fame, 
For hearts of true heroes they bore. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung with great success by HARRY M ONTAGUE. 
W HAT care I 
to-day for the world and its way, 
I 
can smile when the poor they do frown ; 
Though rich I 
have grown, there's no one can say, 
The poor man I 
ever put down. 
I 
help him along when I 
find him in need, 
What more would you ask me to do— 
But it's this that I 
want to impress on your mind, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me to-day in this costly array, - 
Who knows what I 
yet may go through ? 
So you'll find just as far as equality goes, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Last night in the street a 
poor man I 
did meet, 
Who asked me if aid I 
would give, 
I 
extended my hand at the poor man's demand. 
Yes, says I, my dear friend, you must live. 
I 
gave him assistance, he thanked me and said, 
It is hard, sir, but what can I 
do ? 
Says I, my dear friend, be that as it may, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, etc. 
In conclusion I'd state, though your lot may be groat, 
Don't think yourself bettor than all, 
But bear this in mind, for its truth you will find, 
The greatest of men sometimes fall. 
Tho' the poor man may w{-
tizt and the rich man may 7tave, 
There's one thing I 
know to be true, 
Let death come a-knocking at either man's door, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, etc. 
I 
AM COMING, DARLING, COMING. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Companion to " Little Sweetheart, come and kiss me." 
Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by CHAS. D. 
BLAKE. 
I 
AM coming, darling, coming, 
Down the dear old shady lane; 
Tho' the birds and bees are humming, 
Yet my heart is filled -with pain : 
For I 
know that I 
will miss you, 
Something softly tells me so ; 
So I'm coming, just to kiss you 
Once again before you go. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am coming, for I'll miss you, 
When you wander to and fro; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
I 
am coming, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
Bat in menfry sweet and low, 
Thoughts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I 
am coming, etc. 
I 
am coming where you wander, 
'Neath the shadows down the lane ; 
And I 
dreamed of days o'er yonder, 
When in joy we moot again ; 
Future years will keep no sadness, 
In their store for you and me ; 
All the days shall smile with gladness, 
When our hearts united be. 
I 
am coming, etc.

SHE LAUGHED BEHIND HER FAN. 
Words by HARRY HUNTER. 
Music by P. 
BULLEN. 
Published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
MET her at a 
ball 
As beautiful as day. • 
Of graceful figure, slight and tall, 
And hair like golden spray. 
I 
said this is a 
happy chance, 
And I'm a 
happy man, 
And as I 
led her out to dance 
She laughed behind her fan. 
CHORUS. 
She laughed behind her fan, 
And said " You naughty man, 
You shouldn't do so, it's wrong, you know ! " 
And laughed behind her fan. 
We danced the Lancers and Quadrille, 
Then rested for a 
while, 
But once we nearly had a 
spill, 
Through some one's clumsy style. 
I 
clasped her waist more tightly then, 
'Twas neat and sweet to span, 
And when her eyes met mine again, 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc. 
I 
saw her to the carriage door, 
When it was time to leave, 
I 
fancied, but I 
wasn't sure, 
She slightly pressed my sleeve, 
I 
squeezed her hand, the old resource, 
The good old-fashioned plan, 
And as she felt the gentle force 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc. 
I 
saw her in a 
month or so, 
One Christmas party night, 
And then beneath the mistletoe 
I 
claimed the season's rite. 
She said " Oh, dear ! my husband's here, 
I'm sure you never can !" 
And I 
felt queer, for much I 
fear 
She laughed behind her fall. 
She laughed, etc.

FREDERICK ALPHONSO. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, a 
swell superfine, 
My clothes are all cut in the latest design, 
Two yards of necktie and gloves rather small, 
My figure and manner eclipses them all ; 
Some think I'm a 
Count from a 
far foreign shore, 
But no—I'm a 
clerk in a 
large dry goods store ; 
I 
sell the ladies their ribbons and bows, 
Each one is delighted as from me she goes. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; I 
make a 
favorable impression on the 
ladies—I 
mean, of course, the young ladies. 
The other 
day one came in, and sitting down on the little revolving 
stool, said, " Heigh ho !" " High hose, did you say, 
miss ? 
Certainly, we have them very high. 
Do you 
went 'em plain or striped ?" 
She blushed, and said she 
ilidn't mean that—she was only sighing. 
Well, no won-
der—that's the way with all the girls—because you know, 
CHORUS. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, the king of the swells; 
Frederick Alphonso can charm all the girls ; 
The ladies adore me, and say I'm divine ; 
I'm Frederick Alphonso—a swell superfine. 
I 
wear a 
bouquet in my cream-colored coat, 
And great standing collars encircle my throat ; 
I " stand up " my tailor till fortune is kind ; 
When dressed up in style many friends I 
can find, 
The wealth and the fashion invite me to dine, 
It makes the girls jealous if I 
should decline ; 
They'll have none but me for a 
walk or a 
dance, 
For Frederick Alphonso their hearts can entrance. 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, etc. 
When business is over I 
walk up Broadway, 
I 
dine at the club when we close for the day ; 
I 
call on Miss Flimsy and chat for a 
while, 
She says I'm " recherche " in figure and style ; 
She talks French and Spanish, and wants to learn Greek, 
From morning to night she sings " speak to me, speak ;" 
She's bright as a 
fairy and gentle and mild ; 
Besides, she is rich, and her pa's only child. 
SPOKEN.—And she realizes the important fact that— 
I'm Frederick Alphonso, etc.

UNDER the snow, the cold white snow, 
My darling she's sleeping to- night, 
A 
chaplet of flow'rs encircles her brow, 
her brow now so spotless and white ; 
They laid her away in the cold, dark grave, 
Where the moonbeam's silv'ry light 
Shines down on her home where the willows wave 
Above my darling to- night. 
CHORUS. 
Sleeping to-night, sleeping to- night, sleeping, 
Steeping, sleeping to- night, 
Sleeping, sleeping ' neath the cold white snow, sleeping. 
I'm sitting to-night in her lonely room, 
The midnight hour draws near; 
Methinks I 
hear thro' the silent gloom, 
My loved one's step on the stair ; 
Ah, no ' twas the sound of the wind harp that sigh'd 
Through the ivy that climbs round the door ; 
For my darling's at rest, she's an angel now, 
And her step I'll hear no more. 
Sleeping to-night, etc. 
Spring, with its fragrant vales and flowers, 
Will soon be here again ; 
In wooded dell, and vine- clad bowers, 
I'll seek for my darling, in vain ; 
When sunbeams shall fall on her lowly bed, 
I'll strew there sweet emblems of love. 
And where snows never come, and flowers ne'er fade, 
I 
will find my lost darling above.

travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a uppiv. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very groat. 
DY.S53.E3-1SIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of :Uteri WS

Why 1 because these Granuiles go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent, matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
Era 1.hu Cho:era, liTcars it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merino's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" I DON'T KNOW WRIT AILS ME!" 
How often do we hear this remark. 
A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exescise, loss of appetite, deep grief—all these tend to 
render the fluid.; of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit, from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This i precisely the effect produced 
by l'icr!in's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

H EALTH GRANULES" will prove a great saving of 
health and money, as their timely use will avert attacks

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using M erlin's 
H ealth G ranules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels—lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout. 
WAKEFULNESS AND SOMNAMBULISM, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
ct these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No ! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep-walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

Such is the innocent and admirable com-
position of " M ERLIN'S HEALTH GRANULES," 
that their action is most gentle and grateful, 
while at the same time thorough and search-
ing. 
They do not produce violent irritation, 
followed by increased torpidity; on the con-
trary, their action is tonic and permanent 
The torpidity and loss of tone of the bowels, 
which so often occur in advanced age, will be 
remedied by these precious granules, thereby 
increasing- health and sirenglli, and prolong-
ing existence.

NERVOUS' DEMLITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but siinpl— by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granal...i. 
One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache ? 
Von are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the lire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Titerlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention 13 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prevented by using Mer• 
lin's Heath Granules as a 
family medicine.

“COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER.” 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool ; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is aIwaYs the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of dig _ 3tion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflannnations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. Pleasant. 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good enets after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
