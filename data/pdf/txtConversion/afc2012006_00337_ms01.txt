Grandfather came from Lloyds of London to join the port of Houston to join Adams and 
Porter Insurance. Knew how to write insurance for cotton cargo. Had racing sailboats on 
Galveston Bay. Father grew up among these race boats and learnt to navigate them. 
Father joined coastguards in WW2. Was youngest Lieutenant Commander on a destroyer 
during WW2. After war bought property on San Jacinto River and wanted to do 
something with the Marine industry. Bought a number of acres of property. Built a barge 
repair yard named it Southwestern Barge Fleet Service. Attention was to fleet, barges, 
and then began repairing barges. Barges would carry steel pipes or coal. Bought a dry 
dock. started cleaning barges and built a dock to clean them. Started out as a welder's 
helper. People would dock chemical barges that required cleaning.. Came to work on the 
shipyard in 1970-72, had 10  men on steel repair, 3-5 people on barge cleaning. Helped 
them at the cleaning docks, Cleaned all sorts of barges. Acetone barge, gasoline barges. 
By 1980, had a boiler and could hot water wash and clean. Can remember cleaning 
cyanide barges. Developed technique called the Noah's Ark method. In the 90s, air 
controller board said another way has to be found to control the gases.  
 
00:08:44 
Left the shipyard in the 90s to start own business doing vapor control as a service. 
Patented a technique to displace the vapors out of the barge with CO2 and push them to a 
flare. Could not get anybody interested in the process. To demonstrate, needed a flare and 
a CO2 vaporizer and CO2 tank. People were interested in flaring. If a tank as heavy oil, 
fill the tank up and get the air out, no air to burn so weld the tank and would not have to 
clean it. Competition used nitrogen gas. Rotated into doing more flaring. Found an old 
vapor recovery unit from Texaco loading unit. Bought an old refrigerator that ran on 
Freon that had good condensers. Could condense cargo out of air. Condensate was liquid 
gasoline which could be put back into a tank. Non condensable could be put back into the 
unit. Virtually no emissions from equipment. Built own equipment. Do a lot of cargo that 
cannot be burned. Competition uses combustion systems. Problem with combustion is a 
constant source of ignition. Always an exhaust tank. Do work for sophisticated tank 
owners. Work on chlorinated solvents.  
Mother's side were sugarcane farmers.  
 
 
 
00:15:29 
Mechanic and a little bit of an engineer. More of a mechanic. Will get a call from 
customer who wants a job done, no patience to meet with customers. Middle son, 
Townsend is a good salesman. Good team. Townsend finds job and talks to customer. 
Keep equipment on Brady's island in a warehouse on the Houston ship channel. (Pause) 
 
(Resume) 
00:18:16 
Keep vapor condenser on Brady's island. Nitrogen truck that holds liquid nitrogen for the 
refrigerant and flares. Have two employees and take the condenser out and setup the 
hoses that connect to the tank. Sometimes job has to go on around the clock. Liquid 
nitrogen is connected and the gas starts circulating out of the tank, through the condenser 
and back to the tank. Get the gas cold steadily and it begins to condense just like a room 
air conditioner would condense water. Cargo vapors gas back to liquid and come out via 
a pump to a storage tank. Tank degassing. Can control the emissions.  
 
00:23:23 
There was no way to recover vapors or stop emissions at the shipyard. Process is 
environment friendly. Use liquid nitrogen. Evaporates when it spills. 4 man operation. 
Small office. Want to expand business.  
 
00:26:36 
Born in 1950 in Houston. Dad was born in Houston too. Moved to River Oaks in the 
1930s. Lived over by Memorial Park. Have three children. Eldest son is the banker. 
Middle son works as sales for the company and youngest son is a petroleum engineer. 
Went to Southwestern Univ. and then South Texas Junior college. North-wood institute. 
Univ. of Texas. Would do $40,000-50,000 of business in a month. At the shipyard did a 
lot of different things. Did Gas freeing differently from other people.  
 
00:31:57 
Do something enough number of times you will find a better way to do it. Both with 
barge cleaning business and condenser. Condenser used to work in three chambers. Used 
Freon to chill. To get freon to chill down to -100 degrees F is very hard. Expensive. Took 
the Freon part off. Solve problem of ice building up on the parts. Delivering version three 
of the equipment to Taiwan.  
 
00:36:12 
"Wanted to do something on my own" Started accompanying father right out of college at 
27 years old. Worked together and lived a few blocks apart. as a kid went down and 
helped sweep the hubber barges. Then no life jackets and no hard hats. Then dad had only 
three or four people working. Used to work till the barge was clean.  
 
 
 
00:41:14 
Back in father's time, on Market street there was a competitor shipyard named Murrel 
Griswal. Had a boat service. They did barge fleeting. On the other side of the property 
was Slim Muscrow. Was a crane operator and a boat operator. Was a plane pilot but 
without a license. He got a helicopter once. Pilot died in mid air. Had to successfully land 
a helicopter without knowing how to. Dad was a dog lover and had a least 10-12 dogs in 
the shipyard. All worked as guard dogs for the shipyard.  
 
00:49:48 
During a hurricane or inclement weather, water would rise up and pose a big problem as 
all equipment was on the ground so would try to get as much stuff up as we could. Water 
would be waist deep.  
 
00:51:07 
Could make a living pushing barges up and down the canal. Cannot do that anymore. 
Consolidation. Niche of tank degassing is expanding. Just the fact that there is so little 
pollution and that we do it safer, it will catch on. There is this concentrated gas in the 
tank and the control device can only handle a certain number of DTUs per min or hour. 
And it computes that the gas in the tank can go through this control device in the amount 
of time that they claim. Can get around it by where they measure the gas concentration. 
Our method is verifiable.  
 
00:55:14 
Patenting is tough because it needs a lot of money to get done. Have only short 17 year 
patent window where there is protection. Have opted for the patent technique. Have 
patents for the process low tank, vapor condensing system and patents pending for other 
aspects of the tank degassing business. Pleased with progress. Matter of funds.

While the waterfront was developing, regulations always got in the way. Permits and 
industrial services. Swamped daily trying to find out about what the government has 
written about the business. Painfully clear that regulators do not understand the work. 
Been very discouraging. So inexperienced, yet so necessary. Pollutants get little attention. 
Can make more money while doing it. Need a good regulating authority.  
 
01:03:00 
Motivated mostly because see it is a better way to do work. Cleaner system.  
 
01:04:35 
There are two types of customers. Type 1 has been doing this work for over ten years. 
Type 2 customers don't do this work very often. When they do they have an unbiased 
opinion and go into the business looking for the best available technique. Real easy to sell 
 
 
to them. Impossible to sell to the others. Some refineries choose to go with the lesser 
model completely aware of the consequences. Frustrating process since they are the most 
logical consumers of the product.  
 
01:08:21 
Not a small business. Customers have millions of dollars worth of storage tanks. Major 
refiners and major mid stream groups. Rule inhibits group that has better technology. 
Inhibits growth and development in pollutant free sector. Have made it difficult to 
participate in business. Very frustrating process.  
 
01:11:38 
Used to work on the waterfront when in high school during summer vacation, weekends. 
Summers worked as a hand in the field, dragging hoses. Learnt from the bottom up on the 
contractors side. Trying to find interested parties for the product. The greatest application 
for the product is storage tank degassing. Major oil groups neglect the maintenance 
aspect of their job. Know about the advantages. But at the mercy of the regulatory 
groups. 80-90% of companies would not be doing this work if not for the environmental 
restrictions.  
 
01:15:07 
Texas A&M, interned with the Astros. Worked for a commercial real estate group in San 
Antonio for a few years. Joined father's business and helping him ever since.. Degree is 
in History and Anthropology.  
 
01:16:54 
Maintenance group has to deal with a lot of salesman. Tricky and difficult for everyone. 
Many public forums to publicize the new technique. But they are all a sham. Big 
refineries will pay to have public forum in big trade shows. But they are not really 
interested.  
 
01:21:05 
Impact of 9/11 on business. Back then, could drive right on to southwest barge, park 
anywhere, heavy equipment always had the key in it. Was very open deal. Now need 
secondary IDs, need background checks to be done before using marine equipment. Have 
a transportation worker ID. Perceived safety process that are put into place in these 
maintenance facilities. Safety at these places is where it was before.  
 
01:23:30 
Might get regulated out of business if we don't become big fast enough. Rules keep 
changing. Could get passed up completely.
