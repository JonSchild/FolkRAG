Song only by DikmoNo and ItTi.N. 
WE 
are two Irish boys so frisky. 
None better sure you could find, 
To twirl the twig and drink strong whiskey, 
Or box a 
big foe, d'ye mind, 
If the four-leaved shamrock we could get now, 
All bare footed- cripples should be shod, 
No poor needle women should starving- sit down, 
But be gay like the boys that carry the hod. 
CHORUS. 
So drink success to Irish laborers, 
Just new over from the sod, 
All we want is laborer's wages, 
We're the boys can carry the hods 
Sure we'r for freedom of opinion, 
None should toil but three hours a 
day, 
We should have no tax in this dominion, 
But men get j 
ust three times the pay. 
All should have roast beef and less salt cod 
Pigs bigget than cows in styes should squeeck now, 
For to fatten the boys that carry the hod. 
So drink success, &c. 
Good clothes and money should gladden the nation. 
AnG honestly rewarded be; 
Starvation should have no relation. 
But Slaves black and white should all be free, 
Then laugh and sing with voice,: charming, 
In spite of every laug tiTt: st:u.ad. 
Just shoulder these ana 
hnc. no harm, 
In these Irish boys that carry thc hods. 
So drink success, ikc, 
DUBLIN POLICEMEN, 
flung only by DILXOND and RYAN. 
WE'RE rattling, roaring Irish boys, 
Come over here to join the force, man. 
To protect the peace, keep down the noise, 
There's none can (1,) it like us, of course, man; 
In our suit of blue there are but few, 
With us can come the Irish dandy, 
.knd if the boys kick up any noise, 
Sure we run them in to the cell quite handy.

Tearing away, 
Always at war and never at peace, man, 
Tue ral a

We're a 
pair of the Dublin new policemen. 
There's not a 
gate nor garden wall, 
About the town but what we scale it, 
And if any thing there we find at all, 
Wouldn't we be fiats if we didn't nail it; 
Next day there is a 
hue and cry, 
Something stole, but to be brief, man, 
And by the hookey, who but ourselves, 
Is running about to cotch the thief, man. 
Tearing away, etc. 
Supposing, walking about all night. 
In every hole and corner creeping, 
Something we spy by the pale moonlight. 
Arrah, by my soul, it's a 
gintleman sleeping, 
His pockets Nl e 
grope, his money we take, 
Then with our sticks on the ribs we're jobbing him, 
And if perchance the poor soul should wake, 
We tell him we thought a 
thief was robbing him.

Rattling Boys of P.addy'a 
Sung only by DiAmoNn and RYAN. 
YE sons of Erin come listen awhile, 
Till we sing in praise of our Emerald Isle, 
Her sons are gentle, brave and strong, 
They can box, fight, dance, or sing a 
song; 
Yes, her sons are gentle, brave, and strong, 
Can box, tight, dance, or sing a 
song, 
For love or friendship, where's the man. 
Like the rattling boys of Paddy's land. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the boys a 
hand can lend; 
To beat a 
foe or serve a 
friend, 
For love or friendship, where's the mao, 
I 
Ake the rattling boys of Paddy's land, 
At a 
race or fair you will rind us there, 
Good-humored with our pipe and glass, 
Dressed in our frieze and by our side; 
bonny, blooming, rosy lass: - 
Whin the pipes strike up you may be-sure. 
Along with our darling we waltz the:floor. 
A 
tip-top jig, that. is the one, 
For the rattling boys of Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc. 
In eighteen hundred and fifty-four. 
Sure our boys to Russia they sailed o'er, 
With merry hearts they went away, 
For to keep the Russian bear at bay; 
12 
There was an awful war and a 
dreadful fight, 
While crossing o'er the Alma's heights, 
We skinned the bear at Inkermann. 
Then we gave three cheers for Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc. 
At Inkermann and Balaclava too, 
Sure the shot and shell like hail it flew, 
Although our numbers were but small, 
We dashed among the cannon balls; 
Although our numbers were but small, 
We dashed among the cannon balls, 
With a 
roaring cheer sure in we ran, 
for to knock down the foes of Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc. 
Then here's success to Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome hand, 
It's the finest land in all the earth, 
The land that gave poor Pat his birth; 
We have no snakes, toads nor frogs, 
Since SL Patrick banished them from the bogs. 
The soil he blessed with his right hand, 
Then bedad. says he, that's Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc.. 
I'M a 
fellow that seldom mks for much, 
I 
never a 
sermon preach. 
And make it a 
practice 
Never to take a 
thing that's out of reaoh; 
I 
don't call out for iced champagne, 
0: anything so dear. 
But there's one thing I 
can't do without, 
And that's my blessed beer. 
Deprire me of whatever you like, 
But don't stop my beer. 
The other day. not feeling well, 
I 
to the doctor went, 
He frowned, and. said you want to stop. 
I 
soon knew what be meant; 
he, you must give up the drink, 
Said 
doctOr dear, 
drink your rnethcine by the quart, 
But pray don't stop my beer, 
You can g) and marry my mother-in-1*w, 
But don't stop my beer. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girt, 
A 
beauty I 
do declare, 
I 
asked her if she'd be my wifo, 
She sdid of course, my dear; 
But you must give up one bad fault. 
I 
began to feel quite queer, 
I 
said, I'll do whatever you like, 
But let me have my beer, 
I'd stand on my head, till nearly deed-
But pray don't stop my boar.

IT'S DREADFUL. 
Written by FRED J. 
M.AcKt.ry for IhAMOND and R YAN'. 
I'M one of those unlucky men, 
And you don't often see. 
A. man so full of trouble 
And misery like me; 
My darling wife has run away, 
With another man, it's cruel, 
Though I 
am sad, my friends all laugh. 
• 
And say 
am a 
fool, but, 
Ws dreadful when you're hungry. 
Without a.bit to eat, 
It's dreadful when you're naked, 
With nothing on your feet; 
It's dreadful when you fancy that., 
You're going to lose your life. 
But ain't it worse than dreadful, 
When you lose your darling wife 
She would wake up in the morning, 
And she'd drag me out of bed, 
Seize hold of the poker, 
And hit me on the head; 
she'd make make me wash and iron the clothes, 
And scrub the floor as well, 
15 
What made my dear wife run away, 
I'm sure I 
cannot tell. 
It's dreadful, etc. 
A 
man named Beach would come sometimes, 
And make love to my wife, 
And if I 
said a 
single word. 
They said they'd have my life; 
She would go to balls and parties, 
And spend my money too, 
If any one has seen her, 
Now tell me where, oh do. 
It's dreadful, etc, 
IN daily life we travel, face to face 
With wear and care, 
'There's curious things on earth, 
We find quite hard to bear, 
But through them all we have to go, 
And each must be endured, 
So trust to luck, and each put up 
With those that can't be cured. 
CHORUS. 
Shout boys, push along, let us all be gay, 
Let us all be gay, let us all be gay, 
Shout boys, push along, and pass the time away, 
For we all could make our fortunes. 
If we only knew the way. 
There's many men amongst now, 
Who's surely seen the time, 
When he could spend his thousandes, 
And with them cut a 
shine; 
But when his wealth had vanished, well, 
What few friends then did say, 
Just come and take a 
drink, old friend. 
And pass dull care away. 
Shout boys, push along, etc. 
So just before I 
go, my friends, 
A 
parting hint I'll give, 
To do your best for every one, 
Yes, live on, and let live; 
For life is but a 
span they say, 
And soon will pass away, 
So let's be jolly while we can. 
And sometimes let's be gay„ 
Shout boys, push along, ate,

Because 'twas only rue.

must bear it, must bear it, must bear it, 
For there, it doesn't signify, because it's only me. 
If I 
go on a 
street on; 
'What I

The people will insist upon 
Treading on my toes; 
And the ladies drag their dresses, 
Covered with mud across my knee, 
And no one will apologise, 
Because it's only me. 
T 
am so unlucky, ete. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
And thought that she luved me, 
But I 
discovered her one night, 
On another young man's knee; 
And he knocked me down the basement steps, 
For we could not agree, 
And some one got bi . nose broke, 
Yea of course. ' twas only me.

And no man can be any bolder,

When war's on all my comrades say,

PleaSe say am I

Courting all the pretty girls, 
That's my heart's delight, 
But as I 
don't want to be killed, 
I'd sooner run titan fight, 
As I 
was out on guard one night, 
The enemy came and caused a 
riot, 
Eyes right, shoulder arms, ah ! ah! 
I 
seized my gun, and yelled hurray 
And like a 
shot I 
ran away, 
Eyes right, quick march. alt ! : di !

THE BEAUTIFUL COLUMBINE, 
Wetten by FRND. J. 
MACTELSY for DICYloND and RYAN. 
NEER 
can forget, last Christmas time, 
Or yet that eventful night, 
When I 
first went to see a 
pantomime, 
And fell in love at first sight; 
It was not with a 
beauty who at in the front, 
Nor one in the boxes so fine, 
But a 
charmer so fair with long g olden 
hair, 
A beautiful columbine. 
As light as the air she tripped round the stage, 
Oh, how I 
wished she was mine, 
And many times too, I 
felt in a 
rage, 
Through that beautiful columbine. 
She came on with a 
bound, and looked so sweet, 
Charming, I 
meant to say, 
And the bouquets I 
had bought to throw at her feet, 
They cost me ten dollars a 
day; 
Oh, dear, how I 
wished I 
was old pantaloon, 
And didn't I 
envy the clown, 
As round she would spin with the harlequin. 
I 
could have knocked that fellow down. 
As light as the air, t.1,.. 
So, one night I 
waited outside the stage door. 
When judge to my greatest dismay, 
21 
The charmer I 
thought both fair and sixteen. 
Was forty if she was a 
day; 
And she had a 
husband, who shifted the scenes, 
And children, I 
think she said nine, 
Then smash went my hopes as well as my love, 
For that patched up old columbine. 
(Patter after 3c1 Verse.) 
SPOKEN.—Only imagine my feelings on ascertaining the 
creature I 
thong t 
seventeen and lovely, was fair, fat, and 
forty, with a 
husband, a 
rocster who used to throw scenery 
about. 
She had a 
face on her that looked liko a 
dirty door-
mat. 
But. there, Shakespeare says, " Beauty is but skin 
deep." 
It may have been so in his time, but if you got a 
bricklayer's pickaxe, and dug in her f 
co two feet and a 
half, 
you wouldn't find the slightest vestige of beauty there, but 
after ell, 
As light as air, etc. 
THE FAIRY QUEEN, 
Written and Composeft by G. W . 
HUNT.. 
I'VE heard folks sing of Home, Sweet Home, 
And the Cottage by the Sea. 
Now I 
knows an establishment, 
What's dearer far to me. 
You knocks four times, then walks upstairs, 
'Till you can't get any higher, 
And in the splendid four pair back. 
There dwelleth my Maria. 
Oh, my Maria's a 
fairy queen. 
Such a 
fairy ne'er was seen, 
Round she goes on her darling toes, 
Round on her tootsey wootsies, 
You should hear me cry, encore ! 
That's the girl what I 
adore, 
My love she's honest, tho' she's poor, 
And all the world to me. 
At night she dances on the stage. 
In white and golden spangle. 
But in the daytime helps her " Mar," 
To turn the ancient mangle; 
At night, swells with their opera glass. 
Her fair form do admire. 
23 
They cries bravo ! but little know, 
That she is my Maria. 
Oh, my Maria's a 
fairy queen, etc. 
1 
parts a " tanner'' twice a 
week, 
Or else I 
gets an order. 
And when my love comes tripping on, 
My eyes ! don't I 
applaud her; 
I 
hear chaps talk about her, 
But l'd sit one on the tire. 
If ever he' tried for to come and go, 
And walk round 17ty Maria. 
Oh, • my Maria's a fairy queen, etc. 
In all the pantomimes, 
bet, 
There's not such a 
fairy queen, 
She looks so sweet, sin ing on a 
cloud, 
In the transformation scene. 
Sometimes I 
fear she'll tumble down, 
Oh, how I 
do perspire,

The Object of my Heart, 
Words by Amos D. ARNOLD. As sung by the ARNOL.3) trtormcrts., 
at 585 Broadway, N. Y. 
THIS season now has opened bright, 
For us to cut the wing. 
So let us now embrace this chance, 
A 
song and dance we'll sing; 
We will sling ourselves clear out of sight, 
'Way off of this plantation, 
And show you tricks you never saw 
Before in all creation. 
cnotn-s. 
Oh I 
I'm (33 jolly, 
And I'm in for folly, 
For we both wear the laurels now, 
And with them we will never part, 
To sing and dance Lere every night, 
Is just the olject of my heart. 
We feel like falling on our heads, 
Our feet they seem so light, 
It's easy done if you know how, 
In it we take delight; 
For sensation now and novelty, 
Is all the rage and go, 
And if you'll notice us a 
while,', 
Observe this fact we know. 
Oh! I'm so jolly, etc.

THE HAT ME FATHER WORE.

FM Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or f3r dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore. 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CliOnt1S. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the test you ever seen; 
'Tams wcrn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my fathEr's great ancestors it dcscended with galore— 
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat tne father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening— good luck to ycu I 
say, 
And wh, n 
I (1'05 a

I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Dallymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's Lind with the hat me ihther 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Eriu's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and

And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father

True To The Core, 
As sung by BILLY H &Y. 
MANKIND drifts along thro' this broad sea of care, 
With some 'tis foul weather, while with others Os fair, 
Some help one another to reach the bright shore, 
While others sit silent, despairing the more; 
I've a 
few words to say it' you'll list to my song. 
Your attention I 
claim, I 
will not keep you long, 
My subject you'll own is a 
new one, I'm sure, 
For I'll sing about men that are true to the core. 
I'll sing first of one whom all Irishmen love, 
Who gave up his life his devotion to prove: 
He died for his country, he cared not for fame. 
And each true son of Erin reveres his dear name: 
f 
mean not brave Richard O'Connor of old, 
I 
mean not staunch Daniel O'Connell the bold, 
Nor Ireland's sweet poet, the warm-hearted Moore, 
But brave Robert Emmett was true to the core. 
And now let me speak of America's friend, 
Who pledged his young life for Liberty's end, 
Hand in band with our Washington, noble and true, • 
Who fought 'neath our banner, the red, white -aud blue; 
• 
From his own sunny France, frm his kindred and tne'. 
Across the broad ocean he f641•ed not to roam, 
Let the battle echoes of old days of yore, 
Tell if dear Lafayette was not true to the core. 
Another name dear to us all here to-night, 
He loved his own comrades who sought to do right, 
When the tierce storm of war overwhelming our land, 
To his country he offered his heart and his hand. 
Tho' some misconstrued him, tho' others may blame, 
They never can tarnish his honor and fame, 
Let the red battle fields on Virginia's shore, 
Echo that brave lfttle Mae was true to the core. 
I 
will sing now of one whom the whole world adores, 
Whose name is revered on all foreign shores, 
America's hero, Columbia's star, 
A 
statesman in peace, and a 
lion in war; 
From the .bloody-stained battle-ground of Lundy Lane, 
From Princetown and Germantown rises again, 
The echo of voices, bring evermore, 
That Washington ever was true to the core.

Darling, I

Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to-day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh ! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes, my darling, mine alone— 
You have never older grown!

But the hearts that love will know, 
Never, never, winter's frost and thin; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Stunmer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc.

PAT AND THE WIDOW-
IRISH SONG . 
As 
sung by MILES "MORRIS. 
IN Ballinaha, wanst there dwelt a 
fair widdy, 
Renown'd thro' the country for beauty and wit, 
Tho' coorted by many she cared not for any, 
For.Pat wid a 
love-shaft her bosom had hit. 
Oh the glance of her eye sure it bother'd the county, 
' 
TWas bright as the dew on the fresh morning grass, 
And her smile so inviting, set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass, 
And her smile so inviting set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass. 
But Pat was unhappily given to dhrinking, 
And widow O'Grady objected to this, 
For Pat when in whisky was apt to get frisky, 
And folks said he often made off wid a 
kiss. 
Be that as it may, sure the widow spoke plainly, 
And tould him this drinking he'd have to give o'er, 
For she never would marry him while she had to carry him„ 
Drunk and insensible home to his door, 
No, she would never marry him while she had to carry hira, 
Drunk and insensible home to his door. 
So what did he do but he made her a 
promise. 
On Irish ground never to taste spirits more, 
But a 
week after that, and the widow saw Pat, 
And be drunk in a 
boat and asleep on his oar. 
37 
Arrah Pat, is it thus your promise you're kaping, 
On Irish ground never again to get drunk, 
Och don't be abusing me, sure, ain't I 
slaping, 
And can't you parsdive ' tis on water I'm dhrunk, 
Now don't be abusing I113, don't be accusing me, 
Can't ye parsaive 'tis on water I'm dhrunk. 
Then he swore a 
big oath that on land or on water, 
No spirituous liquor again would he taste, 
• 
The widow was pacified and the pace ratified, 
And the fond couple made one by the praist, 
Well your sowl sich a 
habit had grown on the fellow, 
He couldn't abstain from a 
dhrop de ye see, 
And though she had bound him by oath, soon she found him, 
As dhrunk as a 
lord, and he '
up in a 
tree ; 
And though she had bound him by oath; soon she found him 
As dhrunk as a 
lord, and he up in a 
tree,

PAT ,
WON'T 
GO 110Mt TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sang by J. H. RYAN, now Performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, a " Rory the Rover: , 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shillelah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
He calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
CHORUS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah ! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
An night on,a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,humh! none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with 
divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, Sc. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes 'round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep t. 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, ,tc.

THE CHARCOAL MAN. 
Composed and Sung by GEORGE W ELLING, the Gr-nt 
Aut.—Dublin Garman. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my. 
cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if be does go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said I 
was a 
genius and she'd have no other man; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust around the the city and my Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
One day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He upset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his revolver and blew himself off the 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead a 
single life, 
And to peddle charcoal as you see, with no Rosy for thy 
wife. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c.

PADDY BURKE was a 
man of work, from Limerick town he 
came, 
lie married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the namft- of 
Kane; 
Now Pat and his wife, through six years' strife, were mwer 
blessed with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is what sno'd 
cry: 
CHOULLS. 
Rock the cradle, l'at, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore he d 
go 
and ' list; 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, ' twould drive him 
out of his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly 
song: 
Now Paddy Burke, this man of work, he hadn't been long 
away, 
Till his wife fell in with a 
big spalpeen who soon led her astray; 
For three years long there lore was strong, till one fine summer's 
day, 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her favorite lay: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby hale and 
strong. 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his: life, said, 
" 
Who has been here since I 
was gone ?" 
"It was Providence, Pat," she said, " done that, he was good 
to me three years long, 
Ane now you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c, 
THE OUT IN fah CORNEA; 
0011 hone, wirrastew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world 'twos the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in, 
The wide-mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh ' twould make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in, 
To the homes that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
Avd by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimmy, the piper, walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went, dear, with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all hi the corner.

DUBLIN BAY; CM BOY NEILL 
THEY 
flailed away in a 
gallant bark, 
RV 
Neill and his fair young bride, 
lie had ventured all in that bounding ark 
That Cairmd o'er the silvery tide; 
But his heirt was young, and his spirit light, 
And he dashed the tear away, 
As he watched the shore recede from sight, 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sailed, and a 
storm arose, 
And the lightning swept the deep, 
And the thunder crash broke the short repos° 
Of the weary sea bo.'s sleep. 
Roy Neill, he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed her tears away. 
Oh ! Love, 'twas a 
fatal hour, she cried, 
When we left sweet Dublin Bay I 
On the crowded deck of the doomed ship, 
Some stood in their mute despair; 
And some, more calm, with a 
holy lip, 
Sought the God of the storm in prayes. 
She has struck on a 
rock! the seaman cried, 
In the breath of their wild dismay— 
And the ship went down, and the fair young bride I 
That sailed from Dublin Bay. 
OFF FOB DO NEYBROOK, 
Written and sung by THE FIELDING& 
GOOD evening to you, one and all, 
You're looking well I 
see, 
My name 'tis Dan O'Malley, 
And mine 'tis Biddy McGee, 
Do you want a 
jaunting car, maul, 
Yes, sir, I'll take a 
ride, 
I 
want to go to Donneybrook, 
Then lep up by me side, 
Oh! murder, ain't she nate, 
Arrah, musha, am n 
the swate. 
CHORUS. 
Now we're off for Donneybrook, 
For to see the fair, 
Ind won't we have a 
jolly time, 
With the boys and girls there, 
We'll dance and sing and whiskey drink, 
Till our hearts are free from care, 
There is no such fun where e'er you go, 
As you'll find at an Irish fair. 
Then lep aboard, then hop aboard, 
Who'll have a 
jaunting car, 
Hurrah! for Dan O'Malley, 
He'll drive you near or far, 
4S 
Then crack, crack., 
keep the track, 
• A 
goer is my mare, 
Look out I 
say and clear the way, 
Were off for Donneybrook fair. 
Now we're, ezc. 
Oh! when I 
drive a 
jaunting car, 
The heart is light and free, 
And why not. Dan, when by your side, 
Sits sweetThiddy McGee; 
I 
know that, darling, and from me side, 
I 
wish you'd never go, 
Only say the word, drive to the priest, 
And be me word I'll make it so, 
Let to-morrow be the mark, 
Amen says the clerk.

PAT O'BRIEN. 
PAT O'BRIEN is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from where X 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy, 
No country is so dear to me as the little isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and mirth, 
Its equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth: 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare, 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS, 
Pat O'Brien is my name I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came, 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defend, 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land; 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of jastice he caused them all to stare: 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
lie always proved poor Paddy's friend when on his trial he did, 
attend, 
He caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien is my name, dze. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, out countrymen they had to fly 
For, famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but 
hardships to endure: 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each cord 
again 
To welcome back those exiles from across the raging math. 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea! 
And all our toasts be: Ireland free 
and you'll be happy then.

MY NATIVE iliANp SO GREEN. 
Written by F. P. CAREY. 
Sting by JOHN „FIELDING. 
LAM a true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure'does 
abound, 
And good nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
He'll treat you to the very best, quite welcome you will be, 
He'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he will c 
heer, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so clear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Irelend, my native land,so green. 
If e'er_you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have 
at home, 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must own, 
And if you're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, - 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green: • 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile,-
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; ; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so green.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
It was on one oold Winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe. 
'TM she came to her own father's door. 
Oh! father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or the child in my arms will perish and,die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
46 0h! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free, 
But now, doomed-to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The old man was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
But the watch-dog howled and the village bell tolled, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
Baying, " This cold Winter's night she perish'd and died, 
t By the cold wind that blew across the wild moor," 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon, 
And no one, they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gone. 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
'baying, " There Mary died, once a 
gay village bit* 
117 the wind that blows across the wild moor."

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAII3001. 
THERE'S a 
sweet little spot, away down t.„7 Caps Ulu; 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishuter. dear; 
Where the white praties blossom like illigant flowers, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly above the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland, 
In his hat, good Bt. Patrick used always to Re114 
The Shamrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Irak* 
When far, far away, a 
swioet blossom I've seen, 
Pve dreamt of Shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two Wins, on the bogs and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my eys, that with joy my heart fills; 
And Iv'e blessed the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

I'M leaving thee, Erin, dear land of my birth,

I'll never forget thee where'er I 
may roam, 
My dear cherished country, my forefather's home. 
CHORUS. 
Erin we'll see, dear Erin we'll see, 
Thy green flag in freedom float joyous and free, 
[Repeat.] 
The heel of oppression has left its dark stain, 
On Erin's green shamrock that grew on the plain, 
I'll never forget the brave heroes of old, 
That reigned ere my country was bartered for gold. 
Erin we'll see, &c. 
The.dear little colleen that gave me her heart, 
Has kissed me farewell and now bids me depart, 
I'll never forget as I 
plough the salt sea, 
That I 
yet may return to set Erin free. 
Erin we'll see, tte. 
So steer there my bark for that dear happy land--
Columbia, where Irishmen join heart and hand, 
And swear by their honor the world shall yet see, 
The green flag above the red joyous and free.
