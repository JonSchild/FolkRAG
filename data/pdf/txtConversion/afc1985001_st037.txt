Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad
GOIN' DOWN THE ROAD FEELIN' BAD 5128 B1
Gussie Ward Arvin, 1940
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad I'm goin' down the
road feelin' bad, Lord, Lord, And I ain't a-gonna be treated this-a-way.
They put me in the jailhouse on my knees They put me in the jailhouse on my knees They
put me in the jailhouse on my knees, Lord, Lord, And I ain't a-gonna be treated this-a-way.
They feed me on corn bread and beans They fed me on corn bread mad beans They fed
me on corn bread and beans, Lord, Lord, And I ain't a-gonna be treated this-a-way.
I'm goin' where the climate suits my clothes I'm goin' where the climate suits my clothes
I'm goin' where the climate suits my clothes, Lord, Lord, And I ain't a-gonna be treated this-
a-way.
