Julia “Kay” Foltz (b. 1969, Chillicothe, Ohio) was raised in Pickerington, Ohio and now lives in 
Pleasantville, Ohio. She works as a rural mail carrier in the Pleasantville and Rushville, Ohio 
areas, working out of the Bremen, Ohio post office. Her mother had been a post office clerk in 
Pickerington and inspired Foltz’s interest in working for the Postal Service. Foltz has delivered 
the same route for 23 years, since she went full-time as a rural letter carrier. Currently her route 
is 67 miles long and has 575 mailboxes. In this interview, she speaks about animal encounters 
she’s had while delivering her route, the supplies she carries with her in case of bad weather or 
car trouble, and her relationship with her customers. Foltz speaks of the service rural carriers 
provide to rural communities, as their “eyes and ears,” and their knowledge of who lives where 
in rural communities and small towns. Foltz was joined in this interview by her daughter Emma 
Moore.

EH: Okay. It is May 8, 2022. It's Mother's Day and I'm in Pleasantville, OH. Why don’t you 
introduce yourself and tell me your name, where you're from and the year you were born? 
 
KF: Julia Kay Foltz. I got by Kay. I was born in Chillicothe, Ohio in 1969. Grew up in 
Pickerington, Ohio but now live in Pleasantville.  
 
EH: Why don't you tell me how you got interested in becoming a rural mail carrier? 
 
KF: (dogs bark in background) Well, (laughs) I had little ones and no work and I took the test for 
the rural carrier exam, I guess, I'm not sure what they call it. My mom worked for the Post Office 
and she encouraged me strongly. So (laughs) I took the test and they needed a carrier in 
Rushville, so I got hired as an emergency hire, didn't even have to take the test, but that was 
good!  
 
EH: Oh nice! 
 
KF: (laughs) 
 
EH: What did your mom do for the Post Office? 
 
KF: She was a clerk in Pickerington, Ohio.  
 
EH: Why don't you tell me about those first days on the job and how you learned the craft? 
 
KF: Well not being from this area at all, I didn't know any place. I didn't know any of these roads 
except for where I lived. That was where I knew. My first day on the route I got lost at least 3 
times. In fact another carrier from another town called my office (laughs). "I think your carrier's 
lost!" And my muffler fell off the first day. Yeah! That was a good day. Yeah, I learned, back 
then we just did the mail raw, we didn't have anything in order so you were in the office in the 
morning and sorted all that mail which took me a long time to learn. I always said if I have to 
learn another route and quit, it was terrible. (laughs) But you just do it every day and you figure 
it out.  
 
EH: So when did you become--did you become full time eventually? 
 
KF: Well yes, I did. The carrier that I worked for was a sub for 13 years and opinion here--I don't 
think he liked to work much so he got fired. And I was, I think I got full-time like 2 and a half 
years after I started which is unusual. Yeah. So.

EH: Why don't you walk me through a typical day on the job from when you get into the post 
office to when you get home at the end of the day? 
 
KF: Alright. My day starts at 6 in the morning and I'm up and out, get my coffee, head to work. I 
get to the office. Once we get to the office, we go through our flat mail which is magazines you 
know, envelopes, big envelopes, what nots. Then I case my letters and then I still case all my 
mail. I don't take it out raw, but. Then sort our packages, load up the car, head out for the day. 
I'm in the office probably for an hour and a half, two hours, and then I'm on the route for 
generally 5-5.5 hours. So. Then we get back and take all what's left over back in and that's it!  
 
EH: How long is your route and how many mailboxes? 
 
KF: It varies, the number of mailboxes right now. Ours is, my count keeps going up. It's a lot of 
people are moving out, but, moving out to the area. I've got 67 miles and 575 mailboxes. 
 
EH: Wow. And have you done that same route since you went full time? 
 
KF: Same route. 23 years! Yeah. Same route.  
 
EH: So why don't you tell me about the relationships you've developed with your customers over 
those 23 years. 
 
KF: I have met so many fabulous people. I can't even tell you how many. There's so many that 
have passed. I'll tell you a story about one guy. Mr. Moates (sp?). He's passed, his wife is passed. 
They lived out on Old Rushville Road and for some reason they liked me a lot. (laughs) I liked 
him a lot. He was just the sweetest old man. He had the thickest glasses I have ever seen in my 
whole life. He was legally blind. One day I was out and he was mowing his yard with the riding 
mower. His front yard's got a big gulley in front! I mean it's a huge drop off and he's mowing his 
yard and I'm like, I--he stopped to get out to talk me like he usually does. I said, how are you 
mowing your yard? I know he couldn't see. He says, "Well I can remember my yard. I remember 
it. I memorized my yard." And I'm like, holy cow!  
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
KF: He mowed that yard from memory and it was not a small yard. It was a big yard. Trees, 
everything. But one Christmas he came out and gave me this present and it was a tube and it was 
wrapped in newspaper and electrical tape. Wrapped up, wrapped up, and I'm like...okay. I used to 
get kind of neat stuff. But he had given me these three little glass vases and you know, they were 
obviously old. And quite dusty. But it was so sweet. And then his wife took me aside and told me 
that he really wanted to give me a Christmas present and they didn't drive anymore so he found 
these 3 vases that his mother had gotten when she was young and married and he wanted me to 
have them. And yeah, I cried a little bit. (laughs)

EH: That's very special.  
 
KF: Yeah, I still have them. 
 
EH: What about other customers that you stop and talk to, have gotten to know? 
 
KF: I have so many customers. 
 
EM (Kay's daughter): You could talk about that little boy. Don't you have a little boy that brings 
you cards and stuff? 
 
KF: Oh yeah! (laughs) I'm his first girlfriend! (laughs) He told me he loved me! He's probably 4, 
5. And yeah, he runs out to the mailbox when I'm there and he gives me presents every holiday 
and it's been going on for like a year and a half now. He still runs out to me when I'm out there 
and so he's a...little Hunter. He's a cute little on. 
 
EH: Nice. What are the other special gifts people have given you over the years? 
 
KF: Well mostly over the years, I've gotten food. A lot of food. A lot of cookies. And I had this 
one little old lady. She had really good cookies. They were really good cookies! And then after 
she passed away--and we'd eaten her stuff for years. She passed away and they had to gut her 
house because it was so filthy and the cats were in everything and I'm like... We'd eaten that food 
for years. It was good! I guess the cat hair did something to the flavor, I don't know, but it was 
good food! Anyway, another food story. I had this lady, she, for some reason she didn't like me. I 
don't know why but she didn't. That's okay, not everybody has to like me. I don't get paid for 
people to like me. But (clears throat), pardon me, she used to make the best zucchini muffins. 
And... 
 
EM: I remember that! 
 
KF: Yes. These muffins were really good. She didn't want me to have any of them. But she 
wanted the postmaster to have them.  
 
EM: [unintelligible] 
 
KF: Yeah, our old postmaster Lavetta to have them. And I'm like, I gotta go up to your door and 
get these muffins from somebody, she don't like me! I mean she's really you know, just a 
crotchety old lady. Anyway, she didn't like me but she loved Lavetta. So she'd be like, "Now 
these are ONLY for the postmaster!" And I'm like, "Holy..." Yeah really, I'm taking them. 
 
EM: [unintelligible] 
 
KF: Oh no, no, no. But this is...so I took the muffins and let me tell ya, those were the best 
muffins I ever ate. In my whole life, those were the best zucchini muffins. Lavetta only got half 
of them! (laughs) I took my share out. They were good.

EH: So you took a sort of tax. A delivery tax. 
 
KF: Oh most definitely. Yeah, she had to pay postage on them one way or the other. And so, as 
far as postage goes, stamps, I sell stamps on the route. And I've gotten eggs. I just, people want 
to trade for stamps. Well, I usually do! But eggs, mostly I get eggs. They're really good! I like 
fresh farm eggs. 
 
EH: Yeah! So what kind of people are on your route? What things do they do, how old are they, 
that sort of thing? 
 
09:09  
 
KF: The population on my route used to be a lot older, but I've been on the route long enough 
that a lot of my older customers are passing or have passed. Pretty sad because I just love most of 
them and they've passed and we're getting a lot of newer people from out of the area, which is a 
little different because they expect their mail service to probably be more urban than what we do 
(laughs). I'm not (coughs) pardon me, at your mailbox generally at the same time every day. It 
strictly goes by how much mail I have. Some days I have a lot of mail--I'm gonna get there late. 
Or early. 
 
EM: Detours, road conditions. 
 
KF: Detours, yeah, I have detours. So the customers are a little different. And I've been out here 
long enough that I'm used to the old way. 
 
EH: So are they moving in from the city do you think? 
 
KF: Yeah. I think it's--what do they call that the urban spread? sprawl? Whatever. I think you 
know, as Columbus gets bigger and bigger now, even where I grew up, Pickerington was a cow 
town. You know, it was rich but it's not anymore. You know, there's nothing you can't get in 
Pickerington now. So a lot of the people that liked that kind of area are having to move further 
and further out to still get it or to have a yard big enough for a garden or animals or whatnot. So 
yeah, the customer base is definitely getting younger, which you know, now I'm feeling old.  
 
EH: (laughs) What about the...well first could you describe the landscape on your route? 
Especially for someone who's never been to this area--what it looks like? 
 
KF: Well my route is, it's very country, it's very, it's hilly. It's beautiful. You know, the change of 
the season is definitely, it's nice. It's nice to be out in it. But it is very rural and it's kind of poor. 
It is. It's a little poor. We have a lot of dirt and gravel roads. Actually though the more new 
people moving in I guess the more vocal they are about the roads. Some of the roads are a lot 
better than they used to be! (laughs) I guess that is a thing. They're used to paved roads so some 
of my back roads are a lot better than they used to be. Snow, Perry County, they sometimes 
throw a rock out and call it a day on those roads. I have--they didn't use to, I'd be the only person

down some of those roads. You'd now because it was in and out of the mailboxes. I'd make my 
own path every day. People just didn't leave. That's changing a little bit now. Like I said, newer 
people, they all work. They're not as, you know. But it's a nice place.  
 
12:20  
 
EH: And would you say the landscape has changed? Sounds like more urban sprawl and less 
farmland? 
 
KF: The farmland is definitely starting to change. I've got a lot more new builds. We've actually 
got city water coming into some of those areas. Yeah, they're putting city water out, which is a 
huge change. A lot of people that have been there for a long time are not happy about having to 
pay a mandatory water bill now. You know, it's a burden for the older people that are out there 
not living. They're not living high off the hog so to speak and now they're getting more amenities 
that they didn't want, didn't ask for and are having to pay for because some of the newer people 
are moving in and that's what they're used to and by God, that's what they're gonna have, so that's 
what it is! But you know, change is hard.  
 
EH: Yeah. What about weather? Has that changed at all noticeably? 
 
KF: Honestly, I know that climate change is a little bit more touchy, but not really! I mean I'm 
out in it, I don't, probably more rain. I think we have a lot more rain than we used to. 
 
EM: You have flooding on some of the roads. 
 
KF: Yeah. They're fixing some of that flooding but honestly, not--I haven't noticed a lot. But I 
guess when you're out in it every day, change creeps in and you don't notice it as much so 
maybe. 
 
13:52  
 
EH: Yeah, let's talk about how you deal with weather conditions. 
 
KF: Holy moly! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
KF: When it's hot, it's HOT. 
 
EM: Can I add to this? When we were going to school, my sister and I would be SO excited if 
we were gonna get a snow day. We would be like doing our little snow dances. We would get in 
trouble for hoping that we would get a snow day. Now to this day--I'm a teacher--and I'm not 
allowed to hope for snow days in her presence!

KF: (laughs) That is a true story! Yeah. Snow sucks! (laughs) Yeah, the snow's bad. In the 
winter, you just bundle up 'cause your window's down. And it's in the summer it's like 10 degrees 
hotter in the car than it is outside. You're going slow enough that the heat from that motor is 
coming in too. And it gets hot and let me tell you, some days you don't want to get close to me 
when I'm done with the route. I'm offending myself by the end of the day. But in the winter, it's 
cold. Your feet get numb they're so cold because even with the heater because I have my own 
car, a lot of it flies out the window. The snow, it blows in. I've had frozen hair (laughs). Frozen 
hair from just the wind and the storms. The snow drifts. I've gotten stuck I don't know how many 
times in the snow. Actually I've gotten stuck in the mud! My route is pretty rural. I mean it rains 
a lot! And you get stuck in the mud just as you can in the snow. But definitely the, and it's hard 
sometimes in Ohio because it could be 30 degrees in the morning in 75 at night and so you're like 
layered up so you can layer back down. I mean, start taking the layers off. It gets cold in the 
morning and hot in the afternoon. But... 
 
EH: Yeah. So what do you bring supplies-wise? Do you bring any cables or chains for your tires 
or other equipment along with you? 
 
KF: I take cat litter, I have a shovel. I don't do chains. Shout out to Buick! I always drive a Buick 
because they're heavy. And honestly, I had a Blazer and even in 4-wheel drive my Buick would 
get in and out of places that I would rather take it than the big 4-wheel drive Blazer. So my car is 
the most important piece of equipment I have. I always try to get the heaviest car I can get that I 
can fit in 'cause I'm short so I have to have something small enough. But I carry, I don't actually 
have jumper cables anymore. I probably should. I don't. I carry oil, I carry brake fluid, I carry 
transmission fluid, I carry any fluid that you might need on the route, I carry, because I have 
needed every one of those over the years, even the coolant. The antifreeze--I carry that. So I 
carry all that. And a funnel, because I didn't have a funnel. I had to use a piece of paper--make a 
funnel to put stuff in once and yeah, I'm funneling a piece of paper. Pardon me. I keep a spare 
jacket, which usually after being in the trunk for a while it gets a nice smell to it. I carry plastic 
bags because I don't like bringing packages back and a lot of houses don't have porches on my 
route. It's not city so they don't have big porches. So there's nowhere to...so if I need to leave 
something on the porch and it's raining, I have to bag it up so I can leave it. I carry a mallet 
because I can't reach some mailboxes. I hook the top so I can open 'em. I carry a screwdriver. 
 
EH: You bring a lot! 
 
KF: Yeah, I have a lot. Plus the various little forms I need for work. Those all fit in the glove 
box. Everything else is--my car, poor thing. I love my car but it is, it's always dirty. It's always 
filthy dirty. It gets just so dirty from the route. Just stuff blowing in, dirt, dust, and if you pass 
somebody on these backroads, you almost have to pull over you can't see. There's so much dust 
out there. But it's a nice place.  
 
EH: Well let's talk about the vehicles you've had over the years. 
 
18:32

KF: The number one vehicle--mostly just Buicks! I've had Buick Centuries. I have a Buick 
Lucerne now, which is gonna be a problem actually in the future because they don't make bench 
seats anymore. Or 40/60 splits. Everything's got the console in the middle now. My leg does not 
bend that way. 
 
EM: So why do you need a bench seat? 
 
KF: Because I actually sit on the wrong side of the car to drive. And not being able--yeah, they're 
getting older and rustier and so. But I've had...I had a Blazer. I can't remember what the kind of 
first car I had was! It was an old, it was a hooptie. Like I said, the muffler fell off the first day. 
We didn't have a lot of money to buy the car so I think it was like a $300 car. Well I got what I 
paid for! (laughs) It was a Chevy but I can't remember. Actually I think it might have been an old 
Impala. 
 
EM: Did they all have bench seats? 
 
KF: It had a bench seat. It was vinyl.  
 
EH: Yeah, that sounds hot. 
 
KF: No. That was the last vinyl car I ever had. Vinyl interior. The, yeah that's it. Oh wait, I did 
have a newer Impala a few years ago but that didn't last very long. I think it was already beat up 
when I got it. 
 
EM: How many cars have you gone through do you think? You used to buy a new one pretty 
often! 10 cars in 20 years? 
 
KF: Yeah.  
 
EM: That's insane! 
 
KF: Yeah. We get paid VMA which is vehicle. It's equipment allowance, whatever. At the end of 
the day though, I'm out of pocket when I have to keep replacing the cars because you can't, yeah. 
Brakes every 3 months. Tires twice a year. Which is a lot. 
 
EM: And there's no way that what they give you can cover that sort... 
 
KF: The insurance, the car, the equipment, the maintenance, just the oil changes and the brake 
jobs. Luckily Ralph can do brakes, otherwise I'd be in serious you know, I mean he does a lot of 
maintenance that I don't have to take out. But yeah, we go through a lot of, yeah. 
 
21:07  
 
EH: What about animal encounters on your route, so that's wildlife, domesticated, livestock?

Interview with Kay Foltz – 5/8/2022

KF: I have seen, the most recent one that I had to actually call people about (laughs) was I was 
going down the road and I just left the mailbox and this thing comes down from the sky and it's 
like (bird sound] eagle, and it was a bald eagle! I had never seen one out here and I've seen 2 
now. But I didn't know they ate roadkill. I did not know that. I had to look it up because I was 
like, "Why is, why did that eagle..." I mean it was coming toward my car. It saw me at the last 
minute and veered off but I thought that thing was coming in my window. I swear to God I was 
like (gasp) you know you get the whole jelly legs after that. But it was the coolest thing ever. I 
have seen fox families. I've seen, I went around the corner on one of my township roads and 
there was a horse standing in the middle of the road. I, yeah, I was skidding in the gravel to stop. 
I did not expect the horse. I've had to wait out at turkey crossings. It's one time I had so many 
turkeys. I count, and I was counting them. I counted like 42 turkeys. That's how many I saw. You 
just sit and wait for them to cross the road. Deer--I always see deer. I've had, I've run over at 
least 2 snakes a year on the road sunning themselves. They don't, they look like a stick 'til you 
get right up. You can't stop. And... 
 
EH: A black snake do you think? 
 
KF: Usually black snakes, yes. Although I did have a different snake. I took a picture of it. I'm 
not sure what kind of snake it was but it was coiled up and the girls, my daughters was like "You 
shouldn't have done that!" It was like (makes sound). Turtles, I see turtles. I help them cross the 
road. It's silly but they, people run them over! I don't know why but they do. It is terrible. So if I 
see turtles, I usually pick them up and you take them the direction they're going. Off the grass. 
Squirrels. I'm probably the number one squirrel killer in Perry County.  
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
KF: They are like suicidal and as much as I try to avoid them, it doesn't always work. 
 
EM: [unintelligible] owl? 
 
KF: Birds, I have nests of birds. At least, especially this time of year, I am stopping, pulling over 
to let birds out of my car because they nest in the box and then when I get there and open the 
thing they fly out into my car. Then I'm pulled over trying to get the birds out. This happens all 
the time. I've had, I have a place on my route where the cows get loose. And they're little cows. 
They're smart! I didn't know cows were really smart. But these cows get out and when they see 
me, they'll run back across the road and get under the fence! Because I swear, they know I'm 
gonna tell on them. Anyway, so they get out. I've had charging goats. They even have a sign up 
that says, "Beware Charging Goat." I don't go in there anymore (laughs). That goat's scary! One 
time I was going down the road and there was a line of cows going down the side of the road and 
I stopped because there was a flipping buffalo! I was like "There's a buffalo!" How is there a 
buffalo? So I'm like stopped on the side so I could of course get pictures 'cause I take pictures of 
anything. And the buffalo's sitting there looking at me and I'm sitting there for a minute and I 
thought, "I don't know if buffaloes are nice. I should probably not sit here so close." Because he's 
kinda doing the whole (blowing through mouth noise). Making the buffalo sound. I don't know 
what that...so I did move along but the buffalo was weird and the other weird one, I swear it was 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Kay Foltz – 5/8/2022

a weasel. I didn't know there was weasels out here but this was a weasel. I saw it. I know what a 
weasel is, it's a weasel. Everybody tells me I'm crazy but it was a weasel. (laughs) I know it was 
a weasel! It was not a groundhog. It was the longest, skinniest groundhog I'd ever seen in my 
life. It was a weasel. And I've, I really love wildlife so I'm fortunate that I get to see a lot of it. 
And that is a good perk of my job. The kind of birds--I love watching birds and I'm glad my 
daughters liked it too. But I get to see lots of birds, lots of just animals! I see them every day. 
Hawks--that is a change--I must say, since I started the route. The number of hawks that I've seen 
versus there are so many more now than ever before. Some's the size--just a little bit bigger than 
a blue jay. Some of them are BIG--really big. But I do like the increase in the number of the 
birds I've seen.  
 
One funny animal story--it's also a people story. I had an elderly gentleman that always picked 
up his mail. Well his mail started building up. I'm like, building up and building up, so I called 
the sheriff’s office to do a wellness check and whatnot and I had a certified, actually I had a 
certified [letter] for him. That's why I called the sheriff’s office was the certified. I had gone to 
his door and the smell was so bad that I thought for sure somebody was dead in that trailer. It 
was, it was...shirt over your nose bad and I was just like holy moly. So--that's my phone--and so 
I called the sheriff's office and told them that you need to really go check. His mail's building up 
and there's a smell (laughs). Well they had gotten ahold of us the next day and it was the Perry 
County sheriff, and we're actually--my office was in Fairfield County. They had driven to 
Fairfield County to tell us to never call them to go back to that place again. That he was fine--
they found him--he was visiting his sister in Florida, but he had pigs living under his trailer. A 
bunch of pigs lived under his trailer, and the smell, I had never smelled anything like that in my 
whole life, it was so bad! I thought for sure he was dead in that trailer. He wasn't! It was the pigs 
that he had, were under his trailer. Who thinks of that? 
 
27:52  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
KF: Yeah. I don't know but it was awful. It was truly bad and so that's my animal stories. 
 
EH: That's funny. What about lunch, do you pack a lunch or bring snacks along with you? 
 
KF: I shouldn't say this with EM here. I am horrible at eating lunch on the route. And I cycle 
through because sometimes, this was my favorite for a while and then you know, I get tired of 
stuff, but right now it's a bag of chips. I know! Not probably the best, healthiest lunch. I don't 
know what else you put in a dusty old car. You can't really do a wet sandwich. It gets gross. And 
I drop things so, yeah, I have my coffee in the morning and usually I try to get some sort of, 
something with actual fiber in it (laughs) in the morning. The rest of the day is usually what I get 
at the carryout. And I usually buy a sausage every day for a dog on my route. 
 
EH: Oh nice.

KF: I don't think he gets much attention. He's tied up on 2 log chains. So I give him a Slim Jim 
every day. He runs out to meet me now. 
 
EH: Yeah, I bet! 
 
KF: Food, yeah, I don't drink a lot. I don't drink very much at all on the route because I am 15 
minutes from the nearest bathroom and I'm running out of places I can go on the route. I used to 
open both doors and make a little stall for myself and have an extra roll of toilet paper in the car, 
which is also part of my equipment, and now they built a house up the hill from where I usually 
used to go halfway through the route. I just you know, do the whole...yeah, I can't do that. So I 
don't drink much on the route. The more you drink, the more you gotta go. And that's a long, if I 
have to stop and go into town to go to the bathroom, that makes for a longer day. 
 
30:00  
 
EH: What about your coworkers? Have you developed relationships with your coworkers over 
the years? 
 
KF: In Rushville, it was basically 3 of us and honestly a lot of the people cycled out a lot. I was 
the only full-time besides the postmaster. Most people want more work than that. Crystal has 
been the longest. She now does an aux route. I've known her for a long time. But I truly love the 
people I work with. We see each other outside of work sometimes but I work with really good 
people.  
 
EH: And are you a member of the NRLCA? 
 
KF: Yeah, I'm a member of the rural letter carriers’ union. I have been since I started. But my 
dad was a union guy. There was no getting out of that (laughs). You always, you join the union--
it doesn't matter! (laughs) So yeah, I am a member of the union. 
 
EH: Let's see. What do you think the importance of rural delivery is for the community you 
serve? 
 
KF: The community I serve. Rural letter carriers, they really are important. We serve more than 
one function of delivering mail. Now we deliver a lot of packages which we didn't used to 
deliver so many of. But honestly, we're the eyes and ears of the community a lot of times. There 
are some older people that I may be the only person they see for days. They don't really get out 
much. I you know, I really do keep an eye on my people. Things are unusual. I take note. I have 
a lot of customers even like during the pandemic when everything shut down, I used to carry a 
lot of toilet paper in my car. I mean honestly, they didn't get out! And they were afraid to now, 
and just being an inconvenience to not being able to go out. I would give them toilet paper or you 
know, I'd ask people if they needed things. But the rural delivery, as far as letters go, who doesn't 
like getting a card in the mail? Everybody likes getting a card in the mail. I don't care who you 
are. You like getting your personal mail. People out here, that's how they still pay their bills. 
That's how they get their bills. They get everything important to them comes in the mail.

Medication. I deliver a lot of medication. So it is important. It's not just for the mail. There's a lot 
more to it. It really is a service that people if they didn't have, I think our country would be a lot 
different. You know, just everything from, and I know people, the ads, everybody always laughs 
at junk mail, but there's a lot of important junk mail too. I know a lot of ladies who spend their 
day looking at catalogs! There's nothing else to do! They read every bit of that junk mail. It is 
part of their daily routine and if they didn't have it, there is a lot more to mail than just you know, 
getting a bill in the mail. I have... it is important. And I know the days of you know the internet 
and the computer, well that's not always safe. Things get hacked, things get, the internet out in 
our area is not always reliable either. So we have a lot of people that they really don't even get 
the internet and they can't afford the satellite internet. So you know, they don't do their banking 
over the computer. They still do all of that. I still have old people that get boxes of checks. 
They're still writing checks. There are people that still do that! (laughs) As much as we all hate to 
be behind that person at the grocery store! You know, they really do. It is important. It's their 
lifeline. I sell money orders. People still pay their bills that way. That's a financial service as 
well. They give me the cash and we fill out the money order and that's how they pay their bills 
still so without that I know a lot of people don't realize that there's still a lot of people that don't 
live in the modern tech world. They still live very much in the country, they're very rural, and 
they're not gonna change and that's okay. But that's why we're there. 
 
34:55  
 
EH: How has your work changed over time? 
 
KF: My work has changed. Honestly the amount of personal letters that I deliver actually has 
gone down. The amount and volume, the volume of packages I deliver has quadrupled. I mean 
there's not even any--on my route I used to get 3 big packages for a whole day. For the whole 
route. Now I look at my packages, I might have over a hundred every day. I mean it's really that 
many. Now granted not all of them are very big packages but still I'm in and out of that car a lot 
for packages. Now we have scanners. We have to scan everything. We never used to scan 
everything! We could leave things with the neighbor, it was fine, but now we've got to scan 
where everything's delivered. Scan everything. It's a lot different that way. The mail has 
definitely changed as far as being able to track things and whatnot. 
 
EH: Mmhm. What was it like delivering during COVID, aside from giving people toilet paper, 
making sure they were okay, but were you concerned and how did that change your work? 
 
36:21  
 
KF: Yeah, actually, it was a concern. It still is. I mean COVIDs still a real thing. I did not wear a 
mask on my route. I'm usually far enough away from people that I didn't worry so much about 
that. We wear a mask at work. You know, I have hand sanitizer in my car now which was never 
a thing! (laughs) Yeah. I just really tried to make sure that you know, people had what they 
needed. Yeah. 
 
EH: What are the kind of unusual stories or an unusual day on the job that you tell people about?

KF: Ah. It's not usually days, it's more incidents. (laughs) I had a postmaster once that it was 
really bad. The snow was horrible. I couldn't keep my car on the road and she was sure that I 
could deliver that mail. And I was like, alright, you're coming with me 'cause I can't do it. We're 
calling it a day. She's like, no we're gonna go out. So she went out with me and we got about a 
mile down the road and we were in the ditch TWICE going down the road. TWICE! So we're in 
the ditch waiting for somebody to come pull us out, which is usually somebody on the route with 
a chain. Anyway, he, while we're waiting for him to come pull us out, somebody actually made it 
out on the road and were taking mail into the post office but decided we were sitting there, so 
they'd give us the mail. They asked us if they could give us the mail while we're sitting in a 
ditch! I'm like who does that? We're in a ditch! We're stuck! And I'm stressed out and you're 
wanting me to come out to get your mail? Okay. I got the mail and the guy that pulled us out told 
us that it was time to go home. I was like, thank God. Lavetta. So we went back to the post 
office. It was ice and snow. It was horrible. Another day snow related, I was going down the road 
and I did not realize how bad the drift was. You couldn't see the drift! I mean it was white on 
white. And I'm plowing, the drift was bigger than my car. And I just gave it some gas and 
thought, "We ain't getting stuck in the middle of the drift!" 'cause I'm on the wrong side of the 
drift to boot. So I made it through the drifting. That was scary. That was probably the scaredest 
I've been besides the dump truck. But that was very scary. Most of it's weather related. I've been 
in floods. Those are bad days. Yeah, you're out there by yourself! A lot of times you know, my 
car will break down (laughs) and I get help with that. Used to have a guy that owned a junkyard 
and one of my coolant lines broke. Well the hoses had a leak in it. There was no going anywhere 
with that. Well he got me back in his junkyard and he went and found a garden hose and I didn't 
even know you could use a garden hose to temporarily fix your car, but he did! I finished the 
route and made it home! So I got home and we went and bought a coolant, but he rigged it up! I 
don't know how he did but he was out there cutting his garden hose and doing this and that but I 
figured he owned a junkyard, maybe he knew what he was doing! He did! I got home! Brakes, 
my brakes go get really squealy some days and I did learn how to pry back the squeaker bar so 
they did not make noise the rest of the route so I could get done and just you know, finish the 
day! So I've been lucky that I've had a lot of people that helped me get through those kinda days. 
But yeah, there are bad days. I don't... 
 
Ah, I know a story of the worst day! This was actually toward the beginning of my career and it 
was a flat tire and I had gone back to deliver this package and there was a gang of boxes that I 
delivered to, but the package was back in, I had never been back there so I'm back there driving. 
This wasn't even a lane. It was like 2 ruts in the grass, trying to find a house somewhere and I 
just got an instant flat tire so I had run over something. And I had to walk. There weren't cell 
phones back then. I had to walk at least a mile up the road to find somebody to help me. I mean 
my car is back in the middle of nowhere. There was not even a tow truck getting back there! And 
finally this lady, her nephew, she got him to come out and help me. Well I'm back by a shack. 
There's nothing! I don't even know why this shack is back there. There's nothing near the shack! 
(laughs) And so he walks up, never says one word. Not one. He takes my tire off and gets up and 
leaves. And I'm like "Oh my gosh!" He goes in that shack and I'm like, I thought for sure there 
was an ax in there. I thought for sure I was gonna die that day. I mean that was scary. It was 
quiet. There was nothing. He didn't say one word. He was gone for like 10 minutes. And I was 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Kay Foltz – 5/8/2022 
15 
 
standing there like--what do you do? I don't know what to do! I am literally thinking he's gonna 
kill me and nobody's gonna ever find me or my car ever! (laughs) No cell phones, nothing. And 
he comes back like 10 minutes later, puts the tire on the car and leaves! Puts this little spare tire 
on, I'm like...Thank you? Never said a word, just walked back off into the woods! I was like oh 
wow! That was something you wouldn't see in the city! No, that was scary! Honestly! I mean 
I've never been back there again. They get a notice if they get a big package. I don't go back 
there. No.  
 
42:40  
 
EH: Have you had other concerns about safety on your route? 
 
KF: Um, just one guy and I don't, and this is kinda, I don't even know if I should tell this story. 
He was a little, he had mental health issues. We'll just say that. But he used to jump out from 
behind bushes and run in front of my car.  
 
EH: Whoa! 
 
KF: And if I saw him even in the yard, I would just keep going because I didn't know what he 
was gonna and it ended up, he did, he set himself on fire inside his house and actually died. I 
mean it was sad. Very sad because you know, mental health problems, you know there's nothing 
you can...back then people didn't talk about it. People laughed about it but they didn't really help 
people as much as...thank God that's turning around as well. But he was scary. I don't...he scared 
me. But no, honestly most people out here are just pretty real. I don't really get too afraid of too 
much of anything. Those two incidents though, those were scary. I'm more afraid of crazy 
drivers.  
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
KF: ... than people, so. 
 
EH: Right. What do you like the most about your job? 
 
KF: I like that I'm on my own a lot, that I don't have to you know, my own boss most of the day 
(laughs). I like all the people. I truly love the people on my route. I actually like getting to see the 
seasons change. I like being out in it! You know, I probably wouldn't do well in an office. You 
know my car is my office. I really like being, I just like it. It's nice being able to see people. I 
watch kids grow up. Some kids I know stories about them now, they just look at me, because I 
know they remember (laughs). I've seen lots of naked people! 
 
EH: Like answering the door or just kids running around in their houses? 
 
KF: Well, mostly kids. I've seen a lot of wardrobe malfunctions! I could tell you a few people 
who are circumcised!

EH: (laughs) 
 
KF: Just because their pants are all torn up. I'm like dude your pants got holes that big--wear 
underwear! I don't even know what to say about that! But yeah, I really like being able to help 
people and you know that's what I do a lot besides deliver mail. If people need things I you 
know, they know that I'm there and that's...yeah. 
 
EH: Do you listen to the radio or books on tape or anything? 
 
45:34  
 
KF: I love my radio. What I really love is Sirius XM! I used to listen to a lot of NPR but you 
know a lot of stories are the same. You hear the same stories a lot. And the radio stations out 
here, once you've heard their line-up, you can pretty much know what their line-up is after 5 of 
it, you know what's coming. So I got the, I love listening to old detective shows (laughs). 
 
EH: Oh yeah!  
 
KF: I really like the stories. I like stories. 
 
EH: Like Dragnet? 
 
KF: Oh yeah, I listen to those. The classics radio. I really, really like that. Sometimes they'll do 
sci-fi. I love the sci-fi. I just like all of it. And they don't have that now. You can't turn on the 
radio and hear stories. Everybody's so into their TVs but I really love the stories. They have what 
is it like a CNN channel, even like Anthony Bourdain, there are so many different things--even 
NPR has stuff on there. I'll listen to them. They do a lot of podcasts that you wouldn't hear on 
regular NPR. I love the Moth Hour and all those shows and I can listen to those all week 
now.  So I do love the radio. And I listen to the radio at home too, so. But I really love the old 
shows. I didn't know I loved those things but I really do. They're addicting! 
 
EH: Oh yeah, they're very fun. 
 
KF: And sometimes I'll see somebody coming it's getting to the end of the show, I'll have to 
drive a little slower so that I can hear the ending! Terrible. Who did it? I gotta hear it! But yeah, I 
do listen to the radio. 
 
47:20  
 
EH: What do you think the future of rural mail carrying is? 
 
KF: Honestly, I don't see it and I hope I'm right, I hope it doesn't change a lot. Maybe equipment 
might change. Things might change as far as job requirements, this and that, but I hope the job 
stays the same. I really do. For the people I hope it does. You know, the society right now, even 
money, people don't carry a lot of money. I know I don't. But I hope the mail doesn't go that way. 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Kay Foltz – 5/8/2022

I hope that it stays the same. I think it keeps us all connected. You know, everybody has their 
post office they can go to, everybody you know, can send a birthday card. The Mother's Day 
card, the Christmas card. And I hope that that keeps going. I think it's important that we stay 
connected in that way. Not everybody uses the phone every day. Not everybody uses, watches 
TV every day, but everybody gets mail. And I think that it's important to our society that it 
doesn't change, to be honest with you. And we're out there, we see it and things go wrong, you 
know, I did hear one thing that the post office is in charge of and I was surprised, if there was 
any kind of [cataclysmic] tragedy, you know, we're in charge of finding out who's dead and 
alive? 
 
EH: I didn't know that. 
 
KF: Because we know who should be where they should be. And if you go to a town, like our 
small towns, I'm the only person that knows where everybody's at! I'm the only person that 
knows who's at what house! And I think that's important that we always have somebody like that, 
that's not a government entity as far as like you know, law enforcement or the court system, 
because we're not that and people know that. You know, yeah. So. 
 
EH: How did, I wonder about examples of when that's been the case. Like maybe the Buffalo 
Creek Flood in West Virginia when a mining slurry pond basically decimated an area, I wonder 
if the Postal Service was responsible for seeing who was affected? 
 
KF: I'm sure they would have asked! You know, that's more of a local scale thing but that would 
be the only person that would know! 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. 
 
KF: You know, I know if your kids went to college. I know if your mom died or if she went into 
a nursing home. And if they're looking for your mom, well they don't have to look for you mom. 
She's over you know, she went to the nursing home! I would know that. And you know what? A 
lot of people wouldn't. Even the neighbors anymore wouldn't know who goes in what house. 
Even on our street. I know most people but some of the newer neighbors, they're not really--
they're not people people! (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah! 
 
KF: So you know, I don't know. I don't have too many secrets, everybody knows me. But yeah. I 
think that that is an important. That is important! 
 
EH: Yeah, I talked to one carrier in Kentucky near Bowling Green and she had delivered a letter-
-she knew that this...this address no longer existed. But she knew that the person who had lived 
there was kin to another person on her route, so she delivered it to them and it had turned out to 
be somebody, like their niece, or they were the niece of this person who had Alzheimer’s and 
was in a hospital in Louisville and was writing to her parents who were long dead. Like, "Mom 
and Dad, they're treating me so well here. I should be home soon." And that never would have 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Kay Foltz – 5/8/2022 
18 
 
gotten to a family member had she not known, "Oh I think the people who used to live in this 
house that no longer exists were family with this other family." And she was sort of saying, no 
one will have that knowledge after I'm gone. She grew up in that community and knows 
everybody. 
 
KF: Yeah. Definitely, we do that. We deliver a lot of things that only get delivered because we 
know who's there. I mean even simple as a wrong address, no number. No address! I still get 
things addressed Route 1 and I'm not even Route 1 anymore because we moved into a delivery 
office, it's a different office even though I'm the same route. Yeah. We deliver and I'm sure that's 
the same all over our whole country, that we deliver things that would not get delivered if we 
didn't just know who should be where they should be! Yeah. 
 
EH: Well is there anything I haven't asked you that you would like to share? 
 
52:25  
 
KF: Mmm...not really! 
 
EH: Okay! That's totally fine! 
 
KF: (laughs)  
 
EH: Well thank you so much! 
 
KF: You're welcome! This has been a pleasure. I really, I am thrilled to be a part of any kind of 
project that brings awareness to just the simpler life I guess (laughs) out here in the middle of 
nowhere. 
 
EH: Yeah. Well thank you, this was great.
