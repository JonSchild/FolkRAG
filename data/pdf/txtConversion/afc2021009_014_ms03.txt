CH 00:01
Good afternoon, and we are back with Dr. Barbara Jones Hatcher because she has such an illustrious
career that we didn't want to leave out any of her important contributions to the career of nursing. Happy
holiday to you. How you doing?
BH
Fine.
CH
Good, good. As a part of your activities with nursing, you were once the Chair of the District of
Columbia's Board of Nursing. You want to talk to us about that experience?
BH
Well, you know, yes, I can. Actually, I started out as Chair of the Registered Nursing Board, but during
that time, they were looking at the Health Occupation Revision Act, and under that Act, they combined
the RN and the LPN board. So, I ultimately became Chair of the Board of Nursing that covered both the
RN’s and the LPN’s and Advanced Nursing Practice.
CH
What year was that?
BH
You would ask me that [both laugh]. It had to be in the 70s, but I'll look it up. There's a Health
Occupation Revision Act. I can look that up on my phone and will give us an idea of the timeline. But in
that Act, we did become one of the first jurisdictions to have more or less independent advanced practice
nurses, and that was the Certified Nurse Midwives, Nurse Practitioners, Nurse Anesthetists. If you go
back, look at the history, they did have prescriptive authority, which a lot of states took them years to do
that, and they remained under the Board of Nursing and not the Board of Medicine. In some states, they
were either duly overseen by the Nursing Board and physicians, so we got the prescriptive authority, and
actually, they could practice independently. We had one of the nurse midwives to, in order to test out the
law, set up her own practice and, you know, was able to have that practice. She did have a collaborating
physician. That we call “collaboration” but not supervision by the physician. So, we were one of the
early jurisdictions for that. There was a lot of confusion and complications to get to that point, but we
were able to get there and to get those rules and regulations approved.
CH
Being able to work independent of a physician, were the nurse practitioners awarded all rights? Like,
they didn't have to have a physician to sign for narcotics or--
BH
‘Cause they have their own prescriptive authority.
CH
Okay, so they were totally independent.
4
afc2021009_014
BH
Totally, but we had to put in the collaborating physician. So, you had to say, “This is my collaborating
physician.” He didn't have to sign for you, you didn't have to be in his practice, but you had to say, “If a
patient's condition was beyond what I could handle as a nurse practitioner, I would refer them to this
person.” With nursing, the problem came that most nurses worked in organizations.
CH
They had to have that physician oversight.
BH
They probably did in some of these organizations, but they still would report to nursing, but heaven
knows what the medical guidelines were in some of the hospitals.
CH
You also participated with the National Institutes of Health’s D.C. Initiative to Reduce Infant Mortality.
Tell us about that.
BH 05:35
Well, the NIH D.C. as it was called, the NIH D.C. Initiative to Reduce Infant Mortality, it took in most
of the hospitals in the universities and the Health Department. I was at the Health Department at the
time, and I became the site principal investigator for the Department of Health. So, there were various
studies that are still talked about in print today related to various aspects of prenatal care in the District
of Columbia. I worked primarily in the barriers, motivators and facilitators of prenatal care in the
District of Columbia, so we looked at various aspects of care, including having a lot of focus groups
with women to find out how they felt about care. Also, you know, working with physicians, social
workers, and others to look at care. I think the thing that stands out the most to me was doing a focus
group at D.C. General with addicted mothers.
CH
D.C. General was the city hospital for District of Columbia at the time, which is now closed.
BH
I mean, when we reported on, the people at NIH, and particularly the physicians, were kind of, like, in
shock, because the mothers told us that people treat them like addicts. Like, they were pregnant, they
kind of knew they should get off of drugs, but everywhere they went for help, they were treated like a
junkie instead of a pregnant woman. It would start with them trying to get off of drugs. So, say finding
out they're pregnant, they go get off of drugs but, of course, they're having problems. Then, they would
go to the drug treatment facility to try to get medication to help them stay off, and if they hadn't used
drugs in the last 48 to 72 hours, they wouldn’t give them treatment, which meant they went back on the
street and did drugs again and it would take them another three to six months, if ever, to try to get off.
Like, when we brought that up, people were, like, in shock.
CH
Yeah, that's such a tragedy.
5
afc2021009_014
BH
So, people were, like, literally turning them away. There was this, I guess, a special clinic at D.C.
General, and they said the doctor-- they said they will come in the room and they will talk about you but
never to you. They said they will come in the room and they’d look at you and, you know, maybe
[inaudible 9:31], and then there was this big conference with their backs turned to you and they talked
about you and never talked to you. They were like, “What?!”
CH
They didn't offer any dignity for them being a person.
BH
Then, so, they felt like, “Well, how were we supposed to get off? Everybody treated us like we were
trash.”
CH
And like they should just stay on drugs if they didn’t have a [10:04].
BH
And they weren’t worth--
CH
Legitimate help. How did your study help to change that?
BH
Well, some of the policies and drug treatment did change about how to treat pregnant women, and I
think most facilities became more aware of the need to give these women some additional care. But,
most importantly, talk to them. How are you a doctor? Bunches of doctors going on their rounds in a
room talking about somebody with your back turned to them.
CH
Yeah, no dignity. You know, that's so disrespectful.
BH
It was me and I think there was one other person. We were, like, in shock, you know, ‘cause these are
the women that is nurses and, particularly in public health, you are out in the street trying to get these
women into care. Then, if you try to go get them in care and they can’t get in care because of stupid
things like you didn't use drugs in the last three days when you're trying to get off of it because you're
pregnant.
CH
And you care about your unborn child, literally care about them.
BH
And then knowing they will have to go back on the street, and once they got back on the street, they will
do drugs again. So, it wasn't helping the baby and it wasn't helping the mother. Well, I think it’s one of
6
afc2021009_014
the best things we, you know, [12:06], and that was only through, you know, focus groups, just talking to
people and asking them how they felt about their care.
CH
Nurses and doctors take a oath to first do no harm, and that was a very hurtful and harmful act that they
were exhibiting towards these people who, these women, who need help. They're addicted. It is a
disease, and your job is to help that person and they weren't being offered any help. I'm happy to hear
that there were some policy changes made.
BH 12:56
The other thing we did, because I was also over Healthy Start, we hired the first perinatologist for D.C.
General.
CH
Okay, and the perinatologist…?
BH
A perinatologist takes care of mother and baby, so a perinatologist, that meant after the baby was born,
he would continue with that baby, but because of their specialty in neonatology, and particularly the
unborn child, they could really help in guiding what people, what a mother, really needed while she was
pregnant and was right there and could be available to take care of that baby once born.
CH
What is or was the Healthy Start program? What was that about?
BH
Oh, that was an infant mortality reduction program funded by the HRSA, the federal government, and it
was one of 12 sites across the country to look at developing standards of prenatal care that would result
in improved prenatal care for women and better pregnancy outcomes, so less infant deaths and
morbidity. So, that's the other thing we did and, you know, it cost us about-- Well, his insurance cost us a
half a million dollars alone, and that's because of what they call the “tail insurance”. So, a child could
sue you up until they were 21, so they had to have tail insurance. Most OB’s had to have tail insurance.
That's why a lot of people got out of OB practice and just went to gynecology because of the cost of
insurance. For the perinatologist, it was a huge, huge amount of money, but we were still happy that we
were able, had the funding to do that.
CH
For a peri…?
BH
Perinatologist.
CH
Perinatologist. What other outcomes did you find from the Healthy Start program? Was it really
beneficial? Were there positive outcomes from it?
7
afc2021009_014
BH
There’s a lot of things that go on now that started under the various Healthy Start projects. The main one
was hiring people from the community to work with their communities. And the mothers, we hired what
we called “resource mothers”, so they were out in the community helping folk. We also had what we
called-- Well, they weren't called “resource dads”. I don't really remember what we wound up calling
them. “Male outreach workers” is what we called them, and they worked with young fathers and all that.
So, I thought that was helpful because they could actually work with people. They worked with guys
who may have been on drugs, helped them get off and really tried to protect them, because sometimes,
once they got people kind of settled and into a job, then those people selling drugs tried to get-- Every
payday, you know, they would be after them and they could kind of surround them and protect them
from that. So, that whole outreach effort in the use of people from the community to support health
efforts, I think, was determined. We had a moms van that drove women to care, but we also had our big
moms vehicle where we had nurse practitioners or nurse midwives who would staff it and if someone
thought they were pregnant, they could come on and be tested and get an initial exam and then referred
for ongoing care. So, I think there were a lot of things that now go on, like the group care, where they
bring pregnant women in together for a visit to talk and to share, you know, and so more that group kind
of prenatal care and support developed out of that long-term.
CH
There's a lot of empowerment, and the Healthy Start program looked at the whole family unit.
BH
Yes.
CH
So that the whole family unit would be healthy, you know, that involved the father and the mother and
the baby, when the baby came. Sounds like a wonderful program. I just want to go back to you being the
Chair of the D.C. Board of Nurses. What does the Chair of the Board of Nursing do?
BH 19:18
Well, the Chair is the person that convenes the meetings of the board, which is usually monthly, and at
those meetings, you primarily consider and approve new licenses, not the ongoing one, but new
licensees. The process is probably not as bad now as it used to be, because we had a lot of problems with
nurses trained in other countries, so those applications had to almost be individually done by the Board
of Nursing and reviewed, because the general staff, they didn't meet the general guidelines for
acceptance as a registered and then finally a licensed practical nurse. We also created, like, a diversion
or treatment program for nurses who were on drugs, where they could go into a treatment program in
lieu of having their license taken totally. So, basically, it's convening the meeting and taking care of the
business of the board and those things that kind of were outside the norm, because there was a staff there
who would, you know, process applications, and as long as people met guidelines, then we would
probably only get a list that says, “These are the people we process,” blah, blah, blah, but we still have
to approve that list.
CH
Okay, so it's not just you pass the licensure exam and boom! I'm talking about the national licensure
exam, your jurisdiction, your state, still had to approve?
8
afc2021009_014
BH
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
CH
I didn't know that.
BH
You didn’t know?
CH
No.
BH
Oh, yeah.
CH
I'm learning some new stuff.
BH
You know, because even though it's not as different now, different states had different requirements, you
know. When I started with the Board of Nursing, remember, you had to have, what was it? 350 and all
the [inaudible 22:11], yeah. After, of course, when it switched to the NCLEX and all that, you got that
general pass or fail, but initially, you had to take all those different parts. The Board of Nursing also was
responsible for doing the exams. That's when it was called the State Board Exam. Each state, you could
go to the armory and people would sit and take the test and we would be there.
CH
I’ve learned something new today [laughs].
BH
Yeah, and, of course, you know, the big thing was the foreign grads, and that finally wound up in the
organization coming about in Philly that looked at reviewing transcripts of foreign grads, because you
would not know. Sometimes people came in and applied, their nursing school might have been closed.
You couldn't find records. Sometimes, you really didn't know if they were really trained as an RN or an
LPN or not because of differences. I remember one case we had. It was an African couple. They broke
up and the husband reported that she never went to an RN [both laugh], that it was really a school for
LPN’s.
CH
Oh, and she was already practicing as a registered nurse. Well, what happened in that situation?
BH
We snatched her license.
CH
Was she then able to get an LPN license?
9
afc2021009_014
BH
No.
CH
No, because she was not honorable and had no integrity. My goodness, my goodness.
BH
So, you know, there were all kinds of little--
CH
Oh my. That was really something. That was terrible. That must have just really destroyed her.
BH
Yes, he did.
CH
Oh my. You also participated with the District of Columbia's Nurses Association and the American
Nurse Association on their political action committees. What was the function of the political action
committee?
BH 24:51
Okay, well, I’ll start with the DCNA, and I don't know if I told you I was one of the former presidents of
DCNA. At the time, DCNA was not a union. Now, DCNA is a union. So, it was the state arm of the
American Nurses Association, and because we were in D.C., regarding the political action, we became
one of the first states that had, like, a political action committee and we did a lot of testifying on the Hill
and at the City Council on various legislations.
CH
The hill is Capitol Hill?
BH
Capital Hill.
CH
Was that in front of the Senate?
BH
Senate or the House. It could be either side. ANA was still in Kansas City. I don't know if you remember
it being in Kansas City. It was in Kansas City. So therefore, people in DCNA got used a lot to go on
Capitol Hill to testify.
CH
To lobby.
10
afc2021009_014
BH
To lobby for various legislation, because we were right here and they didn't have to pay us. They might
pay somebody from another state if their congressman or senator was on that committee, they might
bring someone, but it was like people from DC and they were readily available to go up on the Hill
when ANA needed someone to go. And, of course, as the City Council, we would go as well.
CH
What type of political actions that you can remember you all went to lobby the City Council, the Senate
or Congress about?
BH
Well, with DC, it really related primarily to advanced practice nursing. That's when all the issues were
coming up regarding that, so there was a lot related to the nurse, the expanded functions of the nurse. It
took longer because then they did this whole review of all the health occupations, etcetera, so we had to
do a lot of fighting because, of course, the physicians wanted the nurse practitioners to come under the
Medical Board, so there was all that kind of--
CH
[Inaudible 27:49] work with the Nurse Practice Act. So, what type of political actions did you--
BH
On the Hill?
CH
On the Hill.
BH
Various bills, anything that had to do with health and expanding healthcare. What should Medicaid or
Medicare cover? What kind of services should be covered as they were looking at expanding services
either for Medicaid or Medicare? Some of it may have done with nursing research. What, you know,
funding the NIH, the nursing research part. NINR, you know, we did a lot around that. What else was
there? What did they call that? I'm trying to think of the correct terminology, but, you know, most of the
medical schools got most of the NIH funding and it was kind of, like, how do you expand it to go to
other groups that are not academic medical centers? How can you improve care across the nation when
it's really all the power and the money are going to academic medical centers? So, some place like D.C.
General wasn't getting money because it wasn’t a academic medical center. Yes, students came from
academic medical centers there, but they weren't getting the funding that academic medical centers like
G.W. or Georgetown, and even to some extent, Howard, would get monies for research and, you know,
taking care of the medical students. You know, when you're a resident, that was funded through federal
funds, you know, so we kind of underwrote medical education and we kind of talked about how do you
underwrite nursing education and other health occupations and not just the physicians? So, it was a
variety of things.
CH
Did anything come out of that? Was nursing research funded?
11
afc2021009_014
BH
Yeah, I guess. Nursing has a big role in the NIH. I think it became more interdisciplinary at NIH and
other places, and the funding was available for more health occupations than had been in the past. Now,
some of it was a process, you know. You just had to start the issues and as the years have gone on, things
have changed.
CH
You've worked with the World Justice Forum. What is that?
BH 31:30
Okay, the World Justice Forum is an organization formed by lawyers but it's a global organization. But, I
got involved as a health person, because a lot of the disparities in countries, including this country, are
health-related and therefore, they wanted health people involved in looking at some of the health
injustices and inequities in various countries. So, I was involved with the initial formation of the health
group that took in people from across the globe. It was primarily physicians. I think I was the only nurse,
but it was primarily physicians when it started. I was the only nurse. Social workers. In some countries,
people, they may have been social workers, etcetera, but primarily, it was physicians.
CH
What was the goal of the World Justice Forum?
BH
Oh, the World Justice Forum has this index that they develop that looks at justice in various categories
of countries and kind of tells you where people are in terms of justice, inequity in that country and where
they fall short. So, that was primarily the guide, was to address some of what we have happening now. I
mean, to combat authoritarianism, to look at the rule of law in fairness for people, not in just the justice
system, but the health and other things that kind of feed into the system and people's general wellbeing.
So, basically, it was to help people globally, a global coming together of people concerned about justice,
whether it was environmental justice, justice, or looking at the rule of law.
CH
What was the main focus, then, on the health disparities and inequities?
BH
It varied by country, but most of it probably fell more into access to care, just, you know, how people
just did not have the kind of access they needed to quality care.
CH
Then, what was the action from that when they found out?
BH
Well, it depended upon the country, you know. Finally, they got funding where groups could really get
funding to work on efforts in their individual countries to try to make changes in what was going on and
trying to improve access or, you know, get more physicians or whoever, social workers, involved,
changing laws in their particular country, laws or policies in their country. So, it varied based on the
country in what the problems were.
12
afc2021009_014
CH
This was a grassroots effort sort of. Yes? No?
BH
Grassroots. Yes, in-country it was more grassroots but remember, it was started by the National Bar
Association in the U.S. but it branched out globally to help other countries and their legal systems, and
even did some work with things like war-related crimes and all that.
CH
Now, this was looking at the laws involved with that?
BH
Yes, and also trying to get people who may have-- I mean, saying, in Africa, what was that with the
Tutsis and all that? Bringing people to justice through that global group in Amsterdam, you know, so,
you know, people would be charged with war crimes, etcetera, and convicted.
CH
Did they have that type of jurisdictional type of authority? Would they consider health disparity a crime?
BH
No, that wouldn't be a crime, but it would be an access issue and they would fund projects to try to
address that.
CH
‘Cause it seems like it's a crime to me, anyway [chuckles].
BH
Yeah, I mean, but it’s not.
CH
Not as such. I understand that.
BH
When I'm talking about the war crime, I'm talking about, you know, like, killing off people.
CH
Atrocities.
BH
Atrocities, like what's happening in Ukraine.
CH
Yeah, that is a travesty. Chi Eta Phi has a couple of journals that are published. I know one of them is
JOCEPS. What's the name of the other one? Is that the Chi Line?
13
afc2021009_014
BH 38:07
Yeah, Chi Line. And what was the other one? What's the one that comes out? JOCEPS and…
CH
Glowing Lamp. Glowing Lamp. Look, I looked at the light in your eyes and saw Glowing Lamp. So,
those are the two. Not the Chi Line, but the two journals are Glowing Lamp and JOCEPS, and you were
the editor-in-chief of the JOCEPS.
BH
Correct.
CH
What is that journal about?
BH
Well, that is a professional journal, like the American Journal of Nursing or, you know, the NLN journal,
where we attempt to get nurses, Chi nurses, to publish their research or their practice activities. It's a
peer-reviewed journal where we attempt to get Chi nurses, it could be other nurses, to publish their
efforts at improving healthcare.
CH
The peer review is so that there are quality articles that are submitted?
BH
Yes, yes. So, we have reviewers, so when a article would come in, it wasn't just me that looked at the
article. I sent it to people, the peer reviewers or people in that field, to make sure it was kind of accurate
information and that they were using the most up-to-date information in that particular field.
CH
So, what is the criteria for submitting an article to JOCEPS?
BH
There is no criteria other than if you have some practice or research information to report, you can
submit your article and it will be peer reviewed and decided whether it will or will not be published. Or
you may have to-- it may say, “Well, this is a good idea, but you have to go back and rewrite it,” or
whatever.
CH
Needs some tweaking. Did you all offer any, like, tutorial help when you would send back the articles?
BH
Oh, yeah. There would be advice on what you needed to do to get up to snuff and get your article
approved.
CH
What was the editor-in-chief’s, like, main duties?
14
afc2021009_014
BH
The main duties was trying to get it reviewed then get it back and work with the publishers to get it
done. At that time, I did a lot of training at regional meetings related to how to write, you know, for
JOCEPS.
CH
And make your submissions to it. How often does the JOCEPS come out to the members?
BH
Lately, and even during my time, it was probably once a year, because there weren't enough articles to
go to publication, like, every month or anything like that. So, you would kind of wait until you had
enough articles to--
CH
How many articles would you consider to be the number to print?
BH
At least five or six. Yeah.
CH
Did you all accept articles from our undergraduate members or just from the graduate members?
BH
Primarily it was graduate. I mean, at least when I was there, we weren't making a push for undergrads.
CH
You are involved with the National Black Nurse Association. Can you tell us something about the
National Black Nurse Association?
BH
I mean, with National Black Nurses, of course, I was a general member. Never been an officer in Black
Nurses but did do a lot of their training. They had a training program, like a leadership training program,
so I would do some of that training for National Black Nurses Association. I'm currently one of their
mentors, so taking on someone that wants to be a leader and working with them. So, that's been my
involvement with Black Nurses Association. Never tried to do any running for office and stuff.
CH
But you still use in your nurse educator role and as a leader in nursing, because certainly you are a
leader.
BH
I used to do a lot of presentations for them. Almost annually, they would ask me to present something
for them.
CH
What type of church activities are you involved in?
15
afc2021009_014
BH 44:06
Well, most recently, I’m on that COVID committee, working with all those policies.
CH
Is that because you're a nurse?
BH
Yes. I was one of the only health people on there, I think. Also, even though that stuff, we have to start
that again, I had, like, a little health column in our-- every month, regarding some particular condition
that negatively impact the Black community, since we are primarily Black.
CH
So, is that a newsletter?
BH
It was part of our overall bulletin, so it wasn’t a separate newsletter. It would be in the church bulletin
for whatever Sunday it was printed, you know. So, updates about a particular condition, high blood
pressure, whatever, depending upon the month of the year, and what you could do to take care of
yourself, you know, your self-care, and provide a few resources.
CH
Now, your church gives out printed bulletins on Sundays or is it electronic or both?
BH
They do both.
CH
What is the name of your church?
BH
Shiloh Baptist.
CH
In?
BH
Washington, D.C. Shiloh Baptist Church. So, you know, during the pandemic, that kind of went by the
wayside, ‘cause a lot of effort was being put into the COVID and also beefing up online programs
because people were not able to get out. So, every Friday, they would have some kind of program,
various programs, whether it was discussing COVID and its implications, mental health, you know, or
just having some activity like singers.
CH
Now, was that virtual?
16
afc2021009_014
BH
Yeah, it was virtual.
CH
Are you all still doing that?
BH
The virtual?
CH
Yeah.
BH
Not as frequently as we used to do it when everybody was--
CH
So, you mentioned writing policy during COVID. That was policy for the church members and
guidelines for the church?
BH
Yeah, yeah.
CH
So, what kind of policies did you all enact?
BH
Oh, well now, I mean, we have regular guidelines. During COVID, it was more advising people and
updating them about COVID, so educating them about COVID and then, eventually, getting vaccines
and all that. The policies we have now, no one can enter our church, even to this day, that has not been
vaccinated.
CH
Really?
BH
Yeah. If you're not vaccinated, you cannot, and we still mask.
CH
Do you all take temperatures and have a questionnaire?
BH
Yeah, we just-- temperatures.
CH
Okay, not the questionnaire?
17
afc2021009_014
BH
Not a full questionnaire.
CH
They call that the tracing. Not the tracing.
BH
No. Well, you fill out the form and it will have your temperature, whether you've been vaccinated, do
you have a record, proof of your vaccination.
CH
You have to show that?
BH
If you’re a member of Shiloh, you only have to show it once. The people that are on the desk kind of
know which people--
CH
Can you show a photo of it or it has to be a card?
BH
Oh yeah, you can show a photo of it.
CH
I don’t know where my card is [laughs].
BH
No, you can show a photo of it, and it asked for your email address and your phone number.
CH
So, it’s a form of tracing.
BH
Yeah, they still do a form a tracing, but it's not-- I went to the funeral the other day, that big old form,
you know. Oh lord!
CH
We had to sit down and fill out the whole questionnaire, but they didn't ask if-- Did they ask you if you
were vaccinated? I can’t remember.
BH
I don't remember. They didn't ask for your vaccination things.
CH
No, they didn’t. So, at your church, will they let you in if you had, like, the first two shots and you don't
have the boosters or you have to have the boosters too?
18
afc2021009_014
BH
You have to be fully vaccinated.
CH
Okay. Alright, okay. At your church--
BH
I mean, at the time when there was only two then yes, you could get in [chuckles].
CH
At your church, do they have, like, a health ministry and such?
BH
They used to but not formally anymore, and that's why I was trying to do kinda like that newsletter, and
then one of the doctors that is in one of the choirs joined in with me, you know, once I started it, but they
don't have a real formal health committee anymore.
CH
You have such a wonderfully vibrant and illustrious nursing career. Anything else you can think of?
BH 50:33
No. I guess I told you all the stuff with the World Federation and how I was able, you know, I was kind
of blessed to be able to visit different countries and look at their health systems and work with their
public health people and was responsible for two big conferences. They only had a conference every, I
guess it was, three years, so the one in Rio and the one in Turkey.
CH
Now, this was with the World Federation--
BH
Of Public Health Associations.
CH
Are you still a part of that?
BH
No, no, no. There were politics, because they wanted it to be based in Switzerland. They wanted it in
Europe, because most of the organizations, of course, were--
CH
European?
BH
Well, yeah, European. There were African countries, but it kind of started in Switzerland, but the
American Public Health Association kind of supported it and helped it grow, and they wanted to be
based in Geneva. Some of the people had problems with a Black person and a Black nurse being in
19
afc2021009_014
charge, because the doctors thought they should be in charge. And, you know, I just learned that
wherever you go, that there’s something in a male-dominated world, because a lot of European countries
have more female physicians than you would believe, but they treat their nurses [inaudible 52:53], I
think.
CH
So, more sexism than racism or it’s both?
BH
It’s both.
CH
It’s both. ‘Cause I was gonna ask you when you were talking about the committee you were a part of
where it was mostly physicians and you were the only nurse if you felt any bias?
BH
No, not at the World Justice Forum, no. I did not, because most of those were folk who were committed
to justice, and so they kind of understood.
CH
The multidiscipline.
BH
Yeah, but they also understood all the implications, what makes inequity, including racial, and so those
were people who had already bought into fighting for justice at whatever level.
CH
So, that was the thing. They kept the main thing the main thing.
BH
Yes. So, no. And also, I was an American.
CH
Now, this was with the World Federation?
BH
Yeah.
CH
Where you found that prejudice because you're a Black female and American.
BH
Oh yes.
CH
A lot of indifference because of that. How did it make you feel?
20
afc2021009_014
BH
At times, it bothered me. For the most part, I just ignored them, you know. I just ignored it.
CH
And stayed your grand educated self [laughs].
BH
Yeah. So, most of the times, it's just that I have not continued to be active. It wasn’t everybody. It was
just a few people, but it was primarily-- I don't want to go on record but, you know, believe it or not, the
Germans are still pretty--
CH
German.
BH
Pretty German, yeah, you know, so it came more from them. The Asian people, not as much.
CH
What about the Africans?
BH
Oh, no, no, the Africans, but, you know, they have their own thing. They’re still male-dominated, so a
lot of it was--
CH
Sexism.
BH
The male domination.
CH
So, a lot of sexism?
BH
Yes.
CH
When you were involved in these international organizations.
BH
Yeah, because men are at the top of the heap, but, you know, but I got to go to China several times.
CH
They still valued what you brought to the table.
21
afc2021009_014
BH
Yes.
CH
But they did not want you to [inaudible 56:13].
BH
I would not say “they”. It was more a small group of people.
CH
That had major influence in the organization.
BH
Yeah.
CH
Yeah, so I'm calling them “they”. They ruled the roost.
BH
Yeah, and so, you know, they wanted it a certain way. Also, I was not, I mean, I will say what I believe,
so it wasn't like they could manipulate me, so I guess if I had played the game and all that, I would have
been fine.
CH
If you were a brown-noser.
BH
Yeah, but since I don't do that--
CH
Right. You have your integrity, you have your standards and you say, “Here I am and I know I'm well
qualified.”
BH
So, I do think I've had experiences that other people would not have, you know. Every year when I was
with the Federation, I was in Switzerland for at least three weeks, three weeks to a month, and went to
the World Health Conferences and all those various activities that went on there. So, I’ve had
experiences and opportunities that others do not generally have.
CH
That is just so amazingly wonderful.
BH
So, you know, there were other things I wanted to do but when it was time to go, it was time.
22
afc2021009_014
CH
You made your contribution. You made an inroad, so that when they see somebody else looking like
you, they will maybe take a double take and say, “This person--”
BH
Well, you know, not really. Not for people or justice. I just remember a lot of other lawyers from the
African countries and others of those countries, like, worked at The Hague, so they did a lot of that war
crime stuff. I can remember meeting a lady. She was there with her husband. She was of Chinese
descent, but she was a white and she was kind of hanging around with me because we were the--
CH
The females.
BH
The two American women there. But she got upset, ‘cause she said, “Do people ask you if you're
African?” and I said, “No, they don't.” She said, “They keep on asking me where I come from in China”
[both laugh]. She said, “I’m born and raised in the US, so what are they talking about?” That offended
her. I said, “No, they really don't. I haven't had anybody ask me if I was African, but,” I said, “I think
there's a difference between Americans and Africans. They kind of-- "
CH
Can see.
BH
Not that I'm not saying I'm not of African descent, it's just…
CH
Right. Correct, correct. Anything else you want to share with us?
BH
No. That's all I can think of at this point.
CH
I thank you so much, Dr. Hatcher. What a wonderful, wonderful career you've had and continue to have,
because you have your own business. Is that right? You’re consulting?
BH
Mmhmm.
CH
What’s the name of your business?
BH 1:00:28
Hatcher-DuBois-Odrick Group.
23
afc2021009_014
CH
What do you all do?
BH
I just do various consulting work, maternal and child health, general public health for-- When I first
started it, I used to do a lot of training in Africa for public health associations but since COVID, haven't
done international stuff. So, I do some work. There's about three or four women I know with their own
little companies and as we apply for various grants, we help each other out on those grants.
CH
On those projects. So, your company primarily is focused on international?
BH
No, we do national, local, yeah. We did a most recent one, not the one we're working on now. The one
that we completed looked at maternal and child health services at John Hopkins up here. What's the
hospital called that's now part of Johns Hopkins?
CH
It used to be P.G.
BH
No, not P.G. No, over in Northwest. It was primarily frequented by white folk, up on Western Avenue,
way up.
CH
Oh, Sibley.
BH
Sibley. So, we did a project looking at their MCH services for Sibley, John Hopkins.
CH
So, your focus is primarily maternal child health?
BH
No, even though we prefer, but no, it’s not. The one we're working on now is with the American
Academy of Dermatologists doing some work with them on equity, so we do more equity stuff.
CH
Well, let's talk about equity. What are you finding in healthcare as a whole, as far as equity goes?
BH
What generally, this is just my impression, it’s that, particularly with the Trump stuff and all this stuff
going on about CRT, people are confusing equity with all these other things, the books people
publishing, all this, and there's, to me, this kind of negativity about looking at structural inequities,
because no one thinks they're racist or that they should have to pay for what someone did in the past, and
so equity is falling under all this cultural nonsense that Donald Trump hooped up, and it’s not, to me,
24
afc2021009_014
being taken as seriously as it could across the broad spectrum. Nursing does it. There's some
organizations and groups that are fine, but from the broad health perspective, I don't think people are
internalizing it and understanding it like they should.
CH
Then, what is equity?
BH
To them?
CH
In healthcare. In your opinion, what is equity considered?
BH
What is equity considered? People think it’s already equitable.
CH
That everybody's getting equal treatment?
BH
Yeah.
CH
In healthcare, when it’s not true.
BH
When it's not true.
CH
It is not true.
BH
I mean, take the whole abortion issue. Whether you’re reportedly pro-life or for abortion, look at the
whole issue. How are you pro-life? I call them pro-fetus. How are you pro-life when after the child is
born, you don't care what happens to it?
CH
That’s right.
BH
You’re not pro-life.
CH
Right.
25
afc2021009_014
BH
‘Cause if you were pro-life, then you would be talking about, “Okay, if people have babies out of
wedlock, we're gonna make sure that child can be taken care of appropriately.” We know they don't want
that. If you are pro-life, how do you snatch a baby off the breast of a Black or Brown mama trying to
cross the border and you separate them and made no way for them to get back together? If you pro-life,
you couldn't snatch a breastfeeding baby from its mother.
CH
Mmhmm. That's true.
BH
So, don't talk to me about pro-life. You are pro-fetus, but that's only because you're trying to control
people, and as far as I'm concerned, you're using Christianity-- To me, you’re a heretic, because there's
nothing in the Bible that would have you treat people in that way. If God gives us free will and I can ask
God to forgive my sins, who are you? God didn’t make you the Taliban to control everybody's body.
And if I sin, I know [inaudible 1:07:29] has to, you know, pay for the sins that I have done. That's my
feeling. I mean, maybe it’s--
CH
I really agree with you. If you are talking about pro-life, you have to take in the totality--
BH
The totality. That's right.
CH
Of what is life.
BH
And so, [inaudible 1:07:49].
CH
And what is quality of life, because you need to have quality of life.
BH
So, how is it quality, how is it pro-life that a 10 year old is raped and you think she should have the
baby? How is that pro-life? I’ve been a nurse and I went through that with a nine year old who probably
just started her period. Her mother was a junkie and was selling her to men to get drunk and she comes
up pregnant. So yeah, by the time anybody knows, number one: it was too far along to do anything but
grandma has to take that. How do you want a child that’s only-- your mama is only nine years older than
you? Oh, come on! Your mom was only 10 years old and you-- Come on. To me, that is craziness. So
yes, I'm sure the grandmother probably wound up raising that child but what kind of quality was that for
the 10 year old or the baby?
CH
Exactly.
26
afc2021009_014
BH
And then you don't want the social services, you know. “They outta work. Why are these people-- Why
are we giving them--,” then you're not pro-life, because then you would want to help to make a better
life for the both of ‘em and they don't wanna do that. And the states with the worst health outcome are
the ones that don't want people to have abortion, but they ain’t gonna--
CH
They’re pro-life. ‘Cause they have high poverty rates.
BH
Yeah. So, if you were pro-life, maybe people wouldn't be getting pregnant like that, ‘cause maybe they
would have access to birth control if they weren't ready. I mean, there's a whole thing of, “There’s birth
control available so why are you getting an abortion?” you know, but maybe people can’t afford it.
CH
So, that really is a good example of inequality in healthcare and people not wanting to take
responsibility.
BH
Responsibility for it. No, they don't want their money to go for that. “Why should I, you know, pay more
welfare or support services?” Well then, you don't want great quality of life.
CH
You don't want quality of life. Well, thank you again. We could go on and on and on with this subject,
but I thank you so very much for your valued contributions to nursing and to Chi Eta Phi Sorority
Incorporated.
BH
Thank you.
CH
You have a good evening.
BH
You as well.
CH
Thank you.
