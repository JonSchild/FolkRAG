Patrick Wellington, Wellington Hair Spa.  Chelsea, NY 
August 10, 2012 at 9:00am 
 
We (me and my assistant) arrived at the Wellington Hair Spa at 9am on Friday, 
August 10th. Wellington Hair Spa is located in a large building on a busy street 
in the Chelsea district in Manhattan. We took the elevator to the salon and 
Patrick, the owner, was unlocking the door as we arrived. He scheduled the 
interview two hours before the salon was open for business so it was just the 
three of us. The salon was nicely designed with a large painting and red walls. 
 
We sat in the front of the salon and did the interview, which lasted 
approximately an hour. Patrick was relaxed and very easy to talk to. After the 
interview I took portrait shots of Patrick and photographed the rest of the salon. 
Patrick didn’t have a model set up for me to photograph, but he had a client 
scheduled that afternoon. After the interview Patrick “tweeted” that I had come 
to interview him and he showed me a couple of Twitter tips. While waiting for 
his client to come in my assistant and I went across the street and bought 
expensive pastries and coffee. 
 
We came back about an hour later and met Patrick’s client, Victoria Dillard. She 
was an actress and had appeared on the television series — Spin City, Law & 
Order and Seinfeld. Thankfully, she agreed to be photographed while Patrick did 
her hair. It was the first hair model I’ve photographed with such short hair. I was 
struck by the incredible precision required and time it took to shape the hairstyle. 
While Patrick was doing Victoria’s hair, two hairstylists came in the shop and 
started doing their clients hair. At that point there were about eight people in the 
salon. We left around 2pm.
