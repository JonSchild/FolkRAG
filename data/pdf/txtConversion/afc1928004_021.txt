'When I 
used to work upon the Levee, 
Many happy darkies there you see, 
Cotton coining in so very heavy, 
Oh I 
jolly, there was lots of work for me. 
Black man hauling in the cargo, 
Sun am very hot upon the head, 
When he done he dance a 
jolly jargo, 
Rum turn on the banjo, and then to bed. 
Cnowus—To my oakum, to my chokum; 
Oh, Pompey, can't you pick a 
peck of 
oakum? 
Au ! ah ! au ! golly, ain't the levee nigger 
free! 
SoLo—Working on the cotton boat, ten shilling a-
day, 
Johnny, can't you pick upon the banjo ? 
CHORUS — Oh 
me, oh my, mamma, mamma, mam-
ma, why don't hear the baby cry? 
Oh me, oh my; all, mamma, mamma, 
mamma, don't you hear the baby cry? 
When I 
used to work off in the river, 
Satin wood and water all the day, 
Chilly wind he come and make me shiver, 
0 
glad this child he was to get away. 
White man he gave me silver dollar 
Every day I 
work upon the dock, 
Then I 
get some whisky and I 
holler, 
Blom'e, blom'e, Caterrego rock. 
CHORUS—To 
my oakum, &c. 
SOLO—Working on the cotton boat, & c. 
Cuortus—Oh me, oh my, & c. 
This child is fond of frigh'd 'tatoe, 
Catfish and coffee, oh, it's nice, 
It make him feel just like an alligator 
When him just about to catch a 
mice. 
When the bell he rings I 
go to dinner, 
Den I 
goes and sees my Dinah dear, 
I'll marry her as sure as I'm a 
sinner, 
And love her all the days that's in the year.

CHORUS— Oh me, oh my, &c. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
'Twas down at Parson Jones's house, 
The gals they had a 
quiltin', 
Just for to show their handsome looks, 
And have a 
little jiltin' ; 
There was Deacon Parsons' darter Sal, 
'Squire Wheeler's darter Mary, 
And Corporal Carter's youngest gal, 
That looked just like a 
fairy. 
CHORUS—Yankee lasses are the universal earth 
bewitching, 
They're good and true, and han'some 
too, in parlor and in kitchen. 
There was Johnny White and Pheby Brown, 
And Parson's darter Betty, 
Jane Ann Pinkroot and Prudence Short, 
And Captain Downing's Hetty. 
But if there was a 
handsome gal 
To make a 
feller's heart right, 
I 
guess it was, by all accounts, 
Miss Caroliner Cartwright. 
CHORUS—Yankee lasses, & c. 
Wal, while we was a 
whirlin' plate 
And playin' hunt the slipper, 
Jerusha Parsons went to get 
Some cider in a 
pitcher; 
But just as she had left the room 
And got into the entry, 
She gave a 
scream and stood stock still, 
. Just like a 
frozen sentry. 
CHORUS—Yankee lasses, &c. 
We all run out, and there, I 
swow, 
Both huggin' like creation, 
Miss Cartwright and Sammy Jones, 
A 
kissing like tarnation. 
Oh, such a 
laugh as we set up— 
You never heard a 
finer— 
Says I, I 
reckon kissin's cheap, 
Don't you, Miss Caroliner? 
Csonus—Yankee lasses, &c.

BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
I 
wish you'd seen Miss Cartwright blush, 
Just like as if she'd painted— 
She said she'd had the cholic, 
And into Sam's arms had fainted. 
And now, young gals, I'd say to you, 
Whenever you go to a 
frolic, 
Don't let your fellers kiss and hug 
Unless you've got the cholie. 
CHORUS—Yankee lasses, & c. 
Polly Perkins of Abington Green. 
Sung by BILLY M ORRIS. Written and composed by HARRY 
CLIFTON. 
I'm a 
broken-hearted milkman, in grief I'm arrayed, 
Through keeping of the company of a 
young serv-
ant maid, 
Who lived on board wages, the house to keep clean, 
In a 
gentleman's famly, near Abington Green. 
CHORUS—Oh, she was as beautiful as a 
butterfly, 
and as proud as a 
queen, 
Was ' pretty little Polly Perkins of Ab-
ington Green. 
Her eyes were as black as the pips of a 
pear, 
No rose in the garden with her cheeks could com-
pare, 
Her hair hung in " ringerlets" so beautiful and long, 
I 
thought that she loved me, but found I 
was wrong. 
CHORUS—Ohl, she was as beautiful, & c. 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
When I'd rattle in a 
morning and cry " milk be-
low," 
At the sound of my milk-cans her face she would 
show, 
With a 
smile upon her countenance and a 
laugh in 
her eye, 
If I 
thought she'd have loved me I'd. have laid 
down to die, • 
Cnonus—For she was as beautiful, & c. 
When I 
asked her to marry me she said " Oh, 
what stuff!" 
And told me to " drop it, for she'd had quite enough 
Of my nonsense." At the same time I'd been very 
kind, 
But to marry a 
milkman she didn't feel inclined. 
CHORUS—Oh, she was as beautiful, &c. 
" 
Oh, the man that has me must have silver and 
gold, 
A chariot to ride in, and be handsome and bold; 
His hair must be curly as any watch-spring, 
And his whiskers as big as a 
brush for clothing." 
CHORUS—Oh, she was as beautiful, & c. 
The words that she uttered went straight through 
my heart, 
I 
sobbed, I 
sighed, and straight did depart 
With a 
tear on my eyelid as big as a 
bean, 
Bidding good-bye to Polly and Abington Green. 
CUORUS—Ah, she was as b.eautiful, &c. 
8 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS . 
In six months she married— this hard-hearted girl, 
But it was not a " Wicount," and it was not a 
" 
Nearl," 
It was not a" Baronite," but a 
shade or two " 
WUS," 
'Twas a 
bow-legged Conductor of a 
twopenny ' bus. 
CHORUS— In 
spite of all she was as beautiful, &c. 
The Gal in Blue. 
Sung by B ILLY M ORRIS. 
I 
met a 
pretty yaller gal, her nathe I 
do not know, 
I 
meet her every evening, no matter where I 
go; 
She swings de fancy handkerchief that sparkles 
like de dew, 
You'd know her if you see her—she's always 
dressed in blue. 
CHORUS—She'11 set dis darkey crazy, I 
don't know 
what to do 
If I 
can't get dat pretty gal dat I 
saw dressed in 
blue. 
She'll set dis darkey crazy, I 
don't know what to do 
If I 
can't get dat pretty gal dat I 
saw dressed in

I 
met her in de street one day, she looked at me 
so sly 
Dat when my horses see her dey boff began to shy; 
Dey bite, dey reared, dey jump, dey pitch, an' 
down de street dey flow, 
And passed dat pretty gal dat I 
saw dressed in blue. 
CHORUS— She'll set di's darkey, 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
Oh, if I 
could but hear her name, I 
hope it won't 
be long, 
I'd follow up de telemgraph de verses ob dis song; 
And if I 
cannot find her my heart will break in two, 
Den I 
would sigh and bid good bye to de pretty 
gal in blue. 
CHORUS—She'll set dis darkey, & c. 
Down at de Barbecue.

Now hurry up de work, boys, while de day is light, 
Golly, we'll hab lots of fun on the farm to-night; 
De darkies all will merry be to strike de heel and

An' kiss de lubly colored gal down at de Barbecue. 
CHoRns—Hurrah, boys; hurrah, boys; dance wid 
all your might; 
Golly, we'll hab lots of fun at de barbecue to-night. 
Clem Johnson bring de banjo, I'll fetch along de

De barn-floor has been cleared up, now we can

Dat darkey ober dere will turn de double-action

CHORUS—Hurrah, boys, &c.

F

On Boston Common, Sunday nights; 
Such crowds of people, I

From five to ten are walking there, 
All other walks are deserted quite, 
For Boston Common, Sunday night. 
CHORUS—If 
you doubt the truth of what I 
say, 
And wish to prove it any way, 
Oh, go yourself and take a 
sight 
On Boston Common, Sunday night. 
You'll see old bachelors strutting away, 
Laughing and chatting with maidens gay, 
Likewise old maids there you'll find, 
With little pet dogs close behind; 
Patrick and Bridget will be there, 
Courting in the evening air, 
And rambling round with great delight, 
On Boston Common, Sunday night.

Young widows, tired of single life, 
Each wishing to again become a 
wife, 
Are trying with rrany a 
cunning leer 
To catch a 
swellish husband dear ; 
And smart young fellows push along, 
Singing " John Brown," or some such song, 
With sweethearts under their arms so tight, 
On Boston Common, Sunday night. 
CHORUS—If 
you doubt the truth, & c. 
There loving couples each other meet, 
Dressed in their Sunday clothes so neat, 
Calling each other " dears" and " loves," 
Billing and cooing like turtle doves; 
And under the shadows of the trees 
Oh how they do each other squeeze,— 
If trees could speak, tell tales they might, 
Of Boston Common, Sunday night. 
CHORUS—If 
you doubt the truth, & c. 
Isabella and her Gingham 'Umbrella. 
Sung by BILLY Monnis. 
Written and composed by HARRY 
CLIFTON. 
When you bear my ditty my woes you will pity, 
I'm engaged in the City from ten till three; 
But I've been betrayed by a 
fascinating maid, 
Who was boss of a 
sewing machine, do you see? 
Her eyes were as black as the pips of a 
pear, 
No rose in the garden with her lips could compare,

She'd a 
gingham umbrella, her name was Isabella, 
And her father kept a 
barber's shop in South Boston. 
On a 
Monday afternoon, in the latter part of June, 
From the Parker House I 
started for a sail to 
Chelsea ; 
And as. we drew near to Chelsea Ferry pier, 
A 
lovely lady I 
chanced to see : 
in her hand a 
nosegay, 'twas a 
bundle of stocks, 
A brown paper parcel, and a 
blue bonnet-box, 
A gingham umbrella, and her name was Isabella 
And her father kept a 
barber's shop in South Boston. 
I 
rushed to the gangway and proff'rd my assistance; 
0 
the smile that she gave me as I 
handed her a 
seat; 
I 
sat down beside her — she offerd no resistance — 
We talk'd of the weather, the rain, and the heat:. 
I 
asked her, her parents, I 
asked her their trade, 
I 
asked her, her name— with a 
look half afraid ; 
She raised her umbrella, 
Said, " my name is Isabella, 
And my father keeps a 
barber's shop in South 
Boston." 
Before we parted she'd all my affection; 
I 
inquired, " Should I 
see her at some future day?" 
She simpered and smiled, and said, " she'd no objec-
tion :" 
As light as a 
fairy she tripped it away; 
So we were engaged in a 
regular way. 
My time passed as happy as the flowers in May, 
When I 
thought of Isabella, 
And her gingham umbrella, 
And her father's little barber's shop in South Boston.

I 
took her to see the Organ with a 
ticket of ad-
mission, 
I 
took her up to Parker's and gave her an oyster stew, 
I 
took her to the Museum to see the Exhibition, 
And then we rode out to Brighton, too. 
0 
the presents I 
made, and the letters I 
wrote, 
From the first time I 
met her on a 
ferry-boat: 
My darling Isabella, 
And her gingham umbrella, 
Whose father kept a 
barber's shop in South Boston. 
When you hear the sequel you'll say it has no equal 
In all the annals of woman's deceit; 
I 
went one night to meet my Isabel, 
But no Isabel was there to meet; 
I 
searched far and wide, till I 
happened to drop 
In at Lyceum Hall, at a 
fifty cent hop; 
Oh ! there was Isabella, 
With a 
ginger-whiskered fellow, 
Doing " double shuffles" up in South Boston. 
I 
staggered with surprise, then exclaimed, Isabella! 
"Do I 
look like a 
fool ? Do you take me for a 
flat ?" 
She coolly replied, " well, I 
rather think I 
do, 
And if you don't like it, you can take your hat." 
I 
rushed at my rival satisfaction to get, 
Butlound that my troubles had not ended yet— 
For up jumped Isabella, 
With her gingham umbrella, 
And she smashed my new hat over at South Boston. 
rushed from the sight of my faithless spinster, 
In the Back Bls. 
water repose to find;

But before I 
reached the toll-gate out on the Mill-
dam, 
My opinions altered, and I 
changed my mind, 
For folly must be paid for, and wisdom bought; 
There are fishes in the sea that have never been 
caught, 
So a 
fig for Isabella, 
And her gingham umbrella 
And her father's'little barber's shop in South Boston. 
The Dark Girl Dressed in Blue. 
Sung by BILLY Montt's. 
Written by Hinny CLIFTON. 
From a 
village, away in New Hampshire, 
To Boston here I 
came, 
To see the Exhibition, and 
All places of great fame: 
But what I 
suffer'd since I 
came 
I 
now will tell to you, 
How I 
lost my heart and senses, too, 
Through a 
dark girl dressed in blue. 
CHORUS—She was a 
fine girl, fol de riddle, I 
do, 
A charmer, fol de riddle eh. 
Twas on a 
Friday morning, 
The first day of August, 
When of that day I 
ever think, 
My heart feels ready to bust; 
I 
went in a 
six penny omnibus, 
To the Exhibition of 'sixty-two; 
On a 
seat by the right hand side of the door, 
Sat a 
dark girl dress'd in blue. 
Cuon-us—She was a 
fine girl, & c. 
When we arrived on Tremont road ) 
The lady look'd so strange, 
The conductor he said, your fare ma'am! 
Said she I 
have no change ; * 
I've nothing less than a 
five dollar note, 
Whatever shall I 
do? 
Said I, allow me to pay. Oh thank you sir ! 
Said the .dark girl dress'd in blue. 
CHORUS— She was a 
fine girl, & c. 
We chatted and talked as we onward walked 
About one thing or the other, 
She asked me too, oh was'nt it kind? 
If I 
had a 
father or mother. 
Oh yes, says I, and a 
grandmother too; 
But pray Miss what are you? 
Oh I'm chief engineer in a 
milliner's shop, 
Says the dark girl dress'd in blue. 
CHORUS—She was a 
fine girl, & e. 
We walk'd about for an hour or two, 
Through the buildin.-, 
near and far, 
Till we came to the grand refreshment room, 
I 
went straight up to the bar ; 
She slipp'd in my hand a 
five dollar note, 
I 
said what are you going to do; 
Oh don't think it strange, I 
must have change, 
Said the dark girl dress'd blue. 
CHonus—She was a 
fine girl, Sze. 
call'd a 
waiter, and handed him the note, 
And said, please change me that; 
The waiter bow'd and toucli'd his hair, 
For this waiter wore no hat ; 
In silver and gold five dollars he brought, 
I 
gave him coppers, a 
few, 
And the change of the note I 
then did hand 
To the dark girl dress'd in blue. 
, 
She thanked me and said " I 
rhust away ; 
Farewell till we meet again, 
For I've to go to Pimlico 
To catch the Brighton train." 
She quickly glided from my sight, 
And soon was lost to view; 
I 
turned to leave, when by my side 
Stood a 
tall man dressed in blue. 
This tall man said " Excuse me, sir, 
I'm one of the X Division ; 
That note was bad, my duty is 
To take you on suspicion." 
Said I, " For a 
lady I 
obtained the change." 
He said, " Are you telling me true? 
Where's she live ? What's her name?" Says I, " I 
don't know ; 
She was a 
dark girl dressed in blue." 
My story they believed; they thought I'd been de-
ceived, 
But they said I 
must hand back the cash; 
I 
thought ' twas a 
sin as I 
gave them the tin, 
And away went five dollars smash. 
So all young men take my advice, 
Be careful what you do 
When you make the acquaintance of ladies strange, 
Especially a " dark girl dressed in blue." 
The Happy Little Man. 
Sung by BILLY M ORRIS. 
Words by C. W ITT. 
Music by CARLO M IN "SI. 
A happy litile man • 
The ladies say I 
am, 
And when you see me dance about 
Deny it if you can. 
It's always been my rule, 
From the days I 
went to school, 
To banish care and not despair, 
But treat things mighty cool. 
Some folks will fret 
For things they cannot get, 
But I 
sustain the notion 
We may be happy yet. 
So be merry if you can, 
As the ladies say I 
am, 
For none can win affection like 
A happy little man. 
I 
early fell in love, 
My head and ears above, 
Proposed and was accepted by 
A perfect " little dove ; " 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS .

But oh, unlucky fate, 
How often, when too late, 
An act of rashness proves to us 
In calmness a 
mistake! 
The wedding morn to church, 
My bride I 
went in search, 
But found I 
had been jilted,— 
She left me in the lurch, 
And to weep my friends began, 
But I, not such a 
Sam, 
Commenced a 
jig upon the steps, 
A happy little man. 
Then why attempt to shun 
Your troubles when they come? 
The thickest cloud but for a 
time 
Obscures the golden sun. 
Again in love I 
fell, 
-With an antiquated belle, 
Her age was over sixty, 
But she suited very well: 
Enamel on her face 
Distinctly I 
could trace, 
But what's the odds? 
Affection 
To money must give place, 
And, although my love was sham, , 
She said ( behind her fan) 
You've won my heart and cash, you have, 
You happy little man. 
In twelve months she was gone, 
And [ was left to mourn 
'22 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
The loss of one I 
never loved — 
A widower forlorn 
But though of wife bereft, 
And from her presence cleft, 
She solaced my affection 
And a 
handsome fortune left ; 
And thus it proves to me • • 
That Once in life we see 
A chance to make a 
fortune, 
"Whate'er our station be. 
And when you have found the plan 
Do all the good you can, ' 
And live, like me, contented, 
And a 
happy little man. 
We're all so fond of Kissing.

Oh, kiss me quick and let me go, 
Don't keep me here a

It is a 
shame to plague me so, 
We're all so fond of kissing. 
I

To see you act so silly, 
I 
think I'll have to kiss you first, 
I'm getting very chilly.

She's fond of kissing, that I 
know, 
For often as I 
met her 
She said " Oh kiss and let me go, 
You'll love me all the better." 
At evening, when the hour was late, 
The old folks they were missing, 
I

We ' re all so fond of kissing.

So now I'll give you for advice, 
Whene'er you go a

Don't do your kissing in the dark,

But choose the dqy and fear no shame, 
It won't be much distressing, 
I 
think you ' 11 every one consent, 
We ' re all so fond of kissing.

A Poor Old Woman of Eighty. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
How good and how great of this country so free, 
In the midst of its matters so weighty, 
To think of so lonely a 
creature as me, 
A poor old woman of eighty. 
John Strong is as likely a 
lad as you 'd 
see, 
And one that would never say nay t' you; 
Only think what a 
comfort he ' 11 be unto me, 
A poor old woman of eighty. 
When Co beaux came all around me in praise of 
my charms, 
Oh! says.I, sirs, I ' ve nothing to say t' you, 
For I've got a 
young man that will keep my back 
warm, 
Though a 
poor old woman of eighty. 
I 've searched the world o'er to get one to my mind, 
I ' ye examined both clergy and laity, 
But John Strong is the man that seems mostly in-
clined 
To please an old woman of eighty.

My Darling Clemantine. 
Sung by BILLY MonRts. 
Down by the river there lived a 
maiden, 
In a 
cottage built just seven by nine, 
And all around this lovely bower 
The sunflower blossoms used to twine. 
CHORUS— Oh my Clema, oh my Clema, 
Oh my darling Clemantine, 
Now you are lost and gone forever, 
I ' m 
dreadful sorry, Clemantine. 
Her lips were like two luscious beefsteaks 
Dipped in tomato sass and wine, 
And like the Cashmere goat's covering 
Was the fine wool of Clemantine. 
CHORUS— Oh my Clema, & c. 
Her foot, oh golly, 't 
was a 
beauty; 
Her shoes were made of Digby pine; 
Two herring boxes without the tops on 
Just made the sandals for Clemantine. 
CHORUS — Oh my Clema, & c. 
One day the wind was blowing awful, 
I 
took her down some old rye wine, 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS.

And listened to the flute-like ravings 
Of my sweet sunflower, Clemautine. 
Cnouu-s— Oh my Clema, & c. 
The ducks had gone down to the river, 
To drive them back she did incline, 
She stubbed her toe, and oh ken sliver, 
She fell into the foamy brine. 
CHORUS— Oh 
my Clema, & c. 
I 
see'd her lips above the water 
A-blowing bubbles very fine, 
But ' t 
wa' n't no use, I 
wa' n't no swimmer, 
And so I 
lost my Clemantine. 
CHouus— Oh my Clema, &c. 
Now every night, down by the river, 
Her ghostess walks 'bout half-past nine; 
I know 't 
is her, a-kase I ' ve tracked her; 
And by the smell t' is Clemantine. 
Cuouus — Oh my Clem, & c. 
Now all young men, by this take warning, 
Do n't give your ladies too much wile, 
'Kase, like as not, in this wet weather 
She '11 share the fate of Clemantine

PARODY ON 
When this Cruel War is over. 
Sung by BILLY M ORRIS. 
Dearest Sal, do you remember 
When I "'welled away, 
With my gun upon my shoulder, 
Looking neat and gay? 
Now those shining regimentals 
All in rags appear, 
Darns and patches all about them ;—. 
Awful times out here. 
CHORUS — Weeping sad and lonely, 
Lord, how bad I 
feel I 
When this cruel war is over— 
Praying for a 
good square meal 
I 
used to sport a 
diamond breast-pin, 
And vote for Hen. Wilson, 
Take my bitters up at Parker's, 
Eat my beans with Gilson ; 
Now the ease is slightly alte'red — 
Here we ' ve got to work 
On biscuits twice as hard as brick- bats, 
And gutta percha pork. 
CHORUS — Weeping sad and lonely, &c. 
And, of course, you do remember 
How I 
used to spree — 
A regular, gay, old-fashioned bender 
Was only fun to me. 
• 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
Here, in company with whiskey 
Nary time I've been; 
Pay a 
quarter to the sutler, 
And only get camphene. 
CHohys — Weeping sad and lonely, &c. 
How I 
miss my plate of fish-balls, 
And my oyster-stew, — 
Hoping that I ' 11 soon have plenty 
Of beef and mutton too. 
We will know no more of sorrow, 
Married you and I; 
Then will everything be lovely 
And the goose hang high.

The Chelsea War Widow. 
Tune—" Our grandfather's Days." 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
Written by C. ST. Arm 
To all you young men my advice I 
give free, — 
Whenever a 
pretty war widow you see, 
Take warning by one who was caught in a 
snare, 
And of all the war widows I 
tell you beware. 
As I 
went out strolling one fine afternoon, 
Down Tremont, through Court,to Brigham's Saloon, 
I 
turned round the corner and who should I 
meet 
But a 
lady, just coming up Hanover street. 
30 
e  
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
She was dressed in deep black, costing hundreds 
or more, 
I 
knew by her face that I ' d 
seen her before, 
And as she came near me, in true Boston style, 
I 
took off my hat and just gave her a 
smile. 
Says she, " My dear sir, you ' re a 
stranger to me." 
Says I, " My dear maiden, offended do n't be; 
Although quite a 
stranger to you I 
may seem, 
Will you step into Copeland's and have an ice-
cream?" 
At first she refused, but soon gave her consent, 
Then straightway to CopelanXs together we went; 
She said she 'd 
been walking and felt very weak, 
And instead of the cream, why, she 'd 
take a 
beef-
steak. 
We chatted and talked as we sat there together, 
Of all sorts, of things and the changeable weather ; 
She said that her husband had gone to the war, 
And was formerly conductor on a 
Chelsea horse car. 
She said that she lived on his bounty alone, 
And over in Chelsea she had a 
nice home. 
Thinks I 
to myself, you are dressed very gay, 
He must be a 
captain and draw extra pay. 
She finished her steak at a 
two-forty rate, 
Then said she must go as 't 
was getting quite late. 
I 
offered my arm, she quick gave her consent, 
Then down to the Ferry together we went. 
The boat had just gone, so we stood arm in arm, 
Awaiting the next and thinking no 'harm, 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS.

When up stepped a 
ruffian and threatened my life, 
And asked me what business I 
had with his wife. 
"'Your wife, my dear sir ! " that was all that I 
said. 
He drew his revolver and placed at my head; 
Says he, " Now prepare, for, as sure as I 
speak, 
This story will be continued in the Ledger no 
week." 
Peter Gray. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
My song is of a 
nice young maa, 
They called him Peter Gray, 
He fell in love with a 
fair young girl 
In Penn-syl-va-nia-ra, 
In Penn-syl-va-nia-ra, 
In Penn-syl-va-nia-ra, 
He fell in love with a 
fair young girl 
In Penn-syl-va-nia-ra. 
CHORUS — Come back, Peter, 
Come back, Peter Gray, 
While we sing tooral laddy oh, 
Sing tooral laddy day. 
They wanted to be mar-ri-ed, 
But her daddy he said " No !" 
So he cruelly transported her 
, 
Beyond the O-hi-o, 
Beyond the 0-hi- o, 
Beyond the O-hi- o, 
So he cruelly transported her 
Beyond the 0-hi- o. 
CHORUS — Come back, Peter, & c. 
When Lizzy found her love was crossed 
She did n't know what to say, 
So she went and drowned herself 
In the Sus-qui-a-ni-a, 
In the Sus-qui-a-ni-a, 
In the Sus-qui-a-ni-a, 
So she went and drowned herself 
In the Sus-qui-a-ni-a. 
CHORUS - Come back, Peter, &c. 
Now Peter Gray went trading 
With furs and other skins, 
Where he got scalped and tomahawked 
By the nasty In-ji-ens, 
By the nasty In-ji-ens, 
By the nasty In-ji-ens, 
Where be got scalped and tomahawked 
By the nasty In-ji-ens. 
CHORUS 
Come back, Peter, &c. 
Stern pa-ri-cuts, let boys and girls 
Get married when they can, 
Fore who parts two loving hearts 
Ain't worth a

Ain't worth a

For he who parts two loving hearts 
Ain't worth a

A PLAIN MAN'S 
PHILOSOPHY. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
I 'ye a 
guinea I 
can spend, 
I've a 
wife and I've a 
friend, 
And a 
troop of little children at my knee, 
John Brown. 
I 
'
ve a 
cottage of my own, 
With the ivy overgrown, 
And a 
garden with a 
view of the sea, 
John Brown. 
I 
can sit at my own door, 
By the shady sycamore, 
Large of heart, though of very small estate, 
John Brown. 
So come and drain a 
glass 
In my arbor as you pass, 
And I '11 tell you what I 
love and what I 
hate, 
John Brown. 
I 
love the song of birds, 
And the children's early words, 
And a 
loving woman's voice, low and sweet, 
John Brown. 
And I 
hate a 
false pretense, 
And the want of common sense, 
And arrogance, and fawning, and deceit, 
John Brown. 
34 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS. 
I 
love the meadow flowers, 
And the briar in the bowers, 
And I

John Brown. 
And I 
bate a 
selfish knave, 
And a 
proud contented slave, 
And a 
man who'd rather borrow than he ' d 
toil 
John Brown. 
I 
love a 
simple song, 
That awakes emotion strong, 
And the word of hope that raises him who faints 
John Brown. 
And I 
hate the constant whine 
Of the foolish, who repine, 
And turn their good to evil by complaints, 
John Brown. 
But even when I 
hate, 
If I 
seek my garden gate, 
And survey the world around me and above, 
• 
John Brown, 
The hatred flies my mind, 
And I 
sigh for human kind, 
And excuse the faults I 
cannot love, 
John Brown. 
So, if you like my ways, 
And the comfort of my days, 
I 
can tell you how I 
live so unvexed, 
John Brown. 
I 
never scorn my health, 
Nor sell my soul for wealth, 
Nor destroy one day the pleasure of the next, 
John Brown. 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS.

I ' ye parted with my pride, 
And I

For I ' ve found it worse than folly to be sad,

I 
keep my conscience clear, 
I ' ve a 
hundred pounds a-year, 
And I 
manage to exist and to be glad, 
John Brown. 
All my Eye! 
Am.—"No Irish need apply." 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
In eighteen hundred sixty-two, what funny things 
we find, 
Things that in the after-time will sure be borne in 
mind, 
For every one should seek to know what happens 
in ins time ; 
So to assist the memory I'll put them,into rhyme, 
And try to do my best, by public friends to satisfy, 
And If I 'm not successful, pray do n't say it 's 
all 
my eye. 
Ar 
Our brethren are bent on naught but slaughter, 
I 'm very sorry that we have such scenes this side 
of the water; 
The North sometimes victorious is, and so we find 
the South, 
But neither ever LOSES, if we take their word of 
mouth;

There ' s 
a 
very hard-work'd judge — you ' 11 wish 
to know his name, of course — 
I 
mean Sir eresswell Cresswell— who presides, 
folks to divorce. 
His court's a 
kind of music-hall, and the songs 
they sing at night 
Are — first " Will you love me then as now?" 
then, " Oh ! must we part to-night?" 
" 
We met" is the early melody; next, " Good-bye, 
my love, good-bye, 
But " I ' 11 never, never leave thee," is a 
song that 's 
all my eye. 
You' ye heard about the soldier who they scrubbed 
with sand and brush — 
A 
deed like this, so cruel, is enough to make one 
blush — 
The wounds upon his body p'rhaps might make 
him feel the smart; 
Ali! would the perpetrator had such wounds upon 
his heart. 
An act like this all 
certain will dercy, 
For to punish without trial you ' 11 agree is all my 
eye. 
To the feminine community I 
now make my ad-
dress — 
Should furrows wrinkle o'er their brows, they need 
feel no distress, 
BILLY MORRIS'S SONGS.

For they now can be enamelled till they look like 
rosy youth, 
And nobody can fathom out the falsehood from the

Of washes and of ointments Rachel keeps a 
large

But when she asks a 
thousand pounds you '11 say 
it ' s 
all my eye.

Sung by BILLY Monms. 
Now all you darkies "hear my story, 
And list to what I 
say; 
To-morrow I'll be married, 
Oh, what a 
happy day! 
To a 
pretty little yellow gal, 
Whose form is plump and neat; 
And her lips, when you taste ' em, 
Are just like a 
sugar beet. 
CHORUS— Then what's the use sighing, darkies? 
Let us all be gay; 
To-morrow 's 
Pompey's wedding, 
Oh, what a 
happy day ! 
When I 
am married and settled, boys, 
I ' 11 introduce you all ; 
We ' 11 have a 
hoe-down on the green, 
And such a 
fancy ball, 
With swash-a-hands across, 
Gals go down the middle ; 
And old " Duck Morgan," that's left-banded 
in one eye, 
He shall play the fiddle. 
CHORUS — Then what 's 
the use? &c. 
My wife and little snow-ball, 
How happy we should be; 
I ' d 
buy a 
little farm and hut, 
Way down in Tennessee, 
And of a 
Summer's evening, 
How pleasant it would be, 
To make the bones and banjo, ring, 
Beneath the old gum tree.

When the press gang they took me, 
And sent me to sea, 
And there strange sights 
Young Larry was to see. 
" 
With their raking, yes and with their 
scraping." 
Sure a 
sailor they were making of young 
Larry; 
Och and thunder was the game that I 
did tarry, 
Which did never do for Larry O'Brien, 
Then the captain gave orders for sailing, 
Contrary winds were prevailing, 
American ships we were hailing, 
Played the divil wid young Larry O'Brien ; 
When a 
fair wind we got, 
Och, we whipped her into dock, 
And then we did strip her of strap, mast and block. 
SPOKEN— " 
With their oakum, yes, and with their 
divilish oakum." 
CHORUS — Sure a 
sailor, & c. 
Then the Captain came up as soft as milk sop, 
And ordered me right up into the top, 
Which caused my head to whirl around like a 
whips 
ping top, 
Which did never do for Larry O'Brien; 
Then the sailors went up, - 
And they lowered down a 
rope, 
And they fastened it around my body, 
And they hauled me up. 
SPOKEN - They were hauling, yes, and I 
was 
bawling, 
Still, the divils, they kept hauling on 
young Larry.

Why, hoecake and hominy, and Shangmalanma-

Bessie Gray; 
OR, 
I 
WILL AND I 
WON'T. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
Long time a-courting I 
had been, 
The village Queen of May, 
A 
maiden fair as summer's skies, 
Whose name was Bessie Gray. 
Otie evening, by the river's brink, 
As we sat side by side, 
With beating heart I 
whispered low, 
" 
Sweetheart, wilt be my bride?" 
She shook her golden ringlets back, 
And laughing, said, " Now do n't; • 
Such folly, sure, was never heard; 
Of course you know I 
won't." 
With anger fired I 
chided her,— 
Her broken vows reproved, 
Recalled sweet tender memories,— 
The maid remained unmoved. 
I 
clasped her little hand,—'t 
was cold,— 
I 
said, " False girl, you 're free, 
And ere another day may dawn . 
Why I'll be off to sea." 
" 
No, no," she cried, "'T 
was all a 
jest, 
Say but you love me still, 
And I'll confess a 
maiden's WON'T 
May sometimes mean I 
WILL!" 
Now twenty years are past and gone, 
A 
happy couple we, 
With health and sweet contentment blest, 
And prattlers round our knee. 
And now my simple song is done, 
The moral I ' 11 impart, 
Oft words escape from the lips which find 
. 
No echo in the heart; 
" 
The course of true love ne'er runs smooth," 
The adage holds good still, 
Then never daunted be by WON'T, 
And you may gain your WILL. 
What can't be cured. 
Sung by BILLY MORRIS. 
Oh, youth and folly make men marry; 
So fare you well, love, I'm going away; 
What can't be cured, love, must be endured,— 
Then fare you well, I 
must go away. 
CHORUS — What can't be cured, love, must be en-
dured, 
So fare you well, I 'm going away. 
She cried and sighed, oh, when we parted; 
Says I, " My dear, wipe your tears away; 
She says to me, " John, I'm broken-hearted, 
To think you 're going far upon the sea." 
CHORUS — What can't be cured, &c. 
" 
11:ly heart is sad, lovely Johnny, dear, 
To think you ' d 
leave your Sally here; 
Aiwa.

If a

Says I, " I've a

So, though I

Stabbed Martha Jane, the butcher's clerk— 
SPOKEN — What did they do? 
They died without a

Now this fine young colored man 
That loved his Martha Jane, 
lie went down to the river side, 
And thought he 'd

They gave him a

Jeff. Davis' Ball. 
"Lanagan's Ball. 
Sung tiy BILLY MORRIS. 
Far do vrh in the South there lives Jeffy Davis, 
He has swindled his friends till they have u't a 
pound, 
Secession he thought would make him a 
man aga n, 
Leave him a 
fortune and plenty of ground. 
He gave a 
large party to friends and relations, 
That stood by his side his treason to call ; 
And if you but listen, I'll make your eyes glisten, 
With a 
promise then made for Davis' Ball. 
His wife and himself gave free invitations 
To all the Chivalry, first to the last, 
And in less than an hour had plenty of traitors, 
All drinking his whiskey, like bees round a 
cask. 
He says to the Army, now march into Washington, 
Be there on the Fourth, on Lincoln to call, 
And give out my cards to the great Yankee Nation, 
To make themselves ready for Davis' Ball. 
He called upon Lee to start up the music, 
And then upon Ewell to lead on the van; 
Then Longstreet and Hill will ford the Potomac, 
And drive all the Yankees from our Maryland: 
We'll dine on the best in the Cumberland Valley, 
And take enough home to last us a 
year, 
Then when we have feasted we'll make a 
gran d 
rally, 
And drive to the North these Old Volunteers.
