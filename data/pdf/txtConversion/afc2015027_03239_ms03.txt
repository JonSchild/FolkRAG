Claudette Foote interviewed by Christine Lewis with Chris Mule 
00:01.2 
Interviewer: Good afternoon, what is your name? Or the name you will be using for this 
interview? 
My name is Claudette Foote. 
00:21.0 
Interviewer: Claudette Foote. What is your current occupation? 
I am a housekeeper/nanny. 
00:28.2 
Interviewer: What borough or neighborhood do you live in? 
I live in the borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is Crown Heights. 
00:43.2 
Interviewer: Where are you originally from? 
Well, I am from the beautiful island of Jamaica West Indies. 
00:52.1 
Interviewer: How did you become a domestic worker? 
Well, let's see. Domestic work, as long as you take care of your house you are a 
domestic worker so just gradually being a woman, having children, and taking care of 
my house that title-- makes me a domestic worker. 
01:20.3 
Interviewer: And how long have you been in the domestic work force? 
I have been in the domestic work force for about 14 years. 
01:34.1 
Interviewer: How many positions have you had? 
Well, let me see. I've had a lot of positions because I have done many different levels of 
domestic work. I have cleaned house, I have taken care of elderly people, I have taken 
care of babies, so I have had many different positions over the years.

02:01.1 
Interviewer: What motivated you to be a part of this project? 
Well when I became a part of--well, when I became a nanny and when I heard about this 
project, I said, 'Why not tell my story too?' So I was asked if I would share my story and I 
said yes and now I get an opportunity to tell what I've been doing over the years and 
how I've been doing it. 
02:34.2 
Interviewer: Please walk me through a typical day routine. What are your day-to-day 
responsibilities? 
Okay. In the life of the nanny, of me, going to work, and in order for the parents to go to 
work and then there's feeding the baby, making sure the baby takes a nap, then there's 
some babies that go to class so I'll take the baby to a class. If it's not a class, it's to a play 
date or to the museum, to a park, different activities that keep me and the baby 
occupied for the day. 
03:20.3 
Interviewer: What skills do you need to become a domestic worker? Is there any special 
skill that would make it even better for you? 
Skills. [pauses.] I don't know if I would put it into skills, but first of all you have to be a 
very patient person, because the work that you do is-- doesn't [pauses] so much 
stressful, sometimes it's the people that you work for that makes the work hard, 
because if you know what you have to do, you go in you do what you have to do in the 
time that is allotted for you to do that and at the end of it all you're done, you go home. 
But if you work for difficult people, it makes the job a little more harder.  
I wouldn't say there's a special skill. Being the kind of person that I am, I would say just 
being a patient person would make your day go a little easier. [short interruption.] 
05:14.1 
Interviewer: Is there some specialty or expertise that you have? Could you 
state/elaborate? 
Yes, I do. I am. I am a certified CPR. I'm certified in--I have my nanny training and I am 
also certified as a childcare provider. In the event that something happens to the baby, 
like choking or anything like that, I am prepared. 
05:49.3 
Interviewer: What will make you so prepared? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

What would make me so prepared is because I am CPR certified. I am also certified as a 
childcare provider. 
 
06:10.1 
Interviewer: What conditions do you face throughout your work experience as a 
domestic worker in the industry? Could you elaborate a little more?  
 
Well, I face different conditions. I face good conditions, I face not so good conditions, 
but I try to take it one step at a time. Example: if I am having a bad day, I don't take my 
feelings on the job. If I have a bad day, my boss doesn't know. Is that enough? 
 
07:05.2 
Interviewer: Or, like, if there's--in your work as a nanny and a baby sitter, what are some 
of the--is there one particular experience that was really great on your job or maybe one 
condition of your job that is really bad, like an employer or a good employer, that's 
really what we're trying to get to. Are there specifics maybe? I think we just need to get 
to specifics, examples.  
 
I usually work for good employers. I usually offer for my employers to do to go the extra 
mile to do extra even if my job doesn't require it, but as long as it makes the day and the 
job more easier than I go above and beyond. That make any sense?  
 
Specifically, taking the baby to the museum, taking the baby to the library, even if it's 
not on my schedule, taking the baby to the library because we are the first people, 
nannies are the first people that helps the baby to develop their--what do you call--their 
[Interviewer: motor skills.] motor skills, we teach them ABC's, we take them to the 
library, teach them to read, we take them to the park to socialize with other kids, we 
make play dates for them to interact with other kids, we do a lot as a nannies. 
 
08:40.3 
Interviewer: So what is the best part of your job? Please give an example. 
 
The best part of my job as a nanny is seeing the development of the child, because most 
times we get the babies from the hospital within the first three months of their lives and 
to watch a baby grow from a newborn into an infant into a toddler, learning to crawl, 
walk, talk, do all that kind of thing is very motivating for me as a nanny. 
 
09:24.0 
Interviewer: What is the worst part of your job? Please give an example. 
 
The worst part of my job would be trying to get a--my parents would say they would 
love to have the baby on a schedule, yet when you're using your expertise to put the 
baby on a schedule, then parents do the opposite of what they're asking you to do. So 
that's a little frustrating sometimes, because you'll get it right say five days of the week 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

and then Monday when you go off for the weekend and come back on Monday you 
have to do it all over again, so sometimes it's a little frustrating. [Interviewer: 
Challenging.] Yes. 
 
10:09.1 
Interviewer: What challenges or source of tension do you face on the job? 
 
Like I said, if the parents are not cooperating with the rules that they give your or the 
instructions that they give you, then it makes your job a little challenging. Say for 
example, to feed a baby at a particular time, to put the baby on a feeding schedule, and 
you do it every three hours and then on the weekend mommy does it every time she 
thinks the baby needs to eat, then it becomes a little bit challenging when you have to 
come back on Monday and have to get it right all over again for the week, so that's a 
little bit challenging. 
 
10:55.1 
Interviewer: How is your relationship with your current employer? 
 
We have a good relationship in the fact that we work hand-in-hand. This employer is 
more understanding; she sticks to what she says, so we work together to get the job 
done. 
 
11:22.0 
Interviewer: Are there relationships with previous children you have cared for that are 
particularly memorable in a good or bad kind of way? 
 
Yes. I had a little boy, I took care of him from seven weeks until he was four years old, 
and I remember one summer I took him to the amusement park [short interruption.] 
and he wanted to go on the slide and I said, 'I don't think I want to go up there,' because 
it was a little high for me, and he says, 'Claudette, don't be afraid. I will hold your hand 
and we can go down together.' And that made me [laughs.] that made me end up going 
on the slide, because of the way he told me he wouldn't let me be scared. [Interviewer: 
That was memorable.] That is memorable. 
 
12:26.0 
Interviewer: Do you feel that the amount of hours you work and your holiday schedule 
are being respected? 
 
Yes and no. Some days you get to go home on time, some days you don't. The respect of 
letting you know a little ahead of time that you'll be going home a little late, that is 
lacking sometimes. 
 
12:59.0 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Interviewer: Do they ever, like if they're running late, call you and notify you that they're 
running late? 
 
That is the respect I would love. Not ten minutes before you leave work, then you call to 
say I'm running an hour late, because we as nannies and caregivers, we do have a life 
after work and we would love to go home to our families too. 
 
13:25.3 
Interviewer: And do you have kids? 
 
I do have family. I do have children and I have a husband, too. 
 
13:32.1 
Interviewer: So that can be really frustrating when you know it's your time to leave to go 
to your family and you're being held back unjustly.  
 
Chris Mule: I'm going to interrupt--One thing we should be careful of is leading the 
witness, just so, I hear you and I'm sure that's the case, but just you know, and there's a 
section we'll get to and what you're doing is great because forget the script-- 
 
Interviewer: Yeah, I'm trying to pull it a little more, pull a little more out of her.  
 
Chris Mule: Yeah, so we're just trying, there's a section a little further down that's 'How 
do you Balance Your Life' so I think that right now, this is a good example, you know, she 
brought it up, let's just pounce on it instead of going through into it a little bit later, 
because she's talking about it, so and you don't even have to think about the script. I 
mean the basic idea is how do you balance your work life, what does your family think 
about you being a nanny and taking care of another family. So do you want to startâ€” 
 
14:50.1 
Interviewer: Okay, next question.  
 
Chris Mule: You could go into that if you want, the question about family. 
 
Interviewer: I won't try to push too much.  
 
Chris Mule: Yeah. I'm not trying to-- 
 
Interviewer: Okay. Would you say that you or any worker that you know has been 
exploited due to immigration status? 
 
I have not been personally exploited by immigration status. I have heard stories that 
people haven't been paid the amount of hours they worked and wasn't given time off 
for personal reasons, but I have not had that experience. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

15:45.3 
Interviewer: Do you ever share cultural things from your heritage with the family you 
assist? For example: food, language, folktales, or beliefs about life and death? 
 
Definitely. We as Caribbean nannies and caregivers usually tend to go above and beyond 
especially when it comes to food, because we normally take our food to work and then 
our food has a little bit more taste, texture, scents to it, so when you open your lunch 
box and that aroma comes out of it and your employer says, 'What are you eating?' and 
you say, 'It's jerk pork or jerk chicken,' and they say, 'Where did you get that?' and you'll 
say, 'I made it at home,' and they'll say, 'Can I have it?' and you'll let them try it and then 
guess what, now it becomes a part of them, they say, 'Okay, can you make this for us?' 
and you make it for them and they always tend to like our kind of food. 
 
17:03.3 
Interviewer: Do you currently have your own children or family or individual relationship 
that you are taking care of? 
 
Yes, I do. I have a family. I have a husband and I have three children. 
 
17:21.0 
Interviewer: How do you manage balancing your personal life and work life? 
 
Well, as an individual, as a mom, as a wife, work is also part of my life. Work is as 
important as my family. So I balance my job and my family life, it goes hand in hand. 
 
17:51.1 
Interviewer: How does being a domestic worker impact your own family life? 
 
Being a domestic worker, it impacts your life a lot because your life on the job is 
basically the life that you have at home also because most of the things you do at home 
you do it on the job. Let's say you clean your house, you do your laundry, you cook your 
meals. Being a domestic worker that's the kind of job you do, so it's not [pauses.] what 
word should I use now, it's, it's fulfilling knowing that your everyday life matches up 
with your job. 
 
18:38.3 
Interviewer: Are you a member of any group? 
 
Yes, I am a worker of the Domestic Workers United group. 
 
18:55.0 
Interviewer: Are you a member of other groups? 
 
Other groups? No. 
Domestic Workers United

19:01.3 
Interviewer: When you are doing domestic work, do you feel supported or have you felt 
like you are working in an isolated environment? 
 
Yes and no. Yes in the fact that I have known other people who do domestic work and 
especially nannies, so we share on a day-to-day basis the same things that we do 
together. No in the fact that [pauses.] I do what I do because I love what I do, and at the 
end of the day I go home to my family. 
 
20:01.1 
Interviewer: When and why did you become part of Domestic Workers United and how 
did you hear about Domestic Workers United? 
 
When I became a member was about two and half years ago. I have heard about 
Domestic Worker, but being an undocumented immigrant makes you a little shy, but 
then I worked for a family that treated me unfair and so a friend of mine told me about 
Domestic Worker and what they can help you with so I called the number that I got and 
I spoke to a lady at the desk and she invited me to a meeting, and here I am two and a 
half years later a member of Domestic Workers United. 
 
20:58.2 
Interviewer: What has it meant for you and your work that Domestic Workers Bill of 
Rights passed in 2010? 
 
Well that gives a little hope to domestic workers because in the past they were not 
included in any bill that would allow them to have rights working as domestic workers, 
so for me that means a lot because not only would I get paid for the job that I do, but I 
would also be respected for the job that I do. 
 
21:37.1 
Interviewer: What would you like to see happen in the future with the Bill of Rights? 
 
I would like to see a little more accountability with the Bill of Rights, because now some 
employers, because most nannies work one-on-one with families, it's a two employer to 
a one employee ratio and in order for the Bill of Rights to be effective, I think it has to be 
like 15 or more, so I would like to see a little more enforcement when it comes on to 
smaller groups of people, let's say nannies and elderly caregivers. 
 
22:20.2 
Interviewer: So what does it mean by fifteen or more? Can you give me a little more 
clarification? 
 
Fifteen or more employees would make it effective--for the Bill to be effective. Am I 
making sense? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
7
22:35.2 
Interviewer: You talking about Bill, you talking about having a union? To have a union, I 
believe, is fifteen or more workers under the same-- [CF: Yes. But--] But the Bill of 
Rights. What does it mean to you, because my understanding is that it included all 
domestic workers in the labor laws, which wasn't the case [inaudible.] decades ago.  
 
But the--well, for me I think it would make it a little more important to nannies, 
caregivers, house keepers, because of working one-on-one with employees it gives a 
little more flexibility for you to get paid for the hours and time that you work. 
 
23:27.0 
Interviewer: Okay. What would you like to see happen in the future with the Bill of 
Rights? From your perspective, why is Domestic Workers United important for domestic 
workers? 
 
That's the one we just did, now do the other one. Domestic Workers United gives you a 
little--if I may say comfort in knowing that there are people that you could go to to talk 
to in the event that you have problems with your employers, because sometimes you 
have good employers, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you're taken for granted, so 
when you know that you have people that you can talk to that share the same interest 
as you do, it makes it a little more comforting. 
 
24:28.0 
Interviewer: What do you want legislators to know? 
 
I want legislators to know that domestic workers are important people. We are a part of 
the work force and therefore we need to be respected. 
 
24:50.2 
Interviewer: Are you happy with the Bill's impact? 
 
Yes and no. Yes in the fact that the Bill was passed so I know that the recognition was 
given.  
 
Interviewer: So, in other words, the Bill wasn't being recognized that you see? 
 
Right, the Bill was passed, but it wasn't recognized for some people. Am I making sense? 
 
25:30.1 
Interviewer: So to my understanding, the Bill was not a strong bill, it was just a bill that 
passed. 
 
I would say they passed the Bill just to get rid of us. Or because domestic workers were 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
8
going to Albany, making--trying to get this bill passed in order for us to be respected for 
the work that we do. But in the end, there was--the recognition is not totally there. 
 
26:06.3 
Interviewer: So would you say that this Bill has to be followed up and reinforced? 
 
Yes. 
 
26:19.3 
Interviewer: What areas of education/skills are you looking to gain? You're looking to 
gain, like is there anything you're grasping at, an area that would make life more 
comfortable, more accommodating, more enriched. 
 
Education, how do I answer that one? Education, yes. To know what it is that the Bill of 
Rights stands for, to know what it is, to have a say in the kind of work that we do. To 
know what it is to be paid what you work for, to be recognized, yes. 
 
27:25.2 
Interviewer: What skills did Domestic Workers United teach you? What type of training? 
 
Well, we get the nanny training and we also get CPR certified through Domestic Workers 
United, so that is a plus. 
 
27:50.2 
Interviewer: So just let me say, you have a nanny training course, which is certified, as 
well as a CPR training, so I guess that makes you more assertive in your workplace. More 
confident, more empowered.  
 
Yes. 
 
28:14.0 
Interviewer: How is cultural expression used as a tool for advocacy and outreach of 
Domestic Workers United, such as music, dance, or poetry/proverbs. 
 
Well, being a member of Domestic Workers United you get the opportunity to do a 
whole lot of different things. You get to do poetry, you get to do art, you get to go to 
different other organizations to learn what they do, you get to go to other events and 
you get a better knowledge of different cultural things that are happening especially in 
the borough. 
 
29:12.2 
Interviewer: Do you have any last words or parting shots you would like to share? 
 
Yes. I am a proud member of Domestic Workers United. When I thought there was no 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
9
hope being a domestic worker, getting involved in the Domestic Workers United opened 
my eyes and my mind more as to the work that I do, the respect that I should get as a 
domestic worker, and different levels of things to do and places to go. Things to get 
involved in, like I said before, the arts, the poetry. Yeah. 
 
30:09.1 
Interviewer: So. Domestic Workers United is a very important organization in your life? 
It's also important--do you learn about your rights as an immigrant woman from 
Domestic Workers United?  
 
It is, yes. 
  
Yes, I do. Some things that I didn't know ten years ago. For the two and a half years that 
I've been here, I have learned and experienced a lot. 
 
30:43.2 
Interviewer: Has it helped you that the things that you learned--did that help you in any 
way in--any memory that you could remember, something that you learned from 
Domestic Workers United that you could have applied to work life or home life or family 
life? 
 
Yes, it helped me on my job, because I get trained as a nanny--get the nanny training 
and I get certified at CPR. 
 
31:14.2 
Interviewer: So then I want to thank you, and I do appreciate your time and your 
patience.  
 
Chris Mule: Can I ask one follow up question? You had talked about--for domestic 
workers, does taking care of elders and house cleaning, is that also under the realm, can 
you maybe talk a bit about what is different about elder care, what is that experience 
like, maybe if you could talk just a bit about that? 
 
Interviewer: So the questions should be, what's the difference between being a nanny 
and an elder caregiver? 
 
Chris Mule: Yeah, and house cleaning. 
 
Interviewer: And house keeping.  
 
Chris Mule: Yeah. What's the difference between a nanny, an elder care, and a 
housekeeper?  
 
Okay, I--let me see how I put this. The difference between a nanny and an elderly 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
10
caregiver is that you're-- being a nanny you're [inaudible.]  because you watch children 
growing from being babies to become teenagers, young adults. Being an elderly care 
person, in most cases, it's sick people, sometimes they can't do stuff for themselves so 
you watch an individual going like basically to the end of their life. A house keeper, now, 
you make sure the place is clean, you have to cook, do laundry, do groceries, so it's 
different stages and sometimes you have to do all three, sometimes you have to do two 
so, and it can be a little bit challenging. 
 
33:10.1 
Interviewer: So one question, just curious, so you being hired as a nanny, does it include 
house keeping and laundry, cooking, and all of these things?  
 
Yes. Basically when you are a nanny it includes--it is housekeeping and a nanny, so it's 
like two jobs in one. If you're doing elderly care it's still like two jobs in one, because you 
still have to take care of the place and you have to take care of the elderly person that 
you do, and being a nanny you have to take care of the child and of course you have to 
take care of the place, and you still have to do cooking and all of that kind of stuff too. 
Being a nanny. 
 
33:53.1 
 
Interviewer: So do you agree to be a nanny/chef/housekeeper/dog walker too? Is it one 
salary or four different salaries? 
 
It's, yes, yes. It is one salary. 
 
34:16.0 
Interviewer: Is that fair to you? 
 
It is not fair because that's one person doing four peoples' job and at the end of the day 
you only get paid for one job. 
 
34:29.2 
 
 
Interviewer: Do you ever say anything, knowing that it's unjust to you? So on that day, 
when you're being hired, do you specify or ask what is your job description? 
 
Yes and no. You want to say something, that's the yes. And then you're looking at the 
fact that if I say something I might lose my job. You look at it now as-- I can say that's 
exploitation because I was hired to be the nanny, that's just taking care of the child, 
then it comes to being a housekeeper, because now I have to do laundry for everyone, I 
have to cook for everyone, and I also have to walk the dog. There's a little trick in that, 
because when you go on the interview and they say the job it's about taking care of the 
baby, taking care of the baby includes doing the baby's laundry and doing the baby's 
meals. While doing the baby's laundry, you come across mommy's t-shirt and mommy's 
socks and stuff like that and you will say, 'Well, this is not a part of my job.' If you were 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
11
to single it out and say, 'I'm not doing mommy's t-shirt in the laundry,' you know, 
mommy comes home, you say, 'I found your shirt in the laundry,' she probably wouldn't 
do it again, but then you get scared to say I'm not doing it and she might say, 'It's 
laundry, so why not do it?' You might end up losing your job for not washing one t-shirt 
for mommy. 
 
36:09.2 
Interviewer: So that fear. Where does that fear come from that you cannot speak up for 
your right? If we keep on this way, not saying anything, do you think there will ever be 
change within the domestic work industry? 
 
No. If we don't speak up, there will never be change, because I think the ratio to get a 
nanny job now is like 10:1 with the widespread internet it makes it a little harder so I 
think a lot of nannies take stuff on their job that they did not agree to in the interview, 
just to hold their job. You didn't agree to walk the dog in the interview. You didn't agree 
to clean mommy's bedroom in the interview. She asked you to do it one time and most 
times, when your employer asks you to do something one time and you do it, eventually 
it becomes your job. 
 
37:09.1 
Interviewer: That's how it is?   
 
That's not how it should be. 
 
37:14.1 
Interviewer: You know it's sort of heartbreaking to listen to your story and through it all, 
you are about family, you love your family, you care about your family, and I understand 
the exploitation and the sacrifice that you're making is all for your family, but from 
where I see it, you know if all within the domestic work force could come together, I 
think that there could be change. And stand up for what we believe in. Even one of my 
dreams is seeing all domestic workers one day on strike. 
 
That would be a major shut down. 
 
38:01.1 
Interviewer: So don't you think that we would get the respect, the recognition, the fair 
living wage? As it is, domestic workers, most of us we live paycheck to paycheck. 
 
I think if all domestic workers come together one day and just go on a strike, I think 
there will be drastic changes, because domestic work, domestic workers, allow every 
other job to be possible, because if I--my employers are lawyers--if I don't go to work 
they can't go to their office. If my employers are doctors, I don't go to work they can't 
go to treat a patient, so domestic work and domestic workers make every other job 
possible. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

38:48.1 
Interviewer: So I'll stop at that point, because that's a fact. The work that domestic 
workers do make all other work possible. I thank you and I thank you and I thank you 
again for your story. 
 
You're welcome. 
 
39:05.1 
Chris Mule:  Thank you, that was great, that was awesome. I loved that. Do you feel 
comfortable? 
 
Interviewer: Yes. 
 
CHRIS MULE: Sorry I was interrupting. 
 
CF: No, no, no, no, you did good [laughter.] 
 
Chris Mule: I'm just curious, because I think there was a lot of--the whole thing about 
the child development, watching a child grow up, that made me think about a zillion 
different things, and just breaking down, like you guys kind of broke down the--that we 
haven't even really talked about that. It's like four jobs and I think when we ask that 
question, 'What is it to be a nanny?' It's like, 'Well it's like a zillion different things.' 
 
Interviewer: Superlady. 
 
Chris Mule: So, yeah, is it exploitative working with the elderly? Is it similar in that way? 
Do you face the same--I'm just curious. 
 
Interviewer: Is it underpaid? 
 
CF: In elderly care you don't get paid for the hours and the work that you do because 
you in elderly care--both elderly care and in being a nanny, you are the nurse because 
you give medication, you check temperature, you know make sure, so it's-- 
 
Chris Mule: Yeah, and I thought it was interesting the trick you said, just like that 
maneuver, right? I mean, that's, no one has ever said it like that, but it is like a thing, 
right? 
 
CF: It does happen, because I remember one job I had. When I went on the interview 
the mom asked me, 'If I'm leaving work and I ask you to put a chicken in the oven, would 
you be okay with that?' And I'm like this is a two month old baby I'm being interviewed 
for, and you're asking me to--I plainly said to her, 'Put a chicken in the oven for who?' I 
said, 'When the baby gets to eating chicken, I don't have a problem cooking chicken for

the baby.' And sometimes it's not what you do, it's how you do it, because I have had 
employers that asked me to cook my Jamaican food for them, and I do it because at the 
end of the day sometimes you go above and beyond, it's the kind of people that we are. 
Some people will say they get the job to put the chairs in and if there's a piece of paper 
on the floor they can't pick it up, because they're not getting paid for that. In a lot of 
instants I remember there was a time I was home and I saw these guys fixing the road, 
the pot holes in the road, and there was-- he fixed this one and there was on there, and 
I said to him, 'Why not fix this one?'  He said, 'I get paid to fix this one, I don't get paid to 
do that one.' We as nannies, we have more, can I say-- [Interviewer: Visibility. More 
versatile.] and more openness. We go out, we find free classes--there are some parents 
who would not pay for the child to do a class. We go to the library, we get story time, 
we find free music class, free classes in the park in the summer time, we do all kinds of 
stuff, and sometimes it's just a little appreciation would just make the day and the job--
because the kids--let me tell you something. Being a nanny, you have naughty kids, you 
have rude kids, that would make your day go bad, but sometimes at the end of the day 
the parents are who makes the job more difficult. Yep.

Chris Mule: Yeah, so it's a challenge. I mean there are people that are union workers 
that do sound and lights at venues and they will say, if I brought this camera somewhere 
and they say, 'I can't touch that, that's not our property so I can't do it,' You know, a 
table, if I brought a table and they'd be like, 'I can't do it, it's got to be--' There are 
certain things they can and can't do and I respect that, and it's like why isn't it the same 
here-- 
 
CF: Perfect example. I am only taking care of a baby and the baby drinks from a bottle. 
Mommy says to me, 'Oh you can put the baby's bottle in the dish washer, we'll run it.' I 
have to run the dish washer and I will run the dishwasher on Friday before I leave to go 
home for the weekend and when I come back to work on Monday, the dishwasher is still 
there and you have two parents plus an aunt and an uncle in the apartment all 
weekend. They'll go in the dishwasher and they'll take a bottle out and they'll just use 
that and leave it in the sink for you to come back for it on Monday. They will use the 
garbage--I had one employer, she only empties the garbage like five minutes before I 
come to work on Monday, so when you come into the apartment it's all diaper smelling. 
And you know they just take it out because sometimes you see her coming from the 
chute. And funny thing--where the apartment was there was one chute on the bottom 
of the hall there's another chute at the bottom by the elevator.
