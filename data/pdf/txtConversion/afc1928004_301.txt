Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1576, by A. J. 
Fist:1BR, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, 
Rattling Boys of Paddy's Land. 
Sung only by DIAMOND and RYA.N. 
YE sons of Erin come listen awhile, 
Till we sing in praise of our Emerald Isle, 
Her St:km; are gentle, brave and strong, 
They can box, fight, dance, or sing a 
song; 
Yes, her sons are gentle, brave, and strong, 
Can box, tight, dance, or sing a 
song, 
For love or friendship, where's the man, 
Like the rattling boys of Paddy's land. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the boys a 
hand can lend 
To beat a 
foe or serve a 
friend, 
For love or friendship, where's the ma: 
Like the rattling boys of Paddy's lancl, 
At a 
race or fair you will find us there, 
Good-humored with our pipe and glass, 
Dressed in our frieze and by our side, 
A 
bonny, blooming, rosy lass; 
Whin the pipes strike up you may be sure. 
Along with our darling we waltz the floor. 
A 
tip-top jig, that, is the one, 
For the rattling boys of Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, ate. 
In eighteen hundred and lifty-four, 
Sure our boys to Russia they sailed o'er, 
With merry hearts they went away, 
For to keep the Russian bear at bays 
There was o,n awful war and d'dreadful fight, 
While crossing o'er the Alma's heights, 
We skinned the bear at Inkermann. 
Then ‘ve gave three cheers for Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc, 
At Inkermann and Balaclava too, 
Sure the shot and shell like hall it flew, 
Although our numbers were but small, 
We dashed among the cannou balls; 
Although our numbers were but small, 
We dashed among the cannon balls, 
With a 
roaritr..; cheer sure in we ran, 
For to knock down the foes of Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, etc. 
Then here's success to Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome hand, 
it's the finest land in all the earth, 
The land that gave poor Pat his birth; 
We have no snakes, toads nor frogs, 
Since St. Patrick banished them from the bogs. 
The soil he blessed with his right hand, 
Then bedad, says he, that's Paddy's land. 
For they are the boys, eto. 
Written by J. 
FOSTER, and sung•with great success, by 
FOSTER & DUDLEY. 
We are two Irish laborers, 
As you can plainly see; 
From Donegal, we came when small, 
Unto Ameriky. 
We got work on the railroad, 
But sure it did'iat pay, 
So we got a 
job to carry the hod, 
At two and-a-half a 
day. 
Cuouns. 
Pat be quick! bring up the brick! 
The mortar too, likewise; 
The push along, and sing a 
song, 
And up the ladder rise; 
I 
always thought ' twos bully fun 
To be a 
mason's clerk, 
And have the man upon the 
Top of the house do all the work. 
When we go back to Ireland, 
That dear old Emerald Isle, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome, 
And is greeted with a 
smile ; 
And if you ever want a 
friend, 
You need'nt try too hard— 
You can always find one 
In the Irish Boys that carry the hod. 
Pat be quick! 
Then here's success to Ireland ! 
The land that gave us birth; 
The pride of every Irish heart. 
And the dearest spot on earth_ 
Let every true born Irishman 
That has his feet well shod, 
Turn out in honor of the 
Lush Boys that carry the hod. 
PA be quick! 3ze. 
PAT.—Now Mollie, dear, just listen here. 
To what I'm going to say. 
11011.yr - If you're going to speak, don't be so long, 
For I 
havnt time to stay. 
PAT. — Arrah : where are you going, Mollie dear ? 
You are my heart's delight. 
I'doLtra.—Now Pat, you know, the sime you said 
To Kitty from Cork, last night. 
Hi, Ho ! sure I'm your Pat— 
Who the divil told you that? 
We're Mollie and Pat, from Ballinifat— 
Old Ireland we never disown ; 
We're as happy a 
pair as ever was seen, 
Although we're far from home. 
PAT.—Now Mollie, dear, don't be so cross, 
If it's only for my sake, 
For you know, if you were to leave me now 
Poor Paddy's heart would break. 
Yfonnre.—Now Pat, you divil, just listen here, 
To what I'm saying to you; 
You know if you court that Kitty from Cork, 
To me you can't be true. 
(Both) 
Ho ! 
PAT. — Now Mollie dear, let's married be. 
Then you will be my wife. 
MOLT Tr. — Well, yes, dear Pat, I 
will consent, 
For you are the joy of my life. 
PAT.—Then all our troubles they will cazsc, 
When you become my bride. 
Mom.—You know, dear Pat, I'm only happy 
When you are by my side. 
Cnours. 
Hi, Ho! sure I'm your P:lt— 
Who the divil told yr)11 that ? 
We're Molly and Pat, from Ballinafat— 
Old Ireland we'll ne-vcr diw7;n.

OR 
"CALL ME THINE OWN." 
music Publisher, W. A. l'oNu A: Co , M7 Broadway, N. Y. 
Call me " thine own," name fond endearing, 
Like music sweet it falls on mine ear ; 
Tells me of hope, life's pathway cheering, 
Whispers of home, with thee ever near ; 
Call me " thine own," doubt would destroy. 
For only thro' faith are we secure ; 
Making our hearts strong to endure 
What lies before us, sorrow or joy. 
( 
all me " thine own", thine, thine alone ; 
Name fond, endearing, call me " thine own.‘. 
Years may roll on, youth's dreams may leave us 
Hopes faint and die that lighted our way 
Trials may come, sorrows may grieve us, 
Friends may depart or falsely betray : 
Call me " thine own," all else may fall. 
With love in our hearts, Heaven still remains 
Each bond, with time fresh vigor gains, 
And o'er life's tempests love shall prevail. 
Call me " thine own," thine, thine alone. 
Name most endearing, call me " thine own."

am— 
Just listen and I 
tell ye, that 
I'm a 
second cousin to Mike 
Muldoon's darling brother Pat! 
I'm a 
candidate for Alderman, 
And I 
think I'll stand a 
show 
Of polling a 
good many votes, 
In the Fourteenth Ward below. 
CHORUS. 
For my name is Patrick O'Connor! 
I'm a 
candidate for Alderman, so gay; 
And I 
hope yell all vote for me, 
Upon next election day. 
Now, if I 
should get elected, 
I'll be bound to have me own way; 
I'll see that the men on the Boulevard 
Get more than 1.60 a 
day! 
Mayor Wickam was going to do great things— 
So Tammany Hall did say; 
But it seems he was never ready 
The Firemen's bill to pay! 
For my name is, erc. 
But I 
must leave ye here, now, 
I'm going to the meeting to-night; 
For I've got to make a 
speech 
Which I 
hope will come out all right. 
Oh! good times are coming, me boys, 
That is, if me ye will elect ; 
Be Herrings! If I 
don't do anything else, 
The workingmen's rights I'll protect! 
For my name is, (te,

SOME folks we find are always down, 
And look as tho' th y'd lost a

Upon their fortune fret and frown, 
And like to keep on grumbling; 
That's not -ny way, I'm ever gay, 
I

"A fig for care," that's what I 
say, 
And what's the use of grumbling?

Yes, what's the use of grumbling? 
What is the use of grumbling? 
What can't he cured, must be endured, 
So what's the use of grumbling ? 
To some dame fortune's very kind, 
When ill deserved sometime we rind 
She's often served n 
e 
most unkind, 
But I 
found it no use grumbling; 
The " cup from lip" she oft can dash. 
A bank one morning went to smash, 
And I 
lost all my hard-earned cash, 
But found it nO use grumbling.

Whilst some have been s) gay an"l glad,

I've lost my cash at “crib" or "Loo," 
I've held a 
lot of I. 0. U. 
But never got my cash when due, 
And found it no use grumbling; 
I've often bet upon a 
race, 
And frequently it's been the case, 
My horse not even got a 
place. 
Of course ' twas no use grumbling. 
The rates and taxes play rare tricks, 
But L's no use kicking against the pricks, 
if I 
did'nt pay they'd seize my sticks, 
And so it's no use grumbling. 
My family numbers near a

And daily I'm expecting more,

She always keeps on grumbling.

MULCAHYE'S GRAND TURNOUT. 
Words by M ASTER EDDY. 
Sung by FOSTER & DUDLE1 
Come all you boys of the Irish team, 
Your attention we do pray ; 
We'd like to hear you all give heed 
To the few words we will say. 
It's of some gallant crack shots, 
Of forty or thereabout, 
On the fifteenai of October 
They make t 
grand turnout. 
CHORUS. 
For we shoulder our guns when the band begins to play 
St. Patrick's Day Parade, or Mulcahey's Gone Away! 
With Ned Harrigan at our side, he let an awful shout, 
Dress up to the right, my boys! in Mulcahey's Grand 
Turnout. 
Our Cap's name is Tony Hart, 
In N. Y. he does dwell; 
Our Sargeant is Ned Harrigan— 
Of course, you know him well. 
They're two of the highest gentlemen 
That pver learned to spout; 
And now they condescend, themselves, 
To make this Grand Turnout. 
For we shoulder, &c. 
The man of whom we sing our song, 
Was born across the say ; 
He took a 
trip in a 
government ship 
For sweet America; 
But the blackguards, all through N. Y., 
Hang him, they would shout; 
And now, to show be's a 
solid man, 
He gives this Grand Turnout. 
For we shoulder, &o. 
COAL HEAVERS, 
Words by M ASTER EDDY. 
Sling by FOSTER & DUDLEY. 
We are laborers in a 
big coal yard, 
And we walk along the street, 
With a 
basket on our shoulder 
And a 
shovel at our feet; 
We work down here in the Scranton, 
With a 
Boss that's awful nice ; 
So if you want your coal heaved in, 
Half a 
dollar is our price. 
CEor.us. 
We walk behind the cart, 
And work until its dark; 
Coal Heavers they are full of pride and joy> 
With their hats upon their head, 
They work 'till they're most dead, 
As they walk along the streets of Williamsbufvb 
Should politicians turn to hod carriers, 
And the world turn upside clown! 
Should Martin Short, the detective, 
Sulteet himself to a 
clown !— 
We'd not give up our noble tread 
For 100 pounds in gold; 
For we're as solid as stone walls— 
At least that's what we're told. 
We walk behind, &c. 
So now we bid you all good-night! 
But hope to call again; 
And when we do, we'll tell to you, 
The goings on at Spain, 
Where laboring men are plenty, 
And politics they are few ; 
But face to face, with the public, 
The advice we give to you— 
ls to walk behind, &c,

Words by M ASTER EDDY. 
Sung by FOSTER & DUDLEY. 
You've heard of politicians, 
With their brooms a 
sweeping streets ; 
And of the well-known policeman, 
As he walks along his beat. 
I 
never work in the Navy Yard, 
Nor do I 
dig the sod ; 
But like a 
decent, honest man, 
For my health, I 
carry the hod. 
CHOE7S. 
Mike McCann, the mason, he will say— 
Scrape the mortar from your hod 
And bring your brick this way : 
Move about when you hear me shout, 
Ten hours every day. when I 
run up 
The ladder with ray hod.] 
There's an Irishman called Patsy Flin, 
Who wanted me to go 
About the streets of New York, 
In the Winter, and shovel snow; 
But before I'd think of such a 
thing 
On the President I'd trod ; 
I'd show him I 
was born and bred 
With my shoulder to the hod. 
Mike Moe= the mason, &c. 
Now boys, if you would like to see 
A 
rough and tumble fight, 
Call ' round to the stable 
Where I 
bum all night; 
You all will see that Mike McCann 
Was raised on Irish sod ; 
Pm going to fight a 
duel 
With the man that stole my hod.

IRISH EMIGRANTS. 
Written and Sung by SCULLY & Mesyna BARRY. 
Oh, kind folks listen to us. 
A. story we will tell 
About dear old Ireland, 
The place we love so well. 
We left there about a 
year ago 
To seek our fortune in the West, 
But if we'd stayed in Ireland 
It would have been best. 
Cuoitus. 
For we are—yes we are— 
Two Irish Emigrants, me boys; 
For we are—yes we are— 
Two Irish Emigrants. 
Ould Ireland is the place 
For frolic or for fun ; 
It is the dearest spot to us 
That's underneath the Sun ; 
But here we are strangers, 
In this big City, so grand ; 
And we won't be contented 
'Till on Irish soil we stand. 
For we aro kc. 
But we are staying here too long, 
We must be away.; 
We hope we pleased ye with our song. 
So we won't stay all day, 
but we will go right home 
And pack up our clothe.] ; 
For we :Ire off to 
Whep the apple praties grows. 
For we are, &c.

guess you'll wonder who I 
am, 
But listen and I'll tell ; 
Wherever I

Tbat I'm a

In a

drive, 
That you must know full well ; 
And you know drinking, that's my style, 
Of this, the Broadway Swell!

Oh, I

The dashing figure of this young swell ; 
If you don't know, the girls will tell, 
That I

'While walking out the other day, 
A 
nice young girl to see, 
I 
met her at the Central Park, 
And she vowed that she loved me; 
I 
guess you'll know her well enough, 
For she's called the Bowery Belle ! 
And I 
am known by all the folks 
As the handsome Broadway Swell! 
Oh, I

I 
must be off, it's getting late, 
For this young Belle to see; 
She said she'd meet me at half- past eight, 
Walking in the Bowery. 
Good-bye, my friends, we'll meet again 
Some other night, and I'll tell 
Of this here dashing, nice young Belle, 
And also of this Broadway Swell! 
Oh, I

THERE COMES A 
TIME. 
By CLAUDE DE HAVEN. 
There comes a 
time when we grow old, 
And like a 
sunset down the sea, 
Slope gradual, and the night wind cold 
Comes whispering, sad and chilling! 
And locks are gray 
As Winter's day, 
And eyes of saddest blue behold 
The leaves all weary drift away, 
And lips of faded coral say, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
There comes a 
time when joyous hearts, 
Which leaped as leaped the laughing main, 
Are dead to all save memory. 
As prisoners in his dungeon chain. 
And dawn of day 
Hath passed away, 
The moon hath into darkness rolled; 
And by the morning, wan and gray. 
I 
hear a 
voice in whisper say, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
There comes a 
time when manhood's prime 
Is shrouded in the mist of yeas, 
And beauty, fading like a 
dream, 
Hath passed away in silent tears; 
And then how dark I 
But oh! the spark 
That kindles youth to hues of gold, 
Still burns with clear and steady ray, 
And fond affections lingering, say, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
There comes a 
time when laughing Spring 
And golden Summer cease to be, 
And we put on the Autumn robe 
To tread the last declivity ; 
But now the slope 
With rosy hope, 
Beyond the sunset we behold— 
Another dawn with fairer light, 
While watchers whisper through the night, 
There comes a 
time when we grow old. 
THL HAPPY IRISH BOYS, 
Written by J. FOSTER, and sung only by FosTrn 
DtruLty. 
Oh! here we are, two Irish Boys, 
Now don't you think we're pretty. 
Straight from Ireland we came. 
And just landed in the city. 
To dance and sing is our delight, 
We keep it up from morn ' till night, 
We're at it always—sober or tight— 
For we are two gay Canalies. 
Crcor.us. 
Tearing away, ( Symph) 
Firing away, (Symph) 
We're at it always—sober or tight 
For we are two gay Canalies. 
Old Ireland is a 
pretty place, 
The girls they are so frisky ; 
And at a 
breakdown or a 
fight, 
We like a 
drop of whiskey. 
And when Old Ireland is set free, 
And we have gained our liberty, 
'Tis then the happy days we'll see, 
For we are two gay Canalies.

"St, Patrick's Day in the Morning:' 
By M ATT. McAnNy. 
Sung by En. SCULLY. 
The noisy streets are supremely green, 
And all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border. 
Ax-rah! I3ut the laud is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world plays 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
F  h 
lad appears all neatly dressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she could'ut resist his snit, bedad, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure, but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey 1 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Divil a 
bit do they care for that, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the lino of the hot equator; 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman them, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
Of " St. Patrick's day in the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you a 
Nyack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning !" 
(AxsarER To " 
You've Been, a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED. Serm.y. 
Ali ! years have come and gone, dear Toni, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
When you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in hand we promised, Toni, 
To each we would be true ; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
CHORUS. 
still a 
friend to you, dear Tom, 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tom, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys; 
But now E'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, Tom, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &c. 
Old friendship often withers, Torn, 
Whene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more; 
But k3ep that honest heart of yours, 
We'll make old friendship new; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &e,

The life of a 
Bummer is the life for me I 
None other so jolly nor half so free ; 
As from rumhole to runthole I 
wend my way. 
Drinking and snoozing. night and day. 
Of greenbacks, ' tis true, I've no great share ; 
But little care I 
for such small ware ! 
When I'm out of stamps ' twere hard to think 
But what some other Bummer would stand a 
drink! 
For breakfast or dinner I 
don't much care; 
Rum is the staple of my fare ; 
Free luncheons suffice me; and ne'er should I 
think 
To waste money on food that would purchase drink! 
I 
once had a 
wife, a 
child, a 
home; 
But I 
left them all the streets to roam ; 
Mother and child are long since dead; 
She broke her heart when he cried for bread I 
But what care I 
for child or wife, 
Compared with the joys of a 
Bummer's life ? 
As from rumhole to rumhole I 
wend my way, 
Drinking and snoozing night and day! 
But an end must come to the Buramer's life, 
When he must follow his child and wife : 
He won't trouble them more, for in Heaven they'll 
dwell, 
When he is a 
howling demon in hell !

Oh, George!

Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer! 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
Pd trust him with any youn r girl, he'd .not harm her. 
When the swallows homeward tly, 
And the stars shine in t

'Twixt the sunset and the dark, 
Georgie meets me in the park. 
For Georgie darling now I 
sigh, 
With his lavender kids and his red neck- tie

Oh George!

Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer ! 
Oh, George! beautiful George! 
I'd trust him with any young girl, he'd not harm her. 
Oh, George!

With his light nut-brown hair and his eyes blue and 4ender, 
Oh, George I beautiful George! 
With his pearl-color'd pants and embroidered suspenders ; 
His flutelike voice so soft and low. 
Straightway to my soul cloth go.

Away from 
• our side Pm down-hearted and lonely. 
At the mask'd ball the other night, 
Ge rgie was the girls' delight; 
The pride and envy of the ball, 
Georgie won the hearts of all. 
With his swan-like neck, and his soft white hands, 
And his melting glances, thus he stands. 
Chorus—Oh, George, St,c. 
Spoken after chorus to 3d verse—Georgie was a 
remarkably 
pretty child, so his ma says. 
She used to dress his hair in 
long " silken curls" down his back. " Why, what a 
pretty 
girl!" strangers would remark. " That's not a 
girl." his ma 
would say, ' • he's a boy !" " Indeed, arid what's his name?" 
"Georgie"," she would reply; awl then they would say "Oh, 
pretty Georgie !" and that used to Wease his ma so much. Shs 
says, " he's so handy around the house." 
Why ! le often puts 
on his ma's nice white apron and helps her make pies; and lie 
can do " fancy needlework" just, as well as any girl. 
His ma 
says he's too pretty for a 
boy, he ought to have been a 
girl. 
His ma calls him " pretty Georgie." I 
call him " Georgie dear." 
We had a private theatrical entertainment up at, our house 
the other evening. We played " The Lady of Lyons." I 
plr4yed 
" 
Claude," and Georgie played " Pauline," and lie did look so 
sweet in his " long white satin trail" and a " blushing rose" 
on his breast. 
He acted like a " queen." and looked every 
inch a " young bride:" and in the " Cottage Scene" he sighed 
and made love to the "Prince" just like a •` real girl!" His ma 
called him " Georgiana" all the evening. 
And now, some-
times when we have a 
little " love spat," I 
call him " Georgi -
ana," sometimes I 
call him " sister ;" but the dear boy doesn't 
get angry at it. 
He's such a " sweet fellow," he merely looks 
at me with those " languishing eyes" and playfully exclaims, 
"Oh! you giddy girl, if yen sty that again I 
shall strike you 
real hard " Which f 
rces me to exclaim, 
Oh, George! beautiful George! 
Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer! 
Oh, Ge )rge! beautiful George! 
I'd trust him with any young girl, he'd not harm her! 
(Yew Version.) 
As Sung by COTTON & BIRDU-
E. 
In the papers have you read, 
Have you noticed what they said, 
That no Irish people need apply 
To earn their daily bread? 
'Twill plainly show to you 
The course you should pursue ; 
And in honesty I'll show you 
What you really ought to do. 
.CHORUS. 
On this you may rely: 
You will find out by-an-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny Isle 
Are welcome to apply. 
Just note the Irish girl. 
As she's skipping to the well 
With blossoms blooming on her cheek 
Like roses in the dell— 
She is so bright and fair, 
With her jet black eyes and hair— 
Show me your English lady, 
Who a 
brighter name can bear! 
CHORUS. 
Never let me hear that cry, 
As I 
heard in days gone by; 
That cruel, cold, unpleasing one— 
No Irish need apply! 
On the plains of Waterloo, 
Where the bullets like hailstones flew, 
There was the Duke of Wellington, 
Bad luck to him! what did he do ? 
He beat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of lqurels, 
Tliengh the Irish won their part. 
CHORUS. 
Paugh-a-ballah ! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-an-by. 
(Repeat.) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a 
bite or sup 
Wherever there you go ; 
So don't treat them with disdain 
But show each man the same 
Let all apply, that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come ! 
CHORUS. 
Then rise them as you should— 
For, ' tis fit we all do good, 
And never crush an Irishman, 
But rise him as you should!

I'm a 
Paddy Whack just landed from the sea ! 
And from swate old IrAand all the way I've come ; 
When I 
left, my darling mother says to me : 
"Don't forget the little cabin here at home !" 
For the purty girl I 
had to leave behind, 
When the big ship saiL.d away I 
dropt a 
tear ; 
But in politics I've just made up my mind, 
And I'm bound to be an Alderman next year! 
Cu-onus. 
I'm a

And me mother was before me, so she was! she was! 
0, I

I'm a 
Paddy Whack just landed, so I

0, the good old times at home I 
can't forget, 
And the dancing and the whiskey punch galore, ! 
Thick as bees. the lively girls and boys we met, 
And we jigged it ' till we battered down the floor! 
Then we had a 
fight :
IC course, you know, for fun! 
'Cause we lov'et each other vary fond and dear; 
So, I'll keep my old Shelallh, boys, for one, 
For at ' Primaries" I'll have to use it here !

For they said that all the streets were paved wid gold; 
Then meself and duds upon the shore they dumpt! 
And the little boys they laughed at me I'm told 
But I've wrote home to me brother, do ye see, 
And its toilin' there he is like any turk !— 
" 
Come and lift the hod, I 
says to him, like me,— 
.Sure, the Chap upon the wall does all the work !" 
I'm a

So hurra for the stars and stripes, 
And the land where we never see for, 
If I

And made me an American citizen. 
So hurra, 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo. 
He tould me his name it was Hobbes, 
lie sold me a 
pass for Chicago, 
Be me sowl it was-the old jack of clubs, 
But I 
musn't indulge in reflections, 
For what I 
have said ain't worth note. 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election. 
So step up me heroes and vote. 
So hurra, Sul

The Commissioners axed me if I'd go

No, sez I, C

The harvest time is coming

While Biddy wept and sigh'd,

For Heaven's sake, wipe off your chin !

Say, Mister ! Go wipe off your chin! 
There's a

Take my advice, go get ten cents. 
So a

Why Don't You Carry a 
Hod? 
Written by Burr. WarisrE, and Dedicated to all Irish 
Singers. 
Ant.—" Sally Bless My Soul." 
I 
should like to know the reason why, 
Who gave my girl a 
big black eye! 
She blinks and squints, begins to cry 
Whenever I 
pass her by. 
I 
met her again this afternoon, 
While walking down Broadway. 
Her face looked like a 
sick Babboon! 
Now this is what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You're too fresh, please take a 
walk 
You're no better than a 
fraud. 
She said N. G., tra-la-lee! 
Why don't you carry the hod? 
She throws on style, with her pull-back dress, 
Gives me conundrums for to guess! 
Her love for me she don't confess, 
Which leaves me in distress. 
She said I 
was a 
happy man, 
A 
second Buffalo Bill I 
Go get a 
rope and try your strength 
To pull a 
cow up hill ! 
CHORUS. 
She said if she was in my place, 
She'd go back to the onld sod; 
Take a 
walk, you dissie gawk, 
Why don't you carry a 
hod? 
If she ever speaks to me at all, 
I'll pull off her Dutch water-fall ! 
I 
don't give a 
d  
how loud she bawls! 
Or if a 
Cop she calls. 
Go throw yourself off the City Hall— 
Tie yourself to a 
log. 
Then she said, go soak your head; - 
Lend me your face ' till I 
skeer a 
dog! 
Cnonrs. 
Now was'nt it mean for her to say 
That I 
was a 
Cod! 
Get out, you sliver—over the river, 
Why don't you carry a 
hod?

Down in the meadow, by the brook, where first I 
met my 
love, 
I 
told her there that I'd be true " as the shining stars 
above." 
Oh ! she's so fair, I 
do declare, she's beautiful, divine," 
The dearest girl and charmer, is Beautiful Caroline !

She's like a 
little twinkling star. [ Symph.] 
She's so near and yet so far, [ Symph.] 
The dearest girl and charmer fair, 
And all the world beside, 
Is Caroline. this girl of mine— 
She soon will be my bride. 
We sat beneath a 
willow tree, to watch the running stream, 
Sh -
e 
whispered tales of love to me, it seem'd as in a 
dream : 
Oh ! the sweet birds sang there evening song, which echo'd 
through the vine--
Each hour seem'd a 
lite long dream, with Beautiful Caro-
line ! 
Chorus as before. 
We sat there 'till the twilight fell, the moon shone bright 
and clear ; 
Come, dearest, let's be off for home, she whispered in my 
ear. 
I 
saw her home and at the gate, the clock then just struck 
nine--
Of what she said, I 
think I'll wed, my Beautiful Caroline!

WHEN darkness barbaric plunged Europe in night, 
One spot still remained where truth's day-star shone bright; 
'Twas a 
land whose mere name is like music to me, 
That dear ocean Eden, old Erin Mac'hree! 
Alas for her trust in the stranger who came. 
A 
friend in pretence, a 
despoiler in aim; 
Let the past be the past, yet our motto must be, 
Her old place among nations to Erin Machree! 
Cnours, 
Alas for her trust in the stranger who came, 
A 
friend in pretence, a 
despoiler in aim: 
Let the past be the past, yet our motto m-st be. 
Her old place among nations to Erin Machree! 
The land of bright spirits, so gallant and gay, 
Of sympathies warm as the sunshine of day; 
For his generous ways Pat has always a 
plea 
In " Cead Mifle Falthe" of Erin Machree! 
Till: of Venus just sprung from the bright ocean foam, 
could show you ten thousand such charmers at home 
'Along the white bosom'd maids, all so modest, yet free, 
Who bloom, thick as flowr's in old Erin Machreel 
Chorus—Alas, .tc. 
If you wish for bright scenes, there's a 
choice of them there, 
If for legends unmatch'd, she has plenty to spare; 
Would you like to make love to some surfing Banshee 
You must just make your home in old Erin Machree! 
Would you find the true Lethe of every ill, 
You must taste her " potteen" just fresh from the hill. 
Would you smother a 
grief, or get crazy with glee, 
All you want is the music of Erin Machree 
Cherna—Ala, 4.tc,

GOOD evening to ye all, 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of my victory 
Upon election day. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And Murphy was the man 
Who tried hard to d 
feat me, 
But he gave himself away; 
He never tried repeatin', 
And that's the way I 
be it him— 
I 
voted seven times myself 
In the ould Fourth Ward so gay, 
CHORUS. 
*Now Pm a 
politician, 
I 
hom a 
high position, 
I 
gained by repetition, 
Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free- lunch could be found, 
And roany's the plate of soup, my boys, 
Did they put out of sight; 
We swept the district clean. 
And the.divil such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night. 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned, 
When the victory it was earned, 
It gave me satisfaction and 
tilled me with delight. 
• 
Now I'm a 
politician, &A. 
And now MI tell to you 
What I 
am going to do; 
I'll not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true; 
They shall have eight hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay, 
And live as ‘vell as those big bugs 
Upon Fifth Avenue; 
Sure I'll improve the city, 
For I 
think it is a ity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
CHORTJR. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary, 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do.
