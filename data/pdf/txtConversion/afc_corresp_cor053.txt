[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
May 13, 1940]
May 13, 1940
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor WPA Writers' Project of Florida 49 West Duval
Street Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
I have heard indirectly that you will wish an extension on the loan of the recording
machine. I see no objection to this but can you let us know when you may be through
with it. The North Carolina project wishes the loan of the machine on August 1 and I was
wondering if the one in your possession would be available at that time.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
