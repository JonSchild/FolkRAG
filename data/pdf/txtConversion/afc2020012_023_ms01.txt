[0:00] LK: Hello. Thank you so much for taking part in these oral histories for the Library of Congress. 
Can I ask you to introduce yourself? 
  
SB: Certainly, and thank you. I'm Salena Wright-Brown. I'm the Associate Director for Patient Care 
services at the Central Arkansas Veterans Health Care System in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
  
LK: Thank you very much. Can we begin with your family background and education history? 
  
SB: Certainly. I was actually born in northwest Arkansas. Have been a Arkansan most of my life except 
for a couple of detours to Odessa, Texas and then later to Jackson, Mississippi, but managed to come 
back home to Arkansas. I was born in a very small town in northwest Arkansas, about 300 people when 
I was born, and a good number of 'em were my family, relatives, cousins, and so on. My mother came 
from a very big family. My father moved to northwest Arkansas when he was younger, less than 10, 
from Kansas, and his family had moved from Kansas to northwest Arkansas. One of three siblings. Was 
actually born in Rogers, Arkansas at the hospital that I later went to my first job as a nurse at. In terms of 
education, that's a little bit of an interesting twist. I, out of high school, went to Odessa, Texas chasing 
the oil fields, and had done some work, different things, while I was in high school, worked for a 
lawyer's office, worked, actually, for the hospital as a telephone operator back in the day when there 
really was the switchboard, and then went to Odessa, Texas and hit it about the time that it was on a 
decline, that the oil business was declining. So, I had to go to work, and went to work at a nursing home 
in Odessa, Texas. I might pause to say Odessa, Texas is about as different from the Ozark Mountains of 
northwest Arkansas as you can get, but I was really happy. I met a great lady who became a lifelong 
friend at the nursing home. The care was magnificent. I never had more than three or four patients as a 
nursing assistant. People had just the most marvelous care. The oil business wasn't gonna get any better, 
and so I decided I'd come back home to northwest Arkansas and moved back. Immediately went to work 
in a nursing home just almost right after it and expected the same experience. It was not the same 
experience. The care was vastly different. I was naive enough to think that the model I had seen in 
Odessa, Texas was the same everywhere. What I didn't realize at that time was I was working in a 
private pay nursing home. I did not understand in my very young years what the difference in that was 
than in a nursing home in general. So, I lasted maybe a day, and I immediately took myself down to the 
community college to start pre-nursing classes, because I knew it wasn't a situation that I was going to 
be able to change without getting a degree. I will also say that I was never supposed to be a nurse, never 
intended to be a nurse. I was gonna be a lawyer. My father said I started talking at nine months old and I 
never stopped [chuckles]. Worked for a lawyer, dear friend of ours, when I was in high school and then 
kind of thought I was on that path but took a turn, got my prerequisites for nursing school and went to 
get my first degree at North Arkansas Community College in Harrison, Arkansas. Came back and went 
to work at the hospital that I was born in. Started on night shift, opened a brand new unit that was a post-
op recovery unit, half post-op recovery and half rehab, but I knew that's not where I wanted to be. 
Wanted to be in the emergency department. Well, as a student nurse, I frequently got drawn down to the 
emergency department and I loved the puzzle and the challenges of how to triage, how to organize care, 
how to be there at sometimes people's worst minutes, and how to help in those situations. I also liked the 
fact that you knew immediately what was gonna happen. They were gonna get better, they were gonna 
go home, they were gonna be admitted, or they were gonna have a different kind of discharge. I liked 
that, and so I was very attracted to it. At the time, they weren't hiring new grads into the emergency 
department, so I really needed to have some med surg under my belt. So, I went to work and did just 
about a year of med surg and learned tons. I'm so glad I did it. But in a neighboring hospital, they had an

emergency department opening and went back to the emergency department-- or, went to the emergency 
department at that hospital. I will tell you that when I started in the emergency department, worked night 
shift, 6P to 6A, one of two RNs working the night shift and no doctor on station. So, that didn't last very 
long. It was probably two years later, a year and a half later, that they did start having full-time doctors 
in the hospital. Probably dating myself a little bit there but-- I worked as an emergency department nurse 
for about a year or so before I became the manager in that department. Still a very young nurse, but 
enjoyed the challenge, enjoyed the organization, enjoyed the leadership. During that time period, also 
went back. I was able to become certified. I went to the Trauma Nurse Core Course, became an 
instructor, became an ACLS instructor, all along gaining formal and informal knowledge, but really 
evident that I wanted and needed to go back to school. At that point, still had an associate's degree, went 
back to school to a bachelor's to master's program through the University of Arkansas. Got my 
bachelor's degree and then my Master's as a Clinical Nurse Specialist. During the time I was doing that 
study, I also got a offer to work part time during my off-clinical times at the VA hospital in Fayetteville. 
During the summer, I worked there doing education development for them, and when I got out of 
school, they hired me almost immediately. I became an advanced practice nurse, clinical nurse 
specialist, in the emergency department half-time and half-time led the clinical support section, which 
was a group of staff, nurse educators and informatics specialists and those type of people that really 
were put together in a clinical support group. Went along for a number of years in that practice and then 
decided, with a lot of pressure from a lady that informally became a dear encourager and she called 
herself my second mother. My mother called her my second mother, but just was a tremendous, great 
supporter, and with her encouragement and nearly insistence, went back to doctoral school and chose to 
go to Duquesne University and finished my PhD in Nursing at Duquesne a few years ago. That's kinda 
my educational, a little bit of my employment history mixed in there. 
  
B: What made working for the VA appealing to you? 
  
[9:07] SB: Having been in northwest Arkansas all my life, I was very familiar with the VA hospital. 
Was not my husband at the time, but eventually became my husband, was a veteran and got his care 
there, but I'd never really been inside the walls until I went to school and started working, started doing 
some clinical there and then subsequently working there. What I equated with this grand old campus, 
you look at the outside of it and it's almost like, that's old, outdated care inside those walls. I got inside 
and found it's anything but that, that the VA has been a leader in so many things, and even the 
development of the first electronic health records and that they had a role in the CT scanning 
development. When you start looking at prosthetics and so many different avenues that the VA has led, 
and has always, in my experience, been willing to take on even more innovation, leadership and 
improving the health of veterans, and subsequently, others who can learn from the care that we're 
providing to veterans, I was hooked. The other thing that I realized early on in my career in the VA is 
there is nowhere in health care with a nobler mission, and there's nowhere in health care where you walk 
amongst heroes, our nation's heroes, every day. I met the most incredible veterans and worked with 
people that are so dedicated to veterans that there truly is no greater mission than to pay back that debt 
that those men and women signed for me, Salena Wright-Brown. They put on that uniform for me and 
my family, and to be able to pay just a little bit back to them is incredible every day. 
  
LK: That's amazing. That sounds incredible. Did your parents work?

SB: Well, my mother worked very, very hard all her life, taking care of family and raising kids and 
taking care of her brothers and sisters. She'd never worked outside the home formally, although she and 
my father, later in life, had a contracting business and she did the bookkeeping for that and some of the 
coordination for that. My dad, early on, went to work for Daisy Manufacturing Company, which was 
situated in Rogers, Arkansas, and worked for them for, I guess, nearly 30 years and retired very young 
and started his own construction company and did that until he retired just a few years before he passed 
as well. My dad was an incredible community leader. The first place I ever went was to the First Baptist 
Church in Lowell as an infant. The story of our families is very intertwined with the history of the First 
Baptist Church in Lowell, which is a little bit off in the nursing subject, but it really does ground where I 
have come in my faith and in my life. My parents, actually, my grandparents ran a truck stop in Rogers, 
Arkansas for years, many, many years ago. Back in the day, the truck stop really wasn't just kinda what 
we see and think about today, but it was a place where people went for Sunday dinner. There wasn't very 
many sit-down restaurants at that time. So, my father and his brother were two very handsome teenage 
boys with a truckstop business and lots of food and very popular. In the next town, just a few miles 
down the road, was this First Baptist Church, where the pastor came in nearly every week and brought 
his family in and was friends with my grandfather and so on. My uncle, who I never met, was killed in a 
car wreck, and very, very tragic and was killed young, a young man, and the pastor at that church came 
and asked if he could preach my uncle's funeral. I've heard the story all my life. In fact, it was told at my 
father's funeral not too long ago as well. My grandfather said, "Yes,"-- not really being associated with 
the church at the time, and said, "Yes." The next week, my father and his then girlfriend, my mother, 
went to church there for the first time, and they really never stopped going. Dad became a deacon, he 
became a lay minister, he was a Gideon, very ingrained in the church. In fact, that same preacher that 
preached my uncle's funeral actually baptized my mother and father together, mom standing in front of 
dad, baptized them together in that church, and they were members there from that point on until before 
I was born until they passed. That has become a cornerstone in my life is having that association with 
the First Baptist Church and the family and friends have been lifelong for me. 
  
LK: May I ask how long you've been a nurse? 
  
SB: 30, 32 years. 
  
B: Do you remember going to the doctor as a young child? 
  
SB: A little bit, vaguely. There was a small group of doctors, had been the cornerstone in that town, and 
one of them delivered me. Interestingly enough, I was working at the desk-- I wasn't a nurse at the time. 
That's back when I was in high school. I was working at the desk answering phones when he died in the 
ER, the same hospital that I was born in. So, that was quite a connection. 
  
LK: Could you tell us where you work now? 
  
[16:46] SB: I work at Central Arkansas VA. If I can, I'd like to just share maybe a couple of things if 
that's okay. As I was thinking about this interview, being a nurse has opened up so many doors for me. I 
was able to be a clinician and love that time with veterans and with patients, both as a registered nurse 
and then later as an advanced practice nurse. Absolutely adored the clinician role, but it also gave me the 
opportunity to be in management or administration. I also very much enjoyed growing as a manager and 
being able to see the impact as a leader that you can have with other nurses who then multiply those

efforts as they touch patients, as they interact with veterans. To be able to spread that and encourage 
them is so rewarding. To be able to encourage ideas and innovation and just to create that network for 
them to do their best was almost like a force multiplier. I loved that idea, and I've loved being able to be 
a nurse manager and then later as Clinical Specialists lead for the VA, and then, quite by a stroke of 
coincidences, became an Acting Associate Director for Patient Care Services, which is like the Chief 
Nurse or nurse exec., and then have been able to do that in a couple of different places. The clinician, the 
administrator, and I've had an opportunity to be a researcher, which I very much love. My research for 
my PhD program was in nurses injured by violence while on duty in an emergency department. Talked 
to incredible nurses who had had huge challenges with their work, and hopefully then was able to create 
a literature that may be able to help people who are studying in those areas and who are trying to 
improve things in those areas. I'm also just in the process of completing another research on the effect of 
a mindful interlude at shift change, especially measuring salivary cortisols before and after, and then at 
length for those to have a biological marker, if you will, beyond just that of a questionnaire or a survey. 
We've been a little bit delayed because of that pandemic with finishing that study, but that has been very 
interesting to be able to do that as well. Then, I've been able to teach. I spent many years teaching for the 
North Arkansas Community College in Bentonville, Arkansas, taught medical law and ethics and taught 
medical terminology. Loved it. I so much enjoyed that as kind of a secondary job, which I think nursing 
allows us to do a lot of things, primary jobs and secondary jobs and sometimes third and fourth jobs. I 
also spent several years doing clinical instruction at the University of Arkansas, and have been able to 
write some virtual sessions for University of Florida. I've had a great opportunity to do that. Also had an 
opportunity to work with the development of programs. In the emergency department, I became 
interested in how we treat victims of sexual assault. It always bothered me because the room where we 
would do the exams was in the very middle of the emergency room, so there's a lot of traffic, a lot of 
noise, a lot of activity, was not therapeutic, but it was the room that was better equipped for that type of 
exams. Well, I heard about something, and this is many years ago, called the Sexual Assault Nurse 
Examiners Program, and I started digging into that. It really wasn't in Arkansas at all at the time, but 
there was a very active program in Texas. As I was studying that, I got connected with a nurse who was 
working at Children's Hospital in Little Rock who was also interested. Together, she and I wrote a grant 
and got five years of funding in the state of Arkansas to put on Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Training 
Programs, and as a result of being able to do that, we spread that training throughout Arkansas and have 
several sexual assault centers that have been set up across the state. To be able to be part of that, if I 
hadn't had that nursing connection, I'm not sure that that would have occurred. To be able to be part of 
that, and then as a result of that, I realized that sexual assault, while I really enjoyed the being there for 
the victims, that wasn't what I was drawn to as a career. But, I was fascinated by the death exam portion 
of that training. So, as I'm thinking about that a little bit, I called up the local coroner's office and said, 
"Hey, what's it take to be a deputy coroner?" and he said, "Well, what do you do now?" and I said, 
"Well, I'm a nurse." He said, "Come on down. Let's sign ya up," and within a week, I was training as a 
deputy coroner, which I did as a secondary job. They were so good to me. I think I was probably about 
19 years takin' call for them, and they let me do it when I was able, and until I moved to Jackson, 
Mississippi and I couldn't do it anymore. At the time, I so much enjoyed being able to be there, again, 
people's worst times, family's worst times, but being able to be there during that and the challenge of 
that. I did deputy coroner as a secondary job, which was linked directly into my nursing. The other thing 
that came of that is, again, this pursuit of wanting to know more and kind of reach as high as I could 
with the understanding and the knowledge of those areas. I went to a certification program and was 
issued from Bethel College a certification in forensic science after several weeks of study and clinical 
exams and things there, and then as part of my doctoral program, I chose Duquesne because they had a 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

forensic science program, and I also got a second post-master's certification in forensic nursing from 
them. It's very much become a love of mine, not only nursing, emergency department nursing and then 
subsequently forensic nursing. The clinical, the research aspects, being able to be an educator and a 
manager and administrator are all tied to the possibilities just being a nurse brings you, the doors that 
open. 
  
B: Yeah, I think that's a common theme that we've heard in our interviews is how much that you can do 
in the nursing profession and with a nursing degree. I'm curious, specifically, if you wouldn't mind 
answering, how the work you did, I guess it would have been for your first PhD with assault on nurses 
while they're working and then with sexual assaults and with exams afterwards, and with that, how that 
may have influenced your work, if at all, with the VA. 
  
[25:49] SB: I guess I'll start with the reason I became interested in that certainly was from my history of 
working in the emergency department and, unfortunately, witnessing several of my staff injured while 
on duty and myself threatened to be injured. I was not ever touched, but I saw staff that were hurt by 
patients, by family members. Almost without a exception, there were no charges ever brought against 
the people that caused the injury, and so, to me, that was an injustice that just needed to be addressed. It 
kind of went with me through my career until I got to my PhD program, and I always knew I wanted to 
do something that had value with preventing violence against nurses. I don't know that that has a direct 
connection with the VA. I think that started from my emergency department, but as I went to the VA, it 
was certainly reinforced, because I started my career working as an advanced practice nurse in the 
emergency department in the VA. I saw some of the same things, although a little bit different because 
the VA had police officers, armed police officers, on duty who stayed close to the emergency 
department. That's not true in community hospitals. That was probably the biggest influence with that 
area of my study. Again, like I said, the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner really was born of wanting to 
do better, thorough trained exams while supporting the emotional welfare of sexual assault victims. I 
just was so fortunate to hear of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program and then to be connected 
with an incredible nurse in Little Rock that we, together, were able to work that program forward from a 
grant perspective. I think when the opportunity came in my PhD program to really direct my research, 
that was just a given. That's the area I wanted to go to.  
 
LK: Wow. Could you describe your job a bit more right now? Do you work inpatient or outpatient?  
 
[28:45] SB: Both [sighs]. Central Arkansas, I am the Associate Director for Patient Care Services, and in 
the VA system, that is equivalent, maybe, to the Chief Nursing Officer or the nurse exec. In every 
position and in the VA hospitals for this level of position that I'm in, is structured just a little bit 
different. My role is I am responsible for nursing practice wherever it occurs throughout the facility. 
We've got about 3,300 employees, a little bit over 1,000 nurses. We are a two campus major complexity, 
the highest level of complexity in the VA. We are a two campus facility with eight other sites of care. 
We have two major acute care hospitals. One is acute mental health, but it also has our nursing homes, 
which we call Community Living Centers, and a major outpatient primary care, some of our specialty 
clinics, our dental clinics, just a large presence. Across the Arkansas River is our acute care medical 
surgical hospital that has your typical, what you might think of as, med surg beds, ICUs. Currently we've 
got three pandemic COVID units open, and they would do your typical specialty care, surgery, med 
surg. We've got audiology, eye clinics. The VA is close to a full service as you can get with the 
pharmacy on station. I'm responsible for the nursing practice, whether they administratively report to me 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
 
 
 
2020012

or not, throughout the organization. I'm also responsible for a good number of nursing units, 
administratively, and I'm also responsible for environmental management service, the chaplains, the 
social workers, the nutrition service, which, interesting fact, we serve about 2,500 meals a day through 
there. Also responsible for a section that I've created called Patient-Centered Care and Cultural 
Transformation. Within that section, I have my innovation specialist, health promotion, disease 
prevention specialists, patient advocates. There's several things like that in there, and the Whole Health 
program is in there. We are currently a Whole Health flagship and I'm the senior champion for that. 
There's 18 Whole Health flagships in the VA and we are one of them. What that means is we are really 
pushing the integration of complementary, or some people call it alternative therapies, but a truly 
holistic approach to health care that moves apart from your traditional medicine solo practice and 
incorporates traditional medicine with anything you can think of. We've done battlefield acupuncture for 
years. I have nurses trained in it. We've hired massage therapists. We have yoga, tai chi. We have 
several nutritionists who do healthy cooking kitchens. Something most people don't do, we put massage 
chairs in our waiting areas. We've got a very active Whole Health program. The role of that flagship is 
to lead other hospitals in their Whole Health journey as well. And innovation, I will tell you, I was 
privileged to be one of the senior champions for innovation in the VA when I was in Jackson, 
Mississippi, and when I came to Little Rock, one of the things I did before I accepted the job was talk to 
the director and say, "Would you support us becoming an innovation partner, because that's important to 
me?" and she said, "Well, certainly." As soon as I got here, applied to become an innovation site, was 
selected as an innovation partner site, and that has been some of the most incredible things that we have 
done is to be innovators in health care. In fact, I just finished a founders program. It's similar to a 
national TV program where you bid on innovations. So, we bid on innovations. Now, you're not bidding 
money. You're bidding support and testing and so on, but we've won four different innovative proposals 
from different organizations and so, very excited to do that. We also have developed a 3-D printer lab, 
and working with our veterans-- I will just give you an example. This is why it pumps me up so much. 
The veterans were talking about one of the things that they needed, and one said, "Well, you know what 
I need is a urinal with a longer handle." This is a gentleman who's in a wheelchair, but he has a pretty 
large abdominal girth and he couldn't place his own urinal. Now, you don't get much more basic than 
that. He said, "I have to wait on somebody. I have to wait on somebody to come and put my urinal, and 
if I try to do it, I'm always spilling it." Working with him and a few other veterans, one of my innovation 
specialists took him into the 3-D printer lab and made a prototype of what the veterans then named the 
John Juan. It is a extension handle for a urinal, and it allows them to place their own urinal and to 
control it. I went to see this veteran. I said, "Man, that was such an amazing idea," and he grabbed me by 
the wrist and he said, "It was, but you know what's more important? It gave me my dignity back." Even 
saying that now, I can just-- it's just like hairs stand up because it just means so much. To be able to do 
that for somebody who served our country and has had challenges with his health and is in a wheelchair, 
and to be able to do that much little thing that makes a difference was amazing. We had some problems 
with getting it designed exactly right where it would be useful for everybody, 'cause this one was 
designed for him but it didn't work for everybody. We ran into a veteran who just came to one of our 
pop-up innovations. He said, "You know what? I do 3-D printing for children's prosthetic devices. Let 
me help you with that," and he showed us - this is another veteran now in our pop-up lab - showed us 
how to change these and alter 'em to where there's a ability to customize it for different veterans' reach 
and need. I don't know of any other place I could have those kinds of experiences or be part of that kind 
of care. We also had a nurse that - and this is in production right now - we had a nurse that created a-- I 
call it the Come Along. I don't know what he calls it, something different, but what he saw was nurses 
were trying to go down the hall holding an IV pole and pushing a bed. He said, "There's gotta be a better 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

9 
 
way." He worked with a engineer at a VA up north who made a prototype device that hooks the bed to 
the IV pole and allows the IV pole to swing so that the nurse can hold onto the bed and the patient and 
not try to have to move both of them. Works with a bed or a wheelchair. It's been in design for a long 
time, but that comes from being part of that innovative spirit and being at a VA that's within a huge VA 
organization that is so proactive and ready to take on any opportunity to improve the care we give 
veterans. 
  
B: Well, along that line, how would you describe your patients, and what are some typical injuries and 
issues that you're helping and working with them to treat and deal with? 
  
[38:06] SB: Well [sighs], our patients run the gamut from very young veterans who maybe have been 
injured or maybe have developed a chronic issue while they were serving to truly America's greatest 
generation, which we don't have as many left of our World War II veterans now, but some still. Probably 
our largest in terms of numbers of veterans, and we have just around 700,000 veterans, so our largest 
number that we serve right now is our Vietnam era vet. Many of them as they're aging have chronic 
conditions. They have service-connected conditions from where they served or what they might have 
been exposed to. We have a good number of veterans that are still working with mental health issues, 
and so we have vibrant mental health programs to try to support them at the time they need it where they 
need it. In terms of typical injuries, we have some people that have had injuries. We have a good number 
of people with acute long-term diabetes or kidney disease or the typical things that an aging population 
might have. The services we're able to provide are pretty comprehensive and we're proud to be able to 
do that. 
  
LK: Can you describe maybe a typical patient interaction in your unit? 
  
SB: Well, I don't see patients [unintelligible] right now, but I visit with them. In non-pandemic days, I 
probably spent a lot more time in one-to-one interactions with veterans than I can right now, although I 
still do make some rounds. I visit waiting rooms, and typically, by the time it gets to my senior level, if 
it's a particular issue, it's one of those challenging issues that we've got to address, and that might be a 
need from a system, or it might be a need that a family has. We have a family that showed up here after 
a hurricane affected the VA that they're at, affected their home area, showed up here. I was able to help 
support efforts for them to get housing. It's those kinds of things that I deal with now. When I made 
rounds a lot, most of the time it was very simple things. If there was a need, it was very simple things 
that could be handled. More times than not, it was veterans telling me how good they were being taken 
care of in the VA, or telling jokes, or telling stories about what was going on in their lives, not 
necessarily in their service, but what was going on in their lives. It's a wonderful population to deal with. 
I do, however, miss the clinical care. I miss being an advanced practice nurse. I don't do that as actively 
as I'd like to now, but it's kind of the trade off from being a manager, administrator. 
  
B: In your current position, what would you say is the hardest part of your job and what is the most 
rewarding part of your job? 
  
SB: The hardest part of my job? I think right now, the hardest part of my job is I've had to learn how to 
connect with staff in a pandemic. One of the things I liked to do previous to the pandemic was I did 
listening sessions, small group listening sessions on the units, and I went all over, met with the night 
shift, just sat in the room, and it was truly them talking to me. It was listening sessions; I didn't come

with an agenda. Typically, I might have an announcement or two, but I didn't come with an agenda, and 
it was whatever they wanted to talk about. With a place this large, I was doing a lot of listening sessions. 
Pandemic kind of put an end to that, and virtually is not quite the same, although people are warming up 
to that now. I think the hardest part is truly trying to be there, know what the staff needs, be able to have 
those lines of communication that then can have really good effective feedback, and so that's been 
challenging. I think that truly knowing and being able to support the staff during a pandemic has been 
the hardest part of my job right now. The most rewarding is probably some the same as knowing that the 
staff are there at the bedside and taking care of veterans, to be able to find their needs and quickly fix 
them, or to be able to be there when they have a need. If I can support the person who's closest to the 
patient, if I can make the day better for them, if I can make the shift better, if I can help them be thinking 
even futuristic on how they can impact the future through innovation or Whole Health or some of our 
chaplain programs, anything, to me, that's the most rewarding is making those connections so that we 
can knock down any barriers they have to do and what they-- best quality care they can give to the 
veteran. 
  
LK: Do you have right now a weekly or daily work schedule? And if so, what would you say it's like? I 
know it's kind of difficult during a pandemic. 
  
[45:14] SB: Well, I do have a few things. I have a huddle with my office staff and my deputies every 
morning. We do 15 minutes, no more than that, because 8:15 I go into a morning meeting. We do 
hospital-wide morning meeting, and we hear a report from the night before. We hear any issues, any 
challenges, any problems that people might have, anything that needs follow up, and then just kind of 
that daily status check. Then, we didn't typically do this, but now that we're in a pandemic we've been 
doing this, right after that, we have a nine o'clock surg meeting. What that is is checking logistics, 
supply, staff, personnel, what's our status for inpatient COVID, how many staff are out, COVID-related 
issues, all of that information to just quickly share with a wide group to make sure that we're ready for 
whatever surge is happening or whatever the current status is. Fom then, the day is kind of varied. We 
do have regional meetings, I have meetings with various of my service groups, address anything that 
may come up, also looking strategically at how we plan moving forward through either systems redesign 
or innovations, or I also have the education department, so I'm constantly working with them on new 
programs and new development programs. For example, one of 'em I'm very proud of as a nurse leader, 
mentor program, and our region, our VISN, the Veterans Integrated Service Network, developed this 
program and it's very active at my facility. It's a formalized curriculum for new nurse leaders that they 
work through with a mentor. Each month, we have a little bit of an introduction, then they go and meet 
with their mentors, work through their issues. They can meet all through the month as well, but this is 
the time we all come together to address any issues to support those new nurse leaders, 'cause those are 
very challenging roles to be a new nurse manager or a new nurse leader. I work with the Education 
Department on that, and so often I meet with some of those groups. I have mentees of my own I meet 
with. We do the typical budget and resource management and planning and strategic management, and 
so we're working through all those types of meetings and challenges and opportunities for improvement. 
  
B: Since we're kind of on the topic, can we talk about the pandemic a little bit more broadly? 
  
SB: Yeah [sighs]. I guess you want something more than, "I hate it and I wish it would go away" 
[chuckles].

B: No, I was just curious, since you've worked for the VA and in nursing for a long time, what you think 
about the impact that it's had on the VA health care system, and then we have a follow up question about 
how you think it's affected US healthcare in general. But, we have tons of other questions. We know 
burnout is definitely a thing. 
  
[49:09] SB: I equated it to the stages of grief, actually, because we were all in the fight last year. We 
coincidentally got the vaccine at the end of the year, and I think we all believed that, "Man, 2020 is 
gonna get outta here and life's gonna be wonderful, and we're gonna open back up and it's just gonna be 
amazing 'cause we got the vaccine," and then it didn't work like that. While we may have seen a little bit 
of a reprieve, when the Delta variant hit, it hit right smack dab in Arkansas. The surge started for the 
nation this time with us, and we were one of the first VAs that became inundated almost immediately 
with the Delta. We were seeing things we did not expect to see. We really thought we were on a 
recovery mode. I think I saw people go through those whole denial bargaining: "If we could just get 
more people to be vaccinated." It was really a struggle in our system, and now, I think truly, in our 
nation. It became evident quickly that this surge was going to outpower everything we had, and so, 
while we had opened back up in a recovery mode and were doing surgeries again and doing procedures 
again, we had to shut down pretty quickly. Like I said, we went from one COVID inpatient ward to three 
now, and we had to re-assign staff to take care of the patients in the beds, and that's tough on staff. We 
then started calming down. I will say that as we surged up, we were one of the first to ask for our 
emergency DEMPS volunteers from the nation, the VA system, the emergency response for the VA, and 
we were so blessed to get tons of help to come. I think that's what really helped get us through those first 
early weeks of this recent surge. We are calming down now, but it's very difficult to know what's the 
next thing that's gonna hit. I think it's been a challenge and I know everybody has their own perspectives 
on it, but I think we've learned a lot and we've become so proficient with the computer system and 
having meetings by the computer. Unfortunately, that has led to a whole lot of sittin' around that we 
didn't do before too, so I think there's some challenges with that, but we've been able to do some 
wonderful things with saving lives and maintaining lives and helping families connect virtually when 
they couldn't connect in person because of the risk. I think we've increased our virtual presence and our 
opportunities for veterans to connect with us without having to be in the building, and that's been a 
positive thing from the pandemic. I think also the challenge with what some people call the long haulers 
or the long COVID is, we don't know the extent of some of the rehab needs yet that people will have. A 
lot of pulmonary rehab needs, but there's some other things that are a little bit odd in the effects from 
COVID that I'm not sure we know even now the extent of what some of those long-time needs may be 
for people who've had COVID. I think it's changed us for sure. It's something that I don't believe any of 
us thought we would go through, and I think about our kids now that have grown up not knowing 
anything but the masks or being in school, out of school. There's no consistency and it's quite a 
challenge. I miss going to concerts. I'm just gonna tell you [chuckles]. 
  
LK: You spoke a little bit about technology. Could you talk about some of the technology that you 
interact with, what sorts of software you've been using? 
  
[54:20] SB: The VA developed their own computerized patient record system years and years and years 
ago and so we use that. I probably use that daily. VA also designed the first barcode med administration 
system. A nurse in a Kansas VA thought that idea up, and it became really state-of-the-art. I interact 
with that, but we have got all kinds of programs. Some of the latest are things like Power BI. That is 
what we use to keep track of staffing positions, position management. We use Leaf software, which

2020012 
Nursing America's Veterans

helps us do document management and signature management for documents. Of course, we're using all 
of the Microsoft Outlook and Teams and we're on Teams constantly. We do some meetings by WebEx 
or Zoom, and just mostly those kinds of products. We use a lot of VA-designed data management and 
quality metrics management software and programs, and I use those daily. We've developed, on our 
station, a pretty significant staffing methodology tracking metrics and ability to electronically track our 
schedules and our nursing hours per patient day. I'm in that system every day. Those kinds of things, I 
think, is what we spend most of our time doing. 
  
LK: This is a follow up question: What changes would you like to see in the computer systems that you 
work with? 
  
SB: You may know that the VA is looking to get a commercially-prepared product, that our electronic 
health record product that was developed has really kind of reached its limitations, and it also, as it's 
been rolled out across so many VAs, has become become customized, so it makes it harder to transmit 
between VA to VA. It also makes it harder to do something that we've tried to do for years, and that's 
have a link with the Department of Defense, so that when an active duty soldier leaves service, they will 
have a seamless transition. But because of the bulk and the age and the complexity of our electronic 
record that we designed, that has not really been doable. Going to a commercial product that's developed 
for us, we could make that link to the Department of Defense. If I had my choice, I would say I'd like to 
see that fast-tracked and accurate and [unintelligible]. I tell you the other thing I would like to see, just 
in Arkansas. It's not so much in the VA's control, although maybe parts of it are, but I really would like 
to see us be able to have more reliable WiFi and internet access, so that when we are trying to 
communicate with our veterans in some of the very rural parts of Arkansas, that we've got more 
connectivity and ability to do that. 
  
LK: Thank you. This has been so informative. Can we just ask a few broader wrap-up questions before 
we conclude? 
  
SB: Sure, sure. It's okay. It's late. 
  
LK: What do you see as your role in providing patient care? 
  
SB: My current role I think as a senior leader is to make sure that resources are available, barriers are 
knocked down, to be able to keep us focused on the mission, and to make sure that what we do is quality 
and patient-centered. I think the way to do that in many ways is to start with making sure staff are 
satisfied and confident in their abilities to take care of the job and do the job every day to be aligned 
with the mission. 
  
B: You talked briefly of the updating of the electronics record system, and particularly about 
transitioning people from the DoD system to the VA system after they're discharged, but are there any 
other services that you would like to see provided or improved for veterans? 
  
SB: I spoke about the more reliable virtual care. I think the virtual care technology is there, but it's often 
the platform for the WiFi is not as reliable in some places, so I would like to see that. I think for 
veterans, what the VA is able to do is pretty comprehensive, and within the network, if it's not available 
at one VA, it typically is at another or we pay for it in the community. I would like to see that more

connected with what the needs are at the time. For instance, we have a growing women's population, and 
we're working very hard to make sure that we have those services for women. A couple I think have 
now, but most VAs don't deliver babies or do obstetrics, but we do case management so that we work 
with them in the community. I think making sure that we continue to keep up with what those changing 
needs may be and that we're making services available as close to the veteran as possible at the time the 
veteran needs it. To do so, sometimes we have to get rid of some of the old ways of bureaucratic 
thinking and bureaucratic doing things. We can't work an administrative tour of 7:30 to four or eight to 
4:30. Care has got to be 24-7, as close to the veteran as we can get it. I think I'd like to see those changes 
continue and maybe even expand. We've done a great job over the past few years with enhancing some 
of those services and the provision of those services closer to where the veterans are, and I think I'll see 
that continuing in the future. 
  
LK: How has the VA changed over the course of your career, and how have you seen your job change 
over the course of your career? 
  
[1:03:15] SB: I think I've seen my job change accidentally. I know that sounds a little odd, but I was 
perfectly happy taking care of veterans in the emergency department, and very proud to be one of the 
first four advanced practice nurses at the Fayetteville, VA when the state of Arkansas adopted advanced 
practice nurse licensure. There was four of us there at the time, and so that was very exciting to be on 
that cutting edge. I think moving from that to even-- if I stay with even the advanced practice nurse, I 
don't know how many advanced practice nurses in Fayetteville. It's a much smaller facility, but we have 
100 and a half advanced practice nurses at Little Rock. It's a very well-respected level of care provision, 
and needed. I've seen that change in health care in general, and the VA has even moved a step further 
and become the first to declare federal supremacy for full practice authority for advanced practice 
nurses. Now, what that means is every state governs what level advanced practice nurses can do and 
what the requirements are for advanced practice, so every state licensure is different. Some states, up 
until not too long ago, you couldn't prescribe medicines if you were an advanced practice nurse. Some 
only let you prescribe some medicines. Some made you be in a collaborative practice with a physician, 
some didn't. Everything was a little bit different in each state of licensure, governed by that state's Board 
of Nursing and the legislation in that state. VA said, "Well, we're not gonna do this anymore," and they 
went through quite a process to establish full practice authority, which means that the practice for 
advanced practice nurses, no matter the state of their licensure, is the same if they're practicing in a 
federal institute as the VA. I've seen that change, and the VA has pushed that forward. I've also seen the 
change to where we truly have become more patient-centered, to where we're continually trying to 
improve that, continually trying to improve being there, easy to access for the veteran, easy to get an 
answer, first call resolution to where it's just one call to get their issues addressed. Mail out pharmacy 
has improved. The way you can get referrals or refills has improved. Having the My Healthy Vet 
program, where it's a online resource and the veteran can actually get into their own medical records and 
see their own notes and get their own lab tests. It's another level of electronic connection that's not right 
for every veteran, but as we grow and as veterans become, across the board, more computer literate and 
able to get to the Wi Fi, we'll be able to even further grow that program. I think that the way we 
communicate with our veterans has changed. The way nurses have provided care, as advanced practice 
nurses, has improved and changed and been a leader in the country for that. I think the dedication to the 
mission has always been there. If it does anything, it gets stronger. People come to work and stay at the 
VA because they're connected. They're either a veteran or they have a connection to a veteran, or, like 
80% of the people in health care, they've trained in a VA. One of the VA's missions is still training those

in the health care professions, and so we still are actively doing that. That is very rewarding to know we 
have nurses and chaplains and physicians and others, respiratory therapists and physical therapists, that 
are comin' to us for part of their training. 
  
B: Do you have anyone that you think of as a mentor, that you still go to with questions? 
  
SB: Not so much anymore, maybe as I did previously, but I always try to bounce things off of people. 
There's a number of people that if I have a question or just want to check out somethin' I'm thinkin' or I 
want to run an idea by somebody, I still have quite a few people that I've worked with over the years that 
I'm able to do that with. Some of them have been colleagues and some of 'em have been teachers and 
some of 'em have been from my church. 
  
LK: Thank you so much for speaking with us. I don't have any more questions. B, do you have any 
questions? Alright. Well, thank you so much for speaking with us again, and please enjoy the rest of 
your night.
