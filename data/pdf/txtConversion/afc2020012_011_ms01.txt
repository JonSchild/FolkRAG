AG: Hi, Renee.  Thank you so much for joining the Library of Congress interviews.  Can I ask  
you to introduce yourself? 
 
RS: Okay, hi.  My name is Renee Samuels.  I’m a registered nurse.  I’ve been a registered nurse  
now since 2014.  And it’s actually been seven years.   
 
 
AG: Okay.  Renee, where did you grow up? 
 
RS:  So, I was born and raised in New York City, the Bronx.  I was actually born at public  
hospital, Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.  Around seven or eight months old, I went to Jamaica to  
say with my grandparents, and I lived in Montego Bay, Jamaica and the West Indies until I was 5  
years old.  And then, I came back here, and I went to school, and I basically lived in New York  
for almost my whole life.   
 
AG: Wow.  Were your parents also born in the Bronx, or were they born in Jamaica? 
 
RS: They were born in Jamaica.  I’m actually first generation.  My parents and my older sister  
were all born in Jamaica, and I was like the first one in my immediate family that was born here  
in America. 
 
AG: And do you have lots of memories of the years that you spent in Jamaica with your  
grandma? 
 
RS:  I do.  It was very special time for me.  It was really nice, because our home out there is like  
right cross from the sea.  We’d go to the beach all the time.  We had the little blue crabs.  They  
would crawl up into the house.  My grandma would cook them for us.  I just grew up with a  
bunch of animals.  You have the goats, the cows, the chicken.  We’d chase goats and throw  
sticks at them, and just being kids, bad, but it was really nice.  A lot of son.  A lot of healthy  
living I think. 
 
AG: Oh, yeah, it sounds kind of like paradise. 
 
RS:  Definitely.  I actually learned how to -- that’s how I learned how to swim so young.  I’ve  
been swimming since I was like about 2 or 3 years old, and I learned how to swim in the  
Caribbean sea when I was in Jamaica as a little girl. 
 
AG: Wow, that’s incredible.  And when you came back, do you remember that experience of  
moving back to New York as well?  Was that a big shock, like culture shock?   
 
RS:   No, not really, I think because I was so young, and then growing up in New York City,  
especially in the Bronx, there’s like a very strong Caribbean community there, so you’re around  
a lot of people that have the same similar shared culture.  I don’t remember it being a  
culture shock, and I went to school and it was good.  I don’t think I really experience culture

2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
shock until I was a little bit older.  So, we have this program in New York City called gifted and  
talented, where they basically give you like an IQ test, and if your IQ is -- it has to be at a certain  
level.  So, if you have a high IQ, they put you in this program as a child and you go to  
specialized schools throughout kindergarten to high school and I got into that program I think by  
like 7-years-old.  And so, when I went into that program and went to school, that was like the  
first time I had somebody call me a coconut, and distinctly like that’s when I became distinctly  
aware of being different. 
 
AG: So, it sounds like there was some like stereotypes or assumptions because you were so  
bright and were like so high achieving in school, and like some of your peers and stuff had  
assumptions about that kind of thing? 
 
RS: Well, coconut is just kind of like an offensive term that people can call people from the  
Caribbean to say that you’re a coconut.  I still had an accent or whatever, so that’s where that  
came from.  It was just kind of like a dis for being Caribbean. 
 
AG: I see.  So, it was like the other kids, and they were basically being like racist and kind of  
anti-Caribbean.  It wasn’t like a playful thing, it was like a mean thing? 
 
RS: No, it definitely wasn’t a playful thing. 
 
AG: No. 
 
RS:  I’d even say that it was anti -- I can’t say it was racist, because at that point, when I was in  
elementary school, [00:05:00] the gifted and talented school that I went to was in Harlem, Alain  
Locke.  It was actually a majority black school, but I guess when you get more into that even 
within our community, there are cultural, ethnic, colorism issues, and I think that just came from  
that child probably hearing the adults in their life say whatever about people from the Caribbean.   
I don’t know whether it’s oh, they come here, they take our jobs, or whatever stereotype that they  
heard in their family, and then we got into it, so they repeated that to be hurtful. 
 
AG:  Yeah, that does sound hurtful.  How were you -- you entered the gifted and talented  
program when you were 7, and then you stayed in like those special gifted classes all through  
high school? 
 
RS: Well, through elementary school and junior high, and then for high school in New York  
City we have something that we call the specialized high schools.  At the time, when I was in  
junior high applying for high school, there were only three specialized high schools, Stuyvesant,  
which was number one, Bronx High School of Science, which was number two, and Brooklyn 
Technical High School, which was the third.  My oldest sister had went to Brooklyn Tech, so I  
kind was always like I want to go to that specialized high school, so I took the test and I placed  
for Bronx Science, so that’s where I ended up going to high school.  But many of the kids that I  
went to high school with were in the gifted and talented program.

AG:  That’s incredible to think about.  I know it’s very common in New York that you have to  
like take entrance exams to get into special high schools.  It’s so competitive at such a young age  
in New York academically.  That sounds very stressful. 
 
RS:   It was.  When I think of it now as an adult it’s just like crazy to me of how that culture that  
was, like whenever people talk about like teen pregnancies and stuff like that, that was never a  
thought in my mind as a teenager, because the schools that I went to, the school that I was in,  
everybody was worried about getting into Harvard, or Princeton, or MIT.  My grades have to be  
good.  I have to have this GPA.  I have to get this on the SATs to get into these schools.  That’s  
what everybody was thinking about. 
 
AG: Yeah, exactly.  It sounds like it was a very high pressure academic experience. 
 
RS: Yeah. 
 
 
AG: When you went to a specialized high school, it was like science and math that it was  
specializing in? 
 
RS: Yes.  Most of these schools do specialize in science and math, and they have very amazing  
programs, amazing alumni, amazing teachers, because I didn’t appreciate it then in high school,  
but when I got to college, I really appreciated the fact that so many of my teachers at Bronx  
Science were like PhD -- held PhD’s in their respective fields, whether it was chemistry, or  
physics, or biology.  When I was -- by the time I got to my first year of college, I was already at  
sophomore level, because I had did so many AP classes at that school, and I did genetics, and we  
had robotics where we built like robots from scratch.  You have a whole robotics team.  Speech - 
- just a really well-rounded program.  But yes, the focus is science and math first and foremost,  
but they do have good languages, English, social studies, all of those classes are vigorous as  
well. 
 
AG: And did you have a favorite subject growing up? 
 
RS: I did.  It was always English.  I’ve loved reading since I was a little girl.  I’ve been reading  
since I was about like 3 years old.  I grew up seeing my mother always reading, and then my  
grandmother told me stories of how like growing up my mother was always in a book.  She spent  
all day reading and I think I kind of got that from her.  That was like always my strongest  
subject, just because that’s inherently what I liked. 
 
[9:49]  AG:  Absolutely.  And you said you went to college, and you already kind of like started  
as a sophomore.  Where did you go to college? 
 
RS: So, when I originally went to college [00:10:00], I went to the University of Florida in  
Gainesville, because I wanted to be a veterinarian, and they had a really good -- well, first, they

2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
had a really good pre-vet program, because they’re like one of the few schools in the nation that 
has a veterinary school there.  The undergrad and the graduate program were like really good, so  
I went there.  Actually, I originally wanted to go to Cornell University, because that’s the only  
ivy league that has a veterinary program.  That was like my first biggest disappointment in not  
getting into Cornell.  I actually got deferred.  They told me I could come in sophomore year,  
depending on how my grades were my freshman year in college.  So, that was like very  
disappointing. But I sucked it up.  I went to UF, but I was like way too homesick there.  I ended  
up coming back to New York City.  I changed my major completely.  I went to psychology and I  
did psych at The City University of New York in Harlem. 
 
AG:  Oh, wow.  That’s excellent.  And do you remember when you decided to pursue  
nursing? 
 
RS: Huh? 
 
AG: Do you remember when you decided to pursue nursing? 
 
RS: So, it’s actually after I graduated from city college with my bachelor’s in psychology.  I  
was working with children doing kind of like counseling, guidance counsel work, which was  
okay, but it wasn’t as fulfilling as I thought it would be, because my ultimate plan was to become  
a school psychologist.  I was at a crossroads between applying for grad school in psychology or  
doing something else.  At the time, everybody was like why don’t you do nursing?  You can  
make great money while you figure it out.  My mother is a nurse, my sister is a nurse, so we have  
a long history of nursing in my family, which was why I was kind of always like oh, no, I don’t  
want to be a nurse.  Everybody is a nurse.  I don’t want to do that.  My mom, my aunts, my  
sisters, no.  But I went to nursing school.  I did a 2-year program.  I went to a community college  
at the state university in New York.  I went to Westchester Community College, and I  
earned my associates degree in nursing. 
 
AG: And did you get a job nursing right after that?  Did you go directly like work for a hospital  
or something? 
 
RS: Yeah, I graduated from school in May.  I took and passed my boards in July.  And by  
August, I was working.  My first job was in pediatric home care, and that was interesting, but I  
didn’t like the pay and I had some issues with like the parents.  The whole time I was in nursing  
school -- so, this is funny, I had a degree in psychology.  I hate psych nursing.  The whole time  
I’m working, I’m saying oh, I’m gonna do peds, I love peds, and I get out and I’m working in  
peds, and I don’t like it.  And I don’t like it not because I don’t love working with kids or the  
population, but I didn’t like it because of the families and the parental dynamics, and so forth.   
And so, after that, I went the complete opposite direction, and I started working in geriatrics.   
And then, in March of 2015, I started working at the VA, US Department of Vet Affairs.  This  
was I think maybe like seven or eight months after I became an RN.  I worked at JJP, which is  
James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx, New York.  And I started working there in  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
8 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
geriatrics.  And I worked there until 2108. 
 
[14:36]  AG:  Oh, wow.  And how did you find the job at the VA or learn that they had  
opening? 
 
RS: Well, it was really through an internal connection, honestly.  My mother worked there for a  
number of years.  She actually retired from the VA in 2018, and my older sister had worked there  
on an intermittent basis. [00:15:00]  I had family that worked there, so they were the ones that  
kind of told me about the VA, the culture, the environment, the benefits. 
 
AG: And what to you makes it appealing to work at the VA, like about the things that they told  
you when they went to recruit you?  What appealed you the most? 
 
RS: Well, the thing that appeals to me the most and the thing that keeps me at the VA is the  
patient population that we’re caring for.  My older sister is a veteran.  She’s a marine vet.  And  
it’s just a really honorable thing to care for the people that fought for this country, or even if they  
didn’t fight, they were in a position where at any moment they could be called to fight.  And I  
think that’s really deep, because I don’t know if that’s something, honestly, that I could do  
myself, so I have a lot of respect for military and our veterans.  That was the strongest thing that  
drew me to the VA was the patient population.  But I also like the benefits, other things they  
have.  There’s so much research and advancement, and that’s always being done at the VA.  The  
VA employs the most nurses in American.  The VA trains like 80% of America’s physicians.   
Most VA’s are connected to educational institutions, and so we’re always training physicians,  
and nurses, and pharmacists, and social workers, and everybody.  It’s just a plethora of things  
like that, that really made me want to work there, because of all the things they come up with,  
they do.  I there’s been like vaccines, different things that have been created by VA physicians,  
so it’s a really good history.  And then, of course, working for the federal government is not bad.   
You do have good benefits and stuff like that. 
 
AG: Yeah, it’s such an important institution, and then like you said it’s also good as an  
employer in a lot of ways to have a job with the federal government.  That’s strong benefit of  
having a government job.  That’s awesome.  And how exciting that your mom and your sister  
also worked at the same VA.  In that first role, you were working on the geriatric unit, you said? 
 
RS: Yes, I was.  I was working in what we call the community living center. 
 
AG: What is that? 
 
RS:  The community living center in some ways would be comparable to what in the  
community you call a nursing home.  So, in the CLC, they provide short term  
rehabilitation, like let’s say you get knee replacement or hip replacement, and you get rehab.  It’s  
also a long term home for veterans.  And then, we also do hospice and palliative care in the CLC.

2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
[18:21]  AG:  And when you were in the unit, what was your role?  Were you seeing many  
patients in a day?  Did you have like a smaller floor that you were responsible for?  What was  
your day to day like in that? 
 
RS:  So, in that kind of unit specialty as an RN, you really function in kind of more so as like a  
charge nurse role.  Ultimately, the buck stops with you.  You’re the team leader.  And then, you  
have your managers, the assistant nurse managers, but most of the people working under you are  
license practical nurses, nursing assistants, and so you’re really charged with being in charge of  
the care of those veterans and supervising the work of the other staff. 
 
AG:  How many staff were typically under you on your average shift? 
 
RS:   Well, for example on nights, because I was hired for nights, and I mainly worked nights, I  
crossed over and did day and evenings at times, but for the most part on night.  Our CLC was  
two floors, and we usually have two registered nurses on each floor.  Sometimes we had three  
registered nurses on the first floor, because it was a heavier floor.  [00:20:00] And sometimes we  
had two registered nurses on the first floor, one with just a nurse on the second floor, and  
sometimes we had one where just a nurse on each floor, so it would just depend on what was  
going on with staffing.  And then, you could have anywhere from four to six LPNs.  And then,  
four to six LPNs between the two floors.  And then, you can have anywhere from six to eight to  
ten nursing assistants between the two floors on night shift. 
 
AG: You typically worked overnight.  Is that like 6 p.m. ‘til 6 a.m. or something like that? 
 
RS: Well, there they had five hours shifts at that time when I was working there.  I was working  
11:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. 
 
AG: Were there typical issues or like problems that emerged with the patients on an overnight  
shift?  Were there things that you got very used to dealing with in that role? 
 
RS: With the patient, there wasn’t many issues.  For the most part, the patients were sleeping.   
Of course, in the morning, there was some morning medications that we have to give them  
before they wake up, and then for our patients that were incontinent, of course, it’s very  
important to make sure that they’re clean, they’re dry, and then also to just the type of patient  
populations we had.  We had patients that had wounds, so again important to make sure that  
they’re turned, and positioned, and you’re getting that pressure off of them.  And then, of course,  
being with the type of specialist that we’re doing, we’re dealing with a lot of patients that have  
dementia, Alzheimer’s, those issues, and then you have issues of them trying to get up leave or  
go to the bathroom on your own, and they’re too weak.  You always have this risk of falls that  
you have to closely monitor. 
 
AG: Did you enjoy that job, working on the geriatric unit in the CLC? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
10 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
RS: I like the patients.  It wasn’t the nursing work itself that I didn’t like.  What really drew me  
from that job was staffing and management issues, as well as the shift.  I just could not deal with  
the eight hour shifts overnight five days a week.  It was too much.  I wanted 12 hours.  I  
advocated for 12 hours while I was there, and we didn’t get them, but after I had left and moved  
on to other opportunities in the VA, they did end up getting 12-hours shifts, which I think it’s  
way better, because most nurses that’s what they want. 
 
AG: Yeah, that’s so great that you ended up making a difference, even though you couldn’t  
benefit from it, the nurses in that position now have the 12 hours. 
 
RS: Yeah. 
 
[23:31] AG:  So, where did you go after leaving the CLC? 
 
RS: So, after I left the CLC, I transferred to the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System,  
and so I actually went to the Eugene Towbin VA Medical Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.  And  
I went there, and went to acute psych, because working with the veteran patients, even though it  
was geriatrics, a lot of them had mental health issues.  It was just something I was interested in  
learning more about, seeing how that went, so I started working in acute psychiatry for the VA,  
and that’s where I found my forever specialty. 
 
AG: You’re currently working as a psychiatric nurse? 
 
RS: Yes. 
 
AG: Are you still in Arkansas? 
 
RS: No, I’m not.  I’m in Florida, and I’m actually at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center  
now. 
 
AG: Got it.  How long have you been in Florida? 
 
RS: I’ve been in Florida a year and a half, so I started my position here in January 2020.   
[00:25:00] 
 
AG: Wow, right in like the thick of COVID and all the changes. 
 
RS: Yeah, well, when I first got here, it was like before COVID, and then I was here like three  
months, and then boom COVID hit, so that was very interesting. 
 
AG:  What is your role there in Florida? 
 
RS: Here, I’m actually working in mental health services.  I’ve worked in the mental health  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
11 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
clinics, the substance abuse clinic, I’ve worked in acute psychiatry. The role that I’m doing now  
is like a combination, so I’m working in what we call the mental health residential rehabilitation  
treatment program.  It’s a program where we have veterans with mental health issues, substance  
abuse issues.  And they don’t need to be on like an acute psychiatry, which is a very lockdown  
strict area, but they’re not quite ready to go home yet.  And some of them don’t even have homes  
to go to.  It’s what we would call an intermediate level of care.  That’s what I’m doing now. 
 
AG: What is your typical day like in that sort of inpatient setting? 
 
RS:  Can you repeat that? 
 
AG: What is your typical shift like there? 
 
RS:  So, I do 12 hours here.  I work 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.  As a registered nurse, my role here is  
really I’m doing admissions.  I’m doing discharges, transfers.  We do psychoeducational groups.   
We’re really providing therapeutic care, therapeutic milieu for the veterans and helping them try  
to improve various skills, whether it’s life skills, social skills, dealing with others. 
 
AG: How many residents are there at any one time? 
  
 
RS:   So far, we usually have between 30 to 36.  The facility can hold up to 60 veterans, but  
we’ve never gotten there yet, because soon after we opened, COVID hit.  That brought  
restrictions.  And right now we’re allowed to go to a capacity of 45.  The closest we’ve gotten to  
that is maybe about 40, but we haven’t even quite gotten to the 45 capacity yet, and I’m not sure  
when they’re gonna go to the full 60. 
 
[28:22]  AG:  So, when COVID hit, were there residents there in the unit?  Did you have to send  
them away, or did they stay there? 
 
RS: Well, our veterans that were here were allowed to stay, because they had been here.  They  
hadn’t been out into the community as to worry about a COVID exposure, but the way the  
program is ran, because it’s an intermediate program, and we really try to teach you the skills to  
live successfully with your mental health, substance abuse and/or both illnesses in the  
community, the goal is to be able to allow you certain freedoms.  Before people were able to go  
to their appointments and they were able to have visitors.  They had certain leeway’s, because  
it’s not just about locking people down.  We really have to prepare you to be successful in the  
world.  When COVID hit, obviously that’s a communicable disease, so all of that shutdown.  It  
was like a Friday.  I don’t know, I think it might have been like 6 p.m.  They told all the vets like  
-- obviously, at the time, everything was like -- we were just trying to kind of figure it out as we  
go along, guidance from the CDC was everchanging, but they basically told the patients that  
were in the program at the time that we were basically gonna be on quarantine.  [00:30:00]   
We’re gonna be locked down.  So, no more visitors.  No more passes.  No more going out. None  
of that.  At that time, I was working on nightshift actually, so I was working 7 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.

I offered some thoughts as far as like can the veterans still go outside?  Can they walk?  Can they  
at least have some kind of -- because to just be locked inside a facility, it can be triggering for  
people with certain mental illnesses, and then it’s also like they didn’t sign up to be in jail, and it  
kind of feels a little bit like that.  They were able to come up with a plan of where we allow the  
veterans to have outside time under staff supervision.  They were able to go for daily walks and  
so forth.  The whole situation kind of just progressed from there as COVID progressed. 
 
AG: Right.  Yeah, it was so unexpected for everybody to deal with.  But at least, like you said,  
you were able to get them the opportunity to go outside a bit and to not feel so trapped. And what  
was your day to day like?  Did you continue to work in the facility during COVID, or did at any  
point you go remote or anything?  How did COVID affect your daily work? 
 
RS: Well, it changed our daily work too, because when this whole pandemic came out, kind of  
the guidance that we were given as far as PPE and other stuff was outrageous, because at that  
time, I had been working at -- like I said, I’ve been working for the Department of Veterans’  
Affairs for several years.  Most of my entire career has actually been with them.  I had worked at   
more than one facility, and so I was kind of used to a certain standard with the VA.  That was  
one of the things that made me go there, because I remember when I was working the private  
sector -- and I’ve worked in the private sector while working at the VA as well on a part-time  
basis.  Some of the things that really upset me was at times I felt like patients didn’t really  
receive the care that they were supposed to, because of money.  Staff didn’t receive supplies they  
were supposed to because of money, and that was never an issue in my whole entire career at the  
VA.  The had the supplies, the equipment, the material, whatever we needed to care for our  
veterans and get it done, they did it.  They would go to Congress.  They’d get a check cut and  
we’d take care of our vets.  And it was nice that we weren’t being reimbursed by insurers or  
private pay or whatever, because that comes with a plethora of issues that you don’t have at the  
VA.  For the first time in my career at the VA, that seemed like it went upside down.  So, all of  
the sudden, we’re being given guidance -- and mind you, I worked at the VA during Ebola in  
New York City.  Never experienced this. Now, all of the sudden, they’re telling us, okay, you  
have to wear this one mask for a week, or two weeks, or I don’t even remember.  Something like  
that.  They’re basically telling us to reuse supplies that in my whole nursing career have always  
been one time use, disposable.  Those are the manufacturer guidelines.  Those are what this  
products say, and now somehow, someway -- like JCAHO, all these accreditation bodies, VA,  
your infection control, your communities -- if anybody ever seen you reuse gloves, a mask, or  
gown or anything, you would be in big, big trouble.  That was always a no-no.  For every  
institution that have for the longest time from nursing school to now -- in nursing school they tell  
you about sterile technique.  They teach you about personal protective equipment.  They teach  
you about donning and doffing, and for now everything that I’ve ever known in nursing to be  
turned completely on its head, it was just crazy.  I didn’t like it.  It was really, really upsetting,  
and I’m like I can’t believe they’re telling me to reuse masks, masks that I’ve -- these are not  
new masks, by the way.  [00:35:00]  These are the same masks that we’ve always used that  
you’ve always told us were single use.  Now you’re telling me to use them for extended period  
of time.  Of course, obviously -- become soiled,  a patient -- you get patient secretions or  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
13 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
whatever on you, of course you can get a new one, but they’re pretty much telling you wear this  
one mask.  So, that was extremely upsetting. 
 
AG: It really is so upsetting.  Was it because they were short on masks or they were afraid they  
were gonna run out of masks or something like that?  Did they give you any explanation for  
changing the guidelines? 
 
RS: I mean, I’m sure they gave us some official explanation, which I don’t want to repeat, I  
don’t want to lie, because I was just so mad that whatever little explanation they gave us was not  
acceptable to me.  But when it comes down to it, it was really about conserving supplies.  I don’t  
think the VA ever not had supplies, but it’s twofold.  On them, to be a little bit fair, they were  
obviously worried about employees pilfering supplies, right, because in the nation is this craze.  
Now you’re worried about employees pilfering, you know, masks, gowns, cleaning equipment.  I  
get that aspect of it.  But they had the supplies.  They had the supplies.  They had it.  They got it.   
I don’t think it was ever about the supplies.  I think it was always their fear about well, what  
happens if we run out.  And so, I guess in being overly cautious, that’s where that came from.   
‘Cause from what -- 
 
AG: Putting people at risk, yeah. 
 
RS: Yeah, (inaudible - 00:37:01) departments, and what I know there wasn’t a shortage in  
supply.  It was just they wanted to conserve supplies. 
 
[37:11] AG:  Did anyone in your facility catch COVID?  Were the staff or the patients exposed,  
do you know? 
 
RS: Oh, yes, we had numerous patients that caught COVID.  We had numerous coworkers that  
caught COVID.  We had coworkers that died of COVID.  And not specifically when I say  
COVID -- because a patient is just my area, but just I’m talking about a hospital in general.  
There  
was a wave of COVID that hit southeast Florida very badly, which is where I’m at, and so we  
had to deal with that.  And I lost coworkers.  I didn’t lose any patients to COVID personally that  
I cared for, but we did have patients that succumbed to it.  And I had coworkers that had it that  
thankfully didn’t pass, but they were out for weeks dealing with it. 
 
AG: How did you handle being in the midst of this crisis and having your coworkers and people  
you care about getting sick, and in some cases passing away?  Did you have any kind of like  
selfcare that you could do? 
 
RS: Yeah, that was actually a big thing.  I actually even came up with some selfcare tips.  I  
actually put together a whole presentation that I did for college students.  I did it in conjunction  
with my sorority, because the mental health toll of COVID was just ridiculous.  I mean,  
everything just happened so fast.  One day you’re living your life, and then the next day they’re  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
14 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
telling you like basically you have to stay in your house and you can’t even go anywhere.  It was  
just a huge mental health toll for everybody in general.  And then, on top of that, as healthcare  
workers, nurses, it was a huge toll for us.  I have friends, sorority sisters in New York and the  
videos, and pictures, and everything they sent me is just God awful.  It felt like the bubonic  
plague.  Like, honestly, that’s something you learn about in school, and it was crazy to like  
actually be living that for real.  And it’s crazy when you’re watching the news, or the TV, or  
listening to people like try to deny this when you see people like literally being put in body bags.   
Literally there are so many people dying [00:40:00] that hospitals don’t even have anywhere to  
put them.  And then, people are saying foolishness like, oh, I went to the hospital and there’s no  
cars there.  Well, duh, of course there’s no cars there; were not allowing anybody to come in, so  
why would there be cars there?  It’s literally you have somebody that is sick and you’re dropping  
them at the emergency room and leaving, because you cannot come in at all.  And it was so  
messed up to me, because we have so many patients that are going through so much and no one  
is there.  You’re giving birth by yourself in a cold hospital.  You’re dying by yourself in a cold  
hospital.  You’re going through these things.  People that are sick and need to go to the ER don’t  
even want to go to the ER, because they think they’re gonna catch  COVID, and they probably  
would catch COVID in the ER. 
 
AG: So terrifying.  Like you said, those images -- I’m in Brooklyn, and like the hospitals around  
here were so overloaded and it was so terrifying those early months especially.  Oh, my gosh.   
When you think about the COVID pandemic, are there any lessons that you’re going to take  
from it or that you think about that maybe you think about changing nursing or even just  
changing how you live your life, that kind of thing? 
 
RS: For me personally, it didn’t change my view on nursing, because I had already came to the  
realization that most of these corporations do not care about us.  Organizations, if you don’t  
want to call governmental agencies corporations.  When they say corporations, agencies,  
whatever, they still have a bottom line that’s way bigger than any of us, and you as an  
individual don’t matter.  And different ways, they try to say that you do or whatever, but they  
don’t.  I’ve always kind of been a big proponent of live your life.  You cannot give your all to  
work.  I’m gonna show up to work.  I’m gonna do the best that I can in the 12 hours that I’m  
here, and then I’m leaving.  I take my vacation days.  I take my sick time, not only because oh,  
well, I’m physically sick, I can’t come in, I take mental health days all the time, because it’s not  
just physical illness.  You sometimes mentally are so exhausted, so drained, so depressed you  
need your time.  But for years, even before COVID happened, I always did stuff like that, so that  
wasn’t really an issue for me, but what I have noticed in a bunch of my peers -- I have a lot of  
friends.  (inaudible - 00:42:56) a lot of friends in nursing.  I’m in a nursing sorority.  Being in  
this career for a while, you just get so many different perspectives.  For a lot of people, they  
didn’t have the same perspective that I did.  I think they had a lot more loyalty to their jobs  
and to them. When they seen the way they were treating during the whole COVID pandemic, it  
changed -- I mean, so many people left the nursing field.  I’m not gonna lie to you.  I can off the  
top of my head tell you 10 of my girlfriends that left nursing.  So many people retired.  I could  
list a bunch of coworkers I had that all retired.  They were seeing a nursing shortage before I  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
15 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
even know what it’s gonna look like, because COVID pushed so many people, so, so, so many  
people out of nursing.  We were overwhelmed, underpaid, underappreciated.  People were  
attacking nurses, calling us liars, calling us agents, whatever.  You have your  
own president that’s denying an illness that you’re in the hospital fighting, and you have people  
attacking you.  Nurses got attacked at the gas station.  Nurses got attacked at the grocery store.   
Meanwhile, the same people that are saying this is fake is the same ones we’ve got to take care  
of when they come to the hospital and give them good care.  And then, people tried to tell us to  
suck it up and be like, oh, well, that’s what you chose, oh, you decide to go into nursing.  Well,  
yeah, we decided to go into nursing with the proper equipment.  You didn’t see these kind of  
concerns from nurses during Ebola or H1N1 or whatever.  I remember when Ebola was  
happening, the VA had us in suits like the outbreak movie, like head to toe yellow -- look like  
you’re going to the moon or something.  And then, COVID happens and you’re telling me to use  
a mask for weeks.  It’s completely different.  [00:45:00]  People don’t appreciate that.  They talk  
about soldiers or police.   Soldiers are given the proper equipment to go fight.  Nobody puts a  
pocketknife in your hand and tell you, okay, go to war, bye.  Good luck.  That’s the issue.  For a  
lot of nurses, they’re just like I’ll do something else.  Or now, a lot of nurses, they went to travel,  
where it’s like, okay, I’ll still do nursing, but I’m no longer going to be loyal to any facility, stay  
with any facility, so facilities are losing staff nurses in droves, whether to retirement, whether to  
another career, or whether they decided I’m just gonna go travel, because you guys aren’t loyal  
to me, so I’m not gonna be loyal to you.  But for me -- and a lot of nurses was angry.  I was  
angry, so all those things made me angry.  I was mad.  I was pissed off.  And that’s what really  
help me to create this program, because there was a way that we had to deal with it, because as  
angry as I was, at no point did I ever say, okay, I want to leave nursing.  So, I never got to that  
point.  Because I wasn’t at that point, I said, okay, well, let me come up with something for 
people who still want to stay in nursing, but they just need to fill out some ways to like deal  
with this mentally. 
 
AG: And you gave those presentations to like students in nursing schools? 
 
RS: Yeah, so I gave it to students in nursing school, and then I also just did it with just nurses  
that are already practicing nurses in the field currently. 
 
AG: And that’s something you just did as a volunteer on your own time? 
 
RS: Yeah, so like I said, I did it in conjunction with my sorority, kind of just like community  
service like project initiative.   
 
AG: Wow, that’s so impressive.  Like with everything happening this year, to take the time to  
give back, like you said, and to the community in that way to try to help other nurses is really  
admirable, because I know you must have been, like you said, angry, and stretched thin, and  
grieving for your coworkers and everything else on top of it, so that’s really admirable.  Oh, my  
goodness.  Have you concluded those?  Are they gonna be ongoing in the future too, the selfcare  
presentations? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

16 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
RS: Well, I have concluded it, because I’m thinking that we’re getting back more to normal, but  
I’m currently in grad school studying to be a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner.  And I  
know that services are gonna be so needed, because when you look at the research, you look at  
surveys, the mental toll and impact from COVID was huge, and it’s not just gonna go away  
overnight, because more people are vaccinated and we’re being able to go back to a semblance  
of normal.  I’ve had patients that committed suicide.  I didn’t lose patients to COVID, per say as  
far as the disease killing them, but I’ve lost patients to COVID, because mentally they couldn’t  
deal with everything that came with the pandemic, and so they chose to end their life. 
  
[48:40] AG:  Oh, gosh, that’s so difficult.  And as a psychiatric nurse practitioner, will your role  
change?  What kind of responsibilities will that role entail once you’re completed with that  
degree? 
 
RS:  Well, that will be expanding that I currently do as a registered nurse, because now I’m  
stepping into the role of what we call a provider, where I’ll actually be able to diagnose  
psychiatric illness and prescribe medications.  And also prescribe psychotherapy.  It’s a more  
expanded role, for sure.  Way more expanded.  
 
AG:  It sounds like it’s very similar to being a psychiatrist. 
 
RS: Yes. 
 
AG:  (inaudible - 00:50:19). 
 
RS:   Yeah, so that’s basically -- so, yeah, as an advance practice nurse, which is what we call  
that, you’re really stepping into a role similar to the physician.  We get pushback for that too,  
obviously, from many physician groups, but you can’t argue with evidence, and the evidence just  
shows that nurse practitioners provide care that’s equivalent and actually often times better than  
what physicians provide care [00:50:00] that’s equivalent and actually often times better than  
what physicians provide.  But I think there’s still very much needed in more of a specialized role,  
where I think nurse practitioners are great for filling in all the gaps that we have in more of a  
primary care role.  For example, for me I would see my role as managing patients on an  
outpatient basis, patients who are more stable, we definitely still need physicians, but that’s  
gonna be a whole other argument that we don’t have all day before, because they whole higher  
education, the way that physicians are educated, trained, and the cost that comes with that has to  
be changed, because no one no longer wants to go into primary care, psychiatry, family practice,  
pediatrics.  Right now, over 60% of psychiatrists are 60 years old and older.  They’re like one of  
the top two oldest specialties in medicine.  No one is doing that.  Everybody wants to go into  
what they consider big money, anesthesiology, surgery, especially plastics, neurosurgery,  
dermatology.  They’re going into what are considered the big money specialty, or orthopedics,  
orthopedic surgery.  Nurse practitioners were needed. I know there’s definitely a need for what  
I’m doing. 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

17 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
AG: Absolutely.  And how much long do you have until you complete that degree? 
 
RS: So, I will be done the end of next year, in December.  After that, I’ll probably study and  
take my boards sometimes in maybe January, February, or March of 2023. 
 
[52:08]  AG:  Wow, that sounds great.  Is it difficult to balance graduate school and your  
full-time role at the VA now? 
 
RS: It is.  It definitely takes a lot of time management, flexibility.  It’s hard.  And then, also  
something that makes it a little bit harder for me is that I’m not just doing the master’s program,  
I’m actually doing a doctoral program, so I’m earning my Doctor of Nursing practice.  That  
program also is longer, a little bit more intense.  All of that adds to it as well. 
 
AG: It’s even more rigorous on top of having a full-time job. 
 
RS: Yeah. 
 
AG: You’re also becoming a PhD and getting your doctorate.  That sounds really demanding.   
Are you like physically in school or is it mostly remote online because of COVID or a  
combination? 
 
RS: Well, it’s been mostly online, honestly, because of COVID.  Right now, I’m going to  
Florida Atlantic University, so I’ve been doing a lot of the fundamental courses, as we call them,  
so we’ve been able to do those online, but we did receive notification from the school that  
starting for the fall semester, given everything from the CDC and of course our governmental  
agencies, Governor DeSantis, school is gonna resume in person at full capacity in fall, so I may  
have to go to campus beginning in the fall.  I know not all of the nursing courses will be on  
campus, because they don’t have to be, but I definitely know some of the courses will be for sure  
on campus. 
 
AG: And is the campus nearby to the work?  Do you live, and work, and go to school in like a  
relatively close area, or is it a lot of commuting? 
 
RS: Fortunately, for me, it’s close, because my personal motto is I never live more than 30  
minutes from work.  I refuse.  But that’s just my personal mantra, play, whatever, I’ll travel a  
little bit further for, but work I’m kind of dead set at like 30 minutes.  My job is actually 15  
minutes from me, and my school is about 25 minutes from me.  Fortunately, I don’t have a super  
long commute for either one. 
 
[54:46]  AG: That’s good.  As you’re balancing all of these things, you can minimize the  
commute a little bit.  Do you have time for us to just have like a few kind of big picture wrap up  
questions before we conclude? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
18 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
 
RS: Yeah, sure. 
 
AG: Great.  [ 00:55:00]  When you think about your career so far working for the VA, what  
would you say are some of the benefits and drawbacks of working at the VA versus like the  
private sector or something? 
 
RS: Even though they’ve kind of been ghosts for the last year, one of the biggest benefits of  
working there is the union.  They’ve done a lot.  I have to give them their due credit, and I didn’t  
realize it as much being in New York, because New York is a heavily union state, whether it’s  
the public sector or the private sector, New York is very, very heavy union.  It’s not a right  
to work at all.  Now I’m living in a state that’s a right to work state, and I don’t  
work in a private sector here, but when I’ve heard stories from coworkers or stories that I seen in  
news, I’m very grateful for the protections and the benefits that I have at the VA, because a lot of  
people don’t have that, especially with this crisis that just happened.  Also, too, like there’s a lot  
of things thing where I like working there that I kind of touched on before.  And I didn’t  
really go into the benefits much, but it’s really good.  They give you a lot of benefits, and a lot of  
places aren’t -- most places are not giving you a pension.  They give you a 401k, which is tied  
into the stock market, which at times can be volatile.  Even last year looked what happened.  Life  
insurance, health insurance, dental, vision, just so many things.  For example, we get paid time  
off to go vote.  How many places are giving that to you?  It’s just a plethora of benefits why I  
stay here.  And it just feels nice to care for the type of patients that we care for.  I don’t know  
how good I’d be in the private sector, because sometimes I see the sense of entitlement that you  
can experience from individuals and certain patients.  And I don’t have any tolerance for  
that.  I think God put me where I’m meant to be. 
 
AG:  Yeah, absolutely.  And it sounds like working with the veteran population, you  
sense some appreciation and gratitude for the nurses role in their lives. 
 
RS: They definitely are.  The people that you work with, you genuinely want not help them, and  
I think there’s nurses everywhere -- you really do, you really care.  You really do want to help  
the people, and I think it just makes it a little extra nice, because of the people that we get to care  
for. 
 
AG: Absolutely.  That makes sense.  And when you think about your career, how do you think  
about your role in patient care or patient advocacy as a nurse, or what do you think generally  
nurses role in patient care and advocacy is? 
 
RS: I think we have the biggest role in patient care and advocacy, because we spend the most  
time with the patients, which is something that they tell you all the time.  We’re the ones always  
catching things.  I mean, I’ve caught things so many times that the physicians would never see,  
because, honestly, you have to be fair to them.  They don’t spend the time with the patients that  
we do, so we really are the eyes, the ears, the nose, and mouth, everything for the physicians, and  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
19 
2020012 Nursing America’s Veterans 
the pharmacists too.  The buck stops at nursing, because whether it’s a medication, treatment,  
whatever it is, we’re the last one between that and the patient, and we spend the most time with  
the patient.  We see what’s going on with them.  We know how they are, so I think obviously the  
patient is always number one for knowing themselves the best.  Nursing is definitely up there  
too. 
 
[59:38] AG:  That makes great sense.  This is the last question.  Is there anyone you think of as a  
professional mentor or some people who have helped you in your career and your education  
specifically? 
 
RS: Oh, I have several mentors that I’m so appreciative for.  My mom being one.    She has  
[01:00:01] always guided me well in my nursing career even if I didn’t listen to her.  Layla  
Cobid (ph), she was one of my nursing professors at Westchester Community College.  She was  
a mentor.  She was the one that actually motivated me and invited me to join my sorority, Chi  
Eta Phi Sorority, Inc., and she has just been such an asset such as education, higher education.   
She has always been so encouraging, offered such great advice.  I have to say my number one  
mentor at the VA has been Connie Jordan.  She was my manager on acute psychiatry.  She has  
worked at the VA for years, and she’s ones of those people that you meet her and you can’t help  
to be touched.  She is such a genuine, amazing person, and there’s no nurse that she will not try  
to help.  If you come, you have the right attitude, and she sees that you care and you want to  
grow as a nurse, she’s gonna help you, and especially with a system as big and -- sometimes it’s  
get overwhelming to navigate at the VA, having those mentors is critically important.  If  
that’s one thing that I could say to new nurses or nurses coming into the VA, even if you’re not a  
new nurse but you’re new to the VA, find a good mentor to help you navigate the system,  
because you need it. 
 
AG: Absolutely.  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, Renee.  Is there  
anything you want to add before we say goodbye? 
 
RS: I think in totality, one day, maybe when I’m 80 or something, or even after me when  
people is looking back it, I just hope that we’re judged fairly and people take the good with the  
bad. 
 
AG: Right.  Absolutely.  Thank you so much, Renee.  It was such a pleasure to talk with you. 
 
RS: Thank you.  It was great.
