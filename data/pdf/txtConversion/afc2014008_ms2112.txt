Thank you for your kind introduction. You know,  it's
 
really hard not to think of Ralph as still over in his house
 
on Capitol Hill,  u ttering -
-
 he was forever  u ttering -
-
 in
 
his chair like  some helium-filled balloon,  longing to fly,
 
held down to earth only by the cord of his telephone always
 
at the ready,  panting to pick it up,  eager to hear the
 
excitements,  the problems,  the complexities of the day,  ready
 
to spread the word,  bursting with ene2gy and life.
 
Instead here we all are,  friends gathered from all over
 
the country,  a really motley bunch of us,  people who haven't
 
seen each other for thirty years,  some people who don't even
 
know each other but who knew Ralph in only one of his many
 
roles and enthusiasms.  We are together because of a single
 
remarkable man -
-
 and,  not  incidentally,  because of a single
 
remarkable woman,  Ralph's wife,  Kate -
-
 to spend two days  in
 
celebration of a remarkable life.
 
Now,  I confess that word,  celebration,  stopped me  for a
 
long time.  I just couldn't quite deal with it,  and I finally
 
decided,  being an old academic,  to go back to basics.  I
 
looked up the catalogue of the  1992  Smithsonian exhibition
 
called Celebrations,  and there was the anthropologist Victor
 
Turner's  statement.  He said,
 
"All societies  celebrate.  They mark with ceremony
 
and ritual,  in places and times  separated from everyday
 
routine,  their triumphs,  joys,  and even sorrows."
 
So this  is what we do today.  We are assembled here,  in a
 
place and time  separated from everyday routine,  to mark the
 
life of our beloved friend,  Ralph Rinzler,  and by doing so,
 
see to it that his  ideas and his principles will not be
 
forgotten.
 
And that  idea of marking took me back  in time,  right
 
back to 1975 when I first moved to Washington and Ralph took
 
me on a walk across the National Mall to show me the lay-out
 
for the Bi-Centennial Festival of American Folklife.  He said.
 
"Bess,  I want to tell you some of the things  I
' ve  learned in
 
the past  years about how to run festivals;  there aren't very
 
many of them but  I know they work "
 And he gave me an
 
extraordinary and,  to me,  totally unexpected series of
 
observations:
 
In the first place,  he said,  never bring in big name
 
artists.
 Oh they' re wonderful,  they're great themselves,  but
 
if you have big names,  most of the people who come to your
 
festival will have come to hear their man or their woman.  And
 
no matter how wonderful the other artists are,  the audience
 
won't open their hearts quite all the way to them,  they won't
 
be be attending to them with their whole hearts.  I want
 
people to come to the Festival wondering what exciting things
 
might happen,  what terrific music that next band might play.
 
I want an open-hearted audience.
 
And next,  anywhere you stand on the festival grounds  (
in
 
big festivals  like this one)
 you ought to be able to see or
 
hear at  least three different really interesting and
 
attractive things going on -
-
 over here a gong orchestra and
 
whoever heard anything like that? and over there a string
 
band and you  just adore string band music,  and over here
 
there's  some people dancing and maybe you could get in and do
 
it too.  When there are truly a lot of really enticing
 
activities to choose  from,  most people will  sort of drift
 
towards the least crowded one,  where they see a chance to get
 
up close and see and hear better and maybe even talk with the
 
performers.  And so you don't need so much outside crowd
 
control,  because you crowd controls  itself.
 
Then,  be  sure that there is always  sufficient
 
nutritious,  palatable and economical food and drink available
 
at all times throughout the festival.  Ralph told me years
 
later that he thought he might go down in history as the
 
first man to makd fresh fruit available for sale on the
 
national Mall,  through the Baltimore Arabbers and that
 
gentleman who organized ths  stands where you can get  fresh
 
squeezed orange  juice and lemonade and limeade.  And a few
 
years ago,  when  I retired,  the Smithsonian Festival folks
 
gave me a lifetime supply of coupons  for free limeades during
 
all the Festivals to come;  it was one of my most  favorite
 
presents.
 
And then Ralph's  last  rule was:  take whatever your sound
 
budget  is and triple  it.  This music deserves to be heard,  and
 
the people deserve to hear it the way it really is.
 
Now that was a conversation held 20 years ago,  but it  is
 
as  fresh in my mind as ever because,  I think,  it was  such a
 
succinct  summary of many of Ralph's basic principles put to
 
work.  He really used his principles,  he built them into
 
everything he ever did -
-
 inclusiveness,  getting everybody
 
possible in,  open heartedness,  generosity,  healthiness,
 
concern with physical and mental program content,  true care,
 
real carefulness.  To spend two days considering these basic
 
and humane values,  to try to work out  in our own minds ways
 
in which they can be made evidennt  in our own work,  whether
 
it be aesthetic or political or economic or  just day to day,
 
will make this a true celebration.
 
I think it will be a valuable time for us all,  and I
 
wish us  joy in it.
