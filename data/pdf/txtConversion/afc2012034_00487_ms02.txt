INTERVIEW LOG 
 
 
Interview with Saudi Burton August 19, 2013 Saratoga Racetrack Saratoga, NY  
 
00 Saudi speaks about the beginnings of her interest in horses. She became interested at 13 years 
old and she went to the Belmont Racetrack at age 16 and asked Allen Jerkens for a job. She 
started as a hotwalker, then a groom, and then was an exercise rider for 20 years.  
 
2:17 She talks about her initial thoughts of becoming a trainer and her attempts to become a 
trainer.  
 
2:49 It's mostly luck and connections. If you don't know nobody, you're not that lucky you don't 
get it. But if you know people and you know connections... It can happen most any kind of way, 
but mostly luck and connections. It's who you know, not what you know. There's a lot of that in 
the horse racing business.  
 
3:20 Saudi talks about the role of the horse owner in choosing a trainer. She talks about being 
rejected by horse owners and the feeling that owners thought that she was crazy for asking them 
to be their trainer. She says that the rejection is first because she is an African American, and 
second, because she is a woman. She says that it is hard for a woman to be a horse trainer, but 
especially for African Americans.  
 
5:25 Saudi talks of other horse trainers who are African American – there are four or five men: 
Cleveland Johnson, Peter Chin, Curtis (doesn't know his last name), Phil Scott. They are all 
based at Belmont and have only 3 or 4 horses. Curtis has the most with 8 horses. Saudi says that 
African Americans are locked out because owners don't want a person of color next to them in 
the paddock. She says that she has heard owners say that African Americans and Latinos don't 
look good next to them in the paddock. She says that when she has asked owners for an 
opportunity to train they have acted as if she was out of line for asking. She talks about another 
owner who directed her to work with inner city kids around horses, in a non-profit organization, 
which he has founded.

9:00 She talks about giving her card to an owner and seeing him throw it away.  
 
9:30 She is now a 'gap attendant'. She talks about ceasing to ride and then getting a job with the 
New York Racing Association (NYRA). A gap attendant takes the horses names and the trainer's 
horses and then calls in the time to the clocker, so that they can time the horses workouts.  
 
10:57 Saudi worked in the backstretch for 28 years. She is working as a gap attendant while she 
seeks a job as a trainer. She was also an assistant trainer under Allen Jerkens. However, she is 
trying to acquire a horse to train. She sees others who make the connections with owners and 
now are training.  
 
12:11 She knew at age 13 that she wanted to be a horse trainer. She is still trying.  
 
12:35 Allen Jerkens first encouraged her to go to college and then, when he realized how 
important it was to her, he encouraged her in her work with horses. He taught her a lot of things.  
 
13:15 Saudi talks about traveling in her attempts to get horses to train. She travels and hands out 
resumes and cards. She learned a lot from Allen Jerkens in the 25 years she galloped for him.  
 
14:05 She talks about other African American female athletes, like Serena Williams, who are an 
inspiration to her.  
 
14:40 She has been trying to train for 8 1/2 years. She is hopeful.  
 
15:00 She talks about the racetrack and the horses.  
 
15:30 She talks about riding a horse and it's making her feel at peace.  
 
15:49 She says she didn't know anyone else in Brooklyn who rode. There was no horse racing 
connection at all with people in her family or neighborhood.  
 
16:30 She used to see Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in Central Park, and others on TV, who were 
riding and that influenced her to want to ride. It was expensive. When she came to the track, she 
could ride for free.  
 
17:40 Saudi learned how to ride at Allen Jerkens' stable. She talks about how he showed her how 
to ride, starting on one pony and then progressing through more difficult horses. Allen Jerkens' 
training methodology was to put her on more and more difficult ponies (3 of them) and then on a 
race horse.

18:16 She said that Willie Riley took her to Allen Jerkens and he said that he'd teach her. Willie 
Riley was an African American groom. She stayed with Allen Jerkens and learned how to ride. 
They call Allen Jerkens the Chief, Big Red.  
 
19:12 She talks a little about nicknames at the track: Cowboy, Paycheck. You don't know 
anybody's real name.  
 
20:22 Saudi says that the track is a hard place to be and you have to know how to maneuver 
because you can fall victim to drugs, alcohol, hopelessness. The good part is the horses, but there 
is a dark side that you have to be careful about. People are away from home and their families. 
She says that she escaped that. She sees people she knew in 1985 and she can't believe how 
depressed they are. She talks about people being hurt from a horse and then becoming depressed. 
She said she was strong enough and had family around, so she escaped that. She used to live on 
the backside.  
 
21:50 She talks about losing her housing when she stopped working for Allen Jerkens.  
 
22:24 She says that there are two sides to the track: the glory and the down side. As soon as you 
can't work anymore, you lose your place to live and that for some, that may be all that they 
know.  
 
23:08 She says there are interesting characters and interesting horses. She came here right from 
High School and has been here ever since.  
 
23:40 She says when she started, in 1980, people loved the horses and loved working with them. 
Now, it is all about the money. She says that the game changed. The owners don't really care 
anymore. Now, the owners are fly-by-night. She talks favorably about a specific female owner – 
Mrs. Wolfson of Harborview Farm - who came into the stables and asked questions and checked 
on their horses. The help has also changed. Used to have African American men who were 
horsemen and loved the horses. Now, there are newer immigrants, and some are here just for a 
paycheck. The horses are treated differently.  
 
25:50 She says it changed around 1983. In her opinion, it changed for the worse. People cared 
for the horse differently and loved what they were doing. She doesn't see people currying a horse 
anymore. People took time and now its rush, rush, rush.  
 
27:40 She says that an owner can't oversee 100 horses. When there are trainers with so many 
horses, they prevent others from getting an opportunity. Saudi says that horse racing is a dying 
sport. People aren't paying attention to it. Spectators aren't coming out any more.

29:24 She talks about going to the horse races at Ascot in Great Britain. She says that they really 
treated horses much better. They are treated better also in Dubai.  
 
30:11 Saudi went to Dubai four times. She asked for a job there and she was told that she was 
qualified, but no one has given her a job yet. She says that they care more about the horses in 
Dubai, England, and France than they do in the USA.  
 
32:20 Saudi says that Allen Jerkens would keep the same schedule and routine on a race day as 
they did on any other day. She said that Allen Jerkens is the best horseman. She says that 
whistling and talking to horses is the best, and rubbing them. Horses understand. She says that 
when horses act up, you have to talk to them. Now, riders don't talk to the horses.  
 
34:24 Saudi talks about going to a career coach. She was advised to keep striving towards her 
goal. She took the job as a gap attendant to be able to stay with the horses. She has always 
worked only in New York State, with Allen Jerkens. She is networking now, trying to get a break 
to train. Shes been traveling to see how other countries operate within racing. She went to all 
levels of tracks.  
 
38:10 Saudi talks about the horses and other people that are passing by us, as we sit trackside.  
 
39:14 Saudi says that on the racetrack, you're always moving around. Everybody knows each 
other – its like a big family. She says that you can go away for ten years and come back and 
you'll know someone. She says that there are more women trainers this year.  
 
40:40 She says that maybe her struggle is making a space for someone else. We talk again about 
large stables and Saudis desire to have an opportunity to train.  
 
42:52 She talks about Walter Payton, the football player, and the prejudice that he suffered. It 
just makes me stronger.  
 
44:00 She said her name is Saudi for a reason.
