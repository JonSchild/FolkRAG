Left about 2:00 on basic orientation tour of a rea north of 
Doughton Park. Mr. and Mrs. Roy Shaw,Mia near Edmonds, NO (but 
in Grayson Go.), said Tom Davis—near them—still vorkes with 
horses. Tom Davis is Luther Davis’s brother. (Luther is fiddler, 
ex-auctinneer for Parsons Land C0, featured on Rounder LP 0058). 
Did’t visit. Photographed some cabbage fields near there, 
owned by NC manXX named Anders. Continued toward Glade Creek, 
toured school there started in 1909 by Presbyterians. Talked 
briefly with Jean, the Admissions Director. Apparently no 
mission school craft programs in early 1900s. Continued on 
parralie ling Parkway. Photos of Pleasant Grove Uninn Bapt.

Prior to this, talkedviiile with Mr. Dean Pruitt,a successful-- 
and large by local standards—dairy farmer. He has 3^0 acres, 
90 head cows, one milkig barn, r d brick house. He was born 
and raised insame spot. Each fall he kills two low-producing 
cows for food—or rather sends themtothe slaughter house and 
has it done. jfoXKM Raises no beef cattle at a 11, nor hogs. 
Uses large ground or ,Ibunker,, silo for feed storage. His wife 
is a pparently a prolific canner, putting away most of t he 
vegetables neededf or the winter. Took phots of milk'ng operation 
with Tri-Xand Kodachrome. Entered Pkwya t lower end of Doughton 
rai k, drove t o colfee shop, talked with craft shop clerk and 
wife of Dalton Snow, a banjo maker from Independence who sells his 
wares int he craftshop. His wife is a waitress there. His 
instruments are factory-type, but with some interesting modificati

I got dlrecti ns to his house and xi 11 visit in t he future. 
There were s ome hooked and braided rugs in the shop, supposedly 
loczlly made. Clyde Greed (a woman) knows more local crafts¬ 
people in area, but only works in the AM. Returned to motel via 
pkwy.

Visited Kyle Creed (junction cnty. 608 & 612, Carroll), and 
gave him a brass headlight reflector from either Byick or Chev. 
he says, with which he makes clawhammer banjo picking picks. He § 
gave me a list of sawmillers, including:Raymond Creed (Kyle's 
double first cousin) who lives in Lowgap^ Andy Johnson who works 
vi th Ray Creed; Paul Lowe (past Pine Ridge Road off 89 twd Mt 
Airy from Galax on old Lowgap rd about i|. miles); ? Gillespie in 
Pipers Gap (Carroll Co);and Roy and Coy Frost (between Pipers Gap 
and Galax) who both cut and saw their own timber. He says Roy 
and Coy would be real good to visit an talk with—old-timers. 
Kyle also told me about Claude Richardson (Larry's father) who 
supposedly knows a bunch of "unusual" tunes I've never heard 
before. He plays fiddle, lives on Happy Hill Rd, not far from 
Pipers Gap turn-off from 89 twd Mt Airy from Galax. Also told 
me about Eugene Lundy (close kin to Jerry LundyiJX of the Southern 
Mtn Boys) who learned most of his music from his father. Says 
he's good, but "queer as a KKS34X haunt." Lives in Independence 
on the E side. Ask. Although l8d told Kyle and Percy (his wife) 
about this job earlier, they both were inclined to direct me twd 
musicians until I soecificially asked about other type stuff, 
such as sawmillers. I still have this urget 0 visit people 
who have known Kyle for years and get them to tell me "Kyle Creed 
stories." He is almost a living ISgSttg legend, at least 
legendary-type stories circulatefroely about him. Paul 
Sutphin, Fred Cockerham, and Earnest East would be the best people

to stait wi th. 
Left Kyle*3, want across the street and measuBed and photoed 
the Coleman Primative Baptist Church (pBC hereafter). Details 
Include: no sign indicating denomination; no decoration in or 
out; white; no song books visible inside thru windows. (See 
flore plan included with notes). Photoed graveyard which included 
4. wooden markers (both head and foot). X Qommon stone motifs 
were finger pointing up and shaking hands. Most, however, were 
plain. 
Continued down mtn to Lambsfeurg on cnty 620, right in Lambsburg 
to Chestnut Grove PB5T on 696. Measured a nd photoed it (see 
accompanying floor plan). The old, plain, white church hS is 
there, but a new,steepled (though small), and plastic stained glass, 
red brick church has been built across tiie s fcreet. I also measured 
it (see sheet). I was unable to see insidethe new church. The 
old one had long tables for diner on the grounds in inclememt 
weather. It was free of decoration. Ehe graveyard (photoed) 
or carved stones, b^th headand f oot stones. I4. large cedars 
in center of graveyard. The old churc$was formed in 1902. 
The new building, besides that already mentioned, had a very low 
eave (relativet 0 old) that was about 7 or 8 ft from ground to 
roof. The Relative demensions of the new were radically different 
fromthe old,but I was unable to even superficially XXftXIX 
compare the insides. 
Aug. 8—p. 3. 
B. Owen 
Grossed into Surry Co., N.C. on Rt. 1603, saw for sal© 
sigh pointing twd what looked like recently abandoned house. 
Turned out to be long abondoned, l|r story saddle bag. Features 
include: very steep stairway up to left of large centreil chimney, 
cabinet space between chimney and stairs, hand-hewn floor joists, 
wide floor boards (no sub floor), double front doors, and n® door 
between back addition and front portion of houseXX (see accompanying 
floor plan). Photoed it as well as man, a Mr. Galyean, and l\. 
kids who chanced by. He says the house built by Newell Stewart 
in about 19014-» a date marked on a brick he found in the blown 
down back chimney. Talked about area crops. Says no dairy in 
immediate area, only some beef, no apples (have to go twd Fancy 
Gap for them he says), but the main crop is bright leaf tob. 
Cosby Golding's store —interviewed him (two reels— 
BR8-B0-R1 & 2) about store running, ag, etc. General interest 
stuff rather than specific. Very cooperative, well informed, 
especially about catching, cooking, a^d eating turtles (pronounced 
"turkle" by him). Took some flash, color photos. Store located 
near 1603 and 1602 junction, S of above mentioned house. He 
tells a couple of interesting Ben Jarrell stories, who was 
friend of his fathers. His old store is very small, one over 
one. Main seller is beer. Some of most interesting stuff he 
talked about was barter trading his father did (not d one i&nce he 
took overstore, 1935)* Father told whether eggs good or bad by 
puting in spring box; if they flaat they're bad, if the sink 
they're good; if they turn on end while on bottom, they are 
going bad.

B. Owen 
Turned SE on 1605, measured &}UlX|&K)BLIXa Round Peak Prim. 
BC—no photoss, raining hard. (See accompanying floor plan). K5S 
Founded 1825* Three windows/side, double centrald oors, no 
decoration in or out, ns song books in sight thru windows, cinder 
block stuckoed over. 
Addition to Kyle Creed visit: How he cures groundhog hide to 
make banjs head... 
Put 1 gal^in a 2 gal bucket—not galvanized. Mix in about 1 
white lime. Soak hide 2-3 days or until can easily pull hair 
off. Pull hair off. Soak in clear water—change at least every 
day--fer 3 days. (Says good to put in creek, but turtles likely 
to eat it). Nail hige on board, flesh side up. stfetch tight as 
can. Scrape flesh off (this is worst, most messy part). Wash 
again, and put on banjo. 
2nd method: 
Make 2” thick layer of hard wood ashes (oak or hickory best), 
wet. Lay hide on flesfe side down. Cover with 2" more wet ashas. 
Keep wet til hair pulls off. Then do as above. Makes point 
that this method makes the hide dirty looking, vheras other way 
makes hide whiter.

Visited Mrs. Pierce, wife ef woodc^rver-artist 
contacted by Gerri Johnson. She is a moving lady, though 
full of g ood humor as well. Her husbands werk is excellent— 
an honest to God self-taught artist. XI (See GJ's notes for 
more complete notes about him a nd her). 
MO and I Headed twd Perrum, but never made it. Measured and 
photoed ca. 1900-1910, fake l|- story house. Dormers on fronfe 
dec®, only—no stairway up in entire house, except for very small 
crawlway into addition attic. (See accompanying floor plan). 
The house apparently wwned by a Ray BedsaulXXXXX whl lives 
twd Iron Ridge. Lady we talked with would not open door to 
do more t han holler at us. The house is IXXKMXliS located on 
cnty 72ij. just E of Galax. The area between Galax and Fancy Gap 
has only few applea (esp to the W of t his section; no dairy; 
no tob; mostly beef. 
Junction 683 & 701, unmarked, but prob. EX PBC. Pouring rain, 
hence no measure or photo. No visible song books, yellow flower 
centerpiece front of podium, n® otherdec® inor ®ut. Across the 
•treet was large cabbage field. 
Lunched in Hillsville, headed S on US 52. Left On 906 and 
926. Photoed I hs junction 926 & 863; no measure. Near junction 
670 & 683, photoed and Measured "Old Baptist Snake Creek Church." 
(Man across road so said). Told us church used by two groups— 
one meets 1st Sun, other 2nd Sun. "Preacher Corn" is fr*** 1st Sun 
preacher. Should talk with Elder Blaine 
Goad for more info about ch. Ch whiteframe, large si^e a nd

some small, hard bound song beaks in bex behind podium )6& in 
chancel (?). KXX&SX2K Had pests (2) in canter, atov# (ceal) 
in center. No dece ex. flewers front SffiXfiXMJ&i&X and either side 
ef pedium. (See acc, floer plan). 
Cent. E on 670 & 680 to junct 680 & 677 'hare stepedat 
Iroler’s Store. Talked with Mrs. Mae Iroler, a very talkative 
coop rative woman, about stuff in thearea. He husband,Clint®n, 
in a fiddler and banjo player of modest ability. He is a 3LSX# good 
hli old-time flatfoet dancer. He also tells interesting personal 
experience stories, eap those about KIX a Mr. Barr, an old man 
Clinton hung around with when he eas a youngster. Mrs* Iroler 
told us of a Guynn lady near whe quilts, and John Cassell (pronounced 
Castle) who quilts. Mr. Cassell came t estere, where MO learned he 
feegan in order to get exercise for heart condition by using 
treadle machine to quilt on. Mrs. Iroler says h4s quilts are 
"very pretty." A young woman told us her grandfather, S.D. Vaughn 
of near Austinville (Laurel Community^, is a good chair bottomer. 
We also learned of John Phillips of Dugspur, abt 85 yrs old, who 
is supposed to be good clawhammer bjo player, as well as mandolin, 
and others. Took lots of photos, both flash B&W and color as 
well as available light. Pushed 1 roll Tri-X to 1600. The store 
la (Rt 2, Fancy Gap, Gladebor® Comm), is obviously the fecal point 
f or t he comm. While we were ther, people continually droping in, 
sitting, talking, telling fox hunting tales, and just general 
bull-shiting. Though not taped, would be good spot to get 
your "general store activity" tape. 
Returned home via Pkwy.

Thiirs. 10 Aug. '78 Stayed in to catvh up with notes. 
Fri. 11 Aug. '78 
Left for temporary quarters in Mt Air£ abt noon via 89. There is a nice 
log barn on the Galax side of Beulah School, rt. 89. Noticed that the crops 
in this stretch are flue-cured t obacco & lots of corn. The number of remnant 
and mill outlet stores dramatically increases from about Pine Ridge on into 
My Airy. 
Talked w/county Ag agent Charles Jackson in Surry Co seat, Dobson. 
Very cooperative, though not at all sure about what we were after. He is 
naturally geared twd agribusiness and less knowledgeable abott the smaller 
family farms. He did, however, outline on my county map IMX&&MX crop 
areas. He made the point that there were only abt 2 ac of burley tob. in 
the entire county, and that is located in the southwestern part of t he 
region—out of the region of study. This area of NC has not developed much 
of a fruit market,■ hence not MM many large orchards. He noted that 
in Va the situation was different—they have a good market system, hence 
large producers. My experiencewith Mr. Jackson reaffirmed my desire to 
visit the co. agent in each county of study for such background info. Though 
not always fully understanding of our purpose, they are accurate about what 
they do know aid willing to be of help. 
Returned to Mt A. by way of Stjrart (patrick Co) XM via rt 103. Stopped 
at Mitchell's Mill (photoed by Filers) justacross NC/?a border of 103. 
Talked with some young men w o directed us to another, larger, older mill 
on the Dan River just across border into Stokes Co, NC. Proceeded there 
via 103, right on 662, left lli32 to'Messup Mills". Large, 2^ story mill, 
ca. early 1900s I guess. Photoed and rough measured it. Not able to get 
inside for operator (who lives a cross street) was notab home. This mill. 
m iiAug 
though OTA would be a nice place to photograph. It is still a working, 
local operation—one not run completely ofct of business by the large, 
town located, exchange mills. 
Returned to Mt Airy via 103. 
Sat. 12 Aug. &8 (cont) 
B. Owen 
Cruised Patrick Co, Va area with MO and Rusty Marshall. Talked about 
general aspects of the region, questioned some X&X of the operative 
proceedures of the Folklife Cntr. 
Sun. 13 Aug. '78 
Left Mt Airy about 10 am for Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church, 
Snake Creek section, Carroll Co., Va. Went via rt !?2, right on 682, left 
6?U. On the way I noticed some cabbage aid nice older farm bldgs. 
Service order: 
11:00—11:1*0—Intro spiel by Burlie Newman (preacher). Fancy Gap, Va. 
Hymn #281* (all hymns from the Braadman Hymnal (shaped 
note ed), Nashville, TN, 19l*0 ed. 
Offering (almost no change hit the plate except mine). 
Song by 8 mamber choir. (I don't recall the name, but 
it is one Orna Ball sings lead on in the BRI 
documentary about ECand Orna's music). With piano 
XSSX accompaniement. 
Short talk by preacher, welcoming again all those 
present. 
Song by 3 sisters. "It's Me Again Lord." Unacc. 
Pitched low, no harmony. 
Another song by same—"Great is Christ in my Heart." 
Unacc. Low. 
11:1*0—12:10—Serman. Based on 5th Ch. John, 28th vs. 
Reading of Scripture above. 
Prayer by preacher. Only he kneltj congregation 
v3. 
I'b 
Sun. Aug. '78 (cont) 
either sits or leans forward. 
Re-emphasis of importance of scripture read before. 
Beginning of preaching proper. Slips into moderate 
chant early,and continues to slip in aid out of 
it several times during preaching. He uses no 
notes, very little lateral movement, lots of 
right hand pointing—both up and twds people. 
There w as only an occasional, very quiet, •’Amen." 
12 slO—12:15?—Hymn #25it by congregation. 
The service ended with an announcement £MXX that there would be a 
KXjrerKTKgyxxffiKKX baptismalservice at 2:30 iSfflr KK at the creek just 
this side of the Snake Creek Primitive Bapt. Ch. 
I was s truck with how similar -this servide was to those primitive 
Baptist ones I've attended. It was very reserved. The main difference were: 
1) Use of choir, however moiest. 
2) Preference for modern songs. 
3) Use on piano acc. 
Collection of offering. 
In talking with Burlie Newman after t he service while eating some luncft 
under the trees, he indicated that the main difference between the Primitive 
Bapts and the Missionary Bapts was one of order, and less a doctrinal 
one. I'm not sure I buy this generalization, however, for the supporting 
of Missions, for example, isnot done by Primitive Baptists. Also, Newman's 
serman, as well as later comments, implied that the Primitive Bapts essential 
belief in being "saved by Grace" is not strictly dictated by the Scriptures. 
Newman especially disliked the way—as he saw it—the primitive Baptists

Sun. Aug. ’78 (cont) 
Had lunch with MO & TE in Fancy Gap. 
Departedfrom MO & TE, returned twd Pleasant Grove Ch. Photoed and measured 
'•Hall House" on 6?iu House two stor£ log, emptyj corn crib two-pen log—very 
nice} spring house frame, fallen in} cellar house nice. Made rough map of 
entire farm, measured all bldgs. (See acc. plans).

split over the least cause, primarily ones of order, not doctrine. 
During lunch I went up the road past the Snake Creek Prim Bapt Ch and 
photoed the Snake Creek Store, a nice, large, 2 story frame structure. 
At 2:30, met with TE and MO for the Baptizing. Recorded it, up untill 
Newman about to totally emerse the woman. At this point the recorder r an 
out of tape. It was inadvertantly left in the l5 ips position, hence ran 
out 1E> mins before anticipated. So goes field work. TE toke bunchof photoes, 
but wants to get in the water next time. Take up reel also acraped the lid, 
so had to hold it open with my fingerSX. 
Order of Baptising: Abotit half of the people present (perhaps 30) 
go down to the creekj the remainder stays up on the read on top of the culvert. 
The culvert, i cidentally, had to be ^locked up with plywood dams in order 
for thereto be enough water to totally emerse in. I suppose the 
people down where these to be baptized are friends and family. "Shall We 
Gather at the River" sung (led by tone deaf song leader). Reading of Scripture 
(don't recall passage). Prayer by Newman; a nice, long one. One verse 
of"Shall We Gather" sung again while Newman talking with the couple (newly 
weds) being baptized. He and helper leads the couple down into the creek. 
The girl, incidentally, saw a snake swim by, told Newman about it, who replied, 
he's gone now. (This is where tape ran out). Baptism done, dry off a little, 
go home. 
Pastor Bufclie NewmanKX has about 15 yrs experience "pastoring". This is 
2nd time he's been working this church. 
Mon. llj. Aug. *78

Some note catching up til 2:00pm. Left for Hassell Handy’s (Patrick 
Co., Va) 2:15. Location: From Stuart, S on 8, rt on 631 ("Dobyns Road”), 
about 3 hss before large 'Presbyterian Ch on hill on right. 
On the way stoped in Vesta (on US58) and found out who pastor of 
Vesta Pentacostal Holiness Ch is. It is Lawrence Dawson who drives down from 
Begford/Franklin Co area (Smith Mtn Lake) each Wed nite. Sat and Sun morning. 
He has radio show on WHEO (WHOE?), Stuart, Sat 2:30-3:00. 
Should revisit the "1911 Dobyns Baptist Church". It is Primitive Bapt. 
Half mile past Ch is old mill, prob. early 20th cent, no longer run; stoped 
about 5 yrs ago. 
Spent two hrs with Hassell Handy, his mother Crystal, and brother's 
son Charles. Both Hassell and his mobher are good, knowledgeable talkers. 
She cooks on wood, boils water for jar sterilizing on open fire with tin 
over it, drys bottles of bottle rack outside. Made arrangements to meet 
Hassell the next day at New Farmer's Tob. Warehouse for first day of sales. 
He told me about Moir Hill of the Dry Pond section, who grows large crop of 
tob and cultivates with horses and mules. 
The Handy's are good contacts and should be interviewed about a variety 
of topics. He is about mid-50ish, she's prob. abt 20 yes older. Photoed 
HH, CH, and CH around the placej ie: feeding chickens, etc. Though house 
not striking, the entire layout should be gone over. 
Returned to Galax via 631, 6k6, * 103, & 89. 
?• 
Wed. 16 Aug. '78 B. Owen 
Left abt 9’h^ for Martin Farm (US58 btwn Hillsville & Laurel Fdirk, 
Carroll Co., Va.)iX with Marshall & Filers. 
Measured down stairs of house while HM measured log corn crib (double 
pen) and Filers took photoes. XXIXXXMM 
Abt 1:00 left for Iroler's Store where CF & Mo were setting up video 
tane equip. Played banjo for Clinton Iroler and Burl 
to dance by. After this, went to New Fellowship PBC on 677 abt 2 mi from 
Iroler's. Photoes and measured (see floor plan). Elder of New Fe llowship 
is Carbin Vass, on 58 just past Restaurant of rt between Hillsville and 
Laurel Fork. Meets 3rd Sat nite and Sun am. Rex Lewis and wife (photoed 
by Filers in garden) are members of ihe congregation. Has abt 20 members. 
Sing out of "#9" (Old School Hymnal No._$) or Goble's Primitive Bapt ist 
Hymn Book (i££M D.H. Goble Printing Co, Greenfield, IND). #9 has music, 
Goble does not. 
Ret to Galax via K. Creed's. Had supper with them; green beans ("snap 
beans") mixed with corn, mashed pots, fried country ham, tea, milk, coffee, 
cornbread and butter, fresh tomatoes, cucumber, and lettuce. 
The Martin House chimney rock is primarily quartz with a little Schist 
(a nearly black, flat rock made from mud stone by pressure and heat—c. 300- 
ii00 degrees C.). Exposed by erosion. The quartz is a tan, sandy colored 
rock usually found in 5" to 6" layers. Most rock in Galax area 8 million to 
1 billion yrs old. Schist stone could be a fine graindd amphibolite, 
a "cooked up lava flow." Schist judgement from geologist Brock Riedell. 
Amphibolite judgement from geologist ftathlene Galloway, members of team 
in rooms next to ours, at Midtowner Motel.

Left abt 7'b^ for New Farmer’s Warehouse, Mt. Airy. 
Visited Co-Op Warehouse where 1st sr-le of the day was held, with the 
Filers. Stayed abt U5 min. 
Ret. to New Farmer’s. Began recording when gov’t grader began his &X 
work, about 20 min before actual sales started. The govt grader examines 
each bundle of tobacco (weighing from abt loo to 22£Lbs) for waste, color, anfl 
dirt. Based on his experience, he gives it a grade such as ”PljL” which is 
MIMKg 1st priming, Uth grade (’’fair'') of possible 6 grades of quality, 
lemon color. (See attached XMM Tobacco Market Prices sheet for details.). 
A warehouseman following the grader 1hen IXMX assigns the govt support price 
which corresponds with the govt graders judgement of grade. For example, 
PljL has a support price of $.98/lb ($98/lOOwt). The grader this day was 
particularly hard of those bundles having dirt, and in fact, judged some 
bundles so dirtly he would not grade them, hence "NG" or no grade. This year 
farmers were encouraged to leave their first primings (ie: leaves) on the 
plant, and to sell only those above the dirt level, hence cleaner tob. 
Though "they did this in Winston-Salem, Mt Airy XX8MMPQSMK area farmers, 
such as HHandy, did not, hence prices very low. There are some tricks, however, 
to get the best price for his tobacco which the farmer—in cooperation 
withIhe warehouseman—can pull. It is almost a game; the farmer and 
warehouseman (who makes his money from the farmer—2% of total sale) versus 
the govt and buyers. If a bundle is graded lower than the farmer thinks it 
should have bee and is consequently sold for too low a price, he can 
refuse or null the sale and Mf&XiM have the warehouseman 
move the bundle to the end of the sale, ahead of the govt grader, who will

unknowingly regrade it XKJ5^KIXII|KXX, hopefjilly giving it a better grade than 
his initial one, and then the bundle will be resold again based on the 
"new” gradeing. Hassell Handy, in fact, did-this. He was offered $.5>0 the first 
time around, moved his bundle (one of abt 9)> had it regraded, and sold it 
at about $.7^/lb. 
The general consensus this M first day of sales was "not as good as 
last year." Most grumblings were about why certain bundles were graded one 
grade and another judged differentlyfor no apparent reason. In fact, I 
wasMi struck with the arbitrariness of the entire 35^5 JiX sale procedure. 
The farmer w orks like hell for months, spends hundteds or thousands of 
dollars on his crop,just to have it judged by the govt grader in leas than 
30 sec's, hence, determining the basic price he will receive for all his 
time, effort and money. The company buyers, in turn, examine each bunflle 
less than 10 sec's, before it is either bought or not. It's conceeded by 
thegrowers tobe a highly developed form of gambling.

Here is what happens to XKM each bundle of tobacco: 
1) Farmer unloads it at the warehouse where it is weighedand assigned 
a number, placed on the floor in long rows, and untied to expose the leaves. 
2) Just before sale starts, govt grader goes through, assigns each 
bundle a grade, which is in turn is given a support price. 
3) Auctioneer gets buyers together and begins sale. He is predeeded 
in his row by the warehouseman who hollers the support price marked on the 
tag on each bundle to the auctioneer. The auctioneer begins his call with 
Tues. Aug ?8 
B. Owen 
this price. 
U) Buyers, in row opposite auctioneer, either go up on price or not. 
If the do, the bundle is sold to one of them, (ie: "Sally Ann"«Salem). If 
not, either the warehouseman buys it, or it is sold to "coop", ie: the govt 
buys it for the support price. The pace, with some interupticns, is a 
slow tc moderate walk. (Listen to tape). 
5) As bundle is sold, man behind auctioneer picks up ticket (tag), 
hands it to man behind him who marks the sale price on it and tosses it backwards 
back onto bundle. He also marks to whom sold (ie: 8%“*.89/lb to Leggett & 
Meyers). This burn# is followed by farmers, esp those whose tobacco is being 
currently sold. 
6) After sold, the bundle is taged by employees of the company 
who bought it for shipment. These people (usually young girls just out of 
high school) also mark the grade and price on a seperate list of their own. 
These people are then followed by people who retie the bundles into EMM 
their burlap sheets and thevy are soon moved to the proper loading dock 
by a fork lift. 
Once things get started, the process is very fast. The farmer gets 
his check at thefrent office of the warehouse.

In addition the auction proper (auctioneer was Cecil C. Barker, Rt 2, 
Box U09, Pilot Mountain, NC, 5>0s, considered good by warehouseman), also recorded 
general conversationand comments. Had problems with feed reel on Nagra 
rubbing cover, hence some flutter at times. 
After the sale is well underway and the bundles begin to be moved around 
by the tiers and fork lift, the noise,MM dust, and heat level increases 
dramatically. Drink machines soon empty. 
Left warehouse about 2:30, headed t wd. Galax on 89> stoped at 
Earnest East's, He was not home, so talked while with Fannie East (wife). 
Their house is one of oldest in area. Originally it was "a central hali, one 
story job. 
Went from there to Zion Hill Prim.Bapt. Ch up road from there about 2 mi. 
Photoed, measured, unable to get inside at that time. The popular name for 
this ch is "Crooked Oak Church". Went around curve from ch to Crooked Oak 
gro where I talked a good while with the family who farms there and runs the 
store,.. I originally met them in Feb or March on a cruise through with 
Roddy Moore looking for an old steel wheel tractor. These folks are 
very talkative, full of local info, if perhaps a little modern oriented. 
Found out about s me flat-foot dancers in the region. Ross Martin, who is 
old and has emphazema, is a good one they say. They also told ihe the names 
of the Elders of the Zion Hill and Round Peak Prim Bapt Ch. Donny Wood= 
Zion Hill. Old, crippled. They meet the 3rd Sun & the Sat afternoon before 
at abt 2:30. Charlie Coulson of Widows Peak, VA * R Peak. Didn't know when 
meet. 
Revisited Cosby Golding's storeXX near Crooked Oak section. Heard 
of Herbert Fulk, near Toast, WC (Mt Airy), who was supoibsed to know about 
witches, etc. K8 I was told ab^ut him by two "go d old boys" who drove up 
towing a ford Galaxie, wanted $2 gas in orderto crank it up. It hadn't 
been running in years, but they were confident it would start. I never found 
out if it did. Anyway, they said they had given Fulk a ride home from the 
Mt A^ry hospital, were invited in his house to see the gunCharlie Lawson used 
to kill 6 members of his 3$ family with. Had "grafaphone" splattered with 
blood as well. Also supposed to have lots of old radios and XjpjQiXXXX 
"grafaphones" as well a records. He was described as "unusual", filthy. 
but with a nice personality. 
One of these two men also told me of a witch tale he had been told years 
ago. A man who wanted to run off a woman he didn't like got a witch to help 
him. The witch said someting over a shotgunj the man took the barrell 
and placed it in a creek so the water would run through it, and as the water 
ran through the barrell, ti ran off the woma,. This man doesn't believe it,

Visited Herbert Fulk with PM and intern Harley Joley. Fulk lives near 
Toast, outside of Mt Airy on the W side. Twd Mt Airy from Galax, turn rt 
onto old 89 just before getting to Toast, turn rt behind church, lives in 
house this side of trailer. 
Fulk real Looney Tunes,but goodtalker full of interesting material. 
Knows about witches, ghosts, andother powers, such as how to ease a dying mans 
pain. Has large collection of uGrafaphones", records (78rpm), and radios. 
He has the grafaphone splattered with blood of Lawson family members killed 
by Charlie Lawson. MMMXMXKIMXMXtM£)ffiCIgXt#KIMKXK&XM£$K. 
XKffXKXWXyfflKXXXXX Groans of death can be heard (supposedly) on the record 
that was on the machine when Lawson did i his family. Fulk also has this 
record and played it for us. He also has the shotgun supposedly used by 
Charlie to kill the 6 people on his family. IK On it are marks where he 
bashed out their brains. Even the barrell has been dented through to the 
inside b the blows. He also has the 78 "The Murder of the Lawson Family" 
sung by the Carolina Buddies (Columbia 15^37-L). The shotgun is a 12 ga. 
single barrell. Recorded three tapes of almost continual, uninterupted 
talk. 
Left for Mabry Mill where helped complete video taping of dancer 
Luther Boyd being done by MO and CF. Left sonn with M0. We stopped and 
talked with Elder Carbin Vass (New Fellowship PBC). He says OK to photo 
or tape any service, ^e told us of a foot washing com union service at the 
laurel Fork PBC the Uth Sun in Aug. Elder Vass smokes, likes the newer 
songs and styles (talks negatively of those who sing only few tunes for fcymns 
in LM (long meter), SM (short meter), or CM (common meter), as well as all 
the others. He uses "#9" shaped note book so anyone can learn the melody.

Departed for Worrell Memorial Prim. Bapt Ch (near Iroler's Store, 
Gladesboro Comm. Carroll Co VA) to meet w/John Cassell (pronounced Castle). 
Arrived, but X gone after cutting grass. Photoed/measured exterior. Ch 
built and established 1950. (See plan). Returned to Iroler's Store, went 
on up to big Lutheran Ch up from store. This ch founded by people who came 
into the co ntry from Wythe County which is in the Shenandoah Valle#.

"soapstone" by Virginia (Ginny) Iroler Lyons's father. The Irolers, she

Attended the Zion Hill Prim. Bapt. Ch (near Pine Ridge Comm, Surry Co, 
NC). The Deacons of the ch would not allow any taping of photos. Theysaid 
it was not against any laws or rules, but was rather against their tradition. 
Later, during the sermon, the preacher (who had not yet met me or talked with 
me about either of the above) made the point that although the church may 
be in the world, the world shoud be kept out of the church. A better 
statement of traditi n could hardly be found. 
This is the most conservative, old fashioned Prim Bapt Ch I've ever 
attended. The old, main Elder, Donny Wood, is about 92. A visiting preacher 
was a Brother Hawks, I don't know from where. There were 9 men and lit women 
in the congregation, all but 7 in the deacon’s rows, menand women. These 
numbers exclude MO and BO. 
The entire service was "heavy" and preoccupied with death more than I've 
ever heard. The atmosphere was dense. Whether the small number of people 
amplified this, I don't know (many of the members had attended a com union 
service near there). T^e main preaching and service conducting was by a 
younger man (c. 1|0) whose n^me I never learned. His message dealt with 
the reaffirmation of the church's doctrine—ie: one is saved by grace and 
grace alone. His style was somewhat more personal than s me I've seen, 
he addressed the other two men in the chancel area (brother Woodj&abd 
Hawks) most of the time, as well as the Deacons on the first deacon row. 
He also SKSIK shook hands often, while preaching, both with the Deacons as 
well as with i£MXXMXMiiXM MXMSIXMMXX Wood and Hawks. When he addressed 
people individua'ly, the/ often responded with a very quiet "that's right" or 
"uh huh" 
An unusual aspect of this service was that the visiting preacher. Hawks, 
got up, ta ked some about how it was a wqste of time to try to preach 
if God hadn't blessed him with the message, said God hadn't blessed him this 
day, and sat down. The other preacher tenddd to address KM to his left. 
While praying, he faced left and rocked back and forth. When preaching 
he addressed people to his left, XI walHed to his left, and shook hands 
with people to his left. He was, however, a two-handed preacher, whereas 
Brother Wood was strictly a right handed one. 
They sing rut of the Goble book (Primitive Bapt Hymn Book published and 
sold by the D.H. Goble Publishing Co, , IND). They sing 
the old songs the old way. Their style is even more slow and the words 
and syllables more broken up (split) than the Little River Prim Bapt Ch 
stuff of the Bapt. Bible Hout IPs. The singing is not, perhaps, quite as 
ornamented as the Little River st yle. (See MO's notes for service order, 
hymn seledtions, further notes about the service).. 
Akers Revival, tent, across street from Steer House Restaurant, 
58 E, Galax, Va. It is immediately noticable that the people who come to 
this service are of a different cut fromthosethat goto the more conservative 
churches, such as the Prim Bapt. By cXMMX consertative, I am refering to 
the service order and procedure as well as doctrine. The attire is more 
flashy, less formal—more like sat. night dance wear rather than going to ch 
cloths or cleaned up overalls. The preacher, Robert Akers, Hil^sville, 
drives a ca. 1973 white Cadillae with t he grill slightly smashed, the rear 
end dented, and rusted out a little along the bottom. He hauls his ftmps, 
guitars, etc, in the trunk. Q3f I were a Sociologist, I might say that these 
pan; 20 Aug (cont) p.3 
B. Owen 
people are of a lower socio/economic class. Most probably lower level 
factory/industry workers or young off the farm types. This sounds sort of 
negative andcondescending, but a picture must be drawn. Some of these peopel 
have what has been called the "gas station mentality." 
Akers himself is a sharp, alert, quick moving man who is a contractor 
during the day. He has a Pentacostal Holiness Ch on 221 N. of Hillsville, 
just past the 100 turn off. It is made of blue sheet metal. In talking with 
Mr. W.N. Moses (8l) who used to run a tent revival circuit in W. Va, but 
is now retired and lives in the Patterson Comm, on 100 N. of Hillsville, I 
found that a tent the SliX size of the one used by Akers costs about $5$00 
to $6000 dollars and has a life expectancey of 5 to 7 yrs, depending on 
care, etc. The tent is about 8? feet lohg, shaped in an oval. |4 ‘ ^ e.ZS’l-VpU.

B. Owen 
Akers works a circuit that has a distance from Hillsville of shout 
lOOmi max. He continues towork days at his "regular" job and also continues 
to serve his "regular" church on Sundays. Needles to say, he XMMIM says 
he sometimes get run ragged, but it's all the Lord's work. His circuit 
goes more to the southwest of Hillsville than to the E and nofcth. North Wilksboro 
is about as far as he goes.

Left to prime and string tobacco at Tim and Sally Slste's (631 W of 
Stuart, Pateick Co., VA). Was accompanied bjr Intern Arnold Schofield. 
When we arrived, Tim (whose tob was being worked this day), and the rest of 
the bunch (which included Hassell Handy, Burnie , Benton Moorefield 
(Tim's father in law I believe), Lisa Slate (sister), Benton's wife 
Beech Slate (uncle) 
This was the 2nd priming and there will be about 5-6 more before the 
end of the season. Priming consists of breaking two or t hree or sometimes 
four of the bottom most leases off the plant, tucking them under the left 
arm (if the person is right handed), and continuing untill loaded enough 
to put in the wagon—often still called a "slide". The JSMSKflX process is 
very fast and about 2-3 seconds is all it takes XX per plant. After a slide 
is filled, it is taken to the barn where it is to be strung and hung and another 
is ferought back in its place. While there I took bunches of photos and 
recorded the sounds, including some talk as well as brief interviews about 
the process and how it has changed ovet the years. I found out during this 
visit that Beech Slate is renowned among this group as A a tale teller, and 
so he is. He prides XX himself for his ability to stretch the truth or 
tell lies, MM meaning exagerated or very colorful stories about a variety 
of subjects, including making liquor during his youth. 
The tob is planted in "terraces", each terrace consisting of 6 rows of 
plants, and a drive space between these 6 rows and the next 6 rows. Some 
people plant only h rows and s me as many as 8, but most like six. This makes 
spraying and priming easier and more efficient. 
-v 
22 Aug ?8 (cont) 
B. Owen 
After finishing priming, about 12:20, we all left for Sally Slate's 
home (Tim's motherjx and owner of some of the tob being primed) for dinner. 
Mrs. Slate, whose husband, Lem, is dead, prepared a dandy meal. We had 
creamed corn, green beans (called by some—especially Burnie 
"snaps")- sliced tomatoes, boiled pots, cabbage prpparedas slaw, fried 
chicken, fried fat back, bought choc cake and cheese cake w/cherry topring, XM 
and iced tea to drink. Before eating everyone washed up, some using a 
green tomatoe to wash with. IKIX The juice from the tomatoe disolves the 
tobacco tar better than plain soap. 
After dinner we went up to t he bam where the tob was ready to be 
strung and hung. A slide (^agon) is backed close to the stringing machine 
which in turn is situated so the tobacco—as it progresses along the 
conveyor—goes right td> the door of the barn. The tob is taken fromihe slide, 
placed but end toward the conveyor. It is then taken by someone onthe other 
side of the conveyor and placed XXXSXXSX on the moving belt between two 
6" uprights which determine the stick length. When one layer of tob is layed, 
a stick is layed over itand more tob is put on tob of it. The whole mess is 
then moved through a sewing mach:ng like deal—it has a long, dull needle— 
and is sewn together MM&XXg with a stitch s imilar—but coarser—to a feed 
bag stitch. This "stick" of tabacco is them taken off the conveyor,(before it 
falls off) and handed up to the nerson—or persons, depending on how high 
it id being hung—who then habgs it by placing the ends of the stick offer 
the tier poles which runn the length of the barn, (see photos). 
About two people unload the sled, four lay the tob on the conveyor, one 
22 Aug. 78 (cont) 
B. Owen 
unloads the sticks and hands it up to the hangers. The entire process is 
one of continuous activity with no time much to stretch or talk unless the 
conveyor is stoped. Many of the people working considet this job to be 
harder and more tiring than priming. 
I was struck with how closely packed Bright Leaf is put into the barn. 
It is considerably tighter than hurley can be hung, probably because of the 
forced drying method. The slates use gas, but have only recently switched 
over from oil, which is the first replacement for wood. Gas is considered 
the safest heating fuel. 
While stringing tob I was told about Walter Handy who used to make 
baskets and bottom chairs. When we left the Slates we went up to his place 
(about 3 miles from Slates)i$ but found he had gone to Jessup's Mill to have 
feed ground. We proceeded to Jessup's, met Mr Handy, and made arrangements 
to call him when we could visit "him at home. Hancfy is ?8, a srood talker, 
member of the Dobyns Prim Bapt Ch, and an ex liquor maker. 
Porter Jessup. 
Jessup's Mill is run by Mr SMipXlMHUCqiXHSMXii It was built in 
1910 XX a nd was originallu called Union Mill because it was built and owned 
Jessup's 
by a "union" of local people. Today we would callit cooperative. Mr EMMiEIX 
father was the first miller (and only one before taken over by his 
son) because he was the person in the community most familiai with the machinery 
necessaryto run the mill. Porter's father ranthe mill till XK&XiX 1937 at 
which time Porter—who had just graduatecBfXajfi from high school—took it 
over. Although he today works first shift at the local elastic plant just 
down the roak, he also continues to run the mill in the afternoons. He 
does mostly feed, corn meal, corn flour, and some whole wheat flour. He 
sold his flour mill (to make regular, white, bleached flour with) several 
years ago. The oower for the mill is provided by turbine water wheels (see 
22 Aug. 78 (cpnjr) 
B. Owen 
photo of ond one). The turbine drives belts which drive generators, which 
run the machinery. In order to operateHX his hammer mill (located in the 
basement of the Will), he uses a diesal powered generator in order to have 
enough power. 
Returned to Galax via 103 pnd 89.

Left to talk with Grayson Co. Ag Agent about 10:30. Dick Cassell® 
agent. The SE sec1ion of grayson Co produces mostly corn and other hay 
crips. There are some dairies, but beef predominates, with dairy's a close 
2nd. Found out that one reason that MiflfflS dairy fanning in the area has 
declined so much in recent years is because of MpiXXXIXX US Govt regulations. 
In order t o be graded Grade A, a farm must meet certain bldg and layout 
requirementsj so many inches of concrete flooringj certain spaces between 
bldgs, such as the feed barn and milking barn. If a farm doesn't meet the 
bldg and concrete reguirements, he is only able to be Grade Bj ie: he 
cannot produce milk for drinking, only for cheese, dried milk, etc. Hence, 
many older farms which could not meet the requirements, droped outj there 
isn't enough money unless you are a Grade A farmer. 
Cassell estimates there are from 6 to 10 hurley tob gtowers in the 
SE section of Grayson Co; most are to the West and south. There are no 
flue cured (bright leaf) tob growers, nor are there any commercial orchards. 
The average size of hurley allotment is about i ac. or 1200 lbs. He did 
suggest a couple of hurley growers that I might find interesting: 
Worth Edwards of the Baywood sect grows hurley and also turnips, an 
unusual crop for t his region. 
Alva Davis who raises beef, is older and a good talker, knows people. 
Near Edmonds Comm, just into Va). 
There is some cabbage in the county, mostly raised by people from NC 
who lease the land to grow it onj they are not local farmers who own their 
own land. Most goew for "fresh crop"—not kraut. Left to visit Alleghany

Mon. 28 Aug. '78 
B. Owen 
Left for Tom Davis's abt 10 am with Harley Jojley, intern. Stoped 
at his daughter's place (who also lives with his sister—he aunt—Blanch) 
where we found out Tom was out in woods cutting firewood. This house and farm 
should fee visited again. I expect June, Tom's daughter who has never 
been married, will be a good home stuff person. 
Left house, went up road to where TD cutting wood. He uses a Homelite 
chain saw. Cuts trees as big as 2 feet through (dia) because the work is 
so much less? one cut yields 5 or 6 pieces of wood when split. Talked 
about an hour with him about all sort of things. He still uses a team of 
horses to haul wood with (they were not there this day), to plow his and his 
brother Luther's garden with, and to do general work around the palce with. 
He no longer farms for a living, He is ?8 years old, very spry, mentally 
alert, and is a great talker, as is his brother Luther. Tom has never left 
the home place to travel or live anywhere fflJM. else. I took a bunch of photos 
and we left him to complete his work. He returned to the house and asked June 
if she would call us from their neighbor's phone (they have none) when Tom 
was going to haul the wood out of the woods. She said OK. 
When we left and were heading for Paul Sutphin's, I asked Harley to 
jot down some IS of the things TD had told us. Here is what he reports: 
Oats no longer used for dairy feed. 
Sudan grass recently introduced as dairy feed. 
Remembers change from subsistence farm'ng to dairy farming, with 
emphasis on corn for silage. 
* 
28 Aug ?8 (cent) B. Owen 
His 'ather refused to burn sassafras wood because it was bad lueg. 
Worked as laborer and logger. Used oxen and praised their ability in the 
woods. 
Remembers introduction of cabbage into area "within last 10 years." At 
least a market crop. 
House he was born in (1900) still standing. Same true of log house 
built near his birth place which was built by his father. 
Never travelled away from home. 
Says the poplar tree replaced the chestnuts when the blight hit. 
Continued down 89 to Paul Sutphin's "lace, W of Pine Ridge, Surry Co., 
NC. He had to return to work (he XK££22 installs storm windows and doors), 
so didn't stay too long. Cruised back roads on way back to Galax. (613 to 
685 to 607) 
Tries. 29 Aug. '78 
B. Owen 
Eating breakfast, I had some thoughts about the maintanance of tradition 
in the entire fcegion. Seldom, in the entire region, does one bump into 
someone unconsciously maintaining the oldtime ways. Tftose people/places where 
people are self-consciouse of radition, one finds prscticioneers. Some of 
these are people who have re taken up their practices; be it a quilter who 
makes quilts for the local craft shop or the wagon train participant. 
Jhis self-consciousness seems more intense in the Virginia region of the 
pkwy, especially from 89 N to Hocky Knob. Addie Wood, the Wormy Chestnut, 
Cap Ayers and that bunch all belong to this group. Further to the South 
this self-consciousness seems less, hence one finds—on initial search— 
practicioneers of any sort, revival or otherwise. Perhaps this is due tothe 
fact that there are fewer commercial outlets for craft object (the things 
most closely associated with old time stuff with the exception, perhaps, of 
music). Less places like Mabry Mill, Mayberry Trading Post, and all th^t 
goes with them. 
Left with CF, Wally McNow, Arnold Schofield for the Sally/Tim Slate 
place (Patrick Co., VA). Lots of photoes (by Carl mostly, but BO too) of 
sheeting tobacco. Sheeting is packing the cured tob (that which has been 
dried in the barns, with applied heatp&M of about 15>0-l60 degrees) into 
•'sheets'* of burlap which in turn are made into bundles. A sheet 4f burlap 
is laid out on the ground, a MS heavy cardboard form (c. l*ft dia, 2% ft high) 
is placed over it and then packed full of tobacco, but ends always pointing 
out. When to tob gets high in—ot over the top of the form—someone 
packs it down by walking on it—a practice that is said would make the old 
29 Aug. '78 
B. Owen 
folks turn over intheir graves. The older people scorn the lack of respect 
giventtie process of today; there is noXX pride in growing, handling, and 
packing the stuff they feel. But, it is also easier and it still brings the 
same price—relatively speaking. After being packed a full as desired 
(25>0 lb is the max that can be sold in one bundle), XlXIiXXiSfiXXJS the form is 
lifted form the tob and t he corners of the burlap 8XM are tied up into 
bundles. It is then rolled aside so that another one can be made up. 
VJhile there I measured and photoed an old sled/,,slide,,. (see drHwing). 
After sleeting, fim and the rest of us went up to f he tob patch in order 
to top the rest of his field and spray the entire field. Photoes of both 
operations as well as tape of talk about what he is doing. 
After this, CF left early. Wally and Arnold and I had dinner with Sally 
and Tim . Good spread of many kinds of vegetables—a spread largerthan 
Tim expected; cpmparry I gueHW. 
Left after dinner for Walter Handy's. On way stopped and talked with 
Walter McCormick who was unloading his bulk curer. Photoed and measured. 
Also photoed and measured slides used by him. (see drawings). 
Continued on to Walter Handy's. Everyone very sleepy; it was a heavy 
hot day. He showed us the baskets he had made about UO yrs ago. They are 
3 oeck size originally used as ''setting baskets", ie; to haul tob plants 
in while settingout tob. He no longer makes any baskets and had no material 
to make any with. He also makes ax handles which he showed us. Photoed him 
with both baskets and handles. His baskets are the double hoop, egg basket 
type. They are very finely made, the splits and ribs being oak. 
29 Aug. '78 (cont) 
B. Owen 
The two hoops can be of either oak or hickory or, occassionally, adh. 
Taped him as he discribed the making of a basket. He learned to make 
them from his father who in turn learned Xffifi from his father. WF's son aldo 
has started making baskets, but they are of 
low quality compared with hr's fathers. He was not home, but I guess him to 
be about 30s. 
WH made a 3 or i* bushel basket once to haul fodder to his milk cows. 
Tells story about joking with a person about "what do you haul in that 
basket, Walter? Flint rocks.” 
Ax handles are out of hiskory and sell—the few he does sell—for Z $2* 
WH used to work mules, in teams usually, but hasn't lately. Prefers 
mules over horses because they are steadier workers. 
Returned to Galax.

CF left early for Tim and Sally Slate's place in order to get good 
tob priming photos. I arrived about 9 helped prime some. Taped Beech 
&XXM Slate during water break telling some stories. This man must be 
revisited at his home; he's a go d talker. photoed "slide" wagon built 
by Benton Minefield. The intertube holding the pole from which burlap is 
stretched idea was introduced into this are by Benton. He says he say a 
similar set up elsewhere (didn't specify), came home and tried it. Today 
most of the wagons i the area have a similafc set up. (see draw of wagon 
attached). 
Left priming about 20 min before they were done in order to have time 
to set up mikes and tape dinner. XX Turned machine on when they arrived. 
(CF XMXXX went earlier than I in order to get some cooking pix). 
After dinner, returned to where they were stringing. CF photoed. 
Measured barn and wagon (see drawings).

Left via Independence & Sparta for Marvin Lyon's where I was to meet up with 
Silers and PM. Bythe time I got there, I suppose they had arrived and 
gone, for ML was not home. Retraced my way (1102 & 1100) where at this 
jet I photoed and Measured a small, gnerel purpose sled with runners made 
of old Ford bumpers. The woman who lived inthe house there ( they are from 
the coast, only been there about 8 mo) said ML made the tiling. It was 
somewhat bent out of shape through a collisi n with a stump, but was still 
servicable. (see accomp. drawing). 
Continued down 1100 twd Stone Mtn State Park. On SR 1739, photoed and 
measureed the Garden Creek Bapt. Ch. There was a typescript, framed 
account of the churches history behibd the pulpit which I photoed. It was 
the only church I've seen thus far (with the exception of the Blue Ridge Ch 
in Glade Valley, NE Alleghany Co) that is unpainted. (The Blue Ridge Ch 
is imitation brick tarpaper). R8 
Returned to Galax via 1739, 1737, 1002,21, lli67, Ikkk, I960, pkwy to 18, 
thense up to Galax.

Mon. li Sept. *78 
B. Owen 
Left w/ PM to find Marvin Lyon. Preceded down pkwy, exited at 21, 
headed S c. 5 mi. to SR 1100. ML lives about 2 miles down this road, off to 
<sv\ 
raKXTKTi; the right at bottom of hill^ He lives in a beautiful, country 
story hall and Parlour house built in 19oo. As ML is a bachelor, 65 yrs 
old, and a collector of all sorts of s tuff, the house has remained unfixed 
up. Photogenic for sure. The chimney is ansbsolutely perfect example of 
old-time rock workj only sparce use of mud (not cememht) in the inner parts 
of it. It is virtually a dry stone structure. The wall paper is ca. 1900 
as well, though ML put it up since that time. 
ML is a s addle repiirerand XXMilO sometimes maker, >ut has retired 
due to two strokes abt 8 yrs ago. His shop, however, is intact. He has lots 
of examples of his work scatteredthroughtout the house. It is interesting that 
he has made no work horse harnessj only bridles and saddles and some repair 
on wagon train gear. This in spite of t he fact that he began this laether 
work I think in abt 19U8 or so. Does this indicate that horse farming in 
his area was not very prevalent, or just that the f armers bought their stuff 
fron the store which was probably cheaper, or that ML simply prefered to 
deal with pleasure horses? 
ML is a talker; turn the tape on and let it run. With sore exerted 
direction, however, I think he can be a valuable source of info; he likes the 
old days and likes to talk about them. His house is virtually a museum; 
bunches of pottery, glass, furniture of all sorts—early mail order to home¬ 
made, canes, cooperand cobler stuff, plus more. 
Prior to finally finding ^L at home, we talked with and photoed Ervin Leonard 
from Lexington (Davidson Co) NC who was drilling a well into the side of the 
mountain near ML's (ML sold him an acre). EL is a machinist who ^wnes his 
U Sept. ?8 
B. Owen 
own shop. He invented—or at least developed—the drilling rig he was using. 
The damn thing was made from various scrap parts he salvaged from around his 
shop. He had the power qo. drop a line to his place from a nearby polr, 
rig 'ed up XM. an electric motor on a set of rails set at a 5 degree angle 
in to the mtn.This moter drives nomemade oipes and bits—carbid steel 
poeces brazed onto the end of a 2| OD pipe. The feed of the thing is 
controlled by the size ofthe pipe he has hagging from a ratchet that turns 
a wheel which moves the motot along the tracks. The heavier the pipe, the 
harder the pressure of the bit against the rock. He and his wife aid 
sometimes grandchildren come up on weekends, sleep in a camper, and hang 
around the drilling site. When we left he had reached a depth of abt h2 
feet and expectedto htt water at about f?0 or so. 
ML lives for visitors. He keeps a record vook of the number of people 
who erne by each month. July had over 230. Most of these are repeats (neighbors 
checking up on him, etc), wagon train people, aid campers from Camp Cheerio. 
In fact, he is very paternalistic toward the kids whom he has met that have 
gone to this camp, ^any have kept in touch and he likes to talk of his 
activities and contacts with these people. They regularily cpmp—while on 
horserS des aid hikes--on his place in a spot he has kept cleared for theiji. 
I expect his museum and rap about the old days has been tempered by such 
visits by outsiders--out of area, out of state. 
Wed. 6 Sept. '78 
B. Owen 
Left abt 11:15 for Alleghahy/Wilkes Co NC w/TA. Abt 1 mi W of pkwy 
on RX SR 18, stopped to look all an interesting looking farm op on hill to 
N of road that had 5 or 6 outbldgs all lined up in a perfect line. Thought 
it was abandoned, but soon found not so. Talked hour or so with the 
Wrights; Edgar (85)j Clarence (50s), and Edgar's wife, ^ame unknown at thisXXIifr 
time. These folks are good people to visit. Below are some random jottings 
of what we rambled about (no tape): 
Ed^ar w^s one of first commercial cabbage produders in the area, peddling 
them in places such as Salsbury, Mocksvmlle, and even Charlotte, NC. 
He would often ped le 12-1300 lb a day. 
Edgar also peddled apples hw bought in the Independence area to the same 
places. This was in the 20s. To go—by wagon—to Mocksville took 
2^ days each way. 
He also pedled potfctoesMB in the s me way and to the same places. 
Edgar worked in the teens out west, casting gold bars and such in Colorado. 
Has some real nice talk about this time, including how M|: they did 
va-ious jobs.XfflHOmMKIKppikXXMiaa^X 
Edgar talked about the flu epidemic of 1919 or so and how it was when 
he went to Winston XM to peddle stuff. He also got the flu but beat 
it by t"king lots of guinineXX in order to sweat it out. 
The house there was built in 1911. The add was in the 30s. 
They raise bees and would be gladto have us around when the are robbed. 
Clarence, the real talker of+Jie two, when asked about the outbldgs all 
linpd up in a row, remarked that SXMXXXIXRX "if an airplane came through 
he-e, it'd wipe 'em all out." 
Lots of interesting terminology: "jap-bugs"«japanese beetles; they "keep

on slow timew year round—don't change to daylight savings. 
"widdies"'* chicks. 
Funny family stories about XMIX Clarence's brothers, et al. 
Told of a friend ofXX Mrs Wright, Nora Glasj|pV jjSp^, Edmonds, NC, who 
is a good quilterand who is ''queer'' or backward as they explained ti. 
She is very uncooperative around strangers. Her sister, it seems, was 
murdered nea^ the pkwy in the 30s. Elvia Branick I think her name was. 
Mentioned Austin Dixon, Lowgap, NC, hunts ginseng. 
(the Wright's address is Edmonds, NC. 919-657-8365) 
Opal Carrico, near Edmonds, mid-50s, is an herb person. 
Continued to Traphill, stopped and had nice talk with Ruth Holbrook. 
While there, measured two homemade benches—made like pews—used 
at Fairview College there in the mid 1800s. (See drawings attached). Photoed 
one/ Her house and shop are pre 1860s, real nice. 
Left Traphill NW on 1737, saw interesting house, stopped, stayed. 
Photoed (by TA) and measured (both) the Brooks House. Talked with Bert Smith, 
(Iona Brooks' son) about house. JSXilXXM Main hs built 1895. (See attached 
exterior plan of house,XM corn crib, details of older (ca. I81i0s ?) saddle bag 
house located behind the main house). TA will revisit. Talked a lot with 
Bridgette KMXR Annette Smith, Iona's grandaughter, 8 yrs old, who proved 
knowledgeable and helpful. For lack of a better term, TA and I are calling 
the main house either a "Modified I hs" or "Modified Georgian hs". &X&XXTXXX

Thurs. M Sept. ’78 
Talked w/ Paul Edwards, Sparta, the ASCS agentfor Alleghany Co. He 
gave me the following info: 
90% of hurley tob. is W of our study area. Estimated that there are 
about 20 allotments ITA. Also saidthere were only about 3-k allotments 
in all of Wilkes Co. 
Cabbage a long time cash crop in the area. Not gov’t introduced. The 
worst disease for cabbage is clubroot. To prevent, the roots of the 
plant is dipped iS when transplanted. If clubroot hits the crop, 
best move is to plant something else. It tends to locate in fields 
rather than hit and be gonej it stayr. Most farmers grow both fresh 
and kraut babbage. Even those who grow fresh market the later stuff 
for kraut. 
Told me of Reese Billings who still uses horses with his hurley tob. 
He lives near Twin Oakes in what the old timers call the Niles School 
section (llj.01). 
Burley mkts are in W. Jefferson and Boone. 
Beef and dairy about even in Co. 
Dairy is best money producer in Co. At least 100 Grade A in Co, evenly 
distributed. Alleghany Co is 2nd or 3rd largest Grade A producer 
in state. 
Some cane for molasses. Recomended I see Dewey Truitt for old time 
molasses making. He still uses boiler ratherthan evaporator. 
3-h commercial orchards, mostly apple, only 1 peach. 
Alleghany Co is 3rd largest wool producer in NC (behind Watauga and Ashe). 
Dogs are the biggest problem faced by sheep raisers.

Left and visited Ttevey Truitt 9 just out of Sparta abt -I mi, W of 18, 
Nice talker, cooperative. He is cutting his cane lUth and will run off 
early the 15th. He just had his boiler made—brand new. He also makes 
his own cane cutting knives. 
Left Truitt's for Reese Billings'. Went lli03, right on lii05. He was 
not at home, left note on back of c^rd that I would come again. 
Proceeded via ll*01, 11*03, ll*05, 21, 1135, 1139, 1135, 1161;, 1163, 
1162, 111*9, 18, ll*l*l, 6l5, Photoed and measured exterior of Prather Creek

Fiddler’s Convention, Beulah Community (W of Mt Airy, Surry Co, NC on sr 89. 
Set 8 mics—all taped piggyback onto the PA system's (provided by Kyle 
Creed). The Beulah Ruritan, sponsors, were diaapointed in the low turnout, 
caused apparently by the giant street fair hanpening that same weekend in 
Winston-Salem. There was ilXX IX also a bluegrass festival at J. P. VanHoy's 
place at Union Grove, NC. The music that was there, however, was representative 
of the area's old time fiddler's convention type as well as bluegrass with 
a regional stamp. Attended thething with TA, HM, CW, and Wally McNow.

Attended the Clark's Creek Progressive Primitive Baptist Church, 
near Ararat,Patrick Co., VA w/ ?M & TA. TA & ohotoed while I recorded 
the service. 
Why this groan wants to hold ontb the title "Primitive Baptist" is 
uncleat; their service order and doctrin are dif ^’erentfrom a ny primitive 
bant ch. I've ever seen. They have sandy school; choir; piano; vocal 
congregati on responce; aid "the preacher wears a black robe w/black Velvet 
front with a large gold chain and cross around his neck. The music is 
definitely from the black gospel tradition, and not from the "Long Meter" 
or "Dr Watts" tradition (ie: unaccompanied hymnody of the old school). 
They use no hymn books at all, neither congregation or cho&b. 
Made 3| tapes, recorded w/2 Nagra TVs, sybc, w/paralleM connector 
between; 5 mics (U can run at one time) set up as shown below.

M0n. 11 Sept. '78 B. Owen 
Left for Reece Billings' at 1UOO via 58 W, 212, 636, 626, $29, lb07. 
He was home (Rt 2, Sparta). XM 60 yrs old, very photogenic, nice talker, 
and knowledgeable about lots of things, including bee keeping, burley growing, 
beef raising, hog raising, working with horses. His place is about mile 
off road that my car can reach (too low) and secluded. Ratherthan fence his 
hogs, horses, or steers in, he fences them out of where he doesn't want them. 
He apparently has never been maried and lives in the house in which he was 
born and which his father had built in abt 1900, The house is a 
Victorianiged Ij trim, roof especially. Fairly nice farm bldg layout. 
Has abt 28 $ead of cattle (b'ef), 23 bee gums, 30 odd piglets running around. 
He only uses his horse for tob and garden cultivating nowj he has the land 
turned with a tractor. He does not, however, wn a tractor as best I can tell. 
His pick up, a ca. 196it Dodge i* wheel drive, is rigged to haul tob from the 
field; it has a framework from wjfich to hang the sticks. Took photoes, no 
tape. He has no phone, so I will have to continue to check back with him 
in order to catch him as he robs his bees and cjrts and hangs his tob. 
Lunched in sparta, continued to Dean Pruitt's. He wasn't at home 
so continued on to Pleasant Grove Union Bapt Ch. Photoed and measured 
home made pews. I thought that HM had measured the bldg, but found out I 
was wrong. (When retumedp made list of all bldgs we have measured in order 
to prevent similar problems and repeats.). While at Ch, DP drove by, stopped, 
said he had to go catch a cow that had gotten loose in the mtn, but I could 
come back for interview some bad weather day. He belongs to the Pleasant 
Gr. Ch and told me it was founded in 1880s, and the original bldgwas built 
across rd from current bldg, and that current frame bldg was built over 70 
yrs ago. The ch meets every 3rd Sat afternoon and Sun am. 
Ret. Galax via pkwy.

Left c. 11:00 for Joe Hutchison's sawnill, neat Traphill, Wilkes Co, 
NC w/TA. Stopped and visited the Brinegar Cabin. Cont. on to 18 and 
had lunch. 
Just oast pkwy on 18 going S, stopped and measured/photoed exterior 
of Meadow Fork Peimitive Bapt. Ch (got name from Sam Miller at his sawmill 
in TA's notes) 
just past the ch). (see plan XXiXXKXJSj. Also drew (no photoes) homemade 
pews. The ch was locked. 
Continued to Hutchison Farm (owned by R. Bidden) where TA and I photoed/ 
measured the log, transverse crib bam. (see TA's notes for plan of barn). 
Cont. to mmxmKSMMMm Littlestone Mountain Bapt. Ch (spelled as 
given). Photoed/measured both int and ext (see attached plan). Ch located 
jet 1739 & 1737, neat Traphill, NC. 
Finally got to Joe Hutchison's place. Tailed some with him about his 
sawmilling. He isn't sawing now, doing home repairs. He showed us his mill, 
however, and demonstrated how he has rigged it IX soibat he can do the entire 
operation by himself. He has a lever connected to a board at the end of the 
conveyor that carried the cut wood that swings left or right, hence rolling 
the lumber to one side and the slabs off theXX other onto his fork ligt. 
He won't be cutting again untill mid Oct probably, so he suggested a 
couple of other people we might visit. We left for home shortly before dark.

B. Owen 
Left c. 10:00 for Reece Billings' piece near Twin Oake, Alleghany Co, 
NC. On way gor off the road (629) along the New River. Got U wheel pickup 
tp pull me out finally. RB was cutting tob when I got there. He works very MX 
slowlyend deliberately and by himself. He seems to prefere to wirk alone 
rather than KXMil XH hastle with helpers. He has all the time in the 
world it seems. Made 1 tape, took b rods film. Says he will be cutting and 
hauling for the next week or so at least. He lets the tob. sit in the field 
for ii-5 days then puts it on hos truck and hauls it to the barn. The reason X25 
for letting it sit in the field is to reduce the weight of theolant hence 
making it easier to load and hang in the barn. 
RB uses five grades when seperating his t ob for sale, l) Lugs (the lowest 
leavesj called "flyings" by the state people he says"j 2) Brights or cutter 
grade, next to bottom* 3) Long reds, next up the plantj ij.) shott reds, next; 
5) tips. Some people, he says, only use 3 grades, usually combining some of 
the long reds w/ the brights, combinirg both grades of reds together, and 
sliping some short reds into the tip grade 
RB used only two fertilizers this year. ^XEiXSiiXmUKXKiPUUlIiiUUSX 
IM&XMXgrMMSXSimtXX&i&XMgxpiXM&XMUX 5-10-15 is cultivated into the 
ground before the plants are s et out. 8-0-2k is spread and cultivated in 
the first time the tob is cultivated. Did not use any Amonium Nitrate 
("soda") or any nitrate at all this year.; he feels the stuff makes the 
plants slow in getting IX yellowed enough for cutting. 
In talking about diseases and bugs that harm the plants, RB said the following 
are the worst: Japanese beetles, grasshoppers, horn worms, cut worms or 
"clombing cut worms", and "bud worms." He mentioned that too much moisture 
can cause "leaf flaking." Also he told of a mold that is not visible to the 
naked eye. TKmXIiOXJ(immSXmmi£5K8X«X This mold is detectible only 
by smell. The trick is to dust the leaves with a sweet snuff, such as Tube 
Rose, which covers the smell, hence it is not detected by the buyers. 
By abt. mid Nov the hurley is ready for mkt. He takes it to 
West Jefferson (Ashe Co), NC usually, though he says some people around take 
it to Boone (Watauga Co) NC. 
Thurs. ll* Sept. '78 
B. Owen 
Left c. 8:30 for Dewey Truitt's place where he was working molases* 
w/Kathleen Galloway. Photoed/measured his homemade cane knives (see 
attached drawing). Also photoed set op of mill and conveyor tove used 
to carry away the crushed stalks. Present was Mack Edwards, a neighbor. 
Due to the rainy, cold weather, theywere not cutting any more that day. 
By the time I returned later that afternoon, they had cut all the cane, 
hence no photoes of cane cutting. 
Left for Sam Miller's sawmillXXXMX (just past pkwy on 18 S). No one there. 
Went on over to Dean Pruitt's dairy farm, hoping to catch him at home due 
tolhe weather. He was, but had the floor of his bathroom torn out to do 
some repairs, so didn't want to take the time then to interview. We did, 
though, stay a few mins and talked about several th.1ngs, especially the 
Pleasant Grove Union Bapt. Ch which he belongs to. He has the history of. 
The ch was founded in 1935 when it split from the Reg Bapts. They usua-lly 
meet the 3rd Sat afternoon and Sun morning, but due to association meeting, 
they did not this week. There are about 28 members in the cfe. Measured 
the church (see attached plan).£MX 
Went to the Stone Mtn Park headquarters to find out where-the log, Hutchinson 
house was. They gave us directions, we went up to it. Great place. 
Photoed/measured ext (locked, must get key from head ranger who was in Winston 
this day) (see attached plan). I figure this house ca. 18L0-50.

1? Sept. '78 
B. Owen 
Left with Richard McCamant (NFS intern) for Reece Billings' near Twin 
Oaks, Alleghany NC. Visited with him for about hrs and talked about 
just about everything. RB is not one from whom one can draw info in a strict 
interview manner; he clams up. He will, however, talk freely when jutt hanging 
around more or less visiting, even when he knows your reason for visiting. 
Still, made 2 tapes, took lots of photoes. He is an honest to god old timer, 
nearly self reliant, near hermit. He told two off color jokes, but would 
not allow them to be put on tape. 
"Here's a little rjayme". There was this newely married couple 
lieing in bed one morning. The man said that whoever could say the best 
rf^rme could stay in bed and the other had toget up and fix the fire. So 
he told TO this: 3& 2 is 5, 
5 & ii is 9, 
I've got my hand on yours, 
You8ve got yours on mine. 
She says I'll start off like you did, but add a little extra. 
3 & 2 is 5, 
5 & It is 9, 
I know the length of yours. 
But you don't know the depth of mine. 
The other joke is this: A dr. told an old mtn bachelor that he 
needed the milk from a pother with a newly born baby and asked if he knew 
of anyone that would do. He said yes, there was a new mother just down from 
his place who had a new bab£. So he went to her aid her husband and told them 
what the Dr. said and asked if they would Jtelp him. She said sure, so she

B. Owen 
milked him iout a little cup full. He drank it and it helped h is stomach. 
A couple of days later, though, his stomacft started hurting again, so he went 
boCkto the woman's house to see about getting some more ndlk. She said OK, 
but since her husband wasn't home, why not just get it like a baby does ra ther 
than mess up a clean cup. So he says OK and sucks her tit like a baby. Well, 
she begins togst a little excited and askds him wouldn't he like something 
to go with the milk. He says, in a droll voice, "Have you got any corn bread?" 
Lunched in Sparta, went on to Dewey IMS Truitt's place where he had already 
cut all his cane and repaired his busted mill bearings or bushings. He took 
two pieces of 2 X U, notched them soihe shaft would fit, and bolted it down 
tolhe frame good. It must have worked OK, because he had alreddy run enough 
juice tobeging boilirg off a boiler full by about 1:00pm. A boiler f ull is 
about 100 gal (from which abt 15-20 gal of molasses will be made). Took lots 
of photoes (some pushed) of boiling operation. Present were: Dewey Truitt 
(large straw hat)j Anna Mae Truitt (daughter); Charlie Collins (blue/white 
cap); Elgin Choate (red shitt, blue/white cap); Bo^by Dean Edwards (younger, 
no hat); Mack Edwards ( felt hat, w^ite shirt); Frank Pender (red can, no 
shirt). 
ADD:^Chair* photoed at reece Billingsmade by Finland ("Fin") 
Schumate who lived E o" Twin Oaks, dead years ago. The double slatted- 
back chair made about 50 yrs ago by unknown maker. The wide u^per slat 
chair made in 30's by unknown maker

15 members resent which is about 7 fewer than time before when 
the Eilers attended. This due to association meeting near there. 
Sing out of 3 books: l) Favorite Songs and Hymns, Stamps-

Dubbed and copied tapes till 1:30. Went to livestock 
sale, Galax Livestock Market, with Eilers. Recorded 2 reels with 
Nagra IVs, stereo, sync, 2 sen mics, one taped to auctioneer's 
mic, other suspended over left side of arena. 
Auctioneer is Clarence Marshall, Jim's older brother and, 
according to Jim, the better of them at auctioneering. Sale began 
about 2s50. 
Jim M. says his brother deosn't like to XXX take breaks 
while working. He prefers to go straight through with the salw. 
He went to school at the K&MXX&X Feller's Auctioneers School, 
Kanakee, Ill. No longer operative. 
The calves at this sale (younger than yearlings ones) were 
described to me as being "scrap" by Charlie Roberts, Lowgap, 
NC. 
Clarence se 11s at Galax on Mondays, Wytheville on Tuesdays, 
Mt Airy on V/ednesdays, in addition to he numerous special salws. 
After sale, went to Reece Bill'rigs' with LE and Kathleen 
Galloway. Took bunches of photoes during "magic hour" of RB 
cutting, spudding, and hanging tob in barn. 
Tues. 19 Sept. '78 
B. Owen 
Left for Dewey Truitt’s $ (Sparta, NO) with Jim Jenkins, 
b 
Greensboro Daily Nev/s, about 11:45. Stayed about 45 min, till 
JJ said he needed to get on back. While 
photoeing shed which houses his boilers, he need help to keep 
his molasses from boiling overtoo badly. Quit my own work and 
helped him as best I could. It envolved skimming as fast as 
possible, trying to get all the scumoff while it was boiled up 
good. Returned to Galax, afte lunch, talk, about 4:00. 
Left with TA for Hall House (SR674, E. Carroll Co., VA). 
Measured corn crib (photoed earlier, inAug) while TA measured 
house. Also easured cellar house. (See attached drawings—als 
attached is earlier drawing of fallen down spring house)

At ended Skyline Independent Ba]b. Ch (sr 640, SE Carroll 
Co., VA) with Eilers. Ervin Galimore, Pastor; Marshall Larger, 
song lender and preacher. This is a mainstream, country, 
gospel-fundamentalist ch. The music is straight forward 
rocking gospel, esp. that accompanied by T. H. MacMillan (Cana, 
Va) who is a grftat piano player of the gospel style. He is 
23 yrs ols. The younger guitar player is Jerald Galimore, 
EG's nephew. EG played jpXX guitar and sang, pretty nice stuff, 
especially with XMMMX "Barbara” (last name I don't know). 
The ch uses New Songs of Inspiration #9. compiled by Bob Benson, 
John T. Benson Publ. Co, 1625 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37202, when 
they use book at all which is seldom. They M have a "little choir" 
as well as "big choir"--each does couple of songs each at beginning 
of se vice. Soloists and duets/trios perform when called to do 
so by Galimore. 
Guest preacher this day was Tommy Worrell, an evangelist. 
Recorded entire service, three tapes. 2 Nagra IVs, sync, with 
parallel connector, 4 mics, all senn 402s, occasional! moved 
as required by music.

Late start. Left for Hus Caudill’s abt 11:00. Arrived aid found the 
place crowded with relatives, his daughter Ollie and MM son in law Tommy. 
Hus and Tom were building a work bench inthe garage to sharpen lawnmowers, 
etc on so hey don't have to stoop down. (Tom and Ollie live in Winston- 
Salem; he drives for Roadway). Had a bite of lunch withthem, talked with 
Ollie a little about making grape butter and jelly. Her mother (Em who died 
abt 3 yrs ago) made both, but Ollie had never made butter before. Had a taste, 
pretty good. Hus and I talked about sawmilling (not on tape, too busy) 
?nd decided to ride over to the mill where he works occasi nally—the one 
owned by Leff Cox. Rode over there (c. U miles E and N) where he explained 
the operation to me. This mill is the smallest you can get; not covered, 
run by GM U cylinder diesel moter connected to saw with V belts; only one 
l<j>g dog on lead head block. No rollers for off bearer,he has to carry the 
lumber right tothe truck and pitchthe slabs across toe rails to the slab 
pile. Hus swas mostly posts for fence out of locust. Seldom does he get 
good, large logs to work with. He says it's really fun to cut big stuff. 
Ret to Hus's, talked w while with Ollie and Hus's grandaughter (not 
Ollie's kid) $udy about various things. Left about U:00. 
Went ot Reece Billings' to see if he might be working bees—robbing . 
Wasn't; still cutting the 1 ast of his tob with toe help of his neice, Betty 
(forgot her last name) from Galax. They had cut over a hundred plants since 
abt 10. Went down to the house with them, had watermelon, talked a little 
till Betty left. Then Reece wanted to load up his truck with stick of tob so 
he could unload in the AM. Went with him, took one roll each of film. 
Getting pretty dark by this time. While talking, he said thattoere could 
be something to this planting by the sighs stuff; h~s father did it and 1 nee 
2? Sept. '78 (cont) 
B. Owen 
and he, Reece, tried it onee wnth planting tob. He planted in the fall of the 
moon (wane) and in the sign of the feet. He says his tob only got chest high, 
about a foot or two less than it should have been. Still, he's not sure that 
it was the sign or the weather, ground or what. 
Also talked about castrating pigs and calves. To castrate, best to do 
it when very young—from abt week to three old if possible. Simply turn over 
on back, split the sack that holds each ball,pop the ball out, cut the inner 
sack, pull out all the way or, if the pig is oo old, pull out as far as it 
will go aid cut the cord. Squirt some disinfectant (rReece calls his stuff 
"Blue Lotion", but I'm n t sure what that is) on and in the cut. You should 
have clean bedding for the pigs when this is done; something besides the 
dust. It takes about three weeks for them to be cured. Says it doesn't 
hurt them much. 
Ret to Galax abt 7:00. 
Thurs. 28 Sept. '78 
B. Owen 
Left for Traphill, Wilkes Co, NC to see Don Spicer, a 
logger. He was cutting a shade tree in a neighbors yard. 
Talked a while, no tape. He hasn't cut timber for a MKXK 
month or so. He is very ni^e fellow. M&M He usually 
buys timber as it standsin the woods from the owner, saws it out, 
sells to mill. He will, if necessary and the timber looks good 
enough, buy on an actual bd foot deal, measured after cut 
rather than estimated while standi g as normally done. He 
prefers to cut white pine because of the money, but doesn't like 
it because it is rough tohandle; white pine doesn't prune 
itself well, hence lotsof snaggs, broken limbs, etc. Doesn't 
cut much hardwood. Apparently not enough and it doesn’t bring 
g od enough a price, unless walnut pe haps. 
On way fron OS's pl^ce, noticed all land to rt of SR 1328 
was posted by Mr. and Mrs. Zachary T. Reynolds. This is the 
famed Reynolds Estate--thousandsof acr s in western Wilkes co. 
On way to Spicer's (via weste n Surry Co, NC) photoed/ 
measured Mitchell's River Prim Bapt. Ch (SR 1330, just W of jet 
1330 & 1331. W. Surry Co., NC). Drew pews by looking through 
windowsM—church locked. Three varieties of homemade pews.

Dear C rl,

Enclosed are (finally): 10 tape logs— BR8-BO-R8

Jesus. If I've.learned anything it's LOG IMMEDIATELY.' If there are any other 
problems/complications, let me know—gently. I have not made copies of the 
tape logs; please do so and send them on. Thanks. 
Still working on my essay. It's amazing how much one can learn from hindsight; 
Next time I'll do this, I wish I had done that, etc. I think it8s worth knowing 
early what your.essay will be on so more specific notes about same can be 
started. Immediate compilation of ideas on a particular subjest might make the 
final tedium less. 
I am also puting together a couple more articles—one for Southern Exposure 
(maybe) on western NC outbldgs. This is sort of a synopsis of previous work 
With my own additions. Seems it would be nice to have in one place a copiplete 
overview of all outbldg types a nd forms; makes fishing easier. Another article 
is on homemade church pews (sometimes "free-benches" in the literature). I've 
got 32.drawings and pfrotoes of bench-ends and thought I'd put together a modest 
something for NC FLore 4ly. What sort of release problems do I have with you? 
Is anything more needed than anqole credit abott project, when field data was 
collected? Also, would you Xerox those contact sheets of mine (and anycne elses) 
that have pews on them? I'm using drawings, but want to make them accurate. 
If Xeroxs are not clear enough, let me know and maybe we can work something 
elso out. Thanks. 
What's gossip about Tenn-Tom project? Classified? 
come on down for a visit. 
Drop a line or call sometimej or 
Say hey to everyone up there. 
I am.

Carl, 
Enjoyed the weekend; eventhe meetings were OK as far as they go of course. 
Sent the photoes to the Eilers today; hope they arrive OK. 
Enclosed are my Field Notes.v I allowed the BRI here at Ferrum to make copies 
for the£r files. They seem t\up to date, but—even though they're mine—I 
won't sware (swear) to it. Copies will be appreciated soon as possible. 
Say hello to everyone up there for nH. 
Thanks
