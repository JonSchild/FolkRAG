00:40.3   Interviewer: Good afternoon my name is Patricia Francios with Domestic 
Worker's United and we'd like to hear your story today. 
My name is Althea Hanes. 
00:55.2   Interviewer: Will that be the name you use on your story? 
Yes ma'am. 
01:04.2   Interviewer: So what is your current occupation? 
I'm a domestic worker a nanny. 
01:14.1   Interviewer: What borough or neighborhood do you live in? 
Presently I'm living in Brooklyn. 
01:22.0   Interviewer: Like living in Brooklyn? 
Yes, I do. 
01:24.3   Interviewer: Why you choose to living in Brooklyn? 
Well I've been living there all my life the past 20 years. My family. I'm rooted and

I'm from the lovely island of St. Vincent in the Grenadines in the West Indies. 
01:49.1   Interviewer: So how did you become a domestic worker? 
I became a domestic worker after living in your country as a single parent and you come 
out looking for a future for your kids, family back home, I realized getting to America 
that becoming a domestic worker was the only thing available quick and fast at the time 
as a job.

02:22.3   Interviewer: I can understand that especially with the economy that. 
 
Exactly, exactly. 
 
02:37.0   Interviewer: How long have you done this work? 
 
Maybe for 21/22 years now. Very good years. 
 
02:52.2   Interviewer: How many positions have you had? 
 
Well, I had about four positions. My first job was like two and a half years with one 
family in Long Island and then another one about the same two and half years and I did 
six months in New Jersey and my last job was twelve and a half years in Manhattan on 
the Upper West Side with one family. 
 
03:26.1   Interviewer: Can I ask, you said that it lasted twelve years? 
 
Twelve and half years, yes. 
 
03:33.2   Interviewer: And that job ended? 
 
Yes it did. 
 
03:36.2   Interviewer: Can you give me a reason, how that job ended? 
Well, it's not too much a nice note. After the boys become grown up and it was time to 
move on, it was very sad even thinking about it right now. Nobody even said let us talk 
let us discuss something, I was just thrown out abruptly not even saying goodbye, not 
even getting a hug from the two boys that I raised. 
04:11.2, 04:23.1, Interviewer: That's really sad. 
 
Yes it was very very. Twelve and half years. 
 
04:23.1   Interviewer: What motivated you to be part of this project? 
 
What motivated me when I heard about it is knowing that the hardships as a domestic 
worker, as a mother, as a black woman, I was so moved and encouraged to know that 
our stories would be told and as the Bible says, generation maybe six seven one they 
will be able to know about the struggles we went through knowing that it was not an 
easy task. 
 
05:09.1   Interviewer: If you met someone on the street, how would you describe what 
it is like being a domestic worker? 
 
How would I describe it? Being a domestic worker you have to be so open minded 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

because it takes a lot to be a domestic worker. You've got to be kind, you've got to be 
honest, especially when dealing with kids you've got to have faith because there is so 
much you have to do, multi-task. Chief cook and bottle-washer, yep, you've got to take 
care of the kids, the house, you've got to go do errands, you've got to remember school 
time, homework, dinner, it can be so much. 
 
06:26.0   Interviewer: My question to follow, please walk me through your daily routine 
and responsibilities. 
 
Well a typical day varies because working with different families, I had different 
experiences, like in my first jobs in Long Island, you would get up very early in the 
morning, sometimes you have to wake them up and get them ready, get them out of 
bed, get the dressed, brush their teeth and hair, make sure they get breakfast, make 
sure they're ready for the school bus. Then you have to turn around you have to 
straighten up the beds, get the laundry, clean while you do the laundry, dust, and so 
many things to make the day complete before the kids are back from the bus. That's 
different from in the city, you have to go to school, you have to make sure you know 
what's for dinner that evening, start preparing dinner. 
 
07:56.2   Interviewer: You have to be a worker with many different hats? 
 
Exactly, and again that's where multi-tasking comes in. 
 
08:12.2   Interviewer: What skill do you need to be a domestic worker, and how do you 
learn them? 
 
I think for me my skill was within me coming from back in the island, growing up with 
the hard, hard life, my skill was within me. The roughness, knowing sober-mindedly 
what you're going to do, how you're going to do it, how you're going to get through the 
day. These are the simple skills from within you. 
Having kids of my own then you have your family, sister's kids, brother's kids we grew 
up in the Islands, those are where the skills came from. 
 
09:17.2   Interviewer: What training is necessary to be a successful domestic worker? 
 
The training? You've got to be a good, honest person, you've got to be fully aware of 
what is going around you while you are there with the kids. 
 
10:01.1   Interviewer: Let's say you have a play date and suddenly that kid started to 
choke and that kid needed attention. What skill would you need to assist that child? 
 
CPR, which I'm very grateful to Domestic Workers United for having me be two or three 
times around now, so you must have that skill with the CPR. 
 
Domestic Workers United

10:46.1   Interviewer: What training is necessary for being a successful domestic 
worker? 
 
To be a successful, recognized nanny or domestic worker, I think it's where training 
comes in with our nanny training posts. Again I must say thanks to Domestic Workers 
United. I personally can say I had my nanny training course, my computer training 
course, I had leadership, and as I said before, my CPR. On behalf of all black Caribbean 
women, I must again say thank you. 
 
12:13.1   Interviewer: Can I just ask what was in the nanny training course? 
In a nanny training course we were taught CPR, nutrition, and quite a few other things 
combined in the nanny training course. Pediatrics, it's not just like just training at the 
basic level. 
 
12:57.2 Interviewer: Is there anything that people who employ you have learned from 
you? 
 
Yeah. I would say being patience, which it takes a lot, that's why a lot of the mothers 
they don't really have the patience to take care of the kids, that's why we can have a 
job. So I think a lot patience, because a lot of times, 'How did you do it? Oh my god, 
you're always ahead of us,' so it takes a lot of patience. 
 
13:36.2   Interviewer: That motherly instinct is a natural one. 
 
Exactly, it is. 
 
13:56.1   Interviewer: Do you ever share cultural things from you heritage with the 
family you assist, for example, food, language, folktales, or beliefs about life and death? 
One of the fun things I remember sharing is about our culture back in the Islands you 
would sit down with the kids and you would tell them how hard they had it in life. When 
you tell them they laugh at you. When you tell them we didn't have water in the home, 
toilets in the house, we didn't even have radio, and they would sit down and say, 'Tell 
me more, tell me more, so how did you used to do it?' And that was some fond 
memories, telling those old time stories of how we had grown up on the islands. Our 
food, also, the kids will love you when you sneak in a little lunch and mommy doesn't 
want them to have food and they'll say, 'What is that?' You tell them and they would 
never understand, but oh it tastes good and they would enjoy it. They just love that 
Caribbean food. 
 
15:40.1   Interviewer: I think we give them the best of us. What conditions do you face 
throughout your work experience as a domestic worker? What do you have to deal with 
especially in that workplace? For instance, the way your employer treats you, do you get 
meals? 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Yes, I never remember having problem with meals. One of the conditions I would always 
remember in Long Island was sleeping in the basement. Yep, sleeping in the basement 
and you'd have to get up in the night on tippy toe because the bathroom is upstairs, 
sometimes you hold it in if you don't want to get up because I remember coming from 
the basement and you don't want them to make them know that you're coming upstairs 
to use the bathroom, so that condition would always stand up in my mind. One of the 
other conditions, I don't know if this applies to your questions, is that you have to get up 
very early in the morning and go to sleep very late at night and you could only eat when 
they finish eating. I know one family you have to be down there, you almost fall asleep, 
but you still have to go up and eat something and then clean up the kitchen when it's 
ten, when it's eleven, that's one of the conditions. Very heartbreaking. 
 
18:08.1   Interviewer: So when you're going through these kind of conditions does your 
mind ever linger what's going on at your home?  
 
Often times tears would come to your eyes when you think where you come from even 
though we were poor in Caribbean we had our own home, little house and everyone 
was together satisfied, you go to bed when you want, you get up when you want, you 
know, food was always there, three meals, so you didn't have to wait until someone you 
were working for was done to get something. 
 
18:58.2   Interviewer: So you know everything in life has its good and its bad. What was 
the best part of your job? Please give an example. 
 
The best part of my job is playing with the kids, taking them to the different games, I'm 
such a fan of baseball because I learn it from the boys, going on play dates just meeting 
other nannies you can socialize with, those are the fun times. Outside in the park. I do 
have quite a few friends who I met as baby sitters from different islands and we are still 
friends today for 20 years, so that's a fun part about it. You meet other people, you 
learn their culture. 
 
20:28.2   Interviewer: So like I said, everything is good and bad. What was one of the 
worst experiences part of your job? 
 
One of the worst experiences I had is like when my job with the boys were getting big 
and the parents had nothing much for you to do in the house and you had to go out and 
walk the dog in Manhattan. That was one, and would always be my worst experience. 
 
21:03.3   Interviewer: So you were a nanny, housekeeper, school teacher [AH: And dog 
walker.] Excuse me, let me ask you a question, and this is really serious to me in the 
sense that with dog walkers, do you get paid the same to walk this dog? 
 
No. All inclusive, no extra pay. 
 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

21:33.1   Interviewer: But do you know that the dog walkers are getting paid twenty and 
twenty-five dollars an hour? Do you also have to pick up after the dog? How did that 
make you feel? 
 
Yes, I am so aware. Of course. Well, honestly, you really feel lesser than the person that 
you are but at the same time you don't have a choice, you need a job, you have to make 
scarifies for your family, so you just do it with a smile even though you're hurting. Our 
dogs are outside. 
 
22:21.1   Interviewer: How do you feel from your heart when you have to take that dog 
walking? 
 
As I said, you really feel bad, you shiver, but you've got to go, you've got to talk it 
outside. I heard a story that one of my country-ladies when she left here she had a good 
job back in St. Vincent, and when she realized that she had to walk a dog when she was 
going in Central Park and she saw one of her other co-workers, she dropped the dog and 
ran and the people's dog got away. She felt so ashamed of herself. That will always be 
my horrible, horrible memory. 
 
23:41.3   Interviewer: What challenges or sources of tension do you face on the job? 
 
One of the things I can remember on Long Island is one day one little boy came over and 
he spit on my head, and there was no satisfaction from his mom, his parents. They 
laughed and thought it was rather funny. And you live in the house and take care of 
them and so far. Spit right on my head. Speaking about tension. It's like when the 
evening hours come and you don't put in a whole week and you can't go out to breathe 
that sigh of relief and you hear the phone ring and you hear, 'I'm stuck in traffic, I'm 
running late,' I'm telling you that's tension. Because they are always late. Freedom and 
then you hear they'll be running late. 
 
25:45.2   Interviewer: When they're running late, have you ever been compensated? 
Have you ever asked? 
 
No compensations, that adds more to the tension. Yes, often times you ask but then 
you've been ignored because they know you gone today, someone will come tomorrow. 
And speaking about tension, on another job on Long Island that used to be from 
Tuesday to Saturday live-in and they would go out on a Saturday night and you you can't 
sleep, 11:00, 12:00, 1:00 and you just want to be free and you have to call a taxi to the 
train station and you start to think, 'I'm going to miss the 2:01 train,' that is tension. 
 
27:13.2   Interviewer: How is your relationship with your current employer? 
 
I'm not employed right now, but with my last employer it's not relationship at all. On a 
sour and sad note, after twelve and a half years they left and went to Maine as they 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

went every summer and I would go over and I would clean up and wash up, and two 
years ago they went to Maine, the bigger boy he went looking for colleges, and I went 
over he came back the others were gone, and I went to wash his clothes and pack, he 
was leaving for Maine the next day, and that was it. Nobody sat down, I've never seen 
her up to now, never said goodbye to the boys. He came out the hospital and met me in 
the house, one day two days old, never get a hug, never get a goodbye. I mean, for 
these years I was comfortable. I felt loved with the family. We had a good thing, we had 
good communication, everything went well, but at the time for me to leave, that's how 
it went down. After twelve and a half years. 
 
 I can say no, but at the time that's how I felt. I saw it was coming and said let's sit down. 
All I'm asking is that you help me find a job. I told her about it, which website to go on. 
She said, 'I'm working on it,' and after three weeks she came with a pencil and a paper 
and said, 'Write your social security number there,' and I did. Nothing came out of it. 
You get tired of being tired so you do what you have to do. I started to lose trust coming 
down, I said, 'No, something is wrong.' 
 
31:52.1   Interviewer: Are there relationships with previous children you've cared for 
that are particularly memorable in a good or bad type of way? 
 
There was one little boy I raised in Long Island from eleven days old when I met him. I 
met them in Queens and from the day I walked in there just for the interview the 
mother left me with that eleven day old to go to the gym. And they were moving to a 
house in Long Island and it was under construction and the time they had to move out 
from Queens and that is what I always remember, because it reminded me of back 
home when we'd have the house and you'd put on an addition and you put down a 
plank and you walk on the wet concrete and stuff like that. I remember when they were 
doing the floor, that was the first time I ever went to the Hamptons. They had to go to 
the Hamptons to stay for a couple of days and stuff like that, so I always remember that 
little boy. 
 
33:30.3   Interviewer: What was your original agreement with your employer and was it 
violated? 
 
What could I say about violating? I think it's time. Time. Always being violated because 
you go for your interview and you sit down and they ask for ten hours, which at that 
time you agree, but you would end up there every day eleven, eleven and a half, twelve 
hours sometimes, so anything about violation it's about my time. Well, money, comes in 
there because with all this overtime you never get paid for it, never. We don't talk, we 
don't ask, even though it's hurting, it's about time. For talking about family and talking 
about time. Fortunately I've always lived alone here, but I can identify with other family, 
my sister was married she had children here that went to school, so when you work two 
hours over time and you have to run to Brooklyn and the train is delayed by a sick 
passenger then you neglect you family. 
Domestic Workers United

35:57.2   Interviewer: You have kids, right? So let's say you're on the job and you get a 
call that there's something wrong with your kids, what do you do? 
 
Well, honestly, I never have none of my kids living here with me so I never encountered 
that experience. 
 
36:26.2   Interviewer: Do you feel that the amount of hours and your holiday schedule 
are being respected? 
 
No way. I've worked in Long Island for about five years. I never get a Good Friday off, 
I've never gone to church on a Good Friday, because when you work from Tuesday to 
Saturday you can't get Good Friday off and you can't take it off because you're not going 
to get paid and you're working for $225 a week and you can't lose so you would stay on 
the job, just like on Thanksgiving. You can't stay home. They go to family and friends and 
they would bring you some left overs. 
 
37:49.0   Interviewer: We talk about your agreement. I know back then you didn't have 
any contracts or anything, so when you go to this interview you know you like to attend 
church so do you think in the future like if you go for another job, could you establish 
that you would have these days to go to church? 
 
Most definitely. I have never done it, never, I think because of fear and you're just 
walking in and thinking about the money, holding that job, so you miss out on a lot. I 
remember one time it was one of those holidays which they would claim it's not a 
holiday and when I reached the job the woman said, 'What are you doing here?' And I 
said, 'Okay, let me go home.' She said, 'No, no, no, you're here already I have something 
for you to do.' Yep. 
 
39:24.0   Interviewer: Did you get paid? Time and a half? 
 
Yes. On a holiday. No time and a half, no. You see there's where it comes in again. Even 
though you realize it's a holiday per se you're still thinking my week pay, it's my rent this 
week, I have to send some money back home for my kids. You sacrifice. 
 
39:56.3   Interviewer: When you say that you or any worker has been exploited due to 
immigration status? 
 
Yes, quite a lot. Quite a lot. For example I have an auntie she was working with these 
Africans on Long Island and because of her immigration status it's so many things. She 
worked there for many years, she couldn't get a raise, she couldn't get a raise, because 
they know of her immigration status and they would threaten her that because one 
time they had a big thing about it and then she was threatening them, well you know 
I'm here--I think for five years she raised this little girl--undocumented and you had me 
here all these years so it was like a threat between them and they just find some way 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

when the cold time got colder they gave her a little raise but in six months I remember 
telling her, they are moving. They are moving. They did not move, they just wanted to 
get rid of her. But at the time they are doctors, both of them, so who are you? 
 
42:21.2   Interviewer: Do you have your own children or family or responsibilities that 
you are taking care of? 
 
Yes, I do, I have my children and my mom who is more disabled partially blind now back 
in St. Vincent who I take care of financially. You've got to buy the food, buy the 
pampers, buy whatever to send back for her, so yes I do. 
 
42:55.3   Interviewer: So what a minute. Being around workers they mention about the 
barrel trade. Is that classified as one of the barrel trades? How do you manage balancing 
your personal life and your work life? How do you manage? 
 
Everything, in the barrel, yeah. It's very hard. Well, my life is very simple. I must honestly 
say, as a single person. I think I manage quite well because I'm too much of the kind of 
person who would go there and there, so I think I'm doing very good and would 
continue to. 
 
44:02.1   Interviewer: So how does being a domestic worker impact your own family 
life? 
 
How would I classify that, being again alone and living alone? I don't think it has that big 
of an impact, being alone. 
 
44:48.0   Interviewer: Are you a member of any groups? 
 
Yeah, I have other groups I have attend other than my church group, women's group, 
I'm also a member of my tenants association, which I love, we're out there on the front 
line and rally with rising rent hikes going on. 
 
45:21.2   Interviewer: When you are doing domestic work, do you feel supported or 
have you felt you've worked in an isolated environment? 
 
Yes, it varies. Experience with Long Island in my early years in the city I would say yes 
and no. On Long Island was very well isolated, there are not parks and playgrounds and 
this kind of thing you have to depend on the bus to come and pick up the kids and 
they're gone and you're inside there and you don't see nobody on the street you know 
the houses are away from each other so I would say you feel isolated wherein in the city 
it's a little bit different. You're always going to run to this class you want to run to this 
meeting you want to run to this afterschool program and pick up. On Long Island none 
at all, that's where the isolation comes in.

46:52.3   Interviewer: When and why did you become a part of Domestic Workers 
United and how did you hear about it? 
 
I became a member of Domestic Workers United now over ten years more than ten 
years and the other question is how did I hear about? I was in Barnes and Nobles 
bookstore on the Upper West Side with a little boy in the winter time. You can't go to 
the park but you've got to find somewhere to go. So we would go there and read the 
books for hours inside there and I remember one time inside there there were two 
ladies and they were handing out some flyers and one of the girls sitting next to one of 
the baby sitters took it, I did not. I did not take it, but I peeked at it and I read and I was 
all about and I honestly felt that I had no need for that so I honestly didn't take it, but 
then a couple weeks after back in the same place the same two ladies came in and there 
were not many sitters inside and so she came directly up to me and she handed me the 
flyers. I took it and I put it in the stroller and when I got home I put it in my bag and on 
the train I read it. I honestly still didn't pay no mind, but there was a lady, one of the 
founding members at that time who used to ride the train together, we got off at the 
same stop. And I heard her inviting another lady to this big event they were going to 
have and I was in the middle, she was on the left and then she asked me if I was 
interested and I asked about what and then she handed me one of the same flyers I had 
ignored but I took it and that Saturday I went and understanding what it was what it was 
all about and who it was for and who it was representing it was a place I would like to be 
and from there on that's the way I became a member. 
 
49:46.1   Interviewer: What was it like getting there for there for the very first time? 
 
It was a very very good feeling. They had a big it was somewhere in Manhattan, lots of 
people were there and going there I remember one special person who was sitting at 
the table who was doing the signing in. She had also known me but was not expecting 
me being there and she greeted me very well and found me a seat and from there on 
you could feel the love, you could feel. I don't think it was Judson Memorial. 
 
50:48.1   Interviewer: So what has it meant for you and your work to have the Domestic 
Bill of Rights passed in 2010? 
 
What it meant for me is that after the Bill of Rights passed we had a voice for the 
voiceless. We had a little haven. We had a little back a little shoulder to lean on 
especially the undocumented black Caribbean women. That gave me hope. That lifted 
my spirit. We had something to lean on. 
 
51:42.2   Interviewer: So far has it worked for the domestic workers? Why is it important 
to you? What impact do you think it has had on the domestic work industry? 
I don't think it worked for every domestic worker or if any maybe little or nothing. I 
don't think it had much of an impact, and my reason for saying that the bill was pass and 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
10
we as domestic workers were happy, excited, but I don't think that employers had took 
it that seriously for me it was just passed and here it stuck under the table. 
 
53:07.2   Interviewer: Employers, were they educated about the bill of rights? Did 
anyone take the time to educate employers that this is a bill that had to be respected? 
 
I don't think anybody did it, of course there are some employers who know about it, but 
they would ignore it and there are some nannies here we go again because of being 
undocumented that know about it, they're happy that there's a bill passed, but they are 
not they would go on a interview and they are not going in there and saying, 'Well, 
missus, I wanted to have a conversation with you and this is the bill of rights and we 
should be working 40 hours per week, we should get overtime, we should get overtime, 
everybody just scared. Here we go again. Being undocumented. 
 
54:32.0   Interviewer: What would you like to see happen in the future for domestics?  
 
What I would love to see happen is that the legislatures in charge, whoever, governor 
whatever, councilman, they should see and make sure that these employers are fully 
aware that there is a bill out there that supports Domestic Workers United and should 
be implemented and there should be some penalty for those that don't abide with it. 
That's one thing I'd love to see done in the future. 
 
55:19.1   Interviewer: From your perspective, why is Domestic Workers United 
important to domestic workers? 
 
Thanks to Domestic Workers United. It's very important I know it was for me, because a 
voice for the voiceless I say again and Domestic Workers United has done so much for 
workers who did not have a voice in terms of so many problems on the job overworked 
and underpaid, that's one of the big mountains we have to climb and I have say because 
I went there, I always encourage people, domestic workers, nannies, don't be afraid. 
Domestic Workers United are here for you and that's why we take time off to go out 
and do what we have to do and that's why we're trying to keep it alive and alive it's 
going to stay. It's a voice for the undocumented. 
 
56:37.0   Interviewer: I also understand that Domestic Workers United has also won 
justice for many many domestic workers, like 1.5 million, justice for domestic workers. 
 
I was one of them. That's where it comes in again. After being so honestly denied thanks 
to Domestic Workers United. After being so abruptly discharged from your job after 
twelve and a half years thanks to Domestic Workers United and Urban Justice Center 
that I just went into the office, filed my complaint, and they took my case and dealt with 
those employers and then I was compensated for my overtime for twelve and half 
years.

57:44.0   Interviewer: So what you're saying is Domestic Workers United working in 
collaboration with Urban Justice Center. How much did that cost you? 
 
Absolutely nothing. Free, free, free. It was pro bono. 
 
58:10.0   Interviewer: What do you want the legislature to know? 
 
What I want them to know is that we are human and all work all work is equal and 
domestic work, nanny work, we play a big part in the lives of all employers. In the whole 
country, wherever nannies. So what I want the legislatures to know is give us a fair fair 
wage. It's about time. Because it's hard work. It's very hard work to raise you prized 
possession. Most of them, they're immigrants like us, and you here them say, 'Oh, my 
mom was a domestic worker, my mom was a domestic worker, my grandmother was a 
domestic worker,' and it doesn't mean being just a nanny, you are a domestic worker, 
you know so much you clean the houses, do the laundry, just to make ends meet. I think 
it helped in getting the bills passed because some of them would stand out with us, rally 
with us. So I think it helped in that way. 
 
1:01:11.0   Interviewer: Are you happy with the bill they passed? Give me advice, one 
thing you think could be done differently. 
 
I would say yes and no. I say yes because it's a start. There was nothing there but I'm 
just thinking, well, it's time that we get something more added to it. It didn't do really 
anything much. One of the things that was never, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think 
that we had got a living wage, we didn't get a set price, what per hour, and that is what I 
would like to see. 
 
1:01:45.2   Interviewer: So the bill that Governor Patterson signed, was that the original 
bill? Or was it stripped down? For instance, my understanding is that when Domestic 
Workers first went to Albany they were looking for like $17 an hour and it was also 
categorized as if you're taking care of two kids it's one price, if you're taking care of four 
kids it'd be more than taking care of two kids. Was that ever implemented? So this is 
why I ask the question, was it the original bill? 
Stripped down.  
No, I don't think so. A lot of work. 
 
1:02:49.0   Interviewer: What areas of education/skills are you looking to gain? 
 
Well, if I'm going to continue in the domestic work, nanny work, I'd love to improve. I'd 
love to learn different languages because in New York or maybe the whole there are so 
many different cultures and different languages and like a few nights ago I went to the 
emergency room with my cousin, spent the whole night, and all you can hear around 
you the different languages the guy who came in was from Africa right and there was a 
lady on the bed there and she was from Africa and they were talking their own

language. You know so I think language, I would love  love to learn one or two different 
languages. The children, so many Asian children, nannies have more preferences now, 
bilingual nanny will get a better job because you've got to be a caregiver and a teacher 
at one time, so I'd love to improve. 
 
1:04:36.2   Interviewer: What skills did Domestic Workers United teach you? 
 
Domestic Workers United, being with them helped obtain my nanny training certificate. 
I got several-- Domestic Workers United partnered with Cornell University and that's 
where I obtained my certificate. I also got my computer, my basic computer skills there, 
which I'm so happy and so proud about because I absolutely had no computer skills 
leaving St. Vincent, being a postmistress, doing accounting with the government money, 
you sit there the whole day with a book and a pen. A big thick book and a pen, because 
you have to get every penny right, sale and balance. Every end amount when the 
postmaster general will come up when you don't expect them right? So you've got to do 
your sales and balance and you want to see me hide it and wrap it up in  a bag because 
you're not supposed to take it from the office but hey, you've got to go home to meet 
your kids so that's what you're going to do. Take your time and [whooshing sound.] and 
you're going to start from up there and they're going to see where you did it wrong 
instead of ten ten cent stamp that's and ninety cent stamp and there'll all come down 
there. There were no computers and calculator skills so that's one of the things I was 
always grateful for, learning the computer from Domestic Workers United, yep. 
 
1:06:51.1   Interviewer: So after listening to you in this last question, you came to 
America looking for the American dream as a postal worker. 
 
Yes, which I don't say much. I was in charge of the district post office. Well you opened 
it every morning, got the government keys, the mail van would come, you deal with 
money, you deal with registered letters and stuff like that you had to give a--but here 
we go again. All we want is a piece of the American dream. 
 
1:07:42.2   Interviewer: So how did you really feel being a qualified professional postal 
worker and have to transition into being a domestic worker. 
I mean, it was very very hard. Sometimes it brings tears to your eye. Sometimes you feel 
bad about what you left there, but I honestly don't have regrets and if you ask me why, 
salary wise, it was nothing compared to coming here and working for two hundred and 
twenty-five dollars that was my first week's salary in Long Island I can remember. 
 
1:08:44.0   Interviewer: All the people all over the world do this transition. I think it was 
the economy that forced people out of their countries to come here to get a piece of 
this American dream. But you know what, kudos to you. So before we finish, how is 
cultural expression used as a tool for advocacy and outreach of Domestic Workers 
United such as music, dance, poetry.

Let me see if I get that.  Well, the little that I can say from my experience from Domestic 
Workers, had we not come from the islands with a little bit of culture, mixed together, I 
personally could not have been a part of the cultural committee for domestic workers 
for such a long time in which that helped us thanks to sister Christine, that we could 
have been a part of the public theater for the past three years and even perform at the 
Delacorte Theater for the past three years. 
 
1:10:55.1   Interviewer: Do you have any last words you would like to share.  
 
My parting shot is that I'm very happy and I'm proud to be a domestic worker. It has 
done me well. I stayed the course, I kept the faith, it has done me well I have no regrets, 
I have honestly no regret and I would encourage anybody everybody black, strong, 
woman don't be afraid, don't be afraid, if you've got to do it, you have to do it with 
respect. There is no shame in the game as sister friend would say because at the end of 
the day that's what puts the food on the table, especially for single parents. And that's 
why I can say thanks to Domestic Workers, thanks, again Domestic Workers United, 
again thanks to the United States of America. 
 
1:12:26.2   Interviewer: One more question, would you recommend anybody Domestic 
Workers United to tell their stories and why?  
 
I would, I would, because it's very thoughtful very, I can't find words to describe it, to 
know that we can sit down and share our story. It's such a great honor such a great 
opportunity that when ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred years from now our children, 
grandchildren, great grandchildren, great great grandchildren can go to the Library of 
Congress and know that grandma's voice is here, her story is here, tell about the hard 
life, the hard knocks, 'Oh, was it that bad? We didn't know, we were getting everything 
we wanted, we never knew grandma had it so hard even though she's gone, the 
memories, the thoughts, the voice could live on, so I would encourage anybody to share 
their story. 
 
1:13:46.2   Interviewer: So at this point I also want to thank you for sharing your story. It 
was wonderful. 
 
Thank you Chris, for collaborating with us so we can have our stories in the Library of 
Congress, and it can't get any better. Yes, no, I shouldn't say that, it always could get 
better. 
 
Long live domestic workers, yes.
