Dear Mrs.  Dugqan,
 
I am sure that you are aware that we are hdvino a
 
John A.  Lomax Gatherinq here in Meridian on February 27th
 
honoring John A.  Lomax.
 The proceeds from this festival will
 
qo to the Bosque County Collection for their building fund.
 
The Bosque County Collection is a historical research
 
center for local Bosque County History,  and we have collections
 
of
 documents,  manuscripts,  photographs,  old county newspapers,
 
and any type of historical material we can save.
 
We would be ever so grateful to you if you have photographs
 
of the Lomax family which we could copy and add to our collection
 
of photographs.
 We are planning to have an exhibit on John
 
A.  Lomax when we move into our building.
 
We have purchased an old rock building across from the court-
house and are now in the process of renovating it for our invaluable
 
collection which is now located on the third floor of the court-
house.
 
We appreciate any help you might give us.
 
Sincerely,
 
Elizabeth Torrence,  Chr.

Lomax was born a

I
t was here Lomax g

20 y

Dear Joan;
 
•
;  10 thorou hly enjoyed our June p
owwow in the Barker
 
history Center.
 hare the time has ared t
o since, though, is
 
something else eain.  Hopefully there i
s something in the old
 
folksaying that the rapid pass ge of t
ime is a sign of good
 
mental health.  In any event, it was a joy to see you all again
 
and a delight t
o hear that the Bosaue dedication was a success.
 
With particular reference to the Lomax Study, I will take
 
your several queries in order:
 
Ia.  Are out-of-pocket expenses of family members fundable?
 
Actually, since we have attempted to concentrate all new
 
purchases in Section B of my Juae memo to hr. Folmer, there
 
really should be no expenses other than those that the
 
University will cover in routine fashion from the Lomax
 
Fund.  This does not, of course, extend t
o the family
 
photographs for the wall opposite the JAL portrait.  This
 
is a subject that we began to discuss after our initial
 
conversation and I have never known exactly how to handle
 
the matter.
 
lb.  Eligibility for income tax deductions for gifts of records,
 
books, tapes, and so on?  Unless the IRS people go even
 
crazier in future than they have been in the past, there is
 
no reason why we cannot continue to treat gifts in kind as
 
we have in the past.  We can make arrangements for appraisals,
 
reports can be made to you by the appraiser, and you can
 
handle your tax business as you have been doing.
 
2
.  Overlap in Nos. 3 and 4 in Section C of my June memo?  The
 
overlap is more apparent than real.  In No. 3 I am referring
 
to any pertinent documentation that you, Alan, and your
 
sisters may still own individually and wish t
o add to the
 
fr
ni1y collection individually.  In 11
1o. 4 I am referring to
 
our hopes eventually to secure records from persons outside
 
your immediate family.  Cousins, friends, and associates
 
quite often come up with copies of letters and other records
 
for which there are no carbons in a collection creator's
 
files.  We firmly intend eventually to try to tap these sources
 
for t
.o ioiax Co L
. etion, and t
ii
s  is  nat jO.  4 refers to.
 
This sort of activity  oes on forever and ever in arc ivn1
 
pr0yr01r53.  Ass±st nee here from you, Alan, ,:
nd your s
isters
 
will initially be in the foem of 5u aeetior
.s.

his series
 
in 1969.  The rest that you still have would be most aa ropri—
 
ate a
ciditicas t
o the collection at some t
ia'  in  future '
.
 
I hope that the above helps a bit, John, in your ac -)
roach to
 
the rest of the family.  If I am still beirs sonewhst vsyue or

This serves to catch up ariiewhat on family affairs.
 In our
 
separ.te busy lives I fear we're drifting apart, and it behooves us
 
to give the  time and effort for more letters and get-togethers so
 
needed to maintain our affection and interest in each other.
 
I enclose the good story in the Meridian Times on the June 13th
 
Dedication al at the site of th3 Historical Marker for father's boyhood
 
home in Bosque County.
 Also enclosed is the copy on the marker.
 The
 
occasion came off nicely though my remarks and songs during my speech
 
were often drowned by the traffic noise from the hiway immediately
 
adjacent to the Site.
 Our good cousin, J. T. Lona x drove us on 2 ax
 
long sightseeing trips around the beautiful County spiced with good
 
talk of fai(illy history and anecgdotes.
 His father Addle is now 94
 
and Mother, minnie 92, both kicking and have been married 66 years 1
 
En route to 1eridian Iimi and I spent a busy 1- hours with Drs.
 
Chester Kielman, Archivist and Fred Folmar, Librarian of the U. of Tex
 
in the brand new Library-History complex.
 We deferred a visit to the
 
gaudy LBJ Building adjacent to the Sid Richardson Bldg.  (
on the hill
 
east of the old campus) which houses the John A. Lomax Study, whose
 
west picture window views both the East Mall and the principal edifices
 
of the sprawling, huge university.
 The Study is beginning to develop
 
into a warm and useful memorial,
 Father's Portrait hangs of
t the end
 
wall of the normal sized room above an appropriate antique-type roll-
type des1!u
.sed many years by Librarian Winkler bu t ac tua l
]ysiiuilar to
 
one used by father for manyg
,,
Xear
n te old Main Building.
 The next
 
side wall is taken up by
 book shelves.
 
Present planning is for the Study to be completed into a colorful,
 
living Memorial by such more or less permanent displays:
 
1
)  A plaque next to the Portrait listing father's achievements
 
and act1viti s as a University administrator  and a summary of his
 
folk song accomplishments. 
1
1
 
2)
 Displays in the book-shelves of colorful record jackets of
 
some of our commercial folk song issues.
 
3
)  Displays in the book-shelves of all of the Lomax books and
 
other publications (likely under glass to prevent pilferage).
 
L
i
.
)  Card Catalogs cross-indexed listing
 
a)  All Lomax collected fD1k songs or other material avail-
able to be listened to on tapes filed in the nearby
 
Oral History RoQm facilities NKar by scholars or just
 
interested parties.
 
b)  A summary t
hf the voluminous JAL and family manuscripts,
 
letters and other papers now housed nearby and avail-
able for research.
 
5
)  Comfortable desk space for students or visiting scholars
 
to use •
 -
 t t
..
 
6)
 Color 8" X 10' photos with name plates, to hang bel w the
 
Portrait.
 
For conformity I su
est a he ld and shu lders
 
I enclose recent correspondence with Dr. Kielman with his pertinent
 
run-down of the essential material and work needed for proper consumma-
tion of the project since each of you will be asked to cooperate for
 
i
is part.
 I anticipate such requests will come to you directly from
 
Dr. Kielman;
 I continue to be busy in my business affairs, am not at
 
the scene, and he can best coordinate the Room's completion.
 You'll
 
note from the correspondence that l
ie's stated that you can be paid for
 
you submitted records, books, etc. from funds already available,
 
you decide to donate such material) 7
. akA it would be appr alded f

 you
 
I Income Tax return.
 The only item  no t re im bursa
ble  to  you,
 per  my
 
JAL Page 2  7-6-71
 
understanding with Dr. Kielman, is the cost of your photo;
 this should
 
not be much since you could merely enlarge the negative of a good snap.
 
I
've put in a lot of time and thought on this matter, as you know,
 
but to put it over the top from here on in, your ideas and help are
 
necessary.
 Wh n asked by Dr. Kielman,  I
'm counting on each of you
 
to do your part in a reasonable time.
 
As to the personal life of my tribe
 Both boys here now.
 
Joe just arrived with honors Diploma.
 He's been accepted by Interna-
tional Volunteer Students for 2 years of teaching of English in Algeria
 
in a secondary school--a formidable and challenging job.
 He goes to
 
Washington soon for indoctrination and has much to do before September
 
departure lining up just what materials for teaching aids to these Arabs.
 
John has found himself, occupied ple asantly in his chosen job in the
 
Research Dept. of the main City Library.
 He and Bidy are enjoying
 
much the small home recently bought about l  miles from us.
 John
 
Nova is a ch arming ball of fire and a real winner.
 Mimi is just 10
 
days out of an 8 day diagnostic-treatment stay in the hospital.
 She
 
is much better and has sloughed her horrible cough.
 The diagnosis
 
thankfully
  eliminated any need for lung surgery (
previously thought
 
indicated) but detailed x-rays show a persistent infection from an ob-
scure-type viru
.s.
 She is on a different anti-biotic medication, plus
 
voluminous daily liquid intake for an indefinite period.
 Shirley
 
iix± g again living with Susan and Krishna in Galveston vi
by
 
Lisa.
 Shirley has rented a house in central Colorado for about 18
 
days beginning the 10th to coincide with Susan's vacation;
 any or all
 
of us are invited to take our chances there.
 As for me, life is full
 
and coming up aces.
 Have just completed the annual check-up of my
 
neck area, all negative,  I
' m turned loose for 2 years, so it appears
 
l
ive licked the big C U
 I have a handball trophy for 1st place
 
in a 1971 tourney and was elected by the players the the Texas Handball
 
Hall of Fame.
 Mimi and I have a gaudy vacation definitely planned in
 
September to Hawaii, coniderably paid for by building credits by HM ston
 
Natural Gas and plan on a 2/3 day stop-over in Santa Monica  with Bess
 
if she'll take in the wayfarers.

WHY WE CAME TO TEXAS 
Mrs.  Susan  (James Avery)  Lomax
 
November 26,  1914 -
 Meridian,
 
Texas
 
I have been requested to write something of our trip to
 
Texas.
 Wish  I could write  something real good but will do
 
the best  I can.
 It must be remembered that I did not have
 
the  chance  of  an education as you of the present day has.
 
There's difference  from 1835  to  1914  of training the mind.
 
As  I said I will do the best I can.
 
1st  why we  came  to  Texas,  for  many  reasons:  1st  we
 
wanted to come to a new country so our children could grow
 
up with a- ee
-etirz-t
-ry the  country.
 We were  living  on  a
 
good farm,  had a tanyard.
 My husband was a tanner by trade,
 
but he was  never  a very  stout man  (the men  there  did  not
 
live,  very  few there over  sixty-five years  old).
 He  said
 
that  he  would  live  ten  years  longer  by  coming  to  a new
 
country,  you hardly ever  saw a gray-headed man.
 I did not
 
want to come to Texas at all,  I dreaded the Indians in those
 
days,  for  they  roamed  all  over  this  part  of  Texas.
 The
 
thought  troubled me.
 For  some  time  I thought  the  matter
 
over and decided to come,  as my husband had better judgment
 
than I did.
 I though if coming to Texas would lengthen his
 
life by ten years  I was willing to undertake  the  trip.
 I
 
came willing and have never regretted one moment,  but oh how
 
sorry  I was  to  leave  our  Miss,  home,  where  six  of  my
 
children were born,  four came with us,  two  left back there
 
in  Shady  Grove  graveyard,  that  was  the  saddest  thing  to
 
leave.
 But we  are here,  been  living  in and near Meridian
 
since  1869,  have  never been back  to  see  the  first home  I
 
ever had.
 Had a chance once,  will always regret it that  I
 
did not go when my  son John kindly offered  to pay my way
 
back.
 Now I feel that I will never return to the old state.
 
I have lived all these years and have gotten to love the new
 
country as well or better than the one I left.
 Have raised
 
all my children here.
 They are all married and of to them-
selves.
 I have a little home of my own that I love to stay
 
at.
 It  is  such a blessing  to own  a home of your own.
 I
 
hope to be able to keep house as long as I live if it is the
 
will of my Heavenly Father.
 
HOW WE CAME TO TEXAS
  
On the 1st of Nov.  1869 we left our Miss,  home in a new
 
waggon with to big mule to it,  another waggon with a yoke of
 
oxen  to  it.
 My husband wanted his daughter to come,  so he
 
furnished the waggon and oxen for them so they could come to
 
the new country also.
 The mules were name Fan and Jack,  the
 
oxen Bright and Berry.
 Those were  fine teams.
 My husband
 
wanted  to come  that way  so he would have  his  waggons  and
 
teams  when we  got here.
 We  landed here  the  29th of Dec.
 
1869.
 
Now  I would  like  to  tell  you  some  happenings  on our
 
trip.
 The morning we left our home among the pine hills of
 
Holmes  Co.,  Miss.  it  was  a beautiful  frosty morning.
 I
 
braced up  after we  passed  the  little  Shady  Grove  Church,
 
determined  to do the very best  that  I could.
 Our  lu[n]ch
 
baskets  were well  packed,  seemed  to  be  enough  to  do  the
 
trip,  but how hungry  it makes  folks  to  travel,  especially
 
boys.
 I had three of my own and two stepsons.
 The children
 
could not play but had to do something,  so they had to eat
 
many times throughout the day.
 I think we were  four days
 
getting to Vicksburgh.
 That  
 we crossed the river in a
 
ferry boat; we camped just on the other side that night.
 We
 
got up early  so we  could cross  and go as  far  as  possible
 
that day,  but we did not cross  the  river until  late  that
 
evening.
 There were a line of waggons before us  I think a
 
mile long, waiting to put across.
 We crossed,  drove a short
 
distance and camped.
 All those  folks were coming to Texas.
 
We had two tents and everything to make us as comfortable as
 
possible.
 How we did enjoy  it,  for several days  at least
 
especially the children.
 It finally got tiresome sitting in
 
the waggons all day.
 There twelve in our crowd, my family,
 
husband and four children  (my brother who married my step-
daughter)  (
I married a widder with five children)  three of
 
those were with us.
 The Bro.  had two little boys,  Tom and
 
Jim Cooper.
 
After  leaving Vicksburg we  came  up  the  Miss.  River
 
forty  miles.
 Through  the  s
  were  some  such muddy
 
places,  this kind that sticks like tar.
 One evening we come
 
to the worst place we had struck at any time before.
 The
 
mules pulled,  surged,  struggled,  pull all their shoes off.
 
Their  feet would pop almost as  loud as a pistol.
 With all
 
the hooping,  hollering the mules  failed to move the wagon.
 
In their effort to get out one fell down and the other fell
 
on top.
 The boys got them up and out someway.
 I was in the
 
wagon but would  not  look,  I felt  so  sorry  for the mules.
 
The boys drove them out,  unhitched the wage-oxen,  drove them
 
in and hitched to the wagon.
 They just walked out with the
 
wagon,  why so easy,  because  the oxen have  cloven  feet and
 
the mud does not stick to their feet like it does to horses
 
or mules.
 We soon were off again.
 That was the only time
 
-2-
the mules  ever  failed to pull  us  through mud.
 We  shipped
 
out household goods.
 We had fine weather all through except
 
some rains and one storm that blue our tent down on me and I
 
did not wake up for some time.
 I was  too tired to even be
 
wakened by a storm.
 
The men and boys  had guns  and dogs,  would go hunting
 
sometimes at night after we camped and sometimes they would
 
take a gun and go ahead and never  failed to bring  in  some
 
game  of  some  kind,  one  time  a coon.
 They dressed  it  and
 
some ate it,  not I though.
 
There were some little incidents happened on our trip I
 
would like to tell.
 1st my son Richard who was twelve years
 
old had a cat that he thought a great deal of.
 He would not
 
consent to leave it so he said he would bring him to Texas
 
with him.
 He was very well contented all day when we camped
 
the first night his papa said to him you had better shut the
 
cat up.
 He said no he will not leave me.
 In the night we
 
heard cats  fighting.
 Richard got up,  called Kitty,  but he
 
was gone.
 2nd.
 Next,  as we  left the bottom we came to an
 
old house.
 Seems the  folks who had  lived there had packed
 
their things in one room  (there was two large rooms,  a hall
 
between) ,
 the other was  open.
 As  it  looked  like  rain we
 
cleaned  it out and used it  for sleeping.
 There was a big
 
old chimney and a good  fireplace  for us  to do our cooking
 
(we  always  did  out  cooking  f
 er  at  night  for  next  day).
 
Early next morning we heard a chicken crow.
 When the boys
 
got up they found a hen and rooster.
 They caught them,  gave
 
me the hen.
 My bro.  took the other,  named the rooster Jim,
 
kept him I think a week before they killed him.
 He was lots
 
of company for the children.
 He would crow often.
 When we
 
would stop for lunch at twelve,  they would put him out.
 He
 
would stay around until we were  ready  to  start,  would  let
 
one of the children pick him up and put him in the wagon.
 
3rd.
 One day we came to where there were a long row of nice
 
cabins  where  Negroes  had  lived  (
some  still  lived  there).
 
There was a large pecan tree in front of the cabins,  loaded
 
with  the  finest  pecans.
 Oh,  how delighted  the  children
 
were.
 We stopped for them to pick up some.
 My brother was
 
a good climber.
 He cut a long flail and commenced to climb
 
up  (some little darkeys said look at that white man going up
 
the  tree  like  a squirrel),  went  to  thrashing.
 The ground
 
was covered almost  (there was  about  fifteen in our crowd),
 
began picking up.
 We gathered enough to do us a long time.
 
They were the largest I had ever seen and the  first we had
 
seen.
 We  all  did  enjoy  the  fun  of  gathering  those  fine
 
nuts.
 
-3-
When we crossed the Red River at Shreveport we came to
 
the  first prairie covered with miskeets.
 I asked how long
 
do you  suppose  this  orchard has  lain out... looked exactly
 
like an orchard that had lain out for years.
 Shreveport to
 
Corsicana,  to  Hillsboro,  crossed  the  Brazos  River  at
 
Towerash,  then  to  what  is  now Morgan  (it  was  then  the
 
Nichols  place)  then on  to Dr.  Russell's  on Steal's Creek.
 
But one house then between Morgan and the Dr.'s
 Oh, what a
 
bleak-looking  country  it  was,  not  a tree  in  sight.
 I
 
remember so well what a dinner we had at Dr.  Russell's that
 
day  (we  got  there  about  dinner  time).
 There was  a large
 
dish filled with turnips and greens,  cooked together with a
 
large  square  of  beef  that  looked  exactly  like  streaked
 
bacon.
 I had never  seen  anything  like  that  before,  beef
 
cooked with greens,  but I must say I thought that was  the
 
best thing I had ever tasted,  so I handed my plate  for the
 
second  helping.
 It  was  simply  delicious;  I will  always
 
remember that dinner.
 
My husband and Dr.  Russell went the next day to look at
 
a place on the Bosque that was for sale.
 He liked it.
 The
 
next day he went back and closed the deal.
 The next day we
 
hitched up and moved to our first Texas home.
 When we went
 
to  leave,  the Dr.  he went out,  climbed up  into  a liveoak
 
tree,  took down a large shoulder of meat and put it in the
 
wagon, which was very acceptable.
 
I never did see an Indian although they made raids all
 
over the country in those days.
 We rented land across the
 
Bosque River the first year.
 All the boys my husband had to
 
go  to work,  took  their dinner,  I was  left with my  little
 
baby and John all day alone.
 I felt like I might be scalped
 
at any time.
 I put in some unhappy hours those times.
 We
 
had  to  take  our mules  up  a ravine  moonlight  nights,  the
 
Indians made their raids on those bright nights.
 One time
 
in my life I was sorry to see the moon shine.
 Men went with
 
their pistols buckled on,  never went without their pistols
 
and big  jingling  spurs.
 The men and boys  all  had a pony
 
apiece and never rode only in a lope,  or rather as  fast as
 
the horse could go.
 You never saw a horse walking but going
 
full  speed with  pistol  buckled  on  and  jingling  spurs  on
 
foot.
 Think of it now.
 
Trials and hardships were plenty.
 It was a hard time
 
on women.
 They staid at home and did the work while the men
 
were on their ponies hunting or looking after stock.
 There
 
was a good many turkeys here,  deer also.
 Dr.  Russell killed
 
a gobbler one morning  soon  after we got here that weighed
 
-4-
twenty  lbs.  dressed  (
he  came out and stayed all night with
 
us) .
 We could hear  the  turkeys  gobble  every morning  just
 
before day.
 We had plain things to eat,  plenty of meat and
 
bread.
 We bought a beef that weighed eight hundred lbs.  for
 
seven dollars.
 We put it up for winter use.
 We had pork,
 
but  [as]  to dainties,  we never had.
 I would make big pots
 
of lye hominy which we all enjoyed well.
 We soon had a lot
 
of chickens.
 I begin  to have  a little pocket money  as  I
 
sold eggs  the  first Christmas  for  forty cts.  and they came
 
for  them  from Meridian.
 I made  all  my  own  soap,  never
 
thought of buying a pound,  only for the hands.
 I did all my
 
own washing, made all the clothes  for the family,  kept them
 
clean.
 They never went with  [holes]  in clothes  or  stock-
ings.
 I have the satisfaction of having done the very best
 
I can by my children.
 I have never  left one  at any  time
 
only when in sickness  I used to ride horseback  to  see  the
 
sick; when I had to go my husband would stay with them until
 
I got back.
 He was  always  so patient,  specially with  the
 
baby.
 I have had to get up at night many times to go see to
 
some  sick  child  or  woman  who  needed  help;  hardly  ever
 
visited.
 Our neighbors were few.
 Our greatest pleasure was
 
going across the mountain for a visit to Dr.  Russell's.
 We
 
hitched up two mules to the wagon,  put some quilts  for the
 
children to sit and lie on.
 How they did enjoy those trips.
 
We would go Saturday  [eve]ning and stay until Sunday even-
ing.
 That was  one  of  our  greatest  pleasures  for  a long
 
time.
 We had  lots  of butter and milk,  never was without.
 
We took several papers,  stayed at home and amused ourselves
 
the best we could with what we had,  and was satisfied.
 
There was so many fish in the Bosque;  I have seen them
 
in ten feet of water caught them in February.
 The water was
 
so clear  that you could  see  them  swimming  that deep.
 My
 
husband made a li[
  
]
; we caught lots in it.
 Some-
times they would find basket half filled, with all sizes of
 
catfish.
 We were  seven miles  from town the  first year or
 
two,  sometimes we would go  there  to preaching,  not  often
 
though.
 After the first year we had or own wheat, had to go
 
ten miles to get it ground into  flour.
 Sometimes  it would
 
take more  than a day to make  the  trip;  then I had to  fix
 
bedding  and  something  to  eat,  especially  if  they  had  to
 
drive the oxen which they did several times.
 
Why we bought  land  on the  Bosque  instead  upland was
 
because  the  upland was  an  open bleak.
 We  had to have  a
 
house  as we  got  here  in midwinter,  Dec  the  29th.   
 
little  children.
 We  could have bought walnut country  for
 
fifty  cents  per  acre,  but  we  were  afraid.
 People  were
 
-5-
having trouble with their land in those days,  so many had to
 
pay for it twice.
 We always had plenty to eat and wear.
 I
 
saved  and worked  and  sometimes would  get  so  disappointed
 
that we go on so poorly financially.
 I would work at night
 
after  I put my children to bed,  sometimes  I could do more
 
work at night than I did in daytime.
 During the day I had
 
to cook  three meals  a day,  then  so many  little wants  to
 
attend to from the children.
 I always was certain to see to
 
every little  [want]  if possible.
 I'm glad I did,  for there
 
are no wants now for me to attend to,  of my own;  sometimes I
 
wish there was.
 How they grow up and are gone from you,  oh,
 
so quickly.
 Enjoy them while you can.
 
When we  sold out our  household  things,  cows,  horses,
 
mules  with  our  home,  we  had  in  cash  about  four  thousand
 
dollars in gold.
 It was given me to take care of.
 I made a
 
broad belt,  sewed in a twenty dollar gold piece.
 There were
 
two rows of the twenty pieces that I was to ware around my
 
waist.
 I found I could not do it,  for it was too heavy.
 We
 
had  another  belt  that  held  the  ballance  that my  husband
 
tried to ware.
 Well what did we do with it?
 I had a willow
 
basket that held half bushel,  with a strong handle.
 I put
 
one down in the bottom of basket,  the belt I made for myself
 
I tied to one handle,  laid the belt down on bottom,  tied the
 
other end to the other handle.
 That basket was never moved
 
from the wagon one time except by your father or myself.
 I
 
never was  so uneasy.
 It was put right beside me at night.
 
I have waked up many times,  felt always for the basket.
 The
 
basket  was  always  packing  full  of  ether--4
4 gs  varous
 
things.
 I never was so relieved as I was when I was through
 
caring  for  that  basket.
 As  soon  as  we  landed  at
 
Dr.  Russell's I gave up the contents of my wonderful basket.
 
I had kept watch over it thirty days and nights.
 Sometimes
 
when I felt uneasy I would raise the cover and put it under
 
close  to my  side.
 It was  a responsibility but  I got  it
 
safely through.
 I thought it was a responsible place to be
 
in.
 It never was of my mind.
 I don't think the children
 
knew a thing about it.
 I would always tell them that it was
 
to heavy  for  them to  lift,  so  they offered  to  do  it one
 
time.

Well,  son,  here is what I have written.
 Almost ashamed
 
to  send  it  to you,  but  if  I have  said  one  or  two  little
 
things that will help you,  I will be glad.
 I have kept the
 
book and you can ask me any questions  and  I will  tell you.
 
Please don't count the missed spelled words.
 You see where
 
I have corrected one word several times.
