Retired rural mail carrier Stephanie Endicott of Richmond, KY put me in touch with rural carriers Lorna 
Atwater and John Buckler of Berea, KY.  
 
Retired rural mail carriers Lorna Atwater (b. 1954) and John Buckler (b. 1964, Versailles, KY) of Berea, 
KY met at a rural mail carriers’ convention and served together as president and vice president, 
respectively, for the National Rural Letter Carriers Association union district. They have been married 
since 2002. Lorna started carrying the mail in 1986 and worked out of the Berea Post Office (my partner’s 
parents’ house was on her route) until she retired in 2018. She also trained new rural mail carriers for 8 
years. John carried the mail for 34 years out of the Versailles Post Office. In this interview they talk about 
how the work and technology changed over their combined 64 years working for the Postal Service, their 
strong relationships with their customers, and the landscape and environment along their routes, among 
other topics.

LA: Lorna Atwater 
JB: John Buckler 
EH: Emily Hilliard 
 
00:00 
EH: Alright, it's February 24th, I'm in Berea, Kentucky. Why don't you introduce yourselves, tell me your 
names, the year you were born, and where you're from? 
 
LA: My name's Lorna Atwater. I've lived in Berea since I was 11. My dad was in the Air Force and we 
came here when he retired. So I'm from a lot of places but mostly Berea. Did I say born in '54? 
 
EH: The year. Yeah, alright. What about you? 
 
JB: My name's John Buckler, and I'm from Versailles and I was born in 1964. 
 
EH: So why don't you tell me about your interest in becoming a rural mail carrier? 
 
LA: (laughs) A guy I went to high school with called me up in the summer of 1986 and he said, "Hey, my 
sub just quit. Do you want to come work for me at the post office?" Back then rural carriers could appoint 
their own subs. But I got in just under the wire, because like 2 months after I was hired, they couldn't do 
that anymore. So I took the test and became a rural carrier. That Master's degree in elementary education 
that I have did not pay as much as being a rural carrier. And so I substitute taught for 8 years and made 
$33 a day at first. At the same time I was making $109 at the post office. It was $9.32 an hour in 1986 and 
that was a lot of money. 
 
EH: Yeah! Definitely! 
 
LA: So that was my interest! (laughs) Plain and simple.  
 
01:57  
 
EH: (laughs) What about you? 
 
JB: I had been laid off from a factory and the mail carrier out on the route asked me what I was doing and 
I said, "I just got laid off." He said, "Why don't you come work for me?" So I went and did an interview 
and was hired as an RCR which is a position, it was a position I don't think they have anymore. How 
many rural carrier...RCRs, they have anymore... 
 
LA: RCR is Rural Carrier Relief. 
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
JB: And took the exam and became an RCA which was a position where I could bid on a route. And I 
eventually came up on the roster and bid on a route. 
 
EH: So that's not a highway contractor?

JB: No. Those, they call up, they used to call them Star Routes. Highway contracts. No, a rural carrier 
relief was a position that was hired without time limits, but you had no benefits and you had no bidding 
rights.  
 
LA: I was RCR as well, but 2 months after I was hired in September of '86 there, you were then hired as 
an RCA or you weren't hired. An RCA was Rural Carrier Associate. RCR was Rural Carrier Relief. 
 
EH: I see. 
 
LA: Yeah. 
 
EH: Did you feel like you had to, or drew upon your Master’s of Education in your job as a rural mail 
carrier? 
 
LA: Oddly enough, I did. I was actually a trainer for rural carriers for 8 years and I would go for a week 
at a time and for a while there were 2 trainers but sometimes there was only 1 and that was me. So I 
would go sometimes like once every 2 weeks and do that. I really enjoyed that a lot. I really did. But the 
other thing (laughs) the other thing that I really liked and I didn't really draw upon it as for being a rural 
carrier, but I could listen to books all day and I liked that a lot and then I listened to NPR the rest of the 
time, so. 
 
EH: Yeah, that sounds nice. 
 
LA: Yeah, it was great. (laughs) 
 
04:38  
 
EH: Why don't you tell me both about how you learned the job? We'll start with you. 
 
JB: Well, they had a period where they trained you. It was on the job training. They started what she was 
talking about being a trainer later, after I was hired. But you went in and spent so many days with the 
rural carrier and they would give you so much time and if you needed more, they would give you more 
training. Go in and work up the mail and take it out and carry it but you got to ride the route and case 
mail, work mail with the regular carrier. 
 
EH: Was it hard to learn? 
 
JB: It was and I think for me, learning other routes after I became an employee as a leave replacement 
was easier because you learned what you were supposed to do. When you start you have to learn 
everything. 
 
EH: Yeah, once you learn a system, you can apply it. 
 
JB: Yeah. 
 
EH: What about you, how did you learn?  
 
LA: Much the same. They developed a system where the first day you just rode with the carrier. And my 
guy had me make a list and he'd say, this is box such and such and this is who lives here. That was back 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

in the day before there were street addresses. It was Route 1, Box 76. But next door to it would be Route 
1, Box, it might not be 77. It might be 100. And eventually 911 came in and changed all that and then we 
had to learn all those addresses all over again. So learning the addresses would have been a much easier 
way to learn it because there was no rhyme or reason to where Route 1, box 77 was versus Box 287 which 
might be 30 miles away! You know what I mean? 
 
EH: Wow. Yeah, yeah. 
 
LA: It was, there was no rhyme or reason to it. 
 
EH: Why don't you walk me through a typical day on the job from when you first get into the post office 
to when you get home.  
 
JB: Well you report at 6, of course different reports had different report times. When I became a regular, 
when I first started all the routes in my office reported at 6 in the morning. And mail comes, your flats 
came in bundles. Some of it what they called residual was sorted into tubs. And you sort your flats and 
work your letters, put your letters--when I started it was all residual. Then it went to, through the stages of 
Delivery Point Sequencing. But you just put the mail in order in your letter case and then by the time you 
get your letters and flats worked, the clerks would bring you, in our office, not in all offices, but in our 
office, they would bring you your parcels. And whatever parcels you could put in with the letter case with 
the other cased mail, you did, so you didn't have to hunt for it. Everybody had different ways that they 
marked it. We had package markers that we made. They had some that they bought for us, just this little 
plastic colored strips. So when you got to a box and you found that marker, you knew you had a package. 
And you would sequence your packages and you would have to load your packages in the cart and then 
take the mail down and put it in the cart. Take it to the car and load it and you had to know how to load 
everything depending on how you cased it because everybody cased mail differently. You know your first 
box might be in the upper left. Some people would carousel their mail where your first box would be on 
the left but your cases were different sizes, not all, so you had to learn all of that. But once you got your 
mail down, you put it in order and took it out and delivered it.  
 
09:43  
 
EH: Do you have anything to add to that? 
 
LA: There are a variety of ways that rural carriers case the mail. There's a variety of ways that carrier pull 
the mail into delivery order. Some start at the end, which is what I did. Some start at the beginning and 
then put it into their hand and then tie a bundle and then tie another bundle. Some go from left to middle 
to right around the top and then down. And the second row and the third row. I did that for a few years 
and one day it occurred to me, this is stupid! When I get my own route, I'm gonna have labels where it 
starts up here and goes down and this is the beginning of the route and this is the middle of the route and 
this is the end of the route. You know, left, middle, right. And once I did that, it made, the carriers in my 
office, I was the first person that did it, and they were all like, "What are you doing? That's never gonna 
work!" And I said, "It'll work. Whatever you do is gonna work, just get used to it. Eventually every route 
but two, and there were 14 routes, every route was doing what I was doing. So it. 
 
EH: It worked. 
 
LA: It must have worked. Must have worked. (laughs)

JB: When I would take the mail down, I would, made a cardboard box usually, big enough to hold most 
letters and flats. And it put it in that box and strapped it out and you would have bundles and you would 
mark your bundle in whatever order you took it out. And then you would just grab the bundle and put it--I 
put it in the seat between me and the door and delivered the mail that way. Later in my career, I started 
putting it in trays, in delivery order, but that was mostly because of the vehicle that I was driving. 
 
11:53  
 
LA: That makes all the difference too. 
 
EH: Yeah, so let's talk about vehicles. What vehicles have you had over your career and what was the best 
one? 
 
LA: Well, I was lucky. When I first started my regular carrier, I didn't have a car. And you had to provide 
your own vehicle. And until I could get one, he let me borrow his car, which was an old right-hand drive 
Jeep Dispatcher which is, you know the big square things, not what they drive now. Not the LLVs. The 
Long-Life Vehicles. They weren't introduced until the later 80s. These were the old-fashioned kind from 
World War II but they were painted white. And I got one of those about 6 months after I started. But I 
was basically only working once a week so the only problem with that was you know, I had to get it back 
to him. If there was something wrong, both of us were out of a car. So you really needed a car. Then I got 
my own right-hand drive Jeep Cherokee and I, I think, how many did I have? I had 3. 
 
JB: You had a Dispatcher too. 
 
LA: Oh that's right, I did have a Jeep Dispatcher of my own. 
 
JB: Because the kids called it the anti-Christ. 
 
EH: What did they call it? 
 
13:25  
 
JB: The anti-Christ! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
LA: The first day I had it, I had bought it from a guy in my office, the first day I had it, it had snowed. It 
was April the 4th and it was snowing! And he told me, he said, "Now when it, it needs to warm up, just 
let it run while you're loading and then it'll run a lot better." So I had it running and I got out to walk 
behind it and I didn't get behind it. I was alongside of it, thank goodness, because it jumped into reverse 
and took off across the parking lot. It was a Saturday. My postmaster's car w as in the middle of the 
parking lot. I could see it was gonna hit the back corner of his vehicle and I thought, "Oh that'll give me a 
chance to jump in." Because it was a sliding door. And I jumped in and I caught my leg between the door 
and his bumper. It spun me around, through me on the ground, and it went on.  
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
LA: And (laughs) so the long story short is, I parked it. I went to the hospital. I didn't work for 3 weeks 
and when I came back, it had not been touched. I didn't want the insurance company to say I had done 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

anything wrong, you know. And it was fixed. I will, I will believe to my dying day that the carrier that 
sold it to me fixed it. (laughs) 
 
EH: He felt guilty? 
 
LA: I think maybe he was afraid of liability or something because I'd only had it overnight. Luckily the 
day that I bought it, I went down and insured it. So... 
 
EH: That's [unintelligible] 
 
LA: It was. So that was at the time that a movie was out called The Gods Must Be Crazy. And it had to do 
with a tribe in Africa and they called this Jeep the anti-Christ, so (laughs) we started calling it the anti-
Christ because it was possessed because it took off. 
 
EH: Right, right. What about you? What cars did you have? 
 
15:58  
 
JB: Oh, I had passenger vehicles that I sat on the passenger side of a bench seat, to start with, when I was 
a leave replacement. And when I became a regular is when they deployed the LLVs and I think I was the 
last person in Kentucky at a district to get an LLV which is what they're driving still. And then I bid off of 
that route and went back to passenger vehicles. Drove left-hand drive until I bought right-hand Jeeps, 
which is what I finished out my career in. But when I started, I was a casual city carrier as well as an RCR 
and RCA. So on the city delivery routes I drove the quarter ton Dispatchers which is what they had at the 
time and when I carried city delivery as a casual. Later on they had the LLVs and I drove those.  
 
EH: Nice. Why don't you describe the area on your routes, you know, generally. For someone who has 
never been to this area, what does it look like? What's the terrain? 
 
LA: The terrain where I delivered the last 6 or 7 years that I worked, it was just stunningly beautiful! And 
that's the main thing that I miss about being on the route is driving out Red Lick Road. All four seasons of 
the road, it's just beautiful! It's where the mountains of Eastern Kentucky start. The mountains will be on 
your right as you go out. And I would go all the way to Estill County and then turn around and come 
back. But there were also areas of the route, at the beginning of the route in the Dreyfuss area or out 
around Kingston, it was subdivisions, you know? But then you'd go out a little country road. It was, I 
loved the scenery. I just, it was beautiful. There was flat land, there was rolling land, there were gravel 
roads, there were paved roads, there were roads with curves, roads with no curves. The scariest road was 
the road that I delivered on a different route from Kingston to Big Hill and/or vice versa, and the coal 
trucks would come down from Jackson County and nearly run you off the road. And I hadn't been able to 
pull into a driveway, I would have gotten hit more than once. So that was scary. 
 
19:19  
 
EH: What about you? 
 
JB: When I started it was mostly subdivisions, but there were some of the bigger horse farms around 
Versailles and they were, the horse farms were really nice to look at. Throughout my career I moved to 
different routes that had a mix of subdivisions and then when I retired the route had developments but 
they were 10, 15, 20, 30 acre farms you know, from bigger farms that had been subdivided. But there 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

were still big horse farms on some of 'em and big cattle farms and all kinds of different livestock being 
raised out on the farms. The last route I had was on the Palisades at the Kentucky River. So you know 
you're driving along and there's a cliff a few feet from the edge of the road. There were a lot of creeks and 
streams out there in Versailles. So most of it was just hilly, rural Kentucky and being close to the creeks 
and the big farms, I enjoyed that but that's pretty much what it was!  
 
EH: Did you ever have any wildlife or you know domesticated animal encounters too? 
 
LA: (laughs) Yeah. I mean you would see deer. There were a variety of critters that would be in the boxes 
or on the boxes. Bees, spiders, singing insects (laughs). The worst thing that ever happened was when I 
killed a dog. And the dog wasn't supposed to be out. It was blind and it was nearly deaf and it was old and 
I was in a cul-de-sac in between boxes. It wasn't very far, it was from here, you know, 20 feet. And I was 
at this box and I picked up the mail and I you know, was looking, not driving, looking, because you don't 
do that, because that's dangerous. But by the time I picked it up, the dog had walked under a car and I 
didn't know it. And I was just rolling slowly and ran over the dog and that was traumatic. I mean, the 
customer cried and I cried and it was awful.  
 
EH: Yeah.  
 
LA: Yeah. 
 
EH: What about you? 
 
JB: A lot of the encounters I had, the animals were domesticated animals. And I grew up in that 
community, my family had been in Versailles for a long time, so a lot of the folks I knew. There was one 
lady that was my grandmother's classmate, her son was my mother's classmate, and I went to school with 
his son. So if you're driving along and somebody's cattle are out, you put the car in park and lock it up and 
go help them chase cattle. I did that on a lot of occasions. I had some encounters with dogs, you know, 
when you get out, you startle 'em, don't know they're there. I've had that type of thing happen. But and I'd 
see a lot of wildlife, but I can't ever really...I hit a deer on the way to work one morning. 
 
LA: (laughs) 
 
EH: Yikes. 
 
JB: But that was like at 5:45, something like that. I turned around and went back and it had gotten up and 
run away. 
 
EH: Oh wow. And you were okay? 
 
JB: Sure!  
 
LA: I laugh because he had to fill out a safety report when he got to work and it became legend. 
 
JB: Oh. 
 
LA (laughs) Amongst the people that saw it. 
 
EH: How so? How did it become legend?

JB: It (sighs)...the postmaster at the time was determined that you weren't going to be early or late. You 
were going to be on time. So I hit this deer and I saw it laying in the road. Turned around and went back. 
And I wanted to make sure that the animal wasn't in the road because it was a curve, I didn't want, want 
anybody else to hit it. It was gone so I went back so you had a trip sheet, it's called a 4240. And any 
remarks that you had, like you know if you had a detour, anything like that, you put it in the remarks 
section. So I was late that day and I wrote in the remarks section that I hit a deer. Well the postmaster said 
since you hit an animal like that, you had an accident, you have to report it! So when I filled out the 
accident report, I made comments like the deer entered the roadway, you know, traveled along with me, 
attempted an abrupt lane change striking the right front fender of my car. So you have to draw out what 
direction you were in the lane of traffic so I drew a deer hitting, and it had its head on my hood, and so 
when it was laying on the supervisor's desk out where everybody could see it, people looked at it and read 
it and thought it was funny. I don't think the postmaster at the time thought it was funny. 
 
LA: He said the deer obviously unaware of the rules of the road, attempted an abrupt lane change. 
(laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Right.  
 
JB: Apparently, they kept it because they told me, you know, to get rid of the evidence that I'd had an 
accident, but apparently somebody kept it so occasionally I would hear somebody say, well a new 
manager or something would say, "Well I saw that report that you wrote about the deer." But that's really 
the only time I actually struck an animal, wildlife like that. I mean I had close calls, they'd run in front of 
you, but... 
 
LA: That's the only reason I laugh because obviously hitting a deer is not funny.  
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
LA: But I always got a kick out of that, what he did. 
 
EH: Yeah. Tell me about your customers and how you developed a relationship with them over the years? 
 
LA: When I started, the accent was service. The United States Postal SERVICE. And the rural carrier 
motto at the time, and it probably still is, although I don't ever see it anywhere, was "service with a 
smile." And I BELIEVED in that. And I WANTED to provide service and I would go out of my way to 
make sure that I took their parcel to the door and put it under where it wouldn't get rained on, or I put it in 
a plastic bag or, I tried to provide good service. If somebody put a letter in the mailbox and they didn't 
leave me any money for it, I would put a stamp on it and then leave them a little envelope that we had that 
said, you know, I paid for your--and they would leave me the money in it. They liked that, you know. 
There were elderly people. Sometimes, you know, they're lonely and this lady would sit in her chair and 
look out the window all day. Sometimes I'd just stop and talk to her. You know, that's on your own time. 
You're not really supposed to be doing that. And I don't think the carriers now can do that because their 
scanners will tell on them and back then we didn't have scanners and you know, if you were out 20 
minutes longer, nobody was gonna say anything, you know what I mean? 
 
JB: You were being paid evaluated pay. You were gonna get paid the same that day no matter what. 
 
EH: Yeah. 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

LA: Yeah. With the evaluations, you know. But toward the end of my postal career, we you know, we got 
scanners, I don't know, what, around '90, '92? Something, early in the 90s. 
 
JB: But they weren't as advanced as what they are now. 
 
LA: Yeah. I think this is the 3rd generation of scanners now that they have. And they are gonna change 
the postal--they're gonna change rural delivery top to bottom. I'm glad that I had that opportunity to go in, 
and you know, I had this one lady who she told me these incredible stories about her life and I loved that! 
Another lady had--I had a sore throat and she said, "Oh honey!" And she fixed me you know, the old 
fashioned cough remedy which was rock candy and lemon juice and whiskey. And I said, "Well now, 
Miss Ross, I can't drink this whiskey while I'm delivering mail!" And she said, "Well you take this rock 
candy and you take yourself some lemon juice and you get yourself a shot when you get home." And I 
said, "Yes ma'am I will." (laughs) I'll do that. I mean it was wonderful. Sometimes I'd stop and, I mean I 
saw Bob and Colleen [Bob and Colleen Montgomery, my partner's parents whose house was on Lorna's 
route] regularly when I would take parcels out. And you know how far it is out to the end of their 
driveway. And I dunno. I missed those kinds of interactions. I liked that a lot.  
 
30:23  
The other thing that was cool--you got to see kids grow up! I mean, you'd see them from the time they 
were born until they were graduating from high school. So that was very cool. 
 
EH: Yeah, we'll come back to how things changed over the years. But yeah, what about you and 
customers? Sounds like you knew a lot of them already. 
 
JB: I did. 
 
LA: He did. 
 
JB: And there were even people out on the route that I was distantly related to or for example, one of my 
aunts by marriage, her family lived on the route. So I had distant relatives that lived on the route. I also, 
where I went to elementary school, we started 1st and went through 8th grade, so there were kids that 
lived on the route that I went all the way through high school with. But some of those folks that lived on 
the route that were older than me, got out of school before me, they were living out in the community. So 
I knew a lot of folks from the area because I went to school with 'em, I went to high school with 'em. My 
mother went to school with 'em, my aunts and uncles. And I lived in that community, so I knew a lot of 
folks that way. But you know, what she was talking about seeing the kids--there was one young lady that 
I watched grow up. I used to have to wait on her to get off the school bus (sighs) and I knew her, talked to 
her. Just seeing her taking things to the house. And I asked her why she was out running--she was getting 
ready to go to the Army. (sighs) And she was trying to get in shape. And then when she came home, she'd 
had a head injury and she would walk out to the mailbox and talk to me and that was part of her rehab. 
And then I got to watch her son. Her son would come out to the mailbox and get mail. I miss that sort of 
relationship with customers. And then you get to know people, you know who they are from delivering 
their mail, or know who they are from living in the community with them. And I can remember one 
customer who used to get medicine from the VA and I would make the effort to make sure that he got it in 
the snow. I mean you weren't supposed to do something that was unsafe, but I would try to make sure he 
got what he needed in the snow. And then sometimes I would even take stuff like that on the way home 
when I lived in Versailles, somebody was asking for something, have I seen it, if I could find it, I would 
take it to them on my way home. You can't do that now, but I did it then. But it was mostly just growing

Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

up in the community and not even, sometimes not even knowing them but knowing their family when 
they moved in. So that was how I got to know most of the folks. 
 
EH: Yeah. Did customers leave you gifts? 
 
JB: Lots of cookies, homemade things. Lots of things like that. There were customers that didn't as such 
leave me gifts but I felt lucky to have them on the route because if the car overheated it's like, well I'll go 
get you some antifreeze, or you know, come up to the house. There were lots of homemade things like 
that, but there were people around that would be willing to help you, but I considered that a gift. 
 
EH: What about you, did customers leave you things? 
 
LA: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, fudge and cookies and things like that at Christmas and you know the Postal 
Service was, you're not supposed to accept any money and I think it was over $20. 
 
JB: You're not supposed to accept money and anything that you accept is supposed to be considered 
nominal value and the nominal value is $20 so they're not supposed to give you a box of cookies that cost 
$35. Like you're gonna know that! 
 
EH: (laughs) Right. 
 
JB: But that's where the $20 comes in. It's the nominal value they placed on something like that. Carriers 
do appreciate that. You know, you appreciate being appreciated. 
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. 
 
LA: Or remembered. Some people, you know, as time went on, I noticed there were fewer and fewer of 
those. I don't know. And I don't think it was me, you know! I just don't think people think to do that now. 
 
JB: Yeah. I had customers, when the weather was bad, you know, "Come in, warm up."  
 
LA: Oh yeah, absolutely. 
 
JB: When it was hot, miserable hot, I'd have, especially like on dead-end roads, they'd be on the other side 
of the road with a bottle of water or that sort of thing.  
 
36:22  
 
EH: So they also sort of knew when you came by? 
 
JB: A lot of times. But at the beginning of the career, you were supposed to try to maintain a schedule. 
But then as my career went on, the mail volumes fluctuated so much, it was hard to maintain a schedule. 
So, but yeah, they kinda head an idea what time you would come. But there were days, you know, in the 
summertime, I'd be done sometimes by you know, 2 o'clock in the afternoon. At Christmas I wouldn't be 
done 'til 6 so you really couldn't follow it.  
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. Turn my phone off here. Yeah, let's talk about how things changed over your career--
how the work changed, scanners and otherwise.

LA: Yeah, when we were hired, we were both hired, we didn't even know each other in 1986. He was in 
Versailles, I was in Berea. We met at a rural carrier convention. (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
LA: And then I became a district president and he became the vice president and that's how we got to 
know each other. 
 
EH: Nice. 
 
LA: But when I first started, and when he first started, all of the mail was what we call raw mail. In other 
words, now it's called residual because it's not in delivery order. It, that's called Delivery Point Sequence 
and it's done by barcode. But barcodes didn't come in until you know, the late 80s, early 90s. And that's 
when the scanners started showing up. So it was hard because you'd, of course, you'd, you had to learn it 
by name, really, because you didn't have a street or a number or anything, so it was hard at first. Once you 
learned it, you didn't have as much mail back then. And you also didn't have nearly the number of parcels 
that carriers do now. Parcels did nothing but increase the whole time I worked for the Postal Service. And 
even the last couple of years after I was retired, it continued to increase. But you know, there used to be a 
rhythm to it. The summertime there wouldn't be very many parcels. In September it would start to pick 
up, and as you moved toward Christmas it would be higher and higher. In January you had a seed catalogs 
and you'd have tax forms and all that. All that went away with the internet, you know. But toward the end 
of my career, it's, it was, we started noticing, okay, in the summertime, well we're already getting stuff 
like we had at Christmas! And then it eventually it got to be like it was Christmas all year long in the 
Postal Service. I did not like that worth a darn! I'm telling ya, I did, it was no fun anymore. I was ready to 
be done with it. And I would have continued to work, but I got rear-ended on the mail route and that 
ended my career, which is why I retired before he did. We were gonna try to retire at the same time, but I 
didn't make it. 
 
EH: Yeah, what changes would you like to talk about? 
 
JB: When I started it was Route Box Number and you'd go in and sort your mail. You had to know where 
it went and if territory changed from one route to another due to growth, you would have sections of your 
route that had Route Box Number from a different route, so you might be carrying Rural Route 4, but 
you'd be carrying a section of mail that said Rural Route 2 Box whatever. When I started, they let you put, 
when you printed your labels on your casing equipment, they had names. You could have the names on 
your casing equipment. They agreed that if you were on the route that you were carrying as a regular. 
When they stopped printing names on the labels, you could keep them, but if you switched or somebody 
else took the route, they would drop the names off the labels. But you had edit books where you would 
keep up your route. 
 
LA: (groans) 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
41:34  
 
JB: You started seeing more and more barcodes on the mail. You would go in, when the 911 came in, you 
started seeing more and more mail put in delivery order. And that went through a system. You would get-
-it depends on who you're talking to. We called it raw mail. It was mail that was just sorted to your route.

Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

But then you would see, like at the plant, they call raw mail what they pick up at the collection boxes. So 
it's called residual mail that's not in any order for whatever reason. But you would, you went through 
stages of it through the Delivery Point Sequencing, your mail would come in, what did they call it? Sector 
Segment. 
 
LA: Sector Segment. 
 
JB: So your mail would come in in your trays and it would be for this section of your route, or this 
section, but it wouldn't be in particular order. And then it came in Delivery Point Sequencing. And you 
would see, you would get, and the thing is is, when you had residual mail on a rural route, you had an 
evaluated system. A letter was a certain time value. A parcel was a certain time value. If it was a big, if it 
was a letter that was too big, it would be a different time value than just a letter size envelope. So as the 
mail became coming in sequencing, the time standards changed. 
 
LA: Yeah. 
 
JB: So what she was saying is you're delivering more mail because your standards were different, so you 
know, the mail accounted for a certain part of your day. But when you didn't have to sort it, you had more 
mail.  
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. 
 
JB: Because the time standard, the time value for that mail piece was less so you started getting, I would, 
when I started, I would get a tray and a half of letters. When I ended up because it was DPS, and it was 
different routes got different mail volumes, but I would have you know, 7 or 8 trays of mail that would 
make up my, letter mail that would make up my day. They started, they were trying to get the magazines 
and flats in delivery order. They could never work it out mechanically, at least in my career.  
 
LA: (laughs) 
 
JB: But we started seeing more and more what they call presort mail. So it's, it would be in delivery order 
because they got a discount for putting it in delivery order, but it would be bundles of mail that you had to 
cut open and case. When I started you had to case everything. You had to put everything in delivery 
order. Your mail came in, when I ended, it was in trays. And you'd take it out, put it in your car and 
deliver it. The, as the volume changed, as the time standards for rural carriers changed, you were 
delivering more and more pieces for less time value per piece, so you ended up carrying, and actually 
delivering a lot more mail. And then as the time value for letters and flats shrunk, it gave you more time 
to deliver more, other types of mail such as packages. So if your time value for your tray of mail was, I 
don't know, just random, you know, pick a random thing, if that time value shrunk, you had time to 
deliver more packages. 
 
EH: Yeah, mmhm. 
 
JB: So that was a big change. And then everything was like I say, mail that you had to case got more mail 
that you would put in the car and deliver. Your scanner was the big change. You would take it out, you 
would take your mail, accountable mail, you could keep a paper receipt. They're doing away with the 
paper receipts. You would go in and sign out for your accountable items. You still sign for your 
accountable items when I left, but you could go online and look because you actually had the scanner. 
The scanners were, they recorded the data that you had and you went in and put it in a cradle, and it was 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

uploaded to a main computer. Now, when I left the scanners reported in real time. They could even tell 
how fast you were driving. 
 
46:59  
 
LA: Or if you backed up. 
 
JB: Yeah. 
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
JB: Like I say, before, you would have paper delivery receipts. Now you're going in, when I ended up, 
you would actually sign the scanner with a stylus. And that was online! So technology changed the job a 
lot because they were able through technology to automate more mail and then you were reporting in real 
time with your scanner, what you were doing. 
 
EH: So what about those places where there's no internet? Like out Red Lick [on Lorna's former route] 
there isn't really service. Does that effect the scanner? 
 
LA: I don't, I'm, I don't know very much about the newest scanners.  
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
LA: The last time I delivered, I retired in 2018, but I had been on Workers' Comp about 18 months 
because I got hit out on Red Lick in 2016. So it's been a while since I delivered. But yeah, there is no 
internet out there. There's no phone service. You'd, you know, if there was a problem, you had to go to 
somebody's house to call the post office. So I don't know how they're gonna you know, cause there's areas 
of the country that don't have internet coverage. I mean all across the nation! I don't know how that's 
gonna work. 
 
JB: What they were doing when I was leaving, when I was retiring is the equipment would upload as soon 
as it got a signal. 
 
LA: Yeah, yeah. 
 
JB: So the data would stay in it if there was no way to upload. 
 
EH: Right. 
 
JB: And as soon as you got to wherever it was, it would upload. And the scanners were, they changed. 
Technology changed them. At first it was a scanner that it kept the data and you downloaded it. And then 
they gave us these little cell phones and you had to pair the cell phone to the scanner. And it uploaded the 
data. And now the scanners have basically have cellular equipment ability built into them. 
 
EH: I see. How long were your routes? 
 
49:40  
 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

LA: Huh. Different lengths depending on the route. The way the evaluated system works, you get so 
much per piece of mail, and different kinds of...I have delivered routes that were 19 miles long but they 
had 850 boxes. And then the last route that I delivered was 75 miles long and it only had like 575 boxes. 
But I know people that deliver routes over 100 miles and only have 350 boxes. I would much rather have 
a route with the miles and not as many boxes because you're not gonna have as much mail, you're gonna 
get out of the office sooner. 
 
JB: But that's gonna change because they had a qualification on rural delivery, called a high density route 
called an L route.  
 
LA: Yeah. 
 
JB: And with the new scanners, there's not gonna be anymore L routes. The time value is gonna be what 
the time value is, so. 
 
LA: Wow. 
 
JB: Which is something that the rural carrier craft had been wanting to do away with for a long time was 
the L route standard. And it's gonna be done away with when they get the scanners fully implemented. 
The shortest route I delivered as a rural carrier was probably about 15 miles. And the route that I retired 
on was over 70, I think.  
 
EH: What were things that as a trainer you made sure to tell people? 
 
LA: Oh my goodness. Oh, I'll have to think about that. Oh! In the summertime, carry plenty of water! 
(laughs) Freeze it the night before and take it out of you know, things like that! Things that you just don't 
think of. 
 
JB: When you train somebody on the route, you tell 'em who will let you go to the bathroom if you need 
to (laughs) 
 
LA: Oh yeah. 
 
JB: Where's a good place to stop. Where your lunch breaks are. I mean where there's a place available to 
buy something.  
 
LA: Watch out for this person, watch out for that person, you know. This person will help you out and 
you don't want to mess with this person. 
 
EH: Yeah, (laughs) right. 
 
LA: Those kinds of things. And every route has those. You know, being a rural carrier will restore your 
faith in your fellow man and make you wonder how anybody gets along in the world! (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, right (laughs) 
 
LA: Both! 
 
EH: Yes!

52:52  
 
JB: But she probably wanted to know more about your academy training. 
 
LA: I'm trying to think, you know, other things that I would tell people! I would tell them when you 
begin, you’re going to think I'm gonna never learn this. And don't quit! 
 
JB: Don't get discouraged. 
 
LA: Don't get discouraged, keep up with it and you will learn it. One day you'll go, Oh! Oh! Okay! 
I'm...oh wow! I did that! You know, I made it through the day! When you first start sometimes the 
different places will have you do different things. In other words, some offices will throw you out of the, 
you know, deliver this, after 3 days of training, and they sent you out all by yourself. Some places you 
know, they'll have you carry half the route, or a little bit more. Or have, or they'll send someone out to 
help you. Different, and you never, I never knew with all the offices I was training for, I never knew, you 
know, which offices were gonna do it the right way. They would have--I always would tell people, you 
know, if your postmaster and supervisor will follow the training requirements, everything's gonna be just 
fine! But it just doesn't always work out that way. 
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
JB: Well I think that's what, that's another thing that's changed-- you would go from one office to another, 
talk to carriers in other offices, and they'd do it completely different than what you did.  
 
LA: It was like a different post office. 
 
JB: Yeah, you wouldn't think it was the same Postal Service. 
 
LA: Yeah! 
 
JB: And you would see different carriers, when I started, work mail differently than the newer employees 
did. With the scanners, everything's gonna be more standardized. You're not gonna have different ways of 
doing things because automation is forcing people to do it the same way because the mail's being 
presented in the same way. 
 
EH: Yeah. What do you think the importance of your work or the work of a rural mail carrier is to the 
communities you serve? 
 
55:48  
 
LA: (Sighs) I think connection is important. And especially when I first started, I felt like, you know, 
there's something about a handwritten letter or a card! I truly believe in the future, those are gonna be 
things that are gonna be treasured. Because they're becoming fewer and fewer. Now with the internet, you 
know, and email, there's so little of that. But I always, I felt there was a reward in knowing that I was 
helping people stay connected to the world. You know, especially, in a subdivision close to town not so 
much because those people are gonna be connected. But 70 miles away from the office, you know, on a 
country road where they might not see anybody for 3 days at a time!

Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22 
17 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
LA: You know, you'd check on those people. If their mail piled up in their mailbox, you'd go knock on 
the door and check and see if they were okay. One day I was driving by a house and I noticed that the 
woods behind their house was on fire! And it was coming closer to their house and I called the Fire 
Department. And then I knew that he was the principal of the school so I called the school and talked to 
him. But you know, it was literally in their backyard and I had a garden house.  
 
EH: (laughs) Wow. 
 
LA: Spraying their yard before the Fire Department got there. So I mean stuff like that, I don't know. 
 
EH: Yeah! Yeah. 
 
JB: On September 11th we stood in the office and they brought out the television that we used to watch 
safety videos and that sort of thing on and we watched the news and we heard it on the radio. And the first 
plane hit and we were watching and when the second plane hit one of my coworkers who was a former 
Marine looked at me and said, "We're under attack." And I'll never forget customers coming out to the 
mailbox and going, "Well, you know, you're here. Things are still normal." I also, we talked about the 
customer I had who came back from overseas with a war injury. I had a customer who developed bone 
cancer and he would measure how well he was doing by whether he could walk out to the mailbox and 
get the mail. Making sure customers got mail, if it was something that was clearly important. Like she 
said, going and knocking on their door if their mail piled up, "Are you okay, do you need anything?" 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
LA: Or if they forgot to put in a hold order if they went on vacation and okay, there's 3 days’ worth of 
mail in here, and you know they go on vacation regularly. You know, you take that back to the post office 
and hold it until they, and you were supposed to hold it for 10 days and then return it to the sender. 
"Moved, left no forward." Nah, I'm gonna keep it for a while if I know. Do you know what I mean? 
 
EH: Yeah! Yeah. 
 
LA: And as you know your customers, you know what to do with that mail. 
 
EH: Right. 
 
LA: You know whether to hold it or whether to return it. 
 
1:00:14  
 
JB: I had a customer that I knew was having a treatment and couldn't get out--lived by herself. I didn't 
ask. I told the supervisor, "I'm stopping and picking up her prescription on the way out of town and I'm 
gonna take it to her." 
 
EH: Mmhm.

Interview with Lorna Atwater and John Buckler – 2/24/22

JB: So that was some of the importance of the work that we did is because we knew our customers, we 
had the personal touch with them and looked out for 'em. And they kinda looked out for us--some of 'em 
did.  
 
EH: Yeah, well is there anything else you would like to share that we haven't talked about? 
 
LA: We rescued turtles! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
LA: Both of us. 
 
EH: Nice! 
 
LA: Once a year the postmaster would ride with you to make sure that you weren't (laughs) padding your 
route with you know, extra boxes. And you know, to see how you did. 
 
JB: If you had a problem on the route when they did the inspection, you could say, "Okay, well I really 
need to change this because this tree's grown up, we need to make an adjustment." They did, it was a 
safety inspection too--that sort of thing.  
 
LA: But my postmaster got a kick out of me stopping and getting the turtles out of the road. And I'd just 
say, look, I know I'm not supposed to stop in the middle of the road, but I know this road, there's not very 
much traffic, I'm stopping. And I got out and I moved the turtle. And you always move the turtle in the 
direction they're going because otherwise they're just gonna (laughs) 
 
EH: Right, right.  
 
LA: Yeah, yeah. 
 
EH: What else--anything else we haven't talked about? 
 
1:02:09  
 
LA: I tried to keep track of (sighs) I tried to do anything that I could, I never was a very fast carrier. I 
always thought it was much more important to be accurate than fast. (clears throat) I developed this 
(slides spreadsheet across table). Nobody else that I knew did this but this is (laughs) this was like, this is 
2 weeks, okay? So that's one week and that's another week. And I printed it. But this is like the amount of 
mail I had for the day, like this many trays of DPS and this many flats and how many parcels and whether 
I had advertisers, and where I was at a certain time, I'd just jot it down.  
 
EH: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
 
LA: You know? And it would kind of keep me on track, but you can see from looking at it, you know, I 
finished at different times of the day and I would get out of the office at you know, sometimes I'd be out 
at 9:35 and sometimes it was 10 and sometimes it was, you know, I think the latest I ever got out [of the 
post office] was like 1:30 in the afternoon and how are you gonna be back before dark? 
 
EH: Yeah! Wow.

EH: That's cool. I'll take a picture of that. 
 
LA: I did that. 
 
EH: Yeah, if you don't mind. 
 
LA: Sure, sure. 
 
EH: Well, thank you both so much, this was really great! 
 
JB: The thing, I miss my coworkers. There was a girl that I went to high school with and she's still 
working. I don't know why, but she is. But you know, and she made. 
 
LA: She started when she was 17! 
 
JB: Yeah.  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
JB: When she, she started her training, they started the paperwork when she was 17. And when she turned 
18, they started training her. But I'd known her since 1978! I do, I miss the coworkers. And she actually 
said it. "I spend as much time with you, people that I work with, as I do my family! As I do my husband 
and my kids." Because you're there so many hours of the morning casing mail. And I still keep up with 
my friends that I had at the post office.  
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
JB: So I do miss my coworkers. 
 
EH: Yeah, how many rural routes were there out of Versailles? 
 
JB: When I left there were 13, I think? When I started there were 7. 
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
LA: Yeah. When I started there were 5 routes and then they created what they called an auxiliary route 
which was, they took parts of this route and parts of that route and created another route, but it wasn't a 
full-time route, it was a substitute carrier would carry. But... 
 
JB: They abolished one route in Versailles, so it got consolidated into other routes because of automation. 
But the Versailles is still growing so the routes were still growing. 
 
EH: Yeah.

LA: They, Paint Lick used to have rural delivery and then they moved those 2 routes to Berea so when I 
left there were 12 Berea routes and then the 2 Paint Lick routes housed in the Berea office. 
 
EH: I see. Yeah, I stopped by the Paint Lick office just to check it out. 
 
LA: Yeah, yeah. 
 
EH: Well, anything else? 
 
LA: I'm trying to think if there's anything else. I mean there's so many things, you know, I'm gonna go 
home and I'm gonna remember a lot of stories, you know? There were a lot of fun things about the job! 
You know, and I always said, the best thing is I get paid to listen to books. 
 
EH: Right! Yeah, what kind of books would you listen to? 
 
LA: I did everything from Harry Potter books and Game of Thrones (laughs) to you know, political 
thrillers to current event type things. I mean I did the gamut of books. I would come here and when I first 
started it was books on tape. Then it went to books on CD (laughs). 
 
EH: Now it's on your phone. 
 
LA: Now it's on your phone.  
 
EH: (laughs) Yeah. What about you--would you listen to the radio or books on tape? 
 
JB: I listened to radio and I listened to books on tape and towards the end of my career I started listening 
to podcasts over the phone. I had a Bluetooth speaker that I could hook into. It was usually buffer to 
where I could get to the areas through the areas where there was no cell phone signal, down at the river, 
down at the Palisades and that sort of place.  
 
I guess the thing, anything else I could think of, I remember when I started one of the clerks was telling 
me that everything he had was because of the post office. And of course it was a lot different then than 
when he started but looking back on my career, as hard as it was sometimes, you know I had a 
background in automobile repair, which helped because I was able to keep my car running. But Don 
stopped and asked me if I wanted to come to work for him, and you know, 34 years later I was able to 
retire. I had no college. Just, I've often said that I was just a big old dumb farm boy and I ended up with a 
34-year career with a retirement and health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance. I mean those were 
options that I bought, but they were available to me which I wouldn't have had before. So for as much, for 
as many problems as I had over my career for whatever reason or another, I'm, it was a blessing to have 
the job and it's a good career and it's changed a lot and I feel sorry for younger people but it's still a great 
opportunity for them. 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
LA: And every day we say, "Oh it's a good day to be retired!" (laughs) Seriously. Almost every day. "Oh 
you know, the best thing is, we don't have to go to the post office this morning." You know, it's an icy 
morning or... 
 
JB: I don't have to worry about sliding off the road or getting stuck, or...

LA: Well and he drove, after we got married in 2002, he drove 57 miles one way to the post office, and 
70-something miles on his route, and then 57 miles home. I mean, weather was a big deal for him. You 
know, I was a mile and a half from the post office but then I was 75 miles out to Estill County, you know, 
so, I mean not that it's 75 miles out there, but the whole route, in and out of all the roads and all that. But I 
think weather and keeping a car going... 
 
EH: Those are the biggest challenges? 
 
1:10:22  
 
LA: You know, the people who have the LLVs supplied to them, you know, they don't have CD players 
or the ability to you know, they don't have radios! I would have gone CRAZY without a radio! I couldn't 
have done the job. In fact, the times that I had to borrow a car or use something, if it didn't have, I would 
take a portable so that I would have something to listen to. 
 
JB: That was the thing on a rural route, if it didn't have a vehicle supplied, it was your job to provide that 
vehicle and beg, borrow, or steal, they didn't care. You were supposed to show up with a vehicle. 
 
LA: You either had a vehicle or you had to take the day off and it was on you to take annual leave. So 
there were advantages to having your own vehicle, but there were a lot of disadvantages and the money 
that they gave us to, our EMA--Equipment Maintenance Allowance--it was never, ever enough. It was 
about good enough to pay for gasoline. But... 
 
JB: I maintained my own vehicles as much as I could so I saved money that way because I knew how to 
do it. But there towards the end of my career, where I had the right-hand drive Jeep that was 4-wheel 
drive, I needed to have it in the weather but especially towards the end of my career, I was losing money 
on fuel because fuel got so high. The way they paid you your EMA was behind so I was, if fuel prices 
went up, I lost money.  
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah, that's a lot of wear and tear on a car. 
 
JB: It is.  
 
LA: Oh, it's incredible. 
 
JB: There was a route that I had that I took the backseat completely out of my left-hand drive car and 
there were days that I would take the spare tire out and leave it at the office. I had so much mail in the car 
that it would break the leaf springs. I would have to go to the mechanic and have him put a new leaf in the 
spring because the weight broke the springs in the car. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
JB: Yeah. 
 
EH: That's crazy. 
 
LA: I had a car accident off the route in 2009 and it took me 15 months to get back to work. The 
postmaster maintained my job for me, thank GOD, and he didn't have to do that but it was nice of him.

But I had a neck problem and I couldn't turn my head very well and I had to have some surgery because if 
you're pulling away from a box, you need to be able to look over your left shoulder or you're gonna get 
creamed. 
 
EH: Right, yeah! 
 
LA: So, there's you know, he had 34 years between being a sub and being a regular carrier. 
 
JB: Not all 34 years were career.  
 
LA: 31? 
 
JB: 31.  
 
LA: I was a sub for 8 years and then I worked 22 so. 
 
JB: I would go in in the morning, when I was a casual, I would go in at 3 in the morning and help them 
open up and dump mail until the route that I was gonna carry reported at 6 and then I'd go carry a route. 
Rural route or a city route. And then there were days that as a casual clerk, I'd just go in at 3 o'clock in the 
morning and sort mail until they were done. So I did that for several years. 
 
EH: Wow, yeah. Well, any parting thoughts? 
 
1:14:46  
 
JB: It was a good opportunity for me. It was a good career and I don't miss the work but I miss my 
customers and I miss my coworkers. But being able to be retired helps me offset my disappointment 
around not seeing my coworkers. (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Right! 
 
LA: It is not how I intended to spend my life. I'm not sorry I did it because the pay was good, the 
customers were mostly great, the scenery was magnificent, and I met him! (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, right! (laughs) 
 
JB: Any job at the post office is tougher than people think.  
 
LA: So much harder than people think. 
 
JB: People say all you're doing is driving around with your window open. No! You know, I got there at 6 
a lot of times and I'd work mail until 10 or 11 and then I'd go deliver it. It's tougher than people think! 
 
LA: It's physically, it's physically demanding. 
 
EH: Right, the repetitive motion. 
 
LA: Yeah, repetitive...

JB: Repetitive motion injuries beat people up. 
 
LA: I had bone spurs and carpal tunnel surgeries. 
 
JB: Well, we could talk about it all day, so maybe we just, time to stop. 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
LA: Yeah. I don't know how to wrap it up. There is no... 
 
JB: It's tougher than people think! 
 
LA: Well, you know, what I was saying is, we've got 64 years at the post office between us and you can't 
encapsulate all that in an hour and a half. 
 
EH: Yeah, definitely. Yep. Well I appreciate what you did share and this was really great. 
 
JB: Hopefully it helped you! 
 
EH: Yeah, definitely. Thanks so much. 
 
LA: Sure.
