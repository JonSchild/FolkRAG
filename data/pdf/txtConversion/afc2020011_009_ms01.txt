Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Mirella Martinez is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on April 30, 2021.

About Mirella Martinez ... 
Photographer and mixed media artist Mirella Martinez was born in Mexico and came to 
Stillwater, Oklahoma, as a 
child, when her parents immigrated to America. Because her mother 
worked on campus, Mirella and her family lived in Oklahoma State University family housing, 
which allowed Mirella to engage with other international children who lived nearby and went to 
the same school, and the exposure to other cultures opened her eyes to her own history and 
ancestry. In high school, she became interested in visual arts and photography, and she bought 
herself a 
digital camera with her own savings. She enrolled at Ringling College of Art and 
Design to study photography and digital imaging, and after earning her degree, she spent the next 
few years traveling up and down the West Coast, and between the Coast and Oklahoma. Along 
her journeys, she produced a 
collection of photographs that can be seen in her series American 
West and 101-2018. 
Eventually moving back to Stillwater, Mirella continued her photography and mixed media 
pieces, and she started creating handmade books, as well. Among her projects are 
PreserveiDecay, Still L 
fe, and Wavering Recognition, along with the book Hey Butterchp and a 
series of portraits. In 2021, the Oklahoma Visual Arts Coalition selected her project Payne for 
Art 365, a 
unique honor, offered to only five Oklahoma artists every three years. In her 
interview, Mirella discussed her photography and artwork and how she searches to capture some 
of the smaller moments in life that often go unnoticed. She also shared feelings of her Mexican 
heritage and how it, as well as emotion, human connection, and life perceptions, influence her 
projects and pieces.

This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is April 30, 2021, 
and this is a 
remote interview with Mirella Martinez for the Library cf 
Congress' OcciApational Folklffe Prcjectfunded by an Archie Green 
Fellowship. I'm in Tulsa, and you're in Stillwater, Mirella, where you are a 
photographer and mixed media artist. I'm looking forward to learning more 
about you and your work. Where were you born, and where did you spend 
your first childhood years? 
I 
was born in Mexico and ... I 
grew up in Oklahoma, in Stillwater 
specifically. That's where I 
was raised. I 
was raised here for the whole part 
and went away for college, and then came back after, and spent some years 
in between now and college, post-college traveling between Oklahoma and 
the West Coast. 
What did your folks do for a 
living as you were growing iAp? 
Growing up, my parents, well, they've had almost the same jobs ever since I 
was young. My mom works in food dining services at OSU. Since 
Stillwater's a 
college town, she works there. She's been working there since 
I 
can remember, and my dad works maintenance at a 
golf course and then 
has his own business outside of that, as well, with lawn care. 
Okay. What was your first experience with art, however you would dc fine it? 
My 
first experience with art, really going back all the way back as early as I 
can remember, my first experience with art was seeing these picture frames 
my family members had made in Mexico. They were carved and painted, 
4 
and I 
had a 
small.... One of my uncles, I 
believe, is the one who made it. It 
was a 
small little picture frame. Of course, it had a 
religious image in the 
middle. On the outside it had my name at the top and some flowers carved 
around the edges, and it was painted. I 
held on to that picture frame for 
years, you know. I 
think that was my first experience with art, and at the 
time, I 
didn't recognize it as art. It was more classified in the religious little 
knickknacks that I 
had.

Right. So you grew iAp bilingual and bicultural. What were the expectations 
c 
f 
your family for you to ac just here, and what were the expectations that 
the public school had from you? How were they d,,)ferent? 
I 
think the biggest one was the language expectations of how I 
was expected 
to communicate. At home, it was Spanish-only from a 
very young age, and I 
remember.... I 
mean, it's a 
combination of remembering and what I've been 
told because we would have my grandmother come and spend months with 
us. I 
remember as a 
child trying to tell her something in English because I 
was so used to going to school and communicating in English. My dad sat 
me down, and he told me, "Your grandma doesn't understand English. We 
need to speak in Spanish here." That was kind of a 
big realization of, "Oh, I 
need to communicate one way at home, through Spanish, and then at school 
I'm expected to communicate through English." That was one of the big 
expectations and, you know, differences that was between home and school 
growing up. 
And your school environment was a 
little bit d,,) ferent from, maybe, the 
typical Oklahoma public school at some point. 
Yeah, I 
was fortunate. I 
was fortunate. I 
think I 
was really fortunate in this 
sense. We had an international student body. The way the school districts 
were drawn at the time, the family housing for OSU, all of the people that 
were in the family housing had their kids go to the elementary school I 
was 
in, so that was a 
really good.... It was really comforting and a 
really good 
way to grow up and not be so isolated, being from a 
different culture that 
was the majority at the time, you know. It was really kind of reassuring, but 
also at the same time ... kind of had to figure out my way of where I 
fit into. 
Not only was I 
international and bicultural, but it was also specifically 
Mexican versus, you know, my friends were Ethiopian, from Cambodia, all 
these other places. It was an interesting experience definitely. 
Right. What experiences did you have with art in public school? 
In early ... I 
would say basic, very straightforward up until, I 
think, high 
school. Before then, it was very much just art class. Either you take art class, 
5 
or you have PE, you know, your traditional curriculum setup. It wasn't until 
high school where I 
kind of had that freedom of, I 
was in the arts, I 
was in 
orchestra, and then I 
kind of gravitated more towards visual art. That was 
my experience from then. Once I 
discovered visual art and photography in 
high school, that just opened up a 
whole new world for me. It's like, "Oh, 
this is essentially another language, another way to communicate." That's 
what I 
think drew me in really, was discovering it, discovering photography 
as a 
medium and a 
language, another form of communication.

How early did you try to get your own camera? 
It's funny. So the tradition is you have your quinceanera, and that's a 
coming of age. I 
remember telling my parents, "You know what? It's okay. I 
don't have to have that big party. I 
would rather have a 
camera." (Laughter) 
They were very much set on letting me have that experience of having the 
whole, you know, quinceanera, big party, everything. They didn't like that 
idea very much. I 
remember being upset, like, "It'd be so much more 
economical," trying to convince them that, "It's okay. I 
would rather have a 
camera." As late or as early, at the age of fifteen is honestly when I 
really 
started doing photography in a 
more serious form. 
Because you got both? You got a 
camera and your quinceanera? 
I 
got the quinceanera, and I 
remember being upset because I 
didn't get a 
camera for my fifteenth birthday. 
Oh, okay. (Laughs) 
I 
saved up my own money after that. It was a 
combination of birthday 
money and my own saving up that I 
finally got a 
camera, a 
fancy camera, as 
I 
would say, a 
digital camera. 
You went to school at, you went to college at the Ringling [College] cfArt 
and Design in Florida. How did you end iAp there, and what was your 
mG 
jor? 
I 
actually ended up there, I 
would say, by chance, intentionally but by 
chance. I 
was actually surprised. My 
parents were very supportive and 
taking me to [National] Portfolio Day down in Dallas. You know, it's a 
whole bunch of art schools come together. Students go and present their 
portfolios, and you get feedback. I 
remember being in line. I 
had a 
list. I 
had 
a 
mental list of where I 
wanted to go, and, of course, there were places in 
California, New York, big cities. I 
remember being in line, and I 
left.... You 
know, this is a 
packed, big line with families. I 
remember leaving to go off 
6 
to eitherI don't remember why I 
wandered off. I 
came back, and my dad 
said, "Hey, the family ahead of us is going to look at Ringling. You should 
go ahead and go check it out because it seems to be a 
really good school." 
Of course, at the time I 
was like, "Dad, okay sure, sure." I 
went there, and I 
got the feedback. The more I 
learned about the school, the more, you know, 
I 
thought, "Maybe this is where I 
want to go." One of the things that drew 
me to that school in particular was their curriculum. It was kind of, you had 
your foundation classes, but you kind of hit the ground running with your 
major. Being the stubborn person that I 
was then, I 
was like, "I 
don't want to 
wait. I 
want to hit the ground running with photography." So that was kind 
of how that went.

Oh, okay, so you had your focus from the get-go there, too. 
Focus, yeah. Their department was photography and digital imaging. That's 
what I 
studied there. 
What kind cf a 
base did you get? 
Base, as in education? 
Well, in photography. What sort cf base insights did you get that you could 
use later on? 
I 
think at the time what I 
really needed and I 
really got from it was the 
history of it, but more knowledge, more of how photography fits into the 
world of art because up until then, I 
knew it was a 
way to communicate, but 
I 
wasn't aware of how much communication had been done with 
photography. It really put it into context of this isn't just.... There's so many 
little facets of it. The snapshot aesthetic, the portraiture, that's where I 
learned that it had so many different.... You had so many different things 
you could do with photography, and that was kind of what, you know, kept 
me intrigued with the medium. Of course, with that, I 
took other classes, as 
well, which expanded my practice and everything which would lead into 
bookmaking. 
What did you do lifter you graduated? 
After that, I 
spent some time in Florida. Eventually, I 
think not even a 
year 
after graduation, I 
came back to Oklahoma. After that, I 
wasn't sure where I 
wanted to be. Of course, that whole finding myself and finding my purpose 
after college, and so I 
took some time to travel. I 
traveled. I 
ended up 
traveling for the next four or five years or so, back and forth from the West 
Coast to Oklahoma. I 
think that's why I've been here. I've stayed in 
7 
Oklahoma. It's a 
good middle home base, and so I 
spent.... There was one 
year where I 
spent almost a 
good portion of the year traveling up and down 
the West Coast in an RV and experiencing that whole transient lifestyle.

You know, when I 
think about traveling and then when I 
think about 
photography, it's like, well, you know, you've got to set iAp your equipment. 
You see a 
place maybe you want to photograph, but you've got this process 
to set iAp. You're already on the move, and you maybe don't know how long 
you're going to be in that particular spot. How did you handle all that? 
I 
think the way I 
make it work is very much trying to capture that ephemeral 
fleetingness of everything. I 
think that the way I 
approached photography in 
general really blended itself to travel. I 
mean, I 
did have the big film camera 
with me, and sometimes I 
did make those slower images where I 
did set up 
the film, camera, and everything. A 
lot of the times, it was just catching 
those fleeting moments of the window, outside the window. That, in itself, 
was really, I 
think, why I 
kept traveling to make those images of those 
moments that, you know, were fleeting. 
And you said that series is called AmericanWest. Am I 
right? 
It's broken up into a 
couple different bodies of work because, I 
think, I 
just 
made so many images. I 
think when you're in that headspace and you're 
constantly traveling, you're constantly on the move, you constantly want to 
capture. I 
did, anyway. I 
constantly wanted to capture things I 
was seeing, 
from small details to portraits to the landscape. It's broken up into a 
couple 
different bodies. American West is one of them. That one is mostly from the 
last trip I 
made from Seattle down to Oklahoma. Then there's another body 
of work, the 101-2018, which involved traveling up and down the 101. 
Cool. Talk a 
little bit about how you approach portraiture. You do do a 
lot 
cfportraits but unconventional portraits. 
Yeah. That's one of the things I 
think I 
like about photography and the way I 
approach it. It's much more an abstract form. Usually, when you think about 
a 
portrait, it's very straightforward. You're seeing the person's full face. 
When I 
think about what a 
portrait is, it's capturing someone's essence, 
those little details that you don't see when you look at their face. It's more 
about the little components or little mannerisms, their work if I'm 
photographing an artist. It's their workspace. When I 
was traveling, it was 
the person. When I 
made portraits of when I 
was traveling, the person 
8 
wasn't the main focus. It was more of them in relation to the landscape or 
their vehicle that they were traveling in.

You have some wonderful mixed media pieces, too, that are done on panels 
with image transfers. One cf them is called Preserve/Decay. I 
wondered 
what gave you the idea for that series and how you choose your of jects for 
it. 
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that body of work. It is image transfer, and 
then I 
obscured some of the image purposefully with acrylic paint, with 
paint, and then overlaid objects on top. The basis from that is using the 
photography as a 
portal in the background and then layering all the images 
on top to give more of a 
sense of the exact time and place. It was kind of a 
structural approach to photography and kind of thinking about why we 
photograph things at the exact time that we do, and then kind of building off 
of that. All the objects I 
put on top of the image transfers are usually 
decayed or dehydrated fruit, things that people consider past their prime, 
gross, things that aren't beautiful. You generally want to capture and 
photograph things at, you know, the perfect moment. I 
thought, "Well, why 
is that? What is the beauty in preserving something after its `prime'? How 
does that mirror the effect that photography has when we kind of selectively 
photograph things and selectively remember certain aspects?" 
The other thing, your still 1, fes I 
think are so striking, partly for some (f 
those reasons. I 
mean, you're not taking pictures cf conventionally beautful 
sty.
)f. You're taking pictures cf things that are kind cf routine or really well-
worn. What attracts you to the of jects you choose for your still 1, fes? 
I 
think it is that sense of trying to preserve that little moment after the 
perfect moment because, you know, we often idealize and romanticize this 
one big moment and that's not usually what makes that moment special. It's 
usually at the moment surrounding that. I 
think a 
lot of what I 
photograph is 
oftentimes considered gross, but I 
think that there should be a 
focus in that. 
There is beauty in that. It's only gross because it was beautiful at one time. 
It's still beautiful, just in a 
different, more detailed, more used way. There's 
some beauty, too, in the small traces that we leave. 
Yeah, you do feel that strongly that they're beautful in that way. What were 
your impressions cf the Oklahoma art scene when you got back to kind cf 
stay? 
I 
was surprised, honestly. I 
was surprised and intrigued at the way it had 
been evolving since I 
left. At the time, I 
think, when I 
left, I 
was also in a 
different point in my life. I 
had one idea of what art should be and what I 
9 
was exposed to. Having had the experiences I 
had up until then, I 
only saw 
one particular kind of art. When I 
came back, I 
kind of got to know people 
more, got to know the community, and got the opportunity to see that there's 
a 
lot of art actually being made, a 
lot of different kind of art being made. 
There is a 
real growing community here. I 
think that was kind of theI was 
surprised and intrigued by what it can be, what it is becoming, and how, 
yeah, how it's all coming together.

Martinez 
[00:23:09] 
A 
good time to be here, maybe. 
Yeah, it is. Lots of opportunities, I 
would say, for growth. 
What do you consider one c 
f 
your 
first prc 
fessional breakthroughs? 
Honestly, I 
really consider one of the books, an [audition book] I 
made, one 
of my first professional breakthroughs. I 
think it was ... not one of the few 
times but one of the first times I 
really took something personal, something 
really personal for me, and made it into a 
work. Everyone says you have to 
find your voice. I 
didn't know what that meant. I 
was like, "Well, I'm 
talking. I'm showing this is my voice," but I 
think after I 
made that work 
and showed it to people and saw the way people resonated with it, that kind 
of clicked in my head. I 
was like, "This is it. This is what—I'm on the right 
track. Like, this is what people mean when they say ` find your voice."' I 
think that work really was one of a 
breakthrough, a 
professional 
breakthrough. Of course, when you have a 
piece or work like that that really 
resonates, people want to see it. You get to share it, and that leads to more 
opportunities. I 
would say that was a 
big one. 
How have you tried to connect with either the Mexican community in 
Oklahoma or the Mexican American community in Oklahoma? 
I 
don't think I've particularly tried. It's not something that I 
intentionally 
did. I 
kind of just realized one day, I 
was in it. It was more of a, "How can I 
better serve it? How can I 
become a 
better member? Especially throughout 
this past year with everything that's been going on, what does it mean to be 
a 
member of this community?" A 
lot of times, it's just showing up. Simply 
put, it's just being there and holding space really. It's, yeah, being there for 
when your community needs you, and what that looks like, and, yeah, 
finding that space between how do I 
just take up space but also give back. 
Little Thunder 
How have you approached marketing your work?

Martinez

Martinez 
[00:25:23] 
Little Thunder 
Martinez 
Little Thunder 
Martinez 
That's a 
tricky one. (Laughter) I'm still trying to figure out what that is. I 
think the best marketing I 
have is just reaching out and making those 
personal connections. Yeah, it's just putting my work out there and finding 
people whose work I 
like, or who are, you know, part of the communities 
that I'm in and putting my work out there, letting it be known that I 
am here. 
That's kind of my approach. It's more—it goes back to the way I 
photograph. It's a 
much more subtle, interpersonal, one-on-one kind of 
marketing. 
As a 
bicultural bilingual artist, have you run into any preconceptions or 
stereotypes? 
Yes and no, I 
think, because a 
lot of my work up until now, especially apart 
from this project, with the Payne project, a 
lot of it has been more on my 
other interpersonal relationships. It's more on the emotional side rather than 
the cultural side. I 
do think there is, you know, there is some—when people 
think of cultural Mexican art, they do have this idea of what it is. I 
do think, 
yeah, it's hard to marry those two. It's why I 
think I've recently kind of 
meshed what it means to be a 
Mexican artist or an artist that happens to be 
Mexican. There is a 
lot of other ... that emotional side that people think 
about, but it's not necessarily a 
part of all the work I 
make. It just happens to 
be a 
part of who I 
am. 
Over the years, I 
know you and your nuclear family have gone back and 
forth to Mexico and kept in touch with family and extended family. How has 
that shaped you personally and prcfessionally? 
I 
think it's shaped—it's played a 
big role in the kind of work I 
make because 
I 
think a 
lot of the work I 
do, the photographs and images I 
do put out there, 
is kind of questioning where I 
belong. I 
think growing up here in Oklahoma, 
growing up here, it was always, I 
felt comfortable, but I 
never felt like a 
hundred percent this is my culture. Growing up Mexican American, going 
back to Mexico, it's also kind of the same. I 
do feel connected because 
they're my family. It's where, you know, my family is from. At the same 
time, there's that little bit of dissonance where I'm not exactly one hundred 
percent there, either. It's neither here nor there, and it's being an outsider but 
also having a 
little bit of yourself in there, as well. That's kind of shaped and 
kind of reflected back into the work that I 
do, of being there but not actually 
taking one small step back. 
Kind cf the position cf the artist. 
Yeah, yeah.

You got what is called the [Art 365] grant from the Oklahoma Visual Artists 
Coalition. Can you explain what the grant was for, what your prcject was 
for that grant, too? 
Yeah, so the original project proposal was different than what it eventually 
came to be because I 
was.... Overall, it is a 
look at the Mexican Latinx 
culture in this small region, in Middle America essentially. I 
had one vision 
for it, but the way things played out with current events and the restrictions 
we have, its final form is slightly different. You know, people are uneasy 
with having me in their personal spaces, so I've kind of had to readjust. It's 
also taken some time of also reflecting, going back to where do I 
fit into the 
community, or how can I 
best serve, make these portraits that will show the 
story I 
want to show and share without actually being able to be super close 
in people's homes. That's kind of how that project has evolved. It's 
essentially just kind of how everyday life looks like, and being a 
Latinx 
identifying person in Middle America, because, you know, you think of 
Mexican American culture in California, and you have a 
very strong image. 
You think about it in the East Coast, you get another very strong image. It's 
kind of what does it look like, you know, where you have some.... We're 
close to Texas, but we're not exactly Texas, either. Yeah, it's kind of an 
exploration of what it is in Middle America. 
Aside from your grant prcject, what other ways did the pandemic G
.) fect your 
work or you? 
Oh, I 
think the Preserve/Decay series was really a 
good example of how the 
pandemic affected my work and the way I 
think about things because I 
wasn't able to go out and photograph and, you know, be out there, 
essentially. I 
had to kind of take a 
step back. It made me think, going back to 
that series, of why we photograph the things we do and what is an image and 
how to use what I 
had. That's kind of—it made me think of the photograph 
as more of a 
portal and build it up from there. 
Photography has this long history in Western culture and, cf course, these 
power dynamics, which you're aware cf. I 
wonder how you think about them 
in your own photographing work. 
Yeah, I 
do. I 
think I 
approached it in a 
much more.... Generally, when you 
think of the traditional photographer, they're invading someone's space or, 
you know, they're setting up in someone's life. Kind of the way I'm 
approaching it is more of I'm not setting up in, you know, making this big 
setup and coming in as a 
visitor. I'm trying to incorporate more of a 
12 
subtleness to it and the small nuances, not so much making a 
big event of 
setting up a 
portrait. There are times when I 
do. I 
mean, you have to do the 
whole thing where you set up lightings and portrait and the film, get your 
film ready, but I 
think the way I 
approach it has a 
much more natural, easy 
subtleness to it that I 
try to incorporate when I 
do that.

And a 
lot cf times you're your own sul ject. What are the challenges when 
you photograph yourse f? (Laughter) 
The pro is, you're always with yourself, so you're always going to have a 
model. That's always a 
pro, but, you know, it's also a 
self-reflection kind of 
thing, like, "How do I 
relate to this? Why am I 
photographing myself?" 
Usually, it's trying to make that connection with other people, too, that no 
matter how unique or singular experience you may think you're having, 
there's always that emotion sentiment that other people can relate to. 
You're involved, I 
guess with an Oklahoma City Art Collective, or have been 
for a 
while. Can you talk about that? 
Yeah, so, yeah, it's the ... Art Group Oklahoma City. I 
actually came across 
them while I 
was traveling on the West Coast. You know, it was on social 
media. At the time, I 
was curious as to what the Oklahoma art scene would 
look like, and I 
really had no experience with it. That was one of the things 
that kind of, you know, drew me back to Oklahoma. It's a 
very, very 
supportive community of recent graduates or people who are just kind of 
shifting into art. We do studio visits, and it's a 
very supportive community 
that I 
found. That's kind of what made me realize that there is this 
opportunity to make art, that there are people who want to see it, who are 
supporting it in Oklahoma that I 
hadn't previously been aware of. That was 
really reassuring and comforting and helpful, too. 
Little Thunder 
Right, right. So what prcjects do you have coming iAp that you're excited 
about, or what are you sort cf looking at? 
Martinez 
Well, for the next couple of months, I 
have OVAC's [Oklahoma Visual Arts 
Coalition] Art 365 show is coming up. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, cool. 
Martinez 
I 
have that. Yeah, that'll be at Living Arts in Tulsa and then [ARTSPACE 
at] Untitled in Oklahoma City. There's other—it's a 
group of artists, not just 
me, so that's pretty exciting. Beyond that, I've been working on some other 
13 
works, making more work. I 
recently made a 
trip to Mexico last year for 
family matters. Of course, took that opportunity to photograph, make some 
more photographs, so I 
have some more images on those coming out. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, neat, I 
look forward to seeing those. Is there anything we forgot to talk 
about that you'd like to mention? 
Martinez 
I 
don't think so. I 
think we've pretty much covered it. I 
mean, photography 
and bookmaking, I 
think we touched on both of those. 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, that's such an intriguing idea to me that a 
book format would be so 
appealing and would be a 
nice form cf expression for you. 
[00:35:01] 
Martinez 
Yeah, I 
think bookmaking I 
found, actually, I 
think it was the last semester 
(if not, the last year for sure) of school, I 
found that bookmaking and having 
things in a 
very tactile form, because often now today, especially with 
digital photography, there's some kind of disconnect there where the images 
do exist. Then seeing them in print form but then taking another step and 
actually having them in book form and having made the book itself, there's 
another level there that people can connect and relate to. You know, when 
you flip through something, I 
think it adds another tactile feel and sensory. 
Little Thunder 
For sure, becomes a 
whole body kind cf experience that way. 
Martinez 
Yeah, yeah. I 
think especially with the Hey ButterciAp book that I 
did, it's 
very much in a 
more personal journal format. I 
think that's what really 
helped it be relatable to some people, where they felt like, "These could be 
my memories. I 
could have written this." 
Little Thunder 
And mostly, that particular one mostly revolving around past relationships, 
right? 
Martinez 
Yeah, yeah, that's where I, you know, when I 
was making it—when you're 
making things, the way I 
approach it, I 
was like, "No, I 
don't know if people 
are going to connect with this. I 
don't know if this is just my personal 
experience." After showing it to people, and the studio visits, getting that 
feedback of people saying, "Well, I've received messages like these," or, 
"I've been the one sending these messages," that's always good to hear that, 
you know, people can relate. 
Little Thunder 
Right, well, I 
wish you the best cf luck and appreciate your time today, 
Mirella. 
Martinez 
Thank you.
