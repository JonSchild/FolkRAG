Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Beatriz Mayorca is

About Beatriz Mayorea... 
Beatriz Mayorca was born in Venezuela in Maracay City, Aragua, and was surrounded by art 
and music for the majority of her young life. She was drawn to the ways art and architecture 
could be intertwined, and she was heavily inspired and influenced by the Centro Cultural 
Consalidado, a 
local venue designed to host an array of cultural events, and by Ciudad 
Universitaria, a 
World Heritage Site renowned for its art, stained glass, and architectural 
features. She earned a 
degree in communications from the University of Central Venezuela, and 
a 
few years later moved to Oklahoma when her husband was transferred with his job. Ready for 
a 
change, she enrolled at the University of Central Oklahoma to study interior design but soon 
realized she also loved the art classes, strengthening her Fine Arts major in Interior Design with 
a 
minor in sculpture, and she began to experiment working with concrete and wood. After UCO, 
she joined FRINGE Women Artists of Oklahoma and gradually worked her way into her own 
studio space where she's been since 2012. 
Incorporating the architectural designs she loved in her youth with the applications she learned in 
college, Mayorca creates mosaic art, sculptures, and furniture pieces using concrete, metal, and 
wood, and her styles are flavored by her broad European roots. She has participated in dozens of 
solo and group exhibitions, and her public art installations can be found all over the Oklahoma 
City area. She has earned a 
number of grants and fellowships over the years, including the 
Mineck Furniture Fellowship and the O. Gail Pool Travel Award, both in 2019. In 2021, she was 
spotlighted with a 
solo show at Gaylord-Pickens Museum's Oklahoma Hall of Fame. In her 
interview, Mayorca recalled memories of her youth and her beginnings in art, and she shared 
why she loves the media she chooses for her pieces. She explained how engineering and 
architecture are big parts of her art process, and she described how the beauty of Venezuela 
inspires her creations.

Little Thunder 
This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is Friday, 
February 12, 2021, and this is a 
remote interview with Beatriz Mayorca for 
the Library cf Congress OcciApational Folklfe Prcject funded by the Archie 
Green Fellowship. I'm in Tulsa, and, Beatriz, you are in Oklahoma City. 
We've agreed you can respond to questions either in English or Spanish as 
it best suits your needs. I'm looking forward to hearing more about your 
work. Where were you born, and where did you grow iAp? 
Mayorca 
I'm born in Maracay City. [The Aragua State] in Venezuela. That is [one of] 
the states right in front of the Caribbean Sea. That means that my life was 
between the beach and the actually Henri Pittier National Park. A 
beautiful 
rainforest full of wildlife, [one of the reasons nature plays an integral part of 
my inspiration process]. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, my goodness, it sounds beaut 
ful. What kind c 
f 
artwork were you 
exposed to growing iAp, however you would dEfine artwork? 
Mayorca 
[My family and, therefore I, were always involved in some way in the arts. 
Mainly throughout music - classical and folk music. When I 
was a 
girl, I 
played violin, practiced ballet, and for a 
long time, I 
danced folk music. 
Also, my grandpa and one of my brothers have been, among others, in the 
Venezuelan Symphonic and Philharmonic Orchestras. One of the first times 
that I 
was very into the fine visual arts was when I 
moved to Caracas to go 
to the university. I 
went to the University of Central Venezuela. 
Remarkably, this college is full of art. And actually, most of them are inlaid 
or are part of the buildings of its modern architecture. Also, thinking about 
it, one of my first jobs, when I 
lived in Caracas, was in the Centro Cultural 
Consolidado, which was a 
national institution with solid cultural references 
in Venezuela. A 
cultural center where I 
had the opportunity to work in the 
4 
Picasso, Dali, and Miro art exhibitions. Also, the Carlos Cruz-Diez in 
architecture, Art of Japan, and the Second Biennial of Visual Arts organized 
by Christian Dior. They all opened my mind, respect, and perspectives for 
both national and international arts. Even I 
had an opportunity to work there 
when Marcel Marceau presented his act. (Laughter) I 
was only sixteen, 
seventeen. That one blows me away. I 
never imagined that all this would 
influence the development of my career.] 
[00:03:13] 
Little Thunder 
Right, and you did tell me that the university, that UNESCO, it's a 
world 
heritage site because cf that amazing public art which you passed every day. 
Mayorca 
Yes, that university. Actually, Ciudad Universitaria, as it's called, is in the 
world heritage as a 
model of modern art and architecture. One of the things 
[that most influenced me is seeing how the art is inlaid into the architecture, 
but also they play some functionality]. You can see pieces like the 
[Floating] Clouds of the American artist Alexander Calder. It is a 
huge 
piece that is over the Aula Magna [that works not only as an architectural 
feature but also to control the room's acoustic.] The two-story-tall stained 
glass from the French artist Fernand Leger at the main library. It also has 
Venezuelan artists all over the place there. Also, Fernand Leger has a 
beautiful, beautiful mural that [can be appreciated for both sizes. Most of the 
murals there -indoor and outdoor- use colorful mosaic tiles, a 
medium that 
you can also see in my artwork. I 
feel like modern art, the use of color, in 
contrast, its modern/brutalist concrete architecture, have been the main 
inspirations and influence in my work, both media use, and style.] 
Little Thunder 
Well, you got a 
degree in communications, right? 
Mayorca 
[00:05:57] 
Yes. I 
started engineering there. All my family's engineering. My mom, my 
dad, my uncles, everyone is an engineer in my family. I 
went to engineering 
school, and after two years, I 
decided to change career. I 
did my vocational 
test there, and they told me, "Well, you can go to architecture, 
odontology ... or communication." Back then, my mom was single mom, and 
said "No, you know. Dentist and architecture is kind of expensive for me 
right now. Go to communication." (Laughter) I 
went to communication. [I 
worked in this field after I 
graduated. I 
worked for years in journalism, 
public relations, and graphic design.] Then when I 
came here is when I 
decided, "Well, let's do something different." 
Little Thunder 
How did you land in Oklahoma?

Well, my husband, who is an engineer, too, he was transferred. He worked 
in an oil company there, and he was transferred to work here in Oklahoma. 
Worked there for twenty-five years. Yes, [until last year, he lost his job due 
to COVID-19. For the past seven or eight years, as an oil engineer, most of 
the time, he worked internationally.] 
Wow. So when you got a 
chance, I 
guess, (I'm not sure how old the children 
were) you went back to school at the University cf Central Oklahoma. 
Yes, [we came here with my two little kids. Back then, they were six years 
and five months old. Two years later, I 
decided 1 
needed to go back to 
college.] One of the main reasons was [to improve] my English. I 
still speak, 
like, half-language English, but it's more for pronunciation problems.... 
You're doing great. 
I 
decided to [study] design, interior design. Well, [I 
lived in Edmond and 
UCO], the University of Central Oklahoma, was near. [Having the two little 
was too complicated, and being in a 
college nearby was the ideal solution. 
The interior design program at that time required me to take a 
lot of art 
classes. That's when I 
rediscovered my love for the arts. I 
knew before that 
making art was easy for me, but] I 
never see art as a 
profession. I 
see art 
more as a 
hobby. Then in UCO found my passion for design and visual art, 
mainly sculpture.] 
The three dimensional is what you loved. 
Yes. 
And you got some 6pportunities to do a 
bit cf sculpture while you were 
studying then? Did you get a 
chance to do some sculpture while you were at 
UCO? 
Yes, I 
did a 
minor in [ art focused on] sculpture. [Even though it was a 
minor, I 
had the opportunity to take all the sculpture classes generally taken 
for the art major's students, which allowed me to create a 
good boy of work. 
I 
was even invited by my sculpture professor Barbara Weidell to show my 
work with her at the faculty and alumni art exhibition Authentic 
Containment at the Donna Night Gallery in UCO.] 
What materials were you using at that time? 
[Mainly concrete] and wood, yes.

Mayorca 
Okay. 
I 
love concrete. 
From the beginning, huh? What did you do lifter you left UCO, after you 
graduated? 
Well, immediately after, I 
started working [in the interior design field]. I 
did 
a 
few interior design jobs by myself [and also, at the same time I 
joined an 
art group] called Fringe. That [was a 
very active] Oklahoma City women 
artists organization. [With them, I 
started to build my art resume. I 
was busy 
between both art shows and my interior design projects. As a 
designer, I 
really wanted to work in an architecture firm, but that didn't happen for 
some reason. This led me to open and establish my art and design 
studio/workshop]. Actually, I 
started building my workshop back in college. 
Back then with my kids it was impossible to use my "free" time to go back 
to UCO and work in the sculpture shop to do my project. So I 
started buying 
the power tools needed to make my artwork from home. There were a 
lot of 
tools. It was a 
moment that my husband said], "Did you know that you 
cannot keep all this in the garage?" 
(Laughter) In the garage. When did you open your studio? 
Well, I 
have the opportunity with Christie Hackler. She is an artist here in 
Oklahoma City. She is a 
good friend of [the sculptor] David Phelps. She 
[had a 
chance to rent a 
space in his studio warehouse, and] I 
joined her. 
Christie Hackler was the person that also [co-founded] the Fringe group. 
Oh, I 
see, the founder. 
Yes, and I 
went there with her and, later on, after a 
few years, she [left that 
studio space to open] up her own studio in Edmond. I 
stayed [ at the David 
Phelps building]. I 
rented the whole [area because the tools I 
was using 
required more area]. They started getting bigger and bigger. I 
have been 
there since 2011. 
Now, when you make a 
lot cf really beautful design pieces, you know, 
furniture, you know, lamps, tables, chairs, do you do the whole piece from 
start to finish, or do you create a 
prototype and then someone else puts it 
together? 
I 
do every single thing. My hands are in all the steps. I 
go from these [hand-
drafting sketches to the computer. Mainly I 
use CAD, computer-aided 
design, to make all the layout of each of my work. My 
pieces are very 
7 
detail-oriented, and every part needs to fit perfectly. Let's say that this part 
of the process reflects a 
lot on my engineering life and background. Then, 
after all the working drawings are done, I 
make models, I 
play around with 
the material possibilities to finally build the artwork.]

Sure. 
The only extra job that maybe I 
contract is if I 
need powder coating a 
piece 
or [make a 
unique metal cutting that required a 
water jet cutting service], 
but the rest is all mine. 
All you, yeah. They're really beaut ful. And how about your sculptures? You 
mentioned you're working with concrete. That's a 
challenge sometimes to 
have that iATper body strength, no matter what kind cf sculpture you're 
doing, f you're doing big bigger-size sculptures. How did you meet that 
challenge? 
Well, first, it was a 
lot of manpower, or womanpower. (Laughter) 
A 
lot c 
f 
womanpower. 
A 
lot of womanpower. 
Sore muscles. 
Now I 
have a [two ton] crane at the studio that helps me a 
lot. (Laughter) 
You do some welding, also, I 
imagine. 
Yes, I've shown you the last piece. [Yes, my last piece at the Capitol Hill 
Library was almost all welding work. It required a 
lot of welding and 
grinding when I 
was making it.] 
How did you learn that? 
[I mainly self-taught how to weld, which included a 
lot of practice and 
reading books about welding and all its safety. However, work with metal 
was something I 
discovered later after I 
graduated. Actually, by sharing the 
studio with Christie Hackler, who works mainly with metal, and with David 
Phelps, who works mainly with bronze. He still guides me and answers all 
my questions about it.]

Little Thunder 
Mayorca 
I 
see, because you would cften consult with her •f 
you got in a 
bind or had.... 
Cool. What was the prc 
fessional art scene like when you 
first broke into it? 
It sounds like women were struggling to make a 
place for themselves a 
bit. 
Definitely, yes. [In general, the work that I 
do require a 
lot of strength, and 
physical power]. Not everyone see a 
woman like, "I 
know she's a 
welder," 
or, "she can do that." Sometimes, when I 
show people [my artwork, they 
usually react like another person helped me build it. Sometimes, these types 
of reactions made me feel a 
little disappointed because I 
wasn't taken 
seriously or people just shut the doors. I 
am lucky that my husband, Juan 
Carlos, is always there to insist that I 
continue my career. It's not easy for a 
women to work in this field! The noise around could be loud, but we need to 
focus on what we want.] 
Little Thunder 
Right. You don't pay attention. What was an early break, an early good 
piece cf luck in your career? 
Mayorca 
[I think it was the first opportunity I 
had to create a 
public artwork. With this 
work, I 
consolidated in one field my passion and love between architecture, 
art, and design. Not all artists like to navigate all the administrative work 
and collaboration that implied creating a 
public piece. This opportunity was 
possible by the Artist Invitational Award granted by the Downtown OKC 
Partnership. This award allowed me to create a 
sculptural public seating 
group for the Hightower Park in downtown Oklahoma City. A 
park that is 
right in front of the Oklahoma City Museum of Art and the City Hall. This 
series of benches made of concrete, metal, and colorful design glass mosaic 
artwork opened the doors at set my 
first step to start growing in this field. I 
was very lucky to be able to do that.] 
[00:16:40] 
Little Thunder 
What are some cf the things you learned in the process? 
Mayorca 
In that process? [The most important aspect of the process itself in public art 
is the permanent communication and collaboration with all the parts, such as 
the community involved, the City representatives - the art office, park 
department, planning department, all the stakeholders, and the client. I 
learned all about the administrative process to be able to present the 
proposal to the City Arts Committee and Design Committee. Also, put in 
practice all the design specifications needed to follow the ADA 
guidelines 
required for a 
public seating design and installation. Which also included 
following local, state, and federal regulations. There are many details to 
consider, and I 
loved and learned every step of the way.] Not every artist 
loves that administrative part. 
Little Thunder 
But you have your communications degree. 
9 
Mayorca 
Yes. 
Little Thunder 
Mayorca 
[00:19:23] 
You were well-suited. You've won some other commissions. One was the 
Mineck Furniture Fellowship to study with Vivian Beer in Boston. Were you 
already familiar with her work, and what did you learn during that time? 
That was an award that I 
won [in 2019 grand by the Society of Arts and 
Crafts and founded by the John Mineck Foundation]. With that fellowship, 
[I intended] to do the workshop with Vivan. [A 
very intensive workshop in 
2020, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last weekend I 
took a 
little online workshop with her about concrete and model making. 
Very informative! This Saturday, I'm going to another one that is all about 
using different digital technologies. And hopefully, I'll be able to attend her 
2-weeks workshop at the Penland School of Craft in North Carolina this 
summer. I 
knew about her throughout an article at the American Crafts 
Council magazine. Her work style is different than mine, but she mainly 
worked with metal and concrete with interests me a 
lot. See and learn 
different approaches and techniques to keep improving my work. Also, this 
fellowship award allowed me to improve my studio space. I 
was able to buy 
few great tools.] 
Little Thunder 
Oh, good. Another award you got was the [O. Gail Poole] Travel Award. I 
hope that was hcfore 2020. I 
don't remember. 
Mayorca 
Yes, it was late 2019. [I 
was granted that award by the Norman Arts 
Council] with the opportunity to go to the SOFA fair that is in Chicago. It is 
a 
Sculpture Objects Functional Art fair [where I 
had a 
chance to research] 
all the galleries, new trends, and new materials... 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, call attention to. 
Mayorca 
...pero en la mente mia, no se por que. 
Little Thunder 
Well, and Chicago is such a 
beaut ful art city, too. Did you have any time to 
look around? 
Mayorca 
Yes, a 
lot. I 
love Chicago. 
Little Thunder 
[00:21:19] 
What are some cf the d,.)ferences, maybe, between the Venezuelan attitude 
towards art, I 
mean, not that there's one attitude, but possible d,.) ferences in 
attitude in Venezuela towards art and towards art here in Oklahoma?

Okay, my experience, I 
don't want to talk about the last twenty years 
because Venezuela's [political changes influenced the entire country's entire 
political, social and cultural scene. However, before that, Venezuela had 
been very open and supportive to the arts, theater, music, and visual arts.] 
Here in Oklahoma, I 
feel like it's opening right now, and it's growing. In the 
last few years, it has been growing fast. Actually, the art community itself 
has been growing a 
lot. I'm thankful for that. I 
don't know about the other 
cities, but maybe Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, Edmond, they're opening 
a 
lot and supporting local artists. [ Still in a 
developing process, but it is 
evolving] 
That's nice to hear. 
Yes. 
How about galleries? Are they important for selling your work? Is it more 
important to do your website sales? How do you handle that? 
Website sales hasn't been the big one. The galleries [sales], yes. Gallery 
shows helped a 
lot. [Although, because the last few years, my focus has 
been on public art, I 
haven't had the time to develop a 
good body of work to 
show in the galleries] 
Getting your work out to the public. Are you applying for any big public art 
prc jects at the moment? 
Yes, I 
applied for a 
few. [I 
can't say for which ones now.] (Laughter) I 
just 
finished [my last public work] in December. [And even though I 
always 
finish my public works very tired, I'm always looking forward to a 
new 
one.] 
So you need, like, a 
month to reciAperate or something? 
Something like that. (Laughter) Something like that. 
What are some c 
f 
your favorite sculpting materials and/or interior design 
materials? Are they dj ferent? 
Definitely, [you made me think of wood, the warming feeling that it 
provides. It reminds me how warm and friendly the Latin culture is. I 
also 
like concrete; even though it is a 
cold material, it has its own life; it gets 
beautiful and with more character with time. And finally, metal in different 
forms. It could be clean and shine, weathered with a 
patina finish, or with a 
11 
paint treatment. But the industrial feeling and play between all three of them 
fascinate me.] 
Little Thunder 
[00:25:20] 
Mayorca 
It gets that patina and weathering. So the character comes through with 
those materials. Do you use them in your interior design work as much, or is 
that a 
d,,)ferent set cf.... 
[Interior design is different. It's a 
different set. My interior design solutions 
are not about my style. Interior design is more about the clients' wants and 
came with solutions that make them feel comfortable, always caring for their 
health and wellbeing. I 
do my best to get the client's needs. Maybe, I 
educate 
the client about the right choices around what they want, but I 
don't impose 
my style on their spaces or the space of the final user.] 
Little Thunder 
Right, right. You have several design lines, interior design lines. Can you 
talk about your Latin pieces? 
Mayorca 
[00:27:20] 
Yes, my Latin [Collection is informed by pieces] focused on good memory 
from my country. [ The one is titled Angel Falls is inspired by the Salto 
Angel in Venezuela. This particular waterfall is the highest fall of water in 
the world. I 
have the Cata Lounge Chair that is inspired by Bahia de Cata. I 
beach where I 
grew up. That is a 
beach, like, thirty minutes from my house. 
The Canoe Stool is inspired by the canoes that people use there on the rivers 
in Venezuela. I 
also have Orinoco, which is a 
beautiful long and small 
wooden canoe-like. All are inspired by good memories that I 
have from my 
country. I 
wanted to bring that memory with me and share them with 
everyone to make them know about Venezuela, my heritage and somehow 
bring a 
smile to the people.] 
Little Thunder 
That's a 
good goal. You received the [Most Outstanding Hispanic Artist] 
award. What was that like? How did that feel? 
Mayorca 
Well, [it was really a 
surprise]. I 
didn't expect it. [It was a 
great feeling. 
Because most of time, I'm focused on design and create my work and didn't 
realize that other people are looking at it.] You go, "Wow. Like, I 
didn't 
really do anything expected to receive that one." I 
think that was back in 
2014. I 
was very proud and impressed about it. I 
said, "Well, my work is 
paying off." (Laughter) 
Little Thunder 
You've talked about your work as rEflecting both kind cfglobal influences 
and also Mestizo influences. Can you talk about that a 
little more?

Mayorca

[00:30:01]

Little Thunder 
Mayorca 
[00:31:56] 
Yes, because sometimes when you talk about getting a 
Hispanic artist from 
Venezuela, my art is not [precisely] about Venezuelan [craftsmanship]. But 
when you move to another country and start knowing other cultures, all 
these cultures [start melting together. Even though some of my artwork uses 
wood and weathered patinas, having a 
strong reminiscence of the rainforest, 
the clay, and the warm sense of the Hispanic communities, it is also 
reinforced by the use of bright and vibrant colors. On another side, I 
also 
play with clean lines approaches characteristic of a 
modern European style, 
including concrete and metal as a 
medium. It's a 
mix that reflects my mix of 
racial and ethnic ancestries, a 
mix of cultures, countries, and ways of living. 
It's one thing that I 
can't deny, I 
came from a 
mestizo heritage, and my 
cultural approaches keep molding and adapting along with my contact and 
growth here in the United States.] 
Right, European. 
[European heritage]. I 
think it's a 
beautiful thing when we can start mixing 
and knowing other cultures. [Our way to see and appreciate the world 
expands.] 
Right. So talk about what it was like when you first moved into your studio 
and you actually.... 
Well, when I 
moved to my studio, I 
actually was working for a 
show [ at the 
Oklahoma Science Museum. There were very busy months when I 
started 
there. It was crazy but exciting at the same time.] Excited to be able to have 
my own space. Sometimes when I 
see the picture back, [I 
reflected on when 
I 
was working in from my garage and how the work started to expand from 
the garage to the house inside. In general, my works of art have large 
dimensions, and they were taking all over. And now, I 
can move and work 
around the different work areas inside one single room.] 
What was one cf the most challenging sculptures you've done so far? 
Oh, I 
think all of my pieces [always came with] little challenges because 
[almost all of them have] a 
lot of engineering [involved and are] detail-
oriented, not only from the design point of view but also from the making 
perspective. [Most of the time, they are constituted by multiple parts, and I 
don't know how the final sculpture will look until I 
put all the pieces 
together. But I 
love challenges; they make me grow. I 
always learn tons 
from my work.]

Oklahoma City. 
The show opened this week, Tuesday. 
Oh, okay. 
Yes, [it will be open until] April 9th, I 
think. [There will be a] few artists 
talk online. With all this COVID thing, the opening and the show [will] be 
kind of different. I'm going to have, I 
think, [two talks online: one artist talk 
and one activity for kids.] I'm going to have a 
Meet and Greeting the Artist 
but late in March. I 
think late in March or early April. 
Cool. How many pieces? How many pieces did you put in? 
I 
have there I 
think eight pieces, eight or nine pieces there. 
Was there a 
theme, a 
particular theme or.... 
[It's more a 
retrospective of my work. The main concept is Between Play & 
Function. I'll have one of my very, very first pieces, which I 
love, the 
"Newton's Cradle Balls." Also, I 
will have some of my sculptural furniture, 
both wood and concrete, and some of my lighting work.] 
Cool. Have you had any other virtual shows during the pandemic? 
No, no, last year all was canceled. 
Yes. 
[Right now, I 
will have only this one for this year. The art shows are a 
little 
bit different now for the pandemic situation. People are still trying to 
figuring out what would be the right move. We 
still don't know what's going 
to happen, no?] 
Little Thunder 
Right, right. How did you get through the pandemic? It's hard as an artist. 
14 
Mayorca 
Yes, as an artist, it was hard. Even though all of my shows and plans 
changed completely, I 
got help from NALAC [National Association of 
Latino Arts and Cultures]. [It is the national art association for support the 
Latinx art community. And also, some economic relief help from the 
government in the first months of the pandemic.] 
Little Thunder 
Oh, good. 
Mayorca 
When one door close, another opens. [I 
got the opportunity to start last 
August as an artist-in-residence at the School of Design of the University of 
Central Oklahoma. That helped my family and me a 
lot.] 
Little Thunder 
Yes, where you went to school. 
Mayorca 
[00:36:50] 
Yes, exactly. And that was a 
big, big help. [This pandemic was especially 
hard because my husband lost his job in April last year. But we always 
figured it out. We are here and stronger and getting together. In the first 
months of the pandemic, I 
used it for organization and reworked all my art 
stuff. I 
organized their images and even my bio and artist statement. We 
should, as an artist, keep update all that data. One more thing I 
did was join 
all those online conversations that started with this pandemic. Online 
discussions where I 
had the opportunity to hear from designers and artists 
from all over the world, and an opportunity that maybe never in my life I 
thought I 
could listen to them or have a 
conversation with them.] 
Little Thunder 
You've kind cf found a 
new community, a 
new community there. That's cool. 
So how is it going doing your residency? How is that going for you? 
Mayorca 
[It goes well; this residency is more focused on teaching. It's in the Design 
School. Actually, it's good. It is a 
one-year residence ending in May this 
year. I'm still learning a 
lot. The teaching is not about me only. Learning is 
more about the students and what they can do, even their background, 
because every person is different. It's not about the classmates in general, 
but how I 
can teach and make each student, individual, learn what they have 
and know before my class. I 
teach the curricula or content of the course 
itself and mix it with my professional experience as an artist and a 
designer 
outside of the classroom. It is an excellent way to show them the importance 
of the actual class material later in their career. I 
think bringing this blend to 
the students is essential for their own professional development. I'm letting 
now the students what is going on outside the classroom, their opportunities, 
my mistakes, and what I 
did to succeed.]

For sure, to prepare them when they graduate. What's a 
new material or a 
new piece that you've been working with that you're especially excited 
about? 
[Right now, I'm more excited about the different techniques and technology 
I 
can use to improve my performance with the materials I'm using now. The 
use of technology to make my life easier, the building process more precise. 
Technology as digital programs as Rhino, 3D printing, and how to transfer 
all those designs to my new router table. They will expand the possibilities 
of making new and different design approaches which could be more 
challenging than making them only by hand.] 
Wow. 
[Actually, all of these new processes and technology are part of the Vivian 
Beer classes that 1 
have been taking online, learning about this technology, 
the different and more effective ways to manipulate the metal and concrete, 
also new techniques and processes for model-making, and metal forming...] 
Oh, okay. 
...because my work is very [rectilinear]. I 
have few [wood pieces with 
organic and curvilinear shapes], but I 
want to work more organically on 
metal. That is my new thing or my new focus. Also bringing aluminum, 
[which is a 
light metal and more weather-resistant], to be able also to make 
my life easier. (Laughter) 
That sounds great. 
In the public art field, I 
work with materials that are more durable and 
weather-resistant. It's very important. That's one of the things I 
wanted to 
keep learning. 
That's true, yeah, to have that in mind. Well, what's been the biggest 
highlights c 
f 
your art career so far? 
Probably the piece that I 
installed in December [ at] the Capitol Hill Library. 
That is a 
huge outdoor sculpture. There are three big metal paper-like-
[origami] airplanes. Each one is, like, nine by ten feet. They are hanging 
with cable. I 
think that [one is] very special for me. [It's special] because it's 
for a 
library that is in a 
Hispanic community. [Her concept was inspired in 
them, but also on the library function itself. Origami is not only an art; it 
also involves a 
lot of math, engineering, and physics, a 
lot of different 
16 
curricula that we can find and learn in a 
library. Also, the site of that 
particular library was where the first airplane takes off here in Oklahoma.]

Oh, my goodness. Oh, okay, yeah. 
They are very colorful and very playful. That is what the Hispanic 
community, the color of the Hispanic community and that freedom to play 
in the street, that is the feeling that I 
miss from my culture. I 
really want to 
let my kids to go out to the street to play. (Laughter) That is one of my 
proud moments, yes, that one or the last one. 
Yeah, I 
can't wait to see that. 
Yes, I 
need to send you the pictures. 
Yes, that would be great. I'll see it in person someday, too. What has been a 
low point in your career? 
I 
don't—there are moments, maybe last year. The start of last year, the 2020 
was like, "I 
don't know what I'm going to do. I 
should just close the studio 
because we need to pay rent. We need to keep paying insurance. We need to 
pay the bills and utilities. Is that decision okay? What are we going to do? I 
should close, I 
should keep going, or I 
should leave the country." Because 
when you get in that point, maybe that I 
was here and when my husband was 
working actually, I 
was able to do all that I 
did because I 
have another 
person that also helped with the bills. After a 
big talk, it's one decision. 
"Okay, I 
cannot put it all to the side because there's already growth. I 
have 
built a 
career in the arts. I 
need to keep going, and..." 
That's right. 
"...we'll figure it out on the way." 
That's right. We need your work. Is there anything else you'd like to talk 
about that we didn't get to cover? 
Not that I 
can remember right now. (Laughter) No, I 
am just so grateful for 
the invitation, actually. That is one of the things I 
just didn't expect. I 
feel 
like my life is full of unexpected things because, as I 
say, I 
work and work 
and work. I 
don't see maybe where I 
grow, what I'm building back. I'm 
building.... I 
don't know how to say ... realizando todo que voy dcjando, uno 
no realiza or no la veo.

Little Thunder 
Right, you're focused on what's in front cf you, and you're not thinking 
about all those things. Well, I've really enjoyed what I've seen c 
f 
your work 
online. I 
hope to see it all in person. 
Mayorca 
Anytime. 
Little Thunder 
Thank you for your time today. 
Mayorca 
Thank you, Julie. You are more than welcome. Anytime that you come here, 
I 
will go all around with you and show you my work. 
Little Thunder 
Oh, that would be neat. Okay, bye-bye. 
Mayorca 
Bye. Thank you, Julie.
