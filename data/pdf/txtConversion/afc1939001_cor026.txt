[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
General Delivery Houston, Te x. 4/8/1939.
Dear Mr. Spivacke: At last the machine and the records are all in one place, put together
and seemingly in fine condition. When the machine got to Port Aransas it wouldn't budge.
I drove it to Austin where I knew I could get a competant mechanic. He found the trouble,
and it was real and not imaginary trouble. The records met me here. Tomorrow I make my
first recordings.
Alan advises me strongly to use emerald-printed cutting needles, but Presto sent only 2
steel cutting needles. Please have three or four emerald needles sent to me by air mail. I
should like to present you with records as nearly flawless as possible.
Until I notify you otherwise my address will remain, General Delivery, Houston, Texas.
Sincerely always, John A. Lomax
