Try to see Ric and Pincetich in L. A.  together,
 
John Pincetich,  Dep.  Dir.,  Bic.  Comm.
 
1.
 The ethnic groups are all in minority - there is no
 
majority - the cult.  and political effect is unique.
 
The groups keep alive traditions in a fashion very
 
different from those in the states on the mainland.
 
2.
 The Ghana tour came to Hawaii and influences the
 
concept that both men have on what we want.
 
3
.
 Politically,  J.  Pincetich  (
Schriver button)  feels we
 
should pursue Am.  Samoa in addition to Hawaii.
 They
 
have an NEA grant and should be approached. 
Preis agrees.
 
4
.
 Arts,  mores,  trad.  and customs of the ethnic components
 
which comprise the Hawaiian people.
 Pries is architect
 
who came to Hawaii as planning advisor to the government - was
 
one of the drafters of the original arts council
 
legislation in  '65.  (
2 mos.  before NEA legis.  signed).
 
Interprets the legislation in Hawaii as supportive of
 
pluralism - encourage each ethnic group to retain its
 
cult.  uniqueness.
 Orig. was  "arts  and humanities" -
 
changed to culture 
and the arts.
 
Politically and culturally very sophisticated.  Austrian
 
architect - came to Hawaii in  '39.

 Reason that Japanese use recorded music

At least some should come from Samoa.
 
2.
 12 people seems minimum

 Perhaps split:

Samoa.

 Suggests we first contact Governor of American Samoa

make decision on funding.
 They should know Hawaiian-
Samoans stud ready to cooperate however necessary -
send Gov.  list of suggested participants.

B.
 Singing
 
Crafts workers can join in singing - perhaps some
 
in dancing).
 The best crafts workers  (
weaving
 
particularly)  are middle-aged whereas  the best
 
dancers are younger women.
 
6 men  (
2 of whom beat gong,  drum, bells,  ukelele
 
and/or guitarist)
 
Some of these men can help house builder
 
4 women to sing and dance.
 
Crafts - 1 to 5 would be best if brought from Samoa
 
directly.
 Chief feels,if possible,  all should come
 
from Samoa.
 Chief has superb sneaking voice and would
 
be pleased to assit as presenter.
 l
ie is very gracious
 
and cooperative and impressive.
