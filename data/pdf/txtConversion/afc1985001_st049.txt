JACKIE FRAZIER 5112 B1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
There lived a rich old merchant In London he did dwell He had a lovely daughter The truth
to you I'll tell - Oh the truth to you I'll tell.
She had sweethearts a-plenty To court her day and night But none but Jackie Frazier
Could gain her heart's delight Oh could gain her heart's delight.
Jackie he's a sailing Upon the deep blue sea And soon he will be anchored To the wars of
Germany.
Her father flew in a passion And straightway he did go To bargain with the captain To
throw Jack overboard Oh to throw Jack overboard.
Polly went to a tailor shop She dressed in men's array And bargained with the captain To
carry her away Oh to carry her away.
Your waist is mighty slender Your fingers white and small Your cheeks too red and rosy To
face those cannonballs Oh to face those cannonballs.
I know my waist is slender My fingers both white and small But it'll never make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall On to see ten thousand fall.
Polly she's a sailing She's sailing far and wide She's sailing for her darling boy. Her darling
boy to find Oh her darling boy to find.

Polly she safe landed Upon the battle shore I'm marching with the soldiers Where Jackie
marched before Oh where Jackie marched before.
Polly she safe landed Upon the battle ground And among the dead and wounded Her
darling boy she found.
She picked him up in her two arms And carried him down to town And called for a
physician To cure his bleeding wound Oh to cure his bleeding wound.
Now Jack and Polly's married And they both do agree Now Jack and Polly's married And
why not you and me Oh why not you and me.
