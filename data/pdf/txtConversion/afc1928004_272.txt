NOTICES OF THE PRESS. 
CAPITOL THEATItE'r —CHRIS 'A:Nat LENA. — Chris and Lena 
will be given for the fourth time this evening. 
Interest-
ing play, and well cast, by the Lucien Barnes' Combina-
tion, Sallie Adams and Jule Keen in the leadiiig parts. 
In 
addition, a 
first-class olio with the following stars: Frank 
George, G. A. Hill, Lillie and Minnie La Verde, Peter 
Goshan, Effey Kearns, Ned and Willie Ainsley, and Bella 
La Verde. The Ainsley Burlesque, the " Belles of the 
Kitchen," in which the Volkes shine with so much suc-
cess. 
The burlesckue is superior to the original, the fun 
of the piece being quadrupled. 
Best travesty of the year 
and performed with immense spirit. 
Don't fail to see it. 
The La Verdes are excellent in their parts, and too much 
praise cannot be bestowed upon them. 
ST. JAMES THEATRE. — This evening the St. James Co-
mique will re-open as a 
Variety Theatre, under a 
new 
management. and with a 
corps of genuine artists, among 
whom are Lew Drimmer, the lion banjoist and comme-
dian, Ned Turner, Frankie Turner, Bella La Verde, the 
charming young vocalist, the La Verde children unrivalled 
as character artists, M. O'Prien and Ed. Snow. 
The com-
pany now combines some first class talent, and the man-
agement promise new and good faces every week. 
Tau Lit Vraipts.—Saturday evening next these popular 
child artists take a 
benefit at the St. James Theatre. They 
are very clever artists, indeed, having very few superiorS 
in their line of business, singing and dancing exceedingly 
well. 
Their style is original, and a 
good house should re-
ward them. 
In addition to the La Verdes, a 
host of talent 
will appear, both of professionals and amateurs. 
This 
-will be the last and only appearance of the La Verdes in 
his city for some time. 
GRANT) CENTRAL. — The opening of the Grand Centra-
last night for the fall and winter season, was very auspi-
cious. 
The house was crowded, and at 8 
o'clock the sign 
"standing room only" was hung out. 
With two excep-
tions the programme was a 
very pleasing one, and the ef-
forts of the performers were well received by the audience. 
The La Verde children in their specialties were worthy the 
repeated encores they received. 
The California quartette 
were squelched, as they deserved to be. 
Miss Martha 
Wren and James Collins, in their versatile performance, 
" 
A 
Terrible Fix," caused the audience to boil over with 
mirth. 
They have good voices, and rendered selections 
from 
Trovatore, Guy Mannering and La Perichole. 
J. Brookhouse Bowler, the tenor, sang finely and was en-
cored several times—but the best singing of the evening 
vas by Miss Belle L. E. Verde. 
She is also a 
fine jig dan-
cer. 
The Eine brothers, Franklin brothers, Miss Norah 
Campbell and the miniature second regiment concluded' 
the fun of the evening. 
This evening the programme will 
be stronger than even than was last night's. 
Glom) CErrraeL.—The Grand Central was crowded to 
its utmost capacity, last night, notwithstanding the coun-
ter attractions. 
The programme was replete with en-
joyable features. 
Without detraction we may say that the 
most pleasing and attractive features of the entertainment 
were the La Verde sisters, who were severally vigorously 
encored by the delighted audience.

I 
love to promenade Broadway, and see the funny sights, 
To mash the chaps, who wink and smile, is one of my delights; 
I 
dote upon a 
fine mustashe, it may be wrong, you see, 
But then the wearer if he's nice, is just the boy for me.

I 
love to gallop through the Park, the ribbons in my band, 
To pass the trotters on the road, is dashing, too, and grand; 
Its nice to have a 
beau along, the girls will all agree, 
And if he's gay, and full of fun, he's just the boy for me. 
Cuo.—The dashing, flirting, jolly swell, Sr.c.

I'd like to capture if I 
could, a 
chap to suit my mind, 
He must be handsome, got the stamps, and always good and 
kind; 
So if there's any, out of all the faces, here I 
see, 
Who'd like to take me as I 
stand- 0, he's the boy for me.

VERD Children, and sung 
by them only. 
Girl.—At a 
ball. last night, I 
met 
A 
swell I 
c 
Ln't forget ; 
With fig,un. face and form, 
That was i.;o splendid ; 
Who made love at first sight, 
Tho' perhaps it wasn't right; 
His style was such I 
could'nt feel offended. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
met him at the ball last night, boys, 
I 
met him at a 
ball last night; 
And to meet him here, to-night, 
I 
promised at first sight ; 
Tho' I 
met him at a 
hall last night— 
Enter Boy.—Yes, I 
met you at a 
ball last night love, 
I

And by the stars above I 
swore eternal love,

Boy.—Pray don't feel offended at what I 
have said, 
Nor leave me with a

Sir, I 
am not offended, 
But really, is it right 
That you should fall in love 
So deeply, at first sight ? 
[Chorus as before. 
As sung by the LA. VERDE Children. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell the village Belle— 
The idol of my lay ; • 
And when evening casts its shades, 
0! what a 
happy Southern sod, 
We wandered forth in hand and hand, 
To pick the cotton pods. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell, the village Belle, 
The idyl of my lay. 
CHORUS. 
Cotton pods, snow white, 
Beaming in starlight! 
Emblem, sweet Nellie,. of my love for you. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I 
first gave you the heart that was true. 
Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again. 
! 
here you are, my own sweet love, 
0! come and sit down by ray side, 
And answer, darling quickly, do! 
And say you will be my bride. 
Both. —I 
see the love light in your eyes, 
Of when ve first did meet; 
And now we are happy with our joys, 
In love and kisses sweet. 
Cotton pods, &a.

Words by JOHN T. 
RUMEDGE. 
They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
That no one with me can compare; 
You can tell by the style that I 
dress in, 
If you meet me, wherever you are; 
The ladies all smile on me sweetly, 
A 
thing that I 
most dearly love; 
You can hear them remark as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, he's handsome and winning, 
The dear little fePow I 
love ; 
The ladies all say as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
I 
am counted sweetest of waltzers, 
At boating they say I'm immense ; 
I 
bet on the favorite horses, 
I 
am gif4ed with lots of good sense; 
I 
move in the bon- ton society, 
I'm counted a 
lucky young cove; 
Its a 
saying wherevei I 
wander, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
" 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &c. 
I 
go to the watering places, 
' 
To live through the hot weather spell; 
Make love to the sweetest of faces, 
A 
pastime I 
like mighty well; 
My lot in this life is a 
nice one, 
in fact it has long been the case; 
I 
have really more fun than the next one. 
Don't you wish you could step in my place ? 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &c. 
Boy.—So now you see we happy are, 
And hope you are the same; 
I'm sure you'll say ' tis only fair 
To play this little game.

And if we did succeed— 
And we receive applause from you— 
We happy are indeed. 
CHORUS. 
Nobby—airy—light as a 
fairy! 
Music playing sweet and gay; 
Time is fleeting, 'while we're greeting 
You with our good-bye! 
If we've pleased you and not teazed you, 
May your smiles approve; 
For we're merry, blithe and airy— 
Happy as a 
dove—then watch our feet, 
So nice and neat—we dance to ev'ry measure. 
Girl.—For he is called so gay and sweet. 
Bog. —And she's my little treasure.

shady umbrella, 
As down the streets we go;

With hands and feet so small;

No matter what you do, 
His heart is ever true, 
His heart is true to Poll!

MAN OF WEALTE 
As sung by the LA 
VEBD Children. 
• 
man of wealth and cruel hearted, 
Revelling in your plentious store; 
Humanity is sure departed 
From your heart and from your door; 
The bitter winds in vain plead for me, 
What to do or where to go! 
Oh! Uncle, save ray little Sister, 
Or she will die out in the cold. 
GL-1.—Oh ! 
Brother, dear, don't weep, I 
pray thee, 
For the day may yet be bright; 
Or if we die we shall be Angels, 
Living in you land of light; 
And as for him, our wicked Uncle, 
He shall reap as he shall sow; 
For he has left his Brother's children 
Starving, here, out in the snow. 
As sung by the LA. VERD CruLDBLIN. 
Both Sing.—Though humble my station, 
And rough is my speech; 
To the wealthy and proud 
Oft a 
lesson I'll teach ; 
And in Charity proffer 
The hand when I 
can. 
'Tis the heart, not the pocket, 
Is what makes the man. 
As sung with great success by LILLIE LA

My name is Joe Muggens, a

I 
once courted a 
lass and I 
felt rather shy; 
I 
stood under the water-spout, 
'Till I 
was nearly wet through, when she said, Joe, 
Come into the kitchen, lad— 
Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do.

Fol de rol dol—Fol de rol dol; 
Fol de rol diddle dol, fol de rol day, 
I 
went into the kitchen and made it all right— 
Three pounds of fat bacon I 
put out of sight; 
Says she, Joe can do with a 
dumplin or two— 
Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do. 
Fol de rol, 
I 
finished the dumplins and wanted to go, 
She looked in my face, I 
felt rather blue; 
Says she Joe, why don't you squeeze me, 
Like a 
lover that's true— 
Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do. 
Fol de rol, &c. 
Now married we are, and happy we be— 
But we ain't got no babbles to bless her and me; 
Says she, Joe, you may wait awhile, 
We might have a 
few—

lass, I 
don't care if I

THE BELLE OF THE AVENUE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. Sung by the 
LA 
VIED SISTERS. 
I.. H . 
HARDING Music Pub., 200 Bowery, N. Y. Price 10 cents. 
My love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ev'ry day; 
And charms ev'ry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, graceful and gay ; 
The swells, when they see her, go crazy; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. (Oh 1) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee; 
She is the star of society, 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes, when it's fine in the afternoon, 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
" 
Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" „ 
" 
0, ma 1" sha replies, " do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha 1 
ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day; 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceive 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree; 
And while we're apart, I 
know in my heart, 
She's all the time wishing for me. (Ala!) 
She is the belle, eta

Never Prove False To a 
Friend. 
Written by CLAUDE DE 
HAVEN, 
Sung with great applause 
by Tor PASTOR, America's Own Comic Vocalist. 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
In love and in friendship be true; 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
Re may be dishonest—a 
knave— 
In other's opinion—but then 
To you. he is generous and kind, 
And one of the noblest of men. 
CHORUS. — Never prove false, lex. 
Is any man free from each fault, 
All righteous and good in his ways ? 
Lives there a 
woman on earth, 
That she can be named but in praise ? 
Never speak ill of a 
friend, 
To gossipers keep closed your ear ; 
An excellent rule, in the main, 
Is to credit one-tenth what you hear. 
CHORT313.—Never speak, &A. 
Stand by a 
man in distress, 
When you know he is really in need; 
Altho' by misfortune he falls, 
There's honor for yon in the deed; 
That one may deceive you 'tis true, 
Then his, and not yours. the disgrace; 
Because we find one man untrue, 
Should we wrong and distrust a 
whole race? 
CHOWS. — Never prove false, &e. 
Censure a 
man for his faults, 
Give him honor where honor is duet; 
But never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
But should you prove false to a 
friend, 
And think he's ungrateful to you, 
When the journey of life's at an end, 
You'll find he's superior to you. 
Written by CLAUDE Dz HAVEN. 
Sung by Miss NELizz 
PERTS, the great Operatic Soprano. 
Drifting along, this human barque, 
Frerghtecl with manhood, love and woe; 
Drifting along, with shadows dark, 
Our Pilot and Captain the deadliest foe. 
Drifting along with the waving corn, 
The ripened harvest and new mown hay; 
Drifting along, with the setting Sun, 
From early morn ' till close of day. 
Drifting along, with a 
weary life, 
. 
Encouraged by phantasy—never.there; 
Drifting along, with care and strife, 
To build our Castles in the air; 
Drifting along, from our childhood's home, 
From the cheery glow of a 
Mother's love; 
Drifting along, contented to roam, 
Painting pen pictures, as onward we move. 
Drifting along, on the treacherous sand, 
By the shadowy beach that meets the wave ; 
Drifting along, to that distant land, 
For the tide of life mankind, to save; 
Drifting along, with sin and remorse, 
A 
saddened heart and prostrate form; 
Drifting along, a 
stiffened corsa, 
'We are drifting to Him who shelters from harm.

HE. 
WHILE walking out one evening, 
The sun had gone to rest, 
The little stars were peeping, 
And the birds were in their nests; 
A 
pretty form beside me 
And a 
tiny hand in mine, 
The ,sweetest words were whispered 
When I 
ask'd if she be mine. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
beauty, she's divine! 
She's promised that she will be mine, 
Yes soon she'll be my little wife, 
This eve we'll fix the time, 
The joy I 
felt I 
can't express, 
Since she promised she'd be mine. 
SHE. 
I 
pr)mised that I 
would be here 
This eve at half past eight, 
My heart's been captivated, 
Yes, and love has seal'd my fate; 
For one that's all the world to me, 
I 
think he is divine 
Ask'd me last nig t 
if I'd be his, 
And I 
whispered I'll be thine.

He's a

RIDING in a 
street car the other day, 
Reading in the Herald to pass the time away, 
A 
darlin:.;. 
little creature dressed in latest style, 
Took the seat I 
offered her, and thanked me with a 
smile, 
Eyes of brightest lustre, hair of glossy hue, 
Form so fair and slender, and so graceful too; 
How my heart went pit pat, I 
shall ne'ver forget, 
And the dear emotion lingers with me yet. 
CHORUS. 
It was riding in the street car just the other day 
Some one that I 
saw there stole my heart away 
Handsome form and feature just the one for me 
And if our love is thutualthappy we shall be. 
She's the charming fair one coming down the street, 
I 
wonder if she'll know me when we chance to meet, 
How my heart is throbbing, tho' I 
must appear 
As if chance alone had made me linger here. 
Oh there's the charming fellow that stole my heart away, 
That gave me up his scat in the car the other day; 
How I 
wish he'd task me for to take a 
walk, 
it would be enchanting could I 
hear him talk. 
It was riding, etc. 
Darling little creature, pardon me, I 
pray, 
But won't you go a 
walking to pass the time away, 
Well, really sir, I 
thank you, I 
can hardly choose, 
Still you're so engaging I 
will not refuse. 
Won't it be so pleasant just to have a 
walk, 
Yes, and so delightful just to have a 
talk; 
I've a 
little secret to whisper in your ear, 
I'll agree to tressnre ev'ry word I

Never, Ali ! never again shall I

STANDING where the bleak winds whistled 
Round her small and fragile form; 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding. 
'Cept to jostle her aside 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She in tones of anguish cried— 
M:ster! Please give me a 
penny, 
For I've not got any Pa— 
Please, Sir, give me just one penny— 
I 
want to buy some bread for Mal"

As they bur:10(11y went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
Others cast a 
frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry; 
"I must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die." 
Mister! Please, Ito. 
There, one chilly day in winter, 
Barefoot sat upon the pave, 
Outstretcli'd were her little fingers, 
But no pennies did she crave— 
There, while begging bread for Mother, 
Death had chill'd her little heart. 
Yet each day we see some other 
Playing Little Barefoot's part.

THE LITTLE ISLE SO GREEN. 
Written, Composed and Sung, by CHARLEY RUDDY. 
Dedicated to his friend journis ROACH. 
There's a 
land across the ocean, that dear old country, 
Where all those Irish heroes were born, who fought and bled 
While fighting side by side, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green ; 
The land it is oppressed—by the English is distress'd, 
They tried to trample on that flag so green, 
But they never can do that, while there beats an Irish heart 
In the men that lived in that little Isle so green. 
In Ireland, to this day, you will hear the people say, 
They never will own allegiance to the Queen, but for liberty 
They cry, and they would surely the, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green. 
In every little village in that land so far away, 
You will find that little Shamrock so green, 
For they cannot transport that, as they did unto poor rat, 
And banish it from that little Isle so green. 
There was a 
noble man not many years ago, 
In Tipperary always to be seen, 
He rendered great his fame, for John Mitchell's a 
true son 
Of that little Isle so green. 
The English soon did know him they must o'erthrovr, 
Or else they'd lose that little Isle so green. 
So him they did transport, to a 
strange land sent him, 
And banished him from that little Isle so green.

Through eating pickled salmon 
Before I 
went to bed, 
A 
flight of wildest fancies 
Went booming thro' my head! 
The world seem'd topsy turvy, 
And people of renown, 
Were doing the most outrageous things! 
When the world turned upside down I 
The Pope was dressed as Harlequin, 
And danced a 
Highland Fling; 
Queen Victoria came from England, 
A 
comic song to sin:- ; 
Old Barnum acted Hamlet, 
And Booth was playing clown, 
And Bismark war an acrobat 
When the world turned upside down. 
Jay Gould he was a 
Quaker, 
And " bossed" a 
spelling match; 
Vanderbilt had a 
railway scheme 
He could'nt somehow hatch; 
1Ir. Tilton was an Emperor. 
And wore a 
golden crown, 
And Beecher danced the can-can 
\ihen the work._ Iurned unside, down. 
Brigham Young was a 
batchelor 
Who wished a 
wife to win; 
John Gough opened a " Sample room." 
And served out beer and gin; 
Old Tweed was at his island home, 
Dressed in a 
suit of brown; 
Ben Butler bad joined the Shakers 
When the world turned upside down. 
The shining Truth gleamed o'er the lead 
And Virtue--more or less ;— 
And womankind gave no more 
Thought to vanity or dress ; 
All husbands were like angels. 
Wives never wore a 
frown, 
Mid 11 S. Grant said, " No Third Term* 
Or the States are upside down." 
Brooklyn had changed into a 
sort 
Of Paradise on earth; 
'or it had some trials, 
And one heard no ribald. 
The people of this mighty globe 
Were all just what they seem; 
There was an end to air.ge and Jobs— 
When I 
woke, and—'twac a 
dreamt 
. 
Bright was the morn when he bade me " Good Bye l‘ 
Sad was the heart, with affection's fond sigh; 
Clasped was my form, in a 
lover's embrace, 
Cheered by the smile of a 
tear bedimmed face. 
" 
My ship sails to-night, with the sun in the West, 
I'll be far out at sea, when you are at rest; 
But Maud in your dreams fondly think of poor me, 
And pray for my safety across the blue sea." 
Morn came in its glory, its sun and its flowers, 
Reflecting the contrast of sad weary hours 
Passed in the darkness, the night and the gloom, 
When Richard, my lover, had left me at home. 
Days and weeks slowly passed, but no tidings of thee; 
No news of the ship—had she foundered at sea ? 
Was she wrecked on the main, and sunken the crew? 
And my Richard on board, is there no one who knows? 
Our letters arrived by the day Express line— 
No wreck on the road for the trains were on time; 
From Cousins and Aunts the post mark I 
see, 
But no tidings of Richard—no tidings of thee. 
With a 
sad weary heart I 
walk to the shore 
Where Richard and I 
have so oft strolled before; 
And ask of the waves that ran to the sea, 
To tell me of Richard, my darling, of thee. 
The waves had receded, the tide had gone out, 
There I 
stood on the sand with the sea-bird's shrill shOutr 
To remind me of sorrow, of darkness and gloom, 
When Richard, my lover, had left me at home. 
I 
read in the papers—(for it's all that I've heard)—. 
"Lost at Sea," was the Martha, on June 23d, 
In mid ocean was wrecked, from a 
high wind at sea; 
This only the tidings, the tidings of thee. 
Long weary hours since June, in my home; 
Have I 
pray'd, watch'd a-
2(1 waited, for Richard to corns ;, 
But something reminds me that never can be, 
For my sad heart is buried with Richard at Sea.

PULL DOWN THE BLIND. 
As Sung by TOI`Y PASTOR.7 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
.A fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying,whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind, 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
iiow loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
Srossx.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone,. 
late would never have exclaimed; 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
49 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
tind when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and - she 
said:

AS I 
was walking down the street, the other afternoon, 
Lit my cigar, put on my kids in front of a 
saloon. 
A '
vision floated past my sight, which caused the dust to fly, 
Twee the prettiest girl I 
ever saw was the girl that took my 
eye. 
CROBI7B. 
She is so fair, ( ntEAK.) 
I 
do declare, 
(BREAK.) 
I 
feel so queer whenever I'm near, 
That pretty little girl that took my eye. 
II 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame. 
She quickly waved her handkerchief, of course I 
did the same. 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side, your pardon, miss, said I, 
El I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but then you took my eye. 
She is so fair, ctc. 
I 
asked her 11 she would be mine, as we stood by the door, 
She said she had no objections,:but her parents they were poor. 
But trifles like that I 
must never mind, to win her I 
must try, 
And if I 
do, I'll introduce to you, the girl that took my eye. 
She is so fair, &a.

MOTHER SAYS I 
IVIUSN'T,' 
A 
NICE young man I 
once knew well, 
A 
few short years ago, 
lie courting came, in hail or rain, 
He vowed he loved me so. 
He'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time he was away; 
And when he'd ask a 
parting kiss, 
I 
always used to say: 
CHORUS. 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Oh, George, dear George, 
Not just yet awhile, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Oh, George, dear George, 
Not just yet. 
He waiting kept, at last one clay, 
He thought he'd know his fate, 
And sank upon his knees in quite 
An agonizing state. 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
, 
He longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
From then he went to work, indeed, 
lie left no stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed. 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased and so at last 
I 
lovingly did say: 
Srocen:—well, George, darling, as you have improved In 
circumstances since we last met, suppose you ask me agwin 
that question, eh, what say Georgie Porgey1 
Think of my 
surprise when he said, " You're very kind, but

PRETTY AS PICTURE. 
As sung by Mecum 
Jr WILSON. 
Oil! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just the cage, where the little birdi ate 
singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
Her darling face nas won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
An angel without wings. 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so slow, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's easky 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
8be fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you an-revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever you may nal 
- 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
k 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. \

Waiting, My Darting, for Thee.' 
Sung by MISS ADA WRAY. 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and Watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, ' • 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, ) 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day: 
Cuovos. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
Vor more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
SO 
surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
SO 
ru watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
• 
Has shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lilies, axe 
Written and composed by CHARLEY KONOLLMAN, the Pop-
'Aar Comique, and sung by him with great suocess. 
Ara —" Muleahey's Gone Away." 
Now please give me attention 
To what I 
now will say; 
And 
tell you of the by-words 
"Which are used now, every day. 
The young and old both use them, 
But the boys can say them best; 
And the latest one of them all 
Is, " Young Man, Pull Down your Vest." 
CHORUS. 
Now, no matter where you go, 
To North, South, East or West, 
You'll surely hear the latest one, 
Which is, " Pull Down Your Vest." 
The other day, while walking out, 
I 
stopp'd to light my pipe, 
When I 
heard some boys remark, 
The '• Bloat will never Bite ;" 
There one said to the other, 
Now take and do your best, 
For " Young Fellar you're too Fresh," 
Take and " Pull down your Vest !" 
Now, -no matter, Jr.e. 
Now I've got a 
second Cousin, 
He is tall and rather slim, 
He'll say to me, Old Fellar, 
Don't give me none of your " chin !" 
There's Mary Ann, my eldest daughter— 
The one that I 
love best— 
Since she has learned to " Tra La-La-Lou," 
She says, " Pull down your Vest !" 
Now, no matter, eke. 
Now, I'll bid you's all farewell! 
As I 
must be leaving you; 
And when you come another time, 
sing some more to you; 
And when you hear these by-words, 
You'll surely know the best; 
Then when your friends ask you to treat, 
You must say, " Pull down your Vest 1" 
Cnontrs. 
Now, no matter where you go, 
To North, South, East or West, 
You'll surely hear the latest one, 
'Which is, " Pull Down Your Vest 1" 
CEOSSLIG ON TITT1 FERRY. 
Oh! please don't laugh when I 
relate 
To you a 
story sweet, 
It's all about a 
charming girl, 
That I 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we net, 
Those lips so red and cherry, 
Oh! what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the Ferry. 
Chorus = Walking through the cabin, 
Passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, 
hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me, ' 
For I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear, 
Crossing on the Ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look, 
For she a 
magnet seem'd, 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beam'd, 
For ev'ry glance was like a 
lance, 
As ir my heart they'd bury, 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce knew how, 
While crossing on the Ferry. 
Walking through, 
Our journey's end at last arrived, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there 
My love among them passed, 
She turn'd her head and spoke to me, 
in a 
voice so soft and merry, 
Baying, " Write a 
note to Station I), 
Sign,' Crossing on the Ferry." 
Walking through, 8se. 
Little Maud. 
! 
where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
Oh! where is the voice on the stairway? 
Oh! where is the voice in the hall ? 
The little short step in the entry, 
The silvery laugh in the hall ? 
Oh! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
CHORUS. 
Little Maud, Little Maud I 
Oh! the daintiest darling of all— 
Little Maud, Little Maud! 
Ohl the daintiest darling of all? 
The peaches are ripe in the garden, 
The apricots ready to fall : 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall: 
Oh I 
where are the lips full of melting, 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabels over her head ? 
0 Maud, little Maud! say where are you ? 
She never replies to our call— 
Oh! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all? 
CHORUS. 
Fmre, thee well, then, dainty darling little Maud, fare 
thee well? 
Oh the daintiest darling of all— 
In heaven we shall meet thee, dearest darling little

Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, jest, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—"

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
•••••••~.~..." 
No one who has read the touching account ot the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy 'Ample. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizeslhe life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sine of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in

THE APPRENTICE, 
*x, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1871. 
/Jae author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a 
woik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced -into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
