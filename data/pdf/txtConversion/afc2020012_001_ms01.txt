AG: Thanks so much for joining these Library of Congress interviews. Andy, can I ask you to introduce 
yourself?  
 
AP: Sure. My name is Andrew Pratt. I'm a Maine native. And I've been a registered nurse since 1980. 
And I currently am living in a little coastal village-- a fishing village called Cutler, Maine, former site of 
a US Navy base, population about 460, and home of the VLF world submarine tower farm, for all the 
submarine communications in the world, right out my window. I hope-- I hope there's no health-- no 
health hazard involved [chuckles]. 
 
AG: Right [chuckles]. So you're living in Maine now? Where did you grow up?  
 
AP: I grew up in Maine, went to college at University of Maine at the main campus and did some 
research at the VA and started a graduate program. And I was working on the side in a 1,500 patient 
psychiatric hospital, which is still in existence in Augusta. And one day, we all got called into the office, 
there were probably 15 of us, we thought we're all gonna be given a pink slip. And the director of 
nursing said, "You're all college educated. How would you like to do your clinical at one of the two 
local nursing schools and the state'll pay for it?" So we all said, "Yes," and long story short, we 
completed our program. Everybody passed their boards. And like the military, we were supposed to pay 
back a year for a year. Mine was a three year program. When I went in to apply and fill out my 
paperwork, our governor at the time, the late James B Longley, had eliminated all kinds of state 
positions so there were no jobs. So I went out to the VA and within about an hour, I was signed up as a 
young graduate nurse in urology. And back then we had rotating eight hour shifts. And my career began 
in 1980 and I'm still practicing today. That's kind of the short version.  
 
AG: Yeah. Wow! What an incredible history. And do you remember for example, when you were 
growing up, did your parents work as well? Just to backup a little. 
 
AP: Yeah, my-- my-- my mother recently died after a long 90 year life. She-- we kept her at home under 
hospice care. She's college educated, worked as a civilian employee of the Navy, had four children. And 
in later life when all of us were out of school and on our own, she started being a substitute mail carrier 
on a rural route. And after her protege decided he wanted to retire, she decided to continue on as a full 
time carrier, which she did for another 20 years. My father was college educated, University of Maine. 
We are in the same fraternity. I was actually born when they were married and up at the University so I-- 
that we lived up over a store, and I was just two or three. He went to work for Libby Foods and then 
retired as an accounts manager for Procter and Gamble, and then continued doing things like going 
moose hunting and salmon fishing on Lake Ontario in my spot 'cause I had to work. And he lived a long 
healthy life 'til he died of pneumonia at 85 at the Medical Center in Bangor. So there were a total of four 
children: two nurses, a landscaper, and then my artist sister sadly died of ovarian cancer 11 years ago at 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

50. So it's been kind of a-- kind of a wild ride, but in our family, we tend to keep our relatives home and 
take care of them there and only go to the hospital as needed.  
 
[04:42] AG: I see. What subjects did you enjoy in elementary school, in middle school studying the 
most? 
 
AP: I would say the most memorable would be-- and it's kind of funny that our science teacher was a 
classmate at my father's at University of Maine, so he was an interesting guy. So, I was asked by my 
father, "Why don't you ask Sam if you guys can do dissections?" So this was in the eighth grade. So 
[chuckles] he said, "If anyone wants to bring in a specimen, we can dissect it and you guys can learn 
anatomy". Well, I-- he said, "Any roadkill is acceptable". Well I brought in a giant overweight raccoon 
that had probably laid beside the road for three days. Kind of an animal medical examiner case I had it 
in a-- I think it was in like the wood thing you carry firewood in, a little satchel. And I walked into the 
school and had it all wrapped up. And he said, "What do you got their partner?" And I said, "Well, it's 
for this afternoon's science class," and he just-- he said, "I know what I told ya". And so we-- that's how 
we started. So I would have to say chemistry and biology, and we were fortunate to have older teachers. 
My high school was public. My graduating class was just shy of 500, so not huge. So those were kind of 
the areas that, you know, got me kind of oriented toward health care, I think. My grandfather was a 
dentist. I used to go in his dental lab and watch him make dentures and play with the mercury on the-- 
on the little tray, which isn't used anymore. My other grandfather was chief finance officer at the VA 
hospital, where my mother grew up through high school and college with her three sisters. So we kind of 
have a connection with the VA, which is actually a federal territory beside Augusta, just like the one in 
DC and Virginia and so forth. Interestingly enough, the VA hospital has been totally renovated, and I 
had the fortunate experience of taking one of my private duty patients there. And when people found out 
that I'd worked there 35 years ago, I was able to say, "This cafe snack bar used to be the medical 
research lab. This used to be-- [chuckles] and I-- I really kind of felt old, but-- 'cause everyone I worked 
with had retired. And I was, you know, just kind of-- I was with the VA system between research and 
nursing in Maine and Boston, probably a total of eight years. And then from then on 'til today. 
 
AP: This is just a real quick thing, not to get sidetracked, but when I was working at the VA, as a young 
27, 28 year old nurse, I used to say to some of the older staff, "Wouldn't it be nice in Maine if a veteran 
in Cutler or Fort Kent, Maine would not have to drive five hours for medical care and they could go to 
their local hospital?" Well, 40 years later, guess what happens? If you need stent placements, you don't 
have to go and take a $2,500 ambulance ride to Boston. You can go 80 miles up to Bangor where they 
have a full cardiovascular center. So the point being, I now see many VA patients in our private practice 
where I work who love the fact that they can come in and have their blood drawn and then take their 
wife out for breakfast, not so much now during COVID, but instead of driving 100 miles to have a blood 
count and the chemistry done. And the VA has found, like I used to say, I wish I'd put that in the 
suggestion box. It's much cheaper for the government. And we relate back and forth with the VA 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

exchange records and so forth. And they've also improved their pharmacy over the past four decades so 
the patients get their meds by mail.  
 
[09:34] AG: Andy, you said that you started as a young nurse. What-- Was the VA your first job as a 
nurse? 
 
AP: The VA was my first job, and after a couple of years orienting at Togus, I-- I went there for two 
months as-- they called us GNTs - graduate nurse technicians. They still use that today. My boss was a 
classmate of my sister's in nursing school, who'd been a veteran of Vietnam and Desert Storm. Phil's 
now retired. And so I-- somebody said, "Did you know you can transfer anywhere in the country? You 
can go to Detroit. You can go to San Francisco". So I said, "Let's see what they have in Boston", since I 
had cousins and family in and around the city. So they had an opening for a charge nurse on the renal 
transplant unit, and also, one of your duties was going out with a procurement team. Now they drive 
$50,000 Suburbans when they go out, but back then we had a van with a lawn chair in the back, and I 
always rode in the front with a driver with a seatbelt on. But so you had to take call, maybe go to Rhode 
Island Hospital to get a kidney, go to Logan Airport. You know, we were always lugging coolers around 
and people were cracking jokes, saying they're headed to the beach at midnight. So that-- I did that for 
several years and then from there, I started doing a stint in ICU, emergency room. And again, I'll point 
out that when I was 18, I did what was then the basic, short version of the paramedic course. And I've 
since done the real paramedic course, you know, 10 years ago, but this one was just over a week and the 
auto extrication was done on the campus of Harvard. So that's when I was 18. And so I had always done 
ambulance work. I was a founder of the University of Maine volunteer ambulance squad, which is now 
celebrating its 45th anniversary. And that was kind of enjoyable. So, my leaning was psychiatry, ICU, 
emergency room and transport nursing. Because, for example, down here, transports are 100 miles, and 
if you have a critical patient, they like to have both a paramedic and a nurse. So-- So I just continued on 
and probably have done-- I've did a little OB, private duty, now working in a family practice/addiction 
practice, and then finishing up my Master's at AU, and my plan is to finish with a doctorate. My 
anthropology thing came about-- another sideline that I did for 20 years. I always had jobs during 
college and after on the side working for the chief medical examiner. And during college and post grad, 
the large medical center in Bangor employed for students to be pathology assistants. And when you 
became a senior, you passed your job on to a friend, man or woman, didn't matter. "Hey B, would you 
like to make call pay?" I think at the time we made $10 an hour and had a beeper, and so it was kind of 
nice. And typically on a weekend, Saturday and Sunday, we would do 10 or 15 autopsies 'cause it's a 
500-bed hospital. Also, we were helping the medical examiner's office. They would bring people in to 
the mortuary at the hospital to-- to do police exams and so forth. So that kind of have-- has always been 
an interest to me: exhumations and observing at crime scenes and collecting evidence in the late 70s, 
yeah. And it was essentially nights and weekends, although-- and during the day Monday through 
Friday, they had a-- a-- two guys that worked for the hospital that worked with the pathologists. And 
back then, we learned how to prepare slides for examination and I challenged the American Society of 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans

Clinical Pathology lab certification for histologic tech and also used to run the electron microscope at 
the VA research lab. So [chuckles] kinda-- kind of some nerdy but interesting things to do. We had two 
Philips electron microscopes donated to the VA from a larger VA, let's say in Michigan or San 
Francisco. They shipped them to us. And we used one for parts and the other one for-- for tissue exams. 
and I still have some of my micrographs from way back when. So yeah-- so that was kind of, you know, 
most people might work, you know, landscaping or in restaurants, and mine was kinda [chuckles] a little 
different. 
 
[15:43] AG: What were you majoring in at that time?  
 
AP: My college major was zoology and my minor was chemistry. 
 
AG: Do you remember when you decided to become a nurse? 
 
AP: Well, I had a lot of relatives and friends that were nurses and I think what happened was, I worked 
second shift at the psychiatric hospital. Now remember, this was after college, so when they looked at 
my transcript, the only formal class that I had to take, since it was a Catholic nursing school that's now 
closed. It closed in 1988. I had to take theology. But all my college courses, you know, I didn't have to 
take anatomy, I didn't have to take micro, I didn't have to take chemistry, so all I had to do is clinical. 
And basically, the old diploma schools utilize students as their staff. So we had 50 men and women in 
our class. It was a three year program. They were smart. So you went all through the summer. So what I 
used to do is, this is now having a Bachelor's Degree, I would go to work at the state hospital four to 12, 
and then maybe the next day, I had to switch my schedule but maybe the next two days, I would be 
working in the emergency room as a senior student. And [chuckles] ironically, I had three elderly aunts 
that lived five minutes from the hospital and they were all nurses, so I used to stay in their guest room. 
And then when I finished my clinical, I had it down to a science: I'd take the turnpike and I'd be at work 
in-- in about 45 minutes. So it worked pretty well.  
 
AG: And was there something about nursing and medicine in general that was appealing or interesting to 
you, as a science?  
 
AP: Well, I kind of-- at first there were a whole group of us. We all wanted to go to either medical 
school or dental school, and when I was in that process, they had a-- it's now called University of New 
England. They were starting what was known as the New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. 
That opened in 1980-- 1976. One of my good friends was accepted there, and he always kids with me 
'cause he just retired and we're the same age. He sold his practice to the hospital. So I knew it was 
something medical, and I guess the-- I guess it was almost by default, but yet there was an interest. And 
I knew a lot of the ER nurses at the hospital that we would go to, and the ambulance company that I 
worked for at the time has since been taken over by the hospital that runs a flight service in Lewiston.

But at the time, the ambulance company I worked for had a branch over there, so I was familiar with 
going to my own hospital and the competition as an employee. So I did that and-- and the medical 
examiner thing all through nursing school. And of course, if there was an interesting forensic case, I was 
told to go grab as many students as I could so they could come down and observe. It was optional, but 
they all came and got that experience. So I just-- I liked the versatility. The pay was unbelievably low 
back then. I think a lot of nurses started at like $10 an hour, and now union nurses-- I think the biggest 
overtime, non-union shift I did was on Christmas. And I was a travel nurse and the-- the boss lady said, 
"Well, I'd love to offer you Christmas, Andy, and I know your family always comes up two days later, 
but you're really too expensive to hire". So I went home, and the phone rang, and they said, "We've had 
three sick calls for Christmas". So I-- so I got double pay holiday pay and differential for 16 hours. I 
made $99.66 an hour, and they were crying all the way to the bank. Now if they'd a scheduled me within 
my 40 hours, they would have gotten, but I said, "Look, if-- if you want me to come in, I'll come in. And 
if you don't, I'll stay home". "Oh, no, no. We want you to come in". So -- And then as you get older and 
have your own children and now grandchildren, you tend to- at least my sister and I have always done 
this- we let the younger people have Christmas off to be with their family and then we would be the-- be 
the skeleton crew to work second shift or, you know, or you rotate each year. Okay, you had off 
Thanksgiving. This year, it's my turn. Usually, you can handle it within your own-- your own realm. 
 
[21:32] AG: Andy, can you talk a little bit more about the credentialing process to become an RN? 
 
AP: Sure. So-- Well, they kinda keep changing it or upgrading it. The-- we-- we do-- I think it was last 
year or the year before we had to go to a-- I think it's-- it's the one you go to for TSA precheck: 
[unintelligible; maybe: “Identaguide or Identify”]. And the woman said-- to do fingerprinting. So the 
woman sprayed this spray on what looked like a glass top printer, and I was like, "Oh, you mean we're 
not going to get all ink?" and you just put your fingers on. So you do prints. And then it's interesting, 
though, this is the one beef I've always had in Maine. In Maine, you don't have to have continuing 
education by the board, but you typically do by your employer. So I tried through the union to get some 
legislation to have mandatory continuing ed. An oil burner guy has to have 15 hours a year. A speech-- 
speech and language pathologist of which I have a friend that I grew up with. She told me a few years 
ago, they have to do 75 hours every other year. And our license cycle is two years. So it's-- it's really the 
application, the fee, your transcripts, your board scores. They added fingerprinting, and it's-- it's-- I 
mean, I don't want to minimize it-- that it's no big deal. I mean, I just did my renewal and it took like 
five minutes, and you just give them a credit card number and I'm all set 'til 2023. At the VA, however, 
they had-- and I know it's changed 'cause some of my friends are now there at the VA hospital I used to 
work at and another friend of mine is now out in Los Angeles working as an informatics nurse and also 
is moonlighting in one of the COVID ICUs-- basically references, transcripts, background information, 
now fingerprints. I think the gov-- I think when we did the government, it was the old style, getting ink 
all over your fingers. That would have been in the 70s and 80s. And-- and that's really it. I mean, they 
have the complaint process where if a patient thinks they're charged too much or they think you were 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
8 
 
rude to them. Most of the complaints are-- again, I don't mean to poopoo them but many of the 
complaints are able to be resolved, kind of between the party and the board and the licensee. I hope that 
kind of gives you an encapsulated-- Paramedic is the same way. You have to sit for a board exam, 
submit all your credentials, application, references. I hereby certify the information is true and correct to 
the best of my knowledge under the pains and penalties of perjury. And you send it in with a check and 
they review it. And it's either a yay or nay. The first application tends to be hardcopy, however, Maine 
just has had a big sweep of-- we do not accept printed applications anymore, so you have to download 
everything, your references, and it's-- it's so much easier. When you renew, the way you know that your 
credit card went through is the next day you get an email and you print your license off the printer, 
which is fine. I don't even know if I have my framed cardboard license from 1980. And then it says on 
it: First licensed: August-- August 27, 1980. And it has your license number. 
 
[26:03] AG: Andy, is it okay if we switch to talk a little more about your current work? Could you tell 
us a little bit more about where you work now? 
 
AP: Sure. I work at a private non-governmental practice, and I say that because we're surrounded by FQ 
HCs federal facilities. And it's called Door to Door Doctors. My boss is a physician who's practiced for 
26 years. And she's 10 years younger than me. She said she wouldn't mind if I said that. And 
interestingly enough, when I started doing the [unintelligible ] AU thing, she decided she was gonna go 
to law school. So she's now over halfway through at Maine Law School, having graduated from Yale 
Medical School and prior to that Brown, and then did her family practice residency in Oregon. She's got 
two boys that just got out of college. So, we see babies to elders, and we have a smaller group in our 
practice that we deal with Addiction Medicine. As a matter of fact, I was just at a-- a opioid group for 
some of our patients. And so we started off with working nine to five. So we essentially see patients, oh, 
let's-- let's say 20 to 25 hours a week and by emergency. So we do physicals, we do suturing, we fly 
people to the cardiac unit, they come in with a heart rate of 180. One week we had three ambulance 
trips, one ambulance trip in with a patient and two ambulance trips out, and the ambulance crew said 
you guys are gonna have to make one of those red signs that says Ambulance Entrance. So we-- you 
know, we have a handicap ramp, so the ambulance crew just came up the ramp and in the building. It's a 
great building. It's an old 1890s-- not really a sea captain's house, but it's a-- a three storey with a 
widow's view at the top and if you go up in the-- in the top where we always claim we were gonna go 
for lunch and we-- we just eat in the break room or the desk. You can look out and see the ocean and the 
lobster boats, so it is kind of-- kinda nice, but-- Private practice. We're certified and credentialed to give 
COVID vaccines but we can't get any vaccine. We were the first free standing practice in Maine and 
probably one of the first in the country that developed a drive-up COVID testing setup at the bottom of 
our ramp, so people would call, they'd drive in, we'd go out to them, take some basic information and 
then do their nasal swab for COVID tests, send it to the state lab. We're still doing that today. And of 
course, we are helping people find pharmacies, and I know COVID is probably to go on at the end but 
COVID's just one part of our-- our practice. We have an in-house pharmacy for non-controlled 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
9 
 
substances, so if somebody needed blood pressure meds, they're $5, and the pharmacists are fine with 
that and we have a little lab area and we use Quest Diagnostics in Boston. We have a courier pickup. As 
a matter of fact, I just got a text that the labs for today were picked up at 6:30, and they're winging their 
way to the-- to the holding area at the hospital and then they'll leave in the night for the main lab in 
Boston. worker's comp claims, we do DOT physicals. We do insurance, blood tests and urine tests and 
the little kits for someone who's going to get a half million dollar policy, you know that we do a urine 
drug screen. Tonight at our opioid support group, I randomly decided that everyone would do an 
[unintelligible] and drug screen and they're fine with that. They know that that's part of the program. So 
essentially, pediatrics, young adults, middle age and retirement age, and then we have one gal who's 93, 
and she calls up and just chats with me and she said, "Your-- are you doing your homework?" And I 
always say to her, "I probably should be but I'm not" [laughs]. So all ages-- all-- and we do a lot of 
referrals. Yesterday, we referred two patients for a mammography. We have two hospitals to choose 
from. Patient gets a choice. We refer people for echocardiograms, ultrasonography, x-rays of their knees 
because they're having pain, CAT scans, and MRIs. So we can connect anybody with anything that they 
need, not necessarily in our building, but within a stone's throw away.  
 
[31:58] AG: Andy, do you run the opioid group you mentioned? 
 
AP: Actually-- Actually, the-- the physician runs the group-- runs the group, and I check everybody in, 
document on them, do their testing, and they all have to do a screening. We now meet once a month. 
These people have progressed so well in the last two years that we went from weekly to twice a month 
to every three weeks, and then last year we-- before COVID, we said, "What would you guys think?" 
And we have women too. "What would you folks think if we went to monthly?" and every hand went 
up, and that's worked out really well. And they can call us any time and we do have 24 hour phone 
service. We are a very rural, poor county, population 34,000. If you look at per capita, and I think I'm 
saying this right, if you take our county size, which is-- I think it's 3,500 square mile-- is is that it's-- it's 
pretty much the whole side of Maine if you look at a map, but we are one of the highest-- We have one 
of the highest rates of opioid misuse and abuse in the country based on our population. For example, last 
year in Maine, we had almost 500 overdoses. I think I've got that right. Normally, it was running around 
300. A lot of misuse of heroin cut with fentanyl and sad situations. We've lost a couple of our patients in 
the last couple of months from overdoses. And so that's-- that's always a hard thing. It's just like when 
you work in the ER, you know that some people are going to come in from a car crash or heart attack 
and be okay, and others, despite a young age, may not be okay. 
 
AG: Did the COVID pandemic worsen the opioid overdose rates? 
 
AP: Well, that's been the talk out of the governor's office and the attorney general's office. I mean, I 
think that-- I think that does have a lot to do with it. So socioeconomic status, unemployment, and now 
there-- there are people down in our area that don't have any income whatsoever, I mean, other than

maybe a social security check. And, of course, patients will come in and say, "Well, Andy, do you think 
I'm gonna get that $1,400 check?' And I said, "Well, don't-- don't hold your breath this week". But it's 
really sad. I mean, I'm so fortunate, even though I'm "retired" and going to school, and I have my 
retirement plan and I draw Social Security, I can't even imagine what it would be like even as a student 
if I wasn't working doing something. I always joke and say the old rule "shop 'til you drop" is what 
happens in healthcare. A lot of my healthcare buddies my age do things like I'm doing. They kinda slow 
the pace down but still stay involved. You know, I do all my certifications and credentials for critical 
care, advanced cardiac life support, pediatric and neonatal resuscitation. I'm not-- Oh, I've had both. 
Yeah, so I think COVID has-- I think COVID has impacted people with alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and 
family violence. I've seen some of that. We had a-- it was this public information. It was in the 
newspaper, a gal who's had a history of opioid abuse in her late 20s, early 30s, left her little baby in the 
car overnight and the police found it at 25 degrees. And the baby's okay, in foster care, but the father of 
the baby, I guess, discovered the child and the mother didn't even know where the baby was. And she's, 
of course, now in jail. So that's-- I hate to say that, but that's kinda typical in rural-- rural Maine. I mean, 
not every day, but you-- you have the situations of-- involving controlled substances that are being 
misused, and coming in from out of state. 
 
[36:52] AG: Oh, gosh. Andy, can we ask you some follow up questions about the COVID pandemic?  
 
AP: Sure. 
 
AG: How did your typical day change with the COVID-19 outbreak? 
 
AP: So, the first thing we-- we kind of did is we sat down and said, "Okay". And Dr. London is good. 
She-- she goes the extra mile, you know, instead of getting-- and we got in on the ground floor. She 
actually, out of her own pocket, bought thousands of dollars of N95s and we sold 'em at no profit. The 
only thing the physicians on the other end had to pay was the US Postal Service postage. And we sent 
masks to New York, Wyoming. We sent 'em all over the country, and we still have plenty for the two of 
us. So the point is, we really stocked up and because we didn't know about a vaccine development and 
rollout, so-- so if you go up in our pharmacy area where the lock box is for the meds and the microwave, 
and all of our, you know, natural supplements, you'll-- you open the cupboards and you'll see isolation 
gowns, the low end isolation masks. So you're coming in, Lisa, for a flu shot and you come to the door 
and say, "Andy, my mask is out in the car," and you're like, over to the shopping center across from us. 
I'll say, "Well, come in. I'll give you a new one". And so we-- just like you see in Walmart or Family 
Dollar. So we got all kinds of those. And then we each got two, three respirators. I think I sent you a 
picture of me and a respirator. And that was when there wasn't-- we really didn't know where the shot 
situation was going to go. We had to both carpool together and go to Portland back in January. It was a 
six hour round trip to get our injections of the Moderna at a place called Intermed, which is a private 
medical clinic. I think they're-- they must be all over the country, because they've got all these beautiful 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
11 
 
offices in Portland, Maine, which is our largest city. It was very organized; in and out, about a half hour 
proposition. You made an appointment, and then we went back for vaccine two on February third. So-- 
so we were vaccinated. So again, back to your question, so if you were to come to our office randomly 
without an appointment, there'd be a sign on the door in red that says, "Stop. COVID-19 precautions". It 
has our phone number in gigantic letters. It's almost like a bulletin board in the natural food store, you 
know. You've gotta read about five signs but basically, you get the message: Hang on. You can't come 
in. The door's locked. Please call. 
 
[40:08] AP: So we did that, and we only allow one patient in the building at a time, and my dentist does 
a similar thing. I had my teeth cleaned two weeks ago and I had to wait in the chair kind of side-saddle 
until they were ready for me at the front desk to check out. So, we do a lot of that. Today, we had a 
patient arrive early. She was freezing out on the deck. I brought her in, the other patient was in a room. I 
put her in the second exam room and closed the door. So that's kind of our backup plan. So Lisa, you've 
got an appointment to have stitches removed. So, I've maybe checked in with you yesterday saying, 
"Now just remember, Lisa, if you come an hour early, don't stand on the porch, 'cause you'll freeze to 
death. If you want to go across the street and grab some groceries, great, just call me on your cell phone. 
And during the day, the business line goes to my cell phone which is in my pocket or my Apple Watch. 
So you'll say, "Hey, it's Lisa, I'm here. I know it's 10 minutes early". And I might say, "Well, you know 
what? The other patient's gone. Come on in," so that works really well. We used to see about 18 to 20 
patients a day, but now with both of our schooling and COVID, we've stopped doing weekends except 
for emergencies, and each day we have either a morning-- Friday is our all day day, so to speak. And 
then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I work around AU in the evening. I just have-- I live 30 
miles from the office, so I have to book out of there by 330, and then we just cluster six patients kind of 
an hour apart. The other thing that's different, we always did clean the rooms but we allow 15 minutes to 
terminally clean each room. And then at the end of the day, we really give 'em a once over. We use these 
wipes that are made by Clorox for hospital use, they're called Sure Kill, and we wipe down the exam 
table, the blood pressure cuff, the scales, the O2 sat. probe, the thermometer, the counters, the mouse, 
the computer, our telephones. So the place smells like a, you know, Lysol commercial. At the beginning, 
when you'd go to get a haircut or something, if you went into the bathroom and used the bathroom, 
they'd have to go in-- the hair salons had a rule that they had to sanitize the toilet each time it was used 
[chuckles], so that was-- we do ours all the time and so it's worked out well. Everybody has to have a 
mask on. The only time we let them drop their mask is to put the thermometer in their mouth. And that's 
an important bit of data to-- to check on. And again, the door is kept locked. We did have a lady come in 
and had COVID and she didn't have a mask on and she walked right in the building, hacking away. I 
don't know where she is now. She got mad 'cause we told her she had to put on a mask and so forth. So, 
I feel safe at the office and the patients feel safe coming in and we-- we explain it every time to every 
person. Even if somebody is coming in once a week to have a wound checked, we still do our little 
commercial about the building being locked, call us when you're outside so you don't freeze and we'll 
tell you when it's okay to come in. So, I would have to say scheduling one at a time is the big thing, 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
12 
 
locking the building, signage, outdoor testing and one at a time. If she's in with a patient, I tend to bring 
in another patient, close the door and get them all checked in so we can go room to room and while she's 
seeing the next one, I'm cleaning the room. There's just the two of us, so we do janitorial, billing, 
computer, etc. But it's-- it's working. I mean, hospitals are all doing about the same type of thing. 
 
[45:06] AG: You mentioned other hospitals. How do you think the pandemic has affected the VA 
hospital system? 
 
AP: Well, we have a lot of VA outpatients, and I always-- more out of curiosity, and also just to show 
continuity, or have interest in continuity with their care, I will say to them, "How are things going at the 
VA clinic in Bangor?". And the big thing that they're telling me, and I can see why this would be the 
case, they're having a little bit of a longer wait, so they enjoy getting the labs done with us and then we 
can have the labs waiting with the triage nurse. We have two clinics: one in Calais, which is way up the 
state on the Canadian border, and then we have the large one in Bangor, and then if you go 70 miles 
south, you go to where I used to work, which is Togus, the big VA hospital, and then they now are 
building a brand new VA clinic in Portland. So, 20 years ago, you didn't have all of these satellite 
clinics, but they have to have staff and the veterans need to get transportation. A lot of the VFW posts 
and Legion Halls have these nice 12 passenger vans and they'll make a run once a week to transport men 
and women to their appointments. So, I think the distance has shrunk, but the pandemic has put the 
squeeze on the amount of appointments they can see, just like the methadone clinic. The methadone 
clinic starts dosing at 5:30 in the morning and they typically close at two. Well, they-- you can't just 
bring people in, in line like at the movies like we used to do, and you have that turnover of the room. My 
dental office, I got there five minutes early and they didn't want me in there any sooner than that, you 
know. So, I would say the distance factor goes into staffing. And I think-- I think supposedly-- so in 
Maine right now we have 18,000 nurses thereabouts. I mean, theoretically, I'm supposed to be retired. 
I've had several friends retired, including my sister who's 65. She's been a trauma OR nurse at Rhode 
Island hospital. Now they're all bored, and a lot of 'em are coming back working at COVID clinics, 
working filling vacation, so they don't have the stress of working 40 hours. But the other thing in line 
with what you said about COVID, or you asked about COVID, the hospitals are having kind of a tough 
time recruiting and retaining staff that are not travelers. They would prefer to have-- When I came to 
Machias 10 years ago, I was employed by the hospital having just gotten off a travel assignment. I got to 
know a lot of nurses that had worked for the hospital and they were younger and single, and they'd go to 
Hawaii and work or California. And now what we're seeing in our local weekly newspaper, these tiny 
hospitals, one in Calais is in bankruptcy, and the hospital I used to work at which is only 25 beds is 
trying to buy the other 25-bed hospitals 60 miles up the coast. And then if you go 60 miles south, there's 
a hospital in Ellsworth, Maine, which is a different county. That's been bought up by what we call the 
mothership in Bangor: Eastern Maine Medical Center. And so they have all the services right at their 
fingertips. Again, staffing is a problem, recruitment and retention and retirement, and then the turnover 
of rooms or ER beds is slower because you can't just bring somebody in. We-- We tend to allow 30 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
13 
 
minutes of turnover per room even though I can do it quicker than that. But when we schedule, we 
schedule the patient for a half hour and then we have a half hour cushion. 
 
[50:01] AG: Are there any lessons from COVID-- the COVID response that you'd like to share? 
 
AP: Well, my significant research project is-- is underway now, and it's Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 
compared to COVID-19, what we learned and didn't learn. The big thing I noticed is that, back to the 
equipment. I mean, we bought laryngoscopes, five Ambu bags. We had, you know, everything for a 
natural disaster, which we still have ready to go: crash cart, defibrillator, monitoring. I don't think the 
hospitals were prepared. I still-- And I don't mean to-- to bash the CDC in Maine, but just take our 
practice as an example. We essentially said, "We are a small rural practice. We have the capacity in our 
freezer system. We have a laboratory grade, high-end freezer. We could store all the doses of Pfizer or 
Moderna, and now Johnson & Johnson, for the whole county". And I was saddened as I was commuting 
home listening to NPR to hear about all the places where 2,500 vaccines were ruined 'cause some 
workmen unplugged a refrigerator. And-- And the woman that was with some vaccine awareness group 
said, "If you didn't have any loss of vaccine, you'd kinda say, 'Well, hey, wait a minute. I can't believe 
that not any vaccine was wasted, lost or damaged'". Well, you only would expect that to be a couple 
hundred, not several thousand. So, we called the governor's office, we called the CDC, we filled out all 
these papers. "Congratulations. You are a certified vaccine administration site". And we were prepared 
to donate the syringes and the alcohol swabs and the Bandaids and the gloves. And we're all certified 
and we have been for several months. And when we called the state-- we've actually stopped calling, 
because we are now-- if you called up, "Please, sir," and said, "my grandmother is 70. What do I do? 
She's here with me for two months visiting at our camp in Maine," I would say, "You got a pencil?" and 
I would give you the number for a large immunization clinic that's held at the Cross Insurance Center in 
Bangor where they do 500 or so shots a day. And it's a special hotline. You can only call on Monday, 
but they might say, "Bring Gram in on Thursday". And that's what I actually did my observation for this 
last week's assignment. I watched 50 people in an hour or so. You can see how they work. They were 
really moving 'em through. Very organized, very-- just-- it was so impressive. The one we went to in 
Portland was a little-- like they had three people trying to check me in, and what they were doing is 
training people. Well, I would have said to the two training, "You just watch what I do for a while and 
then I'll let you-- you know. Don't stop and teach on-- on something like this. I can see if it's working on 
admitting a patient on the orthopedic ward but, you know, the COVID Clinic is roll up your sleeves and 
let this-- let's get this show on the road. So when we went back for the second shot, I noticed they had 
expanded the recovery area. So we are referring people to pharmacies and the larger clinics. Now they 
have to drive 90 miles each way but they're happy to do it, although you can't really do an adventure at 
the mall or a seafood restaurant during COVID-19, you know [chuckles]. What a lot of 'em do is just 
pack a lunch, they get their shot, take a few pictures and go home.

AG: Andy, was the testimony that you gave with Jean, was it about the COVID-19 pandemic or was that 
about workplace violence? 
 
AP: That was workplace violence. That was a few years ago, and they had nurses from all over the 
country. One was from San Quentin or Folsom Prison and her-- her colleague was killed on the job, and 
it was really quite an array of-- of violence. Mine was an assault in the emergency room. And the guy 
was threatening to go kill his former wife's relative or some such thing. So and we were even on C-
SPAN, so it was kind of-- it was an interesting experience. And it was right at the Labor-- Department of 
Labor. And then the committee that was tabulating the testimony, I guess there were a couple of people 
there from OSHA, but they tabulated the testimony and turned it over to OSHA. It's now a felony in 
Maine to spit on a nurse or an EMT or a cop or a fireman, you know, throw body fluids at them, any-- 
any-- any type of threat or whatever they-- the patient can be charged. It has helped a little. 
 
[56:09] AG: The story you recounted was something you experienced when you were working in the 
ER? 
 
AP: In the ER. Yep. I was-- I was-- Well, that was-- That involved-- That was kind of like a comedy of 
errors on behalf of the police. I-- There's one anatomical variation of the patient that I'll withhold 
because that might reveal who they were. But essentially, we had to-- the patient eloped after assaulting-
- well, he assaulted me outside. I just went out to see what direction he was going in, and I was actually 
reprimanded because I went out to see which way the patient went after he made threats to other staff. 
And he came up and punched me in the sternum. Luckily, I backed off a little so that broke the-- the 
impact. And about seven police officers caught him and they brought him into the emergency room 
before it had been renovated, and they hit him with pepper spray and it got sucked through the air 
system and everybody in the emergency room [chuckling] was impacted. So I had to do eye wash on 
him. And it was--" we just kind of said, "We hope that doesn't happen again". So he got arrested and 
then he went to court and it was like so many of the violent situations. There's a mental health piece. 
And as far as I know, there haven't been any problems since but, you know, people bring in weapons. I 
was a supervisor one night and I went in this room, and this is before the medical marijuana thing passed 
everywhere, and this guy had two visitors. He'd had a knee surgery, and they were all smoking weed 
[laughs] in the room with the door closed. And when I opened the door [laughs] I just said, "Woah, party 
time!" And I just said "You know, you really can't"-- What I said was, "This is a non-smoking facility". 
And they all were [mimics laughter]. But [laughs] that was-- that was on my-- my short list, I'll tell ya. 
So there-- there-- but it is-- it is risky. I mean, I've had some of the flight nurses tell about patients that 
have become combative on the flight, and that's why you always keep sedatives handy. And you can 
sedate people. We went through a stage when I was in the ER where we had four patients in one week 
that were dropped in the parking lot that were overdosed, and a couple weren't breathing, and we 
brought them back with Narcan. This is when Narcan was just coming into fashion to be with every 
police officer, school, just like the AED, you know, the defibrillators that they have posted in the 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
15 
 
airports and-- so it's a risk. I mean, you don't think of it when you go to work. You have your collegial 
support and medical staff but when an incident does happen, it hits close to home. I mean we've had 
people-- let's see, I had a guy come after me with a pair of scissors at the psych hospital, and I was alone 
on the forensic unit, which is a big no-no. Somebody went out to the switchboard to get our pizzas. So 
he's coming at me with a big pair of scissors. I don't know where he got them. And I had no choice but 
to turn a Co2 fire extinguisher on him. And that stopped him right in his tracks. He was okay. I got a 
[unintelligible; maybe 'writ'] for it in my folder, that I shouldn't have done that. But I said, "Well, when 
you're cornered like that". Then patients set their bed on fire deliberately. We had one situation when 
there was a fire in a hospital. It was one floor, and the way the ventilation system was the smoke went 
all through the whole hospital. And there were about 30 patients that had to be brought out, including 
people on ventilators, to the parking lot. The VA hospital before I went there in Boston in Jamaica Plain 
this came from-- this came from an Iwo Jima veteran that I worked with at the Maine VA. In the 60s in 
Boston, they were having a series of armored truck robberies. And in the old days, the Brinks truck or 
whatever truck it was would come to the VA and all the nurses and the staff would cash their checks in 
the payroll office. Now everything goes in automatically. Well, they had a robbery, which I believe is 
still unsolved, that these guys went into the VA hospital with machine guns and robbed the payroll 
office right after they had dropped off-- probably then it was maybe 10 or 20,000. But that was always 
the thing they told you in orientation: "We prefer that you have auto deposit for your check, and here's 
why" [chuckles]. So I always remember that story. But yeah, and the VA in Boston was 13 floors and 
had a transplant unit, all specialties. They were a Tufts teaching hospital. And boy, I'll tell you now, 
everything's combined in Boston. In the old days you had the two VA hospitals. And now a veteran can 
go to Mass General if they want. I mean, they just have to clear it with the scheduler. But they'll say, 
"You know, I've known this doctor all my life and he took care of me when I had ulcers," and they'll say, 
"that's fine. Go to him". That's helping with the COVID backlog and the VA system, especially the 
outpatient setting. 
 
[1:02:58] AG: What do you see as your role as a nurse in working with patients? 
 
AP: Well, I've kind of gone in the direction of patient care management and education. I mean, we're not 
sure-- we kind of have a joke in the office: Are we gonna have to make another sign that says, "Are you 
here to see the doctor, the lawyer or the anthropologist?" [laughs]. And-- I mean, we're just kind of 
enjoying what we're doing. And-- and I hate to say "at my age" but I'm just gonna take it a month at a 
time. We just had a brand new family move here from out of state and their little one has an ear infection 
so they're gonna bring-- bring the baby in. She may see them tomorrow. We've enjoyed-- and by the 
way, the name Door to Door Doctors started when she was renovating the office, which took about six 
or eight months, she saw patients door to door, and that's how I met her in the ER. And I had a patient 
call and he insisted that Dr. London had an office, and I said, "She owns a building but it won't be ready 
for occupancy for six months". And finally he believed me and we ended up, you know, seeing him-- 
she ended up seeing him at home. We don't do house calls unless it's someone that dies at home or needs 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
16 
 
meds or a shut-in. So I would have to say total patient care. Obviously, the practice will probably shrink 
a little just from, you know. We're not out actively soliciting to build a patient base. We could end up 
maybe bringing in somebody else to take over. I mean, it's a nice little practice. We've got about 2,000 
patients. They all don't come in the same week, you know. We might see one-- one gal every six months 
or that type of thing, or one gentleman or one college student when they're home for the summer. I-- I 
guess, and as far as anthropology, I have done some teaching in the past when I was younger, teach, 
consult. I'm-- I'm just having a good time. 
 
[1:05:34] AG: What services, if any, do you think the VA could provide to [unintelligible; maybe: "that 
trend"]? 
 
AP: Well, I think the big thing, if you take your home area or really any state, the post-World War II 
surge of VA hospitals tended to center around the larger [unintelligible]. I got to meet and chat several 
times with Richard Hooker, who wrote M*A*S*H., who lived right down in Bremen Maine near-- near 
the VA. I mean, he was--- he was on staff for years. And I think when I was there he was just doing per 
diem. And then I remember reading, you know, that he had died, but it was so great to-- to meet him. 
And there was a show that came out called After M*A*S*H, and if you can ever see those old episodes, 
it is the most accurate portrayal of how the VA was in the 60s and the 70s. And even my grandfather 
used to shake his head as the chief finance officer. And to think that we used to talk about, "How can we 
make it so these guys don't have to drive five hours from northern Maine just to have their blood 
pressure checked?" So in answer to your question, continuing to facilitate and allow patients to see the 
specialist of their choice at the location of their choice. Maybe up the transportation ante or maybe give 
a family member a nominal mileage fee to drive their relative or friend, and expand the clinics. I think-- 
I almost think now in Maine, in the next year we're gonna have five or six clinics. I was gonna research 
that. I know right now, of course, there's the one of the main hospital. There's Bangor, Calais, Portland. I 
just drove by there when I was visiting my son and grandson. It's a beautiful building right on the ocean, 
all state of the art. The VA hospital itself, as I told you, has fully been refurbished in-- over the last 15 
years. And the med accessibility piece, major surgeries. Don't haul a person two states away from his 80 
year old wife. Let him go to a nearby comparable facility. And the VA is now sending cardiac patients 
to our Cardiac Center. They will say to the patient, "Now, you can have this procedure done 20 miles 
from your house versus going to West Roxbury". And that's now evolved into pretty much the standard 
operating procedure. They almost recommend a closer trip. And if the patient says, "Well, I had Dr. So 
and So in Boston. I think I'm okay to go there and my daughter lives in the suburbs". Again, COVID 
jumps in everywhere, you know, we [chuckles]-- This'll be our second season where we won't have a 
live nurses' convention where we raise money at an auction for scholarships. Oh, and the other thing the 
VA did, they've-- my friend Kathleen told me who's an informatics nurse. I can't remember which 
electronic medical record they use, but everything's linked. So if you're in Ann Arbor and you end up at 
Jamaica Plain in Boston, they can go right in and look at your Ann Arbor chart, almost like the private 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
17 
 
hospitals have. You know, you-- you have to be-- like when I see my routine guys in Boston, I can go in 
and pay my bill or look at my labs and so forth. But the VA has come a long way. I will say that. 
 
AG: Thank you so much, Andy. This has been wonderful. Is there anything you'd like to add before we 
wrap up? 
 
[1:09:58] AP: The only thing that would tie in with-- if it's okay to just mention a few things about the 
union. In Maine right now it's kind of exciting that Maine Medical Center, which is a 585-bed hospital, 
one of the largest in the northeast, is going to be doing mail-in ballots at the end of March for them to 
unionize in NNU. And that's kind of exciting. My union activity continues in NNU. Since we are not a 
union shop and I'm the only nurse, I belong to NNU, and I'm the vice chair of the Maine State Nurses' 
Board. And membership-- we have about 2,000 members. And just to talk about a few quick actions, we 
call 'em actions not riots or protests. We had a visible showing at Senator Collin's office to suggest that 
she not vote for Amy Coney Barrett and Brent Cavanaugh, and we did a die-in in Las Vegas on the strip 
during the Ebola crisis. 1,000 nurses laid down at high noon and we went around and traced chalk lines 
around them on the sidewalk. And a police lieutenant said, "I've worked on the Las Vegas Police Force 
for 30 years and you guys are the best group of protesters [chuckles] we'd ever seen". And what else 
have we done? Oh, I got to-- I don't know how I got roped into it. We had a-- we have a gathering in 
Portland, our largest city, in Longfellow Square. And in the NNU magazine, I tried to find one and I just 
was too busy. I ended up standing up on this stage and there were several of us that spoke on Medicare 
for all, a single payer-- single payer health care. And I think-- oh, I'll think of-- but we-- we try to do a 
lot of actions or visible-- visible programs. So that's-- that's it in a nutshell. I enjoy the union piece and I 
look forward to continuing with the scholarship program with my committee and the silent auction. 
 
AG: Wonderful. Thank you so much for your time Andy.  
 
AP: Thank you for having me.
