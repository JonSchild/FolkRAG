Na Wai Eā, The Freed Waters 
       A Story of the People 
of Ko`olau Moku, Maui Hikina 
 
1. Mahi`ai Kalo, Taro Farmer 
 
All his life loving earth  
 
a living harrow waist deep in mud  
planting tilling trenching shoveling plowing  
 
mud to field, gravel to path, stones to bank  
yoked no less than animal to plow 
 
a year of this then huki `ai, harvest 
shouldering the heavy bags 
 
heaving lifting hauling slogging 
through acres of taro fields  
 
ancient footpaths fragile `auwai wetlands 
swollen feet hands torqued elbows knees 
 
pestilences infestations droughts 
year after year, year after year   
 
for love of family love of ancestors  
love of the Elder Brother 
 
for love of Hāloa. 
 
2. Lo`i Kalo, Taro Fields 
 
As far as eye could see their green hearts  
 
were laid bare under rains  
that never ceased falling a much aggrieved sun 
 
the dim glint of it through upstart clouds 
but always the rains and he was glad for the gods' 
 
beneficence and the harbingers who coaxed 
sunlight's bright threads the `auku`u herons hovering  
 
then ensconced in pools 
of watery green expanse their emanations of light 
 
vectoring the same paths trod 
the same earth the same ancient waterways  
 
the ancestors walked he regarded the plants 
hungrily the same green ones whose presentiments 
 
were his Elder Brother Hāloanakalaukapalili 
vivified who was born of the gods 
 
Wākea and Ho`ohōkūokalani their union 
a conflagration of heaven and brightening stars 
 
their firstborn, the Elder Brother  
stillborn buried Ho`ohōkūokalani's tears unceasing 
  
until the quickening  
shimmer of green in graven earth 
 
the unfurling leaves 
and the risen Hāloanakalaukapalili 
 
progenitor  
his offspring the stalwart green-hearted ones  
 
who followed growing up  
out of the same earth again and again 
 
he called them koa, warriors  
as they hoisted their green banners  
 
forming leaf arbors under sun's radiance  
their stems rooted deep their arbors 
 
protecting parents, grandparents, the corm, mākua 
protecting children grandchildren,`ohā, the offshoots  
 
succouring cradling them 
millennia of generations turning returning 
 
e huli, e huli, e huli ho`i,  the ancestors called 
their names auspicious names naming 
 
their offspring in dreams  
through keen observations 
 
ho`ailona, signs  
close attentions to minutiae of corm 
 
stem petiole rhizome  
shimmering sun wind 
 
sea clouds and earth  
cradle of the hallowed ancestors 
 
and the risen Hāloa   
give us the right names the mākua prayed 
 
dispatched their entreaties released them 
mana ulu, mana `ōpelu, mana weo,  
 
mana uliuli, mana `ula`ula, moi, piko, 
lehua, ha`akea, hapa hapapū  
 
were names given 
and many more all his life 
 
 he knew and never forgot 
their names  
 
sacred from the first 
they were the names of the generations  
 
of his Elder Brother 
they were the names of his family  
 
they were the names of kalo. 
 
3. Maka`ala, Be Vigilant 
 
 
Elena his grandmother James and Samson  
 
the grandfathers who brought him to the gods  
he followed along the ancient paths  
 
of well-tended fields 
the rows of plants who were offshoots 
 
of his Elder Brother green sentinels  
as far as eye could see  
 
he sloshed through the maze of waterways 
the irreproachable fretwork of ancestors  
 
arrayed he heard  
their songs prayers incantations 
 
traceries of winds waters ocean 
he heard Pahulena the grandmother's birthplace 
 
she said her birthplace name  
and motioned toward a dense growth  
 
of  `ōlena and the tall stand of niu 
where `ehukai breezes warmed  
 
the wide river mouth churning 
above reddish brown sheen of seaweed limu kohu 
 
spawning place of  āholehole, moi, `anae, 
pāpio, `o`opu, hīhīwai, po`opa`a 
 
`opihi, wana, hā`uke`uke, `a`ama 
he remembered stories fishing canoes divers their nets  
 
the surround of akule, halalū, mishaps at sea 
the kilo i`a, fish spotter's lair high above the kāheka  
 
the first catch offered there at the ahu 
he remembered his grandmother's warning 
 
maka`ala and that after the bosses came  
aia nō iā ha`i nā `āina o mākou she said 
 
other men have our lands 
then her words went dry 
 
and Pahulena was no more. 
 
4. Waimaka, Tears    
 
There are hidden places  
 
where the high waters fall 
in rainbowed silence 
 
sucked in through igneous stone  
pulsing the columnar dikes 
 
of earth’s vast waterworks 
spilling over soul’s sacred edge 
 
Elena's tears Elena's tears. 
 
5.  Na`aupō, Ones Devoid of Light 
 
From sea dregs the onslaught winds  
 
its shifting stars, the detritus tides 
carry dark strangers 
 
under cover of night 
stealthy ones of fervent prayers 
 
and exhortations Holy Father 
bring us safely to the village 
 
Pahulena in the distance 
grant us safe conduct 
 
in our sacred mission 
to save the unbelievers 
 
for Your greater glory  
Amen. 
 
he malihini lākou no ka `āina ē 
ka `āina huna wai no Kāne 
 
strangers they come 
to this land of hidden waters  
 
belonging to Kāne 
ghosts grey as gunmetal 
 
intractable as cannons 
sulphurous gunpowder flashes  
 
their lodestars 
at artillery's first report 
 
the stalwart sons and daughters of Hāloa  
rout the shadowy ones  
 
but from dregs of darkness  
there is no surcease 
 
wave upon unending wave 
 
commend ravening spirits  
 
to the tasks set before them 
conversions appropriations  
 
decimations subjugations 
as has been foretold  
 
in their writs 
they look upon Hāloa's people 
 
as pitiable idolaters unclean ones 
who must be brought to the One God 
 
and called to atone 
from the lost souls' darkness withal  
 
a Savior shall lead them  
their dark paths made light 
 
the Savior's blood sacrifice  
upon Golgotha's mouldering cross 
 
their lamp of redemption 
na`aupō look with dismay 
 
upon the god Lono's handiwork 
his raft of green mountains 
 
his canopies of forest  
they judge these iniquity 
 
evil fruit of indolence 
an affront and mortification  
 
to industry 
they are disdainful  
 
of Kāne, his Living Waters  
flowering to sea 
 
abased are the natives 
of this extravagant land 
 
upon their stolid ramparts  
na`aupō recite oaths  
 
their kingdom come 
their will be done 
 
they issue the edicts 
dispatch the cadres 
 
to bulldoze the lands  
build fantastic scaffolding  
 
engineering marvels, masterworks 
for excavation of the high mountains  
 
extraction of waters 
to bring the vile gods low 
 
to siphon off the lifeblood 
from the green realms  
 
of the Elder Brother 
the brooding altars are abandoned  
 
the disconsolate moon holds no sway 
as the waters are wastreled 
 
the fate of an unrighteous people 
turned in dark hands 
 
through a marvel of gravity flow 
the waters are extricated 
 
ho`ohemahema, i `ō i `ane`i  
dug here, trenched there 
 
tunneled here, siphoned there 
the uplands turned into wallows  
 
`inu ihu pua`a 
for dirty snouted pigs 
 
loosed upon the land 
rooting here looting there 
 
through gross machinations 
the sacred is harried in ungodly ways 
 
ditches pipes channels  
tunnels siphons flumes 
 
aqueducts intakes funnels 
dark grasping hands 
 
leering lewd imaginings 
broad hillsides of waving cane 
 
the far distant and arid plains 
prolific with cane tassels under brightening sun 
 
all of this has been foretold 
all has been readied, all paths cleared 
 
the export tariffs have been lifted 
foreign labor contracts signed 
 
the people's protestations -- 
the devil take them! 
 
the necessary approvals have been given 
government officials are aboard 
 
the false idols Kū, Kāne, Lono,  
Kānaloa a me mau  
 
banished to the greater glory  
of Almighty God! 
 
 
6.  The Fisher of Men 
 
From high promontories 
 
elevated stations of the cross 
the bosses offer prayers 
 
for the blessing of verdant lands 
mahi`ai in the fields 
 
lawai`a at the nets 
and there are remembrances 
 
vague recollections  
of One Other 
 
a Fisher of Men who once led them   
who fed multitudes 
 
with few fish and loaves 
the bosses remonstrate with themselves 
 
as the tableau of kua`āina 
unfolds in the lowlands  
 
a childlike people easily duped 
to be cajoled lured away  
 
or forcibly removed 
from the greening hills 
 
what do they know these unwitting 
of the true faith, divine purpose 
 
the higher reckonings 
of true believers 
 
little do they know 
of theft treachery genocide  
 
deception stealth coercion  
the idolators must be readied 
 
for the benefactions of civilization 
na`aupō are filled with saccharine thoughts 
 
of panoramic cane 
the lands' expeditious acquisition  
 
a foregone conclusion 
the unrighteous ones' swift conversion  
 
to a penitent upright people 
the gift of civilization 
 
a bargain more than fair 
promised by the One God  
 
who from the time of Adam 
conferred to His true believers 
 
dominion over the world 
these truths being self-evident 
 
the bosses are feverish 
with thoughts of unholy war  
 
upon nā kua`āina the people, their gods.

8. Ko`olau, The Windward Cliffs  
 
All night  
 
and for endless days like ghost canoes 
at full sail under brightening moon 
 
the billowing `Ī`ale`ale winds sweep across 
Ko`olau mountain seacliffs 
 
over razor edged ridges valleys  
with thunderous bursts exhalations  
 
obscurations of light 
the spectral crew worrying each blade leaf 
 
branch with roaring cascades waterfalls 
avalanches rockslides incessant rains  
 
it is the season of ho`oilo 
ho`īloli ke kai, the sea rages 
 
the god Kanaloa furious his seamounts shaking 
he hurls himself against seacliffs 
 
sending `a`ama scuttling over the reefs  
shoals corals the staid seaweed 
 
limu wawai`iole, limu manauea, limu `ele`ele,  
limu kohu, limu huluhuluwaena 
 
their swaying frondescences under frothy waves  
in the uplands kalo  
 
revel in watery pools 
rainbows bead on the leaf-green  
 
arbors of scintillate light 
refractions mirrored prisms riven  
 
by Kane-i-ka-Wai-Ola 
Kāne takes the form of a night owl 
 
he thrusts his wings and talons 
disarming his enemies 
 
Kāne god of the living waters 
walks abroad with Lono 
 
scion of water, scion of land together  
summoning forth the sacred springs Oiana!  
 
waters gush forth out of earth  
the living waters of Kāne coursing to sea.
