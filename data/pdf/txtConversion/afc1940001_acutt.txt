A*CUTTING DOWN THE PINECome all you good old shanty boys, come listen to my song;For it's all
about the shanty men and the way they get along,For a jollier crew of fellows you will seldom ever
find,To spend the winter pleasantly a-cutting down the pine!There's farmers and there's sailors,
likewisemechanics too;It takes all sorts of tradesmen to make up a lumbering crew.The choppers
and the sawyers, they lay the timber lowWhile the swampers and the skidders are a-hollering to
and fro.On a cold and frosty morning they shiver with the cold;There's ice upon their [jam p ike?] so
they can scarcely hold.The axe and saw do loudly ring until the sun goes done;Then crack the whip,
the teamsters yell, for the shanty we are bound.When once we're at the shanty, the splashing does
begin:There s the rattle of the waterpail, the banging of the tin.The boots, the packs and rubbers are
all laid to one side,While mittens, socks and mackinaws are all hung up and dried."Now hurry up, you
fellers, come Jim, come Jack, come Joe;It's one of you must take the pail and for some water go."The
cook he hollers "Supper!" and nobody starts slow:It's not the style of a shanty boy to miss his hash,
you know! [??????] Then supper being over and no more work to do,There a songs is done and jigs is
done and smoke till all is blue.It's early the next morning, the foreman loudly shouts:"Hey there all
you teamsters, it's time that you were out!"The teamsters they get up, all in a fretful way: [?] S ays
one: "I've lost my boot-packs and my socks is goneastray!"The choppers next get up and it's socks
they cannot find,They lay it to the teamsters and they curse them in their mind.One says: "I've lost
my socks [md] I don't know what to do."Another's lost his mackinaw and he is-ruined too."It's time
that [?] you are out, boys" the foreman he will say,So they put on coats and mittens, to the woods
they haste away,Another day in the pine woods, all winter they'll remain,A waiting for the springtime,
a-cutting down the pine.
(The last stanza is a composite and did [not?] satisfy anybody; but the other stanzas sounded about
right.)
