INSTRUCTIONS 
8 
This form provides a 
convenient means of passing resolutions by a 
corporation's Board of Directors for establishing and 
maintaining checking and borrowing accounts with us. 
It is suggested that in designating authorized signatures, the authority to sign checks, drafts, notes, etc. be given to the 
designees as corporate officers and not to the named persons acting as such officers. 
For example, 
such authority should be given to the President or Treasurer of the corporation rather than to John Smith, 
President, 
or Frank Brown, 
Treasurer. Of course, 
names must appear alone where the designated individual have no official 
status (title). 
Thereafter, 
if there is a 
change in incumbency involving no change in signing authority, delivery of a 
certificate of incum-
bency (notification to the bank of the names of the new officers, over the certificate of the Secretary, 
with the corporate seal 
impressed ) 
is sufficient. 
It is advisable to avoid designations that are susceptible of varying interpretations— signing authority should be clearly stated. 
Some possible combinations for inseFtion in the hlank•paces_in paragraphs l• } and 4 
are as follows: 
President, or Vice President or Treasurer 
7 
President alone, or any Vice President when also signed by either the Treasurer or the Secretary 
Any one of the following—President, Vice President, 
Treasurer 
Any two of the following— President, 
Vice President, Treasurer, 
Secretary 
Any one of the following—President, Vice President, Treasurer, together with any one of the 
following—Secretary, 
or John Smith, or Wm. Brown. 
It is emphasized that the above are merely illustrative examples. Naturally any designation to fit your needs is satisfactory 
to us providing it is clearly stated to avoid confusion. 
It is also emphasized that designations may properly differ in paragraphs 1, 3 
and 4. For example, you may wish to authorize 
one signature only for checks drawn against your account, 
but require more than one signature for borrowings. 
This form may be used to designate authority to sign checks (paragraph 1) or to borrow (paragraph 3) or discount obliga-
tions ( paragraph 4), or any one or more, depending upon your needs. 
In the interest of simplification of your files and ours, it 
is helpful to include all signing authorities in one set of resolutions.
