Antiquing with Indians 
 
 
First it was the tumblers for highballs— 
cocktail hour with primitives, 
the kind your grandma used to wear her red dress for. 
 
$30 seemed too steep, even for a stereotype, 
even for bones, perfect and white, snapped through  
afros, pierced through noses, prehistoric as flint. 
 
Still you wanted them, even if you don’t drink 
anymore.  Then it was the Battle of Little Bighorn 
board game, replete with war-bonneted Sioux 
 
and Cheyenne, action figures on horseback; 
plastic Gatling guns and cannons,  
tomahawks and war shields galore. 
 
But you’re above all that.  Except for the beaded Indian 
doll, the pin cushion with a wrist clasp— 
you want to be that Indian wearing the Indian 
 
like a Russian doll, you want to uncover 
and uncover, go undercover and pin yourself 
back to completion again; buy the beaded skirt 
 
for those days when Voodoo seems a viable option 
(you know the ones).  Just as we’d brisked  
through the door, the real-life doll version 
 
of Pocahontas and John Smith (what a pair!) 
a voice from the back called out…squaw man . . .  
later we found the 1906 novel the voice was referring. 
 
Don’t you want to be more than a metaphor?   
That’s the beauty of it, that’s the trick, 
 you think ironies are free, but they’re not. 
 
 
 
 
 
Latona mentioned how she’d discovered 
a Tonto doll, stoic and monosyllabic, 
seated next to a Custer puppet 
 
which had so unnerved her she felt it her duty 
 to relocate Tonto to a more auspicious corner— 
someplace safe next to doilies or Fiestaware. 
 
What wars might emerge from such proximity 
she’d wondered.  What skirmishes could result? 
I imagined the Iroquois Brave 
 
brandished on the alfalfa seed cloth sack 
could overtake the Yakama Squaw Apple box 
succeed his throne beyond the Calumet Baking Powder’s 
 
proud profile.  Don’t mess with vintage 
the collections seemed to warn.  If you think 
this is Toy Story, you got another thing coming.
