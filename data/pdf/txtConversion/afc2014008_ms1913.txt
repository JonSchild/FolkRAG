Dear Al
 
Among the  arious kinds of mischief I
've been getting into during m

abbatica1, I have finally found time to redo the lullaby paper I wr
 
while I was up in Berkeley, and I am about to take a f
lyer and send
 
to Barry Toelken.  If it proves too specialized and "iffy" for JAF,
 
I
'll try SPQ next.  Anyway, I wanted to get permission from you to ct
 
the lullaby materials I found in the Berkeley archives in sinnary

The problem of genre identification and description has been much
 
discussed by folklorists in recent years.  I
t is probably ultimately un-
solvable but -
-
 as in the fairy tales -
-
 the quest is l
ikely the most
 
interesting part of the story, for it leads one into intellectual con-
frontations with anomalies that one would otherwise probably avoid.
 
A few years ago, hearing of my interest in childrens' song, a young
 
woman in her late twenties introduced herself to me and said that she had
 
been brought up in Chicago and that her mother, a young widow, had sung
 
her to s
leep every night with the s
ame song.  And then, with the most
 
extraordinary mixture of emotions on her face = =  half genuine sentimental
 
reverie, half embarrassed amusement -

 she sang me what she herself
 
identified as a ?

f

of putting a baby to s

What I am concerned with in this paper, then, is an examination of
 
t
i
 r
:r s governing the ra t
her bizarre congregation of items
 
t
 I
ts seem to choose to fulfill the function of getting a
 
young child or infant ready to go to s
leep.  I do not pretend that the
 
examination is exhaustive or conclusive, and I will concentrate mainly on
 
problems of text; but there are at least three stylistic qualifiers which
 
I feel must be briefly mentioned.
 
One is rhythm.  American parents seem to rely heavily on a straight-
forward, non-complex, swaying meter, normally 4/4, to produce a suitable
 
quieting effect.  Lest this be dismissed as a pan-human trait, I might
 
mention that A
.M. Jones describes a method of soothing s
leepless babi
 
used by the Ewe people of West Africa, which relies on a complex and
 
syncopated zhythm.  Clearly, Ewe parents can no more stand a crying baby
 
than can their American cousins; the mother takes the baby's hands and
 
the father his feet and they swing him between them, hammock fashion, in
 
slow wide arc, with a pause at the top of every third swing.  The moveme
 
is performed in what may be roughly described as duple meter; the
 anyi'
 
panying song i
s essentially in 3/4; when combined with the pause, 1
 
overall effect is of extreme syncopation.  I have never

l
east, he  ou1d be s
timulated, rather than soothed, by such actions.

in other parts of the world.  Each lullaby has a
 
refrain consisting of a characteristic set of syi
 
bles.  In recording scores of lullabies, I observed
 
that the effect of lullabies on the child was to put
 
it to sleep even when the singing took place during
 
a recording session in the presence of the entire
 
village.  There was a marked change from northern t
 
southern Spain in terms of the vowel set composing
 
c lullaby refrain, and it occurred to me that per
 
ps vowel preferences were implanted by mothers in

A final stylistic qualifier has to do with the fact that singing
 
stems from a larger pattern of social intercourse.  A song is a communica-
tive act and has some degree of f
it with the overall communicative s
tyle
 
of the society.  Thfacpntnt can be examined by turning to some comparative
 
data, specifically, to a cross-cultural study which details the results
 
of an intensive examination of the interactional patterns between Japanese
 
mothers and their infants below the age of four months, as contrasted with

 a really striking disproportion.
 
Further, in terms of the interaction between mother and child, there
 
is a strong correlation between the American infant's "happy vocalizing"
 
and the American mother's "chatting", a relationship which does not appear

content of the l

 Lullabies, according to Miss

may be elaborated by a placid description of what the
 
rest of the household is doing.  Father has gone hunt-

The peacefulness of the surroundings may be described; the safety of the

material admiration of the child or "a prophecy of his glorious future" may
 
be expressed.  Some lullabies includ.

Here, again, some of the data developed in the cross cu 1t

seem to spend almost the same amount of time in care-takinr
 
when their babies are awake.  During the hours of sleep, howEv r, t
-

Japanese  mother tends to continue her care-taking at a leisurely page, and
 
thus she scores high in such factors as rocking, carrying and holding te
 
sleeping baby.  The American mother, on the other hand, only scores hi
 
in "
looking at" her s
leeping infant.  This is because, as the invest ;ators
 
point out, she has ordinarily gone out of the room as soon as (

'
 Perhaps it i
s not
 
'nciful to suggest that that moment of high spatial drama which con

or t
he  oern American baby, the closing of the bedroom door.  There are

separation in our lullabies are so gently expressed, surrounding and  i

as they are with words of comfort and warmth.  I do believe that the lull-
abye singer feels tensions, and that the songs she sings express those ten-
sions with a kind of exquisite economy.  But the source seems to me internal

Dear Barre:
 
I
'm sending a
long the enclosed article with a l
ittle trepidation, s
ince
 
i
t's both a bit personal in tone (
like so much of what I do) and rather
 
"
iffy" in content.  All in a
ll, I
'm not really sure i
t hits the style
 
appropriate for JAF; perhaps i
t might f
ind a more congenial resting
 
place in SFQ or perhaps even a journal of culture and personality.  However,
 
I thought I
'd g
ive JAF a try f
irst, but I want to assure you in advance
 
that my nose will not bb the s
lightest out of joint if you turn i
t down.
 
I suppose that really people shouldn't be friends with journal editors,
 
s
hould they?  I
t's constructed to be a more combative relationship.
 
On another topic, I f
inally got in touch with Jim Garland; he turns out
 
to l
ive in Washington, not Oregon, but only thirty miles or so the other
 
s
ide of Portland -
-
 1
527 F Street, W
kshougal, Washington 98671, for your
 
f
iles.  He i
s interested in doing something for the APS meeting, and I
 
shall try to see h
im this summer and work out a plan.  He tells me he's
 
been working on a book; I gather it's part autobiography and part social
 
h
istory of the Kentucky coal miners, and I am hopeing that i
t will work
 
out for him to just read a section from it as a paper.  I
t seems to me
 
we've bevely l
acked the dimension of participation by the "folk" in our
 
meetings, and maybe this would be an early s
tep along that route.
 
Also, the name of the folklorist I worked with when I taught in that
 
special f
olklore seminar at Portland State University a couple of summers
 
ago i
s Morton Jacobs.  He i
s in the English Department at Lewis and Clark
 
and, a
lthough personally hyper-sensitive and occasionally infuriating,
 
he i
s a gentleman of enormous energy and resourcefulness.  I should think
 
he could be very helpful with your local arrangements problems, and he
 
would undoubtedly be p
leased and f
lattered to be asked.
 
All the best,

FOLKSONGS AND FUNCTION: SOME THOUGHTS ON THE AMERICAN LULLABY
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
California State University
 
at Northridge
 
The problem of genre identification and description has been much
 
discussed by folklorists in recent
 
unsolvable, but -
-
 as in the fairy
 
interesting part of the story, for
 
years.  It is probably ultimately
 
tales -
-
 the quest is likely the most
 
it leads one into intellectual confron-
tations with anomalies that one would otherwise probably avoid.
 
Some years ago, hearing of my interest in childrens' song, a young
 
woman in her late twenties introduced herself to me and said that she had
 
been brought up in Chicago and that her mother, a young widow, had sung
 
J
 
her to sleep every night with the s
ame song.
 
extraordinary mixture of emotions on her face
 
reverie, half self-conscious amusement -
-
 she
 
identified as a "funny kind of lullaby":
 
Y
 
1
)
 
And then, with the most
 
-
-
 half genuine sentimental
 
sang me what she herself
 
Hawes  2
)
 
I helped the lady notate her song -
-
 (
she was pleased, because she
 
wanted to preserve i
t for her own children) -
-
 and today in the folklore
 
archives at California State University at Northridge "Slewfoot Sue: a
 
lullaby" s
tares up at me whenever I open the l
ullaby folder, where it
 
l
ies tucked in between fragments of Brahms, various "Rockaby Babies" and
 
"Go Tell Aunt Rhodys", a few baby games l
ike "This L
ittle Piggy" and a
 
couple of errant hymns.  All are labelled "
lullabies" by their student
 
collectors; I assume this must mean: "songs associated with children going
 
to bed".
 
When I had occasion, in 1
970, to examine the folklore archives at
 
the University of California at Berkeley, I was interested to discover
 
exactly the s
ame peculiar melange of materials in its lullaby section.
 
S
lightly over half the songs included had texts that did not mention going
 
to s
leep at all; there were ten or so miscellaneous "childrens"s.ug
 
about animals, birds and the l
ike, two infant games, a hymn, and several
 
songs which can only be categorized as adult -
-
 for example, the following,
 
described by the informant as her "favorite l
ullaby": (
tune not given)
 
There's a man comes to our house every single day,
 
Papa goes to work and the man comes to s
tay.
 
Papa doss the work, and mama gets the pay,
 
And the man comes to our house every single day. 
, 
The use of such non-sleep-centered songs at bedtime does not seem to
 
be entirely a middle-class or urban phenomenon; that is, it i
s not simply
 
a function of the parent's lack of a "suitable" repertoire.  When I asked
 
Mrs. Bessie Jones, a B
lack lady from rural Georgia and mistress of a fine
 
tradition of childrens' songs, what she used to sing babies to s
leep, she
 
told me:
 
3
)
 
.
..I 3ang $t
hn abies so much, just all church songs, you
 
know, just sing and sing and sing, just anything I could
 
think of.  And at last one day, I jumped off on "Casey Jones".
 
Mama come to the door, she say, "Well! I never heard nobody put
 
no babies to s
leep on '
Casey Jones'!"  I had just sung on out...
 
I had just sung and sung and sung, and he wouldn't go to sleep,
 
so I got off on "Casey Jones"!  I s
ing a
ll manner of songs...
 2
)
 
C
 
U
 
And then I remembered singing my own babies to sleep  I happen to know
 
quite a number of lullabies myself, and I come from a l
ullaby-singing f
amily;
 
but the song that always seemed t "work" best -
-
 my stand-by old reliable
 
in times of stress -
-
 was the fine old Protestant hymn, "I Am Bound For the
 
Promised Land".
 
The classificational problem suggested here i
s by no means a new one
 
and can be simply stated: is a song a function of its lexical content or
 
its social usage?  I
s a lullaby a song about going to s
leep, or is it any
 
song on any subject which is used to induce s
lumber?  The dual allegiances -
-
literary and anthropological -
-
 of the discipline of folklore announce
 
themselves under the most trivial of circumstances; and I suppose that by
 
the simple act of filing "Slewfoot Sue" under "lullaby" I have aligned
 
myself irrevocably with the anthropological (
or at least, the functional)
 
wing.
 
Of course, as far as the act of archiving goes, it doesn't really
 
matter; you pay your money and you take your coice, and then you can settle
 
back into what Gershon Legman has referred to as "the great peace of non-
3
)
 
understanding".
 But the functionalist position, as enunciated by Mali-
nowski, is most demanding.
 
The functional view of culture lays down the principle that
 
in every type of civilization, every custom, material object,
 
idea and belief fulfills some vital function, represents an
 
indispensible part within a working whole.
 4
)
 
If this is true -
-
 and it seems at the least to represent a sensible
 
working premise -
-
 it suggests by extension that there should be some
 
4
)
 
V
 
_
j
 
degree of appropriateness between a function and the group of i
tems a
 
culture uses t
o fulfill that function.  This quality of appropriateness
 
may be f
ound on the l
evel of form, s
tructure, c
ontent and/or s
tylistics;
 
and the degree of appropriateness i
s easily recognized by carriers of the
 
culture.  B
oth Mrs. Jones and her mother, for example, seemed to feel a
 
certain l
ack of f
itment between the content and s
tyle of "Casey Jones" and
 
the function of putting a baby to s
leep.
 
What this paper i
s concerned with, then, i
s an examination of the
 
cultural norms governing the rather bizarre congregation of i
tems that
 
American adults seem to choose fo fulfill the function of getting a young
 
child or i
nfant ready to go to s
leep.  The discussion will concentrate
 
mainly on problems of text, but there are at least three s
tylistic quali-
f
iers which must be mentioned in preliminary.
 
One i
s rhythm.  American parents seem to rely heavily on a s
traight-
forward, non-complex, swaying meter, normally 4
/4, to produce a suitably
 
quieting effect.  This i
s not a pan-human trait; to c
ite only one con-
trastive example, A
.M. Jones describes a method of soothing s
leepless babies
 
used by the Ewe people of West Africa, which relies on a complex and syn-
5
)
 
copated rhythm.
 C
learly, Ewe parents can no more s
tand a crying baby than
 
can their American cousins; the mother takes the baby's hands and the
 
father his f
eet and they swing him between them, hammock fashion, in a s
low
 
wide arc, with a pause at the top of every third swing.  The movement i
s
 
performed in what may be roughly described as duple meter; the aecompanying
 
s
ong i
s e
ssentially i
n 3
/4; when combined with the pause, the overall effect
 
i
s of e
xtreme s
yncopation.  I have never tried this with an American baby;
 
i
t s
eems l
ikely, though, that by the age of three or four months at least
 
he would be s
timulated, rather than soothed, by such actions.  Certainly,

/
 
L
i
 
actions.  Certainly, a
ll of the American songs used as lullabies  hat 4
 
1
 ha -tsa
-t
 can be s
lowed to our favorite, supremely regular, simple
 
meters: e
ither 4/4 or 3
/4.
 
A second s
tylistic qualifier has to do with the patterning of pre-
ferred phonemic choices, especially those apparent in humming or the
 
use of nonsense syllables.  Alan Lomax and the l
inguist, Edith Crowell
 
Trager, in an investigation of the possibility that folk song areas may
 
prove to be definable in part in terms of vowel and consonantal preference
 
patterns, turn their attention briefly to lullabies.  Lomax, in his intro-
duction to their s
tudy, remarks:
 
Spain i
s a region of lullaby s
inging -
-
 often rare in other
 
parts of the world.  Each lullaby has a refrain consisting
 
of a characteristic set of lyllables.  In recording scores
 
of lillabies, I observed that the effect of lullabies on the
 
child was to put it to s
leep even when the s
inging took
 
place during a recording session in the presence of the
 
entire village.  There was a marked change from northern
 
to southern Spain in terms of the vowel set composing the
 
lullaby refrain, and it occurred to me that perhaps vowel
 
preferences were implanted by mothers in their children during
 
infancy and that these patterns helped to shape the development
 
of adult folk song. 
4 b
)
 
Though the Lomax/Trager s
tudy primarily centers on adult folk song,
 
i
t would seem on the basis of the extensive Spanish data they report that
 
this hypothesis may be verifiable.  I am unable to pursue this interesting
 
suggestion here, p
i
'4.a i1y because comparable d$*a i
s simply not available;
 
however, there are some associated observations to be made.
 
American l
ullabies, on the whole, in contrast to the s
ituation des-
cribed in Spain, f
it our generally wordy adult singing style and do not
 
really feature nonsense syllables.  However, there i
s evidence both in the
 
CSUN and the Berkeley archives that much non-verbal singing, usually des-
cribed as "humming", takes place in the lullaby context.  Brahms, lullaby
 
i
s reported frequently, for example, but generally in fragmentary form,
 
s
ince apparently few people choose to remember the syrupy English translation.
 
6
)
 
My hunch is that a number of other tunes are also typically sung without
 
words, and that nonsense syllables, such as "dee dee" or "na na" are used
 
rather than strict humming.  It is the rare collector who reports such
 
non-word-centered data.  If the information were available, however, it
 
would be surprising if it did not evince regional or sub-cultural pattern-
ing, in view of the l
ongevity and persistence of some nonsense refrains in
 
other genres of folksong.
 
A final stylistic quilifier has to do with the fact that singing stems
 
from a larger pattern of social intercourse.  A song is a communicative
 
act and has some degree of fit with the overall communicative style of
 
7
)
 
the society.
 This point can be clarified by turning to some comparative
 
data: specifically, to a cross-cultural study by William Caudill and Helen
 
Weinstein.which details the results of an intensive examination of the
 
interactional patterns between Japanese mother's and their infants below
 
the age of four months, as contrasted with those of American Anthers and
 
8
)
 
their infants of the s
ame age range.
 In the course of this research,
 
observers visited in the homes and noted the amount of time the various
 
mothers spent feeding, holding, or rocking their babies, etc., as well as
 
the kinds of behaviors the babies were engaging in at the same time.
 
In the sphere of oral communication, the babies' actions were classi-
fied as either "happy vocalizing" or "unhappy vocalizing", which seems
 
reasonably obvious.  The description of the mothers' verbal behavior i
s
 
more complex.  The overall category "mother talks to baby' wass5tI Uff*dód
 
.
..into chats and lulls. "Lulls" is a very delimited
 
variable and means that the caretaker is softly s
inging
 
or humming a lullaby, or making repetitive comforting
 
noises, with the apparent intent of soothing and quieting
 
the baby or getting him to go to s
leep.  "Chats" includes
 
all other vocalizations to the infant, such as talking to
 
him, singing to him in a l
ively fashion, and playing word
 
games, such as "boo" and "goo" with him.
 9
)
 
7
)
 
V
 
I
t is here, in the mothers' behavior, that the culturally distinctive
 
features emerge.  Caudill and Weinstein report that, although Japanese and
 
American mothers spend almost exactly the s
ame total amount of time "talk-
ing to" their infants, their communicative styles within that overall cate-
gory are significantly different.  On the basis of adjusted mean frequen-
cies, the ratio of "chats" to "lulls" for the Japanese mother was 79 to 22;
 
comparable statistics for the American mother show a ration of 120 "chats"
 
10)
 
to 3 "lulls" -
-
 a really striking disproportion.
 
Further, in terms of the interaction between mother and child, there
 
is a strong correlation between the American infant's "happy vocalizing"
 
and the American mother's "chatting", a relationship which is actually
 
reversed in the Japanese data; that is, the Japanese mother's "chatting"
 
correlates only with her infant's unhappy vocalizing. (
Caudill and Weinstein
 
speculate that the "chatting" behavior may effectively be reserved by the
 
Japanese mother for occasions when the baby needs distraction.)  They con-
clude in summary that the Japanese mother
 
.
..does more lulling carrying and rocking of her baby.
 
She seems to try to soothe and quiet the child and to
 
communicate with him physically rather than verbally.
 
On the other hand the American. . .
mother in her care does
 
more looking at and chatting to her baby.  She seems to
 
stimulate the baby to activity and to vo a1 response.
 
It is as if the American mother wanted to have a vocal,
 
active baby, and the Japanese mother wanted to have a quiet,
 
contented baby.  In terms of the styles of caretaking of
 
the mothers in the two cultures, the* seem to get what
 
they apparently want.

The wide range of subject matter selected by the American mother,
 
when putting her child to sleep, becomes less puzzling.  The "chatting" style
 
of interaction, associated, as it is, with "happy vocalizing" on the part of
 
the infant, is carried into the bedtime context.  And as the child learns
 
to s4e p and can, so to say, "chat" back and ask for what he wants to hear,

tanzas of the traditional ballad.  L
ength -

-
 appears to be the major aesthetic c
riterion for this
 
a
ge range.
 
Thus, on the basis of the foregoing s
tylistic criteria: s
imple meter,
 
complex phonemic patterning and the tendency t
oward verbal c
ontact with
 
the child on an adult and "

The "
chatting" phase can, by definition, encompassaa rep
oire of
 
song of unlimited subject matter.  The repertoire used in the "
lulling"
 
phase, where i
t exists, i
s more difficult to a
scertain, f
or American
 
mothers, unlike the Spanish women whom L
omax describes, seem invariably to
 
perform this function in spatial i
solation with their babies.  My hunch
 
9
)
 
is that a variety of songs are used, and that the two repertoires are not
 
as far apart in subject matter as might be supposed.  Lacking any but the
 
most fragmentary evidence, however, I must fall back on the l
iterary criter-
ion and make the straight-forward assumption that when American parents sing
 
songs that talk about goint to sleep, they have actually reached the stage
 
in the process when they want the baby to go to sleep.
 
A brief essay by Theresa Brakeley in the Standard Dictionary of
  
Folklore, Myth and Legend provides a useful general summary of the textual
 
content of the l
inguistically-definable lullaby, though it is based on a
 
14)
 
vaguely described "world-wide" repertoire.
 Lullabies, according to Miss
 
Brakeley, say in great part
 
go to s
leep, mother is here, you are safe, everything is
 
all right.  The all rightness of everything bay be e
laborated
 
by a placid description of what the rest of the household is
 
doing.  Father has gone hunting, fishing, sheep-tending, etc...  5
)
 
The peacefulness of the surroundings may be described; the safety of the
 
child may be guaranteed by "invoking saints, angels, or guardian spirits";
 
paternal admiration of the child or "a prophecy of his glorious future"
 
may be expressed.  Some lullabies include promises or bribes for good be-
havior; conversely, "threats, from the playful to the hair-raising" may
 
occur.  Finally there are some lullabies "complaining of the mother's lot,
 
of the father's absence, neglect or drunkenness".
 
Against this generalized "international" picture, I have aligned a
 
repertoire of those American "true" lullabies (
as defined by their lexical
 
content) which are most frequently reported in some fifteen regional and
 
national collections of American folksongs, as well as in the two archives
 
previously mentioned, thus sampling both rural and urban areas.  The method
 
is slippy but fair, I believe, considering the definitional problems.  Cer-
tainly it seems few people would challenge as uncharacteristic the following
 
10)
 
l
ist, which comprises those s
leep-centered lullabies I have found to be
 
the most frequently reported in the United States:
 
Rockabye Baby
 
Bye Baby Bunting
 
All the Pretty Little Horses
 
sub-type: Poor Little Lamb Cries Mammy
 
S*bepype: Go To Sleepy, Little Baby
 
Sleep Baby Sleep
 
Baby's Boat's the Silver Moon
 
Hush, Little Baby, Don't Say a Word
 
(The equally popular "Brahms' Lullaby" has been excluded since the large
 
number of fragmentary versions in the CSUN archives indicates that by the
 
time singers get through the second l
ine "with roses bedight" they have
 
generally given up on the words and started humming.)
 
All the above clearly fit one or more of I*akeley's descriptions, ex-
cept that there appear to be no expressions of "maternal admiration for the
 
child or predictions of his glorious future" and no complaints about the
 
mother's condition or the father's misbehavior.  These themes are, it is true,
 
represented in the overall corpus of American lullabies, but they occur in
 
less widely known songs than those cited above.  The non-appearance of the two
 
topics in the "most popular" l
ist may be significant, as they are the most
 
emotionally direct (
the least "chatty") of all the subjects detailed by
 
Brakel
 ey
 
Two of the songs (
"All the Pretty Little Horses" and "Hush, Little
 
Baby") might be categorized as containing bribes for good behavior; on
 
closer examination, their promises are simple predictions' "When you wake,
 
you shall have..." and "Papa's going to buy you...".  Again, the emotional
 
formulation is oblique, rather than direct.  These two songs also suggest
 
a future orientation; mostly, though, American lullabies are set in present
 
time, filled with descriptive terms about the surroundings and the activities
 
of various people.
 
And it is here that we reach the single most characteristic quality
 
1
1)
 
=2
 
in the lexical content of s
leep-centered American lullabies: the spatial
 
isolation of the baby.  All the people around him in song are actually
 
somewhere else -
-
 shaking dream-land trees, gone hunting, out watching
 
sheep, or what have you.
 Baby, meanwhile, is up in a tree, or sailing
 
off in a boat made out of the moon, or driving away with his "pretty l
ittle
 
horses". When he does sleep, he i
s described as being in a place called
 
"dreamland" which, wherever it is, clearly isn't his own bed; and he is
 
variously requested or ordered to take himself to that "
land of Nod" by
 
the l
inguistic convention which requires English speakers to "go to s
leep".
 
Even the most wide-spread choice of a lulling nonsense syllable takes the
 
form of a spatial metaphor; "bye bye", after all, means both "sleep" and
 
"farewell".
 
Here again, some of the data developed in the cross-cultural study
 
mentioned previously might be enlightening. Japanese and American mothers
 
seem to spend almost the same amount of time in care-taking activities
 
when their babies are awake.  During the hours of s
leep, however, the
 
Japanese mother tends to continue her care-taking at a leisurely pace,
 
and thus she scores high in such factors as rocking, carrying and holding
 
her s
leeping baby.  The American mother, on the other hand, only scores
 
high in "looking at" her sleeping infant.  This is because, as the investi-
gators point out, she has ordinarily gone out of the room as soon as (
or
 
before) the baby has fallen asleep; she then returns from time to time to
 
16)
 
glance through the door at him.
 
"When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall..."  Perhaps it is not
 
too fanciful to suggest that that moment of high spatial drama which
 
concludes the most popular of all English-language lullabies simply pre-
sages, for the modern American baby, the closing of the bedroom door. There
 
are not many other societies besides ours in the world which hold to the
 
1
7)
 
belief that babies should sleep alone.
 
1
2)
 
Now what is to be made of all this?  In his ground-breaking e
ssay,
 
18)
 
"Four Functions of Folklore",
 William Bascom has pointed out that one
 
of the functions of traditional oral expression is to a
llow the individual
 
to say what is otherwise unsayable in his society, to release his feelings
 
of hostility, tension or anger in a depersonalized and therefore sanction-
able way.  In terms of this thesis, must we then conclude that American
 
mothers are really expressing hidden hostility towards their infants when
 
they chat away at them a
ll day about miscellaneous topics and then put them
 
to bed to the cheerful but impersonal l
ines of "Slewfoot Sue", or to al
 
lulling refrain that actually suggests that the babies should go off
 
somewhere else?
 
Maybe; but that's only one of the possibilities.  There are, after all,
 
two people present and -
-
 so to say -
-
 in the audience when a lullaby is
 
sung within context: the infant and the mother.  I do believe that the
 
lullaby singer feels tensions, and that the songs she sings express those
 
tensions with a kind of exquisite economy.  But the source may be external
 
or internal; the lullabying mother may in fact be s
inging as much to her-
self as to her baby.
 
Edmund Leach, among others, has pointed out that one of the first prob-
lems facing an infant is to discover the delimits of his own body, to deter-
19)
 
mine what is himself, and what is outside, or separate from, him.
 It has
 
occurred to me to wonder if the post-partum mother does not face the same
 
problem in reverse.  Her infant, after all, once a part of her own body,
 
is now permanently and forever separate.
 
This experience, of course, is common to all mothers in all societies,
 
but American culture puts what is clearly an abnormal degree of separation
 
strain on the mother.  On the one hand, she must train her baby to be the
 
active, exploratory, happily vocaling -
-
 in sum, independent -
-
 l
ittle
 
13)
 
character that our culture prefers.  On the other hand, she must do this,
 
in the main, without assistance from anybody e
lse; for our society is
 
almost unique in its insistence that mothers -
-
 and mothers alone -
- must
 
20)
 
take care of their babies.
 Thus she must simultaneously try to separate
 
her baby from herself, making him independent, self-reliant and strong
 
(
for in America, they say, every tub stands on its own bottom), while at
 
the same time she memains in maximum physical proximity to him.
 
No wonder American mothers sing to their babies -
-
 and more especially,
 
probably, to themselves -
-
 about separation and space and going very far
 
away.  I always found myself that rocking a baby to sleep was kind of a
 
sad thing to do -
-
 not miserable or tragic or irksome -
-
 just a l
ittle bit
 
sad, somehow.
 
It was remarked earlier that in terms of child-training, Japanese and
 
American mothers "seem to get what they apparently want".  Other investi-
gations have indicated that this is profoundly true for cultures everywhere;
 
overall, a society tries to produce the kind of adult individuals it needs
 
2
1)
 
for its own survival.
 But -
-
 expressed in an ancient Spanish proverb -
-
there is another cultural law which seems equally universal:
 
Take what you want -
-
 but pay for it, says Cod.
 
The bill must be paid.  If we want independent children, we must thrust
 
them away from us, and, equally importantly, we must thrust ourselves away
 
from them.  The American lullaby, I suggest -
-
 whether "chatty" or "lulling",
 
whether the mother finds herself singing "Bye Baby Bunting" or "
I Am Bound
 
for the Promised Land", or even "Casey Jones" -
-
 is, on one of its deeper
 
levels, a mother's conversation with herself about separation.  And, as such,
 
one of its most profoundly supportive functions is to make the inevitable and
 
inexorable payment of our social dues just a l
ittle less personally painful.

I, for purposes of scientific research, allowed several
 
children to be brought up in such a way that they never heard any human
 
speech or song, in order to determine which language they themselves would
 
choose to speak.  The experiment failed to come to fruition, however; all
 
the children died in infancy before they could possibly speak, since none
 
could fall asleep without a lullaby.

syndrome Alan Dundes describes in "Text, Texture and Context," Southern
 
Folklore Quarterly 28 (

)undes points -
out, social
 
scientists normally report oontext without noting the specific texts in use,
 
while folklorists all too often report only the texts, without reference to
 
the contexts in which they occur.  This has proven all too true in my
 
attempts to research the lullaby: descriptive accounts say that lullabies
 
are sung but fail to state which songs in fact make up the lullaby reper-
toire, whiêe most folksong collections fail to identify lullabies at all;
 
those that do, give no clue as to whether the identification was made by
 
the informant or on the basis of the collector's later introspection.  Thus
 
I have had to rely primarily on my own field work, a l
imited base-line at
 
best.

patterns of s
leeping are not a function
 
o
f "overcrowding" i
n the Japanese ho me, but
 
rather are a matter of choice, as i
s shown i
n
 
Caudill and Plath. Much the sa me point can be
 
made concerning bathing.  Starting at approxi-
mately the beginning of the s
econd month of
 
l
ife, the Japanese i
nfant i
s held i
n the ar ms of
 
the mother or another adult while they bathe
 
t
ogether in the deep bathtub (
fore) at ho me or
 
a
t the neighborhood public bath  (
sentô), and
 
this pattern of shared bathing will continue f
or
 
a Japaoese child until he i
s about t
en years of
 
age, aol often much l
onger (
see Vogel, pp.  29-
232). In contrast, the American mother s
eldo m
 
bathes with an i
nfant; rather, she g
ives h
i m a
 
bth f
ro m outside o f  the tub, and she co m muni-
cates with h
i m verbally and by positioning h
is
 
body.

able was represented by two additive variables:
 
(
1) being carried on the caretaker's back, and
 
(
2) being i
n the caretaker's arms or l
ap. The
 
s
pecif
ic variable "on caretaker's back" was i
ni-
t
ially i
ncluded because, i
n general, young Japa-
n
ese children are often c
arried t
here.  As we
 
f
ound out, so mewhat belatedly, the Japanese
 
i
nfant at three-to-four months i
s not very, f
re-
quently carried on the back because t
he mother
 
f
eels  the  i
nfant's  neck muscles  are  not  yet
 
s
trong enough, a
lthough t
his beco mes co m mon a
 
month or so l
ater and varies by social c
lass and
 
occupational s
tyle o
f l
ife. The i
nfant was car-
r
ied on t
he back during observations i
n only 3
 
of our Japanese cases, and we have therefore
 
r
ecorded these data as "
in ar ms or l
ap." W hen
 
t
he i
nfant was not on t
he caretaker's back or i
n
 
arms or l
ap, we originally r
ecorded what s
ort o
f
 
r
eceptacle he was i
n (
in bed, i
n bath, i
n i
nfant
 
s
eat, and i
n o
ther p

laypen or on
 
a zubuton, t

These variablas d

ooler months, Japanese in-
'
eats wear more c
lothing and are under more
 
covers  than  A merican  i
nfants.  Fortunately,
 
roughly half o
f t
he cases i
n each culture were
 
c
lesarved during the warmer months.  For the
 
A merican i
nfants, there i
s no d
ifference between
 
the active behavior of the cases observed during
 
the cooler (
a mean of 125 observations)  and
 
warmer (
a mean of 128 observations) months
 
(using a Mann- Whitney U t
est of the rank-order
 
of the f
requencies, z
 = 0
.18, n
.s.). For the Japa-
nese i
nlants, however, the cases observed during
 
the war mer months (
a mean  o
f 65) are more
 
active than t
hose i

n the

A merican  babies  are  s
till  t

15 The occurrence of behavior i
n the category
 
of "f
inger or pacifier" appears t
o be related to
 
breast versus bottle f
eeding i
n both cultures,
 
a
lthough the Japanese i
nfants are i
n general
 
much l
ower in any sort o
f co mparison.  The
 
c
learest data on this question co me f
ro m the
 
co mparison of those mothers who never breast
 
f
ed versus those mothers who were f
eeding en-
t
irely by breast (no use of the bottle at a
ll) at
 
the t
ime of observation. The 9 American i
nfants
 
who were never breast f
ed have an average o
f
 
196 observations i
n the category of "
finger or
 
pacif
ier," while the 4 A merican i
nfants being f
ed
 
entirely by breast have an average of 97 ob-
servations i
n this category. Among the Japanese
 
cases, the 4 i
nfants who were never breast f
ed
 
have an average of 88 observations i
n the cate-
gory of "
finger or pacif
ier
," while the 6 i
nfants
 
being entirely breast f
ed have an average of 42
 
observations i
n this category.  Thus, t
here i
s
 
roughly twice as much f
inger sucking by babies
 
who have never been breast f
ed i
n both cultures,
 
but the average f
or the Japanese
 bab
i e

To the r
nother beside the cradle whore lies her tender o
nfspi n ,
 
song is as natural as speech itself to man.
 Lullabies are found in
 
every land; everywhere the joyous mother—heart bursts forth into sony.
 
The German proberb is significant:
 "Wer ein saugendes Kind hat, der
 
hat eine singende Frau," and Fischer, a quaint poet of the sixteenth
 
century, has beautifullyz expressed a like idea: -
-
o Honig 1st, da sammlen sich die F1ie en,
 
o Kinder sind, da zigx singt man ur
n die  ie;en."
 
i
-loss, in whose book is to be found a choice collection of
 
lullabies from all over the globe, remarks:
 "The folk—poetry of all
 
peoples is rich in songs whose texts and melodies the tender mother
 
herself imagined and composed." *
 
The Countess Nartinengo—Cesaresco devotes an interestinç
' chapter
 
of her Essays in the Study of Folk—Song to the subject of lullabies...

 During the times of the deepest political debasement (brou
 
to a low poin ),  the first years of the 19th century, an
 
areness of their own worth came about in Germany.
 People
 
sought to console themselves with what survived and wasn't
 
in
 
to be annihilated of beauty
 i
e German language and poetry,
 
and went more deeply into the recognition of their own spiritual
 
life.
 
There arose a great endeavor to portray the spiritual
 
life of the German Yolk as it appeared in Language and literature.
 
In this endeavor the best men of that time were involved,  the
 
Brothers Grimm and others.
 The work,  "Das Wunderhorn" of
 
Brentano and Achim von Arnim was a significant landmark.

 Some rhymes are lyrical,

others dramatic,  for example children's games.

 Lullabies:
 
It is somehow uplifting,  to hear a g German mother sing
 
the old,  soft lullabies at the cradle of her beloved child.
 
Since the earliest times, the mothers have insisted upon
 
expressing in song their motherly ecstasy (
"Mutterwonne").
 
how terrible is a childhooè without song and sound  (sang-
and klang1os );  so says the following thoughtful legend:
 
Kaiser Friedrich II,  for the purpose of scientific research,
 
allowed several children to be brought up in such a way that
 
they never heard any human seang sound or song,  in order to
 
determine which language xkR they themselves would prefer
 
to speak;  then, according to the chronicler,  the children
 
died before this time, because they t e  couldn't get to
 
sleep without songs.
 Great praise has been given to German
 
mothers for a very long time for their singing at the cradle;
 
Fniedrich Rueckert, for example,  speaks of the significance
 
play (
Spiel) for himself and his youth:
 
"I was a bad child,
 
and never slept wiihcan  a song,
 
dat I went to sleep right away,
 
.
ls soon as a song sounded;
 
ich my mother sang so gen T

f this is true -
-
 and I believe at the least it represents
 
a sensible working premise - -
 it suggests, by extension, that there
 
should be some degree of appropriateness between a function and the
 
group of items a culture uses to fulfill that function.
 This quality
 
of appropriateness may be found on the level of form, structure, content
 
and/or stylistics; and the degree of appropriateness is easily recog-
nized by carriers of the culture.
 Both Mrs. Jones and her mother,
 
for example, seemed to feel a certain lack of fitment between the
 
form and content of "Casey Jones" and the function of putting a baby
 
to sleep.
 
What I am concerned with in this paper, then, is some exami-
nation of the cultural norms governing the rather bizarre congregation
 
of items that American adults seem to choose to fulfill the function
 
of getting a young child or infant ready to go to sleep.
 I do not
 
pretend that the examination is exhaustive, and I will concentrate
 
mainly on problems o  text; but there are at least three stylistic
 
qualifiers which I feel must be briefly mentioned.
 
One is rhythm.
 American parents seem to rely heavily on a
 
straightforward, non-complex, swaying meter, normally four/four, to
 
produce a suitably quieting effect.  Lest this be dismissed as a pan-
human trait,  I might mention that A
.M. Jones describes a method of
 
soothing sleepless babies used by the' Ewe people of West Africa, which
 
relies on a complex, ultimately syncopated rhythm.
 Apparently, Ewe
 
parents can no more stand a crying baby than can their American Cousins;
 
the mother will take the baby's hands and the father his feet and they
 
swing him between them, hammock fashion, in a slow wide arc, with a
 
pause at the top of every third swing.
 The movement is performed in
 
what may be roughly described as duple meter; the accompanying song is
 
essentially in three/four; when combined with the pause, the overall
 
effect is of extreme syncopation.
 I have never tried this with an
 
American baby; my hunch is that by the age of three or four months
 
at least he would be stimulated, rather than soothed, by such actions.
 
Certainly all Ob the American songs used as lullabies that I have
 
tested can be slowed to our favortte, supremely regular, simple meters,
 
either 3/4 or 4/4.
 
A second stylistic qualifier has to do with the patterning
 
of preferred phonemic choices, especially those apparent in humming
 
or the use of nonsense syllables.
 Alan Lomax and the linguist Edith
 
Crowell Trager, in an investigation of the possibility that folk song
 
areas may prove to be definable in part in terms of vowel and conso-
nantal preference patterns, turn their attention briefly to lullabies.
 
Lomax, in his introduction to their study, remarks
 
Spain is a region of lullaby singing -
-
 often rare
 
in other parts of the world.
 Each lullaby has a
 
refrain consisting of a characteristic set of syl-
lables.
 In recording scores of lullabies, I observed
 
that the effect of lullabies on the child was to put
 
it to sleep even when the singing took place during
 
a recording session in the presence of the entire
 
village.
 There was a marked change from northern
 
to southern Spain in terms of the vowel set composing
 
the lullaby refrain, and it occurred to me that
 
perhaps vowel preferences were implanted by mothers
 
in their children during infancy and that these
 
patterns helped to shape the development of adult
 
folk song.
 (Lomax & Trager, 2-3)
 
Though the Lomax/Trager study primarily centers on adult folk
 
song, it would seem on the basis of the extensive Spanish data they
 
report that this hypothesis may be verifiable.
 I am unable to pursue
 
this interesting suggestion here, primarily because comparable data
 
is simply not available; however, there are some associated observations
 
to be made.
 
American lullabies, on the whole, in contrast to the situation
 
described in Spain, fit our generally wordy adult singing style and
 
do not really emphasize nonsense syllables.
 However, there is evidence
 
both in the Valley State and the Berkeley archives that much non-verbal
 
singing, usually described as "humming", takes place in the lullaby
 
context.
 Brahms' lullaby is reported frequently, for example, but
 
generally in fragmentary form, since apparently few people choose to
 
remember the syrupy English translation,  My hunch is that a number of
 
other tunes are also typically sung without words, and that nonsense
 
syllables, such as "dee dee' or "na na" are used rather than humming.
 
I
t is the rare collector who reports such non-word-centered data.
 
If the information were available, however, it would surprise me if
 
it did not evince regional or sub-cultural patterning, in view of
 
the longevity and persistence of some nonsense refrains in other genres
 
of folksong.
 
A final stylistic qualifier has to do with the fact that
 
singing stems from a larger pattern of social intercourse.
 A song
 
i
s a communicative act and has some degree of fit with the overall
 
communicative style of the society.
 (Lomaxs 1969)  A recent cross-
cultural study (Caudill and Weinstein) details the results of an
 
intensive examination of the interactional patterns between Japanese
 
mothers and their infants below the age of four months, as contrasted
 
with those of American mothers and their infants of the same age range.
 
In the course of this research, observers visited in the homes and
 
noted the amount of t
ime the various mothers spent feeding, holding,
 
rocking their babies, etc., as well as the kind of behavior the babies
 
were engaging in at the same time.
 
In the sphere of oral communication,  the babies' actions
 
were classified as either "happy vocalizing" or "unhappy vocalizing",
 
which seems reasonably obvious.  The description of the mothers'
 
4
 
verbal behavior is more
 
ési
t
hg.
 The overall category:  "mother
 
talks to baby" was subdivided:
 
.
..into chats and lulls. 
"Lulls" is a very delimited
 
variable and means that the caretaker is softly
 
singing or humming a lyllaby, or making repetitive
 
comfortin noises, with the apparent intent of
 
soothing and quieting the baby or getting him to
 
go to sleep.
 "Chats" includes all other vocali-
zations to the infant, such as talking to him,
 
singing to him in a lively fashion, and playing word
 
games, such as "boo" and "goo" with him.
 (Caudill
 
&Weinstein, 23.)
 
The selection of the term "chat" seems significant.
 It
 
has frequently been noted that American parents place an extremely
 
high value on their children learning to speak at a very early age,
 
and many studies indicate a high correlation between early speech
 
and a large amount of parental stimulation through verbal inter-
action with the baby.
 Although Japanese and American mothers spend
 
almost exactly the same total amount of time "talking to" their
 
infants,  their communicative styles are significantly different.
 
On the basis of adjusted mean frequencies, the ratio of  "chats"
 
to "lulls" for the Japanese mother was 79 to 22; comparable statistics
 
for the American mother show a ratio of 120 "chats" to 3 "lulls" -
-
a really striking disproportion.
 (Caudill and Weinstein, p
.  29)
 
Fur
t
h
er, in terms of the interaction between mother and
 
child,  there is a strong correlation between the American infant's
 
a

summary that the Japanese mother
 
.
..does more lulling, carrying and rocking of her
 
baby.
 She seems to try to soothe and quiet the
 
child and to communicate with him physically rather
 
than verbally.
 On the other hand the American...
 
mother in her care does more looking at and chatting
 
to her baby.
 She seems to stimulate the baby to
 
activity and to vocal response.
 It is as if the
 
American mother wanted to have a vocal, active baby,
 
and the Japanese mother wanted to have a quiet, con-
tented baby.
 In terms of the styles of caretaking
 
of the mothers in the two cultures, they seem to get
 
what they apparently want...
 (Caudill and Weinstein, p
.  31)
 
The wide range of subject matter selected by the American
 
lullaby singer becomes less puzzling.
 The chatting style of inter-
action, associated, as it is, with "happy vocalizing" on the part of
 
the infant, is carried into the bedtime context.
 And as the child
 
learns to speak and can, so to say, "chat" back and ask for what he
 
wants to hear, he is already adjusted to a communication style with
 
the parent that is far-ranging in subject matter, cheerful and emotion-
ally perhaps a bit dispassionate.
 In my own experience with putting
 
two and three year olds to bed,  I found that at that age they actively
 
resist "lulling" but are so enamored of the "chatting" style that they
 
form possibly the only audience in the United States today that is
 
openly enthusiastic over the traditional ballad.

Thus, on the basis of the foregoing stylistic criteria:
 
phonemic patterning and the tendency towards verbal contact
 
with the child on an adult and "chatty" level,  "Slew Foot Sue" may
 
not, after all, be a particularly bizarre or outlandish choice for
 
a bedtime song •

So now, what of- t

pr.ee4kIreT--anf  the7 lullaby itself?
 
There are, after all, some songs which fit both the literary and the
 
contextual criteria
 some songs that are sung to babies at bedtime
 
which do talk about sleep.  Really rigorous evidence on the contents
 
of this specialized repertoire has been surprisingly hard to find.
 
Most collections of American folksong do not isolate lullabies as a
 
4
 
separate group, and some do not even identify individual songs as such
 
Apparently, the reader is supposed to know a lullaby when he sees one -  - 
a tribute to our underlying reliance on the criterion of literary
 
content, no matter how functional or structural or whatever we claim
 
to be.
 
A brief essay by Theresa Brak�ey in the Standard Dictionary
  
of Folklore and Mythology provides a useful general summary of lullaby
 
content, though it is based Qf
l a vaguely described "world-wide"
 
repertoire.  Lullabies, according to Miss Brakeley, say in great parts
 
.
..go to sleep, mother is here, you are safe, everything
 
is all right.  The all rightness of everything may be
 
elaborated by a placid description of what the rest of
 
the household is doing.  Father has gone hunting,
 
fishing, sheep-tending, etc...  (Brakeley, pi 653)
 
The peacefulness of the surroundings may be described; the safety of
 
the child may be guaranteed by "invoking saints, angels or guardian
 
spirits"; maternal admiration of the child or "a prophecy of his glorious
 
future" may be expressed.
 Some lullabies include promises or bribes
 
for good behavior; conversely,  "threats, from the playful to the hair-
raising" may occur.  Finally, there are some lullabies "complaining

Dear Bess,
 
Has "San Fernando Val
y State" ceased to exist as
 
a place name?  This is what I glean from your letterhead.
 
Enclosed is a copy of the lullaby text you requested.
 
Archivist Cathy Figgen  typed it for you. The informant
 
was Kathleen Whitney and the collector was Sara Sarlaw.
 
Hope JAF takes your lullaby piece.  I think it would
 
be nice to give collector and informant proper credit.
 
And of course you have permission to use the material.
 
Delighted to learn that you plan to go to Helsinki.
 
I will I
gb there accompanied by daughter Alison (age
 
14 going on 21!). However, we will visit Russia before
  
Helsinki since I must be in Cambridge by July 1 to
 
teach Harvard Summer School.  Sorry to miss what will
 
surely be a jolly tour with lots of folklorists after
 
the Helsinki meetings.
 
re: singles going from the U
.S., from the list
 
of participants I see Elizabeth Brandon, Linda Degh,
 
Elli Köng s Maranda (
Canada), Katharine Luomala, among
 
others. I can't see how it would do any hainm to write
 
Katharine thomala or Elizabeth Brandon etc. to see if
 
(1) they're going to Russia, and (
2) they might like
 
to double up/economize.
 
Hope all is well. Will see you at CFS in Santa
 
Rosa in April if not before.

FOLK SONG AND FUNCTION: A LOOK AT THE LULLABY
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
April, 1970
 
The problem of genre  identification and description has
 
been much discussed by folklorists  in recent years.
 It is  probabI;
 
ultimately unsolvable but -- as in the fairy tales -- the quest is
 
likely the most interesting part of the story, for it leads one into
 
intellectual confroritati
_ons wi
_tb  ano: ali
_es  that one would otherwise
 
probably avoid.
 
A few years  ago,  hearLn
,  of ny  interest in chi
_Idrens
 
song,  a voun  woman in her late twent ies  introduced herself  to  me
 
and said that she had been brought up in Chicago and that her mother,
 
a young widow, had sung her to sleep every night with the same song.
 
And  then, with the most extraordinary mixture of emotions on her face
 
half genuine sentimental reverie, half embarrassed amusement --  sh e 
sang me what she herself identified as a "funny old lullahyc":

I helped the lady notate her song -
-
 (
she was pleased,
 
because she wanted to preserve it for her own children) -
-
 and
 
today in the folklore archives at San Fernando Valley State Colleoc
 
"Slewfoot Sue: a lullaby" stares up at me whenever I open the lullaby
 
folder, where it lies cuddled in between fragments of Brahms, various
 
"Rockabye Babies" and "Go Tell Aunt Rhodys", a few baby games like
 
"This Little Piggy" and a couple of errant hymns.
 \
1I are labelled
 
"lullabies" by their student collectors;  I assune this bust mean:
 
"
songs associated with children going to bed".
 
The Berkeley Folklore Archives,  I have been interested to
 
discover,  includes exactly the same kind of peculiar melange of materials
 
in its lullaby section.
 Slightly over half the songs included have
 
texts that do not mention going to sleep  c
t all;  there are ten or
 
so miscellaneous  "childrens" songs about animals, birds and the like,
 
two games, a hym n, and several songs which can only be categorized
 
as adult ) such as the following, described by the singer as  "
her
 
favorite lullaby":
 (
tune not available)
 
There's a man coees to our house ever  s
 i
rwl  day
 
Papa goes  to work and the man comes to stay,
 
Papa does the  work and mama gets the pay
 
And the man comes to our house every single day.
 
The use of such non-sleep-centered songs at bedtime does
 
not seem to be entirely a middle-class  )
heno
w:aT;  chat: is,  it:  IS  nor
-
simply a function of the parent's lack of a "
suitahlc" recertotru.
 
khen I asked krs.  Bessie Jones,  a Negro lady from rural Georgia and
 
mistress of a fine tradition of ch ldrens '
 sorws ,
 what she used to
 
Sin-
babIes to sleep,  she told
 
I l
ust sin,-
, to  '
en,  just s
 me.
 You know,  I satin
 
to babies so much,  to my little baby -
-
 just all
 
church song, you know,  just sing and sing and sinn,
 
you know,  just anything I could think of.
 At last
 
one day I jumped off on Casey Jones! 
Narna come to
 
the door, she say,  "Jell!
 I never heard nobody put:
 
no babies to sleep on Casey Jones!" I had just sung
 
on out...
 You sing some of thos hyrnns, old draggy
 
songs, you likely to go off to sleep with the baby...
 
And suddenly I remembered rocking i
r
iy own babies to s l e e p.
 
I happen to know quite a number of lullabies myself, and I come fro: -.
I
 
a lullaby-singing family; but the some that always seened to "work"
 
best -
-
 my stand-by old reliable in tines of stress -
-
 was the  fine
 
old Protestant hymn:  "I Am Bound for the Promised Land".
 
The class ificational problem suggested here is by no means
 
a new one and can he simply stated  is a song a function of its lexical
 
content or i
t--s social usa
.ee?  Is a lullaby a song about going to sleep
 
or is it any somp on any subject which is used to induce slumber?
 
The dual allegiances -
 -
 literary and anthropological -
-
 of the
 
discipline of folklore announce themselves under the most trivial of
 
circumstances; and I suppose that by the sim ple act of filing "Slewfoot:
 
Sue" under "lullaby" I have aligned myself irrevocably wite tL C
 
functional  (
some would say, anthropological) winp.
 
Of course,  as far as the act of archiving goes,  it doesn't
 
really matter; you pay your money and you take your choice,  and then
 
you can settle back into what Gershon Legrnan has referred to as  "
the
 
great peace of non-understanding".
 (Legman,  p
.  2P5)
 fut the
 
functionalist position, as enuncia ted
 by kalinonsfi,  i
S most denandine.
 
The functional view of culture lays down the
 
principle that in every type of civilization,
 
every custom, material object,  idea and bli f
 
fulfills some vital function, has s o me  task to
 
accomplish, represents an indispens ible part
 
within a working whole.
 (Bronislaw :
Ialinowski,
 
quoted in Lardiner & Pre 
hie,  p
.  ]
il).
 
I this i
s true -
-
 and i believe at trio  Least  it represents
 
a sensible working premise
 
it suggests, by extension, that ther
 
should be some degree of appropriateness between a function and t
ie
 
group of items a culture uses to fulfill that function.  This qual
 
of appropriateness may be found on the level of form, structure, conret't
 
and/or stylistics; and the degree of appropriateness is easily reco'-
n
izod by carriers of the culture.
 Both Mrs. Jones and her mother,
 
ror example, seemed to feel a certain lack of f
irmeor htw
n the
 
form and content of "Casey Jones" and the f n  icr of  '
utt1ri  a batv

ri - 
nation of the cultural norms governing the rather bizarre congregation
 
of items that American adults seem to choose to fulfill the function
 
of getting a young child or infant ready to go to sleep.
 I r
rer
 
nretend that the examination is exhaustive, and I will concentrate
 
nai nly on problems ot text  but there are at leasr three stylistic
 
qualifiers which I feel must be briefly mentioned.
 
One is rhythm.
 American parents seem to rely heavily on a
 
straightforward, non-complex, swaying meter, normally four/four, to
 
produce a suitably quieting effect.
 Lest this be dismissed as a pan-
human trait,  I might mention that A.M. Jones describes a method of
 
soothing sleepless babies used by the Ewe people of West Africa, which
 
relies on a complex, ultimately syncopated rhythm.
 Apparently, Ewe
 
parents can no more stand a crying Là y than can their American cousins
 
the mother will take the baby's hands and the father his feet and they
 
swing him between them, hammock fashion, in a slow wide arc, with a
 
pause at the top of every third swing.

 I have never tried this with a

at least he would be stimulated, rather than soothed, by such actions.

A second stylistic qualifier has to do with  the pattern t
ng
 
of preferred phonemic choices, especial4y
 apparent in humming
 
or the use of nonsense syllables.
 Alan Lomax and the linguist Edith
 
Crowell iragor,  in an investigation of the possibility that folk song
 
areas may prove to be definable in part in terms of vowel and conso-
nantal preference patterns, turn their attention briefly to lullabies.
 
Lomax, in his introduction to their study, remarks
 
pain is a region of lullaby singing -
-
 often rare
 
in other parts of the world.
 Each lullaby has a
 
refrain consisting of a characteristic set of Syl-
lables.
 In recording soores of lullabies,  I observed
 
that the effect of lullabies on the child was to put
 
it to sloop even when the singing took place during
 
a recording session in the presence of the entire
 
village.
 There was a marked change from northern
 
to southern Spain in terms of the vowel sot cornposin'
 
the lullaby refrain, and it occurred to me that
 
perhaps vowel preferences were implanted by mothers
 
in their children during infancy and that these
 
patterns helped to shape the development of adult
 
folk song.
 (Lomax & Trager, 2-3)
 
though the Lomax/Trager study primarily centers on adult foll
'
 
song,  it would seem on the basis of the extensive Spanish data they
 
report that this hypothesis may be verifiable.
 I am unable to pursue
 
this interesting suggestion here, primarily because comparable data
 
i
s simply not available; however, there are sone  associated observations
 
to he ma -ye,
 
''

 on  the whole,  in oontr st

described in spain, fit our generally wordy adult singing style and
 
do not really emphasize nonsense syllables.
 However, there is evidence
 
both in the Valley State and the Berkeley archives that much non-verbal
 
'
tnging, usually described as "humming", takes place in the lullab
 
context.
 Brahma' lullaby is reported frequently, for example, but
 
generally in fragmentary form, since apparently few people choose t
 
remember the syrupy English translation.
 My hunch is that: a nurhcr o
 
other tunes are also typically sung without words, and that n
onsense
 
syllables, such as "doe doe' or "na na" are used rather than huinmin?.
 
t is the rare collector who reports such non-word-centered data.
 
f the information were available, however, it would surprise me if
 
t did not evince regional or sub-cultural patterning, in view of
 
the longevity and persistence of some nonsense refrains in other  enros
 
of folksong,
 
final stylistic qualifier has to do with the fact that
 
singing stems from a larger pattern of social intercourse.
 A song
 
i
s a communicative act and has some degree of fit with the overall
 
cormiuntcativo style of the society.
 (Lomaxi 1969)  A recent cross-
cultural study (Caudill and Weinstein) details the results of an
 
intensive examination of the interactional patterns between Japanese
 
below
 
mothers and their infants
 the ago of four montc , as contrasted
 
with those of American mothers and their infants of the same ape ranae.
 
I
n the course of this research, observers visited in the homes and
 
noted the amount of time the various mothers spent feeding, holdirii,
 
rocking their babies, etc., as well as the kind of behavior the babies
 
were engaging in at the same time.
 
In the sphere of oral communication,  the babies'  actions
 
were classified as either "happy vocalizing" or
 
i( C.
 
w t
h i3 eems reasonably obvious,
 The description of the mothers'
 
vurha!  behavior is more tnter stin .

variable and means that the caretaker is softly
 
singing or humming a ly f
laby, or making repetit L'•
 
comfortin noises, with the apparent intent of
 
soothing and quieting the baby or getting him to
 
go to sleep.
 "Chats" includes all other vocali-
zations to the inf ant,  such as talking to him,
 
singing to him in a lively fashion, and playing wor ,
 
g a mes,  such as "boo" and "goo" with him.
 (Caudill
 
&Weinstein, 23,)
 
fho selection of the term "chat" s e ems  significant.
 I
t
 
has frequently been noted that American parents place an extremely
 
high value on their children learning to speak at a very early age,
 
and many studies indicate a high correlation between early speech
 
and a large amount of parental stimulation through verbal inter-
action with the baby.  Although Japanese and American mothers s nd
 
almost exactly the same total amount of time "talking to" thetr
 
Lnfants, their communicative styles are significantly diff r'r
1T.
 
n  the basis of adjusted mean frequencies, the ratio of "chats"
 
to ­l ulls" for the Japanese mother was 79 to 221 comparable srati rics
 
for the American mother show a ratio of 120 "chats" to 3 "lulls" -
-
a rpal
.ly striking disproportion.
 (Caudill and Weinstein, P
. 29.
 
Further, in terms of the interaction between mother and
 
c-ild,  there is a stron' c o rr 'l ati on  between

 Space does not permit going into
 
all the ramifications of this stur!v, but  the author.; conclude in
 
summary that the Japanese mother
 
.
..does more lulling, carrying and rocking of her
 
iaby.
 She seems to try to soothe and quiet the
 
child and to communicate with him physically ratl-r
r
 
than verbally.
 On the other hand the American...
 
mother in her care does more looking at and chatT:t
 
to her baby.
 She seems to stimulate the baby to
 
activity and to vocal response.
 It is as if the
 
\
merican mother wanted to have a vocal, active baby,
 
and the Japanese mother wanted to have a quiet, con-
tented baby.
 In terms of the styles of caretaking
 
of the mothers in the two cultures, they seem to get
 
what they apparently want...
 (Caudill and We$ 8tein,
 
The wide range of subject matter selected by the American
 
lullaby singer becomes less puzzling.
 The chatting style of  inter-
i
ction, associated, as it is, with "happy vocalizing" on the part c
f
 
rho infant, is carried into the bedtime context.
 And as the chile
 
oarns to speak and can, so to say, "chat" back arH aJ  t
 or v at
 
wants to hear, he is already adjusted to a commuri
.o tioo
 f
r-
the parent that is far-ranging in subject matter, cheerful and emotion-
ally perhaps a bit dispassionate.
 In my own experience with putting
 
two and three year olds to bed,  I found that at that age they actively
 
resist "lulling" but are so enamored of the "chatting" style tha , t
! e
 
form possibly the only audience in the United States today that is
 
openly enthusiastic over the traditional ballad.

 emotionally direct:  (the least:  "chatt
 
of all the sub lects deta Ulecl by hiss Brakelev.
 
Two of the songs  (
"-tll the pretty Little Horses" and "Hush,
 
Little Baby") might: be categorized  as containing bribes for good
 
behavior; on closer exanination,  their promises are simple predictions
 
"bhen you wake, you shall have..." and "Papa's going to buy you...".
 
Again,  the emotional formulation is oblique, rather than direct.
 These
 
two songs also suggest a future-orientation; mostly,  though,  American
 
lullabies are set in present time, filled with descriptive ter -,
i
s about
 
the surroundings and the activities of various people.
 
And it is hero that we reach the SirY le most cbara
.cteristic
 
quality I have been able to discover within the lexical content of
 
American lullabies:  the spatial isolation of the baby.
 All the peoglo
 
around hin in song are actually somewhere else -
-
 shaking dreamland
 
trees,  gone h-unting, out watching sheep, or what have you.
 Baby,
 
meanwhile,  is up in a tree,  or sailing
, off in a boat na
.de out of the
 
moon,  or driving away with his  "prett'i little horses".
 hhen he does
 
sleep, he is described as being in a place called "dreamland" which,
 
wherever it is,  clearly isn't: his own bed; and he is variously  roques Led
 
or ordered to take himself to that "land of Nod" by the linguistic
 
convention which requires English-speakers to '
 to sleep".  Even the

:erS seem to spend almost the same amount of tine in cGre-tehin
 
activities when their babies are awake.
 During the hours of sleep,
 
however,
 he Japanese mother tends to continue her care-taking at a
.
 
leisurely noce,  and thus sbo scores bi' h in such factors as rochire
 
 
I
 
carrying and holding t
ile sleeping baby.
 The
 erican mother, o
r: t
:1
--
-
other hand, only  scores high in "looking at" her sleeping infant.
 
This is because, as the investigators point: out, she has ordinarily
 
gone out of the room as soon as  (
or before) the baby has fallen
 
asleep; she then returns from time to time to dance throu h the door
 
at him.
 (Caudill and Weinstein,  pps. 38-9)
 
"When the bough breaks,  the cradle will fall..."
 Perhaps
 
it is not too fanciful to suggest that that moment of high spatial
 
drama which concludes  the most popular of all English-langua
 
lu labies
 
simply pres ages, for the modern American baby,  the closing of the
 
bedroom door.
 There are not many other societies besides ours in the
 
world which hold to the belief that babies sboul( 1 sleep alone.

Nor what: can we make of all this?  In his dround_breatin:
 
essay,  "Four Functions of Folklore",  William ]
3ascon has pointed out
 
that one of the functions of traditional oral expression is to allow
 
the individual to say what is otherwise unsayable in his society,
 
to release his feelings of hostility,  tension or anger in a depersonalized
 
and therefore sanctionable way.
 In terms of this thesis, must we then
 
conclude that Xnericnn mothers are really express inn

images of  earation in
 
our lullabies are so gently expressed, surroundE
 
and blunted as they are with words of comfort and warmth.
 I do believe
 
that thi lullaby singer feels tens ions,  and  that the songs she sings
 
express those tensions with a kind of excuisit  econor  ; but the source

Edmund Leach, a mo ng  o
t h e r s ,

o l l o
w i n g
 the general thrust
 
of
 
a et's studies, has pointed out that one of the first probiei s
 
facing an infant is  to discover the delimits of his own body,  to
 
determine what is himself and what i
s outside, or separate from, hits.
 
(Leach,  pps 34-6)
 It has occurred to me to wonder if the post-partum
 
mother does not face the same problem in reverse.
 Her baby,  after
 
all, once a part of her own body,  is now permanent:ly and forever
 
separate.
 
This experience,  of course,  is common to all mothers in
 
all so CL eti Cs,  but American culture puts what I sun eect to be an un us ua l
 
amount of separation strain on the mother.
 On the one hand,  she i
SUS t
 
train her baby to be the active, exploratory, happily vocalizing -
-
in sun,  independent -
 -
 little character that our culture prefers.
 
On the other hand,  she must do this,  in the main, without assistance
 
from anybody else;  for our society is almost unique in its insistence
 
that mothers -
-
 and mothers alone -
-
 must take care of their babies.
 
(Stephens: 366-370)
 Thus she must simultaneously try to separate he.-
baby from herself, making him independent,  self -re li
ant and strong
 
(for in America, every tub stands on its own bottom,  they say), while
 
at the sa ne  time she remains in maximum physical proxi 1Ly to his.
 
No wonder American mothers talk to thoir babies
 
more
 
especially,  probably,  to themselves -
-
 about separation and space and
 
going very far a way.
 I always found myself that rocking a baby to Sl ee p

Dear Mr. Dissanayake:
 
Almost a year ago, Professor Wayland Hand of the Institute of Folklore
 
and Mythology at the University of California, Los Angeles, forwarded
 
a note from you requesting articles on the subject of lullabies.
 
In the hope that you are still interested in the topic, I am sending
 
you the enclosed essay which I have just completed.  It does
 t represent
 
a finished research effort; rather, it contains a few ideas o?
I" ontent and
 
function of lullabying which have occurred to me over the year  and which
 
I thought might be useful or stimulating to others.
 I should be most
 
interested in your reactions.
 
iv the way, I have submitted my article to the Journal
 of  American
 Folklore,
 
though I have as yet no idea whether or not the editor will find it acceptable
 
for publication.  Should the Journal reject it, however, I will try one or
 
another of the regional folklore publications; until it is published, I
 
suppose it should not be quoted from, so as to avoid any mix-up in publica-
tion and l
iterary rights.  However, after you have read it, if you find any
 
part that would be of use to you, please let me know, and I am sure something
 
can be worked out.  Frankly, I suspect you may find my essay a bit naive,
 
especially considering the far greater amount of research into lullabies
 
that I gather you have done.
 
I should be most happy if you could let me know what direction your own
 
thoughts are taking on this topic, or perhaps you have an article you could
 
send?  And if there is any l
ittle academic chore that I could help you with
 
in the United States, I hope you will let me know.
 
Cordially yours,

Dear Mr. Dissanayake:
 
Your letter of last Janu
sry found its way into a cache of unans
red
 
mail, and
. I am a bit embarrassed about writing you at this late date.
 
Our UCLA library does not have much on lullabies, but I em enclosing
 
the names of four titles that may be useful to you.
 
Professor Bees Lomax Haves,
, Department of Anthropology, California
 
State University, Northridge, California, 9l 21, has been working on
 
American lullabies for some time, and no doubt knows 'a good bit about
 
g
eneral bibliography in the field.  I am sending her a copy of this letter,
 
together with the original of your letter to me for mhat help she can give.
 
Good luck and
. I hope your work tu
rns out well.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Bess Hawes,
 
I've just come across and read your
 
"Folksongs and Function" in the Journal of
 
Am. Folklore, and I couldn't resist telling
 
you how fascinating (
and c
harming) I found
 
it.  Not only did I find it informative,
 
I didn't even mind the "hunches", because
 
they seem to me to be perfectly good ones.
 
It was a real pleasure to read it.
 
Best,
