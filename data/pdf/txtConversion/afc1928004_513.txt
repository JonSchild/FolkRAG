Good health and good nature, 
When brought side by side 
Are champions of real merriinent,

Ne'er begrudges the penny well spent 
For a

They couldn't find fault 
With that which turns sorrow to cheer; 
Get a

glass 
And let the toast pass, 
And drink from your pitcher of beer. 
Each night, etc 
Be social and merry, 
For life's but a 
day, 
We die and leave others behind: 
To fret and to worry, 
To sigh and to pray, 
When relief they could easy find. 
If they draw up a 
chair 
And drive away care, 
Have a 
friend with his pipe sitting near. 
Tell a 
story or two, 
Let it be old or new, 
And drinic from their pitcher of beer. 
Each night, etc,

Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, come back to me, 
But cold is the welcome you now give to me; 
Is there nought, then, in parting, or nought in long 
years, 
Is there nought then in absence, I've mourned too with 
tears ? 
For the gold of the stranger you have left me in pain, 
For the jewel of hope I 
have come back again: 
But 'tis only to meet thee, like a 
dew-drop from high, 
With the sunbeam it loved, then heart-broken to die. 
Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, turn not away, 
Sure 'tis joking you are in the sunshine to-day, 
Yet now Iwould be pleasant to meet -with a 
smile, 
To show you were laughing and loving the while. 
Oh, let me not lose all my dreams of the past, 
The hope of the future, where joy, too, is cast; 
Let thy love be my lamp, and I'll worship its light. 
Till the heart that's illumed be hushed in dark night. 
Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, come back to me, 
Oh, give, then, mavourneen, kind welcome to me.

HIGGINS' COTERIE. 
Words by EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
MUSIC 
by JAMES E. 
STL-WART. 
• Music published by J. L. PETERS, New York. Price 35 cents, 
Mike Higgins gave a 
party at Military Hall. - 
He cave a 
aTand reception, likewise a 
fancy ball; 
The rosetees were silken, the invitations free, 
The proudest couple on the floor, was Dan and Nell 
McGee 
Cuomis. 
Then hands across, forward four, 
Now then, boys, let's welt the floor, 
For never a 
waltz or a 
mazurkee, 
Was allowed by the Coterie. 
We marched around the room at the sound of the 
cornet. 
Fardowns and bold Corkonians, so pleasantly they 
met; 
Councillor McMullin, myself and Nell McGee, 
Led off the solid column at Higgins' Coterie. 
Then we marched down to supper in 'ristocratic style, 
The coaches on the outside would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled were the pride of our city, 
The solid men men from ey'ry- ward were at Higgins' 
Coterie. 
Reporters from the Herald, the Tribune and the sun, 
Took the names of all the ladies just when the ball 
begun; 
The Haley's and the Daleys, myself and Nell McGee, 
Were paraded in the papers from Higgins' Coterie. 
There was Burns the big distiller, McBride the alder-
man, 
And a 
wealthy Cuban lady with diamonds on her hand. 
She walk'd around the ball-room like a 
queen of high 
degree, 
All the wealth was represented at Higgins' Coterie. 
At six o'clock next morning the band played Patrick's 
Day, 
In horse-cars and in stages the crowd all went away; 
It pulverized poor Higgins, and kill'd his family, 
lie's living on free-lunches since he gave the Coterie.

SITTING BULL. 
Written and sung with ireat success by ED. RARRIGAN. 
• 'Tis just one hundred years ago we met John Bull, 
Esquire; 
We made him trip Yankee Doodle do to a 
continential 
choir. 
It.t- this late day the people say we've got our fingers 
full 
Of Indian hair, and Indian scare from the big chief, 
Sitting Bull. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, dat redskin ingun cuss, we're hunting for his 
wool, 
If I 
had him for a 
cigar store sign, I'd carve old Sit-
ting Bull. 
They say he's had the small pox bad, was chewed up 
by a 
bear, 
His eyes are like two calcium lights, with daggers in 
his hair. 
He drinks red blood for lager beer, you never can get 
him full, 
He's a 
sixteen carrot Cannibal, old Slaughter-house 
Sitting Bull. 
CHORUS. 
But oh! the gawk-eyed, blue wash cur, his scalp I'd 
like to pull, 
If I 
had him in the 14th ward I'd carve old Sitting Bull. 
Our country lost a 
patriot, brave Custer we will moan, 
His memory will live forever green, when you and I 
are gone. 
He fought against o'erwhelming odds, laid many an 
Indian low, 
And when brave Custer met his death, our country 
met a 
blow. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, dat redskin Injun cuss, we're bound to take 
his wool, 
And to avenge gallant Custer's death we'll scalp old 
Sitting Bull.

RISING MAN. 
Written and sung by EDWARD HARRIGAN in Bartley Campbell's orig-
inal play of the " Rising Man." 
Old country people say. 
Where there's will there is a 
way, 
So I've kept it in my memory all the while; 
Throwing care unto the dogs, 
Oh, I 
bundled up my togs, 
And sailed away from Erin's lovely isle; 
To America in the west. 
Of nations she's the best. 
Then take my advice, my countrymen. 
And listen to my plan. 
Save your money, buy a 
passage 
Cross the western ocean; 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man, 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man. 
Oh, the land is mighty broad, 
With the divil a 
duke or lord 
To make you bend your knee to his rule; 
Where your children have a 
chance 
In learning to advance, 
Free education there in any school; 
Poor old Ireland, oh-oh-hone, 
I 
have heard your people moan. 
They have suffered sad privation 
Ever since the world began; 
Throw off the yoke of tyrany. 
Come over to Uncle Sam, 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man, 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man. 
Oh, the day is drawing near 
When a 
signal you shall hear 
Which will send a 
thrill of gladness o'er the sea; 
As a 
million Irish hearts 
From America departs, 
'Twill make the lion tremble in his knee; 
With money and with brains 
To handle all the reins, 
Ready for to fight it out, 
Or settle it with the pen. 
So take advice, my countrymen, 
And cross the western ocean, 
Be an American citizen, 
And join the rising man.

CONEY ISLE. 
Written by En. lias.axasx 
At de German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of the different kinds of Mermaids, 
And hear them yell and screech, 
While flopping in the water, 
AisConey Island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A 
swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Mackerelvine, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like naids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Young man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-lm 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could he, 
Taking in thEir maiden wash, 
A 
swimming in the sea.

All the biggest politicians, 
The fattest and the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Could'nt wash them clean. 
Barnum's big fat woman 
Swam over to a

All the buoys in the water 
Would'nt make her float. 
There were Hannahs and Johannahs, 
Maria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers. 
Who came from Brooklyn town, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be, 
Eat chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea.

An Amusing Anecdote of Mr. Edward Harrigan 
When Counselor Michael J. O'Brien whipped out a 
play-bin of Theatre Comique in the Tombs on the 
morning of Wednesday, December 14th, 1878, -and 
held it up in front of Justice Kilbreth, with a 
flashing 
eye and gestures of great excitement, his Honor look-
ed extremely surprised and didn't quite know what it 
all meant. 
"Do you see this?" said the counselor, slashing 
down his fist on the lower end of the bill: " Look 
Out for O'Brien the Lawyer!" 
That was the way in which the theatre made the 
announcement of a 
forthcoming dramatic sketch. 
Justice Kilbreth suggested to the counselor that he 
had better apply to one of the higher courts for an in, 
junction, and with a 
look that plainly answered "You 
just bet yout life I 
will," Counselor O'Brien pocketed 
the play- bill and turned to the reporter. 
"I shall make application to Justice Brady." he 
said. " He's a 
friend of mine. I 
want to find if there's 
any law in the land, and if there is, I 
want it." 
Mr. O'Brien was dreadfully in earnest. He felt that 
he was about to be turned to ridicule in a 
variety 
theatre, and he didn't intend to stand it. 
His indi-
viduality was his own, he said, and as such he held a 
copyright on it that no blank blank theatre had any 
right to infringe upon. 
- 
But how do you know." asked the reporter, after 
the venerable lawyer had drawn a double-barrelled 
breath, " that it is you whom the theatre is to de-
pict?" 
"How do I 
know?" was the retort, with a 
leverage 
on the word " know " that almost lifted the reporter 
off his feet. " Why, didn't I 
see Harrigan in court 
several mornings in succession, with his eye on me all 
the time. 
It puzzled me at first; but I 
saw him not-
ing my dress, my actions, and I 
have been informed 
that he has been quietly rehearsing my alleged accent. 
What might has any man," the lawyer added, it may 
be with just a 
touch of the brogue laid on for this oc-

(Continued.) 
easion only, " to make shport wid me personality. 
What does a play-actor bike that know about an 
Oirish gentleman, anyway ?" 
Mr. O'Brien further volunteered the information 
that he suspected that Mr. Harrigan, .after noticing 
that his espionage was observed, had entered the 
courtroom in various disguises to carry out his din-
bolical schemes. 
He even suspected that a case of 
"drunk and disorderly," whom he had himself de-
fended the other day, was the actor. He was strength-
ened in his suspicion by the extreme readiness with 
which the fine imposed was paid. 
"But," pleaded the reporter, by way of pacification, 
" 
after all, Mr. O'Brien, there's no use hi getting mad 
about the thing; 
Don't you think it will be a good 
advertisement for you?" 
"Advertisement be blanked!" gasped the counselor. 
I 
shall get an injunction. 
Do you think I 
want to be 
advertised as a 
fakir and a 
ninecompoop?" 
These last two words were so extremely technical 
that the reporter did not venture any further argu-
ment, and leaving Mr. O'Brien in his full conviction 
that the dramatic sketch was a libel prepared with 
malice prepence and aforethought, the reporter sought 
out Mr. Edward Harrigan, author of " O'Brien the 
Lawyer," in which interlude he was to sustain the prin-
cipal part. 
It was in the evening that Mr. Edward Harrigan 
was found in his dressing-room at the Theatre Comi-
que making up. 
The reporter pounced upon him just 
as he was polishing off his nose with a 
dot of red, and 
asked him what he meant by hurting Counselor 
O'Brien's feelings. 
Mr. Harrigan looked at the re-
porter with an expression of childish simplicity. 
He 
was fairly dazed at the idea of the Tombs barrister 
being about to interfere with his programme. 
"Then don't you mean to take him off ?"
suggested 
the reporter, 
" 
Take him off? 
Why, my dear sir, I 
wrote thiali

sketch last week, and I 
wanted a 
good name for an 
Irish lawyer, and so I 
hit upon 
Blackstone O'Brien: 
Is it my fault that some gentleman's name,is Brien? 
For my part I 
should feel perfectly satisfied if he 
called himself Fitzhugh McGillicuddy." 
And with 
this generous concession, Harrigan greased his Thes-
pian chin with cold cream, 
" 
But Mr. O'Brien claims that you hare been in 
court on purpose to copy his every look and action." 
Mr. Harrigan looked at the reporter with a 
very 
peculiar look. 
It may have been despair, or it may 
have been guilt.. 
" 
I 
guess he must have mistaken a 
fellow that looks 
like me. 
There's an Italian chestnut dealer in Chat-
ham street who looks so much like me, that he's kept 
busy all day refusing dead-head tickets for this show! 
But is Mr. O'Brien, your hero, made particularly 
objectionable, Mr. Harrigan— ii he, whoever he may 
be, a 
kind of a 
man not calculated to reflect honor 
and credit on his profession ?" 
" 
On the contrary," said Mr Harrigan, buttoning 
his suspender, ''he's a 
lawer to be proud of. 
There's 
nothing snide ' about him. Why, in one of the scenes 
there's a ranch pulled, called the Doves' Nest, and 
O'Brien becomes the counsel in defence of the doves, 
In a 
true spirit of manly protection. 
Bless you, he's 
a 
noble lawyer! 
He's specially retained by the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. What 
more could you want? 
If Mr. O'Brien of the Tombs 
wants to fight the theatre, let him fight. 
Blackstone 
O'Brien isn't afraid, and you bet your life, my boy, 
he'll hog 'em." 
By way of elucidation the comedian explained the 
effect on the audience, by adding: " He'll paralyze 
them, my boy, paralyze them,"

Mit a

Den I

Und like a

She set up oof mine knee. 
Den I

Und I

To make sausages by steam.

Und while he was standing dare,

Dem sausages begin to dance, 
And jump around der room. 
Now something vas der matter, 
Dat machine it wouldn't go, 
So Dunderbeck he crawled insite, 
To find dat out you know ; 
His wife she took de nightmare, 
And went walking in her sleep, 
She gave dat crank one awful yank,

SUE AND I. 
Written by En. HARRIGAN especially for JAS. BRADLEY. 
We went on a 
picnic, Sue and I, 
'Twas a 
high-toned colored affair, 
We had lots of spruce beer and pie, 
All dandy barbers they were there. 
We danced in the quadrille to and fro, 
The waltz and mazourka, to charm, 
When she whispered "You're my own dearest Joe," 
And she leaned like a 
zephyr on my arm. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never shall forget my Sue, 
Like a 
weasel, oh jolly, she's sly ! 
And it's mighty high per coon, 
Of a 
Sunday afternoon, 
As we promenade, Sue and I, 
We arrived and landed from the boat, 
Ebenezer Thompson walked behind, 
He catehed me by the swallow-tail coat, 
I 
told him that he wasn't very kind. 
He pulled a 
razor to put out my light, 
Jealousy was beaming in his eye, 
My Sue fell in the gutter in a 
fright, 
And the other niggers wenches began to cry. 
I 
never shall forget, etc, 
sing of my girl, ray lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce ; 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash-tub she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear, 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts down at the people. 
A 
rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, 
The gal wid the Injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher sez " now den I'll tie her ;" 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she pop-
ped 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer, 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump 
She got on dat big rubber bustle. 
By NED HARRIGAN, for WALTERS & MORTON. 
We're a 
loose and careless pair of nigs, 
We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our understandings are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense. 
That's where we both grab ground. 
CHORUS. 
So watch this curlicue, (Symp.) 
Oh, ain't it fun for you, (Symp.) 
For with a 
bound we bounce around. 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations. 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility ; 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays things loose around, 
Here's what knocks—electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
So watch this, etc. 
To our lady friends we did intend 
To say a 
word or two, 
If nothing more than au-revoir, 
Or girls, how do you do ? 
But we know they will excuse us, 
And won't give us a 
frown ; 
For among the dears we have no fears, 
Of losing any ground. 
So watch this, etc.

An' be a

Oh, Irish boys and girls, draw near, 
We'd whisper soft to ye ; 
The way we love, like turtle doves 
Upon a 
bush or tree. 
Between there's no conceit, 
Oh, it really is a 
treat, 
To sit beside the flowing tide, 
Of the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
CHORUS. 
Killarney, (Sym.) Killarney, och hone, 
Oh, beautiful Killarney. 
They say America's mighty great, 
And has its brooks and lakes, 
A man might live in royal state, 
Be fed on ducks and drakes; 
But here we'll be content, 
As long as we have our rent, 
And stay at home, and never roam 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
Killarney, etc. 
The little spec that's on the sea. 
They call it Ireland, 
It's large enough to shelter we, 
And for it we do stand ; 
For the Lord above is just, 
At some future day we must 
Rule every mile in that happy isle, 
Where flows the sweet Killarney. 
Killarney, etc.

Oh, the Higginbottom Sisters are here, 
We came from New Hampshire, 
We feel tarnation queer, 
Our bosoms are wrapped in fire. 
We're descendants from the real old stock, 
Who landed on Columbia's shore, 
Way down thar on Plymouth Rock. 
Where the waves and breakers roar. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Higginbottom, 
We declare it's really shocking— 
There's no young fellow in the neighborhood 
Will marry a 
Higginbottom. 
Oh, the world in its wicked ways, 
Has caused us many a 
pain; 
We don't want any praise, 
Or exaltation or fame. 
Our ancestors did shed their blood, 
In the revolutionary war . 
They perished like a 
flower in the bud, 
Oh, you might have heard it before. 
Oh, Higginbottom, etc. 
CHATHAM STREET SQUARE. 
Written by Ea HARRIGAN. 
I 
landed from Ireland quite rosy and fat, 
In the ship Robert Walker, wid Mary and Pat; 
From swate Castle Garden to Broadway I 
wint 
Te see the great city, I 
hadn't a 
chit. 
-Whin I 
got to the park, shure I 
saw a 
big light, 
'Twas the clock in the steeple that lighted the night; 
Whin I 
crossed over the street, oh, great trouble was 
there, 
'Twas Jews sellin' coats down in Chatham St. Square. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the great trouble, oh, the great trouble, 
The trouble of passing down Chatham Street Square. 
There was Yankees an' Frincinnen, an' Prussians an' 
Dutch, 
Was axing one question, an' that was `• how much?" 
Money was wanted for jackets and coats, 
That the Jews warranted was from skins of the goats; 
Such bundles of clothes ' twas a 
sight for to see, 
Whin convaniently some one caught hold of me; 
I 
turned an' I 
looked—I 
was met with a 
stare— 
'Twas a 
Jew sellin' clothes down in Chatham Street 
Square. 
I 
wint in the store 'es green as new grass, 
For ould Nebacodnezzer himself couldn't pass; 
Nothin' would do me but try on a 
suit, 
Wid a 
pair of suspinders and collars to boot. 
Thin I 
axed the Hebrew if he gave any trust, 
At the same time I 
stretched, an' the coat gave a 
bust, 
nth he wanted tin dollors at once for the fare, 
Which created a 
ruction in chatham Street Square. 
They called me a 
Paddy, an' many hard names, 
They brought in a 
crowd for to spill out my brains; 
'Twas thin I 
got mad, an' I 
soon did begin 
To put heads on the blaggards just as they come in, 
Whid all of a 
sudden such a 
welt did I 
meet, 
I 
wint over their heads clear into the street; 
Wid a 
new suit on my back, shure what did I 
care, 
There's where I 
got even on Chatham Street Square.

My pretty Jane! my pretty Jane, 
Ali, never look so shy; 
But meet me in the evening, 
While the bloom is on the rye. 
The spring is warfeing fast, my love, 
The corn is in the ear, 
The summer nights are coming, love, 
The moon shines bright and clear.

Ah, never look so shy;

SOMEBODY'S coming when the dew drops fall; 
Somebody's coming for a

He Will be welcome to fife best of all, 
So I'll keep a 
little kiss for him! 
We are happy as the day is long, 
And no one shall ever make us sad; 
For he's coming, coming quickly, 
And I 
will meet him when the dew drops fall. 
CHORUS. 
Somebody's coming, coining quickly! 
Coming when the little dew drops fall—darling, 
You will be welcome to the best of all, 
I'll keep a 
little kiss for you! 
Somebody's coining when the stars grow bright; 
Somebody's coming with a 
smile to-night; 
Roses will listen for his footsteps light, 
And the nightingale will sing to him! 
I 
will meet him at the garden gate, 
To tell him the secret once again; 
For he's coming, coming quickly, 
And I 
will meet him when the dew drops fall. 
Somebody's coming, etc. 
Somebody's coining with a 
heart so true; 
And he will whisper in the twilight, too, 
One little story that is new, 
'Tis the one I 
always love to hear. 
Hark! he's coining, for I 
hear his song. 
The sweetest, the gayest ef them all! 
For he's coming, coming quickly, 
And I 
will meet him when the dew drops fall. 
Somebody's coming, etc.

CHEER UP, SAM; OR, SARAH BELL. 
Oh! down in Alabama, 
Before I 
was set free, . 
I 
loved a 
dark-eyed yellow girl, 
And thought that she loved me; 
But she has proved inconstant, 
And left me here to tell 
De sorrow dat my heart feels 
For deceitful Sarah Bell. 
CHORUS. 
Cheer up, Sam! don't let your spirits go down, 
For dere's many a 
belle 
Dat you know well, 
is looking for you in de town. 
I 
had not much to give her; 
Yet, all I 
got I 
gave— 
But wealth and fortune don't belong 
To one dat's born a 
slave. 
A 
white man came with dollars; 
She fled with him to dwell, 
And broke de vows she made to me, 
Oh! perjured Sarah Bell! 
Cheer up, Sam, etc. 
Now, all day while I'm working 
And hoeing up de corn, 
I 
sigh and wish within myself, 
I 
never had been born— 
Perhaps she's gay and happy, 
Wherever she may dwell, 
While my poor heart is breaking 
For deceitful Sarah Bell! 
Cheer up, Sam, etc. 
THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU.

published by F. W .

Ohio. 
THE subject of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share; 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN. — I 
explained the matter to her the other 
I 
evening, and when I 
had finished, she looked into 
- 
my face this way, and said, that's nothing— 
On onus. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you. 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes.

THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU. 
(Concluded.) 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said, what do you wish here? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you,-
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And ray burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN. --Yes; I 
shall haunt her day and night, if 
it's only to hear her say--:-
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you. 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you,

RING THE BELL SOFTLY. 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid._ 
-Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore, 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is rEsting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in, 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams has brought us their light. 
Weary with sowing, and never to reap, 
-Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Heaven's glad shore, 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, etc. 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet 
One who walks with them in Heaven's bright street; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
Free frem earth's trials, and taking sweet rest. 
Yes, there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, etc.

THE COBBLER. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH, with great success. 
Ochl my name is Dick Dar/in' the cobbler, 
My time I 
served down there in Kent; 
Some say I'm an old fornicator, 
But now I'm resolved to repent. 
For twenty years I'd been a 
rover, 
An' wasted the prime of my life, 
One day I 
resolved to give over, 
And settle myself down to a 
wife. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
got married, an' be d—n 
to me. 
Now, upon my sow!, a 
woman is the most obstroper-
ous and outrageous creature on the face of the earth! 
Before I 
was married whinever I'd go among 'em 
they'd be fighting for me; an' when I 
married one of 
them, in the hopes to be quiet and peaceable, d—n 
the day she'd be a!sy if she wasn't fightin' wid me. 
Now, I'll give ye the contents av my oath, that be-
fore I 
was married, there wasn't a 
nicer, quieter, da-
center, bether disposed, or meeker disposition'd boy 
than myself; but since I'd married, be gob! if I 
didn't 
get into a 
bit of a 
fight now an' then, I 
go mouldy. 
An' divil a 
fight iver I 
was in or heard tell of, but a 
'woman was at the top, the bottom, both sides an' in 
the middle of it. 
My wife she was blinkin' and blearin', 
Ey wife she was humpy- 
and black, 
The divil all over for swearin', 
And her tongue kept going click clack. 
SPOKEN'. — Bad luck to me, if iver I 
could tell how 
a 
woman's tong 
is hung at all! 
We all know that 
a man's tcngue is hung by one ind, but bad scran to 
me if I 
don't think that a 
woman's tongue is hung be 
the middle, an' no sooner one ind strikes the upper 
part of her jaw, but the other ind hits the lower, an' 
there it is, upper and lower, the whole day peltin', till 
at last I'd hey to give her a 
welt in the gob wid my 
last to stop her; an' thin she'd run out of the cellar, 
roarin' " Watch! watch! watch! here's this murderin' 
villain, he's 
mei He's give me a welt in the

THE COBBLER. 
(Concluded.) 
gob wid his last, an' he's broke the collar bone of me. 
A— rew, wirrastew what'll I 
do?" 
An' thin, widout 
waitin' for anyone to tell her what to do, she'd uig 
wid a 
brick an' let's drive at me. 
I 
can dodge it aisy 
enough 'cause I'm used to it; but another poor divil 
there standin' by, an' not sayiii' a word to anybody, 
he got it plump in the mug. 
Up comes the police an' 
walks the three av us off for assault and bathery, an' 
d—n 
the one got bothered but the poor divil who 
had nothin' to do wid it. 
But that's the way of it— 
evil communications corrupt good manners. 
But now we are parted foriver, 
One morning before it was light, 
I 
shov'd the old jade in the river, 
And cautiously bid her good night! 
My troubles of wedlock bein' over, 
This country I 
thought I 
would tit; 
Once more I've become a 
free rover, 
An' single I'll stop till I 
die. 
SPOKEN.—A fellow come into me shop the other 
day. " Dick," says he. " Sir," says I. " I'll bet you 
three dollars to one," says he, " that I 
can sole three 
pair of boots while you sole one." " You can't," says 
I. 
"Will you bet?" says he. 
"I 
will," says I. 
"Done!" says he. " Done!" says I; and to work we 
wint. 
An' after I'd bate him, as an Irishman ought 
to do, the dirty bla'kguard wouldn't pay me. 
But 
maybe I 
hadn't satisfaction out of him? I 
wint out 
an' bate him. I 
bate him till I 
was blind as a 
bat. I 
bate him till I 
broke nearly all the bones in my body, 
an' they had to carry me home on a shutther. 
He 
come to me aftherwards, an' says he, " You ought to 
pay me somethin'. 
Didn't I 
give you a 
practical les-
son in industhry? You didn't know how much work 
you could do till I 
brought it out of you," says he. 
Be gob! but I 
know how much work he hindered me 
from doin'. 
But hould on a 
bit; let me come across 
him again—if iver I 
come across him again by J—s 
VII keep clear av him

We'll chase the devil around the stump, 
There's one wide river to cross! 
We'll chase the devil around the stump, 
There's one wide river to cross! 
CHORUS. 
One wide river, one wide river to cross! 
One wide river, one wide river to cross. 
When duty calls us to the field, 
The order we'll obey, 
If to defend our native land, 
We'll mingle in the fray! 
And by our camp-fires burning bright, 
We'll have a 
jolly spree, 
We'll tell our jokes and sing our songs, 
And laugh and shout with glee! 
I 
love to hear the stirring drum, 
The cannon's booming roar; 
To be a 
soldier is my joy, 
I 
ask for nothing more! 
And when our battles all are o'er, 
A 
joyous place to come 
To meet our comrades side by side, 
It is the Soldiers Home. 
We'll float together, we'll float together, 
There's one wide river to cross! 
We'll float together, we'll float together, 
There's one wide river to cross.

GOOD-BYE, 
LOVELY LOIT.' 
Written and sung by Gus Wn.LiAms. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. Goullard. 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I 
am going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head, 
Then placed her lovely bands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said: 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you, 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. . 
I 
said, now Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind. 
I've one thing Lou, to tell to yos. 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned 
That she had gone away. 
$o now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say.

Let my name be kindly spoken- - 
When you're far away from me, 
And, although the vows are broken,

All the scenes of days departed 
I'll endeavor to forget; 
And, if you are broken-hearted, 
Think not of the day we met.

And although the vows are broken

In the past we loved each other, 
Loved each other fond and true,-
Arid I'll never find another 
That can take the place of you; 
Though I

Seeking lands beyond the sea, 
Well I 
know that I 
shall never, 
sever see the like of thee. 
Let my nqme, etc.

THE FAMILY IN THE REAR) 
Words and music by J. P. SKELLY. 
Copyright, 1830, and published by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery', N. 4.1 
Priee 35 cents. 
I 
live beyant in Ludlow Street, although I'm not a 
Sheeny, 
I 
occupy an Irish flat, and me name is Mike McSweeny. 
, 
I 
try to live a 
quiet life, and have no strife or care; 
But day and night I'm in a 
fright with the family in 
the rear. 
CHORUS. 
All day and night they shout and fight, and dance 
upon the fiure; 
Whinever they go in or out, they bang the kitchen door. 
They send up for Maloney's, and they stand him up 
for beer; 
Oh! such a 
set I 
never met, as the family in the rear. 
There's fourteen in the family, their sons are six in 
number; 
The youngest is a 
squalin' babe, the eldest is a bum-
mer; 
The daughters all are very proud, the finest clothes 
they wear; 
You'd never' think them members of the family in the 
rear, 
The father is a 
handy man, a 
hod of breecks he carries; 
Sometimes he leaves one in his hat, when from his 
home he tarries; 
Then he comes home singing " Garry Owen," and steps 
upon the stair; 
And all the night he wants to fight for the family in 
the rear. 
The mother has a temper high, and swears a loud 
" 
bejabers ;" 
She wants to put on the boxing gloves, and fight wid 
all the neighbors; 
She throws the ould man down the stairs, and gives 
us such a 
scare; 
We have to call the fine police, for the family in the 
rear,

THE GERMAN WAITERS. 
By G. Mutually. 
Sung by MURPHY & SHANNON. 
Oh, good evening to you one and all, 
You. can plainly see we are two German waiters; 
We are ready for any one to call, 
De bill-of-fare is stewed hats mit kadaters. 
We wirk for dirdy cends a 
day 
Down in a 
restaurant; 
Und if dere is no peesiness, 
Den we do not get a 
cent. 
In Germany we was shoemakers, 
But when we came here we learnt to be waiters. 
(Repeat, then dance.) 
-Oh! de first time we waited on de table, 
Dot was de day you ought to see de fun; 
You would laugh yust so loud as you was able, 
When we'd bring in dings dat wasn't done. 
De fellows used to order dings 
Only for us to tease, 
Und call out for burnt bootlegs, 
Mit a 
lump of dry-good cheese.

THE ONLY COMPLETE AMERICAN EDITION, 
FROM THE TRUE LONDON COPY. 
In presenting this new and enlargc-1 edition of " NAPOLtON'S Bo= 
OP FATE" to the notice of the inhahitants of this great and enli'ght-
ened republic, the publisher respe,--tfully informs them that it is a 
tale copy of the original London e.dtion, (published at the price 
$a/ 
5.00), which was a perfect fac simile of the one used by NAPO-
LEON, and consulted by him on every important occasion. HAPPY 
HAD IT BEEN FOR HIM, HAD HE ABIDED OR BEEN RULED BY THE AN-
SWERS OP THIS ORACLE. No further liberties have been taken in the 
translation than merely to adapt it to the usages of this country.

fled than in any other edition ever before published in the United 
States, renders it much more valuable and interesting than any copy 
heretofore published. 
And in this enlarged and improved state it is 
adapted to all and every condition of life: persons of both sexes 
whatever their situation or capacity, may with confidence refer to 
its pages to derive the most information, and for the piirpose of reg-
ulaVing their future conduct according to its ORACULAR COUNSELS.
