Dear Hsil.e and
. Johnnie,
 
Bess is in trouble. The Civil iervice Corimi sion has filed
 
charges against her on three grounds-and on those grounds asked
 
that she be d
.ismi sea froi
 jab as  oting Chief of the Music
 
Division of (
Jl P
.oad
.io Overseas. The ohar ea are a)  .hat she ias
 
a member of the YOL in Bryn Mawr b) That she was ax member of t
he
 
lmanacs during the years between her senior year and college a
ii
 
her employment by O
VII and that during those years the t
lmanaos
 
followed
. the Communist Party Line--.- a proof of her continued a-
heronoe to that line-- and
. c
) That ±
1&
 
t one time she lived at
 
an a
i
.dress on sixth ,,
venue here which was occupied by a Communist
 
organization.
 
1ie
I appealed the decision of the Commission. Bess appealed
.
 
it. Last Friday she had her hearing before the Appeals board.xi
 
It vas a 6tar Chamber proceedi n
g throughout. A Mister Malloy, who
 
was the trial examiner, shouted
. stoi ed
., read
, extraneous material
 
into the record, playecl the  lamanac anti-war records, refused
 
all demands to prove any statement he made by saying that he had
 
to submit no evidence and that her dismissal was a discretionary
 
measure, bullied
.,, stormed and
. threatened. He called
. Bess a liar
 
and she was allowed
, no ohanoe to reply to any of his charges---
all of which were supplem; ntal to those outlined above... I will
 
come t
 o t
 hose in a moment.
 
T
he Appeals' Commislon is vithold
.ing decision until she can
 
submit wbatever affèd
.avjta and
, supplementary evidence she cares
 
to in wr.ting. If their decision is unfavorable, she can still
 
appeal to the commission. The Unton (United Federal roricers of
 
Amer

re-  going to fight
 -her ease, The cwx is goini' t  c 1
"
 
for another hear ing on the grounas that this one vas unfair.
 
But everyone I can talk to agrees that by faz the most effective
 
means of handling the case i
s by political pressure of her o
wn
 
home congre
s
s
men. That is where you all come in--- I hope*
 
for instance,
 
Do you have an
yone in Washington, Lyn&on JohnsonI who is
 
personally beh 1d
.en to you and who might be willing to go to
 
the commission in this case?  If so, I should
, greatly appreciate
 
your giving us a hand
, at this point.
 
I am going to try to get in touch with B 4dle and Ma
v erick
 
and. Connally and, Johnson on my own, but I have no partiotlar
 
home-town ,  home-state congressional contacts -
- -
 and t
hose are
 
really the best. If you have any good ideas, call me up collect
 
a n
y evevaingx at home and let's discuss what best may be done.
 
.
..
 Perhaps at1ier wou]4 be able to help,
 Do as
, i
s reluctant
 
to go to him unless she absolutely has to.
 
The detajis of this charge are quite ingenious and
, they
 
show just how far the reaotionar*es in government are willing to
 
o.. .The whobo thing comes out in a series of dates...
 
In coblege Bess was a man er of YCI.
 
She resi ie& when she left school in Jun , 1941.
 
Before that time she had, known the Almanacs, had
, helped to
 
s
ell the anti..war album at an APM meeting in March 1941, but
 
'
was not a member z until Novemzber, 1941.
 
In the meantime it is charged that the Almanacs became
 
pro-war in the summer of '41, followIng the party line...
 
Z
i Although, by the time Bess joined them, the .
&lamancs were
 
pro-war(whjch was respeoatble if you weren't suspected of sym-
pathy with Russia) and although during 1e summer and fall of
 
41 they had sung union stuff and folk songs Oto1usive1y--not
 
quite knowin
,  what to do, nevertheless Bess is imputed to
 
be a Communist because she joined
. an oganization which l
i
Ed
 
such a history.
 
It is later charged that thepe fiends i
trem Hell's Pit
 
were singing second front songs long before a second front was
 
opened
.. Just as they had earlier in May.42 sung their wonderful
 
anti_faeoist  american-unity sèngs before thO c o
untry was r
eally
 
unified
...-- or do I make sense..
 
Anyhow now Bess, who is doing a e1*-ma
 at O
YTI, under
 
3.
 
paid.alving away for ten hours a day six days a week trying
 
to keepal]. (II's 37 languages from b
d
.oasting the wrong
 
music-.-, is getting the axe. The Civil  ervioe feels that
 
it can rove that she joined
, an organization suspected
. of
 
Communij  sympathies because it i
s believed this organization
 
follwoe the C. P. line through the  Nazi-Pact and
. the Nazi-
Attack  viationa--- and, that therefore her allegiance to the
 
prinsip s of the CP remained
, intact during the period vhen the
 
resignei from the Y L in June '41 and the time she went to
 
work fo O
VI in the winter of 1942.,.. The fact that the Music
 
Dept, w4ild, go to hell if she were kio
'ked out is a matter of
 
no impo anoe  agminwk as aganat the pleasure  the Commission
 
seems t
i derive from this torturous  x chain of evidence...
 
f you think you can help, let me know. Meantime t
