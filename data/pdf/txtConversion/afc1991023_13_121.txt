Ted Ramp, Marie Ramp 
2MIK: 
TX01: 001 G—Heidelberg Avenue; 12GT An account of how Ted Ramp used 
to catch catfish out of the reservoir, using dipnets and a five 
gallon paint bucket. Kept them in his mother's bathtub before 
moving them to his grandmother's aquarium. One lived for 14 years 
"til the old man came home drunk." 
Moved to Egg Harbor City area from New York in 1314 when the 
town was lit by coalpower. At age 10 he received a bicycle from a 
Dutchman. Most roads were sand, Whitehorse Pike was gravel. Went 
catfishing at night. 
052 Discussion re: his granddaughters. Susie worked at Oyster 
Creek Restaurant. Her husband has "laze—itis." 
062 Complaints about the increase in cost of living. 
Questions about the Hufford family. 
036 Recollection of Ted's residency at Central Regional High 
School, a glass—blowing demonstration. 
Ramp: Saw Gary Giberson the other day. Still makin' ducks. 
(Giberson, a decoy carver) 
Hufford: Where does he work now? 
Ramp: He never did work, only off and one when the spirit 
moved him. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs

Discussion re: a portrait of Ted and the artist who painted 
it who invited Ted to go west with him on an Indian portrait 
expedition. 
Hufford: Do you like the painting. 
Ramp: It's allright. It ain't botherin' nobody. aesthetics 
Won't go out west: "What the hell 
do I want to prog 
(specialized vocabulary word) around out there for?" 
144 More discussion of Indians. Ted, joking, "They're all 
over!" 
156 Hufford: You've dug a few clams, haven't you? 
Ramp: Got 500 last fall, put 'em 
in the freezer 
170 Ramp clams with a friend from Port Republic. Not in a 
garvey: "They don't make no more garveys. They're all fiberglass 
anymore." Ramp had two garveys. Hufford: Did they have names? 
Ramp: Oh you never heard the names they got, especially when they 
broke down. We'd go out there five or six miles, clammin', then 
the wind would start up and you'd wanna come in, 
and the motor 
wouldn't start. You never heard such shouting. 
Hufford: Did you clam at the same time that you were a 
glassblower? Ramp: No, I went before, and you couldn't sell 
the 
clams. Then when the glass factory opened, about 1924, 
in Egg 
Harbor, I went to work there. Then in the meantime sometimes they 
shut down for six months. I'd go work out there, fished a 
while ... Mostly weakfish. They come in here 
in the spring, boy, 
we'd catch 'em by the ton. Hufford: With nets? Ramp: Yeah. We was 
allowed to use a 70 fathom net, had to men 'em, big sharks would 
tear 'em up. 
Nets were of cotton, 
included drift nets, haul seines, gill 
nets ("catch the fish around the neck") and purse nets for 
commercial ocean fishing. 
Hufford: Do you remember Menhaden fishing? 
Ramp: I guess so, you oughta come around here (then). If 
they had too many fish to make oil they'd bring 'em up the river, 
and all 
the farmers would come and get the herring by the wagon 
load. 
Hufford: That must have been pretty smelly. 
Ramp: Oh, 
it was really juicy! Christ! You couldn't sleep! 
They'd put a herring in every stalk of corn, and every dog, I 
guess, 
in 20 mile of here, they'd come and roll 
in 
'em, and then 
they'd go home and go in the house. Oh. they'd raise hell!...The 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
gas from the hold in the boat could kill you in about three 
minutes. Any fish would (not just menhaden) do it. Even people 
would. Anything that starts to rot. 
Pollution and government policy have changed everything for 
the worse. 'Foreigners have fished us out." 
292 Merits of freezing vs. smoking fish. Ted has a 
smokehouse in which he used oak and corn cobs to smoke fish. 
Started clamming at age 12 or 13. 
"I used to ride down to 
Leeds' Point on a bicycle and go out with the clamdiggers. 
Hufford: Do you remember any old—time clamdiggers? 
Ramp: I remember 'em all. Once you see one you'll never 
forget 'im. Pretty tough guys...I took my kids with me. We'd go 
out in a rowboat. I'd put them overboard, and they'd scratch rake 
'em. Billy would come home with seahorses. 
I used to go out there and catch 12 or 14 hundred clams and 
sell 
'em to the farmers and ten or twelve cents a dozen. It took 
four, five hours. I went out there with my brother once, cold as 
hell! This was winter. Boy did we catch clams! We put 'em 
in the 
feed bag, only had a twelve foot boat. Some old guy was out 
there, one of the redneckers, and he had a sailboat, a real 
sailboat, and he'd come over and picked us up, so he took my 
brother and they started for shore. I got the water out of the 
boat and started for another shore. Had to wait an hour for them 
to come in. Boy that was some cold! 
380 Used to go rumrunning in a 24 foot garvey, just to the 
inlet. Somebody would get the word to them where to go. 
Hufford: Did you have any narrow escapes? 
Ramp: I don't know if I did. I don't know ... When you went 
out there, especially if a fog came in, you didn't know who was 
around! 
Ramp: "Here come some of the tribe" (three of his 
grandchildren). 
Grandson: "Did the dog come up yet? The one that you 
planted?" 
Ramp apparently shot the head off of an annoying dog, and 
then "planted" him. 
Ramp, a complaint: "I ordered some seed. I can't count no 
more, I can't figure no more. I must be gettin' senile." 
Ramp to his grandson: When are you comin' down to kill some 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 3 
squirrels?" 
Grandson (about 12 years old, squirming, leaning against the 
wall): I wasn't home. 
Ramp: "Well, why don't you stay home once in a while?!!" 
Grandson falls to the floor. Hufford laughs but no one else 
does. 
Ramp: "Where the hells' my swamp crick (his word for 
bourbon). I don't want it to go sour." He offers some to the 
husband of his granddaughter. The grandson who fell over says, 
in 
a deep voice, "He can't drink none, he has to ride his 
motorcycle." The whiskey is accepted anyway. 
Hufford: Tell me about the time you shot a hole in the 
floor. 
Ramp: Oh, I done that a hundred times. 
Grandson: He told me that the other day. 
Mrs. Ramp: The one about the dog 
in Haberstraw's (sp?) Bar. 
(laughing) He shot all the bars up!@ 
Ramp: We come home from duckhuntin' one night, about seven 
o'clock and went in this bar and the guy comes there, about seven 
o'clock in the mornin', and this was about seven o'clock at night 
and his horse was out in the alley, and we unhooked him out of 
the wagon, we shoulda shot 'im, and we brought the horse in the 
bar, and he went through the floor! Holy Christ did we have 
trouble!...He fell through the floor, and boy did that horse 
scream. Took about eight guys to pull him out. We nearly went to 
jail for that. 
Went in the same bar one night, was shootin' darts, and the 
guys got in an argument. So I told 'em, I says, "Shut your goddam 
mouth and get away from there, so I got my gun. And next door to 
the bar was a Dago shoemaker, and I shot the dart board, and 
it 
went into the store next door, and you oughta seen when he come 
over. We used to have a lot of fun. Can't have no fun no more. 
Mrs. Ramp: You call that fun? 
Ramp: Sure it was fun! 
580 Reference to a time when a dog walked across a barroom, 
peed on the floor, and Ted shot a hole in the floor to drain it. 
Ted offers to take fieldworkers around to some of the sites. 
Mrs Ramp: What about the time you shot the clock off the 
wal I? 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 4 
Ramp: That was in a garage. A guy bet me a dollar I couldn't 
hit the clock 
in the center. I had a rifle. I shot the whole 
center right outa the clock. He got mad at me. 
Hufford: Was it his clock? 
Ramp: Yeah it was his clock. It sure as hell wasn't mine! 
Hufford: Well, that's one way to kill time. 
Side two 
000 Mrs. Ramp: What about the time you shot the money? 
Ramp: There was a guy arguin' with me and he had four or 
five one dollar bills on the bar and I had this old pistol with 
me about that big, and I grabbed his money and I put it 
in the 
barrel. I had powder in 
it and I rammed it down the barrel and he 
wanted his money and I shot it up 
in the ceiling. The place was 
full, Christ! Nobody could see! And he was scramblin' around 
lookin' for his money. Half of 
it was burned up! 
Mrs. Ramp remembers another time in Laureldale when someone 
came in and announced that the war was over, and the bartender 
said, "Everything goes!" Ramp: 
So I shot a couple of holes in 
the floor. Cleared the place out. Next day someone told me I was 
crazy. 
(Grandchildren leave.) 
Hufford: What about the goat that sued to drink in the bars 
around here? 
Ramp: Oh yeah, they'll do that, goats will. They'll drink 
whiskey too, and boy, they'll get ornery. They'll chase you all 
over hell. 
Re: moonshining. Ramp: Sometimes when we was makin' whiskey 
some of the guys, when it was distilled, they'd feed the mash to 
the pigs, and boy, they'd get so drunk! You can't have a bit of 
fun around here no more. 
Mrs. Ramp: You call that stuff fun? If you call shootin' up 
bars and all that stuff fun? You're lucky you never went to jail. 
Ramp: Sure it was fun. You made somebody mad. 
Re: his large gun collection, he sold most of 
it. Got 
$12,000 for more than 250 Civil War antiques. 
He hasn't made any glass lately. Too costly for oil and 
chemicals. Used #2 oil. Most big factories used bunker (menhaden) 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
oil. #2 heats only to 2600 degrees, but bunker oil has more BTUs 
per gallon. 
Details of recent illness and hospitalization. 
Details of the moonshining business: I done it in the cellar 
most of the time on a small 50 gallon still, but they had 'em out 
in the woods around here, they'd make 2-3 hundred cans. They 
hauled it away in truckloads. We used to steal about a can a 
night, me and another guy, and when we had ten or fifteen cans, 
we'd throw 'em 
in the car and take 'em to Atlantic City. They 
made 
it all 80 proof. I been gettin' some off a guy, Wild Turkey. 
Then after the moonshine business went to hell (after 
prohibition and the Depression) then you could buy 
it for 65 
cents a quart, Wilkins family and all 
that. More discussion of 
prices, and going to Maryland sometimes to get the stuff. 
175 Can't go 
in the bars (reasonably priced) except for a 
hole in the wall where the little old lady who runs it charges 
$1.75 a shot. "I could make my own but it's a damn nuisance." 
Hufford: Have you done lots of things around here besides 
work the bay? 
Ramp: Hell, yeah. 
Mrs. Ramp: He's picked cranberries. 
Ramp: Picked thousands of bushels of wild cranberries. 
Mrs. Ramp: Huckleberries, 
Ramp: With a scopp. I get a bushel off a bog back here every 
fall. I love cranberries. 
Mrs. Ramp: Put 'em 
in the freezer, make cranberry sauce. 
foodways 
Ramp: Used to get $15 a barrel. Picked 2 or 3 barrels a day, 
wild ones. We got a lotta rain then, and all these old swamps 
were fulla water, and that's where the cranberries grows, and now 
they're dryin' up because they're drainin' everywhere. They're 
just dyin' right out, right across the street here I was about 7 
years old and my uncle and I went and picked two bushels of 
cranberries. All these swamps had 'em in. Today you can't find 
'em, there's no more water, no more water. And it's gonna get 
worse and worse, they ain't gonna get no more water. People 
takin' two or three baths a day and runnin' water continyoos 
(sic) and you can't run a well no more (course I would) without 
notifyin' the state. Well for my money they can go to hell. 
Mrs. Ramp: The factories use plenty too. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 6 
Hufford: Have you trapped for snapping turtles? 
Ramp: Oh, caught 'em by the thousand. 
Mrs. Ramp: There's not much he hasn't done. 
Ramp: I went in the snapper business about 6-8 years ago. I 
made a couple traps, I still got three or four in the shed, fyke 
nets. So, I'm goin' 
in the snapper business. The guy 
in 
Sweetwater Casino, he wanted 'em, about a hundred pound a week, 
cleaned, a dollar a pound. Well, boy, that was really money. So I 
made the nets and I set 'em. Course I always used to catch some, 
and I got 'em home, and I got gas to hot the water, and I started 
in about seven o'clock one mornin', and I got about 6 or 8 heads 
off, 
like 'at (shows size), and I went to scald 'em, and the 
goddam things, they don't die right away you know, some of 
'em 
live a week after you cut the heads off. (Teitler laughs) Yeah! 
They don't die! When you dumped 'im 
in the water he'd hunch up 
like this (demonstrates, elbows bent, arms flush against the 
ribs, armpits protected) and all under his legs and sides you 
couldn't scald 'im! And you'd clean the rest up and then when you 
had to scald that again it would get gummy like. It took me a 
whole day to get about 90 pounds, and I sold it to 
'im and I went 
right outa the snapper business. 
Hufford: Did any ever bit you? 
Ramp: No, I wasn't dumb enough to get near 'em. 
Hufford: Did you know a fellow named Allie Chor (sp?)? 
Ramp: Allie?!! Holy Christ! Yeah I knowed 'im! I was gonna 
kill 
'im a couple times! He used to steal my muskrats! He was a 
good guy though. His family was no good. 
Hufford: Didn't he used to kiss snapping turtles? 
Ramp: He used to kiss 'em! He'd come up town. He used to 
catch turtles, catfish, eels, and he's come in town and peddle 
'em. And he'd get in a bar after he sold a couple, and get drunk, 
and kiss these goddam turtles! He wasn't afraid of 
'em. 
Teitler: How'd he keep 'em from just snappin' his lips right 
off? 
Ramp: Well they just didn't. But then one day they did! They 
took a hunk out of his 
lip here. Yeah, he was an ornery old 
bastard. 
Ramp on how to cook a muskrat: Pull of the hide, rip the 
guts out, soak 'em 
in salt water, cause see the blood is 
in 
'em, 
clean 'em up and then if you're hungry enough, you could eat 'em, 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 7 
parboil 
'em and fry 'em. 
Mrs. Ramp: Just the thoughts of 'em, I couldn't eat 'em. 
Hufford: Aren't there seven different kinds of meat in the 
snapping turtle? 
Ramp: A dozen kind! There's so many different kinds of meat 
in the snapper, that's one of the oldest animals in the world, 
the snapping turtle. They never evoluted since they were put 
here! They're at least 5 million years old. But this 
contamination, this pumpin' 
in the rivers is killin' everytthing. 
Ramp crabbed too, for $20 a bushel. Then they passed a law 
you gotta have a license and all this other bullshit. But they 
wouldn't stop the guys from stealin' the traps. 
Ramp never made charcoal: "I've seen 'em make it, but that 
went out. The last guy coaled on Indian Cabin road was Lenny 
Weiss. And his father—in—law, we used to call 
it "coalin'." About 
1933 or 
'34. They got 35 cents a bushel." 
Has heard of salt hay ropemaking going on on the Delaware 
Bay, but not around here. "But some of that stuff they tell 
you 
about, some nut mighta made some, you could never a made no money 
out of it." He associates it with crafts like spinning wool. 
"Some nut! Some college student! Christ, they had wool here for 
thousands of years." Recalls an old Belgian shoemaker in Egg 
Harbor who used linen made by him with flax. His name was 
Klabberdamp, but they called called Klopperdomp. "Yeah, they're 
all 
gone now. His youngest son just died. He was a Belgian...We 
moved here from New york. Lived in Vineland for years when I 
worked in the glass factories. That was in the thirties. I quit 
Vineland, and I come and lived down the road here. And then I got 
a job on a tugboat. I worked there a year, and then I hadda go 
and get drafted, and then I guit the tugboat and come home. 
(after World War II) Then I got a notice I was too old, and then 
I got a job at the Naval Base (NAFEC). The Navy had it then and 
it was allright but when the goddam politicians got it 
it was no 
good. (He was there for three years.) 
Re: making his own glass: I made it 
in Vineland 'bout 1939. 
I built a little glass house 
in the chicken house ... A guy give me 
two 50 gallon barrels and filled 'em up with oil for about $6 and 
I knowed a plumber over there and he give me an oil pump and me 
and another guy went in there and started to make it. 
Mrs. Ramp: Ted, who was that used to come by and buy it? 
What was his name? 
Ramp: Oh, he was from, uh, where the hell was he? Aw, hell 
of a nice guy, 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 8 
Mrs. Ramp: Up North Jersey, 
Ramp: No, up, uh, 
Mrs. Ramp: The guy that used to come from North Jersey. He's 
really the one that 
Ramp: (explosively) Oh that bullshit artist! 
Mrs. Ramp: Alright! He mighta been a bullshit artist, but 
he's the one that really got 
Ramp: You never seen 'im after the war! They prob'ly killed 
'im over in Africa! 
Mrs. Ramp: (laughing) 
Ramp: What the hell was his name? 
Mrs. Ramp: I forget. 
Ramp: Oh he was a bullshit artist. 
Mrs. Ramp: He used to buy, 
Ramp: But the guy up, 
Mrs. Ramp: Clayton? 
Ramp: Around Cherry Hill. What the hell was the name of 
that? 
Mrs. Ramp: Um 
Ramp: Town. 
Ramp: Beautiful old town up there. 
Mrs. Ramp: Robins? or Roberts? Was it Robert? Remember you 
sold your glass to Robert? 
Ramp: Robert? 
Mrs. Ramp: Yeah, wasn't it Robert? 
Ramp: No, the guy lost his eye, Merchantville! Merchantmill. 
I sold it to him. He was a nice guy too. Yeah, he come down 
there, get a truckload of 
it, gimme cash. Take it back up, and I 
would still keep makin' 
it you know, and then he 
lost an eye. I 
don't know what the hell else happened to him, but, I had some 
guys fom Philly too„ when they come back from the army. They 
were coppersmiths, and boy they made some beautiful stuff outa 
copper, and I made glass things to put in 
'em and then they got 
to boozin' and fightin' among themselves. They went to hell. It 
woulda been a good thing. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 9 
(This was all before Ramp's job at NAFEC and the tugboat 
job.) Then I came home and the end of 
'43 when I was drafted, 
then when I come home I went down to Mays Landing for a job. They 
were still making ammunition and a guy told me, Come on over, 
I'll 
give you a job and when I went over the guy said, "You can't 
have that job." I said, "Why not?" He says, "Because you gotta do 
somethin' else." And I said, "Well you can go to hell." And he 
said, "I'll have your ass 
in the army." I said, (there was a girl 
there, but it didn't make no difference to me) I said, "You do, 
you son—of—a—bitch and you'll die before I get in there." and I 
walked out. The next day I went down the base, somebody told me 
to come down there. I went in there and I filled the paper out, 
and I hadda go to some guy, Provost Marshal or some shit, and 
kept me there a half an hour. Then I worked in Hotels, after that 
went to hell. He was a stationery engineer, running ice machines 
and generators, worked at the Claridge for ten years. But all 
their steam equipment was gone to hell. Then he was an engineer 
at the hospital until he retired. 
Ramp 
is now 74. 
"You can't do nothin' today, not a damn thing. You own 
property and you pay taxes on 
it and you ain't supposed to do 
nothin' with it." 
Mrs. Ramp: You can't burn brush, but he does it. 
Hufford: What's a snakehunter? 
Ramp: I'm gettin' to believe you got a little of 
it in you! 
Mrs. Ramp: (laughing) That's his way of sayin', 
like the 
Chatsworth people. 
Ramp: Hillbillies. 
Mrs. Ramp: And this here whiskey he calls 'snake oil" or 
"swamp crick," that's his own sayin'. 
Ramp: Me and her uncle, we went out to kill a deer over to 
Green Bank, and, uh, I had a rifle 
in the car and he had a 
shotgun and we went up this road, and the road's still there and 
he had a model—A-1928. This was about '32—'33. Prohibition wasn't 
out yet. And we go up there to kill a deer and there was a pine 
snake layin' across this bush road, just like the road here, I 
guess maybe ten foot wide. And that was a pine snake lyin' there 
that big around and he wanted him for a belt. We used to get 
snakes, big snakes, and make belts out of 'em. And he went and 
said, "Christ, I can't see the end of 
'im." And his head was 
about that far up 
into the woods and he went and grabbed 'im. 
Boy, that son—of—a—bitch come around and pretty near chopped his 
hand off. he had teeth that big. By the time I got the gun out of 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 10 
the car he was gone. 
So about two mile down the road there was an old moonshiner 
lived there and he had old trunks all 
around it where you sat, 
you known and he come runnin' 
in there, holdin' his hand and the 
blood was pourin' out of his hand and he said, "Uncle Bill, I'm 
snake bitten!" and Uncle Bill says, "Fix you right up, fix you 
right up." and he had peanut butter jars, bigger than this, and 
he used to sell moonshine and swill. And he poured this goddam 
moonshine in there and 
it looked a little darker than that and he 
put teaberries in 
it and orange peels, shit! And I go 
in there 
and he hands Ander a drink and me a drink and Ander gulps his 
down and I look at 'is face and I thought he was gonna die! He 
said, "Let's go!" So I dumped mine behind the trunk. I didn't 
like the look of it. And we got out of the car, I says, "Where in 
the hell are you goin'?" He said, "Go back and find that son—of— 
a—bitc' snake and let 'im bite me all over again!" 
Hufford: What about the snowstorm when you got to school 
late? 
Mrs. Ramp: When you had to go back to school and you was 
late and 
it icy, what you told the teacher! (laughs) 
Ramp: Me and the kid up on the hill went to school and we 
went through, we always walked through the woods. We didn't go by 
the road and we had a hell of a rain, that was about 1919, and we 
got out there and somebody give us each an old pair of clamp—on 
skates and we're back in there skatin' around, forgettin' about 
school, and we was worried, they used to knock the hell outa you, 
y'know. And we got in there and well, 
it was so slippery, we 
couldn't walk! Every time we took a step we slipped back two! She 
said, "How's you get here?" We said, "We turned around and walked 
backwards!" (shouts of laughter) Boy, she hit us both. 
Mrs. Ramp: You know how they used to heat the school with a 
pot—bellied stove? He threw bullets in 
it, busted the whole damn 
stove! 
Ramp: I did blow it up. Somebody had a .22 and they put some 
paper around it. When we went to school we had to throw all 
our 
scrap 
in the fire. My uncle had a trunk (at home) 
of 45/70s 
about that long and when I went home I stuck a couple in my 
pocket and I went to school the next day and I put a lot of paper 
around one and I went up there and throwed it 
in and I just about 
got back to the chair and 
it went off and it was about 1918 or so 
and the teacher was a marine. He just come out of the marines. He 
was crippled and he taught school and he come over to me and he 
looked at me and says, "You little bastard! I'm gonna knock the 
livin' hell outa you!" And I thought he would too, but he didn't. 
He was a good guy. Blowed the stove all 
to hell. 
Teitler: What happened between school and the glass factory?

Ramp: I worked on a farm. We had 5 or 6 cows, raised 
everything and sold it, with a horse and wagon in Egg Harbor. 
Mrs. Ramp is Italian, from Hammonton. 
Ramp: When they opened the glass house up about 1923 I went 
in there and I got a job but boy that was some goddamn hot! They 
was payin' 20-25 cents an hour labor, and they give us 40 cents 
in there, and boy, that was some money! One year after I was a 
glass worker and worked on some real fast stuff I made $1200 and 
boy I was a millionaire. That was some money! And these goddam 
people make it 
in 
Mrs. Ramp: A month! 
Ramp: A mont! Hell! Some of 
'em make it 
in a week and they 
still ain't happy! 
Mrs. Ramp: When he come home from the glass factory he could 
just about make it, and his shoes was wet! 
Ramp: Soakin' wet! And your shirt and clothes a half—inch of 
salt all over from sweating. We worked nine hours a day. Yeah 
boy, that was some money... 
When they opened up they made some press ware, you know, 
that's solid glass, and stemware. We had three stem shops. A 
couple of 
'em were Swedes and,...

Ramp: These factories today couldn't make out. They ain't 
allowed to make no more soda ash 
in this country on account o' 
the pollution. They're gettin' 
it from China, $24.00 a hundred 
pounds where it used to be $8 here. They got all 
the salt in the 
world out at Great Salt Lake. They used to use that! 
Mrs. Ramp: The last time you bought sand, 
Ramp: Yeah! They got millions o' 
tons over Port Norris. I 
used to buy it at $2.50 a ton. I had to go get it. On the last 
time I went over there it was $25.00 a ton. 
Hufford: You used sand from Port Norris? 
Ramp: Yeah, how the hell do you think I made it? 
Hufford: Could you use sand from Atlantic City? 
Ramp: Not with the salt in 
it and the shells. 
Hufford: How about from the Pine Barrens? 
Ramp: Yeah, but you gotta wash it a hundred times. 
Ramp: They had a big glass house in Green Bank and they went 
out there in the woods and dug 
it and washed it and seined it. 
(He used cullet at Wheaton.)

Discussion of the pieces he has on display in the living 
room. Use of an 
iron 
mold, "crackle" 
is the name for glass with 
cracks in 
it. 
"You dip it 
in 
ice water while it's still hot and 
then you put it 
in the Glory hole and melt the cracks shut. 
Crimps are put in with another special tool. Ted made all 
his 
molds out of wood. Lines are put in the glass by dipping the 
piece in a cage before it goes into the mold. "You gotta work 
fast as hell!" 
The punty mark on the bottom of pitchers. 
Ramp: You can't do nothin' no more.! 
They used to melt glass with wood in Green Bank. They melted 
iron (bog iron) with wood, that's what started all these iron 
foundries. They used to cut 20 acre patches out of pine wood, 
and when it was cut they'd burn it, and cover it over with sand, 
and then after they made the charcoal they'd gather all the brush 
up and they'd burn it off clean. In 20 years they'd have another 
crop of pine. Now the last time, when they cut pulp wood, they 
cut the trees down, 
left the brush there and nothin' come up no 
more but briars and scrub oak and there never will come any pine 
up no more, no place where the pine seed can start, ruinin' 
everything! When I was a kid, a young kid, and you went in town 
on a Saturday night, and we called these guys that cut this 
charcoal "coalers," they'd come into town and never took a bath. 
No water out there. And buy their groceries, go right back, they 
lived right in the woods. they got some much for a cord of wood. 
I sit out with 'em for a couple nights one time and you really 
gotta known what you're doin'. If you get a leak it'll 
let 
in all 
the oxygen, burn the charcoal right up! You just gotta smolder 
it. 
Hufford: What did they do while watching it? 
Teitler: Swamp Crick! 
Ramp: They didn't have enough money for it. 
If they ever 
come to town they got loaded. They hadda really be on the ball 
because if that got some air, see they'd rank the poles all 
up 
like this, say six or eight cord, and then pack turf around 'em 
and throw sand on 
it and then they had to leave holes to get the 
fire started. 
Hufford: What did they call the holes? 
Ramp: Vents! 
Hufford: Did they sing songs? 
Ramp: Well everybody does that. They wasn't much. 
Hufford--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 14 
Hufford: What did they sing? 
Ramp: Some of 
'em used to come to town, Saturday night. You 
could smell 
'em two mile...I couldn't tell you one of 
'em. They 
were their own songs. By the time I come along there was two or 
three guys yet coalin'. That was all. 
Teitler: A dying thing. 
Ramp: Yeah, down along the river, Lower Bank, Green Bank, 
Batsto, over to Mays Landiung River, they used to have schooners, 
40-60 feet long, and load 
it 
in bogs, and put it on the vessel. 
Sail up into Philadelphia. The people used to use charcoal 
in 
irons. I had one of them around here. I ain't seen it 
in years. 
the women would start a fire in the iron and use charcoal for 
heat. All the laundries used it. Then they went to Baltimore, 
sold a whole load. they'd pick up sump'n there and go down to the 
South to other towns, clear to Florida. They used to be gone for 
two years! 
Hufford: What about other animals to catch and sell around 
here? What about box turtles for keeping snails out of people's 
basements? 
Ramp: (sourly) Well, 
if you sold one you got a nickel for 
it. Everybody used to have a turtle in the cellar. You can't even 
find one today. Box turtles? I got a field over there and I had 
fifty of 
'em around here. I had snakes, all kinda snakes...Pine 
snakes, black snakes, puff adders, garter snakes,.. 
Mrs. Ramp: Water snakes. 
Ramp: Them bastards I killed, but I wouldn't touch none of 
the others. 
Hufford: What were they good for? 
Ramp: Eat all 
the insects and stuff. 
Mrs. Ramp: Now you don't see 'em no more. 
Ramp: You can't find, i ain't seen a toad in 3 years! And I 
had 'em by the millions! 
Hufford: What were the box turtles for? 
Ramp: They claimed they chased the mice and rats out. 
don't know if they did, but once in a while you would 
mouse or rat. 
I 
find a dead 
Teitler: Hard to believe a box turtle could, 
Ramp: You seen 'em all over! Last 3 years I ain't seen 
Hufford--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 15 
nothin', I had a couple of pet snakes about like 'at, I could 
walk right over and I used to talk to 
'em, they'd look at me and 
ignore me but I wouldn't hurt 'em!...Pine snakes, some of them 
puff adders. I don't like 'em, but they're alright. I wouldn't 
kill one. 
Hufford: What's a puff adder look like? 
Ramp: Well, he's got a pretty good color, and when you get 
near 'im his head flattens way out and he puffs! 
Hufford: Like a cobra? 
Ramp: Yeah like a cobber! And sometime he'd raise up and 
you'd get near 'im, he would go like that to you, but he wouldn't 
bite you. 
Hufford: What about hog—nosed snakes? Aren't they the ones 
that'll play dead? 
Ramp: (considering) That might be the same one. I never 
heard of hard—nosed snakes. We called 'em puff adders. I seen one 
about 3 or 4 years ago back there. He was only about that long 
but boy, he was a nasty little bastard! And 
I went and slapped 
'im a couple times you know. And he got hysterics! (pronounced 
"high—sterrics" for effect) He got so scared he bit himself. He 
rolled on his back, and went into convulsions. And I left 'im lay 
there. I wasn't goin to hurt him and he 
laid there for two hours! 
Never moved! 
Hufford: A snake? 
Ramp: Yeah, one of these puff adders, those hard nose ones 
you're talking about. He was so scared! At least that's what I 
figured! But I never killed one of 
'em.

TX01: Beginning--testing microphones, identifying the tape: 
tour 
of G—Lebanon State 
Forest; 27GT with ranger Earl Danley who begins 
by distinguishing himself as a ranger from the wardens who are 
employed by the State Fish and Game Division. 
I remind him that he'd mentioned having seen oriental people 
gathering fern in the springtime. 
Doesn't know whether it goes 
by name of fiddlehead or bracken, just a common fern that grown 
in the upland areas. 
A couple species grow in the wetland areas 
and they don't pick those. 
Especially in areas that are control 
burned the ferns come back like crazy. 
The year before last 
there were chartered busses that brought Koreans and Vietnamese 
up from Washington to pick them. 
He mentions the Korean church on 530 in Browns Mills. 
Most 
of the cars of pickers have New York tags, Maryland tags. 
Not 
too many of them from Jersey. 
We're turning onto Mike's 
Crossway. Talking about the maps they have 
in the office. 
Shows 
me a blueprint map from the office and a picture of a fellow who 
is missing from the state colony. 
Most of the time they are non— 
violent, but there was a complaint of assault and battery last 
week in Woodland Township. 
It will probably be dismissed but a 
policeman cannot declare someone to be mentally retarded, he can 
just file the complaint and let the judge be the judge. 
We're still 
in "the office area", aka the Triangle area, by 
its 
look on the map. 
We're on Shinn's branch road headed for 
Reeves Bog, and passing the area that is part of the homeowner's 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 17 
woodcutting program, 
it was cut three years ago and is now full 
of white pine and loblolly. 
It's the area where the Italian 
fellow was picking mushrooms. "See how the white pine, every so 
many feet there's a ring of branches, that indicates a year's 
growth." 
The white pines are trimmed by boy scout troops now, 
it's too expensive to hire people to do 
it. 
The woodcutting 
program: 
they have to sell so many cords of wood for their 30 
thousand acres of forestland, based on calculations of numbers of 
oak trees in the woods, 500 cords every 80 years per section. 
This area was selected because of the good stand of white pine 
there. 
Oak will win out over white pine eventually. 
Most pines 
are cut for "pulk", chop it up, make it into mush, for poor grade 
hardwood. 
Most of the oaks here were cut out years ago. 
"See 
all those shoots comin up? 
They're all from that original stump. 
What'll happen is, 
see you've got twenty little shoots there, all 
of 
'em will die except for a couple of 
'em. 
See where those 
trees joined together? 
That was a stump originally, it's about 
50 years old. 
Actually cut maybe 60 years ago. 
Not purebred 
trees, actually runners off a tree that was cut maybe 60 years 
ago. 
If you'll 
look, just about every oak tree out there, see how 
the base comes down and curls down? 
That was actually a runner. 
Never heard of the term "jailhouse oak", they call them "suckers" 
when they're young. 
Some stumps won't have nothin'. 
A lady once 
told me one time , a combination of a wives' tale or not, but she 
said a lot of that has to do with the moon. 
If the moon is on 
the opposite side of the earth when that tree is cut, 
it draws 
the sap out of the tree and the stump dies. 
If the moon is on 
the other side of the thing when the tree is cut and it draws the 
sap up then the stump survives and 
it allows the new growth to 
come up." 
I've asked other people about the situation and 
they've said the same thing more or less. 
Cause we will have 
some areas where all 
the stumps just died off. 
Forestry 
management really doesn't want the oaks to come back. 
The 
original 
idea was to have a pine forest. 
Now the oaks are 
getting thicker and thicker. 
We utilize the cutting program to 
our best interest: 
to maintain a white pine stand. 
(plant) 
What happens if you get too many pine trees all together? 
Well the reason they call 
it the Pine Barrens is because of pine 
trees, right? 
If you go to Pygmy Forest you'll find the 
dominating species is pine. 
Plowed lines, used for control 
burning (called "Plowed Lanes" by foxhunters). 
Most lines run 
north and south and are every two and three hundred yards, 
marking the trees with ribbons for the forest fire service. 
Every January and February they control burn, burning one lot at 
a time. 
"They usually burn it against the wind. 
If the wind is 
blowing off the highway, which would be at us, they would light 
this side first, and 
it would burn back slowly and they would 
light both sides of the plowed line, and eventually they'll 
light 
the fourth side and move on to the next block. 
This was burnt 
about three or four years ago." 
The understory is sheep laurel, 
not huckleberry. 
The area is so clear through repeated control 
burning. 
They burn every three to four years using a drip torch 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 18 
gasoline torch. 
They burn in the wintertime because the tree s 
are all dormant, and 
it will only kill the small oaks. 
won't 
generally hurt the pines. 
Usually if the wind's blowing they 
won't burn at all. 
He was born and raised in Trenton. Lives in Burlington right 
now. 
"My father was born and raised where McGuire AFB lands 
their planes right now. 
It was all farmland then, farmland and 
woods. 
Cookstown, Juliustown, another town in there too. 
My 
grandfather was buried in Pemberton. My father then moved to 
Pemberton. 
My great—grandfather is buried in Pemberton. 
I don't 
think I'm related to too many Danleys running around now. 
Are 
you familiar w/ Martha's Furnace? 
When my father was a kid they 
used to ride past there on a horse and wagon. They used to go 
down to Lakehurst. 
We used to camp down the Wharton tract all 
the time. 
Even then the furnace was buried up. 
This white pine, I sneak in here with a saw on a slow day 
and trim the branches off. 
This has never been control burned. 
This is called the Penny Pine Plantation. 
The story behind it 
is 
basically, they had a fire in here in the thirties that pretty 
well killed all the trees, normal forest fire. 
So the local kids 
in the area elementary schools, look a deer, usually if you see 
one, you'll see another one, the kids took up a collection. 
They wanted to replant the area so they donated their pennies in 
the local schools. 
The CCC's are the ones that planted the 
saplings that their pennies purchased. 
The mountain laurel 
in 
there is getting pretty big, because this has never been control 
burned. 
White Pine does not stand well with control burning. 
Notice how when the white pine goes higher up, the bark gets 
smoother, 
when the bark is heavy the pine can take control 
burning. 
They control—burned about thirty or forty feet in, 
using plowed lines. 
They sort of made a protective bumper. 
Now 
what happens, 
is see this bush right here. 
That dead bush here 
will eventually rot and fall over, but new stuff will come up. 
The oak galls, a fungus or a disease, I don't know whether 
there's an 
insect in there or not. 
Mary—Ann Furnace, Lower Forge, Upper Forge, places in 
Lebanon Forest. 
M—A was never a furnace, was probably a mill. 
Danley is 
into family history. 
What do people do for fun around here? 
No canoeing, Pakim 
isn't good for that. "There's a big hawk that flies around here, 
and I thought that might a been him bouncin around in that tree 
up there, 
it was a grey squirrel, just ran down the bush." The 
campers come, sit around campfires. 
Bicycling. 
Snowmobiles in 
winter. 
We have old—timers, go foxhunting. 
Not really to catch 
the fox, just to chase the fox. 
Once a week I'll see one run 
across the road. recreation 
Do they have to stock them? 
No, they're all natural. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 19 
(great conviction). 
The only thing that's stocked right now is 
the turkeys. 
We stop to investigate what seems to be a deer 
hunter getting ready to set up his stand.

Testing the mik. 
We're at 
the Goose Pond, so—named, according to Bethmann, because lots of 
hunters like to hunt geese there. 
They have lots of swans 1a}in 
the wintertime at Reeves Bogs and at Whitesbogs, and the reason 
is that swans love reroot.1p) 
It's a problem for cranberry 
growers because it grows in the bogs, and the swans uproot the 
cranberry plants while they're digging for the redroot. 
Tom 
Darlington has put a dollar figure on 
it. 
He lost $20,000 
dollars one year. 
They have a shock shell, 
like a firecracker 
fired out of a shotgun. 
They have some wild dogs that are not a big problem. 
Stray 
cats are around, but they stick to people -- 
don't do so well 
in the wild. 
Animal stories: 
One fellow who hunts here told 
Bethmann about an albino deer running around in the woods. CB 
has heard some grunting noises from deer. 
One newborn deer 
cried out like a newborn baby when someone almost stepped on 
it. 
There is some illegal camping. 
usually they write them a 
summons and let them pay for their night's stay that way. 
The 
biggest problem with illegal campers is the trash they leave 
behind. 
We're now on North Branch Road, travelling east, near 
Pasadena and the railroad track. 
Walter Earlin is John Earlin's 
son 
He works for the state forest. 
He comes into the office 
about three or four times a year. 
Mostly he rides around and 
patrols, and puts out fires. 
The number of his truck is 86. 
The classic story about Walt and his dad -- 
I was out here 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 21 
riding around and I got out behind Goose Pond, and there's 
a couple roads out there that lead to no where, and I was 
just exploring 
one day -- I had run into foxhunters before, 
I was used to them, and all their fox hounds usually have a 
tag on the collar -- it'll have the owner's name and address 
and phone number. 
and I ran into this old tired lookin 
beagle that was headin' east, and I took a look at it, 
saw 
the name Earlin, and thought, well, it's either Walt's dog 
or one of his relatives, and since it was headin towards 
Pasadena i figured -- since its address and Browns Mills 
-- that this dog was backwards, headin the wrong way. 
So I 
figured I"d do 
im a favor and pick it up and take it back to 
the office. 
Picked the dog up and got back to the office and 
called Walt up, told im I found a dog that belonged to John 
Earlin, he said, "Oh, that's my dad" -- he said, "Where'd 
you find it?" 
I said, "It was out behind the pond and was 
heading out toward Pasadena -- I figured it was lost." 
Walt 
said, "No, she knew where she was going' --" 
back to his 
dad's cabin out there. 
So here I"d picked up a dog that 
was only a mile from home, 
took her nine or ten miles away 
back to my office, and she knew where she was going the whole 
time. 
We get out to 
look at Goose Pond. 
We are at the only access 
road to Goose Pond. 
8 min.: 
This is one of the sure signs that there were fox 
hunters around -- the bones from cattle or horses or whatever 
they can get their hands. 
MH: 
What do they do with them? 
CB: 
Well, they dump the bones -- usually there's a pile of 
them around--they'll dump piles of bones like that, with meat 
still on em that will attract the fox, and that'll give them 
someplace to start their dogs from, because they'll know that 
the fox'll be there after dark, gnawin away on those bones. 
They'll release their dogs around this area and let them scare 
the fox up and they're off and running. 
Sometimes you'll find 
just piles and piles and piles of bones. 
MH: 
What's the name of this place? 
CB: 
It's just a spot -- we don't have names for all these 
roads because there's so many of them. 
It's a pretty area 
because it's not travelled much, except during hunting season. 
There is 
leatherleaf, maples and cedars, cranberry vines, and 
pines, and sundews -- (He 
lets me pick one to take back to the 
office -- I mention that I used one for fruit—fly control 
in 
the office) 
There's some sphagnum moss, not gathered much 
any more. 
Insectivores: 
Bladderwort, pitcher plant, three different 
kinds of sundews -- five or six different varieties. 
It's as close to the middle of nowhere as you can get in the 
forest -- you can't hear the traffic (we can hear a plane 
overhead). 
He offers me his helmet to carry the sundew in. 
MH: 
Would you consider yourself a woodsman? 
CB: 
To a certain extent -- I spent a lot of time 
in the 
woods when I was growing up and, obviously, since I"ve been out 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 22 
here, part of my job is to spend a lot of time in the woods. 
I wouldn't consider myself a woodsman in the truest sense of the 
word. 
A real woodsman is someone that you can plunk down just 
about anywhere, that can totally live off the land, and knows 
how to manufacture different products from whatever grows around 
him. 
A true woodsman is difficult to find these days -- they're 
not a common commodity. (I think of the poem, "Woodsman, 
Woodsman, spare that tree--" 
in contrast to the romanticized 
view of woodsmen)--
MH: 
Who would you think of as a true woodsman? 
CB: 
Nobody in my acquaintance--I guess the guy we have for 
a naturalist is fairly close to being a good woodsman. 
He hunts, traps, fishes out here all the time, he has since 
he was born. 
His name is Ken Little, and he teaches in a local school. 
Not related to Si Little. 
He grew up 
in Browns Mills and 
spent lots of time in Whitessbogs. 
He's probably in his 
mid—thirties. 
He's quite a character. 
He'll give you a good 
ribbing without you really knowing it many times. 
16 min.: 
A real true woodsman--you can't be a woodsman 
without living in the woods. 
It has to be almost a day—to 
day thing for you to be considered a true woodsman. 
A true 
Piney is a term a lot of people have used with a negative 
connotation, and to local people it's not a negative 
connotation at all. 
To be a Piney you have to be someone 
whose family's been here for years and years and years. 
One fellow I worked with in Wharton forest--his family had 
been here since the late 1700's. 
He was almost a Piney. 
MH: So you could be a Piney without necessarily being a 
woodsman? 
CB: 
Oh, yeah. 
Many of the local 
inhabitants that are now 
referred to as Pineys are from outside. 
People have called 
me a Piney. 
MH: 
So Freeman Taylor would be considered a Piney? 
CB: Yeah -- maybe even by himself. 
We agree that it's an elusive term. 
We start to head back. 
it's now 7:30 and getting dark. 
He wants to go up and 
tour Whitesbog on the next go around. 
He doesn't have 
enough rangers to cover special areas. 
He only has two 
rangers to cover 30 thousand acres of forest to cover, which 
can't be done in one day. 
Nowhere near as bad as Wharton 
which has 100,000 acres. 
One time he worked from 7:OOa.m. 
to 2 a.m. there and only covered a fourth of the forest. 
Wharton gets more attention because of Batsto and the canoeing 
possibilities. 
There's another part of the ridge. 
The ridges and hollows 
don't seem to have names. 
A lot of places there might be only 
three or four people that call 
it by one name, and they haven't 
been common enough or well—known enough to be translated to the 
maps. 
Some of them are. 
Like the old Indian Causeway that 
crosses North Branch Road at a couple of points --that's what 
people have called it for years. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 23 
MH: 
What's a causeway? 
CB: 
Basically a through road -- names get changed sometimes 
-- like Mike's Crossway was probably at one point Mike's 
Causeway. 
MH: 
Do you know about Mary's Bridge? 
CB: 
Yeah. 
MH: 
Who was Mary? 
CB: 
Couldn't tell you. 
It's probably been Mary's Bridge 
Road for a hundred years now though. 
A lot of things are just 
names -- like who would have ever thought of Dead Ostrich Bog 
until we just decided one day we were going to call 
it Dead 
Ostrich Bog -- a hundred years from now people will think we 
were crazy. 
MH: 
Was there a pronouncement? 
CB: 
No we just started calling it that/ 
We had a woodcutting 
program that was going on 
in that area, so we spent a lot of 
time up there, and I"d ask Peg where she was going, and maybe 
she'd say, "Well, I think I'm gonna ride up to woodcut and maybe 
stop by Dead Ostrich bog." 
"Somebody'd call back to the office 
on the radio and you'd ask, "Where are you?" and they'd say 
"Dead Ostrich Bog." 
I don't think Peg even knew it was a bog 
when she first found an ostrich there -- 
it was all overgrown. 
So 
it just sorta came about bit by bit. 
A lot of names are 
that way, 
like Ong's Hat -- that was a name that, nobody can 
tell you why, but they all agree that there was a fellow 
named Ong and he had a hat -- and some say he and an argument 
with his girlfriend one night at a dance and three the hat 
up 
in the tree and it stayed there for so long that people 
called the place Ong's Hat. 
MH: 
Where did you hear that? 
CB: 
That was from Lou Grant -- or one of the old timers. 
It's a fairly common story. 
MH: 
Did you learn much from Lou Grant? 
CB: 
A lot of the things I learned about Whitesbog from 
him. 
He worked for the JJ White Company for God knows how 
many years. 
MH: 
Did you learn much about nature from him? 
CB: 
Not really. 
He wasn't much of a naturalist. 
He knew 
a lot of different things, but the knowledge of the average 
person living in the area about what's around them is minuscule 
compared to what's out there. 
You can talk to some of the 
natives here and start talkin' about Pine Barrens Tree Frogs 
and they'll say 
"What, frogs in trees?" 
We pass Freeman Taylor's house, and I ask who's house is 
across the street from Freeman, and Chris thinks it's Gary 
Patterson's house, then decides it isn't. 
(End of Side One) 
MH: 
So this is rattle road. 
CB Lives in Tuckerton. 
28 and a half miles. 
He goes 
clamming sometimes with a clamming rake, sometimes from a boat, 
sometimes in the mud flats. 
He doesn't know Bob Suralik. 
Clamtown, Tuckerton's nickname. 
(We pass Emmons house, near 
Reeves Bogs) 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 24 
Did I tell you the story of our resident squatter? 
Well, he 
still 
lives there. 
MH: 
Is he allowed 
CB: 
Nope. 
MH: 
How does he keep living there? 
CB: 
It's kind of 
interesting. 
There was a settlement there, 
basically migrant workers cottages, and when we took the land 
over -- it was sold to us by Bob Reeves' grandfather, back 
in 
the 60's and everybody moved out except for that one fellow who 
refused to move out, and the superintendent tried to have him 
evicted and it didn't work out, and for whatever the reason 
further on up 
in the chain of command they decided not to push 
the issue. 
There he stays to this day. 
MH: 
What does he do? 
CB: 
He worked for area blueberry growers. 
In fact he works 
for Bob Reeves' dad picking blueberries. 
Odd jobs, and he 
lives 
in the house at least part time. 
We're approaching Lebanon Lake. 
We pass someone. 
CB: 
I was beginning to think the woods were empty tonight. 
You can rest assured that no matter what hour of the day or 
night you're out here there's somebody somewhere in this forest. 
There's one man you can find out here all hours of the day or 
night. 
Walt Johnson. 
He's kind of a character. 
His 
family,this is one of the more unique stories, had a wake when 
his mother passed away -- they went out and had services 
actually held on Rogers' Road, which is a road out in the 
middle of nowhere on the eastern end of the forest, not 
particularly attractive, with just some old pine trees, 
nothing much there, but that was the place his mother and 
father used to love to go to picnic. 
And when his mother 
passed away that's where they went, held a funeral service 
and then they all came and they stayed in our campsites, the 
whole family. 
That was last summer. 
MH: 
What religion are they? 
CB: 
Don't know. 
There are people that had their ashes 
scattered around M 
Place, because they used to 
like to 
camp there. 
There are some unusual hobbies that people 
have. 
The Johnson have been around for years. 
Walt Johnson loves 
to be the first person to drive around on the road when the 
snow has freshly fallen. 
Everybody has to have a hobby. 
It's starting to rain. 
This is another busy road because 
of the people who work at the colony on different shifts.

In contrast to Wharton, 
Lebanon has lots of paved roads. 
90 miles of gravel road and 90 
of sand in Wharton (?). 
Story of the homeowners woodcutting lot. 
Consequence of leaving dead stumps is 
large population of red— 
headed woodpeckers. 
Also scarlet tanagers and bluebirds. 
Towhees common too. 
(plant) 
Sections of woods are named for the streams that run through 
them, Shinn's branch, McDonalds branch. 
Everything goes into the 
Rancocas Creek and then to the Delaware River. 
Dividing line is 
just east of the forest, then to the ocean. 
Story of the Penny 
Pine Plantation. 
The DAR solicited the money, ergo the other 
name, DAR Plantation. 
The road we're on has been there since the 
turn of the century. 
White Pines aren't native to the area, but 
it's a source of contention. Pinelands Commission spurns White 
Pine and Loblolly, though CB contends that they've been 
naturalized. 
Lots of introduced plants by headquarters: Chinese 
Chestnut, European Larch. 
Catalpa Trees were introduced as 
ornaments, no specific use. 
Cherry Trees, not chokecherry, but 
regular eating cherries. 
Holly is native, but more elaborated 
due to Elizabeth White's famed propagation projects, affected 
bird population. 
Local people call 
large pitch pines Bull Pines, 
as though they were different species. 
CB is from South Amboy. 
The cabins at Pakim Pond put in by the CCC. 
Pakim Pond came from 
a reservoir for an abandoned cranberry operation. 
Sometime in 
the 1800s it was dug. 
The campsite area is near the Lebanon 
Glassworks, built by the Richards Family, also connected with the 
Wharton Tract. 
They cut every tree in sight for the furnace.

How Dead Ostrich Bog Got Its Name 
One of my rangers, Peg Lister, Peg's pretty good, she's 
funny, I saw her the day after New Years, about two years ago, 
and she said, "I have to show you something." 
And she took me 
out in the woods, and there was a dead ostrich, 
in an old 
cranberry bog. 
(From Great Adventure?) We don't know where it 
came from, but probably from some place like that or somebody who 
keeps animals like that, but she thought it was definitely 
mafioso involved because it had no head and no feet. 
But we 
found out later that birds, when they're brought into the 
country, a lot of exotic animals, are tattoed, either on the 
legs, on the feet, or on the lip, as a way of showing the animal 
came in 
legally. 
So that's probably why they got rid of the head 
and the feet, 
so we couldn't find out where it came from. 
It was eaten by some wild dogs 
in the area, and then it 
gradually subsided into the bog, and go rained on. 
(So 
it became 
part of the bog, and Dead Ostrich Bog is rightly named!) It's 
Dead Ostrich Bog and will be forever. 
It's out toward Mt. Misery, by Reeves Bogs. 
(Why the Bear 
Hole?) 
The rumor has it that the last bear sighted in this area 
was shot out at Reeves Bogs, 
in that general vicinity, so that's 
why they call 
it the Bear Hole. 
(What about the Dry Ponds?) 
Dry Pond Road? 
Well, there 
used to be some Cedar over there, there is still, but it was 
probably wetter at one point, and just from the trees building up 
over a period of time, a bog will naturally change from water to 
dry land, through utrification, when it starts to settling in, 
and a lot of plants grow in 
it. 
(A lot of briars there now?) 
Well, some, not a lot. 
A lot of the areas take their names from local people, 
like 
Butler Place, there used to be a hotel at Butler Place, where the 
campsite is now. 
A stopping off point for people coming between 
Phila and the shore. 
We're near the glass house. 
You can tell the vicinity by 
the size of the oak trees, spared from a fuel destiny by 
proximity to homes needing shade. 
The cemetery there. 
He has 
had on—the—job training in forest fire fighting. 
Unofficial vs. 
official techniques. 
"It's different in South Jersey than in any 
other place in New Jersey, because of the Pine Barrens. The only 
way to really fight a fire sometimes is to set a backfire. I had 
experience fighting fires in North Jersey, and this area is the 
second worst area in the country for fighting fires. 
The worst 
in an area in California with more hills and hollows. 
The pitch pine, with its serotinous coned subspecies, that 
won't open unless there is a fire (found mainly on the Plains), a 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 27 
similar condition found out west. 
Not much is named in Lebanon, the topography isn't that 
diverse, 
it runs from 90 feet above sea level to about 30 over 
near Whitesbogs, but nothing stands out as a hill. 
A ridge runs 
right through the middle of the forest, by North Branch, but 
strangely enough, nobody ever named it. 
It's fairly obvious, 
when driving the roads you drive right over the top of 
it. 
The difference between North and South Branch was produced 
by the 1963 fire, which destroyed a broad band, started near 
Ong's Hat and 
in one day 
it burned from all 
the way near Ong's 
Hat to the coast, the wind shifted and turned around to the east 
and 
it came all the way back, to the eastern border of Lebanon. 
So that took a whole wide band out of the forest that never came 
back very well. You'll find a scrubby growth of Pines and a lot 
of scrub oak. 
It's very obvious that something happened there. 
Regarding the gates that now block off the roads. 
He 
realized that lots of people were wandering in from the shore to 
use the shower, riding through the campgrounds stealing things. 
That got the local people up 
in arms. "For a while they weren't 
sure whether to shoot me or lynch me." 
Lots of 
local people have 
used these routes for years. 
Deer drives, we open the gates for hunting season. 
We're 
now on Crosswicks Road. 
What about names for cedar swamps? 
They're countless, though a lot of them have names, this one here 
would be the head of Cooper's Branch. 
About the only one I know 
that has a definite name 
is up at the back of the Whitesbogs, 
there's a huge cedar swamp, and that's Job Swamp. 
A lot of the area's history is tied to Whitesbog, the only 
major settlement in the forest that still exists today. 
What of uses of the woods by age group, the younger people 
come out to drink beer, stay in the campsites, go swimming. 
The 
older generation are hunters, foxhunters, people like the man you 
met at gathering the mushrooms. 
People will gather pine cones to 
sell, the old trades that have been handed down from generation 
to generation in the Pine Barrens. 
By law people aren't supposed 
to take anything from the woods, but within reason around here 
people can gather, no pick—up trucks full for commercial reasons, 
etc. 
The pitch pine cones are not the ones they're after. 
White 
Pine and Loblolly have the more attractive cones. 
We've actually 
had cases where the forest floor is covered with pine cones after 
a windstorm, and the next day every single one of them is gone. 
They use burlap bags. 
We catch 'em, tell 
'em, knock it off, 
leave some for the rest of the people. 
Illegal use of motorcycles, dirt bikes. 
Difficult to catch 
a man on an unlicensed motorcycle. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 28 
Kids mostly use the woods in the vicinity of the 
developments. 
Years ago one of the rangers sent in a report of a 
Jersey Devil sighting. 
Connected with a cub scout incident, 
tongue in cheek, during the initiation ceremony a man appears in 
a costume dressed as the Jersey Devil, a costume that has changed 
over the years. 
They used to have an appearance every Memorial 
Day, and 
it got to be really big, there'd be 200 people listening 
to the guy tell the story and waiting for the appearance. belief 
We had a great—horned owl, this was his territory, and a lot 
of times at night you'd see something in the road and you'd get 
up on 
it and 
it would be huge. 
It was a Great—Horned Owl 
and 
he'd caught a rabbit or squirrel, he was having his supper. 
About a dozen varieties of owl 
around here. 
Pine Barrens Tree 
Frogs. 
Pine Snakes, Hog—nosed, Black Racers, couple varieties of 
watersnakes, rarely 
you'll find a timber rattler, cornsnakes or 
some of the others. 
There's a little bog near the office, full 
of PBTF in the spring. 
Starting to hibernate now. 
Behind the 
campsite, full of them. 
He used to work at Cheesequake State Park. The trees are a 
lot smaller, the forest is totally different. 
We were 
approaching Five Points, from Egg Harbor Road. 
Butterworth is a 
paved Road. 
Lebanon is nowhere near as crowded as parks in 
central Jersey, and what crowd you do get is different. Unlike 
Wharton and Bass River even, you don't get as many people out of 
the cities in Lebanon. "Lebanon has for years been kind of on the 
wayside. 
A lot of 
its past superintendents really didn't want 
crowds. 
Didn't put up any signs to guide people to the area." If 
they were to put signs up, they probably wouldn't stay anyway. 
Tourists would take them all, or the hunters would shoot them 
down. 
Any sign out in the woods becomes an 
immediate target for 
the hunters. 
We're headin over towards Glassworks Road, 
it sort of 
disappears for a while, 
it dead—ends where we turned. 
Five 
Points is actually six roads, but five corners. 
Dry Pond Road 
goes right off of 
it. 
Lebanon was started on February 20, 1908, with its first 
purchase of land. 
All the branches are tributaries of the 
Rancocas. 
We were on the Middle Branch of the Mount Misery 
Creek, by Beaver Bridge, so named for the beavers who dammed up 
the stream, and they kept using the bridge as a part of the dam. 
When fellows tried to use screen alongside the bridge to try and 
keep the beavers away, and the beavers used the screen to build 
the dam. 
They finally managed to win the battle, which is rare, 
usually beavers don't give up, but in this case they managed to 
convince them that it was better to go elsewhere, they either 
went upstream or downstream. 
He has never tried to catch waterbugs, which are reputed to 
smell 
like fresh strawberries. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 29 
This 
is a cedar cut we had a few years back--a commercial 
sale. 
A logger came in a took it all. 
We're just now making up 
a forestry management plan to determine what can be cut. 
The 
growth rate should equal what you cut. 
If you want to cut oak, 
and you know that you have two million board feet of oak in the 
forest and you know that it would take 75 years to grow a crop 
(CB radio interfering here). 
That's why foresters go to schools. 
We're on Mt. Misery Road. 
The Pinelands Commission has had 
an influence on how they cut wood--requiring a permit to do so. 
Strange relationship between PC and the state. 
Since 1308 we've 
had two camping areas, one at Deep Hollow which has been closed, 
and day use facilities at Pakim Pond, and the rest has been 
maintained and protected. 
We always looked at ourselves as 
preservers--but the PC attitude was that we were developers. 
We 
wanted to put in a couple of new day facilities, and they said we 
can't do that, we have to preserve the entire forest. 
People need areas to walk through for nature study and bird 
watching. 
We were coming up to North Branch Road, rising with 
the ridge. 
Doesn't know how high the Forked River Mountains are, 
for purposes of comparison. 
Lebanon Lakes--most populated area on boundary. 
Suggests 
flagging down some local kids. 
Saw a deer. 
Kids ride their bikes 
all through there. 
Water is a universal attraction for people. 
The NPS had a 
study years ago, 
in which they ranked different photographs 
according to a formula for scenic preferences. 
That section of 
North Branch Road did not go out to Route 70, but rather to the 
North Branch Bogs. 
They haven't been harvested for 30 or 40 
years. 
A rabbit by the pine tree. 
Fish and Game introduced twenty turkeys three years ago, and 
they've done quite well. 
Feeding animals--lovely patches of 
sweet potatoes and apples under a tree with a stand on 
it. 
Illegal to shoot animals under such circumstances. 
Anywhere 
there's something dead you'll find crows. 
Lot of fox. 
It's funn 
because they say that gray fox is more common than red fox here, 
I've seen lots of red fox. 
We were at the main reservoir of North Branch. 
Getting out 
of the truck, walking to another series of bogs, hand—dug back in 
the 1800's, a tremendous amount of work--took out the cedar trees 
put in the channels for water. 
Some trapping for fox and beaver. 
In Burlington county you can use leg—hold traps, but not in Ocean 
county. 
The forest straddles both counties. 
There are snappers 
all over around there. 
People trap them with fyke nets. 
A good 
trade in snappers locally. 
Families in Chatsworth--a couple of 
them, not noted for their friendliness--more known for being 
outlaws--a sign up 
in front of their house.

y 
and 
"It's kind of funny. 
Foxhunters don't really hunt fox. 
They don't shoot them. 
They run dogs. 
That's the real fun for 
them. 
I'm not familiar with any guys locally who trap fox. 
Trapping's more restricted than it was years ago." 
It's easier to count bogs in Lebanon than Cedar Swamps. 
The individual bogs I couldn't tell you. 
Whitesbogs itself has 
probably thirty of forty cranberry bogs. 
But the areas would 
just be Whitesbogs, North Branch, Reeves Bogs, Pakim, a couple 
scattered, no 
longer worked, 
like Dead Ostrich Bog, and one bog 
along the east side, by Pasadena..Edible sized cranberries." 
A few varieties may be native now--varieties that they can 
plant now and harvest in three years. 
Years ago 
it could take 7 
8, 
10 years. 
During hunting season this turns into a major 
highway. 
Deer count accomplished through general 
impressions, 
biologists do go out to cedar swamps and count deer droppings. 
Guess work at best. 
Hasn't run across a possum hunter yet. 
Coonhunters, yes. 
It's fun, dogs running around, howling away. 
Foxhunters will 
run sometimes as close as Shinn's Branch, but 
mostly stay away from the populated areas. 
We were passing an old hunting cabin. 
Private property of a 
gunning club, the cabin had burned down. 
"Once you set the dogs 
loose on a fox, the only thing to do is try to follow them 
around, and a lot of times they go down the swamp and the hunter 
will drive the different roads around the swamp just listening to 
see 
if he can find out where they are." 
A rabbit. 
Coming out to 
Butler Place where we'll see a plantation that, much to the 
horror of the Pinelands Commission, 
if they ever knew, but it's 
actually a hybrid plantation, a cross between pitch and loblolly, 
cross—pollinated—What they were trying to do, see pitch pine 
is 
kind of crummy lookin' tree, 
it doesn't grow very straight, 
it 
doesn't grow very fast, 
it has a lot of knots, very weak wood. 
Loblolly on the other hand is a fast growing tree, 
it grows nice 
and straight, it's surprising how strong the wood is, a good 
product. 
So we're hoping to get Loblolly that's more disease 
resistant, and Pitch Pine that's a better product. " The sign 
reads: "Pitch X Loblolly/To produce superior trees for tomorrow's 
forests." 
Planted in 1974. 
Take a look at the size of these 
trees. 
In nine years. 
A pitch pine would be half this size. 
The Pitch/Loblolly plantation, just north of Goose Pond, the only 
natural body of water we have in the forest.

be a train track carrying Philadelphia people into Browns Mills. 
Caroline has a picture of the old glass house. 
The train stopped 
running before Norman's day, 
in the early twenties. 
We passed an 
overgrown blueberry field and the old station house where all the 
freight used to come in, near the True Vine Baptist Church. 
The 
railroad station was all along there. 
The tracks were torn up 
in 
1967 or so. 
Everybody came and took some of the railroad ties. 
They didn't 
get any. 
They were sold for bulkhead. 
The rest 
were scavenged. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 32 
Norman doesn't think yucca plants are native. 
We just 
turned (turn signal audible). He thinks they remain from old 
homesteads. 
Others have just been dumped. 
We just passed George 
Taylor's old blueberry field (Norman's deceased brother). 
George's son continues to operate the blueberry field. 
Named 
George Taylor's blueberry patch. 
Passed the house of one of 
Milton Reeves' hired hands. 
George Dean bought a log cabin 
that's been covered over and moved from Upper Mill to Magnolia. 
095 
We were on Greenwood Bridge Road. "This here's the area 
where a lot of natives, they swam for years (NB the use of the 
term "native", we've hardly ever discussed it.), 
it's where they 
used to swim all out of G—New Lisbon; 21GT, right here. 
That's the 
swimmin' hole, yup." (It was the self—same place that Barry Brady 
had brought me 
in August to munch on sandwiches from the Deli on 
530.)" 
People still go there. "Janie and Eddie and Sandy they 
always come over here and go swimming, yeah." 
Had too many beer 
parties here, and some kids got together and cleaned it up. 
recreation 
Greenwood Bridge is the name of the bridge. 
There's a rope 
there for people to swing out into the water on. 
TX02: On our way to G—Lower Mill; 21GT, formerly powered by water. 
Norman hasn't been there for years, though he lived there as a 
kid. 
The house was burned down in 1923 or 24. 
They've both 
helped to fight fires locally. We just passed the road that goes 
to the Handboards, to Presidential Lakes. 
A place where three or 
four roads come together, they used to call 
it the handboards. 
They still do, 
it's right there in the middle of the woods, 
it's 
not used anymore. 
Lower Mill 
is marked on the map as such, according to Norman. 
So named for a mill his father operated. 
Evidence of a former 
house is given by a clump of grapevines that Caroline stops to 
fondle, 
and they talk about making wreathes out of them, 
deploring the $40.00 charge that accompanies store bought 
wreathes. 
They make a circle out of some of 
it. 
Norman figures 
out how to get down to the stream to get a look at where the mill 
used to be. 
We pass a plant that's been spray—painted blue. 
Caroline and I are a long way behind Norman. 
We finally catch 
up. 
She mentioned that when they cleared off their land she 
picked ferns till she was blue in the face. 
Norman is fairly 
excited, pointing out that you can see why it's appropriate for a 
mill to be there, where two streams come together. 
"Look how 
quick the water is." 
They notice a shotgun shell. 
"You can see 
the piling down there where the old mill used to set." He hasn't 
been there for twenty years. 
He was four or five years old when 
the house burned down. 
Caroline hadn't ever been there before. 
"That's a lot of water flowing." 
"For as low as the water is." 
"They dammed this up here, Caroline, they could hold the head up 
here, and like at night they'd leave the head get there and then 
in the daytime leave so much through, by opening the gate, and 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 33 
they'd get the power that way, the gates used to be right in here 
some place. 
Here's where two streams come together, here's from 
Upton Station, not Upton Station, but from Upper Mill ... Here's 
where they could harness two streams and get all their water 
power. 
Years ago there'd be a dam up here and they could hold a 
head of water up here behind the gates. 
At night they'd close 
the gates and get another storage of water for the next day's 
work. Lumber probably brought by horse and wagon, cut from all 
through the woods there. 
Upper Mill 
is right where Presidential 
Lakes is now. 
They made lakes out of cranberry bogs there. 
"There's a pepper plant, Caroline. They bloom and, real good 
smellin', they make suds, wash their hands in 
it and every thing 
else." 
Me: Who? Norman: 
I wash my hands in 
it. 
Too much wind noise. 
We make our way back to the road. 
Norman identifies a vine as fox grapes, different than regular 
grape, wine grape. 
A poke plant, you can eat when it's young, 
just like spinach. 
We see a chipmunk. 
We stop at a little trash heap, which gets dissected. 
Discussion of Green Acres property, bought from a speculator 
named West. 
Side Two: 
The lake was created for the mill, by putting in a dam. 
Grandpop probably did work the mill. 
We're going 
to Turkey 
Buzzard Bridge. 
There's where Batoga Trail starts at Carpenters 
Springs. 
Runs to Apple Pie Hill, Sheep Pen Hill. 
Sheep raising 
occurs over on the other side of Wrightstown. 
Freeman has goats 
but not sheep. 
An oriental 
lady gathered ferns on their property 
every year, was going to bring some over for Freeman to taste. 
She's done it for fifteen or twenty years. 
TX03: 
The CC's put in most of the roads. 
We're on G—Turkey 
Buzzard Road; 21GT now. 
Caroline gets disoriented sometimes 
driving through the woods, but she can usually come out near 
where she wants to go. 
The sign for Carpenter Springs is hard to 
locate, put up by the State, and possibly torn down. 
Can't find 
it. 
Used to run dogs here all the time. Doesn't anymore because 
of traffic and the probability that people in Presidential Lakes 
would complain about the dogs. "I'll come back here and run 
rabbit dogs, but not a big bunch of dogs like fox dogs...They 
don't go as far, you can handle 'em a lot better. 
This is another CC road. 
All this property they bought from 
West. 
He used to have horses and every Saturday and Sunday he'd 
come down and ride this line. 
Turkey Buzzard Bridge Road and 
West Line is the way to refer to 
it. 
Bill Reeves owned the 
other side of 
it. 
Everything in between is the state's. Reeves 
sold to a developer who never developed it. 
No controversy over 
that, who would have thought anybody would want to live 
in the 
woods. 
We were coming into G—Presidential Lakes; 21GT, which is 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 34 
really G—Upper Mill; 21GT. 
These used to be cranberry bogs, 
believe it or not. 
The dam was already there, so they just had 
to flood the bogs. 
TX04: 
People fish in the lake G—Presidential Lakes; 21GT. 
Used 
to be called Upper Mill, on the Rancocas Creek. 
Only thing along 
here used to be a gun club, King Court Gun Club (near Nevada 
Terrace and Oregon Trail). 
Norman used to hunt with the Browns 
Mills Gun Club, with Johnny Earlin. 
Everybody out of Browns 
Mills belonged to 
it. 
Jack Davis. 
Johnny made a cabin right 
where it's at now, and that was the end of the gunnin' of us, 
people wouldn't go that far to go gunning. 
We usually met at the 
Chevrolet Garage, down near Jack Davis, 
Johnny Earlin's place. 
We hunted for deer during deer season, five days, 
it used to be 
one time. 
Met other guys out in the woods while gunning. 
We're 
going through G—Lebanon Lakes; 27GT. 
Freeman always gunned with 
US. 
Norman stopped thirty years, right before or right after 
Janie was born. 
MH: Why don't people gun when they get older? 
Norman: When you get older, I guess you 
Caroline: 
lose interest in 
it 
MH: 
Is Eddie interested in gunning? 
Caroline: Not much. 
I thought we were on Woodmansie Road. 
Norman said, "I guess you 
could call 
it Woodmansie Road. 
I call 
it Reeves's Bog Road. 
Right here 
is Reeves's Bogs. 
This is all owned by the state 
here. 
I worked for Mr. Reeves until I went in the service in 
1341. 
My father he worked here with us, he had a sawmill right 
there, done all 
the sawin'. 
His dad operated "quite a few" 
mills. 
Points out the old sortin' house 
at Reeves Bogs. 
Whose house is this? 
Norman: The state owns it now, Gene 
Emmons lives into 
it. 
(We pull 
into the driveway, a couple of 
men standing in 
it). 
Norman: You're not s'posed to be workin' on that tractor. 
Ans: 
Ain't s'posed to work on the tractor. 
Norman: Nope. 
Emmons: 
What are you doin? Just ridin' around? 
Norman: Just lookin' things over. 
Where's that John at 
today? 
He's out workin'? 
I hear 'im, oh, he's brushin. 
Caroline: There he 
is over there. 
(on a machine on the bog) 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 35 
Norman: 
What do you got, a pretty good crop of cranberries 
this year? 
Emmons: Good crop 
Norman: Good crop? Good. 
More 
on good conditions, they have crops down in Toms River too, 
Double Trouble, John Traina and Fred Mun. 
Norman asks whether 
Donny Lee has been up with his rabbit dogs here, he apparently 
has. 
Cranberries ripen better in the sandy spots because the 
vines aren't as thick. 
Norman thought they would dry harvest 
here, but he was mistaken. 
They all wet—harvest. 
All three of them reminiscing about the Italians who used to 
come here, and about their ovens, and how everyone looked forward 
to 
it. 
Refers to McDonald's Branch, the $670,000 appropriated to 
check the water. 
Discussion about the possibility of putting cabins in over 
by Deep Hollow, "Years ago it seemed like they had a good head of 
water over there and then it would get almost dry." 
Norman 
thinks the state closed it down because someone drowned in there. 
Every year they put sand on the bogs, to keep the mud firm? They 
get a twenty—five year lease at Double Trouble but can only have 
a one year lease in Lebanon. 
We just come from Lower Mill. I just walked down the crick 
in there and by Jeez there was enough briars in there, what are 
they, blackberry briars? 
Not even a path down the crick no more. 
I used to 
live there, Lower Mill, yeah." 
Caroline: "For water 
that's so 
low it's moving fast." 
Norman: "It used to be the 
going mill of their day, didn't it?" 
"The water was goin' there 
pretty fast today."

Norman doesn't kill that many rabbits. 
Never 
was much of a deer eater. 
Bobby wouldn't let people kill 
the 
quail around here. 
Somebody's deer dogs got them. 
They used to 
come up 
in the yard and eat with the chickens. G—Lebanon State 
Forest; 27GT 
Norman: 
Years ago you used to know everybody, and "I'll bet 
you don't know two people out of ten you meet today, do you? " 
Bobby: now you go two steps and you run into a store. 
Norman 
lamenting the presence of Presidential Lakes. 
Caroline pointing 
out that you can't 
leave anything anymore. 
Norman: 
How's young bobby?

Buster and Gene Emmons.

They're starting the cranberry harvest 
here next Thursday. 
They clean the bogs, they'll start Cooper's 
Branch this morning. 
We take off. 
"They were born and raised here, the house on

They hunt some, but I wouldn't

We're about to go over to MacDonald's branch. 
Norman 
telling Caroline about how the place was just like a town when 
the Italians came in every summer. 
Caroline remembers the 
shanties. 
We pass some blueberries that have "grown up to the 
point where they don't count anymore." 
Norman lived there for 
years, working for his uncle. 
The water table's down because 
it's been a dry summer.

2MIK: 
TXO1: Going over the quadrangle of G—Lacey; 43GT Township with 
Richard Gille. 
A road coming out of Lanoka Harbor called Mount 
Laurel Boulevard wasn't there when Gille was a kid. 
Has no idea 
of anyone trapping for muskrats anywhere in the area, apart from 
some kids who might be doing it. 
The state game farm is there 
now, and many of the properties are posted. 
The sgf raises quail 
and pheasant for releasing into the state forests, for hunting 
season. 
There's evidence of a hay road on the map, that was used 
when they used to go down and take the marsh hay, the salt hay, 
so they would have roads that would go from the farm houses down 
to the meadows, and also would give them access to the oyster 
landings. 
Laurel Boulevard got its start that way !?>. 
All 
around Stout's Creek is marsh area. 
Gille used to trap for 
muskrats when he was a kid. Most of 
it 
is now posted property. 
Local people work in the state game farm -- some of the workers 
are youth from the correctional institutions. 
There's a new development called "Cranberry Hill". 
R75 = 
residential 75 -- the lots were 7500 square feet. 
R100s are a 
higher class of density. 
Most people work out of town, except 
for the trade people, the plumbers and electricians and 
carpenters who built the houses. 
They live here. 
outsiders 
Another small development called Oak Hill and West Woods, 
and there's an Oak Hollow. 
Quail Hill 
is another one. The 
developer's name it when they file a subdivision. 
So the name 
hangs in there, because they have to refer to 
it when they go to 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 39 
inspect it. 
MH: What happens to the older names? 
RG: They disappear -- who would be there to relate? 
Let me 
show you where I was born. 
(I put an asterisk by 
it) 
There's a 
foundation there where I was born, and when I was a kid the train 
used to stop here to pick up water, and there was a small 
little 
stop house -- there wasn't actually a station. 
We called that 
Ostrum. 
But only somebody like me or Johnny Parker or Cliff 
Frazee would know if I said Ostrum that I was talkin' about that. 
That was right along the railroad. 
The train that ran there was 
steam 
and they had to pick up the water there. 
So they called 
that part of town Ostrum, and when I was a kid we said we didn't 
live 
in Forked River, we lived 
in Ostrum. 
But only I would know 
that, and a handful of natives. 
The Sunrise Beach area actually came out of the Bollinger 
Farm. 
We called it the Bollinger Farm. 
The first road that 
went into Sunrise Beach went to the Bollinger's Farm, and when 
they took over the farm -- they picked up on that road, because 
back in the old days people weren't smart and they put the roads 
on the high ground. 
They put them in the swamps today. 
(I think 
he's kidding) 
So 
in the Forked River Beach, the whole beach area -- and 
if 
you looked at the tax map you'd see the street Riparian Grant 
that was the street track. 
So that was their river house and 
their bowling alley and a couple little outhouses for the 
workers, right? 
So we called that the Street Place. 
All Forked 
River Beach was developed from the Street Place. 
A Riparian is a grant from the state of New Jersey that 
gives you the water rights. 
Street's Place belonged to James 
Street. 
Goodluck still carries its name. 
The Goodluck Cemetery, 
the Goodluck Church. 
He doesn't know what denomination it 
is. 
He doesn't know of any outstanding singing in any of the churches 
on 
Sunday morning. 
The volunteer fire companies: 
The Forked River Fire Company 
is the oldest, established ca. 1929. 
It has most of the old 
timers in 
it, although the companies are generally mixed. 
But 
most of the old timers live 
in Forked River. 
Lanoka Harbor is 
the next oldest company -- organized about 20 years ago, and 
Bamber was the last fire company. 
But the Bamber Lake area has 
its own history and he's not too familiar with it. 
MH: What percentage of the people around here would consider 
themselves Baymen? 
RG: One percent, if that. 
Very, very slim. 
The Penns are 
all 
deceased, some of the children and grandchildren are still 
around, but they can't make a living at it. Very few people 
--
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 40 
if you get people working in the Bay today, the large majority of 
'em are not native people. 
Like Ridgway (Merce), I think he 
still makes a livin 
in the bay, but you don't find much of that 
anymore in this area. Down south, when you get below Manahawkin 
-- you go down West Creek and those areas, you'll find 'em more. 
Here we don't have -- I don't believe we have anybody that makes 
a living on the Bay anymore -- they might do something as a part 
time thing. 
I have a cousin named Evans Wilbert, he's a 
shrimper. 
He hasn't had a shrimp boat in the water for a couple 
of years, matter of 
fact he's building one now. 
He's on Jones 
Road. 
The boat's in his yard right now, he's workin on 
it. 
He also mentions Sam Hunt and Joe Reid. 
One of the things that we wanted to preserve in this area 
was the boat works, which is family operated, -- it's operated by 
the Grant family. 
They repair boats, and Sammy Grant was also a 
boatbuilder. 
And his brother also built boats. 
We came out and 
included all 
the boat works in our historic sites area, because 
our heritage comes from boats, but that's a dyin art too. 
If you 
talk to Sam you know that. 
Crabbing: 
It's all 
city slickers. 
They come down and get 
their little basket of crabs to make spaghetti sauce I suppose. 
MH: How do they learn? 
From them comin and being guided, way back when, and then 
they just carry that on. 
The people that run the places and sell 
the bait and stuff, 
like the row boat rentals, they tell them. 
They're not so much old timers -- they are people who came here 
for years and retired here and opened a place. 
There are not 
that many old timers. 
It's dwindled right down to almost 
nothing. 
In other words, there's a Cornelius in town who still 
clams like Ridgway does, -- that's from his childhood. His 
parents taught him how to catch -- do tongin, or clammin, or 
rakin, -- he does do crabbin in the winter, but he's a dyin 
breed. 
MH: 
Is all 
of Lacey in the Pinelands? 
RG: Lacey Twp 
is over 86 square miles. 
The area west of the 
parkway, almost two thirds of Lacey, 
is 
in the Pinelands. 
Almost 
all 
of that is 
in the preservation area. 
Forest takes up one 
quarter of the area. 
The rest is preservation. 
The area east of 
the parkway is CAFRA regulated. 
Within CAFRA you also have 
wetlands that are DEP regulated, but jurisdiction lies with 
CAFRA. 
land management 
MH: How does that affect the traditional activities? 
RG: There are pros and cons. 
In my opinion -- 
it has nothing 
to do with CAFRA. 
What has happened to us 
is not affected by 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 41 
CAFRA. 
CAFRA helps the old—timers. 
The reason we don't have the 
clammin and the fishin 
is that we didn't have the regulations 
and the people moved in, 
and the people that were makin a livin 
in the bay and stuff moved south -- they're down in Crisfield, 
Maryland, and CAFRA came in and put things in Limbo, and that's 
where I differ from the people that employ me. 
I like the 
control. 
They dislike the control, because they have to satisfy 
their constituents who want growth, want to make money--the real 
estate people. 
But they have a valid point too, because life 
goes on. 
I can live with it. 
But it's too late to save the way 
back when. 
But we can save what we have now, which is, you know, 
we have a beautiful town right at the moment. 
If you fly over 
it, 
it's beautiful. 
Cedar Creek, 
in fact, the entire layout of 
the town, with all 
the creeks goin up and the docks and the boats 
there, and the sparseness of the houses in these areas, even 
though it looks crowded here, when you get up 
in the air it's not 
that crowded. 
It's just beautiful from the air, this town. 
MH: Are any other towns around here that you think are 
beautiful from the air? aesthetics 
RG: Well, each town has had its own beauty. 
I think that 
because of the Forked River, the Cedar Creek and Oyster Creek, 
Lacey is the most beautiful. 
Berkeley is beautiful, Toms River 
is a beautiful place from the air, but it's more crowded -- but 
Toms River's a beautiful river. 
But we have the prime rivers. We 
have the Oyster Crick, the Cedar Crick, and the Forked River, the 
North, South and Middle Branch. 
No one has that. 
We also have 
the lakes that you can pick out when you're in the air. 
The head 
of the North Branch. 
MH: Duck hunting? 
RG: The Stout's Crick Gunning Club -- most of the area owned 
by Forsythe, back of Mary Grove, 
in the Point Pleasant area. 
MH: Decoy carvers? 
RG: Hurlin Cornelius and some of them, they carve their own, 
but they're not known decoy carvers. 
Evans Wilbert, he carves 
his own, but the natives don't do much duck hunting any more. 
But Cornelius, Wilbert, the Grants, they wouldn't go out to a 
carver. 
They'd build their own boat also. 
Cornelius lives not 
far from Wilbert. 
Just continue out on Jones Road, turn right, 
on Horner Lane, then right on Melvin, and left on Center street, 
you can't miss it. 
AT & T had a wireless station here. 
It hasn't been 
functional since World War II. 
Here was Hollywood Farm, where 
Cliff Frazee used to live. 
He's a hunter, woodsman, forester --
MH: What's a woodsman? 
Hufford--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 42 
RG: A guy that goes in, chops wood, hunts, spends the 
greatest part of his time there, walks in 
'em, enjoys them. 
That's a woodsman in my book. 
MH: Were there always people around that you called 
woodsmen? 
RG: 
Yeah, we heated and cooked by woodstove -- everybody 
was self—sustaining -- we all chopped wood, and we all done that, 
but there are people that can't get it out of their system, 
like 
Cliff. 
He gets 
in his truck and goes up 
in the woods, he could 
stay there all 
day, and he's in heaven, you know. 
MH: Could a woodsman also be a bayman? 
RG: Yup. Cliff has done both. 
He's a prime example of what 
a hillbilly or a native is. 
And he's older than me by about 20 
yea r  . 
MH: 
What's happening to the Forked River Mountains (re: the 
Save the Forked River Mountain group) 
RG: There is nothing happening to the Forked River 
Mountains, and nothing has since World War II. 
There are several 
mining operations near the Forked River Mountains, but no mining 
on the Forked River Mountains. The Forked River Mountain, The 
Middle Mountain, and the West Mountain. 
None of those are being 
mined. 
The top of 
it's flat, but they built a watch tower on top 
of that in WWII, to watch the practice range. 
And they cut these 
paths through the woods, and this was actually the shooting 
alleys. 
Along the railroad they had the ammo houses -- these 
square brick houses along the railroad, where they stored 
ammunition. 
But nothing is contemplated there -- I handle the 
mining permits, and they can't get a permit unless they had one 
before Pinelands. 
The elevation of the Forked River Mountains is 
184 feet. 
To get there, you pick up a power line from Lacey Road, 
follow that in to the Mountain Road. 
After a rain thought the 
mud puddles are pretty deep. Cliff can give you the name of every 
road. 
Wells Mills, Star Tree, everything. 
Very few houses in Bamber. 
Not many old timers there. 
The 
community was first named Cedar Crest, and there were orchards 
out there. 
The Supsees (?) are the oldest family. 
The Cedar 
Crest people did charcoaling, and had the orchard. 
Gille went away for 22 years with the service, so he feels 
disassociated with some of 
it. 
Webbs Mills is an old 
settlement, found on the 1890 map -- the Cruscia (?) family lives 
there yet.

He mentions the historic areas they are trying to preserve, 
and recommends talking with Wilbert, his aunt May Sherman, a 
member of the historical society, and Lillian Taylor, the oldest 
born native in Lacey Township -- she's 87 and sharp as a tack, 
also Hannah Brower, six months older than Lillian, but she was 
born in Waretown. 
He offers to take me on a short drive, to show me where 
these people live. 
Makes arrangements with Cliff. 
Telephone being dialed. Talking with Lucille "It's only 
about the woods, so don't get excited." 
Gille's going to a funeral this weekend, due a tragic death 
in the family, so he says he's glad to talk to someone about 
something that takes his mind off of 
it, since he'll be 
in 
limbo 
for three days. 
We're walking around now. 
Gille says native people will 
never live 
in 
lagoon areas. 
Developers try to promote the lagoon 
areas, but natives lived 
in the woods where they were protected 
from the wind, and the wood supply was near. 
So the people who 
move into the lagoon areas find how cold it 
is 
in the winter, but 
it's desirable in the summer. 
In the old times, the Indians 
lived on the shore in the summer, but in winter they went back to 
the mountains. 
What's happened with people has gone against 
nature. They've destroyed the area that's between the woods and 
the bay -- that's the prime reason that the fish are 
in the bay, 
that's the area it's too bad CAFRA couldn't have saved. 
We're driving now. 
There are no beaches to the bay. 
There 
are several private beaches, not much good for swimming, just sun 
bathing. 
No wave action, no depth, 
lots of mud, broken beer 
bottles and clam shells. 
He recommends Oyster Creek for good 
seafood (down at Leeds Point). 
Gille's official title is 
director of the department of community development. Zoning and 
planning coordinator, code enforcement officer. 
He handles 
mining operations. 
Soil erosion agency is 
involved and so 
is the 
Pinelands Commission. Board of Health is under him. 
There are only two natives working for the municipality, 
including himself. 
Not much communication between Forked River 
and Waretown at an official 
level, but when he was growing up 
there was a lot of walking back and forth, because all 
the girls 
lived 
in Waretown and all 
the boys lived 
in Forked River. 
My 
grandmother lived in Waretown. 
Right there is Lillian Taylor. 
There's a house boat they are classifying as a historic 
site. 
It played an important part -- it was the only place to 
eat when you went fishing, when this was a fishing community 
before World War II. 
Mrs. Brower's house. 
She's the oldest 
person, but she was born in Waretown. 
You'll probably have to 
have someone like me to introduce you to Hurlin Cornelius. 
He 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 44 
makes his whole living clamming. 
(We pass a Martin house with 
chimneys on 
it) 
This is Jones Road -- the one that went to Hollywood Farm. 
Wilbert's boat -- a traditional garvey, modified to be a shrimp 
boat. 
He's added a cabin. 
They probably started out with 
canvas shelters. 
He's one of the last shrimpers in the area. 
We 
say hi 
to Tootie, Wilbert's wife, whose parents were also 
clammers. 
He takes me past Cliff's house. All the area on the end of 
Jones Road is still called the Hollywood Farm. 
Even a developer 
might stick with that name. 
"This guy here is from the Grant 
Family, and he operates the boat works ." (that was his house) 
The mountain guy here, this is Cliff Frazee. 
He's the guy 
you gotta get for the woods. 
I don't know anybody 
in Lacey knows 
more about the woods than him. 
127 Caldwell Street. 
693-2206. 
15 minutes. MH: Where does he go to get the shrimp? 
RG: Cross the bay -- clam island, sedge island, they go over 
there and they drop these two nets down, and they tow 'em, and 
they're grass shrimp, right? And they lift the nets, clean the 
grass and the cabbage and the seaweed, and then put 'em 
in shrimp 
cars, and put 'em back 
in the water and keep em alive. they'll 
have a stake out in the water somewhere and the guy that's goin 
bass or weakfishin will come and pick up his cars -- it'll 
be 
prearranged, right? And he'll have his car tied to that stake, 
right? 
The shrimp are tiny, only for bait. 
Wilbert has two or 
three customers. 
There's not many shrimpers, and not many who 
use the bait. 
The arrangements happen on shore. 
Owen Ridgway 
would say, well I got a party Friday and Saturday, could you make 
arrangements for the shrimp, and he would say, how many you want? 
Twenty quarts or fifty quarts or whatever. 
Evans would catch it, 
tie the car to a stake, and Ridgway would pick it up, see.

BT: And we're gonna find out when the first Thompsons 
lived 
in this house. 
G—Vincentown; 23GT 
Mary Ellen Thompson lived there first, her mother. 
Berry picking: We started off 
in the spring and picked 
cultivated strawberries. 
Her father took everything to market in 
Bristol, Pa. 
to be there in the morning when the market opened. 
Something like out west, he used a covered wagon. 
They'd start 
out at night. 
In the spring of the year, a little after memorial 
day. 
After that we went huckleberrying. 
It wasn't the upland 
huckleberries, 
it was the swamp huckleberries. 
We picked them 
during the summer. 
In the fall we went 
cranberrying -- they 
didn't flood them then, we had to get down on our knees. 
Then we 
went and sorted cranberries in the sorting houses. 
I got 37 and 
a half cents a day when I was thirteen or fourteen years old. 
agriculture 
BT: Working clothes? 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 46 
Heavy blue—denim skirts. 
Her mother made protective 
covering for the hands out of childrens' stockings. Wore heavy 
gloves for planting the vines. 
Set them out with the handle from 
the top of the shovel -- a piece of steel was fastened to the 
shovel handle. Budd's Bogs, Haines bogs, they were all 
around. 
She remembers people building the bogs. 
Removing stumps by hand, 
dig the bog by hand. The big stuff was taken out, sometimes the 
little stuff was left in. 
Lots of times there were men who 
punched the holes and we went along behind dropping the vines in. 
We got a dollar a day, but it was a ten hour day. 
We walked from 
here to Burrs Mills (route 70). 
The family had bogs then. 
Aunt Alva: My mother made bonnets and she would take cedar 
and shave the cedar down real thin to put these slats in the 
bonnet so 
if 
it rained on 
it 
it wouldn't drop down in your face. 
Grandma: We didn't use cedar, we used paste—board. 
Alva: My mother used cedar. 
Brad: The bonnets were for huckleberries? 
Alva: It was for everything. 
Alva's daughter: It kept you from getting freckles. 
BT: What else did you pick in the summer? 
Alva: We had a horse that 
was afraid if somebody wasn't 
with him in the wagon, so I had to stay with him. 
More re: picking -- use of home—made baskets of willow, with 
handles and straps. 
Her father farmed here, raised cattle and 
chickens. They had hogs, generally went to the store to 
Pemberton. 
They went in the fall of the year, and that would 
last them ti) spring. They canned things in jars, buried cabbage 
in the dirt. 
They knew when to plant the late and early crops of 
cabbage. 
There were twenty—five or fifty heads (?) . They made 
outside cellars with turf and stones. They filled cabbage with 
pepper hash -- a mixture of cabbage, red and green pepper, celery 
seed, 
like a relish. They'd put it 
in a great big crock. 
Gram has tomatoes, peaches, plums, strawberries, 
raspberries, everything laid up for winter. foodways 
BT: What about boiling down fatback for lard? 
Gram doesn't do that anymore. 
BT: Any unusual things? 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 47 
They had ninety pound watermelons that had to be pushed in 
wheelbarrows. 
They didn't have much to do with county fairs because they 
occur in blueberry season. 
Gram has a half — acre of vegetables this year. The flowers 
are all separate. 
She lives between Red Lion and Vincentown. 
She has her own corn, lima beans, spinach, broccoli. 
Alva recalls raising hops for yeast, for making bread. 
They 
always kept a pan of yeast warm on the back of the stove, for 
pancakes. 
You added to 
it all the time. 
Hot bread: 
if eaten 
right out of the oven with lots of butter it will make you sick 
They used to go out in the woods looking for trailing 
arbutus -- a nice—smelling pink flower. 
They'd get together 
after school to do that. (plant) 
Gram: the diff between yams and sweet potatoes. 
Yams are 
juicy, sweet potatoes are drier. 
More on differences between swamp huckleberries and 
blueberries. 
About a woman (Elizabeth White, though she isn't 
names) who'd give $2.00 for the biggest berries. 
The upland 
berry is tough skinned and low growing, whereas swamp 
huckleberries grow up high. 
There were little tiny berries 
called billberries -- they growed on a string. 
You've seen 
cherries, haven't you? 
They growed on a stem like a cherry. 
And 
the June berries grew about 6 or 8 inches high. 
Gram's mother 
made pies out of them. 
They canned the berries. 
Worms got in 
them in august. 
Brad: The ladies took care of the gardens? 
Well, grandpop went through it with a plough, and grandmom 
did all the hoeing. (division of 
labor) 
Side two 
Alva's father always got a good price for his chickens. 
They had to look ahead to the winter in the summertime. They made 
summer and winter underwear out of muslin and flannel 
respectively. 
She has some at home yet. 
Grandfather wore the 
overalls -- bib types -- work ones and best ones for the store. 
Brad: Gram did a lot of home remedies. Maybe you ladies can 
tell us what you did when someone got sick. 
Alva: When we had a temperature we had pantin leaves 
(plantain?) if you had a temperature they used to get these big 
old things and wrap them around your wrists. 
And they was always 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 48 
cold in the middle of the day. 
When those would get warm they'd 
get some more. 
We never went to a doctor with a cold. 
MH: Kidney ailments? 
Alva: Never had any. We used to get niter (?) but you can't 
get it any more. You used to be able to get all kinda linaments, 
but you can't now. 
Brad mentions elk horn. 
They used cherry salve also for 
drawing splinters out. 
Estlow salve was an old family recipe for 
that stuff. 
Gram: When Brad got bit by a dog as a little boy the 
druggist let me have some niter without a prescription, because 
he knew me. 
Brad sets the record straight about who fixed the school up 
that Mary—Ann Thompson worked on. 
It was his father and Bill 
Haines. 
They didn't have school every winter. 
They're showing me 
some pictures. 
education 
Alva moved up here after she was married. 
She was born and 
raised about a mile and a half from here, 
in a house that looked 
something like this. Always had rose bushes. 
Had a grape arbor 
that was almost like a room. 
It had to rain real hard to get wet 
under it. 
Hunting? 
Gram hunted. 
She did whatever her five brothers 
did. 
She hunted for rabbits and raccoon, used hunting dogs. 
Her 
five brothers always showed her off. 
Hound dogs, beagles, were 
the best. 
They didn't know Jake Meredith. 
In later years the 
Tices raised foxhounds. 
You could buy one of the best for five 
dollars. 
Pop—pop swaps 'em. 
Mistletoe. 
There was a Richendaler who used to shoot it out 
of the maple trees around Christmas time. 
Mrs. Buzby's father 
used to get it. 
How their family came to be their. 
Alva's uncle and 
grandfather settled up near Hedger House when Chatsworth was 
still a resort for rich people. 
Most people around here never 
joined a gun club. 
They used to go out and watch the deer at 
dusk. 
Alva's grandfather had mules, 
and he cleaned up all 
the 
ground around here. They came from Alsace—Lorraine. Her 
grandmother died at the age of 58. She was a real stout and jolly 
woman. history 
Alva climbed in back of the stove one time to help her clean 
it out, emerged all soot covered, and her grandmother gave her a 
bar of fels naptha soap and sent her home to show her mother what 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 49 
she looked like. 
Her grandfather always had two cows, and 
generally his mules. 
Had their own milk. 
Hog—killing. 
Gram: A lotta work. All the neighbors got 
together to do each other's. 
It was a lot of fun. They smoked 
ham, and cured it with salt. 
When you got done with it there 
wasn't anything left but the little end of the nose. 
They had 
apple trees, pear trees, cherry trees, and flowers. 
Helen (Alva's daughter): recalls the old—fashioned 
carnations and roses, not yet perfected. 
They had lawns. 
People 
in Vincentown thought they were Pineys because they lived 
in the 
woods. 
But everybody was sociable. 
Alva: We had missionaries come up here -- Father Boswick who 
founded the Vincentown Episcopal 
is credited with coining the 
word "Piney" (according to Brad) -- went around getting 
money 
for the poor indigenous inhabitants. 
They used to send barrels 
of clothing out for them. 
We belonged to the Methodist church. 
Discussion of the difference between being poor and being 
self—sufficient.

The emergency squad. 
Gram bought the first ambulance they 
had 
in Vincentown. 
Someone said she came over without shoes on 
to pick it up 
in Mount Holly. 
But Burlington was after the 
ambulance. Gram was at the Budd's cranberry sorting house to 
visit. 
The squad didn't have the money to buy the ambulance but 
it needed the ambulance, so Gram 
went, 
in sandals, to talk to 
them. 
They wanted to sell 
it to her. 
She had to give them ten 
dollars more than Burlington would give. 
They had raffles to pay 
her back. 
Topsy Emmons and she went house to house soliciting 
money for it. 
The men were the members. 
She said to Topsy, 
"Let's crash the meeting and tell them we're going to be members 
too." 
They hesitated quite a bit and finally said okay. 
Gram 
was president for several years, and was an instructor. 
They had 
an annual banquet. They fit forty five people into her house for 
it. 
MH: Snapping turtle soup? foodways 
You have to catch them when they're crossing the road 
in the 
spring to 
lay their eggs. 
Get them to bite onto something and 
grab them by the tail, take them home, cut the head off, scald 
them. 
Bury the head. Brad says he keeps a pole in the back of 
his car to pick up snappers with to keep them from getting run 
over. 
Then you take the fat off and cook them the same way you 
would meat for vegetable soup. 
Gram puts in carrots and potatoes 
and a small amount of tomato, and herbs -- just the same as you 
would vegetable soup. 
Put in hard boiled eggs at the very end. 
Thyme, oregano -- I put in a little bit of everything. 
I have it 
all 
in a shaker. 
Brad tries to get his grandmother to give us a good old 
story -- about some characters around her. 
Gram: You want me to talk about that man that walked down 
the road with no head on? 
That's the reason I wouldn't never go up the Ridge Road was 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 52 
because they told me a man walked down there with no head on. 
It's 
a beautiful place now, but there was no houses or anything 
-- 
it was just the woods with a road through it. 
And my mother, 
she and the other mothers around didn't want their children to go 
up that road and stray away from home. 
So they used to tell 
us 
there was a man up there that walked around with no head on, and 
there used to be a lot of gypsies, and gypsies would camp up 
there, and we were afraid of the gypsy. 
So that kept us kids all 
home. 
belief, legend 
Then of course the Jersey Devil come up, and that was 
another scare for us, so we dasn't go away from home on account 
of the Jersey Devil. 
We lived right where the Budds had their 
cranberry bogs and reservoirs, and my mother and father was very 
very close friends with the Budds, so we always had the 
priviledge of going in bathing up 
in the reservoir, and skating 
in the wintertime, so we were allowed to go up there. So it got 
so many -- hundreds -- that the Budds began restricting it. 
We 
had skating parties and races and people would come from all 
over. A lot of Medford people. 
Maurice Anderson from Medford 
always picked me to be his partner. recreation 
Brad: Tell us about sleddin on Big Hill. 
Gram: It isn't much of 
it's left now since Leisuretown's in 
the re . 
Brad: they ate half of Big Hill. Right across from Budd's 
Bogs. There's 1500 people living there now. 
It was horse heaven 
wasn't it? 
Gram: We used to sled down this big hill, and 
it was full of 
woods, and we was lucky 
if we didn't hit a tree. 
One time my 
oldest son and another buddy was bicycling and they lay there for 
the longest time before they come to, where they straddled this 
tree. (laughing) 
Oh we had a lot of fun as kids. 
I went to 
school at Retreat School, and we had 30 boys and three girls. 
So 
I was a tomboy. 
Florence Wells was a coward. 
She wouldn't dare 
to say her soul was her own, and Georgiana she would run and 
hide. 
But if they wanted to fight, I was ready. 
If they wanted 
to play ball I was ready. 
Uncle Herbert was a hard man to work for. 
Right after Thompson's house is where the Pine Woods starts. 
Gram had a blueberry farm. 
The Budds had Jamaicans picking for 
them. Gram got to use them when Budd wasn't. 
There was one that 
used to come down and talk to Robert (her husband), and she got 
tired of 
it. 
farm workers 
Well, all 
of them were afraid of ghosts and things like 
that. So I started in on this -- he'd walk down and he'd go back. 
And this one night I began talking about this man with no head, 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 53 
and making up a lot of stories along with it, and I could see his 
eyes got bigger and bigger, and he said, Robert could you take me 
home? 
Brad: Weren't there people who thought there were ghosts in 
Retreat House? 
Gram: Yeah. 
They all 
left but me. 
When I moved there I 
stayed. But you did hear a lot of stuff, that was for sure. 
What 
it was, I don't know. 
But you could hear people talkin, and, 
like cars drove into the yard and things like that -- now I had a 
man -- I said I could tell you about Van Thompson -- he was 
staying there -- he was working for us. 
He used to go fishing to 
the shore with some people from South Jersey. 
And we heard the 
car come 
in and Dan heard it too. 
We come downstairs and there 
was nothing there. Nobody a tall. 
Dan even hollered out the 
bedroom window "I'll be down in a few minutes," and there wasn't 
anybody there. 
And of course Mary Parker they moved out on 
account of somebody botherin em. 
But they didn't scare me. 
I 
still stayed. 
There was something there. 
The people lived there 
before I was there had some money and 
it was buried somehow, and 
they had a beautiful fireplace, and somebody had dug that up 
thinking the money was under the bricks in the fireplace, and I 
had a dream one night and I dreamed it was out there under the 
corn crib, dreamed they took me and showed me where it was, but I 
didn't have the guts to go look, but I had a German lady and she 
said, "I certainly would do 
it." 
Brad as a little boy never liked the upstairs of that house. 
Gram: One time we were upstairs sleeping and 
it sounded like 
-- 1 had a china closet. 
And it sounded like that china closet 
had fell over and broke everything that was 
in 
it. 
We all 
come a 
runnin downstairs, kids and all, and there wasn't a thing moved. 
One time I heard talking -- when I first went there it was a 
filthy dirty place. 
And I had a friend from New York that moved 
up here. And she said to me "I'll help you clean up," this would 
be on a Sunday morning. and I was upstairs reading the Sunday 
papers, hadn't got up yet, and my husband he had to work that day 
so he went to work, and I thought no use me gettin up just yet, 
I'll 
lay here and read these Sunday papers. 
So while I was 
readin the Sunday Paper I heard this car stop -- sounded like a 
car stop -- and I said "Well that's Mrs. Ford." 
And someone 
hollers "Hello, are you up?" 
I said "I'll be right down." Says, 
"Well come on, hurry up" 
And I had an outhouse then, and I 
thought she went out there and I waited and waited and she wasn't 
there. 
After a while she came and she hadn't been there.

MH: Why weren't you scared? 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs

Gram: I'm a little braver than some of 
'em were. I always 
said I would like to meet a ghost or a haunt. 
I'd like to see 
whether it's true or not. 
I don't like some of this fabricated 
talk. 
Gram: Well 
it was not that old of a house --
Brad: It's a hall and parlor house, and we added a part in 
the back. It had a tightwinder. 
It could easily be 1810 or 
further back. 
MH: 
Is there any such thing as a haunted house in the 
suburbs or does it have to be a very old house? 
Gram: It was an old house. 
The father and mother lived 
there, and then the daughter and son—in—law, they were old. I 
don't know who lived there before the Thomases lived there. I 
remember when I was a little bit of a kid it was all farmland, 
and my brother and Joe Clevenger 
would ride bicycles and skinny 
dip and steal watermelons. 
MH: Was New Lisbon part of your world? 
Alva: That was called Mount Misery then. 
Her family lived up there -- they were LeMunyons. 
There 
used to be factories back 
in there I think I heard my mother say. 
Like glass factories. 
Helen: She used to tell the time by the train going through 
Chatsworth. 
She'd set the clock that way. 
Gram is getting hungry. 
Alva would go to dances in G—Chatsworth; 27GT -- they were 
held outside on a platform. 
The musicians came from New York. 
They'd get ice cream, and that was a big treat. 
And we had 
dances in peoples' homes in Burrs Mills. 
They had auctions, but 
we didn't go. 
Alva: When my sister got married they had feather beds, 
feathers saved from chickens. 
Brad: Where does the saying "I says, she says" come from? 
Alva: I'm about the only one has this, and 
Brad: We say "Tar, and far, and crick, and ruf, " 
Helen: My father was from West Virginia so my brother used 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 55 
to say that we were half piney and half--
Gram: Tarneck 
Helen: hillbilly. 
My father got here because of the 
cranberry bogs. 
There was a doctor from West Virginia, and my 
father's sister came to work for him. 
Gram: Well, Brad, your ten minutes is up. 
More on education. 
The Drexels in Vincentown talked a 
little different than they did, because they were better 
educated. 
People in Chatsworth like Katie Buzby were a higher 
class of people. The Lees were 
in the Thompson's class. 
In this 
generation they all went to college, but earlier generations just 
made it through elementary school. 
Women never travelled by themselves out in the woods. 
They 
could see the houses they were going to. 
They signalled each 
other across the fields that are now grown up -- lack of smoke 
meant something, and so did a white banner. 
Alva's grandfather 
had his own sawmill. 
Flory Beebe married Alva's brother when she was 18. 
Alva 
knew the old man who used to 
live 
in the Johnson place. Alva's 
mother was a Richendaler. Mitchell Thompson was Alva's brother. 
Alva married Robert Ware. 
Grandmom Thompson is Flora Bozarth 
Beebe (that's Gram). 
Helen is Helen Ware Zelly. 
John Wesley 
Thompson 
II 
is Brad's father. 
His mother is Shirley Wescott. 
They were fertile farmers from the Quaker country toward the 
river. 
MH: What's Quaker culture? 
Helen: They are very plain, even today, you can almost tell. 
Brad: The way they dress -- but it'll 
be good quality, and 
they'll have gone to good schools, and they talk distinctly, and 
you know the names -- Haines, Lippencotts, Zelly, 
They never heard of Jerry Munyhun. 
They used to go back 
in Lebanon Forest to look for glass 
remains. 
They gathered crow's foot -- little miniature pine 
trees -- (Princess Pine?) -- and sphagnum moss (pronounced 
spanjum) — they let 
it dry in a field and used wooden rakes to 
spread it, 
and pressed it 
into bales.

TXO1: 
Mid: They say you girls are really workin. 
Are there more 
than just girls there? 
(I'm trying to set up the recorder) 
We are at G—Four Mile Circle; 27GT. 
Mid thinks it may have 
been so—named because it was four miles from New Lisbon. 
But 
she's not sure. Mid was born in the White Horse Inn that Mary—Ann 
Thompson is working diligently to restore. Mid's dad moved there 
in 
1907. 
Before them the Taylors lived there. 
Mid's father was 
Alfred Stevenson, her mother was Martha Anderson, no relation to 
Herb. 
I don't know Herb but I've heard of him and of Josie. 
Russ and Herb were brothers. 
Herb died not too long ago, 
in the 
last ten years. 
Mid's husband died 8 years ago. 
Mrs. Anderson 
died and two weeks later Russ died. 
family, history 
Mid has a dog named Josh. 
The Taylors were not related to the Taylors in Browns Mills. 
Mid's grandfather -- William Anderson -- and Freeman Taylor's 
grandmother were brother and sister. 
Then my grandfather's 
sister 
-- Mariana -- married a Taylor. They called their father 
Topsy. 
I don't know what his first name was. They call 
all 
the 
boys Topsy Taylor. 
Freeman's one, and then Harry that was the 
father -- and they had a son Harry -- and he had a son Don. 
They 
lived 
in the Browns Mill/New Lisbon area. 
She knows Ann Davis --
they belong to Eastern Star together. 
It's a branch of the 
Masonic Order. 
Most all these little towns have a woman's 
chapter. 
It's based on religious -- the story's taken from the 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 57 
bible that it's a -- Catholics don't belong, they don't believe 
in organizations I don't think. 
Are you Catholic? voluntary 
associations 
MH: Yeah. 
MG: Well, you just don't belong to those type a 
organizations. 
It's more the Protestant organization. 
It's just 
a social thing. 
The masons and shriners -- they're all men's 
organizations. 
The grange is a farmer's -- there's one 
in 
Vincentown. 
Mary—Ann would know. 
I've never belonged to 
it. 
There's twenty—two districts in the state and each chapter has 
twenty two offices and there's four elective offices and the 
others are appointed. 
It's world—wide. 
At meetings -- there's 
stations : Ada, Ruth, Esther, Martha, and Electa -- ladies from 
the Bible. 
Ada was Jephtha's daughter. 
He promised the first 
thing that appeared that he would sacrifice and it was his 
daughter who appeared, and Electa was -- I sort of forget -- she 
means love. 
Oh well. 
But they have the grand chapter and the same offices as they 
have in the local chapters. It's usually in Atlantic City. 
Her full name is Amelia. 
She doesn't know how she came by 
the nickname Mid. 
There were four boys and two girls. Have I met 
any of the Estlow -- my brother lives right across from the 
store. John Stevenson who belongs to the Jones Mill Gun Club. 
He 
guides it. 
He's known these guys for a long time. 
His wife 
cooks for them. 
Mid has cooked for two different clubs. 
Her brother—in—law, 
an Estlow -- used to 
live next to John, and they had a club too 
-- an old cranberry house. 
The Woodbury Gun Club. 
They had 
about 40 members then. 
She was cooking for them when Marcy and 
Toby (really named Alfred) were born. 
She has three children. 
Marcy is Martha for her mother. 
We got up four in the morning to 
cook breakfast -- fried potatoes and bacon or scrapple, sausage 
and eggs. 
Only for one week 
in the year. 
When they first 
started they couldn't hunt on a Sunday. 
It always started on 
December 17 until they changed it to the first Monday in 
December. 
They'd pack lunches for them the night before. 
The 
Jones Mill club comes in for lunch every day. The Jones Mill club 
comes from Cranbury, NJ. 
Mid's club came from Woodbury, Pitman, 
Mullica Hill. foodways 
At their club on Sunday they bring their wives and my sister 
in 
law and another woman does all 
that cookin. The club 
is well 
furnished -- a huge fireplace. 
They have a man that lives right 
there now -- one of their members. 
He retired, and his wife 
died. 
His name is Wilson Ryan. 
The club I cook for didn't have 
curtains -- I cooked for the club my husband guided, and they 
built their club and that's the one when you first go 
into the 
town there's a little store they used to call 
it Johnny 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 58 
Broome'ses. 
After you go past Johnny's there's a road to your 
left and 
it comes up by this highway -- there's a house and you 
make a left and that road it was up there about six houses -- and 
all 
their members got older and they weren't interested 
in 
hunting. 
That was the Woodbury Gun Club. 
I'd take my vacation 
from work, a week of 
it, 
and cook for them. 
They have shower 
facilities now. But the club I cooked for for my brother—in—law 
they had outside toilets. 
When we were kids there was so many 
deer hunters around you wouldn't recognize Chatsworth. 
More then 
than now. 
The woods was woodsier then. 
I said, there couldn't 
be any people left in Gloucester and Camden County. 
Every night 
they'd come to the store and stand in 
line to call their wives. 
We used to have a dance maybe when we were younger. Some at the 
Chatsworth school. 
She's not related to Mary—Ann Thompson. I worked at the 
state school. 
For about ten years I worked in cottages as a 
cottage mother, and then I was 
in charge of the clothing center. 
Took out the clothes that the boys wore. 
Years ago they had the 
clothing in one area 
and we took the kids all over and they 
wanted the kids dressed nice. 
It was my job to see that we had 
all 
the different sizes. 
We had Mongoloids and they're short and 
squatty and their feet are wide. 
So we'd have to get extra long 
shoes. 
Side Two 
They took the whole town of Pointville, Fort Dix did. 
Jack 
Davis we've known him all 
our life. 
My dad used to have fox 
dogs. 
(She doesn't know what kind they had -- her brother and 
husband had them too -- fox dogs and coon dogs. Her husband coon 
hunted almost every night when he wasn't working -- shift work at 
Fort Dix. 
In the 40s he went to work there.) armed forces 
She's never cooked turtle. 
Her nephew Harold Stevenson 
cooks 
it. 
He works in the garage 
in the colony, and he traps 
snapping turtles. 
Mostly in the spring. 
They freeze the meat, 
and he makes snapper soup. 
He's a mason and he'll make it for 
something up there. 
I don't like the kind he makes. 
He makes 
the milk kind -- with milk and boiled eggs. 
I like McCalisters, 
you know the restaurant in Philadelphia. 
Mayo's has good snapper 
soup. 
That's not the milk kind. 
They have it at Vincentown 
Diner too. They all 
buy 
it canned. 
It might be McCalister's 
even. 
I don't like their clam chowder as well as what I make 
myself. 
You have to cook bacon, 
fry it out ti) 
it's golden brown 
and then put some onions 
in 
it and let the onions cook 
in with 
the bacon grease and then you add a little water to it to give 
color and then you dice potatoes and put tomatoes and rice 
in 
it. 
Sometimes if I have corn I'll put corn in 
it, noodles. 
And the 
clams of course. 
I just gave Mary—Ann the recipe. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 59 
(I turn the television off at this point) 
She said she made some and it turned out alright. 
Start out 
with either bacon or salt pork. 
That's what the people around 
here used to use a lot. Everybody had salt pork 
in their house. 
Her dad and husband raised hogs. 
They always had a vegetable 
garden. Marcy had one out 
back this year. 
Not hard to grow if 
you take care and fertilize it. 
They use a rototiller -- Toby 
uses that 
and prepares the garden for Marcy. 
Then fertilize and 
weed it. 
Crabgrass is the worst. Cutworms are a problem with 
tomatoes. 
They'll cut the plant right off. 
Marcy does the flowers. 
Zinnias and marigolds around the 
edge of the garden. 
Then a lot of martins come early 
in the 
spring -- her husband made the martin house out there. He died 8 
years ago of cancer. 
They have impatiens and geraniums. 
They 
buy the plants. 
They have chrysanthemums along the edge of the 
fence. 
She fixed a little flower bed around the bird bath. 
They 
get birds in the bird bath. 
All kinds -- not as many in the 
summer as 
in the winter. 
Sparrows and woodpeckers, the yellow 
grossbeaks, and titmouse, chickadees -- only one or two 
whippoorwills in this area. 
You don't see 'em much and they only 
come 
in the summer. Mockingbirds, 
lots of them and a few 
cardinals. 
They live across the street. A couple pair. 
They 
must nest in there. 
When I put feed out they'll come over and 
eat. 
A mix, and some sunflower seed. 
Thistle seed. (animal) (plant) 
Blue jays, we have gobs of them and they eat everything --
they take it away from the little birds. 
We have wrens. 
What's 
the little bird with the little yellow head. They're so pretty. 
Goldfinches. 
We have moles -- you can buy pellets to put out. 
Cats'II catch 'em. 
She doesn't really know all her neighbors. 
Several of them work for the colony. 
At "the New Lisbon," the 
state school. 
Mid lived 
in the hotel until she was married. 
Still 
lived 
in Chatsworth til 
they bought this house twenty years ago. 
We 
were always riding in the woods. We used to 
like to ride around 
Bullock's Farm -- Pasadena, Woodmansie, -- the kids from up that 
way came to school 
in Chatsworth. 
Now they have those food 
strips across from Pasadena and you can ride for hours to see the 
deer. 
I haven't been since my husband died. 
He'd like to go 
down by Carranza and look for wild turkeys through those little 
woods roads. 
He knew the roads and we'd ride around for hours. 
And over in the forest they're all good roads. 
They built those 
roads during the CCCs. There was a camp by Oswego Lake. 
The Saturday before deer season there was always a roast 
beef dinner. 
The fire company has had 
it for 15 —18 years now. 
I'd make a cake for it. 
I make a pecan cake every year. 
They'll have 20 — 25 cakes and they'll all 
be different. 
some make zucchini cake, coffee cake with the cinnamon twirl 
in 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 60 
it, Natalie Kennedy makes a poor man's cake -- that's a cake from 
way back in the depression times. 
You take a box of raisins and 
you put egg and sugar and cinnamon, nutmeg and thicken it with 
flour and put bakin' soda in 
it instead of powder and it's 
something like applesauce cake. 
You don't use bakin powder in 
cakes where you put sour milk or cream in 
it. 
Usually you put 
bakin soda instead. 
She didn't make yeast out of hops. 
Her mother used to make 
it using potato water. 
But everybody baked their own bread. 
people were lucky around this area if they made $10 a week in the 
depression. 
It was always tough after cranberry season because 
people didn't have much to do until blueberry time. They'd prune 
the bushes. 
You should prune at least a third of your bush away 
every third way. 
If you don't know what to cut off you could cut 
your crop off. 
Your berry bud 
is there in the winter time when 
you're pruning, so you'd leave your berry buds and cut off your 
old shoots. 
You usually had a partner and they would show you 
what to do. 
Different kinds of wild huckleberries. The sugar berry, the 
bill berry, the swamp berry -- that's like the one they 
cultivate. 
I'd know 'em 
if I seen 'em. 
But they developed all 
these new ones by crossin' one plant with another. 
We must have 
15 different varieties. 
The Weymouth, June berries, early blues, 
stanleys, 16/13 A's, Rancocas, rubles -- you get to know 'em by 
the taste. Her favorite is the Jersey berry. 
She makes pies with 
them and cans them.

Blueberry cakes, blueberry cobbler, blueberry roly—polies --
you make like a biscuit dough and you roll 
it out and you put 
your blueberries over top of 
it and sugar it and cinnamon it an 
all 
of that and you roll 
it up and cut it in slices and while 
you're doin this you put sugar and water in a pan on the stove 
and bring it to a boil. 
And then you put these pinwheels in the 
sugar and water and then bake 'em -- the sugar and water makes 
like a syrup and then eat it with milk or cream on top. foodways 
Cranberries: cranberry pie, cranberry jelly, sauce -- cook 
the berries and leave the skins in 
it. 
I like it better with the 
skins. 
More flavor to 
it. 
That's what she has on turkey instead 
of gravy. 
I make a cranberry and apple relish -- and I put four 
cups of cranberries and two oranges and two apples with it and 
some ground pecans in 
it and a lemon and then your sugar. 
It'll 
keep 
in the refrigerator for quite a while. 
Her girlfriend makes the jello salad, using cherry jello and 
cranberries, pineapple, nuts and celery. 
My sister—in—law puts cinnamon in

on 
it. 
For Thanksgiving (celebration) next week -- I got a pot 
about that big -- (Marcy brings some out from last year) 
The 
relish gets eaten up right away. 
I'll make a potful of the 
jelly kind -- cook it, strain it and take the skins out. 
I'll 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 62 
make a dish for my sister—in—law and for my girlfriend for her 
Thanksgiving dinner. 
If you ever cook it you want to use twice 
as much cranberries, a pint of sugar and a pint of water. 
It you 
want to make the jelly kind you put it all together an 
let 
it come 
to a rolling boil for 20 minutes and then take it off the stove. I 
have a little dipper with a blade -- and I put it through that --
it has holes in the bottom and all 
the juice goes through and 
after it cools it's all jelled. 
To cook it with the skins on I put the sugar and water on to 
cook, and I sort the cranberries and have them ready to put in 
after it's boiled for ten to 12 minutes and then let it boil for 
another 10 to 12 minutes --
She's curious about our eating arrangements, and about the 
project. 
She has an 
issue of Folklife Center News that someone sent 
her from Bloomington Indiana -- via her brother who works at 
McGuire AFB. 
From Folklore Forum, the editor. 
(I 
am amazed) 
Marcy asks me some questions. 
Mid's grandmother Amelia Stevenson operated the store at 
Whitesbog years ago. 
Her father and grandfather also worked for 
Wh i 
to s 
. 
Chatsworth was the center of Woodland Township. 
Speedwell 
was always the Lee family -- her husband was born at Speedwell. 
There was a sawmill there. 
A lot of them around Chatsworth. 
The 
Taylors had sawmills years ago -- either Upper Mill or Lower 
Mill. 
There were nothin but sand roads and my grandmother 
Anderson lived 
in New Lisbon and of course you always had to go 
visit your grandmother on Sundays. 
She'd always give me a cup of 
coffee. 
My mother had 
it but she wouldn't let us have it. But 
when you went to your grandmother's it was somethin different. 
She'd fix 
it nice and sweet with that silver brand condensed 
milk. 
Marcy: You wouldn't let me have coffee and I remember goin 
to my grandmother's and havin coffee. 
MH: so the mother that wouldn't let you have coffee would 
give it to her. Was that true of everybody? 
Mid: I think so, yeah. Grandmothers -- when they come down 
here their mother lets them have Captain Crunch, though she won't 
let them have it at home because it's bad for their teeth --
because it's a special treat to come here. 
My grandmother always 
made home made bread and I wouldn't eat peanut butter at home but 
at her place I loved it. 
family 
Marcy went to Central Missouri College. 
She teaches 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 63 
kindergarten. 
They're so cute -- every day they come in they're 
so excited about school. 
Everything is so new. First grade 
they're easily motivated. 
Mid: I think most of the people living in the pines now are 
educated in food and are eating everything. 
Years ago everybody 
had chickens -- when I was younger -- you had to make a meal out 
of corned beef. 
Pan stew == fry salt pork and slice onions and 
potatoes into 
it. 
Salt and pepper to taste. 
Use a cast iron 
skillet. 
Let it cook till 
it was golden brown. 
We're getting cake and milk here. I'm in the other room 
looking at some crafts. 
There's a duck made all 
out of pine 
cones -- made by a friend named Hitchner who lives 
in Alloway New 
Jersey. 
It takes four different kind of pine cones to make. 
She 
gave Mary—Ann the cake recipe too. 
They had a cook book for the 
PTA one year. 
This is called Texas Fudge Cake. 
It has pecans 
in 
it. 
Never had lunch meats when they were little. 
They got 
boiled ham from Bob the Butcher of Lakewood. He came every 
Wednesday in the thirties. 
Another guy came every week selling 
green groceries, and a fish lady came through every Friday 
morning. 
Side two 
My dad always had 50 — 100 clams on the cellar floor and 
they'd keep two weeks laying on the floor. Clam pie, clam 
fritters, clams fricasee. 
Clam pie: Start it the same as 
you do 
clam chowder -- fry your bacon and put onion in 
it, dice 
potatoes, and accordin to how big a pie -- I make three or four 
at once and I use fifty clams, a couple dozen eggs, and a double 
crust (on the top and bottom). 
Food events: 
in the winter time there might be wild duck, 
and deer, and geese -- you gotta have a different 
kind of dog 
for every quarry. 
My husband had one, he'd go duck huntin and 
the dog would bring all 
the ducks back to him. 
The cake 
in question requires a half a pound of margarine, 
four tablespoons of cocoa and a cup of water and two cups of 
flour, two cups of sugar, two eggs, half a cup of sour milk, a 
half teaspoon of baking soda and another half of baking powder, 
and a teaspoon of vanilla, and when the mixture on the stove 
comes to a boil you mix the flour and sugar and eggs and the sour 
cream -- you mix that with the beater and then you pour this 
chocolate stuff over it 
-- and you can put it in a cookie sheet. 
And when you take it out of the oven you've made an icing -- a 
box of 4x sugar and a bowl and you heat another quarter pound of 
margarine and four or five tbsp of cocoa and 6 tbsp of milk and 
melt it and pour it over your box of 4x sugar, beat it, 
add the 
cup of nuts, and as soon as you take the cake out of the oven you 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 64 
pour that over it and it's all 
done. 
In a half an hour. 
Early spring food events? 
When I was a kid they'd have harvest homes, 
in August --
after the garden season, 
but then over around Tabernacle, Indian 
Mills, Warren Grove and Sim Place, all 
these different places 
would have their harvest home. 
Chicken dinner -- stewed chicken 
and mashed potatoes and corn and beans. 
That's how the churches 
would get the money to pay the ministers. 
They'd all happen 
in 
different weeks. 
Egg Harbor and Mount Holly had big fairs. 
Browns Mills was nothin when we were kids. 
They had the one 
store, Earlin store -- John Earlin's parents. His son has a green 
vegetable stand on the other side of Deborah. He has flowers in 
the spring. 
Pemberton was a big shoppin place. 
Platt store -- a 
dry goods store, Bollingers had a big store, and Mortons had a 
butcher shop up the street and now there's nothin. 
I go to 
Medford anymore. 
They got a nice Acme. farm market 
Spring. Maypinks -- almost like a vine -- it's trailing 
arbutus. 
(cf. Merce Ridgway's song) 
Whippoorwills (lady 
slippers) 
Now you're not supposed to pick them anymore cause 
they're almost extinct. 
We used to always go 
lookin for 
Whippoorwills. We had a pick—up and I'd drive the truck slow and 
the kids would look out and say, "Mom, I see one!" 
and we'd pick 
'em. 
And magnolias and turkey beard -- my dad always brought my 
mom a bouquet of them. 
We'd make little playhouses. 
Even in school we'd pile 
leaves together or pine needles and make a little house. 
My dad always had a big garden and my mom canned hundreds of 
jars. 
She had places in the basement and a closet upstairs. 
I 
freeze my stuff. 
The Pinelands National Reserve doesn't make a big difference 
to her. 
The Pinelands Commission is housed in JJ White's old 
house. 
Dr. Darlington married one of the White girls and Tom 
Darlington's mother married his brother. 
They lived 
in 
Philadelphia. 
The other daughter married a Chambers. 
Lizzie was 
never married. 
(more of the story) 
You knew everybody around 
-- we went to Pemberton High School and we knew all the kids, but 
now the population's gotten so big -- I don't know anybody lives 
in Chatsworth anymore. 
More talk about newcomers vs. old timers. 
They want to 
charge the cranberry growers so much for every pint of 
blueberries that goes out of here. Marvin Matlack got beat, thank 
goodness -- he's the one that wants to put the tax on the 
blueberries and cranberries and they provide so much work for 
local people. 
That's when we Pineys clan together. They come in 
and they want to take over. 
What did they come for if they don't 
like 
it down here. We had a good tax rate and a good school

They aren't developers -- they're all 
individuals 
building on land they bought. 
They know there's no garbage pick— 
up and no sewage -- and they complain that they aren't gettin 
anything for their taxes -- they're gettin' 
lotsa good fresh air, 
what else do they want? land management 
I'm not artistic -- I haven't got any artistic ability. 
I 
can cook, but not anything fancy. 
I like pretty dishes though. 
The name of her Franciscan dishware pattern is Desert Rose. 
A 
man up at the church showed us how to peel and apple in a fancy 
way.

TXO1: (continued from PFP83—AMHO12) G—Four Mile Circle; 27GT The 
fellow that took care of the machinery in the cranberry house --
he 
loved the cranberry sauce with the skins, but he would fix his 
plate -- have his meat and potatoes and vegetable and cole slaw 
and then he'd take cranberry and put all over the top of it. 
And 
I would think, "How could he do that?" 
If I had the cranberry 
I'd want the cranberry separate, but he would cover everything 
with cranberry. I hate it that way. foodways 
MH: But in cakes and stews you mix everything together. 
MG: Yeah, but that's different -- it makes it cake or stew. 
But if I have somethin else with it I don't want it mixed in with 
the stew. 
If I had cole slaw I wouldn't want it mixed in with 
the stew. 
Re: seasonings. 
She's not big on garlic. Oregano is okay 
for Italian food. 
She doesn't pick any mushrooms. Italian people 
pick them in the fall. 
The mushrooms will grow a lot on burnt 
ground -- and sometimes near the swampy areas. 
The Italian 
people who came here years ago to pick cranberries and stayed, 
they go off 
in the woods and pick mushrooms. 
The oriental people 
come around in the spring and pick the green brackens before they 
turn into a fern. 
People around Chatsworth used to go get 'em. 
They cook 'em like they would asparagus, with vinegar. 
She's never been in the Oriental store in Browns Mills. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 67 
She's got some Japanese seamstress friends at New Lisbon (state 
school) -- and they go get the brackens. 
Mid never gathered that much 
in the woods. 
They had 
everything they needed in the garden. 
Marcy rides her bike 
in the forest, and she said, Mom, I 
just seen the most whippoorwills -- so we went to look at them. 
And you go back 
in a year and they're not there. 
There's people in these woods all 
the time. 
Hikin, canoin 
-- 
in Jenkins. 
I don't know how the creek holds all 
the canoes. 
people hikin in the woods -- I guess they know more about the 
pines than we do actually. 
A lot of 'em have studied it. 
We 
just take it as 
it 
is. 
recreation 
I never liked my food all mixed up. 
They used to tease me 
about it when I was growing up. 
MH Are you meticulous about following a recipe? 
Mid: No, I ad 
lib all the time. 
I follow the proportions, 
but my measuring cup 
is about that much more than a cup. So I 
always add to the top, and add extra of everything else. 
But 
when I give out my recipe, people always say "My cake didn't turn 
out like yours did." 
And I always beat my cake. 
When you're 
creamin your sugar and your shortening -- you want to dissolve the 
granules. 
When you put your egg 
in you put it in one at a time 
and beat it and beat it and beat it. 
MH So there's a lot of room for variation.

2MIK: 
TX01: 
Me apologizing for not having a microphone. Leo: Anything 
that comes out comes out. 
G—Nesco; 26GT 
Leo 
is making bread. 
He makes it once a week. 
Leo Landy 
the third is there. 
Leo Landy the second 
has an unlisted 
number. 
Melissa Ramp is there. 
Ted is her great uncle, and 
Helen Zimmer is her great aunt. 
She just took some craftwork out 
of the oven. 
Twenty or thirty years ago Leo started making 
bread. 
Someone gave Hazel a recipe and Leo increased a recipe 
from the farm journal from two loaves to six. 
He throws juice 
from home preserved peaches into 
it. 
Hazel put up 75 jars last 
year. 
He improvises a lot. 
One quarter rye and unbleached 
flour. 
Don't use bleached because that's left over from feeding 
the pigs. 
foodways 
You need six hours to bake bread. 
It takes its own damn 
time. 
One batch we had to throw out because the yeast never came 
up. 
I gotta ask somebody that knows one of these days. 
Maybe I 
used too hot of water on that yeast. 
Should've baked it for the 
dogs and cats. 
Leo calls Hazel "Mabel". Hazel: Leo upset the ham 
all 
over the oven the other night, and oh, the smoke in here from 
the pineapple juice! 
The oven is self—cleaning. 
One can hear Bryan snapping 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 69 
pictures. 
Leo 
is putting the bread in for a second rising. 
It's 
got to rise again. 
With their oven it's 325 degrees. 
Leo uses his hands. 
The mixer only goes so far. 
Hazel 
can't knead as much as Leo can. 
If you're going to make raisin 
bread, grab a batch of raisins and throw 'em in. 
Same thing with 
nuts for nut bread. 
An old German in Egg Harbor told him how to 
make German potato bread years ago. 
Then I was up 
in Hammonton 
and the Italians -- they use provolone and pepperoni and roll 
it 
out with the dough. 
Same way with making cinnamon buns --
Hazel says they learned to do that one day when they were 
snowed in during a snowstorm. 
"I wouldn't part with that recipe 
for anything." 
They know the Putiris -- Emma's Farm Market --
his wife Josephine died a year ago. 
We used to buy lily of the 
valley from this German woman -- Bevington. 
Hazel had too much 
trouble kneading it, and Leo insisted on taking over and he's 
done 
it ever since. 
He says 
if a mouse kept a strict diet of 
that bread it would kill him. 
Hazel tells him to shut up and set 
the table. 
Re: Grave Blankets 
Hazel: My grandfather died in January of 1335, and that 
December my aunt and I we took 
big piece of chicken wire and we 
put it on the grave like a square and we stuck greens of holly 
in 
there. 
Well we had a friend that was a florist and I got 
friendly with her, and she made grave blankets and it's awfully 
hard work with your hands -- We put it on every Sunday before 
Christmas. 
There's a problem with theft -- she puts plastic tulips on 
at Easter and takes them home at Memorial Day and puts geraniums 
in. 
But one year the plastic tulips were stolen. 
The next year 
Leo spray painted some flowers and they were even prettier than 
the ones she'd been using. 
Leo takes a two by four -- gets sphagnum moss out of the 
woods. 
Wraps the wire around it, 
and inserts evergreens every 
where -- and we did one for my father and Leo's parents and 
grandparents -- and then Leo was making wreaths for people. 
So 
now we're going to have to make one for the dogs' graves. 
I 
think we charged 
her (?) fifteen dollars, I'm not sure (some of 
this 
is 
lost in the shuffle). 
Leo calls her Mabel again. 
People think that's my name, she 
says. 
What do you call him? 
Leo: YOU CAN'T PRINT IT AND DON'T 
TRY TO TAKE IT DOWN ON THE TAPE RECORDER! 
Now, 
let's eat. 
We sit down to eat. 
We're eating green tomato pickles. 
Melissa makes friendship pins using different colored beads 
and wearing them on her sneakers on a safety pin. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 70 
Leo 
is eating with his hat on. 
Hazel: His brother never 
took his hat off until he got in bed. 
Griggsby points out that 
Jewish men never remove their yarmulkes, believing that a bare 
head 
is 
impolite in the presence of God. 
Hazel 
re: silver king -- a member of the artemisia family. 
They have some growing in the back yard. 
(plant) 
Discussion re: the saint's day festivals in Hammonton. 
The 
Egg Harbor Fair was a big deal when Hazel was growing up. 
She 
won a prize for a quilted pillow there. (celebration) 
Leo Landy III, 
re: four—wheeling: 
I love it. 
(MH: Where do you go?) Around the lake at Batsto 
-- there's all kind a pits all around this area, back behind the 
skatin rink at Hammonton. 
Huge hills there, they're nice. 
recreation 
He's never been to Hidden Lakes. 
A couple of times he got 
lost and ended up by Atsion Lake. 
It's neat, as 
long as you have 
a come—along. 
Leo: I'd ban them from the woods. 
They gotta ban them from 
the desert. 
They'll ruin the desert. 
I collect weeds back here 
in one spot 
back of Weekstown, and didn't some son—of—a—bitch 
come 
in there with a four—wheel—drive and "Oh, I can go through 
that," They don't give a damn whose property it 
is -- and 
it was 
cranberry bogs. 
Leo III: I never go 
in cranberry bogs 
real easy there --
you can get stuck 
Leo: I'd love to've seen that guy get out in the center and 
dig a sink hole 
Leo III: That's right! 
Leo: Disappear! 
Leo III: 
I had my anti's buried under the water and I'm 
surprised I made it outa the hole. 
Leo: They ruin things right and left. 
Hazel: I thought we weren't goin to come out (referring to 
different thread of conversation) 
He (Leo) said "I know where 
I'm goin"--and we went through every puddle 
I told you about the fellow that lost his car at the Mount 
Carmel celebration -- he went to the beer joint across the road 
and the procession comes up the little street along the railroad 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 71 
like this and comes down Main Street and then back again around 
the church, and they must walk a mile in all that heat, and 
if 
you had anybody that was -- oh, say you had someone very sick and 
you prayed "Oh Virgin Mother, or Saint So—and—So and So—and—So, 
who 
is your favorite saint at that time and maybe you make a 
promise that you're going to walk in that procession, and maybe 
if you're crippled and you felt that helped you to get better, 
why they walk in that procession until they're old -- they walk 
in their stockin feet these old Italian women and they have a 
candle that looks like a pole, you know, and it's hot, and the 
wax 
is drippin down -- He (Leo) doesn't believe in 
it -- he said 
he's goin up there and get Saint Patrick on the 17th of March and 
go around to Saint Patrick --
But he would get drunk up 
in town on the 16th of July, at 
this beer joint. 
Well he'd have to cross the railroad and come 
right through town, and I used to wonder how the hell that he got 
home, because he'd come home just about between 5 and 6 when that 
procession would just be getting along there, so somebody musta 
been watchin over him and got him around the side tree or got him 
through Hammonton, because I don't know how he ever got through 
i 
t. 
Leo: I had Saint Christopher with me. 
He used to get in the 
side pocket -- he couldn't look out that windshield to save his 
neck. 
They found out in the end he had nothin to do with 
travellin. 
Notice how he got off the market? 
Hazel: Then he come home one time, and who did he say was 
in 
the side pocket with him? Mary Magdalen was 
in the side pocket of 
his car. religion, belief 
MH: Medals? 
Hazel: Oh yeah -- they sold scapulars and all kinds of 
medals and tweetie birds on a stick and balloons and anything 
that goes with a carnival. 
It goes on all week 
and the street 
is just closed off because you just walk up the center of the 
street 
Leo: When the Lord wants you he knows where he puts you and 
he goes and gets you (something like that) 
That's my belief in 
the whole damn thing. 
Just like Ernie done. He's been through 
everything. 
He told me about how he went through the second 
World War and he rushed out into the battlefield and saved the 
chaplain -- anything to get a medal. He also told me of shootin a 
nigger too. 
MH: Ernie Richardson? 
Leo: John's brother. 
Hazel: John always has a story, a joke, he comes out with it 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 72 
so fast, you really think he's tellin you a true story sometimes. 
I saw the truck, and Melissa said "Gramma somebody's here" and I 
came up and he came right here to the yard, and he said, "I just 
come down to Abbott's for some slabs, and I want to tell you that 
Ernie committed suicide last night." I said, "Oh, John, I'm so 
sorry, 
is there anything we can do?" and he said, "No they're 
having an autopsy today," 
and I said, "I'll call you tonight and 
see what arrangements have been," and he said, "You tell Leo." 
MH: What did you mean by saying he was a really good 
woodsman? 
You said that Ernie was a really good woodsman. 
Hazel: He was. 
They knew their woods, the things that was 
in them. He was a trapper 
Leo: That's all 
he did? 
MH: 
What did he trap? 
Hazel: John goes. 
He's 83. 
One night we called and his 
wife didn't know where he was. 
She has nothing to do with it. 
She couldn't tell you anything he sells even. 
And she said John 
wasn't there. 
He had been out getting raccoon -- at 83. 
Gone out 
late at night to get raccoon. 
Leo: He had a coonhound chained out back there he paid 
fifteen hundred dollars for. 
I wouldn't pay that much for a 
woman! 
Hazel: He had three puppies he'd raised. 
Side two 
Leo: I love to hear 'em when they've started bayin'. 
Hazel: He had mother raccoon with three babies, and somebody come 
and stole it one night. 
Leo: Nothin like it on a moonlight night. 
Hazel: Course he has all kinds a people comin there all 
the 
time, selling grapevines and so forth. 
Leo: He's an animal person. 
You can go up there and see 
peacocks and chickens with Chinese heads (?) 
Hazel: It would make a noise (the albino peacock) and the 
little boy used to say what it would be saying. 
Leo: 
At 83. 
I'd buy this and that, and I'd sit down and 
figure it out, 
it come to $275.00 and he says, "You forgot 
somethin -- the cattails." He had 
it all figured up 
in his head, 
like a calculator. 
At 83. 
He owns two or three diners and the 
Mount Holly fairgrounds. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 73 
Hazel: He doesn't have a catalog, he doesn't have a price 
list. He has a wad of money that thick in his pocket it's a 
wonder somebody doesn't come along and knock him off. 
MH: Do you sell 
to him or buy from him? 
Hazel: Buy from him. 
He and his brother Ernie came down 
here about 20 years ago -- at that time he sold cattails, and he 
had 
'em thrown up on the roof at the fairground. 
It rained on 
'em, 
so what? He sold 'em! 
We sell quality and he sells 
quantity. 
That's really true. 
They came down here and looked at 
our stuff, and they started collecting reed plumes. 
Leo: He learned a lot off me and I learned a lot off him. 
He's a good source of supply. 
He's got every Piney lined up from 
the New York State line all 
the way down to Green Bank. 
Hazel: You just gotta look over what you're buying. 
MH: Do you have an 
idea of how many people are actually out 
there gathering? 
Leo: Hundreds of 'em. 
MH: How many full time? 
Leo shakes his head. 
Leo: He told me the last time I was up there he's got a 
carpenter now, and the guy was a carpenter before he was a 
grapevine puller, and he and his wife like 
it so much that, the 
hell with the carpentry. He's a full—time grapevine puller, and 
makes money at it. Loves the woods. 
There's a lot of people 
working in the United States that don't like what they're doin. 
Hazel: 
He has a place twice the size of this house, covered 
with grapevines and birch, piles and piles. 
Leo: And 
if you stay there in the evening when the Pineys 
start comin in 
you'll see the damndest ones you ever seen 
in 
your life. 
And they're like me, they're interesting to look at. 
People could make a buck 
if they'd get off their butt. 
Hazel: I tell him sometimes he'd fit right in with them. 
Leo: I've had arguments in beer joints. 
They swore I was 
Ernie Richardson. And if you seen me and Ernie together, we could 
pass off as brothers. 
And he walked around my shop one day, come 
in unexpected, never said beans, and I swung around and seen him, 
and I thought "What the hell's Tom doin' here?" -- my brother 
that had died about three or four years ago. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 74 
Hazel: For a minute it just didn't hit him. 
Leo: He must've been a hell 
of a soldier -- he told me once 
and this is sposed to be true, the Captain put me up 
in the point 
and told me "don't leave anybody past there" -- and he says "This 
nigger drove up 
in the truck, "I'm goin through" 
Ernie says, 
"orders are, nobody passes here," 
and he started cussin him out, 
"You white—livered this and that -- I'm goin' through." They was 
in battle. 
Leo: I won't be makin grave blankets until up around the 
tenth of December. 
Hazel: Once the moss freezes you can't get a thing back 
in 
them. 
Leo: See you make a moss block -- pile your moss up on a 
block of two by four about that thick, then you wire that one 
there, and that's wet. And it won't blow off the grave, 
like 
styrafoam. 
We have a florist friend in town, I learned a lot 
f 
rom. 
Hazel: He uses every little piece -- nothing goes on his 
floor in his flower shop. 
Leo: He asked me where the broom was, I said, I don't know. 
Hazel: Leo throws everything on the floor -- 
and he showed 
Leo how to make a tombstone grave blanket 
(that's one big spray 
with a forty—five degree angle in the center \__ ) Like say 
you'd have a big family plot with one stone and you couldn't 
afford to buy each one a grave blanket you'd just put one big 
spray up by the tombstone. 
A big red bow in the middle with red 
and white poinsettas, and maybe a couple pine cones on the end --
That was a custom we had, talking about princess pine, 
lycopodium, nobody knows what I mean, 
if you saw it on the grave 
yard, what this little piece was stuck in this one grave blanket, 
but my father always had a little bouquet at Christmas time, 
so 
I always take half a dozen pieces and wire them, stick 'em to my 
father's grave blanket. 
Crow's foot is running pine. 
My father always called it 
that. 
Leo: 
like a little Christmas tree. 
Story about how she saw a variegated princess pine at her 
flower arrangement class. 
Apparently a lady from Atco collects 
it. Discussion over whether they'd ever seen it before that. 
Leo 
mentions finding a huge variety of bayberry. 
Hazel: 
Now we have immortal, what we call 
immortal, pearly 
everlasting, our Old Field Balsam. Old Field Balsam I guess 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 75 
people living in Nesco the older timers, I guess that's what they 
named it because it grew near -- there's a creek back here and 
they called it the Old Field Creek -- and so maybe this old field 
balsam that's the only connection I get. 
(plant) 
Leo: I have stuff out here that I'll call one name and 
Richardson will call 
it another name. 
Hazel: We have brown burrs and he calls 'em rabbit's foot. 
And we have dusty gray and he calls it elks' horns. 
And it does 
look like little horns. 
Leo: Out in the mountains of Pennsylvania, the species (of 
immortal) that grows there grows up by Toms River. 
The birds 
transplant them. 
Birds also transplanted crabapples. 
Along the railroad 
between Absecon and Atlantic City. 
Discussion of the railroad that's supposed to go to Atlantic 
City. 
Leo says they better not go more than thirty miles an hour 
through the meadows. 
He pulls spikes up all the time, they come 
out that easy. 
That would be their biggest gamble, he says, 
running the railroad through the meadows. 
He worked on tracks down in Texas. 
We prepare to 
leave. 
Melissa asks Hazel to buy a plastic 
raincoat for her dog. 
On the birdfeeder: a purple finch four years ago; cowbirds, 
one time they had a white one; cardinals, always in pairs; 
blackbirds; sparrows, lots of different kinds -- one kind Leo 
used to call Johnny Bulls --; a brown thrush -- he used to come 
and eat the pokeberries out there; (doesn't recognize Towhees, 
chewinks, or twinks); 
nuthatches; chickadees; little wrens; a 
downy woodpecker; mockin bird; the redwing blackbirds -- you run 
into colonies of 'em out cattailin -- we just cut around and 
leave 'em -- they use 'em, and the tides and all 
take 'em; 
and 
you have the meadow wrens, give you a hard time all day long 
if 
you're near its nest. 
Hazel: The killdeer, I haven't seen one for years. 
We used 
to have a strawberry patch in back of our house and on your row 
you wouldn't hardly see 
it and here would be the nest down on the 
ground 
Leo: made out of brick 
Hazel: And before you'd see 
it she would be all 
the way over 
here walkin around like she had a broken wing and everything to 
get you to come over to see her and get you away from her nest.

Hazel: Yeah, 
like little stones 
Leo: all pebbles 
Hazel: oh, a perfect little nest. 
Leo: Don't ever try to catch a baby killdeer, they're fast. 
Throw a coat over it and it's gone the other way. 
Like trying to 
catch a young helldiver duck -- he goes down and he'll hold on to 
a root or somethin -- and you're waitin for 'im to come out. 
Then he decides, "I'll swim down there about twenty yards and 
I'll pop up again." 
We used to go after 'em when we were in CC 
camp. 
They're crazy. 
Leo was 
in CC camp in Green Bank and Port Republic. 
His 
brother helped to plant Bass River in White Pine. 
They had 'em 
in Lebanon, Woodbine, May's Landing. 
We say good—bye.

TX01: 000 G—Whitesbog; 21GT Mark Darlington commenting on his 
system for keeping warm in the office, a small electric heater 
under his desk. Bad static intermittently. 
Scuba diving 
mentioned, with reference to keeping warm. 
MH introducing Mark 
to the project and the reason for the interview. 
The bogs we can see outside the window are 
in the larger 
area called G—Buffin's Meadows; 21GT. 
Some family history follows. 
How Darlingtons got into the JJ White enterprise. 
JJ White got 
the property from his father—in—law. 
JJ white is Mark's great— 
grandfather. 
Fenwick was before JJ White, who added a lot to the 
property. 
JJ had about four daughters, and two Darlington 
brothers married two White sisters. 
Dad's (Tom Darlington) mom 
was Beulah. 
Another was Mary, and there was Anne and Elizabeth. 
Mark doesn't know where anybody's buried. 
Dad's family 
is from 
Philadelphia. 
Dad's uncle was at Whitesbog for a while too. 
One 
was a dentist, another an entomologist, who was supposed to run 
the property, but didn't. 
Mark's getting some of this from Bill 
Bolger's history of Whitesbog, recently produced for the 
Pinelands Commission. 
They didn't have to do a lot to the 
cranberries, just put a fence around them. 
Hassle with the local 
ensued over this. 
One bog dates back to the 1850's, part of 
Fenwicks operation. 
The payroad goes into the center, G—Old Bog; 
21GT, which doesn't even look like a bog anymore, 
is the one on 
the right as you go 
into the center, another one, next to that, 
that's G—Little Meadow; 21GT a little tiny one, that's the only one 
still worked from the 1850s, and it's probably been replanted in 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 78 
a different variety. 
the other ones date back to JJ White. 
MH Do old bogs require different treatment? Look any 
different? 
Mark: Older varieties aren't as nice now, what we're 
interested in now is weight, which doesn't necessarily mean 
bigger cranberries, since they're basically all 
air. 
What you 
want is a lot of little tiny cranberries, the other main thing 
you want is early ripening. 
Ocean Spray doesn't use any 
artificial coloring, so they pay a premium on the coloring. 
so 
you wait until the last possible minute to harvest them. 
Older varieties: 
Little Meadow has Howe s, and McFarland's, 
some Early Blacks, and Pioneers are also early varieties, but not 
in Little Meadows. 
Champions and Centennials other varieties, 
and 
it's good to have a mixture. agriculture 
Tom Darlington was a trained engineer, and his brother used 
to run the industry, but he died 
in a plane crash just before 
Mark's parents got married. 
(Mark doesn't know when that was 
exactly, admitting that family history isn't his strong point.) 
"So 
it sort of fell upon my father to either run the place or at 
least do something, so he 
left a job at Westinghouse and they 
moved out here, and that's when he took it over." 
He was 
designing parts for Jet turbines. 
He grew up 
in Landsdowne just 
outside of Philadelphia. 
So 
it just sort of fell upon him. 
It 
wasn't exactly his cup o' 
tea. 
It was large and inefficient, 
it 
wasn't his kind of property when he got here. Ever since then 
he's been changing it around to the way he 
liked 
it. 
The other 
main change came in the early '60s when it became obvious that 
the state was gonna buy that, and so instead of fighting it down 
to the last wire and losing everything 
what he did was go ahead 
and start negotiating on 
it, 
and 
it ended up fairly amiable 
anyway, they bought up all the original family property, mostly 
for the water because they had very little water in the area, and 
then with the money from that he was able to buy this, and as I 
understand it there was a piece over here the state owned that he 
was able to work into the deal, which, usually you don't buy back 
from the state, but anyway he was able to secure all 
this and 
build this with the money from that, basically. 
So this is a 
much smaller place, that represents three thousand acres, when 
you really count all 
of the old parts, the long abandoned bogs, 
and so on, and this 
is three hundred some acres, 
it's a hundred 
fifty in actual cranberry bog, and then the rest is swamp and 
canals, water system. 
And this, he sat down from the very 
beginning to try to make it as efficient as he possibly could, so 
it's as 
level 
as we could make it. 
It's all 
two hundred foot, 
center to centers on the dams, exactly. 
The bogs change length, 
but they're all exactly the same width, so we're able to spray 
'em from one dam with a sprayer that goes out a hundred feet and 
go around the other side and do the other part. 
And then you 
don't need any ditches down the middle for water and so on and so 
on (recall the beautiful photos Joseph took of the drainage 
ditches in Whitesbog). 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 79 
Mal: So this was designed for machinery available at what 
date, say? 
Mark: 
He started planning in 
'67, and he was developing 
most of the equipment he needed at that time, at least the ground 
sprayer. 
He developed the wet harvester, it's not something he 
patented, but he developed it. The way we picked these, now, 
before the wet harvester became available, he had a small machine 
about the size of a desk that you walked behind that had rows of 
cones that would work in a dry bog, and 
it would sort of rake 
through the vines and flop up 
in a rotating bucket arrangement 
and then dump 'em 
in a bag in the back. 
My dad invented one of 
'em, and there's a few of 
'em still 
in use, he gets royalties 
when one 
is sold every once 
in a while. 
We had a dozen or so at 
work and they aren't nearly as nice, they don't pick as clean, 
they're harder on the vines, they drop a lot of berries. 
It's 
just not as nice, but it was the best they could do. 
It's a 
complicated machine, 
it breaks a lot, you have a lot of troubles 
with it. 
When he developed this, hand 
in hand with that is a 
water harvester which is a very simple machine as machines 
go, 
it's really just a head of welded—up thin bars 
that spins 
around, and the bog 
is flooded so that all 
the berries are 
floating up, and all you're doing is knocking them off, and then 
they just float on the surface and then you gather them together 
with a set of boards and run 'em up on an elevator out of the 
bog. The whole harvest over here 
is vastly simpler. 
My father 
can remember back 
in the very old days every body was on their 
hands and knees rakin' with their fingers. 
Dad says as a little 
kid he thinks he can remember that. 
Then in WWI they just 
couldn't get people, they got migrants, Italians, I suppose, out 
of Philadelphia, and then during the war people were doing other 
things, so they came up with the scoop, you've seen the hand 
scoops, people collect them now as antiques, 
so anyuway they 
used those and that out it down to one—tenth as many people. 
They used to have a couple hundred people just lined up along the 
whole bog going across. 
And now we pick this whole place with 
basically two people, one guy on each machine, and on one good 
morning they can pick two of these bogs. And then we'd have a 
whole nother crew with maybe just half a dozen guys in 
it coming 
along behind after we've brought the water up to as high as we 
can get it so 
it's easier to gather together and then they run 
'em up in trucks. 
So it's almost like two separate operations 
with at least one man working full time getting the water to the 
right level to start with, and then as soon as they're done 
picking, bringing it up another eight to ten inches to get it 
good and clear of everything so you can gather 'em in. 
MH: So who's still using the dry pickers? 
Mark: Around here it's similar to the blueberry operation. 
Wet picked cranberries don't hold up as well as the dry picked 
ones. 
There's something about knocking 'em off the stem and then 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 80 
having that open thing (the navel) exposed to the water or being 
in the water, but they don't hold up real well. 
they're fine for 
juices and the sauce and so on, but if you wanna sell 
'em fresh 
in the store 
in a box, they usually want dry picked ones for 
that, so they pay extra for that, but it 
is more work. 
So that 
tends to be your little growers. 
Around here they don't tend to 
do 
it. 
So all 
the fresh ones come from New England, they're not 
from this state at all. 
JOE Darlington: 
From the West Coast. 
There's one New 
Jersey Grower who 
is dry harvesting, and the only reason he's 
doing it 
is because he has to 
because he doesn't have a good 
water supply. 
Ed Steppler. 
Mark: He's brand new, he's only been doing it for just a 
couple years. 
He's renting a property. 
He's not using Tom's dry picker but another one. 
There are 
several different ones, and Mark's not sure what the differences 
are, because by the time those came out they were already into 
wet harvesting, and, the other dry pickers: "They're kind of 
like 
dinosaurs, interesting but not relevant. 
Same principle, but 
different mechanism. 
I'm sure my dad, 
if he were still using a 
dry picker would be on the 18th generation Darlington picker by 
now, 
it would not be the same machine he was working on then. 
I 
don't know. 
It's the equivalent of hand—picking your blueberries then 
packing them. 
The small growers have more time to mess around 
with it. 
We don't do any fresh fruit at all, just bulk 
containers. And then it goes out into pies and muffins and what 
not. 
We're willing to sacrifice a little extra money at that end 
in order not to have a whole row of people packing and sorting. 
The only major change they've made in the Buffin's Meadows 
bogs 
in twenty years: "The latest high tech cranberry technique 
is sprinkler irrigation. " The pump houses spread around are 
connected with a pipe that goes through three or four bogs with 
sprinkler heads every seventy feet. 
Division of labor in the family. 
Dad's genius 
is the 
machinery. 
Nobody in the state is as good at inventing the 
different kinds of machines and getting them worked out, and 
coming up with some machine that just looks totally different 
than any machine that anyone else has ever had but it works. 
Not 
that we've not had some flops, but it's a very tight knit 
industry for the most part in terms of all 
the other locals. 
We 
can borrow equipment back and forth, and the local machine shop, 
who's actually related because my younger sister married his 
older brother (Dave Thompson in Pemberton). 
Dave Thompson, 
machining and fabricating, 
is fantastic at coming up with the 
stuff that my dad can conceive of and his younger brother married 
my younger sister so we're related now. 
My dad will work out 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 81 
something and Dave will make it, and what'll happen is, 
somebody'II come up and look at it or will hear about it and 
we'll 
loan 
it to 'im and they'll try it out for a while and 
they'll come back and say, well we need this change or that 
change on 
it, 
and pretty soon some grower can go to Thompson and 
say, "Hey, 
look, I need a plunk, and he'll say, okay, I made it 
this way for whosywhatsits, and you want the bigger wheels or the 
smaller wheels or whatever, and he can just make it up for 'em. 
And every year we change it, 
and he ends up doing the changes on 
it, 
and so he sort of keeps up on that and he doesn't even need 
drawings or anything for the most part. 
There 
is one water picker now, 
it's sort of a continuum. 
Ours is set up one way, everybody else's set up a little 
differently. 
It's sort of a communal project. 
There's a couple 
things my dad has worked out and other people are sort of copying 
him. 
MH: A plunk isn't really a machine is 
it? 
Mark: Laughing. 
No. 
Mal: Could I take some pictures? 
Mark: Sure. 
Mark: So what I see my job right now is, my brother and I 
are trying to take care of all 
the day—to—day stuff and general 
policy, and obviously my dad has a huge say 
in all 
this. 
What 
would be 
ideal would be to have my father have a vote in 
everything, but not be 
intimately involved in every detail of 
operation, and not be tied in every day with every little project 
that goes on. 
What we need him to do 
is do nothing but develop 
machinery. 
That's what he loves to do, and he loves to have 
about two or three going at once so 
if one starts going into a 
jam he can just drop it and go concentrate on something else, and 
that's fine because we always have three or four things that need 
to be done, and 90 percent of the time you can't just go buy one. 
My brother's particular bend 
is the business end of 
it. 
He's the businessman in the family. 
He and his wife are getting 
a computer going. 
My end of 
it, well we've all got a little 
knack for equipment. We'll do a little brainstorming, 
my dad'II 
say, "Well supposing we came up with this kind of conveyor," 
and 
Joe and I are not engineers, but we'll say, "Well, 
if you did 
such and such, wouldn't that be a little simpler? " And he'll 
say, 
"I didn't think of that! 
And then he'll go off, and it'll 
look totally different, but at least we gave him the idea for it. 
My particular bend is keeping the equipment going, I'm more of a 
mechanic, and I'm the final say about buying some piece of 
equipment, say. 
MH: 
What's an example of a flop? 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 82 
Mark: I can show you one flop out there under the shed! 
Mal: Laughter. 
Mark: We're about to rip 
it apart to pieces, so ... We've been 
renting back from the state all the cranberry bogs that are over 
there, and the blueberry fields. 
Most of the bogs over there, 
none of them are anywhere near as nice as this, most of 
'em are 
level enough and uniform enough ditches, and they're level enough 
on the water, that we can pick 'em with our cranberry pickers. 
Now a few over there aren't suitable for our blueberry pickers at 
all. 
They're just too rough. 
(end of side one) 
Side Two 
Forty bogs. 
Mark: About the harvesting. 
Some of the bogs over there on 
old Whitesbog that we rent back we thought at first were just far 
too rough for our ride—on harvesters. 
Some of the growers have 
smaller machines that one man walks behind, and the wheel 
is 
powered but you just walk behind it. Ours are much more like a 
big tractor and they have a ten foot head on 
it. 
Over there, 
very bad soft conditions, thick vines, very random ditches, very 
deep ditches, that meant for a long time that we weren't able to 
harvest them using our big ride ons. 
So we hired 
Glickmans (sp) 
from Jeffrey's Branch, when they were done their harvest to come 
in for a percentage and harvest a couple of the rougher bogs over 
there, because we didn't think we could do 
it ourselves. 
We've 
gotten a better and better deal from 'em, but it's still not a 
good deal from our standpoint. ..So we modified our pickers, we 
put big tractor tires on them, and after we were all done this 
place this year we rented some small walk behinds just in case, 
but we went ahead and tried our big ride ons with tractor tires 
on them. Three of them close together, with chains on 
'em just in 
case they got stuck. 
And we managed to get it picked over there 
ourselves. 
So we're overcoming that obstacle the way we like to , with 
a machine, rather than hiring a half dozen people. 
So, that's 
the kind of thing we're good at. 
The guys that we rented the 
small walk—behind pickers from 
borrowed 
this year somebody 
else's big ride on picker, they came and watched ours and they 
weren't happy with theirs and now they're going to modify theirs 
to be 
like ours. 
The beauty of my dad's engineering is that it 
doesn't look great, 
it 
looks rather strange most of th time 
usually, no frills on it at all. It's elegant from an engineering 
standpoint, because its as simple and easy to build as a machine 
can be and get the job done. They were powering theirs 
hydraulically and they had the head divided up in half and all 
that, my dad took one look at that back then and said, no you 
don't need that, just have it a solid head and run 
it with a 
chain right off the motor, and that's the way ours have always 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 83 
been and they're gonna change back to ours. 
MH: 
Have inventors 
in other parts of the country been 
helpful to you? 
Mark: 
Almost all 
the major projects around here have been 
you go look how somebody else does 
it, 
get your idea and you 
change it, and then you find somebody else has got a machine 
similar, and you work on that. 
The clearest case of that has 
been our big blueberry harvester that, there are commercially 
available blueberry harvesters that are much bigger, much more 
expensive, much harder to deal with, more complicated. and we 
wnet and looked at all that, and what Dad developed with some 
help from us 
in the last couple years is something that's much 
easier to build and maintain, far cheaper to buy and does a 
better picking job than anything else we've seen at all. 
Some of 
the others are forty—fifty thousand dollar monsters that are so 
unmanueverable you have to take out a couple bushes at the end of 
the row so you can get turned around. 
Dad's machine will get up 
and down these rows, all thats left really is a little path, you 
know they had hand picking in mind, they never thought about 
machines 
(when they planted the bushes). 
It's just a shame, we 
would have gone ahead and patented it but it's probably too close 
to somebody else's coffee picker, and we were willing to pay 
royalties, but they were brothers and they fight like cats and 
dogs. 
So we have em and can use em which is quasi 
legal but we 
certainly couldn't sell em. 
It's a shame, 
if we could've worked 
that part out, Thompsons could've made the basic machine and sold 
em, and, 
it wouldn't 've been a major revolution in the area or 
anything like that but it would've sold better than the other 
harvesters. 
Chisolm—rider, they make great harvesters and they wanted to 
see 
if they could sell one, and they came down and looked at the 
machines and the man just shook his head and walked away, I was 
surprised he didn't even ask any more questions, he just took one 
look and decided it wasn't what he wanted. 
He looked at all 
the 
others and then he came back and looked at my Dad's, and stuck 
around to see 
it work a little bit, and thereafter he didn't even 
bother with the others, he just came down here. And the next year 
he brought down his version that uses some of the same principles 
as my dad's, which again are not entirely original, but he came 
out with a slightly different machine, which for various reasons I 
don't think worked 
as nice as our. 
I don't know what's 
happening on 
it recently. 
Anyway, I think ours 
is about the 
best. 
MH: State of the art 
Mark: I think so. 
And it's not even something that we're 
constantly refining or anything, because the blueberries are not 
a big part of the business, the cranberries are nine—tenths of 
it. 
So we're not spending a lot of time each winter coming up 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 64 
with 
a lot of changes on 
it. 
The blueberry harvester works good 
enough so we 
leave it. 
Cranberry harvesting is generally more efficient. 
Blueberry 
harvesting, you break off some branches, you pick some green 
ones, you drop some ripe ones, 
it's a pretty crude average, even 
when we're all 
done and we've picked it three times, there's 
still some berries on there and we've dropped a fair percentage, 
so the cranberries, we go 
in and we pick it once. 
We overlap, 
but you only go through once, and we get ninety something percent 
and it's a much more efficient operation. 
The blueberries I 
around, but the cranberries, I like to 
really have the feeling that, 
if we 
down as good as the cranberries we'd be 
getting enough out of 
it to 
don't mind showing people 
show people around. 
You 
could get the blueberries 
in good shape. 
We're not 
time and money into 
it. 
No U—pick it operation. 
MH: what's happening over in G—Pole Bridge; 21GT.? 
put the 
Mark: What we're doing over there, since we've bought it 
we've just been renting the bogs over there one year at a 
from the state, that was part of the original agreement. 
certainly didn't object to having 'em 
in production, 
it was sorta 
nice. 
It fit in with the whole scheme, as long as they owned 
it 
and had the water system for it. 
Part of the original agreement 
was that we could rent it back for as 
long as we were interested 
and get the production off it to help ease into this until this 
until this became producing, because you don't just put in a bog 
and have the bog produce that year. 
It's not like a corn crop or 
something where you put it in and produce and then you take it 
out and put in something else. 
They're getting much better, 
especially with the sprinkler you can get a crop out of em 
in two 
or three years. 
But without the sprinklers to water 'em everyday 
depending on natural rainfall and stuff you cant' figure on a bog 
really producing for six or seven years. 
Once they're 
prune 'em and stuff and they'll 
last basically forever 
anybody knows. 
so 
it's a different kind of farming. 
Anyway we've been renting them over there a y 
and then recently the state's done an about f 
they definitely want to keep indigenous farmi 
know the whole Pinelands thing, you know, and 
like to keep it 
in cranberry and blueberry pr 
now even a move afoot to make it (Whitesbog ) 
site and all 
that. 
so they came to us actual 
you like a long—term lease instead of this year—to—year. and we 
said "Of course, that way we can know what we're doing." 
so we 
banged out a mutually agreeable 25—year lease, so we know we have 
the bogs we're interested in over there at a very fixed low rent 
for 25 years. 
So we can even put in some capital 
improvements 
and change things the way we want. 
So what we're doin is 
time 
They 
in you 
as far as 
ear at a time 
ace and decided that 
ng 
in the area, you 
they'd very much 
oduction, there's 
a National Historic 
ly and said "Would 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 85 
basically modernizing, 
it will never look as nice as this, 
because we don't own it, and, frankly, to put something in this 
kinda shape nowadays is just too much money. 
It's just 
staggering. 
so what we're doin' over there is the best we can. 
We had one twenty five acre bog that was just unmanageable. 
It 
was huge. 
It had this ditch that went 
over the top of your 
head. 
It just wanders, 
it's got oxbows in 
it, you can't pick it, 
it's knee deep, 
it's just a mess over there. 
They were over 
there just tryin to survey it when it was dry. 
so we've criss— 
crossed it with a couple of dams 
in just the right place and 
we've divided it up 
into quarters, so that at least instead of 
one huge twenty five acre bog that 's four or five feet out of 
level, imaging trying to protect that from frost. 
There's no 
sprinkler over there, so what you have to do 
is put water on 
it 
to keep it from freezing. 
It's four feet out of 
level, that 
means the top end's gotta be five feet deep before the lower end 
even sees any water, and that represents a staggering amount of 
millions of gallons. 
And over there we don't have a closed water 
system, you have to open the gate at the bottom and let 
it go 
downstream and that's it. 
Over here we pump it back up 
into the 
reservoir, and you lose what seeps into the ground of course, and 
in evaporation, but basically we've got a fairly closed system 
here. 
Even over here it's a pain to try to flood something, but 
over there unless you started two days ahead you could forget 
trying to protect it from frost. 
And it quite often would come 
down by the end of the harvest season where we'd have just enough 
water to flood it once. 
Do we flood it and keep it from freezing 
so we'll have some to harvest 
but won't have any water to 
harvest with, or do we 
let it freeze and then flood and try to 
get what's left, etc. 
So anyway, we divided it up, which requires a lot of 
bulldozer work, trucking dams in, a lot of gates, we make our own 
wooden gates. 
The uprights are creosoted, gateboards are of 
cedar, and what's under water all 
the time 
is oak, because it 
won't rot if 
it's under all 
the time. It's the wet—dry, wet—dry 
that rots 
it. 
So over there in a couple of cases we've 
completely abandoned the bog and we're just flooding it and the 
vines were completely . 
So we're attempting to modernize at Pole Bridge. 
We're 
dividing up existing bogs without hurting the vines too much. 
Abandoned bogs that were dead we levelled and we're replanting it 
completely with a new variety from the West coast, Stevens. 
MH: What happened to Lou Grant's role as foreman? 
Mark: bob Hopkins now is working water full time. 
What it 
means is at least two, maybe three trips a day around the whole 
place, driving slow enough so you can really keep an eye on stuff 
and check it out. 
In another month we'll start flooding it 
in 
for the winter, so everything'II be under water then. 
His 
busiest time of year is during the harvest. 
He was here before 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 86 
dawn and after dark every day. It's not hard work, but it's nerve 
wracking, because you've always got water flowing and it's 
especially nerve wracking over there where everytime you turn 
around you've got a new dam 
and a new gate, and you're not quite 
sure what it's going to do. And of course the new dam doesn't 
have any grass on 
it, we can't turf anymore, we just have to 
let 
it grow in. 
What that means is 
it's very soft and gooey and 
you're gonna get a lot of washing. 
there's always the beavers 
lugging something off or the muskrats digging a hole or two 
in 
the dam. 
And he's dealing with gates over there that , they 
start developing a little leak and how bad does it get before you 
start trying to get down to the original thing and try to patch 
it. 
Back then without the heavy equipment what they had to do 
was do it all 
by hand, working three eight hour shifts, twenty 
four hours a day, working hand pumps to keep it dry while another 
crew built the dam. 
Canals were shovelled out by hand and 
in 
shifts 
too. 
See the way they'd build a bog back then was to get 
a natural swampy place and then get a mule or whatever you had, 
build a dam across the bottom end and flood it, and keep it under 
water for a while, and that would kill most everything, and then 
the big trees I guess you had to pull out with a mule, or dig 'em 
out. 
I don't know if they had blasting. 
Then they could plant 
by hand. 
MH: 
re: more diffs between land they own and the land they 
lease. 
Mark: Well, the best thing we could work out with the state, 
obviously we'd like to build gates and keep everybody out, we 
have a lot of trouble with vandalism and theft even on this 
property where it's very controlled. 
We've had equipment 
disappear out of these sheds right where everybody's living, so 
you can imagine what it's like over there. 
So over there we were 
able to put up some cable gates, and put up a sign, to keep out 
vehicles. 
But if somebody walks in and says they want to see the 
cranberry operation, you can't keep 'em out. 
The state did that 
so they could bring 
in school groups. 
What that means is that 
we're not able to close it down tight. 
People are used to being 
there, hunting, and whatever. 
So what we'd like to do 
is get permission to put a trailer 
over there so someone can stay there and keep an eye on the 
place. 
We have one pump house over there and somebody stole the 
battery out of 
it and a lot of gas. 
So Pole Bridge we've got 
fairly well closed off and we've got permission from the state. 
But up towards the main reservoir from the center (Conservation 
and Environmental Studies Center) they're the flatter bogs, 
they'd be closer to what we want to end up with right now, but 
we'll never put in sprinklers. 
We'll never modernize them 
entirely because we can't keep people out. 
Vandalism is too big 
a factor. 
Bobby Hopkins' son would live 
in 
it as part of his salary. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 87 
The Pinelands Commission wants the trailer to be three hundred 
feet from wetlands, "Well we wanted it right on the bog, this was 
a basic conflict to start with." 
A serviceman comes in and Mark 
takes care of the bill. 
Mal 
and I confer over camera batteries. 
I say we're getting to the end of our allotted time. Mark 
says he's doing alright. 
He's waiting for a fellow to come and 
fertilize the bogs with an airplane. 
I ask about microclimates. 
Mark: 
We had a terrible year for blueberries. 
We had a 
high ground frost on May 10, 29 degrees even on high ground. 
Another fellow comes in to interrupt.

Mark talking about fertilizing, which they're doing 
right now from an airplane. 
Like much of what happens in 
farming, there are no definite guidelines. 
Some do it 
in the 
fall, some 
in the spring, some say, why bother? 
Mark describing 
the cranberry packing house over at Whitesbog and the concepts 
informing its design. 
It was designed to refrigerate the berries 
as best it could. 
The railroad track, sawdust for insulation, 
fireproof doors. 
The Friends of Whitesbog group that is forming. 
Mark and his father are on different subcommittees of 
it. 
One 
proposal, a pick your own blueberry operation, where Darlingtons 
maintain one or two fields for them to prevent spread of disease 
to their own fields, and they keep the proceeds. 
Mal 
asking about the metal working shop, admiring the set 
up. Middle of the winter is the maintenance period. 
"We get into 
a little bit of everything." A couple of the machines are out 
working. 
We're pruning the cranberry vines now. 
There are 
vines, a solid mat of vines, 
like strawberries, with horizontal 
runners and vertical uprights that have the berries. 
The pruners 
cut the vertical vines. 
Have you ever seen a hay rake for behind 
a tractor? We've self—powered one of those and put steering on 
it, 
and replaced the metal fingers with hooked knives. 
It goes 
through and cuts everything and leaves a windrow, and then you 
move the windrow over and end up with a thick roll 
of vines that 
we truck off. 
The machine was out working while we were there. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 89 
over in C section. 
That's mostly our invention I guess. 
Hard to really keep 
track of. 
MH commenting on the neatly squared character of the 
bogs. 
Mark: There are a few funny corners, but everything else 
does feel chaotic when you're used to dealing with one of these. 
20,000 barrels from here 
in a month. 
Then we go over there and 
harvest almost a tike acreage and 
it takes us half again as 
long 
and it's a total mess and everyone is going in over their waders 
and freezin', and we do that for a couple thousand barrels. 
his 
dad gets out there 
in waders with everyone else. 
Bad wind noise here. 
We have more acreas in cedar swamp trying to get the water 
that 
we do 
in actual production and that's fairly typical. 
500 
some acreas here, 150 in cranberries. 
Haines uses a whole river. 
But even so they've got a bunch of wells they rely on. 
The 
sprinklers, 
even those were customized in their design and 
installation. 
They ran them down the center of the bog. "We 
flood 'em for the winter, from Christmas time one, and we always 
flood at the harvest. 
What this means is that in cold weather, 
somebody stays up and watches the digital alarms until 
it 
reaches a critical temperature, and then he comes out and starts 
up all the sprinklers. 
Then you shut 'em down when the sun comes 
up. 
They use a telephone alarm. Mark is always the back—up 
assistant. 
Darlingtons trust their digital alarms more than many 
growers do. 
If the vines freeze, you've lost them. 
The vines on 
the top can freeze, but not down to the ground. 
150 In mid—winter the vines can be growing into the ice at 
the top. 
"What they had 
in JJ White's time was pretty close to a 
natural situation. 
They put in some gates and tried to flood it 
in the winter, but they pretty much let it go as 
if 
it was 
something natural. 
That's fine if all you want it 25 barrels to 
the acre. 
But over here the best we do 
is 
175 barrels to the 
acre. 
168, you can have solid ice over the vines when their 
dormant, and snow on top of that and it won't hurt them. Matter 
of fact it helps, because it kills the bugs that are wintering 
over. (Recall how ice moving over the mud in the marshes produces 
what George Heinrichs calls "cut—outs", clams that can be easily 
harvested because they've been "cut out" of the mud, but you have 
to act fast before it gets warm enough for the clams to dig back 
into the mud). 
Then the big decision is always when you pull 
the water off 
in the spring, you want the longest growing season 
you can have, but then every night you have to worry about frost. 
With the sprinklers it's not too much of a problem. 
We can pull 
it off now in March where we used to worry about pulling it off 
in April or May, and you have to watch at night now to see 
whether to turn the sprinklers on but the growing season is 
longer and 
it pays as an incentive. 
Its nerve wracking, 
if you 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 90 
have one frost, and a pump goes out at night, that's it. You've 
lost the whole shootin' match. (Gambles, risks, timing) 
Mark has 
back—up pumps, an electric starter motor for priming the pumps, 
to clip onto the battery. 
Sooner or later one's gonna catch us, 
but that's farming, that's playin the odds. 
This is one of the disasters I was tellin you about. 
Dad 
would probably kick me 
if 
he knew I were showin it to you. 
One 
of the attempts before we took our pickers over there and tried 
picking in those very rough bogs was, this 
is a floating 
cranberry picker. 
The idea is that it doesn't touch the ground 
at all, except for the actual picking heads. 
Now the idea was 
that this goes on two cables to get stretched all 
the way across 
the bogs, and 
it pulls itself along on those cables with the 
picking head down and it'll 
go right across ditches, you can 
ignore the fact that this ditch is eight feet and deeper than 
your head because it just doesn't matter. 
It has two pickin 
heads so 
it overlapped itself. 
You have a man on 
it with two 
levers and he controls how fast it moves the cables, and with 
that you can steer it. 
It's a boat. 
This is all fiberglass and 
plywood. 
this 
is all made out of aluminum to be 
light. 
It's a total disaster. 
The problem is that putting those 
cables across the bog is just a heck of a lot more work than we 
thought. 
We thought you could just drop it down there and then 
pull 
it tight and it would just pop right up there and go nice 
and straight. 
And even with a lot of pull 
on 
it 
it catches on 
all 
kinds of stuff, we can hardly get the cables up right. 
Then 
we found that the thing gets a lot more traction with the picking 
heads than we thought. 
The picking heads started to pull 
it 
along with the cables and 
if you move at the speed of the picking 
head it's not picking anything. 
The problem is when you pick the 
vines with a rotating head like that and you tend to comb the 
vines in a certain direction you can't go back the next year and 
comb against it, or you'll 
lose a lot of crop, it's very hard on 
the vines. 
So with this machine going up and back, going one way 
the heads have to be faster and then going back it has to go 
in 
the same direction only slower, so 
it's fighting you. 
Anyway it 
was a total disaster, so we're stealing the parts off 
it. 
MH: When do you test these things out? 
Mark you can't do 
it during season. 
In the early spring we 
plunked it 
in the water before we took it off. 
If we could be 
out there at midnight when nobody was around trying this kind of 
stuff we would be. 
We went out and played with it for a little 
while and then Dad got in a little sulky mood and then we went 
out and we tried it again, and we tried this and that, and 
finally the word was "Park it."...If anybody was around we'd 
pretend it, 
"Oh, 
it's our duck boat!" 
It's bad enough when 
people show up to watch the established equipment, because it 
always breaks down. 
Sooner or later there'll be a floating 
picker. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 91 
So we've already got plans for two motors on that, 
it will 
live again, but not in 
its original form. 
It's an 
interesting 
concept. 
Now this is one of our other cranberry pickers, with 
tractor tires that will 
go through all kinds of stuff. 
The only 
interesting part is this head that just goes around in the same 
direction you're going, a little faster, and 
it just knocks 
everything free. It's fine in water just about as deep as the 
axle, because it can't handle water any deeper than that. 
We 
have three of them, and this winter we'll modify that one over to 
the big wheels, and we're going to build a fourth one with the 
motor off of that thing (laughs, as he does every time he 
mentions the floating picker). 
The spare back up of the elevator that goes down into the 
bogs to 
lift the cranberries out. 
The blueberry picker, we 
economize by using the same wheels on the different machines to 
harvest the different crops. 
What this does 
is the bushes come 
down through here and this vibrates like mad, and its got a huge 
fan over here which rattles 'em loose and it blows across and 
gets caught in the conveyor and comes back. 
One of the fertilizing airplanes comes through. 
Mark re—explains the blueberry picker to Mal. 
The huge fan 
has 70 mph winds. The leaves blow off, and the berries run down 
to the conveyer. 
The combination of the fan with the vibrations 
is the best. 
The engine has to be pretty powerful. 
It makes 
enough noise to wake the dead. 
You climb up to the top of the 
(ca. 7 ft 
tall X 5 ft long X 4 ft wide if memory serves me 
right) machine 
by a ladder built onto the side. 
The driver 
controls the machine with two levers. 
"A good operator can take 
this thing down a row and then turn and when a blueberry bush, so 
that it goes between the wheel and the machine, So this thing'II 
turn 
in 
its own length." 
This is their invention. 
Butchie 
Thompson made up the frame and they constructed everything else, 
the shakers etc. 
They have three motors on 
it, one hydraulic, 
and the others electric. (Mark goes to check on the fertilizer 
process). 
Side 2 
One of the things we experimented with is fertilizers with 
trace elements in 
it. 
You ask around and you find nobody has any 
data. So we're experimenting. 
Like every other experiment we've 
ever done, 
in one case it 
looks like a clear advantage, 
in 
another case it doesn't make any difference at all 
and 
in another 
case it's a clear detriment. 
So, welcome to farming. 
We pass a 
blueberry field. (We're in the car, with MH at the wheel.) We're 
on our way to watching the planes take off and land. 
Watching some planes take off from the field before we 
proceed to the middle of the field. 
Although Mark is a pilot and 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 92 
has flown off of the airstrip there, 
he doesn't fly cropdusters. 
"I mean, there's flyin' and then there's cropdustin.'..When 
you're flyin yourself and you're within a thousand feet of the 
ground you're doin it for some special reason and you're bein' 
extra careful. 
That's very difficult flyin' 
it's not somethin 
you do for fun." 
The motor can be heard in the background. 
We turned the tape off at this point. 
The following section is a reconstruction of the missing parts by 
Mal 
and MH. 
— Mark and his father would just as soon take the afternoon off 
sometimes and go flying, whereas Joe is the real businessman who 
can calculate everything in terms of cost. 
—Bobby Hopkins is the new "water—checker". 
He's not quite a 
foreman because he doesn't like to manage people (recall what 
Bonnie noticed about Orlando Torres' natural 
leadership). 
Old 
timers with the proper authority make the best foremen. 
Hopkins 
was standing there watching the planes with his young grandson 
Matthew, and Mark had commented that he knew that Hopkins would 
bring his grandson because his daughter works, and his wife could 
use the relief. 
Mark commented that he knew that yet another 
person would be growing up knowing something about how the water 
works in the area. 
When the old timers stop working is a tricky 
question because, first, they know so much and how do you replace 
them? and second, 
if 
they stop working it's a sure bet that they 
will die 
in six months or so. 
We're getting into Whitesbog now. Mal comments that building 
the packing house like a refrigerator, separating the three 
sections with brick walls was a terrific idea.

We generally begin our music with some discussion of the 
Lenape Indians who were the first musicians that would have been 
found here 
in New Jersey, and the Indian flute and 
its players 
seem to have pretty much disappeared. 
The next major influence 
that you would have found 
in the New Jersey shore area -- Ocean 
County pines -- were the English who left us two kinds of music 
-- English fiddle pieces and English vocals -- we'd like to ask 
our most excellent fiddlers Glenn Borden and Lenore Franzen 
if 
they would perform "Soldiers' Joy" for us, sometimes known as 
"King's Head".

"Mount Holly Jail" -- an old English vocal 
"I was lucky 
enough to meet Dr. Herbert Halpert up at Rutgers University and 
he said that, no, this wasn't a song from the pines, but that 
this was a hard times piece and it was found pretty much all 
over 
the United States and generally it was song with the name of the 
town closer to you that had a jail -- 
in other words, 
if 
it was 
Toms River it would be the Toms River Jail. 
In our case it was 
Mount Holly.

The next major influence we would have found on the 
music of the pines and the shore area was the Spanish -- where 
legend has 
it that they sailed into our local 
area and along with 
some buried gold they left us a tune or two. 
A tune supposedly 
left by the pirates, called the "Spanish Fandango" -- that's what

We're moving ahead in time to music that's 
approximately 100 years old, from my grandmother -- originally 
called "The Little Boy 
in Blue" 
--it's the only civil war song I 
knew outside of "Marching through Georgia" -- My father sang it 
as "Two Pictures"

The next song is approximately of the same vintage, 
about 100 years old, and considerably cheerier. 
My father called 
it "Two Maidens" 
(end of side one) 
Side Two

-- 
Another kind of old song -- that 
I think 
is around a hundred years old. 
I knew it as a fiddle 
piece, and my wife learned it from her grandmother as a vocal. 
So Arlene, how 'bout a little swimmin song. (Arlene sings this 
solo.)

When the homeplace (the Albert Brothers' Cabin) was 
coming to an end it became obvious to a lot of us going out there 
that it had to stop sooner or later, and 
it was very hard to tell 
George and Joe Albert exactly how we felt about the music, but I 
did write a song entitled Albert Brothers' Cabin in the Sky which 
was my way of telling George and Joe how much I appreciated all 
the years and years and years of Saturday Nights that we enjoyed 
out there.

TX01: 
G—Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge; 18GT Betty Woodford talking 
about 
an owl 
she just treated -- an owl 
that was stunned. 
He 
opened his mouth to take a mouse. A beautiful well—formed owl. 
A 
female was there -- 
in 
all predatory birds the female is smaller. 
MH: How do you get the mice for it? (animal) 
BW: We have a laboratory that raises them. 
We can't tell 
the name of the place, and we have to be there at exactly the 
right time to pick them up. 
They haven't been operated on -- they were too large or too 
small. 
BW: We're sorry to hear about your loss -- does that mean 
you won't get the project completed? 
Hufford talks about the state of Christine's work, vis a vis 
what she'd managed to accomplished. 
BW: She and Elaine went to Betty Wendt's when we were all 
at 
the garden club meeting. 
MH: 
I'd be curious to hear what it was about the slide 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 101 
presentation that had you concerned. 
BW: 
I was distressed that, for one thing, many of the 
slides that I saw didn't represent Pine Barrens people, or for 
that matter, a section of people -- they represented small 
incidents that happened here and there. 
MH: Could you be specific? 
BW: The man's yard that had the trash burner in 
it. 
He did 
not build a new cement support around it to protect anything from 
fire. 
That's an old, old hot dog stand kind of thing. 
I don't 
think that's folklore 
-- 
it just happens the man's a clever man 
that took the bottom of a thirty gallon hot water tank and made 
himself a way to do away with trash -- the rather small amount 
that he was burning. But that to me 
isn't folklore of the Pine 
Barrens. 
MH: He was steam bending the oak ribs for his sneakbox. 
EW: (Elizabeth Wendt) Who sponsored your project? 
MH: L of C, Interior, NJSCA, DEP, NJHC, Pinelands 
Commission. 
EW: And where are the slides going? 
MH: Originals, L of C; 
reference archive, to undetermined 
site. 
EW: When they came on Friday they wanted to photograph my 
yard and gardens, and she photographed the whole inside of my 
house -- standing on one of my chairs. 
What has that got to do 
with this project 
or any of the things that you girls are doing? 
MH: She should have gotten your permission, and 
if you 
objected to anything you should have said as much. 
EW: Well, I don't like 
it. 
What does it have to do with 
your project? 
MH: You're a historian, aren't you? 
EW: What does that have to do with it? 
This was my personal 
house? 
What does it have to do with my yard? 
The answer 
typically is "nothing." 
MH: Who says nothing? 
EW: I do. 
JVI: I was not at your presentation, but Mary and Sue just 
came to my house, and I feel 
that my house is my expression of 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 102 
me, and my garden is 
an expression of me. 
Now maybe as a 
folklorist -- this girl 
is not here to speak for herself, but she 
may have looked at it as i would have, and her mind was taking 
pictures, and, she may have been seeing things there that were 
expressions to her --
EW: 
She should have been photographing these girls as they 
spoke -- and this 
is nothing against the girl -- she was a lovely 
young lady -- she picks up her light and goes into the dining 
room. 
All 
of a sudden I see her 
in the dining room photographing 
things on the top of the cupboard -- Where are these pictures 
going? 
What has my house got to do with this project? 
SS: I would say there was a breakdown in communication and 
if 
you want you can screen the slides and we can destroy them if 
you want. 
MH: We comb through Indian shell mounds trying to 
reconstruct the world of the Indians -- if we had photographs we 
wouldn't have to do this. 
EW: Another thing 
is that John Doe who lives down the road 
20 miles 
is helping to pay for the project -- he's not interested 
in 
the inside of my house -- he wants the folklore, not the 
inside of my house. 
It 
is private. 
JVI: They were trying to get a cross—section. 
EW: At that point I didn't want to say anything because I 
would have been downright rude. 
But the more I thought of 
it, 
the madder I got, because it's public funds. 
MH: 
Is there anyone living in the Pinelands whose interior 
you'd think would be appropriate to photograph? 
EW: I don't know, dear, because I go visiting as a friend, 
not as you do, 
looking for particular unique things. 
SS: We become friends with the people we 
interview... 
EW: You're temporary friends. 
SS: No, I've done a lot of fieldwork projects and I still 
maintain ties with the people who become close friends in the 
project. 
It's one of the reasons why I do what I do. 
JVI: You develop these ties because you go 
inside a person, 
and try to get this information -- this folklore out -- this 
person invites you into their home and shows you their interior 
and you tape their interior -- what is 
in their mind and what is 
in their heart, so I can see how a bond of friendship would 
develop. 
In other words, you can't walk down the street and 
shake hands with somebody and have an opportunity to share their 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 103 
soul -- whereas you may, 
in a case like this when you know 
somebody wants to know what's inside you would then, 
if you 
trusted them, I would have a tendency to spill 
it all, because 
look, here I am, take it as 
it 
is, 
and I hope that you are 
looking at 
it the same way I am. 
The other day the girl was 
looking at 
it her way --
EW: Yes but I know what she came for and what she was after 
and (explosively) My house is no folklore! 
JR: Betty doesn't feel that she's a typical Pine Barrens 
resident, and indeed I agree with her! 
She has a home that's a 
bit like a museum in that she has collected many old utensils. 
She's not at all a typical Pine Barrens resident and she 
shouldn't be taken as typical. 
Mrs. Woodford is not a typical 
Pine Barrens resident. 
Nor is the Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge 
typical. 
GW: But thinking of the slides they showed, none of that to 
me typifies Pine Barrens stuff, so I'm not really sure of the 
focus of this whole thing. 
What's your purpose? 
MH: What do you think we should be looking for? 
someone: These are all Johnny—come—latelies. 
JR: Do you want to go way back to the people that lived here 
a couple hundred years ago, or do you want to take the Johnny 
come latelies. They bring their culture in from Philadelphia, 
Riverton, -- you want to go see some of the wonderful gardens 
they put in over here in Piney Hollow -- It's disgusting! They 
put in huge lawns. 
This 
is not typical, and it's not even good 
for the area. 
MH: What's typical of the area? 
JR: Bush! 
EW: Define the Pine Barrens for Betty --
MH: The lifestyles, the traditions, of those who live 
in the 
national reserve -- what would you consider to be the Piney 
people? 
BW: What about the people who collect all sorts of greens 
and pine cones -- did you find that? 
SS: Yes, pine cone collectors, muskrat trappers 
BW: Well we didn't see pictures of that -- what we saw was 
distressing -- the image of that dressmaker's dummy (Miss 
Brookville) 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 104 
GW: Or the trimming of bushes being indicative of the need 
to control one's environment. 
That got to me. 
MH: We are looking at expressions of people/land 
relationships -- and there are many different kinds of 
relationships -- some people grow the food that they put in their 
mouths, and they come up with different ways of keeping pests out 
of the garden. Now there's a great hue and cry over the use of 
insecticides -- these people are using a mannikin scarecrow to 
keep birds away, they may be using marigolds to keep insects 
away. 
All 
of that stuff interests us. 
BW: I like the way you're saying this, but I didn't hear 
that when we 
listened to the lecture. 
MH: 
Well, I'm very sorry. 
BW: I was not aware that you had done the pine cone 
collectors. 
MH: We had slides of Leo Landy, who buys from those who 
gather them. 
BW: Of course it was such a poor day, and every shade was 
up. 
Men and women who give lectures on the folklore of the Pine 
Barrens -- they show a pile of pine cones, people who come 
in 
with sacks on their backs of things they've collected, and that 
to me would be what you would be after. 
That's piney culture 
because it's gone on for centuries. 
MH: What are some other things you'd like to see? 
BW: You told me you did the blueberries and cranberries, you 
probably did Mary—Ann Thompson's bogs. 
Viable industries that 
bring in someone's livelihoods. 
But those pots of chrysanthemums 
is not a cottage industry. 
That's just a great big truck that 
comes along and anybody who will buy her chrysanthemums gets her 
own for free and then they will turn around and sell 
at a profit. 
Those pots of chrysanthemums are raised way off. They have 
nothing to do with the 
local Pine Barrens people. 
GW: See very little will 
really grow in the Pine Barrens. 
BW: 
See, 
if they use the chrysanthemums, they're eventually 
gonna die -- they won't live 
in the sandy soil -- so I can't see 
how cottage industry fits into that. 
MH: You'd have to change the environment to grow 
chrysanthemums? 
BW: I know two people who gather all kinds of reeds and 
rushes and sedges -- they don't live in the Pine Barrens, but 
they go 
into the Pine Barrens --
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 105 
MH: Who are they? 
BW: They're people who earn their living doing this. 
MH: What are their names? 
BW: Now, wait a minute, I'd have to go back to my records. 
They came to a lecture that I gave and I was amazed to find out 
that they did the same things that the man does up at -- who 
lives outside New Lisbon (probably Wasiowich). 
And the whole 
family puts these things together and they sell 
to gift shops, so 
that's a cottage industry. 
MH: Would you accept mushroom gathering? 
BW: Are there people who do this? 
MH: Who would you consider legitimate? 
BW: The only people I know would be those who have studied 
them all 
their lives, I've had a couple of courses in 
it, but 
there are only about three mushrooms that I'll eat out of the 
pine barrens, and yet my daughter-in-law knew a woman who ate 27 
of them, but she's of Russian extraction. It's not a business 
with her, she's does for her own consumption. 
GW: She's a Johnny-come-lately. She's just lived here 25 -
30 years. 
JR: Thirty years? They're not Pineys. 
Henry Applegate would 
be a piney. 
MH: Would Freeman Taylor? 
BW: Yes he 
is. 
Know the woods like the back of his hand. 
I've been out with him many times. 
GW: The way the person lives -- like the Indians lived, with 
the environment. 
Well, Pineys would be typical, and the ones 
you'd want to study would be ones that lived here without 
changing the environment -- without putting in the lawns and the 
chrysanthemums. 
MH: Do you have your book here, A Home in the Pines 
BW: Yes, but it's all based on horticulture and botany and 
what not to throw away and no lawns 
in and so on. 
MH: 
Do you think that anyone living in the National Reserve 
should not grow marigolds or whatever in their yards? 
BW: The soil 
of the Pine Barrens is extremely high 
in acid, 
Hufford--63 Audiocassette logs 
page 106 
low ph --
MH: You do see a lot of geraniums 
BW: They have to put a lot of 
lime and fertilizer in to keep 
them living for more than a year or two. 
MH: 
How do they get the plants? 
BW: 
They're already there -- they just don't tear them 
down! 
If you have bearberry for goodness sakes don't touch 
it! 
It's a tragic thing to think that precious plants that don't grow 
anywhere else 
in the world are being destroyed. 
In Leisuretown 
there's so much lime and fertilizer there there isn't a single 
pine barren plant left -- that was one of the places I used to 
take people for field trips just to see those lovely rare plants. 
Now they're gone. 
It's grass, mostly. 
Dr. Wherry used to say 
you needed a carload of good Pine Barrens sand to replace --
That's beside the point, this isn't folklore really. 
MH: Well, Freeman Taylor 
BW: Yes, Freeman has a lawn -- he's getting less of a lawn 
--he's just one example. 
Freeman's a real 
special person. 
GW: See people are moving in great numbers into this area, 
and bringing their outside ways in, 
and they're changing the 
environment drastically. 
A good study with the opposite tone 
could make it unpopular to come in and rip everything up and put 
down sod. 
If you pushed the idea that really this 
is a very 
special environment and one should learn to 
live with it rather 
than drastically 
change it 
like these Italians down here and 
those people over there, then you could say something that might 
have a preserving effect on the area. 
MH: so real pineys don't do much to the environment. 
GW: and real smart people that move 
in don't either, they 
make wildlife refuges (laughing) 
MH: What about control burning? 
BW: That doesn't hurt it...I 
love the Pine Barrens, and I 
would feel hurt if 
the image that went out from here 
is the sort 
of thing that would promote someone making fun of 
it -- someone 
making fun of the people, misrepresenting it 
in any way at all. 
MH: Do you live 
in the Pinelands National Reserve? 
BW: Yes. 
We're in the Pine Barrens right here. 
MH: But you wouldn't view what you've done as a legitimate 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 107 
area of 
BW: I haven't done anything at all -- it's still 
left alone. 
There are no 
introduced plants here, 
MH: You haven't transplanted things from the woods to here? 
BW: Transplanting things from my area -- people who come 
here would like to see curly grass fern -- and I've had learned 
people say "Why don't you transplant some?" I say because I don't 
do those things, I don't transplant special things. 
EW: Do you have curly grass ferns (in your pictures)? 
MH: 
Is there any out now? 
BW: 
It's evergreen. The sterile fronds are there 
in 
wintertime. ..Outsiders discovered curly grass fern, not pineys. 
It took an educated man to recognize it was even a fern. 
The 
pineys were interested in a living. 
The plant didn't mean 
anything to them. 
MH: But the plant grows where the land was disturbed in 
connection with traditional 
industries 
BW: As long as 
it was Pine Barrens projects -- as 
long as 
it's cranberries and blueberries it will 
all 
come back, and after 
a fire it will 
all 
come back given time. 
It's when people come 
in with fertilizer and lime that it changes. 
When they change 
the ph. 
MH: Should people not introduce other species of pine? 
EW: 
Introduced plants in the pine barrens -- White Pine 
is 
considered the finest introduced plant in the Pine Barrens. That 
will prosper better than any other evergreen. 
It's not going to 
thrive without space and moisture -- Hybridized plants that's 
more or less a university project -- do you know the young man 
who believes that the pines 
in the pygmy forest are definitely a 
subspecies? 
Some people try to group them all together, and 
others make too many species out of them. 
But, back to pine 
barrens folklore... 
MH: Would hunting be a legitimate practice to 
look at? Small 
game season just opened yesterday. 
BW: For my part I'm against hunting, and I think a trap 
is a 
devious device that should be outlawed. 
MH: But people who are piney have made their living in this 
manner. 
BW: That's just part of the story -- they trap and they hunt 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 108 
animals. 
EW: As long as they used it for food, that's alright. 
BW: 
It's these people are carousing old men and they go out 
dressed fit to kill 
and they get all kinds of things and don't 
use them and don't eat them -- they're just -- honor and glory of 
killing. 
MH: What about people who pursue a piney lifestyle who are 
not part of the area, 
like Bill Wasiowich and Joe Albert 
BW: I think they represent a person who's interested in the 
pine barrens. 
I think their culture is 
interested. I think 
they've accepted a woods way of living, not piney culture 
necessarily -- but how did pineys get to be pineys anyway? 
Have 
you read what Elizabeth White wrote about education in the pine 
barrens? 
For instance 
she feels that you can find uneducated 
people who may live as some of the unfortunate pine barrens 
people did, 
in Camden or Newark -- and I was just hit by the 
impact of her feelings because she knew her father's workmen 
MH: How did the term "Piney" get started? 
BW: The same as the backwoods people in Kentucky got called 
hillbillies -- people who lived in the woods and didn't associate 
with 
the average society situation that would be on the outer 
rim of where they lived because perhaps poverty was one of the 
things -- lack of education. 
As far as folklore is concerned --
the way New Jersey handled free education -- a school board was 
given money for how many days the children attended in a year's 
time. 
Well the schools that had country roads, those children 
stayed home in muddy weather, and some of them had to help earn 
money. 
But the state made it tough on all 
of these schools 
if 
they didn't have perfect attendance. 
SS: A vicious circle. 
BW: Another thing, concerning folklore, I don't know how far 
back you go, but any folklore has 
its 
impact on today's 
civilization. I feel we're affected by much of the folklore that 
happened long ago right now, don't you? 
Side two 
000 
BW: Anyhow, back to the folklore. 
My concern was that what 
you were showing us that Sunday 
GW: What are you studying? What we are anxious to see 
preserved here 
is the way 
it 
is. 
What used to be marvelous 
orchard is now horrendous complex...But what do you want to 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 109 
study? 
What's left that's come down, or what people brought with 
them as baggage. A lot of 
it's been introduced like the plants, 
even though it's been here for several generations. 
Well, that's 
here and 
it's a fact. 
Everything has a slant. 
What's your 
slant? 
We don't want anything limed. 
It's going to go 
in the 
aquifire. 
It's going to change everything. 
They'll start taking 
the water out of here and ship it north. 
What do you do with a 
biosphere? 
That's a fascinating study to see how all 
these 
families have come in here and changed the environment and now 
are very happy or maybe not happy, because they got raccoons 
in 
their garbage cans or ducks 
in their swimming pools. 
SS: Anyone who lives 
in the Pinelands has Pinelands culture. 
EW: I don't accept your definition. 
JR: I went away frightened that what you might be 
recommending with your lack of knowledge of the pine barrens --
MH: Maybe the whole place will close down and become a 
wildlife sanctuary, and we will know that there were people here 
who sang menhaden shanties, who could tell 
russian fairy tales, 
who grew gardens in very different ways -- Germans in one way, 
Italians in another 
BW: The Italians followed the Russians 
MH: and people who knew how to build corduroy roads in a 
very fastidious way 
BW: Perhaps we saw one small side of what you've been 
learning. 
MH: We didn't have all 
our slides yet, and the room wasn't 
that conducive 
JR: 
It was a very poor presentation -- slides in backwards 
GW: Are you going to define the fact that some of these 
things you're targeting to show how all 
the groups are different? 
SS: We do not try and generalize 
BW: With the shrubs 
GW: That was a generalization that stood everyone's hair on 
end. 
MH: Would you consider Albert Hall a place to go for a taste 
of Pinelands culture? 
BW: 
I've taken friends to Albert Hall, we've enjoyed it --
there were one or two skilled musicians, the rest were -- but 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 110 
what they've done I think 
is good. 
Let me use for an example something that happened -- I had a 
reason to be up at Trenton for a meeting and they had at 
lunchtime planned to have piney music. 
Early on there was a 
woman who had been a student of Elizabeth Kite. And she did 
mostly reading from Elizabeth Kite's college notes. 
And some of 
the things that were said were very unfortunate. 
And I said to 
my friend, "Look to the left of me," there were about twenty or 
twenty two people over there -- all 
pineys -- they were livid 
with rage and outrage, and they had a good reason to be. 
Then 
after lunch the music came on -- there were only four of them 
that did the music, but before they started you could see them 
getting prepared for what was going to be said. And she said, 
"His people came over here in the late 1600s. 
Her'n got here a 
few years later," and she said, "Mine's been here since the 
revolutionary war," she said, "And we are Americans" and I 
thought 
"Hurray for you. Uneducated as they might be and not 
able to fully express themselves and so full 
of what was inside 
of them that they were finally unable to talk they were so angry. 
I thought this was great, because this woman who was so educated 
gave such a poor lecture. 
What she said was very hurting. 
This 
is often the case for people who are called hillbillies and 
pineys. 
The people who are college graduates in Chatsworth are 
not really considered pineys. 
But it isn't fair when people do things that hurt someone, 
and I thought some of your slides were hurting people that 
wouldn't want to be called that. 
MH: What was said? 
BW: That man had to control his environment, with his 
shrubs. How many pine barrens people does that represent. 
What 
does that have to do with the Library of Congress? 
EW: Some of the pictures you gals have taken makes me feel 
sick because it makes people wonder what kind of people live 
there? 
GW: You better be very careful of your generalizations. 
...Folklife -- that's probably the word we keep stumbling 
over, because do outsiders really live "Folk lives"? 
The way I 
live 
is not folklife. 
EW: But we are a distinct area. 
You can't put us -- the 
Pinelands -- 
in any other part of the united states. 
GW: But they're studying folklife in different parts of the 
country. 
EW: But we're special, we don't want to be folklife. 
You

take just exactly what's in the pine barrens and don't interject 
things from other parts of the country. 
MH: You belong to many different communities simultaneously 
(etc) 
and to discover what's distinctive we have to 
look at 
practices in the same types of communities throughout the 
country. 
We're interested in ways that people create meaning out of 
materials at hand. 
From here on out the interview goes around and around and 
around like the space shuttle. 
No new information. 
JVI: Even though I have a property line and I own 2.8 acres 
of the pinelands, what we're saying is that we all 
take the 
Pinelands very personally, but we don't know the Russians on the 
other end, and maybe we're being a little racist --
GW: You can't generalize 
MH: Maybe that's our principal message. You can't generalize 
about the Pinelands National Reserve. 
SS: How can you generalize about a million acres? 
JR: You can in a way -- you can generalize about the 
ecology. 
BW: Perhaps most of the people that listened to you at 
Smithville thought you were generalizing. 
There was a woman who 
studied folklore at Penn who was very disturbed -- she wrote 
letters to two Senators. 
MH: Who was she? 
BW: 
I'm not going to tell you. 
MH: I remember including a wide variety of slides --
glassblowing, charcoal making, boatbuilding, clamming, quilting, 
BW: Why were so many of your slides 
in backwards? 
JR: 
(the fist of her remark was that even if they were 
in 
frontwards everybody was turned off by the terrible presentation) 
MH: Did you object to the presentation of charcoalmaking? 
glassblowing? foxhunting? quilting? 
JR: I was turned off by the way you presented it. 
The 
person we're talking about from Penn (she was 
in fact, Ann Lutz, 
who took two courses at Columbia years ago) 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 112 
JR teaches special education. 
She was trained at Glassboro. 
GW: Why didn't you first get some of the people who had done 
some studies before? 
MH: We contacted John Sinton, Mary—Ann Thompson, David 
Cohen, Tom Carroll, 
BW: Good contacts -- I couldn't object to industries, but 
what about the dummy 
in the yard? 
MH: 
It was 
in someone's garden, 
in the Pine Barrens.

G—Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge; 18GT GW: 
If someone had come 
into my garden and looked into what was being done there, when I 
lived 
in Lima, Peru, and looked at something that was being done 
there, 
it may have been that I told my African servant, whom I 
brought over from East Africa who 
in turn had told the Peruvian 
Indian Gardener -- and the African worked for a Canadian before 
that -- and told that to the Indian gardener who had watched some 
Mestizo 
and then did it -- 
it would be very dangerous to say 
that that was typical of Lima, Peru. 
You're really dangerous if you take any of these things and 
say that it has any relevance for this area whatsoever. 
What 
relevance does that have for the Pine Barrens? 
You probably 
could have seen that garden 
in Ambler. 
JR: You probably could teach a class around it but what does 
it have to do with your purposes? 
GW: Where did the ideas for this project come from? 
Hufford explains again. 
GW: But I think they wanted the older ways. 
When we moved 
up 
into the Poconos, we lived there 17 years and we were known as

those city people. 
SS: Some folklorists study people who have one foot in and 
one foot out. 
For example, the Methodist minister in Egg Harbor 
City who 
is central to his community, and yet who hasn't grown up 
the re . 
Elizabeth Woodford discovers that she remembers Hufford 
interviewing her in 
1979, and that Woodford declined at that time 
to do a program in the school at Bayville. 
She agrees with the quilts, the pinecone gathering, the 
cranberries, etc. 
-- no rusting cars, no dressmaker dummy 
scarecrows -- "I think that is just exactly like putting the 
Polish jokebook in the time capsule." 
GW: What's your reaction to that? 
JR: That's a good analogy. 
BW: 
I'd hate to think that I could come to the Library of 
Congress and see pictures of rusty cars. 
EW: (explosively) 
I would too! 
The argument returns to the scarecrows in the gardens that 
shouldn't be there, because fertilizers shouldn't be used. 
Joanne Van Istendahl makes some good points, mediating: she 
stresses the power of the image -- and that the words that go 
with 
it may be forgotten. 
BW: 
The Russians I was speaking of moved to Hammonton. 
Have you been to the community near Great Adventures? 
MH: We have. 
BW: 
I hope we haven't been 
EW: 
Is the Internal Revenue Service going to 
look at the 
slides. 
JVI: Betty should have the opportunity to review her 
pictures. 
Some people have a worry of crime. 
SS: I have taken over the administrative wrapping up tasks 
of Christine's materials, and you can come and throw anything out 
that you want to. 
Christine is at fault for not explaining to 
you -- I usually explain everything when I go 
in. 
EW: 
If there's no name and address in there then I don't 
care. You just look and see. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 115 
SS describes the coffee table book produced out of the Blue 
Ridge project. 
We have to ask 
permission for everything that's 
used. 
EW: I didn't care about the gardens. 
SS: Christine was probably the fieldworker most sensitive to 
that stuff. 
It's surprising. 
EW doesn't want to 
look at the pictures. 
Just delete the 
name and address. 
GW: You've got some areas here that are really quite 
primitive -- where people only gather what they live off of, and 
in other areas it's ultra sophisticated. 
MH: Like what? 
SS: What do you think we just drove through, Mary? 
GW: Well, Medford's no slouch! 
I'd like to have their 
salaries and some of their degrees and so on. 
You couldn't go to 
Medford and say that it was typical Pine Barrens, I mean really. 
Certainly a lot of the people -- Betty, for example-- have given 
their heart and soul 
to the study of the Pinelands -- they're so 
thrilled to be here, they're changing it as little as they can, 
and preserving it as much as they can -- she's (Elizabeth Wendt) 
the historical society of Medford practically, and ask her how 
she makes apple butter. 
I was impressed when I heard she got up 
at four o'clock in the morning to start it. 
SS recalls seeing the guy stirring it at the apple festival. 
It spatters terribly in the kitchen if you do 
it 
indoors. 
They 
make seven bushels outside a couple of days before. 
GW: 
If I were going to do such a study I would feel terribly 
humble about talking to all 
the right people 
EW: I was very upset that nobody had bothered to come talk 
to Betty. 
She's a walking book. 
SS: We utilize a networking approach (etc.) 
EW: I was upset that you only had one picture of cranberry 
harvesting. I get cranberries from Arpens -- hand—picked -- a 
whole bushel full every year. 
Black red -- just absolutely 
delicious. 
BW: One of the problems is the white cranberry. 
It lowers 
the price. 
SS: You can't get fresh cranberries from the stands. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 116 
GW: The bias of most of the people 
in this room -- there's 
so many who would come 
in and exploit the barrens for their own 
profit -- over and over Betty runs into scams, like the man who 
was going to donate a snake preserve. 
Five thousand acres --It 
sounded wonderful, and yes he was 
a developer, and yes he was 
going to build a development down there of houses, but he was 
donating all 
this acreage for a snake preserve to preserve the 
indigenous wildlife. 
BW: 
But you can't put up signs telling the snakes to stay 
away from the houses 
--
GW: And the snakes were all 
by agreement going to go and 
live there -- when it came down to the bottom line 
it was a scam 
because the acreage was the right of way on the old railroad and 
the snakes should know that they should stay on this skinny 
little area. 
We hear it all 
the time and it's really not at all 
altruistic --
JR: What conclusions do you anticipate? 
MH: We have some more studying to do -- we may have to 
follow a certain activity or community or family through a whole 
year to get a seasonal reading. 
We'd like to get the names that 
local people have for a wide variety of resources --
EW: Do you have pictures of pixie moss? 
MH: We can get those from the wildlife biologists. 
JR: What does the commission want from this? 
MH: They want to know what mutual 
influence is there between 
their policies and the 
local culture -- for example, we've looked 
at two cedar operations -- one south of the Mullica River, and 
one 
in the Forked River Mountains --
BW: Are these harvesters who own the land or harvesters that 
move 
in and rent 
MH: Their families have been here for generations. 
BW: Oh, then you know about Bill Haines's stolen cedar 
MH: 
I've talked to Bill Haines, jr. about it. 
BW: Thirty acres. Cedar. Prime Cedar. 
JR: What it boils down to 
is that we don't agree with what 
you've gathered -- because what the Pinelands Commission does --
it still frightens me that what you're going to recommend things 
to them. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 117 
GW: What's the ethnobiologist doing? 
MH: He has degrees in biology and anthropology 
Side two 
MH: 
If I were going to do ethnobiology in this room I might 
start by asking everyone in this room to name five different weed 
-- what's a weed for one person is a useful plant for someone 
else -- we're interested 
in how people classify and use plants --
the seven different kinds of meat in a snapping turtle -- can you 
name them? 
Why do you bury a snapper's head when you out it off? 
Christmas trees as symbolic plants. 
JVI: I got a good story. 
An old piney friend of mine died 
about five years ago, he was 84 when he died. 
He told me a story 
that when he was maybe about 35, and of course being a piney 
he 
did the seasonal round, and snapping turtle was the meat of the 
spring and summer, they had gotten a thirty—five pounder and 
brought it back to the house and they went in to have some soup 
for lunch, and they had cut the head off -- put the turtle upside 
down -- the head was layin by the turtle out by the back door --
BW: and the turtle left 
JVI: Well over by the barn right behind the house was a dog 
chained to the barn. 
They're all 
in there having a good time 
talkin about what happened -- what they'd come up with for the 
day, the kind that got away, and the ones they got and so forth, 
and they heard the dog yipin and whinin, and they said "What ails 
that dog?" so they went out, and the dog's got the snapping 
turtle's head attached to his tongue and --
SS: 
(laughs) 
JVI: 
He said 
it was true -- and they were over there and 
they were tryin to pry this -- a thirty—five pounder, which is a 
pretty good size head if you've ever seen one-- so anyhow that 
was on the dog and they're trying to get the dog because it was a 
good dog -- a good hunter dog -- and they're trying to get the 
dog's tongue -- and they finally got the head off along with a 
bit of the dog's tongue -- I don't know what they cauterized it 
with or what -- so anyway I go back to the house again to get 
some of that -- and the dog gone turtle was gone. 
It had rolled 
itself over. They spent the rest of the day looking for it. 
So 
anyhow, finally the other old fellow was going down the road and 
a quarter of a mile down the road the turtle was ahead of him 
with the car, walking straight down the asphalt. 
No! that's true! And I wouldn't have believed it's true, but 
we did the same darn thing -- 
it didn't come and attack a dog, 
but the darn thing chased us, and we had 
it buried upside down 
in 
the ground and we didn't sleep good that night. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 118 
SS: Something to do with the automatic nervous system. 
JVI: By the time I heard it 
it was a joke, but he swore 
it 
was true. 
It's fascinating, 
if you're a city person it sounds 
pretty weird. 
Well. 
JVI: Have we got everybody? 
Is everybody happy? 
BW: I still don't feel that we exchanged ideas. 
For 
instance, down the road there was a sign that said, "Isn't it 
hell 
to take the wrong road?" 
I went back to take a picture and 
it was gone. 
But I wouldn't use that slide to represent the Pine 
Barrens. 
More mediating by JVI. 
GW: Could you put 
in one or two sentences how it 
is that you 
define folklife? 
JR: Copy down the way she defines folklife. 
JVI: Aren't we going around in circles? 
SS: We have been for the last half hour. 
BW: two paragraphs. 
MH: Basically -- The Pinelands National Reserve is defined 
as the larger area ringing the core area immortalized by McPhee. 
We are looking for a range of folklife that occurs throughout the 
Pinelands National Reserve, an area that goes from Fort Dix all 
the way down to Delaware Bay, West to Medford and Hammonton, East 
to Barnegat. 
The life of the people -- we assume that everybody 
participates in a folk culture that we might distinguish from 
elite and popular culture. 
We're basically interested in 
folklife as 
it relates to the natural 
resources and the 
landscapes. 
We're interested 
in the management of clamlots, salt 
marshes, cranberry bogs -- some people in the Pinelands make 
their livings working as reporters who write about these things. 
Others who slosh around in the bogs are not native pineys. 
The 
puerto ricans know the bottom of the bogs in a way that those who 
admire the cranberries on the surface don't know it. 
We want to 
notice the differences between the experiences of those who 
classify plants by morphology and those classify them by use.

quality tape) 
Dusia is speaking in Ukrainian with Joseph. 
She 
suggests we go to Fort Dix to find some mushrooms. 
G—Cassville; 
48GT. 
Joseph says the Ukrainian is closer to Polish than Russian, 
so though he doesn't understand everything, he's going to 
translate what he can. 
Her name is Eudokia Tserbotarew. 
(is Dusia a nickname?) We 
are driving to a nearby woods. 
She's talking to Joseph. He's 
Polish, from Pennsylvania -- his people from Warsaw. 
This place is 
no good (for mushrooms —she's looking for 
black earth?)--she came here fifty years ago from Kiev, 
in the 
Ukraine. 
How did she come to be here? 
The Germans were getting 
people together for work. 
We stop the cars and get out. 
We have to go to the oaks, 
not the pines. 
We're walking. 
I find one that she says is no 
good. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 120 
Joseph: It's getting dark, and she says the mushrooms may be 
finished because it's getting too cold. 
She finds a genus rissoula -- a (serovushka) -- that is 
good. 
We're still 
in Jackson Township. 
Rita: Where do they like to grow? 
We see an ammonita. 
(poisonous) 
She 
is plunging through the woods with authority and 
determination. 
We are hard—pressed to keep up with her. 
The one 
by her yard is her favorite -- Krashnuki -- (which means 
"beautiful" ) Yakikoro -- Boris finds one that she rejects. 
We 
laugh at his crestfallen face. 
She finds one she calls Pepanki 
-- 
in Polish, Potpinki -- 
in Latin, Armularia Mullea -- the honey 
mushroom. 
They grow on trees 
in groups, according to Joseph. 
(a break 
in the tape) 
Rita asks who 
is going to transcribe the tape. 
Boris laughs 
because Dusia says everything in Ukrainian and Joseph translates 
it 
into Polish, then Latin.

One pronounced serovieshka -- a rissoula -- it's a different 
color and shade than the first one. 
A long stretch where we're 
just walking and looking. The wind gets bad. 
She finds a 
jerovina. 
She makes jelly out of teaberries. 
The jelly 
is 
called

She puts potato flour in the jelly. 
Rita then 
discovers that Dusia makes cranberry jelly, but she thinks that 
the teaberry is 
like a dryland cranberry, because she 
is 
describing the harvesting process for cranberries. So 
it appears 
to be cranberry jelly that she makes, not teaberry jelly.

another one that Dusia says 
is "something."

TX02: 
An interview with 
the proprietress of the Copper Kettle, 
on route 571 
in G—Cassville; 48GT. 
People who move here from the cities immediately begin to 
think of paving and bringing in all 
the conveniences of the city. 
So our situation here seems to be environmentally disintegrating. 
Down the road, they're all Russian, but down here on Oak 
Avenue they're not -- there are quite a few who have come 
in from 
New York, from Staten Island and so forth. 
We still have a lot 
of Russians, who come to retire. 
The others commute to New York 
-- Lakewood is jammed with commuters who bus 
in. 
The feeling is 
more one of town than of country. 
Bingo, Bowling, Baby and Beer, 
the four Bs. Alliteration. 
I don't think that I could add more 
to that, because they haven't any more that I know of. 
The 
school system has a good art department. education, ethnicity, 
outsiders 
Boris: 
Does the school system teach anything about the 
culture of the area? 
?: 
I've come across a few teachers who have wanted to bring 
groups of school children here. 
They had some programs at ROVA 
to keep the kids off the streets. 
ROVA is very insular. 
It 
keeps the Russian idea intact. 
The historical society had been 
promised the (hapach?) a Russian dance -- they promised that and 
they promised other things Russian, and none of them 
materialized. 
And they called in Marolis (?) who 
is 83, a fine 
dancer -- he 
lives 
in Howell, actually. 
Even Howell and into 
Freehold Acres -- they were originally from ROVA but they 
separated. 
They've established Rodina -- in Lakewood, behind the 
Alexander Nyevsky Church, which is the Russian Orthodox church. 
There's another church 
in Howell -- the Church Vladimir -- 
is the 
church in exile, and it's not under the American Patriarch. 
Whereas this church, St. Mary's, 
is not under either one and 
they're having trouble. 
(Marusia). 
Alexander Nyevsky is also a 
church in exile. Rita: They chose deliberately to separate 
themselves from the church in Russia because they feel 
it 
is too 
tolerant of communism. religion 
The American Patriarchy is very much in contact with Moscow 
and they're very liberal. 
Most Russian congregations do not want 
the calendar changed. 
Vladimir has not changed its Christmas 
dates. 
It's approximately two weeks behind any American holiday 
of that nature. 
Rita: What are the most outstanding features of things that 
are done 
in the Russian community? 
The most significant is Vladimir's Day -- the last Sunday 
in 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 122 
July -- a time when they consecrate the waters, and the bishops 
appear, and there's a procession from the church to the lake. 
And then there are all kinds of people there with interesting 
things to sell 
and so on, and they have a program and a dance on 
Saturday night. 
Well attended, mostly Russian. (celebration) 
Rita: Can you identify things in their daily lives that are 
so familiar to them that they aren't even aware of them, but that 
you've noticed? 
christmas for example 
Well, Ukrainians for instance, they have a special custom of 
having straw under the table -- and they have all 
kinds of things 
to eat -- on Christmas day they just eat fish -- 12 kinds of fish 
I think 
it 
is -- and they of course are great church attenders. 
In Russia, 
it was fundamentally a place of gathering and 
friendships, renewing acquaintances as much as the religious 
idea. 
The Russian was always highly religious almost to a point 
of superstition. 
The things that carried over from paganism 
follow all 
of us of course to some degree. 
For instance they 
still fool around with Ivan Kupala -- a god or sprite of the 
pagan hierarchy who had something to do with the fire 
-- our 
Jack Jumped over the candlestick which we used to celebrate with 
bonfires -- and still do 
in some parts of Scotland and 
northwestern England 
and then they have all 
kind of traditions 
as we just mentioned a while ago, the Baba Yaga and the skaski --
the older people tell stories to the youngsters. And they are 
great also 
in cookery. 
Varenieki, Palmeni -- Palmeni 
is a 
Siberian dish. Verenieki are similar to raviolis -- they're made 
of dough and filled with either cheese or onions or liver or meat 
of any kind, and they're boiled -- usually having been fried with 
butter in onions. 
Joseph: Like the Polish pierogi -- are they half—moon shaped 
Yes 
Joseph: They make like a circle and fill 
it and roll 
it over 
and punch down the edges with a fork 
Palmeni 
is a little dumpling filled with meat. 
MH: How is the Pinelands National Reserve going to affect 
Russian culture around here? 
I don't think Russians are going to do any damage to 
it, 
because they're country people. 
They are close to nature and if 
they know what the agency 
is after they'll cooperate. 
I know of 
no Russian who 
is going to tear out the woods or kill animals 
very few of them are hunters. 
Those who hunted 
in Russia did so 
out of necessity. 
Those who hunted for sport were members of the 
upper classes. 
land management 
By and large Russians are very very Russian. 
All I have to 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 123 
do 
is say "a damned Russian" and I bring the whole thing down on 
my head. 
They're anti—communist. 
Most are for Mother Russia. 
They still sing the old songs and they still play the old music 
and tell 
the old stories. 
There's one whose name 
is Marina Federoff -- and she teaches 
school 
in Lakewood. 
She lives on Alexander Avenue in Howell. 
And she teaches in a private school -- Russian, French, Spanish 
and so forth. 
She probably knows more than I know. 
She's very 
competent. 
She's Father Konstantin's sister—in—law. 
She works 
at the Silver Bell Diner in the evenings. 
She was let go at the 
Regent for reading a book. 
It's the national vice. 
Boris: It's terrible. You start reading one book and you 
can't stop. 
She describes the house to us. 
It was her home with her 
husband who was Russian. 
She 
is English. 
She has all kinds of 
antiques collected. 
ROVA was originally a farm. They had cows, chickens, etc. 
ROVA could really do something. 
There have been four or five 
centers that sprung out of the idea of ROVA -- there's RODINA, 
ATRADA, 
SOUSIVKA, -- (sp?) 
-- in New York and North Jersey. 
Presumably well—run. 
One 
is Ukrainian, the other is Byelorus, 
the other is sort of 
left—wingish. 
Then there's the very 
beautiful monastery which is up in New York in Jordanville. 
Very 
lovely thing. 
There aren't enough booklets about people who live 
within the Pinelands -- I don't think they'd want to know much 
about the Russians. 
They're all 
so 
insular, and they're not so 
culturally motivated. 
MH: Have you ever talked to someone you would think of as a 
Piney? 
Essentially no. 
MH: What's your idea of what a Piney is 
like? 
I did read McGee's book -- I loaned it to our fire 
commissioner and never got it back. 
But anyway, you can't pick 
people out and say what they are and aren't in that sense. The 
best I can do 
is Batsto, and even that's not Piney. 
It was 
originally founded as an 
iron foundry -- and he wasn't even local 
-- he was from Philadelphia, wasn't he? 
However, 
it 
is part of 
the barrens. 
I'm interested in the preservation of the forest. 
The Russians don't know anything about it, I don't think. 
They don't get pamphlets or anything. 
You can't put up a storage 
area, a fence, you can't do this or that without eleven permits, 
and I think everyone resents that -- the tree commission doesn't 
Hufford--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 124 
enforce the regulations about cutting trees --
The Russians don't want to cut trees, but they're crying out 
about all 
the permits. Now the Pine Barrens moratorium doesn't 
strike me as a bureaucratic idea -- 
if I had my way there 
wouldn't even be people traipsing through them. 
It is not the 
best of all possible worlds, no question about that. 
I have a potbelly stove -- I burn coal, not wood. 
I burn 
leaves for kindling. 
I see logs piled up all over the place, 
though, and you know where they're coming from. 
She's an artist.

re: professional butchers for the deer that they just got 
and 
is hanging, dressed, 
in a cage outside of the Harmony Gun 
Club in G—Chatsworth, 27GT. 
Larry Carpenter is the vice—president 
of the Harmony Gun Club. 
The members are from Woodbury, 
Paulsbury (?), Clarksburg, Rickleton, Haddon Heights, 
Haddonfield, 
Medford, Belmar, Pennsauken, and Chatsworth. 
They 
all 
know each other as men who work together or are related. 
Present membership numbers 48. 
It's one of the oldest gun clubs 
going. 
William Durst, Sr. and his three sons, with a few cousins 
and nephews, and some other men from Clarksboro, started the club 
in 
1933. 
In 1935 they bought a piece of ground right here. 
In 
1939 the main section of the building was put up -- 
originally 
it was part of the DuPont Hospital 
in Gibbstown. 
When they built 
the new one they added some panelling and 8 rooms. 
They can 
handle 50 men. 
It's an open club. 
Wedding receptions, family reunions, 
birthday parties are all 
held here. 
All members have keys to the 
club. They come up on weekends to fish sometimes -- for a type of 
pike, or maybe a few bass. 
There's only one lake -- Oswego. The 
rest is 
all cranberry reservoirs and swamps. 
A fellow named Carl Brikner, Sr. talks about the method of 
flooding cranberries in the winter, 
from the reservoirs. 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 126 
A typical deer season. It's a lot of work for the ones that 
do the work and a lot of fun for everybody. 
They purchase the 
food and have it delivered by truck. 
They have quite a few union 
men, some of whom belong to the same local. 
They have 
truckdrivers, a doctor, 
pipefitters, mechanics, steelworkers, 
ironworkers -- Richie Allen was an ironworker, and so was Georgie 
Allen. 
There are electricians. 
Most of them work for someone. 
A number are retired. 
Larry's nickname is "Carp" for carpenter. 
Ceremonies: 
You get your shirt tail cut off 
if you shoot at 
a deer and miss 
it -- years ago if you missed a deer, when you'd 
get back to the club they'd take an old pot and cut the bottom 
out of it and stick it down over your ears (shades of the old 
stocks) -- other than that you now have to pay five dollars --
whatever expenses are, we all 
chip in. 
Typical day: 
Average time gettin up would be about 5. Get 
out in the woods about 6:30. 
See how tired you can make yourself 
-- half of the healthy men will stand, plus the old men, and the 
other half of the healthy men will drive, and 
in the next piece 
of woods they'll reverse. 
The woodscaptain has a woodschedule 
figured out ahead of time. 
There's more or 
less like a silent 
agreement between clubs: 
you don't push onto us and we won't 
push onto you. 
Carl 
is the Woods General --
Carl: We have certain sections of woods we take so many men 
to drive and so many men to stand it, 
and we put the standers out 
and we push the deer to 
'em, hollerin and screamin --
Everybody brings his own gun. 
There are pump guns, 
automatic guns, double barrelled guns, over and under double 
barrelled guns -- this club has outlawed slugs. 
New Jersey 
allows slugs, but because this club hunts too close, they've 
outlawed them. 
We use buckshot, which is fine pellets like this here. 
That's got 22 pellets in 
it. 
The slug has got one ounce of 
lead 
in 
it. 
There are seven—eighths, an ounce and a quarter, and one 
ounce. 
But we don't allow the slugs in the club because they 
travel too far. 
This is a three inch magnum, that's got 22 
pellets 
in 
it. 
MH: How do you keep 
in practice is this 
is only a once a 
year thing? 
Carl: Some of the men go to turkey shoots. 
Others go for 
small game: rabbits, squirrels. 
There's two or three that I know 
that go duck hunting -- well this all 
helps 
in getting loosened 
up, 
used to the gun, get the feel of 
it again. 
Then you got 
maybe ten — fifteen percent of the men, they won't touch a gun 
again from the time they leave here this year until the time they 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 127 
arrive again next year. 
They can still be good enough to pull 
the trigger. 
MH: What's the most challenging game to hunt? 
Carl: Deer. 
They're large, they have more sense of what to 
do 
if they're in danger, whereas smaller game, all 
they got the 
idea to do 
is 
if they hear a noise, get up and get out. 
But deer 
-- he'll try to get around you, behind you, or if he's somewhere 
near there away from you somehow. It just seems like they got 
that extra little bit of knowledge there that the small game 
doesn't have. 
They got three deer this year, which is better than they 
generally do. 
Woodbridge usually gets 20 and they got 2 this 
year. 
They don't have enough data to analyze that situation --
they don't know enough about the population this year. 
Carp: You see a lot of does a lot of times and you can't 
find a buck in 
'em. 
They don't shoot does. 
A lot of pothunters will shoot does 
and then look. 
If you shoot a doe 
in this club, you're out the 
door. 
"No outlaws here. 
Once 
in a while there's a mistake made. 
Somebody shoots at a buck and a doe gets 
in the way. 
In forty 
years I think it's only happened twice. 
One time a man got a 
buck and a doe 
in one shot. 
The way he shot at the buck the doe 
got it too. 
The guide 
is generally hired, according to what the club 
would want, or the woods general would want. 
If we had you this 
year to guide us because you live here, and you want to make a 
couple bucks, and you go out and say, "Here's where you can go." 
Maybe the fellows aren't satisfied with what you did -- we say, 
well, we only killed one deer this year -- next year we'll get 
another person. 
They're supposed to be somebody that knows where 
to take you to get the deer. 
Carl: I looked the woods over during bow and arrow season. 
I checked the woods and where the deer were wandering and which 
way they were movin. I spent five Saturdays out of six up here 
and --
MH: 
Is 
it different every year? 
Carl: Oh yeah, they run different directions -- they have 
different areas the feed grows in -- where it grows in one year 
it might not grow next year. 
This year Apple Pie Hill was the really hot spot. 
The deer 
were there. 
Of course, I believe there were some individuals 
feedin out there -- corn, cabbage, sweet potatoes, apples, all 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 128 
kinda stuff. 
Bow huntin mostly, but they're still 
in that area 
because of the feed. 
A couple of guys leave to go hunting. 
They'll see Brick at 
the January meeting. 
Larry: 
Last year it was really hot about four or five miles 
away, down by 72. 
That's why we have the guide idea. 
Carl hunts 
in Maine as well 
as New Jersey. 
Maine 
is 
altogether different. 
You hunt by yourself. 
They "still" hunt 
-- they don't walk or drive. 
New Jersey seems to be the most 
concentrated area for deer hunting that they know of. 
They have lots of questions about the National Reserve --
they want to know how much it's going to cost them to use the 
area. 
Carl thinks that it shouldn't cost the local people 
(themselves included) more money to 
live there -- but the taxes 
have gone up. 
Both hunters and environmentalists, he says, 
benefit from the arrangement. 
Carl . They're hollerin about people in this locality, 
in 
this pine barrens, building houses, because of the sewerage 
runnin into the water table -- what do they call this water table 
here? 
MH: The Cohansey aquifer? 
Carl: 
No this isnt the Cohansey aquifire --
Someone else: 
The Raritan actifire -- they don't want the 
buildings but they're promotin the canoes and all 
this other 
stuff for people to come here. 
They holler about preserving the 
Pine Barrens, well they oughta come up here and see what people 
are doing with the canoe trails. 
The whole canoe trail 
is nothin 
but beer bottles and beer cans and piles of shit, and -- so what 
is 
the difference if a man builds a house and has a cesspool or 
that you have these canoes doin the same thing and worse? 
They're doin it right in the streams. 
That's where our main 
bitch is. 
They think the canoes are great: preserve the Pine 
Barrens for the canoers. 
(etc. etc.) 
They think we're pollutin the actifire, what do they think 
they're doin? 
If you build a house here you have to have a toilet that 
burns it up. A $2,000 electric bill to burn the sewerage up. 
MH: Do you guys generally know at the end of the season how 
well the other clubs have done? 
Larry: Well 
it's really the general stores in the different 
areas -- they'll have a total board up there with all 
the clubs 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 129 
names. 
They want me to know there's pride in having the safest 
club. 
General kidding around as I take some pictures of the guys. 
Licenses they have to have: trapping, fishing, hunting --

Sewell, New Jersey 08080 
MH explains what the project is about. 
Deer clubs are 
important says one hunter, because "the Pinelands are supported 
by the hunters...If I can spend a hundred dollars on a license, 
and the other person can mouth off and don't spend a dime, I 
think the hunter has more -- why can't everybody else spend a 
hundred dollars. " 
The canoe rental people pay for licenses, but when it comes 
time for cleaning the woods -- 
if 
you could come in here for a 
week and see the trash the clubs pick up and throw in these 
trucks -- these trucks are donated by the members of the trucks. 
We pick trash up everyday. 
Just in the course of hunting, you 
pick up a trash bag full of trash everyday. 
And then you come up 
here -- it's a sport for us -- it's an old sport, 
it's a 
tradition -- this club started 
in 
'33 and in 
'35 we worked on 
getting this piece of ground, and 
in 
'38 we were able to work out 
the deal with DuPont to get this hospital here, 
and 
in 
'39 they 
started to put it up. 
(that was Carl?) 
Larry Carpenter, Jr.: 
And it's a comradeship that goes way 
back. 
If you 
look at the t.v. and see the old civil war or the 
movies on tv about history -- how many times did they get 
together on an evening to have a social dance, and 
it didn't 
matter whether you were British or English, you went out and you 
danced for a night. 
We have thirty people here, and from all 
walks of 
life, and all 
trades of 
life. 
In that one week you put 
all 
that aside and come out and you do what your forefathers did 
-- you go out and you hunt the game and you walk the land. 
You 
see life as 
it was back then. 
We all 
live 
in areas where it's 
all 
build up 
into a city. You don't have this where we live no 
more -- we have farms that are gone -- they're sold -- people 
just couldn't keep 'em up. 
Whatever the case may have been, 
they're gone. 
But you have this. 
And then all 
of a sudden, you 
have, 
like you say, a couple of these acts -- you know, you try 
to keep a tradition up, 
of -- I don't know what else you could 
call 
it, 
and 
it really makes you feel bad sometimes when you come 
up here and you see what's goin on and nobody comes down here to 
look at 
it, or up here from Washington or anywhere's else. 
He's Larry Carpenter, Sr.'s son, "and my son was up here 
too. That's three generations alone, Carl Britner the woods 
Hufford--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 130 
general, his son's up here, Larry Britner, his brother's here, 
this 
is a tradition of generations, not just one family here 
another family there -- you know this thing's goin on for years 
and years. 
It's family oriented -- it's cousins, nephews, this 
is somethin that went on way before that. 
You're from the 
Library of Congress, 
it's great you're here, and we're here, but 
a lot of clubs 
is closed. 
(another guy) We have a saying here. 
Take your boy hunting, 
instead of hunting your boy. 
We used to have stickers to put on the trucks. (see 
corresponding CLOG) The cook 
is 
listed on the lower right hand 
side of the menu, which is also being photographed. 
Larry C. jr. 
But it's a tradition. 
You can't put time on 
it. 
You can't decide what happened fifty years ago, or a hundred 
years ago, but we still enjoy comin' out and for that one week 
puttin' everything aside and doin' 
like 
it was that many years 
ago. 
It's like American Heritage. 
We take time off of work to 
come up and put in the time. 
We hunt, we keep the population under control. Everything we 
take, we use. 
It's just like what happened in the 18th century. 
(somebody) The Pilgrims. 
Larry: What you kill, you eat. 
MH asks for a story about a good deer drive. 
There's a place they call Carpenter's Swimming Hole, because 
Larry Sr. fell 
into 
it. 
Women are starting to take up hunting now. 
They can't join 
the clubs, but one man gave up his week with the fellows to take 
his daughter hunting. 
MH goes out to take picture of the bumper sticker. 
We're 
all 
outside now. 
They have a flag that goes up every day. 
The mayor is 
responsible for it. 
They do 
it during the season. "Just the 
pride of being here 
in America, you know." 
They ask MH if she has a license to do all that shooting. 
One of their members owns the Woodshed on Route 72. 
Alfie 
and Vinnie Hendrix. 
Brothers. 
Local people who belong to the 
club. 
They assemble for a portrait.

One of the Brickners (?) Well, we better get on our way, 
because we won't get home 
in time to buy our license. 
The other one: 
We gotta get a license for bow and arrow, 
for next week, and for 
MH: for marrying your girlfriend!

TXO1: 
April 
11, 1985, Hufford and Moonsammy interviewing Herb 
Misner. 
His daughter and her husband are present, and gradually 
get involved in the interview, which begins with a tour of his 
back yard before moving into his house. Rita asks him about 
knitting the nets. 
He 
is showing a trap with steel mesh, which 
he doesn't need to use stakes with. 
The stakes keep the twine 
nets stretched out. 
He's been making them for 40 years. 
He says 
he sent away for a needle and directions from a company in Ohio 
that supplies ail kinds of fish net makers. 
Bob Beebe used to make them from around her, (?) Jennings Butler 
He sets the traps in big lakes, cricks, irrigation holes around 
farms. 
Just go ask them. 
They like to keep the turtle population 
down: 
"They'll clean out of those fish, wild ducks --little ducks -- plop 
'em over like fishing corks." 
MH: 
Do people actually feel for snapping turtles with their feet? 
HM: 
Yeah, I've done it--prog for 'em with a stick ... You give im a 
little push, and he always moves forward, he won't come back--so 
you know which end to just reach down for his tail. 
Hang on!.. 
Keep his belly towards, you, 
like. (to keep from getting bitten). 
They can bite you. 
I've had 
'em bite me. 
MH mentions Tom Brown who traps on the meadows. 
HM: 
They call 
it proggin' 
'em. 
If he had a boom down, keep pokin 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 133 
--sounds different when you hit one's back, just step your foot 
down on 
im, give im a couple of pushes to see which way he's 
goin' to move. 
RM: 
And then just grab the tail? 
HM: 
Yeah. 
RM: 
How about usin' a string with some bait on 
it? 
HM: 
If they're down 
in that mud they won't. 
They can use 
chokers to catch 'em. a little round stick about as long as a 
knife handle, pointed on both ends, cut a groove around the 
middle of 
it, 
tie a long string around it--(tie meat to 
it and 
he'll swallow it and 
it sticks crossways) 
--a bridle: 
Get a piece of cord or a piece of wire and stick 
it 
in his mouth when he opens it and bring it all 
the way around 
on the edge of his shell and over the top of his tail, pull 
it 
tight and 
(he can't get out of it)--If you wanna carry im far 
and you got no bag. 
Don't need a license. 
There's plenty of them. 
They don't come 
under fish and game. 
Signs of snappers: 
If you're out in the woods and you come 
across some sandy dams, you see where they cross the sand, one 
paw in the other, or sit there with binoculars and watch for a 
while. 
RM: 
What do their tracks look like? 
HM: 
Toenails, and their tail always drags behind 'em 
in the 
sand -- makes 'em long. 
RM: 
How do trappers negotiate for territory? 
HM: 
There's not too many of 
'em around now. 
Not many of 
'em 
are using nets. 
Not too many have the time. 
50 cents a pound 
for them. 
He's seen them over fifty pounds. 
Got two last summer, one 
weighed 46 and one weighed 48 pounds. 
He delivers them live 
only once 
in a while he takes them out of the shell, 
if somebody's 
having a snapper soup party. 
He's eaten plenty of them. 
Re: 
snapper soup parties -- there aren't many around now, 
but occasionally people have them. 
We take our to the Philly 
fish market. 
The Old English Tavern in Pennsauken bought 500 
pounds of 
it recently. 
HM: 
A lot of snapper soup and a lot of beer, sit out under a 
tree 
in the summer time. (Laughs) a picnic. 
He works about a dozen traps during the season. 
Doesn't set 
them everyday. 
"You might leave one out for four or five days. 
The bait can last. 
Snapper soup: 
Cook 
it til 
it falls off the bone. 
Drain the 
juice off, and save 
it. 
Then you cook potatoes, onions, a 
pound of butter, seasoning, 
BG: 
And mom always used hard boiled eggs. 
HM: 
2 dozen hard boiled eggs cut up 
in 
it. 
After you take 
all 
that meat off the bone..three kinds of spices--poultry 
seasonin--but you don't dump the spice right in 
it -- put it 
in a cloth bag, tie a string around it, 
and hang it in the pot, 
and when you've had enough seasoning, take the seasoning bag on 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 134 
out. 
You don't have all 
the spices floating around in 
it. 
Don't use tomatoes. 
Some people do. 
Some people put celery 
in 
it too 
Once 
in a while he saves the big shells, and people paint them 
or something. 
Trapping in the meadows: 
In the meadows you gotta weight'em 
down--and wait til 
the tide goes out, go up them ditches in the 
muskrat holes--you gotta gloat'em and take some of them white 
milk jugs, tie 
it on the sides. 
Kinds of meat on a snapper: 
They claim there's seven different 
kinds-- chicken, veal, all kinds -- the while meat is 
like 
chicken, veal--some people add veal 
to 
'em when they're 
too cheap to buy enough snapper to put 
in that pot, they mix 
veal 
in with'em. 
Uses a knife to get the meat out of the back of the shell. 
RE: 
intelligence of snappers. 
Sometimes you have to 
outsmart them. 
you get one 
in and he tears out, you ain't 
gonna get im 
in no more that summer. 
He won't go back 
in there. 
MH: 
He might the next summer? 
HM: 
He might. 
RM: 
But how do you know one from the other? 
HM: 
You can tell 
by the different sizes of 
'em, 
if you're used 
to seein' their heads above the water. 
RM: 
So 
in any one area there won't be a whole lot of them? 
HM: 
We caught 185 outa that one lake, Fisher's Dam--How'd 
you like to go swimmin' there? 
I guess we caught 30 weighed 
forty pounds a piece. 
MH: 
Do they go after swimmers? 
HM: 
No, they're just about as scared of you as you are of them. 
MH: 
Are there any famous snapping turtles? 
HM: 
There's a lot of big snappers around--there's one 
in 
that lake yet we never did get im 
in a net. 
RM: 
How bit is he? 
HM: 
He's a big one. 
RM: 
How can you tell? 
HM: 
Seen im, 
two or three times--he's almost 50 pounds. 
RM: 
Does 
it make a difference where you put the trap? 
HM: 
Yeah, see the wind blowin' that way? 
You gotta set it 
on that side of the lake (indiscernible) 
RM: 
If 
it's been sittin' 
in one spot for a while will the 
snappers learn to avoid it? 
HM: 
There ain't none there if there ain't nothin' 
in the 
net for two or three days. 
If 
it's been sittin' that long, 
I'm 
gonna move 
it anyhow--Harrisville, Country Lakes, Marlton, 
Pennsauken--
He caught several 
in Cherry Hill 
last year. 
MH: 
What do you use for bait? 
HM: 
Mackerel, soybeans, fish--
He has a whole can 
in the net--if he punctures it the oil 
attracts 
them--
RM: 
How do you get 'em out of here? 
He demonstrates, (By opening the pursed end) 
Four in one net, and I couldn't get it 
in the boat. 
A

hundred and eighty pound 
in one net. 
Caught 519 pounds in four 
days. 
The season 
is from May to September. 
He also traps coons, 
muskrats, mink. 
RM: 
What's the hardest to trap? 
HM? 
Mink. 
Mr. Mink. 
He's about the wisest one there is. 
Fox 
is hard to catch too, you can't touch nothin' with your hands 
with fox. 
He has rabbits caged 
in back, which he sells once 
in a while. 
He shows us a live tap, where he had a coon. He made the trap. 
Has about twenty of them. 
Catches skunk, possum, birds (which 
he releases). 
Has to use steel traps for fox, 
illegal 
in Burlington 
County. 
You can't catch a fox without a steel trap--maybe with 
a snooz. 
Piece of thin wire 
Tricks to use with fox: 
Get sand, bake it 
in the oven so 
it won't freeze, put wax paper--
then you dig a hole with a grass punch or somethin', then you 
bury your bait in the hole, and he'll walk up there and get that. 
We're looking at the rabbits. 
He says not to touch them 
because the mother will come up and eat their heads off. He 
bought them at Harker's auction in Tabernacle. 
RM: 
How do you outsmart the mink? 
HM: 
Bait 'em, use scent. 
He buys the scent. 
He doesn't mix together smells, because 
"It already comes mixed..you got (fox 
in the pen?) you gonna 
set it under there until he pees 
in the bottle for you? 
(Laughing) 
MH: 
What's a flying set? 
HM: 
That's a snare ain't it? 
You got a snare or snooz, and 
bend a small bush or tree over, and you have one drove 
in the 
ground with a notch on 
it 
When he get he gets that snare 
around his neck, he gives a lurch, jerks it off, and that 
flings him up 
in the air. 
They catch deer that way too. 
He uses a steel trap--but can only do 
it 
in Ocean County 
where steel traps are legal. 
He subscribes to a trappers' 
magazine. 
He says he doesn't have to skin them anymore. 
Sells them by the pound. 
Says 
they "sell all the coon 
meat to the colored people." 
They eat muskrats too. 
"That's what they call marsh rabbits." 
RM: 
How about eels? 
HM: 
I caught a lot of eel. 
Uses catfish for bait. 
People dig for them at night with a 
light. 
Illegal. 
You're supposed to catch them on your fishing 
line. 
He's never used eel pots. 
Snappers are not pests apart from eating ducks. 
"There's very 
few around here, snapper hunts, no more." 
He's made nets for people who want to get started snappering. 
HM: 
How'd you find me? 
We tell him we learned of him from Dennis McDonald, who told 
us to go to the Evergreen Dairy Bar. 
We move into his house, to look at his netmaking operation. 
He shows us the gauges. "You can make 'em any size you want." 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 136 
His daughter points out that that is the same book that has 
instructions for making a hammock. 
RM: 
(to Betty) Did you ever go out with your father when you 
were a kid? 
BG: 
We used to go up along the cranberry bogs, my mother and 
us, on a Sunday, for a ride. 
MH: 
How many children? 
BG: 
There's five of us. 
I'm the oldest, with four brothers. 
The youngest one's 18. 
He was thirteen when my mother died. 
RM: 
Does he do any trapping? 
BG: 
He goes deerhunting, rabbit hunting with my father. 
All 
my brothers gun. 
One of 
'em used to trap, he doesn't any more. 
I used to help him kill 
'em, the coon. 
I'd help my mother pick 
the meat apart. That I miss. 
We are in Medford. 
Where she grew up. 
BG: 
We moved here when I was five. 
We rented a tenant house. 
The original farm house was across the street. 
Her daughter 
is a year older than her brother. 
(Overlapping conversations 
here.) 
He 
loses traps to theft from trappers and tourists alike. 
There's no way to stop it. 
You may be out all 
day when you're settin' 
'em til 
you get 
'em all 
set, then be back the next morning about daylight--I've 
had 
'em tear right out of the wire nets, when you get real big 
one 
in there. 
RM: 
How long can you keep the snappers here til 
you sell 
'em? 
HM: 
I can keep 'em quite a while if I take 'em to the bathtub 
and fill 
it up with water and put a wire screen over 'em. 
RM: 
Do they get mad? 
HM: 
They're mad all 
the time. (laughs) You get 'em out of the 
water you can't hardly touch 'em, you better watch where you're 
touchin' 
'em--he'll get ya. 
RM: 
How do you handle 'em? 
HM: 
I dump 'em out on the ground, then pick 'em up by the tail 
--go around 'em til 
you get a tail, or step your foot on his 
back . They'll come out around after you if you try to reach 
down and get em, but you stick one foot on his back, keep em 
turned to you, his tail--never turn his back towards your 
leg. 
Always show his belly toward your leg. 
If he's got his back 
toward your leg, they can bite up. 
MH: 
So you really have to hold them out--
HM: 
Not too far if you keep his stomach toward your leg. 
Never 
had one yet bite under. 
Always got his head up. 
One time he was 
carrying one 
in a bag with a hole 
in 
it. 
HM: 
He bit me right through the bag. 
I reached down and, wasn't 
even thinking--I reached down and stuck my finger right in his 
mouth. 
He split his fingernail from that. 
Another took a chunk out of 
his son's leg, through a bag. 
HM: 
There's a real, right on the end of their mouth, a real 
sharp, needle sharp, bill, 
like. 
MH: 
What about burying the head? 
HM: 
They can bite you after you cut their head off. Their head 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 137 
will stay alive a long time after you cut it off. 
Their mouth 
will 
be open, but don't touch anywhere near that mouth, he's 
gonna get ya. 
MH: 
Have you heard of whomper snakes? 
HM: 
Not around here--adders, black snakes, king snakes,pine 
snakes, rattlesnakes. 
He went on a rattlesnake hunt in Oklahoma. Every morning, 
you'd get hamhocks, eggs, biscuits--sign in, 
and every 
evening,sign out. 
They wanted them live 
in bags--a ten 
mile square area. 
He saw 800 of them in pits. 
They skin 'em, 
clean 'em, sell 
the meat...They ship 'em somewhere for the 
venom. 
RM: 
Why did you go down there for that? 
HM: 
I don't know, I always wanted to go. 
I was down Texas, 
stopped a week in Oklahoma..Had a long handle with a claw on 
the end of 
it. 
Get im on his back and just squeeze the handle 
up on top. 
RM: 
There are rattlers around here? 
HM: 
Yeah, they turn out a lot. 
Up on the other side of 72 
the re . 
BG: 
Cause they were extinct almost, weren't they, Dad? 
HM: 
It's a $50 fine to kill one of them. 
They got em down 
Atco, Friendship, Hog Wallow.. 
MH: 
Have you kept any pet rattlesnakes? 
HM: 
I don't need no pet rattlesnake. 
MH: 
A guy over by Mount Misery has one. 
HM: 
Yeah, but they gotta pull the teeth out of em. 
But 
they will grow back 
in a rattlesnake. 
RM: 
Are there many mink left around here? 
HM: 
There's quite a few, 
in these swamps, around these 
cricks, 
in through these swamps. 
The place 
is gettin' overrun 
with fox. 
RM: 
Why 
is that? 
HM: 
There's so many of 
'em. 
Ain't gonna be no rabbits, quail 
or pheasants. 
MH: 
Gray or red? 
HM: 
Gray, and red's gettin plentiful too. 
RM: 
Because you're not allowed to trap 'em as much? 
HM: 
I guess. 
The foxhunters bring a lot in and turn 'em loose 
too, 
run their dogs with. 
Turn a lot of bobcats loose too, up 
around Four Mill. 
MH: 
Have you seen any? 
HM: 
I haven't, but I know guys coonhuntin. 
MH: 
How do you tell the difference between red and gray fox 
tracks? 
HM: 
Red fox 
is a lot bigger than the gray fox—There's no 
easy way to catch 'em now without leg traps. 
Run 'em with 
dogs or shoot 'em, I guess. 
RM: 
Much fishing around here? 
(No, people go to the shore 
for that.) 
RM:: Down around Mauricetown some of the people call them— 
selves mudwallopers, do you ever hear the name mudwalloper 
for somebody that traps in the meadows? 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 138 
HM: 
You mean mudwallowers, don't you? 
RM: 
Mudwallopers. 
Do you use that tern or 
is that just 
something they use down there? 
HM: 
Down there. 
In the spring when that grass gets about 
that high, the tide goes all 
the way out, they can follow 
the tracks and see where they go 
in the muskrat holes. 
RM: 
How about proggers, you every hear anyone callin 
himself a progger? 
HM: 
Yeah. 
That's all 
they do around here, proggin. 
BG: 
I used to 
like to help him when he would kill them, 
and get a big pot out there with a big fire, to scald them. 
The outer shell 
is black, but it peels off, 
like you would peel 
a nail off, the top part of the shell--actually, 
if you were 
takin' a thick layer of nail polish off you nails, how it comes 
off--in sections, the design in the snapper's back--underneath, 
where the skin part is, 
the four legs, and their tail, and the 
neck, that part peels off, and it's snow white underneath, even 
the shell 
is pure white underneath. 
HM: 
You scald'em in boiling water? 
RM? 
You cut the head off of the live turtle? 
Sounds pretty 
dangerous to me. 
BG: 
You put a stick 
in 
its mouth. 
HM: 
You cut his head off, scald him. (uses a butcher knife) 
clean 'em, cut im open; and his heart's still beatin'. 
MH: 
They're really tough, aren't they? 
HM: 
You can clean all 
his insides out, and 
lay his heart in 
your hand and it's still pumpin'. 
RM: 
That's gross. 
HM: 
They say 
if you swallow a snapper's heart, you'll never 
be ascared, while it's still beatin. 
That's what they used 
to tell 
the kids, them old—timers. 
(BG simultaneously) 
You know hwat else 
is 
interesting, when 
the females, you get them before they lay their eggs, the eggs 
are interesting--it's not like an egg shell. 
It's rubbery. 
The snapper almost looks prehistoric. 
One time when we were 
comin' from the shore, and this car happened to go by, 
as we 
stopped, and when I got out to catch it, 
these two guys hollered 
out: 
"Leave that alone! 
It's an endangered specie!" 
I don't 
know who they were. 
They were hopin' we would leave 
it so they 
could come back and get it. 
It was a nice sized one. 
HM: 
Soon as they hatch out of the eggs they'll want to bit ya. 
BG: 
It 
is true, Dad, that if 
you make snapper soup and you 
don't freeze it, 
if you just have 
it in the fridgerator, or 
it sittin' on the stove, 
it'll 
spoil 
in a thunder and lightnin' 
storm. 
It goes bad. 
I have always heard this. 
HM: 
It starts to bubble, 
like. 
BG: 
Like it's curdled. 
My mother, 
if we were having a 
snapper soup party, and 
if 
it looked like rain, you had to 
hurry up and get it packed away. 
RM: 
What if 
you wanted to eat it? 
Eat fast. 
HM: 
Well, you'd pick out a day when you didn't think there 
would be a thunderstorm. 
The only way you can keep it after 
it's cooked is put it in the freezer and freeze 
it. 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 139 
BG: 
And I don't like it that way. 
After it's been frozen 
the potatoes get funny. 
HM: 
You can put it 
in the frigerator and a thundershower'II 
come up and it'll 
be spoiled an hour afterwards. 
BG: 
A lot of people laughed at me--his family's from South 
Philadelphia (her husband) and when we were talkin' about it, 
because his father loved--in fact he used to go to a country 
bar, the guy used to make it and sell 
it, and he used to get 
a dinner there for Uncle Mik and Aunt Louise. 
While MH goes to get more tape and Rita explains more about 
what we're doing. 
BG recalls the project when it was 
in New 
Lisbon, and how Christine was killed there--"across from where 
Donald worked." 
BG: 
They had a nice folk festival up at Chatsworth last summer 
Dad. 
They old hotel--to raise money--where that prince was 
supposed to have lived--before you get to the Hedger house. 
They're restoring it. 
They've got a new roof on 
it 
They 
had a country fair and they raised a lot of money.

The nylon nets will 
last several years. 
He has made them 
with wooden hoops, of split white oak. 
Couldn't use weeping 
willows or birch, the latter would rot. 
HM: 
The white oak seems to 
last longer than any of 'em. 
The old 
timers when they made em out of their chop line, they would 
shrink--they'd have to take 'em out every couple of days and 
dry em. 
These you set em 
in the water and (indiscernible). 
RM: 
How long does it take you to knit one of these? 
HM: 
Sit here after supper about one night. 
RM: 
That would take a lot longer. 
HM: 
Oh, yeah. 
(more on the knitting) 
RM: 
Couldn't the snappers bite through that pretty easily? 
HM: 
They don't seem to. 
I've seen them bite through the 
wire ones. 
RM: 
Are they considered a dumb animal? 
HM: 
You get one 
in the net this summer, you won't get im 
in 
the net no more that summer. 
You can put all 
the bait you want 
to 
in there, you ain't gonna get im back 
in there. 
RM: 
Are they smart at getting at people? 
LG: 
They're the slowest thing moving--and the fastest 
thing to get away from you. 
When I help him to put two or 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 141 
three out, he dumps em out and holds em there, 
if you blink 
you eye, they just disappear. 
They have one speed, but that 
speed 
is enough. 
HM: 
Coon destroy five or six times as many snappers as 
anybody catchin' em. 
They'll get snappers. 
Snappers come out 
and lay their eggs, and dig down 
in the sand on the dams, and 
the coon come along that night and dig that nest of eggs out. 
Some mornings you go down the dam and see where the coons dug out 
five or six nests like that, different coons. 
RM: 
What's the nest look like? 
HM: 
They just dig a hole, 'bout that big around, down 
in the sand 
about that deep. 
She backs right over that hole and lays all 
her eggs 
in 
it--I've watched em laying them a lot of times. And 
when she gets done, she'll take her tail, fill that hole in, and 
smooth it over. 
RM: 
And then how long til they hatch, does she come back and 
take care of them? 
HM: 
No, she never come back no more. 
RM: 
No. 
Seems they're as big as a quarter. 
I've stood and 
watched em come up out of the sand. 
RM: 
How long does 
it take till they come up? 
HM: 
Oh, three or four weeks, I guess. 
When the sun come 
over there, it's real sunny on the sand--
RM: 
What's the smallest you ever want to catch? 
HM: 
I throw it back under ten or twelve pounds. 
Too small 
to bother with. 
The small ones are good eating, but not worth the trouble. 
The 
big ones are skinny. 
They best size is eighteen or twenty pounds. 
RM: 
Does the weather make any difference? 
HM: 
Sometimes after a storm or a rain, sometimes they cross 
the dams and all--
RM: 
So 
is that when you want to trap? 
HM: 
I know they're in there. 
Sometimes I set there for an 
hour with the binoculars like. 
BG: 
I imagine when its hot and all they go 
in the water 
where it's cool 
HM: 
The hotter it gets, the deeper the water they go 
in. 
RM: 
Is 
it harder to get em then? 
HM: 
No, not really. 
It cools off at nights. 
You can 
set 
in deep water. 
RM: 
How about when the frost is coming? 
HM: 
They bury. 
RM: 
They're gone then. 
HM: 
About the end of September you might as well quit. 
A 
boy dug out a nest of eggs one day 
up 
in the woods in a dam--
had to be an awful big snapper. 
Had seventy—five eggs 
in 
there. 
We counted em, put em back 
in there, and covered em 
over again. 
RM: 
How big are they? 
HM: 
About half as big as a ping—pong ball. 
RM: 
Anybody eat em? 
HM: 
Coon, fox. 
RM: 
Do people? 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 142 
HM: 
Not that I know of. 
BG: 
I'd be afraid they'd have baby ones 
in em. 
HM: 
Not as long as they're in her. 
I've heard tell 
of em 
usin' em when they clean em and they're full of eggs. 
RM: 
What do they do with them? 
HM: 
Put em in the soup. 
Break one open, 
it's like yellow 
like all 
yolk 
in a chicken egg. 
They're really snow white, the 
eggs are. 
Break one open. and the yolk, 
is all yellow. 
They'll 
already have next year's eggs 
in em, and they'll have to lay that 
batch. 
They'll have two years of eggs in em. 
One batch'II be 
big and there'll be another batch of that many, ain't no bigger 
than match heads, 
little yellow ones. 
A whole cluster of em. 
RM: 
Like caviar fish eggs? 
BG: 
That's what the second batch'll 
look like. 
HM: 
About as big as bee—bees, a whole big cluster of em. 
She lays this year's, she's already got the eggs in for next 
year 
The seasonings for the soup include thyme, sage, and marjoram. 
Chop up the hard boiled eggs, when the soup is just about done. 
You don't want to 
leave them in there (earlier) because they'll 
fall apart. 
You could get snapper soup at the Old English Tavern in 
Pennsauken. 
Givey's Bar on 206 used to make 
it 
like Mom made it. 
It's now Ken's. 
Going towards Hammonton. 
Old English Tavern is 
on a road that comes out onto 130. Westfield Avenue. 
We 
listen to a red—winged blackbird (its call 
can be heard on the 
tape.) 
RM: 
When are you going to quit snapper trapping? 
HM: 
it's something to do--I 
like to roam around in the woods 
around them lakes, ponds, and cricks. 
WM: 
What are some of your favorite places/ 
HM: 
Harrisville, Chatsworth. 
RM: 
Did you ever work 
in the bogs? 
HM: 
Yeah, when I was young. 
Working the the bogs, planting 
the vines, chop wood, clear the ground for blueberry farms, chop 
em up, dig em up by hand. 
Around Chatsworth you might ask for a hot roast beef sandwich 
and get venison 
RM: 
Did you ever gather stuff 
in the woods to sell? 
HM: 
Huckleberries. (But not moss or pine cones). 
They think most of the full—time trappers are 
in Chatsworth--
New Gretna type of area. 
Good money trapping coon--fifteen 
to thirty dollars apiece for them. 
Catch three or four or 
five a day, you'll do alright. 
Re: 
Hunting dogs. 
His grandson does hunting. 
MH: 
What kind of dogs do people use? 
HM: 
Mostly Walker fox hounds. 
They're a breed by theirselves. 
MH: 
You wouldn't use any Maryland Hounds? 
HM: 
No. 
If you have coon dogs, they're a special breed by 
theirself. 
Rabbit dogs--beagles. 
MH: 
You don't have any dogs now? 
HM: 
Not right now, no. 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs

Lou Gravinese and his son are a father and son team in the 
volunteer fire company. 
Discussion re: 
the fire at Joanne Van Istendal's place the 
preceding day. 
BG attributes it to kids being out of school 
and bored, as everyone had the day before. 
Lou's been 
in the 
fire company for twenty two years or so. 
Herb has fought a few 
fires, mostly by shoveling dirt on them.

Conklin is 72 years old. He's been making decoys for 56 years. 
Ed Conklin 
is his brother. 
He two two years ago. 
Hurley 
has lived 
in Manahawkin for forty years. 
Originally from Cedar 
Run. 
He was 14 when he started carving. 
"I 
learnt the hard way— 
all 
by myself." 
He had Shourds decoys, and Lloyd Parker decoys. 
RM: 
So you modelled them after them? 
HC: 
No, made my own models. 
RM: 
How were yours different? 
HC: 
Well, you see, I was always lookin at ducks, watchin' ducks, 
had some ducks home. 
MH: 
What other kinds of animals did you hunt? 
HC: 
Oh, I used to go gunning for rabbits and ducks and birds. 
MH: 
Did you have rabbit dogs? 
HC: 
Yeah, I had a rabbit dog, a deer dog, any kind of dog you want 
to put him on--he was all 
in one. 
He'd run anything. 
MH: 
What was his name? 
HC: 
Watch 
RM: 
Watch? 
HC: 
Yeah 
MH: 
"Cause he was full of ticks? 
HC: 
Ticks and fleas--far as that went, he even had fits!(laughs) 
RM: 
Your first decoys were for you or did you sell them? 
HC: 
I sold a dozen to Sherwood Corlies--Rue Curlies's brother. 
He had a sawmill--I made a dozen for him for a dollar apiece. 
Twelve dollars . 
MH: 
What kinds of ducks were 
in that dozen? 
HC: 
Black ducks and sheldrakes, we call em--merganzers to 
people who don't know the name of sheldrake. 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 146 
MH: 
Was that a complete rig? 
HC: 
Well, a rig of decoys would be eighteen or twenty black ducks 
a couple teal, or brant or geese-- (?)brant and about six or eight 
geese. 
MH: 
Would that be a rig for diving ducks or puddle ducks? 
HC: 
No, diving ducks are broad bills, golden—eyes and merganzers 
like I said, but I made the black ducks for a boy--well, that 
was Sherwood Corlies's boy, Bob Corlie--he's livin yet--he's 
about 78. 
He (Sherwood Corlies) used to run the sawmill up at Cedar Run--
that's how come I knew him. 
At fourteen you don't know too 
many people you know. (wryly chuckling) You don't know too 
many women either. 
MH: 
When you make a decoy rig do you need to know where the 
person is going to be hunting? 
HC: 
Whatever they want, that's what I made. 
They could gun 
where they wanted to. 
Never in the same piece. 
(It's) cordin to the wind the way you set em. 
You set em here 
(demonstrates) 
if 
the wind's--from here to here 
if 
the 
wind's comin from your right side--and when it's comin' from 
that way you'd set em from here to here. 
MH: 
Are there names for the different kinds of sets you put 
out? 
Like Fish hook or Pipestem? 
HC: 
Nah. 
MH: 
Names for the different kinds of wind? 
HC: 
Southerly wind, No'theaster like some of em say. 
NO'easter. (?)the tide all over. 
Southerly is just a good breeze 
boin up and down the bay. 
With a Nor'wester the ducks would come 
from the bay on the meadows. 
Here they would, along the Jersey 
shore. 
He's never heard of a "pogee tide."(laughs) 
There's a lot of 
things I never heard tell of, though. 
RM: 
Does a duckhunter put ducks 
in his rig like the ducks he 
wants to hunt? 
HC: 
Mostly. 
If he was going blackducking, black duck gunnin on 
the meadows, you'd put out black duck decoys. 
If you was 
in the 
bay you'd put out whatever you had. 
RM: 
Why? 
HC: 
Well, you can kill a sheldrake, you can kill a black duck, 
you can kill a golden—eye, you can kill geese, brant, all that 
stuff 
in the bay. 
RM: 
Well, would a sheldrake come down to a rig of brants? 
HC: No, mostly he'll come to what looks like him. 
RM: 
So, 
if there's one there that looks like him, 
then he'll come to that? 
MH: 
Is there a way of making the decoys sit in the water just 
the right way to attract different ducks? 
HC: 
No, 
if you want to attract different ducks, why you use 
the decoys for that kind of duck--golden eyes for golden—eyes, 
black ducks for black ducks? 
MH: 
Did you every had to adjust them for icy weather? 
HC: 
No, 
we didn't do too much gunnin in 
icy water--if there 
was an air hold 
in the ice you could gun there, but it didn't 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 147 
make much difference what kind of decoys. 
MH: 
Why are the decoys carved hollow on the inside? 
HC: 
They set on top of the water better. 
Those decoys from 
Cobb Island, Virginia, they'd sink 
in our water. 
They made em 
out of telephone poles, oak trees, everything there. 
They 
wasn't much good. 
MH: 
They'd float there but not up here? 
HC: 
They wouldn't float too good anywhere. 
They were too 
heavy. 
RM: 
Why'd they make em that way? 
HC> 
Well, they didn't have the wood and they didn't have the 
knowledge to use different things that they had to use, or 
didn't have it, most of em, because most of these people didn't 
have much. 
Back in the days when you made decoys, why nobody had 
too much. They don't make em for gunning any more. 
Machine—made, 
something like that is all you're getting now. 
I don't make any 
for decoys. 
Make em something like it--but you can't throw this 
decoy 
in the water. 
There's now weights on the bottom of 
it. 
MH: 
So you don't put the weights on the bottoms if they're not 
for gunning? 
HC: 
Well, I put the weight on most of em--so they look 
like 
decoys, but I don't sell 
em for that no more. 
RM: 
When you were makin em for the water would different 
ducks -- do different ducks ride the water differently? 
HC: 
Yeah. 
RM: 
So would you try to duplicate that in the decoy? 
HC: 
No, a broadbill, he'd sit down like this with his tail down 
in the water. 
A brant, see, he'd have his tail 
up 
in the air 
like this. 
or a goose, or a black duck, or anything. 
RM: 
So how would you make a decoy do that? 
HC: 
Well, you'd make it that way. 
In other words, you'd make 
the decoy -- see, 
if I was makin a broadbill, his tail would be 
way down here. 
He wouldn't set up high like this. 
RM::Would you every put the weight in a different place to 
affect the way that it sits? 
HC: 
Mostly right in the center of the decoy, 
on the bottom. 
RM: 
So you said the people in Virginia didn't have very good 
materials---
HC: 
They didn't make a very good decoys, did they? 
RM: 
But the cedar is 
important in these decoys being good, 
is 
it? 
HC: 
Yes, 
it's light--it's light wood. 
If that was oak, 
it 
would be twice as heavy. 
RM: 
It 
is 
light, almost feels like balsa. 
HC: 
I've made some out of balsa wood too. 
MH: 
Have you made any out of cork? 
HC: 
Made a couple--didn't amount to much. 
They're not that 
good. 
MH: 
What did you use -- a rasp? 
HC: 
Use a knife or anything on cork. 
Why 
it would break 
out pretty easy. 
MH: 
Didn't you borrow a spokeshave when you first got 
started? 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 148 
HC: 
Yeah, I borrowed one off of a real old timer over in 
Cedar Run. 
After I split enough wood for him for the use of 
it, 
he sold 
it to me. 
So he got all 
that wood cut and split before 
that. 
RM: 
(lookin at a photo album)What are you making here, Hurley? 
HC: 
That's a sandpiper. 
That's an old one. 
RM: 
Did people use these as decoys or 
is this for decoration? 
HC: 
They used these bigger ones, but not very many snipe,, (or 
sandpipers), yellow legs, and plovers, and curlews.(?) 
RM: 
So can people tell 
one of your decoys from other peoples? 
HC: 
Well, 
if 
it's got a ? on the bottom of 
it--a little 
dotted square by the H> -- it's H. Conklin instead of Hurley 
Conklin -- in case anybody forges my decoys -- I have a 
round dot there. 
RM: 
How about in the way the decoy looks? 
HC: 
Well, other people try to make em like mine. 
See this 
is a straight neck. 
there's a crooked—neck brant and a straight 
necked brant--and there's some sits up 
like this--they're 
tails, they call em -- feeders. 
They've got em sawed off right 
here. 
Brant, they stick their -- up in the air like that while 
they're eating. 
See, they don't dive, they(?). 
There's all 
these 
different styles. 
I can't explain it to you. 
RM: 
Have you harvested cedar ever? 
HC: 
Yeah. 
RM: 
Where? 
HC: 
That's what you call a knot—head sandpiper--that piece of 
wood you see there. 
It's from my grand—daughter. 
She just 
wanted to -- here are the sheldrakes. 
RM: 
Who else 
is around carving a good decoy? 
HC: 
I don't know of anybody. 
There's some newtimers, they never 
did carve a good decoy. 
They started to sellem for a lot more 
money than people could pay. 
RM: 
When you go to get the cedar out of the swamp for your 
decoys, what would you look for? 
HC: 
A big cedar--they bring it to me now. 
MH: 
Who brings it to you? 
HC: 
Different boys that make decoys theirselves--here's a 
crooked—necked brant. 
RM: 
These are yours? 
HC: 
I carved em all, but different people owned them. 
(Hurley to MH) 
Did you every get married? 
MH: 
No, not yet. 
HC: 
You're better off 
if you don't get married. 
MH: 
Why? 
HC: 
If you're going to have to work for yourself you might 
as well work for yourself, not somebody else. 
RM: 
What else would be a trait of Hurley Conklin decoy 
besides a crooked neck brant? 
Old squaws--there'll be one of these on the ash tray you 
get from Ducks Unlimited this year—here's some of my old 
gunnin licenses. (We're looking a photo album.) 
RM: : What are your favorite ones to make? 
HC: 
Merganzers. 
I made em all my 
life. 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs

Conklin has made

i 
m. 
MH: 
Didn't Rube Corlies make some distinctive birds? 
HC: 
Not very good. 
All 
the old decoy carvers are all 
gone 
except for me. 
Rube Corlies started when he was an old man. 
When he died he hadn't been carving that long. 
He only went gunning with his older brothers. 
HC: 
The ducks aren't there any more. 
RM: 
They aren't? 
HC: 
Nope. 
Where I used to see ten ducks all 
at one time, now you wouldn't 
see ten ducks maybe the whole year. 
MH: 
What were the names of the places you went gunning? 
HC: 
Cedar Run, Marshes Pond, Ube's Pond, New Pond--they were 
all 
on the meadows. 
(Spellings and pronunciations difficult 
to make out) 
End of side one. 
TX02: 
Side 2 
The ponds on the meadows you gun for black ducks, mostly 
Gunned the Mill Creek (?) for Herb Shapiro. (as a guide.) 
MH: 
Were there islands on the bay you'd go gunning on? 
HC: 
Yeah, Egg Island, Surfer Island, Williams Island, 
I didn't gun all of em, but those were places they would 
gun. 
RM: 
what would make a good place. 
HC: 
Wherever you'd have ducks flying by. 
You'd have to 
throw a lot of seed for em and you'd know they was there. 
Corn or rye...The diving ducks you'd see swimming down the 
channels in deep water for fish. 
I saw eight sheldrakes the 
other night. 
I was down watching them. 
They were after fish. 
Fish eating ducks. 
MH: 
What kinds of ducks taste the best? 
HC: 
I've tasted black duck, goose, brant, none of them 
are fishy ducks--they're vegetable eating ducks. 
But a 
sheldrake, you cook a sheldrake, you got fish and duck all 
at the same time. 
MH: 
What's the best way to cook em? 
HC: 
There 
is 
no best way to cook em, you still got fish and 
duck all 
at the same time, and that's not so good. 
Some people 
just eat the breast. 
RM: 
How 
would you decide which ducks to go after? 
HC: 
Whatever ducks come 
in 
to you, that's what you get. 
If you 
went on the meadows you'd get black ducks. 
When I went duck 
hunting, whatever I killed, that's what I got: 
Two sheldrakes, a 
couple of black ducks. 
lot of people'd go and didn't get 
anything. 
I didn't get too many myself. 
A lot of people, they 
didn't know the difference between one duck and another anyway, 
when they went gunning--they'd say, "There goes a sheldrake," or 
a merganser, and that could be a hooded merganser, or 
it could be 
an american merganser--sheldrake, we call em--there's three 
different kinds of em. 
if you knew em, why then you could tell 
them apart. 
MH: 
Would they call 
em all 
sheldrakes? 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 150 
HC: 
We'd call 
em sheldrakes, cock robin, sawbills-- a sheldrake 
was just 
a red—breasted, for American, and a hooded, 
why they'd call em a cock robin or a sawbill. 
MH: 
Did you go eeling? 
HC: 
With a spear. 
MH: 
Is that hard to do? 
HC: 
That's the way they do 
it 
in the wintertime. 
When they 
wouldn't be runnin' they'd be underneath the mud. 
In the bays 
and inthe deep cricks. 
You have to find them by poking around 
in the mud. 
If the water's clear, 
in fresh water you can see 
where they go 
in at--a little round hole there. 
But when they're 
under grass, 
in pretty deep water, they just lay there on top of 
the mud. 
Eels 
in the bay were fresh water eels 
Good eatin. 
Fry em, bake 
em 
in the oven. 
It's like meat off a chicken leg. 
If you like 
fish, you like eel. 
MH: 
Is 
it hard to fillet? 
HC: 
No, 
I'll tell you how you do 
it. 
Get close to where his 
head 
is, 
and you cut it there. 
Pull his head, take the insides 
out, cut it down, where the belly part it, 
pull 
the skin right 
off the eel. 
Then it's all 
cleaned, except washing it. 
Then 
you bake him -- you put him in there whole. 
Put some bacon 
across, a couple slices. 
RM: 
Did you ever use a fyke to get any eels? 
HC: 
No, 
Don't use too many fykes for eels-- see an eel, a big 
eel, big as my arm here, he goes 
in a little hole like that. 
They're slippery, an eel 
is. 
You can't pick one up and think 
you're gonna hold him. 
MH: 
You didn't use eel 
pots? 
HC: 
Eel pots, I've got a couple of them we used to use. 
You 
put the bait like 
in horsefoot -- you chop a female horsefoot 
(Horseshoe crab) up -- it's got a lotta eggs into 
it -- oh, 
it's not too much trouble. 
RM: 
Did you make the pot? 
HC: 
You could buy em or make em. 
Made out of splints, 
like 
a basket, some of em. 
If you could make a basket you could 
make one of them. 
Then you had two funnels into em. 
A funnel 
here, say like this. 
He'd go 
in here. 
Then you've got another 
one where the bait was. 
That was 
in the back part of the eelpot. 
You take that apart... 
MH: 
Was there a lot of salt hay farming in the meadows around 
here? 
HC: 
They don't grow it, they just lease the meadows and it 
grows itself. 
He trapped a lot -- for mink and muskrat, and he worked 
for salt hay farmers. 
Started trapping at about 14. 
Has some 
conibears hanging on his wall, and some steel traps for fox, and 
muskrats. 
Doesn't know any names for different kinds of sets. 
Foxes run 
in paths that deer have made, or people. 
That's where 
you can set. 
HC: 
There's a lot of old horse roads and wagon roads 
in the 
woods, all 
growed up -- right where the horse walked in the 
Hufford--85 Audiocassette logs 
page 151 
middle of the path, -- a single horse, not a team -- he'd make a 
road right down there. 
The wheels are on each side -- but right 
where he walked he'd make a pretty good path. 
That's all that 
would be there. 
The rest of 
it would grow up, but that path would 
still stay there where the horse walked. 
Then there was other places as well. 
The fox would walk down 
that path. 
You set different for fox than you do for muskrats. 
Muskrats, you'd set in the water, and when the water come up --
Fur auctions? 
Hurley sold to different people -- to Sears and 
Roebuck. 
Skinned them down, cleaned the fat off, put them on 
stretching boards or wires. 
He mostly used boards. 
A mink would 
be 
long and not wide, a muskrat would be wide and then narrow. 
If you make something, try to make something that nobody 
else 
is making. 
Everybody wants it then. 
You can sell 
it. 
I sold 
the first ones I make for twenty five dollars. Forty years ago 
It was a hobby. 
I worked, and I had a hobby all 
my life. 
I 
worked up at Pemberton and built houses, was 
in the army three 
and a half years in the world war. 
He worked in the Bay most of his life. 
He has clammed and 
oystered. 
to fan or something is on now making a lot of racket.) 
Talking about how he met his wife, Mary, and how he married 
her when he got back from overseas. 
He built the house he's 
living in. 
MH: 
Did the mosquitoes bother you? 
HC: 
Oh, 
I've been ate up by mosquitoes all my life. 
Never kept martin houses
