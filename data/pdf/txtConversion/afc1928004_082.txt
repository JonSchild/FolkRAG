ON THE BEACH AT LONG BRANCH. 
As sung by the G REAT LINGARD. 
On the Beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was if in the plot--
A Gent stood there bedside me—still I 
saw him not— 
Till, at last, by chance, my eyelids I 
did raise- — 
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured gaze— 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness—quite the pink of beaux. 
CHORUS. 
'Tins on the beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his bride 1 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange—his eyes with love did beam— 
Ere much time was over; we began to chat— - 
And hours passed away—still he beside me sat--
And with ways so winning he did love impart--
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
He told me that he loved me, vowed that all his life 
Would be to him worthless, unless I'd be his wife. 
'Twas on the beach, &c. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of Town. 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true, by all the Powers above I 
Be asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say— 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I 
named the happy , day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
He'd live alone for me, and I 
alone for him! 
Spoken.—And I 
can assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, he 
Is one of those dear deliz,hful fellows that no young girl could 
resist, and I'm very happy and proud to say: UP to the pres-
ent moment I've no cause to regret that 
'Twas on the beach, &e.

THE MABEL WALTZ. 
As Sung by Tom- PASTOR. 
I 
once did know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat; 
She used to run a 
sewing-machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose; 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, and pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn-up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twas a 
fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
Up at Irving Hall. 
AlletWiliagit,,itlAa 41.4k  
CHORUS. 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought she ever would prove false; 
Her step was light as the bounding fawn, dancing the Mabel 
Waltz. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked; 
And, every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk. 
I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store, 
And also bought her a 
new silk-dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead broke, 
And I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
[CaoRus. 
And, then, I 
thought 'twas getting time 
The question for to pop. 
I 
went one day dressed in my best, 
Straight down to the shop: 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
My charmer had, that very day, 
Just gone out of town. 
Judge my feelings when Miss Brown 
These cruel words let slip: 
It's my opinion she s 
gone off 
Upon her wedding trip.

" WALKING DOWN BROADWAY." 
And when a 
year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see 
My 
fair, but false one, sitting 
With a 
baby on her knee. 
I 
quickly marched into the house, 
And, there, what met my view! 
'Twas a 
tall Policeman, six feet high, 
He was her husband, too! 
He collared me, and then commenced 
A 
series of assaults, 
I 
never chassez'd it so fast before, 
While dancing the Mabel Waltz. [CrfoRus. 
" 
WALKING DOWN BROADWAY." 
Sung by the G REAT LINGARD. 
The sweeteet thing in life 
And no one dare say nay, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
Is walking down Broadway. 
My sisters, thro' the Park 
And at Long Branch wish to stay, 
But / prefer to walk 
Down the festive, gay Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway— walking down Broadway— 
The 0. K. thing on Saturday is walking down Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway—the festive, gay Broadway; 
The 0 K thing on Saturday, is walking down Broadway. 
Last Wednesday afternoon 
My cousin Will did say, 
"Nellie, come along with me, 
I'll take you down Broadway, 
To the Theatre Comiqt.e, 
To see Captain Jinks so gay; 
Then we'll dine at Delmonico's, 
'Fore returning down Broadway." 
DIALOGUE.—And I 
must say ladies and gentlemen, with all 
due deference to other pleasures in life, there's nothing so 
charming as— 
Walking down Broadway, &c. 
CAPTAIN JINRS OF THE HORSE MARINES. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
I 
am Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, 
I 
of-ten live beyond my 
-means, 
I 
sport young ladies in their teens, 
To cut a 
swell in the army. 
I 
teach the La-dies how to dance, 
How to dance, how to dance, 
I 
teach the La-dies how to dance, 
For I'm their pet in the army. 
SPOKEN.-11a! ha! ha! 
CHORUS. 
I'm Cap-thin Jinks of the Horse Marines, 
I 
give my horse good corn and beans; 
Of course its quite beyond my means, 
The' a 
Captain in the ar-my. 
I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of course I 
thought it capital fun. 
When the enemy came then off I 
run, 
I 
was'nt cut out for the army, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
Mama she cried, mama she cried, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
" 
Hc aint cut out for the army." 
SPOKEN—NC, she thought I 
was too young, but then, I 
said, 
ah! mama, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, &e. 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill, 
At the Balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout. 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
" 
Oh that's the curse of the army." 
SPOKEN.—Of course my hat did fall off, but ah! nevertheless, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, &c. 
My Tailor's bills came in so fast, 
Forced me one day to leave at last. 
ITALIA N GUINEA PIG BOY. 
And ladies too no more did cast, 
Sheep's eyes at me in the army. 
My creditors at me did shout, 
At me did shout, at me did shout, 
My creditors at me did shout, 
" 
Why kick him out of the army." 
SroKEN—I said, ah! gentlemen, ah! kick me out of the army ? 
Perhaps you are not aware, that, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, &e. 
ITALIAN GUrNEA PIG DOY. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGIRD. 
Fin a 
poor Italian Guinea pig boy, 
Straight from Florence I 
come with my stock; 
My parents say, " Joseph, what for you roam," 
And mine little sister cry, when I 
leavee my home. 
CHORUS.

On zo poor Italian Guinea pig boy, 
Vot leave him good home. 
Ven I

We no see you 'gain but my Guinea .:!ry " queak,"

But mine Guinea jump'd in and pull me out by ze hair.

OLD H ATS AND RAGS. 
As sung by the G REAT LINGARD. 
Old hats old rags! ray trouble is great, 
Could I 
be in a 
more wretched state, 
I 
feel indeed my heart it will break; 
List, and I 
will tell you of my wrongs, 
Hark and I 
will my woes unfold; 
By a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold, 
And through her I've lost all my nice gold, 
My heart and my gold is both gone. 
CRORUS 
Old hats, old rags, my cry is old rags: 
This bag on my back, the streets I 
drag, 
And Ruth, mine Ruth, I 
did love her so, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
sha lived down an area in Union Square, 
And every day I 
did pass me by there, 
She was possess'd of beauty most rare, 
And one day she beckoned me to come, 
She had some old hats to exchange for new. 
She melted the heart of this poor Jew, 
And how I 
loved her! Ah, just a 
few, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Old hats, old rags, an. 
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my knees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my dear wife and not to say nay, 
And then she agreed to be mine; 
But, oh my heart, I 
must have been cream, 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
seam, 
And gave ten dollars to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, cte. 
She said, Now, dear Slotchzein, soon you'll be mine, 
Drink my good health in a 
glass of old wine, 
It must have been poisonad, for I 
slept such a 
time, 
Which she turned it to profit it seems; 
For when I 
awoke, I 
thought I 
must choke, 
I 
was tied by the arms and legs with a 
rope, 
And Ruth had hooked it with mine coat, 
With a 
thousand dollars sewed in the seam. 
Old hats, old rags, ctc.

SERGEANT COP, 
TILE PET OF THE N. Y. FORCE. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARTI. 
Don't start, I 
beg, and hear me swear, 
My hand upon my breast, 
That only your attention 
I 
am going to arrest I 
My beat is in Fifth Avenue, 
Where 'raong the haughty swells, 
Aristocratic tastes prevail, 
And. so my figure tells! 
CHORUS. 
For who's the pride of all the force? 
Sergeant Cop! Sergeant Cop! 
That's the answer quite of course, 
Sergeant Cop! Sergeant Cop! 
I 
look upon street children, 
And my glance is stern and. high, 
And on the Sunday gtoggeries 
I 
keep my weather eye; 
But sometimes, all my vigilance 
My feelings overcome, 
And Mercy seasons Justice with 
A 
little drop of ruin! 
For who's, &c. 
I'm tender as a 
turtle, though, 
With all my warlike look, 
And in a 
certain area, 
Besides a 
certain cook; 
Her heart is warm, her victuals cold, 
And both are mine, she swears, 
Together with her savings which 
She's put in Erie shares. 
For who's, ea.

"WALKING IN THE ZOO. 
Air :—" Walking Down Broadway." 
The Stilton, sir, the cheese, the 0. K thing to do, 
On Sunday afternoon, is to toddle in the Zoo, 
Week days may do for Cads. but not for me and you, 
So dress'd right down the road, we show them who is who. 
CHORUS. 
The walkin7 in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thin"- on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
So when there came to town, my pretty cousin Loo, 
I 
took her off to spend a 
Sunday at the Zoo, 
I 
show' d 
her the aquarium, the Tiger, the Zebu, 
The Elephant, the Eland, that cuss the Kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
That Sunday in the Zoo, that Sunday in the Zoo, 
It's jolly with a 
pretty girl walking in the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
I 
show' d 
her the swellesses, and all the fashions new, 
Girls with golden locks, girls with black hair too, 
(Walnut gives the black, champagne the golden hue) 
All the beautiful for ever that Madame Rachel knew. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The monkeys put us to the blush on Sunday at the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
So in the monkey house our going in to woo, 
Piling up the agony, swearing to be true, 
Agony indeed for the cheerful 
Cockatoo, 
-Caught my ear a 
nip and bit it through and through. 
CHORUS. 
Oh that cheerful Cockatoo, that awful Cockatoo, 
, The horror and the agony that Sunday at the Zoo, 
UPON DIY SACWED HONOR. 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
My cousin bolted off without any more ado, 
And I 
skedaddled also, looking very blue, 
So sympathising friends I 
bid you all adieu, 
(It's a 
secret, mind, so don't pretend you know.) 
CHORUS. 
If you meet me at the Zoo, you meet me at the Zoo, 
I'm as great a 
swell as ever on Sunday at the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The U. K. thing on Sunday is walking in the Zoo.

I

Though my husband's in the Army. 
I 
met the Captain on Parade, 
When first on him my eyes I 
laid; 
An exclamation then I 
made, 
He's the handsomest man in the Army I 
Ile saw the conquest he had made, 
That he had made, that he had made, 
He heard the compliment I 
paid, 
To him the pride of the army. 
SPOKEN.—I 
really did think he was the handsomest, and I 
think so yet for the matter of that, some people think I 
married 
him for the title of Lady, but not so; for it was love at first 
sight, if not how could I 
be: 
Together we sometimes promenade, 
And hear remarks about us made, 
And often we have beard it said, 
They're the pride and boast of the Army. 
The officers they also shout, 
They also shout, they also shout, 
The officers they all cry out, 
Oh! they're the pride of the Army.

am quite positive we are the pride of the Army, 
they all tell us so and why shouldn't we believe it, who hasn't

*Pronounzed " Bit-tab Bee-ah." 
BITTER BEER. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD 
The subject of my little song, 
Is one I 
hold most dear, 
It supports our Constitution, 
And it will for many a 
year; 
John Pr_ill would surely be defunct, 
Or es° look rather queer, 
If Bass Lk,- Co. should cease to brew 
Their glorious " Bitter Beer."* 
CHORUS. 
Allsop, Bass & Co., they each deserve a monument, so give 
them whila we're here, 
Three cheers for Bass and Allsop, and their glorious " Bitter 
Beer." 
I've tasted " Hock " and Claret too, 
Madeira and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid swell; 
Of all complaints from " A to Z," 
The fact is very clear, 
There's no disease but what's been cured 
By Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &e. 
I've lived in Scotland many years, 
And drank its mountain dew, 
I 
don't deny but what it's good, 
And a 
stimulant, it's true. 
Pm far from being prejudiced, 
As many think, I 
fear, 
But give to me a 
cooling draught, 
Of Bass's " Piiter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &c.

THE GRECIAN BEND. 
As sung by the GREAT LINEAR"). 
Good evening to you one and. all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dressed in this quiet fashion, 
Pray do not think me rude. 
I 
always study " Le Follet," 
The fashion to amend; 
So I 
introduce you, ladies, too, 
This graceful Grecian Bend. 
CHORUS. 
The Grecian Bend, as I 
now show, 
You must admit is all the go. 
The head. well forward, and the body you extend, 
To be perfect in the Grecian Bend. 
'Twas raining hard the other day, 
So I 
got into a 
stage, 
Some little boys began to shout, - 
Which put me in a 
rage. 
The driver, too, said, " Really, Miss, 
You've room enough for ten," 
And actually charged. me double, 
On account of my Grecian Bend. 
SPOKEN 
wouldn't mind it so much only there was Ann 
Jenkins, who lives next door to me, in the same stage, she began 
to laugh at me, she's been practicing the Grecian Bend for 
three weeks, but she can't do it, she's jealous of me because I 
took her young man away. 
One gent had the audacity to tell 
me that the Greci ai Bend was nothing more or less than a 
spasmodic movement of the third rib in connection with the 
left shoulder. 
In fact I 
need not tell you that—

FIFTH AVENUE. 
As 
sung by the GREAT LIEGARD.. 
Before you stands Frank Rifle, 
An ensign in our corps, 
I'm not one of those trifles 
You've often met before; 
A 
free and easy fellow, 
On the battle-field I'm smart, 
But a 
darling little creature 's 
) 
Struck the bull's-eye of my heart. 
CHORUS, 
And I'll never, never leave her, 
Between both me and you, 
She's my darling little treasure, 
I 
met in Fifth Avenue. 
'Twas at her uncle's mansion, 
I 
met her at a 
ball, 
I 
paid her great attention, 
For I 
loved her best of all; 
What beauty did adorn her, 
As I 
danced her off her feet, 
And in a 
quiet corner 
We had a 
confab sweet. 
SPOKEN: Yes, I 
told her I loved her, and just at. that mo-
ment up stepped her uncle, and said.: "Young man, what's your 
intentions toward my niece, and what's your fortune ?" I 
told 
him I 
had a 
fine estate at Land's End, but another fellow had 
an estate on the top of mine, and I 
couldn't get him to pull his 
off. 
He srid " Yon are the man for me, but first promise me 
*.hat you'll—" 
And I'll never, &e.

LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
W ords by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by W. 
F. 
W ELLMAN. 
They talk of their wine and their goblets of gold, 
That sparkle in beauty and splendor untold; 
There's very good cheer in the draught I 
will own, 
But little to please us when weary we've grown. 
Oh, dear to my heart, yes, far dearer to me, 
Than wealth of the Indies, or gems of the sea, 
This rough-looking friend; out of clay he was dug, 
The pride of my bosom, my little brown jug. 
CHORUS. 
The little brown jug, the little brown jug! 
0, sweet is a 
sup from the little brown jug. 
His face it is tanned with the heat of the sun, 
He's always a 
welcome of rollicking fun; 
'Whatever the liquor that flows to this brim, 
It makes little difference to me or to him. 
But strangest of all, while together we pull, 
Re's sure to be empty, I'm sure to be full. 
I 
ne'er had a 
wife, and so closely I'll hug, 
Thy form to my bosom, my little brown jug. 
The little brown jug, &e. 
We've journeyed together for many a 
day, 
And dear is our friendship as flowers of May. 
We both have grown older, but little I 
care, 
So long as they leave me his welcome to share. 
Thy features, old comrade, have many a 
scar, 
Once almost as bright as the moon or a 
star, 
But fondly together still onward we'll W.., 
My true friend, my dear friend, my little brown jug. 
The little brown jug. &e. 
THOU ART SO NEAR AND YET $O FAR. 
I 
know an eye so softly bright, 
That glistens like a 
star of night; 
My soul it draws, with glances kind, 
To heaven's blue vault, and there I 
find 
Another star as pure and clear 
As that which mildly sparkles here. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near, and yet so far i 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near, and yet so far! 
CHORUS: 
That eye so soft, like violets blue, 
A 
treasure bears of morning dew; 
And when its light entranc'd. I 
see, 
What joy, what pain possesses me I 
A 
world, where I 
would gladly dwell, 
Is that bright orb I 
love so well. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, &c. 
If closed at last that radiant eye should be, 
No more the day will dawn for me; 
If night should dim its laughing light, 
Oh! then, for ever twill be night ! 
Those eyes that brightly, softly shine, 
For me the sun and moon combine. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, &

jULIANA-PHEBIANA-CONSTANTINA BROWN. 
Ohl I'm going to sing a 
song to you about Juliana Brown, 
She was the prettiest yaller gal was ever in the town ; 
She had eyes so bright and teeth so white, like diamonds they did shine, 
And such a 
lovely foot she had: she wore a 
number nine! 
CHORUS: 
For, she looked so sweet, and she dressed so neat; 
Of all the pretty yeller gals was ever seen in the town, 
It's my Juliana Phebiana-Constantina Brown. 
Oh! the first time that I 
saw her, she was dressed up to the teeth, 
The look that she then gave me nearly took away my breath. 
I 
asked her if she would only be true to me, 
And, when I'd sell my Poodle-Dog, a 
married we should be. 
For, she looked, &c. 
It's my Juliana-Phebiana-Constantina Brown: 
She was the prettiest dancer, fel. miles and miles around; 
For, when she went to balls, her like was never seen: 
For, she was sure to be the Belle, and I 
the Belgerine I 
For, she looked, &c.

COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR. 
0, do not stand so long outs de, 
Why need you be so shy ? 
The people's ears are open, John, 
As they are passing by 1 
You cannot tell what they may think; 
They've said strange th ngs before. 
And if you wish to talk awhile, 
Come in and shut the door. 
CHORUS 
Come in, come in, come in, come in, 
Come in. come in, come in and shut the door. 
Ney i do not say: " No, thank you, Jane,"

You said when ladies whispered, 
No! 
They meant---Yes! all the while. 
My father, too, will welcome you, 
I 
told you so before; 
It don't took well to stand out hero, 
Come in and shut the door. 
Come in, come in, come in, &o. 
You say I

To what you said, last n

Thought on it in , he ugh 
And now my lips shall utter 
What my heart has said before  
Yes, dearest, I

Come in and shut the door.

- THE BASHFUL GIRL. 
[As sung by Miss PAULINE M ARKHAM.] 
Words and Music by L AUNCE L ENNOX. 
I'm a 
stupid, bashful thing, 
flow I 
ti-ty—ti-ty trem-ble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing 
Such a 
multitude assemble t 
0, pray dou't, or I 
wont 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me l 
How I 
quake t how I 
shake, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
Gentlemen I 
chance t9 meet, 
Make me nn'iny-ninny-ninny nervous. 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying " Heaven Preserve us!" 
How they stare, I 
declare, 
I 
at once get red as any peony; 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Verily, timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
If I 
only had a 
friend 
Like a 
bibby-bibby--brother, 
Telling me my faults to mend 
Al 
this silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man, 
Who believes in love that is platonical, 
I 
might get courage yet, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing. 
HERE'S A HEALTH TO THEE, TOM MOORE. 
Words by LORD 13YROX 
Music by —
M ICHAEL K ELLY. 
My boat is on the shore, and my bark is on the sea; 
But before I 
go, To n 
Moore, here's a 
double health to thee, 
Here's a 
double health to thee. 
Here's a 
sigh for those that love, and a 
smile for those who 
hate, 
And whatever sky's above, here's a 
heart for every fate. 
Tho' the ocean roars around me, yet it still shall bear me Ott; 
Tho' a 
desert shall surround me, it hath springs that may be 
won. 
Wert the last drop in the well, as I 
gasp upon the brink, 
Ere my sinking spirits fell, ' tis to thee that I 
would drink. 
In this water as this wine, the libations I 
would pour, 
Should be peace to thee and thine, aud a 
health to thee, Tom 
Moore, 
A 
health to thee, a 
health b 
thee, a 
health to thee, Tom 
Moore. 
DUBLIN BAY; OR, ROY NEILL. 
They sailed away in a 
gallant bark, 
Roy Neill and his fair young bride, 
He had ventured all in that bounding ark 
That danced o'er the silvery tide; 
But his heart 
as young, and his spirit light, 
And be dashed the tear away, 
As he watch d 
the shore recede from sight, 
Of his own Sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sailed, and a 
storm arose, 
And the lightning swept the deep, 
And the thunder-crash broke the short repose 
Of the weary sea boy's sleep. 
Roy Neill, he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed her tears away. 
Oh I 
Love, twas a 
fatal hour, she cried, 
When we left Sweet Dublin Bay 
On the crowded deck of the doomed ship, 
Some stood in their mute despair; 
And some, more calm, with a 
holy lip, 
Sought the God of the storm in prayer. 
She has struck on a 
rock! the seamen cried, 
In the breath of their wild dismay— 
And the ship went down, and the fair young bride, 
That sailed from Dublin Bay.

THE GOOD RHINE WINE. 
Pour out the Rhine wine, let it flow, 
Like a 
free and gushing river, 
Till sadness sinks, and every woe— 
Lies drown'd beneath its waves for ever, 
For naught can cheer the hearts that pine, 
Like a 
deep, deep draught of the good Rhine wine. 
Like a 
deep, &e. 
Pour out the Rhine wine ever more, 
Let the goblet ne'er be tiring; 
The poet's song and the sage's lore, 
And the Patriot's lofty soul inspiring; 
For an offering meet at freedom's shrine, 
Is a 
deep, deep draught of the good Rhine wine, 
Like a 
deep, cte 
Pour out the Rhine wine, when each hand 
Doth grasp a 
brimming measure; 
The pledge shall be our fatherland, 
And freedom, friendship, love and pleasure. 
Then hurrah for the land of the purple vine, 
And a 
deep, deep draught of the good Rhine wine. 
Like a

OH, WOULDN'T 'YOU LIKE TO KNOW.--[Concluded.] 
Could we know what hoss is coming in, 
Then the Derby would indeed amuse, 
For altho' we think we stand to win, 
It's possible we stand to lose. 
When to do the culinary act, 
Called by tnrfites, " putting on the pot," 
When to hedge the coin we may have back'd, 
Is quite as much a 
chance as not. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, wouldn't you like to know, 
To know without hazard or fail, 
When fortune the copper may throw 
If ' twill come down a 
head or a 
tail. 
Whether cooks will spoil the joint or no, 
Whether Jones will meet that little bill, 
Whether, when you sing, your song will go, 
Are matters quite beyond our skill. 
Now that I 
have done my best to please, 
Up the fatal copper I 
will heave, 
Come down what it will, I'm at my ease, 
in you, my friends, I 
still believe. 
Oh, wouldn't you like, &a. 
THE SAILOR'S GRAVE. 
Our bark was far, far from the land, 
When the fairest of our gallant band 
Craw deadly pale, and waned away, 
Like the twilight of an autumn day. 
We had watch'd him through long hours of pain, 
Our cares were great, our hopes in vain : 
Death's stroke he gave no coward's alarms ; 
But he smiled, and died in his messmate s 
arms 
We had no costly winding-sheet, 
We placed two round shot at his feet : 
He lays in his hammock as snug and as sound 
As a 
king in his long shroud, marble- bound ; 
We proudly deck'd his funeral vest 
With the Starry-Flag upon his breast 
We gave him this as a 
badge of the brave, 
And then he was fit for a 
sailor's grave. 
Our voices broke, and hearts turned weak ; 
Oft tears were seen on the brownest cheek ; 
The quiver played on the lip of pride, 
As we lower'd him down the ship's dark side; 
Then a 
splash and a 
plunge, and our task was o'er, 
And the billows rolled as they rolled before, 
And many wild prayers hallow 'd the wave, 
And he sank beneath in a 
sailor's grave.

WAITING FOR A- BROADWAY STAGE 
As up Broadway I 
strolled, one day, 
T3 see the styles pass by, 
A 
pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye. 
Her little short skirts in points hung down, 
For. that style's all the rage, 
She was looking up and down with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage, oh! 
CHORUS. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age: 
1 
met her on the corner. it was there that .first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
Just played round her face and, with such ease and grace 
Why like a 
little Angel she did seem. 
Bu'; I 
kept getting like any one in fear, 
For, my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage!' 
How I 
wished I'd never seen that handsome little queen, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage oh 
She was just, &c. 
But as the ice was broken, my hat, of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage, tha she required, soon came by, 
When she said in tones s') sweet. perhaps some ,.time we'll 
meet 
As up the steps her little form did fly, 
But I 
never since have seen her, so 1 
wander in despair, 
For, it seems that. since she left me twas an age, 
But I 
never shai forget that little girl 1 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage, oh 
She was just, &o. 
NELL, THE LITTLE BELLE. 
Composed by EDDIE Fox. 
Arranged by II A MARSHALL 
As I 
took s 
promenade the other day, 
My attention was attracted right-away 
By a 
pretty little Belle tha.. said her name was Nell, 
And sivi looked like the flowers in May. 
I 
stepped up to the corner of the street, 
Thinking by that I 
could meet 
This pretty little Fairy, so beautiful and airy, 
With number one gaiters on her feet. 
CHORUS: 
Oh 1 
didn t 
she cut a 
swell, 
This little dark-eyed Belle 
My love she is a 
darling little Belle, 
She's as sweet as the lilies in the dell; 
Her eyes so bright. he:: step so light: 
Is my handsome little curly-headed Nell. 
I 
followed her, I 
cannot tell you why ; 
But she had such a 
wickerbkilling eye. 
That Cupid, with his dart, made a 
capture of my heart, 
As daintily she sailed on by 
I 
watched her to her home. and, at the door, 
She stopped and smiled on me 
And, from I.er litt.e glove she threw a 
kiss of love, 
With a 
wicaed little laugh at me. 
Oh! didn't she, &c. 
Soon after that I 
met her at a 
ball: 
Oh' golly 
you should have seen my style, 
Witt Nellie on my arm oh she dances like a 
charm, 
While her little heart is innocent of guile. 
I 
told her of my love, that very night, 
And said 
Will you be mine ? 
Oh yes : said little- Neil, but you must never tell, 
And now we live down in shady dell. 
Oh I 
didn't she, &c.

BRENNEN ON THE MOOR. 
It's of a 
fearless Irishman a 
long story I 
shall tell: 
His name was Willie Brennen, in Ireland he did dwell 
It was on the Calvert mountains he commenced his hellish 
career, 
3re many a 
wealthy gentleman, before him, shook with fear. 
ClIORUS: 
Brennen on the moor, Brennen on the moor, 
Bold and undaunted, stood Brennen on the moor. 
A 
brace of loaded pistols he carried with him each day: 
He never robbed a 
poor man upon the Queen's highway; 
For what he'd taken from the rich, like Turpin, and Black Bess, 
lie always did divide it with the widows in distress. 
One night, he robbed an Irishman, by the name of Juler Dawn: 
They travelled on two together, till the day began to dawn; 
The Juler found his money gone, likewise his watch and chain/ 
He, at once, encountered him, and he robbed him back again. 
When Willie found the packman was as good a 
man as he, 
He took him on the highway, his companion for to be; 
The Juler threw away his pack, without any more delay, 
And he proved a 
faithful comrade, amidst his Agnus Dei. 
One day, upon the highway as Willie he sat down, 
He met the Mayor of Cashill, a 
mile outside of the town; 
The Mayor he knew his features: I 
think, young man, 'said he 
That your name is Willie Brennen, you must come along 
with me. 
Willie's wife she being in town, provisions for to buy, 
When she saw her Willie, she began to weep and cry; 
29 
BRENNAN ON THE MOOR. [CoNcLuDED 
I 
wish he handed n.e t1e temperers, as soon as Willie spoke 
She handed him a 
blunderbuss, from under'neath her cloak. 
Its with this loaded blunderbuss, the truth I 
will unfold, 
He made the Mayor to trembles and robbed him of his gold t 
One hundred pounds he offered for his arprehension there, 
And he, with his horse and saddle to the mountains did repair 
Willie being an outlaw, upon the mountains high. 
With cavalry and infantry, to take him they did try; 
He laughed at them with scorn, until at length did say 
Ah false hearted young woman did basely me betray 
In the County of Tipperary in a 
place called Clonmore, 
Brent en and his comrade was made to suffer sore 
He lay amongst the briars that grow thick upon the fields, 
And he received nine wounds before that he would yield. 
They were taken prisoners, in irons they were bound, 
Conveyed to Clonmell jail, and strong walls did them surround 
The jury found them guilty the judge made this reply: 
For robbing on the Queens highway, you're both condemned 
to die. 
Farewell unto my wife, and you, my children three! 
And you, my aged father, that may shed tears for me 
And you, my icvnig mother, tore her gray locks and cried 
it were better Willie Brennen, in your cradle AGALL CITIGH

SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
I 
sing you a 
ditty of a 
damsel so pretty, 
Who lives irom the city some seventeen miles. 
Her name is Maria, her worthy oil sire 
Was clerk and town-crier, his mono was John Styles. 
With lips like the cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please ; 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her 
For worse cr for better. . she was shelling green peas. 
CHORUS ; 
Under the trees, a 
bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silent y 
shelling green peas. 
I 
long loved her dearly, truly, sincerely; 
At length, I 
thought really I'd t 
ettl 
in life, 
Although aged fiftv, I'd been vc ry tlinfty, 
And thought ' twas high time to le taking a 
wife. 
With bosom on fire, in search of Mare, 
"Ebro' lanes of wild-briar o'ershadowed by trees, 
I 
strolled to the spot, where, outside her cot, there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
nch r 
the trees, dr.c. 
I 
stepped up unto her, commencing o 
woo her, 
I 
said that no truer fond heart could be ft rind 
Than mine, if she'd take me some morning and make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round. 
said,—Our 1:fe might be one round of delight, 
Like the little birds singing upon the green trees, 
To a 
whisper then dropping, my voice witt out stopping, 
The question was popping, as she popped the pelts. 
Under the trees, &e. 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said ; 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be steal ng 
A 
kiss: when came reeling her hand on my head. 
Do on think I'd engage, she cr.ed out in a 
rage, 
With a 
man twice my age I 
so, clear out, if on 
on please. 
In a 
terrible passion, at my head she SOrt crit,hing, 
On my head smashing, the bowl of green peas. 
Under the trees, tR7e 
By way or addenda, she said, Sir, remember 
That May and December can never unite ; 
Your leave, Sir, be taking. 
My m 
ek nearly breaking, 
1 
made my escape in a 
terrible flight. 
I 
never will marry, but single will tarry, 
Tho' friends and acquaintances do nothing but tease ; 
Whenever they meet me, in this style they greet me, 
Old boy, what's the price now o 
f 
Iamb and green peas 
Yes, how thc!v tease, whenevr r 
tlley please, 
By shouting out after me,—L:mb and Green Peas. 
THE BIG SUN-FLOWER. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and, look around 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Sun-flower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
How could she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No! 
And I 
feel, &a. 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of course she answered, yes. 
And I 
feel, &c.

THE MERELEST GERM THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while I'm here I'll do my best 
To please you 'with my lay. 
,Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me: for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with me, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &e. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
Some mean, it, I've no doubt; 
I'm sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, &a. 
To balls and parties T 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what I'm about: 
It pleases him, and don't hurt me: 
I'm the merriest girl that's out.

SWINGING IN THE LANE. 
Words and M USIC

How oft we talked of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play 
Upon each other, while at school 
To pass the time away I 
But, oh! how often have I 
longed 
For those bright days again, 
When little rosy Nell and I 
Went swinging in the lane t

But yet I'd give the world to be 
With rosy Nell again,

never, never will fel-0-ot 
Our swinging in th: lane 
The boys and girls would often go 
A- fishing in the brooks, 
With spools of thread for fishing-lines, 
And bended pins for hooks; 
They, sometimes, wished me with them, but 
They, always, wished in vain; 
I'd rather be with rosy Nell, 
A-swinging in. the lane. 
But yet I'd, tfte. 
But soon a 
cloud of sorrow came— 
A strange young man, from town, 
Was introduced to rosy Nell 
By Aunt Jemima Brown. 
She stayed away from school next day— 
The truth to me was plain— 
She'd gone with that there city chap, 
A-swinging in the lane 
But yet I'd; &a 
Now all young men with tender hearts, 
Pray take advice from me: 
Don't be so quick to fall in love 
With every girl you see; 
For, if you do, you soon will find 
You've only loved in vain; 
She'll go off with some other chap,

SLIDING ON THE CELLAR DOOR. 
A PARODY ON " SWINGING IN THE LANE." 
How oft we talk of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play, 
Playing " hooky" from the school 
To sport the live-long day; 
And oh! how often do I 
sigh, 
For those bright days of yore— 
When Billy Brown and I 
did slide, 
Down on the cellar door. 
CHORUS. 
yes, I 
would give all my greenbacks, 
To see those days once more; 
When Billy Brown and I 
slid down--
Old Grimes' cellar door. 
Some boys would stealing apples go, 
While others used to stray, 
Down on the dock where sugar casks 
In rows together lay; 
But Bill and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us in yore-, 
And slde by side, together slide, 
Dow 
it the old cellar door. 
Yes, I 
would, &e. 
But at last a 
change came o'er the scene, 
When poor old Grimes he died— 
His son removed the cellar door 
On which we userl to slide; 
Our mothers they were proud of it, 
For the pantaloons we tore— 
They had to be half soled and healed, 
From sliding on the door. 
Yes, I 
would, &e... 
But since I 
arrived to manhood's age, 
The only sport for .me, 
Or my ancient friend Billy Brown., 
Is to go upon a 
spree; 
Yet we never do enjoy -ourselves, 
As in the days of yore, 
When careless laughing urchins we--
Slid down the cellar door. 
Yes, I 
would, &e.

THE FFT.T.OW THAT LOOKS T.ril-R ME. 
In sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart is filled with woe, 
When on my griefs I 
ponder, 
What to do P 
I 
do not know. 
For, cruel fate does on me frown, 
And the trouble seems to be: 
There's another fellow, in this 'ere town, 
That's just the image of me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like to catch him, 
Whoever he may be 
Oh! wouldn't I 
give him partiCular fits, 
That fellow who looks like me! 
With a 
lady fair I 
started, 
To the Central Park to go, 
But was stopped, in the street, by a 
man 
Who said: Pay this bill you owe. 
In vain I 
said: I 
know you not, 
He wouldn't let me free, 
Till a 
crowd came 'round, and the bill I 
paid, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, &e. 
The other day, while walking 
Through a 
narrow street, up town, 
1 
was seized by a 
man, in a 
rage, 
Who said: I've caught you, Mr. Brown; 
You know my daughter you have wronged. 
Though his gal I 
never did see, 
He beat me, till I 
was black and blue, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, &e. 
One evening, I 
sat sparking 
A 
girl aS dear as life, 
When a 
lady, who had just dropped in,. 
Says: Brown, how is your wife 
In vain I 
said: I'm a 
single man, 
Though married I 
wish to be. 
They called me a 
swindler, and kicked me out, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, &e. 
Unto a 
ball, one night, I 
went, 
And was just enjoying the sport, 
"XIS HARD TO GIVE THE HAND, 
When a 
Policeman grabbed me by the arm, 
Saying: You're wanted down at Court, 
You've escaped us twice; but this 'ere time, 
I'll take care you shan't get free, 
So, I 
was arrested, dragged to jail, 
For the fellow that looks like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I 
like, &a. 
I 
was tried next day, found guilty, too, 
And about to be taken down, 
When another Policeman then brought in 
The right Crimlnal—Mr. Brown. 
They set me five, and locked up him, 
Oh! he was a 
sight to see, 
The ugliest wretch that ever I 
saw, 
Was the fellow that looked like me. 
Oh! wouldn't I

'TS HARD TO GIVE THE HAND. 
WHERE THE HEART CAN NEVER BE. 
Tho' I 
mingle in the throne-, of the happy and 
the 
gay, 
From the mirth of 
dance 
and song, I 
would fain be far away; 
For I 
love to use no wile, and I 
can but deem it sin, 
That the brow would wear a 
smile, when the soul is sad within. 
Tho' a 
parent's stern command claims obedience from me, 
Oh, 'tis bard to give the band, where the heart can never be. 
'Tis hard to give, &c. 
I 
have sighed and suffered long, yet have never told my grief, 
In the hope that for my wrong, time itself will find relief, 
I 
will own no rebel thought, and I 
will not wear the chain, 
That for me must still be fraught, with but misery and pain. 
In all else I 
will be bland, but in this I 
must be free, 
And 
will not give the hand, where the heart can never be. 
And will not give &e.

TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
I 
have wandered by the village, Tom—I've sat beneath the tree, 
Upon the school-house playing-ground, which sheltered you and 
me; 
But none are left to greet me, Tom, and few are left to know 
That played with us upon the green, just Twenty Years Ago. 
The grass is just as green, dear Tom; bare-footed boys at play 
Are sporting just as we were then, with spirits just as gay; 
But master sleeps upon the hill, all coated o'er with snow, 
That afforded us a 
sliding-place, just Twenty Years Ago. 
The old school-house is altered some, the benches are replaced 
By new ones very like the same our pen-knives had defaced; 
But the same old bricks are in the wall, the bell swings to and 
fro, 
The music just the same, dear Tom, 'twas Twenty Years Ago. 
The river is running just as still—the willows on its side 
Are larger than they were, dear Tom, the stream appears less 
wide; 
The grape-vine swing is ruined now, where once we played the 
beau, 
And swung our sweet-hearts, pretty girls, just TwentrYeara 
Ago. 
The spring that bubbled 'neath the hill, close by the spreading 
beech, 
Is very high—'twas once so low that we could almost reach; 
But in kneeling down to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I 
started BO, 
To see how sadly I 
um changed since Twenty Years Ago. 
Down by the spring, upon an elm, you know I 
cut your name— 
Your sweet-heart is just beneath it, Tom—and you did mine 
the same; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark—'twas dying sure, 
but slow, 
Just as the one whose name you cut, did Twenty Years Ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, but tears come in my 
eyes; 
r 
thought of her I 
loved so well—those early brollen ties; 
visited the old church-yard, and took some flowers to strew 
Upon the graves of those we loved, some Twenty Years Aga 
Some are in the church-yard laid, some sleep beneath the sea; 
But few are left of our old class, excepting you and me; 
But when our time shall come, dear Tom, and we are called to 
go, 
hope they'll by to where we played, just Twenty Years Ago.

- THE CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW 
I MET ON TIM TPAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle; it stated: fast he was dying, 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
few things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage>, 
A charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing; 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own? 
She answered in words appearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again! 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was the Charming young widow I 
met on the train, 
As the train it was stopping, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry—Would I 
be so kind 
Iler infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. ' 
To the refreshment room she went into i 
The signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train without startea 
The charming young widow I

On its bosom was sewn a

Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged me bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
how quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound— 
The sweet little creature asleep was, she told me; 
Quite dead asleepso, in truth I 
found. 
I 
took it, and. buried the poor little creature,

Its age or its name I 
could not explain; 
On a

I'M LONELY TO-NIGHT. 
Words and Musk by G. W. II . 
GRIFFEN. 
I 
am lonely to-night, in my sad. little chamber, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear: 
They are gone from their home with the bold fearless ranger, 
There's a 
void in my heart; for, they are not here. 
Oh! why did they leave me alone and deserted, 
To risk their dear lives on the blood-sprinkled plain! 
Should. they never return, this poor heart will soon wither, 
And never know joy or comfort again. 
I 
am lonely to-night, I 
am lonely to-night, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear i 
I 
am lonely, I 
am lonely to-night. 
I 
am lonely to-night, but ere Spring-birds shall warble' 
Their matinal song in the wild forest-tree, 
And the bright limpid brook with sweet music shall babble 
My heart will grow lighter, while thinking of thee 
Then fleet by dull hours, and bring back the loved ones, 
Who parted. from friends with a 
tear moistened eye; 
For, then, this sad. heart will no longer be lonely, 
But joyous and happy as the mild azure sky. 
I 
am lonely, &a 
HOME SWEET HOME. 
'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we-may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home; \ 
A charm from the skies, seems to hallow us there,' 
Which, seek through the world, is n.e'er met with elswhere, 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
There's no place like home. Repeat. 
I 
gaze on the moon, as I 
trace the drear wild; - 
And feel that my parent now thinks of her child; 
She looks on that moon from her own cottage door, 
Through woodbines whose fragrance-shall cheer me no more 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, &c. 
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain, 
0, give me my lowly, thatched cottage again; 
The birds singing gaily that came at my call, 
Give me them with the peace of mind, dearer than all.

LOVE NOT. 
Love not! love not! ye hapless sons of clay, 
Hope's gayest wreaths are made of earthly flowers 
Things that are made to fade and, fall away, 
Ere they have blossom'd for a 
few short hours. 
Love not! love not 
Love not! love not! the thing you love may die, 
May perish from the gay and gladsome earth: 
The silent stars, the blue and smiling sky, 
Beam on its grave, as once upon its birth. 
Love not! love not 1 
Love not! love not! the thing you love may change, 
The rosy lip may cease to smile on you! 
The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange, 
The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true. 
Love not! love not! 
Love not! love not! 0

In present hours, as in years gone by, 
Love flings a

ONE AT HOME WHO PRAYS FOR ME, 
OR, 
WHO HAS NOT A PRAYING MOTHER ? 
Words by H ENRY' M . 
H UNT. 
M usic by H ENRY TUCKER 
At midnight, on my lonely beat, 
When shadow wraps the wood and lea, 
A 
vision seems my view to greet 
Of one at home who prays for me; 
No roses bloom upon her cheek, 
Her form is not a 
lover's dream, 
But o'er that brow so pure and meek, 
A thousand holier beauties gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Who has not a 
praying mother, 
Wheresoe'er his lot may be! 
Ev'ry wand'rer feels in darkest hour 
There's one at home who prays for me. 
How softly shines her silver hair, 
A 
patient smile is on her face, 
And that mild lustrous light of prayer 
Around. her sheds a 
moonlike grace; 
She prays for me so far away— 
The soldier in his holy fight 
And begs that Heaven in mercy may 
Protect her boy and bless the right! 
Who has not, &c. 
Still though the leagues lie far between, 
This silent incense of her heart 
Steals o'er my soul with breath serene, 
And we no longer are apart; 
So guarding thus my lonely beat 
By shadowy wood and haunted lea, 
That vision seems my view to greet 
Of her at home who prays for me. 
Who has not, cto.

Make me a

Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again 'to your heart, as of yore. 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair, 
Over my slumbers yonr loving watch keep,

CHORUS. 
Clasped to your heart, in a 
loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love, like mother-love, ever has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures, 
Faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours. 
None, like a 
mother, can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain; 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart, &c. 
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again, as of old; 
Let it drop over my forehead to-night, 
Shading my faint eyes away from the light, 
For, with its sunny-edged shadows, once more, 
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore, 
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart, &c.

We parted by- the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye! 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
tell me that you love me yet,' 
For, oh I 
the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again!

In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak.

promised that I 
would, be true 
So long as I 
would live ; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Oh! tell me, ea.

THE TALLER, GAL THAT WINKED AT ME. 
Music by M. A. Hintmextrzz. 
Your attention I 
ask for a 
while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. • 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that -winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her name, 
And. she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. - 
So, I'd, dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoOn, abOut three,

And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked me. 
Oh my I 
she looked, ite. 
Oh! you should have seen her, on her wedding day— 
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When the Parson made us one, ah then! the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So, I've bought a 
little place out of town— 
If you go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me.

And I 
keep from the lasses and lads apart, 
In the meadows a-making hay, • - 
But Willie will bring me the first wild-rose 
In my new sun-bonnet to wear; 
And Robin will wait at the keeper's gate; 
For, he follows me everywhere. 
But I 
tell them they needn't come wooing to me 
For my heart—my heart is over the sea. 
Two summers ago, when a 
brave ship sailed. 
Far aW` ay to the golden west, 
Oh! nobody knew that my heart went, too, 
For, the secret I 
ne'er confessed. 
A 
Mother took leave of her boy that day; 
I 
could. hear her sob and. cry, 
As I 
folloived. her back t'o her dreary home, 
But never a

I 
was worthy her sailor-boy. 
My foolish tears they began to flow, 
Though my heart beat high for joy.

When the day was growing late, Willie met me at the gate, 
Ere the stars came to twiirkle in the sky, 
Ere the nightingale was heard, or the evening zephyrs stirred, 
Where the brook sang sweet songs as it ran by. 
But. no song so sweet tome, as my Willie's voic,• can be, 
When he whispers, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate." 
So I 
gladly met him there, where the roses bloomed so fair, 
When the day wastiO quickly growing late.

There's no song so sweet to me, as my Willie's voice can be, 
When he says, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate," 
So I

When the day was so quickly growing late. 
Willie now is far away, and alone I 
often stray, 
To the gate where we parted, that sweet hour. 
Yet I 
know his heart is true, as the sunshine and the dew, 
To the petals of the fragrant summer flower. 
As he whispered in my ear, something sweet for me to bear,

was asked his bride to be, 
Though I 
did not whisper " yea," still I 
did not answer " nay," 
For my thoughts in my face he sure could see.

A downy old cove is our old Tom cat, 
Just turned of thirty years old; 
He eats all the lean and leaves all the fat. 
And won't touch his meals if they're cold, 
His food must be crumbled and not decayed, 
To pleasure his dainty whim, 
And a 
turkey bone that never was touched, 
Makes a 
jolly blow out for him. 
CHORUS. 
Creeping over the tiles so pat, 
And crying " Mew," does our old Tom oat 
Old joints have fled and the bones decayed, 
And the dishes have broken been; 
But old Tom still follows the kitchen maid, 
And slyly licks up all the cream. 
And our old Tom cat in his lonely days 
Will joyfully think of the past, 
And a 
big leg of mutton that never was touched. 
Will be food for my Tommy at last.

Fast he flies tho' he has no wings, 
And a 
sly old soldier is he; 
Close under the window " Mew " he sings, 
" 
Ain't you coming out to-night, love," says he: 
Then slyly he creepeth the gutters all round, 
And his old tail he joyously waves, 
As his lady love from a

Then he sings her his amorous staves.

Tho' dark, raging seas may divide; 
We sigh when we hear your dear name, 
To welcome you back to our side. 
CHORUS. 
We'll -write you a 
letter from home, we dreami of you, darling, 
each night; 
We love you wherever you roam, we'll kiss ev'ry word that we 
write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To bear you our love o'er the sea, 
To gladden your heart as you roam, 
And cheer you wherever you be. 
'Tis lonely while you are away, 
For sweet was the joy that you gave; 
Oh! sadly we pine while you stray; 
Come back o'er the lone weary w

NOT FOB. JOSEPH. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
I, once, was foolish with my tin, but I've paid most dear, 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; ' 
Pm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
cHomrs. 
Oh! dear, no! not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh! no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph—oh I 
dear, no! 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway: but ere I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will: then let it be champagne. 
Spoken.—No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A widow only forty-two: go in, my boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two--well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh! dear, no, not ! &c. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken.- -What a glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country!  What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eye? 
What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh! dear, no, not! &e. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to know: 
So, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe 
Oh! dear, no, not/ &c.

COTTAGE BY THE SEA. 
Childhood's days now pass before me, 
Forms and scenes of long ago; 
Like a 
dream they hover o'er me, 
Calm and bright as evening's glow; 
Days that knew no shade of sorrow, 
When my young heart, pure and free, 
Joyful hailed each coming morrow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
CHORUS. 
In the cottage by the sea, 
In the cottage by the sea, 
Joyful hailed each coining morrow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Fancy sees the rose-trees twining 
Round the old and rustic door, 
And, below, the white beach shining, 
Where I 
gathered shells, of yore;— 
Hears my Mother's gentle warning, 
As she took me on her knee; 
And I 
feel again life's morning, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
In the cottage, 4to 
What though years have rolled above me, 
Though 'mid fairer scenes I 
roam, 
Yet I 
ne'er shall cease to love thee, 
Childhood's dear and happy home! 
And when life's long day is closing, 
Oh! how pleasant would it be, 
On some faithful breast reposing, 
In the cottage by the sea 
In the cottage, &e.

THE PLYING TRAPEZE. 
Once I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn— 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens. 
The girl that I 
loved, she was handsome— 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please; 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well 
Like that man upon the Trapeze. 
CHORUS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A daring young man on the flying Trapeze—. 
His movements were graceful: all girls he could please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was Signor Bona Slang; 
Tall, big and handsome, as well made as Chang; 
Where'er he appeared, the Hall loudly rang--
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below; 
, And, one night, he smiled on my love, 
She winked back at him, and he shouted: Bravo! 
As he hung by his nose up above. [Cironus. 
Her father and mother -were both on my 
side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride. 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail: she went there every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her: how he ran me down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. [Cuoncrs. 
One night, I, as usual, went to her dear home, 
Found there her mother and father alone; 
I 
asked for my love: and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away 
She'd packed up her box and eloped, in the night, 
With him, with the greatest of ease: 
From two stories high, he had lowered her down, 
To the ground on his flying Trapeze! [CmoRUS. 
Some months after this, I 
went to a 
Hall, 
Was greatly surprised to see, on the wall, 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him 1 
MARY OF ARGYLE. 
He taught her gymnastics, and dressed her in tights, 
To help him to live at his ease, 
And made her assume a 
masculine name 
And now she goes on the Trapeze I 
CHORUS. 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease, 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying Trapeze. 
She does all the work, while he takes his ease, 
And that's what's become of my love! 
MARY OF ARGYLE. 
I 
have heard the mavis singing, 
His love-song to the morn, 
I 
have seen the dew-drops clinging, 
To the rose just newly-born; 
But a 
sweeter song has cheered mc, 
At the evening's gentle close, 
I 
have seen an'eye still brighter, 
Than the dew-drops on the rose, 
'Twas thy voice, ray gentle Mary, 
And thine artless, winning smile, 
That made this world an Eden, 
Bonny Mary of Argyle. 
Tho' thy voice may lose its sweetness, 
And thine eye its brightness too, 
Tho' thy step may lose its fleetness, 
And thy hair its sunny hue, 
Still to me shalt thou be dearer, 
Than all the world can own. 
I 
have loved thee for thy beauty, 
But not for that alone. 
I 
have watched thy heart, clear Mary, 
And its goodness was the wile 
That has made thee mine for-
sever, 
Bonny Mary of Argyle.

PRETTY LITTLE SARAH Cat $7 
A WEEK. 
My heart is like a 
pumkin, swollen big with love 
For one of the, fairest girls in creation; 
She is too good for me, though I 
am far above 
The drudgery and ill-paid of my station. 
Her father keeps a 
butcher-shop on the H arl
em 
road; 
For this little vi
rgi
n, of love I've got a 
load, 
I've spent a 
fortune on her; but of that I 
only speak— 
For, what a 
fortune I 
must have on seven dollars a 
week! 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Sarah with the golden hair, 
Her beauty jealous maidens will be scorning: 
She ought to be an angel, and if only rich I 
were, 
I'd marry her.so early in the morning. 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas in the pouring rain, 
I 
proffered her my arm and umbrella; 
She looked with a 
smile; I 
said I'd see her-homs 
She thanked me with a 
voice so low and mellow. 
When we arrived at home, she said, she'd ask me in, 
But her parents they were poor. 
Said I, poverty's no sin. 
No doubt she thought me rich, but of course I 
didn't speak--
For, I 
was doing my heavy on seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, tte. 
She's got a 
littie ankle, she's got a 
little foot, 
And pretty little fingers running taper; 
Her waist is round and small, her mouth is best of all, 
With ruby lips not twice as thick as paper; 
She's always dressed in silks, her notions they are high: 
Although her features small, her bearing's in the sky, 
When she belongs to me, of course, I 
never speak 
What lots of silks she'll get from me on seven dollars a 
week. 
Pretty little Sarah, &c. 
Her parents they are poor, but she's a 
milliner. 
And earns large wages in the city: 
Some she gives her mother for her keep and board, 
The rest she spends on clothes to make her pretty. 
She never saves a 
cent, though to me she says she will; 
To pay the ekpense of marriage is a 
sugar-coated pill; 
And should we have a 
family—but too soon I 
must not speak, 
A wife and fourteen children on seven dollars a 
week! 
Pretty little Sarah, &e. 
WHEN I SAW SWEET NELLIE HOME. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
Hushed the sound of daylight bustle, 
Closed the Pink-eyed Pimper nell. 
As adown the moss-grown wood path 
Where the cattle love to roam, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
CHORUS. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight shone, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
When the Autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all its leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by the elders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nellie told. 
On the star-bespangled dome, 
How I 
blessed the August evening, 
As we stood together gazing, 
'When I 
saw sweet Nellie home. 
In the sky, &c. 
White hairs mingled with my tresses, 
Furrows stealing on my brow, 
But a 
love smile cheers and blesses 
Life's declining moments now. • 
Matron in the snowy kerchief, 
Closer to my bosom come, 
Tell me—dost thou still remember 
When I 
saw thee, sweet Nellie, home P

in the sky, &c.

..UNDEE, THE GASLIGHT; 
OR, 
POOR LITTLE LAURA. 
Words by GEO. COOPER. 
Music by HENRY TOOKER. 
Under the gas-light, while the snow falls, 
And the chill night-wind wearily calls : 
When the lone beggar creeps to his shed, 
And the rich miser lies in his bed: 
Hear little Laura making her Jmoan, 
Poor little orphan-child weeping alone: 
" 
Pity me, stranger, help me, I 
pray— . 
Father and mother have sent me away I" 
Under the gas-light, Laura's asleep, 
While the snow's mantle round her doth creep: 
Louder the night-wind—no help is near, 
No one to calm her, no one to cheer— 
But, in her dreaming, wanders she now 
Where the bright Angels will smooth her fair brow, 
Well: for, the life-tide's ebbing so fast, 
All earthly suffering soon will be past. 
Under the gas-light, rescue is near 
Poor little Laura hush every fear! 
Kind hands have borne thee, far from the storm, 
Up.to yon Mansion kindly and warm. 
Dearer, far dearer love shall be thine, 
Through tears, the Future so brightly will shine, 
Now, among strangers, rest thy worn feet, 
Poor little orphan-child found in the street
