Be gentle. 
I'll be very gentle. All right. You want to get started? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Please tell me your name and your job title. 
Anonymous. Joseph Anzalone. I'm a A journeyman. 
You're an A journeyman. Where do you live, Joe? 
[00:00:30] Franklin Square, Long Island. I just purchased a house in Long Beach. 
You purchased a house in Long Beach. 
Yes. 
Are your parents from Long Beach? 
No, they're from Franklin Square. Oh, they're from Brooklyn, actually, but they 
live in Franklin Square. 
They live in Franklin Square. Cool. What's your background? 
Background, ethnicity background? 
Sure. Is that what comes to mind first when you think of it? 
I don't know. What else would come to mind? 
I don't know. You're a New Yorker. 
New Yorker, yeah. [00:01:00] I'm a Long Islander but Italian background, really. 
You have an Italian- 
My whole family's Italian, Sicilian Italian.

Surfing, skating, fishing, mountain biking, snowboarding. 
You're full of things and making music. 
Music. 
Music. 
Yeah, writing. 
I know a lot about your music. Your parents are from Brooklyn [00:01:30] and 
you're an A mechanic. What type of jobs does your division do? What type of 
work does A mechanics do? 
I guess we do anything from pipe work, anything involving electric work really. I 
mean I could be building racks to support electric work or it could be just 
installing electric work, running wires, terminating. 
[00:02:00] Is it residential work? Is it commercial work? 
Oh, it's commercial, residential, everything. Is more than commercial and 
residential? 
Is it more than commercial? 
[inaudible 00:02:14] category. Is there a third category or is it just commercial, 
residential? 
I think commercial and- 
Boats I guess would be another category. 
Do we do boats? 
I don't think we do boats. 
We don't do boats. 
That's a whole different division. 
I think that's a different local altogether.

I don't do, my division doesn't do street lighting [00:02:30] really, like the high 
voltage street lighting. We do street lamp but not the high voltage lamp. 
Then we also do subway work and stuff like that, right? 
Yeah, subway work, transit. I guess that would be another one. Is that 
commercial? 
I think that's commercial. 
Transit, I don't know. 
What jobs have you had before this industry? 
I worked- 
Did you have any? 
Yeah, yeah, [00:03:00] yeah. I had odd jobs. 
No, I mean did you come in straight and [crosstalk 00:03:04] or- 
No, no, no. My first job, aside from doing work for family members and stuff like 
that, it was like KB Toys I worked for. 
KB Toys. 
I worked for a toy store. 
What did you do in the toy store? 
I did stock, I did boxed, I did everything. I helped people get stuff, like pick 
things out. I did cash register and all that. 
Seems like the perfect kind of job for you. 
I had a good time. I had a good time. [00:03:30] I also worked as a estimator for 
my father's electrical company. 
You worked as a estimator? 
Yeah, I started off low, just take off lights, receptacles, all that stuff on [crosstalk 
00:03:43] estimate how much the job would cost and then I would get more 
deep into it, send out for fire alarms, send out pricing for switch gear or send 
out pricing for lights and all that stuff. I'd get it all priced together and take care 
of his insurances and [00:04:00] stuff like that. A lot of office work, the office 
end of the electrical field or a contractor but, yeah.

Does any of that prior work ever come to ... 
No. 
... play as an electrician? Would you ever be like- 
Does it help me as a working journeyman? No. 
Do you- 
I'll just say it gives you appreciation for... Working as a journeyman would help 
your estimating but estimating doesn't help you working as a journeyman. Does 
that make sense? 
[00:04:30] Yeah. No, no. You're saying like an estimator has a hardertime 
gauging what something might cost because they're not out there. 
What something might cost or how to, yeah, how to figure it into a price 
because they're not physically ever doing it. They never did it, never worked on 
something like that. It takes somebody who's worked in the field might say, 
"You need a light here." Somebody in the field might say, "How high is the 
ceiling? Where's my access [00:05:00] points, this and that?" Whereas an 
estimator might say, "Okay, they need a light. That's this much money. That'll 
take about a half hour to do one light. That's what it usually costs," and stuff like 
that but if you're a worker you kind of think about it more because you've been 
in the situation. 
Yeah. 
[inaudible 00:05:12]? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean you know that there's obstacles and not everything is 
like- 
Yeah, nothing's a perfect a world in the field but it often is figured that on 
pa pe r. 
Yeah, paper is definitely different than the actual job site itself. Those [00:05:30] 
are the jobs that you had prior to this. You said your father- 
A full time student. 
A full time student, I mean that sounds like a workload. What were you 
studying? 
I worked for him being an estimator while I was going to college a lot so in 
between classes I would go work for him and stuff like that.

I started out studying audio recording technology for doing recording music and 
stuff like that. I figured it would help me and my band back in the day, help me 
out recording and [00:06:00] get me some free recordings hopefully because 
that was really expensive back then. Nobody was using pro tools on a computer. 
It was just starting and all that, those programs were expensive so I was doing a 
lot of that and figured I could make money doing that but it got boring. 
You said that your dad was an electrician or- 
Correct, yeah. 
He's a- 
He's a contractor. 
A contractor so he oversees an electrical shop kind of? 
Yeah, he owns an electrical shop. 
[00:06:30] He also had his hands in the field, too. 
He started out working for... 
Was he a local- 
... my grandfather who was in the union. Then when he was done working with 
my grandfather who was my mother's dad, not his dad. He worked for Forest as 
Forest Electric, another Local Three contractor as a project manager and then 
from project manager he didn't like being told what to do and all that stuff by 
everybody. You know it is getting bossed around like that [00:07:00] so he 
wanted to start his own shop and he did. 
Is it a Local Three shop? 
It is. It was. It was. It was for a longtime. It was for about 25 years and he just 
recently left. 
Was he ever in the local? 
Yeah, Local Three for like 25 years about [inaudible 00:07:14]. 
As a project manager, he- 
He was a project manager for Forest in local and as-

As a contractor he was Local Three. Contractor's like- 
He neverwent throughthe apprenticeship oranything. 
No. He came in through my grandfather. When they got organized he came in 
and got [00:07:30] organized. 
Oh, okay. 
He might have had a harder time working for my grandfather, to be honest with 
you. 
Why is that? 
Working for family, you know, they take advantage of you a lot. There's two 
different types. There's the type that you get away with everything, Jimmy 
Junior, and there's the type that... they put everything on you and that's the 
type I've always had and a lot of that is old school Italian mentality, work, work, 
work, work. [00:08:00] That was bestowed on him, bestowed on me. It sucks. 
He bestows that type of... 
Yeah, he does that to me all the time. 
...on you. Oh my gosh. Is that you became an electrician, by your father or- 
Yeah, I became an electrician through him, yeah, because I didn't have anything 
else really lined up. He suggested just fill out the paperwork. They might not call 
you for another year, two years, three years, whatever it is. I said, "All right, I'll 
fill out the paperwork. If I don't figure anything out by then I'll jump [00:08:30] 
in. I'll see what's up," and I know that it's a good job, benefits and wages are 
good, you know, once you work your way up to that point. Working with hands 
is different people will work with hands, will work out of offices. It's who you 
are, I guess, really that make you want to do that because not everybody would 
work with their ha nds like that. 
No. Definitely not, especially those musician [00:09:00] hands. Were you 
worried about that? 
[crosstalk 00:08:59] very valuable, very valuable. 
In all levels. He led you in that direction. 
Yeah.

Then you filled out all the paperwork so you went through the apprenticeship. 
You didn't- 
I [crosstalk 00:09:15] gone through the whole entire apprenticeship. 
You didn't- 
No, I wish I could've not. 
You didn't get organized then and what does getting organized mean? 
Getting organized means as a non union shop, [00:09:30] you're doing work non 
union everywhere, and your shop wants to join the union. The union does like 
this because they want more work to go with the union. They want to build the 
union and they will test certain guys that you have. You want to bring in your 
guys because your guys have been working for you all these years. You want to 
bring in yourguys. You know they know what they're doing but the union 
doesn't know they know what they're doing so they'll run them through a 
couple of tests, [00:10:00] make sure they do know what they're doing and stuff 
like that. Then they could come in at A rate but at a different level and they 
have to take the A test and everything and still make their way to that A level. 
What's the different level- 
Difference between M at A rate and A rate, I don't really know. 
Is it baskets or- 
I think it has to do with benefits and I think it might also have to do with being a 
foreman. I don't know if you could be a foreman as an M guy. 
At A rate. 
Yeah. 
Those are the two- 
I think those are [00:10:30] the two things that kind of are the [crosstalk 
00:10:33]. 
Then they take- 
Unless you pass your A test, I think if you take your A test you have the chance 
to get the A. You take the M out of the [inaudible 00:10:44]. 
Would they take the same A test as someone going through the apprenticeship?

What is your current job site like? Where are you working? 
Oh [00:11:00] my god. 
That's a good start. 
I'm working I believe at Hudson Yard. 
Hudson Yards. 
It's a big job. There's a lot of things going on over there but I'm in the retail 
section so it's like a higher end mall going up and we're doing that. It's about 10 
floors and it's on the water. All the walls are open. It's cold in the winter. It's hot 
in the summer. 
Oh man. 
It's dirty. 
Is it? 
It's dangerous. It's dirty. You got to be aware at all times. 
[00:11:30] It's dangerous and dirty. Have you ever, what do you mean it's 
dangerous and dirty? 
You got to watch out for the floors. On a construction site everything gets 
abused. Your ramps to go up from one floor to another, stuff like that, moving 
material, things get abused, holes in the ground. 
Oh gosh. 
Yeah. You're supposed to cover them up with certain things but somebody 
might cover it with something else, somebody might not cover it. Somebody do 
the right thing, somebody [00:12:00] could come along after them and move it 
and never move it back. You got to just be aware of your surroundings, really. 
Okay. Do they offer you any other, like an OSHA classes that you have to take 
or- 
Oh, you mean like safety requirements ...

... for the job. Yes. 
For [crosstalk 00:12:20]. 
They have their insurance purpose safety requirements, yeah. 
Do you have to wear glasses, hardhats? 
You have to wear glasses. You have to wear a [00:12:30] hardhat and you have 
to wear high visibility colors. If you're on a lift you have to wear a harness. 
Oh wow. 
If you're above a six-foot ladder you have to wear a harness. 
Six-foot ladder? 
Yeah, it's like after six-foot ladder. It's like eight-foot ladder you got to wear a 
harness or something like at which is kind of pointless if you think about it 
because you got to climb up to clip off and then climb back down and climb 
back up to clip off again. 
Oh my god. 
It just doesn't make sense but it covers their insurance and they save money. It 
comes down to that. 
Is this a regular type of [00:13:00] ... Local Three job? Is this like a regular- 
It all depends on really the GC, the general contractor really who implements 
that. A lot more contractors, GCs, are doing this to get insurance cuts. They 
claim it's for your own good. They say they care about you but they don't care 
about the air quality. They care about whether you're wearing [00:13:30] your 
glasses or your high visibility colors. It really does nothing. 
Air quality seems pretty important. 
Yeah but that's what they kind of don't take care of. 
They never do. 
Yeah. 
Is it a regular type of day? Is it like a-

It's a eight-hour day which usually you do a seven-hour day but it's a PLA 
agreement. 
It's a PLA agreement. 
Yeah, with the PLA agreement you lose holidays. Fortunately, we don't lose pay. 
[00:14:00] Oh, nice. 
It's a full rate. 
Okay. 
Which is good but we lose holidays. We lose seven hour day, it's eight hours and 
I think that's really it with the PLA. We have to scan in, scan out with a card 
which they say is for security. It's not. 
It's not? 
They already went back to the boss. When they say we're not allowed to use it 
for time, this and that, they went back to our owner and sent in, "This person 
coming in late all the time, we're not paying [00:14:30] him because these 
people are leaving early, this person coming in," and they all get in trouble 
meanwhile they're not supposed to do that. 
Wow. 
It's not cool. 
That is kind of- 
They're pretty sneaky and they get away with everything but... 
What do you GC is this? 
... God forbid you're on the lift minding your own business working and you 
don't have maybe a harness on, meanwhile you're safely enclosed on a 
platform. They'll kick you off the job for a couple days, make you take a urine 
test, see if you're doing drugs and all this shit. It's crazy. 
Oh my gosh. That's wild. 
They make it very, very ... 
[00:15:00] They make this fun. 
... difficult to be able to just do your job and go home.

It's both of them. [ 00:15:18]. 
... like a fun job. Isthere anythingyou like about your current job? 
The pay. 
[00:15:30] Is there a certain hour? 
I like doing pipe work. I'm doing... 
Oh, so you're doing pipe work. 
... big pipe. I'm doing big pipe work which big pipe for us is really four-inch, 
three-inch. That's considered big for us. I've worked with bigger. I've worked 
with six-inch and there is five-inch but I'm working with four and three and 
anything below that and I'm building out closets myself, according to a set of 
plans. It's not bad. I don't mind, with pipe work, it starts- 
What do you mean you're building out [00:16:00] closets? 
The closets control the electric power. There's four closets on a floor and they 
control over the entire floor and I got to build them out according to the panel, 
the distribution panels, the transformers and everything in between to run the 
floors. I prep all that so that when the guys come to pull the wire in they're 
ready to go and set up and just connect everything. 
Wow. Is using large [00:16:30] pipe typical for most electricians or is this like a 
rare opportunity that... 
It depends on the type of job. If you're going to a job that's a office renovation 
or a smaller, maybe a smaller building would use it but not so much of it. This 
building has tons and tons and tons of it.

Most of the job is around ... 
Are you working by yourself or with ... 
I started off at MU at this job and [00:17:00] I was working with a journeymen 
and a couple of months before I turned an A mechanic I was put by myself with 
an apprentice to do the closets so I worked like that for a little while and I still 
have the same apprentice now as a journeyman. I turned out and I kept 
[inaudible 00:17:19] still there. 
How many years have you been working as a electrician, you'd say? 
I guess [00:17:30] six and a half years, seven years. 
Throughout this, so you worked previously on little stuff. What was your 
training like? Were you prepared to go into this Hudson Yards and do four-inch 
pipe or- 
Forthis job persay... 
I mean like in general. 
... in general? 
I guess we could go specifically. Were you ready to take that task [00:18:00] on? 
Were you familiar enough with prints? How did you learn or... 
The prints, actually maybe that's one thing that estimating does help you out 
with although I did take architecture for a few years, too, which helped me with 
prints because I used to draw them so that helps with prints, too. I guess being 
familiar with them- 
What about the pipe being? 
Yeah. That's what I'm saying, reading the print to bend the pipe. I guess you 
could say I was familiar [00:18:30] with it on a smaller scale and I kind of 
transposed it to a larger scale. 
How'd you learn that smaller scale? 
It's not easy to do that because it's a lot harder to do the bigger stuff because 
you don't have as much forgiving ending with it. Yeah. I don't know. You know 
what I'm saying. 
Okay. There's not much forgiveness in working with-

Joseph Anzalone: 
If you over bend something you could bend it back a little bit with a thinner 
pipe, a smaller pipe. [00:19:00] Say upto two-inch, two and a half inch you 
might be able to bend it back by hand. With a three-inch, a four-inch, you don't 
get that forgiveness. If you over bend it you really can't use it and that's an 
expensive piece of pipe. The owner- 
How much are one of those pieces? 
One piece of pipe, I don't know. I'm a crappy estimator obviously. I never 
estimated a big job like that. My dad was small time but I could [00:19:30] 
imagine being close to 100. 
How much is a small pipe, do you think? 
Dude, I haven't done that in like 10 years. I don't really know. Honestly, I have 
no idea. Not even half as much, though. You get a bundle which is 10 for the 
cost of one pipe for a four-inch probably. 
Do you think about how precious that- 
You do but at the same time you can't let it drive you crazy but sometimes 
[00:20:00] time costs more than material so if you waste time trying to fix 
something that you already messed up you end up costing the company more 
money. Maybe you could use that piece later on to cut up and use it for a 
smaller piece that you need somewhere else and as long as you're conscientious 
in that aspect you don't waste anything and they like that, the owners. The 
foreman, the owner, it helps out if you're conscious about that. 
Do you ever get [00:20:30] accolades or compliments for the work that you do? 
Depends on the foreman. 
Yeah, what- 
You've got your foreman who used the positive reinforcement. You got ones 
that only have negative things to say. It all depends on the guy, really. I mean 
you could tell even a guy who has negative things to say, if you did a good job by 
them not saying anything at all. You could tell that that's actually a good thing in 
disguise but then you got guys that they'll you you did [00:21:00] a good job. If 
you didn't they'll tell you you didn't do a good job and I like that. I like honesty 
[inaudible 00:21:05]. I get other guys who I just work with who will say it's good 
and this and that. 
That's enough. 
Yeah, it helps because we help each other in that aspect. Yeah.

Oh, the workers in general. Yeah, like the other A journeymen and apprentices 
and MIJs. 
Can you recall the [00:21:30] first day you worked in the local? 
As a T-A-one. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I could recall that. 
Okay. Could you talk about it a little bit or... 
You got to bring that up? 
What happened? What shop were you with or... 
I'll tell you that story. 
Oh gosh. Please do. 
It was a horrible day. 
Why was it a horrible day? 
That was probably one of the worst days of my life. 
Okay, please explain. 
Just the [00:22:00] whole thing. First off, I got to a job and none of the guys 
were answering their phone, the foreman that I had. He wasn't answering his 
phone at all and he was in the basement I guess with no service so I didn't have 
no idea where to go, how to get there. I didn't see anybody else. Finally I find 
so me bo dy- 
Where was this? 
This was Lexington Hotel. Why do I remember that? That's crazy. 
Perfect. 
B&G was the company. 
Okay.

I go downstairs. They've got another guy from [00:22:30] a different trade, says, 
"Oh yeah, BNG, they're set up downstairs somewhere," so he take me down 
there and I met the foreman and he had no idea I was even supposed to be 
there so I got all my tools. It was cold out. It was February 14th, Valentine's Day, 
I remember because I got shit for that... heavy jacket and all that shit. I seen the 
guy there. He had no idea I was coming, no idea. 
The foreman. 
Yeah. He's trying to come up with something for [00:23:00] me to do and now 
I'm running all over this hotel. I don't know when break is. He doesn't tell me so 
I end up working through break. I don't know when lunch is so I end up just 
taking lunch at like 12. It's supposed to be 11:45 so I took it at 12 and I didn't 
even know where to go. I got some, I came back and he tells me after I come 
back from lunch. He goes, "All right, you're getting transferred to another job 
because I don't even need you here." I said, "Okay. Great, man. Thanks." On 
[00:23:30] top of that I have school that night so now I have my bag. I have my 
jacket and all my other stuff and my backpack and I just got transferred but I 
have to go to school. I have until five o'clock to go to school and I figured I was 
close enough to school to walk there, 66th Street or whatever it was ... 
This is ... 
... and I was up on 50-something. 
... school for college or is this- 
No, school for the union. This is the apprenticeship [00:24:00] theory class, they 
call that. I had to go there after and I had to carry my tools there and my jacket 
and everything and I remember walking through Central Park, getting lost, doing 
a full circle and ending up right back where I started. 
No! 
I was sweating and there was snow out and there was slush and I'm walking 
through the worst conditions. I'll neverforget that. It was horrible. I walked 
through one more time and I ended up taking this extra long way and getting 
almost kind of lost again, [00:24:30] being extremely pissed off and just making 
it to school so now I'm sore, I'm hot. I got bags and tools and all this stuff, 
whatever. I get to class. I'm chilling in class and I have this killer headache. I'm 
tired because I didn't even sleep the night before. I got out to get on that extra 
five whatever train, 5:50 train, wake up extra early. I'm not used to that. Sucks 
and- 
Waking [00:25:00] up early. 
Yeah. I mean I woke up early ...

It sounds like it's not but when you wake up at that time it is, in my- 
No, I mean I very much agree that that's early. 
Yeah and that's not even early for half of these guys. Some of these guys coming 
out from farSuffolk County at like four o'clock, 4:30 in the morning and waking 
up 3:30 in the morning. I don't even [00:25:30] wake up maybe to use the 
bathroom at that time and get a glass of water and they're getting in their car 
and driving to the train. Are you out of your mind? What kind of life is that? 
It's a hard life I feel. 
[crosstalk 00:25:43] to the city, yea h. I'm at the school and they tell us, "We're 
going to give you some books." Okay, great. Going to get books. I walk across 
the street to get the books and they give us this huge cardboard box with at 
least 20 books in it, textbooks, [00:26:00] workbooks, little books, big books, 
heavy, heavy box. Now I go back and I have a train. I have a train to catch. We 
get to leave at 8:20 I think it was. I have a 8:42 train to get home. The next train 
after that, 9:42. 
9:42. 
Yeah, is that [inaudible 00:26:21]? 
[inaudible 00:26:22]. 
After that I have a 9:42 so that's a hour if I miss that. I [00:26:30] ask a couple 
guys I just met, I said, "Who's going back to Penn? Let's get a cab together. We 
got all these books, instead of running to the subway and trying to do ..." Not 
only that but I had my backpack. I had my tools and I had my three jackets 
because I thought it was going to be cold. Guy didn't tell me if it was going to be 
an outside job or not. Guy didn't answer his phone the night before. I go to Penn 
Station. I get back to Penn Station. I start running for the train because I'm 
about four minutes away from missing [00:27:00] it and I don't want to miss it. I 
run out of the cab. I start running through with the other guys, running through 
Penn Station and I got my tool bag on top of the box, my backpack on, the 
jacket on everything like a big mess and I have a headache. I'm runningforthis 
train so I don't miss it and the whole bottom of the box just shoots out and 
these books go across the entire Penn Station floor. People are kicking them and 
shit. 
Oh my god.

Oh man, asking the big questions. 
"I hate this city." 
Were you ever in the city prior to- 
Yeah. Not for work. I used to come every single week for shows. I used to go to 
concerts. Anyway, I missed that train, had to wait another hour for the next one. 
I didn't get home until 10. 
Then you had to start the day over. 
Had to start all over again in a new spot the next day. It wasn't fun. 
That's a pretty crazy [00:28:00] first day kind of story. 
Yeah, it sucked. 
You take electrical theory for classes but can you explain your learning process 
for this career that you put yourself into? Are you more ... was it book 
orientated for you or was it more like hands-on type of... 
I'll tell you what it is. 
You tell me what it [00:28:30] is. 
I'll tell you what the is. If you really want to know. 
I want to know. 
There are two aspects of it. The mandated learning, book learning aspect of it 
which is good to know but when you're in the field it's a totally different type of 
learning. As an apprentice working with other journeymen, working with other 
apprentices and that's where you really learned a trade. You don't learn the 
trade on paper in a classroom [00:29:00] after work. After working all day, being 
completely tired, you have to go to class from five to 8:30 and I had Monday 
nights. I had to do that every single Monday night and you have Monday nights. 
We had to do that every single Monday and it would just kill you for the rest of 
the week because you'd be shot by the time you got home. At least you'd get 
home a little bit earlier. I'll get home at like 10:30 and then I'd have to shower, 
maybe eat something. 11 o'clock, by the time you go to bed it's almost 12, 
11:30,12 o'clock [00:29:30] and you got to do it all over again the next day plus 
then they'd send you to college during the week. Not as late but still had an 
impact on you, if you ask me

that a company would find you ... reliable and what's the word I'm looking for? 
Give me something. 
[00:30:00] You're... 
Valuable. Thank you. Thank you forthat. 
You're welcome for nothing. 
Valuable would be I learn more of those in the field. The skills that a owner and 
a company would find more valuable- 
What would some of those skills be that a company would find valuable? What 
Working at a good pace, getting things done and being able to work with 
[00:30:30] the material, problem solve and bend pipe and stuff like that. You 
learn that in the field and that's what gets the job done. We learn all this stuff in 
the class. We learn all this stuff about calculating loads and this and that and 
that is totally good to know. I would never put that down at all but the fact of 
that is is that they have an engineer that does that. Even if you come up with 
that load and you tell them that this is what it is, they're not going to listen to 
you anyway [00:31:00] because they have a procedure, protocol, they got to go 
back to the engineer and they got to do it anyway. You could fail that class, 
meanwhile and you could be the best pipe bender, betterthan any journeyman 
on the job, and you will fail and you'll get left back and you might never even 
make it to that point which is ridiculous. 
Totally. 
It's meant to help and meant to make us smarter and this and that and I think it 
does but at the same time I think it has too much impact on [00:31:30] your job 
rather than maybe more and I know that they are doing more hands-on classes 
now. I think that's better for us because- 
You think hands-on- 
I took some hands-on classes with the union. Every once in a while they would 
send you to hands-on class and that's the most I learned in class. 
In class. 
Yeah.

Joseph Anzalone: 
In my opinion. 
Yeah, otherwise it's you're in the field working with another... 
Yeah. 
... electrician. 
Learning through working with people and even that could be detrimental to 
your learning because if you learn from [00:32:00] the wrong guy, some guys 
don't do the right job. Some guys, not a lot but some guys, there's others that 
are better than them. 
How do you find those? Do you get thrown in with those guys or can you choose 
those guys that you want to gravitate towards or... 
Sometimes you just get brought into it... 
Is it just you? 
... because it's your foreman that tells you who to work with. If you don't like 
the way this guy's working you can kind of tell. As a first year, second year, third 
year, as a first [00:32:30] year and second year you might not know but the 
more mix amount of guys that you work with and it's good to get thrown 
around to work with different people because you learn more that way. This guy 
could be putting a pipe one way and this guy could be putting up this way and it 
comes out the same but it might be better to do it the way the second guy did 
it. 
For you, maybe. 
Now you learn that and you use that later on. You know what I'm saying? 
He might have you taught you a way that you're more comfortable with than 
the [00:33:00] other guy. 
Yeah.

What did you do. 
I did electrical work [crosstalk 00:33:11]. 
Not to go back but... 
He asked me if I know anything. I said, "Yeah, I know a little bit," because I 
worked with my father. I would do family members' houses, stuff like that, 
change the ceiling fan, put a outlet in, do my own house with him [00:33:25], 
little things. He goes, "Oh, you know how to splice." [00:33:30] First I was just 
distributing fixtures and stuff all throughout this hotel. I think it was the 
Lexington Hotel. I was just distributing fixtures outside of the proper rooms and 
stuff which needs to be done. I get it. You're going to put the cheapest guy on to 
do that, the one that knows nothing. It makes sense but he asked me to splice 
stuff so I spliced it and whatever. He said, "Okay, you know what you're doing." I 
didn't really know what I was doing, [00:34:00] I kind of faked it but I did pretty 
good at it. Fooled him. 
You were- 
[crosstalk 00:34:00]. 
You weren't working with another- 
No, I was by myself. 
That day. 
I was in a room with a bunch of other guys but I was by myself doing that. 
You had your own task to do- 
Yeah, I had my own task. 
Was there ever a location or maybe even a tool? You were working with big 
pipe. Was there ever something you were intimidated by or... 
Yeah, I was intimidated one time until I used it and I'll tell you what that is. I was 
working at Rikers Island. 
[00:34:30] Oh, Rikers Island.

there.

Three, [crosstalk 00:34:35], three. 
Rikers Island. Okay. 
Really. We would drive on there and we had our own separate area in the back 
where we were doi ng a new power pla nt a nd we ha d to- 
They have their own ... 
A power plant, yeah. 
... separate... 
Yeah, their own power... 
... power. 
... system, I guess. Yeah. 
Wow, okay. 
We were helping them with that. We were doing that and I was with ADCO at 
the time. I was second year apprentice [00:35:00] and we had these big lifts 
because once the job, the building started going up we had to use these big 
turtle lifts, not the articulated lift, not the scissor lift. They can go up like 60, 80 
feet up into the air and you can spin the bucket a certain ways but they sway 
when you're up there. 
What? 
You don't feel safe right away, especially if somebody else is [00:35:30] driving. 
Okay> Oh, so this is a two man- 
It's a two man, you would put two people in there, yeah. Once I started using 
them, at first I was nervous with them, once I started using them I was like the 
other guys didn't even want to drive them. They let me drive it because I'll put it 
anyway you need to be. I was the best with it. I loved it. I had fun. It was like 
because you have to use different angles and different techniques to get into 
different spots it was kind [00:36:00] of fun. Instead of just driving it into one 
spot you got to lift a certain thing, drop a certain other way, turn this, tilt that 
and get it into where you got to go. Those are tight spots.

You just problem solved. 
I just figured it out. I played around with it on the ground level and the guy 
showed me this, this, this, this or this [crosstalk 00:36:21]. 
Who showed you? 
Another journeyman who was familiar with it, not that they'd done it a lot but 
now I can say I did it [00:36:30] five years ago, about four years ago. I could say 
I've done it. I would have to get re-acclimated to it but it wouldn't take me as 
long as learning it from start. 
No. 
I haven't touched it in a while either but I was with a guy who did it like that. 
He's used it before. Also over there, I had to drive a big box truck. One of the 
guys, what happened is there was two journeyman and myself and a foreman. 
One of the guys was in the hole doing work [00:37:00] and the other 
journeyman was backing the truck up to drop stuff off into the hole. I'm hitting 
on the truck telling him to stop backing up and he almost drove the truck right 
on top of this other guy and he was very shooken and he never wanted to drive 
the truck again. So guess who got to drive the truck everywhere now. 
Oh my gosh. 
I've never drove an extended, extra long box truck with an extended lift gate at 
the back and I had to drive this around the island [00:37:30] all the time and I 
did and I didn't care anymore. You got to just eat it up sometimes. This guy was 
a horrible driver to begin with, though. 
[inaudible 00:37:39]. 
He was a horrible car driver. I've been in a car with him.

like that and I didn't experience any of that because I was outside the whole 
time. 
Oh, you were outside the [00:38:00] whole time. 
I've never been so cold or so hot in my life. The building I'm at now is very cold 
in the winter but Rikers Island, I was never been so cold before. We were right 
on the water. The wind would just whip through to the point where you can't 
even do anything. You're just crippled. 
Like you're- 
Frozen. 
How could you hold anything? 
You can't. 
You can't hold- 
You just stand out there trying to work but you just can't do it so a lot of the 
times if it was that cold our foreman would give us easy simple things to do, 
maybe stuff that [00:38:30] we could do inside to build so that we could set it 
up for later, stuff to prep and ... 
Knock it out and stuff. 
... we would do what we can with the conditions. 
Yeah. Do you have a typical day at work at this point? 
Yes and no, I guess. At this job? 
Yeah. 
At this job it could be pretty typical sometimes because I'm going into the same 
closet I was in yesterday until I get to a new one, until [00:39:00] I finish that. 
It's pretty repetitious. 
It's pretty repetitious in that aspect but every once in a while you get thrown. 
You can't do this closet because they didn't paint or they didn't pour a

[00:39:10] pad or they didn't do this so they throw you into something else for 
two days and you get acclimated to that and finally you start doing it and then 
they're like, "Okay, go back into the closet. They're ready, get going." You're like, 
"Okay, let me reset up for that now because it's a completely different type of 
way." For the most part it's typical, for the most but every once in a while you 
get [00:39:30] thrown into the mix. 
Thrown a loop or something like that. 
Yeah, where your partner's not in, you need somebody else. 
Can you tell me about your coworkers or is there a specific demographic on this 
job? Are they all A mechanics? Are they all... 
Because it's an eight-hour job, as a MU you have to work eight hours so there is 
a decent amount of MIJs on the job ... which is good. They do give the guys 
freedom and ... [00:40:00] a chance to learn and really work on their own and 
stuff like that so it's good ... 
That's awesome. 
... because you get to kind of transition from a apprentice MU to journeyman 
when you finally turn out. There are a lot of guys on the job right now. There 
were like 80 at one point. I don't know if there's still- 
80 people. 
Yeah. They split us up into four or five crew really. 
That's just your... 
That's just my shop, yeah, so they're all working for Zwicker[00:40:28]. You got 
one general [00:40:30] foreman, five sub foremen with a number of guys in 
each of their crew. I don't know how many each have but my foreman has like 
10 guys, maybe. Another foreman could have 20 because they're upstairs doing 
something. Another guy has like five guys. It's crazy. 
Wow. Is there a particular thing that you feel you excel at or... 
I [00:41:00] excel at everything.

Is there a ny skill necessary for doing the pipe work? 
Math, general... general feeling for physics, I guess. 
What do you mean by that? 
Some guys just don't understand [00:41:30] when you bend it here it changes it 
over here and stuff like that, like the way to fit something as a puzzle piece. 
What are you using to bend the pipes since it's so large? 
The bigger pipe, we use what's called a table bender. It's a hydraulic press 
bender with a shoe and a slide. 
Did you learn that... 
You have to use a protractor. We did learn that... 
... from school? 
... with the hands-on but we learned that two days out of five years [00:42:00] 
ago and then you don't use it for five years, you really don't remember it. 
[crosstalk 00:42:04]. 
I learned it more on another job when one of those guys, and I try to do this 
with some of the apprentices, "Come over here, I'll show you how to use this so 
that you know for the future." I may [crosstalk 00:42:15] ... 
Did you ask him? 
You won't remember but at least you'll know a little bit. I try to do that with any, 
if I see an apprentice around I'll ask somebody that wants to learn and stuff like 
that. Some guys will ask me. I've had apprentices ask me, "How do you use 
this?" And this and that. I said, "Come here, I'll show you." 
Did you have to set it up? 
Yeah, I set it up, break it down [00:42:30] every other time. I'll set it up and I'll 
come back to bend another piece of pipe and somebody has changed it to four- 
inch. I need it for three-inch, then they change it. I got to change it back. 
What are they changing?

Every time. 
I mean, depending on if you're working on different size pipes. 
Yeah. 
Have you ever had an like, "This is out of my hands," kind of moment at work? 
[00:43:00] Like print changes or like you ... 
Like, "I can't do this anymore." 
Not like, "I can't do," I mean like a ... 
Like a you need help with something. 
You need help or something happens and you do this whole pipe run and then 
something... 
Something's wrong. 
... or something's wrong or someone changes it or... 
Yeah. [00:43:30] They change prints all the time on this job. They change- 
Like after you've done stuff. 
After I've done stuff, yeah. I have to go back and minimal stuff. I wouldn't say 
big stuff, minimal stuff, nothing crazy but... nothing I could really complain that 
much about because you also, you're still there. That's your job and they need 
you to do that. Yeah, it's annoying to take down what you just did but, you 
know what, as long as it's not my fault, [00:44:00] whatever I got to do I'll do. 
You know what I'm saying? 
Have you ever been injured on the job? 
Seriously injured, no. Injured, yeah. 
What might be like a not serious injury? 
I put a zippy through my hand once. 
Oh, that's good.

That kind of stuff. I cut open my arm with a threaded rod. 
Oh, wow. 
I cut [00:44:30] my eye, right below my eye a few times. I dropped some stuff 
on my foot, heavy, heavy, heavy stuff. 
How does that happen? 
Just accidents, you know. 
Yeah. 
You're holding something. You pick something up and something else falls out 
and you don't know. It could be anything, really. It could be somebody else that 
drops something on you and you didn't even know. They could be working 
above you. They could be working next to you. It's hard to stay safe sometimes 
but... 
[00:45:00] Everfalloff a ladder? 
Yeah, I did. I got blown up off a ladder once. 
Blown up off a ladder. 
Yeah, that was fun. 
How did you get blown up off a ladder? 
I was working, actually. I was working in a ceiling and it was my fault but I was 
working in a occupied ceiling for a company that was, they had cubicles all over 
and they were there. We just had to go back and fix a couple of things that 
weren't done. [00:45:30] All the lighting is done at 277 volts. That's considered 
high voltage for us, really, because we usually work with 110. We had to change 
these little lights out, the test lights for the emergency fixtures because they 
weren't lighting up. We shut the circuit down and they were all dead but 
somebody must've accidentally wired one on the wrong circuit so I was doing 
five of them. I tested four [00:46:00] before I cut them. I cut it and everything 
was fine. I got to the fifth one. I didn't test it beca use I tested the first four. I 
didn't think I needed to. I cut it and it blew up right in my face. I never 
experienced something so quick. I mean, you get into a car accident you could 
kind of put your hands up really quick. You get a punch thrown at you or 
something you could kind of block it maybe. This happened so fast as soon 
[00:46:30] as the metal of my pliers slightly came in contact with it it just blew 
up... 
Nipped it.

Oh, you felt it? 
Yeah, it hurt. It felt like somebody took a hammer to my wrists. 
Really? 
I got blown back kind of and I fell off of the eight-foot ladder into the occupied 
office space and everybody was kind of rattled because they just heard this 
huge explosion. I'm like, "I don't know what to do." I'm just like, "I'm fine." I 
[00:47:00] just walk away. I walked to the electric closet and shut the door. 
Oh my gosh. 
I was working with a journeyman at the time. I was a third year apprentice. I 
shouldn't have been doing that. 
No. 
I worked with a journeyman at the time. He didn't know what to do. He was 
kind of nervous about it, too, but really what should've happened was I 
should've went to the hospital and get my heart rate checked because that 
could throw it off. You might not know now. It could hurt you later down the 
line. You never know. I shouldn't have done that. I didn't. I was like, "I'm fine, 
I'm fine," and he didn't want to make a big deal out of it either because 
[00:47:30] he didn't want to get in trouble and that's kind of the pressure that 
they put on you. If an accident happens we can't send this guy. 
You have health benefits and stuff. 
Yes, but on the job, if you get hurt on the job you want to document that 
because you can get compensation forthat as if you got hurt outside the job. 
Also wouldn't you want to document something like that? 
Yeah, so that if something happens in the future they have knowledge that it did 
happen on the job. [00:48:00] Yeah, I should've and I didn't. 
Just out of fear. 
[inaudible 00:48:03] Now it's documented. 
It's out of fear, though. 
Yeah, it's out of fear because ...

It wasn't huge but it was ...

Yeah, I got a bag, not full of tools. It was [00:51:00] just a empty bag. He didn't 
like it so he gave it to me. It's not bad. He gave me a bunch of wrenches because 
he replaced his wrenches so he gave me those [inaudible 00:51:08] wrenches. I 
threw them in that same bag and he gave me an electronic level because he 
bought two of them and he gave me one which is like 40 bucks [crosstalk 
00:51:16] very nice. 
Is this a guy that you're like- 
This was my partner for a while, yeah. I'm not partner with him anymore but,

Oh, wow. 
I got some stuff as apprentice like screwdriver and some stuff like that. 
[00:51:30] I got a deer head from a foreman once.

I asked him for it. I have a big [crosstalk 00:51:40]. 
How did you know that he had a ... 
He's a big time hunter so I really want the one for my jam room. Me and my

He's a big time hunter. 
How do you know this much? 
How did I know he was a hunter? I worked with him for a while. What do you 
mean? He goes out on trips- 
Is this coffee talk? Is this like ... 
Yeah, coffee, lunch talk. Even before work, after work, whatever it may be. You 
get to know people while working, you know, stuff like that. 
Do you ...

I don't really know, to be honest with you. If I'm on a job like this I don't like 
being working in these conditions with all this dust and all this stuff that's not 
approved anywhere else in the world except for here. I don't like that so a part 
of me wants to get out. [00:55:30] Part of me wants to get out and be more of 
someone who just visits the job site, a project manager or something like that... 
You'd like to do- 
... kind of helps run the jobs and this and that. It's not physically in the 
conditions unless you're there once in a while. You're not completely exposed to 
it constantly every single day. Granted, that's not the truth for everybody. That's 
not the truth for every job but most jobs are very dusty. When I say dust I mean 
you know the fireproofing for beams is called Monokote. [00:56:00] It replaces 
asbestos, which you still run into asbestos a lot of times. 
Yeah. 
I had a couple of run-ins with that.

onto the floor and let it explode in a unventilated basement. 
Wow. 
Yeah and this is the guy I'm working with that's supposed to be conscientious of 
this stuff but he don't care. 
Yeah. Why doesn't he care, though? 
He has worked around it his entire career when they didn't know it was bad 
[00:57:00] for you and he's fine. 
This is an older guy. 
Yeah, he's like a 60-year-old older guy.

this could affect me but you'll be dead." [crosstalk 00:57:21]. 
Yeah, you will. 
He's saying like he worked around it his entire life and it was never bad to him 
so I guess it's not bad to anybody [00:57:30] else. 
He said quote-unquote that he worked around it. Could you tell that he had 
worked around it? Did he look like that? 
No. I mean, I don't know. 
Was he coughing? Was he ... 
No, you couldn't really tell in that sense. He didn't look like he was in the best

so [crosstalk 00:58:10] people that are- 
Yeah, you don't want to bring that home. 
Yeah, I don't want to bring it home. I bring it home on my jeans. I bring it home 
on my shoes, my shirt, my hair. You can't avoid it. 
I'm assuming that if you could change anything about your job you would ... 
The conditions. 
... change the condition, like the ... not the cleanliness. I mean ... 
It's really [00:58:30] that air quality and the products that are used, I guess, 
aren't safe but what is? I don't know. Those are known to not be safe. 
Like the oil and stuff, like the greasy ... 
No, not so much that but the airborne stuff that you just can't avoid breathing in 
all day. 
Yeah, so it's the air quality. 
It's mainly that Monokote. It's your cement that's being drilled into and breathe 
in all that dust and stuff like that. That's not good for you. It's been proven that 
[00:59:00] it's not good for you but here we are.

Okay. 
There's going to be new advancements and different things in products that we 
use now to make things easier, maybe quicker, maybe use different materials 
that are more cost efficient, more energy efficient, whatever it may be that 
might be different. Now we got guys that do solar power and do different

Are you doing that now in Hudson? 
I'm not but there's stuff on the job that they are doing like they have rain water 
collectors... 
Oh, wow. 
... and the building will store a certain amount of rain water, a lot of rain water, 
to use and it just uses to just flush the toilets so you're not wasting fresh, clean 
potable water unless you're drinking it or washingyour hands and this 
[01:03:00] and that but if you're flushing the toilet it's just using that rain water. 
It's probably filtered and stuff but it's not like wasting energy. It's saving energy 
in that sense. 
As an electrician are they doing any energy saving type of... 
On my job, I have not done. Not that I know of ... 
Are they doing wind turbines? 
... but they do do that in certain places. 
Are they doing solar? 
Yeah, they do stuff like that. 
Okay. 
I haven't come across it yet but I know people who have and I know that they 
are doing [01:03:30] more and more of that because buildings are getting a tax 
cut for that. 
Yeah. 
Stuff like that. 
In New York. 
They're saving money for that and that's good because in long run it's going to 
help our environment which really is a big thing these days. 
Is it a big thing to you as a ... 
I think so. 
... as an electrician?

I mean, both I guess. Do you think there would be more work for you as an 
electrician if we had to ... retrofit [01:04:00] stuff? 
[crosstalk 01:04:00] going green and stuff like that, yeah. I think there'd be more 
work because you'd have the bigger percentage of buildings that need work that 
aren't green so going back and changing them all, it'd open up a lot of work. 
Do you have any advice for someone who's starting out in the field? Is there any 
advice you'd give to your apprentices or anything like that? 
Stick with it... 
Stick with it. 
... as much as you don't want to because the apprenticeship, we have the 
roughest apprenticeship out of any of the trades, I think. [01:04:30] Most trades 
will agree to that. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
Even like the iron workers and stuff like that? 
Yeah. 
Wow, okay. 
I started at $11 an hour. Most trades will at least start you at 18, 20 so coming 
into that, taking that kind of cut in pay and being able to do it, then they ask you 
for dues. Your dues are $250, $280 and then they ask you for an initiation fee of 
$500. [01:05:00] Then you got to pay $280 a month for our train ticket to get 
into the city. Then you got to pay another $100 for your subway. You're doing all 
this while making $11 an hour. I mean, you do the math. 
No, yeah, yeah. 
It's not easy. 
Do you feel like you're compensated enough for this job? 
Once you get past that level [crosstalk 01:05:21], once you get that past that 
level it goes like this. It's not worth it, it's not worth it, it's not worth it, okay, it's 
worth it. I'll [01:05:30] do it for this.

You think all those obstacles lead you to appreciate that compensation? 
Yes. Yes. I think it's a way of keeping younger people from starting in the 
apprenticeship because somebody who's older and has a family won't be able to 
take that pay cut and start at $11 an hour. They want younger people to come 
up. I've worked with an apprentice who was 50 years old [01:06:00] and he was 
like a third year apprentice. He was a MU and there's no reason why he 
should've really been on a [crosstalk 01:06:06]. 
That's crazy. 
I don't even understand that but then I had to pick up a lot of the work because 
it was hard. Some stuff was hard for him and I had to end up acting like an 
apprentice all over again so it's rough and I think doing that cut in pay and stuff 
does help keep people younger to come in and ... 
Go up again. 
... make their way up. 
Is that the natural process, you think? 
[01:06:30] I think so. It's meant to be a lifetime career, yeah. 
Yep. 
Definitely. 
You think that you'll continue or... 
Till I hit the lotto. 
Yeah. Isthere anythingthat inspires you or motivates you oranything you're 
passionate about? 
Electrically? 
I mean, it could be ... 
[crosstalk 01:06:52] electric- 
... either electrically or in general but... what comes to mind first? 
[01:07:00] Traveling. 
Traveling, so ...

You wake up, go to work-

Yeah. You want to travel. 
I want to travel. I want to see the world. I want to see new things. I want to see 
different types of nature and environments and animals and places that people 
live and beaches and ... 
Different type of construction. 
... meet different people and construction. The only type of cool construction, I 
went to Italy and I went to Rome and I seen the [01:07:30] Coliseum and all that 
old stuff and that was walking through New York City and all of the sudden 
ancient Rome is the next block over. It was pretty intense and that was cool. 
That was cool. That is- 
No electricity back then, huh? 
That's crazy. Isn't that crazy? 
I would've had no place. 
Thank you, Joe. 
Yeah. 
That's all I got for right now. 
How did we do?
