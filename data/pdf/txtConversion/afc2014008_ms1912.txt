about 50 miles t
o the s

' Mulholland had built h
is 1

a

inal  dam  because  he
 
i4nted a
 l
i
ttle i

or t

(lifornia rainfall was, a
s a

c rlcious. His California Aque-
d
act had been built over a r
i
ft
 
zone o
f the San Andreas f
ault,
 
and he knew i
t was vulnerable.
 
'
j make matters worse, Owens
 
V l
ley f
arm ers kept vandalizing
 
te aqueduct.
 
, .The dam wasn't even 2
 years
 
o
ld when i
t sprang new, muddy
 
l ks on the morning o
f March
 
if
, 1
928. The dam keeper, Tony

o i
nspected the dam and

Their t

f
 
many survivors, i
ncluding t
he
 
poor and powerless Mexican
 
workers who were h

 J
our-

istorians.
 
I

hree minutes before
 
midnight when t

here, but no of
f
i-
c
ial warning would be s
ounded
 
f
or considerably more than an
 
hour af
ter t

Water engulfed whole t
owns,
 
dozens o
f r
anches, an Edison
 
construction camp, the Harry
 
Carey I
ndian r
eservation and
 
t
rading post, and DWP Power-

 I

Junction and a
long the Santa

o P

Santa Paula, Saticoy and, f
inally,
 
the s

I
t demolished 1
,200 houses,
 
washed  out  1
0 bridges  and
 
knocked out power l
ines. Bodies
 
would wash ashore a
s f

outh
 
a

At midnight L
illian Curtis E

ust below t

She t

and t

El

I
