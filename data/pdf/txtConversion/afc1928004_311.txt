JAMES BRADLEY'S BUDGET OF IRISH SONGS. 
AMONG the aspiring young men of real talent who have con-
tributed to raise the " 'Variety " Business to its present popu-
lar and prosperous condition, no one is more deserving of the 
applause that he wins than Mr. JAMES BRADLEY. 
This gentle-
man is endowed by nature with many of the qualities essential 
to success ; but he has not trusted entirely to his natural gifts: 
he has studied assiduously and worked hard—so that now he 
stands at the top of his profession. 
During the past half- dozen 
years Mr. BRADLEY has appeared under the auspices of that 
skillful dramatic caterer, Mr. JOSH HART, at his Eagle and 
other theatres, and has aided and participated in the latter's 
great successes. 
Not only is Mr. B. one of the most skillful 
and popular among our singers and dancers. but he is likewise 
the author of many of the most popular songs that are now 
sung by our leading vocalists. 
Off the stage this gentleman 
devotes much time to giving private instructions to ladies and 
gentlemen in every style of dancing. 
Of course as a: teacher 
he must be eminently successful, as both the public and the 
press unite in acknowledging him to be about the best general 
dancer on the American stage. 
In jig, plantation, and clog-
dancing he notably excels.

JOHN MONAHAN'S DONKEY. 
Sung by JAMES BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre, with great success 
I'v E 
got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy ; 
He drinks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf sure he never proved shy; 
He makes good time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar. 
CHOR US . 
I 
got a 
donkey, 
lie's not very chunkey, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey 
To any old flunkey ; 
Wouldn't that be hunkey 
If he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, 
And donkey also I 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
lie wants to get out, he pretends he is sick ; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick ; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up, leave none for next day; 
Last week he broke loose and of course went astray, 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I 
got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay; 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We got to the Hall without any delay ; 
Just as I 
was turning into the park 
Some one fired a 
pistol, just for a 
lark ; 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I 
got a 
donkey, etc. 
I'LL KEEP A SWEET 
KISS FOR 
YOU, DARLING. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE II I:GILES. 
Words by GEO. COOPER. 
Music by HENRY FRED W AGNER. 
The Music of this song is published by W . 
II . 
EwALo & Bno., 136 New-
ark Ave., Jersey City, N. J. 
Price 40 cents. 
I'LL keep a 
sweet kiss for you, darling, 
I 
cannot forget you at all ; 
I 
hear the sweet songs of the starling, 
And in it your voice I 
recall; 
My heart will be true while you're roaming— 
Oh! ever I'm dreaming of you; 
I've watch'd for your steps in the gloaming 
Each day since you bade me adieu. 
CHORUS . 
The songs of the robin and starling, 
Ah! still they remind me of you— 
I'll keep a 
sweet kiss for you, darling, 
And ever, yes, ever, be true. 
All night-time I'm dreaming about you, 
Yoiir letters I 
keep near my heart! 
Oh, life would be sorrow without you, 
And never again may we part; 
When spring- time in splendor and glory 
Returns with its roses and dew, 
Come whisper the sweet olden story, 
And tell me you're faithful and true. 
CHORUS. 
The songs of the robin and starling, 
Ali ! still they remind me of yon— 
I'll keep a 
sweet kiss for you, darling, 
And ever, yes, ever be true. 
" 
ST. 
PATRILK'S DAY 
IN '
1 
ELL MORNING." 
From. the CLIPPER. 
Tim noisy streets are supremely green„ 
And all the clans are in order; 
A thousand waving flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border; 
Arrah ! but the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only tune the wide world_ plays. 
Is " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each fad appears all neatly dressed— 
No monarch ever was bolder— 
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast, 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she couldn't resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people are all so frisky ! 
With here and there a 
bit of a 
fight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey I 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Devil a 
bit do they care for that 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning.' 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator; 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning; 
And he's sure to be humming the darling air 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald island; 
The soil of his birth is his proudest beast, 
And hell give you a 
whack for a 
warning-, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast 
Of " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning."

If neces-
sary, the character of the old lady may be personated by PAT . 
A 
dress thrown over his costume, and a 
cap, which can be easily

[Enter MARY, singing.] 
When Pat comes over the hill, his colleen for to see, 
His whistle, loud ind shrill, the signal was to be. 
"

Mary " my mother cries, " there's somebody whistling, 
sure." 
"No, mother, its only the wind, that's whistling through the 
door, 
That's whistling through the door." 
[PAT. outside, whistles " Garry Owen."] 
MARY (
listening).-013, that's the dear boy. 
Now if I 
only 
tan keep him here unbeknown to my mother. 
[Enter tire MOTHER, with a 
crutch.] 
lisfarifEtt.— Mary dear. 
Mary, I 
say. 
Where are you ? 
MARY.—Here, mother dear. 
What is it you're after want-
ing with me? 
MoTH1-R.—Didn't I 
hear somebody whistling, Mary? 
MARY.—Sure, it was the wind, mother. 
MOTHER sings. 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear; 
But the wind to whistle a 
tune like that I 
never before did 
hear. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind the 
chink, 
And the wind upon the strings of it is playing a 
tune, I 
think; 
Is playing a 
tune, I 
think.

[PAT, outside, barks like a 
dog.] 
MOTHER sings. 
The dog is barking now, and a 
fiddle can't play a 
tune. 
M ARY sings. 
But, mother, you know that clogs will bark when they see 
the moon. 
M OTH 
bit sings. 
But how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind; 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
Nor fiddles be played by the wind. 
[PAT, outside, imitates a 
pig] 
MOTHER Sings. 
And there now is the pig, oneasy in his mind. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the saying, that pigs can see the 
wind. 
MOTHER sings. 
That's all very well in the day, but allow me, miss, to re-
mark 
That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything in the 
dark, 
Can see anything in the dark. 
MOTHER.—SO, so, my daughter; get out wid your excuses. 
You can't deeave your ould mother. 
M 
ARY. — But, mother dear. 
MOTHER.—Oh, go 'long wid ye. 
MOTHER sings. 
I'm not such a 
fool as ye think, I 
know very well it is Pat.

Get out, ye whistling thief, and get along home out of that;

For though I've lost my eyes, I 
haven't yet lost my ears, 
I 
haven't yet lost my ears. 
[Exit MOTHER, shaking her crutch at M ARY.] 
PAT (
at window).—Whist, Mary mavourneen! 
Darlint, are 
you there ? 
MARY.—Yes, Pat; but be aisy, me mother is wide awake. 
PAT.—Oh, bad luck to her—I 
mane, God bless the ould 
woman. [Climbs through window.] 
MARY.—Oh, I 
know she'll hear us. 
If she does, sure she'll 
be after breaking every bone in your body. 
PAT.—What do you suppose I'd care for that ? 
MARY.—Don't come whistling round the door any more, 
Pat. 
You ought to know better. 
PAT.—Sure, I'll whistle now if you don't stop me mouth 
wid a 
kiss from those rosy lips of yours. 
MARY.—Oh, go along wid yer blarney. 
PAT.—Well, if you won't give me one I'll stale it. 
[Kisses 
her.] 
MOTHER (
outside).—Mary, Mary, come in; what kapes yer 
so long? Do you want me to come and fetch yer ? 
It's bed-
time an hour ago, sure. 
MARY.—Pat, go quick I 
PAT. —Bedad, I 
will. 
Good-bye, darlint. 
[Kisses her.] 
I'll 
go outside the same way I 
came in. 
[Jumps through the win-
MARL—I'm coming, mother dear. 
[Enter MOTHER.] 
MOTHER.-4s it all night you'd be after staying up? Come, 
along, yer ungrateful girl. 
Sure, yer head's so full of that 
whistling thief, Pat, that yer can't rest. 
Get in wid yer. 
MARY.—Yes, mother. [Kisses hand at window.] 
[Exit MOTHER and MARY.] 
PAT (
leaning an window-sill).—When I 
come again, bedad, 
I'll come wid a 
still tongue in my head. 
Take nay advice:

THE, WHISTLING THIEF.—[CONTINVED.1 
PAT sings. 
Now, boys, don't courting go too near to the house, d'ye mind; 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and 
blind : 
The days when they were young, forget they never can, 
They're able to tell the difference 'twist a 
fiddle, pig, dog 
and a 
man; 
A 
fiddle, pig, dog and a 
man.

came from dear old Ireland, 
We're strangers in this land ; 
We know that all Americans 
Put forth a 
welcome hand 
To the poor of suff'ring Ireland, 
Time and time again; 
We thank you for our countrymen, 
And Donovan is our name! 
CHORUS. 
We're the Donovans! we're the Donovans! 
From the emerald isle across the sea ; 
We're the Donovan's! we're the Donovans I 
From a 
noble family. 
Our ancestors were noble 
In the days of King O'Neal ; 
They fought for Erin's freedom 
In a 
suit of silver mail ; 
And royal blood flows in our veins 
We're proud of that self- same; 
We introduce ourselves to you, 
Donovan is our name. 
We're the Donovans etc. 
Oh, Erin, lovely Erin, 
Bright diamond of the sea, 
We always sing your praises, 
Wherever we may be; 
From the lovely banks of Shannon 
To America we came, 
To look around and settle down, 
And Donovan is our name! 
We're the Donovans, etc.

IRELAND, SWEET IRELAND."

Sung by BEN. M AGINLEY. 
Ant.—" You never Miss the Water 'till the Well runs Dry." 
On, Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest, spot on earth, 
The land where on the shamrock grows, sweet paradise of my 
birth; 
You may search this world, go where you will, and you will 
never find 
Such a 
spot on earth for fun and mirth, as the land I've left 
behind. 
CHORUS. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the Sea, sweet, paradise of my birth ; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I 
give, 
And 111 not forget old Ireland, no, the longest day I 
live. 
The day I 
left old Ireland, and my kind old mother dear, 
I 
never can forget it, for it cost me many a 
tear, 
It almost broke her dear old heart, but I 
told her not to grieve, 
And promised never to forget, old Ireland while I 
live. 
CHORUS. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the Sea, sweet paradise of my birth ; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I 
give, 
And I'll not forget old Ireland, no, the longest day I 
live. 
When on the seas to America, like an Irishman I 
came, 
I 
thought to make some money, and raise myself a 
name; 
But oh, the disappointment, not a 
dollar left me now ! 
When back to mother and Ireland I'm going soon, I vow. 
CHORUS. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the sea, sweet paradise of my birth; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I 
give, 
And I'll not forget old Ireland, no, the longest day I 
live.

H URRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND. 
Written and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. FaiumNo, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1876, by E. H. Hanouio. 
THERE is not a 
man in the whole minstrel band, 
Who would ever go back on his friend ; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which thro' life him attend ; 
I 
hear the- echo sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band ! 
Then hurrah, then hurrah, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band. 
I 
will speak first of one whom we lov'd in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave ; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refus'd his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger ' twould sac ; 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding 
in notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
The tall son of York, he has died at his work, 
And the pride of the minstrel band I 
Ile was the pride, the pride, 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band. 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true, 
'Till defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth, alas, broke his old banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, ' till he parted with breath , 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
They lived and they died with the boys that they lov'd, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band ; 
The dear boys, the dear boys, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band. 
But now I 
must speak of the prince of them all-
- 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan I 
Let ey'ry one mourn, for our chieftain i gone, 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrel and man ; 
Lt all his praises be sounding, sounding 
in notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
He liv'd and he died both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band ; 
He was king, he was king, 
1. 0 
He was king of the Minstrel Band.

There is also a 
name that is well known t0 fame— 
George Belmore the joeky so true! 
His last race is run, and the prize he has won— 
To .the Judges his spirit it flew; 
I 
hear the people shouting, shouting 
As the Flying Scud passes the stand— 
The heat it is run, the gold cup is won, 
He has .join'd the true Minstrel Band. 
He has joined, he has joined— 
He has joined the true Minstrel Band.

GRIFFIN. 
Ana.—" Hilderbrant Montrose." 
HERE I am an Irishman, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
just came over from Ireland, 
From the county of Trallee ; 
When I 
landed in Castle Garden, 
On America's soil to tread, 
I 
was met by a 
fair-haired maiden, 
And this is what she said— 
Tra-la-la! Tra-la-le! I'll meet you, pet, 
Pit meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet; 
I'll strike you with a 
turkey-leg, I'll smother you with the stuf-
fing, 
For the darling of the ladies is Hilderbrant McGriffin. 
Oh, when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My wife she made me a 
present 
Of a 
darling, bouncing boy; 
And when at night he'd holler for his paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd sing— 
Tra-la-la, Tra-la-le, etc.

BERMUDAS (discovered). I 
met a 
friend of mine down the 
street this morning by the name of Alonzo Brady, and he pro-
mised to call and see me. 
It's a 
wonder he ain't here at this 
time. (knock.) 
Enter ALONZO. 
ALONZO. Good morning, Bermudas. 
BERMUDAS. Good afternoon. 
What kept you so quick 7 
ALONZO. I 
could get here no later. 
BER. What's the trouble—any one sick in the family 1 
ALoNzo. My boy got the diphtheria dipping around in mud 
gutters. 
BER I 
took notice the last time I 
saw him he was stooped 
over; how do you account for that 1 
ALoszo. He got that way looking for stumps. 
BER. What regiment are you walking out with now. 
ALONZO. I'm with the German Fifth. 
What company do 
you belong to'? 
BER. I 
belong to the French Frog Eaters. 
ALONZO. What do you say if we start a 
small regiment of 
our own. 
BEA. All right—I'm satisfied. 
What will we call it'? 
ALONZO. The Murphy Musketeers. 
SONG. 
You've heard of the Mulligan Guards, 
At Captain Jinks so gay, 
But we're the Murphy Musketeers, 
We're very proud to say ; 
We charge each man five dollars a 
bead— 
How do you like our style 7 
Our company is rather small, 
We fall in single file.

MURPHY MUSKETEERS.—Concluded. 
We've been turning out for years, 
Give us three hearty welcome cheers, 
Stop that car ! shout hurrah ! 
For the Murphy Musketeers. 
BER. Was you ever well up in conundrums 1 
ALONZO. No, but I 
was well up on the Island. 
BER. How far up was you 7 
ALONZO. I was so far up that it took me six months to get 
down. 
BER. I 
say, Alonzo, I 
have a 
Pompey Squash story to tell 
you. 
ALONZO. All right ! tar on the wheel ! let it rip. 
BER. If you was to swallow a 
man what kind of a 
man would 
you like to swallow'? 
ALONZO. A candy man. 
BEE. No, I 
would rather swallow a 
little Dublin Porter. 
ALONZO. You are so smart, why is your nose like the Tri-
bune Building'? 
BEE.. Give it up. 
ALONZO. Because it's got a 
drinking saloon underneath. 
B 
wt. What's the difference between you and the moon'? 
ALoszo. Give it up. 
BER. The moon is full twice a 
month, and you're full every 
day. 
ALONZO. What is a 
young fellow doing when he is talking 
sweet to his girl 7 
BER. Why, he is giving her taffy. 
ALONZO. How long does it take to hang a 
man before he dies ? 
BEE. Ten minutes according to law. 
ALONZO. I 
saw you hanging around a 
distillery for two hours 
yesterday, and you ain't dead yet. 
SONG.—Last verse. 
We had the curbstone band, 
They played march upon the Rhine, 
And the dead heads on the sidewalk 
Did polka to the time; 
Up Broadway to Thirty-third, 
Though every hole and alley, 
And then we stopped in Cherry street 
To get a 
wreath of Mrs. Tally.

They gets it little as the druggist meas-

No! They know d

TOPICS OF THE DAY . 
Sung with great success by JAMES BRADLEY. 
How I 
love to smoke, 
Yes, to smoke, to smoke, 
Or crack a 
lively joke, 
While feeling light and gay ; 
They say pull down your vest, 
Go west with the rest, 
Or, Charley, throw out your chest, 
Are the topics of the day. 
CHORUS . 
How I 
adore to waltz, 
Yes, to waltz, to waltz, 
Or take a 
dose of salts, 
Are the topics of the day. 
SPOKEN.—' was down town to- day, and I 
had quite a 
chat 
with the mayor. I 
asked him for a 
chew of tobacco; he asked 
me what kind I 
would have— fine cut or plug ? 
I 
told him I'd 
have plug. 
He gave me his high bat to chew on. 
I 
then 
jumped on the Bleecker street car ; I 
slipped as I 
got on the 
steps ; I 
told the conductor he ought to put something on the 
steps to keep people from slipping ; he said he would have put 
some salt on the steps if he thought there was any fresh fellows 
getting aboard. 
Well, I 
rode up as far as the Clipper office, 
and I 
dropped off there, and bought a 
Herald. 
I 
observed all 
the latest news on the bulletins by cable. 
That cable is a 
smart man; he knows what's going on in Europe. 
I 
saw that 
Spain had refused to interfere with the Brooklyn Bridge ; that's 
great loss to cigar signs. 
I 
looked over the obituary column 
and I 
saw there was plenty of help wanted. " Wanted—a 
thin 
man to go down in soda water bottles and bring up corks." 
" 
Wanted—a 
man, must weigh two hundred pounds, to stand 
in front of a 
private dwelling to tie horses to him." 
I 
had a 
job like that myself one time; the boss stopped his horse and 
wagon in front of his door, and of course tied the horse to me. 
By and bye a 
band of music came by, the horse started ; he was 
found in New Haven and I 
was found up at High Bridge. 
gave up that situation. 
I 
got a 
job down at the new Post Of-
fie, standing near the window where the people buy stamps. 
All I've got to do is hold out my tongue and let people wet the 
stamps. 
I'm courting a 
girl over here in West Broadway I 
go 
to see every - night, providing her father and the bull dog are 
(nit of town. 
IIr mother ain't spoke to me in two years—she 
died in 1874. 
I 
made up a 
song about her, and went around to 
see her the other night, and I 
sang it.

Her name is Mary Ann O'Brien, 
Her mother sold bananas, 
Her father earned a

Her brother was musician, 
He carried a 
big bass drum.

While a

While we go a- travelling around!

He calls out her name, Sarah Jane Hughes, 
Then she feels cheerful and gay.

MULDOON'S PARTY. 
Dedicated to the I. I. L. Club. 
Sung by JAYE5 BRADLEY. 
MutnooN gave an evening party, 
His friends, he invited them all; 
There was. Roger O'Malley, so hearty, 
And the man with a 
terrible gall ; 
They drove up to the door in hand- carts by dozens, 
With Mulliaan's band they danced gay and free; 
They kept up the fun till daylight in the morning, 
The sights of the evening I'll now tell to thee. 
SPOKES.—When I 
arrived there it just struck half-past six 
by the City Hall clock—I 
paid the expressman for conveying 
me. 
When I 
entered the party, the first one I 
laid eyes on was 
my well-established friend, Muldoon; he was walking up and 
down the floor with a 
swallow-tail coat. 
The next one I 
spied 
was Jakey Woolfenstein. 
Jake was reading the last scene of 
that elegant drama entitled, " Number Seven." 
Mulcahey 
jumped up and said, " Ladies and gentlemen, if you have no ob-
jection, I 
will open the harmony of the evening."

SPOKEN.—W eil, after he got through, he had the final call, 
so lie called upon McCarthy, the umbrella man; he tried to be 
excused by telling the people he caught cold selling fans in an 
ice- house. But it was a 
poor excuse; McCarthy was the author 
of several of the latest songs, such as " The Girl with the Doe-
skin Ear," " Laughing at the Breeze," " They couldn't Link the 
Dinkey," and " There's a 
Prize in every Doughnut ;" but his 
favorite song was " The Umbrella Man," which he sang. 
SONG. 
BEFORE you stands one Mike McCarthy, 
I'm a 
man so stout and hearty. 
Take in every ball and party, 
From Harlem Bridge to City Hall; 
Never care for rainy weather, 
As long as the gang will stick together, 
Will strike you with a 
club or feather, 
I'm not giving you no stall; 
I'll tell to you before you buy, 
I'll sell you cheap, not very high; 
It will keep you warm and very dry, 
A

half, take one and try.

Mend your umbrella's handy, 
Never care for gin or brandy ; 
Very foal of molasses candy,

Never care for pie or pastry,

In a 
passion I 
am never hasty,

PATRICK O'GRADY'S WAKE. 
Words by FRANKLIN W . 
FISH. 
'TWA s 
Patrick O'Grady, own cousin to Brady, 
That lives in the house by the fat us- the hill; 
A 
broth uv a 
feller, that sometimes got meller, 
And swallowed a 
glass ur poteen wid a 
will; 
Fur dancin' or foitin' 
He found much deloight in, 
And always in time for a 
frolic or wake; 
I-Ud sometimes assail ye 
Wid thumps us' shillaleh, 
Or trid on your coat for relationship's sake. 
To tell ye, begorra 
I'm breaking wid sorrer, 
And me heart in me breast is as cold as a 
sthone; 
If ye talk about grace, I've no rason to borrer, 
Bedad 
for I've. (rot a 
big stock us- me own! 
Me bosom is meltin', 
Me tears, they ao peltin' 
Like hail on a 
winder, and drop on the floor; 
I 
think ye could pick ' em 
By bushels, and stick ' ern 
In piles if they only were frozen, ashtore ! 
Well, Patrick one day had been down to the tavern, 
For a 
drap lir the cratur to fill up his jug. 
When some dirty, black thafe, he popped out of a 
cavern, 
And hit him a 
terrible whack on the Ina I 
The villain, I'd bound him! 
Got Off ere we found 11_12:; 
And stiff and as cold as the village sign- post, 
Was Patrick O'Grady, 
Own cousin to Brady. 
And the lump of a 
lad shure had give up the ghost. 
• (1-) 
PATRICK O'GRADY'S WAKE.—Concluded. 
Wid a 
blanket thrown o'er him, with waping we bore him 
On a 
bit ur a 
stretcher, and laid him in bid; 
And we thought that a 
wake like his father's before him, 
Was respectable conduct to show to the did; 
To honor his merits 
And kape up our spirits 
We bought some ould whiskey at Finnegan's store; 
Avoiding all scandals, 
Two dozen of candles 
Were added to light him to hirin, galore! 
Well, as I 
wus sayin', with cryin' and prayin', 
Poor Patrick was waked in a 
sinsible way ; 
For yez know, when one's dead there's no use of delayin' 
In puttin' him under the sociable clay; 
So Michael O'Connell 
And Timothy McDonnell 
Was watchin' the hid of the coffin by night, 
When all try a 
sudden— 
It frazes the blood in 
One's reins to recall it—they had a 
great fright. 
Ye must know, wid grafe shakin' a 
drop they was takini, 
To kape up their courage or kape their skins warm; 
And thinkin' how Patrick had not been forsakin, 
And his sowl was at rist just as well as his forrn— 
Bedad ! it's no scoflin' ! 
He rose from his coffin, 
And looked at O'Connell wid a 
wink in his eye— 
" 
It's mighty onciril, 
Ye selfish ould diril, 
To dhrink all the whiskey whin others is by."

MOLLY OF SILLMORE. 
"Words by Ac TON THOMPSON. 
Music by CHARLES 7.NIAcEvo -r. 
The Music of this song is published by E. IL H ARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1S76, by E. IL H ARDING. 
ONCE more I'm at home in my own native land, 
Once more with the friends of my youth, 
On Erin's green soil once more do I 
stand, 
The land, boys, of virtue and truth; 
Oh, dear to my heart are her mountains and vales, 
Her moss-cover'd, sea- beaten shore; 
I 
love ev'ry inch of her hills and her dales, 
Above all, boys, my dear old KilItnore. 
CHORUS. 
My old Kil'more, boys, 
My old Killmore, boys ; 
God bless Molly 
Who lives in Knit-Imre. 
For ' tis there I 
was born by the side of the hill, 
'Tis there dwells the girl of my heart; 
Although far from home, yet memory still 
From old scenes would never depart; 
Though the notes of the trumpet would sound an alarm, 
Though cleat-Dino- the cannon's loud roar, 
An angel stood guard and kept me from harm, 
'Twas my Molly who lives in Kinn-tore. 
My old Killmore, etc. 
And now do I 
see'&  her, with love in my heart, 
With pockets and spirits both light; 
From her and my home I'll never depart, 
Until I 
forever take flight ; 
Then come to me, Molly, I'm waiting to hear 
The voice of my loved one, asthore 
Don't be friahten'd, my dear, ' tis your Pat that is near, 
He's come back to his love and Killmore. 
My old Killmore, etc. 
THE LABORERS. 
Sung by KERNELL and BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre. 
W E'RE employed upon the Public Works, 
So listen to our ditty; 
Well tell you of the trouble we had 
To get work in the city; 
We've searched for work up at the pipes, 
And down at the Navy Yard; 
But the only job we got at last 
Was up on the boulevard. 
CHORUS. 
We're solid with all the aldermen, 
We hold a 
grip in the ward; 
We have thirty-five relations 
Upon the boulevard. 
Our captain was a 
solid man, 
His name was Mike Mahoney; 
On a 
packet ship he crossed the sea, 
He came from California; 
A 
politician be arose to be, 
For us be had a 
regard, 
And he had us all appointed 
Beyant at the boulevard. 
We're solid, etc. 
Soon, we know, we'll be discharged, 
Election is returnintr, 
And for the money we've worked so hard, 
Our pocket sure is burning; 
The boss he told us all to go, 
We thonoht it very hard, 
So Mahoney and me and my chums did agree 
To leave the boulevard. 
We're solid, etc.

Written and sung by JAMES BRADLEY. 
No doubt you've heard of the Active Boy, 
Also the Lively Moke, 
But I've got one that's full of fun, 
You will see l'm not telling a 
joke; 
It's all about this nigger here, 
And of my funny ways, 
how I 
sing to please the folks, 
That's the way I 
pass the days. 
CHORUS. 
I'm my parents' only joy, 
They say I 
am their dancing boy, 
Twist my heel like any eel, 
Jump up high and down again ; 
The neighbors think I'm awfully wild; 
My father calls me his darling child; 
Indeed it's so I'll have you know, 
I've got it on the brain. 
To balls and parties I 
always go, 
Whenever I 
get the chance, 
I 
take my gal, her name is Sal; 
Around the room we dance. 
When the ball is over, 
It breaks up in a 
fiTht ; 
The fiddler breaks his fiddle, 
While the committee all get tight. 
Fin my parents', etc. 
Written by JAMES BRADLEY. 
Sung by CONROY and DALY. 
I'm Mrs. Muldoon, the solid man's wife, 
On that lye no reason blow ; 
But I've got a 
son, who's a 
son of a 
gun, 
And to work sure he never will go; 
He is following his father's examples, 
Looking for every chance; 
But every one knows he's a 
big overgrown 
While he wears his skin-tight pants. 
CHORUS. 
His head is as red as the ginger-bread, 
I'm afraid he will never advance, 
Or 0
-0 
to the front like his father, John, 
While he keeps on the skin-tight pants. 
My sister from Kerry, she's an aunt to Jerry, 
Told me a 
tale one night; 
She said he was a 
pi voter. 
She was told by Andy Wright; 
I 
know it's true, yes, every word, 
For he goes to every dance, 
And he wears his father's long- tail coat 
To hide his skin-tight pants. 
His head, etc. 
If John gets the nomination 
For alderman next fall, 
I'll buy my Jerry a 
bran new snit, 
Like the paper on the wall ; 
And then we'll have a 
raffle, 
At fifty cents a 
chance; 
May the best man throw high or low, 
To win poor Jerry's pants. 
His head, etc. 
My Jerry will go to a 
boarding- school, 
To join the college grade, 
And when he's there a 
year or more, 
Of course he'll learn a 
trade; 
Then I'll send him to speak the French, 
I 
will pay his passage to France; 
When he goes he can turn up his nose 
To those that made fun of his pants. 
His head, etc

BECKY GILDERSLEEVE. 
Written by JANE.,; BRADLEY. 
Sting by the Dancing Four, W ILD, TOOLEY, KERNELL, and BRADLEY. 
SWEET was the girl that I 
met last Sunday 
While strolling through the park to take the evening air ; 
She smiled as she passed me, my heart it went with her, 
I 
knew that I 
captured that darling fair ; 
She gave me a 
note, (
music) 
On which was wrote (music.) 
cnoRus. 
Her name was Becky Gildersleeve, 
Her parents they were rich, 
And her mother kept a 
dairy 
Up beside McCoorub's ditch; 
I'm going up to see her 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
If I 
nip the fortune 
I'll be a 
hunky coon. 
I'll put on my Sunday clothes, and won't I 
look gallus 
With my swallow- tail vest, double-breasted in the back l 
I'll pay live cents on a 
Third Avenue locomotive, 
And walk to her house on the railroad track 
I 
expect a 
large brass band, (musk) 
At the depot when I 
land, (nus:k) 
To escort me to my Becky's house, 
There her folks Fli see, 
If not a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
A- waiting there for me ; 
If I 
don't get her folks' consent 
I 
know I'll be a 
loon, 
And commit suicide with a 
Dutchman's moon, 
That will end this bunky coon.

TME MEMORY OP THE DEAD.—[CeNcLuerej 
All, all are gone—but still lives on 
The fame of those who died— 
All true men, like you, men, 
Remember them with pride. 
Some on the shores of distant lands 
Their weary hearts have laid, 
And by the stranger's heedless hands 
Their lonely graves were made; 
But, though their clay be far away, 
Beyond the Atlantis foam— 
In true men, like you, men, 
Their spirit's still at home. 
The dust of some is Irish earth,— 
Among their own they rest; 
And the same land that gave them birth 
Has caught them to her breast; 
And we will pray that from their clay 
Full many a 
race may start 
Of true men, like you, me; 
To act as brave a 
part. 
They rose in dark and evil days, 
To right their native land; 
They kindled here a 
living blaze 
-; 
That nothing shall withstand. 
Alas! that Might caa vanquish Right— 
They fell and passed away; 
But true men, like you, men, 
Are plenty here to-day. 
Then here's their memory—may it be 
For us a 
gui.ling 
To cheer our strife for liberty, 
And teach us to unite 
Through good and il], be Ireland's still, 
Though sad as theirs your fate; 
And true men be you, men, 
Like those of Ninety- Eight.

TEDDY REGAN'S MARIE. 
AN ORIGINAL SONG. 
Y,ou have hear41 of Teddy Regan, 
iHow he won his Winnie fair, 
And her fortune, fifty guineas. 
Set them up in business rare. 
For they crossed the briny ocean 
To deal out the whiskey swate 
At the famed Hotel d'Irish 
Down in lovely Baxter strate. 
CHORUS. 
Fal de ral de ral de rady, 
Fal de ral de ral de ra; 
Fal de ral de ral de rady; 
Fal de ral de ral de ra. 
Things kept working brave and hearty— 
Proving money makes the man— 
'Till the Dimycrathic party 
Put Ted up for alderman. 
Misther Regan felt the honor 
With a 
relish of delight, 
And resolved to give a 
swarie 
When it came election night. 
Fal de ral, 
With the strongest kinds of welcomes 
Rue de Baxter did abound; 
For throughout that lovely section 
Dimycrats are aisy found: 
There was Levi, the old cid man, 
Smelling like the days of yore, 
knd McTurk, a 
fine Dead Rabbit, 
True and honest to the core. 
Fal de ral, 
Dan McCrzitss., 
licensed vender, 
In the clam and porgey line ; 
Count MutEni, whose hand organ 
Always ground the Muses fine : 
While, like Hector that hould Trojan, 
When he fought at Bunker's 
TIADDY REGAN'S SWARIE. 
Mackerelville was represented, 
By the buffer Wall-Eyed Bill. 
Fal de ral, 
Then came in stout Denis Murphy, 
A very dacent Soap- Fat Man; 
While Myneer Van Pat McFadden 
Drove up in his garbage-van. 
Teddy gave them lots of welcome, 
And the pipes began to play 
Tunes to set a 
mile-stone dancing: 
Lillerburo and Patrick's day. 
Fal de ral, &c. 
Soon the whiskey done its duty_ 
Wall Eyed Bill began the job, 
And with his black- thorn shillaley 
Split old Levi on the nob. 
Dan McCraisy, belted Murphy; 
Laid him stiffer than a 
log, 
Cause he couldn't else convince him 
There was feathers on a 
frog. 
Fal de ral, itte. 
Soon they knocked the bar to splinters, 
Kicked the panels from the door; 
For it was a 
splendid swarie, 
While the whiskey flowed galore. 
Teddy, when the row was thickest, 
With the poker got a 
clout, 
By the howly mule murther, 
Banged his sivin sinses out. 
Fal de ral, &c. 
Ted was dead as Julius Cmsar, 
When the row was ended quite, 
And a 
dacent wake they gave him, 
On his own election night. 
And poor Winnie, left a 
widdy, 
Says she's doing very well— 
And though Ted was " Hunkey Dorey," 
That he " couldn't keep Hotel!"

Am.—" What Can the Matter Be." 
Stage struck whin a 
boy, I 
wint to school gaily, 
Didn't care for the birch, tho' I 
tasted it daily, 
At school-time I 
ranted and whirled my shillelab, 
And I 
always was playing the fool. 
SPOKEN—Says my master: 
Oh dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, viat will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
SPOSEN.—One day my master called my name out, " Dicky, 
my boy," said he, " howld up your head, and let me hear you re-
pate that piece I 
towled you to learn." " Yis, yis," said I, but 
the fact was I 
seldom paid any attention to what he said, so I 
just gave him what came first, and I 
bawled out lustily, " My 
name is Norval, on the Gramphian Bills, my father feeds his 
flock, he was a 
man, take him for all in all, what said the fool of 
Haggar's offspring is this a 
dagger I 
see before me. 
Give me 
another horse, bind up my,wounds, I 
do remember an apothecary, 
but no more lek my father, than I 
to Hercules. 
Oh, my pro-
phetic soul, my uncle, of all men else have I 
avoided thee, to lie, 
or not to be, that is the question. 
I'm weary of conjectures, this 
must end. 
Smio—I shall, quoth my master, with rage his heat 
This is no place to give me sauce in 
Instead of a 
horse, I'll give you a 
horsing, 
So he bound me quite feat to a 
stool. 
SPOKEN—Says etc at every stroke— 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear. what will become of hint, 
Oh, dear, what will became of him, 
lie's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
SP3IIEN. — Alter he had flogged me until he was tired. "Yonr.g 
man," says he, " as there is not a 
bit more of the birch left, I 
shall not flog you any more at preseat." " Thank ye, sir," sez 
"then as E 
may not have another chance again, I'll just take the 
liberty of telling you a 
bit of my mind," so I 
seized my shilleiah, 
mounted a 
form, and held forth this: " Most potosat, grave and 
reverend seignior, my very noble and approved good master, that 
you have wronged me, cloth appear in this, you have disgraced 
me by a 
vile blow, had no a 
dagger done a 
nobl,Ir service. 
I've 
been your faithful slave too long. I 
have set my life upon a 
cast, 
and I 
will stand the chazard of the die. Richard's himself again. 
Igo 
He who moves one step to follow me dies upco. the spot." 
Sirsa--This said, I 
marched out with the air of a 
Rolla, 
The master jumped up and determined to follow, 
But I 
got the start, and I 
beat him quite hollow. 
And I 
left the old fellow to cool. 
SrosEN—And as I 
marched off I 
heard him saying: 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school.

WIDOW MACIIREE. 
Widow Macree, it's no wonder you frown, 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
Faith it ruins your looks, that dirty black gown, 
()eh hone! Widow Machree; 
1=1)w altered you are. 
With that close cap you wear: 
'Tis destroying yonr hair, 
Which should be flowing free; 
Be no lon7er a 
churl 
Of it's black silken curl, 
Och hone Widow Machree. 
Widow Machree, now the summer is come, 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
When everything smiles, should a 
beauty look glum? 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
See the birds go in pairs, 
And the rabbits and hares, 
Why even the bears 
N DW in couples agree 
And the mute little fish, 
Though they 
spake, they wish, 
Och bone! Widow Machree.  
Widow Machre, :: nd when winter comes in, 
Och hone ! 
Machree ; 
ro be poking the fire all alcure is a 
sin, 
Oh hone! Widow Machree. 
Sure the shovel and tongs 
[11 
To each other belongs, 
While the kittie sings songs 
Full of family glee; 
Yet alone with your cup, 
Like a 
hermit ycu sup, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
And how do you know wi7h the comforts I've towld, 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
But you're keeping some poor fellow out in the cowki, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
W:th such sins on your head, 
Sure your peace will be fled, 
Could you sleep in your bed, 
Without thinking to see 
Some ghost or sprite, 
That would haunt you each night, 
Crying, Och hone! Widow Machree. 
Then take my advice, darling Widow Machree, 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
And with my advice, faith, I 
wish you'd take me, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
You'd have me to de-ire, 
Then to stir up the fire, 
And sure, Trope is no liar, 
In whispering to roe 
That the ghosts would depart, 
When you'd me near your heart 
Och hone! WicloTv Machree.

DANNY, GO AFTER YOfIR FATHER. 
Sung with great success by JAMES BRADLEY. 
I'm Mrs. O'Malley, Roger's wife, 
He is very fond of drink; 
From Monday morning till Saturday night 
Of nothing else he'll think, 
But go down to the corner store, 
Throw dice and play the cards; 
Instead of bringing his money home, 
He spends it on all the blackguards. 
CHORUS. 
Danny, go after your father, 
He is down in the corner store, 
Playing forty-fives with the Dutchman— 
Against it he often swore; 
Tell him come home to his supper, 
I 
know it will save his life; 
So that's a 
good lad, 
Go after your dad, 
And tell him come home to his wife. 
Sometimes he takes the pledge, my boys, 
And he keeps it for a 
week, 
Until Saturday night comes over his head, 
To the Dutchman's down he'll sneak; 
He makes believe he is going for coal, 
And through the side door he'll steal, 
lie calls out to the bartender, 
Give me a 
big mug of ale! 
Danny, go after, etc. 
Now, dear friends, he's keeping stralght, 
And he never leaves the house; 
He sits down by the fire 
And reads his book, just like any mouse; 
I 
tell you we are happy, 
Around the house there's peace; 
But I 
understand there's an alderman 
Going to put him upon the police. 
Danny, go ar,er, etc. 
Andantino. 
Words by W ILLIAM SMITH. 
ceive 
me, 
Thy 
for - tunes have 
frowned, and the 
Hard is the world, it will rudely reprove thee; 
Thy friends will retire when the tempest is near; 
Now is my season, and now will I 
love thee, 
And cheer thee when none but thy Mary will cheer. 
Come to my arms—thou art dearer than ever! 
But breathe not a 
whisper of sorrow for me I 
Fear shall not reach me, nor misery sever,— 
Thy Mary is worthy of love and of thee.

DIGGING FOR GOULD. 
Darby Kelly below in Killkenny did live, 
A sketch of whose character I'm going to give; 
He was thought by the people a 
green polished rogue, 
Re could wastle the whiskey, or wastle the old brogue; 
All kinds of diseases with herbs he could cure, 
He'd interpret your dreams to be certain and sure, 
By the boys of the village he often was fool'd ; 
'or aslape or awake, he was dreaming of gould. 
Fol de dol, &c. 
Ee had a 
fine open house, but the winders were broke, 
The gables were down to let out the smoke; 
Some beautiful pigs, through the wide world to range, 
Though they were thin, they were thick with the mange, 
He was so neglectful of domestic affairs, 
The rats eat the bottoms all out of the chairs, 
And the wife by the husband was so overruled, 
When she asked him for coppers. he was talking of guild. 
Fol de dol, & c. 
The house thus neglecte-a, sure nothing went right; 
When a 
youth of the village came to him, one night, 
A 
nice boy he was, his name was Dan Mac, 
And ready to fly with the duds on his back; 
All the clothes that he had wasn't enough 
To make him a 
bolster to stick on a 
crutch, 
And his juvenile days in a 
lime-kiln were schooled, 
But he used to cod Darby about finding gould. 
Fol de dol, &e. 
Says Dan; Ere last night I 
had a 
beautiful dream; 
Bit bad luck to the doubt I 
last night I'd the same; 
And to-day, as I 
dozed, after slacking some lime, 
I 
dreamt it again for the third and last time. 
Och, murder! says Darby, come tell us your dream, 
Same time his two eyes like rockets did gleam, 
Says Dan; I. dreamt at the castle Kilcool 
I 
found a 
jar that was maimed 
of gould. 
Fol de 401, drc

DIGGING FOR GOULD.—[coNcLuDEn.j 
Poor Darby a 
big mouth opened like a 
dead Ilaicke, 
Saying: You'll be a 
hero, just like your name-sake; 
You'll ride in your coach, you fortunate elf, 
While I 
may be in one, going down to the hulks. 
Ico matter, said Darby, we must emigrate, 
So, come down at mia-rtglit, and don't be too late; 
Bring some boys whose courage won't easy be cooled, 
And we'll dig till daylight to find all the gould. 
Fol de dol, 
They arrived at tne castle, at about one o'clock, 
Where Dan dreamt he found all the gold in a 
crock, 
They all set to work With picks, shovels and spades. 
And a 
hole, that would swallow a 
h-
ouse, soon was mad' 
Says Darby: Bad luck to the curse we must give. 
Or we'll be beggars as long as we live ! 
Says Dan: My the devil on my back be stooled, 
For, I 
have bursted my breeches in digging for gould! 
Fol de dol, & c. 
The prayers availed nonimg, the crock was soon found, 
Tim Rooney he lifted it over the ground; 
With joy Darby leaped on the back of Ned Fail, 
Like a 
fish from the stream with a 
hook in his tail, 
Says Darby: My wife won't abuse me to-night, 
When I 
take home the shiners so yellow and bright! 
I'll buy house and land about Killcool. 
And we'll all bless the night we went digging for goith:; 
Fol de dol, 
The cronc was mien placed on Darby's own back, 
To carry home and each man have his whack, 
They arrived at the door with the gould to be sacked, 
When Mac with a 
spade knocked the crock into smash 
Poor Darby, near smothered, ran in with affright; 
his wife jumps up to get him a 
light: 
When she heard Darby mourning, her passion was cooled, 
She, knew by the smell he was covered with gould! 
Fol de dol, &c.

THE WEDDING OF DANDYORUN 
Ant: The Wake of Teddy the Tiler. 
If in your sates you'll silent be, 
And listen for a 
while to me, 
I'll tell you of a 
slap-up spree, 
At the wedding of Dandyorum. 
He grew tired of a 
single life, 
So now resolved to take a 
wife, 
Though his money cut like any knife, 
For matrimony he was rite : 
Tie cast his eyes upon a 
maid, 
And every night the neighbors said, 
That a 
Highland fling and serenade 
Were sung by Dandyorum. 
CHORUS.-Oh ! 
tare-an- ages ! such a 
crew 
Was never brought to Christian view— 
The ball be gave was nothing to 
The wedding of Dandyorum. 
The maid who selled poor Dandy's doom, 
Was Peggy Baxter of the Coombe, 
She might have been, when in her bloom; 
Grandmother of Dandyorum 
But still she looked quite neat and plain, 
Her gown it was muslin-delaine, 
She got it down the spout quite clean, 
And new cacks she had from Golden Lane. 
The brides maid sure, was Peg the man— 
But when the ceremony began, 
She for ,Tot she had to scour a 
can, 
She ran from Dandyorum. [Oh! tare-an-ages, &a. 
While Peg was tumbling down the stairs, 
Dandyorum said his prayers : 
His reverence said " Make yourselves scarce, 
PI not marry Dandyorum." 
Then Zozimus expressed his doubt, 
" 
I 
see no cause to make a 
rout, 
"What is your reverence about `t" 
But the clergy had the whole kicked out; 
The bridegroom to the bride then says: 
To Cullenwood we'll go our ways," 
So in one of Bobby Tompkin's drays 
They drove off Dandyorum. [Ohl tare-an-ages, &c. 
Cantering Jack came up from Bray, 
Besides his compliments to pay 
He had to give the bride away, 
Poor Mrs. Damlyerum. 
[1] 
51 
THE WEDDING OF DANDYORIMI.—[CoNctunEn.] 
The job was done, she paid the fees, 
Then Zozimus dropped on his knees, 
And prayed their joys might soon increase, 
While Hughey gave the bride a 
squeeze. 
To raise a 
scoop they were at a 
loss, 
For not one amongst them had a 
cross, 
But they got around in the Bleeding Horse, 
For a 
dance by Dandyorum. [Oh 1 
tare-an-ages, &(-) 
The day I 
washed my aperin, 
And polishe i 
my shoes to caperin, 
For I 
was after papering 
The room of Dandyorum. 
At fir o'clock, that blessed hour, 
He led his ' ladye' to the bower, 
But she was drowned with a 
shower 
That did from a 
garret window pour; 
Her muzzle-an' dress were wet and crushed, 
Seemed white- washed with a 
blacking brush, 
In hundreds, out the neighbors rushed 
To see Lady Dandyorum. [Ohl tare-an-ages, &c. 
When tea was over punch was made, 
The teatotlers had lemonade, 
But the music was so long delayed, 
It was vexing Dandyorum. 
The blind fiddler 'tween a 
rail got stuck, 
And his bowl in smithereens ties broke, 
So Peg the man put on her jock, 
And went for Messrs. Mack and Rock; 
To put a 
finish on the spree, 
They sent for Stewart, Kane, and me, 
Where the eye-teeth fell out of us three, 
[ 
Singing for Dandyorum. 
Oh! tare-an-ages, &
c. 
We kept it up till ten hext day, 
For Cantering Jack made us all stay 
'Till he beird potatoes for our tea, 
That were feckel. by Dandyorum. 
But the bride was nowhere to be seen, 
So on Dandy we let down the screen, 
And as all our appetites was keen, 
We ate a 
pig and a 
cart of greens. 
In some short time, we may suppose, 
'We'll have a 
route with one of those 
Young lads with thumb-shells on his toes, 
Like his father Dandyorum. [Oh ! tare- an-ages, c‘:c

THE IRISH RECRUIT. 
AIR:—." Paddy O'Pourk." 
'Teddy O'Ran had a 
valliant heart, and to fight was mighty 
willing; 
To the sargeant Paddy marched, and took the 'listing shilling. 
Faith I 
11 be promoted soon, says he to Corporal Cacy, 
For I've shouldered the hod for many long years, it will tech 
me to shoot airy. 
Wid a 
row dow dow, & c. 
SPOREN.—Hould up your head, says the sargent. 
That's what 
I'm always after doing—excepting whin I've got a 
whiskey 
faver, and thin it is a 
bit lobsided. 
Turn out your toes, ssys he. 
Faith and sure don't you see my toes are out already; and faith, 
that was true for me, for both shoes were out at elbows, and the 
only stockings I 
had were bare feet. 
Stand at ease, cried he. 
How will I 
be after doing that same? 
Sure and faith, said I, I 
never stand at ease but when I 
set down. 
Shoulder arms, cried 
he. 
Would you have me. shoulder legs? says I. 
Right about 
face, says he. 
Oh, I'm all right about the face, says I. 
To the 
right wheel, says he. 
If it's the same thing to you, I 
would 
sooner have a 
tazte of mutton. 
Order arms, says he. 
Where 
will I 
order thim ? says I. 
Load, says he. 
The cart or the bar-
row, says I. 
Fire, says he. 
Where, says I. 
Charge, says he. 
Three and a 
kick says I, 
Take that, says he. 
And by powers 
of Poll Kelly he was after httting me such a 
crack that made 
me sing 
Row de dow, 
At last they drill'd and brac'd me up, and fitted me for battle, 
Aud aff we marchd to the field of tight, where the cannons loud 
did rattle. 
There the blood did run about just like pools of water, 
Paddy, says they, now which is the best, the gun or the hod wid 
de mortar. 
SPOKEN.—Phat was the use of disliking that same ? 
They told 
me I 
cud but die once faith, but I 
saw many a 
poor fellow killed 
two or three times. 
At last it came to my turn— for a 
ball come 
and knock'd me down as dead as a 
herren. 
Get up out of that, 
says the sargent. 
How can I, says 1, sure and don't you see I 
am kilt. 
The devil a 
bit, says he. 
Sure then, I'm helpless, 
says I—und that's just as bad. 
While he was going on so, bad 
luck to me but a 
ball conies along and takes off his leg. 
My 
leg's gone, says he. 
Which leg ? says I. 
My left, says he. 
Och, then, says I, your right is left. 
How's that? says he? 
Because it's the only one that'sleft. 
So at last we beat the foe, 
and the drummers bate, and I 
was taken off the field wid the 
killed and wounded, got my diseharge wid a 
thumping penchan, 
which they never pay, causing me to sing

- THE LOW BACK'D CAR. 
When first I 
saw sweet Peggy, 
'Twas on a 
market day, 
A Low Back'd Car she drove, and sat 
Upon a 
truss of hay. 
But when that hay was blooming grass, 
And deck'd with flowers of spring, 
No flowers were there that could compare 
With the charming girl I 
sing. 
As she sat, in the Low Back'd Car, 
The man at the turnpike bar, 
Good natured old soul, never asked for his toll, 
But looked after the Low Back'd Car. 
In battle's wild commotion, 
The proud and mighty Mars, 
With hostile scythe demands his tythem 
Of death in warlike scars; 
But Peggy, peaceful goddess, 
Has darts in her bright eye, 
That knocks men down in the market town, 
As right and left they fly; 
As she sits in the Low Back'd Car, the battle more dangerous 
far, 
For that aoctor's art cannot heal the smart 
That is hit from the Low Back'd Car. 
Sweet Peggy round her ear, sirs, 
Has strings of ducks and geese, 
But the scores of hearts she slaughters, 
By far outnumbered these ; 
While she among her poultry sits, 
Just like a 
turtle dove, 
Well worth a 
cage, I 
do engage. 
With the blooming God of Love. 
As she sits in her Low Back'd Car, the lovers come near and far, 
And envy the chikens that Peggy is picking, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car. 
I'd rather own that ear, sirs, 
With Peggy by my side, 
Than a 
coach mid four, and gold galore, 
With a 
lady for my bride ; 
For the lady would sit forninst. me 
On a 
cushion made with taste, 
While Peggy would sit beside me, 
With my arm around her waist. 
As we rode in that Low Back'd Car, to be married by Father 
Mg 
Oh, my ialeaarr, 
t 
would beat high, at each glance of her eye, 
As we rode in her Low Back'd Car.

THE TWINS FROM SKIBBEREEN. 
Words and Music by THOMAS F.
Airry. 
Written expressly for Mr. JAMES BRADLEY and BARRY KERNELL. 
FERNINST you stand two Corkeys bold, 
Whose pedigree is easy told; 
We've just landed here from the emerald isle, 
And we won't detain you but awhile; 
We are twins it's plainly to be seen. 
And we come from a 
place called Skibbereen 
And digging turf we'll do no More, 
Since the day we left old Erin's shore; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend, 
And you'll find there's none so true a 
friend; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that come from Skibbereen. (Dance.) 
At home we were known as the Irish team, 
At a 
wake or a 
fair we could always be seen, 
And if called upon for a 
jig or a 
reel, 
We could show them the use of the toe and heel, 
And whenever there would be a 
faction fight, 
In the midst of the fray would be our delight, 
For two hearts more brave were never seen 
Than the twins that come from Skibbereen; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend, 
And you'll find there's none so true a 
friend; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that come from Skibbereen. (Dance.) 
BIG FAT NANCE. 
Original Act by BRADLEY and W ILD. 
W HITE folks, give me your attention, 
While I'll sing to you my song, 
'Tis of my girl I'm going to mention, 
And I 
promise not to detain you long; 
I've been courting her for many a 
day, 
And to her house I 
often go around ; 
In her stocking feet she stands six feet four, 
And weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. 
CHORUS. 
Come all ye nigs, come joip together, 
Take the banjo down and have a 
dance, 
For I'm going to be married next Sunday evening, 
To my great big fat and greasy Nance. 
Nancy's ma has gave consent, 
Her father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take her arm, 
And to the church we both shall glide; 
She will be my wife forever. 
Lots of thin ge for her I'll buy, 
She'll never go back on George Lapelle 
Until the very day she dies. 
Come all ye nigs, etc.

pretty Irish girl, VAR d

I 
put my hand into my pocket, as it happened so, 
And pulled out a 
guinea to treat my Irish Molly, 0

She is young, she is beautiful, she is the fairest one I

The primrose of Ireland, before my guinea go, 
And the only one that entices me, is my Irish Molly, 0. 
I 
said, my pretty fair maid, will you go along with me, 
I

They will lay all the blame on my Scotch laddie, 0.

He sent for young INI'Donald, and these words to him did say, 
If you court ray (laughter .Mary I 
will send you far away. 
She is young, &c. 
Since Molly hits deceived me, all by her father's ways, 
Through some lone. woods and valleys it's there I'll spend my

Like some poor forlorn pilgrim I'll wander to and fro, 
It is all for the sake of my Irish Molly, 0. 
She is young, &c. 
There is a 
rose in Dublin, I 
thought she would be mine, 
For to come to my funeral is all I

It is all for the sake of in

She is young, &c. 
When that I

Come all you pretty fair maids a

For the green leaves will wither and the root it, will (lecay, 
And the beauty of a 
fair maid will soon fade awny.

Oh, there's not a 
trade that's goin g, worth show:ng or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowl(' Sojer Boy ; 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, fr.end or foe. 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march duo', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window pules will search thro', the ranks to find their 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry My eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bol.vld Sojer Boy 
'But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout, 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is -,11 before us, where the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refus, to score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap,' Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
'Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy.' 
Then come along with me, Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with y 
our Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, 'twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
And 'tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of our mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line he'll 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy.

I've been to " La, Belie France,"

If I

Don't think that I

For in Germany I've been, 
Where sausages strong,

Then into Roossia, I

The land of furs and capes, 
Whe men all make the women work, 
And the soldiers look like apes.

And wretch-ed had tay 
Enough to make me squint; 
Japan then came in view,

But yellow Jack nigh broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' 1111(111er stars and stripes

READY-MADE LOVE- LETTERS. 
COMPRISING 
Every Style and Fashion of Note and Letter incident to Love, 
Courtship, and Marriage, which should pass between 
Ladies and Gentlemen from, First Acqaintance 
to Final Union. 
This Beek teaches plainly—so plainly that the most simple can 
understand and make use of the lessons taught. 
It tells a Lady how to meet a 
Gentleman's advances. When to seem a 
little forward when to seem a 
litle shy. How a 
lady should meet, and how 
part from a 
Lover. 
Shows Ladies and Gentlemen how to act to each other, 
and in company, in all the parts of Bride, Bridegroom, Bridesmaid, and 
Groomsman. How to act at the Altar and at the Wedding Feast. How to 
behave during the Honeymoon, and how and whom to receive and visit. 
In brief, teahes everything that Lovers should know about Court-
ship— its attendant joys and troubles; of the Marriage Ceremony, its customs 
and the thousand duties, cares and pleasures that attend and follow. 
It is a 
perfect vade mecum. 
Study it and you can act easy, natural, and 
genteel in all the above positions, and pass with success through all these 
most trying and difficult scenes—equally well with any lady or gentleman 
born to wealth and brought up in fashionable society. 
This Rook also tells yon—llow to write your first letter to a 
lady. 
How the lady should reply. 
Row a 
gentleman is to tell he loves. 
What the 
lady should write in reply. How a 
gentleman should write to a 
lady, under 
all and any cireumstance. 
What the lady's replies should be. 
Shows how 
widowers as well as bachelors should woo widows, whether young or middle-
aged. 
In short there is not an occasion of any kind calling for a 
correspond-
ence on the subject of Love and Matrithony but what is here treated of, and 
plainly and fully explained. 
To which are annexed, SPECETTEN LOVE LETTERS, 
written by persons in real life, in every possible contingency that can occur;
