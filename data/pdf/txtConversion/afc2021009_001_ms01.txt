CH 00:03
Good afternoon and thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this historical project with the
Archie Green Folklife Initiative with the Library of Congress. How're you doing this afternoon?
RR
I’m fine. Thank you for asking.
CH
Would you please give us your complete name and year of birth?
RR
Ruth B. Young-Richardson. 1943.
CH
What city and state do you live in?
RR
Washington, D.C.
CH
Where were you born?
RR
Washington, D.C.
CH
Oh, okay. Tell us a little bit about your family dynamic.
RR
Well, there was seven boys and two girls. I was the oldest girl. Had brothers three above me and the rest
came below me. My parents are very loving and nurturing. My grandmother lived with us, so I had, as
they would say, big mama in the house taking care of things. Always plenty of love. Daddy worked for
the government printing office in the day and he drove a cab at night.
CH
What about mom?
RR
Mom was a homemaker only. She said her job was to take care of her children.
CH
Wonderful, wonderful. What inspired you or who inspired you to become a nurse?
RR
I've always wanted to be a nurse as long as I can remember. When other people were getting doll babies,
I wanted a doctor’s kit, ‘cause they didn't make nurse’s kits then. So, I always wanted to be a nurse.
3
afc2021009_001
CH
Tell me about your matriculation through nursing.
RR
Well, I started out as a volunteer for the Red Cross at the-- It's now defunct, but it was the D.C. General
Hospital. I went there and volunteered, and they had a little girl there in pediatrics who’d been severely
abused and she was not trusting up the staff or anyone. She wouldn’t let ‘em change her dressings or
anything. So, they assigned me to her. They thought maybe I could get through to her ‘cause I was
younger and she was younger. She rejected me at first too. Each day, I would come back [inaudible
2:17], I'd come back each day and she’d reject me. One day, to my surprise, I was walking out the door
and she said, "Come back. I want to talk to you." I turned around and she was standing behind me,
‘cause I know she wasn’t talkin’ to me after rejecting me for so many days. She said, "You came back
every day even when I rejected you. Why?" I said, “‘Cause I felt that you’re worth saving and I wanted
to get to know you so you can get to know me."
CH
Were you a nurse at that time or you were a volunteer?
RR
I was a volunteer. I was still in high school.
CH
Then, where did you go to nursing school?
RR
I went to Georgetown University Hospital School of Practical Nursing.
CH
Okay. After that, where did you go for your RN training?
RR
[Inaudible 3:09] I was just about ready to complete it when I had a accident at work. A patient flipped
me and three other staff members. The patient was on PCP at the time, with the other drugs which we
didn't know at the time, and he was in four-point metal restraints. That's when we learned that even if
you are in four-point metal restraints, you get enough strength, you can flip someone.
CH
What happened to you?
RR
Okay, I got a ruptured disc in my back, so they had to operate on that, and the course that I needed to
take for my nursing was being offered at the same time I was recuperating, so I couldn't take it. So
[inaudible 3:59], the director of nursing at that time, said to me, “I know a lady over at University of--”
No, it was Washington Technical Institute at that time, “and I'm gonna call her. Her name is Martha
Lewis. I'm gonna call her and ask her could you take her class,” because the course I needed would be
given the next rotation, but by the one in the government college, it would take a year or more and I
4
afc2021009_001
knew if I stood out in nursing for a year, I wouldn't come back. So, she called on Miss Lewis and Miss
Lewis said-- She looked at my brace, everything, said, “Oh sure. Send the patient over. Send the student
over.” Well, by that time, I had [inaudible 4:40] complications and I was in a full-body cast from right
above my breasts to right above my knees, so I could stand and I could lie but I could not sit. So, they
had to bring a stretcher into the classroom for me to lie on, and I had a recording student to take notes as
well as myself taking notes. I went on and I finished the program thanks to Miss Lewis and all the other
people who assisted me during that. Then from there, the American Nurses Association said that you
had to have a BSN in order to be a entry-level nurse. Well, I had just taken and gotten a BA in Sociology
from American University, Washington, D.C. So I said, “Oh boy. Here we go again. Gotta go back to
school.” So, I was looking around to see what school would accept my credits so I wouldn't have to
repeat a lot of things. Unfortunately, Washington Technical Institute wanted me to take all the things
over again. I'd already passed the state boards. I was already a registered nurse. I said, “No way Jose am
I gonna repeat all these things.” So, I found George Mason in Fairfax, Virginia. The only problem was
we only had one car and my husband had to have a car to get to work. I could take the bus, but he
couldn't take the bus where he was going on many days. So, I worked it out with my best friend
[inaudible 6:07] and we both enrolled in George Mason University's RN program. It was a program that
was just starting up, so they accepted 60 generic students and 60 RN’s for the BSN. Well, I took evening
courses ‘cause I had to work in the day to help support us. I had gotten married in ‘73 and this is like
‘75. So I said, “No way Jose.” So we said, “Okay.” We worked it out that we’d meet at a designated
point and go to school. I’d meet at a designated point in the evening and my husband would pick me up
and bring me home.
CH
It's quite an experience.
RR
It was quite an experience.
CH
Did you further your education?
RR
Yes. I'm proud to say I'm the first Black nurse to graduate from George Mason University Hospital--
George Mason University School of Registered Nursing, and that was in May of 1976.
CH
Well, I'm here with a celebrity, huh? [laughs].
RR
Yes, yes.
CH
What did you do, education-wise, after you finished George Mason?
5
afc2021009_001
RR
After that I worked for a while. I've always wanted to be a hospital administrator, so I went to [inaudible
7:23] University in Baltimore, Maryland and got my Master's in Health Service Administration, and that
was in May of 1979.
CH
And then you continued on to get your doctorate?
RR
Yes, I have worked. I have always had to work, and by then, you know, [inaudible 7:40] come into the
picture, so I had family. So, I went to Virginia Polytechnical Institute and State University in
Blacksburg, Virginia and I got my Doctorate in Education.
CH
Okay. How many children do you have?
RR
I have a blended family. There are five altogether.
CH
Okay, okay. You have grandchildren?
RR
Yes, we have grandchildren. I think I have six or eight grandchildren or great-grand. I keep getting the
numbers mixed up [laughs].
CH
Your nursing career - tell me about your nursing career.
RR 08:25
My nursing career has [inaudible 8:27] many barriers and we have overcome them. I started out, as I
said, as a licensed practical nurse and then from there, I went on to get my [inaudible 8:38] and my BSN
and my master’s and then my doctorate. All along my nursing career came challenges. I always wanted
to be a hospital administrator but they always seemed to put me in the educational track. They said I was
so good with people and good helping my fellow students do things that they thought education would
be a better track for me than administration. So, I was always put in there. So, along with my other
challenges, I seemed to be able to help people get along with them and they came to me for advice. They
came to me if they had a problem. They felt that I was someone who abided by confidentiality. They
could tell me things and they never heard it again. They wouldn't have to worry about Sue, Jane, Mary
Lou, [inaudible 9:24] and Billie Joe discussing their business. They didn’t have to worry about it.
CH
Now, who is “they”?
RR
Fellow colleagues.
6
afc2021009_001
CH
Fellow colleagues.
RR
And in my nursing career, as I advanced, the operating room was my first love. Let me say, that’s where
I loved to be, in the operating room. I loved the challenge of this spontaneity that you get. I mean,
whatever, three to 11, you don't know what's coming through the doors, because we were on Irving
Street, which is bordered by further over 14th Street. You got the preacher's daughter, you got the
prostitute, you got the policeman, you got the fireman and anybody else that came through the door, and
we did not discriminate.
CH
Well, what did you do in the operating room?
RR
Oh, I was a scrub nurse. The scrub nurse would ask the nurse to pass us the surgical instruments. Then,
other times I was the circulating nurse. We worked it out; most of us would work evenings who were
going to school. So, if someone had a big exam or had a [inaudible 10:28] the next day, we let them
circulate so they can get a little bit of rest and get off their feet. If they didn't have that, they was a scrub
nurse. Stayed there and passed the instruments.
CH
What other positions have you held in nursing?
RR
Oh, I've been assistant coordinator for-- and then long-term, it was the Washington Nursing Facility then
on Alabama Avenue Southeast. I was the MDS nurse, the minimum data standards nurse. Assess the
patients in that way that Medicare and Medicaid would know how much to pay the institution and the
services the person needs. I've been a school nurse. I've been-- I guess my greatest success in nursing
has been my research project with Rutgers University, where I was on the research team for leadership.
We competed with other-- I just say other challenges throughout the city on completion of the program.
There were five others and they were all African American and we completed that program.
CH
What was the research about?
RR
The research was about being a leader in a school nursing facility, and how did we do things to help
further. My research directly was how do we keep the children in school, because what was happening,
we served a large homeless population and the children did not know where they gonna lay their head at
night, and we wanted to make sure they had some continuity in their lives. So, we were fighting for that
they would come back to our school, no matter where they lived in the city of Maryland, Virginia, could
come back to the school where they had familiar teachers, familiar cafeteria workers, familiar program
workers and things so they would have some continuity and they would be safe.
7
afc2021009_001
CH
Was it successful?
RR
Very successful, very successful. We had to fight for it, but it turned out to be very successful.
CH
Did you find that, from your efforts, that the students stayed in school?
RR
Most of them did. Most of them did. Of course, these are minor children, so they have to go where their
parents send them or take them, but the majority of ‘em did stay in school.
CH
How did you find their health situation was?
RR
Well, we would assess them and ask them to come by the [12:48] to say hello, and when they were
doing that, we’d go see if they had clean clothes on. They wore a uniform, if they had clean uniforms on,
if they had any new scrapes and bruises or anything that we needed to treat.
CH
Sounds like that was a very beneficial program. What did you do after you finished that research?
RR
We turned the research over to the school authorities, the powers that be, and they were very pleased.
[Inaudible 13:19] extended the program to other schools.
CH
It's great. That's great. After the school nursing, did you hold any other positions?
RR
No. Unfortunately, I had a stroke and I had to retire.
CH
How long have you been retired?
RR
I think, like, five or six years, I think.
CH
You also have been a nursing instructor. I didn't hear you mention that.
RR 13:47
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I had been a nursing instructor for many years. I was at M.M. Washington Career
High School. I was a nursing instructor there. I instructed both the secondary and the post-secondary
8
afc2021009_001
students so they could become LPN’s and be on their way to their RN degrees. I was a nursing instructor
at Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland and the University of the District of Columbia in
Washington D.C. Thank you so much. I forgot about that.
CH
I have to share with everyone that you are very special to me because I think I was one of your first
students at Margaret Murray Washington, otherwise known as M.M. Washington Career Center. Who
could think that we would be sorority sisters and me sitting here interviewing you? So, I am quite
honored to be with you. I always call you my teacher.
RR
I’m quite honored also to be here.
CH
Tell me your relationship with your students.
RR
We had open, honest relationships. Some of our students needed more nurturing and caring, in addition
to their academic things, so what we did, one of the things that [inaudible 15:11] and I did-- That was
my team teacher; we team taught. We noticed some of the students, many of our students were from the
islands and from Africa and many of them didn't seem to have enough to eat. So, what we started doing,
we would either cook extra food up and bring it in and put it on a table for everyone or if we had
something leftover, and that went quite well. We’d call them “lunch and learn”, “chew and chat”, and
what we did at that time was, we did this test to see how they were doing psychologically, mentally,
physically, spiritually, emotionally. We did more than just getting them food, in school and passing state
boards. We wanted them to be healthy along with it.
CH
As far as your students went, how would you say they were treating being students aspiring to be
nurses? Their motivation. How was their motivation?
RR
Some of ‘em were quite motivated. Others were very aggressive, especially the males, who’d say, “In
my country, I’m this, that and the other,” meaning they were, like, chiefs or sons or chiefs and they
thought they should have special priorities. We treated everyone the same. If you needed a boost of
motivation, we’d give it to you, but we did not go by status. We didn’t care. We were there to motivate
and encourage all of our students to reach the highest level that they could attain.
CH
You taught licensed practical nurse and you also taught RN curriculum?
RR
Yes.
9
afc2021009_001
CH
With the RN students that you taught, how do you think they were, as far as being motivated to continue
their education?
RR
Some of ‘em were quite motivated. Others were [inaudible 17:10] and didn't want to do it, and others
were-- I found that my LPN to RN’s were much more motivated than my RN to BSN’s.
CH
And the curriculum, was the curriculum extra challenging for the RN to BSN or the LPN to RN? Was it
rigorous?
RR
All of ‘em were challenging, and we tried to take on their prior knowledge and build upon that. Some of
‘em felt like, "Oh, I don't need this,” or, “I know all of this." Then, when we gave them their assessment
test to see whether they could opt out the course, we found that they didn't know what they thought they
knew and they had to take the whole course, whereby-- That was the accelerated track, whereby many of
the LPN to RN students were able to get on the accelerated track and pass it and go on and get out in
less time.
CH 18:06
Quite interesting, quite interesting. Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. How long have you been a
member?
RR
I was made an Alpha chapter in April of 1978.
CH
Have you held any offices?
RR
Yes, I've been anti Basileus, which is the vice president. I've been [inaudible 18:29], which is recording
secretary. I held that, I thought, forever, and I've been the chairman on many committees: recruitment,
future [inaudible 18:38], retention. You name a committee, I've been on it.
CH
So, that's the local level. What about on regional level and national?
RR
Okay, recently I was chairman [inaudible 18:55] for our different regional conferences and our venues,
and seeing if they were [inaudible 19:02], seeing if they had all the proper equipment they needed,
making sure that merchandise was secure at night when we all went to bed. I did that, and I've been on
regional committees whenever they asked me to help out in Minneapolis there. So, that was on the
national level, and I was on the property manager chair, the property manager for the sorority house,
which is known as national headquarters.
10
afc2021009_001
CH
Where is the sorority house located?
RR
We are located at 3029 13th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. 2006.
CH
What does the property manager do?
RR
Basically, the property manager is in charge of securing the property, making sure that things are done
the right way. I have no administrative functions as far as that is concerned, but making sure things are
done. If anything breaks down or the fire alarm goes off, they notify me then I notify the proper
authorities.
CH
Were you involved with any projects with the sorority house?
RR
I was involved with the renovation of national headquarters. The contract was already found when I
joined in this capacity, so all I had to do was follow through, but we still got the furniture for the sorority
house, the appliances for the sorority house and things of that nature.
CH
What chapter are you in again? What chapter of Chi Eta Phi are you in?
RR
Alpha chapter.
CH
Alpha chapter.
RR
The mother chapter.
CH
That is in which region?
RR
That's in the Northeast region.
CH
“Service for humanity” is the motto for Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. How have you embraced and
embodied that motto?
11
afc2021009_001
RR
Okay, I've always been a compassionate person and I help out in my community [inaudible 21:13]
seeing the different needs being met, the Kidney Foundation, [21:19] for things that are needed. In 1982
and '83, we did several projects with the D.C. public schools and others. One of the projects was to
introduce the students in elementary schools to different faces of nursing. So, each of us wore our native
uniform, if you are a public health nurse, operating room nurse, or school nurse, and spoke to the
students, and that was quite successful. That was the year the Alpha chapter received eight awards for its
community service projects.
CH
You've spearheaded other projects with Alpha chapter at your church, which is St. Thomas More. Would
you talk to us about that?
RR
Oh yes, beside the health fairs and Kidney Foundation, we have been with St. Thomas More Catholic
Church for over 20 years. We work with the Angel Tree Project, where the children will put down what
they wish to have for Christmas, and that's been quite successful. We also have invited Toys for Tots,
which we gave out over 1,000 toys to families and children who came there, whose parents signed them
up.
CH
Angel Tree Children are children of... What’s the situation for their parents?
RR
Many of the children are being reared by their grandparents, by aunts and uncles and by family members
or someone in the community. Many of the parents are missing in action. We don't know whether they’re
in jail or where they are, but the children are still here and we want to [inaudible 22:55] and make sure
these children know that someone loves them and cares for them.
CH 23:00
Has the COVID-19 pandemic had any effect on either of those programs?
RR
Yes, unfortunately. We used to have a dinner that we [inaudible 23:14] to the families and Santa Claus
would come in and embrace the children, give them candy canes and talk to them, have pictures taken
with them. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we had to cut all of that out. What we had to do-- Oh, and
we used to go out and shop for the children the things they wanted. What we had to do now was cut it
back to gift cards. We gave gift cards to the mother and the mother would have to go shop for the
children and get their-- what the children wanted, which is not a bad idea. It's just that many of ‘em
missed the interaction at the dinner, the interaction with Santa Claus and the interaction working with
the students and sorority.
CH
That was with the Angel Tree Project?
12
afc2021009_001
RR
That was the Angel Tree Project.
CH
How was Toys for Tots impacted by COVID-19?
RR
We couldn’t have the Toys for Tots because of the interaction with the parents signing up their children,
and then they come and they pick up something. Someone would say, “I have a boy, age six, and a girl,
age four.” Those were the items you would pick up with the Toys for Tots project. It impacted that, so
we didn't have it this year.
CH
You didn’t have it at all this year.
RR
No.
CH
We are in turbulent times in our country as far as the health perspective with COVID-19 and also with
race relations, racial relations. Have you experienced in your nursing career any adversities because of
your race?
RR
Oh yes. As I said, the operating room was my first love at the Washington Hospital Center, the old
hospital. We had our locker room down the hall on the fourth floor. We'd have to go in the locker room,
change there and walk back to the main operating room, whereby the white nurses would go strictly into
the hospital, strictly into the fourth floor operating room and change there. We were not given that
privilege.
CH
How did that make you feel?
RR
It made us feel like we were second class citizens but we were expected to do first class work. We were
supposed to do the same duties that they did, perform the same services they did, but yet we were not
privileged to be in the same locker room.
CH
Any other instances that you faced?
RR
There have been times as an instructor when I have gone places and they want to instruct and they go to
the oldest white female in the class and say, “Mrs. Richardson? Dr. Richardson?” and then when I walk
off and speak up, they are walking into walls literally.
13
afc2021009_001
CH
Did you find any prejudice as far as your students?
RR
Oh yeah. There were students who felt that a Black person didn't know enough to teach them, and one
even went so far as to bring their daughter there to see if [inaudible 26:29] any difference or her
daughter was not being-- her mother was not being taught properly.
CH
How did that turn out?
RR
Well, that turned out very well because I told her, “First of all, you have to have permission to come on
and you're not granted permission, so you have to leave”. I had another student who would go on the
floor and she would come, go to the [inaudible 26:55]. So, one of the things I did, I got a white sheet, I
got some glue and I got some glitter. I put the glitter on the white sheet. I put the glue in first and then
the glitter so it shines and I cut spaces for eyes. I put that on and [27:22] the unit so she could always see
me. Well, of course they cracked up. The administration was not pleased at all with me. [Inaudible
27:30] but she has a problem with seeing me and I want to make sure she can always see me.
CH
That is quite comical.
RR
Yes, after that we had no further problems.
CH
As far as your students, again, I know some excelled and some struggled. What did you do to help those
who were struggling?
RR
With those students who were struggling, I used to have sessions. I could take lunch and learn, chew and
chat at lunch time, but I also provided for them on the weekends or whenever they could do. I gave them
extra tutoring sessions at no expense to them. I helped them achieve-- [Inaudible 28:09] was struggling
with the exams, if they had tests though, was it something that I was doing wrong that I wasn't getting
the message across to them. We found out that many of them were working two jobs trying to support
home here, home back wherever it was, whether the islands or it was Africa. A lot of them were sleep
deprived. Once we figured that out, we tried to work something out so they would not be so much sleep
deprived. We told them to write down important products and the things that was said, the key points, on
a card and then talk that into a tape and put that tape into the radio, so going to work and coming home
from work, the key points would stick in their mind.
CH
What trends in nursing did you notice while you were an instructor?
14
afc2021009_001
RR
Say that again.
CH
What trends in nursing did you notice while you were an instructor?
RR 29:04
Well, some of the students were very motivated. Others were [inaudible 29:14] to the point of, “I don't
need this.” I noticed that we were getting students [inaudible 29:21] to it for the money, quote unquote.
Now, I don't know where the money was. All the years of my nursing I never saw the money, but they
wanted the money and they weren't going into it for compassion, service for humanity or anything of
that nature. They was going into it because they thought they could meet a doctor [inaudible 29:39],
possibly getting married or for the money.
CH
So, mostly the trend you saw was social in nature as opposed to a professional trend?
RR
Correct. It didn’t have the professionalism. Like, myself and the other staff, we discussed this one day.
We went into it because we were compassionate. We wanted to make a difference. They don't seem to
have that professionalism about them. Back then we wore our caps, and so you always had your cap nice
and clean. These students don't take the pride we took in it. We looked like we walked out of a
commercial for Clorox. Our clothes were always white. Our shoes were always white. We sanitized
them. We didn't have dirty shoestrings, dirty shoes. We were always professional, our caps always white,
our stripes always neat [inaudible 30:34].
CH
I bet you didn't find that in the time period when you were an instructor.
RR
No, it’s gone down, down, down.
CH
No pride in appearance.
RR
No pride, and when they took away the cap, said you don’t have to wear caps anymore, that was both
good and bad, because those who were professionals, true professionals, know that there’s pride in
wearing your cap. Having scrubs on is okay, but what it did is that the people become [inaudible 31:09]
instead of getting professional.
CH
There is a shortage of nurse educators. What, in your opinion, is the cause of that?
15
afc2021009_001
RR
Well, as we get older, we can't do like we used to do, and many nurses do not want the students working
on, quote unquote, their license, because we're responsible for the students - the good, the bad, the ugly.
So, they don't want to do that. Then, some of ‘em just don't have the patience for the students. It was the
[inaudible 31:41] get themselves to school and they don't have the patience or the tolerance.
CH
How do you think that that situation, as far as a shortage of nurse educators, could be corrected?
RR
One thing they could do, they could start a program in the nursing curriculum for nurse educators, and
so the students would grow [inaudible 32:08] and they would see what was required, and then once they
graduate, they would be ready to take over some of these positions and some of them were, and then the
older ones who feel that they are retiring age soon would feel less burdened because they know they had
someone to take their place and someone that they have trained.
CH
Mentoring, then, is an essential piece to help to correct the shortage of nurse educators.
RR
Yes, definitely.
CH
Why, in your opinion, do you think people don't want to go into nursing?
RR
Nursing used to be a fine profession. For some people it still is. For others, like I said, it’s just the
money, so it doesn't hold the prestige it once did.
CH
You feel that prestige is what made people want to become a nurse?
RR
Yes, that and several hospitals, Georgetown, Children's, Mothers have an excellent program and they--
where you get recognized for being a certain [inaudible 33:25] nurse, blah, blah, blah, and so people will
go into that and they want to be recognized for that. What we have to do is make sure that people are
pointed to it for the right reason, because many of ‘em want to go into it just to say, “I work at a certain
hospital,” as opposed to going into it, “I'm giving patients the very best care I can and I'm taking extra
courses. I'm taking [inaudible 33:53] to see what's the latest trends are coming out now.”
CH
What is your philosophy for those who want to come into nursing?
RR
I would say, have a compassionate heart.

A compassionate heart. Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in service for humanity and
how?
RR
Oh yes, I do, ‘cause us being out there and getting exposure, and we need more exposure, we’re letting
the world see that we are there. We are on the frontlines. We are on the battlefield. We want you to know
that we’re there for you. We’re compassionate. We’re not there for the awards, for the prestige, for the
money. We’re there to give our patients the very best care that we know how to do.
CH
The patients and the community. Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in the community?
RR
Oh, yes, yes. When people see the yellow and the green, they know that those are the nurses. They might
not get Chi Eta Phi to get correct when they're saying it, ‘cause they know it makes a difference and they
know that they're safe. They know that they're protected. They know that someone cares about them.
CH
So, you feel that Chi Eta Phi definitely makes a difference.
RR
Definitely, yes.
CH
What are your thoughts on Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated and what words of wisdom do you have
for someone who's coming behind?
RR
I would tell them to make sure that they are doing it for the right reasons. The right reasons mean it’s
being compassionate. They want to see the community and the patients get a better quality of life. They
want to help them eliminate some of these food deserts by having the food pantries and the other things
that they can do. Do many things like the church. Like, St. Thomas More was gifted with freezers and
refrigerators, so then we were able to give out fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, eggs, milk, meat, both fresh
and frozen, so it just makes a difference. Whereas before all you had was the carry-outs and a grocery
store, so you had to rely on them, now it makes a difference. So, when they look up and see the yellow
and the green, they know, “Oh, I'm safe. I'm protected. Someone cares about me.”
CH
And what words of wisdom do you have?
RR
My words of wisdom are to be honest and be compassionate.
