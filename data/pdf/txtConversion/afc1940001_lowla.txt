Lowlands of HollandI had just got into my bed;I had not been asleep,When there came a noble
captain.He stood at my bed feet,Saying, "Arise you jolly rovyer,Arise and go with meTo the Lowlands
of HollandTo fight mit Germany.""Oh, oh, my dearest daughter,Why mourn and so lament?Ain't
there lords enough in Galloway.Could give your heart content?""Yes, there's lords enough in
Galloway,But there is none for me,For I never had but one true love,And he's drownded in the
sea."He is drownded in the salt, salt sea,And he has left me here behind.'Tis enough to break a fair
maid's heartWho was lately been a bride.That so lately been a bonny, bonny bride,So charming to
behold.In the Lowlands of Holland,My love lies dead and cold.""Oh, oh, my dearest daughter,Why
mourn and so lament?Ain't there lords enough in GallowayCould give your heart content?""Yes,
there's lords enough in Galloway,But there is none for me,For I never had but one true love,And he's
drownded in [the?] sea."No chain shall go about my neck,No comb go through my hair,No fire bright
or candle lightShall evermore shine there.They sailed into Holland,As I have heard them say;In the
Lowlands of Holland,Their ship was cast away." 1 Page 1. When you [??] [are gone baby?] This [? type

LOWLANDS OF HOLLAND.
This song as near as I know is the LOWLANDS OF HOLLAND. [Me?] My sister [md] I canremember my
sister and brother use to sing it at school when I was verysmall. They had an old song book that they
called the "Song King" and Ithink they took [md] I think they got this song [out??] of it. I'm not sure,
but itgoes something like this:
