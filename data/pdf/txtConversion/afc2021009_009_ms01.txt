CH  00:00 
Good evening and thank you for agreeing to take part in this historical project, the Archie Green Folklife 
Occupations Project, Library of Congress. How are you? 
  
DS 
I'm very good. Thank you so much for allowing me to participate. I'm quite humbled and honored to be 
here with you. 
  
CH  
[Inaudible 0:24] You know, it’s my privilege to have you be a part of this historical journey. Would you 
please state your complete name and your city and state where you live? 
  
DS  
Deborah Stamps, D-E-B-O-R-A-H S-T-A-M-P-S, and I live in Rochester, New York. 
  
CH  
Where were you born? 
  
DS  
I was born in London, England. 
  
CH  
Okay, wonderful. So, what was it like there? Did you grow up there any? 
  
DS  
Actually, I lived there until I was five and with my mom and grandmother, and I came to the United 
States with my grandmother. The plan was that my mom and dad would come to the United States. My 
dad is an engineer and my mom was a magistrate. They did a lot of work with Foster Wheeler, which 
was an American engineering company, and ExxonMobil. But really missed being back in the UK and 
went back. As they reestablished their business there, I stayed here with my grandmother and was raised 
by my grandmother. 
  
CH  
Okay, that's wonderful. Where are your parents from? 
  
DS  
My mom and dad are both from the UK. My mom has West Indian heritage and my dad is Welsh. 
  
CH  
Okay. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. So, you come from a very diverse background. Wonderful, 
wonderful. Any sisters or brothers? 
XXXXXXX

DS 
I have one brother. He's my baby brother, but he's a lot taller than I am. Very proud of him. Richard 
Parks. He has trained to be a dentist and he was a rugby player. He played international rugby. Quite the 
record of success in that career until he was injured, and that was gonna change his trajectory in rugby. 
With the loss of my grandmother and his experience not being able to play rugby, he actually decided to 
raise money to support cancer care in the UK and set out to do what is now the 737 Challenge, where he 
would climb the seven highest summits, including the North and South Pole, in less than seven months. 
He set a world record. I'm very proud of him. Talk about resilience and planning and understanding the 
trade and the skill and the discipline, ‘cause I know I couldn't do it. I can't rough it. That's not me. I'm 
very proud of him. He humbles me every day. He definitely got the athletic gene, which I do not have. 
He also set another world record skiing solo in Antarctica a few years-- just before the pandemic. So, 
he's definitely very focused on health and wellness. He's also very focused recently on racism and how 
that impacts his life and people around him and the opportunities, social determinants of health. 
  
CH 
You're very proud of your brother, your family as a whole. That's wonderful. What year were you born? 
  
DS 
I was born in 1965. 
  
CH 
Okay, alright. Who or what inspired you to become a nurse? 
  
DS  04:10 
My grandmother being ill. Being raised by my grandmother, she was really like my mom and my mom 
was more like my sister. All very close, all of us. When I was 14, my grandmother needed open-heart 
surgery. She had open-heart surgery, and I'll never forget the nurse who, before we went into the 
CTICU, said, "This is what you're gonna see when you walk in the room." She explained the tube. She 
explained that my grandmother was unconscious, sedated, but she could still hear us, and how important 
it was to still speak to her, you know. She explained the chest tube drainage and so on and so forth. So, 
when I went in, I was not scared, you know, even though she had so many tubes. Back then, it's not like 
open-heart surgery today. You're up walking the same day nowadays. She really put the anxiety down. 
She kept us informed and educated us, and that was, like, amazing to me. Growing up, where I grew up 
in Rochester, was the 19th Ward and the University of Rochester was in our backyard and you could 
actually see the dome of the university buildings. I always wanted to be a physician. I always wanted to 
be a physician. My grandmother always said, “You’ll go to the U of R,” and, you know. But my life 
took a different turn, being a single parent, teenage mom at 17. So, healthcare-- that interaction with that 
nurse really set the stage for me, that, “Wow!” The impact that she had on us as a family, what-- she 
does that every day. She doesn't even know it. Also helped shape me as a nurse, because I always felt 
that I needed to ensure that my patients knew what was happening and understood, that their families 
understood, and that our job as nurses was to advocate and make sure that they understood, that 
teaching. So, that really resonated with me, that that was the nurse that I wanted to be. The turn in my 
life from high school to going to college was being pregnant at 17, having my daughter. You know, back 
then, it wasn’t-- it was very frowned upon to be a teenage mom. However, it didn't stop me. I went to 
LPN school and that afforded me the opportunity to work in nursing. I can even say, at that time, I don't 
XXXXXXX 
5 
 
remember really understanding the differences in nurses, just that you were a nurse and that was it. But I 
went to work at Rochester General and I had-- people encouraged me to go back to school to become an 
RN. I'm like, “Well, what's the difference?” you know. “What does that mean?” I had no idea the impact 
that becoming a registered nurse would have. You can do more, you can have more influence, you can 
have different types of positions. I had really great mentors, and I didn't even know they were mentors 
until years later. My director of nursing was amazing. She was so forward thinking. She said, “You have 
to go into, you know, get your RN and you have to focus on geriatrics. That's gonna be the focus of the 
future. You have to know”-- When I looked at our patients, majority of our patients were older, in their 
40s, 50s, 60s, you know. 
  
CH 
She must have been a baby boomer. 
  
DS 
Yes, she was, and she is so innovative and really that forward thinking. So, that really made me think, 
when I was gonna get my master's, that I need to focus on geriatrics. I became a geriatric nurse 
practitioner. Just as I was graduating with my NP, our whole structure at the healthcare system changed, 
you know. We always had nurse directors but not nurse managers. So, the process was that we were 
gonna have nurse managers on every unit. She said, “Well, Deb, you need to manage this unit,” and I’m 
thinking, “I can't do that. I'm gonna be a nurse practitioner.” It was sorta weird because I work with all 
these people. How can I manage them and lead them? So, with her mentorship, I loved it because the 
impact then as a leader was more profound because you're not only impacting the patient care, you're 
impacting your team, you know, encouraging your team to go on for continuing education, degrees, 
programs, you know. I've had secretaries that have gone on to become nurses. I've had patient care techs 
go on to be nurses. I think about my own journey. Just obtaining my Associate's Degree in Nursing, I 
think it took me forever. I think it took me, like, almost 10 years to get that degree, and it was the 
toughest degree. 
  
CH 
I'm in good company. We have a similar background actually. 
  
DS 
Awesome, awesome. Then to get my bachelor's, I'm like, “Oh, okay.” It took me forever to get into the 
community college. 
  
CH 
Which community college was that? 
  
DS  09:48 
I went to Monroe Community College in Rochester, New York. While I was taking courses to get into 
the nursing program there, there was a waitlist, always a waitlist. I can remember the year I got in, I was 
number 132. I said, “I'm never getting in again. I'm gonna have to take some more classes as I'm 
waiting.” So-- ‘cause I planned to go on to get my bachelor's, but I didn't know that I was gonna 
continue to have to take classes waiting to get into the associate program. It never dawned on me, “Why 
don't you just go to the bachelor's program?” Didn't dawn on me back then. So, I got called that year and 
I could not believe that I got in. It was just-- It was hard. I always worked one to two jobs, being a single 
XXXXXXX

parent. My daughter was more than a latchkey kid. She was amazing. She did well in school, but also 
never knew what she wanted to do. Now she's a nurse. I'm very proud of her. But it was just the journey 
from becoming-- ‘cause I remember when I was going to school to be an LPN, I was a home health aide 
and I didn't have a car. I remember taking the bus multiple places, times a day, to go to the different 
homes and, you know, you just think about those struggles and talk about resilience and tenacity and 
determination, but also ensuring that I-- I also had great support systems. My parents, you know, even 
though they were a million miles away and my grandmother was local, I had lots of support. Marcel's 
grandparents were very supportive. 
  
CH 
Marcel is your daughter? 
  
DS  
Is my daughter, yes. So, I knew that with support and with my determination I could be okay. Might not 
be a perfect, easy path, but I could be okay. Even at work, not realizing, you know, the impact that a 
mentor can have on you, the opportunities, you know, writing job descriptions and problem solving, you 
know, the evaluation piece of nursing. P.D.C.A. – Plan, Do, Check, Act – for process and quality 
improvements, all those things, you know. You just think, “Oh, okay. That's a great opportunity,” or you 
have an opportunity to be on a committee and you're like, “Okay, I'll do that.” It just taught me that you 
just never say no, which could be a bad thing too, but you don't say no, and you just see where the 
opportunity takes you. So, fast forward years, you know, I've worked as a nurse manager. I was the 
director of nursing for our women's care unit and radiology and the emergency department. I remember 
the chief nursing officer at Newark-Wayne Community Hospital was gonna retire and our CEO said, 
“Well, Deb, I think you should, you know, take that on as an intro. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you’ll 
want to do it, you know, full time.” So, I remember going out there. It was, like, 40 minutes east of 
Rochester, and I'm thinking, “I can't drive 40 minutes every day. This is crazy.” You know, I didn't see 
anyone that looked like me. I'm like, “Oh, I don't know. First of all, is it safe?” You know, you hear 
horror stories of people being stopped by the police and all that. But the welcome that I got was 
amazing. People were so kind. 
  
CH 
Was it a genuine kindness? 
  
DS 
I would say yes. I would say that there was definitely unconditional love there. I think the difference is 
the way that you treat people and the way that you speak to them and the way that you include them. I 
truly believed and still do today that shared governance is the only way to lead, that I can't be the expert. 
I might know a few things, but the answers are with the people that do the job every day. They just need 
the tools and equipment. They need the resource, whether it's human or a process or a piece of 
equipment to make the job happen. What I found at Newark was the sense of pride. It’s a rural 
community. We were the only healthcare provider in that county. But the sense of pride and, you know, 
people would say, “Oh, you're gonna-- they're not gonna accept you ‘cause you're an outsider”, ‘cause I 
didn't live in the community. I didn't grow up in the community. But I immersed myself in the 
community. I wanted to understand, you know. I had my leaders take me on a tour. We made it fun, but 
take me on a tour. What's in Wayne County? Going to the-- The big thing every summer was the Wayne 
County Fair. I've never been to a fair. I mean, I would go to amusement parks once in a blue moon, but 
XXXXXXX 
7 
 
I've never been to a fair. So, it was new experiences for me too. But I had to get myself immersed in the 
community. I went to some of the churches and, you know, just different things so that I could 
understand what people experienced there. I think that helped me, I don't want to use the word “get 
accepted”, but people believed that I was genuine and that I cared about them. But it was eye opening 
for me. We had this negative tone of the zip code in which you live, you know, determined if you were, 
you know, accepted or not, or, you know, you were smarter than the next zip code or whatever. People 
in Wayne County would refer to themselves as “three-one-fivers”, and I was like, “What is that? Why 
do you say that?” and they said, “Well, you know, you know, we are, you know, farm country.” I said, 
“It sounds derogatory,” and people would say, “Yeah, it is if you think about it that way.” I said, “Well, 
why would we wanna be referred to in a negative tone?” It was, for me, the first time that I understood 
diversity from the lens of socio-economic versus race. Because it was a farming, working county 
community, they were perceived very differently than the more-- the urban, you know, blue collar 
worker, professional workers. I really worked hard with them to say, “You're not a three-one-fiver. You 
are a resident of Wayne County,” you know. “Elevate yourself,” you know. What we do here is great 
things, and a lot to be proud of, not this derogatory thing. But it was the first time that I saw how 
socioeconomics played in the community and, you know, there were a lot of people that could afford 
healthcare but they chose not to. Some of that was getting out in the community to do service, whether 
it's blood pressure screenings, you know, talking about meds, talking about advanced care planning, 
made a difference for that community. The teams, you know, they-- I can remember saying to one of the 
secretaries-- She wanted to order a new cart. The wheels were, like, noisy. “You need to get a new cart”. 
She came back and she said, “I found one for $67,” and I'm, like, “Great,” and she's like, “Can I order 
it?” and I’m like, “Yes, it’s $67.” I said, “It's okay to order a new cart.” It was like they had such pride in 
their work, in the, you know. They spent money like it was theirs. They weren’t, you know, wasteful and 
it really was refreshing. I actually walked away when I left there for another opportunity in our health 
system. It was really neighbors caring for neighbors, you know. People come to the hospital. They knew 
it was, you know, someone's aunt, uncle, neighbor, so it really was an environment where we were 
caring for our families. So, it was very refreshing. Then, I had the opportunity to be the system VP for 
patient safety and quality. Here again I'm like, “I really don't know anything about this, but okay.” It was 
wonderful, ‘cause it was really looking at the lens from the patient, you know, patient experience. You 
can’t have quality of care without good patient experience. They go hand in hand and, you know, our 
metrics, understanding our CAUTI’s and CLABSI’s and-- 
  
CH 
CAUTI’s and CLABSI’s? What’s that? 
  
DS 
Yeah, so, central line-associated bloodstream infection is a CLABSI, and a CAUTI is a catheter-
associated urinary tract infection. 
  
CH  
Alright. Thank you for that. 
  
DS 
Of course. Our own alphabet and--- 
  
CH 
XXXXXXX 
8 
 
Jargon there. 
  
DS  19:35 
Yes, yes. You know, trying to understand, get to the root cause. Why do we have these? Why do they 
happen? Is it a practice? Is it a supply? Again, looking at the data. We have a health system of nine 
hospitals, and so looking at who has the least number of infections and going and asking them, “Well, 
what are you doing? How is this different here than any place else?” What we found, it was a cap, an 
alcohol-impregnated cap for the end cap of the catheter that made the huge difference. So, we 
implemented that across the system and our catheter-associated bloodstream infections went to zero in 
four months. But again, going to the people that know the work. The other piece for me in my history in 
healthcare and nursing is becoming a member of Chi Eta Phi Sorority. When I met my husband, my 
husband is a Tuskegee grad, one of the first things he said, “Are you a Chi nurse?” and I said “What is 
that? A Chi nurse?” He says, “Chi Eta Phi. Those are the nurses that are always in green and yellow.” 
  
CH 
He knew about Chi Eta Phi, wow! 
  
DS 
[Inaudible 20:58] Tuskegee. He said, “Oh.” He says, “It's a great organization,” you know. I said, “I 
don't do sororities,” you know. He says, “It's more than a sorority. They're nurses.” I said, “Okay.” Well, 
funny enough, one of my instructors from LPN school had an informational, probably months later, to-- 
she reached out to all of, you know, people she knew and some of her old students, and I was one of her 
students, at least three times to come and get an information on Chi Eta Phi. I’m like, “Well, that’s the 
organization my husband’s-- Well, ok. I’ll go.” I went the last session, came in late, like, “I'm just gonna 
be here to be nice ‘cause you're my former instructor.” I was like, “Wow. It's pretty cool. They focus on 
service for humanity? Really? Health promotion, partnering with other organizations and professionals. 
This is interesting.” Well, lo and behold, she convinced me. She says, “Well, you should be the leader to 
get us going,” and I said, “Okay.” 
  
CH 
What chapter was that? 
  
DS 
Beta Chi Chi, in Rochester, New York. 
  
CH 
That was an undergraduate chapter? 
  
DS 
A graduate chapter. 
  
CH 
Graduate chapter. 
  
DS 
XXXXXXX 
9 
 
Yeah. We chartered on January 8, 2005. I was the chartering president. Connie Sumner was our regional 
director. It was just an amazing experience. 
  
CH 
There you go making history again, right? You're just the innovator, the mover, the shaker. 
  
DS 
It's really having great people in my path that I just-- we just work together to make things happen. 
  
CH 
What region is Beta Chi Chi in? 
  
DS 
Beta Chi Chi is in the northeast region. You know, Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated, for me, brings all 
my passions together. You know, I never had a sister, so the sisterhood. My one brother, and so having 
the Fraters to be brothers, that's great too. The opportunity for leadership growth and development, for 
community outreach in a more organized way. We were doing things, but here you have, you know, 
programs like the hypertensive screening or the kidney disease prevention as examples, or the March of 
Dimes or St. Jude. So, really bringing all of those passions of eliminating healthcare disparities, 
educating members of the community, especially people that look like me, and making better choices or 
informed choices about their healthcare. They're impacting their networks and their communities. Then, 
nursing students, our future. It's really funny because after we chartered, we maybe were a chapter a 
couple years, and I remember Soror Sumner saying, you know, “Do you think Beta Chi Chi could host 
the regional conference?” and I'm like-- I said, “Yes,” but I said, “but let me talk to the chapter first. But 
I would say yes.” The chapter was like, “What? We're brand new. We don't even know what we're doing 
yet.” “We got this. We can do this,” and we did. We hosted the 2009 northeast region in Rochester, New 
York. 
  
CH 
I was there. 
  
DS 
It was such an honor. We learned a lot. It was great. It was also great for our community in Rochester to 
see us. We did not have a Black Nurses Association, not a Hispanic Nurses Association, so we were the 
first professional organization with nurses of color that our community saw. So, we had lots of 
partnerships with Excellus BlueCross and BlueShield. We did a lot of advanced care planning with 
them, other community agencies. We were out in the barbershops and beauty salons long before it 
became a popular route for health promotion. So, we were really trailblazers and didn't really know it at 
the time. 
 
CH 
And the community embraced you all? 
  
DS 
XXXXXXX 
10 
 
Yes, very much so. Churches. We were sought after to come and speak. “Can you come and do this? 
Can you be,” you know, “do the blood pressure screening? Can you speak to the youth?” Again, just for 
me, from my seat, I'm like, “Oh, this is great. This is what we're supposed to be doing.” 
  
CH 
And free of charge. 
  
 
DS 
And volunteering, yeah. Giving back to the communities in which we live. So, it was just amazing to 
me. Fast forward a couple years later, we wanted to have a Beta chapter-- 
  
CH 
Which is undergraduate? 
  
DS 
Yes, so there are some students. In having the undergraduate chapter, the nursing students, we didn't 
have one college or university so, at the time, we were able to charter a citywide chapter, so it welcomed 
all schools of nursing. It was wonderful. We chartered in November of 2008. 
  
CH 
Were you still the president? 
  
DS  26:43 
I was still the president of the chapter. Let’s see, two supreme Basili ago, Soror Elcedo Bradley was the 
national organizer at the time. It was just wonderful. We had-- Lillian Stokes was our national president 
at the time. Again, very humbling to have the national officers present and our regional officers. Soror 
Sumner was-- Sorry, Soror Gwen Johnson was our regional director at the time, and it was just 
wonderful. We just had a good mentorship and support from both the regional level and the national 
level. We had those Beta students, undergraduate students. Many of them went on to become members 
in our graduate chapter. There's a few that are still active. Some have moved out of the area, but a few 
still active in our graduate chapter. So, we're very proud of them. One of the Betas was my daughter, not 
in the chartering but years later, when she decided that, “I guess I should be a nurse. That's what I need 
to do.” Again, I’m very proud of her. She became a member. I think she was always, like, a booster I 
call her, because she, you know, I can remember her stuffing envelopes and helping to create things on 
the-- electronically. So, always had a role along with my very supportive husband. So, when she became 
a member, it was so natural for her. Again, very proud of her. She had the opportunity to be the chapter 
president of the undergraduate chapter. She did the role of Dean of Membership, and then she held some 
offices at the national level as our Third Vice President and our Dean of Sponsors. I think that, for me, 
fast forward a few years later, had the opportunity to grow our licensed practical nursing program at our 
health system. The program at Isabella Graham Hart School of Practical Nursing has been around since 
1964. We had about 60 graduates a year and our CEO said, “Deb, I need that program grown. We need 
nurses.” This was long before the pandemic. This was 2016. So, he said, you know, “Let's see if we can 
double the enrollment in two years or in three years.” 
  
CH 
XXXXXXX 
11 
 
Now, he put you in charge of the school? 
  
DS 
Yes. 
  
CH 
Did you have another position? 
  
DS 
I was still in quality [laughs]. 
  
CH 
Okay. So, you were doing two jobs? 
  
DS 
Yes, yes. 
  
CH 
Two salaries [laughs]. 
  
DS 
No. 
  
CH 
I thought I'd just throw that out there [laughs]. 
  
DS  
But what was really interesting about this, I was just sort of helping them facilitate. I had no idea that it 
was gonna lead to where I am today. When I did this, not only did we double the school, we actually 
tripled, quadrupled the school in two years. The enrollment. Not only did we just increase enrollment, 
we increased the diversity. The program historically had about 30% African American, Latinx and 
mixed-race students. We flipped that totally. So, now about 58% of the students are from African 
American, Latinx and mixed races. Truly opened doors and changed lives. One of the things I did was I 
actually went through the application process, and there were built-in structural racism pieces and 
expectations that are just meant to keep us out. 
  
CH 
And unrealistic. 
  
DS 
Unrealistic. 
 
CH 
To be practical. 
  
DS 
XXXXXXX 
12 
 
Exactly, yes. Oh yeah. There was a requirement that you had to have college-level courses-- 
  
CH 
To be an LPN? 
  
DS 
To be an LPN, and to even get into the program. 
  
CH 
Okay, that sounds different. 
  
DS 
So, when I spoke to people, what would happen is they would go to register for these courses at a 
community college and they'd say, “Well, let's test you.” We know we don't do well on standardized 
tests. However, that means you have to take this, this and this class. You're burning out your financial 
aid. Then they'll say, “Oh, you want to be a nurse? Okay, well, take these courses.” Then, you’re 
burning out your financial aid, a lot of hope that you're gonna get into the nursing program but you don't 
score high enough in their rubric. So, it was a snowball effect of you'll never get into nursing school, so 
we'll give you some degree later on down the road that really doesn't get you anything. 
  
CH 
For most African American people, we need those degrees where we can have gainful employment. 
  
DS 
Exactly, and make an impact, you know. So, what we saw was students that were almost-- that had 
almost depleted their financial aid. It's how-- In New York State they get TAP, and they don't have a 
degree, or they have a degree that doesn't get them a job or, you know. So, I looked at-- I worked with 
our state Education and Office of Professions to change the criteria for admission. 
  
CH 
You were able to make that impact? 
  
DS  32:43 
Yeah. That was number one, number one. Number two, we had to make sure that we had the resources 
and supports, because just because you decide to go to school today doesn't mean that you leave all your 
home life, your challenges at the door. So, many of our students have challenges - not so good 
relationships, not good support systems. So, we had to build an infrastructure with counselors and 
community partners and funding so that we could provide the support to students so that they can be 
successful, you know. There's times I have students-- I had a student reach out just yesterday to say they 
need to apply for emergency funds because they're two months behind on their rent and they're gonna 
have to choose whether to continue the program or not. She's an excellent student. If we're gonna help 
her truly get out of poverty, create increased economic mobility for her, more stability for her and her 
family, we need to find the resources to support her. But not only the resources, but how do we ensure 
that this doesn't happen again for you? So, we have a team working on that. That's just one example. But 
what was really interesting as I grew the program and in my spare time, I said, “Well, gosh. Why don't 
XXXXXXX 
13 
 
we get an RN program? We need more RNs.” When you look at our data, about 40% of our LPNs did 
go on to become RNs at some point. So, I'm-- 
  
CH 
From the school that you're the administrator of? 
  
DS 
Yeah, well, the school did not offer an RN program. 
  
CH 
So, that school has LPN and RN now. 
  
DS 
Now it does. 
  
CH 
Okay, and how long has the RN program been in existence? 
  
DS 
We just graduated our first cohort in December of last year. So, during the pandemic, I wrote-- I reached 
out to the state and I said, you know, “I'd like to have a nursing associate’s program,” ‘cause we have a 
lot of baccalaureate programs and we can build partnerships with people who can go on and get their 
bachelor's. Also thinking about what was my journey, you know? How could it be better? ‘Cause I had a 
long waiting list and all these sort of barriers along the way. So, you know, how can we make a seamless 
transition from LPN to RN, to bachelor's, master's, whatever you want to do? So, working with the 
State, they said, “Well, you have to have a degree-granting institution.” So, I said, “Well, what does that 
mean?” “Well, you have to have a college or university.” I said, “Well, we don't have one of those.” I 
said, “Well, how do you have one of those?” “Oh, it's an application.” So, I remember having a 
conversation with our CEO and I said, “What do you think?” and he said, “Well, develop the business 
plan. Let’s present it to the executives and see what we want to do.” So, I presented the plan and they 
were like, “Wow! You think we can do this?” I'm like, “We do anything we put our mind to and 
resources” [chuckles]. So, we did. I submitted the application, had to go through our board approval. 
What was interesting was that was a challenge, you know. We had board members that said, “Well, why 
do you need another nursing school? You have tons in our area.” “Well, we-- the students are not 
coming to us. We need to grow our own,” you know. This was before the pandemic. So, it did get board 
approval. That was a whole learning experience, an experience in just how do you ensure that you have 
the votes to be successful in the boardroom? That was a whole ‘nother class I took with my CEO. So, it 
was all supported, submitted the application January of 2020 to the State, then the pandemic hit. So, I'm 
like, “We’re never gonna get this approved,” you know. “This is not gonna happen.” Then, in September 
of 2020, got the notification that they approved us to be a degree-granting institution. We accepted our 
first students in March of ‘21 and they graduated in December of ‘21. We currently have 100% 
completion, 100% employment, and an 83% pass rate, first time board passage. We have 63 students 
that are enrolled right now in the RN program and we have 284 practical nursing students. 
  
CH 
XXXXXXX 
14 
 
Your RN program, did they come from another discipline? Did they already have a degree? Because 
you-- with the timeframe you mentioned, that was like a year or so. 
  
DS 
So, we have two ways that you can enter. You can come in as a transfer student if you have your gen 
ed's and it's one year, or if you need your gen ed's, you can enroll as a two-year student and complete it 
that way. So, the first cohort that completed was a one-year. They completed-- Those two-year students 
that were enrolled at that time are now becoming one-year students, so they'll graduate in June, where 
we'll have 48 graduates in June. Then, we have 63 two-year students currently enrolled. 
  
CH                                                                                                       
 
So, it seems like in your career path as a leader, you have really honed in on socioeconomics - 
socioeconomics to improve health outcomes, to bridge relationships with the community, and also to 
increase nursing school enrollment. 
  
DS 
Enrollment and diversity of the student body that will lead to the diversity of the workforce. 
  
CH 
I wanna go back to-- I have so many things I want to ask you about, but I wanna go back to your 
education. So, you have-- you're a nurse practitioner, a geriatrician nurse practitioner. 
  
DS 
Geriatric nurse practitioner. 
  
CH 
And then you have another master's. 
  
DS 38:48 
I have a Master's in Business Administration. So, at work, I created a program, a post-baccalaureate 
certificate program with one of our college partners, Rochester Institute of Technology, where nurses 
with a baccalaureate degree that wanted leadership can take some business courses and earn a certificate. 
When they earn that certificate, it also provides them a third of an MBA. So, I participated in the first 
cohort with some other nurses that we selected, and at the end when we received our certificates, I 
decided I was going to go on and complete the Master's in Business Administration. So, I did that. 
 
CH 
Your concentration for the Master’s of Business Administration, was that leadership? 
  
DS 
It was an executive MBA, but we got everything from accounting to business development, marketing, 
the whole gamut. That really helped me at the time when I was in quality and patient safety, ‘cause I was 
so focused on the outcomes but I never thought about the business side of quality, or the business side of 
poor quality. So, for every hospital-acquired condition, whether it was a central line bloodstream 
infection, a patient fall with injury, there's a dollar associated with every one of those. So, I got my 
CFO’s attention when I presented at a meeting and said, you know, “Our reduction in central line 
XXXXXXX 
15 
 
bloodstream infections saved the organization just over 2 million dollars.” He wanted to understand, you 
know, dollar signs, like, “How does that happen?” So, there's a cost per central line infection and if you 
multiply that-- and we're at this many, you know. We're at 20 and they're worth $1,000 apiece, and then 
you get to zero, those are savings. So, there's a cost to poor quality. So, he was very interested in that 
and wanted, okay, “What's the cost of a fall? What's the cost”-- It was awesome. So, my business, from 
learning the whole business administration track and understanding there's a cost for everything and a 
value, and there's the human value, but there's also the value financially, from a cost avoidance 
perspective. 
  
 
CH  
And certainly that is important, because healthcare, after all, is a business. 
  
DS 
Yes, and if we are wasting our resources and causing harm, that's not the business we're in. We're in to 
take care of people. 
  
CH 
‘Cause we are supposed to be providing quality care. Master’s, 2 master’s, and you have a doctorate as 
well? 
  
DS  41:40 
Yes, my doctorate is in education, in executive leadership. The program I went to was accelerated. I did 
it two years, every Friday and Saturday for two years. Again, any program that I've taken over the 
journey is not just about earning the degree. I learned as a person, as a professional so much, and I just 
can't think of any situation, any experience, that has been not good, you know. Getting back to the 
school, so now we have a degree-granting institution. We have both a practical nursing program, the 
Associate’s in Applied Science program. We're looking at other programs. We've received in the last 
couple years just over 3 million dollars in scholarship dollars, and then, just yesterday, another million 
dollars from the federal government supporting the increase of diversity from a race and ethnicity as 
well as a gender. It's about 15% of our student body are males in nursing, and that's better than the 
national average. The congressman who presented us the million dollars, he said, you know, what we're 
doing is making a huge difference in getting people out of poverty. So, it's awesome to get the 
recognition, it’s awesome to get the million dollars yesterday, but we are changing lives of people. One 
of the reporters asked me, well, you know, “What are you doing to-- How do you get the students 
involved?” you know. “How do you get the pipeline?” and I said, you know, wearing my diversity, 
equity, and inclusion hat, “We have to get to the children younger.” So, we partnered with our Rochester 
City School District to create what's called the Scrubs Club program, where K through 12th graders have 
the opportunity to participate in activities. So, like, our K through third graders had a Teddy Bear Clinic 
and some-- another group had a Stop the Bleed session, and another group did dressing changes and 
Heimlich’s and CPR. So, everyone gets that opportunity, and we always bring in speakers that look like 
the students, because if you can't see a physician that looks like you or a nurse that looks like you, you 
would never think that, “Oh, do I wanna be like you?” alright. So, I truly believe that you've got to see it 
to be it, and so exposing young people to people that look like them in the various professions. Our 
system vice president of pharmacy is a Black man, and so when we bring in the Black youth, we always 
XXXXXXX 
16 
 
bring him to speak to them because he can encourage them, like, “Wow! I never thought about being a 
pharmacist.” 
  
CH 
“And I can do this.” 
  
DS 
Absolutely. 
  
CH 
“I can see myself in that role.” What is your position at the nursing school? 
DS  
So, I'm the president of the college and I'm also the Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer for 
our health system. 
  
CH 
Okay. Talk to me about that. 
  
DS 
So, in 2020, June of 2020-- We never had a Diversity Officer before. It was always thought that every 
leader is taking care of diversity, you know. Everyone's doing it; no one's doing it. But we've had some 
really great programs for our underserved communities and-- but, you know, there was opportunity to 
really bring it together, have a strategic plan and focus. So, I was appointed our Chief Diversity Officer 
for the health system by the board. I have a small department, but the department impacts everyone. So, 
we started out with recruitment. So, I have a wonderful system director who is-- she was the inaugural 
Chief Diversity Officer for the State of Pennsylvania, and I was able to recruit her to Rochester. So, we 
started out with foundational training and education to our 21,000 employees. What is unconscious bias? 
What are microaggressions? What is health equity? Things like that. Once we finish that education at 
that level, then we are gonna go into a little bit more detail around social determinants of health and our 
role and responsibility as a healthcare system. A lot of people say, “Well, we’re in healthcare. We don't 
do that,” but without education, which we're doing-- We're providing the gateway with the college for 
more people of color to be educated. When we're educating more, they have the economic mobility. 
They have the healthcare education so they can make better informed decisions as well as for their 
families. They're going to have better financial situation, all the things that are impacting the health of 
our community. So, we're doing it, step by step. During this visit today, we had the-- she actually came 
down today to meet with myself and some leaders from Johns Hopkins. 
  
CH 
Here? 
  
DS 
Here. 
  
CH 
Oh, here. By the way, we are at the Live Hotel and Casino at the 70th Northeast Regional Conference 
and Leadership Workshops. So, you've been to John Hopkins today as well? 
XXXXXXX 
17 
 
  
DS 
Yes. 
  
CH 
Okay. Never a dull moment for you right now. So, your inclusion person came from Rochester. 
  
DS 
Yes, she's here with me. 
  
 
CH 
Okay. 
  
DS  47:50 
Yeah, we came. The purpose for her to be here is not to attend the Conference, but she's like, “Wow! 
I've never seen so much green and yellow. These are all nurses?” you know. So, she's like, “This is 
great.” But we wanted to have-- take the opportunity while I was gonna be here to meet with Johns 
Hopkins. They have done some amazing work, again, in my belief of: The answers to the problems and 
the challenges are in the community. So, they've been doing some work, some community outreach 
where they work with folks in the community that want to make things better. So, whether it's food 
deserts or some type of sustainability program, they're providing funds to help support-- funds and some 
education. So, education around business development, business ownership, various things, you know, 
financial planning and things like that that will help them to have a sustainable business. 
  
CH 
Is housing included in that program? 
  
DS 
Yes, yes. So, we wanted to understand, “Well, how did you do that? How did you get the community 
involved?” you know, ‘cause we have some great relationships with churches and some other 
community-based organizations. So, you know, there were, like, four simple questions, and the long and 
short, we're gonna develop an ongoing relationship where they're gonna mentor us so that we can 
replicate that. 
  
CH 
Johns Hopkins? 
  
DS 
Will mentor us in Rochester. 
  
CH 
Wonderful. 
  
DS 
Yes. 
XXXXXXX 
18 
 
  
CH 
You are such a mover, shaker, change agent. We are very fortunate to have you as a part of Chi Eta Phi 
Sorority Incorporated. So, you have not only been your local chapter president, but you have had other 
positions on the regional and the national levels. Talk to us about that. 
  
DS 
Yes, another humbling opportunity. So, I was the 18th northeast regional director. 
  
CH 
I saw you move pretty quickly [laughs]. 
DS 
Yes, yes, yes. 
  
CH 
I was watching you [both laugh]. 
  
DS 
Again, great mentors: Connie Sumner, Gwen Johnson, Peola McCaskill. So many great-- Elcedo 
Bradley, Lillian Stokes, Mildred Fennal. All of these trailblazers mentored me, coached me, engaged 
me, you know. No one ever said, “Oh no. You don't need to know that.” No one ever said, “It's not your 
time.” It was always encouragement, you know. When you love Chi you just love it. It’s family. So, the 
support that I've gotten from the membership and then key individuals to say, “Yes. Why don't you try 
this committee?” you know. “Maybe you should get on this committee then you'll learn about this,” you 
know. “Get on the bylaws, get on protocol.” So, you get to understand, ‘cause it's one thing to read the 
operations manual, but when you're immersed in it as a member, an active member of the committee, 
that really is important. 
  
CH 
You're living it more than just looking at it on paper. You become it? 
  
DS 
Yes. 
  
CH 
Mentorship is then very essential. 
  
DS 
Beyond essential and, you know, you have the formal mentors and you have the informal, and you learn 
from everyone, you know. You have to be willing to always be open and willing to listen, and you just 
never know. You're always, you know-- I always tell students and my colleagues, you never know who's 
watching you, you know. When you see someone hardworking, dedicated, committed, you know, those 
are the people that we want on our boards. Those are the people we want on our committees. You can't 
fake those things, ‘cause it's hard work. Volunteering is hard work. So, when you see someone who's 
willing to chip in or to answer questions, it's like, “Oh, that might be someone we need to keep an eye 
on for the next board opportunity or the next committee opportunity.” So, you start to take the time to 
XXXXXXX 
19 
 
talk to people, you know. “What are your interests? What do you do?” like, “Where do you work? 
What's your-- ” you know. So, you get to understand how you can maybe take the puzzle and put it 
together when, you know, this piece is open here, maybe this person could fit that. Then, also being 
willing, even though, you know, people are elected, there's some appointments, but you have to be 
willing to also still be available to those people, because you can't just say, “Yep, you got it. Let it rip.” 
You have to check in or build the infrastructure so that other people can check in. So, things like that. 
  
CH 
Networking is an essential function of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. I would say that that probably 
should be another one of our model projects. I do believe that one of our aims is to develop nurse 
leaders. 
DS 
Yes, it is. 
  
CH 
And mentoring and networking is essential. Okay. So, you were the regional director and then you had 
what position? 
  
DS 
And then I was a-- I was elected to the Second Vice President. That was another, again, bringing all my 
passions together: the love of Chi Eta Phi, the love of education, continuing education-- 
  
CH 
Is that the role of the Second Vice President, to develop education? 
  
DS 
Education. It is to also ensure that we have the American Nurses Credentialing Center's accreditation to 
provide continuing education units for our members. I had the privilege and the honor to go through the 
re-accreditation process. It's very similar to a magnet process. It's the only thing I could equate it to. You 
write to the standards, you have given samples, ensuring that we have processes for checks and balances 
that, you know, conflicts of interests are identified. Truly a high integrity process. 
  
CH 
That's for the education offerings for Chi Eta Phi? 
  
DS 
For Chi Eta Phi, yes. 
  
CH 
You are going to be presenting at this conference and your topic is academic nursing and building a 
curriculum based on diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
  
DS 
Yes. 
  
CH 
XXXXXXX 
20 
 
And this is needed if future populations are to achieve health equity. Can you unpack that for us a little 
bit? 
  
DS  55:13 
Yes. So, health equity-- to define health equity, it's really ensuring that there are no barriers to everyone 
having access to high quality care. It's eliminating those barriers. Those barriers can be social 
determinants of health, such as education, financial. You know, the zip code matters for many people. 
Food, infant mortality, you name it. 
 
CH 
Psychological most definitely. 
DS 
Mental health as well, yep. Health and wellness. We want to ensure that we eliminate those barriers. We 
have to start teaching what that means. There are people, believe it or not, that have no clue that we have 
inequities. You would think that, “Have you lived under a rock?” 
  
CH 
[Laughing] That’s why I’m laughing. It’s unrealistic. 
  
DS 
Some people will think that it's the individual’s responsibility and issue. It's not our issue as a society. 
So, we have to educate, right, and what we also have to do in our curriculum is ensure that we are 
building opportunities. So, for instance, our new SIM lab that we put together three years ago has 
diverse skin tone mannequins. Just number one. Our task trainers, when we are dressing wounds, we 
bring in the different-- the variations in skin tones, because things look different depending on the color 
of your skin. We also ensure that we have the cultural, ethnicity, age differences when we're teaching 
something. So, heart disease, for instance, or, you know, maybe it is mobility, maybe it's post-surgery. 
We know that religions play a big part in how people heal. We have to also ensure that in the 
curriculum, that we are taking people through that journey. So, we have incorporated a poverty 
simulation that all of our students, faculty, and staff go through each semester. So, what they do is 
there's different stations so, you know, it's someone who needs a bus pass, someone who needs food, 
someone who doesn't have a babysitter, and you are actually living the stress of those individuals in our 
community. It's an eye opener. Then, we debrief that. We also ensure that our students are caring for 
diverse patients, because it's real easy to always have the CHF patient that's white and 65 years old. 
However, the African American who has A, B, C, or D is also a great learning opportunity for the 
students. Then also, incorporating, again, when you're caring for a patient, what are their cultural 
differences? Not good, bad or indifferent, but how do we address them? How do we ensure that we're 
meeting their needs, you know? Not everyone is, you know-- Some people would want to have prayer 
and maybe they don't have a minister, so how would you ensure that they have that clergy representative 
from our health system or the community that can come in and give them what they need? We also 
know that COVID highlighted for us the fact that the healthcare disparities have not made a move. We're 
still not good. So, what are we doing about that? For me, it was really important. I had COVID. I had 
COVID. I was diagnosed with COVID the week after the first case in Rochester. At that time, we didn't 
know what we know today and it was a very scary time. But if we take that-- if we take my experience 
there and how sick I was, I know that I never want to see anyone go through that. So, it was important to 
me, for me, that our healthcare organization get out in front of many different cultures, races in our 
XXXXXXX 
21 
 
community and talk about the importance of vaccination before it became available. We reached over 
200,000 people, and, you know, it was Zoom, it was going to the churches, it was just various venues, 
but it was important for me that people needed to hear that COVID was real, that it does impact us, 
people of color more so, and that we have choices to make it not impact us that way. But we want them 
to be educated. I couldn't say, “You have to go get vaccinated.” I can say what I did and why, but also 
give the facts so that they can make an informed decision. I will say we moved the needle, not as much 
as we would like to, but we did move it and we continue to have those conversations in our community. 
  
 
 
 
CH 
Conversations, conversations. There's so much conversation. In my opinion, very little movement 
towards moving that needle to even the middle for inclusion and to just make the gap with disparities in 
healthcare smaller. What's the solution? 
  
DS  1:01:06 
The solution is what we're planning to do is get out into the community. The answers are there. We need 
to hear from people, you know. First of all, do you realize that your health is not the same as your white 
counterpart? We have to educate to that. Do you realize we have choices? We can make informed 
decisions. We can do things differently so that we don't have a shorter lifespan. I think people have to 
hear that. I don't think-- Some people just don't realize that. This is just the way life has always been. 
  
CH 
So, what about the other part, the more privileged, who-- 
  
DS 
They have to know too. 
  
CH 
Who, we know, act like they live under a rock. 
  
DS 
We have to educate them. Now, we know that there's gonna be people that buy in and drink the Kool-
Aid and say, “Yep, I'm with you,” and there's gonna be those that, “That's not my problem,” but there's 
gonna be more people that want to do something about it, but we have to educate them. 
  
CH  
You feel that way? 
  
DS 
Yes, I do. 
  
CH 
You sincerely feel that way? 
  
XXXXXXX 
22 
 
DS 
Yeah. I think that we've got to break down the structural challenges. It's gonna take changes in law. It's 
gonna take holding people in organizations accountable. It's not gonna happen tomorrow, but it will and 
it can happen if we stay the course. 
  
CH 
You really think there's a possibility that this will be a sustainable change? 
  
 
 
 
DS 
I do. I think that-- I don't know that we'll see it in my lifetime, but I think that if we don't, we're not 
gonna have a future, because we know that the population is gonna change, or it is changing. It's gonna 
change even more, so if we don't address it, we will have no population. 
  
CH  
What do you feel is a good quality for a nurse leader to possess? 
  
DS  
Integrity, commitment, having the skill of being able to listen, not always thinking that you have to have 
all the answers but at least you know where to go and it's usually to your team, to the community. It's 
about how do you let people know they're valued, you know? So, that recognition, you know. One of the 
things I’m really happy about in the region was we added a few more recognitions of our members, you 
know. We recognized the first Betas during one of my conferences that I led. I think it's really important 
not to forget our history and also to build upon that and understand what were the lessons that we can 
learn from today? What's gonna help us be strong? ‘Cause sometimes, what we've done 20 years ago or 
50 years ago well, “Wow! Why didn't we think about doing that now?” you know. There is value, and 
sometimes it's-- things may have worked in a smaller scale, but then what are the supports we need to 
make it work in a larger scale? 
  
CH  
Finally, to our beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated, what are your thoughts and words of wisdom 
towards service for humanity? 
  
DS 
I strongly believe that we are here for a purpose. I feel very strongly that giving back to mankind, 
womankind is really important. I think that we can make a difference, a small difference, impacting one 
person at a time, communities at a time, and we can't stop that. We have to focus not only on the 
communities that we serve but also in the future of nursing. Our student nurses. Our student nurses need 
a lot. We know that we're dealing with millennials that have more of a focus on work-life balance than 
myself, right? We know that we have to be flexible, but we have to go out and listen to the community. 
What do we need? Services. As nurses, we're servant leaders. Doesn't change. We have to keep focused 
on that. There's a lot of work to be done. Chi Eta Phi can be a leader also in the DEIJ work. 
  
CH 
XXXXXXX 
23 
 
And what is that? 
  
DS 
Diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. Sorry, me and my letters. But I think that that would be-- we 
can lead in this work. We are leading in it in many ways, you know. We were out doing work in the

Soror Dr. Deborah Stamps, for taking part in this truly historical project. When we are no longer on the

definitely have an impact on service for humanity. Thank you so much.
