THE MEYER BROTHERS. 
W ritten by HARRY MORRIS, and sung with immense success at 
TONY PASTOR'S Theatre, by M ORRIS and FIELDS. 
ON 
a 
ship from Germany we came, 
Three weeks ago last Thursday ; 
Dis country we are liking pretty well. 
Wen we're coming from de ship out, 
De both of us was laughing, 
Yen we're hearing de music of Castle Garden bell. 
CHORUS. 
All say—efery day, 
Dot we are getting healdy, 
Und dot you can't tell us from one another, 
Und of any one asks you who we are, 
Why of course den you can tell dem 
Dere is Jakey Meyer und de odor one is his bruchler. 
Yen we are walking Sundays out, 
De girls dey say we're mashers ; 
But we are understanding dis language not. 
Aber wen dey smile und wink dree times, 
-We walk den proud like peacocks, 
"Mid put on all de style dot we hale got. 
All say, etc. 
THE PULLING MACHINE. 
An original recitation. 
Written by HARny MORRIS. 
HE 
was an old bum, all broke up, 
Und walking down de street ; 
In his pocket dere was not one cend, 
He was waiting to get a 
treat. 
About twendy-dree persons he had stopped, 
Und asked if dey could help him ; 
How sad he vas when dev shook dere heads, 
U-nd sait, " Old boy, dot's too thin." 
At last he struck a 
bier saloon, 
He approached it very shy, 
And stood in front as if petrified, 
Humming. " the Sweet By und By." 
But soon he took up courage. 
Una went in where the lunch was spread ; 
He made a 
grab at a 
horse radish, 
Wen a 
beer keg hit his head ; 
He looked arount 
Und sait, " Boys, dot aint fair 
His ears (ley flashed. his eyes sunburnt, 
Und his head stood on his hair. 
De bartender den went up to him, 
Mit joy his face did beam— 
Und says, " Friend, how much can you pull 
On dot dere pulling machine ? " 
De bum walked up to de pulling machine, 
For his anger was aroused, 
And hollered loud. " I'll beat any man here 
Pulling in de house." 
De bet was done ; a 
little man 
De first to pull was made, 
He grabbed the handles and done it well, 
De hands showed dwo hundred eight. 
De bum he was de next to try, 
He wanted a 
good start ; 
( 
1 /1 
THE 
-PULLING MACHLIV E.—Concluded. 
De gang looked at de barkeeper rind sait, 
"Give it to him hard." 
He grabbed de handles mit deathlike grip, 
Und hollered " dot will do,". 
In another second he gale a 
kick, 
Up d 
in dc air flew his left shoe. 
He hollered " Murder," " Watch," " Police," 
Und salt, " Oh, let me go," 
He knocked de skin all off his knees, 
For he did struggle so ; 
The barkeeper at last let him come down, 
He fell on de floor mit a 
crash. 
He didn't wait to go out de door, 
But jumped drough de window und broke de sask. 
Out on de sidewalk dey found hi m  
Laying stiff und stark. 
Dey all took dere hats off und den sang 
" 
Twilight in de park." 
A 
policeman put him in a 
dray ; 
He thought it wasn't right 
To see a 
man disturb the peace, 
Especially if he's tight. 
But alas I 
dot poor old bum was gone, 
He tried hard to wake him up 
By hitting him on de head und feet 
Mit a 
policeman's billy club ; 
Day brought de cor'ner, who felt his pulse, 
Den lookt arount und salt, 
"I'm sorry I 
Here, bring me S. beer, 
Be jabers, the man is dead I" 
De cor'ner's jury sat on him, 
De jurors lookt serene. 
Their verdict was, " He came to death 
From pulling—de pulling machine."

SKATING ON THE POND. 
Written by HARRY MORRIS, and sung by the LANMIS BROTHERS. 
Or all the winter's pleasures, 
The time to pass away, 
The sleighing and snowballing, 
That we have every day ; 
There's one that suits my fancy, 
Of which I 
am quite fond, 
To go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
CHORUS. 
Spread the eagle, oh, how nice, (Sym.) 
Skating backwards on the slippery ice, (Syn.) 
The pleasures of the winter, 
Of none I 
tun so fond, 
As to go dressed up all in my best, 
Skating on the Pond. 
One pleasant winter's evening, 
At half-past seven or eight, 
I 
went to skate upon the pond, 
And there I 
met my fate. 
She was dressed in blue and Astrakan, 
And skipped along la grand. 
My heart was won by a 
pretty girl, 
While Skating on the Pond. 
Spread the eagle, etc.

You can always find at our house 
A

From Peter mid Katherina Straus.

We're happy all day long, 
Und nefer more shall roam ; 
From dear old Germany we come, 
Una Heidelberg's our home. 
Wen we did leafe our German homes, 
We can't forget dot day ; 
Wen on dat ship where we did sail, 
We heard de people say,

To de land of de brave und free ; 
But don't forget your faderland, 
Dot clear old Germany."

Who deep in love did fall. 
With a ' rushing- maid of fort v- five, 
Wh o wa ,:. wrinkled, spare ' tul tall. 
He used to play the double base, 
And he was mad. you bet! 
When be found he had a 
rival 
Who played the clarionet. 
Yes, they were a pretty pair, 
As ever yet was seen ; 
He'd play her gentle music 
On his double bass machine. 
They'd walk out in the moonlight, 
And love stories he'd relate, 
And serenade at evening, 
Or ' neath her window wait, 
But the clarionet man was crafty, 
His hair was fiery red, 
lie made this I 
itutisel promise 
That only he she'd wed, 
Yes, they vrere, (

When the " Double Basser" heard this, 
It Was an awful blow, 
It mad, him feel so very weak, 
II, couldn't hold his bow. 
He made his will that ev,ning, 
On death he did decide, 
He crawled into his double bass, 
And there he calmly died. 
Yes, they were, 4k-c 
The clarionet man was very glad, 
For now he'd claim his bride, 
blowed so hard that evening 
He Wowed himself cross-eyed. 
Every night it form is seen 
With spectacles on his face, 
Playing funeral marAes 
On his ghostly double b ,

If the duns should annoy which very often they do, 
And domestics admit you're in the way, 
Being caught in the imp, and when there's no escape, 
Then the rreatest $a 
mfroid you display ; 
So with calm, smiling face, and with unruffled grace, 
The tormentor it's thus you receive : 
I'm just off to my club, and really cannot be bored, 
And Mister Brown with thanks time take.s his leave. 
Spoken— Now, that's the best of Brmvn, he's so cattily put off, 
Dut at the same time I 
must ask you as a 
particular favor not to 
mention to him that—Cuonus. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy, now, for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be Lad, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, never asking the price, 
For such meanness would truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardy Dardy is no coin of the realm, 
Thot0). I 
find it always seems Ivith me to go. 
Spoken—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be -ron-
lered at, for you see—Camans. 
With our fair sex my Lardy Dardy Do is the go, 
And it secins the sweet darlings to impress; 
I'ye already the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been '
yes 
But the worldly papas, and the cautious mammas, 
When their daughters' affections I 
woo. 
Always say when I 
tell them upon what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy Dardy Do. 
Spoken— Which is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
the flear girls would gladly share my fate, although.—Cumtus. 
In the Times of to- morrow, if you'll kindly. observe, 
Advertised there, this notice then will be : 
Mister Remus MacRomulus is now in town, 
And enabled his pupils to sec ; 
Will instruct in this art, and his genius impart, 
To the brave, to the fair, and the true, 
Who unable to shell out ready L. S. D. 
Can substitute the Lards Dardy Do. 
Spoken—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm open front ten till six 
daily. 
Gentlemen, my terms are moderate, but, of course, ladies 
I 
shall be happy to instruct gratis, as—Cuoans. 
Banjo solo. 'Written by PHIL. H M OWREY. 
Dedicated to Mr. P
TA 
M ILLER, of Philadelphia, Penn. 
Oh, I'll sing to you of a 
nice young gal, 
flay called her Saria Jane, 
She fell in lab wid a 
clam- dealer, 
And Sammy was his name. 
He used to lake lier every Ivheres, 
And her he'd often treat, 
He weroto see her every night, 
At her home ia Lombard street. 
As Saria Jane walked out one day, 
All in the snooper's heat. 
She met her dear young Sam- u- el, 
Wid an 
,, der gal in the street; 
When Sarin Jane she saw this, 
" 
Revenge I'll have," she said. 
So she went and stole a 
sweet- potato, 
And stabbed this Clam 21an dead. 
When dis young gal Sam was walking wid, 
Saw dat he was no more, 
She rushed away wid all her might, 
Into a 
grocery store. 
Oh, there she seized a 
half of a 
cheese, 
Dat on de counter lied. 
She swallowed it do ivn all at once, 
Gave up the ghost and died. 
When Saria Jane saw they were dead, 
She said she'd live uo more, 
So she tried to hang heyself, 
By standing on I 
er bead on de floor. 
She soon foand out, dat wouldn't do, 
So another way she tried, 
Shejutuped off her bed down on de floor, 
Kielved out lie: foots and died.

HE 
gave me a 
pretty red rose, 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said, as he kiss'd me good-bye, 
Wear this in your breast, love, for me. 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will cling : 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing ! 
CHOEL'S. 
My pretty red rose, my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet. little token, my pretty red rose, 
While lonely I 
sigh fur my darling's bright eye, 
fll sing of my pretty red rose ! 
'Tis a 
dear little mera'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
13ut fondly 
treasure its leaves 
Tho' their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls ev'ry sigh to repose ; 
Tho' now we're apart, still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in in y 
pretty red rose!

Und he vos a-drinking some beer— 
If de beer vos a-drinking de Dutchman,

Und sat myself down in a

Und de noise it vos frightful to hear— 
If de boiler vos inside de man, dough, 
Now couldn't dot look kinder queer 1 
I

All for de grand sights for to see, 
A

Mit a

She vos hugging, und kissing him fondly, 
Und called him her own pretty dear— 
If de fat woman sat on de boy, dough, 
Now vouldn't dot look kinder queer 7

Von der man vat kept der blace vas cross der vay. 
Ven I

In society to show I'd peen pefore, 
So I

And purdy soon vent shkipping mul der door. 
Dey vas blayino awful purty kind ov moosic ; 
Dere vas valzes, bolkas, succotaches, too ; 
Der first ting, vas a " solo by a 
quartette," 
Und der nexd vas somevon's 
sympathy in Q." 
Bud der besd ding dat I 
saw blayed in my lifetime 
Vas sometitg dat I'm going to relate ; 
It vas blaying ov a 
lettle game ov " poker," 
Yen a 
fellow blayed two pair I 
had a " shtraight." 
I 
shtayed at dat concert purty 
Till der hour ov ten shtruck twelve upon der clock ; 
My key- hole it couldn't find my night- key, 
Und my house vas blayine- tag around der block. 
My boarding-house keeper vas looking oud der vinder, 
It vas yust so shtill you couldn't drop a 
pin, 
-Yen a 
great big man, mit shield mid club like so big, 
Came and said, " he thought he'd haf to take me in." 
Now, I 
nexd pefore der judge vas prought ub shtanding, 
Mit two bolicemen py me all der time ; 
Yen der judge said to me, " Vat's your ahhelation 'I" 
I

He v.-rode dat on a 
gread big sliced ov baber, 
Und den dat kind judffe to me did say : 
"Hans, you go .ub to der Island ; it's so bleasant, 
Und shtay dere yust three veeks vrom to- day." 
Und I 
said, " Justice, don't you tink dat's blayed end, 
Vat you send me to der Island rioht avay '? 
Here's der man vat keeps der boarding house I

Vill shvare him dot I

Und dot he alvays thought me kinder crazy; 
So Justice, von't you blease to think again'?" 
But der judge righd on dat point vas lefel headed, 
Said he didn't " vant to make me oud insane." 
So I

But I

Or can haf a

SWEET MAGNOLIAS. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by " Les Grotesques Ec-
centrique," 'LILLY and W EST. 
IN a 
cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton flowers blossom fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely little girl 
Who is my heart's delight., 
And at night when little stars were peeping, 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked in happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (
Sym.) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (
Syn.) 
While walking through the scented groves of orange, 
'Neath the calm and silvery light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Now I've wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That dear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back, 
As through the world I 
roam. 
There I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton, 
As they glisten 'neath the calmly shining moon ; 
There's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. etc. 
FALSE ALBERTINA. 
Writen and sung by ALunuT Di VOY. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
While in a 
situation. 
She lived head cook at a 
large hotel, 
Near Shoreditch Railway station, 
Site vowed she loved me faithfully 
And that she would be mine, oh, 
And agteed with toe to share her fate.

But she ran away with a 
Horse-guard Blue, 
I 
wish I 
ne'er had seen her, 
For Fin weeping and Fin willing, and don't know what to 
do, 
For I've lost my Albertina. 
I 
bought her tine dresses and 
New bonnets shawl and laces, 
I 
treated her to Epsom Downs, 
To see the Derby Races. 
"Cwas there site saw this horse-guard Blue, 
Who asked her to take wine. oh, 
Then treated her to the Grand Stand, 
A wretched fate was mine, ob. 
But she ran away, Sce. 
I 
began to see she slighted me, 
So I 
thought I'd go one morning, 
To her and have it all explained, 
But front me take a 
warning. 
For there upon the doorstep 
My rival he was standing, 
I 
flew into a 
dreadful rage, 
And satisfaction was demanding 
But she ran away, Sx. 
My hat lie then smashed o'er my eyes, 
And banged me left and right, sirs, 
A Bobby hard up for a 
job, 
lie collared me for the night, sirs, 
There may plans be some girl unwed, 
Who's lost her false young lover, 
And if she'll have me in his stead, 
We may console each other. 
But she ran away, leo.

W ELL, there, I'm so delighted 
I 
don't know what to do, 
I 
feel so awful proud, boys, 
Now tell me, wouldn't you 1 
When married but a 
twelvemonth, 
Yes, to my heartfelt joy, 
Our union it was blest 
With a 
bouncing little boy. 
SPOKEL—I 
was delighted at hearing one day—, 
C 
Dada! ( Mamma) come see! 
Well, I 
declare! 
Baby's got a 
tooth! did you ever I 
Well, there ! tralla! 
I'll strike you! 
Pray share my joy, 
What is more delightful 
Than a 
first tooth in one's boy 
Yes, I 
was sitting smoking ( sewing), 
Was reading " Tweed " had gone; 
Wonder'd if he'd meet Genet, 
If Connor felt forlorn ; 
W 
hen to my great surprise a 
shout 
Rang shrilly in my ear, 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, dada! (mamma) 
Come kiss the little dear. 
SPOKEN .—Who could resist it I Kiss it I Of course I 
did, 
over and over again! 
Nurse says its the picture of its dada 
(1) 
BABY'S GOT A TOOTH.—Concluded. 
(mamma), of course it is! 
Well, it's no use talking; all I 
can 
think of is— 
Dada (mamma), come, etc. 
Now maybe you will not believe 
How happy I 
did feel ; 
That day I (dear) lost some thousands, 
But then I 
didn't squeal; 
My mind was occupied that day 
With only one idea, 
'Twas baby's got a 
tooth—oh ! joy 1 
The precious little dear! 
SPOKEN.—Ie 
S 
true I 
had to walk the floor with it half the 
night, and heat the paragorie over the gas, and nearly froze; 
but then imagine a 
father's ( mother's) joy as he ( she) thought 
of— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc. 
I'd let it bite my finger, 
And then ' twould chew my thumb; 
It seemed to please it really, 
With joy I 
was quite dumb. 
The day ' twas born I 
felt so glad— 
'Twas nothing unto this ! 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, I 
know, 
Excuse a 
father's ( mother's) bliss. 
SPOKEN. — Why, really I 
had to avoid all my intimate acquain-
tances that day, for I 
felt so happy that I'd have given my 
last cent away I 
actually believe. 
Why, Araminta Flapjack 
canes in with tears in her eyes and said, ' Have you heard the 
news 3'. 
I 
said, " Why of course ! 
our baby's got a 
tooth." 
"ul ! no," site cried, with an additional burst of grief; " my 
mother is dead !" 
Well, then, you can imagine my ecstasy, 
when I 
could not see her grief without being told. 
I 
said, 
" 
My dear, I 
sympathise with your grief, but I'm so overjoyed, 
for this morning dada ( mamma) said "— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc.

Composed by T. H . 
SEDDON. 
Sung by G. H. 
M ACDERMOTT. 
THERE' S 
a language in the eyes which has 
For lovers wond routs powers, 
And poets say there's language in 
The stars and in the flow'rs; 
But there's another language too, 
Which all can understand ; 
And its words of friendship, trust, and love, 
Are told in the " grip of the hand!" 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
grip of your hand, my friend, 
Give we a 
grip of your hand; 
As one man to another, 
As a 
friend, and as a 
brother, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand, 
l'd say to him who bravely works, 
Despising praise or blame; 
And strives by earnest, honest means 
To win his way to fame ; 
To patriots, and to statesmen too, 
Who work for their native land, 
And not for pension nor for place, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to the poor and humble man, 
Who earns his daily bread, 
Who loves his home and strives to keep 
His wife and children fed, 
Who learns in self-denial's school, 
Temptation to withstand, 
And like a 
man his dnty does, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to every honest heart, 
To each good man and true; 
I'd say to every Yankee tar, 
To every life- boa t's crew ; 
To the sorlier—to the doctor, who 
By a poor man's bed will stand, 
Witilont reward, his pain to soothe, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand! 
Then give me a 
grip, etc.

OF 
all the troublesome creatures 
That cling to a 
married man's life, 
There is none with such terrible featurea 
As the " Ma" of your own little wife. 
Her head is filled with suggestions 
For the good of connubial bliss, 
She'll kill you outright with her questions, 
Take my advice just in this, 
ClIORIIS. 
Don't marry your mother-in-law, 
Keep out of the reach of her paw, 
You had better be dead 
With a 
slab at your head, 
Than to marry your mother-in-law! 
Should your home e'er seem lonely and dreary, 
Your wife will then send for her sure, 
" 
It's so nice for Ma to come, Charley," 
Says your darling ; you must it endure. 
And if your dear wife prove deficient 
In matters known to womankind, 
Her mother will post her in all things, 
And drive you well out of your mind. 
Don't marry, etc. 
She'll keep you all day in hot water, 
And worry you almost to death, 
Till you wish in your heart that her daughter 
And herself had never drawn breath ! 
She'll make your much hoped for Elysium 
A 
desert of unending strife, 
So keep these few words in your vision, 
When you take to yourself a 
young wife. 
Don't marry, etc.

DARLING ISABEL. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by " Les Grotesques 
Eccentrique," HALEY and W EST. 
I'm always happy, gay and free, 
My heart's as light as air ; 
It's brimming o'er with joy and love 
For a 
maiden fair, 
With flashing eyes and teeth like pearl, 
And lips of rosy hue. 
She is, compared with other girls, 
A diamond, tried and true ; 
I 
love her, and l've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I 
will not ; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel. 
CHORUS. 
My darling Isabel, 
The one I 
love so well, (Sym.) 
The fairest flower that ever grew 
In a 
shady dell 
For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I 
go my love to see, 
Down by the little rnstie gate, 
She's waiting there for me ; 
I 
take her arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
Beneath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and I 
do stray. 
I 
love lier, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I 
will not ; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel.

WILL A MONKEY CLIMB A TREE ? 
Written and composed by Jomi REED, and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
W HILST walking out the other night a 
gift I 
chanced to meet, 
A 
very simple looking lass, as I 
thought, in the street; 
She had a 
lovely head of hair, a 
dark and rolling eye ; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd walk with me, and this was her reply— 
cnonns. 
Will a 
monkey climb a 
tree 1 
will a 
fish swim in the sea 7 
Will a 
lawyer take his tee 7 
a 
Jew his money lose 7 
Will a 
hackman take his fare ? will a 
barber cut your hair 1 
If they say no, then, dear sir, you I 
will refuse. 
I 
thought her very witty, so 1 
to her did say, 
" 
Will you go to a 
music hall to pass an hour away ' 
Now, miss, what do you say to this 7 
your answer, yes or no 1 
Just tell me what you really think, and if you'd like to go.' 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
accompany you?" she said; " why "— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
I 
hired a 
hack, drove to the ball, and paid the man his fare, 
And when we got inside the bull saw the chairman in his chair. 
I 
shook him by the hand and said, " What, will you have with 
me— 
Whiskey hot or brandy cold or a 
glass of soda and B.7" 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
take a 
glass of brandy and water, did you 
saw 7 Oh 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
A 
waiter then he brought the drinks, which came to a 
dollar 
and four, 
The same time saving. " Sir, ‘vill you require any more 7" 
I 
gave hin a 
ten dollar piece, he looked at me so stranae ; 
then said to the waiter, " Will you accept the change 7" 
SPOKEN.—He 
first looked at the aoll piece and then at me, 
and quickly putting the coin in his pocket, exclaimed— 
Will a 
monkey, etc,

You 
1'rica 10 c.:nts. 
BEcAusn I 
am a 
countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty ; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh 1" I 
-near them shout, 
While they take long looks at me. 
SPOKEN. — I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. 
I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
I 
say, " Dein it, what does it mean 1" and echo answers, " Dew 
it, what does it mean 1:" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
asked a 
man up at the Grand Central D?not if he knew where I 
could engat. 
a 
nice furnished room. -• 0:),” says he " you're 
after furnished room.:=,eli l Well, sir, y-u're in the wrong 
nei2hborhood ; you don't belong here, 
Well, sir, I 
suppose 
you'll keep correct by following your nose !" 
I 
told him he 
was very impertinent. Bat as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
rtiont s. 
Young fel!ah, you're too fresh, 
Young feliah, you're too fresh ; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch mid pocketbook, 
Thom-di to prove it he defied me; 
I 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And begged his best advice ; 
" 
My friend," said he, " you're very fresh ; 
Why, you've just come off the ice." 
YOUNG FELLAH, YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.-4 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
man 
of law. 
I 
told him he must certainly be m:staken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir; you have been on the 
ice of innocence; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
He wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him ; and as I 
came down stairs I 
heard him 
Young fellah, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony ; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me ; 
" 
Why," says she, " you must be loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, I'm quite sane; 
You know I 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SPOKEN.— She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't! please don't! 
I 
want to go home I 
please don't!" 
Nay, home thou shalt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou wilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jingo! yes, the cause I'll know 
Speak out! Oh, fairest creature speak I 
Tell me what secret hate thou bast! 
The tale I 
hear may make me weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But 
must know ! yes, I 
must know, 
Wherefore thou slightest toe." 
began to (let excited, so she thourdit she had better explain

WE'rtr a gallant brigade from Erin's isle, 
And many a 
fight we've won ; 
We'll dance a 
step or take a 
smile, 
And our comrades never shun ; 
When dress'd in regimentals, 
Sure of none we are afraid ! 
And we are known where'er we go 
As men of the gallant brigade. 
CHORUS. 
The gallant brigade is never afraid 
To meet a 
friend or foe ; 
We're sure to make a 
grand hurrah, 
Wherever we may go 
With trumpet and gun we march away 
In a 
beautiful parade, 
And we're so proud we charm the crowd 
To cheer for the gallant brigade. 
We're first in the field, all brave and true, 
If war should call us out ; 
And when we're home we pass our time 
In showing the girls about; 
I've often heard them sigh and wish 
That they could be arrayed 
In uniforms of blue and green 
Like those of the gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, etc. 
On the Fourth of July and Patrick's Day 
We're out in glorious style, 
While the stars and stripes and Ireland's flag 
Above us wave the while ; 
The glories of this nation then 
In fancy are displayed, 
And at night we drink a 
parting glass 
To America's gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, etc.

I'VE sung about dot Schweitzer kase,

" 
Oh, Jakey, I

Oh, don't I

Den so happy we will be, mit de kinder round our knee, 
We'll be happy all my life.

Und almost broke my jaw,

Dot angel I

For I

"FOOLS AND THEIR 
MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED ." 
Written and ecmpused by G. W. HuNT. 
Sur.g by G. 111. MACDEVMOTT. 
You'LL excuse my appearing in this shabby lot, 
But the garments I 
wear are the best I 
have got ; 
They once were the fashion, as smart as e'er worn, 
.LVou, fit for a 
scarecrow, all tattered and torn ; 
Just three years ago I 
came in for some cash, 
Like others before we—" went in " for " the dash I" 
I 
lived like a 
lord, the lot soon did spend, 
A 
short tho' a 
merry time— this is the end. 
C1101:U;4, 
Ah ! once I 
had cash, t;,-04 I 
was rash— 
Cut such a 
dash— soon went to smash ; 
.Now you may see I'm all up a 
tree, 
Yes, fools and their money's soon parted. 
I 
then used to toddle to ball- room or rout, 
If I 
now showed my nose they'd no doubt turn me out, 
And those I've befriended in sunshiny day, 
.Now give me the cut, or pass over the way ; 
This hat I 
have doffed to many a 
fair maid, 
.You, the brim wouldn't stand it, of the roof I'm afraid, 
And these gloves, ahem ! Dent's best, once fit for a (ion, 
Now there's no kid about cm, I 
can scarce heel) ' ern on. 
Yes. once I 
had, etc. 
I'd a 
gold- headed cane which I'd—aw—flourish about, 
But it's some time [ter() since that went—up the spout ; 
An eye- glass which an air of importance would lend, 
Long ago I—for safety left that with a 
friend ! 
59 
" FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY 'S SOON 
PARTED."—Concluded. 
In a 
hansom I'd then travel thro' many a 
s,reet, 
_You, I 
tramp it not handsome about my poor feet ; 
These boots once such a 
fit, of the best patent leather, 
They scarce now can body and sole keep together. 
Ali, once I 
had, etc. 
This sleeve still for me possesses a 
charm, 
When I 
think of the darlings I've had on my arm ; 
Yes, this coat it could tell a 
good tale I 
believe, 
But one tail I 
find's given notice to leave; 
The wind thro' my Sydenhams often will steal, 
And nothing but holes in their pockets I 
feel ; 
They've clung to me well, so I'll still hold them dear, 
Tho' to- day I 
discovered a 
rent—in the rear ! 
Alt, once I 
had, etc. 
And as for the garment I 
wear next my skin, 
To be severity with that, after years would be sin ; 
I 
could once " sport my linen " so spotlessly white, 
But PM I 
am thinking it's best out of sight ! 
So, boys, should some cash ever come in your way, 
Stich to it in case of the rainy day ; 
Take care of yearself and don't be too free, 
Or some morning you'll find yourself right up a 
tree. 
cnor.us. 
When you have cash never be rash, 
Don't cut a 
dash, or you'll go to smash; 
Then, just like me, you'll be all up a

Beware the first approaches of this stealthy fo .
e, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health GranuleN. A person sliou d never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch-fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Mer.in's Health 
Granules. Why ? 
Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate , and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Yoars it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules. for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT AILS NE!" 
How often do we hear this remark. A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exerlicise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doc..)rs may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells its that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished front the system, by using Merlin's 
Health Granules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits v 'licit, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels— lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout. 
WAKEFULNESS AND SOMNAMBULISM , 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
of these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No ! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep- walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the • 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules.

By judiciously using the never-

"COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not, reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular 7 " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-tiOte by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head ; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine ; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
