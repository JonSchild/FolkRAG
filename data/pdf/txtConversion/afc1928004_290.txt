CHEESE." 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875. by Wm. 
CARTER, in the °Mee of the Librarian of Congress, at Washi: gton 
Written by GEO. COES for, and originally sung with great 
success by, ruzot CARTER. 
Beans. beans! Boston baked beans! 
Served up for breakfast on Sunday morn, 
With codfish balls, brown bread, coffee and cream— 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
Queen—sure your born. 
Whenever you go to Boston town, 
Get somebody to show you round; 
For fifteen cents you can get your fill 
At Beverly's, for they grow there still, 
Smoking hot upon the plates, I 
dearly love those 
Yankee dates. 
Oh give me beans, beans, etc., (repeat first four lines.) 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash! 
/n a 
second class hotel you never miss hash; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash! 
Its a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch; 
travel'd this country through and through, 
This famous conundrum is always pew. 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs or crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
Reed birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds staff'd is all very nice— 
Oh but give me hash, etc., (repeat first four lines.) 
SPOKEN. — We'll change the subject, and spring from 
love to Spring. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese ! 
Oh sweet is the perfume that waft3 on the breeze, 
In Grobe's Saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel in lager and Limburger cheese. 
Of all the cheese that e'er was made, 
Limburger throws them all way in the shade, 
Nothing will make your skin so neat— 
Nothing will make you feel so sweet; 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the Balm of a 'I 
housand Flowers— 
CHORUS. 
Oh! but give me the cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Oh sweet is the perfume that wafts on the breeze, 
In Grobe's Saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel in lager and Limburger cheese!

I'm Clothes Pin George, dat plays de bones, 
And makes de banjo ring; 
De gals all say I'm too sweet to live, 
When I 
begin to sing. 
I 
fell in love with a 
yaller gal, 
A 
lleerch4um colored belle 
She was niper coon in the fish-ball room 
Of a 
Coffee and Cake IIe!-el 
I 
met her first, at a 
fancy ball, 
In South Fifth A.V011113 ; 
When I 
got there my charmer fair, 
Was won' ying down a 
stew ; 
She had fonr plates of codfish balls, 
For which 
said I'd pay; • 
Said she, " Get out you black and tan, 
You'll give the snap away." 
' 
I 
asked her if she'd fly with me, . 
To some secluded spot? 
She said it :wrIsn't .fly time, 
Ana she guessed 
16.1114 not. 
We agreed to wait ' till the summer time, 
When the leans and peas were ripe--
rut she coked to death with a 
Russian towel 
She ate foi- r

Of all de drinks dat's in de world 
Dey say water is de best ; 
You can drink a 
river full of it, ) 
And go to bed and rest. 
You'll never git de nightmare, 
Or drop down to a 
Fum; 
But a 
nigger's jaw is never sore 
From drinking Rum and Gum! 
CH0E118. 
Oh! Rum and Gum! 
Sweet Rum and Gum! 
Mil it up wid 'lasses, put it in a 
cup, 
Call in all. de wenches and see dem drink it up. 
Adam was de first man, 
He was fond of apples raw; 
If he'd tasted rum and gum, 
He'd hollored out for more; 
He got drunk in de garden, 
Eve she took some, 
And when she ax'd to go home, 
He'd holler rum and gum!

Music by BILLY CarrEri. t. 
There's a 
rooster that stops in this village, 
And sheps on the floor of saloons; 
He lives on bird seeds and crackers, 
His business is juggling sp:ttoons ; 
He's known by every barkeeper 
As a 
Bum— he's worse than them all— 
They sweep him out with the rest of the garbage, 
The bloak with the terrible gaul. 
7 
CHORUS. 
Oh! they say he's a 
horribla snoozer! 
Oh! a 
bruiser, what a 
hoosier ! 
When he borrows your coat you're the loser; 
This ham with the terrible gaul. 
He's got one eye in his head like a 
mackerel, 
His neck is as long as a 
crane ; 
He drinks gruel that's made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a 
seven day's rain, 
His clothes wouldn't cover a 
hair pin— 
Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball, 
You can bet that he never would tumble, 
The Moak with the terrible gaul! 
Oh, they say. &O. 
His relations are all in the poor house, 
As many as a 
large circus troupe ; 
They live on the wind of a 
bellows 
Made into pulverized soup. 
You could set them adrift in the ocean, 
On an iceberg, a 
shaving or yawl, 
You can bet that he'd catch a 
sucker,' 
The bloak with the terrible gaul! 
Oh, they say, &AL,

The eirms was in town to- day, 
I 
went to see the show. sir ; 
yes, I 
went into a 
tent, 
But it was not for Joe, sir; 
There was animiles great and small, 
Boiling up with rage, sir, 
And a 
feller with a 
barber's pole, 
Stirring them in the cage, sir. 
CHORUS. 
If this ain't true, I 
hope may die, 
I 
want you all to know, sir, 
You can lose your hair and both your eyes, 
At a 
country circus show, sir. 
There was grizzly bears from mountain tops, 
Buffalos trona prairies, 
Kangaroos and crocodiles, 
And lots of Irish fairies. 
They had a 
light into the tent, 
About a 
lot of hash, 
Onion skins and cabbage stalks, 
Broke out with scarlet rash. 
If this ain't true, &c.

The elephant sat on his trunk 
Winking at the foxes, 
Kangaroo sat on his tail 
Eating drygoods boxes. 
The lion he commenced to roar 
Like a 
busted Concertina, 
Slam'd the tiger on the floor, 
And. eat up the hyena. 
If this ain't true, &c. 
The leopard he began to scratch 
The weazel in the eye, sir ; 
The camel he got up his hump, 
And swallow'd up a 
fly, sir; 
The crocodile begin to grunt, 
The bear begin to shake her ; 
The buffalo he made a 
jump 
And swallow'd the alligator, * 
If this ain't true, &c. 
The gorilla told the monk he lied, 
Parrots begin to stutter ; 
Seven waggon loads of feather bags 
Dump'd into the gutter. 
You ought to see this nigger git, 
Fall on his proboscis, 
Kick'd and fit and scratch'd and bit, 
With the female rhylioroscis. 
If this ain't true, & c._

AIR.—" The Afternoon Crawl." 
" 
MY features they are quite familiar, 
All the ladies know me well ; 
On Broadway I 
am the rage, 
I 
smile on every passing belle.' 
Every day, when it is sunny, 
On the corners I 
am seen ; 
The envy of the little boys, 
While on my little cane I 
lean! 
SPOIIEN.—`• Yes, you see, my parents are wealthy, and I 
have lots of time on my hands. 
So, to make myself useful, 
I 
hold up lamp-posts and door-ways. 
Then I 
help the 
members of the Broadway Squad' to do nothing. 
Then 
I 
wink at the pretti, girls to keep up my reputation as a 
Masher.' 
For do you see— 
CHORUS. 
" 
I'm one of the Gang! I'm one of the Gang! 
Oh, that's what they call us in elegant slang! 
I'm one of the Gang! I'm one of the Gang! 
The fellows all know me,—I'm one of the gang! 
" 
My style is so gay and so nobby, 
And I 
drink the best of wine ; 
Sometimes, with a 
dashing team, 
You see me cutting up a 
shine. 
When the 
Matinee's' are over, 
At the doors I'm dressed to kill ; 
I 
don't care how I 
scatter cash,— 
The Governor' he foots the bill! 
SPOY.F.N.—` You know I'm a 
lily of the valley, 
I 
toll 
not, neither do I 
spin!' 
The other day I 
was on Broadway 
' 
charming,' when what do you think ? A policeman mins— 
took me for somebody else, and told me to ' move 
Move on,' said I, 
guess not! Don't you see— 
" 
Em one of the Gang! 
" 
So, for an ornament I 
linger 
On the corners, night and day; 
Smoking, winking at the girls, 
I 
pass the jolly time away! 
If you wish to take life easy, 
All 
serene,' and have no fuss, 
• 
I'll introduce you to my pals, 
And you can they be one of us. 
SPOSEN.—" Yes, and in a 
short time you will wear 
pane of 
of glass in your shirt front, and copper on the ace,' 
and ' play the jack to win,' and in fact, 
be a 
first-class 
sport!' 
Look at me! You see how it's done— 
"I'm one of the Gang !"

UP TO THE MARK! 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. Z 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Music by Wm. CARTER. 
'Tis well to be up to the mark, my boys, 
Just think of the days gone by, 
When Washington planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on high; 
When Jefferson stood by the land of the free! 
And Lafayette, too, he fought in the field, 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
CHORUS. 
For those men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They brought sweet sunlight from the dark, 
And made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark. 
And they'll find the North pole before long, my boys, 
Or travel that Northern sea through, 
Or die at their post like brave hail, my boys, 
'Neath the icebergs of cold 82 ; 
We Yankees, ' tis said, through this world, my boys, 
Do know not the meaning of defeat, or fail; 
Our banner will soon be unfurrd, my boys, 
The future will tell of the tale. 
Cuonirs. 
We've men left like Morton and Hayes, my boy, 
One failure but kindles the spark, 
And brings to the surface them all, my boys, 
Those men that are up to the mark.

Music by W M. CARTER, 
There's Castle Garden, down below, 
It don't amount to much; 
Ev'ry day a 
ship from the sea 
Dumps a 
load of' Dutch. 
Bismark rules in Germany, 
The home of lager bier— 
Walk Avenue A, you'll surely say, 
That Germany's over here. 
There's Italian's down in Crosby street, 
Some fat, and others bony; 
Bader, de man, no likes de harm, 
Eater de maccoroni. 
Baldy Sours took a 
drop 
From the top of the City Hall, 
From the shoulder so fine 
He knock'd the clock out of time ! 
Don't you think he'd a 
terrible gaul? 
In mountain streams you will catch trout-
Buy your bait at Tuckers. 
Boston for beans, New York for sardines, 
.And in bar-rooms you find the sucker. 
Whenever you strike a 
boarding-house 
Where the hash is heavy as lead, 
Tread water quick, make a 
stiff kick, 
Swim out! You're over your head! 
In a 
grocery store, of a 
summer's day, 
A 
snoozer was spending his time: 
He choked with a 
moon, 
Swept himself up with a 
broom— 
And still you wonder at crime. 
If you never want to feed yourself, 
Start out and play base ball. 
You look like a 
sick cat, 
Stoning the bail a tho bat, 
For you won't have any feeders at all. 
A 
coon on-South, Fifth Avenue 
Stole a 
E3 et ot tpoons, 
lie played 3-11-33, in a 
straight, 
Combination gin saddle. 
He's, 
now passnG his sleepless nights 
Of misery, iu the tombs. 
When yon go see your girl 
On Wednesday night, 
And her father thinks .you're a 
gul, 
Have your pantaloons stout, 
Or you'll get fired out 
On the end of her father's old boot. 
Mary had a 
little kitten 
She christen'd it P-a-t, 
But when it grew up, 
She found out her mistake, 
It wasn't that kind of a 
cat. 
I 
got drunk the other night, 
And put a 
head on a 
police', 
I'm sorry to hear the death of greenbacks, 
For you'll get cockeyed carrying specie. 
If your wife at home has too much tongue, 
And annoys you with her jaw, 
Swap her off for a 
poodle dog, 
And throw in your mother-in-law. 
If I 
sing any more, you'll show me a 
cork, 
'Twill take away my breath ; 
I'd rather eat a 
snake, or set up at a 
wake, 
Than talk you folks to death.

Darling, linger at my side, 
While the ru-nnents by us glide ; 
Time and care have marked your brow, 
But you -re dearer to me now ; 
Lay your hand within my own, 
We, to-,ether old have grown ; 
Brighter far than gems untold, 
Silver hair that once was gold.

Down the hill of life we go, 
Love but gleams with brighter glow ; 
Sweeter far than gems untold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
Beaming eyes that gaze in mine, 
Ah ! how fondly now they shine! 
Roses of the heart remain, 
Though they fale on hill and plain! 
Loving ones cannot forget 
Happy days when fir:t they met ; 
Fondly now each tress of gold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
Down the hill, (to 
Life together we will share, 
Every joy and every care ; 
'Till we slumber side by side, 
In the church-yard drear and wide I

Once again your lips I

Silver hair that once vas gold.

I 
once did love a 
girl named Sal, 
Each day I 
went to court her, 
She's a 
farmer's daughter on the hill, 
And I 
tell you she's a 
snorler ; 
Last Sunday noon, alone with her, 
My love with her revealing, 
The question I 
was going to pop, 
When the pigs set up ft squealinz. 
CI:tours. 
Yes, the pigs did squeal, and dance a 
red 
And the old tom turkey gobbled ; 
And the shanghai crowil bis cockadoodleaoo, 
And the brindle cow was sueezin. 
I 
went again list Sunday night. 
And the pigs had stopped their squealing ; 
The old tom turkey, and the big shanghai, 
And tho brindle cow, were sleeping ; 
Will you be mine, dear Sal? says I, 
Before her I 
was kneeling ; 
But before she'd time to say yes, or no, 
The pigs again went squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, S:c. 
I 
called on Sal again, next day, 
To ask how she was feeling; 
I 
found her feeding the little pigs 
To make them stop their squealing ; 
The plan is a 
good one, Sal, said I, 
As a 
kiss I 
was a 
stealing ; 
The pigs stopp'd eating and looked at me, 
And again set up a, squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, 1.z-c. 
I 
l'At disgusted, and left the spot, 
And resolved I'd never marry 
A 
fa.m.:T's daughter for a 
wife ; 
But a 
batchclor I 
would tarry. 
So 13t her pigs squeal if they choose— 
The truth I 
am revealing, 
Each night anl day when I 
pass that way, 
The damned old pigs. are squealing!

The Animals' Fair; or, Carter's Dream, 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Just listen to my lay, 
I 
know it's going to please you : 
The song I'm going to sing, 
Is just the *de to suit you. 
I 
had a 
dream and it did seem 
To be most awful queer; 
For the Birds and Beasts they had:a Fair, 
And I 
was overseer. 
It was the Animals' Fair, 
The Birds and Beasts were there; 
The gay baboon by the light of the moon 
lie combed his Auburn Lair, 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Fell down on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed, 
Fell on his knees, 
And Low was that for file monk. 
The jay-bird played the flute, 
The musk-rat played the fiddle; 
The tiger- cat and the mouse 
Danced up and down the middle. 
The elephant hugged the bull dog's necks. 
And the bear got up his dander; 
The canicl smashed the fox in the eyes;:i. 
And bit off the ear of the gander. 
The bear he wanted a 
drink, 
The crocodile he (Id wink, 
They toss d 
a 
cent,

WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Good evening, folk ,, 
I'm glad to sea you all 
But please don't think me rndE., 
But let me say like, famed Paul Pry 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
I 
just drooped in by accident, 
Like all the other nights 
To tell you all I 
know and think, 
About the woman's rights. 
B )me women want to Le Prc,siden'l 
Others Secretary of th..?, State, 
But they all w-int to grab at the treasury 
That's a 
chance I'd like to take. 
They want to hold the Post Office 
The raason I'll unfurl, 
The want to catch those fellows writing notes 
To all the other girls. 
Nov I 
go in for Woman's Rights, 
And what I 
say is true, 
I'd like the women to act like men 
And the men as women do. 
For I 
think to give the women their rights 
Would give us no distress, 
For the women then could do all the work 
And the men wear all the fine dress. 
The women scandalize the men, 
And make such a 
fins about them. 
But I'd like the women to tell me 
What they could do without them, 
Although the men will run around, 
Drink Lager and carouse, 
The women find them mighty handy things 
To have about the house.

I 
thank you for this encore 
And here I 
am in corps, 
Then let me try my bPstest 
To please you all once more, 
Then pray lend your attention 
And listen to this " stew," 
A 
new conglomeration 
I've just mixed up for you. 
The girl I 
left behind me, 
Was the dark girl drsssed in blue, 
She had a 
charm I 
can't express, 
Hip, up dee d.)o den doo. 
She had the ring her mother wore, 
Her name is Maggie May, 
We parted by the river side— 
She, I 
and old dog Tray. 
Dear mother I 
remember well, 
The days when I 
was young, 
I've often heeded your advice, 
Of Billy, hold your tongue. 
But now, I'm ola ;Jul growing weak, 
And dead is Cora Lee, 
Oh give me back those happy days, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
little bird, 
flow would that be for high; 
I 
could fly to my lady's arms, 
And kiss her on the sly. 
But hark! I 
hear an angel sing, 
Way up in a 
balloon, 
Twinkling are shining love 
A 
sailing round the moon. 
rd offer thee this hand of mine, 
As you know man broposes, 
Come chare my little hut with me, 
And love among the roses. 
I 
would I 
were a 
boy again, 
With Maggie by my side, 
I 
am a 
wretched bachelor, 
Say who will be my bride. 
There is an end to everything, 
Then I 
must end my song, 
And hope that you will not think 
That I've made it too long. 
My mind it is just h 
If made up, 
To settle down in Me, 
And end my sweet existence with 
A 
stage carpenter's wife.

CHEESE IT, 
AIR—KniekerlAocker Line. 
• 
THE other afternoon, as I 
walked the streets along, 
I 
thought I 
saw a 
new atm noble subject for a 
song--
Two newsboys had a 
little row, a 
policeman near them gees it, 
He steps between, and says, young coves, I 
guess you'd better 
cheese it. 
I 
soon got tired walking and dropped my fine segar, 
Took a 
seat beside a 
nice young gal in a 
city railroad car, 
Her little hand lay close to mine, I 
gently tried to squeeze it, 
She says you're mistaken in the gal, I 
guess you'd better cheese 
It. 
The other night I 
told my wife, that I 
was L,oing to the lodge, 
And took a 
walk wan another girl, just for a 
little dodge; 
My wife she followed close behind, and my poor hair how she 
did seize it, 
SPOKEN.—And she says, " Young miss, IT you want that Pe-
ruvian waterfall of yours saved, you'd better skip: and as for 
you  
When I 
get you hon-

I 
went home with her without t 
word, undressed, and went to, 
bed. 
My wife she took the poker up, and beat a 
tattoo on my head, 
It felt so sore I 
had to get a 
pint of oil to grease it. 
And she thinks if it gets well again, ril have sense enough to 
cheese it.

time, and I 
suppose you all do know 
That Noah had upon his arz a 
most tremendous show, 
He'd the elephant with great big trunk, a 
Jennie and a 
Jack, 
And then there was the camel too, who soon got up his back. 
Now Noah's Ark was a 
gallant craft as ever was afloat, 
And the bills they said she was to sail at exactly three o'clock. 
I 
can't wait any longer, says the captain, so I 
can't, 
No matter if it's Butler or if it's Useless,U. S. Grant. 
But Butler thought he'd get aboard, by some means or an-
other, 
So he struck the plank, and made a 
rush, and Useless tried 
the other; 
They tugged away with might and main, to see who'd get on 
first, 
Old Noah cried, get off, you beats, I'm afraid the boiler ' 11 
burst. 
They jumped aboard, 'twas hard to tell who first got on the 
boat, 
But the steam was up,and soon this gallant craft was all afloat.

A 
storm arose, and Gram, an,i 3utler, both of them. tried co

There's plenty that will fight to save Columbia's brave old flag. 
THAT'S THE CHEESE, 
By E. D. GO3DI. 
GOOD-EVENING white folks all, how d'ye do, 
I've concluded to make you a 
call, with de banjo, 
If I 
succeed in pleasing you, 
And I 
my best will try, 
I 
hope you'll say when I 
am through, 
That's the cheese. 
In the war between Prussia and France—ober dart 
King William made Louis Nap. dance—also swear, 
They didn't fight about Sweitzer cheese, 
Nor yet was it lager beer, 
But they quarrelled about the Rhine, 
.2Vot the chte,sr. 
Now a 
liberty I 
will take, if you please. 
With the people way out at Salt Lake, they're 4

fuss, 
And Brig then ttied to stop it, 
But they all pitched in and walloped poor Brig. 
Bully for them. 
Another verse, then I 
will quit—for to-night, 
And the colored folks next I 
will hit, alut I

And Fred Douglass is the man, 
But that is not the sent-i-ment, 
Not much, Mary Ann. 
BANJO SOLO. 
AIR.—Sam. Johnson. 
I'LL sing of a 
darkey that used to live here 
lie was s 
melodious sweet-scented coon, 
his hair it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
He was brigadier-chief in a 
barber saloon. 
Every morning to see him a 
handling the razor, 
Folks they'd gatber in irowds round the door, 
They all'd exelithn when he slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet- scented barber they'd ne'er seen before. 
There was a 
sweet-scented damsel named Sally Mog-Indi 
Provost-Marshal was she in a 
ki!chen close by, 
And she'd pass by the shop as she went to the mark...... 
And in at the barber she'd throw a 
sheep's eye. 
And the barber he'd wait until she'd rk.itun, 
And then to the door he quickly woeld rua, 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip in her basket., 
Then drink to her health in a 
pint of Bay Pun?. 
A 
little Dutch butcher his name was Hans Schmid, 
He heard of the barber so jealous he grew, 
He loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
Then straight for this sweet-scented barber he flew, 
The battle commenced—the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent at each other did rush, 
But the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
For he blew out his brains with a 
lathering brush. 
The Man with a 
Cream-Colored Horse, 
Banjo Solo. 
IF you'll listen to me a 
sad tale I 
tell, 
how blight and misfortune my poor heart befell, 
I 
loved a 
young damsel and loved her full well, 
And to marry we both were inclined; 
For the girl I 
adored she was handsome, 
And sadly I 
grieve for my loss, 
But all my fond hopes have been blighted 
By a 
man on a 
cream- colored horse.

He rode around the ring with the greatest of ease, 
He stood on his head while his toes he would seize, 
lie that through the hoops like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Did this man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one night, 
When she put me in a 
most terrible plight. 
She applauded so loud they all thought she was tight, 
And of course most jealous I 
grew. 
Says I, Liza Jane, do be quiet; said she, sir, you're not my 
boss, 
And she called for three cents worth of peanuts, 
For the man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
He rode around, dm. 
And when we went home, we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
When she said, sir, be off, I've done with you now, 
I'm engaged to the star of the ring. 
I'm to be the Senora Spoonnetta, 
And I'll travel with him of course, 
I'll throw a 
flip- flap from his eye- brow, 
And I'll light on his cream- colored horse. 
He rode around, &e.

Oh Father, dear Father, pedestrianize with me to our domicile, 
The clock in the belfry of the neighboring court-house has just

You emphatically promised, my aged parent, to return at once

As soon as you had earned the regular sustenance required to 
sustain the family gang assembled here. 
The fire disappeared just after you did, and kerosene oil is all

And the old dame has been anxious since she dialled Whit

And that little snu3zer Benjamin has been squealing for more

And there's no one to render any assistance hut my royal nibs.

The artists too laughed at his puns o'ex and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills,

And scores of new friends he shook by the hand,

For his manipulations of banjo and song, 
Then resolving to be in Cle profession a

THE MOON IS OUT TO-NIGHT. 
THE moon is out to night, love, 
The sky is bright and clear. 
My heart beats with delight, love, 
In hopes to meet you here; 
For we shall then meander, 
happy through the grove, 
And while the moonbeams linger, 
We'll softly whisper love; 
There, my little sweetheart, 
I 
will something say, 
That will prove I 
love you 
More and more each day; 
Then, I 
know you'll kiss me, 
Pretty Ida "Vane, 
Just one little kiss, love, 
Until we meet again. 
CHORUS. 
The moon is out to- night, love, 
And all the land is bright, 
come and take a 
ramble 
In its silver light; 
Give me one sweet kiss, love, 
Just one kiss to keep, 
Then I 
will dream you came, lore, 
And kissed me in my sleep. 
Oh come, my little dew drop, 
My pretty primrose fair, 
My little bunch of roses, 
My gem or jewel rare; 
There's nothing I 
could name, love. 
That's half so fair as thee, 
And there is naught in life, love. 
That's half so dear to me; 
So do not keep me waiting— 
Hoping all in vain, 
Oh! come and smile upon me, 
My pretty Ida Vane; 
Oh! grant this one request love, 
'Twill give my heart delight, 
And you need only stay, love, 
To kiss and bid good-night.

WE MET BY CHANCE. 
Annie published by num, POND S
.; Co., 547 Broadway, NOW York.: 
When ev'ning brings the twilight hour, 
I 
pass a 
lonely spot, 
Where oft she comes to cull the flower, 
We call " Forget me' not." 
She never whispers so, nor stay, 
She never whispers go, nor stay, 
We meet by chance,—the usual way, 
We meet by chance,—the usual way, 
We meet by chance, 
We meet by chance, 
We meet by chance,—the usual way., 
Once, how, I 
cannot well divine, 
'Unless by chance, we kisst ; 
I 
found her lips were close to mine, 
So I 
could not resist ; 
As neither whispered yea nor nay, 
As neither whispered yea nor nay, 
They met by chance,—the usual way, 
They met by chance —the usual way. 
They met by chance, 
They met by chance, 
They met by chance,—the usual way. 
The roses, when the zephyrs woo, 
Impart what they receive— 
They sigh and sip the balmy dew, 
But never whisper give. 
Our love is mutual, this we know. 
Our love is mutual this we know, 
Though neither tells the other so, 
Though neither tells the other so, 
Our love is mutual this we know, 
Though neither tells the other so.

WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by FIRTH, POND & CO., 547 Broadway, New York 
I 
wandered by the brook-side, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy wheel was still. 
There was no sonw of grasshopper, 
No chirp of' any bird--
1,nd the beating of' my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer, 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Ile came not, no, he came not! 
The moon came out alone ; 
The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, silent tears were failing, 
When something stool behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind ; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We could not spo,ak a 
word, 
And the Ivnting of own hearts 
Was all the sound we heard.

Neith indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from

reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor-

Her form was faultless, and her mbads 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart.

'Unfortunately there is enough of it done without an, further nealz 
sity of explaining 'how, w hen and

Is commonly called "flirting."

We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing\

It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objeo-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford i=ome iimocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to out 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

First Book for Mechanics, Machinists 8c Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most eweaest recommendation, 
an4 wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufaciarer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
4Che author of this work is well known as an extensive 
witer who has Emile some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
mariner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a woik 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves 80 familiar with its contents as to be able to rtfer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitions works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white piper. and bound in stiff cloth covers.
