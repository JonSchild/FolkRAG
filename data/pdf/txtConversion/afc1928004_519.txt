HOW THE BANJO WAS INVENTED. 
A DECITATION. 
By LAWELL and DREWS. 
OH, have you never heard ? 
How banjos were invented, 
It is the strangest story, 
But to me it was presented. 
Of the ' possum's tail I'm going to tell, 
And I 
want you all to listen, 
About de hair dat isn't dere, 
And why de hair is missin'. 
It's about old Noah and the ark, 
That I'm about to tell you, 
And about that Ham, his big black son, 
And about the snakes and 'possums. 
He had a 
butting billygoat, 
And a 
hundred head of cattle, 
He drove em 'board the ark as soon's 
He heard the thunder rattle. 
De ark she kep a 
sailin'. 
And a 
sailin', and a 
sailin' ; 
De lion got his dander up, 
And like to break de palm'. 
De sarpints hissed, de painters yelled, 
Till what .with all de fussin', 
You couldn't hardly hear de mate, 
A 
bossin' round and cussin'. 
Now Ham, de only nigger 
Dot was running on de packet, 
Got lonesome in de barber shop, 
And couldn't stand de racket. 
HOW THE BANJO WAS INVENTED.— 
Concluded. 
And so for to amuse bisself, 
He steamed some wood and bent it, 
And soon he had a 
banjo made, 
De fust dat was invented. 
He wet de leather, stretched it on, 
Made bridge, and screws and apron, 
And fitted in a 
proper neck, 
'Twos very long and taperin'. 
He took some tin and twisted him, 
A 
thimble for to ring it, 
And den de mighty question rose, 
How was he gwine to string it ? 
De possum had as fine a 
tail 
As de one dat is'e a 
singing ; 
De hairs so long, and thick and strong, 
Dey's fit for banjo stringing. 
Bat nigger shaved 'em off as close 
As wash day dinner graces, 
And sorted of ' em, by de size 
From little E's to basses. 
He strung her, tuned her, struck a 
jig, 
'Twos nebber mind de wedder ; 
They sound like forty leven bands, 
Playing all together. 
Some went to pattin', some to dancin', 
Noah called de figures, 
And this is how the banjo was 
- 
Invented by the niggers.

THE LAUGHING MAN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written and sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
I 
wILL tell you of a 
funny man, 
He's laughing all the day, 
He laughs at nothing, but he laughs 
At everything you say. 
He also laughs well in his sleep, 
He laughs to see the baby creep, 
I 
never in all my life did see 
A 
man who laughs so much as he. 
CHORUS. 
With his ha, ha, ha, lice, lice, bee, 
Ho, ho, ho, he laughs you see ; 
Ha, ha, ha, lice, hee, bee, 
I 
never saw a 
man laugh like he. 
(Repeat.) 
Oh, he's laughing in the morning, 
Through the day, and through the night, 
The people think him crazy, 
It's fun to see the sight. 
The other night I 
asked him 
To take a 
walk with me, 
The only answer that I 
got, 
Was, he, he, he, he, lice. 
With his ha, ha, ha, etc 
And when he heard the news from Maine, 
It nearly drove him wild, 
And when we told him how things stood, 
Loudly then he smiled. 
He rolled upon the floor and laughed, 
Till the tears ran down his cheeks, 
We picked him up, put him to bed, 
And now he never speaks. 
With his ha, ha, ha, etc

THE MEETING. 
Written and sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
On, down in yon silvery glen, 
Near the gentle running stream, 
Among those flowers blooming sweet, 
I 
wander there to dream. 
My darling loved one dwells within 
An ivy covered cottage near the brook ; 
Her voice is full of melody, 
Her eyes a 
tender look. 
CHORUS. 
She has promised for to meet me here, 
She has won my heart completely, 
We will play the banjo and guitar, 
And blend our voices sweetly. 
(
Repeat.) 
It's time that she was meeting me, 
She said she'd come at eight, 
And meet me underneath that tree, 
As the birds sing to their mate. 
My darling all proclaim so fair, 
A 
fragrant blooming flower, 
She has promised to wed me, I 
declare, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bower. 
She has promised, etc. 
CAROLINA CREAM. 
Written by L. C. DELAYS, and sung with great success by LA.WELL 
and DREWS, and entire company. 
D OWN by de old mill, 
Close by de stream, 
Dar lives a 
little yeller gal 
Named Carolina Cream ; 
She am de pootiest yeller gal, 
That ever you did see. 
We're going down to see her, 
She invited us to tea. 
CHORUS. 
Come along, boys, go down to de stream, 
We're going to have a 
jolly time wid Carolina Cream 
Come along, boys, de wagon waits below 
To see Angeraima Flop and Phcebiana Snow. 
We're going to have a

While de banjo and de fiddle. 
De music will be ringin' ; 
Hands all around, 
We'll dance away like steam, 
So come al9ng and go with us, 
To see Carolina Cream. 
Come along boys, etc. 
Dar'll be singing and dancing,

We're high-toned colored people, 
We always like to sing. 
Dar'll be a 
big reception, 
For we feel so very gay, 
De ladies say, we're getting sweet 
And sweeter every day. 
Come along boys, etc. 
TT-TR FLY MARKET DAME. 
A 
RECITATION. 
Recited with applause by LAWELL and DREWS. 
NEAR Fly Market lived a 
dame, 
She was ugly, squint and lame, 
She had money, and I 
had none, 
So to court her I 
begun. 
I 
went to see her one rainy night, 
And with the rain was drenched thro' quite ; 
But the cruel butcher he 
Cut in there, and cut out me. 
To gain this point, he gave a 
ball, 
And I 
was asked with the neighbors all ; 
I 
asked her hand, I 
do declare. 
But she gave me her foot, and I 
won't tell where. 
I 
went again my suit to press, 
And what I 
saw you'll never guess; 
When I 
got in there, I 
did see 
That she was frying sausages for he. 
Now one kiss before we part, 
For you have broke this faithful heart ; 
Scarcely these words I 
had said, 
When she up with the skillet and broke my head. 
Now all you who for love are sighing, 
Never go courting where sausages are frying, 
Lest like me you feel the weight 
Of the frying pan upon your pate.

THE KICKING HORSE PLY. 
Written by S. LAWELL. 
Sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
THERE'S a 
terrible story which I'm going to tell, 
And I 
want you to listen to me : 
A 
bullfrog, a 
lobster, and a 
horsefly, they fell 
In a 
mud hole, and sang tra la lee. 
The bullfrog got hungry and tackled the fly, 
The lobster got angry and started to cry, 
When a 
speckled old lien came along that way, 
And hearing the clatter said, " What d'ye say ? " 
Now when Mr. Horsefly saw speckled Miss Hen 
Talking in such a 
rude manner to them, 
He got on his ear and started to kick, 
When the lobster and bullfrog took very sick. 
The horsefly did kick at a 
terrible rate, 
He kicked out the frog which the old hen ate ; 
Oh, he kicked at the lobster with all his might, 
Then he kicked himself clear out of sight. 
The Spring had come, the flowers in 
The birds sung out Their lay; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May: 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day: 
And how I 
loved her ? neale •can 4114 
My little Maggie May, 
My little witching 31-aggie. 
Maggie sin' , 
ing all the day. 
Oh! how I 
love her 
none can 4
,411 
My little Maggie May. 
rnough years rolled on. yet still I 
lo,•e4 
With heart so light and gay, 
And haver will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, trez 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away: 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
Arid my little Maggie May.

I'vE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

I AM waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear I 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
'Where sunbeams on the ripples come and go ; 
Overhead the birds are singing in the trees, 
While their joyous carols echo through the dell ; 
Where the violets are smiling in the breeze, 
There our happy, happy tale of love we'll tell. 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood, Essie dear ! 
Beside the stream that murmurs sweet and low, 
In the nook we've known since childhood, Essie dear, 
Where oft we've met in happy days ago. 
Linger not, but haste to meet me, Essie dear ! 
Down where we've roamed in merry days " Lang sync." 
I 
am waiting here to greet thee, Essie dear, 
For I 
long to hear you whisper " Ever thine." 
Oh! I 
love you more than all the world beside, 
Ever true you've been in sorrow and in pain; 
You were the star my weary heart to guide, 
How I 
long to hear your winning voice again 
I 
am waiting in the wildwood, etc.

W E'RE not surprised to see you stare, 
Upon our neat array 
Of dandy colored gentlemen 
Employed upon Broadway. 
We never lose our dignity, 
Though jingling plates of bash, 
We never co ld associate 
With common colored trash. 
CHORUS. 
We hear de gong a 
sounding, 
We hear the steward call ; 
Now all the nigs are ready for a 
slide into the hall ! 
Oh ! flourish all de napkins 
Be sure to take your place, 
And skip around de tables wid aristocratic grace. 
Take this gcTium an's order, 
Bring a 
glass of water, 
Soup and fish on separate dish, 
The steward's in a 
flutter. 
Ah, here conies a 
stranger, a 
bay-seed and a 
granger, 
Slightly stoop, and spill the soup, 
And grease him wid de butter. 
(Repeat.) 
Polite attention to the man, 
That puts beneath his plate 
A dollar bill to make us prompt, 
Such folks will never wait. 
We'll smother him in luxuries, 
And eagerly prepare 
To order ev'ry dainty dish 
Dat's on de bill of fare. 
We hear de gong, etc. 
In summer time we wend our way, 
To Saratoga Springs, 
And answer ev'ry bell and call, 
For money that it brings. 
But white folks have to wait on us 
In winter when we're grand, 
And travel like aristocrats, 
With a 
colored minstrel band. 
We hear de gong, etc.

I'm getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no mare; 
I've laid de rusty-bladed hoe to rest ; 
Ole massa an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleepin' side by side; 
Deir spirits now are roaming wid do blest 
De scene am changed about de place, de darkies am all gone;

And I'se de only one dat's lea wid dis ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane.

But de angels watches over me when I 
lays down to sleep 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo. 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain, 
An' de only friend I've got now ig dis good ole dog oh mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
De chimney's falling down, 9te. 
De foot-path now is covered o'er dat led us round de bill, 
And de fences all are going to decay, 
An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill; 
De time has turned its course anodder way ; 
But I 
ain't got long to stay here, an' what little time I 
get 
I'll try and be contented to remain, 
Till death shall call my dog an' me to find a 
better home 
Mn dat little old log cabin in de lane.

When we reach dat good ohl p'ittee, we will offer up a

And we are left alone in this cold world; 
But when we're old and gray, then we will pass away, 
And join our friends on that celestial shore. 
We are waiting for the call, when we can join them all, 
Up there in that happy blessed place, 
And we'll hear their voices ringing, the same as when 
we're singing, 
While working in the sugar cane and corn.

BEAUTIFUL BEWILDERING FLOWER. 
Written by L. C. Ditzws, and sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
W HILE strolling on the avenue to-day, 
I 
met such a 
pretty girl, 
Her face as bright as any day in May ; 
It put my heart in quite a 
twirl. 
There is none such beauty can disclose, 
When she wakes from blissful dreams at early dawn, 
And the pride of all flowers is the rose, 
She's my beautiful bewildering flower. 
As we walked along together going home, 
My happiness did then and there increase ; 
Our hearts from each other never roam, 
We are happy as the summer morning's breeze. 
Oh, the time when we will happy be, 
Is not far away you bet, 
For she a 
little wife will be to me, 
Oh, how I 
bless the day that e'er we met. 
I 
met her first, ' twas in a 
summer bower, 
And I 
shall not forget her pleasing smile ; 
I 
would have claimed her then, had I 
the power ; 
Oh, my heart she did beguile. 
Then I 
asked her to be mine forever more, 
There came an answer, loving, kind and true, 
As we walked arm and arm through the door, 
She said to me, I 
always will be true.

GRANDMOTFT 
FIR'S CHAIR. 
As sung by JACK CONYCOY with immense success. 
The Music of this song will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 10 cents. 
MY 
grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood side by side. 
To my brother it was found, she had left a hundred 
pounds, 
The same unto my sister, I 
declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said, " I 
see, 
She has left to you her old arm-chair." 
CHOR 
And how they tittered, how they chaffed, 
How my brother and sister laughed, 
When they heard the lawyer declare, 
Granny had only left to me her old. arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the evening took the chair away ; 
The neighbors they me chaffed, ray brother at me 
laughed, 
And said it will be useful John some day.

GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR.—Coneluded. 
When you settle down in life, find some girl to be your 
wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare ; 
On a 
cold frosty night, when the fire is burning bright, 
Yau can sit in your old arm- chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
What my brOther said was true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life ; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and when she was my wife 
The old girl and me were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over, I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam, but each night would stay at 
home, 
And be seated in my old arm- chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor; 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
• 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage, and tore his hair, 
• 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm- chair ? 
And how they tittered, etc.

for me, 
And so around we balance and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie. 
Then it's on a 
summer's, etc.

CHICKENS IN THE GARDEN. 
As sung by JOHN W ILSON with great success. 
I 
ONCE did know a 
farmer, a 
good old jolly soul, 
Who used to work upon the farm around his country 
home; 
He had an only daughter, and to win her I 
did try, 
And when I 
asked him for her hand these words he did 
reply : 
CHORUS. 
Treat my daughter kindly, and say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die I'll leave to you my little house and farm, 
My horse, my plow, my sheep, my cow, my hogs, and 
little barn, 
And all those little chickens in the garden. 
I 
own I 
love this darling girl, and dearly she loves me, 
I 
used to go around her home her smiling face to see ; 
To watch her milk her father's ducks and admire her 
every charm, 
And many a 
drink of milk I 
got before I 
left the barn. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, and the old man would join our hands 
together, putting one of his own on each of our heads, 
he would say, God bless you, little children, and young 
man, remember, I'll break your back if you don't always— 
Treat my daughter, etc. 
Now the old man has consented, and married we will be. 
We'll own a 
little farm ourselves and live in harmony ; 
I'll use her well, his only child, and I'll treat her kindly, 
And I'll strive to keep the promise that the old man asked 
of me. 
SPOKEN.—And oh, Lord ! how his eyes used to twinkle, 
and how it used to tickle me every time I'd hear him say— 
Treat my daughter, etc.

SUCH A TERRIBLE TALKER IS MY MOTHER-
IN-LAW 
Words by L. C. DREWS, and sung with great success at HARRY WILLIAMS' 
Academy of Music, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Mv mother-in-law's a 
talker, she's always on the jaw, 
She's talked me out of everything I 
own ; 
She's a 
regular old huffer, the worst I 
ever saw ; 
I 
hope she'll kick the bucket, very soon. 
She's got eyes like a 
mackerel, a mouth like a 
street 
door; 
She can look two ways, and never squint, 
Oh, she talks and chins all day, till she couldn't talk no 
more; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
She is luny, she is crazy, 
She can knock the stuffing out of any man, 
She would talk you blind, if you didn't mind, 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
Sometimes she makes it lively and goes for my hair, 
And pulls me all around the room. 
I 
wish she was in heaven, or where she couldn't rare, 
She ought to take a 
trip up to the moon. 
Her tongue goes like a 
clapper, it is loose at both ends, 
She has jawed and talked me nearly blind ; 
She is jawing in, the morning, through the day, and 
through the night ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc. 
And when she goes to bed, and I 
think she's gone to 
sleep, 
Then she starts again with her old mouth ; 
I'd like to see her buried, a 
tear I'd never weep ; 
She talks worse than the niggers in the South, 
A 
talking machine to her, you can't compare ; 
She's worse than thirty-seven howling bulls ; 
She would talk a 
car conductor out of his fare ; 
Such a 
terrible talker, is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc.

SARAH McGOWN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Words and music by L. C. DREWS. 
Sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
IF 
you listen to me, I 
will sing you a 
song, 
About a 
young damsel that lived in this town, 
Her mouth looks like a 
tunnel, her tongue three yards long, 
And she goes by the name of Sarah McGown. 
Ri tu ral, ii tu ral, etc. 
Now she is the prettiest girl ever was seen, 
Her eyes they are yellow, her hair it is green, 
Her teeth they are freckled, her nose it is sore, 
Oh, I'll never be seen with this girl any more. 
Ri tu ral, ii tu ral, etc. 
I 
took her to a 
party on last Monday night, 
As soon as we got there she wanted to fight, 
I 
told her to keep quiet, or she'd get the boot, 
Then she hauled off and hit me a 
smash in the moot. 
Ri tu ral, ii tu ral, etc. 
When we went to go home she started to screech, 
Some fellow hit her in the neck with a 
big rotten peach, 
Then her dander was up, and she burst into tears, 
When along came a 
cop, and she got twenty years. 
Ri tu ral, ii tu ral, etc.

As sung by Miss CAREY. 
ONCE upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about, it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honeysuckle fair to see ; 
And the maiden watched the blossom daily, 
Heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent about it singing ever gayly, 
Ev'ry bird and ev'ry blossom knew 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Came a 
sudden dainty frown ; 
Greater love she did not know, 
No ! greater love she did not know, know, know, know, 
know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave and full of manly grace, 
Whispering tender words, he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny, smiling face ; 
Underneath the honeysuckle walked they, 
But her eyes were cast demurely down ; 
Seeing not, as softly, sweetly talked they, 
How its leaves were turning sere and brown, 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the rifle, 
Careless is the maid, I 
trow, 
Greater love bath learned to know. 
Yes! greater love bath learned to know, know, know, 
know, know. 
WHEN MeGIIINESS GETS A JOB. 
Sang by O'NEIL and CoNnoT. 
LAST winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reily, did- you say ? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and, throw dirt on the 
cart. 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
CIIORUS. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily, don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, new bonnets and new shoes ; 
As for me I'm done a 
crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better when McGainess gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay 
at home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our 
own; 
They come out like bees in summer-time and sworn for 
to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and 
slush, 
• 
But there's one thing in their 
favor, Italians they 
never do get lush ; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
. 
wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
! 
the spring-time now is coining we'll all have plenty 
work, 
I‘IcGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand-
some clerk. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three-cornered 
box. 
The boss is always bawling, Hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop ; 
Ah ! the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my al man at 
all. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily, etc.

On ! the moon is shining down on our snowy canvas town, 
And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
But my heart is sad and low, for I 
think of long ago, 
When the rivulet but laugh'd for thee and me, love. 
'Twas the autumn of the year, and the leaf was red and 
sear, 
But our hopes were bright as spring-time's budding bough, 
love ; 
They blossom'd, but they died, fell and drifted with the 
tide, 
To the ocean, where our joys are buried now, love. 
11EFEAD;. 
Oh ! the moon is shining down on our snowy canvas town, 
And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
But my heart is sad and low, for I 
think of long ago, 
When the rivulet but laugh'd for thee and me, love. 
Dost thou ever think of me, by that river of the sea, 
When the breath of hawthorn blossoms 
the plain, 
love ? 
When the glowworm lit the shade, whilst our vows of love 
were made, 
To be broken ere the blossoms came again, love. 
They tell me thou art gay, in thy palace far away, 
Where another gains the smiles that were ' once mine, 
love; 
And my heart is sad and low, for I 
think of long ago, 
And the folly of this heart that once was mine, love. 
REFRAIN. 
Whilst the moon is shining down on our snowy canvas 
town, 
And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
Here I cast upon the stream all remembrance of the 
dream, 
That is laughing water now to thee and me, love.

PRETTY WHILHELMINA. 
JOHNNY NEW. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with great success by NILEs and 
EVANS. 
I 
A3I going to tell you of a 
nice young mail, 
His name was Johnny New, 
He carried water for saloons, and cleaned out spittoons. 
And for you anything he would. do ; 
Every day about nine he would call for wine, 
But the seltzer he would get instead ; 
l'hey would squirt in his face with terrific pace. 
Until he was nearly dead. 
CHORUS. 
For he was a 
lusher you see, 
With money he had no use ; 
On errands he would rum oh he was a 
bum, 
But now he has gone to the deuce. 
On the sidewalk he would stand with a 
but in his hand, 
And horses to him they would tie, 
He would kick like a 
steer when they would offer him 
beer, 
And he would sigh for the good old rye ; 
His feet wasn't mates, they looked like skates ; 
His dark flowing locks were gray. 
His pants and his vest were made out West 
And in his hair was a 
load of hay. 
For he was a 
lusher, etc.

We used to say that Johnny was the smartest of us all, 
And around the area windows he would often make a 
call; 
His music is so lively, all the latest airs from France, 
The servant girls cannot keep still, the music makes them 
dance. 
3. 
Now one day John he chanced to play outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she'd never heard such music played before; 
It pleased her so that you must know she heavy sums would 
pay 
To John to stand outside the house and play to her all day. 
CH0.—Johnny Morgan, & c.

John played upon his instrument, and pleased the lady so, 
That when the time arrived to leave she would not let him go; 
She asked if he would marry her, which John did very soon; 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan plays her many a 
tune.

On we live about a

And as we came down the street, 
Not thinking any harm at all, 
Some blackguards we did meet. 
They said, just pipe thim two auld Tads, 
And stag that dizzy walk— 
Do you's think that they are Turks or what, 
Thim two ould foolish gawks ? 
CHORUS. 
Ah, thin, ain't we fools to stand such trash. 
Our hearts are almost broke ; 
They called our son a

Do they take us for two goats ? 
And our son John do play such pranks, 
That we don't know what to do.

'TWAS up in Central Park, one lovely summer's day, 
My heart .
NiTs like a 
lark, the sky was bright and gay ; 
I 
lingered, by the lake that sparkled in the sun, 
And, oh, the pretty birds did make sweet music, everyone. 
But soon I 
saw two eyes that fondly glanced at me, 
They seemed to wander from the skies, they looked so 
lovingly. 
A 
gentle form drew near; she, smiled—was I 
to blame ? 
Oh wouldn't life be dear, if I 
only knew her name ? 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only knew her name, if I 
only knew her name; 
Eyes looked sweetest love, to eyes that looked the same ; 
Then twilight softly fell, oh Cupid was to blame ! 
Oh I'd give the world, if I 
only knew her name. 
We saw the swans go by, like little silver ships ; 
I 
heard the sweetest sigh, from luscious, rosy lips ; 
The stars come out at last, and yet I 
could not go. 
How quickly then the moments passed, the heart alone 
can know. 
But soon beside the gate we softly bid adieu, 
For oh the hours were growing late, and birds were 
dreaming too; 
I 
wonder when we'll meet ; my heart is still the same ; 
Oh life were angel sweet, if I 
only knew her name. 
If I 
only knew her name, etc.

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
By GE.oRGE HOET. 
NED, you're going to join the profession, I 
hear 
Now, hark to a 
word of advice, 
From one who was born in a 
theatre, 
knd has lived your short life over twice. 
Pray don't let the tinsel attract you, 
For that, you must know, is the crust. 
To make it look bright to the every-day world, 
While the apple inside is but dust. 
Here, where we stand, is the theatre's back door, 
The play is just over within,— 
What a 
pity it is that some people think 
That door is the portal to sin ; 
And that every poor actress, or actor the same, 
Who toils on the stage for her bread, 
Is an outcast from all that is holy and good, 
And had better by far to be dead. 
But follow me now to that, small world within, 
And dodge round the " wings " and the " flats," 
Though take care of your clothes, for it's dusty back here, 
And these stairways are hard ones on hats ; 
So look where you step, mind the numberless traps, 
And shortly I 
think you will say, 
That theatrical life is more than a 
song, 
And an actor's more than mere play. 
Now we stand on the stage, how dreary it looks, 
When stripped of its gorgeous attire ; 
And only this great giant serpent of hose 
In wait for its enemy—fire. 
Look out in the front, where a 
short time ago, 
Sat the audience joyous and gay, 
Now there is nothing but gloom, and the place 
Seems best suited for some ghostly play. 
There, at the back, are crowded the scenes, 
The " throne," you perceive, is but gilt ; 
The " palace," but canvas, the exotics rare, 
Are but paper, they never can wilt.

BEHIND TTIPI SCENES.—Concluded. 
The great chandeliers are let down by a 
rope, 
And the gasman alters the " moon," 
It all may look fine, I 
daresay, from the front, 
Back here the bright picture fades soon. 
Now look at the actors ; first conies the " star," 
While his servant man carries his bag ; 
Next the " Comedian," weary and sick, 
Who can scarcely his limbs with him drag ; 
The devil disease claims him for his own, 
As is seen by his figure so spare, 
And yet as you laughed at him during the play, 
You'd have thought he had never a 
care. 
There goes a 
poor ballet girl just from the stage, 
Though in tatters and rags is she now, 
You never would think that she is the girl 
Who a 
short time ago made a 
bow 
To an audience full of enrapture untold 
At her dancing that ne'er was surpassed ; 
Her tinsel is changed for that faded plaid shawl 
That protects her fair face from the blast. 
Look there at your feet, that black yawning ditch 
Where you'd think to see spirits appear, 
Is where not long ago the orchestra sat, 
While their music delighted the ear ; 
Now look up above to the " borders " and " flies," 
Now hear how the echo rebounds ; 
The only thing moving outside of ourselves, 
Is the watchman pursuing his rounds. 
Yes, there is, as you say, a 
much brighter side, 
For sonic have grown rich by their art ; 
But I 
don't. think there's one who has been on the stage, 
Who would not feel sick at his heart, 
If a 
daughter or son should follow his steps ; 
So, Ned, boy, just take my advice, 
And before you determine to follow this life, 
Remember this scene, and think twice.

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Words and music 'by FLORENCE HARPER. 
The Music of this song is published by SPEAR and DEHNEOFF, 
717 Broadway, New York: 
Price 40 cents. 
THERE it stands in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall ! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, • 
For no one now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh! how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I, 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tell, 
By that old wooden rocker we all lov'd so well. 
moRus. 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years had she sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stands by the wall, 
If this chair could but speak, oh ! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell : 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
He cherish'd his freedom, the red, white t and blue ! 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride ; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
As she sat by the fire, etc. 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have follow'd her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her in the " sweet by-and-by,', 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs, or her cap ; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap ; 
Never mo-re will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
As she sat by the fire, etc. 
Mary, the Walker. 
Written expressly for M URPHY /1: M ACK by FRANK E. 
Monstr. 
Ant.—" Biddy, the Ballet Girl." 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation ; 
She beats the life out•of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education, 
A 
masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook " she does the statues ; 
But lately she has Cancelled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, lier front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy, 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score-board all marked with long 
streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to au, music keeps beating, 
The men they all &lout, " Give it up, you're too 
stout!" 
But. Mary sticks out to the finis. 
-Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And it they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be proud as a 
lord, 
No danger ot my trunks getting stuck, 
n:,r Mary will walk oil with the board. 
Oh, her front name, etc.

Words by THOMAS E. 
POWERS, author of the " Hoolahan Muske. 
teers," " Mary Ann Kehoe," " MeCarthy's Boarding House." 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL, LEW SMITH ani Jack CONROY. 
W HEN we rise up in the morning, 
Down to the yard we go, 
With a 
towel and a 
bar of soap, 
To wash ourselves, you know. 
While Murphy pumps the water 
Into a 
big wash- tub, 
All the boarders stand around, 
And then begin to rub. 
CHORUS. 
Take your elbow out of the way, 
Says Mike to Dan O'Day. 
Who the deuce has stolen the soap ? 
Cries Larry Boyle the moke. 
Troth, they use a 
scrubbing brush, 
On " Yaller Pete," the lush, 
And comb his hair with a 
one-arm chair, 
In Murphy's coffee house. 
(Repeat.) 
When we get all thro' our washing, 
At the table we sit down, 
Each man gets a 
wash bowl of soup, 
Made by the cook Magown. 
A 
plate of fine cut cabbage, 
Oyster pie with three years crust, 
A 
ad a 
glass of fresh buttermilk, 
You'd drink it till you'd bust. 
CHORUS. 
Charles Henry Mickey Shay, 
Likes sugar in his tay. 
Hand me down your empty plate, 
I'll fill it with cold mate. 
Muggins, man, don't you be shy, 
Slap mustard on your pie, 
Ate a 
plate of crame, ' twill make you drams 
Of Murphy's coffee house. 
(Repeat 1st Chorus.) 
At night on the front piazza 
We smoke our cigarettes, 
Then go to sleep on the fire- escape, 
Beneath mosquito nets. 
If the eve is warm and sultry, 
We'll have an ice cream lunch, 
And if it is cold and dreary, 
We'll drink a 
hot rum punch. 
CHORUS. 
Take your cold feet off me back, 
Sheldon says to Andy Mack. 
You ought to hear O'Hern snore, 
Sounds like the cannon's roar. 
On an mild straw bed we lay, 
And sleep till the break of day, 
When we wake again, we're drenched with rain, 
In Murphy's coffee house.

Copyright, 1879, by HARRISON MILLARD. 
IF 
love were what the rose is, 
And I 
were like the leaf, 
Our lives would grow together 
In sad or singing weather, 
Blown fields or ilow'rful closes, 
Green pleasure or gray grief, 
If love were what the rose is, 
And I 
were like the leaf. 
If I 
were what the words are, 
And love were like the tune, 
With double sound and single 
Delight our lips would mingle, 
With kisses, glad as birds are, 
That get sweet rain at noon. 
If I 
were what the words are, 
And love were like the tune. 
If you were life, my darling, 
And I, your love, were death, 
We'd shine and snow together, 
Ere March made sweet the weather. 
;With daffodil and starling 
And hours of fruitful breath. 
If you were life my darling 
And I, your love, were death. 
If you were April's lady, 
And I 
were lord in May, 
We'd throw with leaves for hours, 
And draw for days with flowers, 
'Till day like night were shady, 
And night were bright like day. 
If your were April's lady 
And I 
were lord in May.

CINCINNATI, IN THE STATE OF OHO-HO. 
Composed and sung by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
Music by DAVE DRAHAM. 
Dedicated to ROBERT STICKNEY, Esq. 
COME all ye lovers, young and old, and listen to my song, 
For I'll relate and truly state the cause of all that's wrong. 
Ere I 
did roam I 
loved at home a 
girl named Molly, Oh! 
But now she's gone and left me in a 
state of grief and 
woe. 
CHORUS. 
I'm travelling round the country, and I'm searching high 
and low; 
But she's gone to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho- ho. 
Last week I 
went to Brooklyn to see some boys from 
Clare. 
I 
saw Michael Ryan, Pat O'Brien, and a 
boy named Mar-
tin Hare. 
They said that Molly went out West, but the place they 
do not know, 
Still they think it's Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
CHORUS. 
Your American country is so large, where to go I 
do not 
know 
And look for Cincinnati, or its State of Oho-lio. 
Now, if I 
don't find my Molly dear, I'll tell you what I'll 
do: 
I'll go to Salt Lake City—'tisn't one I'll have, but two— 
And if ever Molly finds me out, I'll have her for to know 
She may go to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
CHORUS. 
And if ever Molly finds me out, I'll have her for to know 
She may go to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
THE DINNER BELL. 
Parody on " The Water Mill." 
By BEN COLLINS expressly for HALEY and WEsi. 
LISTEN IO 
the Dinner Bell; 
At 12 o'clock each day 
How the boarders shout " Hurrah," 
To the dining room hurry away. 
The proprieter looks so pale and sick 
As they all sit down to eat, 
And though looking yet he cannot tell 
Which one his board will beat. 
Here, pass that " Union butter," 
One of them boarders said. 
If the mill can never grind 
We don't get any bread. 
What a 
hardened hungry lot 
These boarders seem to be, 
How they grasp and gormandize 
Most everything they see ; 
They were never known to stop, 
Unless they had their fill, 
Often coming back again 
To that corn-beef mill; 
Truly speaks the landlord, 
" 
My clothes are fading fast; 
I 
cannot wash my Ulster 
In the water that has past." 
( 
1 ) 
" 
Take this lesson to yourselves, 
But don't take anything more ; 
Pay your board, leave my house, 
Or I'll fire you out the door. 
You want your trunk, I 
want my money, 
I've trusted you enough ; 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough ; 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indians 
You may come back in silk ; 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in milk." 
Oh what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay ; 
A 
dead-beat will come back again, 
'Cause he " couldn't stay away." 
Some will ask for a 
fire escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Put in the refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your hearts 
Before you bring in your trunk 
The coffee mill can never grind 
When the cook is on a 
drunk.

THE FIVE CENT SHAVE . 
Written, composed and sung by Tou CANNON. 
Oni BM going to tell to you of the troubles I 
went ellrough 
In a 
barber's shop that isn't very far away. 
My beard it being strong, I 
thought ' twould not be wrong, 
To go and have it trimmed a 
bit the other day ; 
And being short of cash, it struck me like a 
flash, 
That five cents was enough to pay in these hard times. 
So I 
went into a 
place, as I 
thought it no disgrace, 
To practice strict economy and save my dimes, 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
went into one of these barber's shops, where 
they give you a 
shave for five cents and throw in a 
chronic). 
Well I 
the fellow put me into a 
chair arid took down a 
small 
bottle off the shelf and was going to put it to my nose. What's 
that 'I 
says 1. 
Chloroform, says he. 
I 
didn't come here to have 
my teeth pulled out, says 1 Oh, well, says he, if you can 
stand it I 
can 
Go ahead, says 1. 
cnortus. 
So he lathered me, he slathered me, he bruised me and abused 
me, 
lie tore me, and nearly drove me to my grave. 
Ile tickled rue, he pickled me, he scratched me and he patched 
me, 
And I'd rather have the measles than his five cent shave. 
I 
stood it for awhile, I 
tried in vain to smile, 
Ile talked about the weather as he scratched away ; 
lie took me by the hair and held me in the chair, 
I 
thought my days vere numbered and began to pray ; 
At lenath I 
gave a 
roar, says I, I 
want no more. 
Here ! you can have my pocket- book, but spare my life, 
Take all that I 
possess, and finish my distress, 
1 
cannot stand the torture of your slaughter- house knife. 
SPOKEN.— You (
night to see the way he went about it. 
The 
first thing I 
knew he had his knee upon my chest and was 
sawing away like a 
day's work. 
And then he called out to the 
fellow that cleans the spittoon ; here, Emanuel, come and put 
some grease on this razor, I'm stuck. 
Well, between the two 
they finally (rot it out, and I 
looked in the glass, and by the 
hokey my face was all marked out in town lots. 
What's this 
ynu have on my face ? I 
says. 
Oh ! well, he says, we expect 
our customers to come back, and that's a 
diagram of the route. 
Well, says 1, you may call this a 
clean shave, but I 
call it a 
clean skin mil a 
barefaced one at that, and I'll never go there 
again, because, 
So he lathered me, etc.

For the old folks are corning back to me; 
But give me your hand, oh, Willie darling, 
I 
love you wherever you may be. 
Bring back the old folks. etc.

SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT  
Sung by HALEY, W EST, and SPARKs BROTHERS. 
W HEN I've passed in my checks, little rosebud, 
When I'm six feet under the turf, 
I'll forgive, you though you took me for a 
sucker, 
And played me for every penny I 
was worth ; 
You said I 
might " look, but I 
nuisn't touch," 
And " you put me in quite a 
dilemma," 
But there's one little snap which I 
wish you would fake up, 
That's to see my grave is whitewashed every summer, 
Oh, the days will come to you, poison face, 
When you'll think of how you back-capped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off my grave with a 
pitchfork, will you, 
darling ? 
And decorate my grave with turkey breast, Thanksgiv-
ing ? 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember 
How you used to give me taffy on a 
stick; 
With your dizzy jokes you nearly paralyzed me, 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked ; 
I 
will meet you in that everlasting " By and By," 
Tra la lee, skip the sofa, you're my baby. 
Plant huckleberry trees on the next lot to me, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady ; 
Oh, my name will soon be Dennis, sweet Aleena. 
When you had a 
dollar I 
always stuck to you, 
Get a 
host of volunteers to play some kind of music, 
And see my grave is kept red, white and blue.
