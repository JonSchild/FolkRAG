FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washinston. 
TO -NE fUILLIC, 
Joux REALLy was born in Liverpool, Eng., in the year 1854, 
of Irish parents. 
Being of a 
roving disposition, he left home 
at an early age. After travelling nearly all over the world, he fi-
nally arrived at San Francisco, Cal., where he became acquaint-
ed with a 
great many professional people, who, seeing that he 
had talent, insisted on his entering the profession— which he 
did—as a 
Song- and- Dance man, in which capacity he continued 
for a 
few years. 
At this period he formed some new acquaint-
ances, who advised him to go into the Irish business, and John, 
seeing that line of business suited him, he adopted it; and 
since his first appearance as an Irish Comedian, he has been 
attended with wonderful success, and has played in all the 
leading variety theatres in this country.

the time he came on the stage, there was nothing but laughter 
and applause. 
He was recalled eight times.— Chicago Tine. 
PARK TnEATRE, BROOKLYN.—Mr. 
John Reilly appeared 
last evening and was very well received. 
In his style, voice 
and natural make-up, he is far superior to any performer in 
his line we have yet had in this city.—Argus, Brooklyn, Oct. 
1875.

new 
troupe last evening, and the auditorium was, as is the general 
custom at this popular resort, crowded. 
Mr John Reilly 
proved the favorite of the evening. 
As an Irish vocalist and 
dancer he surpasses all artists in that line yet seen in this sec-
tion of the country.— Boston Express. 
Mn. REILLY in his funny songs and especially the one entitled 
Charlie Ross," is very amusing and h. a 
great favorite, being 
repeatedly recalled. — Boston Daily Globe.

Good evening to ye's, one and all, 
I 
ask yer kind attintion, 
The subject of me song is one 
To you I'll now make mention. 
It's about a 
day not far away, 
Although it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORES. 
The drums will beat and the bands will play, 
As down the street we march away, 
That's the time that we'll all feel gay, 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
If you meet me on that day, 
You must not get offended, 
For what I 
say or do to 'you 
It never is intended. 
And whin I'm out upon parade, 
I 
leave all others in the shade, 
It's grand to see me in the Irish Brigade 
On Saint Patrick's day in the morning. 
The drums will beat, Szc.

We've been a

When we started it was early in de Fall. 
We're not such very fancy darkies, 
Although we always keep a- looking clean. 
And we hope when you go home to-night your verdict it will he, 
That you are satis,fi-d with what you've seen. 
We used to pick de oranges and sell dem in de streets, 
And seldom dat we made enough to lib: 
So den we went to blacking boots upon de L:emmen's feet, 
But we got too big and had to quit de biz. 
Now we ain't got time to tell you all our history, 
For which, we hope, you will not think us mean, 
For where we go we always like to hear the people say 
Of us, they're satisfied with what they've Sets!"

13th OF OCTEMBER. 
Sung by.REILLy:with great success at the Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
On the 13th of Octember, 
In the middle of July, 
The morning it was raining 
And the afternoon was dry, 
I 
spied a 
lovely damsel 
Sitting under an old oak tree, 
And I 
didn't say nothing to her, 
And she said the same to me, 
She was a 
I 
wely creature, 
Which plain was to he seen, 
Her brow and chin were far apart, 
And her nose stuck out between. 
Her teeth were neither ! lack nor white 
And she had a 
swivel ey?, 
And a 
lovelier mouth was never seen 
For ham or chicken pie. 
Oh, I 
wish I 
was the President 
Of this great country, 
I 
would spend the Summer at Long Branch, 
In a 
cottage by the sea. 
I 
would receive all presents, 
I'd smoke the best cigars, 
And whin I'd go to Washington 
I'd ride in special cars.

JOHN THEY WANT YOU 
FOR MAYOR, 
Written by FRANK TURNER for JOHN REILLY. 
Good evening. m friends, you're all looking well, 
I 
came here to see you and my troubles to tell 
Whin I 
go along the street the boys at me stare, 
And they all holler out, " John, they want you for Mayor!" 
The other day, walking down Baxter street, 
One fellow said I 
looked like a 
heat, 
I 
ran for the blackguard and pulled down his hair, 
And he shouted out " John, they want you for Mayor!" 
Their shouting at me I 
now understand, 
It's because they want my education and land. 
They'll never get nothing from me, I 
do swear, 
Unless they all say '• John, we want you for Mayor!"

Cold water sure's the cream!

'Twas on the Fourth of last July, 
This is the truth and not a 
lie, 
That Dan McGowan and Mary NIaloye, 
In wedlock were united; 
And as they had some cash on hand, 
Says Dan, our wedding will be grand; 
More power to you, says Mary Ann. 
Now who shall be invited: 
The Claikeys, Fagins. and the Doyle, 
Murphys, Dugins, and the Gores, 
Whalen, Ragen, and Paddy Miles. 
The Bolivers, and a 
hundred more.

'Pon me word, the President's Ball. 
Or a

Finnigan's wake was nothing at ail 
Compared to this wedding. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Boys and girls with love a 
dying— 
Children in the corners crying— 
At McGowan's wedding. 
Some were playing forty-fives— 
More of them were shaking dice— 
And the girls were making pies; 
The bride was telling stories. 
Some were smoking their dudheena. 
And boys a 
hugging their Colleens; 
More were eating Pig's cruheens; 
Sure all were in their glory. 
Fiddlers playing jigs and reels-
1 
tell you they were a 
happy lot— 
Until the whiskey made them squeal--
That was the time that things got hot! 
Cnoitus. 
Melah, murder, what a 
time. 
Did'nt we see them cut a 
shins; 
Drinking whiskey, sometimes vr 
And on the the lunch a 
raiding, 
Hugging, squeezing one another— 
Children crying for their mother— 
All mix' d 
up—this way and 'tother— 
At Metaowan's wedding. 
THE RISING POLITICIAN. 
Written and sung by HARRY BENNETT. 
GOOD evening to ye 9119 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of my victory 
U, ,on elet tion day. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And Murphy wis the man 
Who ivied hard to d 
fe t 
me, 
But he gave himsulf away; 
He never tried repeatin% 
And ihat's the way I 
be t 
him--
I 
voted seven times myself 
In the ould Fourth Ward so gay. 
CRORYJS. 
NOT" I'm a 
politician, 
I 
bolo a 
high posithin, 
I 
gained by repetition, 
Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free-lunch could be found, 
And many's the plate of soup, my boys, 
Did they put out of sight; 
We swept the district clean, 
And the-divil such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night. 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned. 
When the victory it was earned, 
It gave me satisfaction and 
It filled me with delight. 
Now I'm a 
politician, Et.4. 
And now I'll tell to you 
What I 
am going to do; 
I'll not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true; 
They shall have eiAit hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay, 
And live as well as those big bugs 
Upon Fifth Avenue; 
Sure I'll . mprove the city, 
For I 
think it is a ity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
CHORUS. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary, 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do.

WHEN darkness barbaric plunged Europe in night, 
One spot still remained where truth's day-star shone bright; 
'Twas a 
land whose mere name is like music to me, 
That dear ocean Eden, old Erin Maciaree! 
Alas for her trust in the stranger who came. 
A 
friend in pretence, a 
despoiler in aim; 
Let the past be the past, yet our motto must be, 
Her old place among nations to Erin Machreel 
CDORrS, 
Alas for her trust in the stranger who came. 
A 
friend in pretence, a 
despoiler in aim; 
Let the past be the past, yet our motto must be. 
Her old place amonL, nations to Erin Alachree! 
The land of bright spirits, so gallant and gay, 
Of sympathies warm as the sunshine of day; 
For his generous ways Pat has always a 
plea 
In " Cead Mille Ealthe" of Erin Machree! 
Talk of Venus just sprung from the bright ocean foam, 
could show you ten thousand such charmers at home 
'Mong the white bosoned maids, all so modest, yet free, 
Who bloom, thick as tlowr's in old Erin Machree 
Chorns—Ala, SO, 
If you wish for bright scenes, there's a 
choice of them t

If for legends unmatch'd, she has plenty to spare; 
Would you like to make love to some swung Banshee 
You must just make your home in old Erin Machree 
Would you find the true Lethe of every ill, 
You must taste her " potteen" just fresh from the hill. 
Would you smother a

All you want is the music of Erin Machree!

But now play-actors and such trash do all his time engage.

He wears long shoes and stroked socks, 
And he says they're all the rage: 
M.y carpet's tore, and my house is in a

Since James whit on the stage. 
He throws his feet up high, because he thinks it is the style, 
He broke my chandelier last night, and filled my clothes with 
oil, 
He says he'll make a 
terrible hit, and tells me he's immense. 
And he took the mild woman's petticoat to play the nagur-
winch. 
He wears long shoes and stroked socks, 41.t,c. 
He has my hat and coat all spoiled, and everything is broke, 
His foot whit tbron;th the floor whin trying to dance the lively

THE FEN1ANS' ESCAPE, 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung, by the great Irish Comedian and Voealist. 
,T AMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story Ill relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
, They struck a 
blow for freedom. and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly. 
On board the bark Catalpa. waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay. 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, i
n 
sa fety s'ss the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom , soon 
to bless them 
ever 
more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryout eould them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim. 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette. - and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should " Heave 
to.'• 
But noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag. that floats on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
I'ts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblein at the fore. so plain now to be seen. 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran' 
He knew his chance. was slim to tight, the boys of Uncle Sam' 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and b 
Id Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
He dared the English- man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in' triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands' flag of 
green.

TERRENCE MULDOON. 
By CON T.

For En. M URRAY. 
In the county Tipperary there lived, long ago, 
A Widow whose husband was dead. 
And whose son, I 
am told, when scarce a 
year old. 
Sang songs and drank whiskey in bed. 
And as he grew big he could dance ye a 
jig. 
On a 
table, a 
chair, or a 
spoon; 
And the ladies would sigh for a 
glance of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon.

Be could read, he could write— 
He could dance, he could fight; 
He could sing or could whistle a 
tune, 
And the ladies would sigh, for a 
gLince of his eye, 
Or a 
kind word from Terrence Muldoon. 
Young Terrence was party as purty could be. 
And his features—so every one said— 
Was gentle and mild as a 
two year old child, 
While his hair was a 
beautiful red ; 
And as for his hand, by my soul it was grand. 
And his nose it turned up to the Moon; 
Sure, the boys in the street, all envied the feet, 
Of the beautiful Terrence Muldoon. 
Ii could read Ezc. 
Young Terrence's eyes were as blue as the skies. 
And his voice was as sweet as a 
fife; 
But his passion to stale often sent him to jail, 
And at last put an end to his life. 
For one night in his sleep he was caught stealing sheep. 
And the jury agreed very soon— 
A 
rope, do you see, 'round tile limb of a 
tree, 
Boon ended poor Terrence Muldoon.

VAN DIEMANT LAND. 
As Sung by WM MA.Tolt: 
Come all you lads of learning and rambling boys, beware, 
Whenever you go a 
hunting, bring your dogs gun and snare, 
For those lofty hills and valleys we have at our command, 
Not thinking of the last farewell going to Van Dieman's 
land. 
There were three men from Galway town, Martin. Luke, 
and James, 
They were three loyal comrades their countrymen they 
formed, 
And it's there they were transported by the keepers of the 
strand, 
And for seven long years transported, going to Van Die-
man's land. 
We had a 
true-love on board the ship, Jane Murphy was 
her name; 
And there she was transported for carrying on the game; 
The captain fell in love with her, and married her out of 
hand; 
0, she gave us the best of treatment, going to Van Die-
man's land. 
This land in port we went to, was on a 
foreign shore, 
The negroes they surrounded us, about five hundred score; 
They yoked us like horses, and sold us out of hand, 
They yoked us to a 
trace, bravely, to plow on Van Die-
man's land. 
The houses they built for us, were made of mud and clay, 
The beds we had to lie upon, was made of rotten hay, 
0, rotten hay for beds, ray boys, and slumber if you can; 
Sure, they gave us the worst of treatment, all in Van Die-
man's land. 
One night. as I 
lay down to sleep, I 
had a 
pleasant dream, 
I 
dream'd that I 
was in old Ireland, down by a 
purling 
stream ; 
I 
dream'd I 
was in old Ireland, my true-love at my com-
mand; 
But when I 
awoke my heart was broke, all in Van Die-
man's land.

With primrose stars appearin', 
0, Queen was she of all the flow'rs. 
The lovely Rose of Erin ; 
Beneath the shade of Irish hills, 
Their Isle's own colors wearin', 
Ah! where smiled the shamrock all the day, 
There dwelt the Rose of Erin, 
Dwelt the Rose of Erin. 
I 
saw her next in summer time, 
With ev'ry charm endearin', 
For she was in her girlhood's prime, 
The lovely Rose of Erin ; 
We met beside the banks of Erne, 
No thought of sorrow fearin' ; 
Ah ! yet oft I 
thought her lily pale, 
My darlin' Rose of Erin. 
Darlin' Rose of Erin. 
Alas! alas on Autumn's wave, 
To Heaven her bark was_steerin', 
And I, no pray'r of mine might save,

THE DAYS OF '49. 
Sung with great success by W ILLIAM COTJRTRIGHT. 
YOU'RE looking now on old Tom Moore, a 
relic of former days, 
A 
bummer, too, they call me now, but what care I 
for praise; 
For my heart is filled with the days of old, and oft' do I 
repine 
For those days of old, those days of gold, those days of '49. 
4. 
I had comrades, too, a 
saucy crew, hard cases I 
must confesa; 
But still they were brave and true, my boys, as hunters from 
the West; 
They'd stand the pinch, and never flinch, and never fret nor 
whine, 
But like good old bricks, they stood the kicks, in the days of '49. 
There's Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget, for the luck that he 
always had; 
He'd deal for you both night and day, or as long as you had 
acad. 
One night a 
pistol laid him low, ' twas his last lay out in fine, 
For it caught Pete sure, dead in the door, in the days of '49. 
There was Poker Bill, he was one of the boys, he was always 
in for a 
game, 
And whether he lost, or whether he won, it was always to 
him the same, 
43 
He would ante a 
slug, or rush the buck, or go a 
hat-full blind; 
But in a 
game with death, poor Bill lost his breath, in the days 
of '49. 
There was Buffalo Bill,he could outroar a 
buffalo bull, you bet; 
He'd roar all night, and he'd roar all day, and I 
guess Bill's 
roaring yet. 
One night he fell in a 
prospect hole, t'w as a 
roarin' bad design, 
For in that hole Bill rolled out his soul, in the days of '49. 
There was Galous Jake, a 
butcher boy, so fond of getting tight, 
And whenever he got on a 
spree he was spilin' for a 
fight. 
One night he ran against a 
knife in the hands of old Bob Cline, 
So over Jake we held a 
wake, in the days of ' 49. 
There was old lame Jesse, a 
hard old cuss, and he never 
would repent. 
He never missed a 
single meal, and he never put up a 
cent. 
But poor old Jesse, like all the rest, did at last to death resign, 
And in his bloom he went up the flume, in the days of '49. 
Of all the comrades I 
had then, not one remains to boast, 
I'm left alone in my misery, like some poor wandering ghost; 
The boys they all say Pm a 
fraud, and call me a 
travging sign, 
saying, there's Tom Moore, a 
hi-unmer sure, of the days of '
49.

PADDY'S DREAM, 
As sung with great success by GiTtNELLA BROTETERS, 
JOHN BULL he was an Englishman, 
Who went on tramp cne day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
For to carry him a 
long way ; 
He traveled along for many a 
mile. 
Yet no one dal lie sce, 
until he met an Irishman 
By the name of Pat Magee. 
Good morning, Pat, says Johnny Bull, 
Where are you going to? 
Oh, faith, I 
do not know, says Pat. 
I'm looking for a 
job to do. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Paddy? 
Says Johnny Bull to Pat. 
Sure it's the only thing Pm wanting, 
For I 
havn't got nary a 
rap, 
They had not travelled very far, 
When a. Scotchman, like them, out. of work, 
And by his look and appearance, 
As hungry as a 
Turk. 
Can 3
-on lend me a 
shilling, Scotty? 
Says bold Paddy Magee. 
I 
canna do that, says the Scotchman, 
For I 
lumina got nary a 
bubee. 
Ch. I 
have got a 
three-pence. 
What shall we do with that? 
Buy three- pence worth of whiskey, 
'Twill cheer us up, says Pat, 
Oh dinna do that, says Scotty, 
I'll WI you what yell do, 
Buy three- pence worth of oat meat 
I 
ii make some nice bergne, 
Oh no, we'll buy a 
loaf of bread, 
The Englishman did say, 
And in yonder hay-stack 
We'll sleep our hunger away. 
Well get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning. 
Who dreams the greatest dream. 
Now, the Englishman, by the morning, 
Ten million men had been 
For years a 
digging a 
turnip out, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip out. 
By working night and day, 
It took four million horses 
This turnip to 'aul away. 
Now the Scotchman, by the morning 
Forty million men had been 
For years a 
making a 
boi,er. 
The largest ever seen. 
What was it for ? says John Thin, 
Was it make of copper or tin ? 
'Twas made of copper, says Scotty, 
To boil your turnip in. 
SroK 
EN. — Now comes Pat's dream. 
Oh, sure, I've been dreaming. 
And drained a 
pleasant dream. 
1 
dramed I 
was in a 
hay- stack, 
All by a 
purling stream. 
And you and Scotty were there too. 
You were, upon my oath. 
By the powers. I 
dreamed I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up and ate the loaf.

Now where is the country tiLLt stood the oppression 
Like old Ireland, the gem of the sea. 
It reminds me of the famine that was in old Irt land.

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed by JOIP.:NY RoAr.u. 
COME 
all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to meal, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
'or you have to fight both day and night ' gainst John Bull and 
his crew.

Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
"ri8 the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home fu Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheers. 
Saying: Good-bye. my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, (Vc. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town, 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh, clear the .track. !" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamror

We're standing near our hearth aga;n, 
But roof there's Ilene above ; 
The stars are weeping down their tears,

And  
hard to bear. 
We did our best but soon the writ 
Was fastened at the door, 
They bade us leave the home we lov'd, 
The home we'll see no more. 
Oh! the cold is in my heart, Katrine! 
I've nothing now to cheer,

When cruel men they cams and st:ip'cl 
Our cabin, once so bright; 
And left us but the cold bars walls, 
That bleak and wintry night;

And I'm Dot in the least dissipated.

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular

I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go, 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more. 
Wid a

We inarch'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore,

"Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it?

Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad," 
I 
found it very difilkilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paradin' in the Hall;

used to make, the sargint he would say: 
"Yet as awkward as the divil; doan't ye bould yet gon that

But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slink 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad."

Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we'll plod, 
Shouldher arms and counther marchin' in the timid " Awkward

Whin out into the strate we go to have a

And wid the sargint on oar right no more we'll he afraid,

I'll make 'ern feel me vingeance, all sargints under me! 
I'll have 'em marchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk, 
rejuice them to the ranks at wance, and there I'll make 'era 
walk! 
if that ain't punishment enough, " like any other gawk," 
Cad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

JOHN MITCHELL. 
As Sung by ED. M URRAY. 
1 
tun a 
true born Irishman, John Mitchell is my name, 
'I o 
free my own brave countrymen from Merry Town luame 
I 
strugglled hard both night and day to tree my native land, 
For which I 
was transported, as you may understand. 
When first 1 
joined my countrymen, . • was in '42, 
And then what followed after, I'll quick.y tell to you; 
I 
raised the standard of Repeal and gloried in the deed, 
And I 
vowed to Heaven I'd never rest until Erin it was 
freed. 
While here in prison, close confined, waiting for my trial 
day, 
My loving wife, she came to me, nnd these words to me 
did say: 
Oh, John ! my dear, cheer up your heart, and daunted de 
noi be--
For it's better to die tor Erin's r_ghts than to live in slavery. 
When 1 
received my sentence, ' twits on a 
foreign pround, 
Where hundreds of my comrades assembled all around; 
My liberty was oftered me if their I 
would forsake their 
cause 
But I'd rather die ton thousand deaths, than forsake nay 
Irish boy: 
FaTewer 
true born Irishmen—Farewell! my country 
too! 
But to leave my own poor babes behind, it grieves me 
worse than all; 
There is one request I 
ask of you, when your liberty you 
gain. 
Remember John Mitchell. far away, though a 
convict 
bound in chains.

leading New York papers eay of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Nail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Pauses's, 9S Nag-
can street ca.led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we reconiruencl 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad hr bit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without an e 
further necessity of explaining "how, when and 
whore to do it." and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.' 
The N. Y. Eeert-ing Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opsrandi of flitting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might at-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do Lot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

" All ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called ' llueesarte Dretyry,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu-
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick.

pearance of a

bound theta practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody
