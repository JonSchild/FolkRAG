GUS WILLIAMS ' " JAKEY WOOLFENSTEIN " 
SONGSTER. 
TO TIIE PUBLIC. 
ONCE again I 
have to thank the Public for the liberal Zargess 
with which they have rewarded my earnest efforts to amuse. 
If I 
have gained a popularity rarely accorded to any other 
vocalist, I 
know much of it is owing to the fact that I 
have 
always carefully eliminated from my pieces every word that 
even approached impropriety; knowing full well that though I 
have thus failed " to tickle the ears of the groundlings," I 
have 
gained the approbation of those of" wisest censure." 
A word 
here as to the authorship of my songs may not be out of place. 
It often happens that a 
subject, or an idea, that seems full of 
fun or melody occurs to me, and then I 
get some person of tact 
or talent to expand or work up the subject for me. 
In such 
cases, it will be seen, that the work is as much mine as St. 
Paul's was the creation of Christopher Wren, though that great 
architect never dressed a 
stone or laid a 
course of masonry for 
his fautless structure. 
But " to pull down the blind " on this subject before I 
tire 
my readers, by keeping them from the goodly array of songs 
and sketches which this precedes. 
Here I 
feel that I 
should express my warm thanks to the 
gentlemen of the press, who have ever given me my full share 
of praise for my efforts to please. 
And now, once more, I 
sincerely thank the numerous friends 
who have rewarded my endeavors to please them, with plaudits 
that will never be forgotten by their thankful servant, 
NEW Yong, April, 1876.

His name vas Jakey Woolfenstein,

De girls dey call him Ostrich, 
Vich alvays makes him sneeze.

He parts his hair beneath his chin,

His farder has got lots of tin, 
He's yotth aboud dwo dollars; 
In big bananas he's got stock, 
In business he is sharp; 
You should hear him blay " Die Wacht em Rhine" 
Upon de Hebrew harp.

For wherever ye may go, 
Ve show such splendid marching, 
In de rain, or drough de snow.

TEMPERANCE SPEECH. 
A BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. 
GOUGH'S SPEECH. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I vim, now make a 
few remarks on demperance. I 
am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
gread demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whom I've 
ofden been daken for. 
Should I 
possess de eloquence of Gen-
eral Grant, I 
could give more scope to de subject I 
am now 
aboud to wrestle mit. 
Demperance is an old mid veil vorn subject, but like a 
Keno 
box ye can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
Id's very hard to approach a 
man vat aind a 
drinking; you're 
apt to be met with—" Who tole you I 
vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, mid 
mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball." 
Und oder veil-known expressions used by poli-
ticians. 
I 
vas called upon vonce to see vone of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to vitness. 
A 
man, who ven drunk vos de kindest of husbands ; but yen 
sober he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful 
brown curb- stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man vos dere. 
I 
said to him—" Viii you please give me a 
drink of vater 1"—( de firsd dime I 
ever dook vater in my life). 
He said—" Yes, sir; have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. 
I 
declined to sit, for various reasons. 
I 
spoke to him aboud 
1nfladion, Seven Oud, but I 
avoided the subjecd of demper-
ance. 
At last I 
said, " You have a 
vife, I 
believe'?" he replied, 
" 
Yes, sir, de fifth one ; red-headed." 
I 
said, " You love your 
vife, don't you 1" 
He said, " Veil, id's unnatural to love a 
vife 
now- a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you (link of you vould sign dis

paper, und go und get full vid me to- night, you could come 
home, get a 
club, und have a good deal of fun around de 
house ?" 
He said, " Yes ; I 
suppose so." 
I 
said, " You'll do 
id ?" 
He said, " I 
viii." I 
pulled oud a 
coby of " Good- Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his nose in de ink-
bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from anoder room—( full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot!"—de man said—" Come in mit 
me, Mr.Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vife vos lay-
ing on a 
bed, she vos dead—drunk; he knelt down und printed 
a 
kiss on her forehead in large type. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said—" Oh! Luke is such a 
good hus-
band yen lie's drunk, but ven sober, he's N. G !" ( de first time 
I 
ever knew she spoke Latin). 
De man said—" She says I'm 
good !"—at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he 
showed me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " Vere you vaccinated 
dere 7" 
His vife said, " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
lit-
tle hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry yen I 
came in dere, I 
assure you 
dey vere vet den, for I 
alvays carry de stuff mit me; but dis is 
only vone case oud of dwo hundred und fordy-dree und a 
half, 
were I 
have carried my good work; I 
intend to carry id all over 
de cidy, so dot ven I 
return I 
shall see a 
monumend erected to 
me, made oud of dot kind of marble dot looks like castile-soap. 
Of dere ivany bresent to-night dot would like to help me in me 
good vork, let dem come ub to de bar, und I 
shall be satisfied.

RATHER TOO 4‘ 
HEAVY " FOR ME. 
Words and Music ly JOSEPH P. 
SEELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
FE LL in love with a 
damsel sweet, 
And thought she was in love with me; 
I 
knelt in worship before her feet, 
All dressed in my Sunday clothes! 
She heard me thro' and then she grew 
Sympathetic and sad, said ' twas really too bad! 
" 
You know," she said " I'm a 
friend to you, 
But you must not thus propose." 
CHORUS. 
Oh! no, don't ask me I 
pray, 
I'm sorry, indeed, 
Believe what I 
say; 
Oh I 
dear, now, please go away, 
You're rather too " heavy" for me 
I 
still kept on and I 
hoped to see 
A change take place in her angel face, 
But she was ever the same to me, 
And I 
was her slave the while. 
At last I 
saw her walking out 
With another young man, then between them I 
ran, 
But he turned about, and gave an awful shout, 
While in vain I 
tried to smile. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and I 
trembled a 
little too when be said: 
" 
What's the matter with you, young fellow 1 Don't you make 
any common error." 
All I 
could say, was— 
Oh! no, don't, etc. 
Down town I 
met with a 
friend one night, 
For pleasure bound, we were all round; 
Says I, " I 
wish for a 
loan so slight, 
A 
ten dollar bill will do !" 
He looked at roe and smiled so queer 
While he vow'd his regret, said he had none " to let ;" 
" 
Do you take me, sir, for a 
Fusileer 1 
I 
must beg to be free from you!" 
Oh! no, don't, etc. 
One night I 
went to a 
dazzling ball, 
In the mazy whirl, with a 
lovely girl, 
I 
thought this pleasure the best of all, 
With music around my ears. 
9 
RATTY-FIR TOO " TTP‘AVY " FOR ME.—Concluded. 
When came the time, we went to sup, 
There was bright sparkling wine, and the table was fine, 
But 1 
thought my love would never get up, 
While I 
look'd I 
was fill'd with fears ! 
SPOKEN.—She had the most astonishing appetite of any girl 
I 
ever saw; and you should see how gracefully she drank off 
her champagne! 
Very charming indeed. 
I 
called on her a 
few days afterwards, and she wanted to know when we would 
go to another bath 
All I 
said in reply was— 
Oh ! PO, 
don't, etc. 
'TIS SAD TO BREATHE THE LAST ADIEU. 
Words by SAMUEL N. 
M ITCHELL. 
Music by GEORGE H ASTINGS. 
The Music of this song is published by JOHN Cnuncia & Co., 66 West 
Fourth St., Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 30 cents. 
'TB sad to breathe the last adieu, 
'Tis sadder still to part, 
And tho' the farewell kiss is sweet 
'Twill move the tender heart; 
The throbbing breast will feel the pain, 
The lips will lose their red, 
And oft the mind will wander back 
Where kindly words were said. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis sad to breathe the last adieu, 
'Tis sadder still to part, 
And tho' the farewell kiss is sweet 
'Twill touch the tender heart. 
'Tis sad to breathe the last adieu, 
'Tis sad to say " good-bye," 
For then a 
flush will tint the cheek, 
A 
teardrop dim the eye; 
The soothing voice will fail to speak, 
The tongue refuse to tell, 
While from the quivering lips there falls 
The solemn word " farewell." 
'Tis sad to breathe, etc. 
'Tis sad to breathe the last adieu 
To those we love so dear, 
And none can tell when it will come, 
Although it is ever near; 
In ev'ry borne and ev'ry clime 
There i a 
parting hour, 
And soon or late we'll say farewell 
To some sweet fading flower. 
'Tis sad to breathe, etc.

IT'S BILLIARDS ON THE BRAIN. 
Words by GRACE CARLETON. 
Music by A. CAnolt. 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. 
POND & CO 
, 
547 Broadway, 
New York. Pike 30 cents. 
OF 
all the pleasant games we play, 
What game can equal this ? 
We practise it by night and day, 
Its joys we never miss. 
Where'er we go, it is our lot 
To hear this one refrain : 
" 
Come in and play,"— the world has got 
This billiards on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
The balls go rolling round the table in this little game, 
It matters not which ball you hit, the count is all the same. 
We take our cues and chalk them up, and carom on the red, 
But very oft we make a 
scratch, and hit the white instead. 
The game of life resembles it,— 
We often make a " miss 
At other times we make a " hit," 
And frequently we " kiss." 
Some new beginner plays near by, 
lie lifts his cue again, 
And gently pokes you in the eye,— 
That's billiards on the brain! 
The balls go rolling, etc. 
Quite oft while lookinc, at a 
friend, 
Who makes a 
splendid " run," 
The game is drawing to an end,— 
You think it splendid fun. 
When suddenly, before you know, 
You feel a 
twinge of pain,— 
A 
hall comes bouncing on your toe,— 
That's billiards on the brain! 
The balls go rolling, etc. 
Young Jones be was as nice a 
man 
As ever you did see, 
And when the game he once began, 
lie counted splendidly. 
He played all night, and played all day, 
With all his might and main ; 
Alas! he died l—the people say, 
Of billiards on the brain ! 
The balls go rolling, etc.

IT'S BILLIARDS ON THE BRAIN.—Concluded. 
Words by GRACE CARLETON. 
Music by A. Cenom. 
LADIES' VERSION. 
Of all the horrid games I 
know, 
That one is hateful quite, 
To which the men in crowds will go, 
And play at day and night. 
I 
wonder what the charm can be, 
it must be great, that's plain, 
For young and old, it seems to me, 
Have billiards on the brain! 
The balls go rolling, etc. 
I 
had a 
beau, so nice and sweet, 
lie used to call each eve; 
And every time our eyes would meet 
his smiles I 
would receive ; 
But now he talks of 
shots" so fine, 
As if he were insane; 
I 
really think he does incline 
Towards billiards on the brain! 
The balls go rolling, etc. 
There's Mister Jones, who lives next door, 
He comes home very late, 
And vows lie couldn't come before, 
All owing to his state. 
His wife believes he's " at the store," 
Alas ! the case is plain,— 
It's only just one noodle more 
With billiards on the brain ! 
The balls go rolling ; etc 
Take my advice, young maidens, pray, 
When beaux have dista1,1 grown, 
And smell of " smoke" by night and day, 
And leave you sad and lone ; 
Just say, " to wed is not your plan," 
Nor bid them call again ; 
A (* iris a 
fool to wed a 
man 
With billiards on the brain! 
The balls go rolling, etc.

bear this in mind, Somebody's looking,1ove,pull down the blind. 
How loving we were! how cosy we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and fother, and this thing, and that; 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing, and teasing, and pleasing we had, 
Such wooing, and cooing, to make our hearts glad; 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad, 
But still she was awfully spooney on me: 
Spox-EN:—And if that Soldier would only hare left us alone, she would never 
have exclaimed :—CHonus, 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the Play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learn'd the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She call'd me her rose-bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine ? 
SpoKEN:—Just at that moment a 
Policeman passed and she said :— CRonts. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, and she calls me Ned; 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife, 
We've a 
fine, handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow ne'er us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful. I'm bless'd with a (rood little wife. 
SDNEEN:

meek smile an 
her lice she'll exclaim :—Cuunts.

YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT TO. 
Words and Music by GEORGE G.-Ft
-Aar. 
The Music of this song is published by E. 
H . 
H ARDING, 229 Bowery, Nem 
York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
I 
muster'd up my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss, 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this: 
CHORUS. 
You can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, 
To refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to be my better half thro' life I 
Her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, why, he quickly gave consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent" for his daughter's hand, heart, and so forth, and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection of course; you know " Galatea " hasn't 
any money—but as long as you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference—and as to marrying her, my dear boy, why 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid steps to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce believ'd my eyes and started with dismay, 
And as he whispered in her ear, I 
plainly heard her say— 
SPOKEN.—" Never mind, Charley; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it won't make any difference, I'll love you just the 
same as ever." 
jeems-es River! wasn't I 
mad—I 
told her she 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her—that I 
would 
not believe her even if she'd make a 
statement—and as for her 
" 
Charley," why, he could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
would leave, and she should never set eyes on me again—and 
" 
I 
hope I 
may never" if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see, 
Don't marry any girl, my boys, tho' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but. you, I 
guess you'll find I'm right, 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out of sight. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can do it, etc. 
UP, UP WITH COLUMBIA'S STANDARD. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER.

Price 10 cents. 
UP, up with Columbia's standard! 
Long, long may it brighten the sky! 
The hope of each heart in the nation, 
Beneath it we'll conquer or die ! 
We'll keep it with true hearts forever 
Unstain'd as the azure above; 
And wither'd the hand that would sever 
One star from the flag that we love! 
And wither'd the hand that would sever 
One star from the flag that we love! 
CHORUS. 
Then up with Columbia's standard ! 
God bless it where'er ' tis unfurl'd ! 
Up, up with Columbia's standard, 
The hope and the pride of the world! 
Up, up with Columbia's standard! 
On, on be its course evermore! 
It gives to the stranger a 
welcome, 
It guards ev'ry home on our shore; 
We pledge it with love and devotion, 
Our land that no tyranny mars ; 
And borne on the earth or the ocean, 
We'll strike for our banner of stars ! 
And borne on the earth or the ocean, 
We'll strike for our banner of stars ! 
Then up, etc. 
Up, up with Columbia's standard! 
Still, still may it wave in its might ! 
Fair freedom is smiling beneath it, 
Its watchword is Progress and Right; 
'Twas won ' mid the din of the battle, 
'Twas nurtur'd in sorrow and pain ; 
And now, when the cannon shal! rattle, 
'Twill lead us to vict'ry again ! 
And now, when the cannon shall rattle, 
'Twill lead us to vicery again! 
Then up. etc.

THE TALK OF THE TOWN. 
W ords and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. H ARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
WANDER thro' life like a 
gentleman's son, 
For fortune has favored me well, 
I'm blest with good temper and love to make fun, 
No matter with whom I 
may dwell; 
I've made many friends in my rambles about, 
And gained a 
good share of renown, 
'Till now I'm so famous within and without, 
It seems I'm the talk of the town. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the talk of the town, they say, 
Friends grow around me from day to day, 
Because I 
possess such a 
charming way, 
I'm really the talk of the town. 
Wherever I 
go it is always the same, 
I'm known just as soon as I'm seen, 
They point with their fingers and mention my name, 
While taking survey of my mien; 
I 
smile recognition, and say nothing more, 
Tho' sometimes they force me to frown, 
But I 
find it's no use to give praise or abuse, 
When I 
am the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
I'm known to the girls and I'm known to the boys, 
And legions of all human kind 
O'er- shadow my footsteps in sorrows or joys, 
And give me a 
piece of their mind; 
Some love me, some hate me, some say I'm a 
fraud, 
And many would fain crush me down. 
But such is the fate of the good and the great, 
It's because I'm the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
FEEDING THE D U CKS ON THE FARM. 
ITS just one year ago to- day 
Since I 
first fell in love 
With a 
charming little fellow, 
Who cabs me his turtle- dove ; 
He asked me if I'd take a 
walk, 
And offered me his arm, 
And said he would show me 
how to feed the ducks that's on the farm. 
CHORUS. 
Feeding the ducks on the farm quack! quack! 
Feeding the ducks on the farm, quack ! quack ! 
His style is so neat, and he looked so sweet, 
While feeding the ducks on the farm, quack! quack! 
He has asked me to become his wife— 
I 
don't know what to say ; 
He says I 
will make him happy 
If I 
will name the wedding day; 
I 
think that I 
shall answer yes ! 
And to his sorrow put an end, 
And when we move on the farm 
My assistance I 
can lend. 
While feeding, etc. 
THE ELECTRIC SOLDIER. 
I'M who they call the electric soldier, 
And no man can be any bolder, 
Eyes right, quick march, ah ! ah ! ah! 
When war's on, all my comrades say, 
I 
am the best to run away, 
Eyes right, quick march, ah! ah! ah! 
CHORUS. 
I'm the electric soldier, they call me artful Dan, 
Please say am I 
right, or any other man, 
Courting all the pretty girls, 
That's my heart's delight ; 
But as I 
don't want to be killed, 
I'd sooner run than fight. 
As I 
was out on guard one night 
The enemy came and caused a 
riot, 
Eyes right, shoulder arms, ah ! ah ! ah ! 
I 
seized my gun and yelled hurray, 
And like a 
shot I 
ran away, 
Eyes right, quick march, ah ! ah ! ah ! 
I 
am the, etc.

THE CENTENNIAL. 
By JOHNSON' and BRUNO. 
IT's now a 
hundred years ago 
Since freedom first did dawn, 
And many a 
thought comes o'er us 
As we hail the coming morn; 
So we'll make bold, the scenes unfold, 
The changes from that day, 
The battles won, the great things done, 
Since freedom gained the day. 
We'll tell you first of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe 
Who wished to tax the people 
That the tea did overthrow; 
lie nobly tried, and bravely died, 
He well the battle won, 
And Washington the finish gave 
To what he'd left undone. 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy- Six ! 
One hundred years since we did the tyrants fix! 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy- Six! (Repeat.) 
Then Jackson, with his cotton hales, 
lie made the red- coats fly ; 
Our banner, still triumphant, 
The invaders did defy ; 
And Lawrence fought, the lesson taught, 
Not to give up the ship; 
And Winfield Scott the foe he caught, 
As in the days of Seventy- Six.

To make sausages by steam.

How could you be so mean 
You vas sorry you invented 
Dat wonderful machine;

You grind dem up to sausage meat, 
By Dunderbeck's machine. 
De odder day a

Und vhile he vas a- standing dere

Dem sausages begin to dance 
And jump around der room.

To find dat out, you know ;

Unit went walking in her sleep, 
She gave that crank one awful yank, 
Und Dunderbeck vas meat.

She's just about as sweet, 
As any violet in the Spring, 
She's just like any nightingale, 
Whenever she may sing; 
She's like a 
little angel, 
Tho' she hasn't got the wings, 
In fact she's manufactured 
Out of all nice things! 
Cuo.—And I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne, 
I 
couldn't love another one like my Sai:ey Anne, 
Until boiling water freezes, or oysters 
up treeses 
I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
If a 
Princess were to come 
And say " she would be mine," 
I'd say - I'm very sorry marn, 
I 
really must decline." 
With a 
Princess I 
might live on 
Turtle soup, and Fricassees, 
Bnt I'd rather have my Sairey Anne, 
And humble bread and cheese. 
CI10.—No I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne, 
I 
couldn't love another one like my Sairey Anne, 
I'm a 
very chilly soul, there. I'd rather find the Pole, 
But I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
Her parent he's an old cross-grained, 
Cantankerous Kangaroo! 
He's often said he'll break my head, 
Which I 
don't want him to do; 
He won't let Sairey marry, till 
She reaches forty-five, 
So I'm bound to keep a " spinster," 
Until that time does arrive. 
CH0.—For 
never love another girl but my Sairey Anne, 
I'll never love another one but my Sairey Anne, 
I'd sooner commit Bigamy, or Trigamy, or thine--a-my, 
But never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
N. B. A 
fresh third line may be introduced to encore choruses, thus:— 
'I'd be a Cabby, " green" at dodges, and drive old Mother 
Prodgers."

About two blocks from here,

She veighed two hundred eighdy pound 
But den she vasn't—stout.

WAITING FOR THE DURP4. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAlts., 
On! I 
am a 
bad luck Dutchman, 
And I'd have you all to know, 
I 
arrived in town the other day, 
From the State of Ohio. 
I 
went me down to the Battery, 
A 
bully place I 
took to see the grand procession, 
That was waiting for the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, waiting for the Duke, 
I 
tell you bow they smashed my hat, 
My pocket- book some one took that, 
While waiting for the Duke, waiting for the Duke, 
0, gracious, how them fellows did go through me. 
I 
turn around and seized a 
man, 
Who said you Dutch gallout, 
Cheese it, Cully, swipes his nibs, 
He mashed me in the snout. 
A 
policeman he seized hold, and thus be rebuke, 
He took me to the station house, 
And I 
never seen the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, etc. 
Oh, when I 
found my watch was gone, 
I 
thought that I 
would drop; 
Although that a 
nice stout watch, 
With me it did not stop. 
Police I 
cried with all my might, 
But they no notice of me took; 
I 
found the police like all the rest, 
Was waiting for the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, etc.

In a 
gay dress of blue they enfold us ; 
We arrest all offenders of law, 
And the people are proud to behold us; 
We walk the streets all the long dark night, 
And we take good care to be far from a 
fight; 
Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world. 
CHORUS. 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world, 
We're the, ffeest we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world! 
We're the finest police in the world, 
And our praises are sung in the papers; 
When we find a

Very soon he is cur'd of his capers; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps no law is defied; 
The rogues all fear us on ev'ry side, 
We're the finest police in the world. 
We're thP finegt,. ete.

DOT LEETLE GROCERY STORE. 
PARODY ON " KISS BEHIND THE DOOR." 
ONCE I 
was so gay like a 
pigs as live in clover, 
But now into a 
bundle small you see I 
pine away; 
I 
once had plenty sweitzerkase und beer, but dot is over, 
I 
have to live on free lunches und eat one meal a 
day. 
SPOKEN -
I'll tole you how it vos. 
You see, I 
vos clerk in a 
green grocery store, und Joudy ( Joudy vos my gal) she come 
und buy couple a 
pounds of cheese shust because I 
vos dere; 
den I 
drow in two three pounds. I 
do goot business dot vay ; 
und yen de boss come along be say, " Who vos de money for 
dot cheese 7" und I 
say, " I 
expose dot vos all right." 
Jowly 
come in de morning when de boss have not got up yet, und I 
TOS sweeping oud the store. 
Den I 
shust hurry up, sweep de 
dirt behind de door, leave de broom dere, und make love mit 
Joudy; but— 
CHOETJS. 
I 
viii never sweep dot dirt again 
Behind de front shop door, 
I 
viii never leave my business, nein, 
To make love any more; 
I 
loose my situation in dot leetle grocery store, 
Und Joudy have gone back on me now. 
The boss he find some fault, so I 
gond und leave my places, 
lie make me pay for all dot cheese dot I 
have gave avay, 
Und yen I 
tell my Joudy she laffin' in my faces, 
Und ven I 
ask de reason vy, dese vords to me she say— 
SPOKEN.—" You great big grossen fool, why you have so 
much foolishness about dot you clink I 
cos going to marry you, 
ha ?" Den she sneeze at me (dot way), und tell me go ud. 
Well, 
I 
make my mind out, a 
rolling stone is as goot as two in the 
bush anyhow, and dere is not some use in crying for dot milk 
as got spilled on the ground, but I 
can't got me another situa-
tion. 
Well, I 
tole you de truth; you can accommendation by 
me, und if I 
give away two or three pounds of cheese, I 
viii 
take the price of dot cheese, for I 
have come to the exclusion

I 
viii never sweep, etc. 
MERELY A MATTER OF TIME. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
OF

viii sing you a 
song, 
Dot is, if I 
have your consent, 
Und yen I

hope you yin say 
Dot every vord is veil meant; 
Dey talk aboud building de East River Bridge, 
Und say—Yen it's done—' twill be fine; 
It viii be completed in vone hundred yea 
It's merely a 
matter of time. 
I've travelled on railvays a 
good deal of late, 
But strange to say I'm still alive, 
For a 
wonder, de engineers vere not drunk, 
Dere engines vere able to drive; 
But some day or oder veil have a 
crash, 
An accident on some big line; 
It viii come yen ye least expect of a 
smash— 
It's merely a 
matter of time. 
Dere vonce vos a 
time yen our stage drivers too 
Could make lots of money each day, 
But de companies soon put an end to their game, 
Dey saw dot it never vould pay; 
Dey've got a 
small box now inside of de stage, 
Vich keebs dem from stealing a 
dime; 
But de drivers viii find how to beat it again— 
It's merely a 
matter of time.

FISH. 
AREN'T we the b'yes that are ready for frolicking '1 
Marching along to the fife and the drum; 
Aren't we the jolly lads, jovial, rollicking, 
Shooting for prizes, and turkeys and rum, 
Lanagan, 
Branagan, 
Flanagan, 
Hannagan, 
Neve,r_a man but can fill up his can again. 
Ready to shoulder 
A 
musket, and bolder 
Than heroes of story and leaders of fame. 
Talk about Dollymount! 
'Tisn't the laste account— 
We are the chaps for eclipsing that same. 
0! what a 
sight when the maidens Hibernian 
Rush up the areas to welcome " the boys I" 
Lave to the classics your vintage Falernian, 
Whiskey's the stuff for exciting a 
noise. 
Drumming and 
Strumming, and 
Thrumming, and 
Bumming, and 
Shrieking of fifes tell the " sojers " are coming, and 
Molly and Bridget 
All git in a 
fidget, 
Lavin' the pots and the kitties alone. 
Acushla! don't mintion! 
Don't we git attintion 
As every Novimber has certainly shown. 
THE TARGETEERS.—Concluded. 
See how our captain—that's him wid a 
feather 
Handles his sabre, bedad! but it's foine; 
Stepping along in a 
huddle together, 
Drawn in a 
circular sort of a 
loine; 
Bold Billy Rooney 
For sergeant, 
And Cooney, 
Coporal Mooney and leftenant Luney; 
Flags to float o'er us, 
And judges before us, 
Goblets, and salvers, and big pewter castors; 
Bouquets and flowers, 
Ye'd think, by the powers, 
Aich soldier was born wid the wealth of the Astors. 
Then when at night we come back to our home again, 
Wid an uncertain step marching aloncr; 
Whist! as the shouts " here the bully boys 
me again," 
Rise from the throats of the juvenile throng; 
There's Tommy 
Radigan, 
Gone to the 
Bad again, 
Trying to hold up young Barney O'Bradigan; 
Soldiers Utopian, 
Black Ethiopian, 
Coming behind with the target we've rattled I 
0! but it's glorious, 
Slightly uproarious, 
Only to think of the whiskey we've battled.

UNCLE SAM he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they call'd upon Sam for a 
strain; 
So be put out his weed and he toss'd off his glass, 
And then he commenc'd this refrain : 
I'll sing of " our boys," who have made a 
great name, 
There's Captain Borgardns, said he; 
In Europe he show'd them how well he could shoot, 
his equal we seldom shall see. 
CHORUS. 
He's one of " our boys," he is ! 
We're proud of " our boys," we are; 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
lie's one of " our boys," hurrah! 
We've got a 
very good rifle team, 
They crossed the wide ocean you know ; 
They defeated the Dollyrnount marksmen with ease, 
And brought off the prizes I 
VOW; 
They've defeated since then the Canadian team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They are open to meet any marksmen on earth, 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to " our boys," they do; 
We are proud of such boys, we are ! 
They're honest and true, so we give them their due, 
They belong to " our boys," hurrah ! 
When old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And cri yen him up in despair ; 
It was one of " our boys," Jim Bennet, who said, 
" 
For ihe Doctor I'll now have a 
care." 
It was one of " our boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found ; 
All honor to Stanley. may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
CHOEUS . 
He's one of " our boys." he is,

That wake from out the past; 
I

Too beautiful, too beautiful to last, oh!

In childhood s 
simple, earliest pray'r ; 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all, and all the blessings there ; 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
Is nearer heav'n, is nearer heav'n for thee, oh ! 
The gray hairs, etc.

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
room.] 
OLD MAN (
sings). 
Every night, about half-past eight, 
Comes dat knocking at the garden gate; 
Can't you tell me now what it is, 
Rap, rap, rapping at de gate like this? 
OLD W OMAN (
sings). 
Dat's our own daughter Lisa's beau, 
When you was young you did just so; 
He comes a-courting her most every night, 
He calls her his blossom and heart's delight. 
BOTH. 
Every night, about about half-past eight, 
Comes dat knocking at the garden gate; 
Every night, &c. 
OLD MAN. 
When I 
ask her, she is so sly, 
Dat young fellow she will just deny; 
Have to keep her locked way up-stairs, 
If to see him now she ever dares. 
OLD W OMAN. 
Oh, you couldn't be so cruel, dear, 
Now you are old you act so queer; 
Why, he's a 
pleasant and a 
good young man, 
To wed pretty Lisa is just his plan. 
BOT11.--Every night, &c. 
OLD M AN. 
What! he marry my daughter, too ? 
Now, old woman, dat will never do I 
WHO'S DAT KNOCKIN' ?—[CompiNuEo.] 
OLD W OMAN. 
Would you have her an old maid be? 
All girls marry some one, why not she? 
OLD M AN. 
What you tell me, well it's maybe true, 
Girls will get married for all we do. 
OLD W OMAN. 
Don't you remember, long years ago, 
You were such a 
dashing and handsome beau , 
BOTIL—Every night, &c. 
OLD W OMAN. 
Now I'll go call up Lisa, dear, 
Tell her Charley, too, can come in hers. 
OLD M AN. 
Well, I 'spose you will have your way, 
Spite of every thing that I 
can say. 
[Exit OLD W OMAN, and changes quickly to LisA.] 
OLD M AN. 
Charley's good, that I 
know quite well, 
I'll let him call his love to tell; 
I 
was the same as he when I 
was young, 
I 
courted, and flattered, and songs I 
sung. 
Every night, Src. 
[Enter LISA.] 
OLD MAN. 
Now, I'll fool her, the sly- young fox. 
Lisa, tell me who it is that knocks, 
Always coming at half-past eight, 
Rap, rap, rapping at the outside gate. 
LISA. 
Really, father, it must be cats, 
Maybe it's mice, or maybe rats.

M Y VIFE IS SO AWFULLY THIN. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
The Music of this song is published by FREDERICK BLUME, 27 Union 
Square, New York. Price 35 cents. 
YOU'VE heard aboud a 
gal I 
lov'd, 
Dot used to be so stout; 
How she " shook me" und just because 
I 
would not take her out 
To balls und parties und all dot, 
Vich I 
clought was a 
sin ; 
But now I've got a new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS. 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; don't dot seem queer 
Bad luck have I—oh, I 
shall die; 
My wife is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair, 
She vos walking long mit her mamma, 
Und had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den; 
Ve married were, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKES — She is the thinnest of the thin; she used to work in 
an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes ; I used to play 
"Hide und Seek " mit her, und she used to hide in de gas 
pipe. 
1 
took her oud riding vonce, und I 
grabbed her instead 
of de whip; I 
never took her oud after dot. 
I 
vos waltzing 
mit her at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up und 
said, " Young man, you will have to leave your cane in de bat 
room, it's not allowed on de floor !" I 
told him ' twas no cane, 
but my wife. 
De oder day vile ye vos mid valking, I 
saw a 
man 
selling leetle red balloons for ten cends ; I 
bought vone, und 
give it to her to hold—she vent up, balloon mid all; I 
haven't 
seen her since, but 
She is so thin, etc.

MY VIFE IS SO AWFULLY STOUD. 
Snug by Gus W ILLIAMS with great success. 
AIR.—" My Vife is so Awfully Thin !" 
I 
VONCE did love a 
voman, dot used to be so stoud, 
Und people dey vould laugh at her venever she'd walk oud ; 
But sdill I 
loved her druly, I 
knew it vos no sin, 
I 
dought dot in de future she vould gradually grow thin. 
CHORUS. 
She vos so stoud, ven she'd walk oud, 
People vould clink dot see vos a 
balloon 
' 
To take dem up—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
She looked just like an elephant, she had such a 
big ear, 
But she could walk as lightly as any person here; 
To tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a-speaking, I 
hope you viii not cry. 
SPOKEN.—I
'll never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat woman, she 
weighed eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!' 
her right name vos " Ostrich." 
I 
took her oud sleigh- riding 
vonce, she got in, und dere vos just room for me to " cut on 
behind !" I 
looked like an icicle on a 
gutter. 
Ye drove out on 
de road, und stopped in front of a 
hotel, de proprietor came 
oud und told me to move avay, as no vone could see de hotel 
vile she stayed dere. 
I 
took her bathing vonce, de moment 
she got in de yater, de tide vent up dree foot, she asked me to 
float her, I 
tried to, but came near drowning ; I 
told her I 
vos 
no derrick! 
But she could dance like a 
fairy, dot is, a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, ill waltzing, to put my arm around her waist 
as far as I 
could, und reach mit a 
boat-hook de rest of de dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
water-melon 
just as easy as I 
vould take a 
pill. 
I 
took de size of her finger 
vonce to have an engagement ring made, I 
vent down to the 
jeweller. I 
said " Make me a 
lino- dis size, und I 
want it to fit 
veil ;" he said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it on." 
I 
don't speak to her now, because she wanted me to take her 
to a 
masquerade ball disguised as a 
pipe- stem. I 
knew dot 
every vone would laugh at me I 
if done so, for 
She vos so stoud, etc.

When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry 
SPOKEN.—HC declared I 
was hurting , is Mamma, and would 
inaist upon sitt;ey

Cno.—Tommy, make room tor your Uncle, Ltc. 
3 
The mother told her loving son 
To watch the passing train, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front ot that young Elf?

then we went under a

In a 
cnu g 
retreat at Rosherville, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sir,hed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how abont the child ?" 
And clasped him fondly to her breast,

TOMMY, MAKE ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
A111.-" Tommy, Make Room for Your linele." 
A5 sung by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
Anil you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A 
widower fell in love with me 
While riding in a 
train ; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me a 
great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CHORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here ; 
You know papa has got a 
cake, 
And that bell give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
"Tsv as on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN.—He declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us ; only fancy making love to a 
girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
so sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again ; 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
In front of that young elf? 
SPDXEN,—Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
—not before the boy "— just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc.

Written and sting by Gus WimaAms.

You don't see each day in de veek, 
Und of you viii give your attention, 
A few vords I'm going to speak; 
De oder day I

Und he vos a-drinking some beer— 
If de beer vos a- drinking de Dutchman,

I

Dey were building a

HOW DEAR TO ME THE HOUR. 
By Thomas MOORE. 
How dear to me the hour when daylight dies, 
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea; 
For then sweet dreams of other days arise, 
And menfry breathes her vesper sigh to thee. 
And, as I 
watch the line of light that plays 
Along the smooth wave tow'rd the burning west, 
I 
long to tread that golden path of rays, 
And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rest.

JOHN. — Well, well, a8 I 
live it's my old friend and crony, Joe! 
well, well. 
JOE. — 
Is that you, John? Why it can't be that you are in

long while since we've met, and 
we're both very near to the bottom of the hill, hey, John ? 
Jonx.—Aye, aye: but barrin' a 
little hit of rheumatiz, these 
old legs of mine are good for many a 
mile yet. 
JoE. —Yes. yes; why, we're as good as the best of 'em: al-
though the snow is falling on our heads, there's plenty of 
warmth beneath. 
Ha! ha! 
Jomz.—And then what good old times we've had. hey, Joe ? 
Do you remember the rosy-cheeked girls we've kissed in our 
youth ? 
JOE. — Do I? 
Shall I 
ever forget 'era ? 
JOHN. —And the jolly meeting with our companions!

Jons. -And the picnics!

Joas.—Ha! ha! 
ha!

Our friendship has been true, 
In all the weal and woe of life, 
No change that friendship knew. 
We've miss'd some lov'd ones, one by one, 
And twin'd our wreaths of heather, 
In fancy as we've deck'd their tombs, 
Since we were boys together. 
Both. 
Since we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
Since we were boys together, 
Unalter'd is our friendship, Joe. ( or John.) 
Since we were boys together. 
Joe.— I 
need not bid thee ponder, John, 
You know our prime is o'er: 
The flow -r, the nest, the humming-bee, 
For us will charm no more. 
And our frail forms are fading fast, 
We could not bound the bother, 
As hand in hand with gladsome brows, 
We did when boys together. 
Both. 
When we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
When we were boys together, 
Through many sunny years, friend John, ( or Joe.) 
May we yet live together.

CENTENNIAL SONG. 
ORIGINAL. 
Written and sung by BEN MACHNLEY. 
Ant.—" Ten Thousand Miles Away." 
W HAT a 
great and glorious land this is, 
And how we've walked along 
Since a 
hundred years ago to- day, 
When we sang that good old song 
Of Yankee Doodle, right side up, 
And felt ourselves 0 K—ay—ay— ay, 
When Johnny Bull skedaddled home, 
Ten thousand miles away ? 
CHORUS. 
Then blow ye winds, heigho, 
And a 
roaming I 
will go; 
I'll stay no more on my native shore, 
But let the music play—ay—ay, 
I'm off by the morning train, 
To see my love again— 
I'm.off to my love, with a 
boxing- glove, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Since a 
hundred years ago, my boys, 
The ladies, bless their souls, 
Are wearing striped stockings now, 
And look like barber-poles! 
And they get their lovely pull- backs on, 
And don't they look so gay—ay—ay; 
Then they look like swells in tight-legged pants, 
From ten thousand miles away. 
Then blow, etc. 
Next summer when the circus comes 
We'll have a 
new show here; 
For Theodore Tilton is engaged 
To walk upon his ear; 
We'll have Bristow doing a 
bare- back act, 
And all dressed up so gay— ay—ay, 
And Beecher'll dance the can- can, 
From ten thousand miles away. 
Then blow, etc. 
But lay all follies by, my friends, 
Great wonders we have done, 
And may America still grow great 
For a 
thousand years to come; 
So, I'll bid you all good-bye, my friends, 
I 
got a 
brand new job to-day—ay— ay, 
To go chewing glue in Kalamazoo,

The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid; 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the reason why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her back was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !— Cllo. 
3 
Another one to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows and ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, but fell in a 
decline, 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !— Cno. 
4 
Then another one came, ah, a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange peel, 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck.-- Cno. 
5 I 
could add to the score full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a. long way round; 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or drowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was my dismay to discover that one day, 
She'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper. 
Cno.

THE DAY WHEN YOU'LL FORGET ME. 
Words by "M ORGAN."

The Music of this song is published by C. II DITSON & 
Co., 711 Broadway, 
New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
f 
Von call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev .ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me ; 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'rincr heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush ! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chitlings do not fret me ; 
Ah ! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The (lay when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

STILL I LOVE THEE. 
Words and Music by C. T. LOCKWOOD. 
The Music of this song is published by S. %Ammo's Sorts, Cleveland, 
Ohio. 
Price 40 cents. 
W HAT should make thee sad, my darling ? 
Why those pearly tears I 
see 7 
Have I 
caused one thought of sorrow 7 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
By the stars that shine above us, 
By their wondrous mystery, 
By this heart that beats within me, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
CHORD'S. 
What should make thee sad, my darling 1 
Why those pearly tears I 
see, 
Have I 
caused one thought of sorrow 7 
Have I 
not been kind to thee 7 
O'er the bosom of the ocean 
Shall the sea- bird cease to rove, 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E'er my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, etc. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest 
Be my heart thy throne forever, 
Let all tears forgotten be, 
Weal or woe estrange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, etc.

We oftentimes go courting in a 
quiet country lane, 
To offend her I'd disdain, 
Her love I 
hope to gain, 
For I 
love her, yes, I 
love her, 
And I'll never cause her pain 
If she'll be true to me. 
She's the apple of my eye, 
I 
love her like pie, 
I've courted her for many a 
weary day; 
I 
asked her to be mine, 
No longer could I 
pine, 
She looked, an I 
laughed, and then to me did say- Cho. 
Her father, that's the old man, is very fond of me; 
We're soon to married be, 
And then there'll be a 
spree! 
If fortune should hut favor her 
With children for her knee, 
flow nice to be a 
pa! 
Thus happy night and day 
The time will pass away, 
With the little ones I'll play while round they cling, 
And thus so blithe and gay, 
We'll bask in love's sweet ray, 
When seated round the fire she can sing-Cho.

EILLEEN ALLANNA. 
EILLEEN ALLANNA, Eilleen Asthore, 
Light of my soul and its Queen evermore. 
It seems years have lingered since last we did part, 
Eilleen Allanna, the pride of my heart. 
Oh! darling loy'd one; your dear smile I 
miss, 
My lips seem to cling to that sweet parting kiss, 
Aiavourneen, thy dear face I 
see at the door, 
Eilleen Allanna, Augus Asthore, 
Eilleen Allauna, Angus Asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Faithful I'll be to the colleen I 
adore, 
Eilleen Allanna, Augus Asthore. 
Eilleen Allanna, Eilleen Asthore, 
The ocean's blue waters wash by the shore 
Of that dear land of shamrock where thou dost abide, 
Waiting the day when I'll call thee my bride. 
God bless you, darling, I 
know you are true, 
True to the boy who would die now for you. 
My heart is now bleeding to its innermost core, 
Eilleen Allanna, Augus Asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Soon I'll be back to the colleen t 
adore; 
Eilleen Allanna, Augus Asthore. 
" 
NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU," 
SWEETLY the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn; 
Sad is the moon, tho' in radiance beaming, 
She's dreaming alone and forlorn; 
Roses wid lilies so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew, 
So when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaminff of you! 
CHORUS. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me if still you are true! 
Dream of me, darling., for one moment only, 
While Norah, your Norah is dreaming of you! 
Tho' you forget me when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own ! 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I (
vas your darling alone! 
Come to my heart like a 
bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so true! 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am waiting, etc.
