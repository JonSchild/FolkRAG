Kira Fobbs Interview Index 
00:00:01 May 4, 2014, Mark Wagler talking to Kira Fobbs in Madison, Wisconsin. Born 
November, 1963 in Champaign, Illinois. Kira has many ethnicities; she is half Black and half 
White. White includes half Swedish and half German-Jewish. Don’t know much about the Black 
half because of course their culture and identity were taken away from them when they were 
brought to this country against their will. A lot of her family came from the Fort Worth area of 
Texas, and has some family in Kentucky. Her undergraduate degree is a B.A. in Political Science 
with certification in theater technology and a minor in Women’s Studies. Has an independent 
Master of the Arts in Political Anthropology, specializing in systems of power. Has a Master of 
Science in Curriculum and Instruction, with a focus in multicultural education. Her teaching 
license is 1st-6th grade. Her first position was at Thoreau Elementary School, as a 4/5 multi-level 
teacher, for 3 years. Then went back to Lincoln School, where she did all of her pre-service 
teaching, in a specialized program called the Teach for Diversity program. Taught at Lincoln for 
12 years, 3rd, 4th and 5th grade, primarily 4th grade. Lincoln is a 3-5 school. She was asked to 
come to Falk Elementary because it is struggling, has a big achievement gap between African-
American and European-American students. Her former cooperating teacher/mentor Andrel 
Davis asked her to come there with her teaching partner Kim O’Donohue to try to implement 
some new programming there to alleviate the achievement gap—that was five years ago, have 
had good success with that. 
00:04:04 During the summer, she teaches at the People Program at the University of Wisconsin, 
and teaches ACT prep and study skills, working a lot with her former students who have gotten 
into that program, middle and high school students. Kira loves the People Program, it recharges 
her for the school year. While she was working on her Masters in Political Anthropology, she 
taught in Europe in a Comparative Women’s Studies Program in 1991-92. 
00:05:12 Kira spent most of her college career studying to be a lawyer, when she got to the point 
of law school, she realized her goal was to help change the world, bring about justice and 
education and liberty for others. Her mom always accused her of wanting to be Martin Luther 
King. She always wanted to eliminate racism, sexism, homophobia. But when she got to law 
school phase, she realized that lawyers don’t have a lot of impetus for that. She fell back on what 
she learned as a political scientist, especially from Machiavelli: that if you want to assimilate a 
group of people to a new culture, you have to occupy the minds of the children. So, she figured 
that if she wanted to have that kind of effect, she would have to become a teacher. If she wanted 
to change what our culture was, she had to change the kids. 
00:08:05 Kira’s life as a teacher: her typical day starts at 5 a.m. She teaches at an early start 
school, so they are required to be in the building by 7:30. She lives across town from where she 
teaches, so she has to get up early to be there on time, especially in the winter. She leaves the 
house at 6:30, gets to school about 7 or 7:10, then gets prepared for morning meeting, which is 
how they like to start the day—talking to each other, having a focus such as reviewing what they 
did the day before or previewing what they will do that day. That is about 20 minutes. This year 
they started a community breakfast program at Falk, which Kira really likes. She gets to sit and 
have breakfast with the kids, see how they are doing, get a quick check-in on their moods. She 
works with students with special needs, so she can use breakfast to make sure they’re in the right

frame of mind for the day. That is from 7:45 to 8 a.m. Then have official morning meeting, 
official start for day. Right now, she is getting ready for high stakes assessment, Measure of 
Academic Progress, the MAP test. She is a little nervous about it; they made so much progress 
from fall to winter, she is afraid they won’t make as much progress from winter to spring. She 
has a really good group of kids, and she spends a lot of time trying to help the kids find their 
passion about what they want to learn. She has used this idea throughout her career, having kids 
direct their own education. She has certain standards they have to follow, like everyone else, but 
Kira finds that she can teach those standards through independent research projects. Sometimes 
that is through a formal setting that they call “Great Blue” but most of the time it’s an informal 
setting where kids are doing learning contracts where they are learning things they want to learn 
about, and Kira uses that as a format to teach the specific standards. She has a student teacher, is 
giving her a lot of leeway to do what she wants. School gets out at 2:32, so they are officially in 
school from 7:45 to 2:32.  
 
00:11:55 Kira also the coordinator for the math program for the academic afterschool program, 
so after her students leave, she gets set up for the ACE program, setting out activities for 
approximately 60 kids after school. That takes her to 4:30 or 4:45. Then, she can go home, after 
she has made sure that she is ready for whatever is going on the next day. She learned that from 
her cooperating teacher, Andrel Davis, you don’t leave until you are ready for the next day, and 
you always have a Plan B, C, D and E. So, that’s a typical day. 
 
00:13:00 Kira’s classroom has been designated a CLR classroom, Culturally and Linguistically 
Responsive classroom. It’s the focus of everything she does in the class—anti-racism and closing 
the achievement gap. Her class is primarily African-American. She has 3 Hispanic students, 3 
Caucasian students, and the rest are African-American out of a total of 18 students. She spends a 
lot of time finding out what is motivating to them; that’s very different from the standard 
American canon of teaching. It is a very student-centered pedagogy. She looks at students’ lives 
and uses that to craft something that is engaging for them, based on their needs. It is very 
responsive—that is the new term used in teaching. It’s a delicate balance between what the state 
and the nation say she has to teach and what the kids are going to respond to. Kira’s deepest hope 
for her students is that they go to college and graduate. On a daily basis, she says ‘how is this 
going to help you get to college, how is this going to help you stay in college?’ She is very 
hands-on, kinesthetic, so students do interesting projects. For example, three students are 
currently making a documentary about their dance crew. Another student is making an anti-
bullying movie. Other students are studying families all over the world, others studying the 
predation habits of wolves—all kinds of things going on, based on what they are interested in 
today and in the future. It’s all geared toward what will get them in college and give them the 
skills to stay in college. 
 
00:16:40 It is challenging to keep all these varied projects going at the same time. It is very time- 
and energy-consuming. But Kira has a few built-in routines that allow her to meet separately 
with her students. They have a period of time each day when they are doing these inquiries, that 
is aside from reading groups, mini-lessons on writing techniques, etc. She sets aside a period of 
time each day just for checking in with students and helping them get materials they need. But 
mostly it’s just facilitating, giving them the space to do the work. Because they are so interested, 
they are doing most of the work on their own. For Kira, the question is how do they harness what 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

they are learning, how do they coordinate it and put it in a way that is going to be presentable for 
other others and a published journal in the future. Because Kira’s students are so interested in 
what they are doing, they don’t get off-task a lot, at least not during the period when they are 
working on inquiry. She has more trouble keeping them focused when they are studying math 
then when doing individual projects. In math, they tend to space out, have side conversations, not 
pay attention to the lessons. Individual projects show them they can have agency, some control 
over their lives, and can do a good job at it, and helps show them what their future can be. 
 
00:19:20 Kira thinks it is really important to know what’s going on in your students’ lives. At 
Falk, they recently scored highest in the nation for 5th grade student well-being, feeling like they 
belong in their school. They spend a lot of time getting to know their kids and what they are 
doing outside of school. Kira participates in all kinds of activities outside of school; she goes to 
Hmong celebrations such as Hmong New Year, even though she doesn’t currently have any 
Hmong students. She keeps in touch with former Hmong students. She goes to basketball, 
football, volleyball, soccer games. She just saw a game where two of her students played on 
opposite sides. It makes the kids feel that she has an interest in them, and develops a relationship 
with them, which allows her to do what she does in the classroom, outside standardized 
curriculum. She shops in the stores in the neighborhood and walks the neighborhood regularly. If 
she has any problems with students, she walks them home after school because she wants the 
parents to know that she is involved in their lives and is willing to go the extra mile to be sure 
they are going on the right track. With the new Common Core state standards, one of the 
emphases is Collaborative Conversations, and Kira finds that being involved in students’ lives 
helps them bridge to each other, especially when it comes to the constructivist idea that no one 
comes into the classroom with an empty slate, but with full knowledge of ‘who I am’ and ‘where 
I come from’ with recognition that every student brings many things into the school, even if only 
10 or 11, the student has a whole range of experiences from her life that affects and flavors 
everything she does. Kira’s involvement in their lives lets them feel more that they are valuable 
people, that they are agents in their own lives. In her class, they have collaborative conversation 
every day, because in her practice, students construct their knowledge through talking with each 
other and with Kira, by reading deeply and talking about what they have read. Because Kira 
knows them well, she can choose books that are more engaging for them, and resources that are 
more effective. 
 
00:23:45 A good example: most of her students are African-American, and some she has had for 
four years, from 2nd grade to 5th grade, and even had a relationship with some before 2nd grade 
because she worked closely with the 1st grade teacher. She knows them so well that she knows 
what they need. She found a program last year, Flocabulary.com, which takes really high 
academic vocabulary and puts it in the form of rap and has exercises that go deeper with the 
vocabulary. This program has been amazing for her students; they have learned over 360 words 
this year and the year isn’t over yet.  
 
00:25:15 They also spend time studying their local environment. They have two gardens, a new 
one they just put in during the fall that spells out the word “Falk.” Just off the school grounds is 
the community garden, they have a school plot in that garden. They take regular trips into the 
neighborhood. Just did a lot of work in April for Earth Day, did a lot of neighborhood 
activities—cleaning up, planting trees. They have a native plant area about three blocks away, 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

and they spend a lot of time documenting there. They also go to the Arboretum and do case 
studies there. They emphasize that the earth is not an unlimited resource, so it has to be taken 
care of.  Kira and her students are always looking at different occupations. For example, 
Flocabulary.com has “The Week in Rap,” basically all the news of that week put into rap form, 
and the class spends a lot of time talking about those issues. Last week they talked about a NBA 
owner and his racist comments, and the repercussions for his behavior. They talk a lot about 
what’s going on in the world and how they will participate in that later. They talk about union 
rights, and how big changes in the country have come from younger people.  
 
00:29:25 Working with adults is harder than working with children. “You know, teaching is a 
strange profession. I think people have the impression that teachers are all working together and 
they are all the same. But the fact is that in America, teaching is very individualistic. In fact, 
collaboration between teachers is something that is odd and different, it is not the norm. I have 
had the wonderful experience of working in a school where collaboration was the norm. It was 
kind of forced on us, but it was a good forcing of something on us. And then, I moved to another 
school and it was the opposite. And, we were trying to bring that to the school because we 
believed that’s a positive influence on changing the achievement gap in particular. And, working 
with other adults is extremely challenging, especially if they are reluctant to work with you.” 
Kira has had several teachers she has worked with who have been very important, and she 
couldn’t do her job without them—that’s a small number of teachers. The greater circle she 
works with can be very challenging, mostly because of racism. “My experience is that I am seen 
as a person of color before I am seen as a teacher. And so when I say something—especially if I 
say something with authority—and I believe I have authority, because, number one, I am of this 
color and I think I know how I experience life; but I also have several degrees that are 
specifically addressing the issues. When I speak with authority to other teachers, they get very 
very defensive. And, it makes it a lot harder to focus on the students if they are feeling like I am 
trying to, I think a lot of people think I am trying to force them to do something, but it’s really 
just a guilt-reaction, that when I bring things up and they haven’t thought about how they’re 
treating their students, they feel guilty and then psychologically they lash out because they feel 
guilty. There’s not a lot I can do about that, but it does hurt after awhile.” In her current position, 
she has had people put anonymous insulting notes in her mailbox; they’ve been trying to 
undermine what a small group of teachers have been trying to do for the last five years to affect 
the achievement gap. You have to find teachers who have the same values and goals that you 
have. Schools are like anything else in this country; they have their own cultures, and those 
cultures can be very dysfunctional. 
 
00:33:40 The school Kira is at right now has some activities to help staff get to know each other, 
such as the standard holiday party. This year, it was at a bar/restaurant where you had to pay $25 
to participate. Kira didn’t participate, because to spend $25 to sit in a room with people who 
don’t really care about what she thinks doesn’t make sense to her. In previous schools, they used 
to do lots of things to build their relationships as teachers. They used to have fabulous “mystery 
tours” where they would go all over town on a scavenger hunt, and eventually end up someplace. 
They used to go bowling. She worked on one team at Lincoln, the 4th grade team, that was 
together for 7 or 8 years and they did a lot of things together to keep their relationship up. But 
that was in the context where they knew they were going to be collaborating closely, and the 
school would give them half a day off to plan and organize every quarter; they were very 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
4
dedicated to developing that relationship. So that team would go on bar crawls, play laser tag, go 
bowling—that 4th grade team was very cohesive because of the expectation from the 
administration that they were going to be collaborative, and to be collaborative they had to be 
social; they had to know each other well. Knowing each other well contributed to conversations 
about race, all the time. When Kira taught at Lincoln, they were almost in quarters—a quarter 
Hispanic, a quarter Caucasian, a quarter Asian, and a quarter African American. It was very 
diverse, more than Falk is, since Falk is 58% African American, and the rest is a mix of Asian, 
Hispanic and Caucasian. 
 
00:36:55 At Lincoln, they talked about their classes all the time. They talked about issues that 
came up and were very aware that some things worked and others didn’t. They tried different 
things. The 4th grade team tried switching students, so if someone was working on a particular 
issue like in math or reading, they would exchange students on a regular basis, to meet the needs 
of the students. It was a model that encouraged teachers to talk about the issues that were 
affecting their students in a very pragmatic way. Sometimes they had difficult conversations 
about race; Kira has almost always been the only African American teacher in any setting she 
has been in. “And so, you have to get to a certain level of trust with each other before you can 
hear some of those things.” If you have a class that is primarily African American, and Hispanic 
and Hmong, doing Norwegian folk tales might not be the most engaging thing to work on. So, 
suggesting that maybe they could do family stories in general, because the teacher is leaving out 
an entire segment of students…but to be able to say those things, you have to have trust, and a 
relationship. That was the best part of the collaboration design. At that time, the principal was 
Carolyn Stanford Taylor, and she brought in experts to work with the teachers to create 
collaborative teams. They’d go off site half a day each quarter to work on planning but also to 
work on relationships. “I don’t think anybody in the district is doing anything like that any 
more.” 
 
00:39:40 How do teachers get to a place where they are comfortable talking about race? “My 
personal opinion is that you have to recognize that you are a racist. I’ve been in many situations 
where I’ve said, ‘I’m a racist.’ I’m a racist by virtue of the fact that I was raised in a racist 
society. So there are many things that I have to challenge myself about all the time. But it’s 
difficult, especially for white teachers, to admit that they are racist because they feel that they 
have become teachers with these great intentions. But that’s a very superficial level of 
understanding of racism. In order to be truly open to that, you have to look much deeper, you 
have to be able to see who you are as a teacher and what your core beliefs are. And we teachers, 
we don’t often talk about our core beliefs.”  Teachers in general are superficial in their 
relationships with each other. You might be close to a few, like your teaching partner, but 
walking down the hall, smiling and saying ‘hi’ is about where most relationships stop. It takes a 
lot to look deeply at your core beliefs and see that they might be racist—it takes a lot to examine 
those beliefs and recognize that you might not be happy with what you find.  
 
00:41:40 How do issues of race affect the feeling of cohesiveness of being a professional group? 
Kira feels that the onus is on her, to put herself in that professional atmosphere, because she has 
to adopt the culture of power in order to be in the profession. So, the onus is on her to make the 
first steps. Her current school is in flux right now; have had issues but are becoming more 
cohesive through very dedicated professional development that is focused on culturally and 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

linguistically responsive teaching, for the last three years. Kira has seen a difference in the staff 
because other experts are coming into the school and talking about the issues, and it isn’t Kira 
talking about them, so the staff is more open to the issues. Kira has seen teachers start to question 
themselves and look at how they are interacting with their students. And she has also seen 
teachers leave the school because they are not willing to question themselves. That has happened 
a lot; maybe 16 or 17 teachers have left in the last three years. The principal has made it clear, 
that this is the population they are serving, and so if a teacher doesn’t find it a good fit, the 
principal will do anything in her power to find a better fit. 
 
00:44:30 Describe working with other adults besides teachers in the school—other teachers in 
the district, adult volunteers, etc. Kira says there are a few volunteers who come to the school 
every day. They are lucky at Falk because they have a very diverse PTO. They have co-
presidents, one African American and one white; both are in the building every day. One of the 
former presidents, who is African American, now works in the building “because she was in the 
building so much we just had to give her a job, because she knew every kid, she knew every 
kid’s parents. She has become the positive behavior specialist for our kids because she has got 
that relationship with all our kids.” And there are several parents who sat on the interviewing 
committee, since their principal has resigned and they are looking at new candidates. Kira has 
had several relationships with doctoral students from University of Wisconsin who have come in 
to her classroom to do research on democratic teaching practices, and cultural 
responsiveness/cultural relevancies pedagogies. Has done several literacy projects with Cathy 
Compton Lilly who is a famous researcher in reading and literacy. Have done work with the UW 
Extension, working with them on their gardens and native plant area. Also Falk is a partner 
school, partner with Mendota; exchange teachers and do professional development together. Kira 
just did an instructional cycle with a teacher where they go and observe each other’s classrooms. 
Have several community partners at Falk, such as Attic Angels, CUNA Credit Union, and 
recently Big Lots, provide money for field trips. Last year came in and made winter hats for all 
the kids. 
 
00:48:55 What stories do staff tell each other? “The profession of teaching is a lot like being a 
police officer. It is a lifestyle, it’s not a career, it’s something that is all encompassing of your 
life. Whenever there are more than two teachers together, they are talking about teaching. It 
doesn’t matter where you are.”  Kira just had that experience last night at a birthday party; 
eventually they all just talked about school. When teachers get together, they try to be social, but 
they end up talking about teaching. They talk about challenges, successes, interesting projects 
they’ve come up with, how many days are left in the school year. Recently they have been 
talking about how bad it is to have a late spring break, which is hard on the kids and the teachers. 
Teachers always talk about kids, sometimes funny stories, sometimes frustrating; sometimes they 
will talk about something an innocent child says that is really hilarious to an adult. Or spelling 
errors that turn into something very adult. Kira doesn’t have any close friends who are not 
teachers, with the exception of her spouse. Even her mother is a teacher, still teaching GED and 
substituting, at the age of 70. So, the stories Kira tells out of school are like the stories she tells in 
school. 
 
00:53:10 How has teaching changed? It has gotten much deeper, much more cognitively based. 
When Kira first started teaching, they didn’t have the standards and benchmarks that provided 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
6
them a national curriculum. But in the process of trying to do more with less, teachers have had 
to become much deeper in how they think about teaching. The activities that they do nowadays 
always serve more than one purpose. Kira might do a “close reading” activity, but it is also 
meant to work on 4 or 5 different areas that the kids need. Teachers integrate much more to make 
the work more engaging and meaningful to kids. Have to find ways to make fractions meaningful 
to kids. Recently, Kira did a web-based fraction story loop, where one chapter led to another 
chapter, and you had to solve problems along the way, like a scavenger hunt. Teachers do a lot 
more constructivist stuff, where kids are talking and creating their own understanding of what 
they are being taught. Kira thinks about the zone of proximal development, where you work just 
at the edge of where they are, and push them past that edge so that they are constantly growing 
and building up their capacity. Also a lot of negative changes, like the high stakes tests that serve 
no purpose whatsoever except to make kids feel bad about themselves. Now the tests are taken 
three times a year. They take away from actual instructional time, and can negatively affect kids’ 
self esteem. None of the tests are created by teachers. Teachers who are constructivists like Kira 
know that those tests don’t really tell you anything, except what a kid remembers at a particular 
moment under pressure on that day. If Kira sits down with a kid and does an interactive activity 
with him, that tells her a lot more about what they are capable of doing, what they know, how 
they process, and where to take them next—more than any multiple choice test could ever do. So 
testing has been very detrimental to teaching. 
 
00:57:30 What does good teaching look like? Good teaching is student-centered. If Kira sees her 
students engaging in collaborative discussion about something they are interested in, she believes 
that is good teaching. That is what she tries to instill in her student teachers. A lot of older people 
have this image of school as a quiet, orderly place, but Kira’s experience of teaching is that it is 
loud. It’s chattery, active, kinetic. If they are enjoying what they are doing and engaged, that’s 
good, because that is what most of their lives are going to be like. “We don’t go into a job and sit 
in a row and don’t talk to other people, unless…I don’t know, there are probably some jobs 
where you have to do that, but the most productive careers, the most productive forms of 
employment are kinetic, they’re not static or stationary, they’re not quiet.” Kira thinks there is a 
perception out there that anyone can teach…anyone can hand out the assignment sheet or test, or 
keep discipline. She thinks it is a big load of hooey.  That’s one reason the common core 
standards and tests are the way they are, they weren’t created by teachers. No teacher would do 
that. No teacher would say that those standards and testing are an example of good teaching. Kira 
wishes that the people who create these tests, and the textbooks and the standards would come sit 
in a classroom and try to be a teacher for a while, because it is one of the toughest jobs there is. 
 
01:00:30 Over the last ten years, Kira has been working to develop certain capacities in teaching. 
Because she has been focusing on culturally and linguistically responsive teaching, those 
pedagogies, methods of teaching, are very different from what we are taught in college to teach. 
So, over the past ten years, she has worked to manage gradual release of responsibility and 
manage an engaging classroom where the kids are collaborating and she is a facilitator rather 
than a disseminator of information. That takes a lot, it’s a big paradigm shift in teaching. Instead 
of filling their little heads with stuff, she is giving them the opportunity to fill themselves, very 
different from what we were taught in college. She has read a lot of books to help her understand 
her kids more, and understand what the next step is. Especially in math. As an elementary school 
teacher, she teaches all subjects and when Kira was a child, math was very difficult for her. It got 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
7
a lot better when she got to college because she was learning how to teach math. She found she 
didn’t understand the developmental steps of math, the way that we are taught the developmental 
steps of reading. She has spent a lot of time in the last five years learning those developmental 
steps, and what foundation the students have to have in order to move forward, especially to 
advanced math like algebra 1 and 2, calculus, trigonometry.  
 
01:02:20 Kira has been active in the teachers’ union. She is on the board of directors of her 
union. Good unions absolutely improve student learning. For example, if Kira as a teacher 
worried about her administration coming into her classroom and making false evaluations of her, 
she can’t focus on her job. That happened this year, where several district administrators came to 
Falk into the classroom, saying that their observations were not evaluations, but keeping 
permanent records of what the teachers were doing. In the back of her mind, Kira has wondered 
if what they recorded was going to be used against her in some way. She was clandestinely 
videotaped this year by an administrator. It was very disturbing to her. She went to the union 
board and described her concern, and the director said that unless videotaping teachers had been 
agreed to as a specific item in the contract, it was a violation of the contract. Thus, Kira knew she 
didn’t have to worry about it anymore, because the union would work to uphold the terms of her 
contract. So, she could focus on her job again. Kira thinks she was targeted to be videotaped 
because of her outspokenness. It started last year; for the last couple of years, in the school 
district, the community, the teachers, the union and the administration spent thousands of dollars 
and many hours coming up with a very intense plan to reduce the achievement gap, because 
Madison and Wisconsin in general have the worst matriculation rate for African Americans in 
the country, which is very surprising, because we have many schools in Madison which are 
presidential award winners. The plan was 85 pages long; the superintendent who helped create 
the plan left, and the new superintendent discarded it so it doesn’t exist anymore. Kira was very 
upset about that at the end of last year and made several appearances at the Board of Education 
meetings. She is very outspoken, and is a powerful speaker. She thinks she made people 
uncomfortable because they had to think about these issues, and as a result there was backlash. 
She thinks the superintendent was paying special attention to what Kira and a few other teachers 
at Falk were doing, because they were working to become a model school for cultural relevance. 
Kira doesn’t think the new superintendent believes that cultural relevance is going to have the 
desired effect, and so she has disbanded everything from that plan. The department of diversity 
and equity has been disbanded. 
 
01:08:50 Some people think that the union protects incompetent teachers, so is there a way for 
the union to encourage good teaching? Kira has heard this complaint, and has a strong opinion. 
The function of a union is to implement a contract. The contract delineates what everybody’s 
responsibilities are. That’s the only function that the union has. And if there is an issue, then both 
parties—administration and union—need to solve those issues.  For the last 15 years, Kira has 
seen five different superintendents, and in that time, there have been approximately 2000 
grievances that have gone steadily undealt with because the administration didn’t want to deal 
with them. So it makes it look like the union is ineffective, when actually it is the district that is 
ineffective. The union has tried over several years to have some kind of mediation for all of these 
grievances. The last superintendent got to the point where he wouldn’t meet with the union’s 
executive director any more without a lawyer with him. That doesn’t do anything for solving 
grievances. The union protects the contract. So, if a principal wants to take an action against a 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
8
teacher that the principal feels isn’t doing his job properly, the union simply states that there is a 
protocol that you go through and you give the teacher the opportunity to repair the issue along 
the way. And that’s not the union; that’s federal law. “I know there is this perception that the 
union is protecting bad teachers. But what the union is doing is implementing federal law.” 
 
1:12:00 Advice that Kira would give a young person considering teaching as a career:  don’t go 
into it for the money. She says this to all her student teachers and practicum students. Teaching is 
a lifestyle, it’s a calling. You have to feel it in your heart, you have to be dedicated to it or else it 
will kill you. It is an extremely stressful job, especially in today’s climate, where it feels as if 
there is a war with people who want to destroy public education. Teachers are under constant 
scrutiny, and under constant attack by people who say teachers aren’t doing their job—or who 
are saying that their job is much more than it actually is. There are people who tell Kira that her 
job as a teacher includes responsibilities that are for social work, nursing, psychology—all these 
other things Kira has no control over. It’s very challenging and stressful. If it’s not in your heart, 
you’ll have a heart attack and die, or leave the profession in a couple of years. Kira is still 
committed to being a teacher. Lots of things help her survive, but the greatest thing is that when 
she was in 3rd and 4th grade, she would go out to recess and hide under her coat under the stairs. 
She was bullied and beaten up regularly because she was half Black and half White. In 1965, that 
was not heard of. The only people she could talk to about it were her parents.  Now, what keeps 
her going as a teacher is her determination that that never happen to any child ever again. That is 
her mission in life, “I am going to change this. I will work every day, sun up to sun down until I 
put my head on that pillow at night, to change that. So that no child ever has to feel that pain ever 
again. That’s what really keeps me going.”
