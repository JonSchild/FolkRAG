On to Jordan I

The stars of night were looking down, 
Beside the gate we stood, 
Her sunny eyes were soft and brown, 
'Neath her pretty little Gipsey hood. 
Oh ! she was like the lily fair! (Break.) 
A 
little queen beyond compare! (Break.) 
Around her neat bewitching waist, 
My arm I'd fondly reach! 
And oh ! those lips I 
longed to taste, 
Were sweeter than a 
red ripe peach. (Danoe.) 
I 
held her lily hand in mine, 
And told my love so true, 
The roses in the starry shine, 
Heard us whisper 'mid the silver dew, 
Oh! like an angel fair was she, (Break.) 
Her cheeks would tempt the honey bee. (Break. 
(Repeat last four lines of first verse.) 
The summer night was growing late, 
The parting hour was near, 
And still we lingered at the gate, 
While I 
held her lily hand so dear, 
To speak the sad good-bye was pain, (Break.) 
But then she whisper'd, "come again !" (Break.

There's many moments I 
have seen, 
That an hour seem3d to me, 
When I 
was in de cotton fields, 
Before dey set me free. 
But months seemed just as short as days, 
When I 
was Chloe's beau, 
When in de cabin oft we met, 
lu tunes of long ago. 
CHORUS. 
But now my form is wasted, 
My cheeks have ceased to glow, 
I 
look with pleasure back upon, 
The times of long ago. 
How oft we sat on cotton bales, 
And such pretty songs she sung, 
It makes me feel so good to think, 
Of times when we were young. 
I'd welcome back dose slabbery days, 
I'd bear de whip and chain, 
And be a 
willing slabe to hab, 
My Chloe back again.

The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot where my mother and my father used to dwell. 
Oh! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of 
growing corn, 
Near the old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. . 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that stood on the hill, 
But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well, 
As the old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
My home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
how I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
I 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it fills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Many years now have passed since I 
left 
my dear old home, 
To wander abroad thro this wide world to roam. 
The spot has grown lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-nig 
Oh! how merry the birds sang their sweet songs 
of yore, 
As they perch'd on the maple near the old cottage door. 
Chorus.

Oh! dar's whar I

I

But, alas! dem good old times am passed away.

de children used to sing in de evening on de green, 
It used to sound so lovely and so grand; 
Oh! it filled my heart with joy, how sweet it used to seem,

Dear old massa's dead and gone, and I

He has left dis world ob pain, and up to glory he has gone, 
And ob trouble, dis old man has had enough.

But I 
fear de place am lonely and forlorn, 
So I

'Tis the loveliest flower that grows.

I 
am hard up, you don't know me, 
For my clothes ale tat'r'd and torn, 
My parents died when I 
was young, 
I'm forsaken, dislikd and forlorn. 
I've trav'l'd this country thro' and throb' 
On the road and on the rail, 
My limbs are getting stiff and cold, 
For the want of a 
warm meal. 
CHORUS. 
They say why don't you go to work, 
Whed they know there's none to be bac% 
They slain the door in front of your face, 
If you ask them for a 
bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to dooe, 
And they ask for charity, 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't support their family, 
But place a 
nickle in their hand, 
To some grog shop they will run, 
A poor man's money they will take, 
And spend it all for rum 
CHORUS. 
Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak aud sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
workingman's poor family. 
'Twas at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapped at the back door; 
A 
man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave rile bread and tea,

Darling, I 
have roamed to-day, 
'Mid the scenes of long ago ; 
Change has taken all away, 
That we lond and cherished so. 
Time has touched both cot and tree, 
Friends we knew no more remain, 
And I 
found naught left to-day, 
But the old church down the lane. 
CHORUS. 
Dear old chnrch down in the lane, 
It brings back with a 
fairy spell, 
Bright and beautiful again, 
Days, dear heart, 
re loved so well, so well. 
To its walls the ivy clings, 
And the roof was green with moss; 
Crumbling are the stones where sings, 
Lark and thrush amid the dross. 
It is going to decay, 
From the touch of time and rain, 
Just as we are love, to-day, 
Like the old church down the lane. 
Chorus. 
Long I 
stood beside the door, 
Dreaming of the joys we know, 
In the golden days of yore. 
When we I 
crossed its porch with you, 
When we left it hand in hand, 
For our journey o'er life's main ; 
Drifting back upon the strand, 
To the old church down the lane.

The old willow chair now so aged and worn, 
Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so near its decay, 
Is dear to my heart in its treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my fevered cheek weep/ 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the old willow chair. 
CHORUS. 
It rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with deligtitik 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy they say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her old willow chair. 
Oboes& 
It stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old will ,w 
chair that our grandmother made, 
And wtere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured of all; 
I3ni; now in the garret a 
relic so rare, 
All covered with webs stands the old willow chair.

Life's winter now is on my heart,

How often have we lingered 
There, together, you and I, 
To one another told our love, 
When no one else was nigh. 
Ah! those happy days have fled, 
Like the waters of the rill, 
That glided by— with merry song 
The old bench near the will. 
CHORUS. 
The miller long has gone to rest, 
The clanking wheel bangs still, 
For everything has gone to ruin, 
But the old bench near the mill. 
Old winter's snows have come and gone, 
Spring hail' decked with beauteous flowers, 
The trysting place where you and I 
Have passed such happy hours. 
Now I 
wander there alone, 
Yet fancy oft doth fill 
The spot where I 
have held thy form, 
On the old bench near the ... mill.

They tell m^ thou art gone my own, 
To a 
home beyond the skies, 
Gone where the stars are shining gold, 
Where friendship never. dies.

May we find in heaven another spot,

Little empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden now has fled; 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair, 
Peeping from the tiny snow-white bed. 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes, 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigh ; 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.

Baby left her cradle for the golden shore, 
O'er the silvery water she has flown, 
Gone to join the angels, peaceful evermore; 
Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.

Underneath my little darling sleeps;

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
andering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast corning sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
CHORUS. 
Go for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cokl is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
chills the poor wanderer, friendless, afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he going ? 
Must he repose ' neath the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking. 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Chore,

Oh ! 
how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe hint in pain, 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting. 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, dro. 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led hirr. astray, 
Far from his Ionic he has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see hint to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of loit friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened , 
Mother would welccine her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, clus, 
Go for my boy to-night! search through the city 
01 l'itu that mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh I 
bring him in pity, 
Itack to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy;. 
Bear him this message, where'er he is straying,

Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I'll tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings,

My wife may want him Michael, 
Her sister may want him illatt, 
My brother he may want him Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt may want him Pat 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus.

My name it is Alagown, 
From dear old IV exford town, 
'Tis there that I 
was bred and born; 
Where the grass grows so green. 
Fine sights are to be seen, 
On a 
beautiful summer's morn, 
But I 
wanted to roam, 
And leave my good old home, 
The passage my parents did pay, 
Shure they did sub and cry, 
'When 1 
bid them good-bye, 
And sailed for sweet Amerikay. 
CHORUS. 
In the ship ' Erin's Isle,"

No larger than a

'Tie there I 
slept the nights away,

Three meals they gave me everyday, 
On board was O'Reilly, 
And his large family. 
An uncle of Shanma O'Day, 
And jolly Rody Moore, 
MacMullins by the score; 
All bound for sweet Amerikay.

It's in this big city, I 
have an aunt Kitty, 
She's married to Darby McQuade, 
She lives on the first floor, 
Has a

Her huiband is tailor by trade, 
She is a 
sweet craythur, 
So full of good- nay thur, 
At her house I

My blessing to sweet Amerikay,

0;1! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
When to me such fond vows were made, 
Like the rays of sunlight she did promise 
On me to cast love's only shade; 
But, alas! my sorrowed heart is weeping, 
In this dreary world I'm left alone, 
She who promised that she'd ne'er forget ma, 
Now claims another as her own. 
CHORDS. 
Oh! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
In anguish my poor heart aches with pain, 
Tho' she's gone from me, and now's another* 
Still in heaven, mine, she'll be again. 
Since childhood it has been my fortune, 
To always find my fondest hopes decay, 
I 
ne'er met with any hope or treasure, 
But it would fade and pass away. 
Tho' twas hard to hear that she had wronged me, 
Still my lot in life I 
firmly knew, 
When 'twas told me I 
had been forgotten, 
I 
cried, she too, has been untrue.

While stitching in an old arm chair, 
And thinking of the good olden times, 
When we were all schoolmates together, 
And used to sing Old Oritnes, 
When mother mended my old clothes, 
In the good days of old Lang Syne, 
And she every day told all us boys and girls. 
"That a " Stitch in time saves nine. 
CHORUS. 
Golden hours pass away, 
So make hay while the sun does shine, 
And remember the adage so often told, 
That a " Stitch in time saves nine." 
Then as you work with might and main, 
For where there's a

And never put of till to-morrow, 
What should be done to-day. 
Make most of all your youthful days, 
Ev'ry hour brings decline, 
Save the pennies, and dollars will soon be yours,

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever Urn passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a !Jager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con- nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Sure, I

In the early hours of morning, 
O'er the waves we swiftly go, 
Heedless of the sailor's warning, 
NVhere the foam-capped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reach 
Idake our hearts with joy elated, 
Off for Coney Island Beach 
CHORUS. 
Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reach, 
While we find enough commotion, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day. 
And with charming friends around he, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our leach, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
tut o r 
hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing, 
All our lonely ones should teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing,

And my home shall be thine eiermore, 
When old ocean is stirred and sweet music is heard.

There's lots of fun for every one, 
With Finnegan arid his flute.

So lively and so gay, 
I

And pass the time away. 
My tootle-e-toot sweetly played 
Would charm the savage ute, 
The boarders are enchanted quite, 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
Some say I'm quite distracting, 
And I 
ought to be suppressed, 
They threrten me with lynching, 
If I 
don't give them a 
rest; 
But on I 
play without dismay, 
Tho' they call me a " galoote, " 
They must not dare to interfere 
With Finnegan and his flute. 
I 
don't belong to Gilmore's Band, 
Nor any band at all, 
But play for sociability, 
At many a 
private bell.

And down the stairs they thriw at once,

And her daughter Rosy Jane; 
We duet on the piano

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the 111-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was slaking With its aores of precious ISOU1s, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her littlechild, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos, cried, " OH, TAKE ME 1N YOUR ARMS, MAMA 
1" 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas, her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the cherished 
one relaxed their loving embrace, and when again the mother 
beheld the little pleader the once bright eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

When We both go home to papa.

CHORUS. 
Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight, 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother weak and hop lees, 
Praying for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader, 
Soon relaxed fir strength had gale, 
And the mother brokeri-liearted, 
Chen& 
In her grief was all alone. 
When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With tire sun- beams clear and bright, 
She went home alone to papa, 
Leaving child and love that night. 
But she often hears her darling, 
In the heartfelt pleading tone, 
Take me in your arms, dear mamma, 
Words that come in dreams alone.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer, 
In the azure-tinted sky; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair,

THE REASON WE MORTGAGED THE PAWL

post paid, to any address, on 
receipt of price, 40 cents in postage stamps, 
We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the tarm. 
CHORUS. 
It's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charrnft, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our protentien. 
For he was so kind when a 
boy-; 
And Betsey so gentle and loving, 
Would call hint a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
Re hard to he kveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm; 
We only can suffer in Pilence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
That we'd ever say farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart that loved you,

But forget you I

When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I

It was death in every tone. 
They have told you some Use stories,

You are false, but I'll forgive you. 
But forget you I

One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me?

Once upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden, 
in a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honey-suckle fair to see; 
And the maiden watched the blossoms daily, 
Heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent above it singing ever gaily, 
Every bud and every blossom knew, 
'When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Caine a 
sudden dainty frown; 
Jealous was the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love she did not know, 
Igo I 
greater love she did not know, 
Know, know, know, know. 
To the maiden came one day a lover, 
Tall and brave, and full of manly grace; 
Whispering tender words he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny smiling leo% 
Underneath the honey-suckle walked they, 
But her eyes were east demurely down; 
Seeing not as softly, sweetly talked they, 
How its leaves were turning sere and browik 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the vine. 
Careless is the maid I 
trow, 
Greater love hath learned to know, 
ItoI greater love bath learned to know, 
Know, know, know, know.

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen; 
A

In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself,, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS. 
Rise It, Reilly ! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'ont, 
When in the chorus wild they shout, Rise it ReillYI 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd acorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a

In some still andisolernn night. 
On the pale moon slowly floating,. 
O'er the starry home on high, 
Dreaming of that land of plenty, 
Far beyond the azure sky. 
Don't shut out the molnlight mother, 
Let it beam on me once mote, 
Let it light me through the valley, 
To that far off peaceful shore. 
And when I 
am coldly lying 
In that last long dreamless sleep, 
Ley ,me where the silver moonbeams 
Softly o'er my grave will creep.

We've heard martial songs and songs of the sea, 
Comic songs, and love songs, but they don't suit me, 
We love to sing of Ireland sweet land of our birth, 
I'm Paddy her eon, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh! Erin, my country it grieves us to see, 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we're not free, 
" 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the son's of Erin's No, 
Hurrah for the daughters who on us io smile, 
A. fig for her foes wherever they may be, 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Arise eons of Erin, ad prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled, 
United all like brothers we'll join hand in baud; 
We'll drive the proud Saxon away from our land. 
The land is the people's and who dare dispute, 
The word of our Maker, for He spai:e the truth, 
Then descend from the hull and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin.
