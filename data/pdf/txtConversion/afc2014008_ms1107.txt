.  PROCEDURES: 
B. ROAD IuOCXS: Road blocks will be established at various
 
points on Roi Namur Islands.
 These road blocks will desig-
nate a restricted area and must be adhered to by all islands
 
residents.  Due to the potential fluidity of the situation
 
these road blocks may be moved from time to time.
 
Initial contact with the unauthorized party will be made at
 
the point of entry, by the ARM Outer Islands or his rep-
resentative and a party of Micronesian employees living on
 
Roi Namur.  If the point of entry is at any location other
 
location other than the Marina, efforts will be made by the
 
ARM to influence these individuals to voluntarily relocate
 
to the Marina.  At that time the ARE will attempt to per-
suade them to leave the island voluntarily.  In the ment
 
that the unauthorized persons will not relocate, discussions
 
will be commenced at the existing point of entry.  No food
 
or beverages will be supplied to the unauthorized persons,
 
every effort will be made however, to confine them in an
 
area whem they will have access to water and toilet facilities.

sychologically
 
and sociologically r

This k

Though we c

The r
