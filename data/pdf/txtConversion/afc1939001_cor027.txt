Dear Dr. Spivacke:
Mr. Lomax has asked me to make to you for him a sort of report of progress,or lack of
progress,with the machine.
1.All shipments received to date. Paid $6.00 plus express on shipment of records. Alan
wrote us to expect sapphire pointed cutting needles. Those received are marked steel,but
seem to cut very well.
2. Broken tube discovered by Austin radio mechanic. Tube replaced.
3.Machine set up in hotel room, Houston seemed to work perfectly; made good sample
recording of “Sam Bass”.
4.Machine set up in Providence Home, Guadalupe Church, for recording of singing parts
of sacred drama, The Good Thief. Spoken introduction and one song recorded well. Then
something happened, machine failed. No mechanic to be found on Sunday. Machine to be

examined today. Hope no serious trouble. Have made engagement to go out to Sugarland
later to get songs of “The Good Thief” from Lopez family.
Machine wiring in bad condition, which might have caused shorts. No duplicate tubes
came with machine.
5. Could you send a few small discs? They are more appreciated and less expensive than
tips in some instances,— with institutions ,for instance.
6.No book of instructions came.
7. Don't be frightened.After things get going good,we shall not bother you with all the gory
details.
We were very sorry to know that Mrs. Spivacke has been ill. Please give her our best
wishes. Our regards also to the office family. All of you have been very kin d and patient
with the Lomax tribe and we appreciate it. You are probably head over heels in work for
the April concerts.
Sincerely yours. Ruby Terrill Lomax for John A. Lomax
Shall write Presto for list of service station. Thanks.
