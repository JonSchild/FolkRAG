This interview begins with Martha in mid sentence:
M:  Something about your own background?  How you got to, I mean how it is that your family 
came to the United States, where they settled?
R:  Well my Dad arrived here as a youngster at the age of thirteen.  And he arrived from the city 
called [Navi Sonch?], near the Polish and Czechoslovakian border.  And he came to American 
because he heard this was the land of the free, and the land of Democracy.  And Poland was 
always being stormed over by Russia, or Germany, or Austria.  It was being partitioned.  He 
didn't come over for the bread itself, he came over because of the ideals that he was concerned 
about.  His mother had a piece of land over there that was over thirty acres.  And they were quite 
well off, but nevertheless he heard of this dreamland.  When he came here it was not a 
dreamland.  It was a place where he was taken advantages of, exploited.  Worked in the mines at 
the age of thirteen.  Crawled on his belly in the mines first of all.  But then later on he worked 
himself up.  He went into business and he became very successful.  
M:  Where did he go to when he came here?
R:  Well he went to Lansford, PA.  He went to Washington, PA. and around the Pittsburg area.  
He worked in the steel mills over there.  Then later on he worked in the mines.  And the soft coal 
mines, the hard coal mines called anthracite.  And by the time he passed away he really totally 
fell in love with America.  He felt that this was the land of promise, the land of honey and what 
have you.  Although he also possessed a great love for Poland, because the Pole, when you 
mention the name Poland they feel that you are calling out the name of God.  They're very close 
to, like the Russians, and they feel that mother earth sustains them and gives them life.  And so as
a Pole you believe that your nation is something holy and you notice the same thing now 
between solidarity.  And the Holy Father, John Paul II, his holiness, that there is this chauvinistic 
attitude towards what is Poland.  But my Dad was never disappointed when he came to America 
later on, because he found out that if you're willing to work, if you're willing to study, that you 
can make a grandiose life, a style over here.  And he knew that being an American, this is the 
greatest privilege that he ever had bestowed upon him.  Despite the fact that underneath he had 
this undercurrent of love for Poland.
     My mother was American born.  She was born in Lansford, PA.  This is near Bethlehem and 
Allentown, and then near Hazelton, PA.  And she as a child, she was what you would call 
dispossessed, because she came for a Slovak, background.  And her parents were very very poor. 
And so she was forced at the age of eight to go out and labor in the homes of the rich.  And in 
fact she was a cook and a housekeeper for many many Jewish families, and it put her in good 
sted, because when she grew up she was one of the best cooks in the world.  (M:  Laughs)  Yeah. 
And she knew how to keep house, you know?  And she learned the values, such as honesty and 
having respect for your fellow man.
M:  From the Jewish people she worked for?
R:  From the Jewish people, yes.  So I sort of inherited many of the traditions of the Jews via my 
mother.  And so I had two world, or three even.  Poland, my Dad's background, my mother an 
American, who was brought up by the Jews more or less, and uh, what is the third one I would 
say?  I was going to say something else, but it eludes me now.
M:  An American perspective?
R:  And the American perspective, yes, yes.  So I'd say that being brought up in this background, 
I am very able to minister as a priest on the people, and become more compassionate, and more 
outgoing, and more loving, and more selfless, you know.  And they felt that the only thing that 
they should do is respect and serve their fellow man.  And I find that in Scripture it says that the 
greatest in the world is the servant.
     My background is that I was brought up in, I was born in Lansford, same town that my 
mother was born in.  There are many churches there.  People are very very Pius.  And later on I 
was brought up in a small town called Middleport.  And Middleport is a hundred miles from 
nowhere.  That's what I keep saying.
M:  In Pennsylvania?
R:  In Pennsy, yes.  But it's about a hundred miles from Philadelphia.  And the population is 
about five hundred.  That's counting the mosquitoes in the [name of river unclear] River, and the 
rats along the [name of river unclear] River.  It was a very small village, a very small town.  In 
fact last week I was in Middleport.  If you go shopping you never close your car doors.  You 
never lock them.  You leave the key in the car.  No one is afraid of someone stealing that car.  
You can walk into any house if you care to, through the back door.  The back doors are always 
opened.  And they still have this warm, friendly, neighborly atmosphere.  They talk about 
America, that you can't trust your neighbor.  This is in the city, not in the small towns.  So being 
that we were surrounded by Poles and Lithuanians, in fact the county (M:  in this little town?).  
Yes.  In fact I was surrounded by Lithuanians.  And the Country that I was brought up in is called
[Scuco?].  And I'd say about twenty percent of the inhabitants were Lithuanians.  And they were 
some of the nicest people in the world, and church goers.  
M:  Catholics?
R:  A lot of them Catholics, yes.  I'd say about ninety percent were Catholic.  About ten percent 
Protestants, or agnostics.  But the ones who were church members were fervent, enthusiastic 
members of the church, you know.  And so I was brought up in this atmosphere of faith and 
belief.  And as a priest, though later on as a seminarian I was in seminary in Scranton called the 
[name of seminary is foreign-cannot transcribe] Seminary.  It's named after an Italian clergyman, 
who was more or less someone who spoke out the truth, you know.  And for this he was more or 
less persecuted.  And then later on I attended the University of Scranton also, and Union College 
up in Schenectedy where I was stationed as a clergyman.  I am in the priest hood now over forty 
years.  I was ordained very young at the age of twenty, but continued going on to school.  You 
know there was a posity of clergy.  A posity of clergy and therefore at the age of nineteen and 
eighteen I could not celebrate Mass or anything.  I could not even marry people as such, but I 
was marrying people.  and the Pastor was singing his name to a certificate.  And I was preaching 
at the age of eighteen and nineteen in churches down in New Jersey, in Trenton, New Jersey, in 
Linden, New Jersey.
M:  Are you the first son in your family Father?
R:  I am the second son.  I have a brother by the name of Peter. And Peter has served in the 
armed forces of our nation, and he felt it was a privilege again to serve in the armed forces to 
defend his nation, because he had this sense of patriotism that passes on from my Dad.  And my 
Dad of course, when he came to America he was not of age yet.  And he wanted to serve in the 
armed forces during the First World War.  And he could not be accepted because he was too 
young.  So he assumed the name of someone else, and he entered the U.S. Army under someone 
else's name, just to make sure that he could bare his sole to his God, and if need be lay his life 
upon the alter of America.  But then when he served in the American Army for awhile, he felt 
that he had a guilt complex.  He was also Pole.  So he asked to be sent to Canada.  And there he 
was trained to become a Polish soldier.  And he went over to France.  And there alongside the 
Americans they fought the First World War.   And when the war came to an end he had a chance 
to go back to Poland, the First World War, and see his mother.  And it was a known fact that 
anyone who served in the First World War, they received a bonus.  And the men in the small 
town would ask my Dad, did you receive a bonus?  And he said no, because I switched from the 
American Army to the Polish Army.  Well they said, you're out two hundred dollars, or 
something.  This was the round sum that they used to receive for serving in the armed forces.  
And he said, I received a greater gift in bonus than you, because he said as a son, I had a chance 
to go back to my homeland called Poland.  And he said there I beheld the eyes of the woman 
who gave me life, my mother.  And I heard the beat of her heart, you know, and this was worth 
more than two hundred dollars.  It's worth more than all the gold in the world.  Because after he 
left Poland his mother passed away.  So he said I had a chance to behold this beautiful creature 
before she was accepted or promoted to heaven by her God.  
     Now as a clergyman I served in Scranton in a Cathedral parish. At the age of twenty I was 
addressing lawyers and doctors, and college professors, and I was more or less an expert on 
religion.  But people were not aware of the fact that every sermon that I ever preached was 
censored by the Pastor and the Bishop who resided in the same building, you know.  Make sure 
that I wasn't preaching any heresy.  But I found out that as long as you stressed the love and the 
grace and the forgiveness of Christ, you could never be a heretic you know, because Jesus said, 
"by this shall you know that you are my followers if you love one another as I have loved you.  
And I give you a new commandment that you love each other.  And what does it profit a man if 
he gains the whole world and loses his own sole."  And the only way that you can hold on to 
your sole is by loving your God, loving your fellow man, and of course loving yourself.  And so I
served in the Cathedral parish for three years.  And from there I was sent on my first parish as a 
youngster at the age of twenty-three.  And I became a pastor in a parish that was troubled, that 
was going through [unclear] that were very rough.  In fact that had an outstanding mortgage.  
And the parish consisted of many elderly people.  And I guess I had about thirty-eight families.  
Not even families, just families and members who were in the church that I could address as 
members of that parish.  By the time I left we had over 300 families in that parish.  It was a 
perking parish.  And we paid off the mortgages and everything.  We had very good attendance, 
you know. 
     And then I was switched to New England, to a troubled parish in Saint Casimir's.  It's a 
Lithuanian Saint incidentally.  I always tell the Lithuanian people that we stole Saint Casimir 
from you, and he had royal blood in him.  And I would keep telling the people that they're 
royalty too, because they're the children of a king.  The king of kings and they're destined for a 
palace some day.  And the royal road is the road of love and forgiveness.  Well I served in 
Wollingford, Connecticut.  And I had a mission parish up in Plantsville, Connecticut.  They were 
on the verge of closing.  (M:  her question is unclear)  Mission parish is where I would go on a 
Sunday and celebrate Mass.  During the week there was no pastor there.  And they would have to
get in touch with me in Wollingford.  Where as in the Wollingford Parish, it had the status of a 
real parish, because they had a pastor there, they were self-supporting.  But at that particular time
they were not self supporting when I took over.  They ran into problems too.  And I happened to 
be a trouble shooter.  And it just seems that we healed that parish, not I, but God and the people, 
you know.  But I was there.  I was in the parish shedding and spreading and exuding just the love
of Christ, because every priest and every Christian should be a miniature example of Christ, who 
is the quintessence of love you know.  And so after healing, after God healed the two parishes 
down there I was called into Lowell.  And Lowell at that time, twenty, almost twenty-two years 
ago this coming November 1, when I took over, I took over the parish in '65, November 1, and it 
was on the feast of All Saints you know.  And the following day is the feast of All Souls.  And so 
when I came here it was a city that you would cry over.  Like Jesus cried over Jerusalem.  Why?  
Because it was such a poor and run down city.  And my parents when they came here to visit me 
the first time, they felt that I should up and leave the city.  That this is more or less the slum 
district of New England.  And I said no, this is where God is leading me.  And of course my Dad 
wasn't very happy when I was Ordained.  I'm going back again.  When I was Ordained down in 
Saint Stans Cathedral in Scranton, by a Bishop by the name of Francis Hodur, H O D U R.  And 
he was Ordained as a priest in Saint Peter's and Paul's Cathedral in Scranton by an Irish Bishop.  
And then he was consecrated as a Bishop by a Bishop over in [Utrect?], Holland, and by a 
Roman Catholic Bishop over there.  So I feel that I've got ties with Holland too, being that my 
Bishop was consecrated there.  I've got ties with the Irish you know, and I've got ties with the 
Lithuanians, because I was brought up in their midst.  I used to eat their [bleanies?].  I used to 
attend their Sacred Heart Church every so often down in New Philadelphia.  But going back to 
my Dad, when he found out that I was Ordained, or considering ordination, or even considering 
going in the seminary, he told me that I've got long fingers and I should never become a priest.  
Perhaps I should become a lawyer, or even a doctor, a surgeon.  He said he would do everything 
in his power to get me through school, you know.  I wouldn't have to worry about scholarships or
anything.  And I say, nay, I just want to become a priest.  And he said, why a priest?  I said 
because I want to become a priest.  I haven't got any answer for that.  I said, I can tell you that 
I've got the calling.  That I fell in love with Christ, but you wouldn't believe me anyway.  I said 
it's just a matter of someone fell in love with me and I'm reciprocating this love.  And I must go.  
And he said, well I'm not going to pay for your schooling if you go to seminary.  But I was 
Ordained and he came to my ordination Service in Saint Stans Cathedral, but he walked out 
before the ceremony was over, because he wasn't happy that I was becoming a priest.  My 
mother was up in heaven you know.  She was enchanted.  Most Slovak, or Lithuanian, or Polish 
women, or Irish mothers, when a son becomes a priest this is something supernatural.  It's a 
blessing.  It's a benediction to their family.  
M:  But the father's don't feel that way?  
R:   Well my Dad.  I can't speak for all fathers.  I'm just talking in terms of my Dad.  Well what 
happened when my mother passed away, I found it very difficult to accept this.  And I spoke out 
openly to God, and I told him, I said, I've been a very faithful servant of yours for so many years.
Why is it that you deal such blows to me?  Because my mother was fifty-seven, I felt she should 
live a little longer, you know.  And she was my inspiration as all mothers are an inspiration, you 
know?  And God had different plans.  And for three days I more or less argued with God.  And I 
used some nasty names.  But I find that god is such that if you want to you could used nasty 
names you know, and you can speak out openly.  If there is any bitterness in your heart, speak 
out.  If you're disappointed let him know about it.  And in this way he can hear you all the more, 
because the line of communication is opened between you and your God.  Well when my mother 
passed away I went down to Pennsylvania in a small parish in Middleport.  I celebrated the Mass
of Resurrection for her, but I couldn't preach.  I couldn't eulogize, because I was afraid that I 
would break down.  So I had a friend of mine, a priest by the name of Father Thomas, who gave 
the eulogy.  We had many clergy in attendance.  I guess about fifty clergymen were in attendance
in this small community.  It was something extra ordinary, you know, for a poor peasant woman 
to have a Bishop, and have fifty clergymen in attendance at her funeral.  The people felt that she 
was like a queen being sent off to her God and her Lord.  But what happened on the following 
Sunday, I was still in the small community where they called me Joey.  I was Joey.  I was at the 
head of the gang, you know.  We never did anything wrong.  We would form baseballs teams and
football teams you know, but we never really got into real trouble.  We respected our neighbors 
because of this small community atmosphere.  We respected their property.  There was no 
vandalism and everything.  There was not vandalism or anything.  But they couldn't understand 
how this rough and tough individual could become a lover overnight, you know, and want to 
serve God and celebrate Mass up at the alter, the Mass of Love, the Mass of Eternal Life.  But 
the Sunday after I was instrumental in con celebrating the ceremonies with the clergy, then the 
following Sunday in my home parish I got up and I said, "I'm that fellow that you called Joey."  
Some people call me Father Joe and behind my back they call me nasty names.  But I said I want
to go on record saying that, "when the sun is shining and everything is going your way, it's easy 
to believe in God."  I said, "I was going through the valley of the shadow of death.  I lost 
someone who was very close to me.  I was surrounded by darkness.  And I want to reassure you 
that the God is just the same.  He's as real as he ever was.  In fact I can more so see him than 
ever.  When it gets dark outside you can better [unclear] the stars up in the heaven."  And I had 
mentioned to them about a girl in the concentration camp.  A Jewish girl.  She had written upon 
the walls of the concentration camp, the words that, "I believe in the sun even when it's not 
shining.  I believe in love even when I do not feel this love in my everyday life.  And I believe in 
God even when he remains silent."  So I stressed the importance of the eternal God, the living 
God.  And that you go to him and you worship him, not because you fear him, it's because you 
love him.  Because if you fear him you're like a slave.  Aristotle said many years back that if you 
love God out of fear, then you're a slave.  But if you love him out of love, then you are liberated, 
a free man, or a free lady, you know.  And I found that because of my background you become a 
better servant of your people, a better American.  And you're never embittered.  You have a 
beautiful outlook on life.  I get up every morning after serving people for over forty years as a 
priest, and I feel that I'm full of life, ginger.  I'm full of vigor, vinegar even if you want to call it.  
Enthusiasm.  And life is beautiful and America is great!
M:  Tell me, tell me how Lowell was when, when you arrived here?  How you felt the parish 
was, the people in the parish, the city?
R:  The people, the pastor before me, my precursor, or predecessor I would rather say.  Precursor 
sounds all right too.  But, as if I'm cursing him or something.  He was a wonderful man.  His 
name was Father [name unclear].  He was Ordained over in Poland in the Catholic church.  And 
then he came over here.  He ministered on to the people here for fourteen and a half years.  He 
was born in America, but taken to Poland as a child.  Brought up in Poland, Ordained as a 
clergyman, and he came to America, he landed in Saint Casimir's Parish later on as pastor for 
fourteen and a half year.  A great man?
M:  Was he the first pastor of Saint Casimir's?
R:  No, the founder of this parish was very strange, esoteric, because it was Francis Hodur, who 
was the Bishop who Ordained me.  He was one of the first priest in this congregation here.  And 
he founded this parish back in 1898, December 3.  This parish is an old parish, one of the oldest 
parishes.  It is the older of the two Polish parishes here in the city of Lowell.  And from the very 
beginning they had many difficulties.  Not only financial, because if you were a Pole you had the
problem of not speaking the language of the people here.  If you were English or Irish it was 
much easier, you know.  And then what happened is, many of the people when they came to 
America, being that they couldn't understand the language they were more or less persecuted.  
And they were taking advantage of exploited, you know.  And so this church, or any Polish 
Church as a rule, was a bastion of freedom to them.  And in fact for neon to ninety years in this 
parish here in Saint Casimir's we have what we call a parish counsel that has the right of 
accepting or rejecting the priest who ministers on to them.  In fact if they don't like me they can 
remove me by a majority vote.  They get in touch with the Bishop and they say we don't want 
him.  And when it comes to collecting the money, counting the money, banking the money, I 
have a committee, a counsel that takes care of that.  They have full authority you know.  And I 
have but one vote at the meeting here, which makes me very humble.  If I had too much power it 
would destroy me you know.  
M:  Then you'd be a dictator.
R:  Yeah, I'd be a dictator, yeah.  But going back to Father [name unclear] who preceded me, he 
after serving this congregation fourteen and a half years, he decided that he wanted out, because 
he didn't see any future in this parish.  This was twenty, almost twenty-two years ago.  And after 
I took over as pastor he went up to a parish up in New Hampshire, in Manchester, Holy Trinity.  
And I went up to see him, pay him a visit.  I wanted to find out more about the background of the
people and the type of life style that they lead, and how I can better minister onto them.  And he 
began to laugh and he said, "I think you made a big mistake."  And I said, "what was that?"  He 
said, "you should have never accepted Saint Casimir's.  When the Bishop told you about Saint 
Casimir's you should have turned it down, because he said, I don't give you more than six 
months."  And he said, "I don't give that parish more than ten years.  He said, it's going to die 
out.  It's a Polish ethnic parish, it hasn't got a future."  Now I've been here twenty-two years.  It's,
it's doubled in membership and the income is the greatest.  I've never worked in the red here, you
know.  And in various societies and everything, they have over a million dollars.  And the 
property here is worth about over three million dollars.  And they have land out in Pelham, New 
Hampshire where they have burial grounds, a parish, a cemetery.  They've got a park in behind 
the cemetery.  This was a custom of the Lithuanians and the Poles, they would, near their loved 
ones, where they were resting up in God's Acre, they would always have picnic grounds or 
something where they would go up there.  And once a week this was part of their life style years 
back, that they would gather in family picnics there.
M:  In the cemetery or behind it?
R:  Adjacent to it.  In behind it.  They would have a park where they would have pine trees or 
something.  And sometimes on a Sunday the priest would celebrate Mass out in the cemetery 
itself.  It was an open-air Mass.  He would have one mass out there.  And they felt close to their 
loved ones who were elevated, promoted to eternal and ever lasting life.  Because of course as a 
Catholic, when you go to Mass you believe there is a communion of saints.  That all the people 
who lived and who are baptized into the faith, that they are in attendance at every mass 
throughout the world that is being celebrated.  So when the priest would celebrate Mass out there
on a given Sunday, I celebrate Mass there twice a year now.  We have a shrine out in the 
cemetery.  (M:  When?)  On the 30th of May we always celebrate a Mass for the soldiers who 
gave their life, who sacrificed their life to make America great.  And also for the intention of all 
the parishioners and all the faithful departed.  And then on All Souls Day we have a ceremony 
out there.  This again is a Lithuanian and a Polish custom.  Where the Poles on All Souls Day 
they light candles on the graves of their loved ones, and they participate in the ceremony out at 
the cemetery.  This is not an American custom.  It's a custom that came in from Europe.  And I 
think it's a beautiful custom and I adhere to it.  
M:  Does it still exist today?
R:  Yes, yes.  Every All Souls Day I'm out at the cemetery and I have a large crowd out there.  It 
might be very cold.
M:  Which is the end of October isn't it Father?
R:  Yes, it's the second of November.  And you'd be surprised that when it's awfully cold I have 
some of the elderly people out there too.  But what I do is I make the ceremony very short now.  
It's about twenty minutes or so, and we leave the cemetery.  And I tell the elderly people that they
should stay in the cars with the heaters on, you know.  The young people they can brave it.  If the
can go skiing, they can also participate in a ceremony for they loved ones.  So going back to 
Father [name unclear] now, he prophesied that this would die out in ten years.  Why?  Because 
he was burying the oldsters and they were very traditional here.  Very narrow minded.  It was 
sort of like a ghetto church.  If you were not Polish or Lithuanian you couldn't walk in the front 
door, because the Lithuanians are first cousins of the Poles you know.  And so what was 
happening is the membership was dwindling.  
M:  It was the church policy, or people didn't feel welcomed?
R:  Well it was the, it was the group of people in the parish.  They felt that as long as they were 
here and their families, that they had control of the parish.  And it was also the outlook of the 
priest, that he should minister onto the Poles you know.  And when I came in it was just a 
complete switch you know.  I told them I will preach in Polish.  I will celebrate your Mass in 
Polish, but I must have Mass in English too.  And because of this we open up the door and we're 
not a ghetto church anymore.  We serve the community.  The community comes in.  And not only
that, we're able to branch out and we have what we call Alcoholics Anonymous in the Parish's 
center.  This is ministering on to the community.  One of the hospitals in the community wanted 
to set up a clinic for the poor children of the area, we opened up the doors you know.  In this way
if a church needs money in the community we will share some of our funds.  If there are poor 
families [tape fades out].
TAPE I, SIDE I ENDS
TAPE I, SIDE II BEGINS.
R:  It's the faith of the people, it's the love of the people.
M:  What did you mean Father when you said that the church had been opened to Poles and 
Lithuanians, but you opened it to the community?  You must have a different understanding of 
the community.  The community in your eyes was obviously not just Polish people.  
R:  That's right.  I could not minister only onto Poles, although I feel that you know, being half 
Polish that the Poles are the chosen race.  You know how the Lithuanians are, or the Irish, or 
even the Scotch.  The Scotsman says that when God created man he created a beautiful being.  
But when he created a Scotsman he created it a wee bit better you know.  And so being a Pole I 
do feel that I'm very grateful to my Dad that he gave me a spirit of freedom.  Because when the 
Poles go out fighting, of course they didn't always bestow this freedom upon their neighbors the 
Lithuanians, you know.  But they're, by and large their policy was that we fight for our own 
freedom and the freedom of all nations.  But I feel that a church cannot consist of just a white, it 
must be the Black and the Yellow and the Brown.  It must be the Indian.  It must be the rich, the 
poor.  They didn't want any Blacks in the Congregation.  I haven't got too many families.  I guess
I got about four families, they're Malardos.  From the beginning I was fearful that they would not
accept them as human beings you know, but I found out that by preaching and reiterating the 
message of Love and Brotherhood, that when the Black families did appear on the scene that 
they were welcomed with open arms.
M:  How did they come to come to your church?
R:  By mistake, or perhaps it was because of someone who loved the Polish language.  There was
a young lady who's a member of this parish, her name is Jean Finch.  And she's got a family of 
five.  One daughter is a Captain in the Air Force and her other daughter graduated from the 
University here, she's a Second Lieutenant.  Third one has a Masters Degree from the University.
One son is an engineer.  One son went to school here and he flunked out, and he said I want to go
back to work.  And he's the black sheep of the family so to speak, you know.  But she was Polish 
and French.  She was French of Polish extraction you know, or background, ethnic background.  
And during the Second World War, there was a man by the name of [name unclear], Jean 
[unclear].  That means the enlightened one.  The enlightened one.  And it happens that American 
soldier, a Black American Soldier by the name of John Finch arrived on the shores, upon the 
shores of France.  And eventually divine providence saw to it that they fell in love you know.  
And her parents, parents who were very stonch Poles, and they also loved France because this 
was a nation that opened its door to them.  But when their daughter who was going to an 
exclusive Catholic school began chumming with this Black American Soldier boy, the parents 
said, bring it to an end.  If not we're going to dispossess you and disown you.  We're not going to 
have anything to do with you.  And her heart spoke out and the heart said that she loves him and 
she wants to marry him.  And so she married him.  Her parents did not attend the wedding.  The 
wedding took place in the Cathedral, American Cathedral in Paris, France.  They were married 
by a clergyman there.  But her family did not show up.  She was disowned you know.  She was 
not a member of the family anymore.  And all of her pictures in the house back home, they were 
turned to face the wall.  In the eyes of the parents she was dead.  She passed away.  Later on, 
because her husband made a career out of serving in the Armed Forces, she travelled to many 
Islands in the Pacific.  She was stationed in many camps down south.  And when she would walk
with her Malardo kids, shopping or something, they would walk up to her and say, lady, why 
don't you get rid of those dirty niggers.  And they were speaking out about her children, talking 
about her children.  And she said the hurt and the searing of the spirit and of the soul.  But she 
said by the same token she said I grew up to be a better lady, a better American, because I really 
went through the experience.  I went through hell itself.  And she said, I brought up the children, 
and she said I'm very proud of the fact that I was able to carry, bear this burden through life.  And
what happened is after her children grew up they wanted to see their grandparents over in 
France.  And so she got on the phone and she called up her mother and dad and she said, Mom, 
her mother's name was Helen, dad was Joseph [says name in Polish], she said, I know that you 
feel that I'm dead in your eyes.  I accept this dad, but this is no reason why you should punish my
children.  My children were persecuted.  They were looked down upon, spat upon.  But I don't 
feel that a grandparent should spit upon a grandchild.  My grandchidren want to see you with 
their eyes, behold you with their eyes.  Would you please come to America and visit your 
grandchildren?  If not, I will send the grandchildren to France.  And so the parents, grandparents 
decided they would come to America.  No for the sake of their daughter Jean, but to see their 
grandchildren.  When they came to America on Sunday morning, they told Jean, they said, we'd 
like to go to a parish where Mass is celebrated in Polish.  And so it happened to be that they were
working down at one of the Army outposts here.  And there they met a Polish boy.  And they 
said, where is Mass being celebrated in Polish in a church in Lowell?  And he chose this church 
here at Saint Casimir's instead of Holy Trinity.  He could have said Holy Trinity, but it was by the
providence of God that he picked out Saint Casimir's, you know.  They came down here to Saint 
Casimir's and they fell in love with the church, and they fell in love with the people, you know?  
And I correspond with them for the last six, seven years.  And they said, you don't mind if we 
accept you as our son.  They're up in their eighties you know, almost ninety.  And they said, we 
would want to accept you as our son, because you remind me of one of my sons.  And I said, 
well that sounds good.  I'm the son of God, I can be your son too.  But what happened is when 
the grandparents came here they fell in love with the grandchildren.  And they also fell in love 
again with their daughter.  And they said, you were dead, but you came back to life.  And forgive 
us, we were so narrow minded.  We were so unloving and so unforgiving.  And we find that you 
and your husband, he's good to you.  He's Black, but God doesn't recognize the differences in 
colors.  God doesn't know whether you're really called colored because you're Black, because 
we're also colored.  We're white you know.  That's a color too.  So we're all colored people.  And 
so the relationship between the son-in-law and the daughter became something brand new, you 
know, something that arose from the dead.  It's like a dead body coming back to life.  And now 
they have a close communication, the daughter and their son-in-law, her husband.  They go to 
France on many visits, you know.  And the people from France, almost every second year they 
come to America now.  And it's a beautiful relationship.  
R:  Do you have other groups Father, in your church?  We have Irish.  We have Scotsman over 
here too.
M:  Is it a neighborhood church?
R:  More or less.  I would say it's about 50% neighborhood now.  But it's still 50% ethnic, you 
know?  And you can you know, walk softly, you know, like a man walking on eggs.  And you can
satisfy the Polish people who were brought up in this ghetto church.  And by the same token you 
can satisfy the new influx of people.  
M:  I guess you speak Polish?
R:  Fluent Polish, yes.
M:  Is that the language that you were, grew up in?
R:  No, no.  I'm, I was (--)  Well more or less.  Yes.  I was surrounded by Polish.  
M:  But your parents didn't speak Polish at home?
R:  My mother speaks perfect Polish, or she spoke perfect Polish.  My dad was an avid reader.  
And I would have to read the Polish papers with him.  So this is where I got my Polish language, 
you know.  And so to preach in Polish, it's a blessing.  You have to be very emotional, very loud.  
And you show the love of God in a special way.  This is why I can understand John Paul II, you 
know,  being a universal lover.  I met him over in Poland.  I met him down in Boston, down at 
one of the churches there.  We broke bread.  And he told me, he said, and he's go Lithuanian 
blood incidentally in him.  Did you know that?  (M:  No)  Yeah.  One of his grandparents was a 
Lithuanian.  So when he says he's Polish this is not all so, you know, he's got some Lithuanian 
blood in him.  But I would say he that would make a very good American, you know?  He'd 
make a very good Christian no matter what church he was in.  He might be conservative in the 
catholic church, very conservative, and this is turning certain people off, because he wants to 
clergy to be celibate.  And it's a different day and age that you're living in.  You had over 15,000 
clergy up and left the church because they want to have the option to get married you know.  And
many of them married because it's one of the Sacraments, the channel of grace in the church.  
And it was brought in by Pope Gregory the 7th.  And um, by this time the church should have 
faced up to realities, you know?  They should be a little easier on people who are divorced, you 
know?  It is becoming more understanding.  But twenty years back they didn't want to accept any
divorce unless if it was a special case or some sort.  Now it's common place.  And then I think 
that the church should become more of a church that unites all peoples, you know.  And when 
someone comes to church and they want to receive Communion, I don't feel that because you're 
not a Catholic you shouldn't be accepted.
M:  What's your relationship with the Catholic Church?  [Question unclear]?
R:  We are, the only difference, we are so alike that when you talk about our differences it's 
absurd, you know.  We have the same priesthood.  In fact if I wanted to become a Roman 
Catholic priest I would have to go down and see the Cardinal.  And they would accept me after 
contacting my Bishop to find out about my status in this church.  And I could be accepted into 
Rome without being re-ordained, because it's the same priesthood.  It's the same religion, 
self-same religion.  What is the difference, if I could call this a difference, is your clergy can 
marry after five years, but they have to get permission from their Bishop, you know.  And they 
have this option, because Jesus, the first miracle that he ever performed, was there was a young 
couple in Canna, Gallely.  And they married.  And they must have been very poor, because they 
ran out of wine.  And Jesus was in attendance, Mary was there, the Blessed Virgin, and she told 
him, she said, well do something about it.  He said, well my time is not ripe yet.  And it took 
perhaps about an hour or so and he felt it was the ideal time for him to perform his miracle.  And 
so Jesus changed water into wine.  And he was showing them that the basis of our society is built
on a family.  A family is very important.  And the reason why he performed that miracle is 
because the necessary ingredients were there.  Love was there in the hearts of those young 
people.  And there was faith in each other, you know.  And where there is faith and there is love, 
God can always perform miracles.  So remember that in your own life, you know.  Well we 
believe that a priest is a better priest if he gets married.  That's if he opts to marry, because some 
priest they want to remain as celibates.  They never want to marry.  And yet the Jewish people, 
they say that if you do not marry you're half a man.  And I didn't know what it was all about until
I marries.  And I'm happily married too you know.  I'm married to a school teacher, and an 
organist.  And she's very understanding.  But she would be like a Mother Superior you know, if 
she were in the Roman Catholic Church.  Because they are so pius and so (--)  They want to go 
to a daily Mass.  They want to accept communion every, every morning, you know.  And they're 
more so pius than I am, some of the wives, you know.  I'm not that pius.  I'm not overly pius you 
know.  It's a life style and I enjoy it.  But I say we can marry.  And perhaps this is good, because 
the first Pope was married.  And most of your clergy at the beginning, the apostles, with the 
exception of Saint John, they were married men.  And down through the centuries I'm told Pope 
Gregory the 7th, they brought in the celibacy in the Western right of the Roman Catholic Church.
Not in the Eastern right.  Because the Roman Catholic Church consists of the eastern right and 
the western right under the Holy Father.  In the eastern rights, in the eastern right they can marry,
but they must marry when they're Deacons.  Later on they cannot marry.  Once he's priested he 
cannot marry.  But in the western right, where they had the mass in Latin, it is one of the laws of 
the church, one of the promises of the priest when he's being ordained, that he's going to remain 
as a celibate for the remainder of his life.  And this was brought in as I have mentioned by Pope 
Gregory the 7th, so he would have better control of the clergy.  He found it very difficult to 
control the clergy when they were married.  But this is not so.  This is not so.  Perhaps, perhaps 
in his case he was not able to cope with that given situation.  Now when it comes to the Pope 
himself, they asked me when John Paul II was elevated to become the Pope of the Roman 
Catholic Church, whether I believe that he is infallible.  And I answered by saying, when he was 
Italian there was doubt in my mind.  Since he is Polish there is not doubt whatsoever.  I know 
he's infallible.  (M:  Laughs)  
     Now what I'm trying to say by this, is we don't believe that at the very onset there was any 
man who was infallible.  If you read the history of the church you know that they were not 
infallible.  When you read abut the inquisition and about the immorality and everything, it's in 
the church, because we have human beings in the clergy.  We have human beings you know.  
Therefore we're going to have a lot of that [unclear], what you call the [unclear] or the weeds.  
You're going to have a Judas Escariet who's going to sell Our Lord for thirty pieces of silver.  
You're going to have Saint Peter denying him three times before the crucifixion, you know?  And
you're going to have Judas' today who deny their Lord and sell him out.  But when it comes to 
the dogma, the infallibility, we say that he is first, first amongst equals.  He is first amongst 
equals.  Now this was a dogma that was brought in later on by the church.  And if you check out 
the average Roman Catholic Priest.  If you ask him if he believes the Pope is infallible, I'd say 
about sixty percent will say no, or they will say, well I don't know.  I really don't know.  This is 
giving a human being the power of infallibility that only God possesses, you know.  Only God 
possesses.  And I as a priest in this set up, I feel that what we have been stressing more so than 
anything is the love, the love of God.  The mercy of God.  The forgiveness of God.  And we feel 
that when he died upon that cross, he died for all.  And because he died, even if you want to go to
hell, you can be there for awhile.  You can be in hell right here when you stop believing, or stop 
loving.  [Polish name unclear] said this, he said, what is the definition of hell?  It's when you stop
loving.  Even in your own personal life Martha, when you decide that you're going to get angry 
with your husband for an hour, or two, or three, you're living in hell.  You never heard about 
hell?  If you don't trust him and believe in him you're living in hell, you know.  And so [Polish 
name unclear] said, where there is no love there is hell.  But I don't believe that Christ would 
ever be satisfied if even one soul was lost.  I sound like the Unitarians.  But this is what the Mass
is all about, you know?  The all incompassing love of God.  I am here, every two or three people 
are gathered in my name, I am here.  Because I live, you shall live also.  And no force shall rend 
you out of my hands.  I'm just quoting scripture you know.  Not even death, because I've 
bestowed upon you eternal and everlasting life.  So the reason why this church came into being, 
it's a, it's a branch that is strictly American.  It was founded in American.  Yet we were not happy.
We are called what you would, we are called the Polish National Catholic Church.  
M:  Is it always Polish, or could it be Irish National, or (--)
R:  No, it can be Irish.  It can be Irish.  If the majority of the people were Irish it was called the 
Irish National Catholic Church.  Lithuanians, they have a parish right here up in Lawrence.  It's 
called the Lithuanian Sacred Heart Parish.  They're more or less with the same set-up, 
Catholicism and freedom.  They say that you cannot have freedom in a Catholic Church.  Well 
we've got it for the simple reason that when it comes to religion the priest is the "expert" so to 
speak, in quotation marks.  But when it comes to the church polity, the laity, or the experts, I'm 
one of the advisors you know.
M:  Do you have a Pope like figure in the church?
R:  Well we have what we call a prime Bishop.  You can call a piece of meat prime beef or 
something, we have what we call a prime Bishop.  He's the first Bishop.  And his name is John 
Swanting, he's down in Scranton.  He's half French and half Polish.  His mother is French, his 
Dad is Polish, you know.  And he was my parishioner.  When I took over Saint Casimir's Parish 
he was attending school at that time.  He was attending one of the universities down there up in 
the University of Connecticut.  And he left the seminary.  He was down in [name of seminary 
unclear] Seminary, and he left that.  He said he was disenchanted.  And he was attending the 
local Irish Church there, Holy Trinity.  And then he found out that I was the new priest that came 
into the parish.  And he came to look me over.  And in looking me over.  And in looking me over 
we had many tete a tetes, you know.  And he asked me, he said, what do you think I should do 
with my life?  And he also went to a seminary out in, around in Michigan there, [name unclear], 
Roman Catholic Seminary over there.  And he up and left.  He was disenchanted over there.  So 
he was going to the university and he said, "what should I do?"  I said, "we're not going to pray 
over it.  I said, I'm taking my car back down to Scranton.  I said, you're going back to [unclear] 
where you belong.  And you know that you're going to become a priest.  And I'm going to pray 
for you every morning."  He became a priest and he became the first Bishop, you know, the 
prime Bishop.  And I'm just a poor lonely pastor on a parish.  I didn't make the grade you know, 
I'm a failure now.  No, you're not a failure.  I think the greatest one in the kingdom is the servant 
you know.  I think the greatest job in the world is being a pastor of a parish.  But we do have a 
Prime Bishop.  But he is being invited down to South Carolina now by John Paul the II, because 
he's a Polish Bishop, you know.  And John Paul the II wants to have a little audience with him.  
Being that they're both of Polish ethnic background, but he doesn't know that he's also half 
French.  I don't know if the Holy Father knows about that, you know?  But we're so close that 
when O'Connor down in New York City, and Cardinal Law, when they were being consecrated, 
our Bishops were invited to the Vatican to participate in the elevation of O'Connor and Law.  And
when the Holy Father was giving out his noon day blessing, he asked the Bishops, two of our 
Bishops, Bishop Rowkinsky, who's out if Buffalo, and Bishop Riche who is stationed in Saint 
Stans Cathedral down in Scranton, he said would the two of you as I am conveying the Blessing 
upon the pilgrims in attendance, would you also bestow your Polish Blessing upon them.  So he's
very chauvinistic, you know.  Very chauvinistic.  We are very close, because some of our priest 
even celebrated Mass in the Vatican, in the Catacombs over there. 
     In this community here in Lowell, whether it's Saint Louis Parish, or Saint Michael's, or 
Jeanne D'Arc, or Saint Jean Baptist, I concelebrated Mass in each one of those churches.  Now if 
you're a minister and not a validly ordained priest, you cannot concelebrate, or celebrate the 
Mass in the Roman Catholic Church.  They must recognize your priesthood as valid, having the 
apostolic succession you know?  So when you say what is the difference?  I'd say it's more so 
church polity.  Where we have the laymen who have the voice and the power.  Why did the 
church come in to being?  It's because back in 1897 there was a lack of communication and a 
lack of charity on the part of the hierarchy towards the laymen. The laymen could not understand
the language.  They came from Poland speaking only Polish.  And the Pole, when he came to 
America he said, I'm not going to learn English, because I'm going back to Poland.  I'm going to 
stay here for five, ten years, but I'm going back to Poland.  And what happened is the Polish 
people, they went to the Bishop, Bishop Hoban down in Scranton, and they were being 
persecuted by the Pastor who was calling the laity in church [unclear], which means swine, you 
know.  And this is a well known German terminology towards the Poles, because there is this 
inherent hatred between Germany and Poland, because Germany was always invading Poland, 
using Poland as a battlefield.  Like I don't know if you know about the Lithuanians.  They're 
angry towards the Poles, because the Poles took [Vilno], a city by the name of Vilno away from 
them.  They should have never done that you know.  There was no need for that.  But because of 
that you build up hatred in the heards of people.  Well the Pole, when he looks at a German he 
looks at a conqueror, and enemy.  Someone who overran his land.  Who raped his women.  Who 
exploited the people of Poland.  Who enslaved the people of Poland.  And so they had a pastor in
the Polish parish, a sacred heart of Jesus and Mary, who is of German ethnic background.  And 
being that they were peasants, they were not learned people who came here from the beginning, 
they were peasants.  Some of them could not read or write you know.  And here they would here 
from the pulpit this priest calling them swine.  And they felt that this is not the word of God.  
And so they wanted a Polish pastor to minister onto them in the Polish language.  Lithuanians 
were the same when they came to America.  They wanted somebody who would preach the word
in their own language.  Or can you picture yourself as a Roman Catholic wanting to go to 
Confession, a regular Confession.  How could you go to Confession if you only speak Polish?  
How could you confess your sins?  How could you make an act of contrition?  How can you ask 
for forgiveness or absolution form the priest?  It's impossible.  So they asked Bishop Hoban, they
said, we want a Polish priest, and he wouldn't give them a Polish priest.  And this German priest 
was persecuting them.  And this was only one particular parish that I am zeroing in on.  This was 
through, this was a true story throughout the entire land you know.  This is the way they were 
being mistreated.  By clergy who were not of their own ethnic background.  Now over in Poland,
in the average parish they found warmth and understanding and love in the heart of the pastor.  
They came here, this was missing you know.  And so one of the curates up in that parish from 
whence came this break, the first break, that became the Polish National Catholic Church, in this 
parish there was a curate by the name of Hodur again, H O D U R.  And this Bishop Hodur was 
preaching about the love of Poland and the love of their Polish traditions.  And the pastor told the
curate, he said, the assistant, he said, make it low key.  I don't want anything about Poland and 
traditions and what have you.  But he didn't understand the psyche of the Polish people.  So 
consequently what happened, they went down to see Bishop Hogan.  And they said they want 
this Bishop Hodur as their pastor, but they want four conditions too.  Number one, that they can 
choose their own pastor, or reject their pastor.  Number two, that they become the owners of the 
church property.  Number three, that they rule by having a parish committee, you know.  And 
number four, that the Mass be said, not necessarily at that time, but the sacraments be 
administered in Polish, whether it's Baptism, or Marriage, or Confession, you know.  Because at 
that time the Mass was celebrated in Polish, or in Latin rather.  In Latin.  And so the Irish Bishop 
could not understand them.  There was no compassion in his heart, because he could not 
understand them.  He was a man of power, you know.  And he felt that if he would infuse a lot of 
fear into their hearts that they would stay very humble, like we thought that if we would scare the
negro, I shouldn't use the work negro, the Black, if we would scare the Black you know, that he 
would become docile, remain docile and obsequious.  That never happened you know.  We had 
all kinds of squirmishes and shedding of blood and what have you.  And so this is the same thing 
in the field of religion.  We're not asking for a different religion, all we wanted was a sense of 
freedom within the church itself.  And they call on Bishop Hoban and consecrate their church, 
Saint Stans, a beautiful Cathedral down in Scranton that has a membership of about three 
thousand families, you know.  And Bishop Hoban said no, he said it has to be according to my 
conditions.  And he said I shan't change one point on our teachings of the church.  And it was not
anything regarding religion.  It was regarding the administration of the sacraments.  It was 
regarding that they wanted to have a parish committee that could control the clergy, because 
many of the clergy exploited the people at that time.  Because you had, Judas' came in and Judas'
up and left the church.  It was the same thing here.  This parish came into being because the 
Polish people were saving money for a new church building.  And they saved up three thousand 
dollars.  It might seem like a small sum of money [tape fades out]
TAPE I SIDE II ENDS
TAPE II, SIDE I  BEGINS.
R:  Back in, as I had mentioned before 1898, that there was a priest that came in by the name of 
[Polish name unclear].  And they were taking up a special collection.  They were celebrating 
Mass in Saint Joseph's Church in some hall on Dutton Street.  And they were very very happy, 
you know.  But they felt that they should not take advantage of the French.  They wanted their 
own church.  They wanted to build their own church.  And here in America the Poles built close 
to a thousand churches and parochial schools and what have you, you know.  But here in the City
of Lowell for three years they were taking up a collection for a new church.  And they amassed a 
fortune of $3,000.00.  Now you must go back in time.  At that time they were making four, five 
dollars a week working in the factory here.  So that was a lot of money, three thousand.  For 
three thousand dollars you can put up a beautiful church you know?  You could buy a house for 
$300.00 in this community, for two hundred dollars, for a hundred dollars.  But what happened is
Father [name unclear] and the three thousand dollars disappeared.  And they picked out a 
committee and they said, we're going to question the Cardinal about the monies.  And they went 
down to Boston a few times and there was no reaction.  And so they found out about the parish 
down in Scranton that was concerned about a democratic church.  And they asked for Bishop 
Hodur to come up here and be instrumental in founding this parish.
    No, we are not anti-Catholic.  We are pro-Catholic, 100%, 1000% are more so Catholic than 
even some of the Roman Catholics because we have all of the statues in Church here, you know. 
We don't believe in so many changes.  But what happened is when Bishop Hodur came here he 
told the people the conditions under which the parish came into being down in Scranton, and 
they wanted such a parish here.  And they organized this parish and they're happy here because 
they found a little Polonia, a little Poland here.  This is why they were concerned about not 
accepting outsiders.  Because they had, the Mass was in Polish, the Sacraments were in Polish, 
but their children were growing up.  And the children only spoke English, you know.  The 
grandchildren only spoke (--)  Not the children, they spoke Polish.  But the grandchildren, they 
only spoke English in a few words in Polish.  So they were being hurt not being ministered onto 
by being members of Saint Casimir's Parish.  But because it took them almost seventy-five years 
or so, or seventy years before they began to change their minds a little bit, that they're able to 
salvage what they've got here you know?  And it's so very close to Rome that we're having 
dialogue now.  We have a quarter million followers in America.  Quarter million.  We're so close 
and it's not religious dogmas that separate us.  It's church polity, you know.  But before a womb 
can heal it takes a lot of medicine.  And so we do have dialog with Rome.  And we do 
concelebrate once in awhile.  
M:  Do you have a relationship with the other churches, especially the Holy Trinity on High 
Street?  
R:  Holy Trinity, now you have to understand the Pole again.  If you have two Poles in this room,
you're going to have three political parties.  Now you must remember that the mission of Holy 
Trinity, which was founded I think in 1905, I'm not sure, you can do some research on that and 
find me wrong you know.  But it was founded about seven years after this parish came into 
being.  And the reason why that was founded over there was to bring this parish to an end, 
because they felt that this was being a little bit to heretical, by severing you ties with Rome.  But 
we never severed our ties with Rome.  They excommunicated us.  And the church should never 
curse anyone, it should bless you know.  Jesus said on the cross, "Father forgive."  It should have
been a good mother ministering on to the people who were even in the Polish National Catholic 
Church.  And I'm sure this, what they call [scism], to be a heretic means not to think the same 
way as mother of things.  And I'm sure your very heretical when your mother thinks about you, 
because you have different concepts and different ways of explaining life.  And you have a 
different life style.  And she feels that you're heretical.  But yet you're her daughter you know.  
And by the same to token if Rome was a little more understanding, if the hierarchy was a little 
more loving and compassionate, this [scism?], or this heretical group that they call heretical, that 
means that we differ in thought a little bit, just a little bit, a wee bit you know.  If they were a 
little more compassionate this would have come to an end in no time.
M:  Because they have since started National Churches within the Catholic Faith.  
R:  Yes, but it was (--)  Yes.  Okay.  Now you have a point Martha that was given to me by one of
the priest who was an associate pastor up here in Holy Trinity.  His name is father, is it [name 
unclear], but he's stationed in the parish up in Salem, New Hampshire.  [Name unclear].  The 
name is [name unclear].  And Martha, you made a point that was relevant seventy years back, it's
relevant today.  If it wasn't for the Polish National Catholic Church there would have never been 
so many nationalistic parishes within Rome itself.  You would never have Holy Trinity up here, 
because Holy Trinity came into being because this parish was organized.  They felt they didn't 
have enough Poles here to build a new church.  But after this small group stood up for it's own 
rights you know, then Rome came around and they organized Holy Trinity after this parish was 
in existence for seven years.  At least seven years.  And so it did a lot of good to the Polish 
people, for the Polish people.  And Father (--)
M:  Is there, is there a conflict in families between people who might go here, or might go to 
Holy Trinity?  I mean does that propose a problem in the Polish community?
R:  Well Martha could I answer by saying, does your mother ever argue with her sisters, or her 
brothers?  (M:  Of course)  Within a family you're going to have differences of opinion.  And this
is true that there was a line of demarcation between the two parishes for awhile, because they, 
they would call this church [unclear], that means "made of wood" you know.  And I don't see 
where [unclear] we have a brick church here.  And there they would call the Roman Catholic 
member of the family a Baron, and that means a goat you know, or a part of the sheep you know 
that is afraid of the Shephard.  So they were calling each other various names, you know, not bad
names.  They're not bad names, but this is within family groups you know.  But they you'll have 
two brothers.  One wants to become a priest, the other one wants to become a lawyer or 
something.  And the fellow who is the lawyer feels that I'm the fool, and I as the priest, I feel that
well he's not utilizing his entire potential you know.  There were misunderstandings.  There's no 
getting away from this.  When I came in to Saint Casimir's almost twenty-two years ago, I saw 
that there was this, this invisible wall of I don't trust you, I don't believe in you.  And some of the
people in town would call me Mister, from the other side, you know.  I'd go to a banquet or 
something, and I'd say "how are you."  And I have a custom when I walk into a hall that I shake 
hands with all of the people, you know.?  And ninety percent of the people would say, "Hello 
Father Joe."  And there was this certain element they would say,  "hello Mr. Klimczak."  And I 
never took on bridge though.  I said, if you call me Mister, they call him Mister God too.  In 
Polish they say [Pombuk?], that means Mister God, you know?  I'll tell some of them that you're 
making a deity out of me.  I said, I'm only a priest you know, you shouldn't make a deity out of 
me.  But I would never take on bridges I said.  But I found out that after living in the community 
for about ten years, all that hatred disappeared.  Because when you get to know someone you 
don't fear him anymore.  You're not afraid of him, so you call him the way you should.  Address 
him the way you should, you know?  And if he's a priest, you don't respect the man, you respect 
the office, you know.  If he's a doctor, you respect the fact that he's a medical doctor.  If he's a 
clergyman and he's worthy of it, show respect, you know.  So now in the city here, it's more or 
less like a family you know.  Many, many dinners or something that they have, the dinners we 
have down here, we invite the pastor from up there.  In fact I never have a dinner down here 
without having a Roman Catholic Priest offering up benediction, or invocation, or something, 
because I feel that he's my brother in Christ you know.  The pastor that is up there now, his name 
is Monsignor Abucewicz.  Abucewicz [says name in Polish].  He served in the Armed Forces as a
Chaplin.  You think that would widen his horizon.  He's a good priest, he's a good man you know,
but he's afraid of me.  He still fears me.  I don't why, but he fears me.  He feels that I'm a 
competitor, that I'm going to steal his souls or something.  I don't want his souls you know.  I've 
got enough trouble with the souls that I've got in my own parish.  This parish over here has over 
a million dollars in the till.  I mean I don't have to worry about his souls.  I don't have to worry 
about raising money or anything, you know.  But I didn't want to be very close.  And what I 
would do if someone would die in the Polish community, I would pay my respects as a Polish 
priest, you know.  He's not a member of my parish, but I go up there, I kneel down, I say a song 
in prayer.  I express my condolences to the family.  And I say I will remember you're loved one, 
our loved ones in my Masses.  But no wanting to steal them you know.  And I'm hoping that he 
would do the same when my people pass away you know, that he would drop in and I told him 
so.  I said, drop in, pay your respects and tell him that you're going to remember them at your 
Masses up in Holy Trinity.  Well he feels he doesn't want that, you know.  Well he's, he's not 
really a Catholic, you know, he's sort of a narrow minded Catholic I would say.  Because if 
you're a real Catholic, you're not that small spiritually.  I love him, and I feel sorry for him, and I 
pray for him, you know.  And when we meet each other, we hug each other, we shake hands.  If I 
want to sit in the sanctuary, I sit in the sanctuary, but he doesn't want me to accept Holy 
Communion.  The Irish priest, they want me to accept Communion.  Now it's a good thing you 
brought up the Polish Parish, it's not the laity as much as the shepherd, you know.  I have 
concelebrate at Mass in every Catholic parish here in town with the exception of the Polish 
Parish called Holy Trinity.  And I say, let it be on his conscience.  If he doesn't give me 
Communion, let it be on his conscience.  I would never want to go back home and face the 
Master, and he says, "hey, there was a guy by the name of Abucewicz, Father Abucewicz who 
came to Communion to you and you turned him down, therefore you're not worthy of gaining 
eternal life yourself.  Because when Jesus instituted the Blessed sacrament, he said take and eat, 
this is my body.  He didn't as them if they were Catholics or Protestants.  He said, take and eat, 
this is my body.  And the strange thing about that last supper what that they were Jewish boys.  
And they were not even Baptized.  They were not even Baptized.  And Jewish boys.  And they 
didn't go to private confession.  They didn't go to a regular confession, and yet he said, "take and 
eat, this is my body."  And then he told his apostles, he said, "go out and teach all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and give them 
the bread of life, give all people the bread of life."  Whether he's Black or White, it doesn't make 
any difference.  Whether he's a Moslem.  In fact when I have a funeral here, my Bishop would 
roar if he ever found out about it.  Because some of our Bishops are very narrow minded too.  
But when people come to church here, especially to a Mass of Resurrection, or a Nuptial Mass, a 
Wedding Mass, a Mass of marriage, I see if there is anyone in church who feels that they would 
like to come up and receive Our Lord in Holy Communion.  I said, we have an open table here, 
you're all welcomed.  And I'd say that about 95% of the congregation always comes up and 
receives, you know.  They always receive.  And I wish that every church would be like that.  If 
the Roman Catholics would be like that, they would enchant and steal more souls from the 
Protestants you know.  Not that you're suppose to be stealing goldfish from someone else's fish 
bowl, you know, but at least a Protestant would feel right at home when it comes to a Catholic 
Church.  And when he comes in and the priest gets up and he says, now if you're baptized and 
you're Roman Catholic you can come up and receive, but those who are not Catholic, you can 
just sit back and say a prayer or something.  You feel that you're being rejected.  If I invite 
someone to dinner, and this is what the Mass is, it's the last supper, it's a banquet.  You're inviting
people to accept the bread of life you know.  If I invite you to dinner to my house, and I say, 
Martha you cannot it, the rest of my family and friends will eat, but you cannot it.  But you can 
offer up a song, or a prayer or something as we're eating.  We wouldn't stay on friendly terms for 
very long, would we?  So going back to Father Abucewicz, I love him.  And I'm hoping that 
some day the God will open up his eyes, because I would never turn down not even a Jew.  I 
have many Jews that come to me, they want to get married to Catholic girls you know, or even 
members of this parish here, and they're called National Catholics.  And I say, well the only thing
you'll have to do is you'll have to sign a piece of paper.  And they say, what kind of piece of 
paper.  Of course in the Roman Catholic Faith, if it's a non-Roman Catholic marrying a Catholic, 
he's go to sign a paper that he's going to bring up his children as Catholics, you know?  What I 
say to him is you'll have to sign a paper not once, but every week, every two weeks.  And they 
say, what kind of paper, I say, the check when you hand it over to your wife.  That's the paper 
that you sign.  You've got to support her and the family, and be a good supporter.  And they say 
you've got a good sense of humor, you know.  I've married many a Catholic here, Catholic boy, 
and they come in with their wives.  In fact I have a fellow who comes in all the way from New 
York City about four times a year.  His names is [name unclear].  He comes in with his wife 
Priscilla, who is a French girl.  And she'll go through her Our Father, and Hail Mary, and what 
have you.  And she'll come up and receive Communion.  And he will kneel with the people.  He 
stands up with the people.  He reads the misalet you know?  And he's very happy in the church.  
Why?  Because we open up the doors to him, you know?  We human towards him.  And that's 
what the church must be, is human and meaningful to our communities.  
M:  Father, speaking of the community, can you tell me how the concerns of your parishioners 
have changed since you've been here?  
R:  Well there was a church here, a Baptist Church, it burnt down.  They right away, they called a
meeting.  And they earmarked a thousand dollars towards the Baptist Church.  There was Saint 
Peter's Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church on Gorham Street.  They needed money 
towards the new steeple.  And they announced this in the newspaper you know.  So at our 
Thanksgiving Dinner, Father Morrissette, a French priest was in attendance.  I got up and I 
introduced Father Morrissette.  He needed no introducing.  But nevertheless I introduced him.  
And I said he's not going to only offer up the invocation, or the grace before the meal.  I said, 
before we start eating, I said I'd like to share with the Roman Catholic Community, so we're 
going to take up a collection.  And I've going to earmark Father Morrissette as the collector.  And
be generous in your giving.  A word to the wise is sufficient, you know.  He went down and he 
picked up for my people a thousand four hundred something dollars, you know, for the steeple up
at Saint Peter's Church.  This is how close we are, you know.  We install Mayors once in a while. 
I'll have one of the prayers, the Roman Catholic Priest will have the other prayer you know.  The 
families are closer now.  There isn't that bickering anymore.  Well you're a member of Saint 
Casimir's, were a member of Holy Trinity.  Although the clergy sometimes are narrow minded.  
It's not the laity.  Most of your laity are becoming real Christians in the full sense of the word, 
you know.  And if there are any poor in the neighborhood, we identify in the sense that we help 
out the poor.  We have a certain fund for the indigent you know?  And I've identified with the 
community by becoming Chaplin of the East End Club, which is a Roman Catholic Organization
consisting of Irishmen and Frenchmen.  And every second year they come down and have a 
Mass here for the repose of the Souls of their departed members, and the following year they go 
up to Saint Michael's.  So we feel that there isn't that much difference between Saint Michael's or
Saint Louis.  In fact the new Pastor Father Soucy and I, one of my relatives had a father that 
passed away about three months back.  And I was there with him concelebrating in the Mass with
Father Soucy.  So that shows how close we are.  My people attend their bingo at Saint Louis 
Parish, at Saint Michael's Parish.  Their people attend our bingo down here.  We have our people 
working at their bingos, they've got Roman Catholics working at my bingo.  We have many of 
the Roman Catholics, who if they can't make their own Mass they come down here.  Or my 
people can't make the Mass down here, they attend one of the local Roman Catholic Churches.  
M:  Would you say that the problems and hopes and values of you parishioners are different from
other parishes?  Or what, a better question I guess would be what would you say are the major 
issues here?
R:  I'd say fifty years ago, yes.  Today no, it's about the self-same values, self-same philosophy of
life.  They might go to a different church building, but whether it's event he Protestants, we 
seemed to mesh.  I have many Protestants who come down here and they play Bingo.  They're 
not suppose to if they're primitive Methodist.  They go to hell if they play Bingo, you know, but 
they come down here and play Bingo and say, don't tell my Minister that I'm down here.  But the 
values I'd say they're the self-same values.  Love of God.  Love your, love of your fellow men.  
Love of your country you know.   Respect for your neighbor.  
M:  How did the Polish community change since you've come to Lowell?
R:  Polish community got rich.  The Poles are very frugal people.  They'll have a million dollars 
and they'll claim they're still poor, you know.  They will not tell you about their bank account, 
but I found out when they pass away that so and so have over a million dollars.  And some of 
them even die in [unclear].  This is some of the weirdos in the Polish community.  But what 
happened is the Polish people fifty years back, sixty years back, they purchased, bought land, or 
home here in this given area and I'd say about 80% of them moved out.  They moved to suburbia.
And they're, they don't want to live in a house that is $50,000.00 dollars, valued at $50,000.00.  
They want to live in a house that is valued at about $300,000.00, $250,000.00.  They're 
concerned about about an education for their children which is good.  Even the DP's that are 
delayed Poles or pilgrims you know, are disappointed Poles, or disgruntled Poles.  When they 
come from Poland to America, the first thing that they're concerned about is their children going 
to school.  
M:  Are there new Poles coming to Lowell?
R:  There are new Poles and they're extremely esoteric people, hard to understand.  They don't 
mesh in with old Polonia, that means the old Polish community, because they make so many 
demands on life.  What they demand of life here in America is a position, not a job.  They want a 
position.  They want a lot of money, they don't want to work for it, you know.  Number two, 
when they send their children to school, they don't want to send them to a state university, they 
want to send them to Harvard, or Yale, or Princeton for something.  And I've got new DP's, the 
new immigration that they come to America, making demands on me as a priest that I should get 
their children into Harvard.  I said, I can sooner get them into heaven than I can into Harvard you
know.  I said, you have to be a special sort of individual.  And I said you have to have all kinds of
connections.  And so I have a friend here who is a lawyer, he's a graduate of Harvard.  And I said 
could I in some way, in some unknown way, spiritual way, get some of the Polish youngsters in 
to Harvard even if they are not rich, but they nevertheless scholastically they're high on the totem
pole.  And he sat down, he told me, he said I've got two sons and I wanted my two sons to go to 
Harvard.  They were not accepted.  I'm a graduate of Harvard.  One son graduated from Cornell, 
the other from Fordum, you know?  And he said one son is a doctor, he's making about $150,000 
or more down in New Jersey.  And he said the other son is over in Europe, he's a failure.  He's 
working for the government.  He's getting about $85,000 a year.  This was about five years back, 
you know?  So they make big demands on us.  And what I can't understand about the new 
immigration is they could be members of the Catholic church, stonch members of the Catholic 
church.  They could belong to solidarity union and be members of the Communist party at the 
same time.  How do you explain that?  If you can explain that you're better than God you know.
     But going back to the Polish community, what has happened is many of the oldsters have died
out.  And upon the parents passing away, they sell the property.  They go to suburbia.  Their 
children do not speak Polish now.  And many of them do adhere to the church, despite the fact 
that they live ten or twenty miles away from the church, they still have membership in this 
church.  They might not come here every Sunday, maybe once a month they come to the church 
here.  And during the remaining Sundays, they go to a local Roman Catholic Church.  Because 
they say Father, it's a little bit too far.  What should we do, because we can't make it in every 
Sunday?  I say, go to the nearest church and receive Communion.  Go to mass over there.  And 
that's what they do you know.  But the Polish youngsters, they're very, very manipulative and 
they're able to, or they're filled with wisdom at a young age you know.  They know how to mass 
a fortune.  Something about the Polish people.  By and large you never bury a poor Pole.  
They're, some of the that Jewish blood, there were so many Jews over in Poland, and I think the 
Jewish people sort of spread that same spirit to many of the Polish people.  This is the same 
about the Lithuanian too, and they're very rich many of them too.  
M:  Father there's not so much an ethnic community anymore.  What would you say has replaced
ethnicity as an important factor in Lowell?
R:  Ethnicity is still important.  They feel that is should still be here, the language in the church 
and the liturgy.  And they feel that every Sunday there should be one Mass in Polish.
M:  Which Mass is that?
R:  At 11:00, 11:00 in the morning.  They will not attend.  They will attend the English mass.  
They will not attend the Polish Mass.  But they still feel that we should have a Polish Mass.  
Then they, what unites us is a cemetery too.  It's like a trusting place for those who are called to 
heaven you know.  And they want their loved ones to be buried in a Polish cemetery so to speak. 
And I'd say about ninety, ninety eight percent of the people out at the cemetery are Polish.
M:  And you said it's in Pelham?
R:  Pelham, yes.  It's about 50 acres of land, plus you have the parking behind the cemetery there.
It's one of the nicest cemeteries in the area.  
M:  Where in Pelham?
R:  This is on Pulpit Rock Road.  Pulpit, Pulpit Rock Road.  
M:  And are you the person who is in charge of the cemetery?
R:  I'm the superintendent.  That means that's an additional job.  No remuneration.  And I would 
want to pass it on to my laymen, but they don't want it.  Because what happens is, we have about 
twenty-five burials a year out there.  And I have to go out and I have to pick out the spot where 
they're going to be buried, you know.  And I have to see to it that the grave digger is there, that 
everything is up to snuff, that the cemetery is taken care of.  And they take great pride in their 
cemeteries.  Then what unites us ethnically is the fact that every so often we do have the Polish 
home here, or the Polish America Vets.  They've got Polish dances here.  Many of the laymen 
from this parish and from Holy Trinity are very active in the Polish American Vets and the 
Polasky Club, and in the Dom Polski, or the Polish home.  
M:  Polasky Club and the Dom Polski, is that the same?
R:  No, that's a different group, a different political party.  You know, I had mentioned wherever 
you have three Poles you're going to have two political parties.  And they have to have their own 
little groupings, you know?  But when it comes to a great celebration, like the Polish home was 
celebrating their 75th Anniversary, we had about over 600 people at the Elks Hall down here.  
We had the Roman priest was there and the National priest was there, you know?  We all work as
a team.  We all pull as a team.  And we could have sold about a thousand six hundred tickets, or 
more.  The trouble was that we didn't have enough room.  And we had to limit the seating 
capacity to 600 people.  
M:  And this was who the [rest of comment unclear]?
R:  75th Anniversary of the founding of the Polish Home, Dom Polsky.
M:  Was that recently?
R:  This was about less than a year back.  Less than a year back, yeah. 
M:  What's the Polasky Club?  I haven't even [unclear].
R:  Polasky Club is to commemorate the memory of this great Pole, Polasky, who at the age of 
nineteen, or twenty, fought for American Freedom, was the Founder of American Calvary, and in 
commemoration of him they put up this hall there.  And they feel that they're keeping his name 
alive in the community of Lowell.
M:  And where is this?
R:  This is no, right across the street from the Lithuanian club here in town.  
M:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm just going to excuse myself for a minute.
