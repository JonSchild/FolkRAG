HAPPY BIRTHDAY,  DEAR AMERICAN FOLKLORE SOCIETY...
 
As  I have had occasion to remark elsewhere,  every dog  indeed
 
has his day,  and every body,  whether human or institutional,
 
gets  a birthday every year.
 No exceptions  are allowed.
 
And when one hundred birthdays have mounted up,  some
 
especial  attention must be paid.
 Just staying intact for that
 
long is an achievement all by itself;  getting anything done
 
beyond simple survival is positively commendable.
 The American
 
Folklore Society has done a good many things during its century
 
of existence.
 I should like to concentrate my observations here
 
upon its  signal achievements  in the proliferation of  folklorists.
 
I myself am a folklorist and I was brought up around
 
folklorists and I have been observing them for a good part of
 
the century that we are celebrating this year.
 The comments
 
that follow,  then,  are personal and stem from my personal
 
observations,  especially from having noted that no two known
 
folklorists -
-
 like snowflakes -
-
 are alike.
 Mostly,  it seems
 
to me,  this chronic variability is due to the fact that most
 
folklorists  spend their professional  lives trying to work out a
 
/
 
balance between the several responsibilities that go along with
 
being a folklorist in the first place.
 
In the very first place,  there is the absolute necessity for
 
field work where one comes to grips with the living data of
 
folklore itself, when and where and with whom and as it exists.
 
In the second place,  there is research,  in which one looks for
 
and receives information and analyses that parallel or
 
contradict or simply vary from one's own observations.
 In the
 
third place,  there is the public presentation of folk materials
 
and the conclusions of one's folkloric studies through printed,
 
filmed,  recorded,  exhibited,  or performed products;  (of this
 
more later.)
 Fourthly,  there is the preservation of the
 
discipline itself through teaching it to others.
 And finally,
 
in government,  private employment and academia as well,  there is
 
office work and administration, where one accomplishes all those
 
things that have to be done in order to get the other parts of
 
the work underway.
 Every folklorist I have ever known does or
 
has done all of those things in varying proportions.
 That is
 
what makes us  interesting.
 
When I look back over my own life,  I see that I have done an
 
awful  lot of teaching,  an awful awful lot of administration,  a
 
respectable,  but not outstanding amount of public presentation,
 
much less research than I should have done and far too little
 
field work.
 Doing such a little smitch of field work was
 
f me,  but I did have three kids to raise and a lot of
 
it involve you in a very complicated relationship with
 
Ir
e
s
p
o nsibilities.
 
fiel d  work is that not
 
I
w
uiiT
 
the responsibility of at  least trying to figure
 
information you have collected actually means.
 
difficult,  grinding,  worrisome,  dark journey of
 
ave 
can't say I
 
a great many
 
I
.
.
is   I
I
 if they do,
 
the UI
II!
 
have ever relished
 
folklorists like
 
they finesse the
 
Fieldwork,  however,  no matter how grudgingly performed,  how
 
brief the encounter,  remains the absolute sine qua non of the
 
folklore profession for it sets the folklorist and the folk into
 
a relationship the exploration of which may take a lifetime.
 It
 
is never a casual meeting, that first serious discussion
 
collector and informant,  to use the ugly word that seems
 
only one we have developed to identify the owners and
 
progenitors of the cultural materials we comment upon.
 
a n
 
When I was teaching years ago,  I had a student who did an
 
excellent term paper based upon some folk curing beliefs he had
 
collected from an old lady in his neighborhood.
 At the end of
 
the semester, he voiced a complaint.
 "You taught me all about
 
how to collect, Mrs.  Hawes.
 What you didn't teach me was how to
 
stop collecting.
 That old lady lives on my block,  and every
 
night when I come home,  she runs out on the porch and says,
 
--'Hey,  boy,  I just remembered another one!'
 I keep trying to
 
explain to her that my project is all finished,  but she just
 
won't stop,  and I
' m starting to go up the alley when I go home
 
just so I won't run into her."
 
I said,  "My dear young man, welcome to the grown-up world.
 
It's a place where real actions have real results, where real
 
people have real feelings as well as real information.
 And it's
 
a place where old ladies actually think that people who say they
 
are interested in what they know really are interested,  and
 
issues  like course requirements and semesters and quarters are
 
really quite irrelevant.
 You've gotten your A.
 Now you start
 
to pay back."
 
And ever after that I used to warn classes: watch out who
 
you collect from.
 When you talk with somebody about their
 
folklore, you move quickly and often imperceptibly into a realm
 
of deep intimacy,  much deeper -
-
 in my experience -
-
 than you
 
ever intended to go.
 And afterwards you find you haven't just
 
collected folklore,  you're very apt to have made a new friend
 
with all the responsibilities,  as well as the delights,  that
 
friendship brings.
 
The payback.
 As much as we try to get away from the
 
uncomfortableness of it,  the fundamental fact of being a
 
folklorist is that we earn our livings by various manipulations
 
of other people's creative products or information.
 It just
 
comes with the territory.
 We are not alone in this,  or course.
 
The very existence of literary scholars,  music critics,  and art
 
historians as well depend upon the creative productivity of
 
other people.
 
But folklorists generally confront this problem in
 
especially direct ways.
 Many of the artists whose works we
 
treat are still alive,  for one thing.
 For another,  although
 
there is much current interest in boardroom,  corporate,  and
 
advertising folklore -
-
 basically,  the folklore of the affluent
 
-
-
 most of the data we enjoy,  analyze,  comment upon,  display and
 
organize comes either from people who are economically poorer
 
than most academicians or at best less experienced in the ways
 
of  "making it"  outside their own society.
 It makes sensitive
 
folklorists worry that they may be exploiting people who are not
 
in a position to protect themselves or who are simply too
 
good-natured to resent the interference.
 
Those are good worries.
 I approve of them,  although they
 
can become dangerously close to patronizing on the one hand and
 
paralyzing on the other,  particularly when one realizes that
 
folklorists,  unlike most anthropologists,  tend to do their work
 
in their own country,  in their own common language.
 This means
 
that the people you are writing about can read the books you've
 
written;  they can look at your films and see how you've
 
transferred their reality to the screen;  they can attend
 
concerts and festivals and check up on how performances are
 
miked, what the presenter chooses to remark on, what repertoire
 
is being presented, whose baskets get put into what part of an
 
exhibit case, what the labels say.
 It's no wonder that some
 
folklorists take refuge in setting up theoretical models of
 
communicative dyads and stuff  like that.
 The other is just too
 
hard.
 
Folklore -
 I have realized over the years -
 is an unfinished
 
profession,  a profession within which there are still many areas
 
of argument and conflict,  a profession within which individuals
 
still have serious choices to make.
 And just as the individual
 
folklorist is required -
-
 by virtue of his membership within the
 
profession -
-
 to balance out the conflicting essentials of his
 
discipline,  so too is the discipline of folklore itself.
 
What this amounts to is that the American Folklore Society,
 
as well as the discipline of folklore itself,  as well as each
 
individual scholar within it,  must continually review its degree
 
of conformity with the essential payback requirement.
 And this
 
involves working out and maintaining a particular,  but ever
 
flexible creative balance between the responsibilities
 
previously mentioned:  field activity,  scholarly research,  the
 
academic classroom,  public presentation and administration.
 
(Assigning equal importance to administration may seem
 
surprising,  but if we are not already in a managerial world,  we
 
soon will be,  and every one had better learn how to work
 
effectively within it.
 The administrative skills required to
 
introduce a folklore
 
favorably with those
 
festival or regional
 
curriculum into a university compare very
 
necessary to organize a traditional arts
 
touring or traditional-artist-in-schools
 
residencies program.
 The latter,  indeed,  may require even more
 
sophisticated cultural and political deftness.)
 
Payback,  then,  functions as an overall principle,  or a state
 
of mind,  or a state of conscience,  perhaps.
 It has informed the
 
work of folklorists since Bishop Percy;  it is not a recent
 
invention.
 Its operation is especially visible today in the
 
near 1990's in the American Folklore Society where a turn
 
towards public presentation (always the clearest example of
 
payback)  has affected both the board and the conduct of the
 
annual meeting.
 
But what is now being termed by some "public sector
 
folklore"  and by others  "public folklore"  and by others "applied
 
folklore"  is not only a very democratic idea and therefore
 
ubiquitous,  it is an idea that has run through American
 
intellectual  life as well as its political  life for a long
 
time.
 It is an idea that has always baeen part of the
 
2
 
responsibility of the discipline,  in greater or lesser extent
 
according to the dictates of the period.

Almost one hundred years ago -
-
 to cite the example most
 
familiar to me -
-
 John A.  Lomax started his work in the
 
southwest very simply because he thought that the artistic
 
products and the basic points of view of the people who worked
 
the cattle ranges of his day deserved wide attention.
 He
 
thought everybody ought to know about their contribution and be
 
proud of it.
 He was strongly influenced by a kind of general
 
grass-roots populist philosopy that was wide-spread in his
 
younger years,  and in spite of various distorting collisions
 
with the fast-changing twentieth century,  that particular
 
philosophical grounding never left him somehow.
 
It was no sudden fascination with modern inventions or the
 
availability
 
brother Alan
 
presences of
 
of newly sophisticated hardware that led him and my
 
to believe that the actual voices,  the genuine
 
Americans should be heard via the use of sound
 
recording techniques as well as that their words should be
 
printed in books.
 They also maintained that Black people in the
 
south and Spanish-speaking people in the south-west needed some
 
help to get their presence felt too.
 And later my brother Alan
 
extended this idea to broadcast -
-
 a lovely word new-coined at
 
that time which means exactly what it says -
-
 those across the
 
entire nation through the Columbia Broadcasting System in some
 
of the earliest folk music radio programs of the century.
 
The Lomaxes were not alone of course.
 Members of that same
 
intellectual generation like Zora Neal Hurston,  Benjamin Botkin,
 
John Henry Faulk,  and Charles Seeger felt the same impulse,  not
 
only to collect but to broadcast.
 And their work -
-
 along with
 
that of some of the other great collectors of the period -
-
Vance Randolph,  Herbert Halpert,  George Korson,  Frank C.  Brown
 
-
-
 was generally supported by the American people, whether
 
through public or private means,  because of the general
 
understanding of the time that folklore had somehow to do with
 
common,  binding and healing principles.
 This is not a
 
fashionable thing to say now,  nor was  it then.
 But even as we
 
contemporary folklorists reject it as too unsophisticated,  it
 
remains our fundamental strength.
 
We went through a period of neglect of our public
 
responsibilities during the late 40's and 50's -
-
 a complicated
 
era following World War II when a worldwide thrust towards a
 
particularly specific kind of nationlism took a special turn in
 
the United States with the claim that a broad range of English
 
language traditional songs were,  indeed,  a kind of  long-lost
 
"national repertoire" of public American song.
 This movement,
 
sometimes referred to as the folksong revival,  occurred on the
 
heels of a shockingly intensive period of post-war political
 
repression -
-
 the "McCarthy era"  -
-
 and in many ways got much of
 
its emotional force from its attractiveness to the many citizens
 
who opposed the various blacklists and political phobias of the
 
day.
 Indeed,  if we did not have a genuine national repertoire
 
of song before,  this era provided us with a rather good one.
 
From the point of view of the folkloric discipline,  however,
 
as early as  1950 a great many prominent folklorists who had been
 
happily pursuing their uncontroversial researches into
 
historical and literary topics found themselves in danger of
 
being pushed to the frontlines of what promised to be a pretty
 
public and pretty bloody battle.
 A number of them,  including
 
some quite prominent ones,  did not like the prospect at all and
 
left for the libraries,  seminar rooms,  and lecture halls as
 
rapidly as possible.
 It is difficult to blame them.
 The
 
punishments for non-conformity at the time were extreme.
 But it
 
still was a good fight.
 A series of international conferences
 
spear-headed by the Folklore Institute in
 
demonstrates to this day how fiercely and
 
lines were drawn within the discipline.
 
Bloomington,  Indiana,
 
distinctly the battle
 
Their reports should be
 
read and re-read for inspiration and perspective.
 It was a good
 
fight,  but for the next twenty years -
-
 until the beginning of
 
the 1970's -
-
 the folklore world in the U.S.  grew essentially
 
silent in terms of its responsibilities for communicating its
 
theories,  materials and principles to the broad and general
 
public.
 
It was  indeed a long dry spell.
 And it has been followed,

as such periods always have been followed throughout history,  by
 
a period of intensive correction.
 As I have said before,  the
 
recent rise of interest within our discipline in the needs and
 
concerns of public folklore was as inevitable as the melting of
 
the glaciers or the inter-continental drift.
 The pay-back
 
principle keeps pushing us to correct our imbalances,  even if we
 
like them,  and even if we would feel much more comfortable to
 
stay skewed.
 
Today we see fifty of the states and territories of the
 
United States with their own public folklore programs; we see
 
many cities and towns with their own "friendly neighborhood
 
folklorist" or their own especial properly researched and
 
proudly presented local cultural event.
 We see an annual
 
Festival of American Folklife on the National Mall and a
 
round-the-year program emanating from the American Folklife
 
Center at the Library of Congress with its greatly enhanced
 
Archive of Folk Culture.
 We see the tentative development of
 
regional and other cultural programs that cross state lines,  the
 
increased presence of traditional performers in major public
 
media and live presentations,  of traditional crafts workers in
 
art museums.
 One of these days we may have to begin worrying
 
about an over-emphasis on public presentation...  but not yet
 
awhile...
 
So,  here we are today,  a hundred years after the birth of
 
1

/
 
the American Folklore Society,  still arguing,  still fussing with
 
each other over how to define folklore but knowing all the time
 
exactly what it is,  still balancing on the wobbly old
 
double-decker bus that leans one way now and another way
 
yesterday and will give us a good lurching shake-up tomorrow.
 
What pot holes  lie in wait?
 What course correction failures
 
will cause us to drift off the road?
 It is pretty clear
 
already,  I think, where our next problem areas  lie.
 Maybe,  if
 
we start a corrective action soon, we won't lean over too far.
 
During recent years,  it seems to me,  a trend has developed
 
of skimping the all-important base-line dirt-digging
 
foundation-laying act of scholarly research into the data of
 
folklore in order to satisfy our concerns with the particular,
 
the individualistic -
-
 with things  like process and context and
 
methodology and eliciting folk etymologies and biographical data
 
and local histories.
 You can hardly see the folklore for the
 
trees.
 Everything seems to be treated as a separate entity and
 
of equal importance with everything else.
 Everyone is a folk
 
(which of course is true to an extent)  and everyone is of equal
 
importance  (which of course is true to an extent)  and pretty
 
soon nothing means anything at all.
 
But folklore has always been in part about pattern.
 We are
 
not seeing the many thrilling patterns shining through so
 
clearly these days because we have,  I believe,  been neglecting
 
the need for a solid underlying knowledge of the data which can
 
clarify how and where a particular local tradition fits in.
 
Public folklorists -
-
 as well as all other kinds -
-
 have to know
 
(or find out)  that a fiddle player's tune that he calls  "
.  .  .
"
 is
 
more widely known in mappable regions as  "
-
-
-
"
 and they need to
 
know this for a number of reasons.
 Scholarly accuracy is one.
 
Copyright and other legal restrictions are another.
 The
 
possible development of an overview that links this group with
 
another group through history is another.
 Most important of
 
all,  in some ways,  is the empowerment of the individual fiddler
 
who learns that his tradition may be of significance not only to
 
himself  (he always knew it was pretty special)  but to his
 
children and to his culture.
 The interchanges between
 
folklorist and artist on such issues may seem trivial,  but they
 
are the common coin of public folklore.
 They must be taken very
 
seriously not only by the participants but by the discipline
 
itself.
 Most particularly,  the information exchanged must be
 
accurate and the most recent available.
 
I have compressed into the preceeding paragraphs a good many
 
warnings and cautionary remarks to my colleagues and my
 
discipline.
 But birthdays have their commemorative side as
 
well;  they can look back and forward and up and down.
 On the
 
occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the
 
American Folklore Society,  let me advise the Society,  the
 
discipline of folklore and every folklorist including myself in

pretty much the same way:
 
1)
 Don't get  lazy,  especially about research
 
2)
 Teach as much as you can when you can -

 broadcast.
 
3)
 Recognize that the job is as yet unfinished and
 
likely never will be.

Get out there and do some good hard field work.
 
That is where all your best ideas and your most
 
important knowledge are waiting for you.
 If you
 
do your work well folks will teach you back.
 
And so -
-
 good luck to us all in the century to come...  and
 
many many happy returns!
