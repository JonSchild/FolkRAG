VELL, HOW YOU WAS, ANYHOW? 
Sung with innnense success by America's favorite petite vocalist 
and soubrette, M ATTIE VICKERS. 
You bet I 
vas a 
smasher, 
Dcre's no high low Dutch about me; 
My style vas de latest 
Dat comes from Germany. 
My brutter paints bretzels, 
My fater he drinks beer, 
Und I 
sell bolognas, 
Cud dat is vy I 
vas here. 
Ctionus. 
Viii you buy my bolognas, 
Kind friends, will you buy? 
Dey are better as smeerkase 
Or limburger pie; 
Den I 
cotch all de smashers, 
Und about me dey will row, 
When all say, " Katarina, 
how you vas, anyhow?" 
I 
got a 
nice.scholzen, 
His name was .Takey Schitz; 
Yen he catches me smashing 
lie gives me de fits; 
But I 
can nicht help it, 
Und ven he makes a 
row, 
I 
say, " how you vas, Jakey, 
How you vas, anyhow?" 
Vere is de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
A 
burlesque recitation delivered by the great artiste comique, Miss 
MATTIE VICKERS. 
Yore is de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
Is it Ilobolicr, Weehawken, or de land 
Wnere beer does flow, 
Where bretzels grow, 
Is dot de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
Where is de Deutcher's Mutterland? 
Is it limburger, smeerkase, or de land 
Where bull pups do play 
Peenachel for beer all day, 
Is dat de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
Where is de Deutcher's Grantvaterland? 
Where de stale limburger can walk, 
lint de dogs in de sassages can talk, 
Yes, dot's de German's mutter-in-law land. 
Composed by DENNIS 0. MORETON, and sung by the Aimie of 
America, Miss MATTIE VICKERS. 
Oh, I 
am a 
young girl, just blushing sixteen, 
A 
leader of fashion as ' tis plain to be seen; 
At each ball and party I 
lead the dance, 
My style is bewitching and my ways do entrance. 
In the summer at Long Branch by the seaside I 
stray, 
Along with Alphonsus, so dashing and gay. 
Though I 
seem quite giddy and make out I'm shy 
I'm fond of flirtation when no one is by. 
Cnonus. 
There is no harm in flirting if only you're fly, 
And we all do it when no one is by; 
The girls say it's naughty and make out they're shy, 
But indulge in flirtations when_no one is by. 
Some day I'll get married, at least so I 
hope, 
But I'll not be tied by the connubial rope; 
If Alphonse or Augustus, or whoever weds me, 
Should chance to be jealous what a 
time there will be. 
For I 
cannot stop flirting, you know it's my style, 
And at each good looking young man I'm bound to 
smile; 
My dear will say it is naughty and about it will sigh, 
But with some strange girl he'll flirt when he thinks 
I 
ain't by.

Baby Now is Sleeping 'Neath Where the 
Roses Lie. 
Composed by DENNIS MORETON, and recited with terriffic applause 
and unlimited success by the premier mimic of the 
vaudeville stage, CHARLES S. 
ROGERS. 
To our home like summer sunshine baby came a 
year to-
day, 
Roguish smiles and pretty dimples round his pretty faco 
did play; 
He filled our hearts with gladness, he bound us with kt 
band of gold, 
And we dreamt bright, airy day dreams of happiness un-
told. 
How we loved our pretty darling we, who lost him, only 
know, 
For he now is calmly resting where the Summer roses grow. 
When first he came amongst us on his cheeks the roses 
bloomed, 
But a 
long and dreary sickness our helpless darling doomed. 
Day by day he wasted slowly as we watched by his crib's 
side, 
We saw that he was drifting with the awful tide. 
One day o'er death's dark river his wasted form did go, 
Baby now is calmly sleeping where the Summer roses grow. 
What a 
void he left behind, he who to us was so dear, 
And e'en the glorious Spring-time to our withered loves 
looks drear; 
But sometimes in fitful slumber his vanished form I 
see, 
And his smile of baby gladness in happy dreams I 
see. 
But alas! then, when I 
waken, I 
feel my bitter woe, 
For my baby boy is sleeping ' neath where the roses grow.

The Isle That's Crowned With Shamrock

Sang to great applause all over America by the refined and excel-
lent Motto and Swell Comic Vocalist, CHAs. II . 
DUNCAN.

France has got the Fleur-de-lis, 
And England's got the Rose; 
And Scotland for her Ensign, 
The Heather Thistle shows. 
But Ireland's got the Shamrock, 
in all her valley's seen; 
And ever wears upon her breast, 
The triple leaf of green. 
Cuonus: 
Then Irishmen remember, 
Wherever you may roam; 
The Isle that's crowned with Shamrock, 
Is still your native home. 
(Repeat). 
On many a 
foreign battle-field, 
It cheered the Irish boy; 
And won the brighest laurels, 
At glorious Fontenoy. 
Go where you will, from pole to pole, 
Where'er the Celt may be; 
You'll find he loves that dear old Isle, 
That sparkles in the sea. 
FONTENOY, • 
is sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
O 
TIA_VE 
you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to-day ; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and( 
runs 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning, 
Their dear old land to see ; 
Ind you and me, must ready be, 
To strike for liberty. 
CHORUS. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And we'll every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore ; 
And the dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more. 
And the tune we'll play, shall be Patrick's day 
And we'll play it o'er and o'er, 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more. 
tear, &c. 
We have begged of England long, my boys, 
But now we'll beg no more; 
No more like prowling hounds we'll crawl, 
Around our master's door. 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And soon we'll strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low. 
We'll Warr, it'd.

It's Really My Uncle; Now, " Make No 
Mistake." 
Dedicated to ALF. McDowell, by AL. W. FiLsoN. 
I 
am an unfortunate man, and my troubles l'll tell you 
About the girl I 
married, whom I 
thought was so true; 
But the way she deceived me was dreadfully awful, 
And the scheme that she practiced I'll now show to you: 
Last Wednesday night, when I 
went to my dwelling— 
I 
had been to the club, and got home rather late— 
As I 
entered the door a 
young man stood before me; 
My wife, to explain, says, " Allow me to state :" 
CHORUS. 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy ; it's only my uncle; 
Don't let this small matter keep you awake ; 
Don't work yourself up to a 
pitch of excitement, 
For it's really my uncle; now, make no mistake." 
She says that her uncle has a 
very large fortune, 
And that when he dies she'll inherit her share ; 
But his being at my house that time in the morning 
Don't look right to me—now, it don't, I 
declare. 
Now, when her dear uncle said : " I 
must be going," 
He kissed her three times ere he went on his way; 
I 
jumped to the door, determined to kill him, 
But my wife soothed my passion, as to me she did say: 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," &c. 
All the next day I 
felt very uneasy ; 
I 
did nothing at all but sit down and I 
moped ; 
But when I 
got home I 
had good cause for action, 
For my wife and her uncle they both had eloped, 
I 
rushed to my room, I 
was perfectly frantic, 
To see if some trace of her I 
couldn't find; 
But instead of that I 
there found a 
letter, 
- 
And in it were written the following lines : 
" 
Now my dear, don't get huffy," &c.

LION BREWERY BEER. 
A 
comic effusion sang by FRANK LEWIS, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, New York. 
The other night while feeling blue, 
I 
thought I'd stroll around; 
And see some of the famous sights 
With which this town abounds; 
A 
strange sensation thrilled me, 
And my throat felt dry and queer; 
So I 
stepped into a 
beer saloon, 
To get a 
glass of beer. 
I 
found it so refreshing, 
I 
thought I'd try one more; 
And liking the experiment, 
I 
repeated o'er and o'er; 
Some very funny fancies 
To my mind did soon appear. 
I'll tell you some of the sights I 
saw, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
I 
saw the waiters in this house, 
When schooners they did bring; 
Peep slyly through the door -to see 
If the Cap was on the wing; 
I 
saw spy Kimball on the train 
Where Whitney round did tear; 
Because he'd not appear in Court, 
And bring the gamblers there. 
Captain Williams in a 
garbage box, 
Was sentenced there to dwell; 
And stay until the Judgment day, 
And live upon the smell; 
The Salvation Army the other night 
Were off upon a 
tear, 
They were found up at Harry Hill's, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
We had no railroad accidents, 
And stocks were above par; 
Beecher kept a 
beer saloon, 
John B. Gough tended bar; 
I 
saw Conkiing commit suicide, 
When Jim Blaine won the race; 
When they both ran like Garfield's mid 
In his Cabinet for a 
place. 
Steve Taylor and George Hooke I 
saw, 
Fight the other day; 
That is, I 
would have seen them fight, 
But Taylor ran away; 
I 
saw the exhibition start, 
Which Grant is trying to stew; 
I 
saw our dirty streets kept clean 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
But there's one thing I 
will say; 
I 
hope I 
have amused you with 
My quiet little lay; 
I 
book it for a 
topic, 
To pass the time along; 
And try and sing you something new, 
In the way of a 
comic song. 
There's many times that I've appeared 
Before you one and all, 
A warm and loving welcome 
I've received from great and small; 
So to my New York friends 
I 
now return my thanks again, 
I'll drink your health in a 
social glass 
Of Lion Brewery Beer.

In the ebening by de moonlight, when dis darkey's woik 
was over, 
We would gather round de fire, till de hoe-cake it was 
done; 
Den we all would eat our supper, after dat we'd clear de 
kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare, to hab a 
little fun; 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down, dat hung upon de 
wall, 
While de silvery moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by the moonlight. 
CHORt78: 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear us darkies 
singing, 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear de banjo 
ringing; 
How de ofd folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In de ebening by de moonlight, when de watch-dog would 
be sleeping, 
In de corner near de fire-place, beside de old arm-chair; 
Whar Aunt Chloe used to sit and tell de piccaninnies sto-
ries, 
And de cabin would be tilled wid merry coons from near 
and far; 
All dem happy times we used to hab, will ne'er returA 
again, 
Eb'rything was then so merry, gay and bright; 
And I 
Lieber will forget it, when our daily toil was ober, 
How we sang in de ebening by de moonlight.

I'll Get Rid of my Mother-in-Law. 
16 
I'll Tell Nobody. 
As sung by EMMA ROGERS in the original sketch written 'by HARRY MC 
AVOY, entitled " Going to the Raffle." 
Oh, I 
am in love, but I'll not tell with whom, 
For I 
know very well what some folks would do— 
They'd chatter and flatter and make themselves fine, 
And poor little somebody have a 
sad time. 
CHORUS. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
tell nobody, nobody, no. 
If I'd tell it to one she would tell it to two, 
The next cup of tea they'd plot what they'd do. 
And as men have no constancy in their own minds, 
He'd seek a 
new face and leave some one behind. 
So I'll tell nobody, &c. 
But when I 
am sure that his heart's all my own, 
That he loves me sincerely and never will roam, 
Oh, then I'll defy all their jeers and their taunts, 
For it shows very plain what it is each of them wants 
CHORUS. 
They all want somebody, they're dying for somebody, 
Somebody, somebody, I 
know who. 
So I'll tell nol.ody, I'll tell nobody; 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no.

GEM OF THE SEA. 
Written by SCOTT SANDILAND. 
Music by JOHN W ALSH, and sung by 
M R. W ALSH with great success at Tony Pastor's Theatre, and 
Harry Miner's, N. Y. 
-:0: 
Greeks and Romans may boast of their ancient heroes, 
Philosophers, poets and orators, too; 
But although we have never had Homers or Nero's, 
Had they ever a 
prince like brave Brian Borne? 
A 
chieftain he was who made all the world fear us, 
In peace or in war he was dauntless and free; 
his shlagaun in battle oft-times did cheer us, 
lie died for his country the Gem of the Sea. 
CHORUS: 
Then hurrah for old Erin, the birthplace of beauty, 
Hurrah for her daughters so fair to be seen; 
Hurrah for her sons who in war do their duty, 
Hurrah for the shamrock, that plant ever green. 
And has for the poet on history's pages, 
One name, ' tis deeply engraved I 
am sure; 
His equal they never had in their dark ages, 
Long life to his memory, the gifted Tom Moore; 
Statesmen and patriots we've had in numbers, 
The brave Dan O'Connell remembered will be; 
And also poor Emmet, who in his grave slumbers, 
lie died for his country, the Gem of the Sea. 
Let them talk of philosophers, old Thiojaneurs, 
That some people said lived inside a 
tub; 
Compared to poor Paddy, we're certain quite green is, 
A smile, faith Pat has for the world's hardest rub; 
With his pine and his glassful of smoking potheen. 
Sure no king on his throne is as happy as he; 
He's true to his friends and his darling colleen, 
Sure he'd die for his country, the Gem of the Sea.

Duck-Foot Sue. 
DUTCH SONG AND DANCE, 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Oh, keep your seats a 
while, and I 
will sing to you 
The love I 
feel for a 
girl, they call ter duck-foot Sue. 
She is gentle and divine, long-waisted in the feet, 
Her heels stick out behind like a 
IS-karat beat. 
But now I 
sing to you of the girl I 
love so well, 
She is second-handed maid in a 
Chinese laundry away out 
in Kalamozan. 
Her beauty was all she had, she was sailed like the author 
of a 
shad; 
She had an India rubber lip, like the rudder of a 
ship ; with 
the razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat nor was she very thin, 
She looked when she was dressed like a 
straw in a 
barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to a 
ball to the Hordelyobel Club, 
I 
t 
cost me a 
ten cent stamp for to fill her up with grub. 
Her eyes were indigo blue, she'd a 
voice like a 
kangaroo. 
She could chin for an hour with a 
forty horse power, and 
whistle like a 
steamboat, too. 
She'd ears like a 
Japanese fan, and a 
voice like a 
catamaran. 
She was chief engineer in a 
hash factory ( jig) away out in 
Kalamozan.

For sure, und no mistake.

You've been out in dese country 
About seven years or less,

You ask me vat is it ?—Eh !—ho!— 
Veli

Written and sung by Miss Meocuz W ESTON in her great extravagam 
za entitled, " Dan Maloney's Raffle." 
Now here is my man, Dan-i-el, 
He comes from Donegal, 
Just look at his chin whiskers, 
Now don't he bate them all? 
And if he meets an old-time friend 
He'll always fill the can, 
And when ye seek for blooded stock, 
Dan Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS: 
Maloney's my man, now don't he look graniT 
He is down here to-night wid his cronies; 
At raffle or wake, sure he'll take the cake 
No man in the world is like Maloney. 
Sure he is no day labor3r, 
His debts he'll always pay; 
He hires all his men himself 
At five dollars a 
day. 
Now when the politicians 
They need a 
helping hand, 
They send for Dan for well they know 
Dan Maloney is the mail, 
DAILY NEWS, 
Written and sung by FORD Sz." K NOWLES, with great success at 
Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
There are quite a 
number of papers that are printed every 
day, 
And if you'll listen for a 
while, the names we'll give away. 
We'll start, then, with the N. Y. Clipper, it is the boss, you 
bet, 
It' pm want to read the sporting news that's the one to get. 
Then there is the Herald, the Tribune and the Sun, 
If the Truth was known the Star was printed before the 
World begun. 
But if you want to buy a 
spicy paper, and have no time to 
lose, 
Just call a 
boy from off the corner and get the Daily News. 
CHORUS. 
Daily News one cent, mister, won't you buy, 
That ' 4 
what the newsboys holler, no matter wet or dry. 
It will t 
11 you when the streets will be kept clean, 
And it. will drive away the blues, 
Et wid tell you when the Brooklyn Bridge will be done, 
In the little Daily News. 
Bernhardt and her coffin have arrived, but the news is 
stale, 
Ma- now they say she's stuck upon the editor of the Mail; 
The morning that she landed here, she got awful sick, 
Nml they made funny pictures of her in the Graphic, Puck 
and Chic. 
The Times says she's a 
darling, so does the Telegram, 
But the Commercial Advertiser says she's nothing but a . 
ham; 
tier and Clara Morris went out on a 
spree, and Sarah lost 
her shoes, 
And she went into a 
fit over the racket that she got in the 
Daily News.

Charming Little Lu. 
Sung only as a 
Song and Dance by FANNIE BEANE. 
'Twas at a 
fancy ball at St. James' Half, 
With the prettiest fellow in the nation, 
I 
at once did go, thinking there to show 
My dancing skill, and gain his approbation, 
But, strange to say, I 
dared not dance, 
Nor could I 
leave my seat, 
Though poor dear Gussy came to me. 
And thus he did entreat: 
CHORUS. 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
In the mazy polka and the lanciers? 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
And mingle with the merry, merry dancers ? 
When we left the hall, I 
then told him all 
Of my sad determination, 
And, like all the rest, I 
did try my best 
To keep down all his rash indignation. 
My hair-pins gone, my braids were loose, 
To dance I 
did not dare; 
My chignon surely would come off, 
And make the people stare. 
SPOKEN.— Of 
course when I 
informed Gussy, dear, that I 
was liable to lo,e all my back hair if I 
danced, he could not 
do otherwise than say— 
Clever little Lu, that was brave of you, 
iiN:ot to (
lance the polka or the lanciers, &c.

BILLY'S REQUEST. 
As sung by Mr. Binny Bincit for two years with tremendom: success 
Give my top and string to brother, 
Mamma, when I'm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
In my little bed; 
If the job is like to throw him, 
When the string he jerks; 
Get some little boy to show him, 
How the old thing works. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Give my chewing-gum to sister, 
I 
don't want it more; 
On my gums it raised a 
blister, 
They are awful sore; 
Give away my ragged jacket, 
Mamma, don't you cry; 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, 
In the sweet bye-and-bye. 
Repeat last two lines, 
Tell our neighbors that his billy goat, 
Causing all my rips; 
When he bounced me, oh, dear mother, 
I 
passed in all my chips, 
Though your sou forgives him, mother_ 
Give him all my wealth; 
hit him with a 
ripe tomato, 
You know how it is yourself. 
Repeat la--t 
two lines. 
35 
BILLY'S REQUEST—CONTINUED. 
Roll me up in nice light pie-crust, 
Slather me over with jam; 
Hit me with a 
hundred eream ,cakes, 
And bounce me with a 
ham; 
Take me to our old-time clam-bake, 
Sheepshead, lobster and gin; 
Drown me in a 
watermelon, 
Then wipe off my chin. 
Repeat last two lines 
Let me bruise my little brother, 
Once before I 
go; 
Let me hit him on the smeller, 
Mamma, don't say no; 
Let me Grxco-Roman wrestle, 
I'll do my level best; 
Let me bust his new suspenders, 
Then pull down his vest. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Sprinkle me over with powdered sugar, 
Smear me over with tar; 
Spatter me over with nice duck-feathers, 
I'll be an angel, ma; 
Let ine bite the old cat's tail off, 
He can't catch no mice; 
Give me a 
dose of bitter water, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Originally sung by him with great success. 
Just keep your seats awhile, 
And I 
will tell to you 
Of the love I 
used to feel 
For a 
gal named Duck Foot Sue. 
She was gentle and divine, 
Long waisted in the feet, 
Her heel stuck out behind 
Like an eighteen karat beat. 
CHORUS. 
So now I'll tell to you 
Of the gal I 
loved so true, 
She was second hand mate in a 
Chinese laundry 
Out in Kalamazoo. 
Her beauty was all that she had, 
She was built like a 
North river shad, 
She'd an india rubber lip 
Like the rudder of a 
ship, 
With a 
razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat, 
Or either was she thin, 
She looked when she was dressed 
Like a 
straw in a 
barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to the ball 
Of the Hardly Able Club, 
It cost a 
ten case note 
For to fill her up with grub. 
BILLY CARTER'S DUCK FOOT SUE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
She'd an eye like a 
hard shell clam, 
And a 
voice like a 
catamaran. 
She could chin for an hour 
At a 
forty-horse power, 
And an ear like a 
Japanese fan, 
Her hair was an indigo blue, 
She was graceful as a 
kangaroo, 
You ought to hear a 
rustle 
With her patent rubber bustle, 
She could whistle like a 
steamboat too. 
But since she ran away, 
I've almost lost my breath, 
If she travels on her shape, 
She's sure to starve to death. 
If I 
had married her 
I'd almost been afraid 
Of being shot or scalped 
By the mother-in-law brigade. 
CHORUS. 
For she was a 
funny old guy, 
With a 
double-barreled squint in her eye, 
Her number ten feet 
Used to cover up the street, 
She'd a 
mouth like a 
crack in a 
pie, 
She'd a 
cheerful cemetery laugh 
And a 
head like a 
Mexican calf, 
She's an iron clad clipper built gun boat brig, 
With a 
feather on her maintop gaff.

THE SHEENIES ON OUR BLOCK.

0 :---
Words by J. M. JOHNSON, and Sung with great success by 
JOFINSON & SWAIN. 
If you ask for sonic amusement, 
Why just come with me to-day, 
We'll walk along Pacific Street, 
Down towards the Bay; 
Such sights for you will there be found, 
But nothing that will shock; 
You'll laugh your sides to splinters at 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Cohens and the Lowens, 
From old Jerusalem, 
There's the Keysers and the Peysers 
From salt-fish Amsterdam; 
Of all the second-handed brokers 
They keep the finest stock., 
They've horrible pugs, and oh, what mugs, 
These Sheenies on our block. 
CHORUS: 
Little Mosey Gumplestein, 
Sitting in the sun; 
Laughing, shouting, 
For any kind of fun, 
Rise, Mosey, rise, 
Wipe your nose off with your sock; 
And when you're big, you'll represent 
The Sheenies on our block. 
THE SHEENIES ON OUR BLOCK— CONTINUED. 
If you're in for speculation, 
Why that's the place to go; 
You'll find the greatest bargains, 
They've everything to show. 
From boots and shoes, coats and pants, 
To a 
rusty key and lock, 
Business is always tremendous with 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Lesynskys, and Greezynkys 
From Poland far away, 
7-he Jacobs and the Josephs 
From Germany a 
day. 
They came in ' 49, 
Reular old time rocks; 
The town's a 
curiosity with 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There is Solomon Isaac Levy, 
Who learned the Tailor trade; 
He has the largest family, 
The youngest just a 
babe. 
Twenty-one girls, two dozen boys, 
They live on the smell of hock: 
They're the rising generation of 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Meyers, and the Mayers, 
They've got their business down; 
The Schlosses, and the Grosses, 
Who are so fat and sound. 
You can get just what you want there, 
Even old Granny's clock; 
Such enterprising colonists are 
The Sheenies on our block.

JUST A LITTLE TOO FAR. 
Written and Sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
suppose you have noticed some folks are peculiar 
And never can they well enough let alone, 
But matters still push of results irregardless, 
Until every prospect completely has flown. 
Advice that is given they pass quite unheeded, 
They think they've been born 'neath some bright lucky star, 
Until when to the fact I 
have named they awaken 
And find they have gone just a 
little too far. 
Now the big ferry line which leads over to Brooklyn 
Has adopted a 
scheme the newsboys to defeat, 
And also prevent them from retailing tickets, 
While honestly earning their bread in the street. 
The ferries are owned by a 
rich corporation; 
For the poor children's suffering they don't seem to care— 
The greater their wealth the more grasping their natures, 
But I 
think they have gone just a 
little too far. 
We've been bothered some time with an Excise Commission, 
Whose actions I 
think you'll pronounce very queer, 
They have strained every point to refuse dealers license 
And thus to deprive us of our Sunday beer. 
Our Teutonic friends they are greatly excited, 
And strongly they kick 'gainst the vile excise law, 
And express their opinions in terms very bitter— 
" 
Dose tam oxcise pizfle84 vas goin' to far." 
Now there Henry Ward Beecher our most noted preacher, 
Who was foolish enough but last summer to say, 
hat a 
poor laboring man should provide for his family 
Upon the small sum of a 
dollar a 
day, 
But if ever he practiced the doctrine he preaches, 
A 
great change would sure come to this divine star, 
And as he was feasting upon " bread and water" 
He'd find he had gone just a 
little too far. 
I 
suppose the old " Tammany Ring" is forgotten 
Which once ran New York in its own private way, 
But the justice adminstered unto its leaders 
Has been badly mixed I 
am sorry to say; 
Genet, and Sweeney are taking things easy, 
With no chilling prospect their pleasures to mar, 
While generous old Bill Tweed is lying in prison. 
Now I 
think this has gone altogether too far. 
Last evening I 
got myself into a 
pickle, 
When my hearts dearest object I 
dropped in to see. 
On the sofa together we were cozily sitting 
And I 
am afraid I 
was almost too free, 
For she sprang to her feet with her eyes fairly blazing, 
Said she " you just ' skip' or Ill call my papa." 
I 
tried hard to square it but she would'nt have it, 
She said " I 
had gone just a 
little too far."

Och 'hone, I'm desarted sure, 
My looks they are demure, 
My fair form is fading fast away; 
The rose has left my cheek, 
With sorrow I 
can't spake, 
The choking sobs they bother night and day. 
I 
once was fat and fair, wid purty yaller hair, 
Me eyes they were the brightest, so they say; 
But when Dinny stole my heart, 
Soon my beauty did depart, 
And I'm lonesome since my darlin wilt away. 
Cnottus 
Oh he's gone! gone! gone! 
Will he ever more return? 
I 
never can forget the parting day. 
SPOKEN.—Och hone! mavrone; 'twas a 
sorry day that 
ever I 
saw the like; and when my mother kern home, she 
sez to me, What the divil is the child crying—crying for? I 
was just in from Mahony's with a 
quarter o'butter, wihen 
Dinny fell in the river and came home so dry that he ate 
all the salt there was in the house to make him thirsty. 
Who should pop in the week before, but—What the divil 
is the matter wid me shoe? 
There's something in there be-
sides me foot. 
Ah! its no wonder I'm a 
poor widdy, wid 
me husband away to the salt say, and his poor little orphan 
childer crying, " Father, dear Father come home, sweet 
home, there's no place like any where else; but there's 
somthing in my shoe along wid me foot. 
I'll shake it out. 
Dance and sing. 
Since he stole away me heart, 
My beauty did depart, 
And I'm lonesome now my darlin's gone away. 
IRISH GRASS WIDOW'S LAMENT—CONTESTED. 
We were married just a 
year, 
When a 
big ship did appear, 
And the Captain ' listed Dinny dear from me; 
He used to send his pay in a 
letter ' cross the say," 
But the sorra letter now I 
ever see; 
" 
P'haps he may be kilt, and his darlin blood be spilt 
Or scalped, or blown up in a 
bat-ter-rie; 
May be he's another wife and deserted me for life, 
But I'm lonesome since my darlin wint away. 
But he's gone, etc. 
SPOKEN.—My 
darlin boy was called Dinny Dan after 114 
Father, 
lie was a 
bouncing, beautiful, bulky, baby-boy. 
purty, pratling picture of his mother, barin his fair, fresh 
face favors his Father's flushed features. 
Some say he 
smiles sweetly; Adorn sick, sore or sorry. He sings sweet, 
singular sounds of song. 
When he's ould enough, I 
will 
make him seek his Father. Och hone! Dinny, I 
wish I 
was 
a 
bird. 
I'd fly to you; I'd grab you by the top-knot, and 
drop you down. Oh Dinny, darlin, dadda's deserted 
Dinny, drive dirty donkeys, dare drown dry dogs, drink 
dripping dew drops, dine on dangers dishes, deliver di. 
abolical clams to delicious dinners, draw dangerous dirks 
and darts, dance down deep dells? 
Quick Dance. 
Since you stole away my heart, etc.

Music by E. A. 
KIECIIOEFFOR.. 
Oh, here we are together, now, 
Two Irish Immigrants; 
Roger and Hanorah. 
We can do a 
reel or jig, 
Or an Irish song or dance; 
We are right from Connemara. 
When we first came to this country, 
Why we didn't have a 
cent; 
Leaving father and our mother, 
To please you all is our intent. 
Our feelings you all smother. 
Symphony.- 011, it's many a 
load of turf we dug 
On dear old Erin's Isle, 
And raised a 
decent family 
In true born Irish style. 
CHORUS: 
Arrah look at Roger,—Sym. 
Now there's my Peter,—Sym. 
We just came o'er the deep blue sea; 
Just look at my Peter,—Sym. 
Oh, you're a 
darling,—Sym. 
We just arrived in America. 
48 
THE IRISA COVES.—CONTINUTED. 
Now before we leave you all, 
We hope that you'll excuse; 
Roger and Hanorah. 
And when we do return, 
We hope you won't refuse; 
This pair from Connemara. 
Arrah soon we will take the train, 
To the town of Omaha; 
In the mighty far off West, boys, 
And we will bid a 
sad adieu to Erins Isle agra. 
This pair from Connemara. 
Syrophony.—So now before we leave ye all, 
And bid every one adieu; 
We will try a 
little dancing, 
In these old Broganic shoes. 
CHORUS! 
There's my Roger,—Sym. 
Ain't she a 
codger,—Sym. 
We just came o'er the deep blue sea; 
She is a 
daisy,—Sym. 
He has me crazy,—Sym. 
We just arrived in America,

When he told me that be loved me, 
'T was the flow'ry time of May; 
I 
put roses in my ringlets, 
And went singing all the dt4r, 
When he told me that lie loved me, 
In the pleasant month of May. 
Yes; because I 
knew he loved me 
I 
went singing with the birds. 
All the day I 
listened to him, 
In my dreams I 
heard his words; 
Dreaming nightly that he loved me 
I 
was blither than the birds! 
Dreaming nightly that he loved me 
T 
was blither than the birds. 
But I 
did not know I 
loved him 
Till I 
found one Summer day 
That in telling how he loved me 
He had wiled my heart away, 
Just by saying how he loved me 
Through the long bright Summer day. 
Still he told me that he loved me 
When the roses fading fell, 
And the birds had all forgotten 
That sweet song I 
learned too well, 
For I 
love him and he loves me 
More than any words can tell, 
For I 
love him and he loves me 
More than any words can tell.

COOPER, Esq.

FRENCH, Esq. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 24 •Vesey street, New York, 1879. 
'Twas in the golden summer days 
We met beside the brook, 
The birds were singing happy lays 
In every shady nook. 
But sweeter far than songs of birds 
The gentle voice that fell, 
And what was told in whispered words 
I 
should not care to tell. 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
in summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
Down beside those silver streams, ( Break.) 
I Have we lingered in happy dreams; ( Break.) 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
in summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow. (Dance.) 
Twilight shades were in the sky 
Before we bade adieu; 
I 
heard a 
tender little sigh, 
And knew one heart was true. 
The little birds had gone to sleep, 
Soft dew-drops kissed the flowers, 
And never stars began to peep 
On h-ppier hearts than ours. 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow.

Private Affair of my Own.

FILSON, 
and sung by him with unbounded success. 
0 I'm the prince of gay young fellows 
Who possesses enormous wealth, 
And for those who do not know me 
I 
will introduce myself. 
I'm the favorite of the ladies, 
Refined and quite high-toned, 
My name I 
hope you will excuse 
For reasons of my own. 
SPOKEN—Yes, ladies, and gentlemen, I 
would like to tell 
you my name, but you see it might cause a 
slight misunder-
standing between several lady friends of mine. 
Oh, nothing 
wrong, I 
can assure you, I 
would tell you my name this even-
ing, but you see I 
couldn't, because it's— 
CHORUS. 
A 
private affair of my own, 
It's a 
private affair of my own, 
And it would not be right to tell you to-night, 
For it's a 
private affair of my own. 
Last evening at a 
party 
In the surburbs of this town, 
My heart was really smitten 
By a 
pair of eyes so brown; 
PRIVATE AFFAIR OF MY OWN. 
Continued. 
Her voice it quite bewitched me, 
When I 
heard her play and sing, 
Then a 
handkerchief flirtation, and— 
Oh well, all that sort of thing. 
SPOIZEN—Yes, I 
met the dear creature at the party, was 
introduced to her, & c., & c., and we became busily engaged in 
an earnest conversation. 
I 
made the proposal, she accepted 
--poor thing. 
I 
then called for some ice cream, soda water, 
and one thing and another. 
She then proposed a 
ride; it was 
agreeable, so I 
called a 
carriage. 
We got in, and we were 
driven to—well I 
would like to tell you where the carriage 
did take us, but I 
couldn't because— 
It's a 
private affair, & c. 
Well, we reached our destination, 
And we hastened to alight, 
Eur the ice cream and the soda 
Had affected my eye- sight. 
We called for more beer and oysters, 
Oh, you have all been there before, 
If not you can easily find the place 
By the number above the door. 
SPOKEN—Yes, we had just got comfortably seated when, 
on looking up, I 
beheld my astonished wife standing before 
me, whom I 
had left home three hours before. 
She uttered a 
piercing shriek, and throwing her arms aloft she exclaimed, 
"Sir, what does this mean, that beer, those oysters, that 
woman; explain yourself, sir, explain !" 
I 
arose with rather 
an unruffled expression upon my countenance and another 
upon my shirt-collar, and I 
said, " My dear, (
hic) can't you 
(hie) see, it's nothing ( hic)but— 
A 
private affair, & c,

Composed and sung by,WiLLIANt A. 
H UNTLEY. 
When the purple lilacs blossom, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the robin and the bluebird 
Greet us with a 
sweet refrain? 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
CHORUS. 
In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling. 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
- 
In the soft, &. c 
When in Heaven with the angels, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain ? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

great success by HARRY NicAvor. 
" 
Ring down the curtain I" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimm'd each sorrowing eye; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life: 
" 
It's no use s God bless you! Good-bye !" 
CHORUS. 
"Ring down the curtain !" 
Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high ! 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep; 
" 
it's no use, God bless you, God bless you, good-bye!' 
" 
Ring down the curtain l" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew. 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever rntist sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
"It's no use, God bless you! Good-bye !"

POOR OLD UNCLE TOM." 
Written and composed by W. J. 
GROGAN, and sung by him 
with great success in his sketch, " Uncle Tom's Return." 
111Y joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bi ight in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORUS. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apart, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
CHORUS. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When at prayer you kneel, a 
prayer then yield 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom.

IIITcucocx, 1881, 166 Nassau Street, New York. 
Sent by Mail on receipt of 10 cents. 
Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, 
1 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
Por the sake of the past and the love you once bore me, 
Oh 'twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching, 
A 
voice in my heart pleads in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but for you? 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken, 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
But my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whateer unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. (Chorus).

'TIS ONLY DONE FOR A SHOW. 
Words and Music by Roy LESLIE. 
My name is Augustus Smithers, 
I 
am a 
young man about town, 
I'm admired by all the young ladies, 
From the hair of my head to the ground, 
They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
How I 
live they all want to know, 
I 
tell them my pa pa is a 
banker, 
But I 
only do it for show. 
CHOR 
us. 
There is nothing in the world like appearaace 
When you are broke don't let them know, 
You hold the winning hand 
When dressed as a 
gentleman, 
But ' tis only done for a 
show. 
I 
met a 
young lady this morning, 
While taking a 
stroll on the street, 
She was dressed in the height of fashion, 
With shoes too small for her feet, 
Her teeth were false and so was her hair, 
Her cheeks (with paint) were aglow, 
I've heard her pa pa was a 
dealer in rags. 
But she only does it for show. 
You will see a 
young man with an ulster, 
Cutting a 
swell on the street, 
He will say his " uncle" is wealthy, 
When in fact he's had nothing to eat, 
What kind of clothes lie has under 
None of us will know, 
But we do know he has a 
clean collar and cuff, 
But he only wears them for show. 
There are rich men who live in our city, 
Whose thousands roll in at their feet, 
Who hold the front pew on a 
Sunday, 
And scorn at the wretch in the street, 
Sometimes he has a 
cause to be liberal, 
- 
Through the papers large sums he bestows, 
'Tis not from the heart that Le gives it, 
For he does it only for show,

Many a 
night on the silent deck, 
Have I 
gazed on the stars above, 
And I've looked abroad on the tranquil sea, 
Till my heart was filled with love, 
Thinking of home and the dear ones there, 
Till I 
felt the tear drops flow, 
Breathing in silence a 
fervent prayer, 
For the friends of long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home; 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home. 
Father and mother and sister dear, 
Come to me in my waking dreams, 
And I 
hear a 
voice and I 
see a 
face, 
Which to me like an angel seems. 
Ah, did I 
not give her my parting vow, 
And the broken ring to keep ? 
Spirit of beauty, hear me now, 
As I 
sigh upon the deep. 
Many a 
night, & c. 
But proudly the flag of Columbia waves 
Wherever the salt seas flow, 
To the frozen deep or burning clime 
Her sons will gladly go, 
Doing and daring in her dear name 
All that man can do or dare, 
Thinking of home I 
have longed for fame 
For the sake of the kind hearts there. 
Many a 
night, &c. 
The Masher. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME. 
Who is it that we meet each day 
On the Bowery, or Broadway, 
That dresses in a 
style so gay? 
The Masher. 
Who is it that is on the mash, 
In his pockets you will find no cash, 
And he often goes without his hash ? 
The Masher. 
Who smiles upon the girls so sweet 
Whenever he meets them on the street, 
And his washerwoman he is sure to beat ? 
The Masher. 
Who is it knows the free lunch route, 
Where he eats his fill and then gets out, 
And says high living gives him the gout ? 
The Masher. 
Who is it that often makes the remark 
He spends hundreds of dollars while out on a 
lark, 
And for the want of a 
bed has to sleep in the Park

NEW YORK. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
U is a Pao simile of a Trick practiced by ail. 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orde; 
has been sent us, called $173.1PrY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly-over, can make it ap, 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand.., 
king of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
