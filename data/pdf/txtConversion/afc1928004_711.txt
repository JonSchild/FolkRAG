THAT 'S WHAT I 
SAID. 
Written by Jos. PErriNoitt. of the " American Four," and sung by the 
celebrated comedian, GEORGE 
RENWAY. 
THERE'S a word now much used 
In the slang of the tunes— 
I'll make it the subject 
Of a 
few foolish rhymes; 
You hear it so often 
That it bothers your head, 
This new slam , expression— 
" 
Ali, that's what I 
said." 
ioPXS. 
"Ali. that's what I 
said," 
You hear from each belle; 
Thats what I 
said.'' 
Is remarked by each swell. 
On the street. on the horse car, 
Wide awake or in bed, 
You bear this expression— 
" 
That's what I 
said." 
When I 
go on a 
bender 
I 
think I 
can 112..lit, 
But I 
was sadly mistaken 
Last Wednesday night; 
He made a 
football 
Out of my poor soft head; 
Says I, " Please don't kill me." 
He says, " That's what I 
said." 
"All, that's what I 
said," etc. 
I 
once courted a 
lady, 
She called me hot' pet, 
And lily last dollar 
From me she did get: 
But when my cash was gone 
I 
101111(1 1101' Me was dead. 
I 
asked her why she shook me, 
She says, •"I'llat's what I 
said." 
-All, that's what I 
said," etc.

OH. IT'S NO USE. 
Original, by Goss and Pox. 
On, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for they can never beat 
our time, 
We're too soon to let the white folks get ahead. 
Oh, it's no use, it's no use, for we are coons from Caro-
line, 
And we're bound to shout and holler till we're dead. 
We arc two stylish nigs from Carolina, 
Now what's the use of trying to outshine us ? 
Oh, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for we are coons from 
Carolina, 
And we're bound to shout and holler till we're dead. 
Oh, it's no use, it's no use, so throw your hands above 
your head, 
Put your toe and heel down hard upon the floor ; 
Oh, it's no use, oh, it's no use, we kill the white folks 
almost dead, 
And there aint no use of shouting any more. 
We are two stylish figs from Carolina, 
Now, what's the use of trying to outshine us ? 
Oh, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for we are coons from Car.

And the place we've not forgot,

With a

Come out here, Cloey Primrose, come out, you little 
queen, 
Come out here, Cloey Primrose, and dance here on the 
green.

We'll drive the gospel engine, 
We'll chive dull care away, 
We'll sing and dance with hearts so light, 
While the band does sweetly play. 
When we go out to promenade we make the white folks 
Arm- in-arm we go along, you bet we put on style, 
Down on the green where we'll be seen, we'll make the 
leather shake, 
Hand in hand 
we lead them all a 
walking for the cake. 
Put on style, Cloey Primrose, I'll do just as I 
please, 
Put on style, Cloey Primrose, and we'll dance here on 
the green.

On, there is a 
little yaller gal, 
Her name is Mary Simpson, 
She's sweet and neat, 
My brain she set all in a 
whirl; 
I 
asked her to marry, 
I 
couldn't tarry: 
"Go way, you crazy nigger, 
Don't take me Co,. a 
fool." (
Break.) 
Oh my! my love she is a 
yaller gal, 
Oh my ! I 
tell you she is sweet, 
Oh my ! I 
love her to distraction, 
Pretty little darling, with her big flat feet.-
I 
took her to a 
fancy ball, 
In the dance she was the worst of all ; 
She slipped and kicked, 
And fell flat upon the floor ; 
She up with her foot 
And kicked me in the jaw; 
Then there was a 
fight 
Which busted up the ball. 
Oh my ! my love, etc.

THE DANDY COLORED MASHERS. 
As performed and suing by the Irresistible Eccentrics, the " American 
Four." 
No use talking. we are gorgeous, 
Double X and superfine; 
When we dress up in our latest, 
You can bet we cut a 
shine; 
Swallow-tail pants and stand-up collars, 
Shoes that look like cords of wood, 
We are the dandiest colored mashers 
In our high-toned neighborhood. 
CHORE'S. 
Don't you see the wenches smiling 
When we take a 
promenade? 
For we dandy colored mashers 
Throw our rivals in the shade. 
When the sun is brightly shining 
We go strolling through the park, 
"They're pink rosebuds of fashion," 
The colored ladies all remark: 
With our walking canes, so nobby, 
We're considered quite la-de-da. 
And to all the daisy wenches 
We throw hisses—Ta-ta-ta. 
Don't you see, etc. 
THE STOVE PIPE 
(OF BEER.) 
Words by M . 
J. 
W ILTON. 
"I'Is not of a 
pipe that tinuers make, 
I'm going to sing to you; 
'Tis not of a 
pipe that smokers smoke, 
When tilled with honey-dew ; 
I 
do not sing of an old meer-sham 
To my friends assembled here ; 
But of a 
pipe one loves to quail— 
A 
big stove pipe of beer. 
REFRAIN. 
Then lift up high the foamy glass. 
And drink success to trade ; 
I 
wouldn't give a 
stove pipe beer 
For the best champagne that's made. 
(Repeat refrain.) 
Some love to drink the sparkling wine, 
From Germany's far-off land ; 
While others will drink a 
stronger drink 
As long as they can stand; 
But give me what's better still 
Than wine made far from here. 
You drink your wine, I'll take in mine 
A 
stove pipe glass of beer. 
Then lift up high, etc. 
WHEN THE ROBINS NEST AGAIN , 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS in the 
American Four)! 
Alter pieco. 
I

I 
will come back, my love, to thee; 
When nature smiles on land and sea, 
I 
will return again to t'nee. 
Virh ,n 
the robins nest again, 
And the flowers are in bloom. 
When the springtime's sunny smile 
Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom, 
Then my bonny blue-eyed lad, 
If my heart is true till then, 
Has promised he'll return to me, 
When the robins nest a!rain. 
Life seems so bright when in thought I'm with thee, 
Come, love. hasten—come back to me; 
We'll build our nest with the robins in springtime, 
Donald: return, love, to me. 
When the robins nest 
And the flowers are in bloom, 
When the springtime's sunny smile 
Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom; 
Then my bonny blue-eyed lad, 
If my heart is true till then, 
Has promised he'll return to me 
When the robins nest again. 
Last night in a 
dream 
I 
saw his proud ship wrecked at sea, 
And I 
felt that my heart's dear love 
Could never come back to me. 
But the springtime and robins will come, 
And with them the bravest of men, 
For his last \words were, Darling, I'll meet you 
When the robins nest again. 
When the robins nest again, etc. 
ON 
ROAD. 
Written by Cn.i.riLn3 F. 
JEROME. 
I TELL - you, it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop 
right here, 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, and the man-
ager I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got 
no money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get 
so funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board bill's up 
to- day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip 
away; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only 
got one collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I 
owe him 
just one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch a 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to-night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him 
dead to rights; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to 
do, 
And tell them not to wash up until they get their money, 
too, 
And tell that " serio-comic queen " she'd better write for 
dates. 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her 
. 
rival—" Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not be afraid, 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade, 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and 
stow this " beat," 
.For he may think, as others do. that actors never eat; 
And I know that I eat regular—that is, when I'm at 
home, 
And wheh I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will 
roam.

SWEET LITTLE BABIES. 
FERIO-COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Writttn and Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. Music; by J. P. STU:M.71% 
The Music of this Song is published by EVANS 8: Dna., 50 Bromfield 
Street, Boston, Mass. 
Copyrighted, 188'2, by W. A. Evans & Bro. 
Some married men enjoy themselves, 
By being away from home, 
And some with their dogs all through the day 
They through the woods will roam. 
Some for their pets have little birds, 
But for one thing I 
sigh, 
For music sweet, and joy complete, 
Give me the babies cry! 
Sweet little babies, dear little babies, 
Squaling and brawling all through the day; 
Rosy-faced babies, troublesome babies; 
With the dear babies I 
love to play. 
To hear the babies screaming loud, 
Is music to my ear, 
I 
take them in my arms and say: 
"Oh, Tooksie, Nooksie, dear!" 
I 
dance them gaily on my knee, 
And make them laugh with joy, 
While they rub taffy over me, 
And my necktie destroy.

SWEET LITTLE BABIES.—Concluded. 
Where'er I 
go, it is the same, 
The babies I 
adore, 
I 
love to hear their noisy cries, 
While sprawling on the floor; 
Then I 
go walking in the Park, 
I 
take one on each arm, 
And though some folks may laugh at me— 
I 
think it's quite a 
charm. 
Spoken.—If there is anything I 
do like it's babies, with 
their heads like billiard balls, and they are always trying to 
swallow their fists; I 
remember our first baby, he wasn't 
much larger than a 
minute, and hadn't any more teeth than 
the sign " BEFORE" in a 
dentist's window; he hadn't been 
in the house three days, before he owned more of the house 
than I 
did; he had fat rosy- cheeks, and his face looked se 
much like a 
raw ham that you'd have to guess where his 
eyes were, and when he'd cry, he'd turn as red as sun-down; 
and he could cry loud too; 'twas impossible to get any sleep 
when he was crying. I 
could sleep better in a 
boiler factory 
when they are doing overwork; I 
wouldn't care for the cry-
ing so much if the baby would only change the key once in 
a 
while, a 
baby crying for four hours in A MINOR gets mon-
otonous. 
Then it had Croup, Measles, &c., & c. Oh, a 
baby 
is a 
fine thing to keep a 
man broke,—but still they are a 
great comfort if they don't come too thick; now there's our 
last addition—twins, they never cause us any trouble, if they 
do I 
always sing— 
Sweet little babies, dear little babies, 
Squaling and brawling all through the day; 
Rosy-faced babies, troublesome babies; 
With the dear babies I 
love to play.

OFFICER REILLY'S CLUB. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE 
WM. 
On, there was a 
gang of spellers, 
Who on the corner stood; 
They'd take in all the balls and hops, 
Brace every place they could. 
They'd no ticket of admission, 
And would hang up for their grub, 
Till at Hogan's ball their heads were broke 
By Officer Reilly's club. 
There was brocky-faced young Doolan 
And old Pat I'lloylan's sons, 
With cross-eyed Teddy Leary, 
In their stockings carried guns ; 
There was jealous-leg Maguffin, 
Who around the room did prance, 
Till Reilly socked him in the ear, 
And knocked him in a 
trance. 
Now tobacco juice 'was flowing— 
Miss Burke was almost dead; 
Rough Crogau ran between her feet, 
And stood her on her head. 
She shouted inelia murder, 
Some one struck her in the gob ; 
_Pe heavens ! I 
would take an oath, 
It was Officer Reilly's club. 
There was brocky-faced, eta. 
Faith, the gang all makes for Reilly— 
He had all that he could do ; 
His nose was like a 
pudding, 
And his eyes were black and blue. 
Oh, they pulled the shirt clean off him 
And the legs out of his pants, 
And fired him out upon the floor 
To do them a 
song and dance. 
There was brocky-faced, etc. 
STICK TO IT., 
Words by :kr. J. 
WILTON. 
W HEN you promise another, " stick to it," 
No matter what others may say; 
By keepin ,
ir your word, learn to do it 
You'll find it to be the best way. 
There are some. who forget all about it 
As soon as a 
promise they've made; 
And some. .‘ 
know nothing about it "— 
Its fulfillment they wish to evade. 
Then stick to it, and you'll do it: 
Such words you've olten heard. 
Don't give up. you've time enough 
To keep your plighted word. 
Don't promise and then fail to do it; 
'Tis easy to say, " I 
will try:" 
Don't view it, as others may view it, 
By passing it heedlessly by; 
But say, " Believe me, I'll do it," 
And then do the best that you can. 
The world will smile approbation, 
And say, " You're the right kind of man." 
Then stick to it, etc. 
THE FISNIP4RMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom Dxxox, at the San Francisco Minstrels. 
" 
THE fisherman and his child are drowned !" 
Came ringing through the town ; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around. 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
" 
Oh, God ! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
cee." 
(Repeat last two lines_) 
'Twas the voice of their Goa that they heard, 
As they sank in the deep : 
" 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep ; 
Cone to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep." 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild ; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not ; be raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair ; " Thy will be done ! " 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repegt last two lines.) 
And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore ; 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there.

Also, by the great •' American Four." 
I'LL sing of a 
dainty young man of fashion, 
Who just about now is the style and the rage; 
He looks like a 
donkey and acts like a 
monkey. 
The place to put him would be a 
big cage. 
Ills hair is done up in bangs and frizzes; 
A New Jersey lily he smells for food; 
His pants are so tight that it makes the head light 
Of this strange freak- of fashion, the Asthetic Dude. 
His collar's so big that it bides his big ears, 
ills nose is high toned, for it points to the skies; 
The boys call him Biddy, for he is so giddy, 
- 
And the way he walks you'd think he could fly. 
Now to all young ladies who may want to marry, 
I 
give this advice, so don't think me rude: 
You can't tell if you're hitched to a 
male or a 
female 
If you marry this foolish and mulish youu Dude. 
SARA BERNHARDT. 
Written and composed by CHAS. K ONOLLMAN, the popular Comique, 
and sung with immense success at the New National Theatre, New 
York; also sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE other night while strolling out down the Sixth 
Avenue, 
'Twas there that I 
saw something which was, to me, quite 
new; 
The people seemed all crazy about an actress of renown, 
bile surely is the queerest woman who ever can be found. 
CHORUS. 
For they call her Sara Bernhardt, 
The crazy actress from over the sea, 
But, for all, the people flock to see her, 
On the stage spouting Parlee Fran see. 
(Repeat ChOritS.) 
Her dresses are the latest styles which ever can be had, 
And they say she is a 
flirt, which really is too bad ; 
On all the men she is mashed, that's plainly to be seen, 
Although she is a 
daisy that's tall, lank and lean. 
For they call her, etc. 
Now as Sara is in New York, and will soon be out 
Among the bon ton society, of which I 
have no doubt, 
Many a 
heart she'll surely break, if she only gets the 
chance, 
Therefore, kind friends, take ray advice, and send her 
back to France. 
For they call her, etc. 
We've got some handsome women here, to that you'll all 
agree, 
Far prettier and much better than those across the sea; 
For there is Fanny Davenport, who was born on our own 
shore, 
With Clara Morris or Kate Claxton, and a 
dozen more. 
CHORUS. 
Now, my darling Sara Bernhardt, 
Take this advice from me, you see, 
Go right back to your own country 
And let the New York people be. 
(Repeat Chorus.)

PULL UP. 
Words by H ARRY BURNS. 
All Rights Reserved. 
Title of this Song, with original air, for sale. 
Address llanar 131nu:s, 510 
Penn avenue, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
YOUNG men when they're courting, 
They spout too much love, 
They call you their darling, 
Their own turtle dove, 
Then wind their arms round you, 
And whisper so sweet, 
And say, little darling, 
You're just fit to eat. 
CHORUS. 
Pull up—pull up— 
Don't talk so much trash, 
Be careful, young fellow, 
When you're on the mash. 
Pull up—pull up— 
It's wrong to tell lies, 
And say that your darling 
has beautiful eyes. 
Just listen now, please, 
While I 
tell of a 
case; 
I'll not give the names. 
Neither mention the place. 
(1 ) 
PULL UP.— Concluded, 
The gent, an Adonis, 
With nice curly hair, 
Got his heart all broke up 
On a 
damsel so fair. 
Pull up— pull up, etc. 
He sought this young damsel, 
And wooed for her hand; 
He told of his riches, 
His houses and land; 
He spoke of his uncle, 
An old millionaire, 
While his expectation 
Was to be the heir. 
Pull up—pull up, etc. 
The trousers his wash-woman 
..11ended that day, 
Just as he was kneeling, 
They ripped and gave way; 
The damsel she fainted, 
So strong was the spell; 
Her papa appeared, 
Kicked the fellow to— well. 
Pull up— pull up, etc. 
AH, THERE, MY SIZE, I'LL MASH YOU. 
Written by Hearty VAN M IKAN. Sung by tne " American Four" only. 
W HILE strolling out one evening, 
I 
happened for to meet 
Two dashing looking fellows, 
Who dressed so nice and neat. 
They stood upon the avenue, 
Dressed in the latest fashion, 
And every girl that chanced to pass 
These two young men were mashing. 
CHORUS. 
"Ah, there, my size, I 
will steal you." 
That's what the young men would say 
To all the dizzy blondes they'd meet 
Passing on their way. 
Ah, there, my turnip, I'll mash you," 
Is something rather new; 
But the latest one I've heard is, 
" 
Ali, there, my lemon, I'll squeeze 
Two dizzy blondes just chanced to pass, 
Dressed in the ton- ton style; 
They tried to catch a 
mash on them, 
But neither caught a 
smile. 
Determined to follow them, 
These two young men were caught 
Behind by two more men, 
Who gave these guys a 
thrashing. 
" 
Ali, there, my size," etc. 
THE WEDDING RING. 
Words by M . 
J. 
W ILTON. 
I 
DREAMED last night such a 
lovely dream, 
And I 
dreamed the dream was true ; 
I 
dreamed that I 
was a 
fair young bride, 
And that he was my husband, too. 
He said he had built a 
house for me, 
In the midst of a 
fairy bower, 
Where the hunnninfr bird and busy bee 
Gather'd honey from each flower. 
My thoughts are still on that woodland home, 
Which he had built for his bride; . 
And I 
lov'd him more for his love of mo 
Than for all his wealth beside. 
Faithful and true I 
know him to be ; 
His praises I'd gladly sing; 
Together he gave his hand and heart, 
And this golden wedding ring. 
REFRAIN. 
Then hand in hand my love and I 
Shall pass through life together ; 
And bravely stem the ebbin!- tide, 
In fair and stormy weather.

S. 
M ULLALY. 
As sung by the San Francisco Minstrels. 
For sale at all music stores, price 40 cents. 
NEVER to meet as friends again, 
Always to dwell apart, 
Gone are the words I 
treasured, 
And sacredly kept in my heart. 
Passing me by in silence, 
As if we had never seen 
Moments and hours of gladness 
That seem like a 
happy dream. 
Can you forget the old times 1 
And know what a 
world of pain 
To meet as strangers always, 
But never as friends again. 
CHORUS. 
Passing me by ill silEnce, 
As if we had never seen 
Moments and 'lows of gladness 
That seem like a 
happy dream. 
Can you forget the old times 
And know what a 
world of pain 
To meet as strangers, always, 
But never as friends again? 
Never to meet as friends again, 
Tho' years may come and go, 
Never to hear a 
welcome, 
When my heart is bowed down with woe. 
Just like a 
drooping flower, 
Receiving the morning dew ; 
Lingering in thy presence, 
Thinking of days we knew ; 
Only a dream of old times, 
And vows that were made in vain, 
Meeting as strangers always, 
But never as friends again. 
Passing me by, etc.

As sung by GEO. GALES. 
Woivr you kiss me good- night, little darling, 
Now the song birds have gone to rest, 
As you did in the days of childhood, 
When you leaned your fond head on my breast ?

The silvery moon's shining, my darling, 
The little stars twinkle so bright, 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love ; 
Little darling, come, kiss me good-night.

Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
And dream a 
sweet dream, love, for me ? 
For you know when we played in the wild wood, 
I 
was always so loving to thee. 
You remember I 
kissed your sweet cheek, love, 
• 
As you placed your sweet hand, dear, in mine, 
And this to me softly did whisper— 
Forever, love, I 
will be thine. 
Wont you kiss me, etc.

She was ugly, she was lazy, 
Yet. somehow, I

When I

used to treat her; 
She looked so sweet that I

And rise when the rooster crows, 
And I'll spend my life with my dear old wife 
Down where the sugar cane grows.

THE ODORS IN OUR ALLEY. 
Parody on the popular song, " Sally in Our Alley." As suLg '')y 
the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
THE sweetest spot in this ' ere town, 
Where fragrant breezes rally, 
Old garbage, swill, and cholera— 
You'll find up in our alley. 
The street brigade ne'er ventures near, 
With their broom and shovel " ballet," 
The old soap- fat would knock you flat 
If you came up in our alley. 
CHORUS. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze, 
Or some old limburger jelly, 
An old bone yard or putrid lard 
Is sweet, compared with our alley. 
The Board of Health should surely come, 
And no longer dilly-dally, 
With chloride of lime and carbolic soap, 
To disinfect our alley. 
The smell would kill an old tom cat, 
And I'm sure he'd never rally, 
For in spite of " cops " they empty slops, — 
You can swim up in our alley. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze. etc.

EVENING ON THE LAKE. 
QUARTETTE. 
Written by W. LEAVITT, and sung by the PARKER SISTERS, with the 
" 
American 
STARLIGHT gilds the rolling waves, 
Onward bounds our merry bark; 
Sea nymphs revel in their caves— 
Why shouldn't we enjoy a 
lark ? 
Evening breezes softly sigh, 
Volumes speak from every eye, 
Happiness reigns when we are out 
Sailing on the lake. 
CHORUS. 
Starlight on the lake, 
Oh, beautiful starlight, beautiful starliolit, 
Starlight on the lake; 
Music now is heard, and joyous hearts 
Breathe forth in song as on the lake we glide, 
As dashes our boat along, along. 
Starlight gilds the rolling waves, 
Onward bounds our merry bark, 
Sea nymphs revel in their caves, 
Why shouldn't we enjoy a 
lark ? 
Evening breezes softly sigh. 
Volumes speak from every eye, 
Happiness reigns when we are out 
Sailing on the lake. 
Starlight on the lake, etc. 
Written by Jos. PETTENGILL, of the " American Four." Sung nightly. 
I 
ONCE loved a 
yaller 
Her name was Jennie Johnson. 
Hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie, come along with me, 
She was so fat and lazy, 
She weighed about a 
ton, • 
Did my, hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie Johnson. (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
I 
courted her for many a 
long year, 
Until one day she acted very queer; 
She told me for to get, and walk off on my ear, 
Did my, hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie Johnson. 
Laugh, shout, sing, dance. (Break.) 
Hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie, come along with me. 
Ili, Jennie, ho, Jennie, you shall be free, 
Free as a 
bee on a 
huckleberry tree, 
Is my hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie Johnson. 
went one day and asked her to he mine, 
Hi, Jennie. ho, Jennie, come along with me. 
I 
treated her to eider, hoe cake and wine, 
My, hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie Johnson. 
I 
took her to a 
ball, she couldn't dance at all, 
But she up with her foot and banged me in the jaw, 
Then there was a 
fight which busted up the ball 
About, hi, Jennie, ho, Jennie Johnson. 
I 
courted her, etc,

Oh, yes, I 
am one of the finest. 
The finest Police ever known; 
In uniform brilliantly shining, 
As proud as a 
king on his throne; 
The ladies all call me their darling, 
As I 
escort them safe o'er Broadway: 
While strolling my beat through the gay, busy street, 
The people admiringly say— 
CHORUS. 
He's one of the finest, one of the finest, 
Guarding our safety and peace; 
Brave and courageous, never outrageous, 
One of the finest Police. 
The flies never plague me in summer, 
Because they are too much afraid, 
I 
use my club like a 
base drummer, 
That leads a 
big torchlight parade; 
My fana'ly is very domestic, 
I'm sure that they never go out, 
When I 
come to eat, after roaming my beat, 
My wife she is sure for to shout— 
lie's one of the finest, etc. 
When eall'd on I'm always found ready, 
I'm in for protection and peace, 
Though some, I'll admit, are not steady, 
But I'm not that kind. of Police ; 
I 
flirt with the girls when off duty, 
Gallivanting with them I 
don't shun, 
So gentle I 
am, as a 
little pet lamb, 
And this is the title I've won— 
He's one of the finest, etc.

She's the keeper of a

Oh, how I

And I'll meet her when the sun goes down. 
In the evening when my work is done, 
With my true love I'm sure to be found, 
In a 
quiet little nook by the babbling brook 
I'll meet her when the sun goes down. 
When Sunday comes we'll take a

In the woods well roam around. 
Next Sunday at nine I'll call her mine, 
We'll be married when the sun goes down.

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY'. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'ReilLy fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
Thiv polioe came 
and collared the gang.

THB GOSPEL RAPT. 
Written by FRANK DUXONT. 
Dedicated to M R. ABCHIR W HIM 
rSE gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark ; 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep dem burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't forget to get your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day ; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Hide away, hide away ; dar's no use trying to hide 
away; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
When he followed ole Moses long ago ; 
They was drowned in de water wid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule ; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear ; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to de shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too ; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you niggers will be cooked into a 
stew.

private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door ; 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw.

DOWN BY THE RIVER. 
Sung by the " American Four.' 
SILVER stars are shining bright, 
Softly beams the moon to-night; 
Silver breezes blowing clear, 
Tell me my love Willie is near. 
Thanks to the stars that friendly shine, 
They keep the secrets of Willie and I; 
They are the ones that alone can tell 
How oft I'm waiting for Will. 
CHORUS. 
When in the eve birds build their nests, 
When from its labor the world is at rest, 
When the sweet hour chimes on the bell, 
Down by the river I'm waiting for Will, 
The moon shining bright, the wind blowing slight, 
No one is near when we're telling our love; 
Oh, how my heart beats when he repeats, 
Be mine forever, my sweet turtle dove." 
One little kiss, then soon we depart; 
One lingering look of rapture and love; 
One little sigh joy does impart, 
Tells inc he loves me all others above.

AUGUSTUS.-4 wonder where she can be? She made an ap-
pointment to meet me here precisely at eight. 
It's past that 
now. I 
wonder if she will disappoint me? ; I 
don't be-
lieve she will, for I 
flatter myself I 
have won that palpitating 
little heart of hers. 
Oh, she's a 
beauty! 
Nobody else stands 
a 
show to win her from me. 
Why, she wouldn't look at 
another chap. 
I'm her only beau. 
Where can she be?

I 
never knew her to break her 
promise. 
Oh, she's just the sweetest little angel out of para-
dise! 
Such eyes! 
Such hair! 
And then she loves me so. 
She calls me pet and sugar-plum, and all sweet cognomens 
like these. 
Then the best of it is she won't even look at any 
other fellow. 
[Sees ArousTus.] 
Hello! [Aside.] I 
wonder 
what he's dodging around here for. 
Why, he's got into my

GIVE ME THE GIRL THAT IS TENDER AND 
TRITE. 
sung with great success by HARRY W ALKER. 
Mr tastes they are simple, I 
care not for wealth, 
So long as I'm blest with a 
good share of health. 
I'll tell you my wants, and I 
think you'll agree 
That it takes very little to satisfy me ; 
I 
am not ambitious, and ne'er spent an hour 
In pining for place, or position, or power, 
No envy have I 
for our rulers above, 
But I 
glory in gaining true friendship and love. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the girl that is tender awl true, 
Give me the friend that is faithful to you, 
Give me a 
glass, a 
pipe, and a 
song, 
Then I'll be as happy as the days are long. 
In search of enjoyments, wherever we roam, 
There's none that can equal the sweet joys of home 
If there we have kindness, contentment, and rest, 
Domestic felicity I 
think the best ; 
Let some seek for fame upon far distant fields, 
And find what an empty illusion it yields, 
Let others take pleasure however they may, 
I'll still enjoy life in my own quiet way. 
Give me the girl, etc. 
'Tis no use to worry and flurry I.find, 
To gather up hoards that we must leave behind, 
Regrets will not alter our station a 
jot, 
So try to be happy whatever your lot ; 
Remember that hawiness does not depend 
Upon the amount of cash you can spend, 
Those days are most pleasant, and so are the nights, 
That are passed in the simplest and purest delights. 
Give me the girl, etc. 
You'll own em my song to a 
finish is brought, 
True friendship and love they are not to be bought, 
In them you can trust whate'er may befall, 
And that's why I 
prize them as dearer than all ; 
The pipe has a 
soothing effect on the mind, 
The glass and the song cheer the heart when combined, 
With friends all around, and the girl you admire, 
What else is there left in this world to desire ? 
Give me 'I'e

NOBODY'S CAT. 
Sung by Cais. CORBILLO, with the " American Four." 
HE 
comes again, that sneaking scamp, 
That vile, disreputable scamp, 
That yellow cat, with one eye out, 
And minus half his tail— the lout! 
His scanty hair torn out in fight— 
A wretch forlorn, a 
sorry sight. 
I 
maid me well not long ago, 
He paced these fields a 
full-fledged beau, 
His whiskered head. Ids dainty paw, 
His ,olossy coat without a 
flaw, 
His well-curled tail, his high-bred stare, 
Proclaimed him favored of the fair. 
Aim I 
then his food was creamy milk, 
His bed a 
lounge of down and silk: 
A darling mistress sought his weal, 
No grief her petted puss might feel. 
By night. by day he went his ways, 
Well surfeited with love and praise. 
But now, you beast, you wretched wight, 
Begone from decent people's sight; 
Go steal from swine your mouldy bit, 
Make haste my premises to quit. 
Or else be pelted yell with stones. 
There now, jog on, old crazy bones. 
But what, is this that dims my eyes? 
What stirrings of in 
soul arise? 
There's something human in your look, 
A 
something that I 
cannot brovk. 
That boy of mine iti foreign lands. 
Afar from reach of loving hands.

MOTHER KEEPS THE GAT E LOCKED 
NOW . 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Music by J. P. 
SKELLY. 
Music published by W. A. EVANS 8.7 BROTHER, 50 Bromfield street, 
Boston, Mass. 
I KNOW a 
lovely girl, her name is Katie Lee, 
She's charming as can be, she's all the world to me; 
But now we are apart, to see her I'm denied, 
While all the day I 
sigh to clasp her to my side ; 
Each night we used .o 
meet, down by the garden gate, 
And happy then the hours would fly away; 
But now when 'round the house I 
fondly watch and wait, 
I 
sadly hear my little Katie say, 
Mother keeps the gate locked now, 
To see you love I 
don't know how, 
I 
must stay in the house, as quiet as a 
mouse, 
For mother keeps the gate locked now. 
We used to meet each night, it was a 
happy spell, 
The moon was shining bright, while tales of love I'd tell, 
But Katie oft would sigh, ' Oh what will mother say, 
She thinks I'm at the gate, and I'm so far away 
One night when we returned from a 
delightful stroll, 
Her mother's rage I 
could not pacify : 
I 
quickly went away, but Katie wrote to say, 
That she would come and meet me on the sly, 
For—Mother keeps the gate, etc. 
Now Katie stays at home, and I'm in distress, 
t 
wander all alone, without my happiness, 
I 
t-y 
the gate to climb, but there's a 
dog within 
Tbat growls at me and barks, and makes an awful din; 
Poor Katie mopes all day, oh, cruel parents they, 
To treat my lit tle girl so shamefully. 
We'll run away some night, and get married ere day- light, 
\nd 
more will Katie say to me,

THE TWINS FROM SKIBBEREEN. 
Words and Music by THOMAS F. HARTY. 
Written expressly for Mr. JAMES BRADLEY and HARRY littramaLL. 
FERNINST you stand two Corkeys bold, 
Whose pedigree is easy told ; 
We've just landed here from the emerald isle, 
And we won't detain you but awhile ; 
We are twins it's plainly to be seen. 
And we come from a 
place called Skibbereen 
And digging turf we'll do no more, 
Since the day we left old Erin's shore ; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend, 
And you'll find there's none so true a 
friend ; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that conic from Skibbereen. (Dance.) 
At home we were known as the Irish team. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair we could always be seen, 
And if called upon for a 
jig or a 
reel, 
We could show them the use of the toe and heel, 
And whenever there would be a 
faction tight, 
In the midst of the fray would be our delight, 
For two hearts more brave were never seen 
Than the twins that come from Skibbereen ; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend. 
And you'll find there's none so true a 
friend ; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that conic from Skibbereen. (Dane.) 
BIG FAT NANCE. 
Original Act by BRADLEY and W ILD. 
W HITE folks, give me your attention, 
While I'll sing to you my song., 
'Tis of my girl I'm going to mention, 
And I 
promise not to detain you long ; 
I've been courting her for many a 
day, 
And to her house I 
often go around ; 
In her stocking feet she stands six feet four. 
And weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. 
cuours. 
Come all ye niots, come join together, 
Take the banjo down and have a 
dance, 
For I'm going to be married next Sunday evening, 
To my great big fat and greasy Nance. 
Nancy's ma has gave consent. 
Her father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take her arm, 
And to the church we both shall glide ; 
She will be my wife forever. 
Lots of things for her I'll buy, 
she'll never go back on George Lapelle 
Until the very day she dies. 
Come all ye. pigs, etc.

SING LOW, SWEET CHILDREII. 
A COLORED CAMP MEETING SON G. 
Written by W. 
H. DELEHANTY and sung by DELEHANTY and Hxwarma. 
I 
TOOK a 
stroll one afternoon. 
Sweet chil hen hear dis tale, 
'Twas in the latter part of June, 
Children, mark dis tale. 
I 
sat me down beside a 
stream, 
Children, hear me thro', 
I 
somehow seemed to sleep and dream, 
That dream I'll tell to you. 
CIIOR IT S. 
Sing low, sweet children, 
The angels soon will come,' 
Sing low, sweet children— 
They're coming to take me horn*. 
This an anael said to me, 
We're coming to take you home, 
Where all are happy, all are free— 
Coming to take you home, 
A aolden chariot then came down, 
Children, mark dis tale, 
J.nd dere was angels white and brow, 
sinners, mark dis tale. 
Sing low, etc. 
Angels twined about my hair 
Flowers wet with dew, 
A wreath of roses fresh and fair, 
Sweet children hear me thro'. 
Soon they robed me all in white, 
Oh I 
the blessed Lamb. 
They set me in the chariot bright, 
Beside the blessed Lamb. 
Sing low, etc. 
Then I 
woke up from my dream, 
Den I 
hove a 
sigh, 
There I 
was beside the stream, 
And tears was in my eye; 
I 
took it for a 
warning sent, 
So I'm prepared to die. 
Don't grieve for me, I'm well content, 
And I'm prepared to die. 
Sing low, eta.

CORK ON THE BRAIN. 
W ritten by FRANK DUMONT expressly for BILLY W RIST. 
An :—" Hail Columbia right side up, 
aide." 
once did love a 
fickle damsel, 
And I 
thought that she loved me ; 
But soon I 
found that it was folly, 
For both ot us could not agree. 
The way I 
lost her, now I'll tell you, 
How I 
came to lose her hand ; 
I 
took her to see a 
minstrel concert. 
And she tell in love with one of the band. 
CHORUS. 
If she loved me I'd be happy, 
She might have been a 
lady grand ; 
But, she better loved the big bass singer, 
Who sat in the middle of a 
Minstrel Band. 
He'd give her tickets for the concert, 
And she'd sit, in the front row ; 
And in a 
hurry then he'd " wash up," 
And hasten out, then home they'd go. 
He'd sing the 
Old Sexton " for to please her, 
And at the low notes she would stare ; 
While I 
distracted on the sidewalk, 
Raved and swore and tore my hair. 
If she loved me. ,fte. 
So back my pictures then she gave me, 
And told me ne'er to show my ince ; 
Or dare to think that I 
could win her, 
Until I 
learned to warble bass. 
I 
left her and in the " Clipper " lately 
1 
read that she was shuffling sand ; 
And travelling as a 
Indy eloggist, 
With a 
Female Minstrel Band. 
If she loved me, &c.

Mary, the Walker. 
- Written expressly for MURPHY & MACK by FRANK E. 
Manta. 
Biddy, the Ballet Girl." 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl. 
Who is known all over creation; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education, 
A masher she is called on the streat, 
In the " Black Crook" she does the statues ; 
But lately she has cancelled all dares, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
Cnortus. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mar, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy, 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to wag:, 
- She has the score-board all marke0 with long 
streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creepi 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all &lout, " Give it up, you're too 
stout!" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then 
be proud as a 
lord, 
Vo danger of my trunks getting stuck, 
Fr Mary will walk off with the board. 
Oh, her frost name, etc 
ISAAC AND MOSES. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung by HOWARD and THOICPSON 
nightly at Toxy PASTOR'S Theatre. 
W E 
keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that come to us, 
He wanted to buy a 
coat ; 
So help my Jiminy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
morass. 
Isaac and Moses sells old clothes, 
Down in Baxter street ; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say : 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two." 
He made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store; 
We pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
He brought in all his gang. 
:ksaac and Moses, eto. 
GOOD-BYE, LIZA JANE. 
AWAY down south where I 
was born, 
I 
husk the wood and chop the corn, 
Walk that loo, oh! miss loo, 
Ah! ah ! ahl hear me now: 
A 
roasted ear to the house I 
bring, 
The overseer cotch me and made me sing. 
Walk that loo, oh! miss be. 
Ah! ah! ah! hear me now: 
For I 
am going away to leave yon, good-bye, good-bye. 
I 
am going away to leave you, god-bye, Liza Jane. 
Oh! I'm going away to leave you, oh! I am going down to 
Lynchburgtown, 
If you get there before I 
do, oh good-bye, Liza Jane. 
Ducks play cards and chickens drink wine, 
And monkeys grow upon grape vines; 
Walk that loo, oh! miss loo, 
Ah! ah! ah! hear me now; 
Corn-starch pudding and tapioca pie, 
Oh! the gray cat picked out the black cat's eye. 
Walk that loo, etc. 
The old cow in the young cow's shed, 
Fell over a 
corn and broke off her bead; 
Walk that loo, oh! miss loco. 
Ah! ah! ah! hear me now; 
And when the jackass heard the row, 
' 
He stabbed himself with the tail of a 
cow. 
Walk that loo, eta. 
A 
nigger came from Arkansaw, 
The worst old fool I 
ever saw; 
Walk that loo, oh ! miss loo. 
Ah! ah! ! bear me now ; 
He went some water for to get, 
And he carried it home in a 
corn basket. 
Walk that loo, etc. 
WALTZING TO THE PAR. 
Written and sung by J. H. CONROY. 
Am.—" Bathing in the Surf." 
Mv friends, if you will listen, 
You I 
will surprise. 
It's of a 
charmer I 
met at a 
picnic, 
Whom I 
thought a 
prize. 
Her eyes were dark and gentle, 
And I 
loved her dearer than gold, 
But after a 
year of married life, 
How badly I 
was sold. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzing up to the bar 
Is a 
favorite pastime of mine ; 
I 
always call for strong drink, 
Providing I 
have a 
dime. 
Oh give me gin or whiskey, 
Or old Jamaica rum, 
For since I 
married this beauty 
I've turned out a 
regular bum. 
When our love was young and gay, 
How sweet I 
thought her glance, 
I'd place my arm around her waist 
As we went through the mazy dance. 
Around and around we'd go, 
Mid the multitude so large, 
Oh, how lovely it did seem, 
While waltzing on the barge. 
Waltzing up, etc. 
My married life is an unhappy one, 
I 
have still that plague of a 
wife; 
I'll go and seek to get a 
divorce, 
So I'll have peace the rest of my life. 
My family numbers six, 
The oldest one is a 
blot, 
For whenever I 
sneak to get a 
drink, 
He clings to the tail of my coat. 
Waltzing up, etc.
