River People—The Lost Watch 
 
When we were river people 
once in a while you talked different, 
different because we were under 
the influence of elders—their repetition, 
a northern dialect of hands 
coming apart in stories. 
 
When we were river people 
the sun made an alphabet 
of light struck trees 
while you sat on a stump 
in the yard and rolled 
tobacco from the plants 
we grew 
in the raised beds 
by the power 
pole. 
 
When we were river people 
the dog we took from dog death row 
at the shelter got cancer and 
we put her in the ground near 
where young thunder woman 
learned to hit golf balls 
toward an old shirt on a stick 
where every shot was lost. 
 
When we were river people we made medicine 
for Zahquod and fasted and sweat at dawn 
for four days, following Eagleheart’s instructions. 
Zahquod drank the tea for a few months 
and died the following fall. 
 
When we were river people we put stones 
in the mailbox to keep the weekend rowdies 
from hitting it again while we slept 
and we drove 
to town every Thursday to 
take Anungoonce to tap class. 
 
 
 
There were boys after her after that 
and we let one in. 
There she held him close often and made sure 
he got his needle before he stupored in 
dropping sugar. 
 
When we were river people 
big leaf rhubarb grew, 
wild Turkeys walked in the mist 
up the drive 
a few big hens in front 
and the gas man apologized when 
he saw you talking with pwaagun 
early one Friday when you heard the news 
about Zahqoud starting on interleukin 2. 
 
When we were river people you listened 
to Townes every day for a week of summer 
‘to live is to fly’ he said ‘both low and high’ 
he said with his cracked hard Oklahoma voice 
he reminded you of Smoke 
the week you watched his horse 
and the belly laugh his goddaughter 
Anungoonce let loose 
outside the barbed wire 
pasture fence as Seguili the horse ran. 
 
When we were river people we lost power 
for five days one winter, so we braced 
ourselves on fallen logs when we shit outside 
and we fed the woodstove and slept on the 
floor and drove to Canadian Lakes to shower. 
 
When we were river people 
singing woke you one night 
and you ran outside asking 
the stars and the creator to help 
you remember the words 
remember the words 
Giizhay manidoo have pity 
Giizhay manidoo bring healing. 
 
 
 
When we were river people Geeshik 
Eway Abaat would not talk to you 
though you kept asking to let your love 
for her find its way to her, so you could 
tell her about the shooting star and her birth 
under a formation of white cranes 
And so you could laugh with her 
about when she was three, 
when she came crying out 
of the sweat with Grandma Rose. 
 
When we were river people visitors 
came with strangers and strangers came with 
friends to bring wood and stones for namings 
sweats and thirsty dance sings and all those 
gifts Eagleheart shared with you 
when you lived out west. 
 
When we were river people deer 
ran through morning by morning 
one morning a string of them 
one walking wounded outside 
hobbling on three legs, an arrow 
through the fourth, outside the 
window as you made breakfast for all 
the girls who came looking for Nawgwayawp 
stayed overnight after the dance. 
 
When we were river people there was 
no time for writing, too many people 
were dying, too many children were 
growing, there were too many ceremonies 
to make, too much firewood to cut, too many calls, 
too many fasts, too many trips to 
White Earth and Turtle Mountain 
too much burned gas 
too many names requested 
to be given, to people you know 
who still don’t know who they are, 
too many appointments, disappointments, 
too much tired talk, the difference between 
going to sleep and staying up 
already past deciding. 
 
When we were river people 
Crow knew just like you know now 
a stone is no place for a watch 
as you know what we call time 
can’t be made up with words 
lost, or remembered, or held down 
 
to earth, or be left behind 
by blessings, forgotten, or be any more 
than a relative of light, who returns home, 
as bright clear sun reporting all 
that has gone between rising and falling.
