The ritual's ethnic transference illustrates one 
type of process which m ay occur in the performance_ of tradition. 
However, within Pueblo's Si cilian community itself the ritual is 
"not a bounded entity made up of constituent parts, but a process. 
of interpretation" (Handier and Linneki.n 1984:287) . In this

Sicilian Tables for Saint Joseph 
According to Sicilian Puebloans, the Saint Joseph's  Day tables 
began in Sicily centuries ago when famine plagued the island. 
To 
honor Joseph, Sicily's patron saint, peasants filled an altar 
with food, their- most prized possession. 
This  act evolved into 
large open,house events, featuring a table abundantly laden with 
food, which are intended to T=hank Saint Joseph for prayEers that, 
he answered. 
The public views the home altars on March 13 and 
19; 
r"i.fnd 
on the 19th
5 the Feast Day of Saint Joseph on the 
Catholic calendar, the main ritual takes place. 
A priest blesses 
the table, people representing Joslagh and other saint s consume a 
ti.tual. meal, and hundreds of people come to admire the table and 
to participate in the feast . 
c:•, 
However, the Saint Joseph's Day table tradition is not just 
a one day event. 
Rather it consists of a series of actions which 
take place well before March 19. 
"These actions constitute the 
process which allows a.ltargivers to manipulate the ritual to tell. 
7 
particular stories about themselves within a general physical and 
1 
format.. 
In her study of a Sicilian town, Pamela K. Ouaggiatto 
shows how personal aesthetics, social attitudes, economic status, 
gender roles, and religious devotion influence the textual 
performance of the altar ritual. 
These factors also affect the 
of re - creation of the observances by Sicilian Puebloans. 
In the 
following description , 1 dive examples of the-
different way s altarmaker

have manipulated the tradition to tell 
particular- stories about themselve s and their 'fc•t711'lli'_s 
_ 
i t should he noted that most. Sicilians focus on the 
required components of Saint Joseph 
Uay tables, giving the 
impression the feast involves a static_:, proscribed entity instead 
of dynamic interpretive processes. 
What follows is not an 
exhaustive description, but it is extensive enough to give the 
reader a sense of the ritual's complexity and the degree to which 
it L 
_.1 f'1 
be persona lized. 
A vow which initiates a ritual exchange between Saint Joseph 
and a petitioner is the 'first action required in the process of

In the vow, the petitioner promises to make an 
altar" 1f the saint resolves or assists in the resolution of a 
family crisis.5 
While family problems, especially illness, 
ust_ail ly motivate individuals to make vows, they may also have 
table-. in gratitude for the general well-being of their families. 
Al and JoHnna Collette, for instance, have prepared feasts to 
celebrate their family's good fortune as well as ones to thank. 
Saint Joseph for his help in combatting family illness.b 
When making a vow, the petitioner may make one or more 
requests at a time (as did Josephine Martellard); promise to make 
an altar- once; or to have more than one (for- example, have a tattle 
for the next five years); chose to "beg" for donations from 
a 
family

begging" from house to house or to "beg barefoot" as an act of 
Sacrifice. 
Cantpmporary social 
ial attitudes, however ,
now make this 
unacceptable behavior. 
he concept of sacrifice, however, remains important,in the 
ritual. 
Al tar makers spend substantial amounts of time, energy 
and money to prepare for the feast day observances. 
These 
expenditures are seen as a sacrifice willingly undertaken as a 
labor of 
love:' and an e_.: +r'"e:'ssion of gratitude toward the 
_. 
saint. 
Assuming an altar's entire financial cost may symbolzie the 
burdpn the hos tess and her family willingly undertook: to express 
devotion and thanks; to Saint Joseph. 
However, it may also be 
intended as a statement of wealth and class. 
Scholars have found 
economic and social status issues play a major role in the 
performance of the ritual (Cuaggiotto 1988; Seriff 1991) . 
Josephine Gagliano believes the ritual is "more luxurious" here 
than in hef- rt•2ti.ve 
Sl.ci.ly. 
In fact, there seems to be an 
unstated pressure towards a grandiose and exaggerated display of 
_Abundance (Ser-iff and Tur ner:448) . 
However, donations cannot be refused, and contributions of 
money, labor and goods area usually significant despite the 
intentions of the altargi.ver-. Josephine Cagliano wanted to cover 
the full expense of her 1989 table as a gestures of thanks to 
Saint Joseph. 
She did not solicit donations while preparing the 
altar nor- during the open—house. 
However., she had to put out a 
bt.-.,wl 
to hold the money people placed amidst the food on the 
t& ble. 
To keep her commitment to undertake the entire cost, 
4 
Josephine gave: the donated monies to charity. 
After the vow in made, the saint must positively respond to 
the petitioner's request. 
The response manifests itself in the 
remedi.at ion of the crisis which prompted the vow. 
Recovery from 
illness or the safe return of a loved-one from war are common 
motives for seeking the saint's intercession. 
In instances of 
sickness, the per-son for whom the vow was made does not have to 
fully recover. 
Often partial recovery, or stability in the 
status of the individuais's health, or even the fact that he or 
she is still alive may be interpreted as a. 
positive response. 
When the petitioner perceives that Saint Joseph has answered 
her prayers, she is obligated to make a table (or a mule must ask 
a woman to supervise the task) to fulfill their part of the 
ri.t.ual. exchange. 
Only one person interviewed, Josephine 
Gagliano, said she delayed doing a table after her husband 
Anthony recovere=d from illness. 
When their son Vincent was later 
injured, she took it as a sign that she needed to do the promise=d 
altar. 
Once she promised to follow through on her original vow, 
Vincent recovered and Josephine had an altar dedicated to both of 
them. 
Altars in Pueblo are frequently dedicated to the person 
for whom the petitioner made the request (e.g. the persor: who 
recovpred from illness, returned from war, found employment) as 
well as to honor and thank Saint Jo=_eph.7 
An ailt.arciver open=_-_ her home for public viewing of the table 
at noon on March 19 and all. day March 19. 
One to three mont=hs 
previously, however, she begins to prepare for the table. 
Shea 
and her assistants, most of whom are Yemale relatives or clo se 
friends, start to purchase or order ingredients for the numerous 
foods needed for a table; prepare and freeze some items ahead of 
time; delegate tasks„ and organize the many details required to 
construct an al tar, host an open house and serve a meal to 5(i0 or 
more people. 
As mentioned, other people voluntarily assist them 
by donating cash, goods, or time to ensure t he table's success.r_'+ 
Despite this assistance, the altargiver, her family and 
assistants invest considerable amounts of time, money and time to 
insure a successful event. 
The fruits of t.hei labor begin to converge in the week: 
before (``arch 18. 
Men assemble the table's wood foundation in the 
al t.argiver' s living room. 
The altar often spans an entire wall, 
from side_ to side and from floor to ceiling, and often has tiers 
or shelves on the section against the wall. 
The women cover the 
base with fabrics, linens, sheets, or tablecloths, some new and 
some of which may be heirlooms previously used on al tars. 
Here 
the women can express their personal aesthetics through 
decorative details and color scheme, although white or pastel. 
shades are usually used. 
A statue or painting of Sa.i.nt. Joseph is t.hiE 
first object 
placed on the altar, and always stands in the center of the 
highest. tier. 
The image may show Saint Joseph holding the infant

Ma.r trl lar._o did not have and couldn't find a satisfactory icon of 
the saint, so she ner"sel.f painted an imager of him holding the 
infant Jesus. 
Whether- the Holy Family i.s portrayed in  the 
alt.ar- 's central image or not, the entire family is represented on 
i 
the tabled through symbols, the Sacred Heart of Jesus or the Palm, 
Leaf associated with Mary. 
And the Holy Family is portrayed by 
three people selected to represent them; additional  saints  
may 
also be included. 
Sicilian Pu.e:pbloa.nF also place on their altars photoqraphs of 
the people who benefitted from Saint Joseph's attention or 
int.:ercession between the petitioner and God. 
It must be 
remembered the tables 
are sacred 
space within t.t-ie home. 
The altar is the physical locus of the 
intersection of the sacred and the secular, "the heavenly family 
and the earthly family" (Turner and Seriff:448). 
The whole 
tradition hinges on the belief that human beings and Saint Joseph 
can communicate with each other, and that there is a personal 
relationship betwcen saint and petitioner. 
The photographs 
indicate the beneficiaries of this relationship, and highlight 
X 
the central importance of the family in the ritual _and the 
cultures by alligni.ng the Holy Family with the a.l.targi.ver's 
family, particularly the loved ones for whom she made the initial 
Altargivers also often include_ secular objects which have 
pe r
.. sonal meaning and tell a story about the altar-giver and/or her 
family. 
Bessie Ingo has used linens from hEr hope chest on 
7 
tables. 
Her sister Ann Massarotti and their mother has used her 
a crochete d table clothe which is a family heirloom. 
Th e use of 
these items StrE:'SS an intimate femal e and famil i:al 
connection to 
\• 
the saint and the tradition. 
On her altar ,
Josephine Sagliano 
included a pillow case from her dowry and sugar figures her 
mother and brother, who live in Sicily, had given to her and her 
children. 
She also displayed an Italian flag an 
-; 
f 
1 l of the 
United States to show she and her husband are proud of both  their 
heritages.`' 
After the image of Saint Joseph is placed can the table, the 
altargiver and her assistants begin to arrange;: large quantities 
and several varieties of breads , cakes, pastries, cookies, 
fruits, raw vegetables, uncooked spaghetti and other- items which 
will not. spoil.. 
A whole fish, several. frittate (vegetable 
omelets), cannoli, and other perishable foods are prepared on 
March 10 or 19, and are the last items placed on the table. 
Some 
of these (e.g. the fist- and frittate) are often elaborately 
docorat.ed, allowing the women another- opportunity to express 
personal aesthetics and creativity. 
Sicilian Puebloans insist that certain foods must be on the 
'abla , including Saint Joseph's Day breads, fried carduni 
(artichoke stalks), frittate (some people say one for each saint 
represented at the ritual) , a whole fish, and several cake, 
including ones with images of the Cross, Dible and 4 ; 
Pm-L- [col 
of Jesus).1G 
in general, most of the required foods symbolize 
the tradition's Sicilian/Italian origin and the religious mature 
S 
of the event. 
Al Collette and Bessie Ingo said the table 
represents "new Life," which is symbolized by such thinq'nl— q 
plates  of sprouted -mt-, ppt, candy Easter chicks and flowers. 
In 
fact, the Feast Day of Sa.i.nt. Joseph falls during the Lenten 
season, and often close to Easter, which commemorates the 
resurrection of Christ, the ultimate symbol of new life in 
Christianity. 
Sicilian Puebloans do connect Easter and the 
ritual t.hrc_u.ic:h the proximity of their occurenc:e, the use, of 
Easter- candies on the:: 
table, as expressions of new life, and on 
the exclusion of meat from both the event. 
John AmellE and his 
son related the feast and the saints who partake of a ritual meal 
to the Last Supper . 
11. 
Altarmak:ers agree a. 
colorful, symmetrical and abundant 
presentation should be created on the altar. 
Josephine• 
Plartel.laro used fruit, colored popcorn balls, candy Easter chicks 
and chocolate Easter eggs to fill up space. 
This display of 
abundance and wealth through the amount of food, types of food, 
and use of fine china, crystal and tableware is common. 
Duaggiotto argues it is rooted in social and economic issues as 
well as the history of Saint Joseph as a poor man (1988). 
Although tables produced in Sicily seem to be laden abundantly, 
Josephine uagliano believes they are "more luxurious" in Fueblo. 
I believe this reflects the altarmakers' desire to not only 
impress Saint Joseph but to seed a message to table viewers that-
she i'lc:s 
the financial resources and the cooperation of dedicated 
friends and family members to do a table properly. 
In fact, 
9 
there is some amount of friendly competiveness involved in the 
ritual's performance. 
At an altar held in 1991 at the Shrine of 
Saint Therese, viewers' commentary often involved comparisons 
between that table (or- particular components) and ones members of 
the audience had seen in the past, or had given themselves. 
Usually a small group of women are involved in negotiating 
the assemblage of .items on the table. 
Everyone concurs that the 
tables should be abundantly decorated, items should be 
symmetrically aranged, and the image of Saint Joseph should =sand 
at the highest central. point, flanked by Jesus and Mary. 
Also, 
food used for the saints' ritual meal should be at the front of 
the table within easy reach of the servers. 
However, the 
placement of flowers, candles, cookies, fruit and other items 
generally depends on personal aesthetics and involves negotiation 
by the women decorating the table. 
Except for perishable foods which will be placed on the 
table the next day, the table is ready for public viewing on 
March 18. 
On either day, anyone can come to the altargiver's 
hone to admire= the table and deliver donations if they wish. 
In 
the past, newF of tables spread vier word of mouth, while today 
al.lariYl<"kers place announcements in church bulletinq, the diocese 
paper- , the local newspaper- and/or circulate memos at their- places 
of employment.. 
While the tables have always been large open-
house events, altargivers now try to reach an ever; wider 
audience. 
I believe this .is related to the tradition's 
charitable aspect--to share one's goo 
nr 
with others--as 
ic; 
well. as its evolution into a large-.scale social event which has 
some amount of prestige within at least Pueblo's Italian and 
Catholic: populations. 
On the 19th, a priest chosen by the altar-giver comes to the 
home to bless the table.]:' 
Immediately after the blessing, 
people chosen by the altargi.ver- to represent saints and the 
people:; to whom the table is dedicated eat a ritual meatless meal 
of blessed food. 
They s:•it at a special table which should be 
right in front of the altar, if space allows, and which is set.

The saints must sample 
everything on the table. 
Many altargivers first serve them a 
slice of orange and a salted fish which they say represents the 
sweet and bitter- of life. 
(Anthony Cagliano says the orange is. 
also a symbol of Sicily.) 
The saints must par-take of the Saint 
Joseph's Day breads, frittate, fish, carduni, other vegetable 
dishes, wine and at least some of they baked goods. 
Before they 
leave, the altar-giver gives the saints a. 
box filled with cookies, 
cakes and pastries to take home. 
Sicilian Puebloans say that an altargiver must ask three 
people: to represent, Jesus, Mary and Joseph at the table. 
However, she can ask any number- of people to represent other 
saints, as long there in an odd number in total. 
Women are free 
to chose any saint, although some commonly represented are Saint 
Aria, Saint. Lucy and Saint. Ant..hnny, and they may ask whomever they

Obviously, the selection of saints is something a woman can 
use to send messages about her relationships with both particular

their observances for an annual cycle of saints' feasts. 
Obviously, a central element in the table tradition is 
Sicilian Puebloans' devotion to Saint Joseph, the Patriarch, 
husband to Mary, step-father of Jesus, Protector of the family, 
Patron of Workers, the Poor, the Universal Church, and of Sicily. 
A personal allegiance to this holy personage also prompted 
Josephine Martellaro to for ask for his assistance in healing her 
husband and granddaughter. 
And her love for the saint motivated 
Gen Archuletta to use the tradition as a vehicle to encourage 
others to apprEciat.e Saint. Joseph. 
This Catholicism and devotion 
to Sai.nt:. Joseph, not a Sicilian heritage, provided the social 
base for the ethnic transference of the tradition to Archu.letta 
and NErtel laro. 
But why did they chose to express their- devotion 
through a Sicilian ritual? 
The tradition's cross-ethnic movement is rooted in Pueblo's

According to IAW historian John Williams, Pueblo's ethnic 
populations were generally segregated by occupation, residency 
and in nationality-based Catholic churches. 
Through time, many. 
(but not all, particularly in the case of Pueblo's Hispanic 
community) of these ethnic divisions dissolved. 
Events which 
instigated many of these changes were the installation of unions 
in

CHECK EXACT QUOTE). 
In the last sections, ] discuss why a Slovenian woman, 
Josephine Croshal Martellaro, and a Hispanic woman, Gen 
Arcule•t.ta, adopted a Sicilian tradition. 
I examine why 
Martellaro closely adhered to a particular version of the ritual 
and why Ar-c_hulett.a adopted only some of its basic elements. 
Both 
women had consulted Bessie Ingo for assistance. 
Only Josephine 
Martellaro imitated Bessie's model for a table. 
The Martellaro Ta.bl(:_ 
Josephine:• MartE_ 1 
le:ro has a special devotion to Saint Joseph (her-
and 
 her mother's namesake), to whom she frequently prays for big 
and little favors. 
It. 
is easy to understand why she asked for-
15 
his help with her husbLnd Tony, who had severe arthritis, and for 
Brittany Carleo, a young grand-daughter who suffered severe 
e1<cema.1'5 
In return for his assistance, Josephine promised the 
saint she would make a Saint Joseph's Day table on his feast'. day. 
Because Tony's arthritis abated and Brittany Was successfully 
treated, Josephine constructed a table in 1990. 
Although the table tradition belongs to her husband's 
Sicilian heritage and not to her Slovenian culture, and even 
though she knew very little about the ritual, Josephine wanted to 
Y"e='C::reSte:° an "authentic" table. 
Her appY"EC_icat"1C]n of tradition 11'l 
general, commitment to its preservation, the notability of the 
Sai..nt. Josuph's Day table in p'ueblo's Italian community, and the 
ritual's devotional aspects .influenced her determination to 
closely follow a typical model of a table. 
However, since she was borrowing the ritual and reproducing 
it for the first time, she had to rely on the expertise of 
tradition bearers like= Bessie Ingo. 
The Martellaros and Ingo, 
who live 
 east cif Pueblo in an agricultural area known as the 
Saint Charles Hesa, have known each other for years, and Bessie' 
son is a long-time friend of Tony Martel.laro. 
Tony's ethnicity 
and social ties wave his wife access to a. 
r'e_ognized eypert on 
the tradition and to the resources needed to re-create they 
authenticity Josephine so desired. 
Conversely, one reason Bessie 
became so centrally involved in the event was because of 
Josephine's commitment to do a table "the real way." 
At first:, Josephine did not realize the amount of work: 
16 
involved in re-constructing Bessie' s idea a real table. 
HavinC. 
planned large weddings, she didn't think it would be difficult. 
She soon realized, however, that an enormous amount of wC?Y-k was 
required, and that she: could not do it alone. 
Her daughter 
Debbie Carleo and sister-in-law Jennie hodasta became= her 
principle assistants, but her other children, relatives and 
a 
friends helpe d in many ways. 
Josephine, Jennie::. and Debbbip were amazed at the myriad of 
details involved in the ritual: Bessie's insistence on using

to select people to represent saints; the blessed foods reserved 
for the saints; the appropriate meal for the general public; the 
correct: arrangement of the: :items on the gable; when to have the 
priest bless the altar. 
Obviously, much attention was given to 
the preparation of food: where to get carduni and how to cook it; 
how to mike sfinghi (cinnamon sugar cookies_), pignolati (honey 
balls), potica (breadcrumbs); fig pastries in the shape of a 
Chalice, Sacred Heart, Cross and Saint Joseph's Cane; and that it 
was okay to include snicker-doodles, peanut butter cookies, jelly 
rolls, Rice Kris•pie= treats, and krl.emkake

17 
how--to notebook which may itself become a model for future 
generat.i.ons..17 
Josephine purchased a computer- to facilitate 
storage of the table's schematic drawing, photographs, magazine 
cuticles, news clippings, recipe=, and information obtained 
Bessie Ingo, Hose Dazzio and other tradition bearers: 
Adopting the Sicilian tradition and re-constructing an 
"authentic" table indicate Josephine used the ritual to express 
several messages. 
The table became a vehicle with which she 
symbolically represented her devotion to Saint Joseph, concern 
and love for hE r family, and her willingness to assume a huge 
undertaking on their behalf, respect for her husband's ethnic 
heritage, dedication to the preservation of tradition, and esteem 
for Bessie Ingo (and other women) are bearers of the Saint 
Joseph'=s Day altar and feast. tradition. 
Gen Rrchuletta shares Bessie Ingo and Josephine Martellaro's 
devotion for Saint Joseph. 
Like them and other altargivers in 
Pueblo, she transmits messages through the tradition. 
However, 
while Josephine chose to closely reproduce Bessie's version of an 
authentic Saint Joseph's I)ay table, Gen reproduces only its, 
general form and some basic elements. 
In the next section, I 
examine achy, 
then, did Gen adopt the tradition, how she re- 
cre_at.e 
5 
i.t, 
and the message she =_ends through the table. 
The Archuletta Table 
Gorr has a special fondness for Saint. Joseph. 
Stet 
likens him to 
1i 
e 
her father, and to all fathers, who protect their families at all 
costs. 
She rpmembers her mother telling Gen's father to teach 
their sons whatever- task: he was doing, "just like Joseph: did with 
Jesus." 
And her mother would tell they children, "Help your 
father-, like Jesus helped Joseph." 
Her father and brother both-, 
have Joseph as c second name, Gen has an image of Saint Joseph on 
a home altar, and she often prays to him. 
It is easy to 
upoerstEnd why Gen would want to honor the saint .in a special way 
on his feast day. 
But why did she decided to use a Sicilian 
tradition to express her devotion? 
When she first heard about the tradition, she thought it a 
beaut.i.ful way not only to honor the saint but to "spread the 
word" about him. 
Not sure= of where to start, she asked a 
Si.ci.li.an man who shopped at the store where she worked. 
He 
directed Gen to his mother-in-law, Bessie Ingo. 
Bessie sharec:1 
her expertise, and gave her three fig pastries shaped into the 
Sacred Heart, a. Cross and they Monstrance, which Gen still uses on 
the table,. 
However, concerned about its success, Gen made a vow 
to the saint: if everything went well, she would make an altar in 
his honor- every year for the rest of her life. 
About thirty people_ attended the first observance held at 
Ben's home 18 years ago. 
because of the: 
table's success, the 
pastor at the Holy Rosary asked if she would consider moving the 
event to the church. 
Gen believes he sensed the ritual was going 
to grow among Holy Rosary's Hispanic parlshoners. 
There: were 
many reasons to assume the tradition would take hold at Holy 
19 
Rosary. 
Hispanics and Sicilians she?.re several practices based ire 
a Mediterranean religious complem (Quaggiotto 1988; Turner 1982). 
This heritage is characterized by a special devotion to Jesu=s, 
Mary and Joseph. 
William Doll, the current pastor at Holy 
Rosary, says many Hispanics in Pueblo and throughout southern 
Colorado their images on homer altars., and lAW researchers found 
the same ones in the homes of Sicilians and othF r
- Italians_.. 
Besides sharing a home altar tradition, both ethnic groups have 
the custom of processionals on feast day_:, believe saints can 
participate in earthly affairs, 
 maker vows or promises to them, 
and petition Saint Joseph in particular for favors regarding the 
family. 
Norm Bouchard, William Doll, Theresa. Spiccola, Caen 
Arehuletta, Lillian Flores commented on the groups' similar 
religious practice.. 
Additionally, Doll believes one reason his parishoners 
anoptec the. table tradition so readily is thEy can easily 
identify with Saint Joseph. 
In the sermon he gave on March} 19, 
Doll stressed Joseph's poverty, hard work., persistence and 
dedication to the family. 
the annual event, in fact, does 
reflect the economic realities of the West End, the area of 
Pueblo whore the church is located. 
Many people, from the West 
End and other Puebloans, described they church and neighborhood as 
poor. 
Poll says even if they wanted to, families 
 would not be 
able to construct home=y tables because the homes are too small 
nor- do they have the fine china or silverware others use on the 
table-=--paper- plates and cups have to suffice. 
Gen and Father 
0 
Doil agrees that the Holy Rosary altar more accurately represents 
Saint":. Joseph's situation as a poor man. 
Quaggiotto discussed; the tension between wealth and poverty 
in the; tradition's history and particularly in the performance of 
the ritual, which has a legacy rooted in Sicily's class system 
the poverty of Saint Joseph., and a pressure to produce abundant 
lavish- tables. 
Through the, decades, and despite a formerly low 
socio-economic status in Pueblo, Sicilian families have been able 
meet the ritual's requirement of plent.i.t_ude through the 
participation of the Sicilian community. 
The simpler- table is 
due not only to poorer economic support but to limited access to 
the ethnic network: which provides:. Sicilians with cultural 
resources (of course, ethnicity and economics overlap). 
Although Gen dial initially ask Bessie lingo for advice, has 
accumulated extensive files on the tradition, and welcomes the 
contributions of Sicilians and other Italians who do donate to 
the table,; she did not intend to copy an "authentic" table. 
Italian Puebl.oans applaud her efforts, and some visit her table., 
maker donations, and offer friendly advice. 
Several Sicilian 
al t.:armakprs in Pueblo have distributed flyers which invite other- 
ethnic Catholics to adopt the tradition in honor of the Patron of 
the:, Universal Church. 
However, not all Sicilians endorse a 
Hispanic:: adoption of the tradition, and Gen has re=ceived phone 
calls from ir_rate, indi.vi.dua3s. 
Gen and the women of the Altar Society, her main assistants, 
do maintain the tradition's basic element=: the central image of 
21 
Saint: Joseph; placing cookies, Saint Joseph's Day breads, fruit 
and other food on the decorated altar; blessing the food; 
donating leftovers and collected monies to charity; providing a 
meal to those- in attendence; an expenditure of 
•° 
• 
.• 
labor ,
money and 
goods in the saint's honor-; a symmetrical and colorful 
aPresPnt.at.ion; and dedication of the table: to spacial people. 
Caen places announcement for the table in the local and 
diocese paper_ to announce when on March 18 people can bring 
donations, and to invite them to attend mass and to participate:: 
in the pot luck dinner the following day. 
She directs the 
table's arrangement although many people from the church help 
her. 
At the 1VVI table, Saint Joseph stood at the center of the 
table, flanked by lilies, with a cross behind him and the fig 
pastries are in front. 
Specially ordered Saint Joseph's breads 
%:ire_' 
towards the sides, two rows of red soda add color to the 
table, 
 as do small bunches of fruits and vegetables. 
Cakes are 
made into the images of the Bible, Cross, Sacred Heart, Chalice 
and Lamb of Je sus. There are plates of cookies and mints, 
candles, and photo of men and women who are in the military. 
Perhaps 100 people carte to adnire the table, about the same 
number shared the potluck. meal. 
Some Italian visitors suggested 
the table needed: reel lilies, frittate, sardines and oranges. 
One woman, 1heresa Spiccola, offered to make the omelets next 
year 
Ann Beli.tti always donates cookies, this y'E=ar she and her . 
friend Li.ta Mondr-agon brought: pi«elle and other non-Italian 
cookie s. 
Just. an I observed at table at. the Shrine of Saint. 
22 
.(horf:_se, 
the table prompted many of the Italian visitors to 
re'rftlr'lisc:e about past. altar-s=.01:+ 
In the early evening, Holy Rosary parishoners attend a mass 
for the Feast Day of Saint Joseph. 
As we walked from the parish 
hall to they church, Gen said, 
"See 5 this is what is all about.'' 
After- the services, people joined in a buffet-style pot luck: 
diviner. 
There were several types of food served, Mexican., 
Italian and American, including meat dishes, although Gen 
prohibits meat on the tattle. 
Each year the event is dedicated to 
a certain group of people. 
in 19'91, the honorees were people who 
had loved-onus in the Persian Gulf and stationed elsewhere in the 
military. 
`fellow ribbons and the American flag decorated t:he_: 
hall, and photographs of soldiers were placed on the table by 
their families. 
These guests were served first, and received a 
slic_p of the Saint Joseph's bread Gen held during the blessing. 
Lveryone in attendance received at least cookies from the altar. 
Leftover food from the altar was donated to Pueblo's public soup 
kitchen. 
Unlike Josephine Martellaro, Gen does not have a personal 
reason to re-create a detailed "authentic" Sicilian model. 
although she recognizes the: validity of that approach and 
respects the tradition's history. 
that tradit.io7 inspired the 
table: at the Holy Rosary Church, which focuses on and reflect 
the parish community. 
Gen and William Doll related the 
simplicity of the table to the poverty of Saint Joseph and the 
parish. 
'they compared Saint Joseph to the parishoners, and held 
the saint up an a model: they work as hard as he did; Joseph 
struggled to provide and protect his family as all fathers do; 
Joseph did not give up during hard times, neither should they. 
While one focus of the Sicilian tables is how much an altargiver 
.is willing to do and sacrifice to thank: the saint for his 
resolution of a family crisis, the focus of the: Holy Rosary table 
is Saint Joseph- as a both a reflection of and model for the 
parishone:rrs' daily lives. 
Whether they are Sicilian, Hispanic or Slovenian, 
a.ltar'makers in Pueblo sh',are a devotion to Saint Joseph and use 
the ri.t:.ual 
to honor him. 
Each altarma.ker also personalizes the 
tradition to express certain things about herself. 
Its cross-
ethnic transference and individual shaping show the reproduction 
of traditiion is an interpretive process which can be 
manipulated. 
.24 
1. 
Bessie ingo's sisters Rose Dazzii, and Ann Massarotti are alsci 
recognized sources for information on the tradition. 
Like many 
of tt-it_ 
people interviewed for the 1AW project, their ancestors 
migrated from Lucca Sicula, province of Agrigento, in 
southwestern Sicily. 
. Throughout this essay I use the terms: 
Italian, Sicilian and 
Slovenian to mean Americans with those ethnic herltaCJt=':':i. 
1 use 
the term Hispanic instead of Mexican or Mexican American because 
most of 
t:i .ie 
people interviewed regarbl.ng the Hispanic adoption of 
the tradition prefer that terminology.

In the past: there were several tables given each year. 
There 
were:: no home tables in 1991.. 
However, Holy Rosary Church and the 
Shrine of Saint Therese now sponsor annual Saint Joseph's Day 
a1 tars. 
Other places where the tradition now is reproduced in

The Shrime of Saint Therese;- is a multi--ethnic pariah with 
several Italians- in the: 
congregation. 
The physical form of their 
table follows the traditional model--it is very abundantly laden 
with many types of foods, including Sicilian and Italian dishes. 
There- are not, however, people who represent saints and the 
dinner is pot luck. 
One woman who l saw first at Holy Rosary and 
then at Saint Therese said, 'Don't get me wrong, I don't want to 
knock the other table, but this is a real table.''
