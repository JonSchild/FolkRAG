VIEWING NOTES: Fieldwork was done on this event, see notes by Bea 
Roder, P. Manini, P. Taverelli, and still photos by Myron Wood. 
The other video of this event (PM-V001) is better quality. 
This 
one has a tracking problem I can't eliminate. Grainy and color is 
not wonderful (I suspect this is due to poor copying). 
Some good 
images might be used if we went back to the original. 
Sound poor.
