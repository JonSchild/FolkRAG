be remembered as somebody who told you something you already knew," and I
 
used that remark once as a topic for an essay in an introductory folklore class.
 
It produced some good answers.

And thus, pursuant  to these ends,
 
during the mid-seventies an extraordinary number of folklorists, ethnomusicologists,
 
anthropologists journeyed in and out of Washington debating strategies, defining
 
goals, rewriting guidelines, formulating standards for working with traditional
 
arts and artists -
-
 most importantly talking to each other within a kind of
 
"regardless of any other factors, what is it we really ought to be doing" context
 
that seems absolutely unbelieveable in these days of squeezed budgets, uncertain
 
and outrageous personal ambitions, and pinched and constricted dreams.
 
And what was the upshot of all this attention and activity, these many
 
long hours of debate and argument?  I think there were two developments of
 
3
 
almost equal importance: for one, a large number of responsible, enthusiastic
 
and knowledgeable people from many parts of the country became exposed to
 
the ideas that lay behind the nascent public sector folklore movement.  Indeed,
 
many of them got paid to try those ideas out, either by doing field work for
 
the Smithsonian Festival or the Library of Congress or by receiving grants
 
from NEA or NEH.  It was a period of relatively unselfconscious experimentation;
 
an awful lot of things got tried out during an extremely brief time.  Here I
 
must again single out the twelve-week Bicentennial Festival of A
merican Folklife.
 
It is still difficult for me to understand how such a breathtakingly original
 
and historically unpreceiadented event could have taken place with so little
 
public attention.  Neve

eccurr n
-g consensus around a few guiding principles upon which the past decade's
 
work has largely been based.  I won't get them all in this first try, of course,
 
but I think most people might agree in general to the following:
 
a
) that in spite of increased social and cultural centralization,
 
there are still numbers of small traditions within the United States, expressing
 
themselves through venerable aesthetic and symbolic systems of great beauty and
 
power.
 
b) that the presentation and public appreciation of these smaller
 
traditions has been generally neglected by the larger society in favor of the
 
demands of commercially backed mass culture and of the elite arts; and that
 
this neglect has interfered with the delicate processes through which cultural
 
traditions normally change and grow.

that a worthy and useful function for folklorists, ethnomusicologists
 
and others interested in contemporary traditional arts is to act as a bridge
 
between the traditional community (whether occupational, tribal, religious,
 
whatever) and the larger society, explaining and representing each to the other
 
as long as needful.
 
€) that partly out of a sense of fairness, partly out of a
 
realization that the seeds of the creative future were somehow being nourished
 
within them, the so-called tradition-bearers -
-
 whether cooks, whittlers or
 
poets -
-
 were the really important factors in the equation and needed first
 
attention -
-
 not all the attention, to be sure, but the first attention.
 
Well, those will do to go on with.  They may seem like truisms, but I
 
must tell you that when I was teaching Introductory Folklore in southern
 
California fifteen years ago, they weren't truisms then.  I-i

Like good western Europeans, we have institutionalized them.  In a glow
 
of democratic and egalitarian feeling, we have insisted that the traditional
 
arts and practices should be included in all those support mechanisms that
 
further more conventional causes.

example of this is the grant.
 
To sum up centuries of history in a few words, our current public
 
granting system stems from the experience of the private foundations, which
 
in turn represent / a century-old attempt to modify the classical patronage
 
system into something simultaneously more egalitarian and more sophisticated.
 
5
 
But the granting system is profoundly different from the patronage system,
 
starting with the primary feature that within the granting system the person
 
who is to do the job also has to think the job up.  Not only are you required
 
to have clearly in mind something of significance that you want to get done,
 
you must know approximately how you want to do it, how long it will take, and
 
how much money it will cost.
 In many situations these days you also need to
 
know where else you will find half of the required funds -
-
 all this before
 
stringing a single instrument or digging up a pound of clay.
 
Experienced public sector folklorists are already aware that few, if any,
 
-
 or c
 V c
.  L
) c.t  to  -
 
traditional communities or traditional artists can fulfill these requirements.
 
A
 
And this is where bq
c
to
 quote my old friend, Jim Griffith)64m we plunge our
 
fair bodies into the fray.
 Intent on making sure that "our folks" get their
 
fair share of the public or the private dollar, we start trying to figure out
 
how the needs of the communities and artists that we d
t
 
.L
'h can be met in
 
terms of available granting programs.  Do you see how subtly the statement
 
has shifted?  From considering what needs to happen, we have moved quite logically
 
into occupying our minds primarily with what has to happen first in order to
 
make what needs to happen happen.  This is a big change-over, and it effect is
 
to take our minds off the results and put our major attention onto the process.
 
(Process is, after all, "in" with folklorists, and we feel very comfortable
 
thinking about it.  Besides 'Ai 
t allows us to show off how well we understand
 
and control the system.)
 
I began worrying about all this a couple of years ago when I became aware
 
that I was getting ever more bored and irritated by people who insisted on
 
talking to me about problems I couldn't see how to fix with any of the available
 
6
 
granting programs I was aware of or could invent.  They made me feel incompetent.
 
I mean, here I was with all these lovely things on my tray of goodies and they
 
didn't think any of them would do.  C

 a pretty nifty system for taking care of lots of cultural
 
problems, and they had to come up with one that didn't fit!

throwing money at them," but
 
It has been occurring to me with greater and greater frequency that the underlying
 
difficulty with the granting system is more than just its focus on process (
how
 
do you get a grant?) rather than goal (what do you want a grant for?).  It
 
actually controls the way we see the world around us -
-
 because getting money
 
-t
h .t is a very powerful sign that you're thinking and seeing right -
-
 so that
 
again and again I find the reality around me being carved up into hunks appropriate
 
for treatment by a grant.
 
Now, I must say that in some respects there isn't anything wrong with

that.  You have to do something with realityA 1ou
 have to cut it up or organize
 
or label it or something. Herding and hazing reality
 . 
into manageable units is the way that our modern world has been built, and I
 
suspect that it is the way that all worlds have been built since the beginning
 
of humankind.  I would just gently propose that we should be prepared for the
 
possibility that there m
ay be larger, and smaller and more potent, and totally
 
different venues than those we now ordinarily work within in this business of

cultural conservation, and that we should alertly seek them out.  Maybe -

have to tell myself every morning -

with  an appropriate grant.  Maybe

the primary postulate that underlies cultural conservation itself: our recognition
 
of the possibility that creative solutions to the human condition may already be
 
present in systems that our larger society ignores and cancels out.

Like Janus, as public sector folklorists, we have to look forward and
 
backward at the same time.  I
've been talking about the restrictive and shaping
 
power of the granting system.  We must also remember its positive aspects: its
 
emphasis on planning, its clear-eyed analysis of where the money and the power
 
comes from an
who benefits.
 (There is a lot to be learned from a balance sheet.)
 
Another nice thing about a grant is that essentially it comes about through a
 
process of negotiatior at least in large part, and negotiation implies some
 
degree of equality and mutual respect.  I find it on the whole a relatively
 
dignified process.
 
But the grants-in-aid system is a human invention and a fairly recent
 
one at that.  It's been borne in upon me recently that a number of my colleagues
 
have never known a time when the granting system was not the only real game in

 'g
-p that it is neither guaranteed by the
 
Constitution nor written into the Bill of Rights.  It could disappear completely
 
and the work of the world would still have to go on.  Let us try to recognize
 
its advantages and its difficulties; let us learn to think cleverly and
 
precociously and flexibly within its strictures and generously and gallantly
 
outside them.  Let us try never to forget the point of what we're doing; if we
 
can just keep, as the old song says, "our eyes on the prize and hold on'  other
 
things somehow fall into place.  To turn this upon myself, if I could only keep
 
focussing on the(
rticular cultural problem being discussed in all its  lv Fy
&r 5id
L n
 
intricate glory, a grant would simply be one of the possible strategies I could
 
suggest, not the only one.
 
8
 
I feel in my heart I should speak a bit bluntly.  It seems pretty clear
 
that ) regardless of party1 an awful lot of the American people think that the
 
federal government has been spending too much money, and they're not all '
-i
-Lt-
about the states and their spending either.  Whether you or I agree or disagree
 
with them is immaterial.  We have to plan on the basis of what is likely to
 
happen, and what is likely to happen, I believe, is that the governmental flow
 
of dollars and energy is likely to be restricted in the immediate future.  Under
 
these circumstances, we must begin to think in several different directions, it
 
seems to me:
 
First, we need to mount the strongest possible defenses for the systems
 
A de4evtc
1
.,
 
that we have so far evolved.  -UP 
 
hav  oeore  sums real triu 
s ,g
 have made
 
a truly measurable difference.  We must continue to be a presence in both the
 
federal and state governments.  
W 
Second, we need to investigate thoroughly the possibility that is most
 
often suggested -
-
 that private moneys can replace governmental.  I continue
 
to regard this as both a feeble and fickle resource, but perhaps I am blinded
 
r
u
t'
.
 
by my own prejudices.  I hope so.
 
Third, we need to use our analytical training, our multi-cultural vision,
 
and every other bit of smarts we have to prc
kt ways of reaching our goals
 
that lie outside either public or private funding.  One way to start might be
 
to inventory those things that are going on right now outside our own spheres
 
of influence.  I suspect we know only a small part of what's really happening.
 
9
 
I would like now to try to demonstrate for you the ways in which I am
 
thinking about the small section of our overall activity that I myself have
 
something directly to do with: the Folk Arts Program of the National Endowment
 
for the Arts.
 These ideas are merely my own private responses to shapes -
-
tendencies -
-
 swellings -
-
 that seem to me to be forming somewhere in the
 
shifting present/future.  They are not policies nor guidelines nor even solid
 
predictions.  Maybe they are forethoughts.
 
Anyway, in terms of what the Folk Arts Program might be doing some
 
ten years from now: I think in the first place we will be needing to spend much
 
more time working with the state folk arts programs.
 I worry a lot about them.
 
Because of the volatile nature of state politics, these programs are extremely
 
vulnerable; they go up, they go down, they go in, they go out.  There is always
 
a crisis brewing somewhere, and this is just on the political front.
 Some of
 
&Mc
 çhfe  Ot YcA  n,—Je c
s
 
the state programs are highly sophisticatedV others are less so.  All of them
 
A
 
have major cultural dilemmas to solve or at least ameliorate.
 They need
 
constant infusions of specialized knowledge, both cultural and political;
 
they need lots of technical information; they need lots of the kind of tender
 
loving care they themselves lavish on smaller cultural traditions.
 I don't
 
know quite how to organize a system that would neither be intrusive nor over-
managerial to help meet all these needs, but I do know that an attempt (
or
 
many attempts) must be made.  This is a big problem, bigger than a grant.
 
Secondly, I think the Folk Arts Program needs to develop a more secure
 
approach to those many cultural problems that are larger than state-wide.  One
 
of the interesting things that has happened during this current administration

is that
 
not doing something
 The shoe is on the other foot now -
-
 we must justify why
 
10
 
we (as a federal program) are doing what we do.  This has led me to think a
 
good bit about the kinds of projects that only can be tackled by a federal
  
effort.
 I believe we will be working in larger units more often in future;
 
I think we can and should begin to think in terms of regions -
-
 both "macro"
 
and "K ni."  There are some political
 such as the Endowments
 
own Regions, that are immediately accessible, but a lot of other possibilities
 
are out there too.  And then there are the really big issues that are truly
 
national in size.  We are already underway with projects designed to return
 
to t
bw state and local communities copies of those cultural materials they had
 
entrusted to the federal government for safe-keeping; but there will be other
 
similarly truly big issues.
 I think, for example, of the need for providing
 
essential crafts materials for protecting the small industries that
 r
oLa. —

 c
wk +b
 
supplies for traditional crafts.  This well may A
 be a federal-size problem.
 
Finally, I believe that the Folk Arts Program must keep ever alive its
 
own general granting program, allowing us free and immediate access to all
 
co
/tiers of the nation where local and state governments may be temporarily
 
overlooking the needs of the smaller traditional art forms.  Besides ) this
 
category functions
 a kind of r
. and
 
d
. division, a research and development category where ideas can be tried out,
 
successes built upon, and mistakes buried in decent obscurity.
 If I were asked
 
which of the three efforts I would keep alive in spite of all, it would be this.
 
Here is where we learn.
 
We need to learn.
 I am not sure that all of us realize how remarkable
 
our task is, how unprecedented in world history our efforts are.  We have a
 
great privilege -
-
 to share in the invention of a brand new socio/cultural
 
development -
 an attempt to protect smaller cultures.  Up to now, the problem
 
11
 
has been seen as how to wipe them out most efficiently or -
-
 more humanely -
-
how to take them over or take them in.
 To be on the forefront of efforts to
 
keep them alive and well and raising their own particular brand of creative
 
hell -
-
 what a change-over!  How lucky we are to have such a really big problem.

Dear Bess:
 
Your paper,  "Hindsight and Forethought" has finally worked its
 
way to the top of the stack of conference  proceedings.
 I
've
 
enjoyed reading it,  and I think that its potential  is great.
 
wonder,  though,  if you might be interested in expanding it;  the
 
difficulty,  as I see it,  is that it's short enough to be
 
tantalizing but not long enough to be satisfying.
 More
 
pragmatically,  it's shorter than virtually all the other essays.
 
It occurs to me that you could probably use the current draft (a
 
copy of which I
'm enclosing) as an outline for a somewhat longer
 
essay.  That is,  you could fairly easily expand the paper on a
 
paragraph-by-paragraph basis,  fleshing out remarks and adding
 
examples.
 I
'd like to have a manuscript of about twenty double-
spaced pages.
 
It also occurs to me that readers might be interested in more
 
history of the NEA's involvement in folk arts.
 Related to  that
 
is the set of values and motivations underlying the folk arts
 
program.
 You articulate something of the latter on pages two and
 
three,  although it's difficult to determine whether you're
 
speaking of NEA Folk Arts in particular or of the public sector
 
movement in general.
 
Additionally,  I
'll ask that you keep in mind that the book
 
should--I hope--have a wider and more diverse audience than the
 
conference,  which suggests that you might give some thought to
 
how much reader knowledge and familiarity you can take for
 
granted.
 As you think about expanding the paper,  you might
 
consider whether the points you raise and the examples you offer
 
could stand more explanation,  more context.
 
All this is my way of saying that although I would like to see a
 
longer version of the paper I can offer no specific suggestions
 
as to how  to proceed.
 I think it's an excellent paper,  one  that
 
read well at the conference,  and its integrity and thoughtfulness
 
are striking.
 Yet I
'm in the bind of admiring the paper  but
 
considering it  too brief  for publication.
 
So,  with that admission and my very general suggestions,
 
would you like to try your hand at a new version?
 My absolute
 
deadline is Christmas;  I must have everything in hand by then.
 
Why don't you think about this for a few days and then either
 
give me a call (502 745-5905)  or drop me a note regarding your
 
response?
 I think it important,  for a number of obvious reasons,
 
that you be represented in the volume--I'm  thinking,  at least
 
tentatively,  that a longer version of this paper might close out
 
the book.
 I hope that you'll be able to find the time to work
 
something up in the time between now and Christmas.
 
Best wishes to you,  Dan,  and Barry.
