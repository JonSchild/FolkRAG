Dear Mr. Lomax:
I will be glad to have the batteries and transformer for the recording machine after
November 17. Several times we have missed good songs because we lacked these, and
the menhaden fleet songs appear to be unusually good prospects.
In the meantime, if we can receive duplicates of those already sent to the Library of
Congress, it will give much impetus to the work of locating good material by other WPA
projects. I would appreciate it if you would let me know whether this is possible in the near
future.
Sincerely yours, Carita Corse Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor, Statewide
Writers' Project.
