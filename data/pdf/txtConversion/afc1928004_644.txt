TO THE POPULACE: 
Having, during my perigrinations from town to 
town, and from tie to tie, very frequently heard the 
tune of songs sung by people who had heard them 
once only, during a 
visit to the Theatre, irrespective 
of words—other than the ubiquitous same-in-all 
languages: " De, di, dah, dum, dah," and wishing to 
place the words of the songs nightly sung in my 
AMERICAN ANGLICAN ALLIED SHOWS, in their poetic 
beauty and purity, in the hands of the public, that 
the " Di, dah, diddle, dah, do," may be shelved and 
obtain a 
long needed rest—I 
have adopted this 
cheap and simple method of permeating the Amer-
ican brain with comic and sentimental ry-thmic 
effusion. 
Trusting that this small volume may be 
the seed for a 
new crop of warblers and twitters, I 
ask you. to believe me, devotedly, 
Yours, in A 
Flat,

THE SPELL OF THE LINDEN BLOSSOM 
[BALLAD.] 
 '0:-
Arranged and sung by Mr. C. HEywoon Bonita. 
-: 
0 :-
" 
Who kisses the linden blossom, 
Her wish shall have," said she; 
"Now my lips have pressed its petals, 
I 
give it, love, to thee, 
In the bitter hour of parting, 
Hope triumphs over pain, 
The spell of the linden blossom 
Will bring thee back again." 
In the glow of golden summers. 
Thro' winters long and drear, 
She gathered the linden blossoms, 
Gathered them year by year; 
She kiss'd their fragrant petals 
While fell her tears like rain, 
" 
He will come," she softly murmured, 
" 
He will come to me again." 
He rode thro' the storm of battle 
Where glorious deeds were done, 
He kiss'd the faded blossom 
When victory was won; 
The spell of the flower he cherished 
Drew him with mystic chain, 
The spell of the linden blossom, 
It brought him back again. 
I 
Wish to Tune My Quivering Lyre.

I 
wish to tune my quivering lyre 
To deeds of fame and notes of fire, 
To echo from its rising swell, 
How heroes fought and nations fell! 
The dying chords are strung anew, 
To war! to war! my harp is due! 
With glowing strings the epic strain 
To Jove's great son I 
raise again. 
Ah! all in vain my wayside lyre 
Makes silver notes of soft desire; 
Adieu ye chiefs renown'd in arms! 
Adieu the clangs of war's alarms! 
To other deeds my soul is strung, 
And sweeter notes shall now be sung; 
My harp shall all its powers reveal, 
To tell the tale my heart must feel, 
For love alone my lyre shall claim, 
In songs of bliss and sighs of flame. 
GOOD-NIGHT, BUT NOT GOOD-BYE. 
Breathe not the word which calls a 
sigh, 
From out the cavern of the heart; 
But sweetly say when thus we part: 
Good-night, good-night, but not good-bye. 
Thine eyes have not the bitter rain, 
1%ly heart sinks not beneath the grief 
Which death, alone, can give relief, 
Were we to never meet again, 
Cnottus: 
Good-night, good-night, but not good-bye, 
Ali! little heart, why do you sigh? 
When morning dawns I 
shall .be nigh, 
Good-night, good- night, but not good-bye. 
The flowrets closing in the dell, 
To see the sun once more have faith; 
Not one among the myriads saith 
'Unto her lord " Farewell, farewell!" 
The lark that falleth from the sky, 
Sings not a 
sonnet of adieu; 
But echoes my sweet words to you, 
Good-night, good-night, but not good-bye. 
Sung with great success by JOHN BARTLEY.

Saldle up your horses, jump upon their backs, 
Crack your whip, and holler sinners clear the track; 
Gallop into glory, sure to win a 
prize, 
Road am clear, don't interfere, I'm riding to the skies. 
Good day, good day, my horse am waiting for me, 
Good day, good day, I'm first upon the track; 
The gates are open, the angels are calling me, 
I'm galloping to glory and I 
ain't a 
coming back. 
Horses jumping ditches, riders in the road, 
Crawling on my hands and knees, hopping like a 
toad 
My horse am getting weary, the dust am in my eyes, 
I'm galloping to glory and sure to win a 
prize.

KISS THE LITTLE ONES FOR ME. 
Sung by Mn. J. H ARDING. 
—:o: 
Far from home and loving faces, 
Sad the soldier keeps his post; 
In the bright watch- fire he traces 
Forms of those who love him most. 
Winds, oh bear in accents tender 
Far away across the sea, 
This, the message he would send her: 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, ye zephyrs, softly bear it, 
Gently waft it o'er the sea; 
It will corc.eort her to hear it, 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
If, perchance, the soldier ponders, 
Some stray shot should lay me low; 
Then from out the battle's thunders 
Let my dying accents go! 
Whisper words and say I 
bless them, 
And my last fond message be: 
That in fancy I 
caressed them, 
Kiss the little ones for me. 
GIVE ME BACK MY HEART AGAIN. 
Ballad. 
Sung by M R. J. 
HARDING. 
Give me back my heart again, 
I'll forget the happy past; 
You have caused me grief and pain, 
Shadows o'er my pathway cast; 
Life to me was once so bright, 
Alt! I 
dreamt 'twould so remain, 
But my hopes have vanished quite, 
Give me back my heart again, 
But my hopes have vanished quite, 
Give me back my heart again. 
et:routs: 
Give me back my heart again, 
I'll forget the happy past, 
You have caused me pain, 
Shadows o'er my pathway cast; 
But my hope.s have vanished quite, 
Give me back my kart again. 
Give me back my heart again, 
Now as strangers we must meet, 
Others smiles will soon enchain, 
Others lips thine own will greet; 
Go, forget the wrong you've done, 
Ne'er can I 
sweet peace regain, 
Though it is a 
broken one, 
Give me back my heart again.

LISTENING TO THE BIRDS. 
Song and Dance. 
Written, composed and song by J. J. Q77iNI.AN during the action 
of the " Actor's Family." 
As I 
leisurely walked out the other evening, 
When the stars in the sky berran to shine, 
I 
by chance did meet a 
lovely maiden sweet, 
Ever since I've claimed to make her mine; 
Some pretty flowers she was sprinkling. 
She smiled, and I 
rai ,ed my hat so neat, 
Her lovely eyes and golden hair has pierced my 
heart, I 
do declare, 
While listening to the little birds sing so sweet. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my! in love with her I 
fell, 
(Break) 
Among the fragrant flowers that bloom in the dell, 
(Break) 
Her cheeks so red and rosy, her ways so refined and 
neat, 
With her I 
love to walk and of the future talk, 
Down where the little birds they sing so sweet. 
I 
just received a 
note from this beauty, 
Requesting me to call on her at nine, 
To hear her dear mamma and kind papa, 
Say, " Take her, make her happy all the time," 
For me she is patiently waiting, 
And with arms outstretched me she'll greet, 
Oh, I 
-kw 
her smiling face, her elegance and grace, 
On the spot where the little birds sing so sweet. 
Chorus. 
" 
COME INTO THE GARDEN, MAUD," 
Sung by Mr. C. nEYWOOD BONING. 
NAVATINA.1 
o:--
Come into the garden, Maud, 
For the black bat night has flown; 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
I 
am here at the gate alone. 
The woodbine spices are wafted abroad 
And the musk of the roses blown, 
A 
breeze of morning moves, 
And the planet of love is on high, 
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves, 
On a 
bed of daffodil sky, 
To faint in the light of the sun she loves, 
To faint in the light and to die. 
Queen Rose of the rosebud, garden of girls 
Come hither the dances are done, 
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, 
Queen, lily, and rose in one. 
Shine out little head running over with curls 
To the flowers and be their sun. 
She is coming my own, my sweet, 
Were it ever so airy a 
tread, 
My heart would hear it and beat, 
Were it earth on an earthly bed. 
Come my own, my sweet, 
Maud, Maud, come; 
I'm here at the gate alone.

Success to the Harp and the Shamrock 
Green. 
Written and Composed by M R. TED TRAYNOR, of 
W HEATLEY & TRAYNOR. 
I'm an Irishman born, and proud for to own it, 
I 
love that dear island of green, 
'Tis acknowledged by all the home of the brave, 
Ai. I 
its daughters are fair to be seen. 
In battle its sons stand bold and undaunted, 
As oft' they have proved when put to the test, 
And their hearts' blood they give defending the banner 
That floats o'er the beautiful Isle of the West. 
CIIORtS 
Then succes.s to the boys that come from dear Erin, 
They're braver than lions—the finest e'er seen— 
In battle they've proved themselves valiant and daring 
And true to the harp and the shamrock so green. 
When war's grim alarm calls the country to arms, 
Pat is always the first in the field, 
To the front he will come at the sound of the drum, 
For an Irishman never will yield. 
Ico cowards are they, for the wide world all own 
A glorious name these heroes have made, 
What foes could withstand the terrible charge, 
Of the boys of the famous Irish Brigade. 
Chorus. 
In peace they are the jolliest boys you can find, 
For their roof they willingly share 
To a 
stranger in need with a 
hearty good speed, 
If he visits that island so fair. 
And soon may that dear little Isle of the West 
Rank wi , h 
all other nations in the world that are free, 
Proud hearts will be light in the land they love best, 
Then Paddy contented and happy will be. 
Chorus. 
.STRIKE, STRIKE THE LYRE. 
Glee, 
sung by the ALnAltnnA Qunrrtrrt, 
Strike, strike the lyre, let music tell 
The blessings spring shall scatter round; 
Fragrance shall float on ev)ry gale, 
And opening flow'rets paint the ground. 
Ohl I 
have passed whole hours in sighs, 
Condemn'd the absent fair to mourn; 
But she appears, sorrow flies, 
And pleasure smiles at her return. 
I 
love the sweep 
Of harp and trumpet's harmony, 
Like swellings of the midnight deep, 
Like anthems of the opening sky, 
But lovelier to my heart the tone 
That dies along the twilight's wing, 
Just heard a 
silver sigh and gone, 
As if a 
spirit touch'd the spring. 
Welcome is the joyous strain 
That bids the anxious lover burn, 
The smile of beauty wakes again, 
And discord flies at her return,

GONE AWAY. 
English Hunting Song. (New.) 
-:0:-
Sung by Ma. STANLEY VERNON. 
-: 0:--
The weather has broken, the frost has departed, 
The wind's in the south, and the morning is fine; 
All nature seems gay, and all men seem light-hearted, 
The long absent sun is beginning to shine; 
The Squire sits at breakfast, he's spurred and top-booted, 
His coat is as red as his big heart is gay, 
For an Englishman's life in the chase is deep-rooted, 
He's been laid by for weeks—here's a 
real hunting day. 
Tally Ho! Tally Ho! Tally Ho! Gone Away. 
CHORUS: 
Hark the gladsome horn is sounding, 
Every heart with joy is bounding, 
Dogs and horses prick their ears to hear its tune-
Where the scent is lying strongest, [ful lay, 
He's the best that stays the longest. 
Tally Ho! Tally Ho! Gone Away. 
The field thins apace as the speed becomes faster, 
And many, tho' willing, have pulled up for breath; 
The speed may stop many, but not our good master, 
The Squire on his chestnut is in at the death. 
Then hurrah for the sport that our grandfathers cher-
Hurrah for the Squire, God bless him I 
pray, [ ished, 
May his memory live when his body has perished, 
His good name remain when his soul's passed away.

Singing " Oh, that a

As deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee." 
Water well mingled with spirit's good store, 
No IIollander dreams of scorning; 
But of water alone he'd drink no more

MY LITTLE SWEETHEART. 
Sung by MR. C. 
TEMPLE. 
In the long, long ago of the vanished years, 
When the love dawn broke on high; 
In- the dreamland so old, where love is told, 
We wandered, my love and I. 
Her truthful eyes undimmed with tears, 
Her heart untouched by pain, 
That hour relieves as yesterday, 
The old dream wakes again. 
Ah! what did the angels whisper to thee, 
My little sweetheart down by the sea 
Love was their message sent thee by me, 
My little sweetheart down by the sea. 
Though the sunshine must fade from the Summer 
flowers, 
Though the moonlight dies o'er the sea; 
Yet the love dream of old will ne'er grow cold, 
The love dream I 
dreamt with thee. 
When twilight falls across the bay, 
I 
see thee as of yore; 
The golden past awakes again, 
The shadows flee once more. 
Ah! what did the angels whisper to thee, 
My little sweetheart, down by the sea? 
Love was the message sent thee by me, 
My little sweetheart down by the sea.

am a 
boatman by my trade, Jack Williams is my name, 
By a 
false, delusive girl I'm brought to grief and shame; 
She lived down in Van de Water Street, where the people 
her did know, 
She took my heart and busted it, and proved my overthrow 
CHORUS: 
Overthrow, overthrow, and proved my overthrow; 
She took my heart and busted it, and proved my over-
throw. 
I 
thought all the world of her, and she the world of me, 
But if she set her eyes on him, George Brown, just home 
from sea, 
lie set his snare to entice her heart, which to me was an 
awful blow, 
He took my 
girl, she took my heart, and it proved my over-
throw. 
Chorus. 
Now 
all young men take my 
advice, and the pretty girls be-
ware, 
And of George Brown when he's in town, with his light 
curly hair, 
He'll set a 
snare to entice your heart or yourself he will 
waylay, 
And like a 
tree one hundred years old, you'll wither and

But wander gay and free. 
By the sloping wood, where the wild deer bound, 
And the tents of the wand'ring gypsies found, 
By the sparkling fire we gaily quaff, 
The song we troll, and merrily laugh, 
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Etc. 
I 
am your king! ye joyous band, 
Then raise for me each voice and hand: 
May many a 
night like this be spent, 
With the gypsy king in the gypsies' tent.

While the wolf in nightly prowl

THE MOUNTAIN FLOWER. 
Tyrolienne Song. 
Sung only by MALVINA RENNEFL. 
A 
gentle flowret pure and true, 
Upon a 
rugged mountain grew, 
And other buds were smiling near 
Its tranquil dream to cheer; 
It gazed upon the changeful sky, 
Without a 
sorrow, tear or sigh, 
And. listened to the wood birds lay, 
In sweet contentment all the day. 
For to the flower the beauteous Spring 
Her choicest blessings loved to bring, 
With azure raiment from the tsky, 
And perfumed breath and fragrant sigh; 
'Tis thus this flowret pure ‘Tfd true, 
Upon the rugged mountain grew, 
While other buds were smiling near 
Its tranquil dream to cheer. 
A heedless youth was passing by, 
The flowret's beauty caught his eye; 
Ile bore it from its home away, 
To mingle with the proud and gay; 
But like a 
pure, celestial thing, 
Its gentle spirit soon took wing, 
And left him naught but withered leaves, 
And thoughts that mournful memory weaves 
Ah I 
happy flower, with freedom blest 
By zephyrs fondled and caressed, 
The purest gem in Nature's shrine, 
What life can equal thine? 
Ah I 
happy flower, in freedom blest, 
By zephyrs fondled and caressed, 
The purest gem in Nature's shrine, 
What life can equal thine? 
THE BLACKBIRD. 
It was on one fine morning far soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
fair damsel making a 
moan, 
Sighing and sobbing with sad lamentation, 
saying my Blackbird most loyal has flown. 
My thoughts they deceived me, reflection it grieves me, 
And I 
am o'er-burdened with sad misery; 
But if death should blind me, as true love inclines me, 
My Blackbird I'll seek out wherever I 
be. 
Once in fair England my Blackbird did flourish, 
He was the chief flower that in it did spring, 
Fair ladies of honor his person did nourish, 
Because that he was the true sun of a 
king. 
But oh ! that false fortune has proved so uncertain, 
That caus'd the parting between you and me, 
But if he remain in France or in Spain, 
I'll be true to my Blackbird wherever he be. 
In England my Blackbird and I 
were together, 
When he was the most noble and gen'rous of heart; 
But woe to the time when he arrived there, 
Alas! he was soon forced from me to part. 
In Italy he beam'd and was highly esteemed, 
In England he seems but a 
stranger to me, 
But if he remain in France or in Spain, 
All blessings on my Blackbird wherever he be. 
But if by the fowler my Blackbird is taken, 
sighing and sobbing will be all the tune, 
But if he is safe, and I'm not mistaken, 
I 
hope I 
shall see him in May or in June. 
The birds of the forest, they all flock together, 
The turtle was chosen to dwell with the dove, 
So I'm resolved in fair or foul weather, 
Once in the Spring to seek out my love. 
Oh, he is all my treasure, my joy and my pleasure, 
He's justly belov'd though my heart follow thee, 
How constant and kind, and coungeous of mind, 
Deserving of blessing wherever he be. 
It's not the wide ocean can fright me with danger, 
Although like a 
pilgrim I 
wander forlorn, 
For I'll find more friendship from one that's a 
stranger, ' 
More than from one than in Britain was born

Sure I'm a 
high-toned ' ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
For Maloney's the man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
His influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Maloney is the man.

Our Irish Invitation. 
IRISH CHARACTER SONG. 
by ARCHIE DELMANING, of DELMANING BROS., expressly for 
PAUL HAMLIN and ADA NEWCONIII, and sung by them 
with great success everywhere. 
Oh good evening to you neighbors all, 
We're the happiest Irish pair that's in the nation, 
And to-night we are going to the ball 
For to drive away all care and aggravation. 
Oh many's the happy day we've seen 
While home in Erin's isle, 
When we danced it out upon the green 
In the real old Irish style. 
CHORUS. 
And to-night when the music's playing sweet. 
We'll raise the very divil in the nation; 
We'll sing all night till broad daylight 
For to celebrate the Irish invitation. 
Kind friends if you will come with us to-night, 
We'll give you one and all an invitation, 
And when Tom Kerrigan plays the pipes 
You'll say that dancing is our occupation. 
For we learned to sing and dance when young 
In old Ireland in the bogs, 
For when our day's work it was done 
It's then we'd shake our clogs. 
And to-night, 8.:c. 
Why Don't They Let Us Vote? 
Why don't they let us vote ? 
These ugly, ugly men, 
They think we are not able, 
Our business to attend. 
You bet we'll go it strong, 
If we only get a 
right, 
We'll teach the men their station. 
If for it we have to fight. 
CHORUS. 
Then why don't they let us vote ? 
Those ugly, ugly men, 
'We'll show them we are able, 
Our business to attend. 
Now there are men around the town, 
Old bachelors at that, 
Who've got plenty of money, 
Are stubborn, rich and fat, 
If they would only marry, 
They would be of some use, 
For they could mind the babies, 
And stand all our abuse. 
Now I'm a 
single girl, 
Like Anna Dickinson; 
Now I'll have all my rights, 
Or else I 
wont have none, 
Now if there's a 
nice young man, 
Who would have me for his wife, 
I'd let voting go to the deuce. 
Arid be submissive all my life.

I've a

She's a 
rose-bud rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's derby, 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Tier nose is Grmco-Roman, 
Her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of sweet Clarabel Magee.

Oh! so sweet is Clarabel—Break. 
She sma,hes every swell—Break.

'Twould break your heart to see,

With Clarabel Magee. 
Oh! she has lots of beauxs, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a

Says I, then chuck the dice and see

Take a 
Tumble to Yourself, 
sung by Ella 3Iiirphy. 
Dedicated to Andy 
Collum. 
You've heard the latest news just out, 
And all the by-words too, 
But now I'll sing another song, 
About a 
by- word new; 
But sherry your nibbs is most played out, 
And laid upon the shelf, 
And now what every body says, 
Is tumble to yourself. 
And it is a 
useful motto, too, 
And we should bear in mind, 
That to our friends we ought to be 
Agreeable and kind ; 
But when they take you for a 
guy, 
And would borrow all your wealth, 
Just think a 
while and you'll conclude, 
To tumble to yourself. 
To you young men I'd give advice, 
When you go to take a 
wife, 
Be careful who you choose or else, 
You'll lead a 
terrible life, 
For if you see your sweet heart, 
For nought but dress and self, 
Just think a 
while and you'll conclude 
To tumble to yourself. 
And now I 
think I've sung enough, 
To make my first salaam, 
If you don't like it, why I 
don't care, 
That's the kind of a 
gal I 
am, 
For I 
aint singing here for fun. 
But a 
dollar or two of wealth, 
So I 
guess the best thing I 
can do, 
Is tumble to myself. 
THE MILITARY PRISONER. 
Written by FRED. HATFIELD and sung by DAN. MCCARTHY With 
great success. 
I'm located at Fort Leavensworth, 
In the United States M. P; 
Alexander A. MeGurkin, Boys, 
And begorrah, boys, I'll soon be free. 
Oh I 
came here it was only last year, 
To Cincinnati in Ohi-ho, I 
came through; 
And the bummers and the blackguards along the 
road would shout, 
Ah, has your mother any more like you? 
Cuours: 
Yes I'm a 
military prisoner in care of Uncle Sam, 
In the United States M. P. ; 
And as I 
pass by the gang all cry, 
Skip the gutter Alexander, tra-la-la-lee. 
They dressed me in a 
suit of soldiers clothes, 
And the pants, shure they fit me like two sacks; 
With an army jacket all bound around with yellow, 
With great big numbers on my back. 
But rye wrote to my Mary Ann, 
For to se an Alderman and also for to try 
To get my Uncle Barney for to go and see Dennis 
Kearny, 
To have me home by the fourth of next July, 
Now it's when I 
get my money in my fist, 
Its then I'll be happy and serene; 
And its down Broadway I'll march so gay, 
With my turkey and my suit of Jeans. 
And with my Mary Ann, I 
will be a 
happier man 
Than ever I 
have been since the war; 
And I'll get a 
s;tuation upon the corporation, 
And I'll never carry a 
musket any more,

LAMONT, and music by G. T. Ducnow, and 
sung with great success everywhere. 
Oh, I'm a 
happy little darkey, 
As happy as can be, 
I've got the sweetest little daisy 
That ever you did see. 
She's the fairest little creature, 
She is, upon my life ; 
There's beauty in every feature, 
And this my darling wife. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm as happy as the day is long 
And I 
lead a 
happy life 
I've got a 
little home that's cosy, 
And a 
dear sweet little wife. 
So I'm happy, and I'll tell you 
How to lead a 
happy life— 
Go court some beautiful young lady, 
And then make her your wife. 
For I'm as happy as the day is long, 
And know no pain or strife, 
And I 
bless the day I 
met her, 
My darling little wife. 
For I'm as happy, &c. 
Words by JAMES MULCAHY, Music by HARRY W OODSON. 
Sung by PETTIT & W HITE with great success. 
I'm a 
poor old strolling darkey, 
My heart is filled with woe, 
My wife and boy, my only joy, 
Have left me long ago. 
As I 
watched the moon at night, 
And how it glimmers bright, 
That thought seems to lay on my brain, 
On the banjo he would play 
And pass the time away 
In that little ivy cabin in the lane. 
ClIORUS. 
So I'll bid you all good-bye, 
0, it makes this darkey cry, 
It seems to give me sorrow and pain, 
The bird that sung so sweet, 
It makes this old man greet, 
In that little ivy cabin in. the lane. 
I 
now will mention a 
man of fame, 
0, now to you I'll tell, 
Old Abe Linc"In is his name, 
guess you all know well. 
He set this darkey free, 
0, he filled his heart with glee, 
I 
hope Ill see old Abe again; 
For I'm going to a 
home, 
Where the angels all do roam, 
Far from the ivy cabin in the lane.

None of That in Mine. 
r-
New songs are now the programme, 
And order of the clay, 
As I 
like to keep up with the times, 
I 
have to run that way ; 
New by-words come up every day. 
And are soon put into rhyme. 
But the latest one that's got the boys, 
Is, I'll take none of that in mine. 
I 
wouldn't be old Lucy Stone, 
Who goes in for woman's rights, 
For then to catch a 
sweetheart, 
I'd never have a 
sight; 
I'm not such a 
foolish elf, 
As to live single all the time, 
And as for dying an old maid, 
I 
don't want any of that in mine. 
I 
wouldn't be a 
yankee, 
And hail from Lowell town, 
For there a 
cross-eyed Congressman, 
Is oft seen bobbing round; 
He always takes all he can see, 
And keeps grabbing all- the time, 
'When it comes to nipping silver spoons, 
I 
wont have any of that in mine. 
I 
wouldn't be a 
radical, 
Just at the present station, 
For I 
can't go the President, 
Nor any of his relations; 
I 
have no bull pups to give him, 
Or presents of any kind, 
And when it comes to loving niggers, 
I 
don't want any of that in mine. 
A 
beautiful Poem, written by Coy. T. MURPHY. Recited by 
JAMES RUSSELL and JOHN PENDY. 
 :0: 
You ask me, mates, to spin a 
yarn before we go below, 
Well as the night is calm and fair, and there's no chance 
for a 
blow, 
I'll give you one, one as true as ever yet was told; 
For mates I 
wouldn't lie about the dead—no not for gold. 
The story's of a 
maid and lad who loved in days gone by; 
The maiden was Meg Anderson, and the lad, messmates, 
was I, 
A 
neater, trimmer craft than Meg was very hard to find; 
Why, she could climb a 
hill and make fire knots agin the 
wind; 
And as for larnin' bulks and spars, lye of ten heard it said 
That she could give the scholars points, and then come 
out ahead. 
The old schoolmaster used to say, and mates it made me cry, 
That the smartest there was little Meg; the greatest dunce 
was I. 
But what cared I 
for larnin' then, while she was by my 
side? 
For though a 
lad, I 
loved her, mates, and for her would 
have died; 
And she loved me, the little lass, and often have I 
smiled 
When she said: " I'll he your little wife," 'twas the prattle 
of a 
child; 
For there lay a 
gulf between us mates, with the waters 
running high 
35 
LITTLE MEG AND I. 
3!; 
LITTLE MEG AND I— CONTINUED. 
On one side stood Meg Anderson, on the other side stood I. 
Meg's fortune was twelve ships at sea, and houses on the 
land, 
While mine—why, mates, you might have held my fortune 
in your hand, 
Iler father owned a 
vast domain for miles along the shore, 
My 
father owned a 
fishing-smack, a 
hut and nothing more. 
I 
knew that Meg I 
ne'er could win, no matter how I'd try, 
For on a 
couch of down lay she, on a 
bed of straw lay I. 
I 
never thought of leaving Meg, or Meg of leaving me, 
For we were young and never dreamed that I 
should go 
to sea, 
Till one bright mornin' father said: " There's a 
whale ship 
in the bay, 
I 
want you, Bill, to make a 
cruise—you go aboard to- day." 
Well, mates, in two weeks from that time, I 
bade them 
all good-bye, 
While on the dock stood little Meg, and on the (leek stoedl. 
I 
saw her oft, before we sailed, whene'er I 
came on shore, 
And she would say : " Bill, when you're gone, I'll love you 
more and more, 
And I'll promise to be true to you through all the coming 
years," 
But while she spoke, her bright blue eyes would fill with 
pearly tears. 
Then, as rd whisper words of hope, and kiss her eyelids 
dry, 
her last words were: " God speed you, Bill." 
So parted 
Meg and I. 
Well, mates, we cruised for four long years, till at last 
one summer's day, 
Our good ship—the Minerva—east anchor in the bay. 
37 
LITTLE MEG AND I-CONTINUED. 
Oh! how my heart beat high with hope, as I 
saw her home 
once more, 
And on the pier stood hundreds, to welcome us ashore; 
But my heart sank down within me as I 
gazed with anx-
ious eye, 
No little Meg stood on the dock, as on the deck stood I. 
Why, mates, it nearly broke my heart when I 
went ashore 
that day, 
For they told me that Meg had married, while I 
was far 
away. 
They told me too, they'd forced her to't, and wrecked her 
fair young life. 
Just think, messmates, a 
child in years, to be an old man's 
wife. 
But her father said it must be done, and what could she 3 
reply? 
For she was only just sixteen, just twenty-one was I. 
I
.Well, mates, a 
few short years from then—perhaps it might 
, 
be four, 
One blustering night, Jack Glinn and I 
were rowing to 
the shore, 
When right ahead we saw a 
sight that made us hold our 
breath— 
There, floating in the pale moonlight, was a 
woman cold 
.in death. 
I 
raised her up: Oh! God! messmates, that I 
had passed 
her by, 
For in the bay lay little Meg, and over her stood I.

Sung with immense success by 'TARRY M ONTAGUE, the great vocal 
comedian. 
When I 
was a 
little lad and the darling of my dad, 
I 
was troublesome as troublesome could be; 
If I 
saw a 
little boy and he had a 
little toy, 
I 
was sure to make him give it up to me. 
And if he would say nay, I 
would upset all his play, 
A proceeding which was sure to bring me blame; 
And although my cheeks were often dripping with the 
scolding and the whipping, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game. 
CHORUS: 
The same old game, the same old game, 
I'd a 
spirit that my daddy couldn't tame: 
For it mattered not to me what it cost me for a 
spree, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game. 
Nov when I 
older grew, more of mischief I 
still knew, 
For danger with my doings did increase; 
Let the time be day or dark, I 
was up to every lark, 
And our neighbors never knew a 
moment's peace. 
Ringing door-bells, breaking lamps, pitching into rogues 
and tramps, 
While fighting all the bummers gained me fame; 
And although each little spree was very dear to me, 
I 
carried on the same old game. 
In time I 
grew a 
man, yet still mischief was my ban, 
For I 
made the pretty darlings my delight; 
Big or little, dark or fair, it would never matter where, 
I 
was teasing them from morning until night. 
And to each and all I 
said " Some fine day we will get wed 
And there was at least a 
dozen made a 
claim; 
So the judges in the courts fined me heavy for my spor 
But I 
carried on the same old game. 
Now I'm settled down in life and I've got a 
little wife, 
We're as happy, yes as happy as can be; 
But I 
regret to state that I 
often stop out late.' 
And then she raises " Ned" with me. 
But all that is amiss I 
settle with a 
kiss 
And thus my little darling do I 
tame; 
But sometimes she comes it strong, for her nails are rather 
long, 
-Yet I 
carry on the same old game. 
Cnonus: 
The same old game, the same old game, 
I'd it temper that my daddy couldn't tame; 
For it mattered not to me what it cost me for a 
spree, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little biro up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Cuouus: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short.visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog-dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. (Cho.) 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
ft iend, Paddy Brock; 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghegan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The barkeeper shot me a 
glance; 
" lowld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

I'm Lonely Since I 
Lost My Tom. 
Written by FRED HATFIELD, and sang with great success by

McCAirray in his Celebrated Sketch entitled 
The Irish Fair. 
Bad luck to Bergh and the City Father, 
And the blackguards that made up that law, 
They can't find its equals from here to Chicago, 
Or from there, my boys, to Arkansaw ; 
I 
had, a 
cat, he was a 
daisy, 
His color was gray, he was two foot long, 
I'd give ten dollars if I 
could collar 
The sucker that stole away my Tom. 
CHORUS: 
He was a 
darling, he sang so charming 
- 
In our back yard the whole night long, 
I'd go without my supper to catch that sucker 
Who went and stole away my Tom. 
He bate the cat of McNally, 
He was the champion of our back yard, 
He ran against Mrs. Duffy in Fagan's Alley, 
And gave the poor soul a 
very bad fall; 
He was thrown from a 
roof and turned ten times over 
He was poisoned twice now, sure that's wrong, 
But the cat-catchers caught him, and away they 
brought him, 
Sure I'm lonely since I 
lost my Tom. 
My old woman saw young Michael Kelly 
With our Tommy in his arms, 
But he being the son of a 
good, old neighbor, 
She didn't think that he meant any harm; 
But she heard he sold him for a 
quarter, 
To a 
cat-catcher by the name of Long, 
But if I 
catch that snoozer, you may bet that I'll 
bruise him, 
For I'm lonely since I 
lost my Tom.

I'm thinking to-night of the old rustic bridge, 
That bends o'er the murmuring stream; 
'Twas there, :Maggie dear, with our hearts full of cheer, 
We stray'd neath the moon's gentle gleam. 
'T was there I 
first met you—the light of your eyes 
Awoke in my heart a 
sweet thrill. 
Tho' now far away, still my thoughts fondiy stray, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
Beneath it the stream gently rippled, 
Around it the birds loved to trill; 
Tho' now far away, still my thoughts fondly stray, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. 
now often, dear Maggie, when years passed away, 
And we plighted lovers became; 
We rambled the path to the bridgc day by day, 
The smiles of each other to claim,; 
But one day we parted in pain and regret, 
Our vows then we could not fulfil; 
Oh! may we soon meet and our fond love repeat, 
On the old rustic bridge by the miil. ( Chorus). 
I 
keep in my mem'ry our love of the past— 
With me ' tis as bright as of old; 
For deep in my heart it was planted to last, 
In absence it never grows cold. 
I 
think of you, darling, when lonely at night, 
And when all is peaceful and still; 
My heart wanders back in a 
dream of delight, 
To the old rustic bridge by the mill. (Chorus) 
Sung by Stanley's Allied Snows.

Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by; 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew; 
I 
heard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem; 
Oh, vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

Sung with tremendous success by Gus W ILLIAMS, America's 
Greatest Star Vocalist. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker, so stately and tall, 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker my sister and I, 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
how poor aged grandpa in tierce battle fell, 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
lie cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days, and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride, 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her in the " sweet by-and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap, 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
A 
Leaf of Ivy from my, Mother's Grave. 
Originally composed by CRARLES SAVILLE, and sung with great 
success in all the leading Theatres in America. 
I 
went to Greenwood, yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I 
knelt beside the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave. 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And 'tis only in my visions 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Cnonts: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And ' its only in my visions 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was not welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
did roam, 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save: 
Is this little leaf of Ivy, 
A 
leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave. 
iChorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home. 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above; 
Where we'll ne'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endless love. 
(Chorus).

I'm leaving now the old folks, I

I'm leaving them in sorrow, grief and care; 
They're poor and almost helpless, they're old and feeble,

So I

My mother's heart will nearly break when I

They're poor and almost helpless, they're old and feeble, too, 
So I

Oh, who will love the old folks, when I 
am far away? 
Oh, who will cheer their sad hearts day by day? 
They've petted and caressed me through childhood's tender 
years, 
And now I'm leaving them in grief and tears. 
But I 
will write a 
letter when I've found some work to do, 
And tell them how I 
missed them, that my heart to them 
is true; 
Their faces then will brighten, when they shall both read 
this; 
I'll write it and I'll seal it with a 
kiss. 
OVER THE GARDEN WALL. 
Sung with great success by FANNIE and JEPPE DELANO. 
Oh! my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall; 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes, and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chair, 
And many a 
time have I 
kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
Chorus—Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you can bet Ill never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamped and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old mad- man he behaved, 
Over the garden wall; 
She made a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my bead, 
lie gave me a 
bucket of water, instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
(C horus). 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over tha garden wall; 
But she screamed in a 
fright, " Here's father, quick, 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick," 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick, 
Over the garden wall. 
(Chorus). 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall, 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall; • 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. ( h

MONEY I 
MONEY!! MONEY!!! 
The Clouds Are Rolling By, J3111110. 
Sung by BILLY CARTER, of the " Comedy 4 
Co." with great success. 
Oh, money in the pocket is a 
very nice thing, 
Oh, money is the thing for me; 
Call for what you please, live at your ease, 
And be as happy as a 
bumble bee. 
But if you're broke, and got no tin, 
And feel that you must die, 
You may be good-looking, but you can't come in, 
And there is no use for to try. 
Chorus—Oh, money is the milk in the cocoanut, 
Oh, money is the cream in the jug; [money 
Oh, money is my honey, if you've got plenty of

bug in a

Oh, money is a 
good thing to have when you're sober 
It's a 
good thing to have when you're drunk, 
Never go to jail, gets lots of bail, 
If you've got plenty of sugar in the trunk. 
Steamboat selling for two cents apiece, 
You couldn't buy a 
solitary plank, 
They'll hit you in the jaw, and take you to the law, 
And arrest you for looking at a 
bank. (Chorus). 
When a 
married man with a 
big family, 
And his pocket- book's all gone to smash, 
Hasn't got a 
cent, ought to pay the rent, 
And the landlord is looking for the cash, 
Then love takes a 
flop, out the window pops, 
The devil flies in at the door, 
Parents drinks gin, troubles begin, 
Pot don't boil any more. 
Chorus—When the house rent's high, and the kids all cry, 
Because no grub for to chaw, 
You'll holler for you son to load up the gun, 
While you vaccinate your mother-in-law.

Jennie, our days were dreary, 
Your tearful eyes grew sad; 
Once you were bright and cheerful, 
Singing your song so glad. 
Cheer up, the skies are brighfning, 
No more, my own, repine; 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie, 
Soon will the sun-beams shine. 
CHORUS: 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie, 
The clouds are rolling by; 
Never again we'll sorrow, 
The clouds are rolling by. 
Out on the stormy ocean 
My thoughts were still of you, 
Leaving the land of sorrow, 
Leaving your heart so true; 
You were my guardian angel, 
Bidding me not repine; 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie, 
Soon will the sun-beams shine. 
Soon I 
will fondly clasp you 
Within our own dear home, 
Over the storm- tossed ocean, 
Never again to roam; 
Dark, weary days are over, 
Never again repine; 
The clouds are rolling by, Jennie, 
Soon will the sun-beams shine.

Young people all, both great and small, come listen to my 
news, 
It is a 
soncr I'm going to sing of the murder in Cohoes; . 
When Catherine Dunsbach, the victim, was slain in her 
house, you all know, 
And Latrimouille he murdered her, and soon to the gal-
lows he'll go. 
Next day the people they all knew, when the Coroner 
spread the news, 
That Latrimouille had murdered her and gone out of 
Cohoes; 
No one saw him murder her, it was all between them both, 
But the Doctor soon examined her, and said he'd cut her 
throat. 
He walked along the street so mild, and was in the best of 
cheer, 
lie walked down into Shep's saloon and called for a 
glass 
of her; 
They viewed his hat, his shirt, his pants, his coat, his vest, 
his shoes, 
And he was at the mercy of the policeman in Cohoes. 
And soon the detectives followed him all around the coun-
try and back, 
They arrived at Port Henry, and found him in a 
black-
smith shoo; 
They brought him back to Cohoes Jail, where he was 
guarded well, 
They shut the door and locked him up in a 
murderer's 
dark cell. 
51 
THE MURDER IN- COMES—CONTINUED. 
For three long months he lay in jail and no one could he 
see, 
Except his father and his mother and a 
Priest from Albany; 
He chewed and smoked the whole day long, and at night 
fell on his knees, 
And begged the Lord to pardon him for all his wicked 
deeds. 
The morning of his trial he grieved till his heart was sore, 
To hear the witnesses of Cohoes how hard on him they 
swore; 
Some did their duty nobly, before our blessed Lord, 
While others shouted, hang him, or we'll lose a 
big reward. 
The morning after his trial, as you ean plainly see, 
The Jury went into a 
back room, and soon they did agree; 
The Jury found him guilty, and the Judge made this reply: 
On the twenty-ninth of August you are condemned to die. 
For seven long weeks he lay in jail, and all this time he 
hoped 
That he might gain his liberty before he saw the rope; 
But now my days are ended, I 
bid you all farewell, 
it's many a 
dark and dreary night I've laid in a 
murderer's 
I 
say farewell to my father, likewise my mother, dear, 
I 
say farewell to my loving wife—my child I'll ne'er see; 
I 
am dying on the gallows—my children never tell, 
And when I'm dead and in my grave I 
bid you all fare-
well. 
And now I 
ascend the scaffold steps, I 
bid you all adieu, 
The hangman is a 
w..itine-, 
tis a 
quarter after two; 
The black cap now is on my face, no longer can I 
see, 
And when I'm dead and in my grave, the Lord remember 
me.

(The briar's in bud, the sun going down), 
And I'll row ye so quick, and I'll row ye so steady, 
And ' tis but a

haven't a

And how shall I 
get me to Twickenham town?

As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat, 
With her cheeks like a

SLAVERY DAYS.

Published in sheet form by Wm. A. POND & CO., 547 Broadway, N. Y. 
Price 40 cents, 
I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny Suae, it was dar we separate, 
And it 1111'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in the cradle we him raise: 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Cnonts: 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
in dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old Cabin floor; 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, we would de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me: " You p. ople must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan; for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sickness, toil and sorrow I 
have reach'd de end 
at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun. \then our souls dey were 
tied down, 
Iu dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

I was born in Boston, 
A 
city you all know well; 
Brought up by honest parents— 
The truth to you I'll tell— 
Brought up by honest parents 
And raised most tenderly, 
'Till I 
became a 
sporting man 
At the age of twenty-three. 
My character was taken 
And I 
was sent to jail; 
My friends found that it was in vain 
To get me out on bail; 
The jury found me guilty, 
The Clerk he wrote it down, 
The Judge then passed my sentence— 
I 
was sent to Charlestown. 
To see my aged father 
A. standing at the bar, 
Likewise my aged mother 
A tearing of her hair— 
The tearing of her old gray locks, 
While the tears came rolling down, 
Saying: " Son, dear son, what have you don( 
That you are sent to Charlestown." 
THE BOSTON BURGLAR—CONTINUED. 
I 
was put on board an eastern train, 
That cold December day, 
And every station that we passed, 
I'd bear the people say: 
There goes that Boston burglar, 
In strong chains he'll be bound; 
For some crime or another, 
He is off to Charlestown. 
There is a 
girl in Boston, 
A 
girl that I 
love well, 
And if ever I 
get my liberty, 
Along with her I'll dwell; 
And if I 
ever get my liberty, 
Bad company I'll shun, 
Likewise night walking, gambling, 
And also drinking rum. 
All you who have your liberty, 
Pray keep it if you can, 
And don't go 'round the streets at night 
To break the laws of man, 
For if you do you'll surely rue, 
And find yourself like me, 
Who am serving out my twenty-one years 
In the penitentiary.

There's an old-fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old-fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old-fash:oned gate by the old country road, 
And an old-fashioned man near the chair. 
An old-fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fa•zhioned cap on her old-fashioned head, 
And she's dressed in her old-fashioned clothes.

Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a

There's an old•fw-hioned clock on that old whitewashed 
With its old-fashioned pendulum and hands; [ wall, 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper ket ties and pans. 
An old-fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old-fashioned clay, 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. ( Chorus). 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live so for years, 
In that dear little house in the lane; 
May they never know a

May you live, yes, for many, many years;
