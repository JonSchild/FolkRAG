That Awkward Old Song
THAT AWKWARD OLD SONG 5110 B1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
I went to the barn my steers to feed -Did ever you hear that awkward old song? I went to
the barn my steers to feed I fed 'em my saddle, hung up the feed We'll all sing as awkward
as ever we can.
I rode into town, walked all of the way -Did ever you hear that awkward old song? I rode
into town, walked all of the way I was stifled on dust for it rained all that day We'll all sing
as awkward as ever we can.
Met the king and the queen, their company was mine -Did ever you hear that awkward
old song? Met the king and the queen, their company was mine A-riding on horseback, a-
leadin' behind We'll all sing as awkward as ever we can.
It rained and it hailed, it blew a great storm -Did ever you hear that awkward old song? It
rained and it hailed, it blew a great storm Kept my hat on my arm to keep my head warm
We'll all sing as awkward as ever we can.
I rode the gray mare with a crease down her back -Did ever you hear that awkward old
song? I rode the gray mare with a crease down her back Not a hair on her that wasn't coal
black We'll all sing as awkward as ever we can.
I rode into town, not a soul did I see -Did ever you near that awkward old song? I rode into
town, not a soul did I see Ten thousand people was gazing at me We'll all sing as awkward
as ever we can.
