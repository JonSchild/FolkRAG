Introductory comments. Name. Place of interview. 
 
00:01:00 
Can you give your background information? 
Janet lives about 15 miles from Hayward in Stone Lake, Wisconsin.  She was 
born in Chicago in 1957. 
 
00:01:35 
How did you make your way to Hayward? 
My parents were teachers.  They were married a while before I was born.  They 
bought property in this area through one of my father’s students.  So our 
neighbors are relatives of one of my father’s students.   
 
Transitioned from Chicago to Hayward at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 
1990s is when she transitioned from Chicago to Hayward.  “Not a clean break.” 
 
00:02:15 
Occupational path to becoming a teacher? 
I think because I was the child of teachers, I always wanted to be a teacher.  But 
my parents always told me not to be a teacher because I couldn’t handle the 
politics of it.  They said I’d be fine with the teaching part, but the other part I 
wouldn’t be able to handle. So that was the guidance I got from my parents.  
 
I also grew up with the vision of my father was always grading papers at night.  
So that’s what the school year looked like with Dad with a red pen in his hand.

So, I did see the stress of having teachers who were parents, or parents who 
were teachers.    
 
And, also because my parents spent a lot of time with kids all day long, and I was 
an only child, I grew up fairly fast and fairly in my own world too.  I didn’t have a 
lot of parent-child time and I didn’t have a lot of time with other kids.  So that was 
not a great aspect of growing up.  
 
00:03:25 
Attended Lane Technical High School, an all male high school until 
she got there. She started as an art major but that didn’t work out well due to 
some teachers so she became a math/science major in classes with probably 13 
males to every female.  Then she went to Northwestern University as a theater 
major, in classes with 13 females to every male (laughs). She acted in Chicago 
for 10 years.  Due to her mom’s cancer and other factors (a guy), Janet moved to 
Hayward and was waitressing for a while but then fell into education and went 
back and got an education degree at University of Wisconsin-Superior.  
 
00:04:20 
Were you commuting or did you move to Superior? 
She took some classes there but took a lot of classes through their extended 
degree program.  She worked as a teacher’s aide in Birchwood for a year.  She 
started her teacher training and was hired to work as a Gifted and Talented aide 
in the Hayward Community School District but actually was writing curriculum 
and teaching just with aide’s pay.  Then she got her teaching certificate.   
 
00:05:00 
How old were you when you went back for the teaching degree? 
She was in her late 30s. But more and more people I know are entering the 
teaching profession later in life. These are people who have raised their children 
and are excellent parents have decided to become teachers in their 30s.   
 
00:05:45  What was it about your parents’ lives as educators that appealed to 
you?  
They both had, they had really distinctly different personalities.  My dad was the 
more charismatic.  He had a lot of interesting projects. He taught science and for 
a while he taught art so interesting projects.  He also had a huge following of 
student fans.  Fellow Girl Scouts knew her father as a teacher, so she saw her 
father through other kids’ eyes as a celebrity.   
 
Her mother was lower key but passionate about education and the learning 
process.  She was always learning; she was always evolving; she was always 
changing, so that part was always appealing.  Some classes of hers had 
interesting combinations of kids; Janet helped with those classes when she was 
just out of college, developing close relationships with some of her mother’s 
unique classes. 
 
00:07:30 
Did any inspiring education instructors at UW-Superior reinforce 
those admirable traits of your parents? 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

This is really sad to say, but not really.  It was the old school teaching.  She 
enjoyed it but it wasn’t as challenging as at Northwestern.  The teachers hadn’t 
been in classrooms enough so the skills needed to teach, they weren’t able to 
address. So it was all theory; not enough practice.   
 
00:08:25 
Did you get some of that practice with your student teaching? 
Yes, in student teaching and also when she had already been working in Gifted 
and Talented. She’d seen what things were like in school and had a sense of 
classroom management.   
 
00:08:45 
What are classroom management/practical skills that teachers 
need that you didn’t get through your classes? 
Ideally you think it’s all going to be like “Leave It to Beaver.”  You’re going to be 
Miss Landers. They’re all going to be sitting there with their hands folded on their 
desks, just welcoming any words of wisdom you have to say.  But it’s kids who 
are coming from really rough backgrounds.  And kids with ADHD.  And kids with 
very different specific needs.  And kids who don’t have a lot of socialization skills, 
and impulsive behaviors; and really rough things going on at home with these 
kids.  It’s not a homogenous group of 25 kids.  It’s 25 distinct individuals with very 
intense distinct needs.   
 
00:09:50 
Can you take me through a typical day for you?  But first, explain 
who you teach and where you teach. 
She teaches 5th grade at Hayward Intermediate School.  That’s a building with 
students in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades.  25 students.  One is severely disabled; she 
joins the class only for certain social activities. Two students are in special ed: 
one who is fairly disabled with autism, who is in the class part of the time and 
three other students (one with autism) who are in the class part of the time and 
see a special ed teacher part of the time.  Her class is about half white students 
and half Native American students.   
 
00:10:55  
And the Native Americans being Ojibwe from…  
 
00:10:58 
…Lac Courte Oreilles tribe. Also, she has 19 girls and 6 boys.   
This is not a typical year in terms of girl/boy ratio but yes for everything else. 
 
00:11:15 
Describe a typical day. 
She arrives at 7:30 to organize.  Students come down the hall at 8:05 to be in the 
classroom at 8:15.  She meets them at their lockers.  Two students have 
homeless problems and others have organizational problems so she checks with 
them quietly to get an update and give them time in the classroom to get 
themselves organized.  She watches how the other children in the hall are doing.  
They are in the classroom at 8:15 when there are announcements on the PA: the 
lunch menu is read, the Pledge, announcements about special days – it’s a nice 
centering activity.  Then she does lunch count, attendance, collects forms, etc.  
She leads a whole group activity to get everybody involved to start the day.  At 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

8:40, three students go to one teacher and one student goes to another teacher. 
Technically, from 8:30 – 10:30 is the Language Arts block, which is generally one 
half-hour of reading, one half-hour of writing, one half-hour spelling, and one half-
hour on an independent reading/writing project.  At 10:30, two students go to one 
place for extra help and another student goes to another teacher for extra help 
and the rest do Social Studies, which is not being graded this year. Same with 
Science – it is not being graded this year and not being taught as specific classes 
– because of the emphasis on Common Core and English Language Arts and 
Math.  At 11:00, she introduces the new math curriculum intensely for one hour.  
At 12:10, lunch.  Sometimes she has lunch duty.  So sometimes at 12:40, she 
gets to go to the bathroom for the first time all morning (laughs). Then she has a 
half-hour duty-free time, during which she usually walks with another teacher 
outside so they can regroup and get ready for the afternoon.  She has 20 
minutes after the students come in from recess; they work on either math or a 
read-aloud or another activity.  At 1:20-2:15 they go to a special on a 7-day 
rotation: Gym three days, Art one day, Music two days and Library one day.  
From 2:15 – 3:00 they try to catch up on work.  The workload is very heavy this 
year because of the emphasis on Common Core. At 2:30, two students go to one 
teacher for extra help and another student goes to another teacher for extra help. 
At 3:10, the day is over.  At 3:45, I’m supposed to be able to leave.  By 5:00, I 
might get out of there.  (laughs)  That’s a typical day. 
 
00:14:50 
What do you do in those after hours? 
Calling parents, emailing parents, filling out reports, lots of paperwork with RTI 
(Response to Intervention), plus other Common Core things, getting assignments 
ready for the next day, working on lesson plans, straightening the room, endless 
teacher meetings.  It feels like a thousand things.  I feel like if I leave at 5, it’s the 
tip of the iceberg in terms of what needs to be done and what could be done and 
what projects I’m working on. 
 
00:15:25 
Do you make yourself leave at 5? 
I’m trying to, really hard. 
 
00:15:30 
Is your evening devoted to continuing to work? 
It is, though it’s not supposed to be.  That’s my goal, to make it not about 
continuing to work.  I’d really be happy if I stopped dreaming about school or 
waking up at 3:30 in the morning writing poems about my frustration with this 
new math program.  (laughs) 
 
00:15:55 
I’m sorry that you’re so frustrated with the math program but I love 
that you’re writing poems about it! Is it a venting exercise or an artistic exercise 
or both? 
It’s both. And it’s really processing and it’s processing how I was in school and 
what was valuable for me in school.  And where the pendulum is right now and 
where the weakness is in instruction right now. When I entered teaching about 15 
years ago, there was a very formulaic and by-the-book way of teaching. Writing 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

would be pretty standardized. So stories were not particularly creative but the 
structure was goo;, the sentences were well written; the form was there, things 
like that.  Kids knew their math facts; kids knew how to solve problems.  They 
may not be able to do higher level thinking math problems but they could multiply 
three digits by three digits and get the correct answer.  Then Common Core 
came – no, before Common Core it was No Child Left Behind.  That was a big 
transition for us.  I’m not sure how it was interpreted in all school districts but in 
our school district the way it was interpreted was, well, the result was a lowering 
of the standards.  So we were teaching to the students at the bottom as opposed 
to teaching to the students at least in the middle, or what we’d hope they’d be 
able to do at the top.  That really damaged a lot of the kids, I think, in terms of 
their ability to learn.  So, it’s bouncing back from that.  Now with Common Core, 
the curriculum that we’ve been told to use is way at the other end of the 
spectrum. So I have very low readers reading very advanced books and trying to 
teach higher level math skills with students who don’t know their math facts.  So I 
feel like a little bit we’re all caught between a rock and hard place right now.   
 
I started out teaching Gifted and Talented.  I can extend activities.  I know how to 
push activities.  I know how to enrich.  But without the foundation skills, the kids 
are really in bad shape.  And I’m not faulting our district for that.  I’m not. It’s, I 
think, the changes were forced on us.   
 
00:19:10  
(Pryor turns on the lights in the room) 
 
00:19:20 
How do teachers as a group deal with these changes and stress? 
We have to rely on each other more.  The 5th grade team is in its own wing.  
Before, if you were having problems with a student, you might not share.  Now, 
they have to share as a coping mechanism.  But there are goofy times too.  
There are two men in their hall; the football gets thrown in the hall after school.  
There are some practical jokes too but Janet can’t think of any specific ones right 
now. 
 
00:20:40 
Are there jokes or humor? 
Yes.  Because they know a lot of people in common and know their qualities, 
they can make a reference that anyone within their circle would understand 
because they have camaraderie and shared secrets. 
 
Another unique thing about their team is their wide age range, from the youngest 
teacher in the school to the oldest, about 24 years old to Janet (age 56).  The 
youngest is also the newest and while Janet’s the oldest, she is only second in 
seniority in 5th grade.  It’s interesting to have the different perspectives from the 
gender difference and the wide age range.   
 
00:22:00 
Are there broader coalitions beyond the 5th grade team? 
They have a new principal this year who was vice principal in the primary K-2 
building.  She’s working to build more of a community and more connections 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
 
6 
among staff.  One thing the principal did this year that was fun – for the lyceum at 
the beginning of the year to talk about core values and get the kids excited for 
the school year, each grade level team was assigned 2 core values to do a skit 
about.  There were mixed reactions from the teachers who have so much else to 
do and then in addition had to do a skit. But they were very entertaining.  The 3rd 
grade team dressed as rock stars with wigs and flashy clothes. They filmed a 
rock video of them behaving appropriately: helping a kid cross the street or 
picking up garbage in the hall.  The 4th grade teachers did a rap.  Janet’s 5th 
grade team had placards that spelled RESPECT.  They had images for each 
letter.  Janet had R and on the back was Raise Your Hand.  The school theme is 
“Like a ‘Cane” so you want to “read like a ‘cane” or “do good things like a ‘cane” 
so they had “RESPONSIBILITY” on one side and then flipped it so it read “like a 
‘cane.”  They came out wearing hats and dark sunglasses and neckties to Aretha 
Franklin’s “Respect.”  And I strut to that song.  (laughs) So there’s a 4th grader 
who refers to me as “Mrs. Cool Teacher.” (laughs) But it forced us to work 
together and it forced us to problem solve.  We come with different skills so it 
was good as team building.   
 
00:24:30 
Is there much socialization after school? 
Lately a second grade teacher has been trying to get everyone together each 
Wednesday, and also to do tailgate parties. There have been some gatherings of 
teachers from different schools at people’s houses.  That’s been in the last year 
or two.   
 
00:25:00 
Can you explain ”like a ‘cane”? 
The district superintendent is very charismatic. He wanted a slogan to get the 
community behind the school district. The high school team mascot is the 
Hurricanes and the shortened version is “cane.”  Local businesses purchase 
banners to hang, for instance, “Drink Milk Like a Cane,” if they’re a dairy. From 
the stove works to the dentists to the chiropractors – so we have a visible sign in 
our community to get community support behind the schools.   
 
A second slogan is “Win the Day.”  The staff all wear yellow “Win the Day” shirts 
on Wednesdays.  I’m really happy to have, I don’t have to decide what to wear on 
Wednesdays, and on Friday, our colors are black and gold so Friday is Black and 
Gold Day so I don’t have to think about what to on Fridays. So I’m really happy 
about that. 
 
00:26:40 
Are there other special events during the year that you look forward 
to and enjoy? 
She’s creating one that is coming up next Thursday based on The Phantom 
Tollbooth, which is a really difficult book for her grade level and students.  But 
this year they’ve gotten into it.  Janet first got the kids hooked on the book by 
looking at the Jules Pfeifer illustrations.  So they are going to have a Phantom 
Phun Pheast.  There’s a royal feast in the book. They eat letters and things like 
ragamuffins and rigamaroles.  They’ll have a luncheon based on the royal 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

banquet.  Students have the option of costumes.  She’s also developing some 
fun games that will review what happened in the story: trivia game, character 
guessing game.  They’ll watch an animated version by Chuck Jones that was 
made in the ‘60s too.   
 
00:28:30 
Did I hear you correctly that this is district wide? 
No, this is not district wide. Homecoming is next week; they’ll go out and watch 
the homecoming parade as a class.  Sometimes for Red Ribbon Week and 
sometimes for Homecoming Week, there are special themes for each day.  One 
day is Hat Day.  One day is Team Spirit Day.  They get to wear a team jersey. 
 
00:28:55 
Equipment that you use? A favorite tool or one that you hate? 
I have a mixed reaction to our smart board.  I mean, I’m glad I have it.  I use it a 
lot if I need to pull up an image, if we’re reading about something and the 
students have no idea what we’re reading about. I can pull up images a lot and 
help them with that.  But my smart board is located in the corner of the room so 
for actual instruction, I have to cluster the kids around it.  Sometimes I just have 
mechanical problems with it; it’s just not quite working.   
 
Getting enough computer time is a problem.  They go to a lab and have the 
option of reserving computers at the library also. They can reserve laptops too; 
but even with that, it sometimes is hard to get enough computer time if they’re 
working on a project.  
 
The real bane of my existence is the pencil sharpener in my room. (laughs) I 
can’t get a good point on my pencil. 
 
I’m not very happy with chalk either.  (laughs) Because of my hands. I don’t even 
use chalk for rock climbing because I can’t deal with the feel of chalk on my 
hands.   
 
In the past couple of years. It dries it out too much.  And several teachers won’t 
use it; they’ll write all exclusively on the smart board.    
 
I know this has happened to people of different ages too. Some people have 
found success with the chalk holders. But there is a lot of dust created in the 
classroom by the chalk and by other things.  I’ve brought in air filters from home 
just to get cleaner air in the classroom.  I would like cleaner air in my radiator 
registers too, cleaner filters.   
 
00:31:30 
Can you describe your room? 
It’s about 30’ long by 15’ long with windows on the west, which she loves. 
Because of them, she has great plants including a huge jade plant, which started 
as a tiny jade plant when she first started teaching third grade.  She has lots of 
plants along the windows.  That window wall also has a map, the computer, and 
her desk in the back corner.  She never goes to her desk. They have blue boards 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
 
8 
in the front, not black boards.  She teaches mostly from a science table. The wall 
opposite the windows has cabinet space and a small sink.  She has a divider 
between the neighboring classroom so they can open the accordion folding 
curtain to create a double classroom, though they don’t do it often because it 
doesn’t work very well.  At the moment, her classroom has desks in clusters of 4 
and tables where students can work. The walls are pretty bare.  Janet usually 
has an art piece hanging up.  Right now it’s a banner from a local art exhibit.  
She has one bulletin board for displays and another near her desk for important 
memos and reminders. The room is carpeted.  The carpet was replaced last 
year, which was exciting.  The cabinets are a blueish-green color. And the 
windows open! There are classrooms in this district that don’t have any windows, 
or small windows, or high windows; I think my windows are my favorite part of the 
class. 
 
00:34:15 
Do you have organizational strategies for the students to interact 
with different parts of the room? 
There are cabinets and spaces that they have access to with scratch paper or art 
supplies. They don’t have access to the area around her desk because she 
doesn’t know what will be there and that’s where she stacks things.  If they want 
to read, they can go to another part of the room.  She doesn’t have the space for 
a cozy reading area, which would be nice.   
 
I also organize my students. They do have a number order.  Because I work on a 
tall ship, I’m used to having, doing things where we each have our number.  So 
toda, there was a fire drill so I call out “1” and they line up in number order so we 
know that everybody is there. So their mailboxes in the back are all numbered so 
I can alphabetize the kids’ names quickly. That’s an organizational tool for me is 
that when papers come in, I can quickly alphabetize them so I can quickly see 
who’s missing, whose paper’s missing.  
 
00:35:40 
Tall ships, photography, theater, musher – all passions and 
interests.  Do you bring many of them into the classroom? 
 
00:36:15 
I think my students are pretty aware of what I do, not that I talk 
about myself all the time. (laughs) But when things come up that I can relate to 
experiences I’ve had I share that with them, show them pictures. I’ve traveled a 
lot, too so when I’ve been to a place in our story or can talk about it, I can bring 
personal information.  I can bring photographs. I have a lot of photographs that 
I’ve enlarged and mounted on foam core that I pull out at various times. So I think 
the part of my life away from school is really important for my students.  What I 
do to take care of me really serves my students.  I’m also a very hands-on 
learner; that’s the way I need to be learning. I need to be raising sails on a ship; I 
need to be handling a dog team. So that informs how I want to teach too.   
 
I think with technology, one of the things that frustrates me about teaching, I can 
remember a science CD.  On the CD you could move a magnet with your mouse 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
 
9 
and see what things are magnetic. And I was like, “Well, why don’t you just use a 
magnet?” (laughs)  I mean, a magnet’s way cool. A magnet is like so much 
cooler than moving a mouse on a computer screen. And if we could see the 
Mona Lisa in person, it would be so much better than just seeing the image on 
the computer screen.  So I try to give the give the kids as much sensory 
experiences, and tactile experiences, hands-on experiences is really important to 
me.  
 
00:38:00 
Do you do much project-based learning with your students? 
Some.  We’re encouraged to do more of it.  But it’s challenging because they’re 
lacking basic skills.  There are certain foundation skills that are really good to 
have in place as you do your project-based learning.  It’s kind of like trying to 
build a house if you don’t know how to measure or use a hammer. 
 
00:38:45 
To get things done beyond the ordinary, who do you turn to for 
help, or do you shoulder it yourself? 
She does much of it herself but does have a few friends to lean on.  Last night 
she was on the phone with a nationally honored math teacher from the state of 
Washington who had finished her school day in Pullman, then driven to Spokane 
and was in the airport waiting to catch a shuttle to Seattle for all-day math 
meetings to develop curriculum for statewide math assessment.  So while she 
was in the airport and Janet was at home, they had the opportunity to discuss 
education, vent, strategize, and compare what they’re doing in each state.  Janet 
had met her on a boat so her primary relationship was as a fellow sailor, not as a 
fellow teacher.   
 
00:39:55 
Parents?  Community volunteers?  Business owners?  Do these 
folks help much?  Do you turn to them? 
For certain projects, she has relied a lot on the community.  They have a parent 
committee for the school that has been quite active in recent years and she’s 
turned to them a lot.  There have been some very active parent volunteers, one 
of whom is also a friend. She appreciates having an extra pair of hands to do 
things like run errands, make copies, or pick up something in town when Janet 
can’t leave the building.   
 
00:41:00 
Do you have a phone in your room?  Is that an advantage or 
interruption? 
It’s more of an interruption, in all honesty. And right now the placement of it is by 
my desk. I’m sure that the people who put the phone in have this theory that 
teachers sit at their desks. I haven’t sat in my desk all year yet. (laughs)  It’s in an 
awkward corner of the room and I’m inevitably working with students, in the 
middle of a thought when it rings, and just to get there in time to answer it, so 
yes, it’s a frustration.  
 
00:41:45 
If there were one thing you could change about your job, what 
would it be? 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
 
10 
More control over what I was teaching.  I’m fine with Common Core state 
standards.  I’m fine, like, give me what I need to meet. I can meet them. But let 
me have more freedom in choosing the material that fits my kids.  And let me 
have more freedom in the way I deliver the material.  Because, I think we’re 
being led more to try to do things exactly as the teacher in the next room does.  
And the goal of that is good – so that every kid ends up with the same kind of 
education – but because the teachers are all individuals and because the 
students are all individuals and our teaching styles are all individuals, that doesn’t 
necessarily fit.  It’s like, trying to make, if one family’s Italian and one family’s 
Mexican and one family’s Polish, to have everybody have hamburgers and 
French fries on Monday.  It’s trying to fit us all in a box.  It’s not respecting the 
gifts that we bring to our profession.  And also to take advantage of teachable 
moments -- what’s happening today that I can really make into a valuable 
education experience.   
 
A couple of years ago, I had just done an intensive weekend training with 
Shakespeare and Company. So I had spent the weekend in the Twin Cities 
working on breathing and language. I can remember like hitting the ground on 
Monday and just changing what I was teaching altogether and it was so 
incredibly valuable. I didn’t exactly plan on doing it but it just worked out that way.  
We just explored language through sound and meaning though sound and the 
kids got so excited about what we were doing.  So instead of looking for context 
clues, we started exploring how words felt in our body and when we produced 
the words in our body, could we figure out what they meant by how they felt?  So 
it was just like, the world changed for those kids that day.   
 
The 5th grade was doing plays at that time; we had the freedom to do plays.  
They had “Plays in May” that the 5th grade would do. Other classes did Cinderella 
or material like that.  Janet’s class did Shakespeare - scenes from Macbeth and 
Twelfth Night and Midsummer’s Night Dream. The Midsummer Night’s Dream 
production was among the best that she’s seen on any stage, and she has seen 
a lot of productions. The mechanicals were hysterical; they were just incredible.  
It was so thrilling to see that happen. And the kids just handling the language and 
getting into the language.  And getting into the humor. It was just amazing.  So 
it’s like all this passion happening.  But now we can’t do that anymore. 
 
45:40 Do you find passion happening now? 
We’re trying to get there but some of the literature is just too daunting.  Even 
stories that you’d think would be fine for 5th graders, when you have poor 
readers, you know… 
 
We did “Little House on the Prairie,” which I grew up with, and I read all those 
books growing up. I like those books.  And I hate to knock those books.  But boy, 
when you have slow readers reading a chapter on how to build a door, it was 
sooo painful.  Then, in my class, that was almost half Native American, to have 
lines like, “There’s no good Indian unless it’s a dead Indian”?  And the kids not

responding to that, not reacting, with nobody making a (gasp-air intake), nobody 
responding that that was not politically correct? That was scary to me too.  It was 
not connecting. 
 
And Ma said that!  (laughs) Can you believe that Ma said that?! 
 
We also read, some of the students last year read Red Badge of Courage, which 
is 8th grade reading level but thought level; I don’t think it was written for 10-year-
olds.  Kids had so much trouble relating.  And it was just tough.  And you hate it 
when reading is bad, or reading is painful.  In my unit we did Bud, Not Buddy, 
which I love so I could get passion about that one again. 
 
00:47:40 
What advice would you give to a new teacher or someone 
considering entering the profession? 
I think probably the same talk my parents gave to me, and figuring out that if they 
really needed to do it, they wouldn’t listen to me and that would be OK.  But, 
really talk about pros and cons, explain the reality of income.  As a single person, 
I struggle making ends meet. That’s an issue. And awareness of the politics 
because I think when you’re an education student, your vision is that you’re the 
one in charge, that it’s all about teaching young people. You don’t realize that 
you have to bear the weight of school boards and nationwide initiatives and tax 
payers and community perceptions. You just don’t understand.  You just think 
your classroom is your own little world and you can make a difference. 
 
00:48:55 
Have you felt that you have made a difference? 
There are former students who are now successful adults that she had special 
times with when they were younger.  One student had macular degeneration and 
even as a first grader had bottle cap glasses and technically was albino and even 
at kindergarten level was explaining to everyone that things were made of 
molecules and atoms.  They had quality projects together when he was a first 
grader, developing, designing and creating things.  And now he’s in college but I 
think he made $40,000 this year doing software apps.  I see successful adults.  
And I see kids coming back to me who are graduating who I was their teacher in 
3rd grade being, wanting me at their graduation party, coming back to thank me. 
So that’s good. But you know there’re some that you can’t quite reach and that 
hurts.  And you try. There were some that you know you were particularly tough 
on and hopefully that will help them down the line but you don’t see the 
immediate results.  You hope you’ve had a positive influence on them and that 
that will help shape them but you don’t know yet. 
 
00:50:50 
How does the high number of Native American students affect the 
school or your teaching? 
It can be tough because there’s some stereotyping that’s being done by parents 
and by other kids sometimes.  It’s something we need to be mindful of all the 
time.  But the school does offer things like Ojibwe language classes.  Janet has 
been influenced by the culture and values that as something important. I really 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

respect the culture and take part in activities on the reservation, like the powwow 
and things like that.  Don’t kayak in Lake Superior unless I have tobacco.  So I 
embrace that part of the culture. 
 
But there is sometimes an us-and-them feel.  I’ve had some parents who have 
been….mmm, like well, a parent last year – I think I can say this –was very 
concerned that his son would have to go to a powwow.  This was at a parent-
teacher conference in October and the powwow wasn’t until May.  I said, “If you 
don’t want your son to go, that’s fine. Just write a note.”  And he was like, “I don’t 
want that religion being shoved down my kid’s throat!”  I was feeling like I was 
being attacked!  I’m just the ____ here. The tension is below the surface, I guess 
I’d say. 
 
Sometimes kids don’t understand, the kids who are Native American and blonde, 
if they’re pulled out for some special activity, there’ll be a, “Well, you’re not 
Indian!”  So there’s that kind of, “Well, what ethnic group are we from?   
 
00:53:40 
What is your vision for the field? What will your job be like in 20 
years? Where will that pendulum have moved? 
The doomsayers among the staff feel that more instruction will be through 
electronic means; there’ll be less of a need for live teachers and live interaction 
and it will be more classes led by one teacher with three schools someplace with 
everybody on a monitor. That’s one thought of where it’s going.   
 
I personally think it needs to go the other way.  Not to dismiss technology, but 
what kids today are losing is the ability to work with other students, the 
interpersonal skills.  So I hope it goes into more collaborative working together.  
But again, I’m hands on too so I would like to see it working toward more 
exploration, like the Northern Waters Environmental School where they’re 
outside doing things once or twice a week.  They have projects outside.  They’re 
out in the environment.  I don’t know.  It’s, it’s, you know, you try to maintain a 
positive image of what you would like to have happen and rely on those models 
of positive teaching that you see, or positive learning experiences that you see.   
 
00:55:25 
Is that what keeps you in the profession? 
Yeah, I think so.  And for me, it’s like the teaching all the time.  I mean, when I’m 
working on tall ships, I work on an educational vessel.  So often times I’m 
working with students, high school students on the vessel.  So I’m still in my 
teacher mode only but it’s 24-7 and we’re on watch 24-7. It’s every life skill that 
you’re working on.  So I guess that’s what keeps me in it.   
 
00:56:10 
Is there anything that we haven’t talked about or something you 
want to be said? 
 
Just that I wish anybody listening to this would really pay attention to the 
teachers, just give them respect that they deserve.  I feel like Arthur Miller and 
Death of a Salesman: “Attention must be paid!”  (laughs)   It’s because, because 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

I think in general teachers don’t get the respect they deserve.  You don’t see, I 
think the teachers working effectively you don’t see all that’s going into that, all 
the knowledge, all the care, all the concern. So, I think that’s what feels pressing 
at this point. 
00:56:50 
What would be different if teachers got this deserved respect? 
I think that the more we can cut down on the stress of teachers, the more open 
they would be to finding different ways to help kids, different ways to challenge 
kids.  I think the scope of what could be taught could be improved.  I just kind of 
want to open up the world for kids and right now it feels like it’s closing in on 
them. That’s what it feels like in the classroom right now sometimes.   
00:57:33 
Stress.  Can you identify a primary source of the stress that 
teachers feel?  What makes the job stressful? 
I think because you want to do the best for every kid but it’s like a lot of kids to 
take care of and a lot of kids with special needs to take care of, I mean individual 
needs to take care of.  So, first of all, it’s a lot. Your attention is being spread in a 
lot of directions; that’s one of them.  Expectations of community, parents, 
administration.  Also, for us in the state right now, our job security’s been taken 
away, our union power has been taken away.  So it’s not that it, it used to be kind 
of a safety net so if there was a concern with an administrator, or there was 
something, you had your union to back you up.  I’ve been teaching about, over 
15 years now. In terms of pay rates, it looks like I’ve been teaching 6.  My income 
does not go up yearly.  In the past, my income used to be able to go up every 
time I got 8 credits my income would go up; that doesn’t count any more.  So our 
pay levels, our pay rates, our rate of pay gets frozen.  So there’s no incentive to 
take more classes, to do better.   
That being said, I do want to say I don’t believe in merit pay.  I’m a firm believer 
in not doing that because it takes every staff member to contribute to each child 
and the person making the difference for the child might be the lunchroom lady. 
There are so many factors affecting a child; it could be other kids in class.  It 
could be things going on at home.  It could be hormonal levels.  There are so 
many things affecting a student that there is no fair way to measure merit pay.  It 
will just turn people against each other, I think.  I’m not going to share this great 
idea I had with another teacher down the hall if I think the other teacher is more 
charismatic and will get more pay than I will.  So I don’t believe in that.  But I do 
believe in job security and honoring people for the work they’ve put in and the 
years of service and the education they’ve trained at. 
01:00:35 
Is union membership optional or mandatory? 
It’s optional.  
01:00:40 
Did you remain a member? 
Yes, and she’s also an AFTRA-SAG member.  My parents were union members. 
My father became an assistant principal and he did give up his union

membership at one point, but I grew up, I’d been on picket lines as a kid when 
my parents were striking so it’s something I did grow up with and think the value 
of the union was important.   
 
01:1:10 
Are you an active union member, attending meetings? 
She tries to but scheduling and communication is really difficult.  
 
01:1:55 
Is there a particular piece of jargon that tickles you? 
The one that pushes my button is “research has shown…”  It’s like the research 
word is used to manipulate whatever perspective you have, so that one gets to 
me.   
 
She can hear administrators trying to pass the buck.  They sound like politicians, 
especially one in particular. But she can’t fault them too much as it’s part of their 
job.  It’s like, “Because you’re valued professionals, we want you to take the lead 
on this project.” (laughs) That kind of thing.   
 
I don’t like all the initials.  That’s not what education’s about.
