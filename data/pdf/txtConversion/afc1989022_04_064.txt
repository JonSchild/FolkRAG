Gus' Place: Elm and Mesa in Bessemer. I pull 
up around 12:30 p.m. Polkas on the sound system. Cubs-Cards on TV. 
Everything is red: bar, bar stools, booths, chairs, tables, floor 
(red and white checkerboard), ceiling (ditto). 
Photos and other 
memorabilia outnumber Bud signs by a wide margin. 
The regulars seems to be at each end of the bar. I recognize 
one guy from the story about the place in last month's (May 21, 
1990) Rocky Mountain News. The story mentions that Gus' is in both 
National Geographic (part of a story called "Colorado Dreamin'") 
and the Guinness Book of Records for selling more beer for the 
floor space in 1937, 1939 and 1941. I sit toward the middle of the 
bar, order a small beer -- most folks are having twofers -- and 
split my attention between the ballgame and the decor. 
Freddy Masciotra, the owner, the late Gus' son, doesn't appear 
to be there. 
But on the wall is a photo of Little Vera, 
the 
waitress, and she's there so while watching the game and nursing 
my beer and watching perpetual motion Vera take her little steps 
from booths to kitchen to bar,I debate whether to reveal my 
identity and purpose to her, the bartender or the guys at the far 
end of the bar, a couple of whom look Italian to me. 
When a guy gets up from the end of the bar, that settles it. 
I don't get the white haired gent's name whose closest to me, but 
he is Italian, a barber, in fact, and his dead dad worked at CF&I 
(the steel mill, in other words) for 50 years. He, the son, doesn't 
know much about it, 
he says, and recommends I come back in the 
morning to talk to Freddy, though if I want to get the history of 
the place, he says, all I have to do is read the walls. Gus' is a 
neighborhood tradition, 
he tells me, 
the place the millworkers 
stopped for a beer on the way home from work. The delivery truck 
used to deposit most of its kegs on the sidewalk and bring whatever 
was left over to the distributor. There's a 1936 picture of the 
kegs (of Tivoli Beer) on the wall. The barber's dad and Gus came 
from the same town in Italy. Freddy'll tell me all about it. Uncle 
Mike, Gus' brother is still kicking at 94 and lives just down the 
street, but he speaks "broken English." No prob, I think to myself. 
We have Tavarelli and Manini. Freddy'll be there from 10 to 12:30. 
Nice hours. That's when I'll get the name of the town. Among other 
things, presumably.

The bartender, 
it turns out, 
is Freddy's son Barry. 
So I 
introduce myself to him, which gets me a free beer, and to Vera, 
from whom I order lunch. The other name for Gus' 
Place is Gus' 
Dutch Lunch, which turns out to be a plate stacked with bread, 
salami, ham, provolone, pepperoncini, sliced onion and tomato and 
a small paper cup of mayonnaise. Mustard is also brought. This is 
all they serve. One can get a large plate for $7, a small plate for 
$5.50 or a pre-made sandwich of all those same ingredients for 
$2.75. I get the sandwich, but I won't have to pay for that either. 
While eating my sandwich, I read the walls, as per the white-
haired gent's instructions. On the bar side there's: 
a "Bojon 
lottery ticket -- a dollar a year for a million years. Control 
series E-I-E-I-O-U. 
Lottery Number 1-4-U-2-4-ME"; 
a Las Vegas 
poster showing the marquee of Don Arden's Jubilee, which was then 
showing "the show of the decade" in the Celebrity Room, starring 
-- Fred Masciotra; photos of Gus' watchdogs, of St. Mary's School 
Days, 
1934 and St. Mary's Graduation, 1940; a list of names and 
bars with the legend "God Bless the Bar Owners Who Passed Away." 
And over the back bar itself: 
a large photo portrait of Gus 
himself, hoisting a double beer in his left hand and a bottle of 
Old Quaker in his right; and an oil painting of a Dutch Lunch. A 
quintet of middle-aged ladies at a table in the back pose for 
pictures with hoisted double beers just as Gus did for his picture. 
One of them surprises me by climbing onto a booth to examine the 
St. 
Mary's Graduation picture and announcing to her 
friends, 
"There's my husband." 
Barry stop to chat whenever he serves my end of the bar. Uncle 
Mike, he tells me, comes in every evening at 6:30 and every morning 
at 10:30 for a beer and a shot of Fernet Branca, which Tavarelli 
says is an "amaro" -- bitter liqueur. He speaks, you guessed it, 
"broken English." Interviewing him in Italian, he allows, may not 
be a bad idea. Poor Mike got hit by a car a couple of years ago and 
had both his hips broken, but he still walks a couple of miles a 
day. As for the pronunciation of the family name, Barry says the 
Italian people say, "Mashorta," and everyone else says, "Masiorta." 
"What do you say?" I ask him. He says, "Masiorta." The name Dutch 
Lunch means make-your-own, just as Dutch Treat means pay for your 
own. Gus' used to be a grocery store, liquor store and deli, as 
well as a bar. A 1928 photo on the wall opposite the bar shows 
Agostino Masciorta's grocery store. Also on that wall is a Gus' 
Deli hacksaw, 1925-1979. Whatever that means. 
The rest of the inventory of the opposite wall -- all the 
photos and objects are mounted on wood paneling with black, block 
letter captions: 
the National Geographic cover, blown up; 
two 
views of the CF&I blast furnaces; portrait of the Occhiato family, 
founders of the Pueblo Pepsi Cola Bottling Co.; a bronze plaque 
that says, "Gus' Place. The Bessemer Country Club. Members Only"; 
some old and quite small beer bottles; an old Elm St. sign; pix of 
3

battleships and moonshots; a Gus' 
Place sign on Peruvian tile, 
given by Ted and Nancy Aguilera; a sign for the Frozen Dainties 
sold by the Pueblo Dainty Co. -- 2 cents each; and an assortment 
of photos of Gus or the Masciorta family or the building facade 
taken between 1911 and 1985. 
Bottom of the ninth. 
The Cubs are 1-33 
in games they've 
trailed after 8 innings. Make that 1-34. Cards win, 8-7. Southward 
on Elm toward Northern. The houses and lots are small. At the south 
end of the block, the mill hoves into view. That the day itself is 
pulsating with blast furnace heat discourages further exploration. 
I circle the block, note the American, Italian and one other flag 
with red, black and green horizontal bars flying on Gus' Mesa St. 
frontage, get another look at the front of the building with its 
red, white and green awning, and retreat to the air-conditioned 
comfort of my car. Back tomorrow to meet Freddy and Uncle Mike.

Gus' Place, Sunday morning, just after opening 
time, around 10:30. Some of the regulars (I saw them yesterday) are 
at the bar; the booths and tables are empty. Owner Freddy Masciorta 
is there, as promised. Uncle Mike is not. We sit in a back booth, 
and after I tell him what I'm after we arrange for me to take 
photos of him and Vera getting ready for the day on Wednesday 
morning, around 8:30. That's when they do all their slicing of ham, 
salami, tomato, onion and provolone for the day's Dutch lunches. 
That's when I'll interview him also. 
In the meantime, he refers me to the Dagnillos, a ranching 
family who live on 21st Lane out past the drive-in movie theatre 
on the Mesa. Lucy Dagnillo is in her 80s. She used to make the 
meatballs for all the church festivals. Her son, John, runs the 
ranch. Freddy tells me they used to get their peppers from the 
Dagnillos and put them up themselves -- that they did that for 60 
years with no one ever getting sick, but now the health department 
won't let them do it anymore. Son Barry, he says, has "other food 
ideas" -- in other words, he liked to have a menu -- but Freddy 
says "you can't change it; that's what it's known for." Besides, 
with Dutch lunches, there's very little waste. 
As for mill retirees, Freddy says, "They don't last too long 
after they retire. If they don't come around it usually means they 
can't come around." other possibilities are Rose Gagliano Cortese, 
who runs the little Bessemer grocery store just down the street, 
and Angelina Biondi, a retired school teacher. Freddy also tells 
me that the third flag I was wondering about yesterday with the 
red, black and green bars is a Juneteenth flag. 
He confirms that 
the fellow I saw watering his garden yesterday was he; he lives in 
the house next-door. 
In the old days, 
he tells me, 
when the 
neighborhood was all Italian, people used to leave their doors 
open. A few months ago, he got mugged. The Italians, the Bojons -
- a term he 
uses 
interchangeably with Austrians 
-- 
and 
the 
Slovakians or Leechons kept apart. Later, they intermarried. The 
Masciortas came from Agnone, a farming town near Naples. 
At my behest, Freddy calls Domenick Bucciarelli over to our 
booth. His family is northern Italian. His dad came over in 1912. 
"What brought people to Pueblo," he says, "was the smelters, the 
steelworks and the mine." Domenick himself, born in 1916, worked 
in the army weapons depot most of his working life. He was born and 
raised in Salt Creek and a widower, he still lives there with his 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
• 
two bachelor brothers. We arrange for me to visit tomorrow morning 
(Monday) 
to do an interview. 
While we're talking, 
Uncle Mike 
arrives with his two sons from Argentina and California. They sit 
three abreast at one of the long tables and drink double beers. 
Carlo Passanante, known to all as Slewfoot, dances with Sandy, 
Vera Is daughter, on the way to the head. The same polka tape as was 
playing yesterday is playing today. This time it's car-racing on 
the television. Slewfoot is quite famous, at least in Gus' Place, 
for his dancing. It's where he got his nickname. When he emerges 
I have "Butch," as a guy named Bucciarelli would logically be 
called, summon him to our table. Slew, as he's most often called, 
worked in the mill for 50 years and his father worked there before 
and then alongside him, but says he's tired of being interviewed. 
"I'm not a good talker. I'm a good dancer." 
Moments later, Slew 
seems to feel guilty about brushing me off, for he returns to the 
booth, sits down and orders me a beer, and moments later, a shot 
of whiskey. At 11:30 a.m., mind you. The booths and tables are 
beginning to fill. "What do you want to know?" Slew asks me. What 
he did in the mill, for one thing. He tells me he was a millwright 
for 20 years, a foreman for three years and then, finding middle 
management not to his liking, he went back to millwright until his 
retirement in 1977. He's 74. He lives alone in a mobile four blocks 
away and spends the late morning at Gus', 
the early afternoon 
watching TV and the later afternoon and evening back at Gus'. So 
far this morning, he confides, he's had 14 beers. I believe him. 
The neighborhood, he tells me, used to be called Little Italy, 
when it was all Italians. Pueblans, who call their town Pee-eblo, 
say Eye-talians. I ask him if anybody plays bocce anymore. He says 
they used to play right out here on Elm before it was paved, but 
not anymore. I ask him about the old country. He says his family's 
from Sicily, where he thinks they had an olive ranch. His dad came 
in 1903 and opened a grocery store on the 700 block of Elm, just 
up the street. I can feel him losing interest in this line of 
questioning. Sure enough, he goes back to his stool, which had been 
the only unoccupied one. 
Bucciarelli asks me for several more 
Italian Americans in the West brochures. 
I see that my friend 
from the day before, the barber, has arrived. 
There's a lull. I set down a few lines of a 1965 Denver Post 
column about Gus' Place: "Gus' is not a cocktail lounge, nor a go-
go club, nor anything but what it is and what it ought to be: a 
saloon where you can quaff a hefty schooner of beer, dip into a 
Dutch lunch, talk it up, or just let the rest of the world go by 
for an hour or two. 
No murky lights, 
no phony atmosphere, 
no 
scantily clad waitresses, no piano bar. Just a nice, old-fashioned 
saloon, with red linoleum on the table tops (and] straight-backed 
wooden booths for the ladies... 
"The heartbeat of the town is the steel mill, and it is the 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
men who work in the mill who keep Gus' going. When the whistle 
blows to end a shift, many of them head first for Gus' and then 
home. They troop in, wearing working clothes and carrying battered 
lunch buckets, and they're not ashamed of the dirt under their 
fingernails. They sit around and have a beer and talk, while the 
jukebox grinds out a polka or one of the old songs; 
somehow 
rock'n'roll would seem sacrilegious in Gus'. 
"If anything is changing about Gus' it is the average age of 
the customers. They are older now, and many of them have sons who 
have gone to college, and off to work and live in other towns..." 
Slew keeps motioning to me from his bar stool perch to have 
another brew and/or another shot; I decline. I go out to my car to 
get a camera and bump into my colleagues, 
Tavarelli, 
Taylor, 
Williams and Manini, who are arriving from church. When we come in 
together, I see that Slew has ordered me another beer anyway. We 
sit at the long table in the back and order a large Dutch lunch 
plate and a small, a round of beers for the newcomers, and later 
a round of Fernet, to find out what Uncle Mike sees in the stuff. 
Freddy picks up the tab. When the rest of the team makes for the 
door, I figure to leave with them, but Bucciarelli summons me back 
to the bar to introduce me to the barber, whose name is Dominic 
Liberato, and to request still more IAW brochures. I go out to the 
car to get them and when I come back he's feeling more talkative 
than he was before. He begins taking me on a sitting tour of the 
memorabilia on the wall. The hacksaw on the deli sign, he explains, 
was used to cut the meat. The battleship U.S.S. New Mexico was 
Freddy' s ship during World War II. The 2-cent dainties were ice 
cream bars. 
The model rockets have to do with the McDonnell-
Douglas plant here in Pueblo. The Burmese elephant tusk was brought 
back by Freddy's friend Red. 
Then he begins to tell me about bootlegging days, when the 
neighborhood was not only called Little Italy, 
but also Little 
Chicago. On Thanksgiving in 1928, he says, 98 people were arrested 
for bootlegging. He says he'll tell me a lot of stories about 
bootlegging days tomorrow, when I interview him. He concludes by 
saying, "The economy has gone to hell in this town... The mill went 
to hell." We both leave.

This wasn't supposed to be another visit to 
Gus' Place. The plan was to interview Domenick Bucciarelli at home, 
where he lives with his two brothers. But when I found the place, 
after some searching -- it's a sturdy-looking brick house, out of 
place amid the under-the-freeway squalor of a junkyard -- I had 
just missed him, brother Frank informed me. He'd gone to the bank. 
And from there, I asked, to Gus,' no? That's what Frank figured. 
So I drove over to Gus.' It was just after 10, opening time, 
and I didn't see Butch's pickup, so I strolled over to Bessemer 
Mercantile and chatted with Joe Carese for a while, while taking 
note of his scanty, though strongly Italian inventory: the deli 
counter, which featured a butcher block and hacksaw, a la the 
hacksaw on the wall at Gus' Place and such meats and cheeses as 
capocola, 
hard 
salami, 
Genoa, 
dilusso 
(deluxe?), 
mortadella, 
ricotta, 
open eye, 
mozzarella, 
provolone, 
goat cheese, 
romano, 
pepperoni and Italian sausage; pizzelle and pasta machines; cannoli 
shells; plastic bags of polenta and ceci; jars of black Moroccan 
and green California olives, of lupini beans and fave verde (green 
broad beans), of roasted peppers, and of corks and lids for putting 
up peppers, etc. It's a cute little store -- wooden shelves, black 
and white linoleum tile ont he floor. 
Joe Carese, 
whose late 
father-in-law, Joe Gagliano, started the business, makes sausage 
every couple days. We can watch, maybe, come Thursday. Next door 
is Rosa Importing Co., 
Rosa being Rose Carese, 
Joe's wife and 
Gagliano Is daughter. Old Mrs. Gagliano, going on 95 is still sharp, 
according to Carese, but sharper in Italian than English. 
Bucciarelli or no Bucciarelli, I decide to make the plunge 
into Gus' and am surprised to find him at the bar with his little 
pony Buds arranged around him. Surprised because today he's driving 
a sedan whereas I expected yesterday's pickup. 
He has further 
errands this morning, postpones and relocates our interview until 
Wednesday, here at Gus.' Nevertheless, Butch has lots to say, as 
does Sandy Holman and, 
a little later, 
Little Vera, 
her mom. 
Domenick begins by telling me about his father store and saloon 
there on Salt Creek , and how the Italian farmers from St. Charles 
Mesa would drive their horse-drawn wagons there, unload, tie up 
their teams, order a can of sardines and a loaf of bread and play 
cards until dark. They would then be drunk, but the horses would 
know the way.

Next he runs through all the little Italian grocery stores 
that used to be in Bessemer. There was also the Foscino (sp.?) 
Macaroni Factory, which burned to the ground the night of the great 
flood in 1927. There were five smelters in those days "where all 
the Italian people worked. The mil. The rest were farmers." His 
brother-in-law worked at the mill for 48 years. "He worked like a 
goddamn horse, on the run all the time." 
Next he takes me over to the sign that says "God Bless the 
Saloon Owners" and reads off all the Italian names, including his 
father's. He owned the Venetian Garden. The bar owners, Domenick 
figures, were 70 percent Italian. Gus has the first liquor license 
in the city, his father, Domenico, had the first one in the county. 
Sandy joins the conversation. "I'm an Elm St. baby," she says. 
"She was born on Elm St.," says Domenick. "Her mother was born on 
Elm St." Sandy: 
"Everyone worked at the CF&I who lived on that 
street. They all walked to work and they all walked back." She 
calls the neighborhood "WOP Village." Since her dad's a Bojon, 
she's a Bo-wop. "The whole street's nothing but history." 
The juke box is playing this morning; the polka and Frankie 
Sinatra tapes are being given a rest. Quiz show on the TV. Three 
guys, counting Domenick, at the bar. Next to me is a little guy 
named Casey who's smoking the biggest cigar I've ever seen. Enter 
Vera, her two little granddaughters and one big granddaughter in 
tow. Vera tells how her dad was run over by the train on the way 
home from the hill: December 13, 1927. She has a shot of Fernet, 
calls Bucciarelli, 
"Butchie." Then she tells about climbing a 
telephone pole when she was a kid to get the cat down. "Come down, 
capra (nanny goat)," her mother called, but since her mother was 
waiting for her with a strap, she did not come down and the fire 
department had to be called. "Everyone on my block wanted to marry 
me when they came back from the war," Vera claims. "My dad kissed 
her," Sandy continues, "and my grandmother brought out the shotgun 
and said, 
'You will marry her now.'" Vera: 
"That was the old 
Italian tradition." Butch: 
"You had to take her parents to meet 
your parents. That was the Italian tradition." Sandy: 
"I had an 
Italian wedding. It lasted 24 hours." 
11 a.m. Uncle Mike arrives. "How you, BucciarellI, he says as 
he makes his way back to his table. Sandy: "We set our clocks by 
Uncle Mike. 11 o'clock and 7 o'clock. Glass of beer and shot of 
Fernet." 
More talk about the neighborhood. Bucciarelli: "From Northern 
Ave. 
to the freeway was all 
Italian, 
house after house after 
house." 
The farms started at 23rd Lane. Beans, corn, peas, chilis, 
bell peppers. And "all these people on Elm and Box Elder had their 
little gardens." Sandy: "Everyone I know worked out at the mill." 
There 
are three 
Italians 
on 
the city council: 
John Califano 
or 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
--we 
(Sandy's uncle), Sammy Corsentino and Mike Occhiato. "They're all 
short," Sandy says. "They all have booster chairs. They gave 'em 
booster chairs so they can oversee things." 
Naming traditions: Bucciarelli's father was Domenico "and I'm 
Domenick and my son is Domenick and I have a grandson Domenick." 
His great-grandfather, however, was named Giuseppe. Sandy: "You've 
got to have one Giuseppe in the family." 
Back to Vera and her telephone climbing. She used to climb up 
and throw rocks at passing cars, according to Sandy. "She was mean. 
In school she would go in the front door and out the back door." 
11:15. Enter Dominic the barber. He takes his usual position 
at the far end of the bar. Bucciarelli tells him that he's been 
telling me about the "WOP grocery stores." "Everything's gone," 
Dom the barber says. 
"Everything's gone," Butch agrees. Another 
bartender, Jody, comes in. 
She calls Butch "Primo." Butch calls 
Freddy, the owner, "Primo." It means cousin, Butch explains. Casey, 
the little big-cigar guy, 
runs around the room scaring Sandy's 
girls. "Slewfoot should be coming," Butch says, and no sooner is 
it said than Slewfoot -- Carlo Passanante -- makes his entrance: 
"Talk about the devil." Tomorrow, Vera promises, she'll bring in 
a copy of Sandy's written history of the family, along with photos. 
Sandy leaves at 11:25, punching the backs of all the regulars as 
she goes. The juke is off. "Volare" is on the tape deck. Casey's 
about to light another cigar. This would be a good time to leave, 
and Bucciarelli says he has to leave, but then he starts telling 
me about the Italian taverns with upstairs whorehouses that used 
to be on Union St., and about how the bootleggers were Sicilian, 
mostly. Then we leave. Uncle Mike, also. Since getting run over and 
breaking his hips, he walks with a slow, skipping step. I decide 
to wait to see which house is his. It's a long wait.

TIAW-RF-F062590.B= [The person who answers] the phone at the United 
Steelworkers Union local tells me the retirees play cards in the 
basement of the hall at 1414 E. Evans. Italians are among them. 
Forgetting the sign that says "No Foreign Cars in this Lot," I 
enter the parking lot, see the sign, quickly withdraw and park on 
the street. 
In the basement of the boxy brick building, in the rec room, 
where most of the chairs are folded up and unfolded, I gather, only 
on Bingo night, are two tables full of card players and a lone pool 
player. They look up as I enter, but say nothing. I wait a couple 
of hands, then break into the game. Before you deal, I say, I'd 
like a word. And feeling like I haven't much time -- the dealing 
has already begun -- I simply ask if any of the card players 
present are Italian. Several are and when I explain why I'm asking, 
they steer me to Tony, the lone pool player. This seems like a good 
idea, because he's more interruptable than the card players. Also, 
I like the little wide-banded straw fedora he has set far back on 
his head like a hat Frankie Sinatra wore in his 50s flicks and the 
jaunty toothpick in his mouth. 
But Tony is less than receptive. First he thinks I'm trying 
to sell him a book. Then, when he understands that a book is to be 
written, he says all the information is already in the library. 
When I say I'm interested in his own personal and family history 
he tells me it's all the same all over, all the same, and several 
more variations on the sameness of it all, shooting pool all the 
while, 
and I begin to get annoyed about his attitude until I 
remember how it's not exactly everyday that a guy likes me walks 
into the rec room of the United Steelworkers Union hall and makes 
the kind of proposal I just have made. So a Hispanic guy named 
Vince, who recognizes me from Gus' Place the other day, and Tony 
play pool and I watch, until a guy named Warren Valentine comes in 
who is curious about me, so I deliver the whole spiel to him, find 
him receptive, 
and adjourn to the kitchen next door, 
where he 
promises to get a couple of his buddies together and regales me 
with some Italian jokes, 
some strong pro-Union, anti-Republican 
statements, and an account of his recent cruise through Alaskan 
waters. 
"Steeltown is ethnic," he tells me, "all over the country." 
And he tells me about the friction between these various ethnic 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / k
l a' 
groups, and illustrates his point with a joke: 
This Italian and this Hungarian or a Slav are on a boat coming 
to America. 
Their fare was way at the bottom of the boat. 
At 
dinnertime they looked at the menu, it was mostly meat and potatoes 
They didn't have much money and the Italian says, "Why don't we buy 
one dinner?" When dinner came it was a lot of potatoes and one 
little piece of meat. The Italian says, 
"Do you want to have a 
contest?" The Slav says, "Yah. What are we going to do?" "We will 
hold that one piece of meat between our teeth, face to face, nose 
to nose, with our teeth sunk into the meat. When I count three we 
go to chewing." They got ready. They both had their teeth in the 
meat. The Italian says, "Are you ready?" The Slav says, "Yah," and 
he lost the meat. The Italian got half the potatoes and all the

A joke about Columbus, that "conniving Dago": 
Columbus went everywhere to get a sponsor, see. He finally, 
see, 
Queen Isabel -- what the hell was her husband's name? --
Ferdinand -- Ferdinand was against it. She was for it. He says, 
"Queenie, you give me ships and cargo and six months time I'll 
bring you back Chicago." 
And a speaking-English-as-a-second-language joke: 
This Italian -- we'll name him -- most Italians are Tony, Sam 
-- let's call this one Dominic. He was a peddlar by wagon and 
horse. He had an ex-race horse that was old and not running anymore 
pulling his wagon. This fella says to Dominic, says, "I like your 
horse. It's a good-looking horse. Would you sell him?" "You think-
a my horse look-a good?" "Yeah, I'll buy him." Tony says, "Okay, 
you think he look good, 
I sell him." A couple days later he 
receives 
a 
summons 
to 
appear 
in 
court. 
Charged 
with 
misrepresentation. 
When 
he 
got 
into 
court 
the 
judge 
asked, 
"Dominic, you know why you're here?" "No, judge." "You're charged 
with selling -- misrepresenting this horse that you sold." Dominic 
says, "I don't understand. No capisce." "It means you sold this man 
a blind horse." "I tell this man the horse no look so good." 
And finally, another English-as-a-second-language joke: 
Tony, the Italian, was getting his citizenship papers. The 
judge asked, 
"Where do you live, Upper U.S. or Lower U.S.?" The 
Italian says, "Upper U.S., judge." 
Valentine is half-Italian: his father is a French-Canadian 
from Sault Saint Marie. His mother's a Desiato. He, 
77, 
looks a 
little like Bob Hope. He married a Slovenian, and goes on to tell 
me about Pueblo's ethnic neighborhoods: the Mexicans in Salt Creek, 
the Hungarians "across the bridge," the Leechons, the Slovaks --
and about the old animosity between these various groups. 
At

dances, 
he says, 
"you had to ask the old lady" 
-- the girl's 
mother, for permission to dance with her. 
Then he starts talking about the union, and how most of the 
retirees here at the hall lived through five strikes, shutdowns or 
layoffs. 
And when 
he 
talks 
about 
technological 
advances, 
he 
comments, 
"Somebody still has to dig the ditch." And on about 
Republicans (boo!) and Democrats (hurrah!). 
Tony, the reluctant pool player comes and gets us a couple of 
cups of beer, and sticks around to hear about Valentine's vacation. 
All this beer. It occurs to me that if San Pedro and Gilroy were 
wine cultures, this is a beer culture. Val and I leave together. 
He sees my car and says, "What are you driving, a Volkswagen?" "A 
rental," I say.

After three days, I should know better: you 
don't just stop by Gus' Place. You get sucked in. A honky-tonk 
piano tape today, cooking show in the telly. I'm there to pick up 
some photos and written family history from Vera Califano. The 
photos turn out to be a color snap of the color blowup of her that 
hangs on the wall here at Gus'; and a nice photo of Uncle Mike with 
his beer and his Fernet. The family history, as written by daughter 
Sandy Holman, is here reproduced entire: 
Carmen Califano -- Born in 1891 in Salerno, Italy. In Italy 
he was a stone mason and came to the U.S. at age 21. He married 
Barbara D'Allesandro in Italy. 
He lived at 826 Elm St. and worked for the C&W Railroad. He 
had six brothers (one nephew of Carmen was Joseph Califano Jr., 
who was HEW chairman in Washington.) Carmen was a member of the 
Christopher 
Columbus 
Society, 
Sons 
of 
Italy 
and 
the 
Fedetta 
Italiano Victor Emanuel. 
On Dec. 
13, 
1927 he was on his way home and according to a 
report he saw two trains nearing one another and to save time he 
jumped between them in an effort to cross the tracks before the 
cars meet. He misjudged the distance and was crushed between the 
two trains. He was buried on Sat. Dec. 17 at Roselawn Cemetery. 
Barbara D'Alessandro Califano -- Barbara was born on April 
10, 1894 in Naples, Italy. She was a member of the Saint Theresa 
Society of Vineland and the Third Order of St. 
Francis, Sacred 
Heart Congregation and Mt. Carmel Church. She died on Dec. 13, 1948 
during surgery. 
Also included in the folder were photocopies of photos of Vera 
and her brothers and sisters, of a map of Italy with arrows showing 
Barbara's birthplace to be Naples and Carmen's to be Salerno, and 
of a Pueblo Chieftain story about Vera's 5-foot, 2-inch brother 
John Califano taking his seat on the city council and being 
presented with a booster cushion. 
I chat with Uncle Mike haltingly -- we have a hard time 
understanding each other -- but he tells me about his two-mile 
morning walks, and how he doesn't do much otherwise, except come 
to Gus' 
for his morning and evening beer-and-Fernet. 
He quit

Domenick Bucciarelli comes in bearing two photos of his dad, 
circa 1935, feeding stale beer to a sheep named Jack. I immediately 
appropriate them for copying. Next I take some photos of Freddy 
tending bar and while I'm back there, I'm directed to a table where 
sit retired steelworkers Mrs. Bruno Biggi and Russell DiSalvo, who 
are waiting with a birthday cake for the Biggi's 11-year-old

Double 
interview with Joe Genova 
and 
Paul 
Palermo at Joe Genova's house. The Genova's is a one-story brick 
house, nothing overtly "Italian" about its interior decor. The most 
salient feature of the living room-dining room area is all the 
family photos. We begin with Joe's family background. The family 
name was Genoa; his father was Giuseppe. Both his parents were from 
Lucca. Giuseppe came to the states in 1901, landing in New Orleans, 
then joining his two brothers who were already in Pueblo. His wife 
came over in 1905. They farmed, at first, on the mesa, but dad "was 
a city boy, he didn't take to farming." So they moved into town and 
lived on Mechanic St. until the 1921 flood washed them out. Next 
they lived on Currie Ave. 
in Bessemer. Giuseppe ran a hotel in 
Canon City from the late 
'20s to the early 
'30s, 
then it was 
"catch-as-catch-can" 
during the 
Depression. 
Giuseppe 
"went 
to 
bootlegging, just like all good Italians that needed a job." Then 
he worked at the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. Joe was born in 
1926. 
Paul's family: The Palermos were from Calabria. Paul's dad 
was dispatched to the states in 1902 at the age of 17 to evade the 
draft. He worked first in the Pennsylvania coal mines, hopped a 
freight to Chicago, worked in the South Dakota gold mines, then in 
a Grand Junction brickyard, a Trinidad coal mine and finally to 
Pueblo and a job at CF&I as a crane operator -- for 18 months. 
Then, Paul says, there was "a hellacious strike," so his dad left 
and went to work as a machinist in the railroad roundhouse. 
Joe went to work at the mill part-time while he was still in 
high school. His first job was in the open hearth, a place so 
infernal; that the heat from the floor would blister your feet. 
When a crane job opened up he inquired about it and was told by 
the superintendent, "As long as your name ends in a vowel you're 
gonna stay down in the cellar." He quit after two or three weeks 
and went to work with Paul's dad in the roundhouse, but quickly 
got tired of working graveyard seven nights a week -- he was 17 
years old -- and "went bummin,"' hitchhiking to California 
where 
he and a couple of pals picked peaches and prunes in San Jose for 
three weeks, and worked for an ice house in L.A. enlisting in the 
navy. 
Paul was born in 1928. 
His nickname is Lindy because his 
middle name is Lindberg, no "h" after Charles with an "h." We talk 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / ih k2l, 
for 
a while 
about 
family 
life: 
foods, 
games, 
holidays, 
the 
neighborhoods. At one point, Joe gets out his mother's yard-long 
rolling pin that she used to make "the best noodles in town." They 
had a forno at their next house, but knocked it down after the war 
and bought their mom a gas oven to "make life easier" for her. As 
for wine-making, Paul says it was "the one thing I used to dread 
yearly." But even now, he says, "It's not Sunday unless I have my 
spaghetti and wine." 
Paul talks about how "clannish" the Italians were: 
"If you 
were Sicilian you married a Sicilian or you had family problems." 
And 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
discrimination: 
"I 
didn't 
know 
what 
discrimination was until I went to work in the mill." 
Which brings us to their years at the mill. We talk about how 
hard the work was, and how dangerous. When I ask if the company was 
remiss when it came to safety, Joe puts it this way: "It was a lot 
easier to replace a person than it was to replace a piece of 
machinery." Paul got a job as a craneman -- one of the better jobs. 
He made three Italians, two Bojons and two Mexicans out of 125 
cranemen. 
When they got active in the union 
it was as 
"main 
grievancemen." The talk turns to strikes. The big one was in 1959 -
- 117 days. And we talk about the social life of the union and the 
bars which "would carry the steelworkers during strikes." They talk 
about what good livings they made, but what they enjoyed most was 
when they worked fulltime for the union. And neither wanted his 
kids to work there. Paul had girls. Joe's boys weren't interested. 
Paul and Joe steer me to Charles Conatore, who worked in the 
mill and had a store outside the mill; and to Joe's next-door 
neighbors, Ralph and Nettie Montera. After finishing the interview 
we go for a tour of Joe's wife Maryann's garden, which is more a 
flower than a vegetable garden. Joe calls his wife "the Walsenburg 
WOP."

The kitchen of Gus' Place for photos of the 
preparation of Dutch lunches -- of little Vera, mostly, as she 
arranges provolone, salami and ham in fan shapes. The portions are 
quite precise: larges consist of 13 slices of ham, 
13 slices of 
cheese and 9 slices of salami; smalls are 7 ham, 7 cheese and 5 
salami. When I ask why just those amounts, Vera says that's the way 
they were taught to make them and, 
"they got to look nice." She 
does about a dozen plates at a time, puts a square of wax paper on 
each, stacks them up , and carries the stack to the refrigerator. 
She's worked there 20 years. 
While she works, delivery men deliver, neighbors visit. One 
such is Roxy Carleo, another mill man, a 43-year man, 72 years old. 
A willing interviewee. He and Vera run through the Italian streets 
of Bessemer: Elm, Box Elder, Currie, El Dorado, Abriendo, Evans, 
Routt, Spruce and Railway. On July 22, according to Carleo, there's 
a Danforth School -- now the Strack school -- at Gardner, Colorado. 
Last year, 
125 people attended. 
Lot of Italians? I ask. 
"All 
Italian," Roxy says. "That's all there ever was here." The reunion 
is a five-year tradition. With the Bessemer and Blast Furnaces 
reunion coming up in the next two weeks it occurs to me that 
reunions are a big thing around here. Roxy also tells me about a 
finger game the men at Gus' used to play called Tutto I1 Mundo, and 
about bocce in the street. "Everybody knew everybody," he says. 
"There were no strangers in this town." We're too late, as usual. 
Vera moves on to onion and tomato slicing -- on manual slicing 
machines. 
The onions come pre-peeled and topped. 
Fred and his 
Boston terrier Hondo arrive -- there are three other larger dogs 
in the backyard, as well as a host of sparrows at a feeder. He 
slices the provolone, while Vera puts out the chili peppers, the 
cups of mayonnaise and the bowl of limes for the bar. 
It's 10 
o'clock, time for Vera to tend bar and for me to interview Freddy. 
We adjourn to the kitchen of his house which is reached 
through a doorway in the kitchen (formerly the grocery store) of 
the tavern. From the street, the buildings do not appear to be 
attached. 
We begin, as usual, with the family background. The Masciorta 
family is from Agnone, a farming town about 20 miles from Naples. 
His mother was born in Denver. Still, his parents' marriage was an 
arranged one. His dad worked at the mill in the daytime and at his 
father-in-law's bar in the evening. He bought the present house and 
bar in 1925. We cover food, wine-making, Italian language, what 
kind of a guy Gus was, the role of the tavern in the life of the 
millworkers. In short, a lot of ground. Perhaps too much: we don't 
get into a lot of detail. 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / lgk• 
Domenick Bucciarelli's turn is next. He takes Freddy's place 
at the kitchen table. His dad was only 11 when he left Italy. He 
landed in New York, worked as a water boy on the railroad at first, 
then moved onto the coal mines and coke ovens of southern Colorado. 
He sent his wages back to Italy, keeping enough to live on, went 
back there to get married, but left his wife there, and went back 
a few times to father his children. Then he bought into a grocery 
store in Salt Creek and the family's been there ever since. It was 
mostly Mexican back then, as well as now. The sturdy brick house 
was built in 1939. 
In 1933, 
his father opened the saloon, 
now 
leased to somebody else and called Willy's. 
Domenick was born 
September 12, 
1916. His father's saying was, 
"Leave your family 
better off than I left you." Domenick describes life in Salt Creek, 
what little he remembers of the great flood in 1921 (he was 5), his 
work at the ordnance depot, etc. 
"You can't find a better, more 
congenial loving people than the Italians," he says in conclusion. 
Exhausted and a little beery, 
I accept Vera's offer of a 
sandwich, take a couple of more pictures of Freddy and his son 
Barry -- who says he fully intends to keep the place going -- and 
leave Gus' Place for another day.

I arrive at Bessemer Mercantile around 8:30 
a.m. to watch Joe Cortese, son-in-law of the Gaglianos who started 
the store, make sausage. It's a two-phase process -- grinding and 
seasoning the meat and feeding it into its casing. I'm there to 
watch the second phase. The meat comes from Denver in the form of 
pork butts which they bone and cut up. 
The recipe is Carmela 
Gagliano's. She's 95 and available for interviewing -- in Italian. 
The recipe is a secret. 
It hasn't changed since the business 
started in 1923. "We couldn't tell you a cup or a tablespoon," says 
Rose Cortese, Carmela's daughter. "We had to watch her: a fistful 
of that and a pinch of this and a pinch of that." 
ordinarily, 
says Joe, 
they make 50 pounds at a time. 
At 
Christmas, they make about 1,500 pounds. Most of it is sold retail. 
"Everybody tells us it's the best they ever had. They come from all 
over, even out of town. Rose tells me she'll cook some for me when 
we come back to interview her and her mother. invited me to come 
back and she'll cook some up for me. Once, Joe says, there were 125 
little Italian groceries around town. 
Now, 
he says, 
there are 
three. 
Their own business 
"has been going downhill since the 
freeway was built." 
They lend me a photo of the store in more thriving times --
the early '30s. Rose points out the vinegar barrel and tells me 
"everything was in bulk."

Interview with brothers Ralph and Pete Montera, 
and Ralph's wife Nettie. 
Before we begin, 
Ralph shows me his 
immense -- 75' x 120' to be exact -- garden, which has to be one 
of the biggest in-town plots in Pueblo. It sits alongside rather 
than behind the house, open space where you' d expect to see another 
house. The vegetable inventory: green and yellow squash, 
green 
beans, 
swiss 
chard, 
turnips, 
red 
beets, 
miniature 
pumpkins, 
kohlrabi, kale, okra, cantaloupes, honeydew, "five different kinds 
of pimento peppers, bell peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, 
pickles, 
garlic. 
"Most 
of 
your 
Italian 
families, 
instead 
of 
planting shade trees, planted fruit trees," says Ralph. He has 
plums and apples. I ask him what he does with all that his patch 
produces and the answer, predictably, is that he gives it all to 
friends, family and neighbors. He tends it all by himself, he says, 
but "I can take off on a trip and the neighbors take care of it" -
- that is, take care of watering it. The idea of selling any of it 
for money he dismisses as absurd. 
The interview takes place around the dining room table, a set-
up I'm growing increasingly fond of because it's where people are 
already in the habit of chatting with each other. Ralph, with his 
sharp nose, dark eyes and white hair looks like he could pass for 
Indian. His brother Pete, with his moustache and sideburns looks 
more cowboy. Nettie looks grandmotherly. 
Philip 
Montera 
came 
from 
Lucca 
around 
1892, 
landing 
in 
Galveston and working in the sugar cane fields. He had friends in 
Pueblo and came west and got his first Colorado job cooking on the 
railroad. His uncles farmed in Alamosa and on the mesa. Philip and 
family lived in the Grove until the 1921 flood. 
His wife was 
Josephine Pisciotta, born in Sicily. Phil went to work at "the 
CF&I," as everyone puts it, around 1920, and stayed there 62 years. 
When I ask if it was hard for Italians to get jobs in the mill in 
those days, Nettie says, "Italians were looked down upon. It was 
hard for them to get jobs in the mill and elsewhere." Phil worked 
in the bolt mill and helped a lot of other Italians get their jobs. 
Pete worked there for four days just to get money to repair Ralph's 
car, which he had crashed. 
"Me," Ralph says, 
"I never put one 
minute in there." 
Their descriptions about the working conditions in the mill, 
which is to say the heat in the mill are vivid. There was no

protective clothing -- everyone wore two pairs of pants, two pairs 
of socks and two pairs of gloves. The workers walked on planks 
which, even though they were soaked in water, would begin to smoke 
and would soon burst into flame if not replaced. "Many a person got 
educated because of these jobs," Pete says. The family lived a half 
block from the pig iron machine. "Nobody squawked." The saying was, 
"You don't have to worry when smoke is coming out of the stack. You 
have to worry when it's not." Their dad worked til age 75. They 
still have his lunch bucket, or half of it. 
They used it as a 
planter. 
Family life: Their dad used to read Italian stories to the 
neighbors. They also had one of the only phonographs around, on 
which they played Italian music. And "every Italian son had to play 
the accordion." They talk about the uncles buying up farm land on 
the mesa: "One thing typical of the Italians," they say, is buying 
land, because this was the one thing they could not do in Italy, 
where land was always kept in the family and divided into ever-
smaller plots. When they get to talking about how life has changed, 
Nettie says the reason for it is that "Italians aren't marrying 
Italians anymore. The families are not as close." 
Nettie serves pizzelles and coffee while we talk about food: 
spaghetti every Sunday, kid goat at easter. 
People helped each 
other plant, kill hogs. "Nobody had any money, but everybody was 
happy." Pete says, "We wore overalls and our patches had patches." 
When I ask for family sayings he remembers his grandfather's 
threat: "I'm going to send you back to Bellafranga" -- the village 
he came from in Italy. 
Nettie's family lived first in Berwin, a coal mining camp near 
Trinidad. She fondly remembers parades, picnics and parties there. 
The town, she estimates, was 75 to 80 percent Italian. For awhile 
they lived back in Indiana, where her dad worked in the Hammond 
steel mills. When they came back he went to work in the casting 
foundry at the CF&I. HIs motto, which I find delightful coming from 
a steelworker, was "Everyday a holiday." I ask if he was a jolly 
guy and Pete says, "He loved to eat and he loved to drink." 
Holidays: On Halloween night, the family's shoes would be put 
behind the door and candy was put in the kids' 
shoes. 
It was 
supposed to be coal if they were bad. On St. 
Lucia's day, they 
would buy wheat from Gagliano's Market (Bessamer Mercantile) cook 
it up as a hot cereal. On New Year's it was drop doughnuts and on 
St. Joseph's Day it was baccala. Weddings were two-day affairs. 
When we're through, I take pictures of them just as they are, 
seated around the dining room table.

TIAW-RF-F062890.C= 
Tony Martellaro has stood with one foot in each 
of the two worlds we're exploring here: he farmed on the mesa and 
he worked in the mill. One of the things that's so interesting 
about Pueblo is how close and how interlocked these two worlds are. 
The city IS very much a city. The dominance of the mill made this 
town a miniaturized version of an eastern steel town, with working 
class 
neighborhoods 
and 
accents 
and 
gritty 
brick 
factories, 
warehouses and taverns. 
But everyone had farming family on the 
mesa. Tony Martellaro doesn't sound like anyone else I've talked 
to so far. Groping for a description of his accent, I asked John 
Williams, who came up with "Southwestern twang," which just about 
says it. Strange for a guy to live about three miles from town, to 
have worked in town for years and years, but to sound so completely 
unlike the guys who grew up in Bessemer's "LIttle Italy." 
Tony's descriptions of both farm life and millwork are richly 
detailed. We begin with by-now familiar, background: his dad was 
from Lucca, 
landed in Louisiana in 1913, 
harvested sugar cane, 
hated it. The St. Charles Mesa, he says, was 60 percent Italian. 
The plots were small: 38 acres was about the biggest. People were 
closer then than they are now. 
You knew everyone on the mesa. 
Everyone 
visited. 
Everyone 
helped 
each 
other 
with 
the 
hog-
butchering. Tony's description of the hog-butchering is superb. So 
is his memory of his grandmother telling the kids stories --
fairytales, it sounds like -- and of bread-baking in the forno. 
Nothing was ever the same after his brother died 
in a freak 
shooting accident in 1939. 
On to the mill. His dad stopped truck farming in 1946 and went 
to raising corn and sugar beets and feeding cattle. 
Tony grew 
onions in 1949 and "couldn't even give 'em away." He worked at 
Fountain Sand for two years and in the mill for five months before 
getting drafted. He got out in July of 1953 and figured to work at 
the mill until the following March, then go back to farming, but 
"March never came around." Still he planned to work a couple of 
years and then farm, 
but then he got married in 1955 and kept 
working and after awhile, he says, he had too much seniority to 
quit. He finally retired in 1986 after 35 years, 23 of which were 
spent in the rail rolling mill. 
Again his description of the 
various jobs in the rail mill and the various stages in the rail-
making process, are invaluable. Of the 130 people in the rail mill, 
only two were Italian. There was very little mobility from mill to 
mill. 
"Any mill you worked in was your family." And each mill 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
frequented a different tavern. The rail mill guys went to the Main 
Gate Tavern, now Jeannie's. The mill provided a good living, but 
Tony leaves a strong impression that he would rather have stayed 
on the mesa and farmed.

in the old store. The carving and painting he does in the kitchen 
of the little house behind the store. 
Behind the backyard, the

a creaking captain's chair. Like Tony Martellaro, and to a slightly 
lesser extent, the Monteras, the Conatores memories of growing up 
in Pueblo's "Little Italy" are richly textured and fond. After our 
interview with Martellaro, Tavarelli and I were talking about how 
no amount of questioning could have elicited some of the detailed 
descriptions Tony furnished for us. Chila Conatore is the same way. 
Instead of question-answer, question-answer, it's question-answer-
story. There's an intuitive sense of what we're after here, 
an 
understanding 
that 
it's 
specificity we 
want, 
not 
generality. 
Accompanying all this fond reminiscence, of course, is a deep sense 
of loss. 
So 
much 
has 
changed 
so 
fast. 
Neighborhoods 
were 
almost 
extended 
families, 
with 
all 
the 
visiting 
and 
communal 
food 
preparation. "If you wanted to build something," says Chila, "the 
whole damn neighborhood was there to help you." Now even the 
immediate family is dispersed. People talk so rapturously about the 
bread that came out of the fornos that you can't believe they could 
sit down to a lunch of bologna on Wonder bread, but they do. It's 
like a bomb when off in the culture after the Second World War, 
wiping out all that went before. People talk as if it is something 
that happened to them over which they had no control, 
but of 
course, they made choices about the foods they ate and how much 
work they were willing to put into their preparation. The Conatores 
painted vivid pictures of backyards where tomatoes bubble in huge 
pots on wood fires, 15 loaves of bread are pulled out of fornos, 
eggplant and peppers are roasted and put up in crocks. It's all 
very picturesque, but Tavarelli reminds that it was hard work also 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes 
and that I ought to be more sympathetic to the pull of convenience 
and leisure. 
The people themselves -- the Conatores and Tony 
Martellaro -- blame intermarriage, the dispersion of families and 
television. 
For three months, Chila, his father, his father-in-law and 
his grandfather all worked in the mill at the same time. It was 
Chila who pulled out. His father-in-law, Emilio Mendicello 
made 
nail kegs. 
His dad, 
who came to Pueblo unorthodoxly by way of 
Philadelphia, the Pacific Northwest and Carson City, Nevada, worked 
in the wire mill, the rail mill and the 40-inch mill. He was the 
neighborhood hog-sticker, wedding caterer, storyteller and jew's 
harpist. 
Chila tells me a little about the mill, 
but where he 
shines, where his heart lies, is in talking about being a kid in 
the neighborhood -- the games they played, the fighting they did, 
all the little jobs he did hauling ashes, produce, working in the 
macaroni factory. When Chila opened the store, his father advised 
him to go slow in building up the business, saying, 
in Italian, 
"Those who eat too much can't eat no more. Those who eat a little 
at a time can always eat." When Chila quotes his dad, he imitates 
his accent. 
I ask Rose 
if 
she remembers any of her parents' 
sayings. When she and Chila married, her father told her, again in 
Italian, to "both get on one end of the rope and pull together." 
Her mother encouraged her talk about her problems by saying, "Even 
the queen needs a friend." 
By the third tape, Chila is all warmed up and telling me war 
stories. When we're done, I shoot pictures of his carvings, of him 
and Rose in the kitchen as they prepare lunch, and of Chila in the 
doorway of the store and in the yard with the mill behind him. I 
should note that this is the hottest day ever in Pueblo -- 108 
degrees -- which discourages, as it has since we got here, any foot 
patrol of the neighborhood.

This 
is 
the 
eighth 
annual 
blast 
furnace 
reunion, held every year at Hogan's Tavern, Northern and Berkeley. 
The owner of Hogan's is named Kiko Vargas, a former blast furnace 
man himself. At the time CF&I's last blast furnace shut down in 
1982, there were about 60 employees. There are about 110 people 
here today. Ceiling fans move the air around to no purpose, but 
what's heat to these guys? A Pueblo Chieftain story about a 
previous reunion in an album of newspaper clippings about the 
furnaces closing and being torn down quoted one veteran as saying 
that the blast furnace was "one step from hell." One guy is hawking 
"Blast Furnace Survivor" T-shirts. Many guys are wearing T-shirts 
and ball caps from past years' reunions. Tacked to a wall is a list 
"in memory of departed employees. There are about 70 names, most 
of them Spanish, three Italian. There is a cache of items to be 
auctioned off in one corner: old hard hats and leggings, a face 
shield, 
carbon bricks, pig iron, hammers and jacks, 
old signs, 
photographs. 
On the bandstand is the 
food. 
The whole spread, 
including beer is a donations only. The donations and the money the 
auction raises are applied to next year's bash. 
I introduce myself to a man who seemed to be in charge and 
indeed is, 
by the name of Joe Harris, 
who begins sending the 
Italians my way. The first one I meet is Frances Paglione, who used 
to work at the mill along with her sister who still does, 
her 
brothers, her dad and her grandfather. Frances goes behind the bar 
to get me a beer and some boiled salted peanuts (new to me) and 
then shows me the above-mentioned album. I arrange to see her and 
whichever family members she can round up next week. 
Next I meet Sam Catalano, a 36-year man, and arrange to see 
him 
too. 
Then 
I eat. 
The 
combination 
of 
foods 
is 
dazzling: 
tortillas and beans, 
spaghetti and meatballs, and ribs. 
No one 
could feel left out. 
Pete Carleo, a 35-year man, 
is eating his 
lunch on the pool table, temporary home of a glass-encased model 
of the blast furnaces. Nice photo, if there's enough light. 
After the food, the auction begins. Because they're using an 
ineffectual 
bullhorn 
instead 
of a microphone, 
the 
auctioneer 
circulates around the bar followed by Harris who sticks each item 
in each potential bidder's face. 
In the meantime, 
I chat with 
Carleo. The blast furnaces, he says, were mostly black and Mexican, 
"not too many Italians." He never intended to stay long, but it's 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / • 
the old story: he began building up seniority, became a supervisor, 
and stayed put. Since he grew up on St. Charles Mesa 
I ask him if 
he would rather have farmed, but he says he could make a better 
living at the mill than he could farming. Mill workers, he said, 
were "home people, interested in home, not in getting rich." His 
generation's 
children, 
however, 
are 
abandoning 
Pueblo 
-- 
for 
Denver, mostly: "They like something to be going on all the time." 
The auction proceeds to the heavier items that can't be 
carried around the bar. Joe Harris bangs on a serving pan with a 
metal spoon, to no avail. "Too much free beer," Carleo comments. 
A reporter and photographer from the Chieftain are on hand. After 
two-and-half hours I figure I've gotten the general idea and leave, 
well-pleased with the contacts I've made.

Interview with Pete Carleo, one of the guys I 
met at the Blast Furnace reunion. Jim Hardin's along for purposes 
of the article about fieldwork he wants to write for the Folklife 
Center's newsletter. Pete's wife Rosalie is there "to listen in," 
but I should have known better. 
In Gilroy we ran into several 
situations where the wife appeared to defer to the husband, only 
to wind up contributing as much if not more than he. So I miked him 
when I should have set up the stand and boom and miked them both. 
Fortunately, 
she spoke up loud and clear in a wonderful Texan 
accent ("You're not from around here, are you?" I asked her at the 
outset and indeed she wasn't); she could be heard just fine. 
The Carleo's house is on a corner lot where two wide, broad-
leafy residential streets (Van Buren and Pitkin) meet. Another nice 
Pueblo neighborhood. They have more iconographic furnishings than 
I've seen at other houses in Pueblo: a ceramic Madonna-and-child 
on the sideboard, a face-of-Jesus lamp base, crucifix above the 
mantel and Last Supper lithograph on the wall (next to a furled and 
leaning American flag (awaiting hoisting on the Fourth?). Pete sits 
at the dining room table, hutch behind him, wedding photo over his 
left shoulder, 
pictures of his adult children over his 
right 
shoulder. 
With very little prompting from me, Carleo skims through his 
story, 
taking us from his father's arrival in the states from 
Salerno by way of, 
I think, 
New York and on to Pueblo where 
relatives waited, and onto the Mesa, where he farmed 15 acres. Next 
thing I know, he's onto his career at the mill, though I've had to 
bite 
my 
tongue 
several 
times 
to 
keep 
from 
interrupting 
the 
breakneck narrative of all that preceded his going to work in the 
mill. Partly it's that we met at the Blast Furnace reunion, which 
has led him to assume that what I'm mainly interested in is the 
mill. Partly, I think he had no great love for farm life or farm 
work and no very fond memories of his childhood there, so he's in 
a hurry to get to the mill and a description of the work, which he 
seemed to find both satisfying and interesting. 
So on to the mill. He followed his big brother into the mill 
in 1940, 
though he insists that he did not ride his brother's 
coattails nor did his brother need to ride anyone else's to get 
hired. They simply applied. All told, five Carleo brothers would 
wind up working in one department or other of the CF&I. 
Pete 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
_L8 
started in "the big yard," the worst -- most back-breaking and 
least skilled -- job in the mill, consisting as it did of trench-
digging and brick-hauling. In 1942 he shifted over to the blast 
furnace. 
There were few Italians there -- Rosalie's comment is that 
"the Italian had better sense than to work in the blast furnace. 
The work seems to have been even hotter and more dangerous than 
elsewhere in the mill. Pete tells us about deaths and accidents. 
It was hard to shift from one department or unit to another and 
doing so would have meant the loss of hard-earned seniority, so 
Pete stayed put, 
eventually making foreman. 
Modestly, 
and not 
without some prodding from Rosalie ("You didn't have any Italian 
bosses over there"), Pete owns that he may have been the first 
Italian foreman at CF&I. 
He wasn't the type to socialize much with his fellow workers 
before he made foreman, so the change in status didn't have much 
of an affect on his relationship with the guys who were now in his 
charge. Carleo in general has little to say about the social life 
of the mill: it was too hot to talk, people ate their lunches in 
20 minutes, he didn't frequent the taverns or become active in the 
union or play cards or golf or like sports. He is at his most 
expansive in talking about the work itself, the process, and the 
satisfaction when the process "flowed," when everything was going 
smoothly. He draws diagrams of the process with his finger on the 
table. 
"The mill," 
Pete says, "was the only thing [in Pueblo] that 
ever paid any money." By the time his son came of age this didn't 
mean you go to work at the mill. It meant you left Pueblo. "I don't 
know how you ever worked in the mill," his son remarked when Pete 
took him on a tour after his retirement. The son lives in Denver, 
where he has a management job with one of the big department 
stores. In fact, none of the sons of the five brothers went to work 
in the mill. 
After a break for coffee and Rosalie's pizzelles, accompanied 
by rice krispies squares and some pink cookies we go back to 
talking about life on the Mesa. Like everyone else out there, the 
Carleos had a forno and a summer kitchen and killed their own hogs 
and worked from sunup and went to sleep at sundown. Dad was strict, 
mom only spoke Italian, and they only came into town to deliver the 
vegetables to a wholesale market. As for story and song, music and 
dancing, there was none, he claims. There was time only for work. 
It doesn't sound like life changed much after he got married, move 
to town and went to work at the mill. 
At tape's end, Pete fishes out some old CF&I literature that 
explains the iron-and-steel making processes, I take pictures of 
him and the aforementioned religious icons, and Jim takes pictures 
of the three of us -- the Carleos and me -- for possible use in his

Sam Catalano is one of the fellows I met at the 
Blast Furnace Reunion. When I arrive at his house, which along with 
the house he owns next-door has been completely surrounded by 
commercial property, Sam's still at a funeral so I chat with his 
wife -- a Bojon -- a while. It will turn out that Russell DiSalvo, 
whom I am to interview later in the day, was also at the funeral, 
as was someone Tavarelli interviewed. This, together with Ken Light 
showing us his Mississippi photos and mentioning the funeral he 
shot there, makes me regret the respectful distance I try to keep 
from such events. We should have been there. 
While I interview Sam, his wife orders a pizza from Ianne's 
on Northern Ave., which is owned by his aunt. When the pizza comes 
we adjourn to the kitchen and chase our beers with Sam's cherry 
wine. Sam apologizes for not having made a pizza himself. He cooked 
the spaghetti, meatballs and sauce for the Blast Furnace Reunion. 
After lunch he takes me down to the basement to see his wine 
barrels, through the garage to look at his raviolis and roasted 
peppers in the freezer, and out to the garden, where he is growing 
tomatoes, oregano, basil and peppers. There is a "Godfather" poster 
in the garage (Brando, Pacino, Caan, et al) and a "Laborers on Top" 
sign from the blast furnace hanging from the awning over the back 
porch. 
The interview: Sam's family is from Calabria. His uncle came 
to the U.S. 
first, 
to New York, 
and from there to Hagerstown, 
Maryland. His father, Frank, followed in 1916. His mother's 
family 
is from Cosenza; she was born in Brazil. Her father went to work 
in the roundhouse of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. 
The 
railroads, I'm beginning to realize, were just as important as the 
steel mill as an employer of Italian immigrants. Many of them, 
Sam's dad among them, worked first on the railroad -- the Santa Fe 
and the Missouri Pacific were also in Pueblo -- then shifted over 
to 
CF&I: 
mill wages were double what one could make at 
the 
railroads. 
Sam's family lived across the street from his grandparents on 
Currie. He covers the usual range of household and neighborhood 
food-making activities: bread baking, cooking and canning tomatoes, 
hog-butchering, wine-making. 
"You've never had a good piece of 
bread 'til you have one that's made outside." When a family was 
planning to whip up some Italian food the neighbors would say, "I 
/•r  
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
-2-1-
guess so-and-so is going to put out the Italian flag this morning." 
Calabrians mainly visited other Calabrians. "You seldom saw 
intermarriage between different Italians. They stick together." 
Most of the Sicilians, according to Sam, came through New Orleans 
and settled around Abriendo and E1 Dorado in Bessemer, and on Goat 
Hill. Mount Carmel was the church of choice for the Italians. 
Christmas Eve traditions: anchovies in garlic and oil on white 
macaroni. The table wouldn't be cleaned up until the following 
morning. 
All these neighborhood food-centered traditions vanished after 
World War II. When I ask him what hasn't changed, he says, the same 
beer joints are still there. His dad was caught bootlegging in 1939 
and sent to a work farm in Tucson for eight months. Sam sees no 
shame in this: he made whiskey because his family needed money. He 
remembers the recipe: 100 pounds of sugar, three pounds of yeast 
and a bucket-and-a-half of cracked corn added to a 50-gallon barrel 
of water. 
The mill: Sam went to work there at age 16 in 1939 -- a cousin 
got him in -- and he retired as a blast furnace foreman in 1976, 
six years before the blast furnaces were shut down for good. One 
furnace should have remained standing as a monument or museum. 
Knocking them down was like "knocking down the Statue of Liberty. 
That's what built Pueblo." 
"We was one big happy family," Sam says of his fellow blast 
furnace workers. Not that they got promotions beyond the level of 
foreman. The management jobs, Sam says, were for "the palefaces" 
-- the Irish, English and German guys. 
After the interview Sam invites me back for a macaroni dinner. 
I accept, provided I can take pictures of him making it. 
Deal.

This interview takes place at Biggi's house on 
the southwest side of town. His wife was to have been in on it, but 
she has a doctor's appointment. I ask Bruno to turn off the cooler 
so we don't have its noise on the tape, but this turns out to be 
a mistake. 
I'm already a little tuckered out from a previous 
interview which started late and didn't end until 10 minutes before 
this one was to start; the heat in the room doesn't help. We jump 
back and forth from Biggi's story to DiSalvo's, but DiSalvo is more 
of a talker, so he dominates the session. 
He tells me that agricultural workers were recruited from 
Sicily to harvest sugar cane in Louisiana. His dad worked at the 
open hearth at CF&I. "I don't ever recall seeing my dad very often. 
I was in bed when he went to work and I was in bed when he came 
home." His dad was killed in a mill accident in 1937. 
Russell was born on Goat Hill in 1904. He went to work at the 
mill at age 14 in 1918 and spent 18 years there before moving on 
to the highway patrol. CF&I went from a 12-hour day to an 8-hour 
day after World War I. 
Bruno's family were northerners. They lived on Box Elder in 
Bessemer, then moved over to Orman. His dad worked in the wire mill 
for 45 years; Bruno put in 47. 
DiSalvo talks about the 1920 strike and about Ku Klux Klan 
activity in Pueblo. The Italians were told not to have a Columbus 
Day parade in 1924, 
but they had it anyway -- with "shotguns 
protruding" from the windows of the cars. On another occasion, 
DiSalvo came upon a burning cross and was shot at when he tried to 
extinguish the fire. The electric shop in the mill was a bastion 
of the Klan. His three brothers all worked at the mill. None of his 
three sons ever did. 
DiSalvo's voice is reminiscent of Bogart's. He's one of the 
only people I've met who says "in those days" instead of "in them 
days."

The 
line 
blurs 
between 
fieldwork 
and 
socializing. The Collette's Fourth of July barbecue and fireworks 
extravaganza also raises questions, perhaps more insistently than 
some other situations we've been, of the "What are we looking for, 
anyway?" variety. If the emphasis is on what remains fundamentally 
or quintessentially Italian about the lives of these ever-more 
assimilated Italian-Americans, there is little to say about this 
wholly American Fourth of July celebration. But if the emphasis is 
on documenting Italian-American lives in their totality, without 
making judgments that the holdover traditions from the preceding 
generations are intrinsically more interesting and more valuable 
than the mass American culture patterns which are engulfing those 
traditions, 
this 
Fourth 
of 
July 
celebration 
was 
a deeply 
interesting 
event. 
Of 
course, 
we 
do 
come 
in 
with 
certain 
predispositions. If an Italian shops at a little Italian grocery 
store, we make note of it. If she shops at King Soopers, we do not. 
We are pleased if they play bocce, unmoved if their game is golf -
- unless they're playing in Pueblo's own annual Italian Open. 
Writing about lives that are not a whole lot different from 
one's own is a tough ethnographic challenge. Nothing is strange 
enough to engage one's attention. To pull it off you either have 
to pretend you're as much of an outsider as an anthropologist in 
New Guinea or keep in mind that America circa 1990 may be as rich 
and strange to future readers as descriptions about the Italian 
neighborhoods of Pueblo circa 1935 are to me now. Do we note, for 
example, that there are hard pretzels and corn chips to dip in 
bowls on a table on the back patio, along with ice chests full of 
beer and pop, and later, a bowl of pina colada? That instead of a 
forno, there's a brick barbecue? That we are entertained by babies 
and daughters and daughters-in-law and our host while our hostess 
prepares food in the kitchen and the sons and sons-in-law are off 
buying fireworks? 
What begins to be impressive about this event is its sheer 
size -- all of it family. I also like their zest for silly games. 
The first is a sort of telephone game, wherein everyone stands 
close together in a line and the first guy says, "There's a bear 
over there" and the next person says, "Over where?" and the first 
person says, 
"Over there," and points. Person Two has the same 
conversation with Person Three and so on down the line, til it gets 
back to the first person, who, the second time through, points in 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 3 5.8 
the other direction with his other arm. The third time through, 
the first guy, 
arms crossed, 
squats down. 
The fourth time, 
he 
shoves his neighbor, and if the line is tight enough -- which it 
was -- the domino theory will work and everyone will fall down. 
The second game called for a volunteer -- one of the little 
kids -- to lie down under a blanket and be told he's in the desert, 
burning up, take something off. He's supposed to figure out that 
what he should take off is the blanket, but if he doesn't, he's 
supposed to remove his clothes, item by item, which this little guy 
gamely did. He was spared the embarrassment of exposure, however, 
and allowed to put his clothes back on under the blanket. 
The third game has its victim close her eyes and pretend to 
be feeling different parts of a cow. When she gets to its nether 
regions, she pokes her fingers into a spoonful of peanut butter. 
The fourth one had me as its willing dupe. I was given a 
saucer of water and told to do whatever one of the daughters, who 
also had a saucer of water did. First, she dipped a finger in the 
water and rubbed one side of her face. Then she did the other 
cheek, and then she touched her finger to the other side of the 
saucer. 
The underside of my saucer, 
needless to say, 
had been 
blackened -- and so was my face. 
The feast was huge: barbecued chicken and an assortment of 
salads and desserts made by the immediate family -- the Collette's 
are 
in the catering business, 
remember -- 
or brought by the 
extended family. We filled our plates inside and ate outside on the 
patio. After dinner and games it began to get dark. Well, 
not 
really. What really happened was that the pyrotechnicians in the 
family -- the men and boys, in other words, began to get impatient 
and the fireworks began. There was quite a cache. They began with 
the small stuff -- firecrackers, and when the light did begin to 
fail, sparklers -- and then we all adjourned to the long front 
porch for the final extravaganza, which included sky rockets that 
created the kinds of showers of light that you see routinely at 
municipal Fourth of July celebrations but never on the street in 
front of people's houses. Unsafe and insane. The smoke, noise and 
all-around hilarity hit their peak when somebody shot off a bottle 
rocket which hit the house across the street and triggered its 
burglar alarms, which featured two flashing green lights and a 
siren. The cops came, by and by, 
and left, when they saw there 
wasn't much to be done about the sirens and they were unwilling to 
do anything about the perpetrators. Like I say, I don't know what 
was 
Italian 
about any 
of 
this, 
but the day had a mounting, 
irresistible 
zaniness 
and high-spiritedness 
that 
in 
the 
end, 
whatever one thinks of fireworks 
(I'm not crazy about them, 
at 
least the noise-making ones, myself), was irresistible.

Vera Gurvich are still readying Dutch lunches. 
Ken shoots the

the bar, exits for some exterior shots of the tavern alone and the

the street. Ken gets shot of him and follows him back into the bar

Fernet. 
Today's the day the story about us ran in the Pueblo 
Chieftain. It helps. When people ask what we're up to I can ask if 
they saw the story -- almost everyone has -- and so spare myself 
long-winded explanations. A story in the local paper, moreover, has

Next we stop in at Bessemer Mercantile to find out when 
they're making sausage so Ken can shoot it. We've just missed it,

argue weakly, and chow down. Both sausage and sauce are excellent, 
despite the fact that Rose, as she repeatedly protests, has lost 
her taste buds. Ken notes that a store like Bessemer Mercantile, 
withering 
in 
Pueblo, 
would 
be 
thriving 
in 
Berkeley 
or 
San 
Francisco. He's probably right. 
Well fed, we cross Northern Ave. and head for the main gate 
of CF&I. Ken gets shots of the tunnel that goes under the freeway 
(I-25) that separates the corporate offices and medical clinic from 
the mill, and of the Main Gate Tavern. We head north on Evans to 
the steelworkers union hall (Ken shoots the "No foreign cars" sign) 
and hook up with local president Gilbert Trujillo who gives me one 
name of a young Italian guy who still works at the mill, 
and 
promises to get some more.

The interview with the Pagliones -- they're 
brother and sister -- takes place in the law offices of Koncilja 
& Koncilja, Frances Paglione's nephews. She's their office manager. 
She put in about 30 years at CF&I. When she retired in 1984 she 
opened an Italian specialty store. 
It throve, 
she says but she 
didn't like retail so she went to work for her nephews. We closet 
ourselves in one of the nephew's offices, I in the vast leather 
armchair behind the desk, they in the client position in front. 
It's a tricky set-up, technically, because Louis has a resonant 
voice, while Frances speaks barely above a whisper. 
The interview: 
the family is from Caprocotta in Abruzzi. 
Their grandfather made charcoal. He came to the states because he 
heard one could "become wealthy and practically find gold in the 
streets." He landed at Ellis Island and made his way up to Boston 
where he worked in a silverware factory. He had some "paesans" in 
the area who had been out west and told him there was work on the 
railroads, 
in the mines and in the steel mills. 
I'm a little 
confused about whether they were talking about their maternal or 
paternal grandfather here -- the tape presumably, will clear this 
up -- but the next thing in my notes is that their maternal 
grandfather went to work 
in 
Pueblo's 
zinc 
smelter and their 
paternal grandfather went to work at CF&I. Italians, they say, were 
subject to "the same kind of abuse in both places." 
The 
range 
of 
responses 
to 
the 
question 
of 
anti-Italian 
prejudice and discrimination has been a striking contrast to the 
uniformity of responses to other questions about growing up Italian 
in Pueblo. Whereas everyone's mother made 15 loaves of bread at a 
time in the forno, 
no more, 
no less, 
some people remember the 
Pueblo 
of 
their youth 
as 
"one 
big happy 
family" 
-- 
Bojons, 
Italians, Mexicans, Blacks all got along beautifully. There was no 
discrimination at the mill that they know of. Others remember the 
different ethnic groups sticking to their own neighborhoods, but 
otherwise co-existing more or less harmoniously. 
Some remember an 
even finer degree of separatism involving Italians mixing only with 
other Italians from their home region. And some, like the Pagliones 
remember discrimination both in the mill and in the town. 
The Pagliones were a proud bunch. Louis had written a few 
notes to himself about things he wanted to talk about during our 
interview. One of the topics was "loss of identity." By that he 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
3-4-
meant the practice among the Anglo mill bosses of changing the 
"unpronounceable" Italian names of their workers -- often to names 
that bore no relation whatever to the original. We're not talking 
about changing Antonio to Tony (Louis himself was Luigi; Frances 
was Francesca). Their dad's last name became something like Polos. 
For years, Louis and his father worked side by side in the mill 
under different last names. Finally, they insisted that the records 
be changed. The Italians at the mill were given the most menial 
jobs 
Louis also remembers going to work for a time as a plumber's 
helper and his boss chewing him out by calling him a "red-necked 
Dago (or maybe it was wop)." Louis says he told the guy that if he 
ever called him that name again he would kill him. Contrite, the 
guy came around the Paglione house to apologize and offer Louis his 
job back. Louis wasn't there, but his dad was. His dad told the guy 
that if he had called him that name he would have killed him right 
then and there. When I ask the Pagliones what was meant by red-
neck, 
they 
surprise 
by 
saying 
it 
meant 
Catholic. 
Frances 
explanation -- 
she didn't sound sure about 
it 
-- 
is 
that 
it 
referred to the Catholics habit of bowing their heads in prayer. 
The Pagliones were from a family of 22 children, only seven 
of whom made it out of infancy. Their mother, Lucia, was 15 when 
she married their father, Antonio, who was 18. On the train from 
New York to Colorado, Louis relates, she was given a banana to eat 
and tried to eat it with the peel on because she'd never seen a 
banana before. 
Louis now lives in the house in Minnequa Heights that his 
maternal grandparents -- the DiTellas -- lived in when he was a 
boy. The interesting thing about this house is that it's a CF&I 
company house, 
built in 1902. His paternal grandfather and his 
father farmed on the Mesa in addition to working in the wire mill 
at CF&I. Louis spent part of his childhood on the Mesa. People 
there were closer, he says. 
"WE were poor, but we were a happy 
family." His dad also worked in the coal mine at Florence. He was 
blinded in one eye by a recoiling wire in the wire mill in 1915. 
Louis' son worked briefly in the open hearth and as a craneman, 
but 
announced 
in 
short 
order that 
it 
wasn't 
for 
him. 
Louis 
eventually became a supervisor, which put him the awkward position 
of supervising his own father. When he tried to tell his father 
what to do, his father would show him the back of his hand. He 
finally told his supervisor that he could not give his father 
orders, and they switched him to another shift.

While interviewing Annabelle DiIorio about her 
St. 
Joseph's 
table, 
Paula Manini 
discovered 
that Annabelle's 
husband Jim worked at the mill and recommended that I interview 
him. This is that interview. 
The wrinkle that makes the DiIorios' 
story a little bit 
different from others I've heard is that his father Carmine was a 
machinist in Italy, which enabled him to get a job in the machine 
shop at CF&I instead of starting at a menial labor job. Jim went 
to work in the 14-inch mill summers and afternoons while he was 
still in high school. It was so hot in there that the work was a 
half-hour 
on, 
half-hour 
off. 
Tires 
were 
used 
as 
protective 
leggings. After graduating, Jim joined his dad in the machine shop, 
advancing from helper to apprentice to journeyman in four years. 
The family lived on Elm St. , "two blocks from Gus' ." On Sunday 
afternoons the men played bocce with steel balls fashioned at the 
mill. The losers had to stand the winners to drinks at Gus'. Jim 
was one of 11 kids. His first bed was a macaroni box.

Our first stop today is the Columbus statue on 
Abriendo. The Admiral's bust sits atop a tall rectangular column. 
On the sides of the base are half-globes of the eastern and western 
hemispheres. The eastern hemisphere globe inadvertently offers a 
nice fable about Italians and Sicilians: The island is missing and 
so is the tip of the boot. It's as if Italy succeeded in kicking 
Sicily away, but broke its toe in the process. 
Next Ken gets shots of some of the steelworker taverns on 
Northern Ave. 
-- especially Klamm's Shell, which, like Gus', 
is 
decorated in red and serves food. 
Then we move on to Bessemer 
Mercantile where Joe Cortese is boning 50 pounds of pork shoulder 
butts and Rich Harris is cutting the meat into strips and feeding 
the strips 
into an electric grinder. 
Suddenly, 
three sets 
of 
customers enter at once. One set turns out to be a goat cheese 
maker from La Junta and her two daughters, delivering six small 
tubs of ricotta and a large wheel of goat cheese. 
An elderly 
Italian couple buys a box of mostaccioli and a bag of confetti -
- sugar coated almonds -- big at Italian weddings. 
While the men make the sausage, Rose Cortese makes lunch: fava 
beans with peas, tomato salad, olives and the inevitable sausage. 
Joe, who was pretty taciturn during previous visits, begins to open 
up a little, 
talking about his days at CF&I. 
His brothers and 
father worked there also. "That's all there was then, especially 
if a person didn't have an education." He went to work in his 
father-in-law's store in 1938 and Rose seems to regret his having 
done so because now, with his eyesight deteriorating right along 
with the business, he has no pension to fall back on. 
Rose, for the second day in a row invites us to lunch. I try 
to decline because I'm due at another appointment and at first she 
says she'll put a sausage on a roll for me to take with me, but 
somehow Ken and I wind up sitting at the dining room table and 
chowing down. I call Tavarelli to find out if she plans on coming 
over to interview Rose and her mother, 94-year-old Carmela. When 
Rose hears she won't be able to make it, she suggests that Paola 
at least come over for lunch now, but Paola figures we'll all be 
done by the time she gets there. When Rose hears Ken is not going 
with me on my appointment but is headed back to the motel, she has 
the solution: pack a lunch for Paola and David. We know we cannot 
refuse. When she throws a bag of Zoelsmann's rolls in with the rest 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
I tell her we have bread, a loaf of Zoelsmann's in fact, back at 
the motel. 
At first she doesn't believe me, 
then she doesn't 
believe it's Zoelsmann's. I swear up and down that this bread 
exists. Finally, Rose eyes me suspiciously and asks, "How old is 
it?" A couple of days, I tell her. That settles it. She's not going 
to have anyone eat stale bread. "If you're going to eat, eat good," 
she says. We surrender.

He's 39. His four boys, ranging in age from 6 to 12 sprawl around 
the living room to listen to our interview. His wife Debbie, who's 
Hispanic according to Gary and "Heinz 57 varieties" 
(I've heard 
that term for ethnic mixture a few times since I've been 
in 
Pueblo), listens in also. 
Amazingly, neither Gary's father nor his grandfather worked 
at the mill, though his maternal great grandfather, Michele (Mike) 
Occhiato did before starting his Pepsi bottling plant. 
"I would 
never have thought I'd work there," Gary says. 
He started as a

went to college, and while they became professional types, he went 
back to the mill. The work force there now, he says, 
is about 5 
percent Italian: "It's not like it was." He figures to retire in 
9 years. By then he'll have put in 20 years. He also matter-of-
factly expects to suffer some hearing loss from all those years of 
loud noise. 
The family name was DiCesare, originally. They lived on Elm 
in Bessemer. He grew up with the Masciotra boys. By the fifties, 
he says, 
little remained of the old Italian village life that 
others who grew up in the same neighborhood before World War II 
have described. "The heritage," Gary says, "is lost. When they came 
over here -- 'You're an American now.
, I think they should've kept 
it together a little." 
About the only real "Italian" facet of his 
life now, he says, may be his vegetable garden. So that's where we 
troop for a family photo at interview's end.

TIAW-RF-F070790.A= 
The first stop on this photo tour is Gus' Place 
for shots of the regulars at the bar, Dutch lunchers in the booths. 
Not much to add to what's already been said. From Gus' we go to 
Ralph Montera's house for pictures of his immense garden. Things 
have come up, or "set on," as Ralph puts it, quite a bit, since I 
was there a week ago. The heat is what's done it, 
according to 
Ralph. He pulls a kohlrabi, peels it with a penknife and hands 
slices to Ken and me. Next he picks a couple of pickling cucumbers 
and for once I feel obliged to decline a gift of food. What in the 
world are we going to do with pickling cucumbers at the motel, I 
ask him and make him keep them. 
From Montera's we swing by Lou Paglione's house, the CF&I 
company house, but it's been so extensively remodeled that we pass 
on the photo. From there we stop at Chila Conatore's house to see 
if he's gotten in his basswood so he can do so carving for us. He 
hasn't, but Ken gets shots of his wife Rose crocheting, and of 
Chila watching boxing on TV. 
From the Conatores we head east on Northern to Salt Creek for 
shots of the mill. We hunt around for a little eminence to shoot 
from. The perfect spot is on a private property, with a dog house 
and a dog chain attached to a wire, but no dog that we can see, no 
barking that we can hear. Nobody seems to be home, but we figure 
we better check, so I come around a corner of the house and look 
down and there's a large chow-like dog looking up at me. My heart 
and stomach do little flips, but the dog does nothing so I knock 
at the door and there is someone home, a young woman who has no 
objection to our taking pictures. 
From Salt Creek we go to the Roselawn Cemetery, 
find the 
Italian section and in it, 
find the names of most of the people 
we've talked to since we've been in Pueblo. 
Closer inspection 
reveals these stones to belong not to deceased relatives of the 
people we've spoken to but the living people themselves. Jim and 
Annabelle DiIorio, one says. Both born 1928. Married 1952. 
Other 
names: Giadone, Pisciotta, Musso, Bucciarelli, Collette, Passanante 
(Carlo C. 
b. 
1916 -- my friend Slewfoot from Gus'), 
Cortese, 
Dionisio, Patti, DiSalvo, Ingo. The stones, needless to say, are 
new, and so must the cemetery be, for we find no old ones. 
From the cemetery we go to More-Skinny, the used car dealer.

The family name is Moreschini. The business started in 1939 out of 
a filling station at Summit and Pine. 
It moved to the present 
location on 13th and Santa Fe in 1958. Mr. Richard More-Skinny 
himself is there, dapper in a little straw hat and just about as 
skinny as the man on the neon sign with the bow tie, striped shorts 
and bag of cash in his hand. When the sign is lit, 
son Robert 
reminds us, the hands move. Robert's brothers Greg and Gary also 
work at the business. Their great grandfather worked at the CF&I 
mines in Spring Gulch, Colorado, near Glenwood Springs. . 
A woman from Florence -- a little mining town near Canon City, 
that is not, 
as far as anyone I've spoken to knows, named for 
Firenze in Italia -- is at More-Skinny to get her car serviced. I 
ask her if there are any working coal mines in her town and she 
brings me over to her husband who gives me the names of a couple 
of people connected with the Florence mines. So that's a bonus.

Lou and Lil Sciortino are brother and sister. 
The interview was to have taken place at their parents' house on 
Elm St., but Lil called me early in the morning to tell me her 
folks had chickened out and to ask me to come out to her house at 
the far south end of town instead. When I arrive, Lil is cooking 
sausage (and complaining that her son had taken her best skillet 
on a camping trip) and Lou's wife Georgia is cooking "Italian fried 
bread" on an electric skillet. They're flatter than rolls, 
but 
rounder than pancakes and served with butter and sugar. A platter 
of those makes its way to the dining room table, along with the 
sausage, salami, melon balls and coffee. So that's where we do the 
interview, 
amid 
the 
ambient 
sound 
of 
forks 
on 
plates 
and 
overlapping conversation. At the table are: Lil, Lou, Georgia (a 
Bojon) and one of their sons, who's around 8 years old. 
The 
Sciortinos 
are 
unique, 
not 
only 
to 
the 
best 
of 
my 
knowledge, but to the best of theirs, 
too, 
in that they cling 
tenaciously to the Italian foodways they grew up with. This is rare 
enough among people of their parents' generation. Among their own 
generation -- she was born in 1942, he in 1950 -- it's nothing less 
than astonishing. They credit their parents. Mom -- Rosalie --
still cans and makes pasta. So does Lil. So does Lil's daughter, 
who's 24. Dad -- Joe -- still makes sausage, still slaughters a kid 
goat for Easter, still gardens (planting it on St. Joseph's Day). 
The family still gathers on Elm St. -- Joe and Rosalie refuse to 
move -- on Sundays for a spaghetti dinner. Lil talks at length and 
feelingly about these Sunday gatherings, and about the foods and 
traditions associated with St. Lucia's Day (December 13), the St. 
Joseph's Table, and the foods of Christmas. She fairly brims with 
Italian pride and devotion to Italian tradition. At one point she 
says her mother was thinking about slacking off on some of these 
traditions, but she wouldn't hear of it. Like everyone else I've 
spoken to from that neighborhood, Lou and Lil speak with great 
fondness of growing up there. Even now, they say, "there's a bond 
between people from Elm St." Knowing that they grew up there in the 
fifties, the time I've begun to think of as the transition time, 
when the old ways began to fall into disuse and the old families 
began to move away, I fling questions at them: when was the street 
paved, when did people get cars, when did they stop using the 
forni, stewing tomatoes in kettles over outdoor wood fires, making 
wine, butchering hogs. Their answer to most of these questions, 
interestingly enough, is when the freeway came through -- claiming 
all of El Dorado St. and parts of Currie and Box Elder -- in 1955. 
L41 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes /

The Sciortinos are also a mill family. Joe retired as foreman 
-- a "white hat" -- in 1978. Lil worked in the office for a time. 
Her son, 
David Novak, 
21, 
(Lil changed her last name back to 
Sciortino after she and her husband divorced) just got on in the 
bar mill. And Lou is a foreman now. In the old days, they tell me, 
the Italians had to change their last names if they were to have 
any chance of getting promotions. Lou talks about his job, 
his 
frustrations with the company, and his pessimism about its future. 
After the interview, Lil offers to take me on a walking tour 
of the old neighborhood, which I record on tape. We stroll south 
on Elm, west on Fairview, south on Currie, then back to Fairview 
and south on the alley between Currie and Box Elder -- there's a 
forno in one of the backyards, perhaps the only one left in the 
city -- west on Summit, north on the alley between Box Elder on 
Elm, west on Fairview, 
and north on the alley between Elm and 
Abriendo, pointing out where the Italians lived and shopped and 
still live, which streets were off-limits to the Sciortino kids 
(because they didn't know anybody on that block, and where they 
played their street games all the while. The houses and yards were 
much tidier in those days, she assures me. The Elm-Abriendo alley 
takes us past her parents' 
yard. 
The chicken coop and summer 
kitchen, though no longer in use, still stand. 
At Abriendo, Lil asks if I'd like to retrace the route they 
took to get the Mt. Carmel Church across the river in the Grove 
section. So off we go in the mid-afternoon heat, recorder and two 
cameras dangling, along the weedy Abriendo exit on I-25, down an 
embankment, over a flattenable chain-link fence, onto the Denver 
& Rio Grande Railroad tracks and across the railroad bridge over 
the Arkansas. Lil does all this in a skirt and stockings. She was 
always a tomboy, she says. I admire her pluck. On the railroad 
tracks she picks up and hands me a couple of railroad spikes, made 
at the CF&I. We retrace our steps back to Elm St. 
and take our 
leave of each other at her parents house. I re-do a portion of the 
tour to take photos and have the good fortune to have a couple of 
the old ladies still on the block come out onto their porches to 
see what I'm doing. When I tell them I'm one of the researchers 
written about in the article in The Chieftain, they let me take 
their pictures, Josephine Canzoneri and Josephine Vaccaro 
(Joe 
Sciortino's sister). While I'm at it, Lil drives by and hands me 
a can of beer wrapped in a napkin, 
for which I am grateful. We 
thank each other profusely for the tour and the interview.

Mike Kraska, CF&I public relations director, 
takes us on a tour of the mill. A car tour; we never get out and 
walk around. Still, we can't complain. After twice invoking the 
company's no photos policy, he has agreed to let us come back and 
take pictures of the Italian employees. We need only give him a 
list of names and departments, and he'll arrange the rest. The tour 
itself is worthwhile from the standpoint of having some images to 
associate with all the things my interviewees have been telling me, 
but too confusing to map out because of all the doubling back we 
do. And some of the most interesting things to photograph -- like 
guys grilling their lunches -- we won't be able to photograph 
because, as Kraska explained, the company does not want to appear 
to condone this method of lunch preparation, nor does it want to 
gives its stockholders the idea that guys are having cookouts 
instead of working. We also saw some good graffiti scratched into 
some rusted sheets of steel, and got a peek at a guy in his drawers 
in one of the locker rooms. That was about it for the human side 
of the place. The tour also gave me a better sense of which parts 
of the operation are defunct and which are still turning out steel. 
The highlights are seeing orange-hot ingots and the pouring off of 
orange-hot slag. 
When I get back to the motel I get to working on my list of 
names of guys we want to photograph, beginning by calling Gilbert 
Trujillo at the steelworkers' 
local, who passes me over to Lou 
Riccillo, rail finishing, who comes up with the following names: 
Tony Costanza, Mike Venuto, Joe Fabrizio, Dale Spinnuzzi and John 
Granato, tube mill; and Tony Panariso, steel production (I already 
have this name from Gary DeCesaro). Along with DeCesaro, tonight's 
interview, Vic Alfonso, and already interviewed Lou Sciortino, that 
should be plenty.

of the fishermen we met in San Pedro, or the Bertolones in Gilroy, 
there is nothing about Vic Alfonso's house to tip you off that this 
is an Italian family. By which I mean, I suppose, that there are 
no maps on the wall, no plates or tiles with Italian scenes or 
sayings, and no religious iconography. It's a tasteful American 
middle class living room, which begs the question, what does a 
tasteful American middle class living room look like? -- a question 
I have no intention of answering. 
I sit with Vic -- age 40, short, dark hair, light blue eyes, 
fine "aquiline" nose -- in the "dinette" area adjacent to the 
kitchen. His high school-age son sits in on the beginning of the 
interview and his wife joins us near the end. He's a soft-spoken 
and a well-spoken guy. 
The bare bones version of the family history goes like this: 
His Sicilian grandfather worked in the coal mines near Walsenburg. 
His Abruzzese grandfather farmed near Trinidad. His father was one 
of five of seven brothers who worked at CF&I. He started in the 
coke plant and worked 13 years in the mill before he retired around 
1942-3. Vic grew up in Bessemer on the 1100 block of Routt. His dad 
raised 
and butchered 
rabbits 
-- 
and a goat 
for 
Easter. 
His 
grandfather made wine. His mother baked bread, but indoors. 
Vic went to work at CF&I as an electronic repairman in 1970. 
Working at the mill, he says. He moved up to relief foreman and 
now is a supervisor in steel production. I wish I had had the 
temerity to ask all these guys how much money they make. 
Real 
estate is cheap in Pueblo, still the Alfonsos have a nice house at 
the end of a cul-de-sac in a newer part of town.

TIAW-RF-F071090.A= 
Here's how this came about: 
Somebody, 
or a 
couple of somebodies, told me there was still a working coal mine 
or two in Florence. Seeing and photographing a coal mine and/or 
talking to someone who worked in one began to seem important 
because 
of 
the 
strong mill-mines 
connection. 
So many 
of 
the 
steelworkers we've talked to had fathers or grandfathers who worked 
in the mines. After getting no where with the leads I got from the 
Florence couple we met at More-Skinny, I went to the good old 
Yellow Pages and called the Twin Pines Coal Mine. 
Joe Carpine 
called me back and when I explained what I was after, he said he's 
been a coal miner all his life, all his uncles were coal miners, 
his father was a coal miner and both his grandfathers were coal 
miners. Sounds like I hit the jackpot, I said. You hit the jackpot, 
he said. 
So we drive on out there, 
from Pueblo to Florence, 
from 
Florence on to Rockvale, and from Rockvale out to the mine. Joe, 
who simultaneously reminds me of Tony Bennett and Mario Cuomo, is 
running a loader when we drive up and says he has to unload a truck 
before he'll have any time for us, so we cool our heels in Canon 
City for an hour or so, come back and get ready to go underground: 
miners' helmets and belts with battery and self-rescue units. 
The days of narrow gauge ore cars are over, at least at this 
mine: We climb into a golf cart, me next to Joe, Ken in back, and 
head for the semi-circular mine entrance, the semi-circle being 
formed by corrugated steel. 
Out of another such hole comes a 
conveyor belt with a sorter at the top which separates the big 
chunks from the fine stuff. 
By combining an interview with a tour of the mine, I figure 
to spare Ken having to sit around and myself yet another round of 
stock questions about Italian-American-ness without too great a 
sacrifice 
of 
sound 
quality. 
Not 
that 
I don't 
ask my 
stock 
questions. 
But asking them while riding into the dark of 
an 
underground mine varies the context enough to freshen the exchange. 
This is Twin Pines Coal Mine #2. Number 1 was started in 1956 
by Joe and his Uncle Budgie "Coke" Fazzino, one hill over. Number 
2 was started in 1985 on the site of two old mines, the Last Chance 
and the Golden Quality. Uncle Budgie's in his 80s now, still living 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / 
in the little town of Brookside, where he and his wife raised Joe, 
whose parents died when he was a young child. That town, Joe tells 
us, 
along with Rockvale and Coal Creek and Florence, 
was 
"90 
percent Italian" and what he vividly remembers about growing up in 
Brookside is the big festival of St. Rocco, held at St. Anthony's 
Church next-door to the Fazzino's house. It's fascinating to think 
there was this Italian village life 
flourishing in the Rocky 
Mountains as 30? 40? 50? years ago. 
The Twin Pines Mine has 
15 
employees, 
six of whom work 
underground. At a branching of the tunnel, about 2,700 feet down, 
according to Joe, we leave the golf cart and walk in, heads bowed 
because the ceiling -- inexplicably, to me -- is just a few inches 
shy of letting an average-sized guy from walking fully upright. The 
lights from our helmets make the smooth black rock sparkle in the 
darkness. We catch up with the continuous mining machine: a long, 
low truck with a sort of spiked wheel at the end of it that chews 
the coal out of the rock face and deposits on the belted bed of the 
truck. The truck is then driven to the belt that carries the coal 
to the surface and the coal rolls from one belt to the other. 
Joe contrasts the machine work with the pick-axe work of the 
old-timers and speaks admiringly about their strength, stamina, 
speed and meticulousness. He takes after them, he says. He hates 
a sloppy mine. We watch the mining machine for a little while until 
the workers break for lunch, which turns out to be a lucky break 
for us because instead of coming up for air -- not that they need 
to; the air underground is cool and surprisingly fresh -- they 
retire to a "lunchroom" a little grey-black cavern furnished with 
ceiling lights, benches and girly calendars. 
I continue asking Joe questions there, then realize that I'm 
not allowing lunchtime conversation to flow. So I ask, knowing I'm 
asking for it, what they'd be talking about if I weren't there with 
a tape recorder. One guy says they'd be talking about Joe. Joe says 
they'd be talking about hunting, fishing, football, their bowling 
team (depending upon the season) and their trucks. Yesterday, they 
say, they argued about whose truck gets better gas mileage. One of 
the guys is Italian: Danny Cornella. He has lots of relatives who 
worked at the CF&I mills in Pueblo. 
After lunch, Ken poses the group for a portrait, and we ride 
back out into the open air. Joe says we ought to go talk to his 
uncle in Brookside, so we make that our next stop. We feel very 
slick about our success in getting into a working coal mine, two 
days before we skip town.

Joe Carpine has piqued our curiosity about 
Italian life in these little coal towns, so we go to see his Uncle 
Budgie "Coke" Fazzino in Brookside. When I asked, during our mine 
tour, if stories circulated around the mines about guys who were 
particularly strong or fast or skillful in their work, Joe said 
folks talked about his uncle that way. Indeed, even in his mid-
80s, Budgie Fazzino is a remarkably vigorous and jovial man. He 
takes us to his wine cellar -- a small room dug into a vented 
hillock at a little distance from his house -- to sample some 
Fazzino Vino. "This is the way the old-timers used to make their 
wine," he says. "No sugar, no additives, this is just nothing but 
pure grapes. 
He draws from a 1981 barrel made from grenache, 
zinfandel and one other grape that is unintelligible in my notes. 
Ken and I later pronounce it sherry-like. Coke says he used to go 
in on California grapes with "guys from Pueblo" 
-- with Tony 
Bacino, in fact, the mayor of Goat Hill. He last made the stuff in 
1984. 
Next he shows us around his 50 by 125-foot garden where grow 
peppers, 
garlic, 
basil, 
okra 
and beans. 
He 
has 
an 
elaborate 
irrigation system fed by a reservoir that he dug to warm his too-
cold well water. He is also proud of the grafts he's done on his 
fruit trees. "I learned from the old Italians." 
Coke has to go pick up his grandson at a birthday party. 
Before he goes we stand under some trees and lean against his truck 
as he tells us about his father and grandfather. His father, he 
says, took six sharp picks into the mine every day. Near the end 
of a lifetime of pick-swinging, he couldn't uncurl his hands. Of 
the continuous mining machines that replaced pick work, he says, 
"Oh, what my dad wouldn't do to see this!" Coke remembers going 
with his father to get house coal out of a shut-down mine. His dad 
would pick it out and Coke would wheel it out with a wagon. His 
grandfather "was an awful strong man. Big wrists. He was just a 
tough guy." And because he was "the strongest man in town" it fell 
to him to get up on a ladder and place the corner stone on all new 
stone buildings in the town. Lifting those stones into place, "his 
muscles would stick out like watermelons." Coke himself mined from 
1935 to 1982.

TIAW-RF-F071190.A-- Mike Kraska, CF&I's PR guy, comes through. He's 
arranged for us to get in with cameras -- apparently no mean feat 
in and of itself -- and he has contacted all the Italians on the 
list I submitted to him the day before and they're all expecting 
us. Goggled, hard-hatted and green-jacketed, our first stop is the 
carpentry shop, where Lou Sciortino works. As a supervisor, he does 
not represent an opportunity to shoot anything like a guy pouring 
molten metal, but Kraska is more relaxed about just where and what 
we do shoot than I expected him to be, so Ken gets shots of him 
solo in a doorway and seated on a bench in front of lockers gaily 
decorated with Denver Broncos, steelworkers union and radio station 
stickers, and with his crew in front of a saw and outside the shop. 
His crew razzes him, of course. "When he's here, he's the boss," 
one says, "but he's not all here." Kraska tells me we should come 
back at Christmas time and see Lou's house. Apparently he's got the 
kind of light display that draws gawkers from miles around. 
From the carpenter's shop we head for the tube mill where John 
Granato, Dale Spinuzzi, Joe Fabrizio, Mike Venuto and Tony Costanzo 
are waiting for us in a little office above the floor of the plant. 
The plant itself is huge and roaring, with cranes rumbling overhead 
like elevated subway trains and the rolling of fire-glowing steel 
pipe down below. Ken gets some nice shots of the group of them 
standing in front of several stacks of finished pipes in their hard 
hats and safety glasses. If we had the time I would stay and record 
a conversation with the lot of them. Costanzo is somewhat of an 
anomaly in this town of turn-of-the-century immigrants. He came 
from Sicily in 1964 with the idea of learning English and becoming 
an interpreter at the UN. He had a brother who'd been in Pueblo for 
30 years, so he came out here and went to work in the mill. He's 
been there 23 years. 
Next we go to the rail mill for some pictures of Lou Riccillo, 
the guy who rattled off the list of names I gave to Kraska. And 
from the rail mill we go to steel production for pictures of Vic 
Alfonso and Gary DeCesaro. DeCesaro poses in front of an ingot 
mold, then dons his leather leggings and the 
gray woolen overcoat 
that are supposed to protect him from sparks when he's pouring 
steel. We don't get to take pictures of him 
pouring steel, but in 
these shots, as with the shots in the rail mill and the tube mill, 
we get a good sense of what the workplace looks like and are 
satisfied that the photos will establish the continuity between the 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / •4  
Al 
interviews with the retired guys and the presence of the next 
generation -- second generation Americans, most of them -- at the 
mill. Showing that Italian guys still work there as their fathers 
and uncles and grandfathers did before them was far more important 
to us than document the steel-making process.

After taking our photos at the mill, we drive 
around to see what other loose photographic ends we can tie up. We 
stop at Zoelsmann's Bakery, mentioned by many -- the Dutch lunches 
at Gus' Place are served on Zoelsmann's bread, for example -- to 
find out when they do their baking. This is not as far off the 
Italian 
track 
as 
it 
may 
seem: 
Zoelsmann's 
Bakery 
is 
also 
Martinelli's Deli. Chuck Martinelli has owned it for 31 years. The 
bakery was started in 1894. The baking used to be done outdoors. 
The 
indoor ovens they have there now are themselves old and 
picturesque, but the dough-making begins around 11:30 p.m. and the 
loaves go into the ovens at 1:30 a.m. and the bakers are not even 
Italian so we feel, in good conscience, that we can pass this one 
up. 
Next we go to Mount Carmel Church shoot the stations of the 
cross, 
the stained glass windows with the names of the Italian 
families who paid for them inscribed on them, and the figures of 
St. Lucia and her plate of eyes, and another saint who we think is 
St. 
Rosalia because she bears a book and a skull, 
the same 
trappings as the St. Rosalia statue that is paraded through the 
streets and down to the waterfront in Monterey during the festival 
that bears her name. The real bonus of this little excursion is 
that the cookie-baking ladies in the basement who we expected to 
be Hispanic turn out to be Italian. I get an inkling of this when 
I look at the cookies themselves -- thousands of them (300 pounds 
worth) -- and recognize them as the same little yellow and pink 
iced loaves that have found their way into our motel room office 
for the past three weeks. When I ask the ladies what kind of 
cookies they are, 
they say, 
"Italian cookies." Baking for the 
annual Mt. Carmel Church festival to be held July 14 and 15 are 
Virginia Consinero, Virginia Mitchell, Janet Paraylia, Rose Juinta, 
Rose Latino, Rose Martellaro, Elizabeth Oakley, Marie Petrick, Rose 
Sarlo, and grand dame of them all, Lucy Dagnillo. Most of these 
women lived in Bessemer and most were married to steel workers. 
When I express my surprise -- I had the idea that the Italians, 
having moved out 
of the adjacent neighborhoods, 
had attached 
themselves to other churches -- one woman tells me, "Now we're all 
scattered, but we still belong to this parish." 
The baking was done at the Verderaime Bakery. The cookies were 
carted over to the church for bagging. Come Friday, the same crew 
will 
assemble 
to make 
100 
pounds 
of meatballs 
-- 
from Lucy 
4 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / -9 
Dagnillo's recipe. The cookies and the meatballs (in the form of 
meatball sandwiches) 
will be sold at the Italian booth at the 
festival which takes place in the parking lot across the street 
from the church. While the women are dealing with the cookies 
inside, the men are setting up the booths outside. On Sunday after 
mass there will be a procession, with Our Lady of Mount Carmel 
being carried out of the church. 
Quite a weekend for Italian 
festivity coming up. There's also the Italian Open Golf Tournament. 
Too bad we're leaving. (David Taylor will be here.) 
our last stop on our last photo tour is the steelworkers union 
hall, for shots of the retirees at their games of poker and pool. 
Tony DeSalvo, who was so unresponsive the first time I visited the 
hall, is quite affable today. His bio: family from Agnone, grew up 
on the 900 block of Elm, age 79, 
33 years in the boiler shop at 
CF&I, retired in 1974, his dad and brother worked in the mill. A 
kibbitzer gives us the Italian count for the room: 4 of 8 at one 
poker table, 1 of 6 at the rummy table, 1 of 8 at the other poker 
table. The card players pay us very little mind, which is just as 
well, from a photographic point of view. 
Our last stop, a crap-shoot, cold-calling, is at the Santa Fe 
Railroad yard. We duck into a locker room and strike it rich once 
again: the guy we meet there is Joe Prutch, an Italian. He figures 
we'd best get permission to take pictures and poke around the yard, 
so we go to see the train master, Red Anderson, who tells us that 
permission for that sort of thing has to come from Chicago. He 
advises we call in the morning.

The Chicago PR office of the Santa Fe Railroad 
has no objections to our work in the Pueblo yards. We apprise Red 
Anderson of this, he verifies it, has us sign a liability waiver, 
and we go find Jim Prutch. We do a short interview with him in the 
locker room. The family name, he thinks, was Puccio, originally. 
Both his grandfathers worked on the railroad. One of them also 
lived on the Mesa and farmed. I think he says his dad worked at the 
ordnance depot -- the third big employer of Italians prior to World 
War II along with CF&I and the railroads -- but I'd have to listen 
to the tape to make sure. Prutch was born in 1951, came out of the 
navy at age 19 and took his grandfather's advice to go to work for 
the railroad. So he did. The early '80s layoffs and "downsizing" 
at CF&I had a direct impact on the railroad. They're down to 12 
yard guys. 
The trains handle mostly scrap metal for CF&I, 
and 
grain. 
After the interview, we ask Prutch to show us around. He does 
more than that: he does his job, which consists largely of throwing 
switches and piloting the engine via the walkie-talkie he wears in 
the 
bib 
of 
his 
overalls. 
The walkie-talkies 
came 
in 
in 
the 
late'70s, he says. And he demonstrates all the hand signals they 
used to use before the arrival of the walkie-talkies. One learned 
the signs by being in a line of switchmen and imitating the guy 
above you on the line and asking what it meant afterward. "The old 
heads," he says, wouldn't even talk to you." It was all signals. 
Prutch asks if we'd like to climb onto the engine. We thought 
he'd never ask. We don't really go anywhere, just backing up and 
going forward, switching from track to track, adding cars to "make 
a train" bound for CF&I. We're invited along, but we haven't the 
time. Again, we feel slick, getting at least a thin slice of the 
railroad connection on our last day in Pueblo. As in the mill, 
we've succeeded in establishing the occupational continuity over 
three or four generations of Italians.

Mount Carmel Church: last stop before I make 
my getaway, and it's a memorable one that only a video camera could 
capture. David's stills and the notes I scribble while I schmooze 
with the ladies will have to do. We enter the kitchen of the church 
basement and find about a dozen women making meatballs for the 
sandwiches that will be sold at the "Italian booth" -- along with 
hamburgers, hotdogs, 
"pop," 800 bags of Italian cookies and 62 
dozen pizzelle -- at this weekend's Feast of Our Lady of Mount 
Carmel. The pizzelle and the chili relish for the burgers were made 
by Elizabeth Oakley, nee Patti. The booth usually nets $4,000. The 
official date of Our Lady's feast is July 16, 
one of the women 
tells me. "We usually have it as close to her feast day as we can." 
Lucy Dagnillo, 85 -- she's wearing an "I May Be an Oldie But 
I'm a Goodie" apron -- and Janet Paraylia ("the two oldest ones," 
according 
to 
Janet) 
are 
mixing 
the 
meat. 
Lucy 
reveals 
the 
ingredients, but not the proportions: ground beef and pork, bread 
crumbs, romano cheese, parsley, salt, black pepper, eggs, basil 
and "spices." 
One of the women had told me they've all been 
involved in cooking for the festival for 30-40 years. Another had 
said, more like 50 years. A third makes it 60. 
("We're all giving 
our age away.") Lucy says she's been making the meatballs for 60 
years, and I believe her. She's a round little lady with a kerchief 
on her head and carpet slippers on her feet. Her maiden name was 
Masciotra -- Gus was her dad's (Salvatore) first cousin. He was a 
railroad man. Her husband Mike was a steelworker, of course. And 
she grew up on the 900 block of Elm Street -- of course. 
(Have I 
mentioned already that it's hard to figure how there could have 
been enough houses on Elm Street to lodge everyone who says they 
grew up there?) For the last 56 years, Lucy has lived on the Mesa. 
She still has and still uses her forno -- for Easter, weddings and 
"banquets." "We used to can a thousand pounds of tomatoes," she 
says. 
The rest of the women, most of whom were from Goat Hill, a 
mile away, 
are standing around a table making the meatballs as 
Virginia Mitchell 
(maiden name Zazzaretti), using an ice cream 
scoop, provides mounds of uniformly sized meat. There are several 
coffee cups full of vegetable oil on the table, 
into which the 
women dip their fingers every so often to keep the meat from 
sticking to their hands. 
The finished meatballs are placed on 
Russell Frank - fieldnotes / •-5-Cr 
cookie sheets and broiled in the ovens. 
On the stove top, 
30 
gallons of sauce, concocted before we got there (of canned tomato 
paste and puree, garlic, basil, parsley and black pepper) boils 
and bubbles. The whole scene reminds me of movies I've seen of 
quilting bees. When I ask the ladies when else they see each other 
nowadays, aside from the week before the feast, one answers, "We're 
all bingo players -- we have to do something besides work." 
The meatball rollers reminisce about festivals past: 
"They pinned $100 bills on the Virgin Mary when I was kid." 
"They don't do that anymore." 
"That stopped a long time ago." 
"They used to fight to carry it (the statue, in the 
procession)." 
"The ones who gave the most money got to carry it." 
The feast, clearly, ain't what it used to be. But as we take 
our leave of the women, one says, "It's too bad you can't see the 
festival. It gives you the chills."

First stop is the festa at Mary Star of the Sea 
Church, your basic carney-run carnival : bumper cars , ferris wheel, tilt-a-
whirl, etc., but also festival queen candidates selling raffle tix, local 
Italian-American orgs. selling food or "chances" at teddy bears and such. The 
lady selling folk-arty posters of the town -- in which the church itself and 
the blessing of the fleet figure prominently -- launches into the sad tale of 
the decline of the fishing fleet. The brick inside and out church has a nice 
stained-glass window depicting a fishing boat, roiling sea, and big, shining 
fish being handled by a big, shiny fisherman . Or at least that's how I 
remember it. It will , of course, be photographed. And the craftsperson who 
executed it will be found out . We came back in the evening -- direct from our 
meal in a Venetian-Italian shopping center restaurant (this is California, 
folks ) where hung a painting of the arcades of St. Mark's Square (excuse me, 
Piazza San Marco ) with a moonscape instead of pigeons and cafes filling the 
square -- just in time for the crowning of the queen. It was teen heaven, the 
air was heavy with the smell of french fries and , having just eaten sculpin 
livorgnese -- I was impressed with the way the signora (David knows her name), 
presented the entire fish on a platter and took the meat off the bones and 
kept the head, saving me the trouble of dealing with it -- the whirling carney' 
rides did not appeal , so we cut out.

What leaps out at you at A-1 imported groceries are 
all the brands of olive oil they carry; an entire aisle devoted to pasta, a 
piece of oaktag on which are pasted cut-out pictures from a photo joke book on 
how to be an Italian. Behind the counter, Emiddio Ungaro, named for his 
grandfather, 30-something, said he was born in (near?) Naples, came to the 
states a babe in arms, married an Italian girl because you gotta stick with 
your own kind and friends of his who did not stick with their own kind wound 
up divorced, speaks Italian at home, but refuses to do so in the store, and 
sported a World Champion L.A. Dodgers cap while sipping from an L.A. Lakers

hugged and kissed by old ladies all the time. He sounded like he minded.

Shambling along the near-deserted fishing slip late 
this afternoon, I came upon Mike Taormina behind the wheel of his Chevy pickup 
with another gent in the passenger seat and Joe Randazzo leaning in. Taormina, 
I knew, is a taciturn sort. I was looking for his brother Leonard. Catch him 
in the morning, he said. Morning is when the fishing slip jumps. Retired 
fisherman Gerrard Fiorentino still keeps fishermen's hours at his marine 
supply shop: 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Same is true nextdoor at Canetti's Seafood 
Grotto ("Same owner since 1949," says the rubber sign in the window.) There's 
no missing Canetti's. It has a sign painted on the building -- and bracketed 
by a brace of smiling fishes -- above the door and a high, free-standing neon 
sign that says Canetti's Seafood Dinners (with the word "Seafood" outlined by 
a fish) and in larger letters, "Breakfast." 
Randazzo, 73, was voluble, but perhaps not available. If he gets a clean 
bill of health from his doc tomorrow (He's got "bum legs. Standin up is what 
gets you.") he's off to Vegas "to roll dice. I was lucky enough to make enough 
money to retire," he says. Since retiring 10 or so years ago, he's gone out 
with his sons, Paul and Louis on the Santa Teresa or the Julie K, who would 
rather he didn't. When I ask him what time the boys go out, he says they don't 
like to say when pop's around because they're afraid he'll join them. "They 
tell me, 
'Stay home.' I say, 
'Why? Do you think I'm gonna fall overboard.
," He 
tells them to let him take the wheel so they can get some rest. His grandson, 
also named Joe, also pesters his sons to go out fishing. The elder Joe tells 
him, "You're getting this too much in your blood," and urges him to follow his 
other grandfather into "big business" and to go fishing only to get "fresh 
air." once, he asked Joey if he was seasick. When the boy said he wasn't, 
Granddad said, "Good boy. You're a fisherman. But don't be a fisherman." 
of "modern fishermen," he says, "They make me sick. It's not like the 
old days." For example: the Sicilians (Joe, born in St. Louis, but a Pedro 
resident since he was seven or eight years old, is from a Sicilian family), 
Neapolitans and Slays "used to intermingle and get along pretty good. 
Everybody used to like everybody. Now, everybody's jealous." 
Things are more hierarchical now, as well, with Central Americans doing 
all the crewing -- "No more Europeans. The Europeans must've all got rich." 
Then there's technological change. His sons, he says, are good 
fishermen, but they use fish spotters and think "that's 90 percent of the 
battle." Joe disagrees. "When you're good, you're good." 
"It's all one big story," he concludes, and roars off in his silver, 
mag-wheeled, convertible Mustang GT. Mike Taormina, alone now, continues to 
sit in the Chevy.

8 a.m. on the slip. The Nancy L. has just come in, but 
the pit bull on the bridge is off-putting. Across the way, where a crew is 
power-blocking purse seine off the Maria T, looks more promising . The Maria T 
has come in the day before from fishing for mackerel , mainly, but also tuna, 
bonita and squid off Santa Catalina Island. There are seven guys: Captain Vito 
Terzoli , sons Nino and Robert (secreted in the engine room ), a young Ischian, 
and three Salvadorans I think they were. Cap'n Vito, 55, and a fisherman since 
age 7, came over from Palermo in 1964. Nino was 4. Vito's father, also a 
fisherman , was already here. Vito crewed tuna boats for several years before 
he was able to buy (with two partners) his own boat. Three of his brothers are 
boat-owning fishermen . The fourth is a merchant seaman. Maria T, a 64-footer, 
was his first wife, dead 10 years. She (the boat, that is, not the wife) 
recently took six months off for cabin remodeling. Over the galley table hang 
a print of the Last Supper , and a Madonna and Child . On the table are strewn 
crossword books, decks of cards, dominos. Vito says he attends mass at Mary 
Star of the Sea sometimes, not always . He fishes on St. Joseph's day (March 
19), a day when he should be staying home and lighting fires, and never 
catches anything. 
First interview , equipment set up on the net, roar of cars, truck, 
planes, copters , radio, cry of gulls, while the sewing goes on, is with the 
son, Nino, a brawny, sandy-haired, blue-eyed fellow who looks nothing like 
anyone's idea of a Sicilian , as he is the first to admit. He speaks English, 
Italian and enough Spanish to talk to the three Hispanic crewmen. Like our 
friend Emiddio at the A-1 Grocery , he married an Italian girl. Unlike him, he 
felt no imperative to do so and thinks it might have been better not to. 
Italian wives spoil their husbands, he says. Asked what he eats, he said, "My 
wife, she's American ." They eat pork chops, steak -- American food. In Sicily, 
Vito will say later, they only ate meat on Christmas. Until he remarried, he 
says, "If I don't eat pasta once a day , it wasn't a day." Now he's down to 
twice a week . When I ask Nino if there's anything about his house, inside or 
out, that is identifiably Italian, he asks me if I mean things like backyard 
vegetable gardens. "Every Italian that 's got a little patch of dirt grows 
tomatoes , squash . But I don't have a backyard . I have a front yard. I grow 
carnations ." His dad has always grown his own tomatoes and zukes. As for his 
own "Italian-ness," he says, "I don't think you walk into my house and say 
this is typical Dago ... My front porch isn 't painted red." And also : "It's hard 
to hold on to your roots when you're so far away." 
As for the fishing: there 's nothing fun about net fishing , Nino says. 
What's fun is finding the time to throw a hook-and-line over the side, catch, 
say, a rock cod to bring home and eat. The mackerel that get caught in the net 
go to the cannery the fishermen themselves bought a couple of years ago, the 
old Starkist plant on Terminal Island, renamed Un ited Food Packers. While we 
talk, another young fisherman , another Ischian, just back from Alaska, stops 
by. Where's my salmon, Nino asks him. It's got an oil slick on it, the Ischian 
says. "Exxon written all over it." A flurry of Ischia -Sicily rank-outs 
follows. Sicilians, according to the Ischians, are Africans . "We used it (the 
insults ) to burn each other." Dodger coach Joe Amalfitano , apparently, is 
Ischian. And a good thing , too, say the two Ischians. If he were Sicilian, the 
Dodger would never win a game. The Ischians also claim Babe Ruth and Joe 
DiMaggio as their own . Nino counters by claiming Hank Aaron as a Sicilian. 
Second interview is with Vito, white-haired now, once blond. He too, is 
lacing net as we talk . Life in the U.S. he says is "a hundred times better" 
than in Sicily. Life is better on the big tuna boats, but you've got to stay 
out for months at a time . He discouraged his sons "a hundred percent" from 
following him into fishing . What's hard about it, he says, is not the work so 
much, but the uncertainty of it. Better to "work on the beach and be home with 
your kids, your wife every night ." The best fisherman isn't the one who makes 
the most money , he says , because the amount you make is too dependent on luck. 
These are affable guys, but not voluble.

Full moon and no sign of tuna: these are slow days on 
the fishing slip. The fishermen go out nights when the phosphorence of schools 
is clealrly visible, either from the crow's nest or the spotter planes, but 
they're harder to see in the moonlight. And the fishermen like to fish cheap 
mackerel in winter and expensive tuna in summer. Actually, they'd be happy 
fishing tuna all year, but summer is when the tuna appear, only this summer 
they haven't -- yet. The fishermen -- the few hanging around the slip the last 
couple of days -- seem a little edgy. 
While David waited for his friend Gaspar and I went looking for the 
elusive Mr. Taormina we stumbled on each other then on our friend Dominic, 
whom we mutually corraled for an interview alongside the boat he crews for, 
the Sea Queen. Before we begin he talks about the moon ("Right now the moon is 
too big") and about the make-up of the San Pedro fleet. For the most part, he 
says, the Slays have the big purse-seiners, the Italians the smaller boats. 
The Italians could afford to buy big boats too, he assures us, but they don't 
want to stay away from home too move. The wives of the big tuna boat fishermen 
tell their husbands: "I didn't marry the boat; I married you." I think they're 
wrong. A fisherman's wife marries the fisherman and his boat. 
Dominic is another Palermo man. He celebrated his 50th birthday last 
week. When David asks him about the differences between fishing in Sicily and 
San Pedro, Dominic says, "Those days, everything by hand," and launches into a 
litany of all the tasks that had to be done by hand: a nice series of 
repetitions. "Then they got smart," he said, meaning, then they started using 
motors and winches. 
The interview includes detailed descriptions of the division of labor 
among the crew, of how sets are done, of how shares work, of the relationship 
between the fishermen, the cannery and the fresh fish markets. The industry is 
dying, he says: "Less fish, less canneries, less boats, everything less." His 
own son is a realtor. "He doesn't want to even smell the fish. 
What listening to the tape of this interview will not convey, is what a 
performance it was. I asked Dominic at the end if he thought he could talk if 
he were tied up. He didn't think so. Neither do I. He slapped and chopped one 
hand or jabbed one finger against the other palm, used his thumb to point 
behind him or to himself, his index finger to point ahead, described the shape 
of a set and the boat's position relative to it, imitated the motion of the 
sea and of things crashing down on one and performed an endless number of 
variations on the shrug. It's a wonder he didn't knock one of us, who flanked 
him, into the drink.

Mike Taormina is at his usual post behind the wheel of 
his pickup at the far end of the slip, whence he has a commanding view of all 
the moored boats and the rare ones that come in. Tony Barcott is his 
"passenger " this day, he of the late , lamented fishing school next door to the 
Little Fisherman restaurant in the Fishermen's Co-op building . If this project 
were about the Slays , Barcott -- the "Professor " -- would be the place to 
start . 
As it is, he plays the referrer's role. While we chat, John DiMeglio --
checking the spelling of his name I see there are no less than 26 DiMeglios in 
the phone book -- drives up . He's 82 (b. 1907) and assures me he's not smart 
enough or eductaed enough to give me the information I seek, despite my -- and 
Mike's and Tony 's -- protestations to the contrary . He then gives me an earful 
while the two of lean on Mike's truck and gaze, Mike -like up the slip. 
DiMeglio is a native San Pedran. His dad, granddad and great granddad 
were Ischian fishermen , dad coming to the states around 1904 -or-5. He worked 
on the railroad in New York for $1.50 a day before joining his brother on the 
West Coast . In those days, DiMeglio says, there weren't just Italian and 
Yugoslav fishermen , but Dutch , Swedish, Greek, Portuguese and Japanese as 
well. In those days, you could walk across the slip (300 feet wide) on the 
decks of the boats, all small, the big purse seiners didn't come until the 
twenties. He joined the fun at age 12, going to school days and fishing 
nights, and fished, always locally, never on the big tuna boats ("like luxury 
ships" today) until the late sixties-early seventies. "Now I miss it," he 
says, "because there's big money in it." When I remind him that the prevalent 
view is that the industry is dying, he gives a derisive wave of his hand. 
"Three -four-five months you don't make a nickel," he concedes, "but all at 
once you hit it." And he sounds the familir oldtimer theme: that the young 
guys, with all their fancy gear , have it easy . "Today they don't work at all -
- radar, fathometers, sonar." Whereas in his day, "it was a struggle . You had 
to work like a slave. Everything was by hand and if you made 10-15 dollars a 
week you were lucky." Nevertheless, DiMeglio calls it a "clean life," meaning 
"a healthy life. Nevertheless , he discouraged his sons from following the 
fisher's life and they have not, though their "on the beach" jobs are very 
much on the beach. One runs the Little Fisherman restaurant over our left 
shoulders, the other runs the Pioneer Fish Market at the other end of the 
slip. 
As for "Italian-ness," he speaks the language, his sons speak "a 
little." I quote Vito Terzoli on the need for daily pasta, and he responds, 
almost vehemently , that he hasn't eaten pasta in two years. As fort the rest, 
I ought to talk to some othernever-named oldtimers , and even better, I ought 
to talk to the ones that are no longer around. Tough assignment, that. 
Meanwhile , Mike Taormina's 79th birthday was yesterday (putting his 
birthdate at 7/19 /10). He celebrated it "sober" and , you guessed it, behind 
the wheel of his pickup , gazing up the slip. 
Earlier, I stopped by the Maria where a (partial ) crew consisting of the 
Sicilian captain and his son, two other Italians , a Slav and a Guatemalan were 
working on replacing their enginge block. Amid the whirr and bang of drills 
and hammers , it was not a good time to get anyone to talk, but I did take a 
few photos -- another Last Supper in the galley . The cap'n's name is Sal 
Ciaramiatoro. He immigrated in 1964. His son is Pete. The engine's been down a 
week and won 't be ready to go for another week, according to the Yugoslav, who 
concedes that there could be worse times to go down than now, this time of the 
full moon and no fish. Still, he says, "you never know when things will break 
loose." We talk about the weather (blessed cool and breezy in SP, bloody hot 
everywhere else ). SP's a peninsula, he explains, but from 20 miles out it 
looks like an island. If you believe that immigrants tend to want to live in 
places that resemble where they came from, it makes sense that the town is 
full of Ischians and Sicilians. What makes even more sense is San Pedran's 
sense of their town as a place apart from Los Angeles.

My interview with Leonard "Lemons" Taormina takes 
place on a hatch cover aboard the tidy little Coquetta, built incidentally, by 
John DiMeglio and in the Taormina family 40 years. Taormina's white head is 
covered by a blue Dodger cap. He sits leaning forward, forearms on his knees, 
rubbing his hands, not looking at me. He has this idea that the tape is 
supposed to be one continuous stream of him talking and makes a game effort at 
it and seems a little nervous, as if he's let me down whenever he lapses into 
silence and forces me to prod him with a question. 
He's 66 (b. 10/3/23 in San Pedro) and has fished "from knee-high until 
today" -- as deck boss on the big tuna boats, mostly. "Today" however, 
consists of an occasional pleasure fishing cruise with his big brother Mike. 
Near the end of hour-long talk, a young fisherman from Santa Barbara comes by, 
interested in buying the Coquetta. Leonard agrees there's no use in the boat 
laying idle, but says it's Mike's call and Mike, as the young guy points out 
and I have observed, seems to like looking at it. I like looking at it too, 
says Leonard, but he's willing to let it go. Until he does, though, his 
routine is "go to bed early, get up early, go to the coffeeshop to see the 
boys," then putter around on the boat until it's time to eat lunch with his 
buddy Gerrard Fiorentino. "We eat so good all the freeloaders come around to 
eat," says Leonard. Once a week, he starts the boat. Last year, he painted 
"every inch of it." He's a fastidious, non-effusive man, was more relaxed 
talking to the guy from Santa Barbara and may be better served by a tape at 
Fiorentino's shop next week. 
Taormina expresses his scorn for modern fishermen and their gear thus: 
"Nowadays everybody's got a wristwatch and a styrofoam cup."

Then there's Joe Canetti, owner of the institution 
known as Canett's Fish Grotto, where the the fishermen gather and drink their 
coffee. "Fishermen catch more fish in Canetti's than they do in the ocean," 
Joe says proudly. He's a large, expansive man, bursting with Italian pride. 
His father was Italian, he says, "but he was always first an American." Mom 
and Dad, Ischians, ran a grocery store at 16th & Mesa, before moving down to 
the slip and adding the restaurant in 1949. 
Joe's a good source for information on how Italian life has changed over 
the years. The Second World War seems to have been a watershed. Before it, his 
dad made his own wine and kept it in wine cellar. Before the war there was the 
fiesta of San Gian Giuseppe (featuring a greased pole-walking contest), Sunday 
dinners and cards, eel for Christmas Eve. "The real Italian thing," Joe says, 
"-- it was, but it isn't today." Examples follow: The family business used to 
close 1 p.m; Saturday and reopen Monday to allow for church-going and the big 
family thing on Sunday. Now there's too much competition from 7-day-a-week 
businesses to allow for that. Joe blames the decline of some of the home-based 
traditions on the wives' need to work. 
And yet, Italians in SP "are still strong." The community is diffusing 
through out the economy -- doctors, lawyers, dentists, realtors -- but it is 
not dispersing. Two of Joe's own sons work at the restaurant. A third works on 
barges in the port. The family still eats mostaccioli on Sunday, soup on 
Monday, fish on Friday and steak on Saturday. They still have 50 people over 
for Xmas dinner. The food -- seafood and pasta, mainly -- "would blow your 
brains," Joe says. 
Joe also provided such tidbits as: The oldest son is named after the 
father. The most popular names were always John and Joseph. If you yell "Hey, 
Joe," in the restaurant, he says "you'll get five guys to turn around." The 
Slays painted their houses white with blue trim, the Italians white with green 
trim. Italians could call each other Dagos; the Slays did so at their peril. 
In the early days, most of the fishermen were Ischians. In in the sixties, the 
fishing got bad, there were guys who sank their own boats to collect the 
insurance and a wave of Sicilans arrived to take the place of the upward 
mobile Ischians. "You gotta give them credit," Joe says of the Siciliani. 
"Their kids speak Italian first, English second." Also, "they work. They're 
not like the gangsters in New York." Finally, there are Joe's community 
connections. His godmother is a Trani asin Trani's shoe store on 7th St. 
Sandals are made there. John DiMeglio is his uncle. He introduces me to Ben 
Scott, founder of the Italian-American Club, and to his father-in-law, Ralph 
Galante. He points out Joe Cracciola, president of the gill-netters 
association. He reminds me that there's a Saturday morning fish market that's 
open to the public. We'll be there. I've gotta shoot Joe making the day's 
doughnuts at 5 a.m. anyway.

Ben Scott is not an anglicized version of Beniamino 
Scotti. There may not be many Italians in Plentywood, Montana. But Ben Scott 
left Plentywood for San Pedro, met and married Irma Giacopuzzi, and wound up 
organizing the Mazzini Club in 1951 , a picnic, dance and dinner outfit named 
for an Italian patriot . Most of the members, like Irma's family , were northern 
Italians -- Veronesi -- dairymen , mostly, who came over in the 1910s and 20s, 
and operated dairies in the southland until the press of development and the 
demand for dockworkers during the Second World War led many of them to switch 
to longshoring . Scott describes these folks as "large, strong, fun-loving and 
home-loving." They made their own wine, sauerkraut and sausages , butchered 
hogs and goats , raised chickens and grew vegetables. The northern and southern 
Italians , he says, got along fine, but their lives were separate . Unlike the 
southerners , the northerners were more assimilationist in their orientation, 
unless they've just been here longer. In any case , he says, it "would be 
difficult -- except when you go to a wedding or a funeral -- to discover they 
have the ethnic 
background they do. As the bond of ethnicity weakened 
determine, Mazzini Club members drifted off to other civic, social and service 
organizations, and the club stopped meeting altogether about five years ago. 
Scott sees this as a good thing, as a sign that the people feel that they 
belong, that "this is their country." 
on their refrigerator is a magnet with the motto "Eat Italian" over a 
send-up of La Giaconda in chef's hat and neckerchief, knife and fork in hand, 
seated at a checkered tablecloth. Northern cuisine is distinguished from 
southern , Scott says , by an emphasis on meat instead of fish, lighter sauces 
on the pasta , more gnocchi than spaghetti , and the eating of lasagna, polenta 
and tortellini . The oldtimers made grappa , brandied cherries and prunes, 
olives.

No matter how early I get up it never seems early enough for these 
wharf rats. This morning at 5:30 I met Joe Canetti at the cafe to take 
pictures of him making doughnuts. That done, he introduced me to Joe 
Cracciolo, president of the L.A. Commercial Fishermen's Association. He's a 
part-time gillnetter. "It's more like a tradition than an income," he says. 
The income comes from his contracting business. He does not characterize 
himself as a "traditional Italian" because he married a Slavonian. But his 
father and grandfather were Sicilian fishermen. I ask him if he speaks 
Italian. He says, "I speak Sicilian." His sons do not: "You have to have ties 
in Europe to keep the language up." His dad is 82, uncle, 92. I'm meeting them 
later. 
At one time, he says, there were 125 boats in the slip. In the fifties 
there were about 20 Sicilian boats, 40 Ischian boats and 40 Slavonian boats. 
The fleet grew during the war, then saturated the market after the war. The 
dual problems of pollution and over-fishing began cutting the fleet down to 
size. 
As we chat, the center table begins filling up with fishermen, the 
conversation widens. Some of the talk is of the dangers, especially for the 
little gill-netters. "It doesn't take much weather to break a small boat," 
says a man with a wrinkled nose. Boats get run down by the big tubs in the 
shipping lanes: "You just see pieces of debris floating. A wet net on the 
reel. weighing three tons, destabilizes the boat. The best swordfishing is 
during the worst weather. Cracciolo says four or five boats a year are lost. 
The talk turns to politics and the clout of the sport fishing lobby. 
Cracciolo gives the commercial fleet five years, even with the co-op buying 
its own cannery. "The can costs more than the mackerel," he says The fishermen 
get seven cents a pound for the fish while the cannery pays 25 cents for the 
can. Nets cost $10,000 to $15,000. A third of what a boat grosses is poured 
back into boat maintenance. Those who want to keep fishing are forced to move 
around: to fish salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska, herring in San Francisco. Or 
else they moonlight as fishermen while working days on the longshore

rIAW-RF-F072289.B-- 
Present are Salvador (Sam) Cracchiolo, his wife 
Antonia (nee D'Aleo), Sam's brother, Philip and Phil's son, Joe. The interview 
takes place around the dining room table at Sam's and Antonia's house. The 
family is from Terrasini, near Palermo, in Sicily. Fishermen "since the day of 
Christ." Ending with Joe, age 57. The brothers, 10 years apart, both left 
Sicily at the age of 16 and headed for Detroit, where they worked as fruit 
peddlars. A relative visiting from San Pedro told them to go west, "California 
is just like Sicily." Phil came out in 1927, Sam in 1937. 
While we're talking San and Antonia's grandson comes in with his 
Japanese wife and their three kids. They bear two giant squashes (cucutza --
sp.?), which Phil later shoulders like a baseball bat during his tour of 
inspection around Sam's garden. The wife has learned to cook Italian from 
Antonia. Their little girl kisses her grandpa while pinching both his cheeks -
- an Italian kiss, according to Sam, though Antonia doesn't remember such 
kisses from Sicily. The grandson understands some Italian, but doesn't speak 
it and regrets that he doesn't. He's also an engineer who regrets that he 
never fished. 
Sam and Phil take turns recounting the circumstances of their leaving 
Sicily (draft evasion, basically), the voyage over (as fishermen they were the 
only ones on the boat to keep eating during the blows), Ellis Island and the 
train trip to Detroit. Neither had any intention of returning to Sicily. "I 
came here to die here," says Phil. When he came to San Pedro, he says there 
were about 20 Sicilians in town, about 100 Italians. The harbor, he says was 
"fish galore." He and two pals quickly scraped together the dough to buy a 
boat, fished tuna in Mexico, nmackerel locally, the usual thing. On the boat 
they argued about whether the lingua franca should be Italian or English. Phil 
favored English. He retired at 75 (he's 83 now) and still misses fishing. But 
he's not sentimental about the family tradition. Since you can't make a living 
at it anymore, it doesn't make sense for the new generation of men to take it 
up. 
Sam's and Antonia's house has a red porch and wrought iron railings, 
fruit trees (including a Sicilian fig tree) and of course, a tomato and squash 
garden.

Trying to line up a fishing trip I run into Joe 
Cracchiolo on board the Linda C., replacing rotted out railing before he goes 
shark fishing in a few weeks time. He brings me to Canetti's and introduces me 
to Tilio Gioiello, skipper of the Sea Star. He's at the double center table 
with Jack Russo, Sal Manzella and Angelo LoGrande, skippers and Sicilians all. 
Gioiello is Ischitano.They were all part of the wartime wave. Manzella came in 
1946, LoGrande in 1940, Gioiello in 1949 and Russo in 1938 -- what appears to 
have ben the second of three waves of Italian immigration to San Pedro, the 
first in the 1910s and 1920s, the second in the 30s and 40s and the third in 
the 50s and 60s. Or has it been a continuous trickle? 
The more recent arrivals do not seem to be proud-to-be-American 
immigrants. These guys have watched the fishing fleet decline while seeing 
Italy recover. "Now it's America there," LoGrande says. Unlike the recent 
arrivals, who have done well, moved up, literally and economically from the 
fishing slip, and would never go back to Italy, Sal Manzella says he would "go 
back to Italy tomorrow" if not for his American wife and his American family. 
"First guy that comes along," says LoGrande, "for half the money the boat is 
worth, I give it to him." But nobody wants it. They complain about Fish & Game 
ever-increasing the size of the gill-net mesh. When that happens, Manzella 
says, miming taking a bill out of his wallet and throwing it away, "a $10,000 
net, I got to take it out and throw it away." They complain of the sport 
fishermen, of the gill-neters getting blamed for the depradation of all manner 
of marine populations, of their wives having to work. "They say fishermen are 
making money," Manzella say. "Where? Fishermen are making money maybe one day 
a week." They're glad for the crew of the Sea Scout that caught the 100-year 
tuna, but regret that such a catch reinforces the idea that the fishermen have 
nothing to kick about. "We try to work," they say. "We not lazy to work." 
Then it gets worse. Russo's son, 35, and grandson, 13, were lost at sea, 
along with two other fishermen last year. He doesn't want to talk about it. 
But he talks about it.

Sunday afternoon on the slip. I hear boats are going 
out, but things seem quiet. I notice for-sale signs on two of the boats, a pit 
bull lounging on the bows of a third, a Bristol Bay, Alaska decal on a fourth, 
guano-streaked skiffs on them all. At the far end of the slip is a monument, 
"Dedicated in Memory of All Fishermen" and humble in the extreme, erected by 
the Women's Auxiliary of the Fishermen's Cooperative Association in 1963. 
Walking back up the other side of the slip, I see action. Anna Maria II 
is getting ready to fish. I take pictures of Paolo DiGirolamo, 34, Francesco 
Cosnetino, 58 and Giuseppe Cracchiolo, 25, all three of whom came from Sicily 
in 1974. When they make Mafia jokes I ask them if it bugs them that people 
assume all Sicilains are Mafiosi. "It don't bother us because we do right 
living," one says. I also ask them if they're sorry they came. The boats, they 
say, are better than the boats here: they're newer. Anna Maria is 50 years old 
and made of wood. The boats in Sicilia are made of steel and there are no 
cockroaches in the kitchen. Anna Maria has a crew of seven Italians and one 
Guatemalan, which, for our purposes, makes it a pretty good candidate for a 
fishing trip. "Maybe we see you tomorrow," one of the crew says as they cast 
off the lines. "Bring you some fish." "Catch some, " I say. "Good luck," says 
Giuseppe. "You need the luck," I say. 
The Santa Teresa is also getting ready. This is the Randazzo boys' boat 
-- Paul and Louis. "My uncle and dad taught everybody to fish here. 
Everybody," says Louie. Uncle Sam, owner of the Nonna Maria II and getting 
ready to go fishing himself, stops by to chat. He's a dapper fellow in 
designer sunglasses, a gold braided baseball cap and a red neckerchief. 
"Fishing'll pick up next month," says Sam. "Water'll be colder." Paul in a 
"Death from Above -- Fish Assassin" cap invites me aboard, offers coffee and a 
ham sandwich. There's a wooden cross in the foc'sle next to a small wooden 
shrine with a likeness of the Virgin in it and a small card with a picture of 
a saint and the motto "St. Jude pray for us." In the galley, "The Last Supper" 
hangs over the table. And in the wheelhouse there's a wooden statuette of the 
Virgin with a beheaded baby Jesus on her shoulder next to a box of explosives 
used to scare seals and otters.

Nothing doing at the cannery on Terminal Island, Ken 
and I head back to the fishing slip for breakfast at Canetti's where we run 
into Joe Cracchiolo and Liberato "Libby" DiBernardo. Libby mentions a fishing 
ground known as "Dago Bank," and talks of his father Ferdinando of the Santa 
Maria who went back and forth between San Pedro and Ischia, getting his wife 
pregnant each time. Built in 1937 and now skippered by Libby's brother 
Carmine, the Santa Maria is the only boat on the slip still in the same 
family. "We spoke Italian on the boat and we spoke Italian at home," Libby 
says. "We speak southern Italian: Ischitan . Okie Dago." 
From Canetti 's we go to the fishmarkets -- the 40 thieves as they're 
known to the fishermen . At Pioneer I borrow old family photos from Joe 
DiMeglio , Jr., a babyfaced , cigar-chomping guy who has the Wall Street Journal 
on his desk and says, challengingly , "We were brought up American ." An oil 
painting in his office shows a fishing boat being pulled up on the beach by 
oxen 
Then it's on to Ocean Fish Co. for a visit with Stanley DiMeglio, no 
relation to Joe, two doors down. The upstairs conference room at Stan's is a 
miniature nautical museum, including such items as a stack of canned fish, 
Ischian coin trays, ships -in-bottles , a binnacle, a shuip's wheel and some 
panoramic photos of the waterfront. Stan's dad built a business selling wine 
grapes and presses to the Italians. "Everybody made wine here, everybody," 
Stan says . He makes an appointment for me at the home of Anita Basich, nee 
Ardino. Another Ischian, he makes Sicilian jokes: "We say they're Sicilians, 
not Italians," and, "When the Lord made the Massina Straits (which separate 
Sicily from the mainland) he should've pumped in more water and swamped the 
island." For the most part, he says, the Italians lived on Vinegar Hill, so 
named because the Italians would take the pulp left over from grape crushing 
and sprinkle it on their gardens. While we chat the St. Katherine pulls in and 
begins unloading 50 or 60 tons of mackerel. Immediately, the pelicans and the 
oldtimers appear -- the Taormina brothers, Barcott. "The oldtimers come to get 
fre fish," DiMeglio says. "We never refuse 'em." A large power-block operated 
scoop net is used to dump the fish into bins which are winched onto the dock. 
Eventually, they'll switch over to a suction pump like the one used at the 
cannery. 
While we're out on the balcony, Barcott says to me, "I know it's the 
oldest family in San Pedro, but keep away from that guy." DiMeglio spots 
Isidoro Amalfitanoskipper of the Sea Scout, and invites him to chat. 
Amalfitano came to the U.S. in 1966 from Ischia. When I ask hiim how far back 
fishing goes in his family he says, "Generation by generation by generation, 
we pass it on." His grandmother used to go on the beach and help the guys pull 
the boat on the shore. "When I was six years old," he says, "I had to go to 
fish to help my father. I had to be on the boat. I had to sleep on the boat. 
School was the second thing. The first thing was to support the family." 
Amalfitano, short, curly-haired, handsome and powerful-looking, tells 
his story of jumping ship in New Jersey, meeting his wife-to -be while he 
worked at his uncle's restaurant in Poughkeepsie, getting caught by 
immigration after 17 days and being refused by his wife's father when he 
sought to marry her before being deported back to Ischia. After a year-and-a-
half of letter-writing, his wife's family brought her back to Ischia for the 
wedding. Of his return to the states he says, "Thank God -- I kiss the ground. 
Both Stan and Isidoro talk about their fathers, how "one look" was all 
it took. Their fathers never hit their kids. They also talk about how eine was 
always on the table and how kids were introduced to wine via pieces of bread 
that were dipped into it. 
"I'm an American," Isidoro says again. "Thank God I'm in a place where I 
can eat a piece of bread." 
When Isidoro leaves -- I arrange to see him that evening -- Stan and I 
go back out on the balcony. St. Katherine's catch are jack mackerels, he tells 
me, also known as Spanish mackerel. "These fish don't have a chance," he says. 
"Nylon net , power block , spotter plane... It's a hard life but a good life. 
You're free . You're self-contained ." Znd he ends with a joke about all the

ways the fishermen find to evade the regulations : "The priest says, 
'How come 
you don't go to confession ?' And the fisherman says, 'If I confess to you 
you'd go into the fishing business."'

Anita Basich's claim to fame is that her grandparents, 
Giovanni and Angiolina Carrese were the first Italians to settle in this part 
of the world, coming first to Wilmington in 1880. This is confirmed by a 
commemorative booklet put out in 1949 to mark the 60th anniversary of Mary 
Star of the Sea Church. Anita's mother, Brigit Carrese was Stan DiMeglio's 
grandmother. Her father was Joe Ardina, who worked in the coal mines of 
Colorado and the lumberyards of San Pedro before he began selling wine grapes 
to the Italians. This business was carried on by Stan DiMeglio's father. A lot 
of the wine-making, Anita says, went on during the full moon in the fall when 
it was too bright to see the fish. 
When she was growing up, she says, "people visited more. For the Italian 
people the main thing always on Sunday was spaghetti and meatballs and also 
eggplant parmesan." The last Sunday in August they celebrated the fiesta of 
San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce, which included a week-long carnival that 
concluded with fireworks. In Ischia, the story is told, the statue of San 
Giovan Giuseppe was brought out during a storm and the sea was calmed. 
Christmas Eve was, and still is, a fish and seafood dinner. Christenings 
featured acordion music and tarantella dancing. dinner. The Fishermen's Fiesta 
featured a parade of flag-bedecked boats. She has film footage of it. 
I ask her about being a fisherman's wife -- she married a Slav, John 
Bacich. "I used to dread to see him go," she says, "just dread it." Her son 
would get sick. "My husband never encouraged him to be a fisherman because 
that's a hard life." Instead, he's a microbiologist living in Glendale. "I'm 
just a full American," Anita says. "I was born here and I love this country."

DiBernardo Realty is a family business . 
Working the 
phones in an office dominated by pictures of the family fishing boat, the 
Santa Maria , are brothers Louie and Libby, Libby 's son Fred and brother 
Carmine's son Mark. Looking down from the backwall is the patriarch, 
Ferdinando , age 91. This is another Ischian family. The grandfather worked in 
the coral trade on sailing ships to Africa . Ferdinando came to the states in 
1915 at age 17 having heard that San Pedro harbor "was a great fishing 
village." In those early days the fishing was with lampara nets. In 1920, 
Ferdinando was married back in Italy and then began several years of 
transoceanic commuter conjugality . Finally, it occurred to the old man that he 
was giving all his money to the train and steamship companies and so in 1937 -
- 22 years after he first came to the states -- he brought the family back 
with him. Today there are 225 members of the DiBernardo extended family in San 
Pedro. 
Libby started fishing at age 13: "You wanted to do what your dad did." 
During World War II , he says, "you could walk on the fish out there ." The glow 
of fish in the ocean at night "looked like a lit-up city." His father couldn't 
fish because he wasn't a citizen . His sister worked at one of the canneries. 
Libby quit fishing in 1964 and became a realtor . The pattern held when his son 
followed him into real estate. Libby married an Irish girl, his son a 
Yugoslay. Their office is a half a block from the house Libby grew up in. 
Above Gaffey St. back then was "all rabbit hunting." It was also where the 
fishermen spread out their cotton nets for tarring . The Italian fleet "liked 
to stay close to home and see mama everyday." 
Like Joe Canetti 's household , the DiBernardos ate certain foods on 
certain days of the week: soup on Saturdays , mostacchioli on Sunday ("That was 
automatic "), pasta fazoul on Mondays . The family made its own tomato sauce, 
ravioli, gnocchi , baked its own bread, raised rabbits , chickens and ducks. On 
San Giovan Giuseppe 's day they 
donated to the fiesta in Ischia. The 
fishermen 's fiesta started in 1946, "fishing 's heyday." The statue of the 
Blessed Virgin would be carried down to the docks for the blessing of the 
fleet. During a dryspell , the priest would be called on to bless the boat. His 
mother used to burn incense and recite prayers to rid the house of the evil 
eye. On another saint's day -- Libby can 't recall whose -- the family would 
leave a pot of water with flowers in it outside overnight and wash their faces 
in the water the following morning. There were saints for different parts of 
the body: St . Blaise for the throat , St. Lucia for the eyes. 
After the interview , brother Carmine , skipper of the Santa Maria, stops 
by. I ask if Libby ever comes out fishing anymore . "Now and then," Carmine 
says . "When he comes he puts his boots on. He comes to work." As for his son 
Mark, "I wanted something better for him.

After supper at Isidoro Amalfitano 's house. We sit at 
the dining room table , his kids three of his four kids and a couple of nephews 
from New York listening in. His wife brings us espressos . Isidoro, skipper of 
the SeaScout , is Ischian , 49 years old . He came to the states in 1964, jumping 
ship and meeting his bride to be before being nailed by immigration and 
deported back to Italy . When he returned he tried working construction in 
Poughkeepsie , where his wife's family settled, but "being a fisherman, you 
can't get away . Once you're a fisherman you're a fisherman for life." In 
Italy, he says the saying is that you have "saltwater in your veins ." "You can 
never take a fisherman out of the water," says his wife, Rose. "It's like 
trying to take a fish out of the water." Isidoro's uncle Frank (Dodger coach 
Joe's father ) skippered the City of Naples, now called the Santa Teresa, the 
Randazzo brothers ' boat. Isidoro talks of how hard it was for his family 
during the fishermen's six-month strike for better prices in 1967. "Work is no 
shame ," he says. And in Italian : "Work makes the man noble." English: "Pride 
doesn't fill up your stomach." 
On raising the kids Italian: "We like them to be Italian. We like them 
to be proud of what they are." His oldest son is named after his father, as is 
customary . His youngest son is named Antonio as per a promise he made to St. 
Anthony when he was sick with colitis. The older kids are still living with 
the family : "We don't believe children should leave home if they're not 
married. That 's the Italian way." He talks about how hard it is not to spoil 
children in this land of plenty. 
Other Italian family traditions : building a nativity scene for 
Christmas . Christmas eve dinner consists of lobster , crab, clams, crab salad, 
shrimp, spaghetti, calamari , bacalao and octopus. On Easter they bless the 
boat with a palm picked on Palm Sunday. 
Dining room decor includes a picture of a sailor at a ship's wheel with 
Christ's guiding hand on his shoulder and a ship 's wheel clock . They have 
tapes of Neapolitan music and play one, for my listening pleasure. I try 
coaxing a song out Isidoro and almost get one out of Antonio , but they chicken 
out. When I leave I push my chair under the table and am told that this isn't 
done in Italy: it means you 're not coming back.

Interview with Frank Iacono while waiting for the 
Vittorio to come in at United Food Processing, the cannery bought a couple of 
years back by the Fishermen's Co-op, whose membership roster, boat and 
skipper, looks like this: Anna Maria II, Jim D'Amato; Astronaut, Mike Trama; 
Aggressor, Anthony Tipich; Donna B, James Bunn; Ferrigno Boy, Joe Ferrigno; G. 
Nazzereno, Salvatore Russo; Laurie Ann, Anton Stanojevich; Margaret F, Antonio 
Ingrande; Maria, Sal Ciaramitaro; Maria T, Vito Terzoli; Mauritania, Nick 
Mosich; Nancy Jean, Mario Carollo; St. Restituta II, Nino Palma; St. George 
II, Frank Vuoso; Sea Queen, Vincent Porpora; Sea Scout, George Pisano; Tootur, 
Sam Russo; Vittorio, Peter Fiore; Bimbo, Tony Marinkovich; St. Joseph, Joe 
Terzoli. 
Iacono, former g.m. of the Co-op is now v.p. of the cannery. Unlike 
other Ischians, he is not from a fishing family. His grandfather was a tailor 
and led the island's orchestra. His father came over in 1911 and worked in San 
Pedro's lumberyards before becoming a fruit peddlar. Mom worked in a cannery. 
Dad was a pianist. Frank played violin, clarinet and piano, but no longer. He 
started fishing before the war, bought his own boat after it, introduced the 
first nylon net in SP. 
His wife's Slavonian, has three kids. The oldest boy understands 
Italian, works in an automotive shop, didn't like fishing. The youngest boy 
works as an air spotter, crashed on Catalina Island, was missing 17 hours, now 
in real estate. 
The height of the fishing, says Frank, was 1947. There were 300 boats 
during sardine season. During the Fishermen's Fiesta the boats were decorated 
in 
crepe flowers and each family was assigned to bring a certain food. 
Co-op history. The co-op was started in 1927, by Slays mostly. The 
Italians had the Italian Federated Boat Owners. The two groups merged in 1947. 
The co-op acted as a bargaining agent with the canneries, of which there 25 at 
one time. The co-op building was dedicated in 1937. The co-op bought the 
Starkist cannery in 1987. If it had closed, Frank says, "it would have been 
the death blow to the fleet." Sardines began declining in the mid-50s; Frank 
hung on until 1979. He doesn't miss it. "If I see the breakwater I close my 
shades." But now he says there aremore sardines than there were before. When 
he tells me that the fleet, including the boats in Fish Harbor on Terminal 
Island numbers 35 seiners and 50 gillnetters, I realize that the count I'm 
usually given (by purse seiners) includes seiners only. The gillnetters don't 
even count. 
At interview's end we go down to wait for the Vittorio. The cannery 
workers, Hispanic, mostly, wear white hard hats and eat snacks bought from a 
catering truck while waiting for the boat to come in. The ground is littered 
with bits of sea urchin. A fat, green, pulsating vaccuum tube sucks the fish 
out of the hold. As they ride up the chute under the eyes of a couple of Fish 
& Game inspectors, Frank pulls three fish out to show me the different 
species: sardines, jack r Spanish mackerel and Pacific mackerel. The Fish & 
Gamers put samples in plastic bags. The Vittorio's load is 10 tons. Frank 
calls the St. George, due in at 11 a.m., and arranges for Ken and me to go 
fishing.

Crew of the St. George: Gaspar Russo, Sicilian, came 
to the states 1948, born 1929; Joseph Giacolone, chief engineer, born in San 
Diego in 1927; Mario Scotto, the cook, born in Naples in 1942, came to the 
states (jumping ship in Long Beach) in 1968; Chris Pisano, born in SP in 1963 
to Ischian parents; Ciro Lauro, born in Ischia in 1935, came to the states in 
1960; Giuseppe LoGrande, born in Sicily in 1946, came to the states in 1969; 
Oscar Aramburo, born in Mazatlan in 1956, the only non-Italian in the crew. 
Also along for the ride is Mario's son Paolo, age 15. A future fisherman? "No 
way," says Mario. "He's gonna be a doctor." 
I wonder at these guys going fishing again at 3 after coming in at 11. 
What about sleep. "You sleep when you're not sleepy, you eat when you're not 
hungry," says Giacolone. While Russo and Lauro mend net, I chat with Chris, 
the youngest member of the crew. He began fishing after school and during the 
summer at age 10. "It's just in the blood," he says. "Once it gets in the 
family, that's it." He'll take bad weather on the ocean over fighting traffic 
and wearing a tie any day. His mom told him fishing was a bad life, taking you 
away from your family all the time. His dad said, do what you want. "First it 
was fun. Now I got a family. I got to do it to catch fish. Now it's do or die. 
Still, a lot of it is for joy." Indicating Russo and Lauro at the nets he 
says, "These guys are the pros. These guys are the masters who've been here 
forever. They know everything inside out." 
Lauro describes Ischia as "a beautiful island." LoGrande says he's been 
fishing since he was born. And advises me to be loose to fend off seasickness. 
"We are the real Italians," says Giacolone. "We're Sicilians." 
No sooner do we cast off and glide out the slip than Mario starts on his 
salad for dinner and Ciro carves a yellowtail caught the night before. Joe 
sets up the barbecue on the hatch cover. In the galley is a plaque with the 
motto, "God Bless Our Floating Home," a wooden crucifix, a print of St. George 
slaying the dragon, an L.A. Dodger wall calendar, and a TV and VCR. As wemotor 
out into the shipping channel, Lauro, LoGrande and Captain Frank sit on the 
bridge, shades and ballcaps on, quietly gazing out. On the bulletin board 
inside the wheelhouse is a print of St. Ciro, a channel buoy guide and a 
Dodgers schedule. Frank, a handsome, softspoken man, tells me his grandfather, 
who had been a cabin boy on squareriggers, was one of the first fishermen in 
San Pedro. One of the windows of the wheelhouse is a stained glass anchor made 
by Mike Vuoso's wife. A third brother works on the Catalina ferry. A brother-
in-law is normally the skiffman, though he is not with us this night. Chris 
will take his place. St. George is the patron saint of Testacchio, the town in 
Ischia the family's from. The boat is 50 years old. I ask Mike about all the 
teasing that goes on between the Ischians and the Sicilians. "Deep down," he 
says, "they know they're Italians and Italians are paisanos." 
The table is set for dinner. Mario has put out a plate of cold cuts and 
cheese, Ritz crackers, and bottles of J&B, Seagrams 7 and Seagrams VO. It's 
cocktail hour. When I say something about how well they treat themselves, Mike 
says, "We spend as much time here as we do at home." As boatowners, he says, 
they take no risks. "Our philosophy is, there's always tomorrow -- which is 
probably why we've lasted so long." At 5:30 he puts the yellowtail steaks on 
the grill and talks about the crew as a big family. It turns out this crew is 
a brand new family: Gaspar and Giuseppe just joined it. "Don't forget the 
garlic," says Gaspar. "What can you eat better than fish? 
Dinner is served: yellowtail, salad, garlic bread, cantelope and a 
German chocolate cake made by somebody's wife. Everyone sits down together, 
but each crewman begins eating as soon as his plate is full. In other words, 
no grace-saying or anything like that. The owners eat with the crew. After 
dinner, most of the crew goes into the foc'sle for naps. While watching the 
Dodger game on TV, Paolo, the future doctor, asks my interview questions for 
me. Says Mike: "You see us barbecuing, watching TV, relaxing and it looks like 
a nice life. But we're not making any money. Sometimes the whole ocean is like 
a big lake. No traffic jams, no freeways, beautiful sunsets. While our 
families are sleeping we're seeing schools of fish that are city blocks big. 
Paolo asks about the differences between fishing for tuna, say, and mackerel. 
Z-Au - 
RP- FO 72s k-1.'3 , 
a 
Mike says tuna are hardest because they're fastest and smartest. "You have to 
use your instincts. You search for birds, you search for bait, you smell the 
air. The hardest thing about catching mackerel is finding them. They don't 
swim fast. Mackerel pays the bills. It's a big ocean, Paolo. You got to go a 
long way to find the fish." 
Dark. Mike points out the Exxon Valdez, lit up like a ballpark. Passing 
in the lea of San Clemente Island, six hours out from Pedro, Mike says, "When 
my dad was alive he said, 
'This is my island. I always catch fish here."' 
The boat slows and the change of rhythm wakes the crew. It's time to 
look for fish. Frank draws the curtains in the galley to keep the fish in the 
dark, then climbs to the crows nest while Mike stations himself on the bridge 
to monitor the sonar and the fathometer. We begin circling. The older guys, 
Gaspar and Ciro, in flannel shirts and ballcaps, chat in Italian. The fish 
register on the sonar visually and sonically as red pinpoints and bip-bip-
bips. Frank tells Mike at the wheel to turn left or right as he shines his 
lantern over the school. Scattered, Mike says again and again. Maybe 10 or 15 
tons. Since this may be as good as it gets, the bell is rung, the skiff is 
launched and the net fans out around the boat. The boat, which had been dark 
is suddenly brilliantly, theatrically lit. Most of the crew, in yellow and 
orange slickers and silver and blue hardhats, is on the stern pulling and 
arranging the net, floats and chains, streaming water, as they come off the 
power block. As the fish become ever more concentrated in the ever-shrinking 
purse, seals appear and take after the escapees. All pursed up, the fish 
sizzle like potatoes in a fryer. The transfer from purse to hold is 
accomplioshed through the agency of a giant butterfly which is scooped by hand 
through the purse, lifted by the block into psition over the hatch, then 
lifted from the back so that the fish are poured out of it. After several such 
scooping operations, Frank announces that the haul has been better than 
expected: 30 tons. Another set like it and we can all go home. All the gear is 
stowed away, the lights are killed and the search for another school resumes. 
Almost immediately, one is found. Off goes the skiff, the net is set, pulled: 
another 30 tons. A good night of fishing. At 2 a.m. Mario fries eggs and 
toasts bread. Chris and Oscar take the first watch, the rest turn in and the 
race begins to beat the other boats back to the cannery.T

Stan DiMeglio takes me on a whirlwind tour of SP, 
pointing out the greatest concentrations of Italians between 9th and 11th 
streets below Pacific, at one point telling me, "This is a cousin, this is a 
cousin, this is a cousin, this is an uncle..." He means "was." The second 
generation, he says, "they elevated themselves, they moved up to the top of 
the hill." On 8th St. between Pacific and Gaffey he says, "I could name every 
family on the block." The area around Mesa and 18th was known as Vinegar Hill 
because teh Italians used to take the pulp leftover from their winemaking an d 
dump it in their gardens. The first Catholic Church was on 9th St. near 
Centre. DiCarlo's Bakery was where the bowling alley is now on 8th. The area 
around 3rd St. and Bellmarin was inahbited by northern Italians. 
B.A.B., I 
learn, stood for Bare Ass Beach on Terminal Island. His mother was born at 
Mesa and 6th. The City Fish Market was at 631 Mesa. 
His own house has been in the family since 1922. Stan maintains his 
mother's porcelain collection and her bedroom. He talks about her cooking, 
thus: "Mom used to fry steaks until Dad threw the frying pan out the window," 
saying, "'Now we're going to learn to cook."' Later, his father would say the 
best restaurant in town is 784 11th St. The house still has the old fashioned 
cellar doors.

says, "They played pinochle 40-50 years ago. Now, no more. The young guys 
don't take after the old people." 
On a picture of the Los Angeles Wholesale Fish Market: "The fish used to 
be loaded on streetcars." 
On Mannino's Restaurant: "That's the way my own mother cooked years ago.

Stan DiMeglio calls to tell me I kept him up until 
11:30 the night before rummaging through cartons of photos in his cellar, so 
naturally I dash over to see what he's come up with. Good stuff: turn of the 
century portraits of Pedro's first Italian families, many wedding pictures, 
DiCarlo Bakery's wagon. Stan starts haphazardly identifying who's who, but 
both of us quickly see that a more systematic approach is called for so he 
calls upon his office manager, Lucy DiLeva, herself from an old Italian 
family, and Anita Basich, to help. The three don't always agree on the 
identities of those pictured, but they arrive at a consensus on most of them 
and provide character references on some. Anita swears that Stan has her 
pictures.

Ferdinando DiBernardo's 91st birthday party. Libby 
greets us at the door and says something like, "You gotta see this. There's 
rabbits, chickens, birds." There are. The house is actually a "family 
compound" of three houses and two outbuildings, with virtually every inch of 
ground planted with vegetables or fruit trees. Italians hate grass, says 
Libby. One of the outbuildings is full of birdcages which are full of birds, 
parakeets, mainly. These are the hobby of Ferdinando's youngest son Fred, the 
lawyer, whom Ferdinando calls a bacalao -- salted codfish, meaning, 
apparently, a crazy person. A portion of the building is a workshop, but is 
also where a wine cask is stored. The other outbuilding, where tables are set 
up for the barbecued shrimp and swordfish to come, is decorated with about 25 
plaques awarded to Fred by some bird fanciers' society. The brass ship's wheel 
over the fireplace is the original wheel from the Santa Maria. There are about 
50 people at the party -- not bad considering it was only planned two days 
before. Libby, keenly aware that we are his responsibility, loads up plates of 
swordfish, shrimp and fried eggplant, so what we mainly do for the hour we're 
there, is eat.

7:30 a.m. at Canetti's. While Ken sets up for his 
photo of the fishermen's table, I jot down a few details of restaurant decor: 
1890-vintage pix of the waterfront; circa 1930 block-and-tackle mounted on a 
board and inscribed "To a Great Guy - Joe Canetti"; a ship-in-bottle and a 
square-rigged ship model on shelves; oil paintings of fishing boats; war bond 
posters; a poster of the varieties of fish to be found off the coast of 
California... While Ken works, Joe circulates, refilling coffee cups. His 
daughter Jan waits tables.
