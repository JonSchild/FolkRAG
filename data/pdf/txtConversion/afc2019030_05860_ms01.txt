LG: 
Okay, today is February 13th, 2020; this is Lisa Gabbert, and this is part of the Physician 
Oral History Project, for the Library of Congress. And today I am interviewing Dr. Karen 
Zempolich, here in her office in Salt Lake City.  
 
 
 
And first of all, you know you’re being recorded, and I have permission to record this 
interview? 
 
KZ: 
You certainly do.

LG: 
Okay. Could you state your name, specialty, and title, and also your birth year, for the 
record? 
 
KZ: 
So, my name is Karen Zempolich; I am a physician (an MD), and my specialty is 
Gynecologic Oncology. And I was born in 1967. 
 
LG: 
Okay, thank you very much. 
 
 
 
 
So, to open the interview, can you just tell me a little bit about where you grew up and 
how you eventually decided to become a doctor? 
 
KZ: 
I grew up in Maryland, in a suburb of Washington, DC. And I would say pretty middle-
class kind of upbringing, with no physicians in the family on either side of my father and 
mother’s family. My dad’s an engineer and worked for the Department of Navy and did 
things with the F-14 fighter planes. So, I was pretty familiar with that world of 
engineering, but was always drawn to life sciences, I suppose (that and politics) – 
growing up outside of DC it was kind of a mix. 
 
 
And I think my first initial thought is I might meld those two things, like maybe go into 
something that’s medicine, but with a public policy —  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
KZ: 
Angle at it, I guess – from that hook of being kind of in DC, and working in Congress at 
times.  
 
 
So, when I went away to school from Maryland, I went to North Carolina (Duke 
University), and they had a – well it was pretty new at the time – a School of Public 
Policy, as well as kind of an early access to medical school program that I got hooked in 
with actually, pretty early on, I think freshman year. So, they had an ability to apply for 
early admission, which was really –  
 
LG: 
Oh, nice.  
 
KZ: 
Really great, that I was fortunate to get, because their goal was to try to have people that 
go into medicine, that weren’t so locked into just trying to get into med school. So, they 
wanted to be able to say early on in your undergraduate timeframe – do some other things 
besides medicine that will make you a little bit more rounded, or keep you rounded (if 
you were already rounded).  
 
 
So, I did a lot of public policy and work in Congress, as well as all of the medical school 
pre-medical training things. And that was really quite broad.  
 
[02:47] 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 3 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And including my fall back to medicine was going to be marine biology, and Duke has a 
great marine biology lab out on the Outer Banks. So, that was also my summers.  
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
KZ: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
So, you entered college already knowing public policy and medicine were sort of the 
areas that you were interested in? 
 
KZ: 
I was interested in medicine pretty early on. Mostly, I was interested in biology and how 
things worked. And probably senior year of high school I started thinking, “Well I want 
to fix things that aren’t working.” So, it was pretty (in humans) – so, it kind of morphed 
pretty quickly; not throughout all of high school, but especially once I got to college. It 
just opened up different classes and ways of looking at kind of the mechanisms of the 
biologic processes.  
 
 
And I was also a piano player, and I got interested in – I thought maybe I’d go into 
orthopedics, because I just was fascinated with what hands do, and to be able to replace 
and fix what hands do, that are compromised, I thought would be an amazing skill and 
gift: to put people back into capacity in that way. So, that’s kind of what drew me in, was 
replacing function that was lost initially. 
 
LG: 
Hmm, interesting. 
 
KZ: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
So, can you tell the story of getting into medical school? You went to Duke, right? 
 
KZ: 
I went to Duke. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
KZ: 
So, they had an early identification program that you applied for in freshman year in 
college. And that was specifically for Duke’s med school. So, I applied for that, and that 
was fabulous because then I could do all these other things besides science things, and 
spent time abroad, playing the French Horn with the Duke University symphony (junior 
year). But then I matriculated at Duke for medical school.  
 
 
So, getting in was a little different than I think for most folks, in that I went through that 
in freshman year of college, through this sort of novel program that they were exploring, 
about how to keep the human and the humanity in medicine. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 4 
 
KZ: 
Which I think we should have a lot more of those programs, because it was pretty 
liberating. But then when senior year rolled around, I was already in; and Duke had a 
great program, so I just –  
 
LG: 
That makes sense –  
 
KZ: 
Went there. 
 
LG: 
Because I think Duke has that narrative medicine program, if I remember; I think that’s 
out of Duke, maybe.  
 
KZ: 
I think they do; I haven’t kept up with that so much. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
[05:21] 
 
 
So, can you talk then about (for people who don’t know) what was medical school like at 
Duke? What year did you enter? 
 
KZ: 
So, I entered medical school in ’89, and graduated in ’93. And that was – well Duke is a 
little unique in medical schools (at least at the time, I can’t really say now). But typically, 
med schools are two years of book learning, and two years of clinical rotations, which 
span the whole spectrum of the different types of medicine. So, different surgical 
specialties and sub-specialties, and in general medicine and pediatrics – you rotate 
through all of those in your last two years.  
 
 
But at Duke what they did (and still do) is they sort of took out the minute details of 
things that are more academic than applicable, and squeezed all of the book learning into 
one year, and then put you into patient care the second year. Then you did a research year 
for a year, and then you went back to clinical care.  
 
 
And that was great, because you went to (hopefully, I think, for most people) go to med 
school to start taking care of patients. So, you got to that earlier. But the first year was 
kind of the classic phrase, probably everywhere (at least in medicine), was it’s like 
drinking from a firehose: there was so much all the time, all day long, with very little 
break for the book part.  
 
 
But it engendered a lot of comradery, lots of – this is before things could get videotaped 
or recorded in easy ways. So, you had a system of people that would take notes for that, 
and then distribute it, and you’d pay in some money. And it was your turn to take notes 
on this day, in case you did miss it.  
 
 
Probably my best friends now are from med school, from my previous timeframe, in my 
learning years, and groups of people.  
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 5 
 
 
But that was things that you’re kind of used to slogging through for medicine. I mean, to 
get into medical school is working hard on the academic side. The unknown was getting 
to the patient care. And they started –  
 
[07:39] 
 
 
At Duke, one thing that I really liked that I would love to see better-replicated other 
places is even when we were doing book work, they had us follow with sort of senior 
residents that are finished with medical school and that are in their own specialties, 
training to learn what they call the art of medicine.  
 
 
And we would just watch them interview a patient, and then we’d talk about how did that 
go, and you know, what did we learn? What could I have done better? And, “Did you see 
how I didn’t sit on their bed, because that’s their space.”  
 
 
And it was a really great way to get exposed to how do you conduct yourself as a 
physician, without having any responsibility for the care of the patient, in terms of the 
medical things. And that was sprinkled through first year.  
 
 
But second year was then sort of, again, the drinking from the fire hose. It was kind of 
every third night on-call, and lots and lots of hours. It was before work hour restrictions 
were in place for physicians and training physicians. 
 
LG: 
Can you describe one of those typical days? 
 
KZ: 
Oh. 
 
LG: 
For people who might not know what that is? 
 
KZ: 
So, I would say for my medical school time, half of it was at the Duke Hospital, and half 
was at Duke’s VA Hospital that was across the street. And the VA hospital – when 
you’re on internal medicine, the general medicine – you took every admission that came 
in, which might be ten new patients in that 24-hour period. You’d be up all night trying to 
fix multiple things about those ten new patients.  
 
 
And then you’d stay throughout the whole next day. So, typically you’d work for about 
36 hours straight, trying to read up on things, because you were going to get grilled by 
the people that were training you, as to what you knew about these things.  
 
 
So, after being up for countless hours and pretty much the whole night, then you’d have 
to be able to stand by the bedside and say, “This is Mrs. So, and So,” (or mister at the 
VA, at the time). And this is what they presented with. And you might have to be able to 
produce four different things that could be going on for this one thing, and that one thing.  
 
[09:53] 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 6 
 
 
And at least at the time, we had to have it all memorized, so that you could demonstrate 
that you really understood each of those ten patients that you admitted all through the 
night, and had thought about what needed to happen to them (in terms of their work-up).  
 
 
And depending on the hospital situation at the VA, the med students were also drawing 
all the labs in the middle of the night, and running after EKG machines – there was one 
for three floors that you’d have to figure out where that was if there was a code. It was 
just absolute chaos.  
 
 
But I learned probably the most. I knew I needed to know my stuff. And it’s such a hard 
balance. You know, since that time, there’s a softer approach, which I think is completely 
needed.  
 
 
But somewhere in between completely overstretched, and completely underchallenged is 
this wonderful middle ground of feeling the onus of, “I need to know what I’m learning, 
and really work towards it.” And that’s a hard balance to create – both in the training 
environment –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
On both sides of things. But it was crazy. So, that was med school for me. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk – one of the famous things about med school, for the public (of course), is 
the gross anatomy class.  
 
KZ: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? Your memories of that? 
 
KZ: 
Yes. I was quite nervous, because I’d never seen (actually) any dead bodies. And since I 
wasn’t in clinical medicine in that first year, I hadn’t touched really any patients, either. 
But I had a good friend that happened to be – since I’m at the end of the alphabet, so it 
was he and Tim, and I, and a couple others were in a group.  
 
[11:49] 
 
 
And I remember being outside the entry to the gross anatomy lab, and everybody just sort 
of bustling. I mean, this is a very (in general) capable, pretty confident group of people, 
but everybody was like, [mumbling] “Oh, I don’t know what this is going to be like.” It 
was kind of funny to see basically everybody sort of taken down a peg. They didn’t know 
how it was going to be. I remember that very clearly.  
 
 
You know, it’s a surreal thing, because now you’re using scalpels to cut into tissue that 
isn’t living. There’s a formaldehyde smell that just never quite gets off your hands, even 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 7 
though you’ve got double gloves. I can’t quite understand why that’s the case. And 
you’re trying to adjust to that. 
 
 
And I remember the first day, my friend Tim, and I – it was highly stressful (the whole 
thing), but we got through it. And he goes, “You know what? I know this is terrible, but I 
really think we should go down to Sizzler and get some steaks.” 
 
[Laughing] 
 
 
And I was like, “I think you’re right.” So, we went out and we were eating, and he said, 
“That seems kind of weird.” And I said, “No, I think it’s okay.” 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
It’s sort of a rebound, like, “No, we need to go do something normal.” At least at the 
time, that was normal for us to –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. Like we did it and it’s okay. 
 
KZ: 
It’s okay; we did this, it’s very surreal, it’s a sobering event – but we can put that aside 
and go have a beer and some steaks. And it did feel a little weird to cut the steaks, I have 
to say. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
KZ: 
I’ll never forget those steaks.  
 
LG: 
Did it get easier as you moved through the class? 
 
KZ: 
Yeah. I think – yes. I would say it’s not so daunting, I think it’s just that first – for me. 
They did a good job – the teachers – of saying things that helped you put in perspective, 
like you know, “This is a privilege; you know, these people gave their bodies for this, for 
you to learn.” And that was really emphasized.  
 
 
And I’m sure part of that is (and I know part of it is) to emphasize to the medical students 
that it is, it’s a privilege to learn on a human body like this. But also, I think it granted 
permission to feel okay with it, you know? Like it was a gift these people gave, and as 
long as we were respectful of it and acknowledged that, that’s what we should do.  
 
 
And it’s pretty quickly moved to that for me. I don’t know. 
 
[14:24] 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
KZ: 
That’s how I put it together, anyway. 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 8 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
 
So, what was the most challenging thing, do you think, about medical school? Or one of 
the most challenging things? 
 
KZ: 
Well it’s an interesting time that you don’t have (responsibility) – mostly you’re not the 
one making hard decisions. I think there’s an occasion where that might come up, but I 
don’t remember that. I remember starting to feel like I was responsible for important first 
steps of gathering data, and reporting it to the next level of person – in this instance, it’s 
usually a resident, you know, the next level of trainee, and then an attending.  
 
 
It just is absolutely exhausting, you know. Literally, those 36-hour shifts where you were 
pretty much up and having to perform at the top of your game (for you, personally), but 
more importantly for patients. And then you would still work the next day – there was no 
off day. And then you’d do it again a day later. And that just rolled month, after month, 
after month.  
 
 
And I think there’s an exhaustion element to it, and emotionally you don’t have time to 
regroup when you have seen things that are hard. 
 
 
There’s been few times where I felt like gosh, I might pass out; this is overwhelming. 
And one time was this young person in a neuro-critical care intensive care unit, that all of 
a sudden reminded me of my sister. And once I made that connection, I was like, “Whoa, 
whoa; okay, this is hard.” And I had to step out.  
 
 
And you don’t have time to process that too much; you’ve got to pull it back together and 
do the job you’re supposed to do. And you know, if it’s more than just a hiccup like that, 
it can be hard. And you can get derailed and not have the time to put it back together. 
 
[16:34] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
 
How did you decide on a specialty, when you were choosing residency how did you end 
up in oncology and gynecology? 
 
KZ: 
I have no idea. Whenever I – I have an idea that I’ll share with you. But I would never 
have guessed, when I started medical school, that I would have thought about 
gynecology. And to this day – I’ve been 20 years in practice – when people say, “How 
did you choose gynecology?” I just think, yeah – I would not have thought that, going 
into it.  
 
 
But I had a really meaningful moment in my second year, in that first year of medical 
school, where I was on the GYN oncology (or gynecologic oncology) service. And that’s 
a – my field takes care of female pelvic cancers, so ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 9 
cervical cancer, vulvar-vaginal cancer in women of all ages. And it’s a surgical specialty 
that also takes care of these patients medically. 
 
 
And I had trouble, first of all, thinking, “Well I really like surgery, but I don’t want to 
give up thinking critically about medical things. I like the physiology, and how does the 
heart affect, you know, what’s going on in the pelvis –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
KZ: 
And all of that. I didn’t want to totally narrow – and this maintained that, in that sense – 
didn’t sort of hand-off complex medical things.  
 
 
And I saw, in that second-year rotation, I really got close to this one patient who had 
recurrent cervical cancer (her first name is Dora). And I, you know – med students, you 
have a little more time. And I would sit at her bedside and kind of hang out with her and 
talk with her and see how she was doing, and figure out, you know – because I had time 
to listen.  
 
 
So, I’m kind of tweaking things that were going on with her. And you know, she had a 
rough go. To get rid of this recurrence, she had a huge surgery that took out the uterus 
(that had still been in place, because she’d gotten radiation), the vagina, the bladder and 
the bowel. And she had to have new bowel and bladder, created by this GYN-oncologist. 
And it was a huge undertaking.  
 
 
But she was doing – because she was young, I think she was in her – I want to say she 
was 38-42, and she wanted to be there for her kids that were still young. And I just knew 
I wanted to fix things like that for her.  
 
 
And when I saw her attending physician one day was walking in the halls, just walking 
around with her, and talking – I just thought, “Wow,” to be able to do these hugely 
complex surgeries, but have really meaningful relationships long-term (because it’s 
cancer, and you’re seeing folks every three months, and then every four months, and then 
every six months). 
 
[19:31]  
 
 
I just thought it had everything. It had everything wrapped up in one package: great 
medicine, great surgery, and just really meaningful connections to patients.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That’s interesting, yeah; because I guess other kinds of surgeons wouldn’t 
necessarily have that –  
 
KZ: 
No. 
 
LG: 
Longer-term relationship. 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 10 
KZ: 
A lot of times they don’t; or their surveillance is handed off entirely to a medical 
oncologist. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
I think unique to gynecologic cancers, you know the physical and the visual observance 
of the area of where the cancer had been can detect things earlier. And you can’t do that 
just with a physical exam of a lung cancer, so much, you know. It’s going to be all driven 
by x-rays. So, yeah; we have pretty strong continuity of care with patients that I liked.  
 
LG: 
And how did you decide you liked surgery? 
 
KZ: 
I think it went back to I just have always been dexterous with – you know, I played piano 
all through high school, a little bit into college. And it’s just very satisfying to be able to 
finally manipulate things back into what they need to be. I guess that’s kind of the draw; 
it had started (initially) when I thought I might be a hand surgeon. But then when I had 
this rotation, I thought, “No, I want to be taking care of female pelvic cancers.” 
 
 
And it’s – yeah, I found myself kind of practicing straight lines, like, “Can I do this?” 
You know, “Can I cut in a living person?” 
 
 
You know, when you’re a medical student working in the OR, you’re what we call a 
holding hook: you’re holding retractors, or you’ve got suction and you’re trying to clear 
blood away. You really do very little except observe. And that feels momentous.  
 
[21:28] 
 
 
But then I remember someone said, “Well you’re not doing anything, but you’ve got to 
feel this.” And they took my hand and they said, you know, “Here’s her bowels, here’s 
her liver.” And I said, “Wow, that’s really cool.” And they said, “Well this is really cool.”  
 
 
And then right above, at the top of the abdomen (because that’s where GYNs work, are 
the abdomen) you could feel the heart on the other side of the diaphragm, just pumping 
against it. And I was like, “Oh, man; what a privilege. This is amazing! And I could get 
to do this every day? This is amazing.” So, it had me hooked. 
 
[Chuckling]  
 
LG: 
That’s cool. 
 
 
Can you talk about your residency and fellowship (if any)? 
 
KZ: 
So, residency is a broad residency in obstetrics and gynecology. And so, I knew I wanted 
(probably) to head to cancer care, but that’s where you begin, is residency. So, after med 
school (which was four years), then there’s a four-year residency in obstetrics and 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 11 
gynecology (or OB/GYN). And then after that, an application and then training in 
gynecologic oncology.  
 
 
The OB residency –  
 
LG: 
Which was here? 
 
KZ: 
Was here, at the University of Utah (thanks), was a great – it’s a wonderful program, 
wonderful attendings that were very invested in training very good surgeons. And also, 
more the art of taking care of patients, which was great.  
 
 
When I came out and interviewed (because that’s what you do in med school: you 
interview at a number of residency programs), they had – like I have behind me here – 
these big windows between the hospital and the School of Medicine. And I realized I 
could totally become grounded if I was really flailing, you know, in terms of dealing with 
the emotional drain of this training, by just looking out that beautiful window at the rest 
of the valley of Salt Lake Valley. And it’s always grounded me. So, that was a hook. 
 
[23:28] 
 
 
But it’s a hard residency; it’s very busy, in terms of obstetrics. So, you start learning how 
to deliver babies, and also how to deal with emergencies in obstetrics, which are 
catastrophic when they occur.  
 
 
And I guess somewhere I came into it thinking I wanted to do gynecologic oncology; but 
I was pretty intrigued by some of the high-risk OB things as well. But those obstetrics, 
ironically (for me) – obstetric catastrophes are just – trying to figure out how 
(emotionally) I was built for what profession I was going to choose.  
 
 
When things go wrong in OB, it’s just awful, and they’re supposed to be good. So, here – 
it’s supposed to be magnificent and wonderful, and then all of a sudden, it’s terrible. As 
opposed to cancer, where cancer (for the most part) is terrible, unless you can fix it and 
make it better.  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Interesting. 
 
KZ: 
And I have always –  
 
LG: 
That’s interesting.  
 
KZ: 
Been better with that, than the sudden loss of life – if there’s a maternal death, or 
obstetric loss – I deal with that better. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 12 
KZ: 
So, that came into clear contrast for me there, because you do see women that die in 
childbirth, occasionally; or have babies that are born too early and pass, or have 
complicated birth defects. It’s a very challenging time in residency, because now you’ve 
got two patients: the baby and the mom. And every so often, you have to balance them. 
 
 
When I was – your choice for those two patients. When I was a chief resident (that’s your 
last year of residency), I had a patient who had come in through the ER, who was 
pregnant and had had an allergic reaction (like a profound anaphylactic shock). And gets 
rushed up, and you know, as the chief resident, you’re supposed to be making all these 
decisions now, because you’re just about out. So, you know, the attending-level faculty 
members are trying to pass that torch onto you, so you can start making those decisions.  
 
[25:54] 
 
 
And of course, if you’ve got a woman who’s pregnant and she’s not breathing, or her 
heart’s not beating, then that baby is not doing well. So, sometimes you have to 
immediately do a crash C-section. But if you’ve got a situation that might break if you 
give medications, then you have to decide, what do you do?  
 
 
And this was a situation the baby was 28 weeks, so coming out early (and this was in 
1993 [corrected by interviewee: 1997]- where we did even less-well with 28-week 
babies). It was a huge decision to crash someone who was in shock, it meant that’s going 
to compromise them, but it might save the baby. But if you can bring the patient back up, 
who is the mother, then you might do better for the baby.  
 
 
So, you know, it was this crazy thing of anesthesia, and kind of pointing to people and 
saying do this, do this. And I had my junior residents poised to cut, and we were pushing 
epinephrine, and we were pushing all the right things for anaphylactic treatment.  
 
 
And we were just about to cut, and everybody’s looking at me. And I’m like, “Let’s give 
it just a couple more minutes.” And then she broke that anaphylactic shock, and we didn’t 
have to section her, and the baby stayed in and delivered healthy. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
And you don’t know in that moment, is that the right thing? And you may never know. 
And that was very – well –  
 
LG: 
That sounds incredibly stressful. 
 
KZ: 
I don’t know what the word is – it’s a very stressful thing. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
But very – I don’t know. I just think what an amazing privilege to get to do those things 
before they’re hard –  
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 13 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
They’re hard calls, and that you don’t have time to really think about it. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Well it sounds like cancer, then, is a little bit more – you were talking about how 
you ended up going into cancer – it sounds like cancer is a little bit more methodical 
maybe? 
 
KZ: 
I think by and large that’s the case. It’s a little more in your control. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about your work? 
 
[27:58] 
 
KZ: 
So, I’ve been practicing for about 20 years in gynecologic oncology. And I’m primarily 
surgical, while I take care of medical problems in my patients; I don’t give 
chemotherapy, but a lot of my patients require that, or radiation.  
 
 
I take care of patients from seven to 97. So, I have a seven-year-old (unfortunately) 
coming in on Monday to be seen; and women up to nineties. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And that, just like that other story, is such an interesting disparity of how you make 
decisions; what’s relevant for seven-year-old, 17-year-old, 37 and 97-year-old? And the 
decisions that you have to make, and how do you weigh things is relevant at what age, 
not because older people don’t have options, but because they may choose not to do 
things.  
 
 
 
And so, I’ve always enjoyed the challenge of counselling and making decisions across 
that broad spectrum. But from a day-to-day perspective, I work five days a week, four 
weeks a month; I have very little time off. I do probably 400 to 500 surgeries a year. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
So, it’s a very busy field, which I like. But it is difficult to really juggle timing, because 
there’s no kind of, “Oh, we’ll put you off for three months.” You know? So, benign – 
surgeons that take care of things that are elective can say, “You know I’m really full the 
next three months, and we’ll put you four months from now.” 
 
 
Whenever things sort of waves of patients come in, then sometimes it’s a 14-hour OR day 
(or longer), and that’s not always manageable (or predictable, I should say). 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 14 
KZ: 
You can’t manage it away, for the most part. But I enjoy the surgeries that I do. I do a lot 
now laparoscopically, which is with little camera incisions, which has been a big shift 
over the last ten to 15 years in medicine (in general). And that’s been very helpful. 
 
[30:18] 
 
 
When some of my cancer surgeries, like for ovarian cancer, can be six to eight hours. 
 
LG: 
Oh, really? 
 
KZ: 
And the physical stress is huge. In fact, you know, you’re going after a thousand little 
tumor nodules to get them all out, with various tricks and various instruments to go after 
them; but it’s a lot of – I mean I do feel like I have a manual job –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
That I have to kind of wrestle out tumors for six hours at a time, and maintain, you know, 
safety all throughout it. And then do two more cases –  
 
LG: 
And mental acuity. 
 
KZ: 
And mental –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And stay focused. I think it fits – I’m a bit OCD (probably a lot of physicians are), and 
it’s a perfect field for this, because you do literally have a thousand tumor nodules that 
you need to get out; it makes that big a difference for ovarian cancer, to get all of the 
nodules out. And that’s why it can take eight hours.  
 
 
But there’s nothing more satisfying than literally clearing out all of the tumor, and being 
able to say, “We got it all out.” It feels good. 
 
LG: 
As a female in this surgical specialty, did you feel like there was any specific barriers you 
had to overcome? 
 
KZ: 
Yes, absolutely. When I was in my intern year – so, I was an OB/GYN resident (the first 
year is frequently called internship) – I thought (and I was) doing an awesome job on this 
rotation. And so, too, did the attending. And he thought he was doing me a very big favor 
when he said, “Karen, you’re doing an amazing job. I just want you to know that as a 
woman, you have to be ten times better than a man. That’s just how it is.” 
 
 
And I had lots of those kinds of comments. And I probably was in a timeframe where 
there had been enough women coming through that I wasn’t a pioneer in doing this. But 
that mentality still existed. And he sincerely believed it. And I knew I was better on what 
I was doing in that moment, than the people (at least) I was working with at the time.  
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 15 
 
[32:40] 
 
 
And I called him on it. I said, “Well, can you explain what that means?”  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
KZ: 
And of course, I’d been up for 36 hours, so I was not inhibited at all. And he said, “No, 
that’s just how it is, and that’s how it’s going to be for a while.” And it was a sobering 
moment. I hadn’t really experienced any gender discrimination until then. I didn’t know 
how it would impact my career or my work. So, it gave me pause; I didn’t know what 
that was going to mean. 
 
 
I think overall, I haven’t had any difficulties being accepted as a surgeon and a surgeon 
that does complex surgeries. I like to talk to patients, and I’m very bedside manner-
oriented. And a lot of male physicians in the time of my training and evolution weren’t so 
much, and I would get poked at for that, “Eh, you’re taking too much time.” I’m like, 
“No, this is important.” 
 
 
But in terms of the practice of medicine, I would say no. In terms of the politics of 
medicine, I would say absolutely.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
There’s barriers. I think there still is at the place I did my residency, and I was on faculty 
there when I finished my training. I was hired in $50,000 lower than the person that was 
hired the year before, for the exact same credentials (I learned later).  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
But I didn’t know that. Yeah, there’s a lot of that.  
 
 
When I had to – I had some difficulties, because I was very busy (clinically) – I had lots 
of patients and I was doing research: basic science research, running a lab, and I had 
created an outreach program for a corner of Idaho that didn’t have this specialty, to try 
and help people stay closer to home.  
 
[34:39] 
 
 
 
And I was working, probably – after all of my training as a faculty member, probably 
about 90 to 100 hours a week, doing these three jobs –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
KZ: 
And I asked my department chairman, I said, “I need some help juggling this. How do I 
control my clinical volume, so I can make sure I’m there to teach the residents, to teach 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 16 
the medical students, to do the basic science? But I keep seeing all these patients, which I 
love, and I can’t say no. So, I need a little help with this.” I thought I could use some 
mentorship in this. 
 
 
And his response was, “Karen, as a woman, you must feel so torn between your job and 
your family.” 
 
LG: 
Oh my god! [Laughs] 
 
KZ: 
Yes. I don’t know if this is the right thing for this interview, but – yeah. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
That’s when I decided to leave the faculty there, because –  
 
LG: 
Did you just want to like bang your head on the desk? That’s what it makes me want to 
do. 
 
KZ: 
Yeah, it did. Well, I had stronger words when I turned in my [laughs] resignation to start 
a private practice. And I think things are a little better now, for women. But I would say 
the cadre of women that I know best right now, that are surgical sub-specialists, and 
pretty intense, accomplished people – they all have stories like that.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
I have a friend who’d gone through, actually, Duke’s med school with me and was on 
faculty at the same time when I came out of my training. And she had gone in to talk to 
the department chair about some contract negotiations. And her husband is also a 
physician, and she’s a surgeon, and he’s an anesthesiologist.  
 
 
And she, at the time, was incredibly busy – one of the busiest surgeons in her field, and 
had a major grant from NIH for research in micro-vascular work. And she (like me) was 
working her tail off, but she was getting paid at this very, like almost – I mean, it’s more 
– probably at a nurse practitioner-level salary, which is not appropriate for the amount of 
money she was bringing in, and it wasn’t that important to her.  
 
 
So, she said, “You know, hey – I think we should renegotiate my contract.” And [laughs] 
the department chair said to her, “Well, hey – your husband works, so your salary doesn’t 
really matter that much.” 
 
[37:12] 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
To a professor at a university, who is an accomplished surgeon –  
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 17 
LG: 
Surgeon. 
 
KZ: 
And researcher, and an NIH grant-funded person. So, I’d like to think that’s improved a 
lot, but you know, certainly – and it’s regional –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And it’s specific to places and people, it’s not a universal thing. But it is a shame that 
folks who have decided to really put enormous amount of energy (physical and 
emotional) towards a profession have that at all to be in the way of doing the things that 
they’ve trained to do and do really well. I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
Not as [inaudible]. 
 
KZ: 
I hope it’s a lot better, but –  
 
LG: 
I do too. 
 
KZ: 
Mostly, you know. 
 
LG: 
I do too; but I appreciate you sharing that example, so. 
 
 
Can we talk a little bit about – so, you work with cancers (obviously), which is a difficult 
field, I imagine. Can you talk a little bit about self-care? And like how do you take care 
of yourself in the context of difficult work? Or do you? 
 
[Laughter] 
 
KZ: 
Well, I would say I am going to look at this painting that’s on my wall, that’s really not 
well-suited to a radio/auditory interview here. But there’s a Klimt painting here, a famous 
painting with this “Kiss” kind of motif (it’s a different one). But it’s called “The Tree of 
Life.” And I put this up here to remind me of that little black bird in the middle of it. It’s 
a beautiful painting, and there’s lots of other intrigue in it.  
 
 
But to me, there’s all this beauty, but there’s always (at the center of it) this reminder of 
life is fleeting, and there’s some darkness here, and there’s some loss that’s going to 
happen. And my job is to try and keep that tree growing. But I don’t really have total 
control that that bird is sitting there – that bird that represents death. And that helps me, 
because I don’t have all-knowing and all-capacity to fix things.  
 
 
So, some of the tragedy of what I see – and I see it weekly and daily; and I’ve had this 
recent run of very young women with advanced cancers: 21-year-old with stage four 
cervical cancer; 38-year-old (right now) who is dying in the hospital. 
 
[39:54]  
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 18 
 
And I guess partly the self-care is trying to remind myself, constantly, that if I can make 
it better (even in the short-term) – either if it’s a pain alleviation, or can I extend life for 
three, six, 12 months? That might be a window where a young mother’s kid knows her. 
And that helps me a lot.  
 
 
But I would say most of my career I haven’t done very good on the self-care element. So, 
I had a phase of burnout about five years ago. That was very intense. And I would say 
I’m still sort of using the things that I learned to get out of that. There’s a big movement 
now about that. I’d like to not have people get to that point. But it’s hard.  
 
 
It still is about an 80-hour work week. I’m solo practice. It’s hard to not bring that home, 
and then your home life, which is hopefully a haven then isn’t, because you were lashing 
out, and such. 
 
 
Probably the most helpful thing I learned was to partition in a healthy way, and be a little 
more mindful. Like so, when I go home, before I leave to my car, I say to myself (I 
actively say), “You are home, you are not at work.” And that way, when I walk in and I 
interact with my husband (and I have two girls), my work life is done.  
 
 
And I didn’t do that very well probably the first 15 years. Because it’s caring – all these 
people who are in different stages of dying or being ill, at home. And that would weigh 
on me, and I wouldn’t sleep well. And then I wasn’t interacting as well with my family, 
that I could have been. So, now I try to do that. 
 
[41:58] 
 
 
And then I tried to incorporate it now in the office, too. Like when I knock on a door to 
go into a patient’s room in my clinic, even though this last patient I might be recognizing 
this is the last time I’m seeing them, and they’re going on hospice, and I’ve known them 
for ten years, and I’m going to get a little cry. But this other patient isn’t that patient, you 
know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And that’s a hard transition. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
KZ: 
So, now I have the same rhythm of, I knock on the door and I say, “I’m with this patient.” 
You know? And that has helped the downward slide into the sadness that cancer care and 
complex medical care has.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. And would you say when you were in the burnout – is it the sadness 
of the work that contributed to that burnout, or the work hours? Or what factors? 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 19 
KZ: 
I would say not the hours, I’m pretty good at hours – I mean, you’re trained to do it. I 
think it’s the sadness and the – it’s like pushing the ball up the hill forever and ever. 
There is a lot of sad things; and there is a lot of patients that need long surgeries. 
 
 
In that era, I was doing probably 14 surgeries a week, and it was hard. And those were 
just the patients – they just needed to get taken care of. There’s only – at the time, I think 
there was only five specialists in the state that do what I do. So, there really wasn’t a lot 
of flex to –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
KZ: 
Say, “Oh, well I’m full.” You know? “Try the other office; try this other doc.” So, I 
would try to just get it all done. And it just put a lot of emotional, physical strain. I pulled 
a neck muscle on one really hard case on an overweight woman that had a bad cancer. It 
took me about a year of physical therapy to work that out. And until I did, I couldn’t stop 
working –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
KZ: 
Because all these patients kept coming. And so, what I had to do was put three steps up, 
that I could stand on, so I could be taller, so I could reach down –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
Instead of lift my arms up. Because I couldn’t lift my main, dominant arm up. It took me 
a year and a half.  
 
LG: 
It’s like a workman’s comp case, you know? [Laughing] 
 
KZ: 
It is like a workman’s comp case; but as most surgeons will tell you, it’s not like you can 
really stop. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
KZ: 
So, you’ve got to find your work-around.  
 
[44:25] 
 
 
So, that’s been hard. And it’s been hard on my family. And now, I feel like we’re in a 
good place, but you know, obviously (for me) my kids are currently 15 and 17; so, some 
of those tough years were in their really formative years. And I needed to be there for my 
patients, and I had to stay late (until seven or eight). And when they were little, they were 
in bed. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 20 
KZ: 
I might not see them. And probably the most crushing thing, before I figured out how to 
make this work better, is one of my girls when she was little (probably like six), said, 
“Hey mom, can you come visit us some more?” [Laughs] 
 
 
I was like, “Oh my gosh! No, you know I live here, right?” [Laughs] And it was 
innocently said, right?  
 
LG: 
Out of the mouths of babes. 
 
KZ: 
Out of the mouths of babes. So, then I started – when I would go in on the weekend to 
round, because as people may or may not know, Monday through Friday you take care of 
patients (if you’re a surgeon), or you take care of in-patients in hospitals. Then Saturday 
and Sunday you go into the hospital, see how they’re doing, hopefully move things 
forward. So, you may not have clinic or surgeries, but you’re checking on patients. It’s a 
seven day a week job; it’s like two jobs.  
 
 
So, then I would start getting up at (when they were little) I would get up on Saturdays 
and Sundays at five, so I could get into the hospital, see all the patients and get home – 
sometimes put my pajamas back on and act like I’d just been there. And then we’d get up 
and have pancake breakfast, or whatever, and – just to trick them. [Laughs] Because I 
was like –  
 
LG: 
Super mom. 
 
KZ: 
Because they were little. Right; because that’s the pressure, right? 
 
LG: 
Yeah it is; it is. Absolutely. 
 
KZ: 
And I think women (in general) you know, have that challenge: that work, and have a 
family.  
 
 
And I believed then, and I still believe it’s been very positive for my kids (who are both 
women, young women) to see that balance. I don’t have any regrets about that. I did 
when she asked me if I could visit more, but I found a work-around. And I visited more. 
 
[46:30] 
 
LG: 
So, one question that I’m particularly interested in is that doctors are pretty well-known 
for their sense of humor. Do you find humor emerging in your work? And if so, would 
you – can you talk about it? Or –  
 
KZ: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
If it doesn’t then that’s fine too. 
 
KZ: 
Well, it’s always a little dangerous to ask a gynecologist about –  
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 21 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
KZ: 
Things about humor. I think there is definitely an odd – what’s the right word? It’s a self-
protective humor that I think most physicians have, and surgeons; and that just is how it 
is.  
 
 
But I think – well I guess a couple things; I mean, it’s easy (for me) I will say, 
professionally, the word “vagina” quite a bit, because that’s what I take care of. But it is – 
it’s interesting when you’re a physician, and people – even if they know you’re a 
gynecologist – think you’re going to know lots of other things, still.  
 
 
Even though now, it’s 20 years since I’ve done anything besides OB/GYN-GYN cancer 
care. And I would have people (when my kids were little), like when I was at a basketball 
game I would have like mothers say, “Oh, my gosh. Little so-and-so – she twisted her 
ankle; can you look at it?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
KZ: 
And I would look at it, and I’d say, “I don’t think she has vaginitis.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
KZ: 
I would never be asked again by that mom. I’d be like, “I just don’t know.” 
 
LG: 
That’s funny. 
 
KZ: 
So, there is a lot of things.  
 
I just had happen last week that I had to do a biopsy on a patient in my office. And she is 
prone to fainting she tells me; she can’t give blood, or even just get her bloods drawn – 
she’s prone to fainting. But she didn’t tell me that before I did this biopsy. She’s (I think) 
mid-30s, very healthy, but just has a very profound (what we call) vagal reaction.  
 
And so, I did this biopsy. And she has a name that can be shortened to – well, her name is 
Elizabeth. And she sat up too quickly after this biopsy, and she goes, “I think I’m going 
to,” and she falls back onto the exam table. And I was like, “Oh, sheez; she passed out,” I 
mean, she looked bad. And I go to the door and I call for my nurse, because we’d done 
the biopsy, and she’d already left and the patient was fine. But she sat up and she passed 
out. 
 
[48:58] 
 
And I’m trying to rouse her, and I’m kind of screaming at her, “Liz, Liz, Liz!” And as she 
comes to, she goes, “I’m not Liz!” 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 22 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
KZ: 
“What?!” 
 
She goes, “I told you, I go by such and such.” She went by her middle name. But in the 
moment, I had no idea. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
And that night I was going out with a few colleagues (other GYNs), and I told this story. 
And the funny thing to me (it’s a funny story), but the funny thing to me was in telling 
this to these other physicians (because we’d gone out to, kind of a girls’ night out to a 
Broadway show and we were eating dinner), and I said, “Oh, my gosh; I felt so bad. Here 
I am trying to rouse this unconscious patient, and I’m screaming the wrong name.” (But I 
wasn’t, I just didn’t know what nickname she went by.) 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
And they just thought it was so funny that somebody blew, you know, milk out of her 
(well not milk, we happened to have some adult drinks) –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
KZ: 
Out their nose. 
 
LG: 
That’s funny. 
 
KZ: 
Because we could all imagine that drama of that moment. But the irony of me going, 
“Liz!” And the first thing she says is –  
 
LG: 
Not Liz! 
 
KZ: 
“I’m not Liz!” 
 
LG: 
Not Liz. 
 
KZ: 
It’s like [soft scream]. But anyway. 
 
LG: 
That is super cute.  
 
KZ: 
It was funny. 
 
LG: 
That is really funny. 
 
 
Well what’s one of the most gratifying things about your job?  
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 23 
KZ: 
You know, there are a lot of people that – I mean, it’s a huge gratification that I actually 
do cure cancer, and not everybody, but probably about half the people. And that’s huge. 
And that almost goes without saying, that’s a huge thing – 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
To feel like you can do. But I actually, probably get even more gratification out of – I just 
find it tremendously amazing process that I meet somebody, and then if I can help them 
understand what they’re facing, that they make a decision with me, and then they let me 
operate on them.  
 
 
I mean, the fact that humans have that trust in another human is, to me, one of the more 
gratifying things. I don’t know, I like that connection. I guess maybe now I take for 
granted that I’m going to cure some people (not granted, but it’s just part of what I do) –  
 
[51:20] 
 
LG: 
An expectation, yeah. 
 
KZ: 
It’s expectation.  
 
 
You know, the other thing that I think is kind of oddly gratifying – and maybe that’s the 
point of my career that I’m at – is I think what’s sometimes incredibly important, but 
doesn’t happen in a timely way sometimes is trying to help somebody understand that 
you may really be at a point where doing more isn’t the right thing to do; that it’s more 
important to focus on, as good as they do feel, spending time with their family.  
 
 
That maybe more chemotherapy is not the right thing, or surgery isn’t the right thing if a 
cancer has come back. Not because I’m fatalistic – I usually am a do more than less; but 
there is a point where pretty much everybody on a patient’s team knows that another 
round is not going to add time, but it is going to put you in the hospital, and you’re going 
to have lab draws, and you’re going to have side effects.  
 
 
Or this surgery is not going to fix your bowel blockage, but you might have a bag now, 
collecting stool that you’re going to have to live with until you die. And it totally screws 
with my clinic schedule, but when I have someone who is at that point, I really like to just 
tell my staff to figure out the rest of the day and just spend an hour and help them 
understand where they’re at, so they can make a choice (if that’s what they want to do).  
 
 
Because the last thing I want someone to do is spend their last days in the hospital, and 
not with their family, or not speaking because they’re on a ventilator, because they 
weren’t strong enough to withstand the treatment.  
 
 
And so, it’s very gratifying when I can help someone understand where they’re at, and 
make a decision that’s right for them. 
 
Physician Oral History: Karen Zempolich 
Page 24 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
 
What advice would you have for somebody who is thinking about going to medical 
school? Or what would you want them to think about? 
 
[53:25] 
 
KZ: 
Well, I would say right from the get go, to never forget that it’s a privilege of what you’re 
doing, and to focus on the art of taking care of patients and listening.  
 
 
The more I sit down and listen to someone, or ask them, “What’s your understanding?” I 
don’t just make a connection that helps me take care of them, but I often figure the 
problem out better, because I’ve taken out, you know, my algorithmic approach, and just 
listened for a little bit. And that has gotten increasingly harder to do in today’s medical 
care: to take time to clear your schedule, to really sit at the bedside in a hospital room.  
 
 
And if you like that sleuthing, if you like solving problems, remember that just listening 
to clues from how the patient’s story unfolded really does help you figure that out. And 
it’s – I think that a lot of people in my era of medicine training and medical practice see it 
as being harder and harder to have exist in the training period.  
 
 
So, if you see someone who excels at it: a resident, or an intern, or an attending, or a 
nurse – I’ve learned immense amounts from nurses, because everybody has something to 
teach you about what they’ve learned about how to take care of a patient and how to 
solve that problem in a compassionate way.  
 
 
And just be open to all that kind of learning, because you’re going to be smart enough to 
figure out how to do the work; but how to do it well, and meaningfully and 
compassionately – that’s harder. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
You know? 
 
LG: 
Do you think that’s because of the technology? Or because of the –  
 
[55:24] 
 
KZ: 
Yes. I mean, right now –  
 
LG: 
Way the medical tier is structured, or why? 
 
KZ: 
Yes. Some of it is sort of medical-legal. You know, you have to do – I don’t find myself 
in this situation, thankfully, but you know – ER docs: if they didn’t get a CAT scan, you 
know, and something happened then they might get berated for that, in that worst case, 
you know? Have it be a legal case.

But in the training timeframe, the way electronic medical records have taken over, which 
I think, in general, should be a great advantage – a lot of the electronic health records (or 
EMRs) – a big part of their role is trying to generate enough boxes checked, so that either 
a practice or a hospital can capture as much billing as possible. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And that’s not the same as solving the patient’s problem. And the volume, the way 
hospitals are structured these days, to try to make the money they need to make/want to 
make – they streamline how many people are around to take care of patients. So, general 
practitioners are seeing 40 and 60 patients; when really – to take in-patient care, they 
should see 16, they’re seeing 30. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
You know, I work with an internal medicine person who is from India; he’s a wonderful 
doc. And we took take care of (jointly) a patient from another country, Ghana. And I 
watched him sit down, and he talked to her; and he figured something out because he 
talked to her.  
 
 
And he explained something to me that was so relevant, which was, “Oh, yeah; she 
understands that when you have this fever, it’s usually malaria. And you just go down 
and you take these pills.” And of course, we don’t experience that here, in America. But 
if he hadn’t sat down with the patient (and my patient was in for something, and that was 
a relevant side note) – but he knew that if he understood where the patient was from, 
talked to them, thought about it.  
 
[57:40] 
 
 
But none of that generates money for the hospital – labs do, x-rays do; and they save 
money by tasking their docs with more patients to take care of. And you spend a large 
part of your time charting on a computer, instead of writing some handwritten notes. So, 
it's a teeter-totter.  
 
 
I think, unfortunately, we (I believe) really need to change our healthcare system. We’re 
driven – not the docs, per se – I think that’s the hardest thing for docs, is docs, very often, 
aren’t driven by monetary forces, but the systems they work in, are.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And it impacts how they take care of patients. Probably the biggest part of my burnout 
five years ago was the realization that the systems around me – while they often give 
some lip service to what’s important about patient safety and patient care – really, the 
number one thing is the monetary driving forces. And docs don’t have as much control 
over that anymore, of saying, “No, no, no, no – it’s really, it’s still important.”

I have a patient who has a cancer that I had on the OR for today – in fact, that’s why I 
had time for this interview today. And the insurance company said, “No, we still need 14 
days to approve this surgery.”  
 
 
Well it’s going to get approved. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
She has a known cancer; but they have a process. And this is a patient that comes from 
four hours away, she came in – and now she has to go back for four hours, and has to 
come from, you know, southeast Idaho again on another day, when the insurance 
company gets around to saying, yes, we can do it. 
 
 
So, our process of how we authorize and pay for our medical care – I think patients (non-
physicians) just don’t understand how much the way insurance companies drive our 
decision-making, how hospitals then drive their charting and their staffing – all in ways 
that are all about not patient care. 
 
 
And I kind of lost track of where [laughs] that question was initially, but –  
 
[59:50] 
 
LG: 
I think we were talking about that – you were talking about the importance of learning to 
listen –  
 
KZ: 
Oh. 
 
LG: 
You know, for you –  
 
KZ: 
Right, and what are the barriers to it. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, what are the barriers? 
 
KZ: 
The barriers, yeah. I mean, when I see a patient – I’ve kind of honed in now that I have a 
mid-level provider, a physician’s assistant who can kind of start getting some of the 
history, which is great – all the nitty-gritty. Then I can walk in and go, “What did she 
forget?” You know, and, “Tell me what you really understand.” And I can take some just 
listening time. But that’s taken me 20 years to hone that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And I’m in a situation where I’m a surgical specialist where because I do a lot of 
surgeries, that generates some, you know, funding for my clinic, that allows me to have a 
mid-level provider.

If you’re an internist, you don’t have a plethora of procedural-based money coming in, so 
that you can then have people in the clinic, so that you can take –  
 
 
I feel really fortunate that I can spend – probably my new patients I spend probably an 
hour to an hour and a half with them –  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
KZ: 
To talk about what they have, to examine them, to make a plan, to talk about the risks. 
And I figured that out by having other people start the post-op check, and then I go, 
“Hey, you look great!” [Laughs] You know? But that’s taken 20 years.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
And I guess I worry that, if under the burden of having to just see patients to make your 
overhead, or if you’re in a system that covers your overhead, but now is on you to see 
patients because you didn’t meet your production level. I just don’t want new docs to 
forget that that’s of the prime importance; it’s really easy to get under the bureaucratic 
quagmire of medicine.  
 
LG: 
Okay. I have asked the majority of my questions. Is there anything that you think is really 
important, that you would want the public to know about being a doctor, or your own, 
personal experiences? 
 
[1:01:55] 
 
KZ: 
I guess, I think in general, what’s important to know about physicians is that I think the 
vast majority go into it for reasons that are good. And that they want to take good care of 
patients. But they’re human, and they have all these pressures (as we’ve talked about), 
and those can come out at times. And to be able to see their doc as human is important; 
and maybe even the most sway, is that if you – I think patients don’t always question 
their docs enough, in the sense of saying, “Well why is it that you’re recommending 
that?” Right? And I actually think that should happen more. But in a way, that could be 
not threatening to the ego of the doc [laughs]; and I don’t know how to make that happen, 
but that needs to happen more. So, I would say that patients and people should feel 
empowered to say, “Hey, these are people working on my behalf – I want to be able to 
ask questions of them. But I do need to understand that how I phrase it might be 
perceived incorrectly.” And just to be collaborative, and work towards that. But that also, 
if you don’t have a good, collaborative relationship, you should feel free to find another 
doc, because that’s so important: the trust that you have with the doc is incredibly 
important. And if you don’t have that trust, I would worry that you’re not going to have 
the care that you should get.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Okay. Anything else you feel important? 
 
KZ: 
No.

LG: 
[Inaudible]? 
 
KZ: 
No. I don’t think so. I feel really lucky; I love my job, every, single day. 
 
LG: 
Would you do it again – knowing all that you know now, would you choose to be a 
physician again? 
 
KZ: 
I would totally do it again, yeah. I honestly love my job, and to be able to say that every, 
single day is great. 
 
 
When I was in a burnout timeframe, I wondered if I would do it again. But now that I’m 
not burned out –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
KZ: 
I just think it’s – there’s so much in medicine that people can find a niche that they fit, 
cerebrally, that they enjoy, or they like hand-eye coordination. And taking care of 
patients is amazing.  
 
LG: 
Cool. Alright, well I’m going to do a closing tag.  
 
 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert, and today is February 13th, 2020; and I’ve been talking to Dr. 
Karen Zempolich (with a hard “k”) in her office here, in Salt Lake City, at St. Mark’s 
Hospital.  
 
 
Thank you so much for talking to me. 
 
KZ: 
Thank you.
