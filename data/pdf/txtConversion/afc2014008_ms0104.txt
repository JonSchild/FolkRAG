Re:
 H
ispanic-American Week
 
The following i
s a summary of a d
iscussion w
ith Dr. Arturo Warman
 
about t
he H
ispanic-American p
rogram week at AFS meeting, New Orleans,
 
October 2
4 a
nd 25.
 
P
rofessor Warman, probably t
he n
icest man i
n t
he western hemisphere,
 
talked on a number of programmatic possibilities, i
ncluding, at my
 
r
equest, s
uggestions on areas other t
han Mexico proper.
 
SPAIN
 
Though most of t
he early Spanish explorers and settlers came t
o
 
t
he new world out of t
he Spanish provinces of Castille and Extremadura,
 
t
hey s
tayed i
n southern Spain before departure sometimes as l
ong a
s a
 
year.
 (
It t
ook a l
ong t
ime to make t
he journey south during t
hose days,
 
and t
he f
leet was t
ypically months and months l
ate; apparently t
he DPA
 
i
s not t
he only p
lace where deadlines don't get met.)  This s
ituation
 
resulted i
n t
heir acquisition of t
he Andalucian musical t
radition and
 
r
epertoire.  Thus i
n H
ispanic Mexico, t
he musical t
radition i
s l
argely
 
Andalucian r
ather t
han E
xtremaduran or Castillian.  This seems an
 
extremely i
mportant point f
or a
ll f
ield workers t
o bear i
n m
ind.
 
Warman r
ecommends s
trongly t
hat Anna Lomax, before her r
eturn
 
from Spain, v
isit t
he Canary I
slands, l
argely settled by Africans a
nd
 
H
ispanic-American r
eturnees from Peru a
nd Mexico d
uring t
he 1
8th a
nd
 
l
9th centuries.  Thus t
heir music i
s c
losely r
elated both to Mexico
 
and the H
ispanic Caribbean.  The r
epertory i
ncludes many songs known
 
i
n t
he new a
nd t
he o
ld world, but C
anarian s
tyle i
s a b
it d
ifferent -
-
somewhere between the Puerto R
ican seis a
nd t
he Mexican _
iarocho
_ but 
"not so bright -- more soft and gentle".
 
Warman suggests bringing i
n one male a
nd one f
emale copla s
inger
 
(
they t
ake t
urns, s
inging i
n solo but overlapping s
lightly on t
he l
ast
 
note) p
lus an accompanying musical ensemble of perhaps 5 or so s
tring
 
p
layers.  They a
lso s
ing aguinaldos (
Christmas songs), and t
here i
s a
 
dance tradition which accompanies t
he coplas. 
P
rofessor Garcia-Matos
 
of Spain has done extensive r
esearch i
nto t
he music of t
he Canaries,
 
but unfortunately d
ied a year or so ago.  However, Warman i
s sure some
 
of h
is s
tudents would be available for advice and counsel.

ANDALUCIA
 
Warman f
eels i
t w
ill be very d
ifficult to get a Gypsy quadro to
 
represent t
he f
lamenco tradition, because so many of t
hem have gone
 
r
eally commercial.  H
is a
dvice i
s t
o t
ry for a peasant r
ather t
han a
 
gypsy f
lamenco group; t
hey are not "as bright but s
till wonderful".
 
He a
lso s
uggests t
hat a s
ingle s
inger who can do t
he S
aetas (
Holy
 
Week song) be considered; no accompaniment on t
he guitar would be
 
u
sed f
or t
hese a
nd we could l
eave out t
he brass band t
hat normally
 
preceeds t
he song.
 
What he r
eally t
hinks we should bring f
rom Andalucia are
 
campanilleros (
Christmas songs accompanied by bells and a f
riction
 
drum, z
amponia). These could be performed effectively, he t
hinks,
 
by a group of s
ix (
typically, young people, between t
he ages of 1
2
 
and 26 or so).  The song t
radition sung by t
hese f
olks i
s r
elated
 
to t
he P
uerto R
ican aguinaldos (
Christmas songs) a
nd t
o t
he j
arocho
  
aguinaldo s
ung i
n New Mexico.  He feels t
his i
s t
he c
learest cognate
 
tradition we can demonstrate and s
hould definitely be i
ncluded;
 
besides, t
hey are very beautiful.
 
CATALONIA
 
He r
ecommends skipping t
he Catalonians i
n Spain proper, a
s t
hey
 
d
id not emigrate to t
he new world until t
he l
ate 1
8th century, and
 
t
here i
s t
hus no c
lear Catalonian i
nfluence i
n t
he new world.
 
VALENCIA
 
He agrees w
ith Anna t
hat t
he a
leu en dos t
radition i
s e
specially
 
wonderful.
 
OLD CASTILLE
 
Again, he agrees w
ith Anna's r
ecommendations, adding only t
hat
 
t
here are charros t
here, which are r
elated t
o t
he Mexican c
harros. 
He says t
hey are good dancers b
ut t
here i
s not much a
ssociated music;
 
therefore t
here would be no point i
n bringing t
hem unless we p
lan to
 
i
nclude t
he charro t
radition i
n t
he new world.
 (
This essentially
 
l
ogistical problem i
s still not settled.  BLH)
 
-3-
ASTURIAS
 
Warman p
articularly r
ecommends t
he a
sturianadas a
s t
ruly great
 
music.  He believes t
he vaqueros copla could more easily be found i
n
 
Galicia t
han i
n Asturias;  i
n connection w
ith t
he polyphonic t
radition
 
i
n Galicia, he says polyphonic s
inging can a
lso be found i
n Extremadura
 
and that overall  i
t i
s c
losely r
elated t
o Portuguese polyphony.
 (
In
 
a
nother conversation he r
emarked t
hat polyphonic r
eligious music (
(La
 
Herta?)) could be found 50 m
iles south of Madrid.)
 
ARAGON
 
H
is only comment here was t
hat i
t m
ight be d
ifficult to present
 
t
he jots properly w

Warman s
ays t

tudent of R

He commented t

ruly "amazing
 
song t

NEW YORK
 
He heard a Galician bagpiper i
n a parade i
n New York on October
 
1
2 l
ast year.  He s
ays t
he headquarters f
or Spanish music i
n New York
 
i

4th S
treet between 7
th and 8
th Avenues i
n some of t
he
 
Spanish r
estaurants where t
he Spanish t
hemselves go t
o p
lay t
heir music.
 
Ralph added t
hat t
he New York r
estaurant Oviedo on 1
4th between 7
th
 
and 8
th would p
erhaps know t

iper, Antonio Mosquera

ince t
hey go i
nto Mexico
 
w

requency t
o participate i

here.  Overall,
 
however,  1 believe he would prefer to bring another Native American
 
group f
rom Mexico i
nstead of t
he Yaquis.

MEXICO
 
i
 
Following R
alph's trip to Mexico, t
he following n
egotiation was
 
concluded.  Professor Warman w
ill not be a
ble to continue working w
ith
 
u
s except a
s a
dvisor s
ince he w
ill be engaged i
n a full year's f
ield
 
project i
n M
ichoacan starting next J
anuary.  A graduate school f
ield
 
worker f
rom t
he I
nstituto N
acionale d
'Antropologia, s
elected b
y I
rene
 
Vasquez of t
he N
ational Museum of Anthropology, w
ill actually f
ollow
 
t
hrough on Dr. Warman's s
uggestions l
isted below.  The work w
ill be
 
d
irectly supervised by Ms Vasquez; t
he two of t
hem w
ill be on t
he mall
 
a
s presenters.  The name of t
he graduate s
tudent selected (
who i
s
 
supposed t
o be b
i-lingual) w
ill be c
irculated t
o a
ll f
ield workers
 
when k
nown.
 
Dr. Warman s
uggested t
he f
ollowing groups f
or t
he p
resentation
 
from Mexico.
 
1
.  An I
ndian (
Native American) group, e
ither:
 
Aztec (
3-4), c
hirimia (
an oboe), perhaps trumpet, 2 drums
 
-
- huehuetl  s
ingle membrane t
ubular drum) a
nd a r
edoble (
type of
 
s
nare drum).  No vocal w
ith t
his group.  Or
 
C
hiapas (
4), a 26-string harp, p
lus one or two 1
2-string
 
guitars.  These p
eople h
ave a tradition of vocal music, u
sually i
n
 
t
hree p
arts w
ith a great vocal  r
ange between p
arts.
 
E
ither I
ndian group selected would be performing r
eligious
 
music; s
ince t
hese musicians p
articipate continually i
n r
eligious
 
observances i
n t
heir own communities,  i
t may be extremely d
ifficult
 
to l
ocate a group w
illing to be away f
or an entire month.
 
2
.  Corridos: a s
ingle s
inger accompanying h
imself on guitar,
 
f
rom t
he Guanajuato or o
ther central Mexico area.  On the mall t
his
 
s
inger could be easily duplicated by corrido s
ingers from t
he
 
Southwest where t
he tradition i
s a
lso very l
ively; however, Prof.
 
Warman f
eels corridos are so s
ignificant a p
art of t
he Mexican
 
r
epertory t
hat t
hey must be i
ncluded from Mexico so t
hat t
he t
our
 
performance w
ill be properly r
epresentative.
 
3
.  J
arocho tradition from Vera Cruz (
3-4), harp, guitar,
 
r
equinto (
5-stringed i
nstrument p
layed w
ith a f
lat p
ick) a
nd jarana
 
(
ten-string i
nstrument which i
s normally s
trummed).  To t
his s
hould
 
be added a v
iolin.
 (
One of t
he i
nstrumentalists ordinarily s
ings;
 
t
his s
tyle i
s a vocal a
s well a
s i
nstrumental tradition.)
 
-5-
4
.  Huasteca (
3 or 5
).  This tradition s
tems f
rom north Vera
 
Cruz or f
rom southern Tamaulipas.  A r
emarkable musical s
tyle p
erformed
 
by v
iolin, j
arana (
10-string), huapanguera (
12-string), i
ncluding a
lso
 
spectacular vocals a
nd a dancing s
tyle i
n which t
he dancer's f
eet
 
only h
it t
he ground between notes of t
he i
nstrumental accompaniment.
 
The dancing may well be d
ifficult t
o g
et, D
r. Warman says, a
s t
he
 
musicians are peasants but t
he dancers come f
rom t
he e
lite c
lasses.
 
I
rene Vasquez, however, wants two dancers a
nd feels she can get t
hem.
 
5
.  O
ld S
tyle Mariachi (
5-6).  This would consist entirely of
 
stringed i
nstruments w
ithout w
ind (
trumpets) and would probably come
 
from Jalisco or T
ierra Caliente (
Michoacan).
 
6
.  An additional tradition which m
ight be i
ncluded i
s t
he
 
salterio. Warman k
nows a f
ine s
alterio p
layer who p
lays t
he European
 
1
9th century r
epertoire extremely well -
- mostly E
uropean (
Austrian)
 
waltzes and so on.  He i
s, however, extremely e
lderly a
nd b
lind a
nd
 
t
hus may be d
ifficult to persuade to come; however, Warman has heard
 
of several more l
ikely possibilities.  The salterio i
s l
ike t
he kanun
 
a trapezoidal p
lucked p
saltery.
 
Warman does not want to bring t
he f
ollowing t
raditions f
rom Mexico:
 
1
.  N
orteno. This i
s a r
ecent style very common i
n t
he United
 
S
tates a
nd t
hus unnecessary to bring f
rom Mexico.
 B
asically,  i
t consists
 
of an i
nstrumentarium of guitar and contrabajo p
lus r
edoble (
a small box
 
drum).  Warman t
hinks t
his m
ight best be s
hown b
y a Texas group, where
 
t
he style i
s r
eally quite hot.
 
2
.  Brass band. This i
s t
he most popular musical ensemble, w
ith
 
a combined c
ivic and r
egional  r
epertoire performed i
n a s
tyle which
 
originated i
n France.  The brass band i
s c
learly f
olk i
n t
erms of
 
social context; t
he musicians are a
ll musically l
iterate, p
laying from
 
band a
rrangements which are s
trictly l
ocal and prepared b
y t
he band
 
master.  They n
ever u
se commercially p
ublished sheet music.  The
 
musicians t
ypically p
lay i
n t
he band only u
ntil t
hey are married; t
hey
 
are f
requently monolingual -
- no S
panish, only one or other of t
he
 
various I
ndian l
anguages.
 I
n order to bring s
uch a group, i
t would
 
be necessary to bring a
t l
east 1
0 musicians, so Warman f
eels t
his may
 
be i
mpractical f
or FAF purposes.
 
3
.  Warman syas t
here are many beautiful  I
ndian t
raditions which
 
are s
imply t
oo d
ifficult t
o bring:  among t
he Yaqui, t
he monochord
 
(
picking bow); t
he t
hree hole f
lute common t
o many t
ribes; and t
he
 
water drum (
played w
ith t
he original deer dances).

F

 He is t f

 He is a person of integrity and intelligence,

 For this reason,

 Garcia Miranda,  Oct.  30 - Mari Carmen de Jerez also peesent.
 
exRaxi Garcia Miranda approved the preliminary plans
 
for fikkgfieldwo.rk in Spain.
 He arranged that very morning to
 
fund someone to travel with me for the time that I am here,  and
 
to do follow up work, KxAxwf
fxxojxHe said that he would try to con-
firm Spanish Government financial commitment by the 10th of
 
Novermber,  but pointed out that consideration of the matter had
 
been somewhat delayed owing to Franco's illness.
 I don;t
 
see that there will be any problem, however.

 There  is a whole family group there who sing wedding
 
songs,  lullabyes,  ballads,  Christmas songs,  and work songs.

He has worked for many years with Spanish National Radio
 
and also at the Conservatory of  Music.
 The tapes that Mr.
 
Cano lent us were part of his collection.
 His specialty is
 
flamenco,  but he has contacts all over Spain,  due to his work
 
in radio,  and his interests in Spanish folklore has a whole.
 
He told me right away that he wanted to  collaborate with the
 
Smithsonian on the project,  along with Caro Baroja.
 More about
 
him later.
 
3-
4.
 Julio Caro Baroja - Oct.  31.
 Pio Baroja also present.
 
Caro Baroja stated frankly that he did not wish to be involved
 
with the program in an official capacity for various reasons,
 
but that he would gladly give me advice and contacts,  arrange
 
for us to borrow his brother's films,  etc.
 I told him about
 
Araadeo de Larrea,  and asked his opinion of him.
 Baroja said,
 
that all in all,  Larrea was probably the best person
 
to be our official collaborator in Spain,  and confirmed the fact
 
that he knows the field well.
 Baroja and his brother do not
 
have his kinds of contacts all over Spain.
 Their fortds are
 
the Basque country,  MxxxxxNavarre,  and Huelva.
 
Following is a summayy of his suggestions:
 
AX
 Spain-Americas
 
Huelva  (Andalucia)  - one of the most important direct
 
links to the Americas.
 Sailors from this province
 
went to coastal S. America and the Carribbean.
 
Canaries - another direct route to America,  still active.
 
Venezuela  (
still going),  Peru,  Carribbean.
 
In Peru there is identical architecture from the Colonial
 
period.
 
Galicia and Asturias - Cuba
 
Valencia - veridies that the music isstylistically related
 
to Mexico.
 
Basques.
 To locate Basques and Navarref
tmos,  look for
 
religious brotherhoods  (cofradias),  such as S. Fermin
 
S.  Ignacio,  and those named for provincial patron
 
saints.
 
George Foster worked with Baroja at the Smithsonian on
 
Spain-New World ethnology.+..
,
 
aroja says that Foster has much
 
of the material they gathere
 which has not yet been published.
 
He also has photographs which' might be of interest to us for
 
exhibition.
 It might be usedul to contult with Foster on the
 
Hispanixkc program.
 He has worked in Spain and Mexico,  and probably
 
elsewhere,  and is xxf  (or was)  a follower of Rbt. Redfield's.
 
5.
 Jesus Antonio Cid - Prof. at Menendez Pidal Seminary,  Univer.
 
of Madrid.
 Specializes in Re ballads from the literary point
 
of view.
 Recommended by Baroja as possible alternative to
 
de Larrea as a guide.
 
I saw Cid on Oct.  31,  and he was able to give me xwsome
 
names and advice.
 He does not know the field, however,  outside
 
of Castille,  and kis is not particularly interested in music.
 
6.
 Joaquin Diaz
 
awxgxixx2 Joaqu inr said that he would not'be free to travel
 
with me.
 He too
 ja
i
 ,ithe field "Vo u
r outside of the
 
Castillian regions.
 A asked him if he would be interested in
 
coming to the festival as co-presenter,  and to accompany the
 
group,  and if he would be willing to do some follow up work and
 
douple checking when I am goie.
 He said that wa he would,  but
 
that,  for reasons similar to these of CB, would not be able to
 
act as an official rep. of the government.
 He would volunteer
 
services here,  and,  if this is possible to arrange, maakxxsx join
 
the festival in the U.S. on his own hook.
 He will be going to
 
the U.S. anyway to give some concerts,  before the Hispanic week
 
begins.
 He is going to write to Ralph this weekend.
 
I went with Joaquin to Valladolid,  and from there we made
 
three daylong excursions to vllages and towns in that area.  (
 
(
Segovia,  Salamanca,  and Puebla de Sanabria).
 I discover that
 
kmwaxmxxyoxx whatever way you ride,  iks takes a long time to
 
get anywhere here.
 We heard a master dulzaina player,  too old
 
to come,  but excellent.
 Also a pipe and tabor player who was
 
extremely good in Salamanca.
 And two bagpipers in the Zamora
 
region--wxaone sings as he playas, and the other haxoften has
 
someone singing along with him.
 They are both excellent.
 Tambo.rine
 
and drum players,  singers and dancers are also to be found in the
 
same f
rillages.
 
Joaquin was xaxxk tex
b]i 
p ul an
 
kind.
 He has also
 
given me some names.
 Ap o' s, you m ght pass the word on kka
 
o'�
 icI 4
,rd Stark,  and anyone else who might be contacting Basques,
 
4,
g w an instuument called and albaca made of two small
 
horns,  which sounds a little lake a small bagpipe.
 I think it
 
comes from the North Basque country,  but unfortunately don-
,t have
 
those notes with me,  and so ca nt be sure.
 
On Nov.  3
, Joaquin came to Garcia Miranda;s office with me
 
to disuass
 the possibility of his acting as pxsxaxkax co presenter
 
at the festival.
 Since the For.
 Min.  is sponsoring us,  they
 
want to meet and chekk out anyone who is involved.
 We told GM
 
that Joaquin had to be in America during the summer,  Rox on business
 
of his own,  and would be free to join the group at the festival.
 
At this meeting I also introduced the idea of having GM de Larrea
 
as our official collaborator in Spain, with Joaquin as an unofficial
 
back up.
 GM knows of him, but does not know him personally.
 He
 
thinks that de Larreax is an expert,  and said that he would be
 
named director of the project,  implying that daxkaxx he would
 
have tkaultimate choice in manes naming the participants,  etc.
 
a

6.
 
If Joaquin comes,  he will be a very good person to offset
 
de Larrea's bad qualities,  should they surface.
 If I had
 
more time here,  I could do without him,  and ask for a follow
 
up/official person after the fact,  because  I
 *now have
 
enough leads.
 If you have any advice on this whole thing,
 
let me know.
 I called Alan last week about it,  andxhx(he
 
worked with Larrea w here a little)  and he said that I should
 
go ahead with him.
 
I
'm sorry to have to throw  all of these complications
 
at you,  but I thought you sho uld know exactly what wxsxgOiN+5
 
axthe situhtion is.

 She is the

40 years ago).
 
I have had two interviews with her,  and found her to
 
be
 
�
 one of the most intelligent,
 
amiable and helpful persons I have met here.
 She understood
 
immediately that what we wf
fxe are looking for is not one of
 
her groups,  and notwithstanding has given me the names of
 
people in all of the regions I plan to visit, with letters
 
of introduction to people who can take me around.
 She has
 
offered to drive me severaY

 earby
, herself,  and also
 
offered,  should the de Larrea business prove too trying,to

 She is an interesting woman,  and I
 
like her very much.

 Money: 
I have had to give Mari Carmen de Jerez $50.00 for a set
 
of records that Ralph ordered.
 As I have already spent the
 
mngxy amount alotted to me for documentation on tapes,  yransformer,
 
film, bayteries,  xeroxing,  etc.  Therefore,  please do ask Ralph
 
to send $50.00 to me here to cover the records.

Dear Dick,
 
Something I did n
't do before leaving Rome in such a hurry
 
was to give you a summary of what we decided on as the Italian
 
component of t
Ye festival, and of m
t
i- meeting with Grassi Orsini.
 
?or your records, the n
 
Festival parti-
�ipantsi
 
1
.  Liguria (Genova).  Group of 7-8 singers in the polyphonic style
 
known in t
he region as trallalero.
 
2
.  Puglie (Carpino, Gargano).  5 peoplei  chitarra battente, castagnette,
 
tamburello, singer, dancers.  Tarantella, conzune a
nd seranades,
 
in the Greek influenced style of the i
t-Rion.

(Naples, city).  1 burrattinaio, or rand puppet^er, in the real urban
 
folk tradition.
 
4
. Sardinia (C agliari).  1 U tieddas (
tripile flute)player.
 
5
.  Sicily (Palermo).  1 carrittiere singer.  2 singers of field and
 
other work songs.
 
T
(7r Ui  2
3, plus two to accompany them.
 
Meeting with Consigliere Grassi Orsini, Oct. 29, 1975 at
 
the Ministerio degli Affari Esteri.  Cons. Parricchi also present.
 
1
.  I have Grassi the above list, and he said that he would begin immediately
 
to contact each of the five regional govermentzs involved.  As you know,
 
the regional governments will be asked to pay the Gravel expenses of
 
participants to add from the U
-S., and compensation fvv lost work t
ime.
 
Sig. Grassi said that h
e would have no trouble with Puglie and Liguria,
 
and that the others would probably agree because the figures involved
 
for such small groups is very low.
 
Mr. Arnd
.t--2.
 
2
.  At Grassi's request I have asked the Smithsonian to send
 
him, via the Embassy, six complete information and public
 
relations packages on the festival a
nd the tour, so that he
 
can give them to the regiona
l  representatives.  He also said
 
that t
?e film would be useful in his campaign, and that he will
 
borrow it from Recupero (
that is, the copy the Smithsonian is
 
s
ending to the Museum) for that purpose.
 
3
.  Grassi and Parricchi estimated that they would have replies
 
from the regional governments in about ten days.  '
`ovld you
 
be so kind as to call bn about November 10th to ask him about
 
this?  If Grassi has not been able to persuade all of t
he
 
regions involved to contribute to expenses, I would like to
 
know whether he thinks it would be effective for me or for
 
a representative of the Museum to pay them a personal visit,
 
if this is possible.
 
4
.  I told Grassi that only the Llgurians had been reimbursed
 
for lost work t
ime last summer, and that Annabella Rossi was
 
unwilling to begin work for this year until the others were
 
paid as well.  Grassi promisee
, to lock into this immediately,
 
sayinjz that there had been a
n oversight.
 
Perhaps you can pass all of the above on to Arlette,
 
with ny regards.
 
Thanks again for the elegant :

Galicia i �a green,/
 '
mountainous,  riverine land, misty
 
and mild weathe
 
immigration 5i
b
�road has been heavy.
 
The,lpeople are very poor,  even now,  and
 
(
2 ,yin destinations of
 
inL,igrants have been Cuba, Venezuela,  Peru,  the Uniteyk States,
 
and 1
,i
exico.)
 Gal/cians resent the
 
gdvernment bccau�e they
 
feel it has neglected their beauti
"ful corner of the country add
 
forced many of them to leave it.
 I found Galicians to be open,
 
kind of silky-natured people--and so they are known in the rest of
 
Spain.
 
i
,i
ens is a small agricult,�
:cal village in the province of
 
Coruna, near the seacoast.
 '
t
'ypi'cally,  the people Deep co/ws,
 
goats,  pigs and a few sheep,,and cultivate potatoes,  co in,
 
vegetables,  beans,  and apple trees on a s
inall family,`scale.
 Until
 
recently,  flax was grown here,  and the women would spin and
 
weave their own linen.
 Some of the men leave their farms and
 
take t 4he sea for part of the year.
 Houses are made of granite,
 
and as in all of North Spain,  they are of two storiess
 
the
 
anii:ials living downstairs and the peo _
ple upstairs.
 '
lie harvest
 
is stored in miniature houses elevated about six feet from the
 
ground to keep out the rats and moist)
 
l
k
 
- 2
 
locally
 arved granite crosses.
 Even the fields are fenced
 
with
 in slabs of granite,  standing upright  in the earth like
 
gravestones.
 The music of Galicia is Celtic--closely related
 
to thAk  of  Scotland and I- reland.
 '
The jota of this town is
 
identical in rhythm andstyle of singing  (high,  shrill feminine
 
choruses) with the songs of  the Asturian vaqueiros, or cattle
 
herders--one of the few peoples remaining in Lurope practising
 
full transhumance.
 
Participants: 
2 women who sing coplas (verses of  four lines;  also,  to
 
versify), and play panderetas (tamborines)  to accompany the i
:
i u
r
1
 i
1
 eira
  
and the  jota. 
4 dancers--two men and tv:
, women.
 At least one of  these,
 
Teresa Larela,  sings and plays pandereta also.
 
Repertoire:
 
Nuneira - the dance most typical of Galicia,  accompanied
 
by two women singing and playing s
:n mleretas in fast 6/8 rhythm.
 
In I
•
iens,  the muneira calla for two couples in order to work out
 
the figures of the dance.
 
Jotas, of several different kinds,  accoit-panied in the
 
same way as the above,  with two or more singers.
 
Canci
.ones de I

 spinning songs - female solo) .
 
This is the alala type of song,  also typical of ;
_
�alici,---so
 
called because each verse ends with "ay la la,  Ey la la,  ay lalala-
lala la la".
 It is arhythmic,  and has a dreamy,  lyrical quality.

Asturias is with Santander the most mountainous region
 
of ;
;pain.
 Coal mining has long been an important industry
 
here,  and there are many songs about the mines.
 Cattle heirding,' 
swall scale agriculture and arboriculture are still wide-
spread.
 Asturians are ardent partisans of their music,  their
 
countryside,  t
'ieir customs,  their food,  and each other.

I see
 
the danza prima as one of the unifying everstS of the idspanic
 
program.
 _
;oth the song and the dance are easy to follow,  and
 
Flora Suarez,  with the enthusiastic help of Juan Uria,  would
 
make an excellent leader/teacher for all the hispanic partici-
pants.
 Flora has a large repertoire of other songs,  including
 
Other
 �
:sturianadas, habaneras ( a kind of song that
 
was brought back from Cuba by returning immigrants),  and game
 
songs.
 
1 asturianadas singer from Aller.
 
e s
 
d; Aller
 
The asturianadas is a lyric song consisting of one
 
verse,  in free rhythm,  extended,  legato,  and highly melismatic.
 
It is the northern equivalent to the cante jondo, or "great
 
..mgll of Andalusia.
 Like canto jondo, and like the blues,  it
 
is a song of exceptional feeling.
 In the Nortli,  however,  singing
 
voices are open and .
resonant,  rather than constricted and nasal,
 
as they are in the ;
south.
 i
3ecause of their rei�iarkablc beauty
 
- 5 -
 
and style,  the asturianadas have long been  sung by professie..ials
 
and semi- professionals,  and thus to some degree declined in
 
purity.
 In Aller the song style and the texts are the oldest
 
and most genuine in hsturias.
 There one still hears the velada, 
or covered voice quality that distinguishes the true folk
 
asturianadas singer from the brassier vocal style of professionals.
 
1 bagpiper:
 possibly,  '
semis uballe,  Cangas de unis,  uviedo.
 
Known as the best bagpiper in Asturias toaay.

S-
Dear Mr. Rinzler,
 
I hope that once you have this letter in your hands, you
 
have received the first report from Mr. Salvador Ortega.
 
I am writing to tell you that the work is going at a good
 
pace, and I am certain that the bilingual pamphlet will be
 
ready for the final days of June.
 
Since your letter gives us the impression that you still
 
lack confidence in our criteria for selection, once again I will
 
enumerate the groups which have been selected (
and which will
 
be approved by Arthur Waxman).
 
1
) The coastal region of Veracruz - The "
jarocho"sound

.Mariach1- guitar, a five string guitar or huapanguera
  
(Huapango is a Mexican dance)  and a violin,
 
From this region there will also be a pair of dancers who only
 
interpret the Huastecan sound.
 
3)tegionof Guerreran Tierra Caliente
  
Group of 5 musicians who play the following instruments:
 
2 violins, small  drum, guitar and large guitar
 
4) Region of Michoacan Tierra Caliente
 
Large harp group composed of 5 musicians who play the following
 
instruments:
 
Y
 
2 violins, guitarra de golpe, large harp and a luro
 
This group was selected in place of the traditional Mariachi
 
group (which is composed of 3 or 4 stringed instruments) from
 
the south of Jalisco
 
I
t must be reemphasized that both musical rei ons  (
Tierra
 
Caliente Michoacana and the south of Jalisco), basically share
 
the same musical tradition since both the instruments and repertoire
 
are the same.
 A basic difference lies in the use of the harp;  the
 
group from Michoacan uses this instrument for percussion - i
.e.  the body of
 
the harp is knocked or beaten to keep time.
 
The f
our groups above mentioned will offer a panorama of
 
the Mexican sound; an interesting and comparative vision of t
hat
 
great tradition.  This way, the American audience will be able
 
to hear very varied music from a common race.
 
S
till unsure is the definite selection of the musicians
 
who play "chirimia" and drum ( although they have already been
 
found);  we are waiting for Arthur Waxman's opinion, whom we
 
have been unable to find.
 
Finally, I would like you to know that until now, Mr. Salvador Ortega
 
has received no correspondence concerning the payment of his fees.
 
With no more to say for the moment, I close, attentively,
 
Irene Vasquez
