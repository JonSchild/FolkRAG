Biographical Info and Early Memories Racing 
 
 
Growing up in Lewiston (Ransomville Area) 
Father (Paul) ran Pro Stocks & later Street Stocks in Late 90s, and going to track 
with him: Merritville, Humberstone, and Ransomville 
Helped dad with stuff in the pits, around 12 or 13: with it always being a small 
group  
 
[2:15]  
First Time Behind the Wheel & Starting in the 4 Banger Class 
Story of going to Ohsweken track with his dad, and his dad letting him run out 
and taking the car around in hot laps: his first experience behind a car being a 
street stock 
The first experience behind the wheel planting that ‘bug’ in him for racing 
Running go karts and stuff from other friends every once in awhile 
When turned 17, started with endure cars and then in 2007 – with the 4 banger 
class being added to Ransomville, ran it from then on 
 
[5:35]  
Description of the Enduro Class  
Walkthrough description of the enduro class and difference with the 4 banger 
class 
 
[6:25] 
Interview pause, sudden lake storm blowing in, relocating – wind noise increase from 
this point on. 
 
 
 
[6:55]  
Resumption of Interview, Walkthrough of Enduro Class & 4 Banger Class 
Talking about welding a roll cage in the 4 banger class, and how they built / put 
together the car 
Difference in engine size for some of the  
How the 4 banger class has changed over years: example of car brands changing 
over the years in terms of seeing more from one maker per track now. 
Difference between 4 banger and purpose built race cars: 4 bangers built on a 
street car suspension that is then welded on, not like modifieds or sportsman 
where they are built onto a frame 
Difference in car counts over the years, and cobalts, acura and Hondas being the 
main cars now, where the cavalier (which he still runs) is not as popular 
anymore 
Finding parts for the cavalier from junkyards, and difficulty in finding them over 
the years 
Stock motors, with addition of cold air intake (or leave in stock one): description 
of modifications that you make to the street car for racing, and how it’s changed 
over the years 
 
[13:30]  
Setting Up a Car for Short Track or Long Track 
Different tracks having some different rules in 4 Banger / Mini Stock class, so 
some might build different cars for each 
Different costs between racing tires and DOT (standard tires) and some tracks 
having racing tires, and others having DOT 
Discussion of why he likes to stick with the Cavalier, even though parts are 
starting to get scarce 
Walkthrough of having a car setup for a track in Canada and one at Ransomville: 
having two cars ready for racing 
 
[17:30]  
Maintaining a 4 Banger / Mini Stock 
During the off season, making larger changes on either of the cars as more time 
available in not needing to get car ready for that weekend 
During the season, fixing parts as they break: discussion of problem with the 
main car trying to work through and figure out.  
Discussion of identifying an issue (overheating and then electrical) and how they 
figured it out 
Importance of trying to maintain and fix the car during the week, and checking 
things every week, instead of leaving it on trailer and trying to fix it at the track 
Difference in maintaining a modified or sportsman compared to a Mini Stock: 
modified and sportsman being almost another 40 hours a week to maintain, Mini 
Stock only needing a night or two usually 
Difficulty in maintaining a car and family obligations (e.g. a son’s sports game). 
 
 
[22:15]  
Order of Maintaining a Car & Car Setup Staying Consistent 
Walkthrough of not being a fixed list (other than tires off first) – but having a 
general checklist of what should be checked / maintained 
 
[24:20]  
Walkthrough of Race Day (pre-Race and Arrival) 
 
 
Coordinating work schedule with his dad, having car hooked up and in the  
Trailer (works on car at his parent’s/childhood home) 
Working in West Seneca (about a 50 minute drive) and racing a Friday: difficulty 
of sometimes hitting traffic and needing his dad to go ahead to the track and pull 
his number – his ‘race before the race’: getting to the track sometimes around 
6:15 (draws for cars happens at 6) 
Description of Handicap System and importance of starting position (that some 
can be made up, but is a challenge to go from like 12th to 1st) 
Mini stocks not having assigned positions, but parking wherever: in previous 
years parking in the back, now parking on the side 
Pulling in and hooking up a transponder, final check on fuel and equipment, 
placing things on  
Referencing board in the pits for placement 
 
[31:30]   
Post-Race Routine & Reflections on Racing 
Dad and him sticking around after races, being one of the last trailers as they like 
hanging out in the pits and talking with other drivers: esp. Brian Melcher who 
parks in pits next to them. 
Post-race conversations, ribbing, and helping out with other drivers - include 
talking about the race and exchanging advice with other drivers too. 
Focusing on advice from only one or two people mostly 
Racing is all about ‘Competition’ - it’s about beating the best car, so the fun from 
his perspective is there being 2-4 cars that could win any given night.  
Fun in competitive battles during a race, even if battling for a position in the mid 
or back field 
Difficulty in dirt tracks in keeping cars from hitting / bouncing into one another, 
and sometimes mistakes happening too, as conditions or equipment can change 
during a race (i.e. something breaks) 
 
[35:42]  
Driving Style and Enjoyment in Racing 
Ryan’s driving style being more conservative, as if running for a points title, it’s a 
sprint not a marathon: so always trying to calculate who need to beat or not and 
by how much, and if need to let someone pass or not.  
Don’t have to win every week, but importance of finishing in the top five every 
week to stay in it. 
Trying to be easy on equipment, as when thing’s break it’s more money out of 
your pocket  
Racing being a ‘hobby’ not a career, and the difficulty of pouring money into it 
and keeping costs in perspective, as they’re winning/racing usually for only 200 
bucks or so - winnings rarely ever make back the amount you put back in: but 
the fun of it can’t put a price on it. 
 
[38:45]  
Skills & Things Paid Attention to During a Race 
Importance of instinct in racing, knowing the certain spots you like to hit going 
into each turn - when let gas on or off, etc. 
Peripheral vision and its role during a race, especially with the neck bracing: 
paying attention to not the car directly in front if you’re in the midfield, but two 
or three cars ahead to try and avoid race.  
Eyes and being intensely focused, darting around and looking everywhere. 
Memorial race and racing against cars don’t usually run against being 
particularly fun. 
Looking at track before hand, mostly watching the class before to see how 
they’re handling and interacting with the track 
Balancing tire pressure depending on track conditions, but when it gets hot track 
stays a bit more consistent week in week out. 
Track in May or September different than June, July, August, etc. when the sun is 
baking the water out of the track, so gets bit more slick, and lap times aren’t as 
fast as in beginning or end of season. 
 
[45:00]  
Stagger and Continuation of Driving Skills 
Stagger in Mini Stocks being relatively new ; stagger allowing for cars to lean a 
bit more into the corners,  
Running against people for a long time, and learning other people’s driving 
habits and other people learning his style 
Racing and knowing when to ‘finish’ in spot, if there’s a car you just can’t catch 
ahead of you, especially if a car you know is setup lightning fast is behind you, 
that you won’t be able to catch if it gets out ahead of you 
 
[48:50]   
Changes in Mini Stock Cars 
 
 
Discussion of changes and differences in Mini Stock 
Mini Stocks being FWD, while other classes like Sportsman or Modified or RWD; 
so there’s a difference in that the FWD, your car is kind of being pulled through 
the corner by the front, where the RWD car is more thrown into the corner and 
pushed out by the rear 
That when you turn the wheel in a Mini Stock you’re turning, where Modified’s 
or Sportsman can setup front tires almost pointing in different direction 
 
[51:30]  
Challenges in Racing 
If moving up in a division that could be a challenge, or to a different car or 
chassis 
Finding parts for the Cavalier can be difficult too, so sometimes end up buying a 
part if its particularly hard to find, and trying to do that saturday morning: as 
sometimes need parts right away 
Part issues possibly means in few years will move on from cavalier to the chevy 
cobalt - and looking for parts at parts stores and at Junkyard, and being able to 
still find them though is getting more difficult year in year out 
Discussion of impact of covid, and the challenge in getting sponsorships, but 
importance of them (especially year in year out sponsors) - a lot of sponsorships 
at the level tend to be family or friends or businesses 
Personally that he kicks in a lot to  
Difference in importance of sponsorships from Mini Stock level to Modifieds and 
Sportsman, due to number of things run through 
For general public, understanding that racing is more than NASCAR, and is 
actually predominantly like the type of dirt track racing or smaller racing 
 
[59:10]  
Looking Forward - Things Looking to do in Future 
Running again at Oshweken or Humberstone, and doing just one year of 
traveling and going around and just racing at a number of different tracks: 
loading up trailer and just running at all these different tracks to see and being 
on the road 
Going to run at few different tracks every year, in 2021 including Canandaigua  
Not enjoying running Hangover or Enduro classes really - in that they’re fun to 
watch, but wouldn’t run in them himself 
Getting help from Brother, and other drivers like Brian Melcher and Chris Leone, 
who help out on the car 
Driver’s being pretty close knit group in Mini Stock, and always chatting with 
one another outside of the race on weekends too about help or parts 
 
[1:03:00] 
Favorite Racing Memories and Close Calls and Wrecks 
One of his favorite memories is him and his dad racing and running against him, 
there being a few times in past year’s they ran against each other 
Story of one time his dad rolling a car in a race they were both competing in, and 
worrying about if he was alright or not, as only saw it out the corner of his eye, 
as he was passing him 
One of his other favorite memories being running against Gordie Gowe (sp?) and 
battling for position throughout an entire race, and that leading to a long 
friendship 
Story of worst wreck he’s been in, including Steve Matson (who got the worst of 
it). 
Opening night always being really the most fun, as in offseason mostly just 
communicating by distance with other drivers, but opening night everyone is all 
together 
Camaraderie and fun behind racing, keeping it going - that racing is a ‘part of 
him’: e.g. don’t do anything Friday night because Ryan’s going to the track 
 
[1:11:15] 
Advice for Prospective Racers 
Know what you are getting into that, that once you start it can be very hard to 
stop (i.e. it can eat up so much of your time), but if get involved either go big or 
don’t, because you want to be competitive and best of your ability 
Importance of homework (e.g. watching videos of prior races) and track time in 
being competitive week in week out, especially with reviewing and seeing where 
made mistakes or where to improve 
Seeing the success of other driver’s, and the ones who are always chasing titles 
(in the class), that you always have to do that stuff (all that time outside of racing 
itself) and constantly looking to improve, even though racing only for $200 
winnings in Mini Stock class 
“You want to be better, but you don’t want to spend a million dollars doing it” 
 
[1:16:30] 
Community, Ransomville Speedway, and Closing Remarks 
At local tracks like Ransomville, there’s always that sense of family but also the 
competitive side, almost a ‘frenemy’ relationship: during a race competitive and 
battling as hard as can, but after can share beer and just talk 
Story of how his dad got his number, 31a - “3 Kids, 1 Wife, 1 A**hole”) 
Story of how he started out, there was a fireball class where no letter, so he 
wasn’t able to run 32a: in the winter his grandfather passed away at 93 years old, 
so he chose number 93, and it’s just stuck since 
Story of the Mr. Peanut association and nickname, and with his last name being 
Plante, his nickname during high school was always Planters: Dave Buchanan 
saw it on his car one year, and came up with that nickname Mr. Peanut -- he’s 
embraced it and you’ll see it everywhere on his cars.  
Story of Mike Paul doing a vinyl job (peanuts all around the car), based off a joke 
at the Superbowl that Mr. Peanut was going to ‘die’ (i.e. that Planter’s was going 
to retire the mascot): Mike Paul bet that if they didn’t get rid of Mr. Peanut, he’d 
do a free vinyl job/graphic for him with the peanuts (ended up having to do it as 
Planter’s didn’t get rid of it).
