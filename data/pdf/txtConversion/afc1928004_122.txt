BROKEN DOWN, 
Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seems to know me, 
I'm completely broken down 
CUORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frozn, 
No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to 
fast' instead. 
I 
wander, dra. 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says, 
All the world's a 
stage' 
And every man must play his part. 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of days gone by, 
How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I 
I
MOW, 
My part' has been ' the fool.' 
I 
wander, dsc. 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat, 
But when I 
had no ' Note to change,' 
How soon they changed their note 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A 
living paradox am I, 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.' 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
The time to try your friends you'll Cult; 
Is when you're broken down.

A NEW SONG ON SONGS. 
I 
knew that I 
was dreaming, 
When I 
went up in a 
balloon ; 
Along with Betsy Bangle, 
To take tea with The Man in the Moon. 
The Girl of the Period was there, 
With the Young Man of the Day ; 
Saying Don't you wish that you was me, 
For I'm going to be married to- day. 
Cnoans.—For these are the comic songs, 
As sung at the present time; 
I've put them together so clever, my Boys, 
And sing them all in rhyme. 
The Great Men said, Turn him out, 
But Don't you run away ; 
With the Pride of Baker's Row, 
And be found All among the hay. 
Said the Racketty SwelIto the Polisher's Daughter, 
Courting was the worst of fun ; 
And went strolling in the Burlington, 
To be thought the Swell A. 1. [For these are. & c. 
I 
never go East of Temple Bar, 
Except Down Petticoat Lane, 
To see the Shokeloney swell, 
For she sighs for him in vain. 
Said Artful Joe to Brigham Young 
We'll go te Rosherville; 
With my own Sweet Susan Jane, 
And the Man that can't keep still. [For these are,&c, 
Up in the Monument. I 
drink Clicquot, 
With the Virgin 19 years old; 
The go Rolling lunne in the morning Boys, 
Singing All that Glitters is not Gold, 
I 
should like to be an Aligator, 
And Down in a 
Diving Bell, 
And try a 
little Bathing, Boys, 
Along with Nancy Bell. [For these are, & c. 
Said Jolly Joe to the Pride of the Ladies, 
Turn it up, and Persevere, 
Then Let us be jolly, and drink Moet and Shandon, 
Over Trifles lie- lit as air. 
It's naughty, but it's very nice, 
Said Mv own Sweet Sally dear, 
And Pin in love with Alice, Boys, 
So Take my advice, Stand clear. 
For these cre, &c. 
OUR FLAG IS THERE. 
Our flag is there 
our flag is there 
We'll hail it with three loud huzzas! 
Our flag is there ! our flag is there ! 
Behold the glorious stripes and stars 
Stout hearts have fought for that bright flag, 
Strong bands sustained it mast head high, 
And oh ! to see how proud it waves, 
Brings tears of joy to ev'ry eye. 
Cuoans.—Our flag is there! our flag is there! 
We'll hail it with three loud huzzas! 
Our flag is there! Our flag is there ! 
Behold the glorious stripes and stars. 
That flag has stood the battle's roar, 
With foetnan stout, with foemen brave. 
Strong hands have sought that flag to lover, 
And found a 
speedy, watery grave! 
That flag is known on ey'ry shore, 
The standard of a 
gallant band, 
Alike unstain'd in peace or war, 
It floats o'er freedom's happy laud. 
OH ! SUMMER NIGHT. 
Serenade in "DON PASQUALE." 
Oh, summer night, so softly bright, 
how sweet the bower, where sleeps the cradled flow'r. 
The light gale hies to rock her bed, 
And scatter dew around her head; 
Then o'er her flying, she whispers sighing, 
Sleep on till morning light, sweet flow'r, good night. 
Sweet flow'r good night, sweet flow'r good night, 
Sweet flow'r good night, good night, good night. 
No spoiler shall come near thee, lullaby, 
No blight shall dare to sere thee, lullaby. 
Ohl summer night, so softly bright, 
How sweet the bower, where sleeps thy cradled flow'r, 
The light gale hies to rock her bed, 
And scatter dew around her head, 
The bud reposes, her veil she closes, 
The gale sighs round with softer sound. 
Sweet flow'r, good night, till morning light, 
Sweet flow'r, good night, good night, good night. 
Thy beauty's spell will charm thee, lullaby, 
No stormy winds shall harm thee, lullaby, 
Sweet flow'r good night, good night.

Onr village is surely the sw eetest on eardi. 
'Tis the spot I

So clear are our streamlets, so verdant our shades, 
So brave are our youth, and so fair are our maids.

COREY DICK. 
Written by ALBERT DE 
Voy. 
Air.—" Ikey Green." 
0, they call me Cokey Dick, 
And they say I 
am a 
brick, 
And selling coke you know it is my game; 
I 
should be a 
fiat to fret, 
While a 
living I 
can get, 
.For me the rough or smooth, it's all the same. 
CHORES. 
Air.—" Apples Four a 
Penny." 
I 
rise up in the morning, 
When early day is dawning, 
Coke I 
goes a 
bawling, 
With voice so loud and high ; 
To serve you well I'm willing, 
A 
sack full for a 
shilling, 
Now who'll make a 
beginning, 
A shilling a 
sack I 
cry. 
Now ray Sally keeps a 
shop, 
Sells nuts, cakes and Ginger-pop, 
Garraway comfits, almond rock and apples too, 
So if we goes on so well, 
Make a 
fortune soon we shall, 
And round Spitalfields I'm known to all of you. 
Spoken.—Why yes, of course I 
is, and I 
can tell you my 
Rum culs that me and my Sally is doing a 
dol trick, oh, talking 
of dl s 
that just reminds me of my Sally, now you see she had 
a 
proper dolly and did a clumping trade with the kids on 
Sundays; yes, the little soft cakes they used to go down the 
dolly for Butter cakes, but my Sall never let 'em win, not like-
ly ; 
But my Sally got afrightened of the D's so she turned the 
dolly up, still for all that we are doing very well, because  
I 
rise up in the morning, &e. 
[
11 
When the cock begins to crow, 
To the market off I 
go, 
And gets in a 
stock for Sally's litttle shop ; 
Then with my coke I 
goes around, 
With my voice so loud and sound, 
And if I 
meets a 
pal we always have a 
drop. 
Spoken.— Yes, there's nothing like a 
pal, I 
always use a 
pal 
well, I 
runs 'ern in cheap, sometimes I 
runs Albert De Voy in 
• 6 
sacks for 6 
bob, th at's 
cos he'
s a pa l-o-
in i
ne but if any 
swell 
cove wants 6 sacks, why I 
always charges him seven and a 
kick, and takes care always to knock off all the top lumps and 
put them under the sacks for myself, and that's how it is I 
dues 
so well because  
I 
rise up in the morning, &e. 
Now my mare she's good and kind, 
Tho' poor thing she has gone blind, 
But for trotting, any odds on her I'll lay; 
Tho' I 
know she's getting old, 
Still she's worth her weight in gold, 
For she's in her harness fourteen hours ev'ry day. 
Spoke.—And lord love you is'nt she a 
stunner to go, you 
ought to see me, and Toni and Dick, and our old woman when 
we are going for a 
drive round to see Albert n Voy, we 
generally give him a 
call when we goes down the Lea Bridge 
Road, and doesn't my old mare know when Sally is behind her, 
see her trot, then when we gets back I 
put the mare in the 
stable and goes into the Red Lion, has a 
little drop, goes home 
and then 
I 
rise up in the morning, &T.

Rid no smile and smile for thee; 
Now the bloom is on the cherry,

To my wild impassioned lay. 
Whilst the crystal waters glisten 
In the sparkling starlit bay,

We had not sail'd long before we did espy

At the hour of twelve, Pierce came along-side,

Quick, give me an answer; I

We fought them five glasses, five glasses most hot,

JOE PICKLES, OR THE GOOSE CLUB. 
As sung by TEDDY MOSEDALE. 
Joe Pickles to his wife did say, 
On the first of last September, 
'Twas banyan time last Christmas day, 
Old gal if you remember, 
This year may bring the same ill-luck, 
So to insure some spruce grub, 
Says Joe, 
I'll tell you what, my duck, 
VII go and join a 
Goose Club.' 
Ri tol the rd l 
the riddle lol, &c. 
Now Mrs. Pickles gave consent, 
Scarce knowing what it all meant, 
To the Dog and Dishelout off Joe went 
And paid his first instalment ; 
He went on regular you'll believe, 
And didn't lie go spruce, out 
At eight o'clock on Christmas eve, 
And thawed his monster goose out. 
Ri tol the rol, &c. 
He called together such a 
host, 
His Uncles, Aunts and Cousin, 
With himself and wife there was quite a 
dose, 
Near two thirds of a 
dozen ; 
When goosey on the spit was staked, 
Cries Joey," dash my gaiters, 
If I 
shouldn't like to have it baked, 
Over sixteen pounds of taters." 
Ri tol the rol, tEc 
Down sat the rough and ready lot, 
Wide awake was each looking, 
The goosey came up hissing hot, 
Cries Joey, " We'll soon cook him." 
With a 
carving fork lie made a 
deuce 
Of a 
plunge, nut his lady, 
She thought he'd struck a 
tailor's goose, 
What never carries gravy. 
Ri tel the rol, &c. 
Says Joe, " I 
hope it's done enough 
That's what I 
do, my flowers, 
Cries Mrs P. " don't talk such stuff, 
It has been down thirteen hours ;"

ke tried again the bird to halve, 
It made him puff and falter, 
He might as well have tried to carve, 
The rock of Gibralter. 
Ri tel the rol. (tc. 
We'll manage it, exclaimed the wives, 
And quickly walled their chalks up, 
But they over him broke a 
dozen knives, 
And doubled all their forks tip; 
The precious bird was getting cold, 
They eyed each other queerly. 
The beggar must have been as old 
As the monument or nearly. 
Ri tel the rol, 
Old Joe began to curse the things, 
His Nunky brought a 
hatchet, 
And tried to lop off one of his wings, 
But no-how could detach it; 
The old man warm began to wax, 
Worn out with chopping, hacking and 
At last he got an old pick-axe, 
And tried to break his back in. 
Hi tel the rol, &c. 
He fetched him such a 
nasty knock, 
As hard as lie was able, 
The' goosey stood it like a 
cock, 
In two he split Joe's table ; 
Below down rolled the ancient quack, 
And so raw at being bitten, 
Joe danced a 
hornpipe on his back, 
And it bore him like a 
Briton. 
Ri tel the rol, & c.• 
There was no alternative to choose, 
They were forced to dine off the stuffin', 
'Cos barring this antidiluvian goose, 
They hadn't got not nothilf;

You have no right to boll°, 
At all events ' twon't be amiss, 
To have a

"Ile sends rue to thee with this willow wreath, 
To recall the fond words he used to breathe, 
He will wed one as fair as thou to day ; 
And he gives me to woo thee, if so I 
may," 
" 
That willow wreath I 
need not wear : 
For this do thy tell-tale eyes declare— 
Let him wed his fair maid, and to her be true— 
SO 
now thou mayst woo me, and win me too."

Soft o'er the fountain,

THE SWITZER'S FAREWELL. 
By Go. LINLEY. 
Adieu, dear land, with beauty teeming, 
Where first I 
rov'd a 
careless child; 
Of thee my heart will e'er be dreaming. 
Thy snow-clad peaks and mountains wild. 
Dear land I 
that. I 
cherish, 
Oh I 
long may'st thou flourish ; 
My memory must perish, 
Ere I 
forget thee. 
Far from my home I 
soon must wander, 
In stranger land be doomed to dwell, 
0 ! best beloved I 
my heart grows fonder, 
While thus I 
breathe my last farewell. 
Receive this sad token, 
I 
leave thee heart-broken, 
Our parting is 
Beloved one, farewell ! 
I'M A TIMID, NERVOUS MAN. 
I 
always was a 
timid man, 
And nervous from my birth, 
And nervousness I 
think is worse 
Than anything on earth ; 
For go to do w 
hat'er you will, 
You're sure to do it wrong. 
I 
hope it won't attack me now, 
And spoil are in my song. 
So if you will attentive be, 
I'll do the best I 
can, 
To tell to you the sorrows of 
Cuoiws.— 
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, 
A 
timid nervous man. 
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, 
A timid nervous man. 
I 
met a 
most delightful girl, 
Out at a 
ball one night, 
I 
felt my peace of mind was gone, 
When first she came in sight; 
I 
wanted to be introduced, 
And Brown soon did the job, 
By saying " Miss Jeinima Green, 
My friend young Richard Cobb." 
I 
said " a 
lovely morning, Miss," 
No ? no, I 
don't mean that, 
It's night of course, Pin quite aware. 
But have you seen the cat ? 
nei 
No doubt she thought it very strarge, 
That I 
should talk such stuff, 
And as I 
stood, I 
felt that she, 
Must think me quite a 
muff: 
I 
did not mend the matter much, 
When I 
turned round to say, 
" 
There's been a 
deal of weather, Miss, 
About the town- to-day ;" 
And having made that sage remark, 
I 
sat down in a 
chair, 
Plump into Mrs. Johnson's lap, 
Whom I 
did not see there. 
"I beg a 
thousand pardons" now 
I 
said to Mrs. J. 
Who only muttered some such word, 
As " fool" and turn'd away; 
I 
felt so flurried and confused, 
I 
turned too quickly round, 
[I'm nervous, (t, 
I'M A TIMID NERVOUS MAN. (CoNcixoEn) 
And nearly knock'd a 
fat old dame, 
Headlong, upon the ground ; 
I 
bow d 
and hoped she was not hurt, 
But what was my dismay, 
To find the waiter stood behind, 
And l'd upset his tray. 
I'm nervous, .± c. 
I 
said " Miss Green will you oblige 
Me with the next Quadrille ? 
As Waltzes— Polkas, I 
can't do, 
They always make me ill." 
But lor ! I 
could not danco at all, 
They pull'd me here and there, 
My foot caught in Jernima's dress, 
And that began to tear; 
The trimming twisted round my legs, 
In such an awful way, 
That half a 
dozen soon went down, 
And I 
atnong them lay. 
I'm nervous, & c. 
I 
rush d 
down stairs to leave the house, 
A hat and coat I 
took. 
And not ' till I 
was nearly home, 
Did I 
once at them look : 
But who can tell the shock I 
felt, 
When on the hat I 
found, 
A servant's black cockade was there, 
And gold lace band all round; 
The coat was green and trimad with red 
And liv'ry buttons bright, 
In fact it was the servant's coat 
And hat I 
took that night. 
I'm nervous, ttc. 
I 
took them back and got my OWD, 
And 'ere I 
left the door, 
There came frtm out the dram ing room, 
Of laughter quite a 
roar ; 
They put me down as " fool" of course. 
And dear Miss Green, no doubt, 
Thought me the greatest " spoon" that she 
had ever met when out; 
I 
lost the girl I 
dont upon, 
And made myself a 
fool, 
Because my nerves won't let me keep, 
Collected, calm, and cool.

SPEAK GENTLY. 
By W. V. W ALLACE. 
Speak gently ! it is better far, 
To rule by love than fear, 
Speak gently ! let not harsh words mar 
The good we might do here ; 
Speak gently I 
love cloth whisper low, 
The vow that true hearts bind, 
And gently friendship's accents flow— 
Affection's voice is kind. 
Speak gently to the little child, 
It's love be sure to gain, 
Teach it in accents soft and mild— 
It may riot long remain; 
Speak gently to the young, for they 
Will hlve enough to bear, 
Pass through this life as best they may, 
'Tis full of anxious care. 
Speak.gently to the aged one, 
Grieve not the care- worn heart, 
The sands of life are nearly run, 
Let such in peace depart ; 
Speak gently ! to the erring, know 
They may have toiled in vain, 
Perhaps unkindness made them so, 
Oh ! win them back again. 
Speak gently, kindly, to the poor, 
Let no harsh tone be heard. 
They have enough they must endure, 
Without an unkind word; 
Speak gently, ' tis a 
little t ! ling 
Dropped in the heart's deep well, 
The good, the joy which it may bring, 
Eternity shall WI,

THE FAIVITLY BIBLE. 
By T. Ittca.A.an. 
This book is all that's left me now ! 
Tears will unbidden start ; 
With faltering lip and throbbing brow, 
I 
press it to my heart : 
For many generations pass'd, 
Here is our familv tree ; 
My mother's hands this Bible clasp'd; 
She, dying, gave it me. 
Ah I 
well do I 
remember those 
Whose names those records bear; 
Who round the hearth-stone use to close. 
After the evening prayer— 
And speak of what those pages said, 
In tones my heart would thrill I 
Though they are with the silent dead 
here are they living still. 
My father read this holy book, 
To brothers, sisters dear; 
How calm was my pour mother's look, 
Who lean'd, God's word to hear. 
Her angel face, T 
see it yet 
What thronging mem'ries come I 
Ag in that little group is met 
Within the walls of home. 
Thou truest friend man ever knew, 
Thy constancy I've tried : 
Where all were false, I've found thee true, 
My counsellor and guide. 
The mines of earth no treasure give, 
That could this volume buy : 
In teaching me the way to live, 
It taught me how to die. 
BE KIND TO THE LOIPD ONES AT HOME, 
By I. B. Woormus.Y. 
Be kind to thy father, for when thutt wert young, 
Who lov'd thee so fondly as he ? 
lie caught the first accents that fell from thy tongue 
And joined in thy innocent glee. 
Be kind to thy father, for now he is old 
Ills locks intermingled with gray; 
His footsteps are feeble, once fearless and bold. 
Thy father is passing away. 
Be kind to thy mother— for lo I 
on her brew 
Nay traces of sorrow be seen; 
Oh I 
well may'st thou cherish and comfort her now, 
For loving and kind hath she been. 
Remember thy mother, for thee will she pray, 
As 
long as God giveth her breath ; 
With accents of kindness then cheer her lone way, 
E'en to the dark valley of death. 
Be kind to thy brother— his heart will have dearth, 
If the smile of thy joy be withdrawn; 
The flowers of feeling vill fade at their birth, 
If the dew of affection be gone, 
Be kind to thy brother, wherever you are, 
The love of a 
brother shall be 
An ornament purer and richer by far 
Than pearls from the depth of the sea. 
Be kind to thy sister—not many may known 
The depth of true sisterly love; 
The wealth of the ocean lies fathoms below 
The surface that sparkles above. 
Be kind to thy father, once fearless and bold, 
Be kind to thy mother so near ; 
Be kind to thy brother, nor show thy heart cold. 
Be kind to thy sister so dear.

THE DEAREST SPOT. 
By W RIGHTON. 
The dearest spot of earth to me, 
Is home, sweet home; 
The fairy land I've longed to see, 
Is home, sweet home. 
There how charm'd the sense of hearing, 
There where hearts are so endearing, 
All the world is not so cheering, 
As home, sweet home. 
I've taught my heart tIe way to pfize 
MV 
home, sweet home ; 
I've learned to look with lover's eyes 
On home, sweet home. 
There, where vows are truly plighted, 
There, where hearts are so united, 
All the world besides I've slighted, 
For home, sweet honm. 
WHERE ARE THE FRIENDS OF MY YOUTH ? 
By GEORGE BARKER. 
Where are the friends of my youth, 
Say where are those cherisii'd ones gone, 
And why have they dropp'd with the leaf, 
Air, why have they left me to mourn ; 
Their voices still sound in mine ear, 
Their features I 
see in my dreams, 
And the world is a 
wilderness drear, 
As a 
wide spreading desert it seems, 
CHOR US. 
Ah, where are the friends of my youth, 
Ali, where are the cherish'd ones gone, 
And why have they dropp'd as the leaf,

why have they left me t..4.) mourn. 
Say, can I 
ever again, 
Such ties can I 
eve' renevr, 
Or feel those warm pulses again, 
Which beat for the dear ones I 
knew; 
The world as a 
winter is cold, 
E 
Leh charm seems to vanish away 
Mv lwart is now blighted and old, 
It shares in all nature's decay,

THE LADY'S MAN. 
By Mr. ARTHUR LLOYD. 
I'm quite a 
lady's man, in fact 
The belles they all declare, 
They never had a

Who walked so inilitaire. 
My whiskers and mustachios, too, 
Resist their charms who can, 
It is their fascination makes me 
Quite a 
lady's man,

I'm a

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Fin quite a 
lady's man, 
I'm quite a 
lady's man, yes I 
quite a 
lady's man_ 
'Tis pleasant, when the heart is free, 
To watch the maiden smile, 
To mark her eye—bewitching glance— 
The youthful heart beguile: 
But I 
can gaze on beauty bright, 
And I'd much rather, than 
Peru's rich mines were mine to boast, 
Be quite a 
lady's man. 
I'm a 
lady's man, &c. 
If I 
am ill, a 
score of girls 
Come knocking at the door, 
And cards, with kind inquiries, 
In by the hundreds pour; 
I 
envy not the proudest peer 
Of country or of clan, 
For oh, ' tis fortune, honor, fame, 
To be a 
lady's man. 
I'm a 
lady's man, ctc.

THE SONG OF BLANCHE ALPEN. 
By STEPHEN G LOVER. 
You speak of sunny skies to me— 
Of orange grove and bower— 
Of winds that wake soft melody 
From leaf and blooming flower 
And you may prize those far off skies, 
But tempt not me to roam ; 
In sweet content my days are spent— 
Then wherefore leave my home ? 
CLIORLTS. 
In sweet content my days are spent, 
Then wherefore leave my home ? 
You tell me oft of rivers bright. 
Where golden galleys float; 
But have you seen our lakes by night, 
Or sailed in Alpine boat ? 
You speak of lands where hearts and hands 
Will greet me as I 
come, 
But tho' I 
find true hearts and kind, 
They're kinder still at home, & c. 
Had you been rear'd by Alpine hills, 
Or lov'd in Alpine dells, 
You'd prize like me our mountain rills 
Nor fear the torrent swells: 
It matters not how drear the spot, 
How proud or poor the dome, 
Love still retains sonic deathless chains, 
That bind, the heart to home, etc.

ROSHERVILLE, 
THE PLACE To SPEND A 
HAITI- DAY 
Sung by JAM E6 HILLIER. 
The place to spend a 
happy day, 
A 
jolly day, a 
holiday, 
is Rosherville, I've heard 'em say, 
So there I 
took my way ; 
On board the boat I 
met the Browns, 
The Smiths and many more, 
All smiles and gloves, the pretty doves, 
And dressed up to the door. 
(Spoken.) 
And where are you off to Mr. Brown ? why to spend 
a happy day of course—come along, Mary-Jane, come along 
Betsey-Matilda. 
Come bring- your sweethearts and Ma's 
And let us all be gay, 
Rosherville s 
the place my boys 
To spend a 
happy day. 
Come bring your sisters am.I Pa's, 
And dance dull care away, 
Rosherville's the place by Jove 
To spend a 
happy day. 
We had our dinner on the boat, 
The Gravesend boat, the packet boar, 
The ocean gives me appetite, 
Whenever I'm afloat ; 
We'd sheep's heads, beans and mutton broth, 
But through a 
sad mishap, 
The vessel lurcli'd and all upset 
In Missis Jones's lap. 
(Spoken.) 
Dear me, Mrs. Jones, what a 
pity

silk too, never mind, mum, go on deck, it will soon dry in the

ROSHERVILLE. (CoNcLuDED.) 
The gardens always are so gay, 
So bright and gay, they well may say, 
That Rosherville's the proper place 
To spend a 
happy day ; 
Of archery and round-a-bouts, 
When you have had your fill, 
The mazy dance will make you gay 
Or swings will make you ill. 
Come bring, ttc. 
An arbor is a 
shady spot, 
A 
quiet spot, a 
cooling spot, 
And in an arbor with Miss Smith 
I 
somehow found I 
got; 
Oh, Jane I 
said I, 
Oh, Jim I 
said she, 
And then she simpered so, 
I 
looked at her, she looked at me, 
And then we both said " Oh 1" 
Come bring, 4c. 
As we were nicely billing there. 
And cooing there, and wooing there, 
A heavy stick descended on 
My head and made me stare; 
saw it was her Pa, who said 
" 
Name your intentions pray," 
I 
answered " My intentions are 
To spend a 
happy day." 
(Spoken.) And if you're wise you'll do the same and sing--
Come bring, cte 
Of course we made it up again, 
For toe and Jane the course was p
.lain, 
'Twr.s settled Jane should marry me, 
And I 
should marry Jane. 
Lp ii our wedding trip of course 
At Rosherville we'd stay, 
And we shall send our children there, 
To spend a happy day. 
(Spoken.) And we shall say to them; " Follow in the footsteps 
of your fattier and mother, my dear," 
Come bring, etc.

SAY YES, PUSSY,. 
She sat close b his side 
His face with fear was wan, 
He could not though he tried, 
Propose—that timid man; 
He moved uneasy in his seat, 
She asked him, ' u 
as he ill 
He only shuffled with his feet, 
His bosom's pain to still. 
Yes, no— no, yes—not very well 
He said with ghostly smile, 
But oh, i 
dare not, dare not tell, 
What ails me all this while; 
I've very often tried to say, 
Think of me if you mul—

hope I 
am not in the way,

timid man. 
A favorite Tabby lay, 
Upon the lady's lap, 
All in her own sleek way, 
Taking- a 
quiet nap. 
Olt, puss,' she thought "I 
wish you'd tell 
All that he wants to know, 
I 
really like him very well, 
But must not tell him so.' 
I'm sure you are very, very kind, 
She slowly thus began, 
But 1—but I've made up my mind 
Never to think of man. 
I 
never can consent to change— 
You should have asked before, 
At least— that is—'tis very strange, 
I 
cannot tell you more.' 
He gave up all for lost, 
Took up his hat to flv, 
But 're the room he crcas'd 
He heard a 
gentle sigh. 
With beating heart he turned him round, 
Then hit upon this plan ; 
His eyes were cast upon the ground, 
He was a 
timid man. 
Oh, Pussy cat,' said he, 
' 
Were I 
to ask her now, 
D'ye think your mistress would have me, 
Would listen to my vow ?' 
Aloud his thoughts he trembling spoke, 
Then paused to hear his doom, 
• 
Say yes, pussy,— say yes, pussy,' 
The lady answered soon. 
THE RATAPLAN. 
What a 
charm has the drum with its tan-a-ran-tdn, 
When we march to the gay parade! 
0, the music we love is the bold rataplan, 
And the rubadub merrily play'd. 
Every heart is inspired by its magical sound, 
There's a 
soul in the stirring drum, 
And there is not a 
voice while its echoes rebound, 
But would cry " Let the enemy come." 
CHORUS. 
So merrily, 01 
So cheerily, 0 1 
So merrily march away, 
Rataplan ! rataplan ! rataplan 
rataplan 
March away while we may, 
'Tis a 
gay gala day, 
And our banners are flaunting high, 
In the sun sword and gun flash around every one; 
With a 
glance just as bright as the sky. 
To the field when we march, how the tan- a-ran-tan 
Makes the heart of the soldier glow 
Let him hear but the roll of the bold rataplan, 
And how gallantly forward he'll go I 
When the battle is done, 
And the victory won, 
Still the sound of the rolling drum 
Sends its echoes afar, 
From the red field of war, 
To the dear friends who welcome us home. 
Then merrily, dm

THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE. 
Now list you landsmen all to me, 
To tell you the truth I'm bound ; 
What happened to me by „Ting to sea, 
And of the wonders which I 
found. 
Ship wreck'd I 
was once off Perouse, 
And cast upon the shore! 
So I 
resolved to take a 
cruise, 
Ti e 
country to explore 
Fol de roT, &c. 
But far I 
had not scudded out, 
When close alongside the ocean, 
I 
saw something move, which at first I 
thought, 
Was all the earth in motion. 
But steering up close along side. 
I 
found 'twas a 
crocodile; 
And from the nose to the tip of his tail 
He measured five hundred mile. 
Fol de rol, & c. 
This crocodile, I 
could plainly see, 
Was not of the common race: 
For I 
was obliged to climb up a 
very high tree, 
Before I 
could see his face. 
And when he lifted up his jaw, 
Tho' perhaps you'll think ' tis a 
lie, 
It reached above the clouds for miles three score, 
And his nose nearly touched the sky. 
Fol detrol, & c. 
Whilst up aloft, and the stream was high, 
It blew a 
gale from the south. 
I 
lost my hold and away did fly, 
Right into this crocodile's mouth. 
He quickly closed his jaws on me, 
And thought to grabb a 
victim; 
But I 
ran clown his throat, d'ye see, 
And that's the way I 
trick'd him.

WONDERFUL CROCODILE. ( CoseLLDEu.) 
I 
travelled on for a 
month or two, 
'Till I 
got into his maw, 
Where I 
found of rum kegs not a 
few, 
And a 
thousand bullocks in store. 
Of life I 
banished all my care, 
For in grub I 
wasn't stinted ; 
So in this crocopile I 
lived ten years, 
Very well contented. 
Fol de rol, & c. 
This crocodile being very old, 
One day, alas ? he died, 
But he was three years getting cold, 
He was so long and wide. 
His skin was ten miles thick I'm sure, 
Or vtry near about, 
For I 
win full six months or more, 
Cutting a 
hole for to get out. 
Fol de 1'01, &c. 
But now oncl more I've got on carth, 
And resolvt 
t. no more to roam, 
So in a 
ship, Oat passrd, I 
got a 
berth, 
And now I'n safe at home. 
And lest my stcry you should 41 ,, nlit, 
Should you err travel the Nile ; 
Just where he feli,you'll find the shell 
Of this wonderfu.crocodile.

THE BLIND GLRL. 
By I. N. M ETCALF. 
They say this world is beautiful, 
More fair than thoughts of love ; 
And nightly comes an angel hand, 
That writes in gold above ; 
But ah ! ' tis viewless all to me, 
As the softly breathing wind, 
I 
cannot see those beauteous scenes 
For I 
am blind, I'm blind. 
I 
never saw the bird that sings 
So sweetly to mine ear, 
Nor snowy shroud that winter weaves, 
Around the dying year; 
All nature is a 
sealed book, 
Whose clasp I 
cannot find, 
'Twas never meant for me to read, 
For I 
am blind, I'm blind. 
But alt I 
they tell me far away, 
In bright eternity, 
There is a 
land.o'erspread with flowers, 
Which every eye can see; 
Where skies are ever soft and aloe, 
And silver streamlets wiry ; 
Oh ! when I 
reach that boy shore 
I

When each sad thief his trade pursuing, 
(A trade that leads to certain ruin), 
If taken up, you'll see them steering, 
Walking to Bow street to have a

But now to help all those who do ill, 
To make them walk is very cruel ; 
And every thief, whether boy or man, sir, 
Has a

THE SAILOR BOY'S DREAM. 
In slumbers of midnight the sailor boy lay, 
His hatmnock swung loose at the sport of the wind, 
But watch worn and weary, his cares flew away 
And visions of happiness danc'd on his mind. 
Ile dreamt of his home, and his dear native bowers, 
And pleasures that waited on life's merry morn, 
While memory stood sideways, half covered with flowers, 
And restored every rose, and secreted a 
thorn. 
Then fancy, her magical pinions spread wide, 
And bade the young- dreamer in ecstacy rise, 
Now far, far behind him the green waters glide, 
And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes. 
The jessatnine clambers in fhwer o'er the hatch, 
And the swallow sings sweet from her nest in the wall, 
All trembling with transport he raises the latch, 
And the voices of loved ones reply to his call. 
A father bends o'er him with looks of delight, 
His cheek is itnpearled with it mother's warm tear, 
And the lips of the boy in the love- kiss unite, 
With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear. 
The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast, 
,Ity quickens his pulse— all his htirdships seem o'er, 
All a 
murmur of happiness steals through his rest. 
0 
God ! thou bast blest Ale, I 
ask for no more." 
! 
whence is that flame, which now bursts on his eye ? 
Air ! what is that sound which now startles his ear ? 
'Tis the lightning's red glare, painting hell on the sky ! 
'Tis the crashing of thunder, the groan of the sphere.

THE SAILOR BOY'S DREAM. [ coNcLunEn.1 
He springs from his hammock—he flies to the deck, 
Amazement confronts him with images dire, 
Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a 
wreck, 
The masts fly in splinters—the shrouds are on fire! 
Like mountains, the billows tremendously swell, 
In vain the lost wretch calls on Mary to save, 
Unseen bands of spirits are ringing his knell, 
And the death-angel flaps his broad wings o'er the wave. 
0, sailor boy, we to thy dream of delight, 
In darkness dissolves the gay frost- work of bliss, 
Where now is the picture that fancy touch'd bright, 
Thy parents' fond pressure, and love-honied kiss? 
0 sailor boy I 
sailor boy! never again, 
Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay, 
Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main, 
Full many a 
score fathom thy frame shall decay. 
No tomb shall e'er plead to remembrance for thee, 
Or redeem form or frame from the merciless surge, 
But the white foam of waves shun thy winding sheet be, 
And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge. 
On beds of green sea- flowers thy limbs shall he laid, 
Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow, 
Of thy bright yellow locks threads of amber he made, 
And every part suit to thy mansion below. 
lbys, months, years, and ages shall circle away, 
And still the vast waters above thee shall roll, 
Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye-

sailor boy! peace to thy soul.

There was the cook and doctor, the mid- wife and the nurse;

Wow, when that I 
grew up a 
boy ' and I 
was sent to school, 
One day I 
play'd the truant, and fell into a 
pool; 
My master went to flog me— he hallooed out, oh fegs, 
Hold fast the little rascal by his stunning pair of legs. 
Tel de rol,

My mother doted on me, and often she would sing— 
Indeed I 
think my little son will surely be a 
king. 
One day I 
tried to stop a 
pig, it was a 
lark—oh fegs, 
For he gave a 
grunt and bolted through my stunning pair of legs. 
Tol de rOl, 
A 
policeman collared bold of me— oh, how he made me squeak, 
He took me to the station-house, and then before the beak, 
Do you know him, said the magistrate ; said the peeler, yes, oh 
fegs, 
You may know he is a 
prig, by his stunning pair of legs. 
Tol de rol, & c. 
Send him cif to Blackwell, the magistrate then says, 
And let him work the quaryy for one-and- thirty days, 
Tell the Governor to watch him, and work him well—oh fegs, 
And clap a 
pair of ruffles on his stunning pair of legs.

And slipped into a

Now has arrived the happy season 
When old King Christmas does appear.

Let's enjoy life while we may,

Bring the laurel and the ivy, 
Emblems of the festive time.

In the yule log's cheerful blaze, 
Expectant ears will anxious listen 
To tales of love and by gone days.

TURN IT UP. 
TURN IT UP. 
Written by J. H ILLIER. 
Of motto songs I 
have no doubt, 
You've nearly had your fill, 
With every sort of good advice, 
You have been crammed until 
You all exclaim " Hold hard," enough, 
No motto songs for me, 
But let me try a 
little one 
With which you'll p'rhaps agree 
(Spoken.)—'Tis a 
very simple commonplace title, and advises 
you if yon find anything going a 
little bit wrong to— 
C 
Turn it up, turn it up, 
If you find that game don't pay, boys, 
Turn it up, turn it up, 
If you find that game don't pay. 
Some young men bent on seeing life, 
Think betting a 
good game, 
And lay long ' odds' when 'evens' would, 
Have answered just the same. 
They stake their health, their wealth, good name, 
On the " Leger".or the " Cup," 
Till in life's race, themselves are scratched, 
And then they turn it up. 
(Spokon.)—W hat's more common now a 
days than to hear of 
a 
young asp;rant to fortune's favors putting clown an odd fiver 
on a 
horse, but ,vhat's less common than to hear of his ever 
taking it up again, no, ye youths, be advised, let the first loss be 
the last, and as for gambling— 
Turn it up, & e. 
Some young gents fancy in their pride 
Their sweethearts love them true ? 
And send them bouquets, loves and doves, 
And rings and bracelets too ; 
Until some night when strolling home 
With a 
friend to quietly sup, 
He meets her with her Cousin Tom 
Then of course he'll " turn it up. 
(Spoken.)Plaguey uncomfortable isn't it to feel spooney, to stand 
under her bed-room window half the night hoping to eaten 
glimpse of the shadow of the darling Sophanisba on the cur-
thins, too nervous to declare your passion, too much confused to 
s
,ay Sophanisba " If you love me as I 
love you, no knife, but 
lire, shall part us two," be advised ye youths send confusion to 
the right-about, and as for nervousness— 
Turn it up, & c. 
An evening party's very nice, 
To mix with jolly friends, 
And drink success in Champagne ice, 
To life new pleasure lends 
But should the morning come, and you 
Are shouting " one more cup," 
And you feel your heal is spinning round, 
'Tis time to turn it up. 
(Spoken.)—Be sure if you see four lights where there are 
wily two and button your bottom button into the top button.

THE LANGUID SWELL.

With such a 
languid air, 
That the pretty girls with sweet surprise 
Ask how he did get there? 
Ah ! 
(dialogue ad lib.) 
You see I'm never in a 
hurry, 
And I 
take life very cool, 
For to race is a 
pace, 
That I 
do not find in rule; 
Though some are always in a 
flurry, 
Yet I 
think it quite as well, 
To remain to the last, 
As the languid swell. 
Sonic fellows on Velocipedes 
Go working with a 
will, 
But for my part I've no desire, 
To practice the tread- mill. 
Such acrobatic feat i 
may be 
For some, extremely well, 
But you'll never catch outside a 
wheel 
This very languid swell.

I'm told some fellows climb the Alps 
To see a

But I

And I

Then as for cricket, what's the fun 
When balls come banging round, 
And catch you plump upon the eye 
And stretch you on the ground. 
You see I'm never, 
I 
think I'd like to be in love, 
If women wouldn't gush, 
But when a 
girl goes in for me, 
She does it with a 
rush. 
She wants to ride, she wants to walk, 
She wants to go to Kew, 
And keeps a 
fellow all the while 
In a 
perfect state of stew ! 
You see I'm never, cte. 
Thus always calmly jogging on 
Has been my golden rule,

I 
am a 
blighted flower, boys, 
A 
plants been put On me, 
13u11-rush into my story, now, 
I'll go, as you shall see ; 
Sweet Mari-gold an evergreen, 
Call'd me sweet William good, 
She thought my head it must have been, 
Just made of Satinwood. 
Sweet Mari-gold! Mari-gold! Mari-gold! 
Fairer than any flower that blows, 
She's my sweet-scented briar and my fine fuchsia, 
And the gem of the Floricultral Shows; 
I'm not at all a 
cockscomb, 
Tho' I 
saw my bud, each hour, 
Treated mine, like love lies bleeding, 
And made me R passion flower: 
I 
thought I 
was in clover, 
But I've lost my heartsease, 
Oh I 
for her I 
would have shell,d out. 
Freely as I'd shell sweet peas. 
Sweet Mari-gold, ttc. 
I'd better thrown my t(h)ime, away, 
On sonic sweet _
Margery. 
Than wasted my weeks salary (celery) 
My sweet Marjoram to see; 
I 
thought her like a 
sunflower,

SWEET MARI-GOLD. [CoxcLuDED]. 
Grand as a 
holyhock, 
But as I'm not wed she's made, 
Of me a 
single stock. 
Sweet Mari-gold, &c., 
Forget-me-not, I 
thought she would, 
My Buttercup and Daisy, 
But my Pink of perfection has, 
Now nearly drove me crasy ; 
Her Tulips I 
shall never kiss, 
And I 
have cause to rue, 
I 
am a 
flower in the shade, 
And of a 
dismal hue. ( Yew). 
Sweet Mari-gold, dr.c. 
She's not a 
Blue Bell(e), tho' she writes, 
she's dark, not like a 
; 
And as she's brought down grief on me, 
I 
call her Daffadowndilly; 
I'd have given her any money, ( Anemoney), 
If she'd have been my bride, 
But my rose has proved a 
thorn to me, 
With so much London Pride. 
Sweet Mari-gold, &c. 
Like a(n)ice plant, she's chill'd my heart. 
It's a(n)ice plant upon me, 
I'm like a 
Weeping Willow, 
When her " Willa" near I 
sea; 
Just like the summer faded flowers, 
I'm running all to seeds; 
And now my weary hours, 
I'm devoting to the Weeds!

THE DANCING BARBER. 
Air—" TUE SABRE." 
A Barber loved a 
charmer nam'd Maria, 
She left a 
pain here at his side; 
She was all mortal could desire, 
She vow'd that she would be his bride. 
From him she never would be parted, 
- Oh ! how her words he had believed; 
With frenzy, his brain it now has started, 
For cruelly, cruelly he has been deceived 
CHORUS. 
She's jilted the Barber, the Barber, the Barber, 
Mad is the Barber, he feels his brain on fire; 
She's jilted the Barber, the Barber, the Barber, 
Mad now is the Barber, yes 
mad is the 
Barber, 
And all this through false Maria. 
The first time she went into his shop, 
Ah I 
me, he felt so strange and queer : 
Her bright eyes they nearly made him drop, 
Her hair it hung right down to here. 
Ile dressed it and from that moment 
Wounded he was by Cupid's dart; 
What he cut off ho dearly cherish'd, 
He wears it, yes! he wears it next his heart. 
She jilted the Barber, cte. 
He neve: made the slightest, charge, 
So the fair one often came ; 
With love he felt his heart grow large, 
He to! I 
his love and not in vain. 
She natn'd the day, alt ! blissful moment, 
With joy, he could have danced a 
fling; 
Packed is his heart with creel torment, 
To find she is a 
false, deceitful thing% 
She's jilted the Barber, dr.c. 
When he found out she loved another, 
His heart it felt ten million blows; 
He cut all the hair off one man's head, 
And took inch from off another's nose. 
Often with razor in his hand, 
His sorrow, with madness sends him raving; 
His customers his woes can't understand, 
And strange to say they never now want shaving. 
She's jilted the Barber, ike.

De Witt's Ten Cent Romances No. 81 
Spiky Jonas.; 
OR 
THE SILENT AVENGER. 
This is a 
terribly wild, but terribly true story of the ad-
ventures of a 
family of settlers in 'the forest wilds, when 
musket balls were more plentiful than peaches in the bor-
der settlements.

passages of faithful heart.love, and womanly devotion. 
All 
told with rare energy and vividness.
