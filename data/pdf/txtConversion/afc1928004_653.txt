There's an old dusty attic in the house where I 
was born, 
Where I 
once chanced to rummage o'er the trinkets old anil 
worn ; 
Among the dust.covered rubbish, that spoke of other days, 
An old-fashioned photograph there fell on my gaze. 
How I 
laughed when I 
saw it, so quaint did it seem, 
The old-fashioned clothes they looked so queer, [ trace 
But my smiles turned to sadness when in outlines I 
ditl. 
An old-fashioned photograph of mother so dear. 
crionus. 
How well I 
remember that dear loving face, 
The sweet, tender voice again I 
hear, 
And I 
see with affection in that old and dusty frame 
An old-fashioued photograph of mother so dear. 
How my mind wanders back to that sunny long ago, 
When I 
knelt by her side and in whispers soft and low, 
How she taught me to pray and I 
lisped a 
tiny prayer 
That God would protect us all from sorrow and care. 
And oft through night's stillness I'd wake from a 
dream 
To see a 
fond mother watching near, [beam 
Auld the same soft expression from her loving eyes did 
That shines in the photograph of mother so dear.

CRADLE'S EMPTY, BABY'S GONE.

Little empty cradle, treasured now with care, 
Though thy precious burden it has lied ; 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair 
Peeping from thy tiny, snow-white bed. 
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes 
From the rumpled pillow shone, 
Then I 
gazed with gladness, now I 
look and sigh; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
CHORUS. 
Baby left her cradle for the golden shore; 
O'er the silvery waters she has flown; 
Gone to join the angels peaceful evermore; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
As with beating heart I 
looked upon her form 
Many hours upon that silent night, 
Hoping to the last, but still at early dawn 
Her spirit fled to join those realms of light. 
Often do I 
fancy I 
see that little face, 
Life to me of pleasure it has shorn, 
With tearful eyes I 
gaze upon that vacant place— 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
Cao.—Baby left her cradle, etc. 
Near a 
shady valley stands a 
grassy mound; 
Underneath my little darling sleeps ; 
Blossoms sweet and roses cluster all around, 
Overhead the willow silent weeps. 
There I 
laid my loved one in the long ago 
And my heart does sadly mourn; 
Though she's with the angels, still I 
fain would weep; 
Empty is the cradle—baby's gone. 
CHO.—Baby left her cradle, etc.

l've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And l've trinkets so rare that came many years ago 
From my far- distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dean)

Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret that I 
plucked in childhood's

'Tis a

Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Pis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave.

So while sailing along on life's rough and stormy tide, 
I 
will ever keep this talisman in view, 
That when tempted and tried I 
may never turn aside 
From the memory of her love so warm and true; 
And when life with us is ended, 
May some ever faithful friend 
Plant a 
flower that. some loving hand may save, 
That will fondly remind them of a friend they once 
held dear, 
Like the flower from my angel mother's grave.

And I 
had to get it mended with a 
little piece of glue; 
She gave me back my locket and a 
little silver shoe; 
Hi Jenny, Ho Jenny Johnson !

Now my Jenny's married to a

And we never take a

For those that hire us to parade 
Must pay us in advance.

And we swing our torches high ; 
With all the dainty food we want, 
Oh! goodness! ain't it " pie " ?

But don't step on his heel, 
And loudly cheer the candidate, 
For he'll give us a

With a

I 
strolled along the Avenue, 
When I 
saw passing by 
A 
damsel pert with pretty face, 
Who smiled with roguish eye. 
I 
raised my hat and glided near, 
" 
Are you going far ?" said I; 
And to my question whispered low, 
She made me this reply.

" 
Are you going far this ev'ning 
No, not far; only to the car, 
To meet Papa! Ta! Ta! 
To meet Papa! Ta 1

thought perhaps she failed to hear 
Exactly what I 
said ; 
Encouraged by another smile, 
Which almost turned my head, 
Again I 
spoke in sweetest tones, 
And said, " I 
meant no harm. 
I'll be your escort, sweetest girl," 
And offered her my arm. 
Ciro.—" Are you going," etc. 
I 
asked her then if she'd partake 
Of oysters, stewed or raw. 
She said she would, and in we went, 
And she passed in before. 
Her appetite was very keen, 
And my money quickly flew. 
Our supper o'er we stepped without 
Upon the Avenue.

The car conductor is a

He swings his lantern to and fro to stop and start 
again ; 
He wakes the sleepers one and all, and tickets they must 
show, 
Or put the price into his hands or off the car they go. 
Pull the rope, the bell does ring, the brakesman shouts 
the news, 
" 
Ten minutes for refreshments," at Peekskill or Cohoes ; 
Yonkers, Troy and Albany—again you hear the bell, 
But where we'll land before we're thro' it's mighty hard to

The locomotive whistle blows, the wheels go rouud and 
round, 
All aboard or you'll get left. 
Just hear that awful sound. 
It means the boiler's full of steam, it's got a 
mighty power, 
We'll soon be speeding at tile rate of 
sixty miles an 
hour. 
In palace cars we take our ease, and read the daily news; 
If friends should offer fine cigars, I'm sure we'd not re-
fuse ; 
And ladies, too, will sweetly smile when we collect the fare. 
We " pass" them free and never think the company Vill 
care. 
" 
Dead- heads" never bother us, or try to " beat" their way, 
We signal to the brakesman if they don't quickly- pay. 
" 
Punch the tickets—keep the cash," this motto bear in 
mind, 
By doing this we'll soon become the owners of the line. 
Cuo.—The locomotive whistla blows, ate.

I 
represent one of the latest 
Whims that arise in our days ; 
At a 
glance you will see by my actions 
I've a 
touch of the festhetic craze. 
I 
go in for genuine culture, 
I 
sigh and I 
silently mutter, 
If anything chances to please me, 
For Pm too— yes too— utterly utter. 
CHORUS. 
Over sunflowers, yellow as butter, 
I 
linger in Tsthetic flutter, 
And I 
lisp with a 
sort of a 
stutter, 
For I'm too—yes too— utterly utter. 
I 
never attend any dances, 
For I 
should certainly die 
If I 
sought to display rapid motions, 
I'm so languid I 
never could try ; 
But give me a 
party of culture, 
I'll put them all into a 
flutter ; 
I'll crawl and I'll drawl round the parlor, 
For I'm too—yes too—utterly utter. 
Ciro. —Over sunflowers, etc. 
I 
love to admire china dishes, 
Broken and battered with age, 
And flowers that possess faintest odors, 
And my poems I'm sure are the rage. 
Each movement of mine is a 
study, 
And a 
picture of all that is utter ; 
For I 
walk and I 
talk sort of dreamy, 
For I'm too—yes too— utterly utter, 
Cuo.—Over sunflowers, etc.

We're students of a 
college where all branches we pursue, 
We're versed in all the classics that the ancients ever 
knew; 
In Latin studies we excel, our Greek is superfine, 
For oft we burn the midnight lamp, and thus improve 
the mind. 
CHORUS. 
We vanquish all with bat and ball, 
And when our college crews 
Determined rise to win a 
prize, 
There's no such word as " lose." 
We'll swim or skate, or leap a 
gate, 
These are the student's joys ; 
For worth and mirth there's none on earth 
Like Yankee college boys. 
Our " Freshmen" and our " Sophomores" will strive with 
might and main, 
Our rivals beat on flood or field our honor to maintain; 
Athletic games and knowledge too improve the " coming 
man," 
And form in after years the " brain" and " muscle" of our 
land. 
eno.—We vanquish all, etc. 
We dearly love a 
harmless joke, and often will prepare 
A 
feast of fun to drive away and keep away dull care; 
And when a 
comrade needs a 
friend, yes, any in our band, 
He'll find the Yankee college boys are ready heart and 
hand.

I've health and wealth and pride. 
My daughter she's a 
daisy, 
I've a 
six-foot boy beside; 
But my quietude is broken, 
I 
believe fm growing ill, 
My family disregard me for 
The flowers on my window- sill. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
coffee rose in an oyster- can, 
A 
pink and a 
daffodil, 
A 
hollyhock and an old cornstalk, 
Are the flowers on my window-sill. 
They've rigged a 
soap-box garden 
To culture all the plants, 
The air blooms wid their fragrance, 
The rooms swarm wid their ants; 
They've got a 
Chinayse fuchsia 
Trained up an ostrich quill, 
It's wrapped each night, in flannel, are 
The flowers on my window-sill.

coffee rose, etc.

Patricio claims a

Swears he'll get a 
torch and set fire to 
The flowers on my window-sill.

Knocked the flower- pots off the sill,

By the flowers on my window-sill.

In Scotland's fair land, o'er mountain and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she has not come as yet; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain ; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
C11011US. 
Oh 1 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in vain— 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep ; oh! break it not, my Jean ; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh! then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh! Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

On the seventeenth of March I 
dressed so neat and gay, 
For to join the grand procession I 
at once set on my way ; 
There ‘N 
as citizens both tall and short and ladies short and 
tall, 
All anxious for to see us march forninst the City Hall. 
There was little Michael Dooley wid a bran new suit of 
clothes 
That was made by' " Johnny Docherty," who everybody 
knows ; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there as decent as could be, 
But there wasn't one in all the crowd could stand aside of 
me. 
CHORUS. 
Did you see Pat Mahone \yid his shining bran new hat, 
Did you see Win march along like a 
gay aristocrat ? 
There were flags and banners waving high and dress in 
style was shown, 
But the finest man in all the crowd was Mr. Pat Mahone. 
The Mayor near by the City Hall quite stately took his stand 
He noticed none till I 
came by and then he waved his hand. 
He saw at once the style was there, for he stared wid both his 
eyes, 
For he thought I 
was the President all dressed up in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, till I 
thought we'd never 
stop, 
And as I 
needed stimulant, I 
thought I'd take a 
drop. 
The people there were talking of the sights they'd seen that 
day, 
And I 
felt a 
little flattered when I 
heard some ladies say, 
Cno.—Did you see Pat Mahone, etc. 
I 
received an invitation to attend a 
fancy ball, 
But without an evening suit of clothes I 
could not go at all ; 
Old 
Docherty," the tailor, my measure could not take, 
Because for Mr. Dooley he had got a 
suit to make. 
I 
then walked to the Bowery, bought a 
new suit second band, 
And wid a 
flower stuck in my coat I 
looked a 
trifle grand ; 
We danced till nearly midnight, when we went home in 
the dark, 
You could scarcely walk a 
yard but what you'd hear some 
one remark, 
Cuo.—Did you see Pat Mahone, etc.

There's a

The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true, 
And heart so free. 
Many hours among the flowers

Little one so dear.

In this world of ours, 
Sallie Horner 'round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her, 
If you only try, 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If yon catch her eye, 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten 
In the azure sky ; 
When she speaks the angers listen 
As they pass her by.

In her roguish way,

He gave me a 
pretty red rose 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said as he kissed me good-by, 
Wear this in your breast, love, for me. 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will chug ; 
While lonely I 
std. for my darling's bright eye. 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty red rose, my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little token, my pretty red rose ; 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye 
I'll sing of my pretty red rose. 
'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly l'il treasure its leaves, 
Though their beauty may vanish away 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls every sigh to repose; 
Tho' now we're apart, still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose.

No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair 
That used to take place every day ; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement l'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in, you must know, and saw Barnum's Great Show, 
Van Amburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings, and all kinds of things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOREN.—Yes, when we got to the fair my girl wanted to 
have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I 
said, " All right, my 
darling," and we had a 
swing ; but directly the swing went 
to and fro, she lustily called out : 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred ! tell them to stop I 
That was the cry of Maria ; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed, 
But I 
only said, stop the swing ; 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
"I' was then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down en her knees, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree 
Ctio.—Oh, Fred I 
etc. 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout,it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN.—Mark now, before you get into the swing's boat, 
make a 
bargain with your young lady not to call out:

By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair, 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair ; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Angel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A- de, A-de, 
Such songs will pass away ; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Many spring- times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains 
Saw she lost ler hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last, 
And she withered like a 
flower 
That is waiting for the rain ; 
She will never see the stranger 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait al way, 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maid n sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing ; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-de, A-de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seem to watch and wait alway.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever growing wild, 
And the stream o'erflowed by the mill ; 
But the old mill-hous has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it, and so did darlin(r Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played ' neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it, and so did darling Kate ; 
When she sits beside me now there's a 
smile upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the old schoolmaster heard us recite. 
And those happy, happy days have faded from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight ; 
And when school was out we would wander to the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate ; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

Let cowardly slanderers say what they will 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villanous lie in their teeth. 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity, as everybody knows— 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm ; 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Cno.—Pat may be foolish, etc. 
Remember that Celts and the Saxons are bound 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands joined in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name 
Is not fit for a 
country so green. 
Cno.—Pat may be foolish, etc,.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepared for the worst 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORUS. 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up 
And tell me at once what he feels ; 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be used, but I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong, I 
can care the foul slander at once, 
And destroy every venomous part ; - 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Cno.—I do like a 
man, etc. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can do him no good, do him no harm ; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
1.nd if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

Oh, my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall, 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall ; 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chair, 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamped, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madmen he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Cno.—Over the garden wall, etc. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall ; 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick! 
I 
have an impression lie's bringing a 
stick ; 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick, 
Over the garden wall.

But where there's a

way, 
Over the garden wall, 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall.

The sun is setting, and the hour is late, 
Once more I 
stand beside the wicket gate, 
The bells are ringing out the dying day, 
The children singing on their homeward way, 
And he is whispering words of sweet intent, 
While I 
half doubting whisper a 
consent. 
CHORUS, 
Is this a

Oh! do not wake me, let me dream again; 
Is this a

Oh! do not wake me, do not wake me, 
Let me dream again. 
The clock is striking in the belfry tower 
And warns us of the ever-fleeting hour; 
But neither heeds the time which onward glides, 
For time may pass away, but love abides. 
I 
feel his kisses on my fevered brow ; 
If we must part, ah why should it be now?

Over the billows my light barque cloth ride, 
Like a 
feather ' tis tossed on the turbulent tide, 
Yet proudly rising upon the wave's crest, 
She defies the wild waters that foam on her breast. 
Yo ho! swifter now we sail; 
Yo ho! higher blows the gale. 
Father above, in Thee, I 
trust, 
More than a 
mother, love Thee I 
must ; 
Oh, let Thy power the flood assuage 
And save me from the tempest's rage; 
Glide o'er the sea, my faithful boat, 
To that dear shore where we lightly float. 
Haste! for my heart to thee would fly, 
My barque for thee already is nigh. 
CHORUS. 
When starry eyes look on the sea, 
My weary heart still longs for thee ; 
Alas ! that I 
afar must rove 
From thee my queen, my life, my love. 
When lonely watching at night on the main, 
I 
discern the black tempest advancing on high, 
I 
laugh at the storm fiend, and fear I 
disdain, 
Thy love gives me courage all ills to defy. 
Yo ho! as the storm grows loud; 
Yo ho! still more sail we crowd. 
Santa Maria, in thee I 
trust, 
More than a 
mother, love thee I 
must, 
Oh, let thy power the flood assuage, 
And save me from the tempest's rage. 
What matters now to me the wind, 
If it but waft me to where I 
find 
My loved one waiting, waiting for me; 
My love, my angel, sainted one for me.

I 
have raised a 
dozen children, quite proud of them am I, 
And some are influential and hold positions high; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters,that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride; 
There is Larry, Ted, and Owney, with Terence, Dan, and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like ; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's worst of all, you 
see, 
For he's travelling with a 
circus, an actor man to be. 
CHORUS. 
Our Patrick is an actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes ; 
A 
diamond on his shirt- front, a 
lump the size of that, 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer; 
I'll cook corned beef and cabbage to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel ; 
But he'll 
eat ice cream and oysters, blanc mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learns from actors, they're always living 
high ; 
But in spite of all his manners, a word for him we'll 
speak, 
Re ne'er forgets his parents with money every week.

PERVERTED PROVERBS; OR, TUPPERNY

Mr. Tupper has written a 
book, 
" 
Proverbial Philosophy" named, 
In its pages oft I 
look, 
For the sentences there are famed ; 
There's a maxim for every day, 
And a 
motto for every man, 
If you wish to be happy and gay, 
The philosopher points the plan; 
I 
have studied some of the proverbs wise, 
And trust I've not learnt them wrong. 
So list to the words of wisdom 
And advice that flow through my song. 
Now where there's a 
way there's a 
will, 
That you must own is most true, 
A 
still head makes a 
wise tongue, 
You don't know what you can try till you do; 
A 
mile is as good as a 
miss, 
Attend to these golden rules, 
And be careful between the grounds, 
Or else you'll fall on the stools ; 
Spare the child and spoil the rod 
If you would peace secure, 
And it's no use locking the horse up 
When you've lost the stable door. 
A 
feast is as good as enough, 
So says this wonderful book, 
Waste and you never will want, 
For too many broths spoil the cook ; 
Every day has its dog, 
There's wisdom in every word, 
So hold up your man like a 
bead, 
For the -early worm catches the bird ; 
A 
bird in the bush is worth two in the hand ; 
So all you covetous elves, 
You must never look after the pence, then 
The pounds will run after themselves. 
4 
t 
PERVERTED PROVERBS. 
(Continued.) 
Rolling moss gathers no stone, 
in this marvellous work I 
have read, 
Deep waters run very still, 
The least mended soonest said; 
Half a 
none's better than loaf ; 
So let this be your plan, 
Never push the bill 
When its going down the man; 
It's a 
very wise father knows his own child, 
And it ought to be written in gold 
That it's best to be off with the new love 
Before you get on with the old. 
When the wits in the wine's out, 
More speed less haste we learn, 
Once a 
child twice a 
man, 
So do a 
good can when you turn; 
Those who live in stone houses, 
Shouldn't throw glass, I'm sure, 
When love comes in at the window, 
Poverty flies from the door ; 
Late to bed and late to rise, 
It is the truth I 
tell, 
Will make you unhealthy, not wealthy, nor wise, 
But make you look wretched as well. 
When the mice are away the cats play, 
So bear this well in mind, 
The proof of the eating is in 
The pudding you'll always find; 
On worse and you farther will fare, 
So no more in the book will I 
dip, 
But remember there's many a 
lip 
Betwixt the cup and the slip; 
Brevity is the wit of soul, 
So I 
will finish my strain, 
And sing to you the rest of my proverbs 
Whenever you call again.

The sunset, my darling, is now on the waters, 
The hour is nigh when from you I 
must go ; 
But true to my colleen, I'll come o'er the ocean, 
Back to the land where the shamrock does grow; 
Keep back your tears, love, and whisper your kind words, 
Soon we'll be parted, but, darling, I 
know 
You ne'er will forget me, though waves roll between us, 
Your image will follow wherever I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
You never will forget me, though waves roll between us, 
Your image will follow wherever I 
go ; 
But true to my colleen, I'll come o'er the ocean, 
Back to the land where the shamrock does grow. 
When o'er the ocean ' mid strangers I 
wander, 
Think of my sadness I 
felt day by day ; 
That you cannot cheer me, for you can't be near me, 
But time, then, my darling, must soon pass away; 
Then with my heart throbbing wildly with pleasure, 
Safe in your arms, love, again ne'er to go; 
Then will our days be the bright days of sunshine, 
Safe in the land where the shamrock does grow.

In the old Car'lina State, 
Where the sweet magnolia blooms, 
And the pickaninny darkey learns to hoe, 
There is one 1 
long to see, 
She was always true to me, 
But I 
left her many, many years ago. 
'Mid the cotton and the corn, 
There we both were bred and born, 
And together in the field we used to sow, 
But 'tis twenty years or more 
Since I 
left the cabin door, 
So I'm going back to see my darling Clo'. 
CHORUS. 
Darling Clo', darling Clo', 
Your sweet face I 
soon shall see, I 
know, 
Where the Southern sunny breeze 
Falls the old palmetto trees, 
I 
am going home to see my darling Clo'. 
In that dear old sunny home 
Where the songsters always sing, 
And the mocking- bird is singing all the day, 
She is waiting for her Joe, 
And I 
long to see my Clo', 
For like me I 
know her hair has turned to gray. 
The plantation is no more, 
And the day of toil is o'er, 
For she's creeping very close to eighty-three, 
But she'll wait till I 
come back, 
By the coon and possum track, 
For I 
have not seen her since we all were free. 
Ciro.—Darling Clo', etc. 
'Neath the genial Southern skies, 
Where the sweetest blossoms grow, 
And the music-loving darkeys all are gay, 
I 
am bound to see my Clo', 
And 'tis very sad to know 
That ere long they'll lay my poor old love away. 
When they place her ' neath the sod, 
Upon which we often trod, 
Then this world will have no other charms for me, 
Then close by my Cloie's side 
This poor form will there abide, 
'NciaVi the shadeless and the tall palmetto tree. 
CEtO.—Darling Clo', etc.

Man the life boat! man the life boat! 
Help ! or you ship is lost ; 
Man the life boat! man the life boat! 
See how she's tempest- tossed; 
No human power in such an hour 
The gallant bark can save; 
Her mainmast's gone, and hurrying on, 
She seeks a 
watery grave. 
Man the life boat! man the life boat! 
See the dreadful signal flies; 
Ha! she has struck, and from the rock 
Despairing shouts arise ; 
And one there stands and wrings his hands, 
Amidst the tempest wild, 
For on the beach he cannot reach 
lie sees his wife and child. 
Life-saving ark! yon doomed bark 
Immortal souls doth bear; 
Not gems, nor gold, nor wealth untold, 
But men, brave men are there! 
Oh, speed the life boat! speed the life boat ! 
Oh, God ! their efforts crown ! 
She dashes on—the ship is gone 
Full forty fathoms down. 
Ah, see! the crew are struggling now 
Amidst the billows' roar ; 
They're in the boat ! they're all afloat! 
Hurrah! they've gained the shore. 
Bless the life boat ! bless the life boat! 
Oh, Thou'lt hear our prayer ; 
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat! 
No longer we'll despair.

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But au ! there comes another day,

The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that every fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle power 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me ; 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answering heart 
Beats time to your caresses. - 
Hush ! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me ; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love we, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them ; 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me ; 
Ah! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright, happy moments gone by; 
We 
trod. the old paths that we knew 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A 
merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew 
I 
beard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true ; 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem. 
Oh, vision, return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be my dream.

The mother's heart was o'erladen with care, 
Her eyes oft filled with tears, 
And the father of trouble had borne his share 
For the son they'd not seen for years. 
In an angry mood he had gone away, 
And left them in grief and pain ; 
Oh, would be could hear his parents say, 
Come back to the old home again. 
CFIOltliS. 
Ye winds that blow o'er every sea 
Bear with you our sorrowing strain, 
To our wandering boy, where'er he may be, 
Come back to the old home again. 
In vain his chamber is kept prepared, 
In vain they watch the door, 
In hope of news from him who had dared 
To leave them forevermore. 
He lies dead in the bush ' neath the burning sky 
Of Australia's boundless plain, 
And never again will hear them cry, 
Come back to the old home again.

Bright vision of my dreams.

will softly whisper 
My heart's fond love to thee, 
That fading years can never change, 
Whate'er my lot may be. 
Come where the moonbeams linger 
And rippling waters play 
Come when the day hath faded, 
With footsteps light and gay, 
Where the bright stars shine above us, 
And we breathe our hearts' fond vow, 
That truth alone may guide us 
Where'er on earth we go.

Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more, 
But the look in the eyes when they meet mine 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er ! 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all, 
Yet all day in my heart it echoed, 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed, 
But that smile will still be remembered 
AS long as my life shall last. 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee; 
But there's naught that this world containeth 
Half so dear as this woman to me.

I 
stood on the bridge at midnight, 
As the clock was striking the hour, 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Behind the dark church tower, 
And, like the waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That filled mine eyes with tears 
How often, oh, how often, 
In the days that had gone by. 
I 
had stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky! 
How often, oh, how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky! 
How often, oh, how often, 
I 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
'Would bear me away on its bosom, 
O'er the ocean wild and wide. 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care, 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear. 
But now it has fallen from -me, 
It is buried in the sea, 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me. 
Yet whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Conies the thought of other years: 
And forever and. forever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As a 
symbol of love in heaven, 
And its wavering image here.

They say I 
may marry the laird if I 
will, 
The laird of high degree, 
And jewels so fair I 
may twine in my hair, 
And a 
lady I'll surely be; 
But oh, where would my heart be, 
In spite of my gems so gay, 
My heart it would break for somebody's sake, 
So I 
think I 
had better say nay. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
will marry my own love, 
My own love, my own love, 
And I 
will marry my own love, 
For true of heart am I. 
So the laird may marry the lady, 
The lady of high degree, 
And jewels so fair she may twine in her hair, 
They are befter for her than me; 
And gayly I'll dance at the bridal, 
I'll merrily dance on the lea, 
With Susan, and Alice, and Emma, 
But Donald shall dance with me! 
CH0.—And I 
will marry etc. 
So the laird he married the lady, 
The lady of high degree, 
And the lowland lassie he loved so well 
Abode in her own country; 
For oh! where would my heart be, 
Was ever her constant cry, 
If ever I'd dared to marry the laird? 
Why, Donald would surely die!

will marry, etc.

The little Isle of Emerald Green 
Has suffered sore of late ; 
Her wants have been quite numerous, 
Her miseries were great ; 
Till kindly hearts and kindly hands 
Subscriptions freely gave 
The lives of our poor countrymen, 
From death through want to save. 
ononus. 
In Ireland's hour of need 
We found true friends indeed 
Who sent both help and comfort to our Sireland 
There will never pass a 
day 
But what we all will say, 
May heaven bless the friends of dear old Ireland. 
Without a 
shelter or a 
crust, 
Our countrymen have been 
Sad objects in our lovely isle, 
Where plenty once was seen-; 
But they never were forgotten, 
For Columbia stood at hand, 
To give relief to those in need 
In our dear native land. 
CH0.—In Ireland's hour, etc. 
Pat never was ungrateful, 
And he never can forget 
The kindness of America. 
And he'll always own the debt. 
As lotte as life is left to him, 
You'll find him brave and true, 
And he'll bless the Stars and Stripes, 
The flag of the red white and blue.

I'm a 
jovial sort of man, 
That you can plainly see, 
I 
lead an active sort of life, 
And nothing troubles me; 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
All cares I 
cast away, 
I 
always feel so jolly, 
And sing and say each day. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love to sit by the fire so bright 
At home on a 
cold and winter's night, 
With my children on my knee, 
Then my heart is full of glee, 
As I'm smoking my old clay pipe. 
I 
have a 
charming little wife, 
And children full of glee, 
Their sweet and prattling voices are 
Such joy and bliss to me. 
I 
love my dog, I 
love my gun, 
I'm happy day and night, 
And when my daily toil is o'er 
I 
keep my pipe alight. 
CH0.—I 
love to sit, etc. 
We may have diff'rent tastes, 
And diff'rent whims and ways, 
And though our path of life be rough, 
We may see brighter days. 
We oft build castles in the air, 
We often crack a 
joke, 
But at the finish all will end 
Without a 
doubt in smoke.

There is a 
pretty little maiden that I 
ever dearly love, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
would ask for nothing more, 
If she would share my heart and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell. 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
T 
he dear Italian girl I 
love so well, 
Her father was a 
brigand on the mountain. 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And since she set me free, my heart will ever bo 
A 
captive to the dear Italian girl. 
While roaming through the village ' nea.th the blue and 
sunny sky, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong 
Did capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my eyes. 
A 
victim I 
was quickly led aloncr; 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should 
pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little- 
mountain maid 
They would have not permitted me to live. 
Cno.—Her father was, etc. 
They put me in a 
dungeon where I 
thought that I 
should 
die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band 
Was plundering poor travellers this lovely maid came nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She tore my bonds asunder, bade me rise, and set me free, 
And from her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her eyes, 
The secret of our hearts was plainly told. 
CI10.—Her father was, ete.

Proud and lowly, beggar and lord, 
Over the bridge they go; 
Rags and velvet, fetter and sword, 
Poverty, pomp, and woe; 
Laughing, weeping, hurrying ever, 
Hour by hour they crowd along, 
While, below, the mighty river 
Sings them all a 
mocking song. 
CHORUS. 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, 
All is vanity ' neath the sun ; 
Velvet and rags, so the world wags, 
Until the river no more shall run. 
Dainty, painted, powdered and gay, 
Rolleth my lady by; 
Rags-and-tatters, over the way, 
Carries a 
heart as high. 
Flowers and dreams from country meadows, 
Dust and din through city skies, 
Old men creeping with their shadows, 
Children with their sunny eyes— 
CH0.—Hurry along, sorrow, etc. 
Storm and sunshine, peace and strife, 
Over the bridge they go; 
Floating on in the tide of life, 
Whither no man shall know. 
Who will miss them there to-morrow, 
Waifs that drift to the shade of sun ? 
.one away with their songs and sorrow; 
Only the river still flows on. 
Cita—Hurry along, sorrow, etc.

" 
The fisherman and his child are drowned !" 
Caine ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around. 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
" 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
see— 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
see." 
CHORUS. 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep: 
" 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep ; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep." 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild ; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head. 
He cried in despair, " Thy will be done !" 
The child he loved was dead; 
He cried in despair, " Thy will be done!" 
The child he loved was dead. 
Co.—'Twas the voice of, etc. 
And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore; 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer. 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
in death they found him there ; 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
in death they found him there.

Give me the spade, and the man who can use it, 
A 
fig for your lord and his soft silken hand; 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give it back to the giver, the land, boys, the land; 
There's no bank like the earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighbor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the spade and the man who can use it, 
A 
fio• for your lord and his soft silken hand; 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give it back to the giver, the land, boys, the land. 
Give me the spade, old America's glory, 
That fashioned the field from the black barren moor; 
Let us speak in its praise with ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore; 
in was not the sword that won our best battle, 
Created our commerce, extended our trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children and cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons, the spade, boys, the spade. 
CH0.—Give me the spade, etc. 
Give me the spade ; there's a 
magic about it 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold; 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without it, 
When the land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold ? 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrunk back afraid, 
The corn- stack is raised and man claims a 
dwelling: 
Then hurrah t 
for our true friend, the spade, boys, the 
spade. 
Cno,—Give me the spade, etc.

In a 
row of tenement houses 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair; 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there, 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair; 
Maiden with a 
yaller bulldog 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing— 
Just to hear that maiden sing; 
! 
he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog ; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah I 
hurrah hurrah I 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom, of his trousers 
For the dog to chew that day.
