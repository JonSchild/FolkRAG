Abstract
 
Certain animal shelters , primarily cowsheds, of a t
y � almost unique
 
to the Mormon Country of Utah, Southern Idaho, and Northern Arizona were
 
built according to traditional patterns from materials l
c4ally available.
 
Now rapidly vanishing from. the landscape, they were from the 1650,0 1G to the
 
193C'L the predominant animal shelter st
ructure in the region.  What was
 
used i
in the earlier colonial period is r
iot knoim, and whera the ideal can

cross,; with a A
t
er 
-
 i
-oouth extension: running throul;b
.
 
the "Core" as `
ar aoarth as the f

(preferably from border to border), and one or two
 
east­wast traver e
as where convenient.  Take notes on
 
as many shads as possible but (probably) not on a
l.l
 
of them.  3
s especially aware of regional style
 
changes, if any.
 
2) lnwdepith sl

analyzes all the sh9ds of a particular t
opographic
 
map, or partio,: of a r

each map covers a little
 
over 50 square miles);
,
 
2
. Observation along traverse or at intensive study sites.  Note
 
all data which can be obtainod from the road or by walking to
 
the structure in the field.  Record data by:
 
a
. Written notes, or filling; a check sheet on each structuro.
 
B
. Sketching the essentials of the shed.  Field sketching is
 
most useful in r
fo
d ,
ic
e the observer to think about morphology,
 
function,
, location, value, etc. at the site of the feature,
,
 
e
. Photographs.  Especially valuable s
ince much about shed
 
morphology can be deduced from them months later. Any typa
 
of photographic systam is useful.
 
1
) Ideally, use a camera system with A  x 2A negatives o 
single-lens reflex with interchangeable lenses and
 
film backs.  Coast: approximately 51500-
2) A Polaroid camera has the advantage that rotes can be
 
written directly on the Print in the field. Thus you
 
can record details you might net remember or recogni =
 
later, or point out hidden data blocked by clutter in
 
t
he foreground,
 etc.
 
3
) Otherrise, a
ny suitable 35mm
 camera for color slides or
 
black-and-white--
-slides for lectures and black-and-white
 
for publication.  The telephoto is valuable if the shed
 
is off in the distance, and a A M-angle :
ions is helpful
 
for pictures of interiors.
 
5
. Interviewing local informants.  Use cassette recorder if possible.
 
a. Sample direct questions
 
1
) "What is that -
shed over there used for?''
 
2) Who built it? !
4
;ien?
 
3) "Are old ones being replaced?  When thi
s one is gorse,
 
what will you replace it with?''
 
4
) "Where die; these posts (
poles, willows) come from?''
 
5
) "Mow often do you think the straw (
or other covering)
 
has had to be replaced?''
 
V
i
i
) "Where d
i
al the idea (
or atyla) come from?"
 
b
. indirectly, try t
o determine hoar farmers use the structures,
,
 
what farmers without sheers do (
or did) to shelter animals...
 
_
-IT  m a other thoughts
 
A
. Don't gat caught in a dotgiled investigation of variations of atandtrd
 
forms.  There will be endle ss minute differences a
n
d
 
v
a
r ati
.ons in f
orm
 
and motif.  These are only significant if they are carried over largo
 
contigt
i
u Ts areas, or f
ound in quantity in geograpyically
 disjunct
 
areas o nor the most part it is the major themes that must be determined,
 
not the variations on them.
 
B
. Stablish dominent fora hypes for classification
_ 1mrposeso
 
C
. The farm of the sheds will be the easiest parnmetcr to determine, but
 
it may not be the most significant. Determine relative significance
 
of f
orm, value, and f
unction.
 
D
. Look: for evidence of changes through time.  This is another dimension
 
which may be of interest to the folklorist as r
a m
e dification of
 
traditional matter.  For example, then loose otr:aw ( the ideal covering)
 
was no longer available, sometimes baled straw (not t
he best) was used.
 
Is this evidence of clin,ing to tradition (
the use of straw), or manly
 
the lack of other materials?
 
0. The data sheet.  It should if possible be a single paCa.  It can be filled
 
out during the interview with informant or itme:diately afterward from nlotes�
 
In the present study, data sheets were filled out for 53 of the 334
 
structures observed and classified in f
ield notes.

evidence. They wera beginai

;rain in the stack
 
yard. With the 1930's came t
h:e combine harvesters to this region; the
 
grain e
ras no longer bound by a binder but was harvest ed in the  field e
:ith
 
the straw left lying. Some of it was baled in the f
ield; hence the
 
baled straw replacement on some of the shed tops.  But mostly, the old
 
straw blew off and was not replaced ; leaving only skeletal rooas a

A gorri example of tno -
Ir gradual disappearance is in the town of
 
F
:Vtton, Utah.  In 1915-
1925 there were ten families :
in the town
 
living in horses having adjacent corrals, stack: y
,ards, and sheds.
 
In every ,
yard there was at least one '
type C shed.  Today (
1972),
 
only one remains, and only four of the remaining hcu
:
•
.;es are inhabited.
 
The hay is now baled and pi
 led in terraced stacks.  "
Ihe straw, if
 
saved, is baled.  The f
amily mill: herd is a thing of the vast, since
 
m
_-1
_lk can be purchased daily from the stores in Kar
_os': or rillmore, a
 uw
 
an easy driving distance away.  There now resrains no evidence t
hat such
 
cowsheds ever existed in Hatton.  The consolidation of small family
 
:
.
,
°ms into fewer large operations is .
a factor in this change also.

3anadian life zones.  Three varieties of juniper (Locally called cedar)
 
thrive at these elevations, providing wood that had many uses in the
 
Pnst.  Because of their accessibility and an almost everlasting resirtr.rca
 
to decays they wore particularly useful as f
ence Do='-,

Dear Hector:
 
The enclosed just reached me; i
t seems relatively official, s
o I
'm
 
forwarding i
t to you for your disposal.  I
t s
ounds a pleasant oppor-
tunity for a bit of free advertisement.
 
I have been terribly remiss on this point, but during the AFS meetings
 
in :
Nashville way l
ast fall, a young l
ady a
s ked me  about hosting the
 
1
975 CFS meetings, and I promised to get the word to you.  Perhaps
 
she's a
lready taken matters into her own hands, but just in case, her
 
name i
s Conte Hoffman and she's at Marymount P
.V. College; i
t's a
 
two year Junior College l
ocated at Rancho Palos Verdes, and she's
 
already gotten her President's okay.  Perhaps you'd l
ike to check i
nto
 
this further; I really don't know much about the set-up there -
- the
 
Marymount I
'm acquainted with i
s apparently a different campus.
 
Now, as to the matter of the nominations, I
've just spoken with Joan
 
Perkal c
oncerning the mysterious constitution, and s
he will be getting
 
the most recent to you a
long with a l
ist of positions that should be
 
f
illed in 1
974.  As far a
s chairing the nominations committee goes, I
 
am naturally most f
lattered and pleased; however, i
t seems a
ll too
 
l
ikely that I will not be able t
o attend this year's meeting myself
 
(
the f
irst one I will have missed in a l
ong t
ime).  My problem i
s that
 
I must be in New York f
or a month or s
ix weeks this spring to do a
 
particular
 job, and I
've been waiting for some t
ime now to hear just
 
when.  S
ince I s
till haven't heard, i
t seems more and more l
ikely that
 
the fatal t
ime will include the month of Apri
l.  It does  seem
 proper
 to  
me Wor the chairman of a nominating
, committee to be on hand at the meeting
 
i
tself, both to make the report and to receive any l
ast minute suggestions,
 
make changes and the l
ike; s
o perhaps I had better decline for this year.
 
I
'd be g
lad to serve on the committee, of course, if you want me to -
- and
 
a
ssuming i
ts affairs can he handled by correspondence; I
'll leave that to
 
your best judgment.
 
Anyway, I
'll s
till hope that some lucky accident occurs and I can make the
 
meeting after a
ll.  I
'd l
ove to explore your campus more thoroughly, and
 
of course I a
lways enjoy my annual visit w
ith you.  So I
'll keep my fingers
 
crossed in proper f
olkloristic fashion.  Anyway, a
ll the best ,
 
Yours,
