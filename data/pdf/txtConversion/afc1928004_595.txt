Oh! where is the hut that used to be here, 
That good, that good old sunny home; 
Oh! where is the darkies that I 
used to hear, 
Before I 
turned to roam. 
They used to be happy when singing in the corn, 
But alas, they sing no more; 
Oh! they never dreamt of trouble or pain, 
In them sunny days of yore. 
CHORUS. 
Take me home, take me home, 
To that dear old sunny home, 
Take me back, take me there for evermore, 
Let me hear the banjo ring, 
And the merry darkies sing, 
As I 
have heard in them sunny days of yore. 
Now I 
think I'se a-goin' to the old cabin in the lane, 
And all the darkies assembled there; 
From early morn till night, it was ever their delight, 
For to sing and dance for no one they did fear. 
But when the war broke out no more their 
joyous shout, 
For all was bright and clear among the cane, 
So no longer they could stay, so they traveled 
far away, 
And it Md. 
those darkies hearts so full of pain.

Where the waters gently flowing, 
Near a 
handsome little cot; 
Dwells a 
lovely little maiden, 
A 
charming sweet forget-me-not. 
She has large blue eyes and golden hair, 
And a 
pretty set of teeth; 
Who has promised for to meet me, 
Where the roses fall asleep.

Oh! my, she is so charming, (Sym) 
She is such a 
darling,

Where the roses fall asleep. 
She is so charming and so merry, 
And she meets me with a 
smile; 
This lovely little blue-eyed maiden, 
I 
know that she does love me all the while. 
And when I 
do meet this-bud, 
I

Which will make her heart feel gladened,

Where the mocking-birds sings so sweetly, 
Many years ago; 
Where the sweet magnolia blossomed; 
Pure and white as snow. 
Where I 
never thought that sorrow, 
Grief nor pain could come, 
For to crush the joys and pleasure 
Of my sunny home. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I'm weeping. yes, I'm weeping, 
And sadly I 
must roam, must roam, 
Must I 
leave thee, I 
must leave thee, 
Good-by, sunny home. 
Flowers bloom, and flowers wither, 
Around the cabin door; 
And birds that sang so sweetly, 
Sing alas no more. 
Little did I 
think when happy, 
That I 
would have to roam, 
Ind leave behind my youth and pleasure, 
In ray sunny home. 
Chorus. 
Other forms and stranger faces. 
Is all that I

Which will bring to-morrow, 
Fondly loved ones who are dear to me. 
How my poor heart sinks within me, 
When I 
turned to roam, 
Far from those I 
loved and cherished, 
Good-by sunny home,

We come to-night, to tell you all, 
That we have got a 
holiday; 
And we are going to the ball. 
For Pete and Hanna both feel good. 
We will dance the gay quadrille, 
For music charms, we can't keep still, 
There will be lots of fun, you bet there will, 
Singing and dancing, kissing, too; 
Throwing around' our great big shoes, 
As around the hall we spread, 
When Pete and Hannah both get wed. 
The two fat gals that weighed a 
ton, 
Are coming for to have some fun; 
And Captain Primrose he will be there, 
With his Angelina, oh! so fair. 
Goodness! won't them wenches swell, 
With perfume won't they smell, 
And their lover's they will tell, 
That we will join them in the dance; 
Oh! my, won't them wenches prance, 
Like a 
jackass they will tread, 
When Pete and Hannah both get wed. 
am old Uncle Jasper and I 
came from Tennessee, 
Where the darkies plant the cotton and the corn, 
And in that sunny clime where happiness used to be, 
It was there this darkie he was barn. 
And the darkies used to gather when their work 
was done, 
They would sing them songs, them songs so 
dear to me, 
And I 
never shall forget, they are in my memory yet. 
And I 
am thinking of my home in Tennessee. 
CHORUS. 
For the darkies all am gone and forever laid away, 
I 
hope their souls will happy be; 
ForI know that I 
must go to that happy place, I 
know, 
Yet there is no place like my home in Tenessee. 
My relations and my friends they are scattered 
all about, 
And my good old home ain't where it used to be, 
For the darkies all am gone and no more will 
they shout, 
The dear old songs which filled my heart with glee. 
They are gone to that dear old home the happy 
promised land, 
Where you can't go there until your soul is saved; 
And bright angels they are waiting for to take 
me by the hand, 
And they'll welcome home this old worn out slave. 
I 
know that I 
am old and my hair is turning gray, 
And my feet they are getting stiff and sore; 
And my good old 'nesse is sleeping in the grave, 
And his sweet smiling face I'll see no more. 
But I'm going back again to them cotton fields, 
To the place where happiness used to be, 
And then I 
will lay me down my weary bones I'll rest, 
In my good old home in Tennessee, 
Chorus.

In that hut there lives my love, 
She is so kind and true; 
She is the sunshine of my heart, 
My pretty blonde in blue. 
Don't I 
love to see her pretty face, 
In all its glorious hue, 
Like the morning flowers, when 
They're covered up with dew. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
my, her form's entrancing, 
And with joy I'm dancing; 
She is my charming beauty, 
And I 
love her, so I 
do; 
With her rosy soft complexion, 
This pretty blonde in blue.

Pretty blonde in blue. 
Now my pretty little blonde, 
We will meet to-morrow night, 
When the moon is out in full, 
And the pretty stars shine bright. 
Down where the roses bloom, 
I 
will be waiting there for you, 
I 
have a 
secret, don't forget, 
My pretty blonde in blue.

In childhood's happy hours, many a 
happy day 
I 
spent, 
Down by the old mill stream; 
When we used to go together I 
never shall forget, 
We would laugh and chat and dance upon 
the green. 
33n them days have passed away, and my hair 
is turning gray, 
And it fills this darkies heart so full of pain, 
When I 
think of my younger days, when I 
would stroll away, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
CHORUS. 
But them days have passed and gone, and 
our hearts it is forlorn, 
For the good old days will never come again; 
When we used to go together, and pass down 
by the lawn, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
Well do we remember, when our daily work was done 
The songs old mosso he would like, ' 
And he would play us lots of music, and we 
have such fun, 
For to see them all a-walking for that cake. 
But the cruel war broke out way down in the 
sunny south, 
And we had to leave the cotton fields and roam; 
And then we bid good-by with tears in our eyes, 
To the old wooden gate that's near the lane.

SUNG 
BY PIT ROONEY WITH 
GREAT 
SUCCESS. 
My name it is O'Halloher, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few and small. 
Some blackguards 'tother day did come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
And they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game ef ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out in " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all. 
I 
put up my hands to catch a " fly," 
Holy murther, it struck me in tho eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball, 
I 
thought to Sanfrancisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all. 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said ould man you made a 
fowl . 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know my name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for my photograph 
To hang upon the wall, 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Though my head was broke and my 
shoulders laras;' 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball.

THE SUP OF GOOD WHISKEY 
AT GERITYIS WAKE 
Och! lads, when poor Andy was dying, 
The hand ov us all he would take, 
And said, will you whist wid your crying, 
'Till called down to Gerity's wake ! 
Me Widdy will furnish the whiskey, 
And superintind the nate job; 
Her sister will get gay and frisky, 
And drink to me health wid a 
sob. 
So there may be whiskey in plenty; 
Much trouble me widdy will take, 
When I'm wid the dozen or twinty 
Made happy at Gerity's wake. 
I 
never could rade in the papers, 
But spell like a 
pig on the wing; 
And divil a 
one in his capers, 
Can bate Andy whin he would sing. 
And now I 
must sleep wid the many 
Who turn up their toes, and can't shake, 
And when I 
am dry, can't drink any 
Good '
whiskey at Gerity's wake. 
Chorus. 
CoNTENTITED. 
Old Finnegin's wake was so jolly, 
A-bar-ring the ructions that night, 
But some of the byes thought it folly, 
To go home widout a 
frae fight. 
And so they wint in for the whiskey, 
To plaze the poor widdy so lone, 
And divil a 
wan but was frisky, 
A-waking the corpse cold as stone! 
Chorus. 
That night whin his soul had departed, 
And Keeners were howling so wild, 
The widdy, so lone, broken-hearted, 
Was drinking their health like a 
child. 
The corpse was rolled up like a 
mummy, 
And divil a 
word could it spake! 
Och I 
sure it alone was the dummy, 
That night, at poor Gerity's -wake! 
Chorus. 
Ov course there was plenty of whiskey, 
And divil a 
farthing to pay; 
The dear mon we tried to make frisky, 
But never a 
word would he say! 
And faith I 
may I 
niver be shriven, 
If I 
in the morning could shall 
The hand of that lone widdy given 
To those down at Gerity's wake I

Last winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Ray did yon say, 
Well, ' tis Myself that knows it, for it's inanv's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man MeGniness didr t 
get no job at all. 
The polittehms promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Alt! six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and thn't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new shoes k. 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad. they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or win, 
And that one thing l'd like to say of your old man and mine 
Chorus. 
! 
the spring time now is coming well all have plenty wok. 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, allure he's a 
handsome clerk. 
You soould see 'him clinnbtlie ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is always bawling, hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
Ah I 
the old man he is always careful, nothing he lets fall, 
The divit a word you'd hear him say to my old man at all.

I

For my clothes are tat'ed and torn, 
My parents died when I 
was young, 
I'm forsaken, dislikd and forlorn.

They say why don't you go to work, 
Wiled they know there's none to be had, 
They slam the door in front of your face, 
If you ask them for a

Some tramps they beg from door to door. 
And they ask for charity, 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't support their family, 
But place a 
nickle in their band, 
To some grog shop they will run, 
poor inan's money they will take,

Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak and sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
workingman's poor family, 
'Twits at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapped at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave me bread and tea, 
Be was a 
son of Erin's bile, 
Toiling for his family. 
CHORUS , 
shook his hand so hard and tough, 
And the tears rolled fast down my floe, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
Fur you're welcome always at his plate,

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know,

And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
Tha night I 
learned to swim.

Swim out, says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over- hand, says brother Jill], 
The gang did shout, as the dragged me out,

Oh I " chaw roast beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chine-. 
I 
made back-dives, and somtner-saults, 
Along with Shorty Tint; . 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
I 
was chock fall of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made ine drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jitn-jam-jims.

And faith drilled us three times a

Received orders from head-quarters,

To fight the red-skin Indians, 
And the " Nagur " fusileers ;

And shipped us to New York City,

From our toes clean to our ears, 
We resigned our post of honor,

O'er the waves v 
e 
swiftly go, 
Heedless of the sailor's warning. 
Where the foam-capped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reach 
Make our hearts with juy elated, 
Off fur Coney Isrand Beach. 
Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reach, 
While we find enough commotion; 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
Oa this breezy summer day. 
And with charming friends around us, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that. isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our reach, 
Where we banish all our sailness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver. 
But o .r 
hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing. 
All our lonely ones should teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing, 
Down on Cony Island beach.

And listen to de music of de ole banjo.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden now, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago. 
tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's sin- tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay; 
Then G..d in sweat compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His fireless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced.

Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died,

In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To Gods all- wise decree. 
He only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sca'ding tears will start, 
And longly I 
crave to clasp 
My lust one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could cliooae, 
In realms where glory reia.ns, 
l'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow,

Early in the morn we started, 
With spirits light and gay, 
Shure the boss were all light-hearted, 
For it was New- Year's Day. 
We hired a 
new buffalo robe, 
And a 
big wash- tub sleigh. 
With an old lame mule inside the shafts, 
To make calls on New- Year's Day. 
CHORUS. 
Pais, up and down, all ihro' the town, 
In a 
great bi.4 wash- tub sleigh. 
We'd sing a 
song as we drove along, 
Making calls on New- Year's Day. 
The very first call that we made, 
On " Mary Ann Kehoe," 
Mary Ann was scrubbing the stairs, 
It, was her turn you know. 
When she saw the delegation, 
She raised the pail that way, 
Threw suds and soap on Burke s 
white duck vest, 
With compliments of the day. 
Chorus. 
On Dan " McCarthy's Boarding House," 
The second call we made, 
He treated us to whiskey sours, 
Snow-
cake and lenion-aid. 
We ate a 
seven pound turkey. 
Each man drank a 
bowl of lay, 
Buried Dan's wife to her neck in snow, 
in the yard on New- Year s 
Day. 
We visited all our old friends, 
At moon-rise we were tight. 
We could not tell our own cur- names, 
We were near froze that niAht. 
Worst of all the last call we made, 
The mule be run away, 
Oh! we walked home on our hands an imam, 
A.nd that wound up New-Year's Day.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
C 'MRCS. 
Go for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken. 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the 
home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chills the poor wanderer. friendless afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he w-oing? 
Must he repose ' neatli the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking. 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is wailing to welcome her boy. 
Chorus. 
CONTINUED. 
Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield hitn from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting. 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, 4tc, 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home he has wandered a 
stranger. 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lost. friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcLane her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, Le, 
Go for my boy to-night! search through the city t 
Tell him that. mother will never for..tet! 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yeti 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy;. 
Bear him this mes sage, whereer he is straying, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her by.

Come, oh! eome to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the fairest of pearls strew the shore,

Come, oh ! come to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the sunshine of life is so fair, 
And the waves throb with dain, thee as calm as the heart, 
That would win thee such true love t, share.

Where the pleasures of life may be found ; 
We will pick up the shells which are strewn on the shore,

We'll speak words of love on the sands of the sea, 
And my home shall be i

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LUIS.-
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's 01 about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chanute' 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mai% 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Cholla. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've Ilia many a jaunt together, dear boy, 
j 
But my next aunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opcned in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my end song, • 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, 
(my dance) 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy.

father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
He called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connecticsur 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinction, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
Only a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh! how the words grate on my ,ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
'No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
I 
shall there meet my old friends,

We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade— 
Old Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Kerrigan was dressed,.I do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap. 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with and. grease, 
Re had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the Ill-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos, cr.' 
l, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA!" 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas. her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the cherished 
one relaxed their loving embrace, and when again the mother 
beheld the little pieader the once bright eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that, of the angels.

In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake,

I 
heard of a 
preacher who once made a 
remark, 
Saying actors never could, 
Get in at the gate of heaven, 
Or do anything that was good. 
Now I 
think he was wrong in saying these words, 
For I 
know two or three of the boys, 
Who done good things in their life-time, 
And never made any noise. 
Now there was a 
man called Big Billy Devere, 
He sat up day and night, 
To nurse poor Stevy Rogers when sick, 
While others turned tail in affright. 
And Whittaker, lately hurt in New York, 
Had many to come to his aid; 
And a 
number of others, I 
could name if I 
choose, 
Who are now in the church-yard laid. 
One day lately, I 
went across town, 
To an actor that I 
know; 
He lived in a 
tenement house up town, 
A 
place called Poverty Row. 
Times had been hard with him lately, 
Harder than ever before; 
So I 
thought I 
would go and give him a 
lift 
From my own rather humble store. 
I 
knocked at his door, no answer came. 
I 
listened all was still; 
And over my whole being 
There crept a 
death-like chill; 
I 
called for help, the neighbors came, 
We busted in the door. 
And found the object of our search, 
Lying dead upon the floor. 
Be had died of a 
broken weary heart, 
0! God, can such things really be, 
In this great heaving, throbbing world, 
And no one near to see. 
Yes, there is One, my friends, 
Who notes the sparrows fall, 
Whose loving eyes are ever on 
The Sinner, Saint, and all. 
A 
postal card beside him lay, 
I 
stooped and picked it up; 
It told the sad, sad story. 
How grief had over-run his cup, 
For on one side I 
plaiuly read 
The actors home and name, 
While on the other, were the words, 
Ito Opening, write again. 
Be had went away and left us, 
Gone to a 
happier home; 
Gone to Him who bade us all, 
Suffer little ones to come, 
Gone to that bright and happy land, 
Where there's no sorrow care or paiii 
To a 
manager who never said, 
No Opening, write again.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the tarn]. 
C110111i. 
It's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
Wz thought john would be our proteeti01), 
For he was so kind when a 
boy ; 
And Betsey so gentle aid loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he 
as led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm; 
And left, his old parents in sorrow, 
To sutler or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he li.veless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
t% it It none to protect us from harm; 
We only can uffer in silence, 
Or tearfay mortgage tha farzn.

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
13nt I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, , 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young.

RECITED BY WALTER MACK. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAUI.DIE =EDER. 
He was old, and weak, and shabbily dressed, 
The time-beaten wreck of a 
man; 
Whose story the passer-by, might have guessed. 
If the face he had stopped to scan. 
Fate had dealt him many a 
blow, 
Now squarely, and now from behind; 
With sickness and poverty laying him low, 
Then cruelly making him blind. 
As I 
dropped a 
dollar into his hat, 
I 
said, your lot is hard; 
But he cheerfully answered, " yes it is that, 
For I'm blind, and poor, and bared 
From all that gives to life its joy; 
Yet, perhaps it's only my share; 
For the man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to* bear. 
I 
walked through a 
famous up-town square. 
And I 
envied the rich man's ease; 
But, lo! on the silver door-knob, there, 
A 
crape fluttered out on the breeze. 
! 
this, I 
reflected, is gold's alloy, 
And I 
muttered to empty air; 
The Man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear.

LIFE'S CROSSES. 
CONTINUED. 
I 
heard the plaudits and laughter ring, 
In a 
theatre packed to the walls; 
Where the Star was a 
famous comedy king, 
Who smiled in response to the calls; 
Yet I 
knew he had buried— that day—the joy 
Of a 
life, with his dead child fair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
poet who labored long, 
In anguish and want, alone, 
Till he rose on the mightynwings of song. 
To the heights which few have known. 
Then fell the blight of desease to destroy 
The sweets he had won in despair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
judge who was honered of men, 
For the power and place he had won; 
Yet the felon one day in the prisoner's pen, 
Was the judge's only son. 
And the iron law the judge could employ, 
While the father was crushed in despair. 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
And thinking of this, how wealth and fame, 
And honor and power and all; 
May each have its grief to hide, or its shame, 
I 
could not choose, but re:mil. 
The words that beggar blind could employ. 
In his cheery philosophy rare; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet, 'tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had node; 
Hard words may be.used, but I 
like him the most, 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wring I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorus. 
'behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
von can't do him no good, do him no harm;

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bight stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Danes.) 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer do is gently dawning, 
Lifting night s 
be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowins-, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life he pure, 
Nay her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure. 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises sing.ir-d 
For to all sweet mirth she's by.'
