John Talley: He got it, and I happened to be over there when he come up. Fine looking fella, dressed
to beat the band. As he walked the street ??? head on it ??? still got ??? diamond on the diamond
ring. ??? told me he thought that maybe I could get a drink of whiskey from you? I said “Yes, I got
some whiskey. Come into the house won't you?” “Oh no,” he said, “I couldn't do that.” He said “If you
go over there and bring me a drink of whiskey in a glass and I'll pay you any price for it.”
I said “I haven't got no whiskey to sell, but I'll see that you get a drink.” I brought in about half a glass
of just straight whiskey. He drank about a half of it. He smelled it, ??? wiped his mouth and then
finished it up.
“Would you order me some whiskey?” and I said, “Sure.” Taking out a roll of bills as big as my arm.
Not as big as bread, but as big as my arm, skimmed off five dollars, said “Order me a gallon. Will that
pay for it?”
I said “sure.” ??? four dollars. The time I paid the four dollars and ??? that wasn't very much left out of
the five dollars.
They just keep it here at this table for me. When he came that evening, I sent a boy down. He come
up with his hands behind his tool box in the livery stable ??? and hung two little cups on some nails
there ??? and during the time when coming up to get his drink he told me that he was one of the
men that robbed [Dave Ferrier (?)]. And he filled his pants pocket with twenty dollar gold pieces. He
filled his coat pocket, he taken out his hat and filled it half full. I thought it was about time to leave,
just at that time they come in through ??? back door, and I went about four or five blocks running
like the dickens a pair of twenty dollar gold pieces ??? out of my hat and hit my boots, but I didn't
have no time to stop and get them. I turned west, went three or four blocks, I ??? Creek. I waded the
river ???. Went off in the brush, knife in my pockets and my hat in that bag I had on my arm. I rolled
it up and packed it on my arm. The next day I told the ??? tied my money up in it through the sleeve
and threw it over my shoulder.
??? I raised my royal horses here in Mexico. I went to South America, I bought it for the plantations
and I've lived down ??? creek ever since. I got a ??? plantation, he ??? and bring it by my home, go into
town with it and sell it. Get my money, pay my men off, put the balance of it in the bank ??? I've got
a ??? horses and a carriage ??? go into town just whenever he wants to. I've got a housekeeper the

first day. If I had two years to live there and four years to live here, I'd move back to South America
and take my two years and die. Now he left his wife and a baby. His wife didn't ??? she soon got a
divorced and married old man [Canesbury (?)] which raised a good big family here in Austin.
Frank Dobie: ???
John Talley: His wife married [Canesbury (?)] and raised a family there in Austin, about five or six
children. That girl that he left, the baby, married a ??? for a while [in Baltimore, Maryland (?)] and she
died. What become of the girl I'm not prepared to say. Might be ??? I know. ??? He married a rich old
rancher's daughter and he became the manager of his daddy ???. The old man died and the old lady
died and that left our ??? in charge of the ranch and he done well.
In the meantime, he had bought three thousand acres that added to his place ??? one time I
remembered a little better than ten thousand cattle ??? in three different herds. ??? five dollars a day.
Well, that ought to get about three thousand. They was there waiting for him. ???
Shape, cut him up, tie him off with your rope when you get a hundred. You get the rope pulled or
you make a ??? of that, hold the cattle up for a minute then tie a lot of knots.
He got three thousand of them. I pulled out ahead of them cattle. The best time I ever had done
kicked myself many times that I didn't go right on with the cattle. Get more than five dollars a
day, riding the same horse. One of the best horses I ever owned in my life. I paid old Joe Rogers,
a hundred thirty-five dollars for him. That was twice the price of a modern day horse at that time
because he was on the high-roll end. A good saddle horse, a good cow horse, well-trained although
a little old and crazy. I used the same horse all the time. Go as far as Mason with them and turn back
and ??? back to ??? to wait a day or two, he's ???. That's eight miles north of Lockhart. And that is the
way it went. I made the three trips on just three horses. ??? on one horse I meant to say ???.

David: You're welcome.
John Talley: ??? the mule's kicked ??? his old hat went way over yonder ??? and got his shotgun, he
[sighed and sighed and sighed and sighed (?)] here he comes down, ??? says “I believe you damn
fools ??? kill that mule [laughter]. ???” . . . kill that mule [loud laughter and unintelligible words]. ??? says
“Son, you've got to clean shirt you know what I mean?” “Sure Daddy, I've got plenty of clean shirts
and ???ones.” He gives him a shirt and at that time shirts was buttoned in the back, back then. The
old man put the shirt on with the button in front and the back on his back. ??? and sold his cotton
and went into the wagon yard and ??? he's taking off his coat you know [laughter] and go on up the
street, people laughing you know, and giggling, and sneering, and cutting up. The old man finally
went home. The boy says, “Daddy, what on earth have you put the shirt on that way for?” “Because
I thought that was right.” “No,” he says, “You button it up in the back and wear the ??? in front.” He
says “I thought that something ??? laughing at me on the street [laughter].
