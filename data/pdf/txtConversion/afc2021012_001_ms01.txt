Interview: Travis Weed

CT: My name is Cynthia Torres and I am an Archie Green Fellowship recipient and we are 
doing interviews for the Custodians and Janitors in Colorado Project.  
 
JF: My name is Jennifer Fluri and I am a Professor in the Department of Geography at the 
University of Colorado Boulder. 
 
TW: Travis Weed, Environmental Services Director, Fraser Meadows Retirement Community, 
Boulder, CO. 
 
CT: We’re going to get started with the questions. Again, Jennifer and I are going to alternate 
between the questions. Do you want to start? 
 
JF: To start off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you came to be at your current 
location? 
 
TW: Yes. Actually, I grew up in the Midwest, Sioux City, Iowa area. I moved to Colorado in 2002 
and actually heard of the position open up here at Fraser for a supervisor--this was in February 
of 2003--through a friend. So I applied for it; wasn’t sure what I was getting into until I came in 
and I was a supervisor and I was in charge of twelve housekeepers in our healthcare center. 
That’s how I kind of came to Colorado and got my first job.  
 
CT: This is a bit redundant, but when did you start your job as a custodial supervisor? How did 
that come about and where have you been a custodial supervisor? 
 
1:52 
TW: Let’s see. In February, 2003, I started at Fraser Meadows. Then I was promoted to director 
a few years later than that, and I stayed at Fraser Meadow until about 2017 and then I left and 
went to CU Boulder for three years and was a custodial supervisor there. And now I’ve come 
back to Fraser Meadows and I’ve been here almost two years again. So, almost 20 total years 
of housekeeping or custodial, environmental management.  
 
JF: How has your job changed over time? 
 
TW: It really hasn’t changed that much. The biggest change is when we add more square 
footage and more residents, so it gets bigger. As far as cleaning, that’s always kind of been 
pretty much the same as far as cleaning products. Things do improve as far as equipment to 
clean. Procedures pretty much stay the same. We do get a state supervisor-- a state visit. They 
come check out our healthcare center to make sure that we are up to code and in compliance 
on how cleanliness of the building. That gets a little tighter each year, especially with COVID, so 
we’ve just got to make sure the correct systems and procedures are in place. 
 
CT: Could you tell me a little bit about when you first started or your first day of work? 
 
Interview: Travis Weed 
2 
TW: First day--that’s a long time ago [laughing]. I really wasn’t sure, I mean, I knew, they kind of 
showed me the building that I had, which would be our healthcare center now, which is actually 
called Summit Care Center. So, I was in charge of 108 resident rooms and about ten to twelve 
employees. I really started with no management or supervisor experience ever, day one. I just 
had to learn how to treat people nice, you know, respect and just the biggest thing that worked 
for me was working with them, rather than just giving them a list and saying okay, here’s what 
we have to do today. That was one of the best things that I ever did, was being a working 
supervisor and then they would kind of teach me and I would teach them, so that really worked 
out well.  
 
4:25 
JF: The next question is how did you learn what to do? It sounds like you kind of learned on the 
job. Could you…? 
 
TW: Yeah, I kind of learned on the job. As far as how to run the equipment, I was trained by 
other managers, custodians, cleaning--cleaning was pretty much probably the easiest thing to 
figure out. I remember starting on cleaning resident rooms, because in order for me to check the 
resident rooms to make sure the housekeepers were doing it correctly, I cleaned the room 
myself to know exactly what they were doing. Which was extremely helpful. They actually had 
seen me do that, so that actually helped a lot, you know, just getting your hands dirty, and what 
not. I did pretty much learn a lot on the fly, though. The hardest thing was probably equipment 
and then just managing people on a day to day basis. So, it really just came with time.  
 
5:35 
 
CT: Describe your work environment here. It’s a retirement community and maybe how does 
that differ from maybe working at a university environment? 
 
TW: Yes, so, the university, obviously a lot of kids. A retirement community, a lot of, you know, a 
little bit slower pace. It’s a little more rewarding on the retirement level side, because these 
residents have worked so hard to retire, and we want to keep the place as nice and as clean as 
possible for them. They’ve earned that, they pay to be here. We take a lot of pride in keeping 
the place clean for them. But we have a lot, we have about 450 residents plus, and 20 acres, 
600,000 square feet. We have a lot of ground to cover. Currently, my staff is about 30 
employees. 
 
JF: And do you clean just common areas or do you…? 
 
TW: No, we also do apartments, we do all the assisted living, healthcare apartments, and 
independent living--we do those upon request. If they want housekeeping, they can just call and 
we can set that up for them. We can come either weekly, biweekly, or once a month. So, we 
actually do all that.  
 
CT: Does your staff change depend on the need? 
Interview: Travis Weed 
3 
 
TW: I put the staff in the areas where their skills are the strongest. As far as apartment cleaning 
for independent living, there’s a lot of communication there. It’s a younger field of residents 
starting at age 65 is when you can actually move in. So I put the housekeepers that have more 
experience with apartment cleaning and communication in the independent living side. Versus 
healthcare and assisted living. We really don’t see the residents that much. We just kind of go in 
and clean.  
 
7:52 
JF: Can you tell us a little bit more about your co-workers, your staff and your relationship with 
them? 
 
TW: Yeah, co-workers and staff, we have a lot of long-tenure employees here. I have two 
supervisors and one lead custodian and then the rest are custodians and housekeepers. 
Nepalese population and Hispanic population. So we’re a pretty tight knit group. There’s not a 
lot of staff turnover, so it definitely helps management easier, because they always know kind of 
what we’re going to do and they know the plan. It really saves us time because we’re not 
retraining just because we have the same staff.  
 
8:48 
CT: It sounds like it’s a fairly diverse group. 
 
TW: It is.  
 
CT: Does that cause any or are there any issues with working with a really diverse staff? 
 
TW: No, you’ve just kind of got to learn, that’s kind of the biggest thing. You just have a few 
good translators, Google Translate, and communicate as much as possible, you know, with 
them. I can speak a little bit of Spanish. Nepalese, not too much, but we have two really strong 
supervisors that handle a lot of the language and communication. So, really, we have a really 
good support system for that.  
 
9:36 
CT: Would you walk me through a typical day at work here at a retirement community before 
and after COVID? 
 
TW: Before COVID, a lot of people in the hallways, a lot of people out and about. It was just kind 
of normal. COVID hit, you could not tell that we had 450 people here. And two to three hundred 
employees. You could just kind of look down the hallways and we were pretty much on 
lockdown. It was no housekeeping in apartments. We only did housekeeping in public areas. 
We had meals delivered to the residents’ front door. Everything was closed. Dining rooms were 
closed. All of our common spaces were closed. So, now since we’re kind of opened back up, it’s 
completely different. You could actually go down the hallway, talk to people, see people, have a, 
you know, a conversation. But the COVID lockdown was very, very hard for a lot of people. Just 
Interview: Travis Weed

being isolated in apartments for…you just could not tell that there was that many people, you 
know, that actually lived here because of COVID. So, it was really incredible.  
 
10:50 
CT: Did you have to address any staff concerns for COVID, or, you know, additional training? 
 
TW: We had to really turn, we had to turn up our high touch cleaning in public spaces. As far as 
that, elevators, door handles, doorknobs, hand railings, you know, things like that. We hung 
quite a few hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the building. There were some challenges with 
supplies, too. A lot of stuff was on backorder and, you know, we couldn’t get it. So, somehow we 
made it through that, just kind of stockpiled equipment, chemicals, and supplies. Very difficult 
and challenging time, but we really did well and got through that. We’re still going through it. 
 
JF: Did you provide masks and other PPE for your employees, then, as part of it? 
 
TW: Yeah, we really didn't have to change a lot on PPE. Currently, it’s still in throughout the 
building and everyone has to wear a mask. But really, during COVID there wasn’t a whole lot of 
adding PPE unless someone, a resident, had COVID. Then, they would just kind of isolate it 
and wait it out, before we would go in there and do any cleaning. So, that really didn’t change a 
whole lot.  
 
12:23 
JF: And what special knowledge or skills are required for your job, and has that changed after 
COVID? 
 
TW: Special knowledge would be mainly with chemicals, state surveys, bloodborne pathogens, 
hazardous communication, COVID, as simple as hand washing. So, really just a lot of 
educating, reeducating, having meetings. Just kind of practicing a safe workplace. Don’t come 
to work sick, as simple as that. Equipment, making sure staff is trained correctly on that. 
Knowing what to order: inventory. After COVID, I think--I really don’t think it’s changed that 
much. It’s pretty much the same, maybe. Of course, we’re more cleaning on high touch areas. I 
think COVID has been difficult, but it’s also showed us that we need to be more careful. It’s 
very, very serious.  
 
A lot of my job knowledge came through experience through many years. Some doing things, 
some wrong, and then doing things the correct way, honestly.  
 
14:03 
CT: As far as you personally, how has working in a retirement community affected you 
personally? Was there a lot of stress or things that you…? 
 
TW: It could be stressful. It’s very rewarding as far as because you get to see--a lot of our 
residents are moving in at 65 and they get to be 70, 80, 90. We have a couple in their hundreds 
right now. So, it’s rewarding to the fact that you just got to see them happy and live here and be  
Interview: Travis Weed

taken care of. It can be stressful but, luckily, I mean, through all the years that I’ve been here 
I’ve been learning how to kind of manage that. It just comes with growth and aging, honestly.  
 
14:51 
CT: Are there any concerns with your family or friends and what is it like working at a retirement 
community during COVID? 
 
TW: Not really. I mean, yeah, we were essential staff. So, there’s a lot of people I know, it’s like 
they just stopped coming to work. For us, that wasn’t an option. We just kept coming. I’ve 
always been extremely confident, and I don’t get sick very often. When we got vaccinated, we 
actually held a clinic right here. Everyone got vaccinated on site. Staff, residents, we were all 
for, shot one, shot two, and then we’re doing a booster shot next week, actually. So, that helped 
with some reassurance in that area. So, I took it seriously, but I never really worried about it.  
 
15:43 
JF: Are vaccines mandated by the organization here? 
 
TW: Not, quite, yeah.  
 
JF: It’s just, but they’re doing everything they can to make it more like that. Just curious. And 
what’s most meaningful to you about your job? 
 
TW: Um, Just, definitely, I would say, it’s staff and residents. Without our special staff, we can’t 
take care of the residents. I always use the example: If all 30 employees took the same day off, 
how would the place look 24 hours later? It’d probably be pretty dirty, right? So, that one is 
always an eye-popping thing. So, yeah, the staff is wonderful and they’re able to see the 
residents happy when they go clean an apartment or the public space, or just keep the place 
nice. It’s definitely for the residents and staff.  
 
JF: Can I just follow up? It sounds like you have a good relationship with the residents here. 
TW: I do. I’ve seen a lot of residents come and go. Some have been here since the first day I 
started. I’ve known some for almost 20 years now. Some were moved in right at 65--that would 
make them right around 85 and they’re still in the same apartment. That’s really, really pretty 
cool. 
 
JF: You must have missed them during COVID. If you couldn’t see them… 
 
TW: Yeah, yeah, It was like COVID was hard. We came to work, but it was really like lockdown. 
But they were all safe. That was the key.  
 
17:31 
CT: Must have been tough, like when visitors got cut back. 
 
Interview: Travis Weed 
6 
TW: Yes, that was most difficult. And we had to do video chats with family. Or we had some 
pods outside--you know, with the plexiglass on them. They would set up a time when to come 
see them. And they would sit on--one would sit on one side and one would sit on the other and 
kind of talk through that. It was something, it was something. That was the hardest time, 
because we couldn’t let a lot of people in.  
 
18:10 
CT: What advice would you give someone starting in your field or moving into your field from a 
custodial position?  
 
TW: Uh, patience and you gotta be willing to do the dirty work. Our work is kind of behind the 
scenes. That’s like no one really comes and sees us do it. We start very early in the morning. As 
far as public areas--but you know, resident apartment cleaning’s different. Housekeepers get a 
lot of praise for that. I would say, just patience and you’ve got to be willing to move around. Be 
on your feet and work hard. So, yeah.  
 
19:03 
CT: That’s wonderful. I have one follow up question. Is there one specific challenge that you’ve 
had that really kind of sticks out, like wow, that was a tough one? And how did you get through 
that? 
 
TW: I would say that the hardest thing was during COVID when we would do COVID testing and 
then we would have employees come back with COVID. Because then we would have to run 
extremely short-staffed. Even tried to find contractors to come in. Some employees would be 
out on a two-week quarantine until they could be green-lighted to come back to work. That was 
probably one of the hardest things because everytime I would see an email come through, I’d 
lose two and two employees in a building that had four employees. So, half the staff was gone. 
And so there was a lot of  just kind of making it work. That was definitely the most difficult thing.  
We have to have the staff to be able to do our job. Special employees are very hard to find, so 
once you find them, you have to hold on to them. 
 
20:19 
 
CT: Very nice.  
 
JF: That’s all I have. 
 
CT: Do you have any other…? 
 
JF: Anything you want to add, or share with us beyond the questions? 
 
TW: I’m good.  
 
CT: Fantastic. Well, thank you so much, Travis, for this.  
Interview: Travis Weed

TW: You’re welcome. 
 
CT: Great. We’ll end the interview.
