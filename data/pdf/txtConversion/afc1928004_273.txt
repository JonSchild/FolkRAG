THE " 
LITTLE ROSEBUD " SONGSTER . 
TO THE READ E R. 
IT 
is but an act of justice for the compiler of this collection of 
very choice songs to acknowledge the sources from which they 
have in the main been culled. A major part of the words have 
been linked to harmony by the genius of Wm. H. 
BROCKWAY, 
while many of the verses originated from the fertile brain and sen-
sitive heart of GEORGE COOPER. We append sketches of each of 
those gentlemen. 
Wm. H. 
BROCKWAY, the composer of many of the most popular 
songs of the day, is a 
resident of the city of New York. 
For many 
years lie has been connected with various minstrel organizations, 
chiefly Bryant's and Kelly and Leon's. 
He is the best interlocutor 
or middle-man in the business, and his versatility is readily ac-
knowledged in every branch of his profession 
One of his earliest 
songs was the " Jockey Hat and Feather." 
Of later years his 
" 
Twilight in the Park," " There is no Harm in Kissing," and 
" 
Little Sweetheart, Come and Kiss Me," have won for him a 
de-
cided reputation a.9 a 
popular composer. 
His latest song, " Little 
Rosebud," is now being sung by everybody, and will, undoubtedly, 
be as popular as any of his other works—indeed, we may say that 
it is so now. 
Mr. Brockway is an accomplished musician—a 
vio-
linist of rare skill, and a 
kind, genial gentleman. 
GEORGE COOPER, the song-poet, whose words the reader has fre-
quently met with, is a 
native of New York city. 
Some of the 
most popular song-words of the day have eminated from his pen. 
Among the number of popular pieces bearing his name we may 
mention " Mother ' Kissed Me in my Dream," " Beautiful Isle of 
the Sea," " God Bless the Little Church around the Corner,"" Twi-
light in the Park," and " There is no Harm in Kissing," the two 
last wedded to the sweet strains of Mr. Brockway. Many of the 
most popular composers of the time have been inspired by the 
words of Mr. Cooper. 
Abt, Thomas, Millard, Foster, Danks, and 
many others have successfully wedded his songs to music. 
He is 
also a 
prolific contributor to the various magazines, and some of 
the best fugitive poems in the country are from his pen.

LITTLE rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 7 
-
for of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray ; 
S:nce from you I 
sweetly parted 
Earth has no delights for me, 
And I 
wander, heavy hearted, 
0-er the land and o'er the sea. 
enorzus. 
Little rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away ? 
For of you I'm thinking only 
As I 
ever sadly stray. 
Little rosebud, I 
am coming 
home to see you once again ; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main ; 
Will you welcome home the ranger 
To the sunshine of your smile? 
Then shall sadness he a 
stranger, 
And life's sweetest joys beguile. 
Little rosebud, etc.

THEY bore him away when day had fled, 
Ancl the storm was rollincr 
Am el they laid him down in his lonely bed, 
Bv the light of an angry sky : 
The lightning IlasIt'd and the wild sea lashed 
The shore with its foaming waves ; 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's (= rave, 
And the thunder pass'd cn the rushing blast, 
As it howrd o'er the rover's grave. 
Ni longer for him, like a 
fearless bird, 
ion bark floats under the lee ; 
No longer his voice on the gale is heard, 
When its guns peal over the sea ; 
But near him the white gull builds on high 
Tier nest by the gleaming wave ; 
And the heavini billows (iron and die 
On the sands of the rover's grave, 
And the heaving billows groan and die 
On the sands of the rover's grave.

'Twas on a 
summer's day, 
I 
met her all by chance, 
Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the " mall," 
We strolled beside the " lake" 
Her pretty har.d so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take 
We talked about the swans, 
And all the other birds. 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music, 
tnen I 
listened to her words 
She leaned upon my arm, 
The sun went down the west, 
tried in vain to whisper 
All the love within my breast.

CHORUS. 
Twilight in the park, 
Twilight in the park, 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark; 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark I 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the park. 
.1* left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said good bye; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh, 
She said she'd come again, 
And nam'd the time and place ; 
Her absence gave m v 
heart such pain, 
For heav'n shone in her fat,e. 
So Wry day I 
watched hi love's delightful trance, 
And sure enough we met again, 
She knew me at a 
glance ; 
"fwas love at first sight, I 
said, 
And as theday grew dark, 
I 
won her lean t 
for evermore, 
At twilight in the park. 
Twilight in the park, &c.

UPON the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his be chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eye4 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 7 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near ! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew-, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said good-bye.

TITERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave, 
its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
lie softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting_ 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST m the wide world, hopeless and weary; 
Gone is the gladness that made life so dear! 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary ; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering near! 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses ; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
CHORUS. 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, wand'ring in sadness, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
" 
Loved ones are waiting, then hush all thy fears !" 
Oh, bow I 
miss them, life's lovely roses! 
Sweet voices call me to yon further shore! 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore I 
Lost ln the wide world, etc.

Come back, Aroon, to the land of my birth, 
Come with the Shamrocks and spring-time, Mavourneen, 
And its Kiilarney shall ring with our mirth.

Little we thought of the hush of the Star Shine 
Over the mountains, the Mull's and the Brays!

Come back to Erin, Mavourneen. Mavourneen, 
And its _Killarney shall ring with our mirth. 
Over the green sea, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Long shone the white sail that bore thee away, 
Riding the white waves, that fair summer mornin', 
Just like a 
May-flower afloat 011 the bay. 
Oh! but my heart sank when clouds came between us, 
Like a 
gray curtain the rain falling- down, 
hid from my sad eyes the path o'er the ocean, 
Far, far away where my Colleen had down. 
Come back to Erin, dx. 
Oh ! may the Angels, 0 wakin' and sleepin', 
Watch o'er my bird in the land tar away ! 
And it's my prayer will consign to their keepin'

When by the tire side, I

Then all my heart flies to England and thee,

Or if her thoughts may be crossin' to me.

I'LL go back to Erin, to Erin, dear B

I'm sighing, my dearest, for one glance at you ; 
I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow that sparkle with dew. 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary, 
I've thought of you, darling, by night and by day; 
And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away.

Ah 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney,

I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
And, Barney, my love, I'll be soon on the way. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you and those bright auburn curls; 
T 
sigh for the scenes of the past in our village, 
The valleys ; the rivers, and rosy-check'd girls. 
The lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet, placid waters are bright as of yore ; 
And often I 
think I 
am walking beside you, 
And talking of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Alt ! I'll go back, etc. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So, darlincr, be ready to welcome me there ; 
I 
look for the day when we'll fix for the wedding, 
The marriage that makes us the happiest pair. 
The lark and the cuckoo will greet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay ; 
And Barney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love, I'll be soon on the way. 
Ah 
I'll go back, etc. 
IOCKEY HAT AND PEA.THEIL. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
'Neath a 
hat and feather; 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
It made my heart pit-pat, 
Then turning round she said to ma, 
"How do you like my hat?" 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I 
said its gay and pretty, too, 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat, 
With a 
rooster's feather. 
She wore a 
handsome broadcloth basqueo 
Cut the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dress, 
Made her look quite dashing; 
Her high-h,eled boots as she walked on 
The pavement went pit-pat, 
fll ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jock-y 
bat. 
Oh I 
I 
said its gay, act 
She kissed her hand and said " Au revoir," 
Then I 
was a 
goner, 
Before I'd time to say " Good-bye,' 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So up in bed I

And right before my face I

Come and whisper sweet and low !

We may never meet again! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old shady lane I 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow ; 
Come and kiss me ere I

Ali, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me,

My heart's best love, thou art mine own. 
Bright star of hope that guides me o'er life's main, 
My fondest dream is thine alone,

Thine eyes are beams of sweet and joyous light, 
Thy gentle smiles their kindly rays bestowing; 
These are like heav'n unto my longing sight.

JUST TOUCH THE HARP GENTLY, MY 
PRETTY LOUISE. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cottage. 
As the curtain rises the symphony of the 
t;g is played very softly.] 
[Enter CHARLES; he looks inquiringly around him, and 
.ichbn he sees the cottage expresses & light.] 
ClIARLES.—'Tis the place at last! 
Oh, what a flood of 
pleasant memories rush upon me at this moment. 
There's 
the little garden where so often we have walked in happier 
days. 
Yonder is the green, shady lane, and the little white 
church on the bill. 
There is her window ; and far away I 
see the soft glimmer of the stream, by which we used to stray 
and dream of the bright future that we deemed was in store 
for us. 
I 
wonder if she has forgotten mo ? 
They say that ab-
sence conquers love, and I 
have been away over the sea for the 
last five years. 
How veil I 
remember the little parlor where 
we used to 
it and chat in the lovely twilight. 
Then those lily 
fingers of hers used to fly over the strings of her harp, as she 
woke the sweet strains that I 
never can forget while life shall 
last. 
There seems to be no one at home. 
Even the birds arc 
quiet. 
What would I 
not give to hear that touch upon the 
harp once more. 
It would tell me that I 
was not forgotten. 
[The symphony of the song is again played. 
ClIARLE',S conies 
furieard and sings.] 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when together we sat 
On the porch ' neath the nest of the dove. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
it brings fond recollections to me; 
You remember the mocking-bird mimicked it once, 
As it perched on the sycamore tree. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise, etc. 
JUST TOUCH THE HARP GEI.TTLY .—{C;)NTINuzD.] 
[After the 1st verse is sung, the strain is taken up by a 
voice 
behind the scenes. 
CHARLES listens attentively.] 
I'll touch the harp gently, your loving Louise, 
And sing the old songs that you love ; 
They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
For each song that she sang, your pretty Louise, 
E'en now she remembers them well, 
For though we've been parted, they've lived in her heart, 
And sweet is the love that they tell! 
[The song is taken up by both voices.] 
HE. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise. 
Oh, touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when together we sat 
On the porch ' neath the nest of the dove. 
SHE. 
She'll touch the harp gently, your pretty Louise, 
She'll touch the harp gently, Louise; 
She'll touch the harp gently, your pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that you love; 
They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
[The refrain is repeated very softly as the curtain falls.]

Blooming down the meadow wide, 
Both our darling little angels 
Now are sleeping side by side; 
There the summer breezes murmur

And the daisies seem in mourning 
Where our darlings used to play.

'Neath the white and purple blossoms 
Blooming down the meadow wide, 
Both our darling little angels 
Now are sleeping side by side. 
When the trees were richly laden 
Early in the crimson fall, 
Little Sophie in her beauty, 
Left us at the angels' call ; 
Soon the carol of the robin 
Welcomed in the springtime fair, 
But it brought us grief and sadness, 
Making vacant Lizzy's chair.

They are sleeping, sleeping still.

TRUE as the stars that are shining, 
Love, will I

Fond as the vine that's entwining, 
Dear as the rose to the dew ! 
Life that would ever be sadness, 
Tranquilly flows when you're near me; 
Thus, in your beauty and gladness, 
Love ever lingers to cheer me. 
Ali ! 
CHORUS. 
True as the stars that are shining, 
Love, will I 
be unto you! 
Answer my fond heart's repining, 
Say that you'll still be as true! 
Day is bereft of its splendor, 
Love, when you're gone from my sight; 
Gazing in eyes that are tender, 
Life is a 
dream of delight! 
Sweet is the breath of the roses, 
Sweeter the joys that you bring, love; 
Sorrow forever reposes 
Cares unavailingly cling, love ! Alt !

Tell me in accents of sweetness ! 
Dear as to spring is the blossom!

But I 
could not call her Mother! 
She is a 
fair young creature, 
With meek and gentle air; 
With blue eyes soft arid loving, 
And silken sunny hair, 
I 
know my father gives her, 
The love he bore another; 
But if she were an angel, 
I 
could not call her Mother! 
To night I 
heard her singing, 
A 
song I 
used to love, 
When its sweet notes were uttered, 
By her who sings above : 
It pained my heart to hear it, 
And my tears I 
could not smothef, 
For every word was hallowed, 
By the dear voice of my Mother. 
My father, in the sunshine 
Of happy days to come, 
May half forget the shadow, 
That darkened our old home, 
His heart no more is lonely ; 
But me, and little brother, 
Must still be orphan children— 
God can give us but one Mother!

MOTHER dear, come bathe my forehead, 
For I'm growing very weak. 
Mother, let one drop of water 
Fall upon my burning cheek; 
Tell my loving little schoolmates 
That I 
never more will play— 
Give them all my toys; but, mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am going to leave you, mother, 
So remember what I 
say; 
Oh, do it, won't you 
please, mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
Santa Claus be gave them to me, 
With a 
lot of other things, 
And I 
think he brought an angel 
With a 
pair of golden wings; 
Mother, I 
will be an angel 
By perhaps another day, 
So you will then, dearest mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
I 
am going, et<3, 
Soon the baby will be larger, 
Then they'll fit his little feet ; 
Oh, he'll look so nice and cunning, 
When he walks along the street. 
Now I'm getting tired, mother; 
Soon I'll say to all good- day 
Please remember what I 
tell you— 
Put my little shoes away. 
I 
am going, etc.

That welcome hour so dear to me, 
When purest thoughts my bosom fill!

The zephyr woos the wand'ring bee, 
The dewdrop seeks the lily's breast, 
So evening brings my heart to thee.

To mingle with the orb of day; 
A

Will lose itself in ocean spray; 
And when the sky with beauty glows, 
And starry eyes look on the sea, 
When weary nature seeks repose, 
Then evening brings my heart to thee. 
To thee! to thee, eta, 
Oh ! I 
could firmer at thy side, 
And dream away my every care; 
Or fancy life a 
silver tide, 
With not a 
wave to ripple there; 
Though fortune frown and coldly spurn, 
And mine a 
chequered path must be, 
Till memiry's lamp shall cease to burn,

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away ; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes ! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old ; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill ; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 7 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older oTown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am (* rowing, etc.

A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
CLIOItUS. 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
"Oh! live, my darling dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
"I know mamma is here !" 
"I wish mamma," etc.

VY 
bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling ;face, when youth was in its 
prime ; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my sorrowed heart was 
free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend to

Whatever I

If ever I

friend, 
You've been a

Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I

Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not

WHO'LL BUY MY VIOLET S ? 
Sung by Miss K ITTY BROOME., 
Words and Music by Saar Beo).1.11./.. 
LADIES, dear ladies, and gentlemen, too, 
For one single moment pray listen—ah, do, 
To a 
wandering florist, with my little few 
Of sweet- scented beauties to sell unto you; 
I'm far, far away from my own native France, 
Where the gayest and fairest exquisitely dance, 
With garlands of flowers of various hues— 
Will you from my basket, will you please to choose ? 
CHORE'S. 
Of my violets, roses, sweet- scented posies, 
All of them sparkling and dripping with dew; 
Violets, roses, sweet- scented posies—. 
Who'll buy my roses all sprinkling with dew 
Deserted, ah, me, not one single sou, 
Then, charming ladies, I 
ask of you 
To look at my roses and lilies so fair, 
Like diamonds they sparkle and shine in your hair; 
I 
have violets and roses, and pansies as well, 
The blue bells of Scotland, the Scottish blue bells, 
The shamrock so green; I 
have also sweet rose— 
Will you from my basket, will you please to choose. 
Of my violets, etc. 
Will you buy, if you please, if you please will you buy ? 
I've come a 
long way, my fortune to try, 
I've come from my France, my once sunny land— 
They make you look handsome, they make you look 
grand; 
I've some for your coats, I've some for your rooms, 
The odor is delicious and all in full bloom ; 
If you will not buy them they will wither and die, 
And leave me to wonder and pitiful cry— 
Of my violets, etc. 
OLD FOLKS. 
Written By J. W OOD. 
Now don't be sorrowful, darling, 
And don't be sorrowful pray, 
Taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more night than day; 
'Tis rainy weather, my darling, 
Time's waves they heavily run, 
But taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more cloud than sun. 
We are old folks, my darling, 
Our heads are growing grey, 
But taking the year all round, my dom., 
You will always find the May ; 
We have had our May, my darling, 
And our roses long ago, 
And the time of the year is coming, my dear. 
For the silent night and snow. 
Time tries us most severely, 
And our children they are gone, 
Ah the ones that loved us dearly 
Have left for their happy home ; 
That I 
and -,-ou may meet, good wife, 
In that home that is above, 
Where all is day, for there's no night, 
But all is Perfect Love. 
OUT IN Tilt COLD. 
By SAII BAGNALX. 
Gazing on noblemen's mansions of splendour, 
Fill'd with perfume and shining with gold, 
A 
thought often strikes me, do great ones remember 
Those that are shivering out in the cold. 
C1101:17S. 
Hungry, dejected, feet unprotected, 
Houseless, homeless—sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, care- worn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
No one to soothe the sad heart of sorrow, 
None to pity—plenty to scold ; 
None will ask if he lives to-morrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
Hungry, &a 
What has he done to be so neglected ? 
Why do you thrust him away from the door ? 
Perhaps he was once most highly respected, 
The answer is simply,—because he is poor. 
hungry, &c, 
What is that dark-looking object, before us ? 
A 
funeral, carried from the workhouse I'm told, 
They're taking a 
poor wretch home to his friends, 
They found him last night out in the cold. 
Hungry, & e. 
Friends of the churchyard, none there will scorn him, 
E'en from the best down to the worst; 
He'll soon be forgotten, no one will mourn him, 
Where he commingles his dust with the dust. 
Hungry, & c. 
Sad scenes of sorrow, each comity, morrow, 
Brings in its dull stealthy pace day by day; 
Heaping fresh troubles on man to his horror, 
Till death seals his doom, aud be passes away. 
Hungry, cte. 
THE RED ROBIN. 
Come into my cabin, fled Robin, 
Thrice welcome, blithe warbler to me, 
Now winter has got its white cap on, 
And again thou comest trembling to me, 
Come, fieely hop into my pantry, 
And partake of my plain humble fare; 
I 
never was blest with a 
dainty, 
But what man and bird might share. 
Three years have gone by, Red Robin, 
Since first thou earnest trembling to me ; 
Alas how things have altered, sweet warbler; 
Since Mary proved false unto me! 
I 
once had my wee bonny lassie, 
But away with another she is gone; 
Her friends used to visit my cabin, 
But alas now I 
sigh all alone. 
Sweet is thy wild notes, Red Robin; 
They bring many a 
tear to my eye; 
It calls to my mind youthful pleasures, 
When Mary sung sweetly to me. 
Though pleasures gives way to sorrow, 
And pleasure gives millions to pain, 
Frail hope c.in ne'er delight a 
fond lover: 
Life's comfort I 
sigh for in vain. 
Then where is thy sweet-heart, Red Robin 
Go fetch her from the house-top or tree, 
I'll bid her to be kind to thee, Robin, 
Though false was my las-ie to rue. 
Thou shall share every crumb on my table, 
And sing the cold winter away; 
I 
would never deceive thee, sweet birdy, 
Let seortah, use me as they may. 
iatou 13.AST LEARNED TO LOVE A_NOTIEER. 
Thon host learned to love another— 
Thou host broken every vow— 
We have parted from each other, 
And•my heart is lonely now. 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile hath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget, 
Oh I 
is it well to sever 
This heart from thine for ever, 
Can I 
forget thee ? never I 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure-
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have seen thy new found treasure, 
And I've gazed upon thy bride. 
Thy looks were stern and altered—. 
Thy words ran cold and high, 
flow my traitor courage faltered, 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
Would I 
ne'er had met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
'Twere folly to regret thee; 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met and and we have parted, 
Yet I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well known voice I 
her 
I 
have marked the timid lustre, 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was nigh. 
Oh, woman's love may grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave bar, 
Life is fled when love deceives bee, 
FareweR, farewell for ever. 
FOUND IT WAS ONLY A DREAD%.) 
While sitting one night by my bright t3reside, 
I 
fell fast asleep in my chair, 
And visions of many strange sights met my view, 
While resting so cosily there ; 
The order of things seemed entirely reversed, 
I 
wondered what'er it could mean, 
But when I 
awoke, all the mystery was cleared, 
When I 
found it wa-s only a 
dream.

CHORUS. 
I 
thought it was rather too good to be true, 
So unlikely a 
fact it did seem; 
But I 
learnt my mistake, for when I 
did wake, 
I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
I 
thought I 
was reading the paper one day, 
And perused it entirely through, 
But no railway accident there could I 
see, 
N.,o account of one came to my view; 
The fact was so startling, I 
read through again, 
But no accident there could I 
see, 
My wonder, however, was suddenly stayed, 
When I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
thought it was, ete. 
Next I 
thought that I 
ordered a 
hack from a 
stand, 
Somewhere most important to go, 
But instead of the hack only crawling along, 
It went at a 
pace, far front slow; 
When I 
stopped, and the hackman but asked his right fare, 
Such an unusual act did it seem, 
I 
paid him, he thanked me, thought I, here's a 
change, 
But I 
found it was only a 
dream. 
I 
thought it was, ke. 
Then next a 
policeman I 
saw on his beat, 
It was cold, and was pouring with rain; 
A 
bar-keeper came out of a 
liquor saloon, 
And asked him if he'd have a 
drain I 
But judge my surprise, when he sternly refused, 
Such an action before I'd ne'er seen, 
It startled me so I 
awoke in a 
fright,. 
And I 
found it had all been a 
dream. 
I 
thought it was, Sue. 
WHAT WILL I DO WITHOUT THEE? 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Whom I 
ever hold so dear, 
I 
will lead a 
life of sorrow, 
That is born of hope and fear. 
I 
have never learned to doubt thee, 
I 
will trust thee, as of yore: 
But I 
know that some have parted, 
And have loved not as before. 
CHORUS. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Whom I 
ever hold so dear ? 
I 
will lead a 
life of sorrow, 
That is born of hope and fear. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
In the holy summer eves, 
Or, when sweet and pensive autumn, 
Paints the sere upon the leaves. 
When the clouds of woe have gathered, 
And my grief's beyond control, 
Tell me :—who will prove as sun light, 
And as music to my soul. 
What will, rke. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Thus I 
ask me, day by day: 
Yet I 
know a 
gloom will gather, 
On my heart when ycu're away, 
But when other scenes and pleasures, 
Bear their tender hearts from me, 
Oh ! recall that pure affection, 
I 
have ever had for thee.

THE robin sang in the linden tree 
By the side of his feather'd mate, 
When Lillian fair, with the golden hair, 
Met me down by the garden gate; 
The robin's song had no charm for me 
When her soft angel voice I 
heard, 
'Twas sweeter far than the birdie's notes, 
There was music in ey'ry word. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Lillian, fair Lillian, love ! 
She was my precious choice ; 
Oh, Lillian, fair Lillian, dove, 
I 
loved thy angel voice. 
The grass was damp with the silv'ry dew, 
And the clover, purple and sweet, 
In the meadow path was trodden down 
By the tramp of her little feet ; 
Its scented bloom had no charm for me, 
For sweet were Lillian's lips, 
And the nectar there was richer far 
Than that which the honey-bee sips. 
Oh, Lillian, etc. 
The robin sings in the linden tree, 
And the clover smells just as sweet 
As it did the day when Lillian fair 
And myself at the gate did meet ; 
'Twas long ago, now her angel voice 
Is minoling with others above, 
My heart it pines for my precious prize, 
Come back, to we, Lillian, love! 
Oh, Lillian, etc.

HAVE you seen Robert, to- day, sir 7 
He left me this morning at nine ; 
I'm sure he's been drinking, to-day, sir, 
lie sipp'd up the last of my wine. 
'Twas some that I 
had for the baby, 
Who's been sick, sir, for nearly a 
year; 
And that's why I'm thinking that may be 
My Robert's in search of his beer. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Robert, to- day, sir 7 
I 
know he is out on a 
spree ; 
Oh! if you sea Robert, to- day, sir, 
Just tell him to come back to me. 
He is just thirty, to-day, sir, 
And he might be wealthy and fine, 
if not for the liking of you, sir, 
To take all his money for wine. 
He was once, sir, a 
noble young fellow, 
And he made just a 
thousand a 
year; 
But now he is seedy and yellow 
By drinking your bitter old beer. 
Have you seen, etc. 
Will you but listen to me, sir, 
And drive my poor Robert away 7 
For he will be spending, to-day, sir, 
The very last cent of his pay. 
Just glance at my clothes and my features, 
You will see how I 
suffer for bread, 
While two starving, helpless wee creatures 
Are crying at home to be fed. 
Have yen seen, etc. 
STARS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT. 
STARS of the summer night! 
Far in yon azure steeps, 
Hide, hide, your pinions light ! 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps ! 
Hide, hide your golden light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps ! 
Sleeps! sleeps! sleeps ! 
She sleeps, my lady, lady sleeps 
Wind of summer night ! 
Where yonder woodbine creeps, 
Fold, fold your pinions light 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps ! 
Fold, fold your pinions light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps! 
Sleeps ! sleeps ! sleeps ! 
She sleeps, my lady, lady sleeps! 
Moon of summer night! 
Far down yon western steeps, 
Sink, sink in silver light ! 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps! 
Sink, sink in silver light,

Sink, sink in silver light, 
She sleeps, my lady, lady sleeps 
Dreams of tlie summer night !

She sleeps, my lady, lady sleeps 
THE WATCHER. 
THE night was dark and fearful, 
The blast swept wailing by; 
A 
watcher, pale and tearful, 
Look'd forth with anxious eye. 
How wistfully she gazeth ! 
No gleam of morn is there; 
Her eyes to heav'n she raiseth 
In agony of prayer. 
CHORUS. 
How wistfully she gazeth! 
No glea o 
of morn is there; 
Her eyes to heav'n she raiseth 
In agony of prayer. 
Within that dwelling lonely, 
Where want and darkness reign, 
Her precious child— her only— 
Lay moaning in his pain; 
And death alone can free him ; 
She feels that it must be— 
" 
But oh ! for morn, to see him 
Smile once again on me !" 
How wistfully, etc. 
A 
hundred lights are glancing 
In yonder mansion fair, 
And merry feet are dancing; 
They heed not mourning there. 
Oh ! young and joyous creatures, 
One lamp from out your store 
Would give that poor boy's features 
To his mother's gaze once more. 
How wistfully, etc. 
The morning sun is shining— 
She heeded not its ray ; 
Beside her dead reclining, 
The pale dead mother lay. 
A 
smile her lips was wreathing, 
A 
smile of hope and love, 
As though she still were breathing, 
" 
There's light for us above." 
How wistfully, etc.

W OULD you kiss me again, little darling, 
And lay your sweet head on my breast,

Were singing their young ones to rest I 
Would you touch your soft lips to my cheek, love,

As when we were courting that evening 
In summer, so long, long ago ?

And rest your pink cheek ' gainst my own ; 
The same as you did ' neath the cypress, 
That evening we sat there alone 7 
Would you twine your white arms ' bout my neck, love, 
Or steal now and then a 
caress; 
And could I 
successfully capture 
A 
ringlet from one little tress 'I 
Would you, etc. 
Would you kiss me again, little darling,

Oh, could I

Be with you the bright summer long !

FAR above the silver stars, 
Just beyond the crystal bars, 
And across the golden strand, 
Lies the happy Eden land ; 
Angel guides with amber hair 
Line the pathway leading there, 
And in groups they stand and wait 
Showing pilgrims to the gate. 
CHORUS. 
Home beyond the crystal bars, 
Far above the silver stars, 
Angel guides with amber hair 
Line the pathway leading there. 
Far above the azure skies 
Pearly hills and mountains rise, 
And aside the shininr, tow'r, 
Wafts the breath of ev'ry flower; 
Angels clad in spotless white 
Hold their rods of brilliant light, 
And the pilgrim from afar 
Find the massive gates ajar. 
Home beyond, etc. 
Far above the burning sun, 
Crystal rills and rivers run, 
And beyond the sparkling streams 
Light of heaven brightly beams; 
In this golden palace fair, 
We shall know each other there; 
And in time there comes a 
day 
We'll be pilgrims on the way. 
Home beyond, etc.

ONE by one they wander from us, 
And we linger mid our tears; 
But their sweet and loving mem'ries 
Blossom through the lonely years. 
Oh, the yearning hearts around us, 
Oh, the footsteps heard no more I 
Ev'ry home has lost a 
darling— 
Some dear loved one gone before. 
CHORUS. 
They are waiting o'er the river, 
Where the strife and pain are o'er! 
Ev'ry home has lost a 
darling— 
Some dear loved one gone before 
Day by day we miss their faces, 
And we wander on alone; 
But we know each fleeting moment 
Brings us nearer to our own. 
Oh, the bliss to meet our loved ones 
Once again on yonder shore! 
Ev'ry home shall find its darling— 
Sweet, sweet darling gone before. 
They are waiting. etc. 
THEY grew in beauty side by side, 
They filled one home with glee ; 
Their graves are severed far and wide, 
By mount, and stream, and sea. 
The same fond mother bent at night 
O'er each fair sleeping brow; 
She had each folded flower in sight; 
Where are those dreamers now I 
One midst the forest of the West, 
By the dark stream is laid; 
The Indian knows his place of rest, 
Far in the cedar shade ; 
The sea, the blue, lone sea bath one; 
He lies where pearls lie deep; 
He was the loved of all, yet none 
O'er his low bed may weep. 
One sleeps where southern vines are dress'd, 
Above the noble slain; 
He wound his colors round his breast, 
On a 
blood-red field of Spain. 
And one—o'er her the myrtle showers 
Its leaves by soft winds fanned ; 
She faded ' midst Italian flowers, 
The last of that fair band. 
And parted thus they rest, who played 
Beneath the same green tree, 
Whose voices mingled as they prayed 
Around one parent knee— 
They that with smiles lit up the hall, 
And cheeed with song the hearth— 
Alas ! for love, if thou art all, 
And natteitt 'beyond. 0

THE staunch " Atlantic " dipp'd and roll'd, 
The winds and breakers raved, 
And imongst that load of human freight 
But one brave boy was saved; 
He fought the billows with a

And stood the swamping deck, 
While hundreds stronger than himself 
Went under with the wreck. 
cllonus. 
The bravest of the brave was he, 
That little commodore, 
And all should welcome heartily 
His presence on our shore. 
A 
tender mother, whom he loved, 
A 
father, too, as well, 
Beside a 
brother firm and true, 
Were victims of the swell ; 
With others they were helpless then, 
And sank beneath the tide, 
Where many dear and cherishrd ones 
Were tossed from side to side. 
The bravest, etc. 
While hardy seamen in despair 
Gave up the ship and life, 
his courage never flinched at all, 
But struggled with the strife; 
He look'd for hope, he lived in faith, 
And by th' Almighty's hand 
lie safely left the mouth of death, 
And reached the look'd-for land. 
The bravest, etc. 
In dear old England far away 
No doubt the home now stands, 
Which he and others of the flock 
had left for other lands; 
But Ashton's folk will never see 
The group together more, 
For none remain but Johnny brave, 
The little commodore.

W HEN the busy day has left us, 
And our darlings are asleep, 
Then we pry into the chamber 
Just to take a 
parting peep; 
On the soft and snowy pillow 
Rests a 
tiny, cunning head. 
And we kiss that priceless treasure— 
Little face above the spread. 
When the busy day has left us, 
And the weary hours have fled, 
There is happiness in kissing 
Little face above the spread. 
Hands that all the day were busy, 
Now are quiet for the night, 
And the weary feet are resting 
'Neath the blanket, out of sight. 
Hush'd the voice that always cheers us, 
Closed are lips of cherry red, 
But we still insist on kissing 
Little face above the spread. 
When the, etc. 
Home has many charms we cherish, 
Or ' twould be no home at all, - 
But the sweetest music in it 
Is to hear the children call ; 
All day long they make us happy, 
And at niciht when in their bed 
There's unbounded pleasure kissing 
Little face above the spread. 
I'm standing by thy grave, mother 
The green turf binds it now; 
A shadow deep and still, mother, 
Is on thy queenly brow! 
As far off wand'rer to his home, 
As pilgrim to his shrine, 
I've turned with willing steps, mother, 
To this dear grave of thine. 
I'm list'ning to the song, mother, 
You used to sing for me, 
When in the quiet eve, mother, 
I 
sat upon thy knee ! 
At that same hour, midst distant scenes, 
Where happy voices ring, 
I've heard that same sweet song, mother, 
But not as thou didst sing! 
I'm list'ning to the prayer, mother, 
The prayer you used to say, 
When, ere you laid me down, mother, 
You knelt with me to pray! 
In other lands—from other lips, 
As pure as thine they say, 
I've heard that same sweet prayer, mother, 
But not as thou didst pray ! 
I'm kneeling on thy grave, mother! 
My pilgrim- task is done ; 
Now let thy spirit rest, mother, 
In blessings on thy son ! 
Oh, memory spare I They were the deeds 
Of wayward boyhood's years ! 
Oh, take—'tis all I 
can, mother 
This offering of tears ! 
THOU WILT NEVER MEET ME MORE. 
Thou art gone, but I 
am keeping 
In my heart thy treasur'd name, 
If I'm smiling, if 
weeping, 
Thou art with me all the same. 
Yes, the link at last is riven, 
All our pleasant dreams are o'er, 
And unless we meet in heaven, 
Thou wilt never see me more. 
Thou art gone, but I 
am keeping 
In my heart thy treasur'd name, 
If I'm smiling, if I'm weeping, 
Thou art with me, 
Thou art with me all the same. 
Once the summer sun alighted, 
On the petals of a 
rose, 
And although her leaves he blighted, 
Still be lingered till life's close. 
Thus the heart can sometimes cherish, 
Thoughts that wear away the soul, 
Giving pleasure while we perish, 
'Neath the strange yet sweet control. 
Thou art gone, but I 
am keeping 
In my heart thy treasur'd name ; 
If I'm smiling, if I'm weeping, 
Thou art with me, 
Thou art with me all the same. 
Thou art gone, yet love bath bound thee, 
Thou mayst struggle to forget, 
In the heartless crowd around thee ; 
All in vain ! thou'rt captive yet. 
! 
forgive the pain I've. given ! 
And thy own deep wrongs of yore, 
For unless we meet in heaven, 
Thou wilt never meet me more. 
Thou art gone, but I 
am keeping 
In my heart thy treasur'd name 
If I'm smiling, if I'm weeping, 
Thou art with me, 
Thou art with me all the same.
