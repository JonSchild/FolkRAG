With an increased participation in the urban way of life, the element of loneliness creeps into the plantation man's moods; and the "Blues" are the natural expressions of the urbanized Negro. The following blues composed by a plantation man reveal secular influences:

I wonder why the bald eager eager eagle
Keeps flying around my door
I wonder why the bald eager eagle
Keeps flying around my door
Everytime he fly round my door
I take the blues and hang my head and cry

I'm going to take the blues some day
And catch that long freight train
And ride my blues away
I wonder why my baby
She won't ever write to me
I guess because she live so far
Take $25.00 to send me a postal card

Bye bye baby
Maybe you'll be back home some day
Then I'll sing my blues away. 36.

Roll me over baby
Like you roll your flour dough
Roll me, roll me baby
Till I come back some more
Roll me baby
Like you roll your wagon wheel
Roll my in the morning
Roll me late at night
I want you to roll me baby
Like you roll your flour dough
Roll me baby
Till you drive my blues away. 37.

I ain't going to raise no more cotton
I declare I ain't going to try to raise no more corn
I ain't going raise no more cotton
I declare I ain't going try to raise no more corn
