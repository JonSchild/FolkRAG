130-W
1) Have you ever heard about that railroad rag?
Um...um...um, that's a joyful drag, ["gag"]
See that engine comin' 'round that curve
Um...um...um, how that engine did swerve,
The engineer was pulling with peculiar strain, 
'Round my heart, boys, I feel a pain,
Everybody on [it] [*the train*] keeps up the drag,
Everybody [playin'] [* on it plays*] the railroad rag. 

[on the train keep up the gag 
on it plays the railroad rag]

CHORUS: 
O...o that railroad rag,
Um-hm, that railroad rag,
It's so entrancing now,
It'll make you fall asleep in Fargo and you'll wake up
in Chicago,
Hear that engine hum,
That train is goin[g] to come,
Here comes that choo! choo! choo! choo, choo!
That railroad rag!
