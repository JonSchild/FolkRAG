Mrs. Esther Bell Beachy
1858 West Summit Street
San Antonio, Texas

Dear Mrs. Beachy:

I have just returned to the city from an extensive field
trip in the Lake States and find your distressing letter on
my desk. The clipping you mention came late into my hands only
shortly before my departure this summer and it and it is now somewhere
among my papers here in the Library. I shall commence an intensive
search and send you a letter on Monday with the clipping
enclosed, or else send an air-mail request to the Kansas
City Star to supply you with another.

I regret very much that this whole instance occurred and
I hope you will be patient for a few more days.

It would be of material assistance if you will send me
the date and the page number of the clipping.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
