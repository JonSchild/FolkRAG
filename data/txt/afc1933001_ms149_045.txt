OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am sorry to have delayed in answering your
letter of September 15, but I wanted to discuss this
matter with our Librarian, Mr. Coney.  I am taking
the liberty of enclosing you a copy of Mr. Coney's
letter to me relative to the matters which you
presented.  This will indicate to you our interest
in this matter by certain possibilities which he
 describes.  I would like, therefore, to have you
continue your correspondence with Mr. Coney relative
to working out the details in this matter.

Thanking you for your interest and your help, and 
with kindest personal regards, I am

Very cordially yours,

Homer P. Rainey
