Philadelphia Office                       Report made August 14, 1942
Rumor Report - Week of August 3, 1942
Axis way of doing things.
We are not going to include the bulk of such rumors, because
of the vagueness of most of them. The following are a number of rumors of this type.
1. My wife works in a restaurant near 17th and Sansom Streets.
The proprietor is a German, and almost every day, he and his wife
meet with three or four other Germans in the back of the restaurant
and converse very excitably in German. These men leave, and, in about
two or three hours, another group comes in and the same thing happens.
They all engage in conversation again. Now my wife don't say much,
but she mentioned that a large amount of money passed between the men
and the restaurant owner during these conferences. The owner has
often, in my wife's presence, lauded Hitler and praised the way he
helped Germany take its' place among the nations of the world again.
He condemns Roosevelt, and sneers at our war effort. I think something
should be done about this guy.
Philadelphia--8/2/42. Middle-aged paint foreman, formerly on a
Government contract in Puerto Rico. Seemed excitable. Intelligence
a little below average.
2. There is a bakery in Dover, Delaware, on Lockerman Street,
known as "Macks". This Mack is a German, or of German extraction.
Not long ago, he lived in Middletown, Pa., where he also ran a bakery.
I often visited him, as a salesman, when he was in Middletown, and he
could just about keep going. In talks I had with him, he lauded Hitler
and the German Government and he was very Anti-New Deal.
For a while, his place in Dover was even less successful
than in Middletown. Suddenly, he enlarges his Dover store; buys an
expensive new car; shows off large sums of money, and appears to be
very wealthy. Now, the point is this, where did he get the money?
His friends and relatives say they have no idea of the source. The
only possible explanation, knowing him as I do, is that he is working
with the Axis agents, and I've heard that there are plenty of them
along the bay.
Philadelphia--8/3/42, Salesman for bakery supply line. Middle-aged--appeared to be very intelligent.
3. There are a lot of Axis agents and sympathizers living in
Haddon Heights, New Jersey. I've got a friend living over there, and 
he tells us it's terrible what these Germans get away with. I
think it's time the F.B.I. cracks down on them.
Philadelphia--8/4/42. Business man. Average intelligence. Well 
known in fraternal organization circles in the city.
