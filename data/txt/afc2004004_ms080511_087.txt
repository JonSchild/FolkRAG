A  (continued)
There are 10 million people living in that
territory, but, ah, they're not as much
considered as they need to be in the feeling
of the mountains.

The other thing is tourism, and the coming
of all kinds of recreational industries.
The mountaineers - Ray as you see says, ah:
this is a thing that bothers us.  We, we don't
have the money to go to those ah parks, and 
ah, the - we, we, we like these people coming
here and buying land for a house, but what we
don't like is their selling the land for
profit to other people.  This is the land we
used to gather our healing herbs on, this is
the land we used to hunt on.  Now we've been
pushed  off it just for money.  Now of course
the mountaineers weren't it just for money,
there were in it for living.
[*17 10.25.00*]

So at the ironic end of it all, it seems
almost as if the mountaineers are being
punished for the, for the ah. . .extremely
ruthless way that they in their turn, ah,
attacked the original inhabitants of the
mountains, the Cherokees.
