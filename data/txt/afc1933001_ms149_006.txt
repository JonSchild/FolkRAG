Dear Mr. Wetherald:

Enclosed you will find the lists which I promised to send you some
time ago. This addition to the records that you have sent the Archive
of American Folk Song will largely complete the collection of folk and
semi-folk recordings from Victor. I presume that a more careful study
of the records during the next two or three years will reveal a few
minor gaps in this collection, but for the moment, will you accept my
very deep appreciation for this valuable contribution to American folk
song?

I have not written you further about the matters we discussed last
a few days ago, because I have been waiting to hear from you in respect
to my father's offer. I have, however, gone through the Bluebird and
Victor records which we have here and am more than delighted with the
material I have at hand. Despite what anyone may say the Golden Leaf
Jubilee Quartette is one of the most remarkable singing organizations
in America. I should like to know what have been the results of your
correspondence with my father.

I am in the process of preparation of a collection of songs which
have come out of the past five or ten years of depression. I have wished
to include four or five numbers in the Bluebird catalog. They are as
follows: Weaver's Life sung by the Dickson Brothers, (Bluebird B7802A);
Project Highway sung by Sonnyboy Williamson, (Bluebird B7302);
Insurance Man Blues sung by Sonnyboy Williamson, (Bluebird B8034);
Down and Out Blues sung by Uncle Dave Makin, (Bluebird B7350B);
Welfare Blues sung by Speckled Red, (Bluebird B8069A); C. C. C. Blues
sung by Washboard Sam and his Washboard Band, (Bluebird B7993B).

Would it be possible for you to obtain for me the addresses of
these singers so that I can ask each one his story of the origin of the
song along with a brief biography?
