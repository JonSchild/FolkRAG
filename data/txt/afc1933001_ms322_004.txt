a work song 
from Memphis County 
Work House sent in 
by one of the prisoners

Oh Della
around that bend 
came the L. and N., 
loaded down with county men, 
county men so big and stout 
They do the county labor 
and never burn out.
Chorus
oh Della oh Dame [*new line*] Come here Della 
and Ease my pain.
Ida Bell, Ida Lou I got a gal name 
Ida too
Chorus
[Oh Della "   "   "   "]
Little Baby Frinklin, Five days old 
Stuck his finger  In a crawfish hole
Crawfish backed up And winked one eye 
Little Baby Frinklin You must Die
