White

Den[n]ison College

This is a rather "social"
small college - Coed. Strong
Fraternity groups, etc., prides
itself on swank. A little bit
on the "upward mobile" side
- parvenues, Sons whose parents
would like to send them to
Princeton but can't quite afford it.
Note in this group the first
concentration of anti-Semitism.
[If [?  ?] ]I think you'd find
85% anti-New Deal sen[a]timent
in this college. Fairly able
faculty but academic standards
tend to reflect the society atmosphere.
