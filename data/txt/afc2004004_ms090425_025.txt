20. 11.

Oh, when I get up yonder,
Gonna choose my seat, sit down,
Gonna look up at my Father,
Tell Him, "Give me a gown."
Oh, let me ride.

O*oh, God knows I got little done,
So He want no dreams,
Wake me up at midnight,
Tell you just what I seen,

In the spirit,
Oh, let me ride,
In the Spirit, 
Oh let me ride,
In the spirit,
Oh let me ride,
Put down the chariot,
And let me ride.

Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride,
Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride,
Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride
Put down the chariot,
And let me ride.

Oh, yeah, when I git to see Him,
Lay my school book by,
Mount the horse of Patience,
Goin right above the sky,

Goin home,
Oh, let me ride,
I'm goin home,
Oh, let me ride,
I'm goin home, 
Oh, let me ride
Put down the chariot and let me ride.

Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride,
Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride,
Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me ride.
