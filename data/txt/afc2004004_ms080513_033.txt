A     You, you know, one of the reas - one of the
reasons that ah the festival was important too
was that this, this ga - this made the
dancing a, a bit more respectable than it
might have been on its own.  Ah, [*[*] the old
Calvinist and Protestant prejudice against
any kind of amusement, anything that wasn't 
the Lord's work or the work of earning a living
ah definitely applied to dancing.  I mean you
could be put out of the church, which meant
being put out of the respectable community
by dancing.  And many people were, and many
people denied themselves all their lives long
the enormous pleasure that they felt as good
Celts ah in the dance.  They, they, their
feet itched every time they heard the fiddle 
start.  They were dying to go, and sometimes
they broke out, broke away and went to the
dance anyway. [*]*]  Ah, so there was much suffering
and much controversy about this.  The preachers
inveighed against it, said you'd go to hell
if you did it, but the folk kept it up
anyway, a lot of them.  They tended to be
people who also said, okay, we won't go to
church either, except to marry and bury, ah,
and ah became ah non denominational Christians
you might say, as a result of their desire to
have a little pleasure in their lives.
