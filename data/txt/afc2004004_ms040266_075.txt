I thought it was a music-hall song until I 
came across a Scotch version in a "Book of
Border Verse." published in 1926. Perhaps they
made a music hall song based on that but
my mother's song went like this, 
My husband came home late one night,
Ah, very late indeed!
He came into the stable, 
A fresh horse he did see;
"Whose horse is this? Whose horse is this?
Not mine I plainly see."
"Oh no, my dear. It is a milking cow
That grandma sent to me."
"Oh I've travelled the wide world over
Ten thousand miles or more, 
But a saddle on a milking cow
I've never see before."
If it is not too much bother I would
like to know if that is a old song or not. 
I try to listen to all the radio programmes
about the old songs and thank you very
much for the pleasure you have given me.
Yours Sincerely
Winifred M. Gate.
