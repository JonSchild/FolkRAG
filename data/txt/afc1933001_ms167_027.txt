Colonel A.L.P. Sands

Fort Sill, Oklahoma

Dear Colonel Sands:

Good friend Colonel Ike Spalding has forwarded
to me the four songs you sent him. I am very
glad to have them, and hope you will keep in
mind my interest in having copies of any songs
which may crop up from time to time. Even the
very familiar spirituals sometimes acquire new
words, or a new verse slipped in to express the
issues of the moment., as you know.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
