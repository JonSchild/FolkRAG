FORWARD, LABOR 
(Tune: Onward, Christian Soldiers)

Onward, mighty Labor, 
Champion of us all, 
Give to us your challenge, 
We will heed your call. 
With you as our leader 
Vanquish we each foe, 
Ever, ever onward
With you we will go. 

Chorus: 

Forward, forward, Labor, 
Our defender true, 
We will pledge allegiance 
Evermore to you. 
Onward with our Union 
We will surely go 
Standing strong together 
Failure we won't know. 
We will stand for Justice 
For mankind always; 
Onward with our Union, 
Loudly sing its praise. 

(Repeat Chorus.)
