Mattie Lee Matthews  2nd Jr II

Once Hitler had a friend and
the friend had a daughter name
Erlean. One day Erlean had a
stomach ache, she told her
mother. Her mother replied;
Oh! It's nothing much it will be
alright as soon as you get
something in it.
Erleans father took her to see
Hitler but he was fussy that
day. He said I have a headache.
Erlean replied very frankly.
Oh! Its nothing much it will
be alright when you get Something
in it.
