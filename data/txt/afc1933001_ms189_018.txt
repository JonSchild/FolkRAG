OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. James Allen, Deputy of the Director                  Date: December 22, 1942

From: Alan Lomax, Information Specialist

Subject:

As I see my work here in the Office of War Information as adviser
on informational problems of special groups, one of the things I most need
is field contacts in the South. There are a number of folklorists, sociologists,
etc. who know a good deal about the South, but in these times there are few
who are in direct contact with the people. For this and other reasons, I have
been planning to apply to the Rosenwald Foundation for a project of six
fellows to work under the joint sponsorship at the Office of War Information 
and the Library of Congress. To the Library they will supply records of folk
lore, and to the Office of War Information they will be able to give invaluable
material about the informational problems of special groups.

Only four of the six fellows will need to have gas and tire
rationing. These are (1) Professor Willis James of Spelman College, Atlanta,
Georgia, who will work in the area of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
His mileage during the year should not exceed 4,000. (2) James Harrison
Pipes, who will be interested in a study of the most important contemporary
Negro folk religion, the holiness church. He will work in the deep south,
Alabama and Mississippi, and his mileage should not exceed 3,000. (3) Prof.
John Vincent, who will work in central and western Kentucky, and his mileage
should not exceed 4,000. (4) Vance Randolph, who will work in the Ozark
region, and his mileage should not exceed 3,000.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would take this matter up 
with the Office of Price Administration in order to see whether they would
write a letter to the local boards where these individual fellows will make
application for their gas and tire rationing exemptions. Since the fellowship
plan must be submitted very shortly to the Rosenwald Foundation, anything
you can do to obtain a quick reply from OPA would be much appreciated.
