4. The Old Grey Mare

Music: First part of "The Old Grey Mare" sung first time very
slowly, repeated very quickly.

Words: The old grey mare, she
Ain't what she used to be
Ain't what she used to be
Ain't what she used to be
The old grey mare, she
Ain't what she used to be
Many long years a-
Go - o - o - o !

Formation: In three's (two women with man in center or vice versa),
arms linked, moving forward zig zag, three abreast,
counter-clockwise, in a large circle.

Action:
Part I. Very slowly move diagonally right forward, starting right
foot, three slow stops and kick to the words "The old
(step) grey (step)mare (step) she (kick)." Repeat, starting
left foot, moving diagonally left forward on second
line, "Ain't (step) what (step) she used to (step) be
(kick)." Repeat all, three more times.

Part II. Release arms, man faces woman on his right and links arms
with her, turning her quickly on first line, links left
arms with woman on left, turning her quickly on second 
line and so on to end of song.

Method of Play: Continue indefinitely playing Part I slower and
slower, Part II faster and faster. If desired, man need
not make the last turn, but instead advances to the two
women in front and repeats with these new partners.
