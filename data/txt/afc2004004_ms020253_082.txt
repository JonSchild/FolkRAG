3rd R. of 10/12/61, P. 26

BJ:   So I went on.  Went Okachobee.  Well, we was gonna tell
his mother about it right then but she was off prayin' with
someone sick -- you know, we does that, ya know, go from house to house to
pray -- she was goin' to a lady's house to pray with her.  An'
so we jus' stopped in the house.  Honey was home.  An' so, ah,
he didn't tell Honey nothin'.  It's a-rainin', so Honey said, "Y'all
better put sumpin' to that car, ov' the winda."  The thing had
broke out, the winda, one of 'em was.
     An' so we went on downtown.  An' so George said, "I'll see ya."
Just went on down to the courthouse an' married, at Okachobee.
     All right.  That was on the 23rd, -- 24th day of March.  An'
so we went on back home.  An' George tol' me, said, "Don't
tell 'em a word.  Don't say nothin' to 'em."  He said, "I'm gonna
let 'em jus' see."  He said, "You, you can 'em that you're married."
He said, "But don't show 'em nothin', nothin'."  He said, "Jus'
let 'em talk."  'Cause we ain't got the license back yet, ya see?
That's the way he's talkin' it that
day, ya see?  Tha's all.
TL:  How do the licenses work there?
BJ:  Well, you see, we married then.  He gave us a duplicate.  You know,
that prove that we did marry then.
TL:  You gotta mail 'em in or something?
BJ:  Oh, well, you see, we stay 'way down on the, on the lake.
An' ah, an' ah, so hit, they had to be sent in.  You know.  I
guess they had to be stamped in the White House or somewhere.  It
ain't like it is now. . .Hit, hit wa'n't.  I didn't send it anywhere.
We just married  then.  The courthouse man fixed 'em up an' mailed
'em to me.  See?  In otherwords it had to be, it would be signed
by that judge, anyhow, see.  At all, see?
