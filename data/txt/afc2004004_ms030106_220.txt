the world.  Immediately the entertainers wanted to get a cut
out of it.  I gave her the money back and told her to hold it.
I wanted to return it back to her which I did in order to
avoid a split with the entertainers and musicians, which everyone
split alike.
     The entertainers were Carolina Boyd Williams, Elmira
Johnson, Rena and Ethel James, a sister team considered the
greatest duo singing act in America at the time, Black Crump,
a dancer, Sarah Greenbird, a high class singer, Josephine
Tobias, a high class singer (of course, you could say sentimental
or opera singers).  The band consisted of the second
type combination in America, now called the Dixieland Company.
Horace George, clarinet; John Armstrong, trumpet; Harry Massengill,
trombone.  These three men were supposed to be the very
tops in Chicago during that period.  Menns, drums; and myself
at the piano.  From time to time we played overtunes in this
organization and it was known to be the hottest band in Chicago.
The name was in my name - Jellyroll Morton and his Imcomparables.
I recorded a lot of rolls, rolls was a big thing at that time.
     Horace George was taken away with Vernon and Irene Castle,
the great ballroom dancers.  I refused to go and James Reece
Europe was hired for the job.  That caused the Castles and 
James Reece Europe to become very famous.  With my tune it was
a very big hit - the Jellyroll Blues.  This caused James Reece
Europe during the war to become the outstanding band in Europe
through playing the Jellyroll Blues.
