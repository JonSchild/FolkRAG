Dear Mr. Lomax

Upon advisement from Mr. Charles Seeger, I am
writing to you for information on the music of Haiti.
If possible, I would like a printed song which shows
French influence or as Mr. Seeger suggested a voodoo
chant with the element of French in it. If not
possible I would like to know about the records that
you have on voodoo music. Also any other material on
the music of South America.

The school is presenting, on April 9th, a Pan-American 
assembly and the faculty directors wished to,
as a contrast to the more common music of South America
have a selection of Haiti or voodoo music.

Since the assembly is to take place on April 9,
I hope to hear from you soon as to the material that
is available on the subject.

Thanking you for your kind consideration I remain

Sincerely yours,
John Thompson
