INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM
OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION
[OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS]

TO:  William H. Webber  DATE: 10/12/42
FROM:  Field Representative for Illinois - HMA  [*H.M.A.*]
SUBJECT:  Rumor Report

Attached hereto are rumors collected from our six persons as 
per your directive of October 1, 1942. I wish to advise that we have very 
rigidly carried out all instructions but are definitely not pleased with 
results. It was my feeling at the time we received this assignment that we 
would not obtain much of a supply of rumors from the six limited sources so 
the results are not a little bit surprising. The six people assigned to this 
work were:

MR. NELSON and MR. BAUMGART OF THE THE CHICAGO ASSOCIATION OF COMMERCE, One 
North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois: Both of these men have been 
associated with the Chicago Association of Commerce for several years. They 
supply advice to business men regarding priorities and on other problems 
arising from the war program, and arrange luncheon meetings and the like. 
Both have university training and are held in high regard by the Association 
Secretary.

DR. ALFRED E. HANSSEN, 55 EAST WASHINGTON, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Dentist, born
in Narvik, Norway; lost one brother and one nephew as a result of the 
German invasion. Former instructor in dental surgery at the College of 
Dentistry at Northwestern University. Enjoys a small but high type clientele.

BEAUTY OPERATOR:  Typical beauty shop operator about 31 and married. She 
works in an above-average shop located in a hotel with predominately Jewish 
residents. Probably has high school education.

SAM GOLDSTEIN, 1159 WEST MADISON, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Druggist in Rexall 
Drugstore on Chicago's short west side. Clientele made up of people in low 
economic strata. Reported  no rumors.

THOMAS CONROY, DES PLAINES STREET POLICE STATION, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Policeman. Reported no rumors.

JOSEPH REGAN, PRESS STEEL CAR COMPANY, 113th and BRANDON STREETS, CHICAGO, 
ILLINOIS: Director of Personnel and in charge of plant protection at Press 
Steel Car Company which is located on the extreme south side of Chicago which 
is the industrial district. Mr. Regan directly handled this matter with an 
official of the plant union. He made an effort to find prevailing rumors 
within the plant and advised there were none during the past week. He advises 
that the morale within the plant is on a very high plane.

It is my opinion that this is an ineffective and cumbersome type 
of assignment. In the main, the reaction received from those who helped us 
was that it was uninteresting, burdensome, and ineffective. I sincerely urge
