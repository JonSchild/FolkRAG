in his first shipment had 
be wired for, Even now we 
are short 15 celluloid discs
for recording. All these 
are my problems - not 
yours, but as the purchaser
of the machine you 
ought to know. In fact I do 
not think you ought to 
pay for this machine - at 
least not entirely - until it 
is put in fair working condition. 
In view of the enclosed 
letter I am insisting that 
Mr. Ganwick meet us at 
Memphis and do some recording 
for us. Yours sincerely 
John A. Lomax
