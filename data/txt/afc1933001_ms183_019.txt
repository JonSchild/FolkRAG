Mr. Sam Bayard
Harvard University
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Sam:

I am beginning to make recommendations
for the Archive's work during the next
fiscal year.  I am wondering whether you
are still too engrossed in your work at
Harvard that you might not be interested
in using one of our machines this summer.

Pennsylvania still represents one of
the important gaps in our collections,
and I hope some work can be done for us
there before long.  If you are too busy,
is there anyone you could recommend who
knows the ground there and could do
competent work for us?  I would be very glad
to have your suggestions in making future
plans.

When are you and I going to get
together?

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
