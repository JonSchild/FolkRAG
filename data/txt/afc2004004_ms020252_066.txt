What do you want your Lord to say?  (2)
Just say, "Welcome, thou
Good and faithful servant,
Enter in the joy of the Lord."

Yes, that's what I want my Lord to say.  (2)
Just say, "Welcome, thou
Good and faithful servant,
Enter in the joy of the Lord."

Yes, I'm praying 'cause I want my Lord to say, etc.

Lord, I'm shouting 'cause I want my Lord to say, etc.

Tell me, what do you want your Lord to say?, etc.
