I still bemoan the fact that your visit to our conference came during the
first two weeks of our second half when I was tied down so much of the time
interviewing students, and straightening out student programs, that I was
unable to attend your lectures. I realized what I was missing at the time
and have realized it even more acutely as I got acquainted with the members
of the conference in the later weeks of the function and heard their comments
regarding the excellence and interest of the contribution that you made.
The conference was a most profitable event, and I hope that we may have
another with you again one of the headliners.

Sincerely,
Burns.
