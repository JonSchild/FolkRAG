was out there.  We danced an' we had a lot of fun, myse'f, ya know,
our part of it.
     But, anyhow, before, ah, when we gettin' ready to go, the girl
that works into the, ah, the waitr-- ah, you know, in that place
there...She told me not to go.  'Cause she had heard 'em talkin' that,
that they was gonna lay for us an' rob, ya see.  Fixin' to rob
them, I reckon, 'cause I'd      with them an' give their money
back.  Then, I'm outa luck.  "Cause sometime they don't git their

      An' so, I wanted to lea' 'em alone.  I begin to wanna wade
