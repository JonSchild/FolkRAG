cook some biscuits, after that morning.  I was cookin' 'em for
her.  An' ah -- they like hot biscuits in the mornin' -- an' ah,
I was, I -- She tol' me to cook [for her] some.  She said, "Bessie,
cook some biscuits."  She said, "That ol' thing done got up," you know
like that, ya know.  She was [married to] mad with him already, ya know.
         Wa'n' none of my business about "ol' thing," that was
they business.  An' so I went right on, right then an' made
up the biscuits an' put 'em in the warmer.  They had them oldtime

was usin'.  An' I put it up in the warmer to rise, so when he
to the table, I knew [(I'm due?)] to put 'em in, ya know, an'
they get hot, they be -- you know -- hot an' fluffy.
