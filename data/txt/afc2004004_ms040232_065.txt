in the publications of any other folklorists.  You would realise,
of course, that other folklorists would nevertheless be entitled
to publish music of the items on your list provided they obtained 
the material by their own recordings or from other sources.

Of course, the material will be available to
Callum MacLean at any time as one of those who is working officially
within the School of Scottish Studies of Edinburgh University.

There are one or two difficult points arising
out of your request for the Lewis Song, with which I deal in a

Once more thanking you for your kind action in
making all your material available for our records, and for the
trouble you took to have it ready for us at a time when it was at
considerable inconvenience to yourself.

Yours sincerely,
S.T.M.Newman
