him and they killed him. 

[*Lynching*]
In Biloxi I came in view of a lynching.  I was 
sick in bed.  He was lynched for attacking a white 
girl (Henry Lyder). A lot of those cases is lies 
and plenty of them is truth.  In this case, the 
people of Biloxi felt it was facts. This fellow 
was Henry Lyder. It seems as though most of the 
people in Biloxi,  white and black, were satisfied. 
They seemed to think he really had attacked the 
girl.

[*1908*] 
I was playing in sporting houses in New Orleans. 
Phillip Moore, a piano player; Rachael, piano 
player; there were four of us, don't remember the 
rest.  We were sitting back of the Fire Department 
on Basin Street.  I was sitting on the back end and 
there was an old man told us to move.  He told us a 
couple of times to move.  One word brought on another.  
He said he would get the Fire Chief.  These guys said 
they were going to beat up the chief or captain.  
Instead [they] he brought back a policeman and we beat 
up the policeman, thinking it was the captain.  I was 
put into jail.  He hit me with a billy -- had a bump 
on my head.  I told the boys to get my landlady to 
bail me out.  You never had to stay in jail if you had 
money.

I was personally around in many places where raids 
were taking place, but they never put me in jail. 
These honky-tonks were raided because the guys didn't 
do nothing, just steal, sometimes hit you on the head. 
They didn't take everybody.  Sometimes policemen told 
me to get out of there.  Same thing happened to me in 
New York in 1935. 

Trucked cotton in New Orleans levee camp.  The fellows 
who trucked is called longshoremen.  Fellows who put 
bales in place were screw men.  These were permanent 
people.   Made tremendous salaries.  Around $18 a 
day, and that is way back. 

Another class on the levee are on river boats.  Handled 
all kinds of things.  They were called roustabouts. 
Weren't treated like other fellows.  Had a captain over 
them with a whip or lash in their hands.  I have never 
seen them whipped but I have often hear[t]d they whipped 
them to keep them going.  They would carry on their 
backs all kinds of things, big boxes of lard.  Carried 
this stuff up the gang-planks.  Looked like a man 
couldn't carry so much. Singing and moving to rhythm 
of songs as much as they could.  People who works on
