things:

1. [Indite?] a petition to the proper Alotment
Board in Dallas, [signed] endorsed by
Spivacke, Evans and, if possible, by
MacLeish in their Library and
Defense capacities asking that I be allowed
to [by] buy (with my money) a full
set of tires and inner tubes. Mine have
run 22000 miles. Dr. Evans said
he would gladly help push on this
request.

2. Approve officially a trip via Austin
to get Frank Goodyear's fiddler, via
San Antonio for the last niggers, and on
to Alpine; next to the [Taylorsville?]
Cattleman, then to New Mexico and
Peter Hurd, on to Lampe, Texas, then
to Henryetta, Ok. for the Dakota [?]
and on back to Dallas. The trip will
be probably 1500 miles and will require
slightly more than the $300 total you
have assigned me [though]

It's bitter cold again. I'm recording
some square dance [records] calling this
Friday night. As always, Father
