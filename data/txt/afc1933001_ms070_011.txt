On the distant prairie, where the heather wild
In its quiet beauty lived and smiled,
Stands a little cottage, and a creeping vine
Loves around its porch to twine;
In that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child,
With her blue eyes beaming soft and mild,
And the waving ringlets of her flaxen hair,
Floating in the summer air.

Chorus

Fair as a lily, joyous and free,
Light of that prairie was she.
Every one who knew her,
Felt the gentle power
of Rosalie the prairie flower.

On that distant prairie, when the days were long,
Tripping like a fairy, sweet her song,
With the sunny blossoms and the birds at play,
Beautiful and bright as they;
When the twilight shadows gather in the west,
And the voice of nature sunk to rest,
Like a cherub knweling seemed the lovely child,
With her gentle eyes so mild.

But the summer faded, and a chilly blast,
O'er that happy cottage swept at last,
When the autumn song-birds woke the dewy morn,
Little prairie flower was gone!
For the angels whispered softly in her ear,
"Child thy Father calls thee; stay not here".
And they gently bore her, robed in spotless white,
To their blissful home of light.
