I herar that Père Codada is back from France and Père 
Toussaint has been sent to Fort Liberté. I got to know 
the people in Plaisance and the countryside near Plaisance 
very well, and I think that I have obtained considerable 
insight into their manner of living and their inter-personal 
and inter-group relations. 
If you plan to [be] come[ing] through Philadelphia any time, 
please let us know. With best regards to you and Mrs. 
Lomax, I am--
Sincerely yours,
