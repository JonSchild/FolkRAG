divorce.  I hope it's not so bad for
both of them.

    I couldn't face any more lonlines
Marylee's little black gloved hand
waving out the window of the train
carriage.  I went to the museum
& I worked till night.  Next two
days I worked in the days but
towards evening work was no good
anymore then out into the streets.
I [did] decided that my life was
quite okay but simply lacked
people - friends - I'd make them
no matter where, how, just wdn't 
lead any longer this miserable
solitary existence.
