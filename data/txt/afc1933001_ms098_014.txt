Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

    Here is a letter which I think you will want to answer,
one way or another. It is high time I acknowledged your
several letters, including the fine one about the review in the
Saturday Review of Literature. I am interested in what you
say of Margaret Larkin's Cowboy Songs. I had wanted to use
more from your own volume, but my publishers preferred that
I represent as many collections as possible. Thank you for
referring Captain Nye's letter to me. I have also heard from
him directly.

    I had wanted to send you a copy of the New England Quarterly
containing Mrs. Eckstorm's review of Our Singing Country, but
the Library will not lend periodicals. Nor can copyrighted
material be photostated without written authorization from the
copyright-owner.

    Several people have asked me concerning the status of your
Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, and I have said that the manuscript
is with the publisher. Is that right?

    With best wishes to you and Miss Terrill,
    Faithfully,

    B. A. Botkin
