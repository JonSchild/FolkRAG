Didn't he ramble?  
He rambled, 
Rambled all around, 
In and out the town.

Didn't he ramble, 
Ramble,
Ramble 'till the butchers cut him down.

(The band would start playing ... very hot [last?] piano break [track?]  ---- 
Didn't he ramble, 
Ramble.
Ramble all around,
In and out the town

O didn't he ramble, 
Ramble,
'till the butchers cut him down.

That would be the last of the dead man.  He's gone, and everybody
came back home and they believed truly to stick right
close to the Bible.  That means rejoice at the death and cry
at the birth.  New Orleans stick close to the Scripture.

Question:  What would happen on the way home with those
baseball bats?

Morton:  Well, on the way home, everything was sad when they
would be playing the dead march.  There would be no fights, no
trouble.  But on the way back they had boundary lines.  The
boys had knives, baseball bats, pick axe, shovel handles,
ax handles, everything in the form that they was supposed to
try and win a battle.  When they got to a dividing line, which
was not supposed to be their district, they better not cross.
If they do, [they better not cross or] they would be beaten up.
Sometimes they were beaten up so bad that they had to go to
the hospital.  That's the way it always ended in New Orleans.
Now the boys -- from then on -- the band would always figure on a
big night, because they had some money.  It wasn't very much
