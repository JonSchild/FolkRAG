Mr. John A. Lomax
Mr. Alan Lomax

I address you jointly in the hope of getting an immediate
reply to this letter.

I attach a copy of a letter from Arthur E. Garmaize,
attorney at law, in which Mr. Garmaize makes reference to your use
on page 361 of AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS of "Alla En El
Rancho Grande", and in which Mr. Garmaize insists that you are
damaging his clinet by maintaining that this song is in the public
domain.

I, of course, have no knowledge as to why Mr. Garmaize
makes these assertions. Has he been corresponding with you? If
so, what about? Please forward copies of Mr. Garmaize's letters
to you and your replies as soon as possible to this office.

If Mr. Garmaize has not been corresponding with you,
will you kindly explain why and under what circumstances you are
maintaining that "Alla En El Rancho Grande" is in the public domain.

Although Mr. Garmaize's letter to the Company dated
April 7, copy of which is attached, is not conclusive proof that
the song in question is the copyright property of his client,
nevertheless I think for the moment we may presume that he is
correct unless you have conclusive evidence to the contrary.

You will appreciate, both of you, that if you cannot
prove to the contrary, it is very foolish to insist that the song
is in the public domain for certainly such assertions on your part
place you in the position of being accused of hurting the alleged
property of another.

If you can categorically deny Mr. Garmaize's assertions,
please write me a letter to this effect at once, adding a paragraph
to the effect that you have no intention of making any such
asserion as Mr. Garmaize states you are making.
