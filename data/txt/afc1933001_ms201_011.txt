Gentlemen:

I am very interested in obtaining a mailing addres 
for Mr. Alan Lomax, son of John Avery Lomax.  The elder
Mr. Lomax, I have been told, was once Congressional Librarian,
 and both he and his son have written books on the subject of
American ballads and folksongs.

If such information is available from your records, 
will you kindly use the enclosed envelope for answering.

Very truly yours,
