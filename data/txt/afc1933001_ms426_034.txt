Bring Back the Smile to the Farmer's Face.
Tune: Bring Back My Bonnie to Me.
A shark worth a whole lot of money,
Met a farmer a struggling to win,
He loaned him his coin, ain't it funny?
A sad story now to begin.

Chorus
Bring back, bring back, bring back the smile to the Farmer's face.
Bring back, bring back our farming to its rightful place.

The man had a good grade of cattle,
They made him some good money too,
He bought registered stuff for the battle,
More money he borrowed--did you?

This farmer, he always expected,
A good crop would sure come this fall,
He'd keep his good credit respected,
The thing didn't happen at all.

His neighbors of course drove a good car,
And why should he drive the old Ford?
He'd fixed the old top up with coal tar,
He felt it had paid for its board.

Soon music you'd hear from the twilight,
The radio never was still,
The furnace kept going 'til midnight,
Expense kept climbing at will.

And now he can't pay off the mortgage,
His taxes and interest past due,
He's going to lose all from shortage,
And who so you blame, tell me who?

The farmer has rights to enjoyment,
He'd pay if they'd give him a price,
Of fruits of his worthy employment,
They steal always too big a slice.

Give the farmer a cost of production,
He'll pay and feed all of the race,
Prosperity come to our nation,
A smile upon everyone's face.
