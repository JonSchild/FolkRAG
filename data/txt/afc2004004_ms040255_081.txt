Hebridean - My heart's darling. 
I love my love, why should I not? 
My minds delight my own hearts darling 

Now that he's gone 
I'll wear his ring 
I'll wait a year 
And even more 

Until he comes 
To me again 
I shall not go 
With any man 

I love my love - why should I not? 
My minds delight my own hearts darling 
I love my love ---------.
