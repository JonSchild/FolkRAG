A MARCHING SONG 
Algernon Charles Swinburne
From "Songs Before Sunrise"

We mix from many lands
We march for very far;
In hearts and lips and hands
Our staffs and weapons are;
The light we walk in darkens sun
and moon and star
                                                                            
It doth not flame and wane              
With years and spheres that roll
Storm cannot shake nor stain
The strength that makes it whole
The fire that moulds and moves it
of the soverign soul.

We are they that have to cope
with time till time retire;
We live on hopeless hope,
We feed on tears and fire;
Time, foot by foot, gives back before 
our sheer desire

From the edge of harsh derision,
From discord and defeat,
From doubt and lame division,
We pluck the fruit and eat;
And the mouth finds it bitter, and
the spirit sweet.

[We strive at time with wrestling]
We strive with time at wrestling
Till time be on our side
And hope, our plumeless nestling
A full-fledged eaglet ride
Down the loud length of storm its
windward wings divide.

We are girt with our belief,
Clothed with our will and crowned;
Hope fear, delight, and grief,
Before our will give ground;
Their calls are in our ears as shadows
of dead sound.

O nati ns undivided
O single people and free,
We dreamers, we derided,
We mad blind men that see  
We bear you witness ere ye come 
that ye shall be.
                                                                            
O sorrowing hearts of slaves                         
We heard you beat from far.
We bring the light that saves,
We bring the morning star
Freedom's good things we bring you,
whence all good things are.

The strife of things and beauty
The fire and light adored,
Truth, and life-ligtening duty
L ove without crown or sword,
That by his might and godhead
Makes man god and lord.

These have we, these are ours,
That no priests give nor kings;
The honey of all these  flowers
The heart of all these springs;
Ours, for where freedom lives not,
there live no good things.

Rise, ere the dawn be risen;
Come, and be all souls fed
From field and street and prison
Come, for the feast is spread;
Live, for truth is living; [a]wake
for night is dead.
