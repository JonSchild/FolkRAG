Dear Mr. Lomax:

    Please forgive this last-minute reminder of our Corn Huskin'
Bee at the Texas State College for Women on Tuesday evening
October 28th at 7:30 P.M. You will recall our discussing this
event sponsored by the Department of Health and Physical Educa-
tion in conjunction with our Folk Festival here on the campus.
If the weather permits, we shall hold the Corn Huskin' Bee out-of-
doors on our concrete slab. In case of inclemency of weather, we
shall celebrate indoors in the Gymnasium on Bell Avenue. I saw
Dr. Hubbard briefly at a luncheon yesterday and he suggested that
I urge you to follow up your original intention of visiting us on
this occasion. Dr. Bedichek and an associate from the University
plan to come to Denton for this celebration. If they are driving
and if you are in Austin, perhaps you can arrange to drive up
with them. At all events, I do hope that you will find it possi-
ble to see one of our own indigenous festivals on the campus.

    I am enclosing some mimeographed material which we have
used from the Department in soliciting entries for our various
contests and in announcing the Corn Huskin' Bee as a whole.
You will be interested to note that we followed your suggestion
and added this year a "Husband Calling Contest." In this--the
largest residential college for women in the world--that event
should be particularly popular.

    We are all looking forward to the meeting of the Texas Folk
Lore Society at Texas State College for Women next spring. In
the meantime, we hope that you will join us on Tuesday, October
28th.

    Most cordially,
    Anne Schley Duggan
