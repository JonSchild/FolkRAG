Cross Road Blues, Robert 
Robert Johnson, Perfect 7-05-81 (SA 2629)

I went to the cross road, fell down on my knees,
I went to the cross road, fell down on my knees,
Ast the Lord above, "Have mercy, now, save po' Bob if you please."

East at the cross roads, tried to flag a ride,
Ee......., I tried to flag a ride,
Didn' nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody passed me by.

Standin' at the cross roads, baby, risin' sun going' down,
Standin' at the crossroads, baby, risin' sun goin' down,
I b'elieve to my soul now, po' Bob was sinkin' down.

You can run, you run, tell my frien', Willow Brown,
That I got the cross roads blues, Lawd, this morning', babe,
I'm sinkin' down.

I went to the cross roads, mama, I looked East and West,
I went to the cross roads, baby, I looked East and West,
I didn' have no sweet woman, oo, well babe, in my distress.
