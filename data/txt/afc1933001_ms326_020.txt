All records listed in this catalogue are in NEW,UNUSED CONDITION. They're all subject to prior sale, so include some substitutes with your order. Mini-mum shipment: $1.00. Orders mailed anywhere in the U.S. C.O.D. On domestic shipments of $7.50 or over I will accept cash or money orders thus eliminating COD charges. Foreign orders, if any, require cash international money order, or certified bank draft sufficient to cover cost of records plus postage. Prices subject to change without notice. 
Again I am staggering the mailing out of this issue according to your distance from New York. This gives customers all over the country a fairly even break in the first few days rush of orders. 
Keep me posted on changes in address, record wants, names of hot jazz-and blues fans who might like to see a catalogue. I'm planning to stay in business for some time yet, brining out new catalogues from time to time when I make new acquisitions. So don't give up hope.
And I can still supply regular factory fresh ten inch green cardboard stock envelopes at 2 ¢ each in quantities under 100 and at 11/2¢ each over. Best way of filling and preserving an important collection, in small quantities they will serve as record-packing at no extra cost for postage. You will have to pay postage on orders of records alone.
