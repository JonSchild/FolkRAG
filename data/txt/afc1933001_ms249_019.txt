Before I went over to him I
had made up my mind, since
he was a stranger in Dallas, to
meet him after the performance,
and welcome him to the Southwest.
At the close of his program wild
horses could not have pulled
me into the wings.

He has hired some good voices
among his group. In rare moments
their harmony and the blending
of their voices was exquisite.
In the total effort of the program,
however, there was a overplus
of Zeiga and very little folk
stuff. Zeiga knew better how to
express the emotions of the folk
than the folk themselves!!! Except
in rare moments, where the singers
seemed carried out of themselves
