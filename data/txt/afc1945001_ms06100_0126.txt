"Well, I'm glad Washington finally listened to Kaiser. He's one 
guy who knows what he's doing. He'll have those big cargo planes rolling 
out of there in less than ten months, too, don't worry about that. That's 
the end of the railroads, though. After the war, Hill Field (Ogden) and
the Salt Lake Air Base will be air freight depots and the railroads will be 
just a memory. The handwriting is on the wall." [*Salt Lake City 8-6  21*]
