5) Then Willie's taen his pistol out and set it to the minister's
                                                                                         breast,
"O Marry me, marry me, minister, or else I'll be your priest."
6) "Haud awa' frae me, Willie, haud awa' frae me.
I darena avow to marry you except she's willing as ye."
7) They've taken Eppie Morrie then, sin better could be,
And they have rid ower Carron side as fast as horse could flee.
8) The mass was sung and bells were rung and they're awa' to bed,
And Willie and Eppie Morrie in ane bed they were laid.
9) He's ta'en the sark frae off his back and kicked awa' his shoon,
And thrown awa' the chamber key, and naked he lay doon.
10) Haud awa' frae me, Willy, haud awa' frae me,
Before I lose my maidenhead I'll fecht wi' you till day."
11) He's kissed her on the lily breast and held her shouthers twa,
But aye she grat and aye she spat and turned to the wall.
12) Haud awa' frae me, Willy, haud awa' frae me,
Before I lose my maidenhead I'll try my stength wi' thee.
13) All through the night they wrestled there until the light of day
And Willie grat and Willie spat, but he could stretch her spey.
14) Then early in the morning before the light o' day,
In came the maid o' Scallater and these words she did say.
15) "Get up, get up, young woman, and drink the wine wi' me,
You might hae called me maiden for I am sure I'm hale as thee."
16) Weary fa' you, Willie, that you couldna prove a man,
You might hae ta'en her maidenhead, she would hae had your hand.
17) Haud awa' frae me, lady, haud awa' frae me,
There's nae a man in all Strathdon shall wedded be with me.
18) Then in come young Breadalbane with a pistol on each side,
Come awa' Eppie Morrie and I'll make you my bride.
19) "Gae get to me a horse, Willie, and get it like a man,
And send me back to the mither a maiden as I cam'.
20) The sun shines on yon wrestlin hills by the lamplight o' the moon
Go saddle your horse, John Forsyth, and whistle and I'll come
soon."
