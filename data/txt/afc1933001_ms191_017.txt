Dear Alan:
   I am answering the letters you sent on, but 
you will probably have to acknowledge the enclosed
yourself.
   The book is coming along and scheduled for
publication early in 1944. I hope it comes up to
your expectations. I missed the last two programs 
but shall be looking forward to the Pittsburg broadcast.
   We had a nice session with Pappy and recorded 
25 songs. We were planning to go up to the labor camp
at Cool Spring Center, Delaware, to record the group
but were too late for this season and hope to get them
next spring. As soon as I get Pappy's new address in 
Florida, I shall send it on as he is anxious to hear
from you.

Faithfully yours,
