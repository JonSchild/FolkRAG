Mr Alan Lomax
Music Division
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Alan:
     I find that I have committed Mrs Jakobson in the enclosed
letter to consultation with Herzog about her proposed program.
That's all right, isn't it? Probably you can block out the
the general outline with Mrs Jakobson while she is in Washington
and incorporate later any of Herzog's ideas that you and she
think should be included. The final responsibility, however,
should I think be left with the Library of Congress; and I think
you have a good argument for this job as one useful in the war.
There is probably no minority in this country more closely identified 
with our industry or more politically popular since Munich 
than the Czechs.

Sincerely yours,
Donald Goodchild
