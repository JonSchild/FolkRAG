(1) How to set up the clinic
            A.   The OWI should arrange with OCD for immediate establishment of Regional 
advisory committees, whose duties will be to coordinate programs within the
nine civilian defense areas. Within each area, there should be state and metropolitan 
area committee established to arrange for the prosecution of the programs of
rumor collection, analysis, interpretation and counteraction. These committees
should contain individuals who might contribute the administrative abilities needed,
assure community recognition and acceptance of the program, key people who can secure 
cooperation of organizations from which "rumor spotters" might be recruited,
and specialists in such fields as education and psychiatry and psychology and
sociology.
            B.   All groups who have already started rumor clinics should be brought
under the supervision of the appropriate OCD committee (state or metropolitan area).
All those who have expressed interest should be integrated into the overall program.
Where facilities have not as yet developed, the OCD committee should organize them.
            C.   Publicity concerning the committee should be widespread so that anyone
who wishes to report rumors will know whom to refer them to -- BUT, rumor spotters
should not be chosen simply on a volunteer basis. Rumor spotters should be recommended for the work by some key person, e.g. their union representative on the advisory 
committee, the chairman of a society which is cooperating, their instructor
at the university. They should be considered for such characteristics as intelligence 
and discretion and dependability, and for such special qualifications as
opportunities for contact with people under conditions in which rumors may be passed.
Examples of people from whom spotters might well be chosen are: barbers, hotel
workers, rest-room attendents, dentists, beauty parlor operators, bartenders, drug
store clerks, waiters, (rural) county agents. These groups should not be approached
