     Questioner: Play it like he played it.
     Morton: All right, it went like this. This is one
of the tunes--that sounds like a drum--this is one of
the tunes that Louie Russell played. Louie Russell was a
Panamanian. He got his learning in New Orleans. He came
to New Orleans--I'm not quite sure, but I'll say around
1916. Of course these was all New Orleans riffs, what we 
is making today. That is the way we used to make them there.
The name of this number is "Call of the Freaks."
     Louie came to New York some years ago after playing
in King Oliver's band and from the Plantation in Chicago.
(Oh, that whiskey is lovely.) They invaded New York with
a terrible band in spite of the fact that they had some of
the very best musicians in the world in the jazz music.
     Louie Russell isn't considered a jazz piano player
because he cannot play jazz. I'm playing this in the
typical jazz tempoâ€”but he is a very good musician and he
can knock the bird's eyes down. He invaded New York with
this thing and happened to get a job after King Oliver
had failed with these great musicians and had to leave town.
He even stole a few of my men when he left from Chicago. He
didn't know that it was better to have some fellows that
could play together than have a bunch of stars that couldn't,
so he failed in his trip to New York at the Savoy Ballroom.
