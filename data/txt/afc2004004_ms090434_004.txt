WRITINGS OF MATTIE DEAR
        O come let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise 
to the Rock of our Salvation. I first want to thank Lord Jesus 
that I am alive. My health is very good, only my feet is very 
sore from walking so much. But I am not walking as much as 
my Heavenly Father did. But yet it is a wonderful blessing to 
be on this side. 
        I was blessed with the priviledge last Sunday to go to Chapel
Hill M.B.C.  My business there was to see was it true my [x] 
cousin Lucy Herron was dead. And when I made my business known 
[xx] the good church memebers told me she was dead and it 
hurt me to my heart. I come near screaming when they told me.
