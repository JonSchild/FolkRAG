AL:  What is a ground hog, now?
Stan:  Well, a ground hog, he stays in the ground.  Some of 'em calls 'em
woodchuck, but we call 'em ground hog.  And they're pretty good to eat, they're
good as beef to eat, but you have to cut them kernels out from under the front
legs you know, but they're better when they're eaten corn and stuff in the
fall of the year, you know when they get fat.  And when they get fat you can't
use 'em as a banjo hide, too much grease.  So I'll play the "Ground Hog" on
this.  (Plays)(Sings)(Laughs). . . .they'll eat you up, boy, if you get a hold
of one.
AL:  Tell us about these different animals that you find out in the woods. . . .
show us these animals.
Stan:  This is a fox.  I go in the woods, and I look around, now these is pretty
well natural, I do a little to 'em, slick 'em up and all, maybe have to put an
eye in 'em, they may have an eye out and gone.  I don't do very much to 'em,
just very little.  This is a fox, right here now, and this is its nose.  See
its nose there, how long it is.  And this is is ears here, and this is his ear.
And right here is his tail, that's a fox tail.  And he's pretty bad to (unint.)
and all so. . . .I hunt 'em out in the woods, I find a lot of stuff in it if you
know what you're looking for.  So, I'll put him down here. . . . . . .
Now, that was a pretty mean animal, and this is a -- some of 'm calls 'em
skunks, I call 'em pole cats.  Well, when you look, you have to see what you
are looking for.  This here is a pretty nice one.  So it's raised little
pole cats, and I'll just turn it right around, mighty slow, and I'll let you
see where they suckle 'em at.  That's where they suckle the little ones at,
you know.
AL:  Can you say what a pole cat's stink will do to you?
Stan:  Yeah, this pole cat here now, they're skunk.  If you get very close to
