9.
He searched the woods, he searched the groves, he searched them all around,
Till he found a lovely woman with her hair pinned to the ground.
"How come you here,"  said Johnson, "how come you here fast bound,
How come you here stark naked with you hair pinned to the ground?"

"They robbed me, they stripped me, they left me here fast bound,
They left me here stark naked with me hair pinned to the ground."
Now Johnson bein' a valiant man...
?
?
an' bore a valiant mind.
He wrapped her up in his big coat an' set her on behind.

As he was riding along the road, as fast as he could ride,
She clapped her fingers to her ears, an' gave three bitter cries.
Then up come three bold swaggerin' blades with their swords all in their hands,
They called to young Johnson, then bid him stand.

"I will stop, I will stay," said Johnson, "I will stop, I will stay," said he,
"For I never was in all my life afraid of any three."
So Johnson, two of them he slew, the other he did not mind,
When he was after the other one, she ripped him all behind.

"I must fall, I must fall," cried Johnson, "I must fall unto the ground,
For since this cruel woman has give me my death wound."
