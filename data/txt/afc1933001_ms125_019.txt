Dear Mr. Clarke:

    I received your letter at Schirmers and was sorry to
learn that you were out of town. It was impossible for me
to stay in New York until Monday but I hope that we may
meet soon anyway. In the meantime, if there are any
questions which you think can be settled by correspondence,
please let me hear from you soon.

    With best wishes,

    Sincerely yours,

    Acting-Chief,
    Division of Music
