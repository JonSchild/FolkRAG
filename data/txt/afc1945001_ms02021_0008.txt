Gentlemen: At the request of the Regional Director of the Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services, Mr. Heber R. Harper, I have kept an account of rumors which I have heard during the week of August 3 to August 8. Following is my brief report:
I am sorry not to be able to report more statements; it so happens that during the period under observations, I was unable to be out of the office or my home very much.

Very truly yours
