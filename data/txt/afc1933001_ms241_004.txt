Dear Father:

Under separate cover, I am sending you 2 speeches of Spivacke's
about the Archive; 2 press releases about the Phonoduplication Division,
which speaks of me and the radio use of folk lore and folk songs, and the
master sheets of the geological check list (please return to me as soon
as possible); the reports on the Archive of American Folk Song from 1928-1939;
and your Wild West clippings.  I have never written down any of my speeches
on the Archive so that's that.  The top numbers in the Archive as of today
are; discs 4627, cylinders 373.  We have money this year for extensive
duplication of other collections and for a number of field trips.  Machines
are now in the field in Alabama, Alaska, Dutch Guiana, Wisconsin, South
America.  There are available through the Archive about 2000 songs on records
from all over the country.  The geological check list does not include the
approximately 5000 folk songs in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Creiol, Siberian,
Finnish, German, Czechs, Hungarian, Italian, Greek, Russian, Lithuanian, Armenian,
Turkish, and various Indian, Polynasian languages.

We are planning this year a number of trips to South American and
have been awarded $6000 by Congress, for sending our records to South America
for their Universities and radio stations etc.  We have a fully equipped sound
truck, which will travel all over American during the next two or three years
etc.  I hope this is what you need.  If you want anything more write me air
mail.  Since the appropriation bill is now signed we can talk business about
the machine.  Would you like to do some recording in Texas?  The Old Lady in
Canancha country for instance, then work with Emerick in Colorado.  Peter Hurd
in New Mexico and so forth.  How do you feel about this?  Your reply should
arrive about the time Emericke does, and we can make a budget then. 

Elizabeth and I just spent last week-end on the Kitty Hawk sands.
We are both very well and hearty.  Much love until later.

Alan Lomax
