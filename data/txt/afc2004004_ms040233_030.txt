Highlanders the perils of our 
Charles Stuart, I remember 
confessing an ardent desire to see 
his Highness, without, however, the 
most distant idea that such an 
unlikely meeting would ever occur.
139 - - - - As parties of the
 McLeod and Campbell militia
 were roaming over South Uist, no 
person was allowed to leave the 
island without a passport, and a
guard posted at every ferry, besides 
the channel between Uist and Skye 
being thick with war vessels, just 
imagine the danger of the poor
royal wanderer, so hemmed in 
by bands of cruel soldiers, who, as 
well as their leaders, were deaf to 
every voice of humanity.
141 - - - -  oh, how I longed to see him!
