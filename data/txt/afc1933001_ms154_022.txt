          At the present time, the several thousand records of
folk music in our Archive of American Folk-Song are not 
available for use because of the lack of necessary duplicating
equipment.  We are hoping and endeavoring to secure such 
equipment, however, and when it is acquired a regular phonoduplication
service will be established.

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
