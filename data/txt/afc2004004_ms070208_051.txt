July 26.
Morning - A session of stories and toasts told by
jet bull-froggy Asa Ware and friends on 
a shady porch of the Hobson Plantation , Wormley
at her most tactless best. The stories fine & 
bawdy.
Afternoon - Interview with old McClennon on the 
Sherrod - plantation - 85 yrs. old. 1/2 Irish, a 
tough man, clinging now to the system hoping
[he] it will take care of him when he get old.
Ice cream & cake with a young 
negro planter - 300 acres propertied - his wife
& seven children  in their comfortable, middle-class 
home - books, study, etc.. on the Sherrod
place. His father & old man Sherrod, boys
together in Alabama. The man is handsome
in an Arabian style - eyes too close & [a] a cold
fish & vain. Wormley impossible,
Evening, Recorded a footwashing at the 
Sanctified church - machine outside of the
backdoor in the dark - they're fine & simple
people, enjoying their religion - lovely
songs, many traditional spirituals. At 11:30
drove Will Starks  - nearly white - talks as
white, seems po' white - except for [t??]
