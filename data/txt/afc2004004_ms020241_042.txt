     I say, "I didn' know Clyde was comin' along with us."  You know?

was comin' right along with us."
     An' she say, "You know he [come] comin' home the time we come home."
     An' still I ain' heard nobody up in the house.  I look up
in the house; there ain't nobody up here in the house, an' the do'
wasn' open!  So I said -- I didn' say nothin' to A.B. about it.
I come on back here an' I shut the back door good.  I knew then
if anybody come in.  Said, "He might be in there.  He's gon' --

     I said, "That's ol' Clyde an' he come in here behind us.

Clyde laughin' down the road with some peoples comin' home.
"Kwa, kwa, [kwa,] kwa!"  He laughed loud.  An'!  Clyde an' them
was comin' home!  Ho, ho!  I don't know who that man was.  But
we [d] seed 'im -- I seed 'im good                      that night, in that
same house.  I'd been there three or four years, but I [didn'] had
