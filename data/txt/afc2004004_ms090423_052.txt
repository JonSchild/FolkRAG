Attitudes of Conflict and Adjustment in Race Relations
on the Plantation

Much of the traditional forms of relationships between whites
and the plantation Negro still remain, but there are evidences of 
changes at the present.
A departure from the traditional paternalism of the plantation
system is revealed in the following account: "Old man Anderson
ainâ€™t as bad as they say, but you know he ain't going to vivy up 
and give you something for nothing.  Anyways the best way to handle
him is to be around him as least as possible.  That's the way he
gets most folks.  Yah he'll give you money on a car and let you take
up most nigh all the food stuff you need, and even that you don't 
need.  Now me, I don't get nothing from him, that way I ain't got 
no account at his store.  Even a t that he had me counted up for 
$420.00 - says it was for seed and planting and things like that,
and they airplane sprays your crop.  I guess maybe he's right, it
might done cost him that much.  Now supposing I had gotten food,
meat, money for a car, and things like that - well that white man
woulda been owning me.  That's just the way most of these folks
round here is.  My notion is to take as least from the white man as
I can - that way when he get through taking from me, as I knows he
is show to do; there's something left for me, but if I takes from
him (food, etc.) when he starts taking from me, he just takes it
all."
Conflicts are recurrent and the habits are in clash with the
customary ways of behavior.  One informant relates an incident.
