And into her hauser pipe I shuck my [be] gib
With legs over - hanging like fenders on a
Like the tow of the, pirate that scuttlled the ship
She cried out, "Oh sailor you're doing me har
You're in the wrong port jack" she cried, i
alarm
"Wrong port be damned, any port in a storm
Now she burnt my [I]  gibboom clear down to the
hull,
And down to the side bay my punt I did

With my foregaft in splinters and my main sail
unhung
The doctor said, "Sailor; your main mast is
sprung."
