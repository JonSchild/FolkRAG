in on you in a few months or so.

In the next edition of
Cowboy Songs (to come soon)
I am insisting that your
name come on the title page
as music editor. You might
send to Miss Susan [Ruirk?] at
Macmillans just the form
you wish printed.

Fishing here is the best
in the world. My average
for an afternoon - 40 pounds.

With my very kindest
regards to the Waters' clan,
in toto, believe me always
Sincerely yours
John A. Lomax
