Alan Lomax,
General Deliver
New Orleans.

Dear Mr. Engel;
Father is in the hospital with a rather bad
attack of malarial fever, which he contracted at the
Lousiana state farm about two weeks ago. Our plans,
of course, aredependent upon his good health. New
Orleans has, so far, proved a very barren field for
collection. The river packets are gone and with them
the singing roustabouts. The police have driven out th
"Hoo-doo" dances. And the speaking of Creole is entirely
out of style.  . . Our last few trials of the machine
have been [x] much more successful and I believe the
[troubl] the defects we have noticed are defects in our
technique. I expect to make recordings this week-end
[and] and will write how they turn out.
