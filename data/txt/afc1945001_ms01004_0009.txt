Armed Forces . . . . continued

miscellaneous
"All women who have had civilian defense training (such as the interceptor 
service) are now being called up for active duty." (Texas)

"Our boys are being trained to fight in any manner -- they are taught how
 to slip up and attack from the rear, choke their victims with their handkerchiefs, 
stab them in the back, or what have you, and never create any noise whatsoever." 
(Tennessee)

"Soldiers at the Air base here spend much of their time in the Negro
quarters of the town where general diseases are running riot." (Georgia)

Criticism of the Administration

"They say that the war cannot possibly be over inside 2 or 3 years at the
earliest. Washington would never let the "Big Fellows" down, who have turned
their factories into war production. It would take them that long to turn
themselves." (New York)

"This country is heading for socialism under the present administration.
Roosevelt is trying to ruin small business and to subsidize big ones to the extent
that the government can take them all over later." (Pennsylvania)

"They've stopped the war in Washington until after the election . . . and
Roosevelt is laying the groundwork for a fourth term now. He'll get it, too." 
(Pennsylvania)

"It isn't generally known, but there is to be the greatest shake-up in
Congress this Fall in the history of the country." (New York)

"Of course, everyone knows that the President doesn't want the war to end 
before 1943 elections because if the war isn't over 'there will be no elections'."
(New York)

"It is common knowledge at the Office (WPB) that they are not going to
allow this war to end until after the election; he (FDR) is going in again with
a bang." (Massachusetts)

"There is just one thing which they are interested in and that is in
seeing that he (FDR) gets in again, and that the Congressmen are back in and
they can get their hands on more and more money." (Massachusetts)

"Roosevelt doesn't have anyone of any intelligence telling him what to do.
This administration is overloaded with crackpots. Imagine Lincoln and Washington 
being advised by men like Harry Hopkins. They've got too many jews down there
. . . Henderson's real name is Horowitz . . . and Morgenthau . . . and a bunch of other
ones." (Pennsylvania)

"It is bad enough to see the Administration leaders playing politics at
such a time, but it is now getting into the Army and Navy and this country will
go no place with politics there." (Massachusetts)
