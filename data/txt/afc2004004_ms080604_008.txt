and harness 'em up and then you go to the kitchen and eat,
and then you go to the pit and you find your wheeler and you
set there till it got light enough for the man breaking out
the Johnson bar for to see how to load it.  The Johnson bar
was what they locked down when they load the wheeler.  And
Monday morning, Gertrude say, "Honey?", I say, "Huh?", she
say. . .  --I wunt nothin' but a boy-- she say, "You goin out?".
I said, "Naw, I ain't going."  I said, "Today's supposed to be
payday."  Mr. Brown didn't go out early like he had been doin.
He was out there (unintelligble), I walked out with my boots 
and pants on, just like he had on.  Had on a brown suede coat.
He said, "Baby Boy", he said, "What was wrong?  How come you
didn't catch Ada, Emma and Martha?", --my mules was named
right where they worked-- Emma near, Ada swing and Martha 
stickin'. He said, "Well, somebody else has got 'em".  I said,
"Well, that don't make me no difference Mr. Brown", I said,
"Today payday".  He said "Well come on in here, I'm goin pay
you off."  I went on in there --he didn't have his gun on--
and I went on in there and he went around behind the counter
to where his safe was. And he kneeled down, at his safe.
When he kneeled down at his safe, I layed that 41 'cross the
counter, and I called him, I said, "Mr. Brown?" I said an I
said, "Raise up" an' I said, "Don't come up with nothin' but
money."  I said, "Cos If you do, I'm gon' let the hammer
fall."  And he held up both hands and he said, "I'm getting
your money", he said, "Every man here, wudn't nar a man
here. . ." --well somebody in the camp had told him -wasn't
supposed to go this mornin' -- He said, "But seven covered
their hearts". He said, "They didn't have guts enough".  Well,
you know what they said "covered their hearts" he said, "But
they didn't have guts enough."  I said, "Well, don't bring me
nothin' but money."  He said, "Do you know what I owe ya?", I
say, "Yass sir, I know every lick you owe me."  He said, "What
I owe ya?".  I say, "You owe me five hundred and eighty-five
dollars." And he opened a little box, a strong box, about
that long (gestures).   He give me six hundred and eighty-five
dollars.  And I said, "No" said, "give me five hundred and 
eighty-five dollars" I say, "I don't want you to say that
I robbed you."  He said, "I'm givin' you this for your guts.
You the youngest man in the camp, and I'm givin this hundred
dollars for your guts."  He said, "Now, I don't want you to go
back in the pit no mo, just stay here and ride the truck with
my daughter."  He said, "Let's go get (Rose?) and work in the
commissary, and go dressed up everyday."  His daughter was 
named Miss Moores, he told the (corral?) boss, he says,
"Saddle up Moore's horse and my horse" and we go down
in the pit, and he had every wheeler, every (front-loader?,
fresno?), everything he had, (to Bill Gordon) you know how
they used to do-- let 'em make a ring around it. . .
Bill Gordon:    
Yeah. . .
