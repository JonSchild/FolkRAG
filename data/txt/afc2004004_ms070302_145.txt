Haitian Folk-Lore

Small countries, like small people, make news when they are visited
by death. The other day Haiti made news when between eight and twelve thousand
Haitians were slaughtered in San Domingo. After [this] the [hacked] [the]
[corpses] bodies were safely underground, the [diplomats got together and] Haitian & Dominican governments
estimated what this lot of dead Haitians would come to. They finally decided
on $80,000. That makes a common, ordinary, garden variety Haitian worth
in the neighborhood of $10. What an upper class, educated and refined
Haitian is worth has not been determined since none of them were killed.

[Some of the] One of the reasons [the estimatesxxx] that lower-class Haitians [were] are [estimated to be]so
inexpensive [was] is that they are generally [presumed] supposed to be dirty, [stupid] illiterate,
uncivilized and full of disease. [Besides this] They are [known] known to practice
a barbaric, [bloody] African religion --- Voodoo, and said to indulge [at all times]
in orgiastic rites. Some or all of this is urged as an excuse for the above bargain.
[Besides this they are Negroes, their skins are black. In
the course of this talk I plan to supply material
in terms of records, pictures and the impressions of a four month's stay on the island, which will, I hope,
make some of these presumptions [much] less acceptable.]
