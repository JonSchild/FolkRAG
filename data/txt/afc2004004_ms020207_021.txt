Reverend Roe.  Reel8.   P.2
were all at home pretty well all the time.  And every day we'd be work-
ing in the field, father would be looking over us.  And when we was at
[*Father ruled in his home*]
home, why, mother would be there.  So it wasn't so with us.  We had to
obey, And if we disobeyed Mother, why, it just was too bad when Father
found it out.  We just had to do what Mother and Father said, and we
didn't think of anything else.  We didn't attempt to rebel against them.
I never 'sputed my father's word.  I never 'sputed my mouther's word
in my life.  I was always obedient.  [and] I worked on til the day I was
21 years old.  I worked for my father, and I generally would work [at] out at
night by the moonshine.  Sometimes [reading] split rails, some[times] in [cotton picking]
time picking cotton, pick cotton and make money to get my clothes and things.
[*12 in Family*]
A:  And there was a big family of you there.
R:  Twelve in the family.
A:  Was it a happy time for you?  Did you all have good times as well
as work [well] hard?
[*Saturday night was a big time*]
R:  Well, we worked most all the time.  We'd have a big time on Saturday 
evenings.  They'd give us Saturday evenings.  And sometime when we
had laid by our crop, why, we'd have a spell there, you know, there between
laying by and gathering time, we'd go fishing and swimming, and just 
have a big time.  We'd enjoy that very much.
A:  What kind of parties did they have in our younger days?
R:  We just had [both] mostly the old-time dances, you know, square dance, and
then we had we call ring plays, you know they'd ring up and be singing, you
know.
A:  Do you remember any other names of the games that you played in
those ring plays?
[*Games*]
R:  O well, we played some of the same games that you play now, such as
baseball [but] only it was different.
A:  No, I mean in ring plays.
R:  Oh, well, I've forgotten most [of them] of um -- different kind of little
old plays they'd ring up, you know.
