Brownsville, Tex.

Dear Mr. Spinocke:

1. Send me, please, University Station, Austin, Texas, a "To Whom it may Concern" letter of introduction that will serve to get me by Governors, Wardens, and such like. One signed by you will suffice

2. A dozen small-sized blanks records for gifts to singers would help me over many rough places.

Thanks.

Yours,
John A. Lomax
