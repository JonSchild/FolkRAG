Gentlemen:

I should like to recommend Mr. Alan Lomax for the E. D. Farmer Fellowship 
to be awarded by the University of Texas for the coming year. In
my position at the Library of Congress, I have had several opportunities,
during the past two years, to come into close personal contact with Alan
Lomax and to observe his work. The result of this observation has convinced 
me that there is probably no young man in this country better
fitted for the study of American folk-songs and folk-lore, than he is.

His collaboration with his father and his own independent work recording 
material for the Music Division of the Library of Congress has
given him an unusual amount of experience in this type of work. He is
also observant and has often demonstrated his ability to report his observations 
in a most interesting fashion.

The work he plans to do during the coming year, the collecting of
folk-material in Mexico, represents a field which has hardly been studied.
A good collection of records of Mexican folk songs accompanied by an intelligent 
study of them would prove very valuable to students of the subject 
and I believe that Alan Lomax is eminently suited for just such an
undertaking.

In addition to this, I should like to call attention to his seriousness 
and sincerity of purpose which combined with a very winning personality 
should go a long way toward success in his chosen field of endeavor.

Yours truly,

Assistant Chief,
Division of Music

P.S. I am enclosing a reprint of the annual report of the Music Division of
the Library of Congress containing, on p. 29-31, excerpts of a letter from
Alan Lomax to his father which I thought might be of interest to you.
