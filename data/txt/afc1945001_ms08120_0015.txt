"Rumor"

I have heard and still am hearing of the unjust
treatment of Negro sailor's and soliders. It seems
as those people would treat use in general like
any other race. Just look at the NEgro race's
advancement in life no other race has been
as progressive and true towards a nation as
the negro has been to America. We too like
all other nations and race's have a few bad
apple's, but more and more of our people
have shown what they can do. If ever our
race gets an equall chance as have the otehr
nations I'm certain it would stand out in
all race's. Half of the time these rumors are
true, and it makes some people feel verry
bad, it is so critically it could even turn
people on the enemys side.
