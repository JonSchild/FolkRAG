have always known he was

Heard at
home from my
husband as he
reported conversation
at his place of business

Russia to exhaust not only Germany, but
herself. They are just as much afraid of
a victorious Russia as of a victorious
Germany.

are like stags fighting
and drawing blood from
each other. England and
the United States will
come in at the kill
