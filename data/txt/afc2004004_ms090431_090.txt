Fisk, 10.  12.  WILL STARK.

A:  When did that begin?
S:  Last year.
A:  Before that you had lo[s]ts of music?
S:  Yessir, we had lots of music, dancing, people enjoyed theirselves, 
but Mr. G[ir]rieg stopped us from that, from dancng.  Broke up all the 
juke houses and placeslike that.  When Mr. Ben Lombard was sheriff, 
it was wide open.  We had lots of music anywhere, these dances and 
halls and places, on the street -- but Mr. Grief broke that up since he 
got to be sheri ff.  When Mr. Lombard died, they 'pointed Capt. Tom 
Gibson for that, and he start d that I think.  Mr. Grieg promised to 
carryit out.  He's a rich man a d he was state's attorney and of course, 
he had lots of money and two or three big plantains.  He ran for Congress once; That's what he's after; he's not parti[u]cular about money 
and one thing or another; he wants to go to Congress.
A:  So he didn't have to collect money?
S:  No sir, he didn't have to cllect from these bars and one thing or another.  They said, they voted these laws in and one thing or another, 
and what they called, put the lid on, they had it on go[d]od and tight.
