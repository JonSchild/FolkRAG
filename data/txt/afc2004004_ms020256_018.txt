like Pap-Papa an' them used to blow. You know, real quail. You 
know, you go an' cut it, out, out the woods or, ah poplar tree 
thing; look like what they cut. An', an' a hole come in it, ya 
know, ta, ta blow, like a boy make the whistles; an' Papa used 
to make them. Well, this thing fixed that way, but it got sumpin'

been wire or s-- or wire or sumpin'. But anyhow, he could sit 
on the step, let it come on up, an' have it -- got this thing

workin' on ya, he'd jump an' look at ya then jump an' cut the

carried Leola out there. That wa' the only that wa' the only time I had been there,
