     I tried him first on the tragedy of "Big Jim" which had come to 
me from Vicksburg Mississippi.
          Cold and chill is de winter wind,
          Big Jim's dead and gone.
          Big Jim was my lovin' man
          Long, long, long are de years.
And on I read those lines of Shakesparion intensity and purless
phrasing.
     ("Oh, I've got you, Mr. Lathom, I saw you try to smother that
gulp of sympathy with your handkerchief.")
     Next I read him that long ballad of Adam and Eve in the garden
pining leaves, read it all and read it in the shouting style that
Mrs. Carrie Langston Cox taught me when I was a boy. (Tom Peete Cross
of the University of Chicago gave me that ballad. At the modern 
Language Association he used to recite it to uproarous applause with
the fourth drink coming up. And I like it even if Robert Gordon, who
knows more about folk songs than a whole company of experts, does
hold that it is not of Negro origin.) In the concluding stanzas the 
Lord takes the situation everything in hand and shouts when he
discovers an apple missing.
     "Adam, Adam, where are thou?"
     Dese bones gwine to rise again
     "Here, my Lord, I'm a-coming now,"
     Dese bones gwine to rise again.

     "Stole my apple, I believe,"
     Dese bones gwine to rise again
     "No, my Lord, but I spilt it on Eve"
