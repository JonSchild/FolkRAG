BJ TAPE 7D, p. 43

      Lil' boy didn' say anything.
     The other man said, "Yes," said, "That would be a good idea,
to do that."
     An' so the lil' boy didn' say anything yet.
     An' so, an' um, finally the boy asked -- ah, another man asked the
boy's father, he didn' say anything.  The boy asked -- The man asked
the lil' boy.  Says, "Son," says, says, "You, will you go down?"
Says, "I'll tie the rope around you. . ."  You know, hook the rope in there
an' make a, make a harness of the rope around his, ah, waist, ya
know.  "And ah, and letcha down.  An' then I'll pull ya up."
      [Well, say,] The boy said, "I'll go down there on one condition."
     He said, "What is it?"  He said, "What's that?"  Well, he
thought he might want pay or sumpin', ya know?
Said, "What's that?"
     He said, "That is my father have the other end of the rope."
He looked at his father.  Say, "Now, if he got the other end of
the rope, I'll go down."
     An' so, hah, hit was won'erful, ya know!  A lot in that
thing.  'S a lot in there.  He had confidence in his father, that,
but none of 'em -- not the other men, that they pull him up, not
for sure.  'S a deep place an' a bad place.  But if his father
on top -- got the other end of the rope, he go down in faith,
in confidence. 
     An' so, they did that, ya see?  an' he was satisfied of it. . .
