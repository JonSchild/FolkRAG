Mother, Did You Bring Me Any Silver

Mother, did you bring me any silver?
Mother, did you bring me any gold?
What did you bring me, dear mother,
To keep me from de gallis pole?

Son, I brought you some silver.
Son, I brought you some gold,
Son, I brought you li'l' evy'thing,
To keep you from de gallis pole?

I didn' bring you no silvo,
I didn' bring you no gold,
I jus' come here to see you
Hung upon de gallis pole.

Son, I brought you some silvo,
Son, I brought you l'il' gold,
Son, I brought you l'il evything,
To keep you from de gallis pole.
