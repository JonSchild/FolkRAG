Some rumors contain verifiable  facts and cannot be denied
without revealing facts which must remain unpublished. [When a warship
is in an American harbor, for example, that fact cannot be published 
without aiding the enemy--even though the ship and its sailors are visible 
to many people in the port area. Extravagant rumors--about the
ship, crew, or cargo--may spring up in such a situation. It is an unavoidable 
situation.] Projects can urge newspapers which print the information, 
after enough time has elapsed, to emphasize why the facts had 
to be kept unpublished and why the rumors had to remain unchallenged.
Projects can impress their communities with the fact that something known
to hundreds of people is not necessarily known to thousands of people; 
and that the repetition of rumors--even those based upon a fact known to
the rumor-teller--makes it easier for the enemy to find out what he may 
not know, or may simply suspect.
DIRECT REFUTATION
While the major responsibility of a rumor control project is
to fill information gaps and to conduct an educational campaign in critical 
thinking, it may sometimes become necessary to try direct counteraction, 
that is, refuting rumors with specific information. This particular 
device in rumor control has many dangers, since it involves giving 
publicity to the rumor in an attempt to eliminate it. Unless the rumor 
and its denial are skillfully presented, more harm is done than good.
Because direct counter-action is a new field, the experience of the
Office of War Information is here presented in the form of positive recommendations.
1. Rumor denial should only be done in print; never over the 
radio.
2. In general, deny only those rumors which can be denied
flatly and conclusively.
