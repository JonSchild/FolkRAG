In these and all other dealings of the Library of Congress
we hold the interest of the local collector paramount, and we 
take the greatest pains that the collector, rather than the 
institution, receives full credit for his work. I believe that 
you can consult collectors who have contributed material to our 
files and find that we are scrupulous in abiding by whatever 
restrictions are imposed by the collector. In case you should 
decide to deposit your originals here eventually, or should you 
wish them to be duplicated in the manner discussed above, you 
could feel completely secure about the collection. 

Dr. Harold Spivacke is now the chief of the Music Division, 
and the Archive is under his supervision. 
Cordially yours, 
Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge 
Archive of American Folk-song
