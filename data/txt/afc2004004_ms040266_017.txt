Dear Alan Lomax,
I have listened with enormous pleasure to your
programmes of folk music in Sicily and Italy and should like
to express my thanks and appreciation.
Just after the war I spent a couple of years in
Calabria, Puglia and the Abruzzi working among refugees, and
while staying in Ortona a Mare I got to know a number of the lovely
characteristic songs of this region. I did  hope you would have
played one or two of these, but as you did not I have been
wondering whether perhaps you missed them. If so, I strongly
recommend that on your next visit to Italy you should make a
point of recording some.
They resemble most nearly the 'Stonnelle' you played this
evening, and more than anything else, the bawdy song of the rice
workers you broadcast, only having a more oriental character. The
people of Ortona state confidently that they are Albanian in
origin.
As the local dialect is quite separate from pure Italian
I never managed to get more than an approximation to the words,
but some of the names I remember were 'La [luen] lun' e la
Maiella", 'Che belezza chi sere", "Lu Prima Fromme" and 
"Tante Salute" - but if you should visit Ortona your difficulty
would not be to persuade the people to sing but to get them ever to
stop.
Some years before the war I saw the Grace Moore film
"One Night of Love". In this Grace Moore was shown as a
