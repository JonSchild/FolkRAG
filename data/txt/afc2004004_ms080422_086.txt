Time Code:  Tape 896 Nimrod Workman 1
Mrs. W: I went to Sunday School on Sunday and his cousin 
wanted me to stop and see her as I come back along. I didn't 
know him, I didn't know he was there, I wouldn't have known 
him anyway. And when I stopped in for a few minutes, he was
there, and he maybe said a few words to me, and instead of 
giving me some gum, he give it to his cousin to give it to me. 
And so when I was going to go home, he wanted to take me home. 
I told him, you might be a married man. I couldn't trust him. 
Well, I let you know I didn't care one way or the other. So 
he followed me on home anyway. Just talking. Talking about.... 
about a week and a half, pretty close to a week, then get 
married. I think that's crazy.....first time I ever saw him 
was down to his cousin's.
AL: You said you didn't know what you was doing in that length 
of time?
Nimrod: Yeah, if I didn't know what I was doing in that length 
of time....I knew what I was doing.
Mrs W: I thought it was awfully crazy going about getting married 
that quick.
Nimrod: Anybody could have said something and caused you  
maybe to quit on my , took somebody else. I knew nobody else was seeing 
you. Well, I had you....had my fingers around you, I was 
gonna hold on. I knew what I was doing, and I know it yet. 
I got the wonderfulest woman to me in the world, the best.
 My heart, my joy, and my satisfaction, and without her I 
wouldn't be satisfied.
