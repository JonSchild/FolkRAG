From Mabel Hillary to Joan Halifax, August 1966
I will have to tail you all about what made me write this
Please keep it fore me

if every body inthe world have a heart like you to just thank
all the good that thay could do
Thair would not be know ware to fight and you would not have
fear in you head at night
ho would warrow about the color of mand beaicouse thay would
not be know fear in man.
Wee all could shair God giving land and with love wee all
would understand and would not warrow about the color of mand.

You may be block you could be tan But lest just hope one day
we waunt warrow about the color of mand
not eavon about the colar of his hands
I understand the color of a man in this land s you to not trying 
good inside you too
It make you thank each day and night... if only I
could do more about the ware our boys have to fight
your heart goes out to every in this land.
ho have a boy what can know if the boys are block are tan.
You to have a heart that make you understand the it now differn
in a sold of mand.
