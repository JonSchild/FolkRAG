Dear Mrs. Harold:

Elizabeth, after quite a violent but short seige of strepto
is now very much improved and up and around again. She's taking
thyroid, iron and liver extract and probably by Spring will have her
long delayed operation. I think by then the medicine she's taking will
have her feeling a lot better. We have moved in town in an apartment.
The address is 912-19th. Street, N.W. and we'll both get a lot more
sleep.

I never met Margaret Johnson but I understand from Rick that
she looks better than she sings folksongs. Thanks for all the encouragement
about Back Where I Come From. I will forward the clipping on
to Nick. He needs the encouragement.

Much love always,

Alan
