to have a couple of carbon sets of the ballads I've 
collected so far. They may prove useful to you in 
eliminating the more obvious stuff that you pick up in all
the camps, if you are going after mining songs. Some
few I'm quite proud of and know that no one on god's 
green earth would ever find -- but I presume all rabid 
collectors have that feeling.

I am writing your father today, too, and sending
him a carbon of this letter to you. It's my turn to owe
him a letter. By the way, I'm getting out a small booklet
mining camps of Central City, Black Hawk, and Idaho Springs
in Colorado. Had an idea that if I could make a few pence
on it from tourists it would help in hinterland treks for
more stuff. I'm including some few traditional things from
the songsters for the historical background of the Westward
journeys and adding several things which I've gotten orally
in this region. Herndon Davis is doing the art work, and
I hope that the whole thing will be a presentable job. I'm
saving all the original drawings and cuts for these small
independent jobs, so that when time comes for a regular
book the cost of the art work will all have been absorbed. 

With best wishes. I look forward to seeing you this
summer.
Duncan Emrich. 

P. S. By the way, do you have intelligent young men among the
draftees spotting songs for you in each and every camp
throughout the country? Songs of the current war, particularly, 
but also for stuff that comes from all ends of the 
country? Good for morale and give the men something active
to do. Just an idea which you may already have had.
