beautiful folk traditions, it is first necessary that a careful
musical analysis of the available recorded material be made.
There are few musicians capable for this highly technical and
precise work, which consists in the studies of subleties most
of which are foreign to conventional music; and yet it is those
subleties, often unnoticed or "corrected" by musicians, that make
a folk-song what it is.

The project I suggest is the establishment of course,
which will at the same time be a research and artistic project, in
the transcription of folk music.  This class should work under the
supervision of some expert in the field of primitive music, most
preferably of Dr. Herzog of Yale University; and use as its raw material
the collection of records at the Library of Congress supplemented
by material from Yale, Harvard and Columbia.

The results of a year-long project of this sort would
be manifold and important.
1)There would be in this country a group of
experts in the transcription of folk music whose services in the
study of primitive and folk music would be invaluable.
2)An analysis of American folk music on a large
scale would have been made which analysis would be basic to all
other work in that field.
3)A group of young performers and composers
would, perhaps, be on the track of a genuine American music-- operas,
sympnonies and so forth based on American folk music.  Fitting arrangements
for American folk-songs, that we are sorely in need of,
could certainlybe written by these musicians whey they had become
thoroughly acquainted with the style of this music
4)  Certainly a few Amricanmusicians would
know how to perfrom American folk songs.

In the hope that this project will win your approval 
and interest, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
