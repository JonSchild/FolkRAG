Nick, I think you ought to get an angle down on that fiddle,
start with that instead of the one you've got

(music)

A. LOMAX

Great. You all made a song about a little piece, a little
dollar here and a little dollar there, that's a depression
piece, isn't it? Tell us about it. You start.

LUDERIN

Well, the days when we were playing in the 1930's, a dollar
was a lot of money. SOmebody tell you that you were
spending a dollar here and a dollar there, that meant that
you were a little bit loose with your money. So that is the
reason that this song was recorded, it's sort of relating to
that sin at that time.

EDWIN

Luderin, tell them what we was making per night, per man.

LUDERIN

Actually, we was making big money. Three dollars a man per
night, provided the man that run the dance hall would feed
us that night and sleep us and board us for that day. Three
dollars was big money in those days, now what he's talking
about. That's why...(quotes line in French from song)

A. LOMAX

What do the words say in English?

LUDERIN

Well, the first verse, of course, says something about when
the boy became twenty-one , his dad told him it was time for
him to quit spending a dollar here and a dollar there. And
then the next time, the words that come in is that he got
married and he knew it was going to be "a dollar here and a
dollar there", and then then next verse, his wife was making
baby clothes and then he was sure it was going to be a 
dollar here and a dollar there.

EDWIN

It's a cute one.
