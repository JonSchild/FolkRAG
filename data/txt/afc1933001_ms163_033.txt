finished in a manner satisfactory from the musicological standpoint.
The really important thing is that someone do it soon, for 
I have seen change in folk dance and music just within the last
few years. It would be a pity to lose the charm of what remains,
especially the dance accompaniments furnished by an oddly tuned
vertical flute and drums.
                                                 Sincerely,
                                                     Valborg Kjosness
                                                     Valborg Kjosness
