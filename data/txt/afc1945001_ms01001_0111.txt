Rumor control projects must not lead to witch-hunts. Care 
must be taken to avoid the over-simplified identification of the rumor-monger 
with the Axis-agent. Undoubtedly, there are Axis agents spreading rumors. 
However, most rumors are being spread by loyal [thinking] Americans. These 
loyal members of the community must be educated to the error of their 
ways, but the community must not get the feeling that every gossip is an
Axis agent, that their neighbor is living on gold from Berlin or Tokyo. 

Just as rumor control projects must avoid the conception of Axis 
agents in every block, so too must they avoid giving the impression of 
unsurpassable cunning in the enemy. Attempts to show the relation of 
rumors to Axis propaganda may prove very dangerous. A person who carelessly 
passes on a rumor and then discovers that it has appeared on the Axis shortwave 
is likely to become very much concerned about the source of the rumor, 
how he came to be "duped," etc. 

It is undesirable for local rumor control projects (with their 
limited facilities for such activity) to attempt to establish their own 
check on Axis propaganda. This service is available through the Office of
War Information, where it can be rendered with a viewpoint which will prevent 
local projects from misinterpreting short-wave broadcasts and inadvertently 
aiding the Axis. 

In some communities, particularly ports, war industry towns, and 
Army camp towns, members of the community have an opportunity to witness 
events related to the war effort. It is obvious that these items are of 
considerable interest not only to those who witness them, but to the 
community at large. It is also obvious that, for reasons of military 
security, newspapers must refrain from making any comment about certain 
occurrences until long after the event.
