OVER ALL THE LANDS

(Anvil Chorus - Page 12 - New Brown Book - C.C. Birchard Co.)


Over the prairies and over the mountains and up from the cities that
front the sea
Out from the mills and the mines and the forests is rising the call
that shall set men free.

Chorus: Over all the lands it sounds,
And over all the waters,
Earth and the fruits of earth
For all her sons and daughters,
No more each for each alone
But undivided, with heart decided,
We rise to claim our own.

Men in the grip of the farm and the factory, women the drudges of
kitchens and mill
Children bereft of the playtime of childhood have claimed for their
children the promise still.

Chorus:

Circled by hope and by hatred the Russian still flings forth his flag
in the frozen north
Southward the caste - ridden riots of India, even to them has the word
gone forth.

Chorus:

Eastward the back-broken four hundred million have cast off their
patience to front the sun
White men and black men and brown men and yellow are shouting at
last that all toil is one.

Chorus:

Brothers shall build us the homes that we dwell in and brothers shall
till for our food the soil
Brothers in freedom shall meet with each other, with gladness exchanging
the fruits of toil.

Chorus:

Brothers shall meet in the council of peoples, with old hates forgotten
and war-flags furled,
Brothers shall build us the ships and the railroads that bind us together
around the world.

Chorus:

Anna Louise Strong
