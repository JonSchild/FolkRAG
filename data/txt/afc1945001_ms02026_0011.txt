Dear Mr. Kane:

In compliance with your reguest I beg to submit
the following report.

Monday, August 10, 1942, Illiopolis, Illinois.

1. " A carpenter received a notice to appear for work on
the Sangamon Ordnance plant. He reported at the specified
time and place but there was no one to report to. He sat
around for half the morning and finally picked up a 2x4 and
began carrying it around to make believe he was working. 
He carried the board around the rest of the morning and most
of the afternoon before he noticed that he was being followed
by a man who also carried a 2x4. He did every thing he
could to try to shake the man following him but could not.
Finally late in the day the first man stopped and went back
to the second man and asked him why he was carrying the 2x4
around. The second man replied, "You are my boss. They
instructed me at the main office to follow you around and do 
everything you did."

every day." "Why?" Lady, "Well we have been worried for two 
weeks because the rumor is out that they have been firing
200 to 300 men each day over at the ordnance plant. Every
day my husband expects to get his slip. Neither of us can
sleep at night. With the four children about ready to start
to school and winter coming on we just can not get along with
out work." My reply, "Every day some one gets fired over at the
plant for incompetence or sabotage. Every day new men are taken
on. Your husband is a conscientious worker and has a good
incentive in you and your children. As long as he works hard
you need have no fear of being without work."

3. "Yep, the selective service is not fair at all. In
some counties they are sending married men while in other
counties there are hundreds of IAs still available. If
our government was at all competent the quotas would be
made on the basis of the number of IAs in a given county
rather than on the basis of the number of registrants. Why
there was so and so who was drafted and his wife had twins
four months after he was in the army. One of them died.
I wonder how he feels about the war not when there are single
men loafing in Chicago. Besides that when a county can not
