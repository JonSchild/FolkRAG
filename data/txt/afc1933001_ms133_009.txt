Dear Mr. Lomax:

In about five weeks I am sailing for England, to do a series
of programs for the British Broadcasting Corporation, illustrating
American history through its songs. As you may imagine, the
commercial companies cannot supply a half of the material I need,
and much of their stuff has been withdrawn from the catalogue or
destroyed. I am anxious to know if I may buy, borrow or beg records
from the collection you supervise.

Let me make my wants clearer by outlining the series. It will
contain twelve programs, each a half-hour long, the body of which
is to be music played exclusively on phonograph records. I have
chosen the following tentative titles:

Colonial Antqiues; Sailors and Whalers; Pioneer Songs; The
Great Plains; The Railroads; Pie in the Sky - the Negro and his
Prospects; The Texas Bad Men; Songs of the American Wars; The Big
Brutal City; The Great Rivers; The Depression and After.

For "The Railroad," for instance, I would prefer to play
Jay Gould's Daughter to Waiting for a Train; I would prefer the
Tie Tampin' Chant to a pathetic ballad. I want songs which name 
names and places, circumstances which seem to derive from the social
conditions under which the men worked. This is my general [out]line.
I can explain more when I see you.

I intend to come to Washington early next Thursday morning
(May 26th), and would like to see you at your convenience on Thursday
Friday or Saturday. Are any of these days all right?

I hope I do not intrude too much on your time. I shall be
very grateful indeed for any help you can give me.

Yours sincerely,
Alistair Cooke.
Alistair Cooke
