dear old lady a letter of thanks. The
other day she was 86 years old. She
told Miss Terrill "They gave me
a shower and so many presents!!
Everybody in the neighborhood came
to see me." Don't you dare
fail to write that letter!!

No letter had come [wi]
before I left home from Mr.
Spivacke notifying me officially
about my activities and those
of Mrs. Tartt. I'll wait for it
before heading for Alabama.

I'm not feeling too well.
Perhaps some active life on the
road will shake me out of
my physical and mental lassitude.

Lovingly always,
Father

Mrs. Calloway - especially - sends you her love.
