Sings Old French Songs
Elderly Vincennes Woman Aids Congressional
Library Making Records

VINCENNES, Ind., April 18 (Spl.) --Mrs. Josephine Caney, of Vincennes,
an authority on the old French songs and customs of this
community in pioneer days, has aided the Library of Congress in its
attempt to preserve
the songs and folk lore of early America.

During the last week Alan Lomax,
of the Congressional Library
staff, was 
here making records
of Mrs. Caney's
voice as she
sang the airs that
were popular 200 
years ago. A number
of other citizens,
representatives of the pioneer
French families,
also sang 
and aided in
making the collection
complete.

Mrs. Caney, now
past eighty, traces
her ancestry to
one of the first
families of the
frontier post here.
She is the great-granddaughter
of
Madam Menard,
whose name is 
listed with those
who served food
to Clark's army
here in 1779.

Recently, in collaboration
with
Mrs. Cecelia
Berry, of Chicago,
Mrs. Caney compiled
the early French songs of this
region, and the work is now in the
hands of a Chicago publisher. Mrs. 
Caney sang the melodies and supplied
the words, while Mrs. Berry
wrote the accompaniments.

In the last few years Mr. Caney
has participated in the National
Folk Festivals at St. Louis and
Chattanooga. She has also been
instrumental in keeping alive the
ancient King Ball celebration in
this community.
