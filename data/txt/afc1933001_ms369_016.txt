quarter and criticizes every point in the traditional definition 
of the ballad - yet no more than respectful mention
of her book is made in any of the recent literature on the
subject. It is on this account and because I regard hers
the most intelligent voice yet raised in the ballad controversy, 
that I shall devote the last and most lengthy portion 
of this paper to a discussion of her argument.

Miss Louis Pound's criticism of the "communal" theory.
Primitive Composition
The opening thrusts of her argument are telling.
Are "primitives," she asks, always dancing when they sing?
When they sing do they always sing as a group? Are their
songs of communal origin and communally composed? Are they
always narrative? These have been the assumption of Grimm,
Gummere, Kittredge and the rest. 
She answers these questions by turning to the available
 information on artistic activities among primitive 
peoples. She finds, for instance, groups of American Indians 
who sing together but who, individually sing a different
song, and the general effect is like a dozen cats tied up
in a tow-sack. She reads that '"a Kaffir differs from an 
European vocalist in this point, namely, that he always,
if possible sits down when he sings." She discovers American 
Indians, who are among the most primitive peoples we
know of, that sell songs to each other, that compose lyrics
