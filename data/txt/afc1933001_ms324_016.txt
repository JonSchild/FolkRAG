A SELF-LEADING SONG

Here is one of a number of American folk songs to be included in a
second collection of "Songs for Informal Singing" about to be published by
the National Recreation Association. This song was written down by Mr. Lyle
Ring from the singing of an elderly Maine farmer who has known it all his lifetime.
It may have arisen from the rhythmic work and warm geniality (or keen
desire for it) of a harvesting group on a cold, stormy day such as a Maine
nor'easter can kick up in a grand, blustering fashion.

It Rains and It Hails

It rains and it hails it's cold stormy weather. In comes the farmer
drink-ing ci-der, Who'll be the reaper? I'll be the binder
Lost my true love,Where shall I find her? Rat-tle-ad-die dum.

This one, that one says that he loves you No one -- else shall
price a-bove you, Heart in -- hand I free-ly -- give you,
One sweet kiss and run a-way and leave you Rat-tle-ad-die dum.

Mr. Ring has found several other songs in Maine and also in Massachusetts,
where he has been engaged by the State Agricultural Service to help develop singing
and festival groups among the rural people. Two more of his finds will be in
the collection mentioned above. These songs, generations old and yet never written
down before, so far as we know, are incidentally evidence of a kind of recreational
leadership that is often overlooked in our efforts to promote group singing. We
usually assume that we must have a time-beating leader with "personality" and other
special traits, a piano and someone to play it well, and song books or leaflets
before there can be group singing. While these are indeed valuable, it is good to
be reminded that anyone who really knows and loves a good song and can sing it in
tune without being at all self-conscious has all that is needed to set a not too
large group singing with him. That is doubtless all the equipment and leadership
that the above song has ever had to support it, and yet here it is, still going
strong after generations of what in comparison to our modern song-plugging and song
leadership, would be called neglect. And it is among the proverbially reserved
New England folk that it has passed from voice to voice through several generations

Try it. It is as alive and fresh as a brisk autumn day in New England,
and goes about as fast as a gay jog along a country road.
July, 1936
