Dear Friends:

We are now beginning to prepare our records for
publication and we wish to use two of your songs,
Jennie Jenkins and Pretty Polly which will be contained
on one side of a 12-inch record. For this
we are able to pay you $15.00 and will send you
two copies of the record when it is released. I 
hop you will give us your permission by signing
and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
The records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial
use only" and your names will appear on every
copy.

I hope you have been well since Elizabeth and I 
saw you last. It's been a great pleasure to be
reminded of you by listening to your records every
once in a while.

Cordially yours,


Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
