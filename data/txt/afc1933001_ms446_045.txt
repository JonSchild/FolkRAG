26

Oh, I wish He would come and take me in His
arms, that I might sleep.

Just before the lamps were lighted, just before the
children came,
While the room was very quiet I heard some one
call my name.
All at once a window opened on a field of lambs,
And sheep some far out a brook were drinking,
Some were lying fast asleep.

In a moment I was looking on a world so bright
and fair,
Which was filled with little children, and they
seemed so happy there.
They were singing, oh, so sweely, sweetest song
I ever heard,
They were singing sweeter, mother, than our little
yellow bird.

But I could not see the Savior, though I strained 
my eyes to see,
And I wondered if He saw me, would He speak to
such as me.
All at once a window opened--one so bright upon 
me smiled.
And I knew it must be Jesus, when He said
"Come here, my child."

"Come up here, little Bessie, come up here and
live with me;
Where little children never suffer, suffer through
eternity."
Then I thought of all you told me of that bright
and happy land,
I was going when you called me, when you came 
and kissed my hand.

And at first I felt so sorry you had called, I would
go,
