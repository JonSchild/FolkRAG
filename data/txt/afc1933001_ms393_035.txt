dialect version of Evangelical protestant hymns.  First and foremost 
there is the primary ingredience of a strong peasant soul with its 
naive faith -- a little believing and soul saving faith which would 
preserve the emotional sanity of of the Negro and kept his spirit somewhat above the fate of his fathers.  Then there was even out of the mass 
illiteracy some great intuitative understanding of his own experience.  
In terms of a grand and inspiring analogy with the Bible narratives.  
From which came all thsoe inspiring parables which kept hope alive
hope and faith alive and even the humblest Negro soul and formed the basis of the dramatic heart of the spirituals.  The bakbone of their 
narrative tradition is just such bible parables and they were selected 
on the basis of their closeness to the slaves experience -- own spiritual experience.  There was too borne out of the emotional fire of the group 
and a folk imagination the pass port that transposed the already 
glowing King James into real folk poetry.  The have given us and 
I wish I had more time to illustrate the poetic sides of the 
spiritual these have given us gems like "I lay in the grave and 
stretch out my arms and I lay this body down, I go to the judgment 
in the evening of the day when I lay this body down -- when I lay 
this body down and my sould and your soul meet the day I lay this 
body down." Or again things like that spiritual which Roland Hayes 
sings so beautifully -- "My Lord is so high you can't get over him.  
My Lord is so low you can't get under him -  you much come in and through the Lamb."  And finally there is the music itself - that great literacy 
of musical speech towering up over the dialect and -- sometime feeble words to make an instinctive welding of all this into amalgum 
of music that shades every music and bespokes a meaning almost independently 
of the words.  This it seems to me is that blend of factors
