Such an old [trickit loon]
(what does that mean?)
Well it means that he was full of tricks, he was tricked,
tricky and supposed to be bad - coarse -
he was bad you see.
(When would you sing a song like that, Jimmy?)

A diddling song, yes.  It goes to the same tune as
The Smith's a gallant Fireman [(a strathspey)
(Do you have any more diddling sons?  Any more songs to

My ship lies out to anchor and the harbour o'Dundee
Your face it is the fairest that ever I have seen,
Fair maiden will ye walk wi me, down my the Maudling green.
