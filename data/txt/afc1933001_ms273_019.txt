dance music to relieve tension, etc., have helped win wars 
without end and this is particularly true of and necessary 
in a democracy where grumblers are likely to grumble just 
out of habit. When Hitler came to power, he increased his 
budget for folk song. 
5. One of the major conflicts of present-day society lies in 
the defeat of the individual's aspiration toward creative 
expression by mass-industry, by commercialized and slicked-up 
art of all sorts. The materials and ideas of folklore,
folk-song, etc., provide an easy avenue of expression 
for the individual ego. Soldiers' songs are notably 
profane about war and its discomforts, for example; but intelligent 
officers have never discouraged them because they 
realized that the men were merely blowing off steam and 
singing a song, instead of, perhaps, shooting an officer in 
the back. 

Neither Hollywood, the radio, the educational system nor 
the public library has succeeded in selling "culture" to the 
people. There is a strong resistance, and a healthy one, on 
the part of most Americans, particularly the average American 
male, toward being "cultivated". This represents a profound 
suspicion on his part of European ways, highbrow talk, 
"long-hair" music and poetry. To make these people feel that 
they are interested to defend all democratic culture and to 
keep potentially Facist forces in American from realizing on 
the culture resentment described above, they must be approached 
on their own terms and I profoundly believe these 
terms are ultimately better known to the folklorist than to 
any one else in the nation. 

7. As I pointed out above, the whole basis of folk-lore is democratic 
and the people know this instinctively. Besides, 
however, all of the material worth considering in American 
folk-lore treats in one way and another of democratic feelings, 
yearnings, strivings, struggles which have always been part 
of the lives of all people. The people have developed a language 
for telling the story of democracy which is beyond the 
reach of pamphleteers and propagandists. Let the people feel 
that they are telling themselves that democracy is worth defending 
and building and making their own. Don't tell the 
people that democracy has brought them this or that and that 
democracy represents this or that high ideal invented by philosophers
and worked out by technicians with large language. 
Let the people tell their own story to themselves in their 
own way. This should be the basis, the leaning of any cultural 
progress at this time.
