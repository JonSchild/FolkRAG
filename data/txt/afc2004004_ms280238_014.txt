Lomax: You didn't mind, though, too much?
Cox: No, I ...
Lomax: You enjoyed it, didn't you?
Cox: I like...I like when you're in company, for others to have a
go sometime, you know.  I hate to always keep on one
always on me - 'cause nobody didn't know nothin'
(laughs) That might be so.  They knew I did know a lot of songs,
though I never...
Lomax: And your father was a great singer before?
Cox: Ah, he'd sing all night.
Lomax: Do you suppose he knew more songs than you do?
Cox: Yes.
Lomax: Tell me a bit about your father.  What was he like? What'd
he look like? What kind of a man was he?
Cox: Short, an' thick, strong, very tough sort of a kid he'd been.
He'd been a sort of a fightin' man in his time.  He'd been through
(laughs) Gunnin' - poacher.
Old hares an' things.  He'd been through all that.  He'd do anything
he weren't afraid of anything.  He used to go out after old hares
of a night at Barton.  Barton porch, church porch, that's when he'd
get two or three old hares, and he weren't far away.  He used to go
and lie 'em in there, and there wasn't one out o' ten o' 'em durst
go in there o' a night.  He wasn't like that.
He used to leave his old hares in there till he come back.  He'd
say, "Nobody'll touch them.  They're frightened with the churchyard.
He shot many a hare in there.  Barton churchyard, of a night.  And
these others wouldn't go there.  (laughs) They dursn't go in.
