Dear Mr. Reynolds,
In 1937 my wife and I made 300 disc recordings
of about a thousand musical items in
Haiti-- vaudou, mardi gras, etc..Harold Courlander
(to be reched through Columbia University),
Melville Herskovitz (of Northwestern Univ.) have
also taken records there. I was helped materially
by Dr. Roulx-Leon of the Department of Hygiene
and by Dr. Reiser of the same department. I suggest
that you look at Haitian Valley by Melville
Herskovitz, Haiti Singing by Harold Courlaner,
and that you consult the writings of Madame
Suzanne Sylvain, eminent Haitian folk-lorist.
It occurs to me that if you plan an
extensive recording trip to the West Indies
that you go where other people have not made
records: SANTO DOMINGO]?], CUBA, Martinique,
St. Kitts, Trinidad, etc. etc..I should like
to hear further about your plans and help
wherever I can.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
