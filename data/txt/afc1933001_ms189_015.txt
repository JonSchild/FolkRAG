Dear Mr. Boatright:

I very greatly enjoyed reading the thesis on Czech
folk lore in Texas. Would you mind if I kept it a little
longer as I want Mrs. Jakobson, a Czech musicologist, and a
temporary member of my staff, to look it over for what it can
suggest to her about wartime work in this country.

I agree with you that the work should be published 
and it might be that Mrs. Jakobson could be of some help in
this regard.

Sincerely yours,
