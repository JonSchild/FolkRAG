CATFISH STORY.

STAN HICKS
I guess I told you about my catfish, didn't I, one time?
LOMAX
No you didn't, never heard about that.
STAN HICKS
. . .well, I'll tell you about it.  When I went to school,
back in the old days, you know, I went, and dad didn't
want us to go fishing much, but I slipped off, and went to
the river.   You probably crossed it coming on.  And I
caught this fish, [and got] throwed him out on the bank, and I'd 
caught a catfish, 'bout that long.   Layed him out onthe
bank, and he goes cuckuk, cuckuk, cucku, laying there
y'know.  So got him an' took him on home, an' I'd put it
in water a while, an' then I'd take it out.  I got it
where it didn't want to stay in water.  You know.  And
I'd put me a little string around its neck, and he'd go
along behind me to school, you know cuckukoo, cuckukoo,
leadin' it to school.
LOMAX
Talkin' catfish, huh?
STAN HICKS
. . .yeah, and it hit would uh . . . .they'd broke a boulder out
on the bridge, you know, where the road went across, all
the steers and stuff, and I went across this bridge going
to school, 'n my string got loose.  You know.  An' I went
back to see what happened to my catfish, 'n d'y'know what
had happened?
