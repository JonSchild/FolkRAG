Dear Mr. Brewster:

I believe that the texts of the "Two Sisters"
which we have in the Archive will not show 
important differences from those you have already 
assembled. There are, however, one or two folk 
tale versions of the story from the West Indies 
that may be of interest to you. 

The difficulty here is that the texts of 
these stories have not yet been transcribed from 
the records, but if you believe that this material 
will be useful to you, let me know and I shall 
attempt within the next few months to have it 
transcribed. I can make no promises about this.

With very best wishes for the success of your 
project, I am

Sincerely yours,

AL a
