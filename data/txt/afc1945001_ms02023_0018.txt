October 9, 1942 

State: Florida    City: Jacksonville   Reported by: General Observation 
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed:  Jacksonville 

Rumor:  Some weeks ago when the Duval County Defense Council arranged a series 
of test blackouts, rumor was strongly current that the tests were made 
in order to hide the movement into Jacksonville of 56,000 troops from 
Camp Blanding and their embarkation here for overseas.  

On the night of October 8th another test of approximately one hour 
duration was held at about 8:00 p.m., and the troop movement question 
again has appeared not as a statement of fact but in the form of a 
question, "I wonder if they are moving troops again?", or as a comment, 
"They must be carrying out some more troop movements".
