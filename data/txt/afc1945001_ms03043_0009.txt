Smithfield, North Carolina                                      August 13, 1942

The Chief of Police in this City stated that there was a rumor going around that one C.  J.  Brownage had purchased a farm near Fremont, North Carolina and when buying the farm he paid cash for it.  The farm is known as the Guy Rose place near Fremont, North Carolina.  Brownage contends he is a former orchestra leader and that he left Miami, Florida because he was afraid it would be bombed.

He said that he heard that the shipyard was
