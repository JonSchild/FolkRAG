I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN EIGHTEEN AND FIVE

One early Monday  morning in eighteen hundred and five
I thought myself quite lucky to find myself alive.
I harnessed up my horses my business to pursue
I went to hauling wood as I used for to do.

The ale house it was open and the liquor it was free
When one glass was empty, and another filled for me
I only hauled one load in the room of hauling four,
I got so drunk at Lower Town I couldn't haul no more.

I put the saddle on me back and started for the barn
I saddled up Old Grey, not thinking any harm,
I saddled Old Grey and rode away so still
I scarcely drew my breath until I came to Stony Hill.

I met an old companion, his name I dare not tell,
He told me when and where there was going to be a ball,
I was hard to be persuaded but at last we did agree,
To go to the pot where the fiddler was to be.

Then both of us Green Mountain boys got on the floor to dance,
All in a hurry on the fiddler we did advance,
The fiddler being so willing and his arm being so strong
Played the reels of old Ireland for four hours long.

Now the night is well spent and we have danced enough,
We'll spend a half an hour in gathering cash for cuff,
We'll go home to our plowing, we'll whistle and we'll sing,
We never will be caught in such a drunken scrape again.

I learned this song from Steve Divine thirty-five years ago; the
man came from Rochester, New York.
