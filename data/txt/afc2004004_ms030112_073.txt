MRS. DAVIS: 
They all thought they understood him. 
LARRY: 
And they thought that you didn't understand. 
MRS. DAVIS: 
They didn't want him to get married to anybody, but that 
still didn't stop him we got married just the same. And I didn't 
get married to him before too long, my two daughters moved to 
New York and ah, they came to N.Y. and they both got jobs, and 
was working and I wanted to come in to New York, and I  left him 
in Raleigh, no I left him Durham, N.C. but I told him I said 
Rev. Davis if everything is going all right, I'll see about 
sending for you. So I think Travelers Aid brought him to New 
York city, and we met him at the train station. 
LARRY: 
When he came in. 
MRS. DAVIS. 
To New York we met him and so, we came on had a life and 
got along fine. Looked like it went from one thing to another 
thing the lord blessed him with. First it was singing on the 
street. 
LARRY: 
In harlem. 
MRS. DAVIS: 
Yeah. 
LARRY: 
That was hard.
