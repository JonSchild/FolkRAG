This War 
This was has gone on long enough 
We got to get behind soldiers & do our stuff
Dont hide behind a mask. 
(???) your stuff and make Hitler fail in his task.
Soldiers are dying, but we will win the fight, 
For we are fighting with all our might. 
I am helping this war, 
What are you doing 
Are you helping to keep the axes moving 
I am working under (???) West 
I am trying to get a "S"
