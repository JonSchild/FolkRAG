Budget
In relation to the Defense Program memo submitted to the Librarian 
on August 29, I should like to summarize the concrete working machinery
which will carry out the program as suggested in the memo. 

1. The Archive of American Folk Song at present has no staff 
and no facilities to embark on such a program. [Personally, I'm involved
in so many projects on so many fronts and I have so little
efficient help, that I can't possibly produse material for the Defense 
Program.] I suggest therefore;

1. That the Archive of American Folk Songs be called the Archive 
of American Folk [Lore] Culture.

2. That funds be found for a director of the Archive at a salary of
$4500.00 a year [and]. The [only] best person in my mind [who can do] for the job is Dr. Seeger, present director of the Music Project in the Library 
of Congress.

[3. The funds be allocated for the employment of a writer at $3500.00
a year, to handle and coordinate the great amount of creative 
writing involved.]

3 [4.] That two permanent stenographers will be required, each a t $1800.00.

4 [5.] That the post of Assistant in Charge of the Archive [of American 
Folk Songs] be created at a salary of $3500.00 a year. 

5 [6.] That the entire staff and energies of the Federal Writers Unit of the L.C. Propect [American Folk song] be turned to the creation of a subject-regional dictionary index of American source materials for creative writing
under Dr. B.A. Botkin. This should not interrupt, but should 
rather facilitate and coordinate the acquisition from state projects
of permanent material. This wing of the Folk Lore Archive
should actively incorporate into the Archive of American Folk Songs
the materials so obtained from the states and should rapidly bring together
the materials that now is in the hands of private individuals
and should incorporate the material in the Archive in photostatic or
mimeograph form. Dr. Botkin to be given the title of Folk Lore 
Editor at the salary of $3500/yr.

6 [7.] That the Folk Music Unit of W.P.A. in the Library of Congress should
devote itself to creating a complete index of published sources of 
American Folk Songs, melodic as well as a textual index. In addition,
this unit can produce arrangements, transcriptions and other
pertinent materials. 

7 [8.] A major [The first] need of the Archive of American Fo[k]lk Songs at present is for sufficient funds to duplicated folk songs on record in other 
collections and to carry out recordings trips in the field, for the
accumulation of additional materials for the Archive. I suggest that
the sum of $10,000.00 be set aside for the forthcoming year.
