children named Monday, Tuesday, etc. and the old witch. It
started this way: Mother, mother, the teakettle's boiling.
--Take the towel -- It's too clean.-- Take the rag -- It's too
dirty. -- Well, go up in the attic and take your best dress.
Daughter goes up and meets the witch, who says: Give me a match

and get some. Daughter -- If you don't spit on the floor and
