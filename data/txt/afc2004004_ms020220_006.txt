near the ferry boat.
AL:  Where those Concajos live down there?
BJ:  Tha's right.  All kinds a nations a peoples, oh boy!
An' ah, them big, giant naked peoples, I call 'em, hah, hah.
Yeah, big, big ol' rusty white Ishlins or sumpin'; I don't
know what they are, but they talk funny, some of 'em.
     An' on this lil' island [that] I went to, ah, this
said there weren't but one colored man there.  At that time,
he had been there 12 years, I mean, or rather, that was stayin'
there.  An' ah, they was a colored boy an' a colored girl workin'
[at] in this factory.  An' they was ah, Vera an' an' ah Charlie.  They 
was husban' an', an' wife, ya know?  An' um, so, we all went
down there.  There was a crowd that went.  Well, a lot of men
went down there, too.  See, they was buildin' this ah, place,
makin' [Cape Salmon (Kaksamon ?)] Kagsamon an' Marco meet.  Kaksamon's on
one end of the island an' Marco's on the other.  Which the
island is not but ah, about 6 mile long, very small place, see?
An' ah, they was makin' it meet, ya know?
     An' [ah] those those mens was there -- a lot of those mens that
was cuttin' out circles, ya know, makin' [the] this -- You know, streets,
markin' it off, ya know, jus' makin' the town to -- street it off
an' clean it up to make this town meet.  So I, I never got back
there to see had it built, how much is built, but it must be 
pretty well.  I sees in the papers now where there's lots an'
things to be sold there.  Down there, ya can buy 'em anywhere.
AL:  How long did you stay?
BJ:  Ah, we stayed [up] in there around three months.  I did.
Until the time...
AL:  What happened?
