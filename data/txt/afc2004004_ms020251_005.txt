JOSEPHINE
In this little play, all stand in a line and one stands facing
the line.  When the one calls on one in the line, it means all
because you call all one name, Josephine.  When this is done,
all the girls answer.  Thus, the one facing the line says:
Josephine?
All the girls:
Ma'm?
The leader:
Josephine?
All the girls:
Ma'm!
The leader:
You wanna shout?
All the girls:
Yes, ma'm.
The leader: 
When?
All the girls:
Right now.
The leader:
Shout, Josephine,
Shout, shout!
Shout, Josephine,
Shout!
I've got a ball of cord,
All the girls:  Shout!
The leader:  I've got a ball of cord,
All the girls:  Shout!
The leader:  I've got a pain in my head, etc.
I've got a pain in my back, etc.
I've got a finger ring, etc.
