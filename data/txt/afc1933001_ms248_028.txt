NEW YORK HERAL TRIBUNE- Dec. 28, 1941 ----(Lewis Gannett)
(Our Singing Country)

For Lovers of America's Poetry, Song and Soil

Our Singing Country. A second volume of American Ballads and
Folk Songs. Collected and compiled by John A. Lomax and Alan
Lomax. Ruth Crawford Seeger, music editor, New York. The Macmillan
Company, 1941.  $5.

The real McCoy again from John Lomax, the man who discovered cowboy
songs some thirty-five years ago.  This stuff is from all over the
U.S.A.  The poetry is superb, the music, virtually all of it, previously
unpublished.  The musical notation is impeccable.  The scholarly
apparatus is complete.  The literary presentation of each number is
a gem.  Among living American folklorists there are only two, to my
knowledge, who make the kind of sense, George Pullen Jackson and
John A. Lomax.  Gusto without romanticism, learning without obfuscation
and a great and humane comprehension of our non-intellectualized
musical tradition are their qualities.  A profoundly exciting book
that cuts deep into America and into music.
