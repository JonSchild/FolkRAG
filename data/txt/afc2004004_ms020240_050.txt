[*LIVING CONDITIONS IN FLA. (OKEECHOBEE AREA) "HOOVER DAYS"*]

AL:  In a place like Miami in those days, or say, out on the
muck, how did the people feel about the places they lived in?
The kind of houses and conditions they lived in, which were so
different from the conditions that the white people lived in?
Didn't they resent it?
BJ:  The white folks ain't lived in too much better houses at that
time, 'cause [they] wasn't much then.  Most of 'em what had the
real plantations an' owned the plantations, they stayed in towns
an' places.  They had them lil' foremens an', know, them ah, folks
from up around Georgia an' back in the backwoods a the countries right
[ah] around there, to come an' be they fo'mans.  You see?  That's
most of it.  They come an' see about it an' like that.  They,
they didn't stay in too much better houses around -- Not
around Cannell (Canal) Point an' around, ah, Sandcut
an' over on that side.
AL:  What about Miami?  Oh, my God, the slums there...
BJ:  Oh, yeah, oh well, Miami had slums for a time.  Oh, yeah.  For
a long time.  But it's so much better now it's pitiful.  Yeah.
Slums there for a time.  Now on, on the Lake at that time, it was
just that, for everyone, whosoever will.  But now it's beau-
tiful, most beautiful.  Yeah, Laws.  The place where I, ah, stayed
at, ya can't hardly tell it.  Don't know [what is there] where it's at.  Places
I picked beans at?  They got big proje's (projects) there, some of 'em,
in the places.  Grass so green?  An' got somebody to take care a
the proje's.  An' they got -- you know -- every day.  An' they got
-- an' plant flowers.  An' got somebody ta, you know, care for all
[their gardens, care for] garbage, keep up all their trash out it.  It's really pretty!
There, an', also...They has a great big place there, ah, at,
Cheehoken, an' also Belle Glade, an' ah, they say they got one up
