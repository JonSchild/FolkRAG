Feb 18th London #

Walks through Macroon early 
morning - waiting for Seamus till 12
noon.  Mahan being important as
usual.  Up hill along a line
of white cottages, some rotting in
the damp, others with red doors,
blue doors & shutters, [?] in the
ways, a great stout woman
in the black hooded cape of the
region strides past me, looks back
in some wonder & scorn & disappears
into a house.

Robin & I had two little rooms
across the corridor at the end
of the house.  Then I was still
sometimes happy in the feeling which
has since turned bitter through too
much denial.

West of Macroon # the ridged land of
turf & grass
