John A. Lomax, Esq.
1618 Avenue Y
Lubbock, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter to Mr, Engel dated November
29 was not received until December 7.
I am enclosing the envelope and you will
see by that, that the delay was caused by
lack of postage when sent from New York.
I hope you and Allan are having a
pleasant trip and nice weather.

Very truly yours,

Secretary, Coolidge Foundation
