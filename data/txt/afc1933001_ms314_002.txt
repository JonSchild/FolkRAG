ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH BALLADS.

AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP IN AN IMPORTANT WORK.
Whatever has at any time appealed to the best emotions and moved
the heart of a people must have for their children and their children's
children political, historical, and cultural value. This is especially
true of folk tales and folk songs.
The English and Scottish popular ballads given in the following
lists helped to mold the character of the men and women who made
up the larger part of the Colonial population of the country. For
generations these ballads of the lowlands and highlands of England
and Scotland were sung along the Atlantic coast and in the valleys
of the Appalachian Mountains. The descendants of English, Irish,
and Scotch-Irish colonists took many of them with them on their
march across the continent, and the ballads were familiar in childhood
to millions of men and women whose children have never heard
them. Before the march of the public school, the public library, urban
civilization, and modern industrial and commercial life, they have
vanished like the fresh, cool mists of the morning before the heat of
the sun, but they still have their value, and we should not permit them
to be lost out of our life. The Nation will be the poorer if we do.
The Bureau of Education, therefore, welcomes the cooperation of
Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, Edgar Allan Poe professor of English in
the University of Virginia and founder and president of the Virginia
Folk Lore Society, in collecting the American survivals of these ballads.
The first step in this process is, as set forth by Dr. Smith in the
following statement, to determine where any of these ballads or their
variations are now to be found among the people.
May I therefore ask every person into whose hands a copy of this
statement comes to read it carefully and then to fill out the inclosed

Alan: Please return this pamphlet. I have
a big stack of Child [B????] in Ms. Joh.
