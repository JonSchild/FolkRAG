that is one period [that] when a student 
should not take on outside 
and disturbing occupations. In 
itself the job is quite big 
enough. Why can't you, 
now that you are involved 
with her, use her on some 
other program? Or shift the 
programs? I'll agree for 
her to [con] help you later
for one time. After that please leave
her to drift along her way 
through Bryn Mawr. She 
has seemed happy and contented 
and in no danger of 
losing her health from over-study,
a situation most satisfying 
to me.

I know that you
