I am sending this note to you because the 
question has arisen as to just how widely the rumors 
to which newspapers and radio give so much space and 
time are believed by the general public.  It may be 
that the public is disinclined to accept such rumors 
as reporting the true state of affairs. An earlier 
analysis of some of the Gallup results, however, indicates 
that people tend to believe what they see in 
their own newspapers and hear over their radio, 
even though they say the disbelieve news items of 
foreign origin. To be sure that our problem is not 
fictitious, would you consider it inadvisable to 
ascertain through one or several of your surveys the 
extent to which these rumors are believed? If questions 
relating to this matter were repeated, trendlines 
could be drawn and some more active and definite 
steps taken to combat the effect which the rumors are 
intended to produce.
Of course this matter has probably already 
been brought to your attention, and you may even be 
planning to do something about it.  If this is true, 
please accept this note simply as expressing our 
concern and our interest in whatever your investigations 
disclose.
Cordially yours,
Kenneth H. Baker
