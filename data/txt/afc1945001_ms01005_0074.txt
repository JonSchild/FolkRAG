                      Summary of Criticism

       As compared with other collections and analyses of rumors this
study by means of intensive interview has certain advantages.
It determines the number of rumors know to each person. It begins
to yield an understanding of the effect of the rumor, the proportion of
rumor believed, the roles of prejudice, information, tension, and social 
participation.

       Form the investigational point of view the study is well planned,
and the results informative.

      Its chief weakness lies in the complete lack of relation between
the study and the vital problem of rumor control. It leaves the translation
of findings into action programs to others who have not the 
experience or insight that the interviewers have not acquired, and the
report does nothing to help those entrusted with rumor control.

      I recommend that no more studies of this type be conducted until
the machinery of rumorcontrol is sufficiently organized to dictate 
the nature of the investigation, the classification of results, and the
method of report.

      I recommend further that Special Report 21 be compared with
R. H. Knapp's report on rumors having national currency (Sept.1-15).
The latter is a much less expensive study, more superficial, but equally
practical.
