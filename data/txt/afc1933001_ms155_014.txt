problem from an entirely different angle. 
           What I really hope to do, Mr. Lomax, is do for American folklore what Audubon did for American birds.  In short, I mean to make a number of fine illustrations of folk heroes.  These drawings will not accompany the text, the text will accompany the drawings.  Drawings in color.  
           This is not my first venture in the field. 
           From 1933 to 1935, for the Department of Agriculture, I carved a series of eight panels in plaster, and enamelled them in red yellow blue white black green orange brown and gold and silver.  Henry Wallace the Secretary of Agriculture, sponsored the project personally for eight months.  I mean when they PWAP was about to dismiss me after six months work, Mr. Wallace had Arthur Goldschmidt continue me under another project so that I might complete my scale models.  For Henry Wallace wanted my relief panels to be placed permanently on the facade of the South Administration building of the Department.  The project was submitted twice for the approval of the Fine Arts Commission.  The Fine Arts Commission rejected my work, saying it was "too instinctively American to be placed in Washington", because it did not harmonize with the Grecian and Colonial architecture of Washington.  Those scale models are now in the John Eaton Grammar School lobby, at 34th and Macomb streets, N.W., Washington.  If you possibly could, I wish you would go some morning out there and look at them.  There you will find: Paul Bunyan, (reproduced in ESQUIRE, September 1935), Davy Crockett, Casey Jones, John Henry, Uncle Remus, Mark Twain, an old Circuit Riding Preacher and Springfield Mounting, the song. 
                The St. Louis POST-DISPATCH gave the project a front page spread in their Sunday magazine in February, 1935.  They reproduced in color, the Paul Bunyan, the Crockett, Mark Twain, Uncle Remis and Casey Jones.
                Those reliefs were exhibited in the Phillips Memorial Gallery, the Corcoran and the Smithsonian. 
                Since then, I have carved a series of six reliefs in sugar pine on early athletics in America for the Washington Playground Department under the WPA.  I painted a mural on folklore in a private home in New York, I painted a mural on the evolution of a daily paper for the editorial room of the Mobile PRESS-REGISTERED, and I painted for myself a mural forty feet long and seven feet high, each panel 3'x7'.  These are the same figures that are in the lobby of the Eaton school, only in my portable mural, they are done in the scale that would have been carried out had the Fine Arts Commission not rejected them. 
                 I want to make a series of illustrations, portraits based in authentic material on all the great heroes of American legend.  Naturally, I'll have to find people who can tell me about them. That is why I am writing you. 
                Would it be requesting too much if I asked you if you could help me find two things?  First, a list of as many legend-heroes as are known to America, I mean American heroes entirely.  Second, a list of people on whom to call and to whom I might write for authentication , costume, etc.
