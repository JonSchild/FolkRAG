"Rumor Clinic" by Capt. Murray E. Wyche, post public relations officer.
At the same time, Mr. Salmon announced that the "clinic" had been
assured that no saboteurs have been arrested at the Columbia army air
base, and that none have shot. 
Concerning unfounded rumors that Fort Jackson is to be made an
all-Negro post, Captain Wyche wrote Mr. Salmon 
"I can truthfully say that the rumor that only Negro troops will
be stationed at Fort Jackson is just another rumor. Absurd as it is,
it has gained considerable foothold in Columbia, and no doubt it has 
had damaging effects."
