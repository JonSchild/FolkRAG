Dear Sir:
Some time ago my father, John A. Lomax, made recordings
of the songs of three of the inmates of
Cummins State Farm, Kelly Page, Arthur Bell and Irvin
Lowry. The Archive of American Folk Song would like
to use these records in a group of American folk songs
we are preparing to distribute in Latin America. Before
we can do so, however, it is necessary that we
have the permission of the performers. We would appreciate
it very much, therefore, if you would locate
these three men and forward the enclosed letters
to them.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
