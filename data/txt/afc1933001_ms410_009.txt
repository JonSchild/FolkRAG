Mr. John A. Lomax,
c/o/ Library of Congress,
Division of Music,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very glad to hear from you again per your letter of July
7th, regarding your revised and enlarged editions of your book,
"Cowboy Songs And Other Frontier Ballads".

We are happy to grant you permission to reproduce in the above
mentioned book the songs:

"BURY ME NOT ON THE PRAIRIE"
"THE COWBOY"
"GREAT GRANDAD"

I infer that you are going to use only the words or words and
music, as they appear in our book, "The Cowboy Sings", and
not the musical arrangements.

I am glad to have your friendly words about our meeting at the
Music Round Table, which I recall very pleasantly.  You may
remember that I urged that you and your son give lecture recitals
on the subject matter of your more recent book, which I believe
would be a real platform attraction.

With good wishes and friendly regards,

Cordially yours,
Kenneth S. Clarke
