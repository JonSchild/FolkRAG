This rumor was reported to me by a gentleman who first
heard it in Florida last March, later in Chicago and recently
in Indianapolis:
"There is an arrangement between the United States and
Britain to allow Russia to take the brunt of the war in order
to kill off Communism. The U.S. and Britain want Germany and
Russia to kill off each other." [*7*]
