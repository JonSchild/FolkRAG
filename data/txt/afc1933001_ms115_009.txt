until he was forced into the first trouble 
sent to prison for a long term which caused 
much grief to his parents.  His father 
passed before he was freed, but the dear 
mother lived to see him home and shouted 
Victory.  He sang and played before the governor
and sang his way out.  So you see that caused 
the young whites to pick at him.  Still standing 
up for the right trying to defend himself 
to get the banner they kepted on until they
sent him back.  This grieved the mother so 
she passed before he was free the second 
time, but their prayers left behind went out 
and caused God to send you and your father 
to the aide of the poor colored people that 
wanted to be helped.  I am glad to speak on 
the life of this faitful hard working boy
who made himself what he is today 
with the aid of your people and the determining 
will of Hudie. With God in the 
plan we are glad for him  may he continue
to be loyal and true. From Mother 
and Arthur Mae.
