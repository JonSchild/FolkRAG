TAPE:  R#4, Appalachia 10

Caz:   Drink liquor. . . . 2, 3 drinks a day won't hurt you.  It ain't
what goes in you that hurts you, it's what comes out.

AL:   How munch liquor would an old time mountain lady consume in
a day?

Ray:   I'd say a pint, the average I'd say, wouldn't you say, Caz?
About a pint.   Four or five good drinks in a pint.   See, they
took drinks, they didn't play with it.

Caz:  They used. . . .  they didn't have no pint bottles back then.

Ray:  Most of the time, nobody never knew that they drunk it.
They kept it sitting and when they got their work, they just go
in and take a drink, nobody ever noticed.

AL:   Now when you say you couldn't handle it. . . tell me about
that.

Ray:  Well, I'm an alcoholic. . . .when I drunk, half a gallon a day,
for fifteen years.

AL:   Well, that'd kill a horse, to drink half a gallon a day.

Ray:   Well, I was a pretty good horse, and it like to get me.
But I ain't drinking it no more, not in nine and a half year, not even
a beer.  Be nine and a half year the 7th.  Today's the 4th,
three more days make nine and a half year.  I take it a day at
a time. 

AL   What do you mean by that?

Ray:   Well, I can tell you I ain't gonna drink nothing today, but
I don't know about tomorrow.   I don't want to get too far ahead
