have to do it either.   It's jus' in your mind; you're just weak.
The devil caught you at this crossroad, as I former said, an' so
that's it.   They just' went on into that.

AL:     And you think that's very much [wicked that a] more wicked [thing] than...
BJ:      I think that's [an] utterly wicked trick!
AL:     ...Than two people of different sexes goin' together...
BJ:     Oh, no. I...
AL:     ...even if they're not married?
BJ:      Yeah, goodness!   That's worser 'cause that ain' -- God ain' --
You know I don't see where the Book written no license nowhere
in the Bible.   Ha, you see?   So, an' He say, "Go an' replenish
the earth."  [And] That what he tol' the people to do, see?   Ha,
that what He did; an' after all, he did say marry, but not, not,
he didn't say 'bout no license to marry, see?   There's only one
way to marry, see?   There ain't, there ain't but one way to
marry, however.   And that is in love.   See? He said, "Who
I put together, let no man put asunder."   You can marry a thousand
times, as many times as you want to.   You see?  But if God ain't
put you together, it jus' ain't there.   'Co'se He don't say
(there ain't no help (Heaven) for it?).   For that.   You can be forgiven fo' your sins,
[yourself] also.   But you ain't, you ain't married, you see? Because,
see, He don't care anything about that; I'm tellin' ya the
whole truth.   You know, some folks say you shouldn't say it, but
I know it's right.   The Bible right -- He don't care anything
about it because He say in Heaven there ain't no marriages there
an' no givin' in marriage.   Ya see?   An' you get there, you
ain't got no wife.   An' you ain't got no husband.   I ain't got
nary'n.   My husband's gone on.   Heaven or hell, wherever I meet
him at, you got to meet him as a sister an' a brother.   See?
