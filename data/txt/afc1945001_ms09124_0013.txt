out for Mihailivich. They go through the mountains looking for him, but a very funny thing happens. They fail to come back. The Nazi murderers have even gone so far as to arrest Mihailovich's family as a sort of ransom for him.
         But this does not stop the great general. Instead, it fills him with a stronger determination than ever to stop the Nazis. Mihailovich and his band of Chetniks have done much to hinder the Nazi Army by capturing their men in the mountains, blowing up Nazi troop trains, or anything else they can do to help.  We should all take our hats off to "the Chetniks!"
