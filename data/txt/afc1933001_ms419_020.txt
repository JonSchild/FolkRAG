AVIONS

1. Here they come
Here they come
See those Fascist avions,
They'll be dropping their eggs all around.

2. Hit the dirt
Drop you squirt
Or you're liable to get hurt
Oh! Abaho, you lunt, get down.

3. So get down Joe
They're flying might(y) low.
The bombs whine and whistle as they drop down near us,
(Churus) Broommmm, Broommmm, Bro(o)mmmm.

4. Safe at last, Christ I thought
they clipped my carkass
(Chorus) Where the Hell's our Avion?

5. Here they come
Here they come
Now its our own Avion and the fascists
will have to get down.

6. In and out
All about
Hear those Fascist bastards shout
As we blow them all over the town.

7. So its charge that gun
They've left it at a run
Our Avion has frightened them away.
(Chorus) Broommmm, Broommmm, Bro(o)mmm(m).

8. We got their town
Got their ground and the trenches all around
(Chorus) So its three cheers for our Avion.
