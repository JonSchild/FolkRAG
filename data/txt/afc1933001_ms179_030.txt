Dear Miss Muller:

I think it would be possible to pick out twelve of the recordings
for you and at the same time give you a fairly representative idea
of the collection.  Our charge (subject to change without notice because
of the unstable condition of material prices) is $1.85 per
record and our practice is that a check, made payable to the Library
of Congress, be sent in advance before the duplicates are actually made.

We have a collection of 39 records of considerable musical interest,
not all of them pure folk song by any means, from Brazil, Argentina,
Chile and Peru.  A group of these recordings might be of use to you.
During this fiscal year, recordings are being made for us in Columbia
and Brazil and this material, I am sure, will be of great value.  Our
North American Indian collection is quite small so far and includes a
fine group of records from the Iroquois of northern New York State, a
group of Seminole songs from Florida and some material from the Northwest
transcribed from dictaphone cylinders.  I suppose the last records
will not be useful for demonstration purposes.  If you would like me
to look further into the matter of duplication of either Indian or
South American records, I shall be glad to do so.

Is it true that the American Museum has a collection of records of
primitive song and folk song and is constantly adding to this collection?
I should be greatly pleased to know something about what
you have and what your current recording activities are.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
