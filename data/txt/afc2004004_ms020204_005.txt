choir. 
V: Certainly did.
A: Did they sing from books?
V: They sung outa books. . The old Gospel Pearls, our songbook 
was the first songbook I can remember they had up there.
A: Did that have music in it as well as the world.
V: they did. They had a girl there that played the-- we had 
an organ-- we didn't have a piano-- She played the organ up t[he] 
there practically all the time and they sing the songs in the 
book.
A: They hymns. Or they mostly like spirituals.
V: They--they went kinda like spirituals, I bleeve, cause a 
hymn you had to word it out and then sing it, but they 
just go right on to sing it. Just like they turn to a page and 
see what page they gon sing and they just go right on sing 
it. They didn't word that out so it must have been a like a 
spiritual. It's been a long time ago, but that's as much as I 
can...
A: YOU remember any of the names of the songs in that book?
V: Let's see...I'll Be Walking Down the Streets of Gold, With 
My Brother Many Things Behold--- but I done forgot the start 
in on that...
(She begins to sing...
I'll be walkin down the streets of gold,
With my brother many things behold,
O brother, I'll be glad to meet you
And to take you by the hand
I'll be walking down the streets of gold...

That's not the first verse of it. That's way down in 
it...We sung that and then we sung, Lordy, Lordy---(550)
