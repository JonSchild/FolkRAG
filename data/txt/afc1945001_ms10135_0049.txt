3. A group of people were talking 
some time ago and in their discussion
they brought in the war situation. 
One old man said: All I can hear 
is Buy War Bonds and Stamps. I 
am not going to spend my money
buying anything to help win the 
war because the White man is 
not going to treat me any better 
after it is over. 
4. Some young lads were discussing 
the war and they were only interested 
because they had a relation in the
army. One girl said to the others. 
They can send all of the boys that
are in the Army across the water as
long as they leave my brother over this
side. 
5. Let the Japs get em, is a statement
I heard from a man one day.
