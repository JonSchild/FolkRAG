Dear Mr. Lomax:

It seems that you have overlooked the account of
Dr. T. J. Abernathy.
Please make a special effort and send us the $5.00
balance, so that we can clear our credit files, and
give a good, favorable report of your medical and
dental credit when requested.
                     Very truly yours,
                                MEDICAL CREDIT ASSOCIATION
