Memorandum to Dr. Spivacke
In Re:  Duplicate Recording for B.B.C.

After having discussed the matter thoroughly with
Mr. Cooke, I can find no objections to the Archive
furnishing him with duplicate recordings for his 
projected broadcasts on American music.

Mr. Cooke astonished me by his grasp of the field 
of American popular music and I feel that the material
will be properly handled by him.

The records, themselves, are unrestricted so far
as I know, with the possible exception of those 
recorded by Mollie Jackson; and Mr. Cooke plans 
to call on her in New York and ask her permission 
to use these recordings before he has them recorded.
