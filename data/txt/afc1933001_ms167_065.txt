Memorandum to Harold Spivacke

Mr. Heindel informs me that Mr. Vail mentioned in his memorandum
has contact with one of the last-surviving Shaker groups. I think
it might be a very good idea to send Jerry up this spring with a good
recording machine or with the sound film apparatus which he has said 
he might be able to borrow, to record this music. If you think that
this project is worth carrying further, let me know.
