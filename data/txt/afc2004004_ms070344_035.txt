Seamus was way behind in Ken[?], catching up on his
driving, and phoned he would be along.  We all
made a date to meet at Column Keane's that night
Monday - in Carna.

To Galway from Limerick - then
on in the rain to Carna on the
sea. Pas & through dolomite
& acres of rock fences.  The wettest
country in the world [?] into
the sea were it not for the rock
fences - high as a man's shoulders
so that the builders couldn't
get out.  Grey rocks, sky, sea, 
houses & donkeys & thru some
houses painted sky blue. 
Black boats grace[?] as [?]
girl buried in a brown peat 
pile.  Boys standing in the rain
talking the afternoon out
against a wall - the memory
of boredom at 12 to 14 & 
the wonder of not  knowing who
was the leader, who was the most
boring.  White swans on the cold
grey water.  The rock fenced area
