Dear Allan,

I am in the throes of the Independence 
Celebrations and fully entrenched with the Carnival, 
Calypso and Steelband Exhibition. 

From all accounts the show is very good. 
I mailed you contracts from Blanchisseuse and Laventille 
last week as soon as I got them back. Diego Martin is 
making up its mind.

As you instructed one was sent to Jamaica to 
Dr. Sherlock and the other to your New York address.

All the best respects to Tony.

Sincerely yours,
J.D. Elder.
