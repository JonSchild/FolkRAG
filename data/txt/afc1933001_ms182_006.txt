Dear Alan:

The twelve-inch record of "Pretty Polly" was released on September
16, 1927. The fact that its master has been destroyed I know will
cause you to go into mourning.

It will also surprise you to know that now that the Government has
restricted the use of shellac, my recording work is washed out for
the time being and I am now over in our Purchasing Department getting
trained to buy things with which to win the war.

Yours for Victory,
Bob
