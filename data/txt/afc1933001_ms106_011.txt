Dear Mother;
I have had the lovliest Easter!
Saturday I [diyell] dyed twelve eggs
with Paas dyes. I d[r]yed two
red, two blue and so on. I've
gotten all your Easter things
and Katy May gave me a
basket of easter eggs too. But
the crowning glory was something
dear old Alan sent me. It
looks like a row of books with
a book on the top and bottom.
Here is a picture of it.
