(over) the National Folk Festival - April 25 -27 is sponsored by the Washington Post. I'm wondering if a paragraph reviewing the new green mountain songs ter - just when the city has many people in teres ted [interested]  in this lore - would not be very timely.

You once spoke of reviewing it yourself /or the Post - nothing has come of my proposal to the Saturday Review of Literature.

If you are too busy to write a bit for the Post, setting the book before its
"converging - on - Washington" public, would you care to speak of it to someone who would review it?
