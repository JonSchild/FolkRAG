via Toronto to Niagara
Falls, Canada. We should 
be there by Sept 2 or 3.
Our further movements
depend - though I
hope we can go on back
to Texas. Mr. Wetherall's
letter would have deserved
no reply except 
for your intercession in
that of Harold, who wrote
me at some length.

I've not been feeling
so well, but am better
today. Weather delightful.
Glad you enjoy your
home. Acquire a regular
one of your own as
soon as you can.
Lovingly, Father-
