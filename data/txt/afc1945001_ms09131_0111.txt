[*SENIOR - WHITE - MALE*]

1. The story of Dr. M.L. Pratt, a Lieut-Commander in the Marine
 Corps Medical Reserve, who was treating the wounds of a badly 
injured Jap prisoner in the Solomons. After Dr. Pratt had
 treated the wounds, the Jap turned around and stabbed Dr. Pratt
 to death in the back. I have heard that this story
 is related to Marines before they go overseas to intensify 
their hate of the Japs. Dr. Pratt was the father of a good
 friend of mine, a Marine who was killed in action in 
Guadicanal.

2. The slogan of the Naval Reservists on merchant ship gun 
crews - "Ready - Aim - Abandon Ship!"

3. Another slogan for the same group "Sighted Sub- - Blub, Blub, Blub"

4. Gas rationing - complete "A" card books are available in 
Detroit black markets for $100 per book.
