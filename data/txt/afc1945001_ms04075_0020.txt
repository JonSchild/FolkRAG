In a conversation between some women the subject was the labor 
situation--high wages paid, and high dues paid to labor unions. 
One of the women was blaming the president of the United States 
for allowing the labor leaders to control the output of war 
material, and said if he would let Ex-ambassador Leahy take 
control of Labor he would soon straighten out the wrangle in 
wages, hours, and Labor Directors. He offered him that job 
two years ago but refused to give it to him because Leahy said 
he would lower the wage scale and lengthen the working hours.
