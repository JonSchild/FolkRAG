Dear Professor Combs:

Do you remember the summer of nineteen thirty-two when
John A. Lomax and I came through Fort Worth and spent an afternoon
with you while you sang us Ground Hog and some other hill 
ballads? That version of yours, to a Sharp tune, went in the
ballad book and, while this proceedure may have been unutterably
unscientific, at least the song profited considerably.
The project I shall now broach to you is, on the contrary,
rather unutterably scientific.

The Library, as you know, is in earnest now about building
up an Archive of American folk-song. One of its projects will
send me to Eastern Kentucky for a two months survey recording
trip in that area in September and October, and I have hoped
that you would be able to supply me with some valuable letters
of introduction and direct me to some virgin territory and some
inexhaustible singers without which and whom the trip would not
be half so profitable. I shall read your volume over again
carefully before I go, but I have thought that perhaps you could
send me some collectors' information that is not between the
covers of your book. At any rate I should greatly appreciate a
letter from you with whatever advice and suggestion you may give me.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song
