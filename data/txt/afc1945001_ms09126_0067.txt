Anecdotes

I heard this story from a friend of the family's.
A very prominent doctor who lives in our neighborhood
had been buying quite a lot of gasoline
before the rationing went into effect. When asked
by his friends why he did this his only reply
was, "To keep one step ahead of the Government." On
Tuesday night of this week the doctor's house caught
fire while no one was at home. Before the fire
trucks could get there the house was so far
gone that nothing could be done. On Wednesday
morning where only a week ago stood a beautiful
two story house, there were only ashes and gasoline
cans. This only goes to show how being unhonest
and unhelping to the war effort can
eventually be found out.
