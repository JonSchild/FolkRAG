Dear Mr. Lomax
NBC officials in Cincinnati are asking whether you have obtained permission from copyright owners to use ballads, music, etc., which you may include in your broadcast on "American Folk Ballads." I assume you have but will be grateful to have written assurance which I can send them.

Mrs. Minna Breuer, Cincinnati Public Library, will see that you reach the NBC studio from which you will broadcast if yo will write her on receipt of this letter where you will be staying. I will appreciate a copy of the letter for my files.

The time at which NBC will want you Friday, May 31, at the studio is ten-thirty, to allow timing of your script before you go on the air at eleven. If possible, I will be grateful to have you send me a copy of your script in advance.

Cordially yours
(Mrs) Beatrice Sawyer Rossell
