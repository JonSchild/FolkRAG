Report made August 14, 1942

D. Rumors Concerning War Effort
1. Workers at the Navy Yard are loafing on the job. I'll
bet none of the fellows working there do three hours' good work
in an eight hour day. Some of them shoot crap, or play cards, or
just lay down behind a barrel and go to sleep. 
[*7b*]

Philadelphia — 8/4/42. War worker about 21 years of age.

2. Conditions at the Navy Yard are stinko. Nobody knows
what they're supposed to do. They waste and ruin more stuff than
goes into the ships they're supposed to be building. The Navy officers 
there don't give a damn either. All they're concerned about is getting
away from the Yard and up to the Bellevue-Stratford bar to show off 
their uniforms. 
[*7b*]

Philadelphia— 8/5/42. State worker, working out of the Pennsylvania  Department of Labor and Industry.

3.If you want to see waste and guys loafing, just go down 
to the Navy Yard. 
[*7b*]

Philadelphia — 8/3/42. Pipe-fitter. Middle aged. Below average 
intelligence.

4. Talk about waste—this Allenwood Project is the tops!
Why, it's even disgusting to work there, and watch what goes on. That's
not for me. I'm going back to work in the coal mines. If all the 
Government projects are run like this, God help us!
[*7b*]

Kulpmont—8/8/42. Laborer working on Allenwood Project.

5. Stone and Webster and the A.F. of L. Union must have an
agreement. They get fellows in there working on the project, and 
then, after they get their first or second pay and pay  their Union
dues, they get fired. 
[*7a*]

Ashland — 8/8/42. Laborer, Allentood Project. Average intelligence.

6. I've seen them do it at the Mechanicsburg Project, and
now they're doing it up here at Allenwood. They build temporary 
buildings, and then, after they're built only a short time, they 
get the tractors and push them over, throw the lumber on waste
dumps, and burn it.

Ashland — 8/8/42. Truck driver who works on both projects. 23
years old. Irish extraction. Average intelligence.
