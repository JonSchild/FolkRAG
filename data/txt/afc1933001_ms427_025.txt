THE SPINNER
(Germany)

(Page 172 - Folk Songs of Many Peoples, Vol.II.)

Spin, spin, O my darling daughter!
I'll buy shoes for you.
Yes, yes, O my loving mother,
With buckles on, too!

I can't do my spinning;
It hurts every finger;
The pain, the pain,
The pain is so great.

Spin, spin, O my darling daughter!
I'll buy stockings, too,
Yes, yes, O my loving mother,
In a pattern that's new.

I can't do my spinning;
It hurts every finger;
The pain, the pain,
The pain is so great.

Spin, spin, O my darling daughter!
I'll buy gowns beside,
Yes, yes, O my loving mother,
Not too narrow and not too side!

I can't do my spinning;
It hurts every finger;
The pain, the pain,
The pain is so great.

Spin, spin, O my darling daughter!
I'll find you a man,
Yes, yes, O my loving mother,
As fast as you can!

I can't do my spinning;
It hurts every finger;
The pain, the pain,
The pain is so great.


DRINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES
(England)

(Page 37 - Old Favorite Songs)

Drink to me only with thine eyes, and I will pledge with mine,
Or leave a kiss within the cup and I'll not ask for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine,
But might I of Jove's nectar sup
I would not change for thine.
