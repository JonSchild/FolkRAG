for me.   Hah, heh!   When, when he asked Mama 'bout marryin' me,
after the chil' was aspire (?)?   He tell Mama he gonna marry me.
Tol' Mama that was his child, an' he was gonna marry me.  You
know, he would marry me.
         I said to myse'f,  "You won't marry me."  Said to myse'f, you
know.  See?   That was             see 'bout that, don't had no,
no, no mind on no courtin', ya know.   Said to myse'f,  "You'll
never marry..."   But he did.   But, understand, but...And I did,

The girls an' Mama, diffrunt ones, said, "               you got a 
baby an' that's it's father.    An' so marry 'im."   See?  Then
after I got in the house, I was satisfied.  Ya know?  I was jes'
happy as I could be.   I had my husband and my child.   It just
come natural; just come on, [to it] look like, it's supposed to be.   I
never worry about goin' no other place, you know?   Just stay
there an' tend to my house. 
         Just, when I get into a thing, I
can go on an' do it.   But if I ain't into it, it don't make no
diffrunt to me, huh!   Huh, it's jus' like, you know, [as I say,] except
bein' wit' chirrun.   That's all.   [Yourself] Except bein' with chirrun.
Tha's all.   It just don't worry me.
