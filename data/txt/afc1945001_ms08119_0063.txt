A.
 1. I heard a rumor that clothes were to be
rationed and so I told a friend. The
next time I saw this friend, [sh] you
should have seen the new clothes
she had bought, all because of this
rumor.
2. There is another rumor going around that
the beauty shops are going to close the
first of April. There will certainly be
some hard looking women around then.
