Subject:      Rumor Project Number 2.


Attached is a general statement concerning rumor
and rumor reporting which can serve as a guide for future
studies. Also attached is a specific project which I
should like to suggest for execution through BPI. As you
will notice, it does not require much time on the part
of the fieldmen. The chief thing they have to do is to
line up six people who would collect the material for
them.
