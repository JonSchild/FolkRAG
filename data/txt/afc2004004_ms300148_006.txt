Mr. Spence Moore,
Route 2,
Chilhowie, Va.

Dear Spence,
As I wrote you some weeks ago, I have been working
at selling the recordings I made last summer. So far I
have sold a series of albums to Atlantic Records, and in
this series I would like to use your song, "Jimmy Sutton."
This song will be copyrighted in your name, and you will
be sent publisher's contracts, and will receive royalties as
composer of it. Also, you will be paid your proportion of
royalties for your singing on the record. This is all
covered in the letter of contract enclosed. Also, the letter
gives me formal permission to find a market for the rest
of your recordings if I can.
I hope you will find this letter acceptable, and will
sign and return the enclosed letter of contract ( return two
to me and keep one for yourself) as soon as you can so that
the publication of the first records can move right ahead.
Happy and prosperous New Year to you
Best wishes,
Alan Lomax.
P.S. For the use of "Jimmy Sutton" on the first album
I can pay you an advance of $15, this being an advance
against whatever royalties will become due you after the
record is marketed.
