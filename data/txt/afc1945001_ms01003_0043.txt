Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. DuBois:

Enclosed is a marked copy of a recent issue of
Broadcasters Victory Council.

As you know the Rumor Clinics plan is being held
up pending a clarification of the function of the Information
Services of the Government and of our own relations to the
setup. I hope that the superficial approach suggested by
this statement is not to be the substitute for the careful
plans we have laid.

Cordially,
Chet
Chester S. Williams
Assistant to the Commissioner of Education

P.S. I am scheduled to leave for England on the 22nd of
April barring further difficulties with the Portugese
visa.
