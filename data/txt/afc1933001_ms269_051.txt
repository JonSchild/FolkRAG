our differences and we can settle them; we have our national
burdens and we are willing to bear them realistically. Therefore
I suggest that such a cultural program be urged by the
Library of Congress that will at once:

1. Carry on research through the camera, the phonograph
and the spot radio broadcast that will gather together
the native arts, music, speech, stories, legends, dances,
etc. of the United States.

2. Furnish this material to the people in the form of
radio programs, documentary movies, recordings, publications,
etc., which will be easily understandable.
To furnish the people of America with a many dimensional
portrait of themselves drawn by themselves.

3. Act as a central bureau of distribution for all such
material to commercial movie companies, commercial
radio, commercial music publishers, etc., and to all
governmental and educational institutions in such form
as will be immediately usable by them. To act as a research
gateway to the real America.

This memorandum is a record of my own views on the matter and
reflects certain conversations I have had through the past few
weeks with Dr. Charles Seeger of the Federal Music Project,
Nicholas Ray of the District WPA, B.A. Botkin of the Writers
Project of the Library of Congress and Joseph Losey of the
Association of Documentary of Film Producers. While most of the
specific suggestions are my own, a number of the ideas were
first suggested to me in the course of these random conversations.
