     The following poem exhibits this growing race consciousness on 
the part of the Delta Negroes:

          Think something of yourself you crazy dunce
          No matter if you was a slave once
          Every nation done been a slave once
          They didn't draw up and act a dunce
          Think because you a nigger
          You just can't get no bigger
          But always be on the bottom shelf
          If you don't think something of yourself

          You think because you black
          You got to always stay on the back
          But you always be on the bottom shelf
          If you don't learn to think something of yourself

          You think cause your hair is knotty
          You got to stay behind everybody
          But you always be on the bottom shelf
          If you don't learn to think something of yourself

         Look at Booker T. Washington
         And all then other great mens
         They got on the top shelf
         Why? Because they thought something of themselves
         But you always going to be on the bottom of the shelf
         If you don't think something of your self 

         Don't feel yourself so embarrassed 
         Always be ready to reply
         No matter what the other fellow say
         Then you'll be on the top shelf
         If you learn to think something of yourself. 44.

With the rise of race consciousness among Negroes, songs not only
became less expensive and spontaneous, but the songs seem to have some
purpose other than mere expression.   Some of the purposes may be to 
ridicule whites, or to make subtle protest against the bulwark of racial
segregation.   The following song may be indicative of subtle protests.
