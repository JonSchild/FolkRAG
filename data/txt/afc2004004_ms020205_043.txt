Reverend Roe - Reel 1 - P. 3

want us to learn too much, because they said an educated man wouldn't make a
good slave, and that's true. Well, after we got our farm paid for -- well,
then, we worked hard until we got things fixed pretty well on our farm. We
had a molasses mill and then we had a cotton gin. We ginned the cotton, We
had what they call a grist mill we ground the corn on our farm, and my father
