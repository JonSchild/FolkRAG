oclock the 2nd day all the women
came running out on the job
said "Ol  Cokehead Hannah
is whippin out 1/2 the niggers
in camp."  She was an old
big nigger woman, took
coke and when she'd get high
she'd get mean.  I
had me a pistol in my
jumper & when I went
in the tent where she was
working over these niggers
with her single tree.
I hit her 'side the head
with the pistol butt, I took
about 3 blows to muscle
her down, & then I give her 
a going over her, told her,
"If there's any fighting done
around here, I'm gonna do
it.  Come on me when you
want a fight."

Those day we sold coke
