Came to Mrs. Galvin:    Anti-British rumors

Rumor in a local laundry - white employees-
is that men and women in the plant of the laundry say that
England is double crossing Russing and is going to
leave the U.S. holding the bag. About to be a break 
between England and Russia, that is why Churchill went to
Russia.

England is double crossing U.S. and will never
pay her war debt to us. (Mr. Huse says this significant
that people don't understand Lend-Lease).
