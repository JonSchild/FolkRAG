Fisk, 3. 6.  DAVE EDWARDS

Hear the hesitatin tune; hear the hesitatin tune;
Hear the hesitatin tune; why don't you hie along?
Hesitatin momma, take it for the dollar down.

You got a hesitatin stockin and a hesitatin shoe,
Hesitatin tune.  Why don't you hie along?
Hesitatin momma, take it for the dollar down.

A:  Where did you learn that one?

E:  When I heard the song there about along in 1917, 1916.

A:  God, you weren't very old.

E:  I was about 4, 5 years old.

A:  Did you learn any church songs?

E:  I learned a few of em.

A:  What did you think about going to Sunday school?  Did you enjoy it?

E:  At that time.  At that time, I enjoyed it.

A:  How long since you've been to church now?  Tell the truth now.

E:  Well, I guess by seven years.

A:  You just stay away from it alltogether?  You don't try to be a hypocrite or anything like that.

E:  No, I don't try to be a hypocrite.  If I am not a church man, I just don't go.

A:  So tell me about the first guitar you got.

E:  The first guitar I owned my daddy bought it.  He paid $18 for it.  I played it all the time.  You know, I'd slip away when I used to be working and slip home and play it when they wanted me to be working.  And then they'd get angry and beat me like.

A:  What did he beat you with?

E:  He beat me with a switch.

A:  What could you play?  You couldn't play much.

E:  I couldn't play much.  I played on the old blues I heard.
