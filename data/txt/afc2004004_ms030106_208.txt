M. (singing) Little Liza Jane - Of course I seen my brother-in-law Bill 
Johnson was out there - he stayed out - he was crazy about California
and he wouldn't leave Los Angeles at all. I would constantly ask him 
where Anita was and he wouldn't never tell me. So finally I runned up 
on the old lady - I found out where the old lady was staying, her 
mother, and she says, "O my now Anita would like to see you" and she got 
me in touch with Anita.

At that time Anita was down in Nevada - she had bought a saloon 
business in a little town called Las Vegas, Nevada. The place was 
named the Arcade and she had made a lotta money down there - plenty 
money in the saloon business. So, anyway, her mother notified her I was 
in Los Angeles and she got in touch with me - she came up to Los  Angeles 
to see me and we went back together. And she decided then to let the 
saloon go, unless I wanted to come down there. I went down there 
and it was too doggone cold in the winter and it was too hot in the 
summer. The fact of it was I'd rather be round those palm trees in 
Los Angeles, so Dirk went down, her brother, and when he came back, 
he was able to buy a MacFarland automobile and they was plenty high those 
days.

Anyway Anita decided to stay in Los Angeles, so she went into a 
small hotel business - she bought a hotel on the corner of Central, near 
12th in L.A. andand named it the Anita. By that time I had several 
little businesses branching out myself again. I was connected with a 
dance hall, but the dance halls you could only run tilll 12 o'clock. And 
I decided if you went out in Watts County - the same section where I 
had worked for George Brown - I would be able to run a night spot all night 
long - which I did.
They had a place called Leik's Hole and that's the place I 
taken and I named it - Wayside Park - I had a partner out there with me.
