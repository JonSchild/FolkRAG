Oh, they jus' 'cuse (accuse); they just' 'cuse.   Miss Alice 
said she tellin' herself, I'm gonna tell Bo -- she called me 
Bo Peep 'cause she was trainin' [the chile] me to travel by night 
an' she call me Bo Peep -- an' she was sayin' to herself, "I'm 
gonna sure tell Bo Peep this."   But I was listin' through that -- 
I was just a-listenin'.   They talkin' 'bout me.   An' man, I 
wheeled down [that road] an' run, I run. . .
            Wa'n' so far from there to the station.  They was talkin' 
where I get all these clothes from.   They can't understand it.  
Well this [colored lady] guy I had had a trade place downtown at the grocery 
store an' at that clothes store, see?   An' anytime the dresses 
come in, I mus' see 'em, lettin' me know firs' -- me an' any other 
one that, I get somebody.   But I mus' know when they come in on 
this train, an' go pick out mine befo' anybody'd pick ov' em. 
I had it.   I'm tellin' ya I really had it.   I know I had it.  
An' so, ha!  Ha!   An' so anyhow, I run.   I run downtown.   I got 
me one them skirts -- the new ones, jus' come out, you know, when 
you walk, the pleated skirts, they open up, they show a different color, ya know.  
You couldn't get those in those days for less than eight and 
ten dollars.   I got me one of them skirts an' I got me two, um, 
shambric (cambric) dresses; I got me a pair of shoes -- I didn't 
need no shoes -- but I got me another pair of shoes; I got me a 
beautiful sweater, you know, to wear with the skirt.   It was, ah, 
in a different, I got. . .so. . .an' [that] I run back to that house 
almos' out [of] my breaths so I could catch them there so they 
could wonder where I get that from.   'Cause all these people, what 
they was talkin' about, was workin'.   Ha, ha, ya see?   An' I got 
up to the house. . .whaa. . .I could hardly blow so I could whistle 
or sing.   I went [jus'] there whistlin'.    An' I went jus' whistlin'.  
I went ov' to the house.   An' I got there; I knock on the do'.  
Bang.   Everything stopped.   They was still talkin'.   An' they 
stopped!   An' I jus' shoved the door on open an' I spoke to all 
of 'em.  I said, "I ain' got time to come in."   I jus' shoved 
the package on in the house, up to Miss Alice, her chair.  I 
said, "I'll be back.   I have to go now to Catherine."  I jus' 
wan'd them to see it, ya know.   I didn' want them to go in there 
for them to talk to me; I want them to see it.     Ha,  ha.  An' so I 
said, "Open 'em up, hear?"   Miss Alice say she kinda caught it.  
She was so glad.  She was glad 'cause she know I [done don']
