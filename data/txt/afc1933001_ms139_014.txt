Dearest Alan:

Received your most
welcome letter a few days ago,
But couldn't answer it because
I didn't even have a stamp, but
now as you know, pay has
come and, I got a stamp. Ha. Ha
what poorness. So you had a
great trip, I'm very proud to
hear it, did you see a lot of people
Oh! I suppose a traveler usually
does. Gee darn it, your so far
a person can't talk with you
only by mail, I'm proud of that
too can't kick! Well your muisc
problem how's that treating you
and is your honey back with
you, which Abo made peppermints
