TAPE 57...EDINBURGH CEILIDHE.....Strachan, Murray, etc...
The Ploughman Laddie....last part...John Strachan:


.......................................we hie,
Awa' to see the pretty girls a milking o' their kye,
Each one to see his sweetheart and prie her cherry mou',
Then tak' her half an hour or more, shake hands and bid adieu.

And noo I mean to send my song, and I will end wi' this,
May the ploughmen get mair wages, it is my earnestwish,
It is my heartfelt wish, I say, it is the ploughman's due,
For he sustains baith rich and poor by the handling of the plough.

Hamish:....the collecting of ballads began, following the 
publication by Bishop Percy of his Relics of Ancient Poetry; and
many of the most famous figures in Scottish literature had a part
in this collecting, including Sir Walter Scott.  Now, in the areas
where Scott was collecting on the borders, the great ballads have
nearly died. But up in the North[E]-east of Scotland, in Aberdeenshire,
Kincardin and Banff, some of these great ballads are still sng,
and what's happening now in a moment or two, is I think, something 
quite unique in this festival. You are going to hear one of the 
great border ballads sung by a real folk singer, - that's somebodt 
who hasn't just read it in Scott's minstrelsy or in Bishop Percy'z
Reliques or in any other collection, but has heard it from somebody 
in his or her own youth.  The firstis by Jessie Murray....

Barbara Allen:
1) In Scotland I was born and bred,
In Scotland I was dwelling,
I fell in love with a pretty fair maid,
And her name was Barbie Allen.

2) []
I corted her for seen long years
Till I could court no longer,
I fell sick and very sick
And I sent fot Barbie Allen.

3)
Barbie Allen she was sent for
To the house where she was dwelling,
And as she drew the curtain back,
"Young man, I think you're dying."
