AL:    When did you get them started, how did you get them
started?  Do you remember the first time they danced?

Kyle:    Yeah, Burton was still in the crib.  He was a baby when 
he started.  Becky was about 10.  She won the Jerry Lee Lewis
Clog a thon. . . . . He would start up dancing in his crib, and
hold on when the music started.  He had a lot of rhythm. . . .
Burton started when he was in the crib.   When the music started,
Burton started.   A lot of kids were that way, but Burton went
on to develop. . . .  he's now the world champion.   And Becky,
she didn't start that early.  She was probably about 6 or 7. . .
and then she went on to become the 2 time United States
champion overall- male and female in the US.

AL:   talks, then Jim asks for family history.

Kyle:   My grandfather was a Campbell, from Campbell's Creek.
His family's been here for well over 100 years.  My grandmother
was from Cataloochie Valley.  That's a valley similar to
Maggie Valley, but it's on the National Park, which now there's
a lot of old houses been preserved and they, both were school
teachers and both come to Maggie Valley and that's where my
mother's people were from.   And my daddy's people was from
Sunburst, and some of them come from Madison County, that's
going back about 100 years. . . . . .before that, Scotch and Irish,
they come from overseas so I can't tell you much about that.
