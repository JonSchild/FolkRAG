My dear Mrs. Peckenpaugh

I have never seen the Negro lullaby which you have so kindly sent, although it may have been published elsewhere.  I am not an authority on Negro songs and music.

Thank you for this.  I shall keep it in the files of the Texas Folk-Lore Society, and I hope that at some future time we can publish it under your name.

I am sending you a catalogue just issued by our Society.  We should like very much to have you as a member and can supply you with any back volumes now.

Cordially yours,
J. Frank Dobie
