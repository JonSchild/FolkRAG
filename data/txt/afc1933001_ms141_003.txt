Dear Dr. Spivacke,

     Enclosed you will find the list of the Vocalion releases
which we should acquire for the Archive.  Vocalion is the label
under which the American Record Company now releases all hill-
billy and "race" records, whereas formerly it printed such
records under Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, etc., etc., labels.
The recordings that we particularly want at this moment are marked
with a [dot] star.
     The name of the person in the VictorRCA Corporation who could be
particularly helpful is Mr. Frank Walker.  He was one of the first 
people to interest himself in hill-billy recording and can, besides
giving me access to the Bluebird and other Victor folk material,
tell me many important things about the history of folk song
and semi[e]-folk-song on commercial records.  I should greatly
appreciate it if you could arrange an interview with him for me.
     In this connection, I have just written Miss Flanders and should 
hear from her within a few days.  At that time I will be able to tell
you when it will be possible for me to go to Camden to complete
my bibliography.  If it is possible for me to audition their records
there I will need at least a week and one person to assist me in
writing the cards.
     I have just received a letter from Mr. Schmidt of Fisk Univer-
sity and an writing him to invite him to the Library of Congress
sometime in June when I shall be there.
     With very best regards, I am,
     Sincerely yours,
     Alan Lomax
