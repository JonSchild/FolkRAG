Page 23:     Rumor denial.  Here is the only paragraph devoted to rumor
                    control.  It is inadequate.  How do we know that education
                    and authoritative denials are not effective?  People can
                    be taught the mechanisms of "scapegoating."  People can
                    also be shamed into not spreading rumors.  Other methods
                    of rumor control should have been studied and evaluated.

Page 24:     The scope of future studies.  I recommend that none be
                    made unless tied to the question of rumor control.

Table 8:      It is here that the question arises whether the measure
                    of prejudice was independent of the measure of rumor
                    frequency.

Table 14:    It is important to know whether people were asked if they
                    believed these rumors, or whether the interviewer estimated
                    the degree of belief.
