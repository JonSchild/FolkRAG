GALLEY FIFTY

Oh, the people of the West, when they heard of Jesse's death,
Wondered how the hero come ter die;
But a dirty little coward by the nome of Robert Howard
Laid Jesse James in his grave.

It wuz late one Saddy night when the moon waz shinin' bright
That Jesse robbed the Danville train;
But thet Smith an' Wesson ball knocked pore Jesse frum the wall
End laid Jesse James in 'is grave.

Third Version

From eastern Ky. mountains whites MS., of C. B. House, as given by C. K. Ferrow,
"Songs and Rhymes of the South," Journal of American Folk Lore, Vol. XXV, p. 137.

Oh! Jesse was the man, he traveled through the land,
For money Jesse never suffered pain;
Jesse and his brother Frank, they robbed the Chicago bank
And stopped the Danville train.

Jesse said to his brother Frank, "Will you stand by my side
Till the Danville train passes by?"
"Yes, I'll stand by your side and fight 100 men till I died
And the Danville train has rolled by."

Oh, Robert Ford was the man, he traveled through the land,
He never robbed a train in his life;
But he told the courts his aim was to kill Jesse James,
And to live in peace with his wife.

Ten thousand dollars reward was given Robert Ford
For killing Jesse James on the sly;
Poor Jesse has gone to rest with his hands upon is breast,
And I'll remember Jesse James till I die.
