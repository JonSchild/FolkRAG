Mr. Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
Office of War Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Katz:

In my absence Mrs. Lavery of my office
acknowledged your letter of August 26. Upon returning 
I find here also your letter of September 3,
revising and extending the information contained
in your earlier communication.

I am greatly obliged to you for receiving
our suggestion in so friendly and interested a
manner. We believe that we can carry on the investigations 
proposed in our memorandum and are hopeful
that the development of budgetary matters will be such 
as to allow your office to contribute to the financing 
of the enterprise.

Sincerely yours,
[*Robert Redfield*]                       Robert Redfield
