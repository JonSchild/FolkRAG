gittin' off the gas.  Everything at one time!  It said, "Rurrr,
urruh."  I was git' that house, an' Jig fell out the back seat,
heh!  Jig was ready to git outa here!  Jig fell. . .an' I could
hear things fallin' in the house.  You know, 'cause it's, oh, jus' a lil'
shack, ya know?
     An' so, then I, I got it stopped, though. An' I, I was 
jis', didn' get scared at all.  I jus' backed it up; put it right
