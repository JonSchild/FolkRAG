(Autobiography)                                 Jimmy MacBeth (contd.)
My father was [Jimmy] James MacBeth,     the same as myself.
Well,  they reckon at one time that MacBeth met the witches
at Brodie o' Brodie, that it was my great, great, grandfather
(GHOULISH LAUGH) but I don't believe that, I don't 
believe that to be quite true!
