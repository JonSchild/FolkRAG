Reverend Roe.  Reel 13.  P. 4
[*Preaching to white folks.*]
On one occasion, when they was about to break up the Baptist Church,
the Christian Church, the Camellite--they were about
[go] to break it up, and so the Carmellite preacher met me down there.  He
come to my church, and when I got through with him, why, [(laughter)]
he hushed; he didn't bother me and he soon left there.  And so they
had me co come down.  I didn't go to the church to preach, but I went
down to the Baptist deacon's house, and I taught them the doctring
and made them see it.  And that saved the church.  
[*The doctrine*]
He was teaching on
the [generational] regeneration of baptismal and he claim[ed], you know, that you wasn't
saved until you went in the water and come out, and the Holy Spirit
come to you after yo come [out] up.  You had to be batized in the water
to be saved.  He was teaching that doctring.  And I talked to him, you
know, The Bible said God [give] [shall give] so lo?? the ??? us all to be gotten, that
whosoever shall lead and who shall [not] have a everlasting life.  I said
faith is the thing that saves you.  I said faith in God will make you
willing to obey God's commandment, and when you become [will] willing to obey
God's commandments, then on the ground of that faith He saves you,
and then you don't go [to] t be baptzed to be saved; you got to be baptized
because you are saved.  And to prove it, you know, I [just] spoke of
the life of Abraham and the [old Elias]  ????? ? Isaac, see.  He never did offer [the] up
Isaac, but he was perfectly willing to do so, and because he
considered in his mind to do that act, why, the Lord taken it as it
was done and blessed him as though he had did it.  And the Bible says
"He offered up his son."
Well, I said, now when you become willing, you see, to take on Christ
by baptism, on the ground of your faith, He saves you.  And then I
showed them the fact if that was not so then The Gospel didn't meet
man's condition.  A man might be lost in the desert where he'd never [might]
[never be] found, and if he wanted to be saved, how could he without no
preacher there to baptize him?  He couldn't.  But the Gospel is fixed
