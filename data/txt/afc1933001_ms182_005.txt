Mr. Alan Lomax
Archive of American Folk Song
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax,

I send you under separate cover the first part
of my ballad story which you requested in your letter of March
23, and which appeared in The Arkansas Gazette yesterday. The
second part of the story is scheduled to appear next Sunday - - -
a rather awkward division necessary to meet printing requirements.
I think the Gazette is sending you copies too, but I note one or
two typographical errors and have corrected them in the copy I
send.

Thank you very much for your assistance with this
story. During my residence in Arkansas I have made a considerable
study and collection of ballads and vanishing types of popluar
mountain song, so that it was a special pleasure to me to be able
to help Mr. Randolph find and record some of the folk song of
this locality.

It is my opinion that Arkansas folk song has as
yet scarcely been touched by collectors. For some years I have
made the songs of the mountains my study. I have no notion what
the set-up may be on the loan of Library of Congress equipment,
but if the work of recording is a regular activity I should like
very much to participate in recording the songs of this region.
I have the necessary background for understanding and evaluation
of folk song, and am familiar with the people, customs and traditions
of the Ozark mountains; especially the Arkansas Ozarks, which retain
a more primitive culture than any other region I know. In my own
work of collecting I have formed a wide acquaintance among people
who still have much left of their heritage of song and story.

I should like to have the checklist of American
folk songs in the Archive which you mentioned in your letter as
shortly to be published.

Copies of the second part of my story will be
sent to you as soon as it is published. Thank you again for your
helpfulness and for your courtesy.

Sincerely yours,
Irene Carlisle
