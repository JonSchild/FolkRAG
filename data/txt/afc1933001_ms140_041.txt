If you are not yet familiar with the parts of the exhibit mentioned
above, and their size and location in the floor plan of the building,
I am sure Mr. Curran will be glad to give you whatever information
he has.

I. The Bandshell

The following events to be presented by the Recreation
Division in the bandshell were submitted to the committee:

A. A puppet or marionette show. This is the show
telling the story of WPA and its treatment of the
leisure problem, which Nick Ray and I have already
discussed with you and Miss Williams. I am attaching
the expanded outline for the script of the show
which we promised you when we were in New York. Included
is both an outline script and an outline of
the philosophical points that should be worked into
the story. Will you transmit this to Miss Williams
so that her unit can start work on it as soon as
possible?

We have suggested that performance of the show take
20 minutes and be presented four times daily. It
is estimated that the show may call for 12 or 15
performers.

B. A folk dancing group to present folk dances of
America and other countries. This performance
would last 15 minutes and may be presented 4 times
daily. It would call for approximately 12 persons
dancing in costume. The program of dances may be
changed every week or every day on a weekly schedule
or every performance on a daily schedule.

C. American folk song group drawing upon the folk
music from all over the country which has been
collected by a number of agencies. This performance
would also take 15 minutes and would be presented
four times daily. The program of performances
could vary on a daily or weekly schedule in
the same manner as the folk dance group. This
group would consist of from 8 to 12 people dressed
informally, using instruments of accompaniment such
as banjoes,  dulcimers, and the like. Plans should
be made for audience participation in the choruses
of these songs.
