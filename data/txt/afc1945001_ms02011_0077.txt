Rumor Reporting
The first responsibility of a rumor-control project is,
therefore, the collection and analysis of rumors. In order to have
a truly representative collection and analysis of rumors, rumor-
control groups should have representatives of civic clubs, different 
religious denominations, unions, minority groups, educators, 
professional men. In a large community, it is desirable to have
skilled persons who devote themselves to the systematic reporting
of rumors; in a small community, they are probably not necessary. 
Rumor reports are most useful if submitted in writing, signed by
the reporter. The signature is simply a testimony of good faith;
the names of reporters should never be disclosed. Experience shows
that rumor reports should not be accepted (or encouraged) over the
telephone: first, because the use of the telephone exaggerates
the seriousness of the rumor; and second, because the telephone
encourages spontaneous conversation about the rumors instead of considered analysis of the total body of rumors.
