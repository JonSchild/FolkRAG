1.  WHAT IS A RUMOR?

An account is a rumor:

A.  When an authoritative source is designated without authority or verifiability.  Example:  "The Secretary of State, a friend of mine reports, is certain we will get all the rubber we need from South America."

B.  When the authoritative source is unknown to the person transmitting the account.  Example:  "I hear that this is a phony rubber shortage."

C.  When the source is an authoritative person acting in an unauthoritative capacity (i.e. leaks).  Example: "Our Congressman has told me off the record that legislation is being drawn up to requisition private tires right after election."

Accounts possessing any of these traits are rumors.  Thus, rumors may appear in communication media of all types, from all types of people.

The actual truth or falsity of an account has no bearing on its status as a rumor.
