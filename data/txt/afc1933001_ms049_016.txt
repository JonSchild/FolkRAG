                                                                                                                                                           October 19, 1937



The attached letter from Mr. John A. Lomax outlines the cost of his activities in behalf of the Library during the past summer. I recommend that Mr. Lomax be reimbursed for his incidental expenses and that he receive mileage and per diem, as listed below, all to be charged to the appropriation for the increase of the library. 

                                                                                                                       Acting-Chief,
                                                                                                                        Division of Music
