5)  The medical inspection, boys, is just a bleeding farce,
He gropes around your penis and he noses up your arse,
For even a private's privates, boys, enjoy no privacy,
You'll sacrifice all that to save democracy.

Chartists' Song:
Men of the honest heart, men of the stalwart hand,
Men willing to obey and able to command,
Men of the right withheld, slaves of the power abused,
Machines cast to neglect, when their freshness hasbeen used.
'Tis not to build a grave where the dying miner dwells,
'Tis not to work for others, but to labour for yourselves.
