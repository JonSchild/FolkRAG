BJ TAPE 19, p. 13

An' the next morning there be so many.  Then they orders, I mean
they ships ripes, ripe tomatas from all up around in, ah, Virginia.
They come from there by the 7 and 8 [grade] great big vanloads.  That's
what I tell ya...
TL: What's the name of that company, Bessie?
BJ: That's ah, ah, it's ah, um, well, Leon Buello's the one that
runs it, see.  But it's called to be Henderson.
TL: Henderson?
BJ: Yeah.  Henderson Canning Company.  But Leon Buello was
runnin' it.  At the time.  But it's still Henderson.
I met a man in ah, in ah, Connecticut one day.  That's my
daughter-in-law's -- my daughter's, I mean -- husband's brother?
An' that time I went up there for my granddaughter's weddin'?  An'
he says, "I, I knows you.  At, at, ah, at Henderson."
I said to myself, "I ain't never been to no Henderson."  Said
to myse'f, ya know.  'Cause I forgets all about the place named
Henderson.
An' then he said, "Yes," said, "In, in Maryland.  Up out
there, out, out from Preston."
I said, "I know," I said, "But where is Henderson?"
He said, "It's a cannin' --"
Oh, then I began to think!  But aroun' that time we never
did call it [that] that at all.  We always jus' said, jus' said
Buello['s].  Because, an', um, because Leon Buello was runnin'
it.  An' he stayed in Bridgeville, Delaware, um, an' say, just
about, I reckon about 6 miles from there.  Where, where this
factory sit, it sit right on the line of two counties...Right on
the line.  The highway divided the counties.
TL: How long did you work in the factories down there?
