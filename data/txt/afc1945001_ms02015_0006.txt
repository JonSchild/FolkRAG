Dear Mr. Webber:
        In the survey of rumors there were only two reported to me and
they are enclosed and on the cards that the individual used in reporting
the rumor to me. 

        Each individual that was requested to assist in this survey were
willing to do so.  Each one stated that it was not too burdensome and that
they would be willing to cooperate anytime in the future that they were
requested to do so.
