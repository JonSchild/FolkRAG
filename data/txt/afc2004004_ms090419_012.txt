John kept praying for God to take him out of this
hard world. He had a certain tree [and] he'd go to and pray all
the time. His old marse got wise to it, slipped down there and
heard him, "Lord, I sure do want you to take me out of this hard
world. Please come take me out of this hard world."

Well, his marse was young , you know, and devilish, so one
morning 'fo' day, he got a white sheet, put it over his head and
went down to John's house and knocked on the door, "Bam, bam, bam,
bam."

John's wife was up. She say," Who's there?"

Say, "This is the Lord. I come after John."

She looked back in the bed, say, "John, what must I tell
him."

Say, "Tell him I ain't here." Old John got under the bed
and she say, "Lord, John ain't here."

He say, " Well, you'll do. I'll take you along."

She say, "Come out from under that bed, John!!"

Well, John come out from under the bed and lit out the
back door, running, in his bare feet. His wife holler, "Lord,
yonder goes John out across the field, back of the house!"

So the Lord got in behind him, and right across the field
they went, him and his old marse. The only lady set in the back
door, kimboed, and watched John just left the Lord behind. She
called him, say, "Lord, O lord. . Lord, O Lord . . . You can't catch
John, cause John barefooted."
