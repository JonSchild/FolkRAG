Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have been waiting to hear from you concerning
the terms for including the songs from "This
Singing Country" in the contract we have renewed 
with your father for the use of his songs
on sustaining programs during the coming year. 
May we know your decision as quickly as possible
so that we can draw the formal papers and make 
the necessary payment for same? 

Sincerely,
