Reverend Roe. Reel 5. P. 5
R: Common, just as common.
A: You mean, they were always running after the [Negroes] colored folks down there...
R: Oh yeah, they was always something [they did going on] they'd go round. They [had] heard a
colored person, you know,, doing anything wrong or practising anything,
they'd go round with that crowd and they'd [caught] call him out and warn him and
tell [him what] to him what they [going] wanted to do, and give him a warning, and then look
in sometime.
A: Was that Ku Klux? They didn't wear robes?
R: No, they called [them] um Ku Klux, but they werent nothing but mobs..
A: They didn't wear a disguise; they did it right out in the open.
R: No, no disguise.
A: Was there a time there when the Negroes voted right after the
Civil War?
[*Negro voters*]
R: Oh yeas, we voted, yes sir, yes sir! [They] We voted. [up until the] I went to the
election many time, and those fellows would be looking and raising
Cain there a little and they'd be hollering this, that, and the other, and all the
colored people were Republican. If you told a colored
fellow, you was a Democrat, it meant a fight. I remember on one
occasion there was an old man at my home -- he was a terrible man
with his fists-- he would knock the bark off of a tree with his
fists. And his name was Scribe, Old Man Scribe, and Old Man Nero
was his [name] neighbor. One occasion after the election Old Man Nero came
[*All Republicans*]
by Old Man Scribe's house. He was mad, but we didn't know what
about. So he called him called Old Man Scribe. [and this] "Here's Old
Man Nero," [said] says, "Come out here. I want to see you." He walked out.
"What do you want?" He says, "I heard you told the folks round here
I voted the Democratic ticket [for middle the] a middling of meat.." [But he] "And I didn't
say it."
