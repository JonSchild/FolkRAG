Dear Mr Lomax,
In your letter of 29th Nov. 1939. you invited me to present to the
Archive of American Folk Song in the Library of Congress my collection of Songs of the
People. I made this collection in two series, the first No 1 to 246; the second from
No 464 to 836. It has taken a lot of hunting to assemble these as I had lavishly given
my copies far and wide. I have at last got the second series complete- three hundred
and seventythree songs, which I now send. I am working at the assembling of the first
series. At any rate it is not well these times to put all one's eggs in one basket.
If you want at any time to correspond about any song, it will be sufficient to
mention the number. I made it a rule to set these songs in a key which would suit the
average singer and hence I rarely went above D in the natural scale.
This is the biggest collection of folk songs made, I think, by one person in
Ireland. Larger collections of airs have been made but these songs are all from the lips
of the people and savour of the open field.
Although I am presenting this collection gratis, as agreed upon by you, I look
for 20 dollars to recoup cost of typing. In many instances I had only one copy and in
giving you the printed copy, had to type one for myself.
I have done a lot of research of interest to Americans. The Year Book of the
Ulster-Irish Society of New York published two of my articles last year.
If you write to Mr C.K. Bolton, Pound Hill Place. Shirley, Mass. he knows all about
my work. Ulster is so busy with politics it has no time for encouraging culture. If you
could in any way signalise appreciation of my work (through a University or otherwise)
it would be a welcome reward for 16 years of strenuous but happy research in folk songs
I am at present engaged in preparing broadcast scripts for the Overseas Programs on
Ulster ballads. One is fixed for Sunday April 27th and the other in the middle of May.
If this is in time, you may hear my voice.  Yours sincerely
 Sam Henry
