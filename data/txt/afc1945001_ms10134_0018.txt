Anecdotes, etc. pertaining to the
War effort

1. On the date of the President's birthday, when
he was in Casablanca, two American
medical officers on leave for the week
decided to celebrate the President's birthday,
unaware at the time that he was any
where near Africa.  Whisky is scarce 
in Liberia, where these two officers 
were stationed, and they had gone to
quite a bit of trouble to find two quarts
for which they had paid an exorbitant
price.
   After seeing what sights there were to 
be seen about the town, the officers
decided to return to their quarters and
have a drink of their precious whiskey.  
Upon reaching their quarters, they slipped
quietly and unobtrusively in, for they
had no intentions of letting the rest of
the post share their hard-won treasure.
Having locked and boted the door,
they produced the two bottles, opened
one, and poured their drinks.
   One of them, standing near the 
window with a bottle and a glass
in his hand proposed a toast to
the President.  No sooner had 
they finished their first drink than
the officer standing near the window
suddenly smashed his glass to the 
floor, and seizing both bottles,
emptied them down the drain.
"That ------ stuff is poison!!!"
he shouted, "I'll never take another
sip as long as I live!!"  "I had no
sooner drunk to the President than I
saw him riding by in a jeep!!!"
