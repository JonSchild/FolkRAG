1658 B (Con't.)
order to try to keep the crowd together.  I realized it was a
killing and many of us did, too, and we started breaking out
windows, just going all over through the doors.  They always had a
policeman, one policeman at all dances, two sometimes -- run
over the policemens and everything.
After I got on the outside I felt that I was safe, so
I decided I would look and see what would happen.  After a
while, the patrol pulled up.  The took the dead man and laid him
in the bottom of the patrol wagon, and finally here comes the
little man that shot him, little crippled man -- that is, full of
rheumatism -- and later on they put Buddy Bolden in the patrol.
I've often wondered why they would put Mr. Bolden in that
patrol and he was up there trying to blow the notes to keep
everyone quiet and I was right there seeing the man got killed.
Question:  Why did Buddy Bolden go crazy?
Morton: Why, I'll tell you, they claim that Buddy 
Bolden went crazy because he really blew his brains through
the trumpet.  Was the blowingest man that ever lived since
Gabriel.  He was really a great man at that.  But he didn't
play jazz.  He was a ragtime player.
Question:  Where did he come from?
Morton:  Buddy Bolden was a New Orleans boy, as far as I know.
Question:  Negro?
Morton:  He was a Negro, yes.  Right in New Orleans.
Question:  Dark?
