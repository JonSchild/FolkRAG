REGIONAL DIRECTOR                        San Antonio, Texas,
                                                              August 17, 1942

Gentlemen:

Mr. James B. Marley, Regional Director of the Social Security 
Board and Federal Security Agency in Region X, has requested that I be
one to collect rumors during the weeks of August 3 and August 10.  On
August 9 I wrote you stating that no rumors had been heard regarding
war information and on August 10 I received a letter from the Regional 
Director, stating that the time had been extended through August 15.
I should like to give the two rumors which follow:

Baton Rouge, Louisiana, August 13 - 

In conversation with several people it seemed to be the consensus
of opinion that we were not hearing of the destruction of the convoys [*1*]
to European Countries and it was their feeling that much more destruction
and loss of life is taking place than is being reported.

Baton Rouge, Louisiana, August 13 - 

It was reported to me that Hitler would offer a plan of peace
not later than October or November. It seems that this rumor is spreading [*3*]
quite rapidly although this is the only place I heard it so definitely
stated.

Sincerely yours,

Hazel Bratley

Regional Representative
