Dear Dr. Spivacke:

It has been suggested that the American School of the
Air Music Program be transcribed on records for distribution
in Latin America. Scripts of the other programs will be sent
to Latin America for translation, but in the case of this musical
program, this obviously, is not practical. Spanish commentary
should be dubbed in over the music because an estimate of
the cost of this project.

1. A Spanish consultant for 26 weeks at $50.00 per week
.............$1300.00

2. A translator for 26 weeks at $25.00 per week
.............$650.00

3. Cost of original re-recording [?] and nine duplicate
records of each program............$

Total     _____________
