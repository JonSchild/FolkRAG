Alan Lomax     Dr. Harold Spivacke, Music

January 31, 1941

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

     You'll be interested in the two attached letters. Perhaps if 
Victor or Columbia do not wish to do the recording, it will be a good
Defense Program material for us to keep in mind later on.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
