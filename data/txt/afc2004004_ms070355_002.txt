Corn song--Muddy Waters...

Um---, what you want me to do,
I done give you my money, died for you...

Well, I were waiting from my summer change,
I was waitin, I was waitin for my summer change,
And as soon as the wind rise, I'm goin away.

I take my 32[0]-20 and lay you in your grave,
And the day of Resurrection, you gonna rise again.

Everybody keep on hollerin about old Dangerous Doom,
I get my 32-20, I'm gonna be dangerous, too.

I been laying around, mama, all day long,
Just studyin and thinkin, must I blow my horn.

I been sitting and talking with the little old woman,
Beggin for Kitty-tom, lordy, lordy, beggin for kitty-tom.

Well, I was wonderin if I go down in Lous'ana
Will my woman be there?

Then you ((scared of Mister Charley about Mister Blair,
Mister Charley paid off, Mister Blair give a drag.

Well, ((bye-bye)) woman, what you want to be,
By me working for Mister Charley, I goes to Mister Blair.

Just as soon as I make a hunde dollo, 
I give my woman fifty dollo, I throw the rest away.

O Lordy---, you just keep on hollin, about time have been,
And these blues I'm singin--I been here and gone.

And my woman she told me to change my home,
And my daddy, he told me, "Son, you all right."

When I was a little kid, at home and be bad,
My father, he grab me, shuck the bad away.
