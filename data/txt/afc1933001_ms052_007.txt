Dear Mr. Waters:
Take a moment and
tell me the fortunes of "Cowboy
Songs". Until I got
away I scarcely realized
the favor I had asked of
you in seeing the book
through the press. I'll try
to make it up to you
someday. You will need
more money for stamps
for returning the page
proofs. I'll get a check

to you as soon as I can
find a blank. Meanwhile,
please note what you spend
for me and, also, the approximate
time you [s] take 
in checking the proofs
For a bunch of green 
travellers among a people
of a strange tongue
I suppose we have got
along with a minimum
of [f] trouble. The people
rob you with our charges,
though on the whole
we can live as cheaply
in this beautiful country
