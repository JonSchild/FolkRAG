My dear Mr. Lomax:

I am happy you feel I have done some justice to your
wonderful book in my review in Modern Music.

I am not surprised that a volume of songs so deeply
filled with the reality of our American life should
stir the sullen resentment and hostility of official
bigots and home_grown fascists. The work you are doing
is, as you must know, not only musicological, but in
the fullest sense cultural and social _ and you must
take such antagonism as a kind of tribute. All  this,
of course, you know already.

Greetings, and a speedy smashing of Hitlerism every_
where!
