[*Chicago Rumor Area Study File*]

    At the present time under a limited budget we are making an initial
study of rumors prevalent in Chicago. Our study is being conducted
with the aid of voluntary informants who send in weekly reports of what
they have heard or overheard.  (For instruction sheets and forms see
exhibits A, B, C, and D attached.)  The first of these reports was due the
first week of July, and our informants will continue to send in statements
until notified to discontinue their cooperation. [Bi]Semi-monthly a brief statement 
is sent to our informants reporting the type of material which we are 
securing. (For the first of these statements, see Exhibit E.)
      About 50 persons are cooperating in this study. These informants
have been carefully selected from six areas [from] in Chicago. The areas
studied are Hegeswick, a Slavic industrial community; Hyde Park, a middle-class 
primarily native-white district;  Highland Park, an upper-class residential 
suburb; the South Side Negro district; South Chicago, an industrial 
suburb with a mixed population of Slavic, Mexican and Negro; and the Near 
West Side, a lower-class Italian and Negro district.
      Our materials, which at the present time are still limited in
quantity (representing the reports of only two weeks) contain series of
current rumors and opinions adjacent thereto.  They are what our informants 
have heard or overheard- there is no interviewing or questioning
involved.  The materials show the following preoccupations and consensus:

sugar rationing.
