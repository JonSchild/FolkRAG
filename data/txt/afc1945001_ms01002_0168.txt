Subject: Rumors (Negro Attitude toward War)

A call from R. L. Webster in the Secretary's Office at Agriculture
this morning brought out a rumor which has been bothering him,
since he has heard three versions of it, indicating to him that a 
concerted campaign is on to cause trouble among the negro population.
He heard it first as an altercation taking place on a street car.
His wife heard it as a difficulty on an Alexandria bus, with a negress
who refused to sit in the back of the bus.  Her comment to the driver
of the bus was, "I'll be glad when the Japs win.  Maybe we negroes 
will get some consideration then."  This story came through his wife, 
who supposedly heard it from a person who saw it.  On checking with
that person, it appeared she had heard it from another, and so on --
to no source.  The third time it was a maid who didn't like something
she was asked or forced to do.  This, it seems to me, is the type
of whispering campaign we should check on.
