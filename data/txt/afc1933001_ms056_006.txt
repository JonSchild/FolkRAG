Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The machine is not the only thing
delaying your trip.  I received the verbal
approval of the Librarian for your trip
but he asked me to work out a detailed
recommendation which will take me several
days.  I sincerely hope through that we
shall be able to get you started toward
the end of this month.

In addition to my usual rush at this
time of the year, my wife's illness has
also served to slow me up. It won't be 
long now.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S.  I received your previous letters with
many enclosure but have not had time to
read them all as yet.
