Dear Harold, 
Enclosed you will find two of the lowest estimates I 
have been able to get on the dubbing of the Boogie-Woogie- 
Carnegie Hall recordings. I asked for an estimate on 
the basis of five sets: One for John Hammond, one for 
the Library, one for the New Masses (if they will pay for 
it), one for you, and one to be distributed among the 
singers (as promised). If the new Masses is not interested 
or not financially able, Eric Clarke has expressed 
a desire for some of the material and we could undoubtedly 
place others of the records strategically and well. 
Several letters enclosed will require Miss Rogers attention 
as to typing and filing. 
Isn't there any news or have you decided not to write 
me? 
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
