Jean: Must have had a terrific memory. No -- I couldna
possibly believe it.
Lomax: Who's the best singer you rver heard of the songs?
Jean: The best singer living is like Jimmy McBeath, and he's
very, very good. He's in Ireland now but he belongs to Scotland.
He was called Davy Stewart. He played the accordion - the
button box as we call it - and by God, he could sing! Jimmy
McBeath kens him. He's been with him long ago. He lives in
Ireland now. He went away from Aberdeen to Ireland.
Lomax: Do you suppose we would find out where he is ? Could
you ask and find out where he is?
Jean: Oh yes, yes. His name was Davy Stewart.
Lomax: You say he was the best singer you ever heard of the songs?
Why was he the best singer?
Jean: Because he was. I mean to say, he was really good; he had
really good songs. Knew corn-kisters. He was a genius.
Lomax: Better than Jimmy?
Jean: Oh, he's a better singer than Jimmy. Very good. Do you
ken "cornkisters ?" -- Ripe Ones!
Lomax: And he had the ballads too?
Jean: Ballads too -- lovely ballads.
Lomax: We must find him. Where does he live?
Jean: I don't know. He went away to Ireland a few years ago,
but where he is in Ireland I really don't know. Margaret Barry
would have tellt ye because she has seen him now.
Lomax: He lives in a caravan?
Jean: I couldn't tellyou anything about him. But - I don't know
if they call him by his name in Ireland - but he always went
by the by-name of "the Galoot", and he was very well known.
And of course, there's another very good singer and knows very
good songs - but I don't know if he would sing or not. He lives
in Huntley. Geordie Stewart. He was very very good. He's a 
lovely singer as well, lovely voice.
Lomax: And he sings ballads, too?
Jean: Oh, he can sing ballads, alright; Any kind of ballad.
When he was a young boy, wherever he went, he alwys won the
prizes. Geordie Stewart. Course, he went into the big money
nowadays, and I don't know if he sings.
Lomax: What does he do?
