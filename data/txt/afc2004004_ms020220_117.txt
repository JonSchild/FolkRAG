but this girl was born in the veil.  In the whole thing.  Jus'
like in a sack or a bladder of water.  Jus' like somebody born
in a bladder, or water.  And I'm sure all her water had broke
an' everything.  She was...Lord I started to say, "[Lawd,] What in the
world this coming here in this world?"  That was the funniest--
It was a beautiful baby.  You...You never been at a hawg killin'?
TL:  No.  No.
BJ:  You never seen hawg chilin's (chitterlings) befo' they was
stripped?  They's a thing on a hawg chilin's called a shawl.
An' ah, hit, hit look jis' like it.  Hit's a, hit's a, a spread,
so you, you, you can spread it out.  On a big hawg, can spread
it out all over this whole table here.  They jus' pull it on
off the entrails thing, call it a shawl.  An' you can jus' spread
it out and hit jus' do it -- a whole lot of fat here then a little
place in there it ain't no fat.  Just like this thing here; it's
pretty.  Fat here an' then the other part of it, it's jus' like
a thin curtain.  Jus' fat here an' then this...An' that's the
way [it is] that is.  Then she looked in there, ya know, by the
water bein' in there, ya know, she was in that beautiful, thin
shawl.  An' that water weighed, that made it look like a real
shawl.  I'll tell ya the truth: If I didn't just have to take
her out of there, I'd a-just let her stayed there!  Yes, it was
really, it was really cute.
TL:  Well, you said she had to keep the veil...
BJ:  Yeah, uh-huh.
TL:  ...so that she wouldn't be bothered by spirits?
BJ:  Tha's right.  Um-hum.
TL:  What's that?
BJ:  Spirit?
