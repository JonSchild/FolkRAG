RUMORS - 2

he has a new business which is much more satisfactory and when asked what it is
he replies "I am now smuggling Christians into the government service in Washington."

These are only two of the jokes which seem to be prevalent at the moment. 
There are doubtless others. The joke method seems to be a new device used by the 
"wedge drivers" in emphasizing their feelings on particular subjects and in their 
criticisms of the government program, particularly in relation to the rationing and 
economic controls. 

On August 3 reports on the Canadian Press wires and Associated Press
gave news of the finding of two bodies of American soldiers off the coast of 
Digby's Neck in the Bay of Fundy. This resulted in some new rumors being put in 
circulation immediately that large numbers of bodies were found at various places 
along the coast. Investigation by the writer indicated that these rumors grew  
bigger the farther they were from the Bay of Fundy and reports from Bangor and 
other points adjacent did not disclose the rumors in circulation there at all. 
However, in Boston the bodies of two soldiers had grown to be "hundreds" not only 
in the immediate vicinity of where the two bodies were found but Newfoundland was
also mentioned.

The rumors most constantly heard are: 
1. Russia will make a separate peace. 
2. Jews are not doing their part in the war.
3. England is keeping her soldiers at home waiting for us to do the fighting.
4. Too much politics in rationing. 
5. New England is the victim of discrimination.
6. Congress is too much interested in getting its own members re-elected[l].
