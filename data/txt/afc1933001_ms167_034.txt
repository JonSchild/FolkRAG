Dear Mr. Lomax:

The Columbia Lecture Bureau Catalogue for 1941-1942 goes to
press shortly. As the world has been changing so rapidly, there
will be but few speakers who will wish to retain the same
lecture titles as were used last year.

So that the booklet will be up-to-date, would you send us a list
of any new titles that you might like to add. As there will be room
for only four or five titles, should your list be longer than this,
please indicate which you would prefer us to use.

Any new material, such as awards, new books, special research
or new journeys should be included.

From time to time we are in a position to place material on
various lecturers for publication. In order for us to procure the
maximum publicity in connection with your lectures, please be sure
to send us, from time to time, new pictures, whether they be portraits
or snapshots of yourself alone or with another interesting
personality, or doing something of particular interest. New material,
whether it be in connection with your work, or some interesting
or amusing experience that you have had recently will also be
appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
Richard Erstein
