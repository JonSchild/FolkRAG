He says my dearest eligance
you've farely won my hrt
Fareyouwell to home & kindred
from them I'm going to part
(2) I'm going
away
to that rude & savage
conteree called wild
Amerikay

We got our Lovli Nell on board
our anchors then did we
And well crowded decks
& bending sails to 
reach Amer
We'll settle down
