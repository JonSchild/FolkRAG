Milkcow's Calf Blues, Robert Johnson,
Robert Johnson, Perfect 7-10-65(Da1403)

Tell me, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you, (2)
Well, by havin' yo' calf, yo' milk is turnin' blue,

Yo' calf is hongry and I b'lieve and I believe *he* needs a suck, (2)
*Well now* yo' milk is turnin' blue and I b'lieve he's outa
luck.

I feel like milkin' an' my cow won't come,
I feel like churnin' an' my milk won' turn,
I'm cryin', "Hoo----, hoo----,
Don' *do* me wrong,
If you can give right milk an ' butter, baby, *hoo!*
*If we stay* at home.

My milkcow been ramblin' for miles aroun',
She's been suckin' some other bull-cow, *hoo!* Lawd, in the same town.
