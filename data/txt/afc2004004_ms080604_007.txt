Bill Gordon:
Mr. B.T. (?) had a large camp...
W.B.:
Yeah. And ahh -Brown, the man that I worked
for --the man that I made pay off-- he lived at Burgess (?)
farm, I'm from Rosedale.   Everybody paid off that was supposed
to pay off.   And he would give me doodling books, like stamp
books today, you couldn't but nothin' nowhere but out of his
commissary with them books.  Well, I wasn't but thirteen years
old then, and Steve Daniels and his wife they run a kitchen.
They had a girl named Gertrude --they married us off.   I'm
thirteen, and she twelve (laughs), and we stayed in the camp.
I wore lace boots and button leg pants.  I had a 41 raw side 
Colt (rawhide coat?) 'bout that long -and I'd put it on my
side it come to my knees. And I used to go hunting with Mr.
Brown -with a shotgun- and I was a pretty good marksman. And
everybody paid off but him.   That Monday morning wunt none of 
us going out -wunt nobody goin out, you know, that's what they
had said Sunday.  He gave us a drag --gave us them doodling
books that. . .
A.L.:
What does a drag mean?
W.B.:
Well, that was the off day.  See, you worked
there everyday.  See, you had Sunday off -ah Saturday evening
and a Sunday off.  That was payday. But the other days you
worked all them days, see.  And so they said they wasn't goin
ta --now you know what I'm talking about (point to Bill
Gordon) --
Bill Gordon: 
Yeah!
W.B.: 
And ah...
B.G.:
Whole lot of 'em didn't pay off at all.  They
give what they call a drag --give you a little sumpin just to
gamble with. . .
W.B.:
...Yeah! Just give you a doodling book and
they would play piddly-paddly --shoot dice for them doodling
books.   And I had my pistol.  And Gertrude asked me that
morning.  Now, Mr. Brown was the man --he would whip you if
you stand, and he would shoot you if you run.  And I didn't
think he would know better than me - I didn't believe he
could beat me shootin'.  And they called me Baby Boy.  I was
the youngest of 'em in the camp.   And Monday morning, everybody
be getting up goin out there 3:30.  They go catch they mules
