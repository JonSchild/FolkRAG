My brother who is a paratrooper in Georgia
wrote me that on Saturday nights when
most of the boys go into town for a good
time the M.P.'s try to act smart but
that the paratroopers take the M.P.'s off
their high pedestals. Then the para-
troopers act smart but there is no one
to stop them because most of them are 
over six feet tall and are very strong, 
and the other soldiers seem a little 
afraid of them. 
A woman told me that a sailor on
a train told her that the boys get 
beans three times a day at Navy Pier.
