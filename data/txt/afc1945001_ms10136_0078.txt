I.    Two ladies were sipping brandy, 
and talking about the war. 
The fat lady said to the newly
married bride, "and how is 
the nervous groom?" The bride 
said - he left for the army
this morning. The other lady
laughed and said "Uncle Sam
ain't no woman in skirts but
he shore will take your man."
