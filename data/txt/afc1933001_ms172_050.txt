Dear Mr. Fisher:

For the next ten day, my address will be General Delivery,
Blairsville, Georgia. I suggest you send a copy of whatever 
letters you may write to me in care of the Information
Office, TVA, Knoxville, Tennessee.

I am delighted that Leadbelly will be well enough to go to
Mexico City, and the departure from Atlanta on August 11
fits in with my plans very well. You will, of course,
forward me the plane ticket well in advance of my departure.

I will notify you of any change in address.

                                                    Cordially yours,
    
   
 
                                                     Alan Lomax

P.S. It is very important that I be back in Nashville on 
the 16th, and would like you to route my return by Nashville
with a stopover of a day and make the termination
of the trip Roanoke, Virginia, by American Airlines.
