- It has rained a lot. The light has
been very little in our cottage crouching 
here on a lip of the sea. But in these 
hours of sun, the day has had
the soft blue of Constable's painting,
Shakespeare's springtime tenderness,
and in the evening that divine
silver-green.

I could stay here forever with
someone who loved me. Every time
I walk up a hill the whole thing
of myself is clearer, even with
this bloody wound in my side -
had I have worked out my
first plot. Think maybe I should 
turn to plotting. After a life of
repression, I ought to have
some very queer stories inside
Well, we'll go on & see.

God, tho, I'm weak & almost
castrated.
