got some nurse from some other conjuror, understand. She didn't come
to Uncle Tom; she went to some conjuror [from] cross over in Arkansas somewhere cross over in there  and he [didn't] had
[know.] her to where she couldn't walk, she couldn't raise [her arm] her hand up over her 
head; she couldn't walk. And she [didn't have -- she went up to town] had thought it was a misery in her side or something like that

he put her down; she say, "I can't walk." And when she say, "I
can't walk," Uncle Tom say, "You [can] ? walk." [And says, "Come walking

& there in his office - he didn't let nobody else back in there but him & her & after he and her back in there, she showed him where the pain started from. Well, he
put plaster on [the] her side and as the pain moved, that plaster, [he] it would
come loose. And after that pain [leased] leave that plaster come loose, til
all that pain left that plaster would fall right off.
