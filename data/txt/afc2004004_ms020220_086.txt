so my head wasn' move. I's jus' pickin' the berries, puttin' 'em
in the bucket. See?
     An' so, Mama said, "Let me see what kind a bug is this." An'
she pulled the bush. When she pulled the bush, I looked you see? Just as
I looked, he come right by my face.
     I looked right in his mouth! I seed his teeth. I looked --
He come jus' like that. I said, "Oh, Lawd, Mama, there he is."
     An' looked like, I didn' know what it... jus' a great big ball,
then, ya see? But when he's stretched out, he's stretched out a
snake; I seed it.
     An' Mama jus' gave one holler. Well, she jus' see the big
thing come up out the bushes. See, he was in there. He come
right by my face. I looked right in his mouth. Ya see, [Mama] by my head 
[had] jus' turnt to he'p her look, see?, that's jus', got off the
track.
     He cain't, he cain't turn his track. What he go after, he
cain't turn this way or that way. An' he see sumpin', he got to
hit that dead at it. He -- when, when, when he go on his, his
lick, [ya know], [he] if you jus' angle, you done missed him. I can say
that for sure. Huhm, know!
     An' I was eight years old, an' I ain't picked a huckleberry
for nobody under Heaven since! I don't go in the bush. If a 
berry aside the road an' I see it, I git it if I want. An' I'm gonna
look well then.
