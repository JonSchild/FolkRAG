TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Music Division

As you know, Miss Helen Hartness Flanders has been planning
for sometime to sponsor a Library recording trip in Vermont. She
has gone to a great deal of trouble to arrange an itenerary for me
between the 3rd and 5th of November (see correspondence file for
this trip). I suggest that a new recording machine be purchased
and since the time is too short to look into another model, perhaps
a Presto portable with a one B cutter and a lever mechanism for
lowering the needle would be advisable. I shall be in New York until 
it is time for me to leave for Vermont and will be glad to assist in 
the purchase of the machine at the Presto factory. I recommend
further the purchase of 400 green seal Presto recording blanks and 
6 sapphire cutting needles. The blanks will be necessary for the 
field trip and should also suffice for our duplication work for the
next two or three months.
