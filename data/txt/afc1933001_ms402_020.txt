NEGRO SPIRITUALS


Oh, he call you by de lightnin'
An' he call you by de t'under
An' he call you by de middle night cry

O come home, come home, come home, my Fadder's children
Come home; come home! An' he ain't got weary yet!

The songs enclosed are those I can fully remember, they
are some of those sung by the members of my father's two large
Negro congregations in Orangeburg and Barnwell.  I hope the place
of honor will be given to Come Home, my Father's Children.  It is
grand, but if you could have it as I did, rolling from five
hundred splendid voices at once, with all the fervor and unction
of emotional natures, then a pause, then the leader crying out an
improvised stanza, "Come home while the gate is open," or "Come
back to your bleeding Savior," or anything of that sort, when the
rest would take it up, some crying, some clapping, some shouting,
until suddenly out of the crowd would rush first one and then
another, and another, and fall down before the altar as ponitents,
while the leader would continue: He call you de lightnin',"
until the bass seemed the very thunder tones, and the whole song to
illustrate that awful storm which called the sinner back to God.
The effect of such a scene was tremendous, and it is as a real to me
now as when, as a child of six, I revelled in it.
