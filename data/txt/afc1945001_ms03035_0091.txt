Rumor: Patient employed at the Bomber Plant informed me of the installations
of air conditioning and individual lockers which appeared (at this time) 
to be an unnecessary expenditure of money and vital materials. The air- 
conditioning equipment includes conduits, electric motors and fans, and 
the amount of metal for the lockers, used mostly for hanging coats and 
hats, seems disproportionate in view of its necessity in more urgent 
fields.
