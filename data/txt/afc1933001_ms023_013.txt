Mr. John A. Lomax,

My dear Mr, Lomax,

      I was much interested in your letter with 
regard to songs popular among our prison women
but I fear, I can be of little assistance to you
in your quest as I have been unable to find any
copies in our files. Some years ago, before the
transfer of the Federal prisoners, who at that
time formed a large part of our population, a
number of such songs were current among them,
spirituals being especially popular among them,
spirituals being especially popular among the
negro women. Among the white women, a certain
song dealing with life in a New York jail (with
which many of them seemed to be familiar) was
a favorite. I cannot now recall any of the words
nor have I been able to find anyone here who remembers
them.
It is possible that some of our former prisoners
may still be at the Federal Industrial Institution
at Alderson, West Virginia, and that
through them you may be able to secure copies of
both the spirituals and the other songs referred
to. I am sorry that I can be of so little help
to you.

Sincerely yours,
Anna C. Anderson
Superindent.
