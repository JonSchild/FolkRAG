I ain' gonna let him come no where.
OOOOH yes.
OOOOH yes.
Some I'm gonna see up there.
Early in the mornin', Christians
When the warrior will have escaped Hell.
Descent in Hell.
And he shall remain there a thousand yrs.
One thing I wanta do when I get there.
I wanta see Abraham, [*[140]*]
Isaac an' Jacob
I wanta see Nehemiah
An' his gospel hammer
I wanta see Jeremiah
I want a see Job
Horses pawin' in the valley
I wanta see [them] him
That's been sleepin' yonder
When the dry bones [*neck bone*]
I want a see Amos, Hoseah an' an' Joel
I wanta see Habekah
Sepheniah an Zacharias
?mos Hoseah an Joel
?tthew Mark Luke an' John
Oh Yes.
?anta get in there.
?nta see Jesus
?n that died for me. [*(145]*]
