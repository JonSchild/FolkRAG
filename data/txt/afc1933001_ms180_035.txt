Dear Miss Carlisle:

In response to your note of March 9, the Archive of American Folk Song has been
in existence since 1928. It was first under the direction of Dr. Robert Gordon
who accumulated a very valuable collection of manuscript and dictaphone cylinders.
In 1933, my father, John A. Lomax, was made Curator and since that time practically
the entire effort of the Archive has been devoted to field recordings on disks of
American folk songs. At the present time we have about 25,000 folk songs and folk
tales on records gathered from all over the South, New England, the Middle West
and West, the West Indies and now, recently, from South America.

Since 1933 I have been Assistant in Charge of the Archive and have about divided
the recording work with my father. Recently we have been in a position to loan
our equipment to competent collectors in various parts of the country, such people
as Herbert Halpert, Ivan Walton, John Work, Vance Randolph, etc. The entire
project is  a part of regular Library of Congress activity in the Music Division.

The usefulness of the collection was greatly enhanced two years ago by a 
Carnegie grant which enabled us to build a very fine recording laboratory
and studio in which high quality recording can be done and, best of all, where
our field records can be duplicated for the use of students and the pleasure
of interested American citizens. Through this laboratory, copies of original
field recordings can be purchased and, due to the size of the collection, almost
any type of American folk song in English and in a number of foreign 
languages may be obtained on request.

The accumulation of the material has gone on at such a rapid rate that it 
has been impossible to make accurate surveys such as the one suggested in 
your question about child ballads. I can tell you that we have a great number 
of child ballads, somewhat in their due proportion in the community in
relation to other types of folk songs. If you are interested, I will send
you a copy of our checklist of American folk songs in the Archive which is
shortly to be published.

I should very much like to have clip sheets of this story when it is published.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
