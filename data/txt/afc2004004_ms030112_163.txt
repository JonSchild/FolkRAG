LARRY:
I  was thinking yesterday about Brother Davis, I was thinking about him up there in the Bronx and I was coming up there taking lessons one day I was sitting down there and he was, he was teaching me something, I think he was teaching me about the A cord and all of that and I'm just sitting there straining trying to make this cord and I just don't know how to make this cord, no kinda way and he, you know how he would put the guitar, in the front of him and he would lean over, he leaned over like he was asleep, and I'm sitting there just straining and straining and I looked up at him you know and I knowed he was asleep you know and I can't make this cord. I said Hey Brother Davis WAKE UP, WAKE UP. He raised up his head and said I'm wider awake than you. And then he started playing. I know I thought he was asleep there but when he raised up and said I'm wide awake. And he had pretty good health too, almost all his life.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes. Pretty good. Should a went to the doctors, I couldn't get him to go, you know how things pile up on you, you know I did my best.
