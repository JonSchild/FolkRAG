will help show the kind of information 
wanted or needed. Here again it might be 
worthwhile to note the discrepancies of content.

e. Sources which contribute to or counteract 
attitudes or climates of opinion influencing 
rumor production and distribution.

f. Cases in which no sources are related to the 
rumors (except possibly very indirectly).

Enemy Sources Analysis

The possible contributions of the Enemy Sources Section 
to a study of "rumors" in the United States
include (a) assistance in the determination of the
origin of the "rumor", (b) assistance in determining 
the seriousness of the"rumor" by furnishing information
on the part which it is playing in Axis propaganda,
(c) furnishing instructions to field agents on 
what to look for on the basis of "rumors" Axis propagandists
seem to be trying to "plant" or spread and 
(d) making it possible to point out in an information 
campaign on "rumors" that certain rumors are of Axis 
origin or are given currency by the Axis in order to 
discredit such "rumors."

If organized as suggested such a study would have a number 
of values supplementary to those listed above.

1. It might be useful in piloting special field studies 
by Intensive Surveys into areas that seem to be the 
focus of special problems.

2. It might be useful in piloting general attitude studies 
either by interview techniques on national samples 
or any other approach that seems most desirable.

3. It would provide a base to aid in evaluating Axis 
propaganda strategy.

4. It might render services to other agencies, including 
suggestions for counteraction. 

5. It should provide additional insights into the state 
of American opinion on various issues.

It is proposed that the final processing of this study will 
take the form of a series of special reports:

1. These recommendations.

2. A special report on the field study by the Intensive 
Surveys Division.
