7.
The old woman hearing her son say so,
It filled her mind with grief and woe:
"We must contrive, send her away
For to be a slave in Amerikee."

On Monday morning Madam arose,
"Betsy, Betsy, pack up your clo'es,
For I am going some friends to see,
And no-one but Betsy shall go with me."

They went till they came to a seaport town,
Where ships were sailing up and down.
A boat was hailed, and in she went,
And the poor girl sailed with a discontent.

A few days later the old woman returned;
"oh, you're welcome home, mother," cried her son,
"You're welcome home mother, on every side,
But where is Betsy, the servant maid?"

"Oh son, oh son, oh son," said she,
"Your chief delight is on [eht] sea.
I would rather see my son lay dead,
Than you should wed with the servant maid."

A few days later her son fell sick,
So sick in bed, so sad was he,
Nothing would cure him that could be tried;
He called for Betsy, and then he died.
