Dear Fletch,

Will you please send me the records you made for us and send
them right away. We need to close our accounts in this matter as 
soon as possible. 
Will you please send me the pamphlet copy pronto, if not 
sooner. The printing problem is going to be a hell of a headache
and may delay the whole matter by weeks and weeks. The sooner you
act the better. Especially as I shall be away a good deal from
now on and shall want to have the album out of the way before
I go.
I know you're busy as the devil and conquering tougher
problems than I have every day, but I'm counting on you for this
stuff and I need it at once.
Will you accept revisions without submission of copy until
the proof stage.
The continuing committee meets this Wednesday evening in
rump session. I'll letvyou know what comes of it. In the meantime,
my respects to you and yours and your enterprises.

Alan
