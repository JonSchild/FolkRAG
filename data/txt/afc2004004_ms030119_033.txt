REEL XIII

     . . .There's sumpin I want now, but I'm not gon say it.
I'm kina like Ahab when he went to neighbor's fur a piece of
ground.  He tole him his wife, Jezebel, that he wanted that piece
of ground, an he wadn't gon be satisfied till he got it.  She made
a way fur him to git it.
      (Jezebel did?)
      Yes she did.
      (How did she do that?)
     She writ letters to the people the neighbors dealt
with, an got em against him; an they took him out on the edge of
the city, an they kilt him.  But she sent Ahab away fore they kilt
him, so they wouldn't put it on Ahab.  An then she written Ahab bout
the death of the neighbors, an tole him to come an possess the
land, cause the neighbors was not livin, but was dead. He come back an got his
men together, to survey the land off, to take it.  God overheard
the question an sent Elijah to hide himsef down theah in the bottom
of the field.  An while Ahab was layin off the field, he run upon
Elijah down theah.  See, Elijah was a 'tector.  God's detector.
He catch up wid Ahab.  Ahab was arrested, was tried, and received
his sentence.  An he was killed, him an his wife both.  Jes like
(?) Nabos was killed.  Nabos was killed, the dogs licked up his blood.
Ahab was killed, him an his wife, an the dogs eat up all of huh but
huh hans.  All but the palms of huh hands.  Cause that was meat too
dirty fur the dogs to eat.  Yo hans is the dirties part there is about
yo u.
     (The dogs won't eat your h ands?)
     It's not a matter bout that.  I see you don't understan.
