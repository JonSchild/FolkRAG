A Rumor I Heard About This War

A lady told my mother
several weeks ago which was on
a Saturday that the government
will start rationing clothing
at midnight.  I did not believe it
and said if the government was
going to ration clothing, it would
be on the radio telling us in detail
about the rationing setup.  Furthermore
how would this particular lady
know more about rationing than
the "News Commentators" who are "on
the inside."  In Sunday's paper
there was an article saying that
rationing clothing was a wild 
rumor.  I was right.
