Joke

During Army maneuvers in Lousiana 
recently, a little old lady from a farm 
nearby started to cross a bridge and was 
stopped by a sentry. "You can't cross 
here", he said, "The bridge is demolished."

The lady stared at the bridge in 
front of her. "Why, I don't see anything 
wrong with it."

"It's demolished, I tell you," the sentry 
shouted. "You can't cross."

The lady exasperated turned to another 
soldier standing near-by. "It isn't 
really demolished is it?"

"Don't ask me, lady," the soldier said.
