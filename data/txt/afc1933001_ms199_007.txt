Dear Rae:

About a month ago I wrote you requesting information 
regarding payments made to Hobart Smith.
As Hobart again requests this information for 
his Social Security benefits, would you be kind
enough to send it along to me....Also, if you 
have Blaine Stubblefield's present address, I
would very much like to have it from you.

Thanks a lot.
