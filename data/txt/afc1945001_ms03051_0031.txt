Knoxville, Tennessee

Oct. 7. "I heard of the first real sabotage in this locality. My visitor
told me of someone placing something in the machinery and wrecking
a portion of it. This occurred at the Fulton Slyphon Co.
Her husband was called in to replace the machinery. I understand
the guilty man was arrested and taken to Washington."
