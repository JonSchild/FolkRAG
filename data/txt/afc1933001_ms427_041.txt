THE MARSEILLAISE   [[title underlined]]

Ye sons of France, awake to glory!
Hark! hark! what myriads bid you rise!
Your children, wives and grandsires hoary,
Behold their tears and hear their cries!
Behold their tears and hear their gries!
Shall hateful tyrants, mischief breeding,
With hireling hose, a ruffian band,
Affright and desolate the land,
While peace and liberty lie bleeding?

To arms! to arms, ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! March on!
All hearts resolv'd
On victory or death!

Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling,
Which treach'rous Kings confed'rate, raise;
The dogs of war, let loose, are howling,
And lo! our fields and cities blaze;
And lo! our fields and cities blaze;
And shall we basely view the ruin,
While lawless force with guilty stride
Spreads desolation far and wide,
With crime and blood his hands embruing?

To arms! To arms, ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! March!
All hearts resolv'd
On victory or death!

O Liberty! can man resign thee,
Once having felt thy gen'rous flame?
Can dungeons, bolts or bars confine thee,
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?
Or whips thy noble spirits tame?
Too long the world has wept bewailing
That  falsehood's dagger tyrants wield,
But freedom is our sword and shield,
And all their arts are unavailing.

To arms! to arms, ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on!  March on!
All hearts resolv'd
On victory or death!
