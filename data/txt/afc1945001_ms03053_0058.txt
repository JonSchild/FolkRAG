     "Grazing Service short wave stations are still announcing their
positions despite specific orders to desist. Lots of Japs in this state and
there is no reason why we should be letting them know where our short wave sets
are located." (Clerk in District Grazier's office)

     "All the Brigham boys up at Fort Lewis (Washington) are writing
letters home and saying that they're getting ready to ship overseas." (Farmer)

     "I just got a letter from ___ __________ saying they were shipping
to San Francisco and that from there it would probably be Australia." (Soda

     "The Japs up here are scared to death that they are going to be
run off into concentration camps. A lot of them got hysterical when they
received a circular from the War Relocation Authority. It was really nothing,
but some of the older ones aren't very literate and they about went crazy until
their kids set them straight. One old Japanese woman moving up here from Helper
where they've stopped the Japs from working in the mines saw the Utah Quartermaster
Depot from her train window and got the idea that it was a concentration
camp and all the Japs were going to be hauled into it, stood up against the wall
