For the general purposes outlined
above and for the occasional purchase of 
albums of phonograph records not
obtainable as gifts, I believe that a 
sum of about $12,000 will be necessary.
I realize, however, that with reduced appropriations it may not 
seem advisable to set aside [such] the 
full sum at the moment.  I should like 
to recommend, therefor, that an allotment 
of $3000 be made for the documentary
recording outlined in 1 above and for occasional
purchases of phonograph records but at the 
same time I should like to express the 
hope that I [will] shall be allowed to make 
recommendations for the other projects described 
above to be charged to the general funds 
available to the Library and that [th]
such recommendations will be favorably
considered.
