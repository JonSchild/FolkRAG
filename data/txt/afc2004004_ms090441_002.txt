Our father,
OUR FATHER,
Our father,
OUR FATHER,
We call you our father
Because you said that when we pray
To say, "Our father."
We feel that thou art our father,
OUR FATHER, 
Because you created us
In your image and after your likeness,
PRAY NOW.
Our father
OUR FATHER,
Which art in Heaven,
We adore thee
Because thou art high,
Thou art exalted
And Thou rages,
YES YES
Hallowed be thy name,
LORD HAVE MERCY
We know Your name is sweet
And we learned how you were--
At your name every man must bow 
And tongues must confess.
Thy kingdom come,
[(]O YES[)]
Thy presence here in Clarksdale
Is a dem-on-stration!
That we are doing our best
[Yes] YES
To lift [thee] up thee, 
That your kingdom might come on earth...
As it is in heaven.
Give us day by day
FATHER
Our daily bread,
Feed our bodies.
We pray for food.
Our souls need heavenly food.
And we learn that you're the giver.
Give food for Hungry souls.
Father in heaven, fill us with grace.
We can carry your majesty
Condigned in a perishing world
Friends, we come from all parts of the state,
Trying to lift up that kingdom
Which feels the need of thee
And we're asking for the guidance of the Holy Spirit
We pray that Thou would take hold of everything.
