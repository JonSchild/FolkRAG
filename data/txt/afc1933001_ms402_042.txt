Mr. T. W. Higginson, commenting on the following line: "I'll
lie in de grave and stretch out my arms", says: "Never, it seems to me,
since man first lived and suffered, was his infinite longing for peace
uttered more plaintively than in that line."

I know moonlight, I know starlight,
I lay dis body down,
I walk in de moonlight, I walk in de starlight,
I lay dis body down.
I know de graveyard, I know de graveyard,
When I lay dis body down.
I walk in de graveyard, I walk troo de graveyard
To lay dis body down.

Jes' so de tree fall, jes' so it lie,
Jes' so de sinner lib, jes' so he die,
Before dis time another year I may be gone
And in some lonesome graveyard, Oh Lrd how long?

Satan and Hell to the Negro are real, almost visual entities;
not abstractions of the mind, but a real person to be resisted and
fought, and a real place to be shunned:

Ef you want to see old Satan run
Jes' fire off dat Gospel gun.

Ole Satan is a liar an' a conjurer, too
An' if you don't mind he'll conjure you.

Ole Satan lak a snake in the grass,
Always in some Christian's path.

Ole Satan is mad an' I am glad,
He missed the soul he thought he had.

I met old Satan in my way;
He say: "Young man, you too young to pray."

What Ole Satan grumblin' about
He's in Hell and can't get out.
