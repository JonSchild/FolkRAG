Lomax: It's rather different country from anything else in
England, Bob. Can you tell me why?
Robts: Why it's different?
Lomax: Yeah. How it's different.
Robts: I think the main reason is the rivers. The place is
interlaced with tidal creeks and low lying land,
backed by good farm land further up the reaches.
Consequently you could never run a railway along
the coast there - it was impossible to build the fa st
services you have down to the South and West coast.
You couldn't even build a decent road because it had
to wander all over the damn place and through mud
and low land. Things had to stay as they were. The
original methods were the best, and the people who
liked living there, stayed there. There have been
very few changes in the population - with the
exception of the coming of the weavers from Holland
and Belgium.
Lomax: But, God - that's a long time ago, isn't it?
Robts: Yes, that's a long time ago -- but they settled
round Mersey and into Sudbury, where they still do
weaving. That's the main industry round West Suffolk
you know, is weaving. They do it all; there's no
business there, there's no factories there -- they
do it all in their houses.
Lomax: Still?
Robts: Yes. They go in their houses an do it. Each man has
a loom in his own room. He does it at home, and then
the buyer comes and takes the stuff. There's no big
business factory - it's still done in the old style.
Lomax: But your kind of people were all seamen or smugglers
and all that sort of thing, weren't they?
Robts: I'm afraid so, yes. It's a great place for smuggling
yousee, because in the days of the Excise-men, before
the Customs and Excise were combined, the Excise-men
couldn't get about from place to place because of
these creeks. As long as you knew -- as long as the
smuggler knew which creek the Excisemen were at,
they'd only got to go to another creek, or another
river, and they couldn't croos over in time to get
them. And in any case, the whole population was in
