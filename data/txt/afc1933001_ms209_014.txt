Dear Alan :
1. I do not know
who "Buck" is who is 
"pushing" with you for
the Writers' Project's Folklore 
collection.
2. I suggest that 
you allow me to handle 
all applications for 
the use of material
from our Ballad books.
This arrangement would 
save you from  any
possible embarrassment 
as a public official
