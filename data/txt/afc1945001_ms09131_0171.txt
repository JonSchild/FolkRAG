1. Chapter 13: Revelations in the Bible has
a story about a world conqueror whose number
is 606. I've also heard that there is an old
alphabet that gives numbers to letters beginning
A - 100
B - 101
C - 102, etc. so that if you take the numbers
of H - I - T - L - E - R , they add up to 606. This
is a supposed to be a sort of prophecy that Hitler
will rule the world. I heard this before U. S. 
entered the war, but never again since that time.

2. There's the saying that goes something like
this: "Bring in scrap and slap a Jap."
