"OVER THERE," A LITTLE BIT OF WHOOPEE
Tune: Johnnie, Get Your Gun, Get Your Gun.
Farmer take your grain, take your grain, take your
    grain,
Put it on the train, on the train, on the train.
Never stop it 'til it falls on the Union Terminal.

Chorus--
Never stop, never stop, give her gas, let her go, give
    her gas,
'Till we reach a cost price, won't that be quite nice
We'll break that economic vice.
Lift your lip, we can whip, never whine, all is thine,
    let her rip,
We'll keep shipping, we're sure of whipping and we'll
    zip, zip, zip
With the Farmer Union whip.

Farmer, take your steers, take your steers, take your
    steers,
Punch them on the rears, on the rears, on the rears,
Never stop 'til they appear on our Union yard frontier.

Farmer, take your mon, take your mon, take you mon,
Start it on the run, on the run, on the run,
For our own insurance fund; we'll win if this is done.

Farmer boost the U., boost the U., boost the U.,
It depends upon you, upon you, upon you,
It will save you if you do. There's not time to boo, boo,
    boo.

Farmer, don't give up, don't give up, dont' give up,
Don't whine like a pup, like a pup, like a pup,
Clutch your fist and life your head, never die until
    you're dead.
