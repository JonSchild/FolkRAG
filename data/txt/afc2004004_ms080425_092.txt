Mr. R: 168, in the alto here at the chorus -- the first one is
sharped -- well, the next one is automatically sharped, too.
But when you get out of that measure, you're done; just
the measure in which the sharp falls. On 18 is the transposition
of the keys in sharps and flats, major and minor.
When you work in the keys, you always count up five, or
down four for your key note, and you always sharp or flat
mi to get your new key. In flats you would carry the mi
over ... if you notice here in flats, the first flat is
B flat ... in the key of C [X], the natural key of C of fa,
...well the B would be your mi; so you'd move your flat
over, then you'd count up five and you got your keynote
which is F. In learning to transpose the keys, it's not
necessary to learn to sing. A person can learn to sing and
not even know what key he's singing in...as long as you
got those three main characteristics that I called out --
ime and accent, tonality, and the power of the high or low
or softness of the tone. Let's run up and down the scale, 
can everyone see it from there?
(fa sol la fa sol lo mi fa fa mi la sol fa la sol fa)
(all singing...)
Look at page 23, we're gonna sing "The Far lar(??)"
All this bunch here, and the first row, will sing the
first part (bar?) . All the rest of you back there will
sing the second part. When we get in a square we'll do it
again with a full part; but here we'll just do it with 2 part.
Now what key is this "Far lar (?)" in somebody? We got
a B flat, but that's not your key note ... what would your
key note be? F, that's right.

All sing: "There's a ringing what's the matter?....." (a round)
