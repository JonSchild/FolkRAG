Dear Mary Bonelli: 
If your friend the Reverend is 
preaching nowadays, it will be possible 
for us to come out and record him. I 
have been out of town on field trips 
ever since your letter got here, and one 
attempt to answer it from the field 
proved abortive. I certainly appreciate 
your interest, and I am anxious to hear 
the man. If I don't hear from you I will 
go out to visit him one Sunday anyhow. 
Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
