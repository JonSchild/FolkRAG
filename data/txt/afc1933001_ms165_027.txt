schooled with extraordinarily intelligible diction in several languages,
and with convincing capacity of projection of the drama."

poise and a ready command of gesture . . . each selection is delivered with
all the finesse and talent of a rare artist."   - Louisville Times

an audience that was spellbound by her deftness and exquisite characterization."  - Reading, Pa.

which for her years is remarkable, gives both truth and great assurance
to her characterization. We like best of all her control of sheer beauty."

well-chosen items."   ENGLAND - London Evening Chronicle
