[*AL*] Now, we talked about your father a little bit. 
Lets talk about your Ma. 
Now my mother was a quiet, Christian 
person. I never saw her take a drink of
nothing and I never saw her drunk; she 
never used no bad language with us as raising
us. She always was calm and when she 
told you something she meant that. If 
[*What if you didn't do it*]
you didn't do it, then she whips you and, 
she didn't beat you to death she 
whip you. The worst whipping that
my mother gave me--There was a man
name Joe [Ross?] and which about 
15 yrs later, he was my stepfather; 
after my father got killed she
married he him. He had a pistol--
a 32-20--and hed take to his house
and he put it between the quilt.
[and] instead of the two sheets on
this bed. and he went to his house
and he look for it but every time he
turn the quilt back he would
turn the pistol back. And he said 
that I had stoled it. [An] He went
to the house, he told my mother. All
of em called me son. He said "
Son you done stoled my pistol
