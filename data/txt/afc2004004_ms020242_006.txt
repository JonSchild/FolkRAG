AL: Who was she, that saw the spirits?
BJ: Who, Sylvie? She, she, she was ah, Mama's cousin, too. But
she was one I didn't know until I was, 'till I was grown. See,
Mama foun' 'er, um-hum. See, she died with Mama, down in Millen.
An' um, she see things, she didn' care nothin' about it. She take,
could get out (?) here an' walk, if she know her way out of town,
she goin' out of here, anywhere she wants go, don't care how dark
it is or where it at. Never did worry 'er. Great goodness alive!
I mean she ain't, she ain't scared of man now beast, hum! Just
go right on. Ain't nothin' ever bother 'er.
An' so this bad church up there. Up there, the white folks'
church up there near, near Millen? The peoples, they won't go
by there late at night 'cause things'll crawl all across the
road, you know. You know, all kind noise, all kinda spirits'll
worry 'em, ya know. An' Sylvie passed by there one night by
herself. An' we asked her, "How in the world did you do it?"
Sylvie said, "Ain't nothin' bother me. 'Cept a great, big,
ol' dawg come across the road an' I told 'im to git out my way."
Hum! We asked her, "Did he git out of the way?"
"No. I wen' around 'im. I kep' a-walkin'. I was gonna
step on 'im. He was..." You know, you know, you keep walkin',
you know, they just that same distant ahead a ya right on an'
on ya know. Ya cain't step on anything. So she walked right on.
TL: This was a bad church?
BJ: No, the church ain't bad. Just a whole lot a ol' spirits
around there bad. You know. That's a old place, ah, out, out
from ah, Fitzgerald out there. On the side a the highway road.
It's a white folks' church, but all back, all around it, is
buried 'way back in slaves, all kinda graves there, ya know?
