Dear Professor Cox, 

In compiling the second volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs
my son and I plan to include a version of "The Vance Song" collected a summer ago
in Kentucky.  The text of this version is, however, incomplete, and I write to ask
you permission to reprint five or six of the stanzas from your book.  We will certainly 
appreciate your help on that score. 

Very sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax,
Curator of Folk Song
Library of Congress

Kind regards always to you

Dear Mr. Lomax:
It gives me genuine
pleasure to grant this request. 

Sincerely yours, 
John H. Cox
