of those who expressed an opinion on sugar rationing were in favor of
it also. However, there was a representative group which criticised the
method of rationing but which approved of sugar rationing. The criticism
was uniformly an objection to the announcement of the intention to ration
sugar before anything was to be done about it, thereby precipitating a
buying rush. Another interesting criticism is the comment of a confectionery 
shop proprietor:

"Thinks the control of sugar will hurt his business since he
is new in business and understands that the rationing of sugar is to be
made on a percentage of last years consumption."

Out of 94 people interviewed and commenting on rationing or
price administration, 37 were male, white, and under 45 years of age; 43
were male, white, and over 45 years of age; only 11 females were interviewed
––3 under 45 years and 3 over 45 years; only 3 non-whites were
interviewed.

This poll can hardly be considered representative because of
the relatively small number of females and non-white persons interviewed.
It does have significance, however, both to the price program and the
rationing program. The criticism of the rationing program seems to have
been well considered, and may prove to be of value. The large percentage
of those knowing nothing about the price program would seem to indicate
a necessity for intensified educational activity.
