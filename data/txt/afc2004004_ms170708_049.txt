I loved that girl with all my heart, loved her as I love my life,
An' in the other part of the year I made her my lawful wife.
I never told her of her faults, yet never intend to do,
Yet many a time when she winks and smiles I think of the foggy dew.

Lomax: Where'd you get that one, Harry?
Cox: I learnt it about here, people singin' it.
Lomax: Not from your father?
Cox: No. He wouldn't ha' known it. He never sang it. Oh, he knew -
I do know some bad songs.
Kennedy: It's notlike on the wireless.
Lomax: No.
Cox: I do know some bad uns.
Lomax: They don't sing it that way on the wireless, Harry.
Cox: No. They sing it different to that - I've heard it - I
don't. . .that ain't nothing - this is the best. That is the song.
I think that's all o' it, too. How was that part? (laughs)
Lomax: Oh, it's a beauty.
Cox: (laughs)
Lomax: You haven't got another one along that line, have you,
Harry? Carry on.
Cox: I dursn't sing what I know.
Lomax: Oh, go ahead. It doesn't matter.
