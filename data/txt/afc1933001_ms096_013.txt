COPY OF LETTER ENCLOSED BY MRS. RUBY P. TARTT AND FORWARDED TO
JOHN LOMAX

Livingston, Ala.,
Dec. 5, 1942

Dear Mrs. Tartt:

I'm writing for Doc Reed. His foot is giving him a good
deal of trouble and he is wanting you to write Mr. John Lomack.
I believe is what I make out of it, so he can go to the
hospital.

I'm afraid if he doesn't watch out he may lose a toe or 
maybe a foot.

Respt.

Mrs. C. C. Boyd
