When I was single my
pocket would gingle and I
wished I was single 
again My wife she died
Oh then. My wife she died
and I laught till cried and I
wish I was single again -
eWll I married me another
one oh then I married
me another one - she
was worst than the
other - one and I wish I
was single again.
Cephas A. Harris.
