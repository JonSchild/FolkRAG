Chief Clerk
April 18, 1939

In all trips for the purpose of recording folk songs, 
it is impossible to specify every point which the collector 
may visit. Authorization is given only for a 
general region and it is assumed that the collector will 
follow all leads and make any stop-overs on the way which 
may result in an addition to the collection of folk song 
recordings in the Library. On his last trip, Mr. Lomax 
heard of some good material in Chicago and, since it was 
not at all out of the way, acted correctly in stopping 
there on official business.
