By way of summary,  let us review a sample from the series of
British stories.  First it must be emphasized that rumors reported
were not based on a " representative" sample of the people of the nation
nor a fair sample of the nation's rumor reservoir.  They tend to be
chiefly of the sort that are inappropriate from the point of view of
the war effort-- due, perhaps, to the selective awareness of our reporters.

          The rumors reflect resentment against England; a feeling of
lack of identity of war aims; and lack of confidence in British admin-
nistrative ability, military ability, general trustworthiness.  To a
large extent the pattern of the rumors corresponds to the negative part
of the prevailing attitude toward the British as reflected in an earlier
Bureau survey,  though of course this rumor study cannot estimate the
prevalence of the attitudes revealed.

A.  There will be war between England and the U. S.

          " England is just trying to get all our boys trapped in
            Britain where they'll be slaughtered and then England
            and Germany will gang  up against the United States."
             (Oregon)

B.  It is England's War

            "England got us into this war --- and the last one."  (Wisc.)

C.  At any rate,  there is a difference between England's War and ours.

             " I am not pro-German,  but England has got to be beaten
               in this war,  she has sneaked out of everything for too
               long."  (Massachusetts)

D. The British are not working efficiently.

             " Something is definitely wrong with England's management
                of the war, they are holding back."  (Missouri)

E.  British bungling characterizes relation to colonies.

            "England has demonstrated a lack of capability in
             administration of an empire.  This is proven by the
             fact that she does not enjoy the same loyalty from 
             her colonial troops as the United States has received
             from native Philippine troops."  (Arizona)

F.   The British have personal characteristics and habits which prevent
       them from being good allies.

            " How can England expect to win battles with her boys
              drinking whisky and playing cricket behind the lines? "
              (Alabama)

             " The English have had Rommel in a corner twice but both
                times they have stopped for tea instead of finishing
                their job."  (Arizona)
