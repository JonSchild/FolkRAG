fish!  They was all kinds.  'Cause they would drive 'em up.
An' you see schools of pompous drivin' that way, you jus' go up
ahead of 'em -- you know, if they drivin' 'em into a lil' neck 
a water -- an' ah, you could do that.
An' one day -- I liked to go fishin' down there.  It's the
first time I fished on Sunday, was down there.  An' I was a
scared child!  You goin' along with other peoples, you do what
other folks doin', ya know?  An' I didn' wanta stay [at] to the
place by myse'f an' so I went on down with all the crowd.  They wan'ed
[was goin'] to go fishin', so...They would git down, climb down this
ladder, ya know?  An', an' go down to -- on that lil', you know,
I call it a table, where that trestle turns around there.  An'
[so] a lot of the mens would, ya know; but we ol' ladies would
stay up, up an' throw over an' fish, ya know.  If anything should
happen, why they could pull it up, you know, for us, ya know?
Get hung or anything.
So I was fishin' an' I pulled up for -- Oow, I had a great
pull.  An' I wanted to pull 'im.  An' he was, he was comin' up.
It was on a Sunday. And I hadn't thought about it when I pulled him
up, about it bein' Sunday.  But I had thought about it at all
other times.  Thinkin' it was the Sabbath an' about this was
wrong, but I [jis'] didn', an' I didn' fished on Sunday.  So I
pulled this big, ol' fish up.  Oh, he was a big'n!  He weighed
11 pounds an' sumpin'.  I pulled that thing up there an' got him up, up [the] by the
time I [top,] got 'im on the, on the track up there an' lay 'im down,
he said, "Boom-da-da-da, boom-da-da-da, doo-la-la, doo-la-la."
Great goo'ness alive!  I said, "Throw 'im back!  Throw 'im back!
He's talkin'!"  I was so scared...Oow dear
