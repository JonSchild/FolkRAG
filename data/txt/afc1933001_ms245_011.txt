Dear Alan:

1. Again I must apologize
for so frequently interrupting
your busy life. I can
lay off soon, I hope.

2. I have asked Macmillan to send
you two copies and Mrs. Seeger
two copies of our six complementary
Our Singing Countrys.

3. I am also asking them
to send you the bill for
the amount due them for extra
corrections in the text on your proof
recordings. I do this so that you
can know in detail what the
charges were and discuss with
them the matter of extra charges
