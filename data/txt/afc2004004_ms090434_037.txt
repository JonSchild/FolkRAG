Mattson News
By M. Williams
Well another bright new day
is born to us which dates the
fifth day of January the new
year.  I am thankful to the Lord
that He has abled me through
His power to be in the land

Vine M.B.C Sunday to service

True Vine has had people she 
carried excepting a funeral. Let
me tell you all God sure ain't no

how good the Lord was to us

teaches us that it's a bad wind
that don't change and a wrong
road that has no end and just

the other night we too could

away.  But God looked down on
us with an eye of pity and a tender 
compassion and changed the
wind of the tornado and spaired 
us; let us thank Him.
