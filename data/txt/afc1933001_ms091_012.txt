Sirs:

John A. Lomax, Honorary Curator of the Archive of American
Folk-song in the Library of Congress, is at this moment engaged
in making an important collection of folk songs of the
Southwest for the Archive. Mr. Lomax carries in his car a
portable recording machine and takes down from the lips of
genuine folk singers and story tellers their songs, their
stories, and the local history of the community. This material
has great scientific importance, and has proved of considerable
use in the construction of radio programs which reach
a large number of people with the message of national unity.

It is almost impossible for Mr. Lomax's work to be
carried on without the use of an automobile. He writes us
that his present tires are very badly worn and he hesitates
to embark on the trip planned for this spring without
obtaining a new set of tires and tubes. It would be a great
service to this important project and to the Library of
Congress if it would be possible for your board to give
Mr. Lomax a priority in the purchase of tires and tubes
in this instance.

Sincerely yours,
