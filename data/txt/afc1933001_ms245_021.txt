Dear Father:

I don't know if we will ever get straight about Columbia
Recording Company and CBS. You complain about Burl's recording
your songs and not paying you for it, and then you let CBS take
you for a ride on their book contract, when they would never dare
to use one of your songs on the air without your express permission.
I've been trying to tell you this for a year, but it just doesn't
seem to sink in. I am going to follow your suggestion and ask
$100.00, but you have established an awfully bad precedent.

I am sure your illness was just a temporary thing, and I'm 
glad to hear you are going so strong. Everybody was perfectly
delighted about the book, although Harold agreed with you about
the music. Mr. MacLeish I have not seen in a coon's age. Earl
Robinson, whom I saw last week-end in New York, thought the music
was the best he had ever seen, so there seem to be several opinions.

Christmas I am going to go to the Folklore Convention for the
sake of my relations with those people. I wish I could be home for
Thanksgiving dinner and a look at those brown leaves.

Keep me informed about your whereabouts so that I can let you
know about the budget when that comes through.

The checklist will be ready for binding at the end of next
week. I have just given Macmillan's an idea for a book, which I
think they will take. I will tell you much more about that later.

Love to you and Deanie,
Alan
