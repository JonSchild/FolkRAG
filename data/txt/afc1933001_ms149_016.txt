Dear Bill,
As you know, the Archive is anxious to stimulate and
participate in exchange of records, as well as to help, where
it can, in regional recording projects. It would be entirely
within our present policy and our present facilities to make
two sets of duplicates of your collection of records--one for 
the Archive and one for the University of Texas. I am afraid,
however, that you must have misunderstood me in regard to our
making a set of duplicates available for the priviledge of 
duplicating. Our policy has been: to furnish collectors who
deposited their originals with us with a set of duplicates or
to exchange a set of duplicates for another set on an equal
basis. I should add here, however, that the whole procedure
is so new that each case is considered on its individual merits.
I hardly believe that Iowa University, since it will be the eventual
repository of the originals would feel that we should make
another set of duplicates for the priviledge of duplicating its
originals, but if there are any special considerations which
make this desireable, please inform us.
Most of our 3600 odd records are unrestricted and as soon
as we have a regularly established routine of duplication, duplicates
of the material will be available for Libraries, serious
students and others. I am not able at the present to quote you
prices on such duplicates for the University of Texas, but it you 
can tell me how many records Dr. Rainey wants (outside of your
duplicates), when he wants them, etc., we will in a short time
be able to give you specific price quotations. Of course you
understand that the price quoted for both the dubs of our material
and the dubs of your material will be no more than the cost of
materials plus labor.
I am delighted to know that you are going ahead with
these plans for exchange of records. And let me repeat that if
the Archive can be of assistance, moral or material, in your
further field work, please inform me.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
