Rationing
When they started rationing sugar
that was alright,
You could get enough, but that
was very light
But when they started rationing shoes
That had passed the golden rule
I couldn't make it to church, but
I had to come to school.

Adolph Hitler
My Mondays are meatless
My Tuesdays are wheatless
I'm growing more eatless every day
My coffee is sweetless
My bed is sheetless
They've been sent to the Y.M.C.A.
My socks, they are feetless
My pants are seatless
Man how I hate Adolph Hitler.
