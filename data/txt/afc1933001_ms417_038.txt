LORD IT'S ALMOST DONE

Take these stripes from, stripes from around my shoulder
Take these chains from, chains from araound my leg
These stripes, stripes they sure don't worry me
But these chains, chains gonna kill me dead.

Chorus: Law, it's all, almost done
                  "      "    "    "     "         "
                  "     "     "        "   "       "
Nothing for to do but to bring those yellow women over here

An if it wasn't for, wasn't for my good captain
Lawd I would of, would of been gone down
But he liked my, liked my hard rollin
Then he gave me a little narrow round

She whispered, whispered to her mother
I can't see, can't how he stand
He ain't, aint but sweet sixteen
An theys drivin him, drivin him like a man

[Saya she carried, carried me into her parlour
Lawd, she cooled me, cooled me with her fan
Says she swore, she swore by the man who made her
Mother I do, do love a railroad man]

On Monday, Monday I was arrested
On Tuesday, Tuesday got locked up in Jail
On Wednesday my trial was attested
On Thursday nobody wouldn't go my bail

On Frieday me an my baby was a-walkin
On Saturday she throwed me out of doors
On Sunday me an my babe was a-talkin
On Monday she pawned all my clothes

[Needn't come here, come here buckin and jumpin
Lawd, you sho, sho can't stand
Lawd, it's ol, ol buckin and jumpin
Have been the death of many a good man]
