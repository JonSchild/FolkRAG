The Navy Seabees

    The deman for Seabees are So great
 that only volunteers are accepted.
 No one else going into the Navy is
 assigned to battalions.  Even then
 just one out of every eight volunteers 
makes the grade.
      How many men are now
 in the Seabees is a military secret,
 but the original figure has been
 multiplied many times.
       Most of the men who become
 Seabees are already skilled at some
 mechanical or building trade, and all
 they have to be taught is how to
 handle weapons and the Navy's way 
of doing things.
          The only place they are not
 expected to fight is while aboard 
ship, on the way to a new
 assignment.
