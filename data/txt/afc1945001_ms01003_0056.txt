OFFICE COMMUNICATION

To           Frank Stanton

From      Leigh White

Station

May 8, 1942

It may interest you to know that MGM has just completed
a movie short entitled "A Yardstick for Rumors", in which 
the rumor problem is attacked directly as we originally proposed 
to do ourselves. The film is now being edited and I
have been promised to be given a private showing at the end
of next week, at which time I can tell you more about it
and give you any reactions I may have as to the extent of
its success.
