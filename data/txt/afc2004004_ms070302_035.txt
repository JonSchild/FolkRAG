Lost for 2 hours in
Dorset old Cha saying ev
morn per fogged windshield
"Bugger I know ever inch 
of this country" meantime
demanding I take every wrong
turning - - -

Called to see Fred Weskitt,
once the old Bet of the Symondsbury 
Mummers -- People just lost
interest.  Not the audience
the players -- He regretted it
because he is a born comedian
A round wh heded man
with huge tender brown 
eyes wearing a sd hand army
raincoat - -  sang the shoemaker's
song
