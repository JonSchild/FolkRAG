what's the matter with John.  Set out by hisself all the time.  
So he went to the next day the old marse come in.  He got into the 
yard and come up to John.  Old Marse say, "Where's John?"  Say, "Where's 
John?"  Say, "He out there."  Say, "Tell him to come in."  John 
come in.  "Yeah, Marse?"  Say, "Tell me about the race,"  Say, "Tell 
me about the race, old boy."  Say, "I k ow you won the race."  Say, 
"Tell me about the race; tell me how you come out."

Yessir, Old Marse, I sure did, I sure did.  But I couldn't help it, 
Old Marse, Jack is too tall.  Hislegs is too long."  Say, "All right.
