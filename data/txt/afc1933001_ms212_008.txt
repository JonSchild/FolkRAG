P.S.

I have decided for the present not
to trust our precious ballad
stuff to the mails. If you
feel the urge later and have
the time, write me and I'll see.
Certainly you will want it
by you sometime for notes,
Introduction, etc. Should the
idea not be already firmly
implanted in your mind, please
be again assured that I shall
complete nothing about this
book until you have fully
consulted.
