[My mother she told me to put him to bed,
Oh, but I wouldn't have him!
I put him to bed and he stood on his head,
Wish his old shoes on and his leggin's.

Mamma told me to saddle his horse,
Oh, but I wouldn't have him!
Saddled his horse and he went North,
With his old shoes on and his leggin's.]

Here's courting song used, the folk say, at
old-fashioned parties -- a boy-girl duet, sung with blushes
and awkward country feeling:

Will you wear white, O my dear, O my dear?
Oh, will you wear white, Jennie Jenkins?
I won't wear white,
For the color's too bright,
I'll buy me a fol-de-roldy-tildy-toldy, seek-a-double,
use-a-cause-a-roll-the-find-me.
Roll, Jennie Jenkins, roll.

Will you wear blue, my dear, O my dear?
Oh, will you wear blue, Jennie Jenkins?
I won't wear blue,
The color's too true,
