     The work of the Archive has been advanced by a number of groups 
and individuals. The support of the Carnegie Corporation, the Rockefeller
Foundation, and the American Council of Learned Societies has been vital and
the labors of many individuals have created the Archive of Folk Song. But 
the fact remains that the Archive is with reason associated with John A. 
Lomax. Mr. Lomax's connection with the Library of Congress had been a close
and continuing one from the time of his appointment as Honorary Curator of
the Archive of Folk Song in 1933 to the time of his death in 1948.
     Born in Mississippi and raised in Texas, Mr. Lomax harvested much 
in the same manner that Johnny Appleseed planted. He devoted his life to the
collecting of folk song. For almost 40 years he traveled up and down and 
across the United States with notebook and recording equipment - from ranch
to cotton patch, from canal boat to penitentiary, from lumber camp to cane
brake, in search of the spontaneous songs created by the people. He possessed
a remarkable ability to meet people of all levels of society and to inspire
their friendship and confidence. The people liked to sing for Jon Lomax and
on his records there is an atmosphere of naturalness, ease, and sociability. 
Virtually all of his recordings were deposited in the Library of Congress
and form the nucleus of the great collection in the Archive today.
