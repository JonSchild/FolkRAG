[1363 Canray] p.1
Canray: He couldn't see them (unint). So he would go and
put it down, but the man knew if the accordion was in
between those two (unint)â€¦
AL: That was when Nathan Ebshar was a little boy He just 
couldn't keep his hands off his daddy's accordion!
Can: That's right...think I got a cousin of mine well,
she's got a boy playing with Clifton there. And [t]her
oldest boy, he's a real good musician too.  I remember
for Christmas we had a big dinner, at my uncle there[?].
Her oldest boy wanted one of those little Christmas
trumpets. I says, "You see that boy there? --he's going
to be a musician!" "No! No, he cant be no musician! We
can't sing no songs, neither me or his daddy." I say,
"You wanna bet some money, I guarantee you he's gonna be
a musician.  He says, "So how you know that?" [W] So when
he got into high school, he started in the band, and he got to
be very good. And all of her boys, most of them (she got
seven boys), they got six of them, they all play music. 'Cause
it's very [to] easy to understand, you see a kid take an instrument,
and just play with, well, most probably he ain't gonna be a 
musician. But if he try to change that instrument, make it
change tunes--you can be sure he's going to be a musician.
AL: Guess that's the way you were when you were a kid
Can: (Laughs) Yeah...
