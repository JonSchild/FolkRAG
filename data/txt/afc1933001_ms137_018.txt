Dear Mr. Lomax:
          The Massachusetts State Department of Education
is sponsoring a concert by the children of the rural schools
of this state and perhaps of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,
to be given at the meeting of the Eastern Music Educators' Conference
which will be held in Boston, March 14, 15, 16, 17, 1939.
          In endeavoring to arrange a program which would be
of interest to participants, to listeners, and of value musically
we decided that a program of the occupational and home songs
of various geographical areas of the United States would be rather
novel. We have no difficulty in collecting home songs of the
various areas, but we have a great deal of difficulty and practically
no success in securing occupational or labor songs.
          The divisions are:
NEW ENGLAND manufacturing, farming, forests, lumbering, fishing recreational
MIDDLE ATLANTIC farming, mining
SOUTHERN      South Atlantic States - cotton growing, peanut raising
                                                                   mountaineer songs - forests
                                                                   OIL industry
                           Gulf States - sugar and rice cultivation - shipping
                                                 (Bayou and Creole)
NORTH CENTRAL     lumbering wheat     corn belt   Chicago packing industry
SOUTH WEST     Spanish- American Songs
NORTH WEST     lumbering   raising of fruit - mining - cattle raising
                                  (Cowboy Songs)
           Thus you see we wish to secure songs of the fishing industry,
lumbering, mining, manufacturing, planting, etc. We though that we
could have a large pictorial map showing these areas and perhaps individual 
groups could be responsible for one particular song, with the entire group
joining.
                           Can you help us to secure occupational or labor songs? We
