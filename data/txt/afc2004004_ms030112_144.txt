LARRY:
Some little notes, yeah Leadbelly had some kind of red disease. What ever that is, I think at time Lou Gehrig and Lead was the only ones infected with that thing. He was a powerful man, Leadbelly. Songs he wrote and things.
MRS. DAVIS:
He still, Royalties still comes in on his songs.
LARRY:
Yeah what few there is still comes in on his songs. Thats the disgusting part about it, a man puts out such good material and then a few little royalties that was one of the reasons Brother Davis told me he didn't bother about records years ago he told me one story, this is true, about how he and Flymore Fuller come up here to make those records and the man gave him such a little bit amount of money you know and he got all the records. I forget the exact amount but it was somewhere around $17, $18 maybe $14 and I don't know what records.
MRS. DAVIS:
I don't remember him ever saying anything about that. He said it was a long time getting money from this man, but I didn't hear him say how much it was.
LARRY:
Brother Davis once told me that this fella Flymore Fuller, whats his first name? What was it?
MRS. DAVIS:
I don't remember his first name. It could a been Willy.
