Gentlemen: 

I should appreciate very much your sending us two
copies of the booklet which you have regarding the
program of Alan Lomax which is broadcast every
Tuesday afternoon at 2:30.

Alan Lomax is an alumnus of the Terrill School and
Mr. Davis and I should eat like to have this record
of his work.

Yours very truly,
John D. Kirby
