Life Insurance
1 - Provides protection, absolutely certain,
in a legal reserve, level-premium company.
2 - Sold only to farmers who are PREFERRED
risks.  Mortality rates are as low
as any existing company, therefore dividends
will be greater.
3 - Reserves are invested in first farm
mortgages.  Your money is loaned to farmers
where is belongs, and not to speculators.
4 - It is Farmer Insurance at Farmer Cost
in a friendly farmers' company, officered,
owned and controlled by farmers.
If you believe in justice and equality for the
farmer, demand Farmers Union Life Insurance.
