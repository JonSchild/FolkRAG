THE GEORGIA SEA ISLAND SINGERS
The original group of the Georgia Sea Island Singers was organized by Mrs.
Maxfield Parrish on St. Simon's Island near Brunswick, Georgia, in the 1920's.
At the time, there were no roads into the island, and the Negro communities
had been isolated and virtually self-governing since the Civil War.  The
original members of the group were all great folk singers who remembered
songs, that dated back at least a century - rowing songs, longshoremen songs,
ring games, and especially the shouts, those vigorous, rhythmic progenitors
of the spiritual.  They agreed among themselves to cultivate the "old-time
way" of singing and to admit new, younger people into the group, only if
they would conform to the tradition the group esteemed.  The present group
continues without change a tradition of singing that goes back to the roots
of American Negro music.  During three years of professional touring, the
Sea Islanders have performed for night club, folk festival, classroom and 
concert audiences, weaving the songs together with an amusing and informative 
narration.  Onstage, the powerful singers take their audience into
a stirring and unforgettable experience of the best of Negro folk life and 
music.

Newspaper reaction to the Georgia Sea Islanders:
Atlanta, Ga., 1963:  SEA ISLAND'S FOLK SINGERS TOP THE BEST:  The Georgia Sea
Island Singers dusted off an almost forgotten slave style of vocalizing to 
run away with the plaudits at the biggest - and best - folksong festival held
in Atlanta.

The New York Times; Robert Shelton; 1965:  The program was a vibrant excursing 
into authentic folk song. The Sea Island quintet is a fascinating group
whose choral call-and-response singing, energetic dancing, and brightly
rhythmic hand-clapping held the audience of nearly 500 persons engrossed....
The performers put on a show as musically appealing as it was intellectually
stimulating.
