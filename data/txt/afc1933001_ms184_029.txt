Fisk kept me up until two thirty telling 
me how he saw folklore could be used 
in his program of morale work and 
adult education to be launched here
at Fisk next year.  Of course, he is 
a Quaker and something of a fool,
but he says he has access to money
and the backing of the General Education
board.  By the way, he wants me to spend 
a couple of days on my way back helping 
the Fisk Jubilee singers and a group 
of Nashville Negro folk singers get 
launched in the U. S. O. camp show
affairs.  Do you want me to cooperate 
or not?
After settling some very nasty difficulties 
and a lot of talk, I am getting 
my expedition underway tomorrow
morning.  Thereafter until my time is 
up I can be addressed Gen'l Delivery,
[Fisk] Clarksdale, Miss..  Please write 
me more in detail about what has happened.
Army post tour?  Latin America? Can I 
go?
Regards,
Alan
