Dear John:

It was a great surprise and a greater pleasure to hear from
you by your letter of the 6th, which I have not been able to acknowledge
until now because of an absence of several days.  I have been 
down here since mid-April trying to do my bit in the effort to stave
off inflation.

As to Hall Printing, I have kept up my contact with the company
through the years but of necessity have been out of touch for the
last few months so that I am by no means up to date at a time when
things can change pretty rapidly.  When I last talked with them, the
fiscal year, which ends March 31, was just about to close with remarkably 
successful results in spite of all the problems surrounding
business today and particularly a huge increase in taxes.  The company
had its share of problems relating to materials, particularly copper
for electro plates, but there seemed to be no prospective difficulty
in any other direction, including paper.  There were problems, of 
course, revolving around the fortunes of their important customers,
such as the large mail order houses, but there had been as yet no
radical drop-off.  The company came through the year with earnings, as
I remember, in the neighborhood of $3.50 per share, up a little from a 
year ago in spite of a drastic rise in taxes.

The company has cut its funded debt in remarkable fashion,
the former first mortgage bonds have all been retired, and the only
debt now existing is an unsecured serial indebtedness to an insurance
company and the tag-end of a term loan from the banks.  In fact, the
entire debt is down now to the place where it can practically be disregarded
for the reason that interest and principal are better than
cared for out depreciation.  Moreover, the former outstanding preferred
stock has all been retired, leaving only the common.

Hall Common was quoted yesterday in New York 11 Bid, 11-3/4
Asked.  It has been paying $1.25 a year, which is only about one-third
of recent earnings.  The management and the labor situation are good.

What may happen in times like this, no one can predict.  Hall
has done a remarkable job in not only coming through the difficult times
