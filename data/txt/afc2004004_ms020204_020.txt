Vera Hall,  reel  8, page11 

He still down therein Livingston, but he never gets no
appointment nowhere.  He preaches in the old house  down there
sometime. 
A:  What's the old house?
V:  It's just an old house  where nobody don't live and you
kin go there and have meetin if you want to, somebody that don[*'*]t 
go to church often, something like Sheffield, the old Jack
legged preacher and his wife and maybe her freends and maybe 
his friends will be there, but nobody else, to listen to him
preach.  I won't say he's not a preacher, cause sumpin coulda 
called him, but he doesn't ack like a preacher.  He doesn't ack 
like a prea[c]her at all.
A:  You mean outside the church buildin?
V:  That's what I'm talkin bout.  Outside the church.
A:  What does he do? 
V:  He beats his wife and he doesn't treat her right.  He goes
about, run around,leave her and all like that.  And she ask him
where he gone , where he been, he's ready to knock her down or fuss 
after her.He doesn't treat her right at all, doesn't stay home
with her one half of the time.  And I don't think preachers 
should live like that. 
Stays gone.  He got a car and he got a bycycle called motor
byke and he always got a woman sitting up there with him goin
down the road.  Just keeps a car full of womens , ridin um, 
stayin out half of the night.  Sometime all night.
E:  How does he make his money?
