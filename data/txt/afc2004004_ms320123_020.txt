. . .struggles.  Lord, I told him, I said "I don't believe I
can make it"  I was feeling awful bad and he made it and
there was actually me and they showed it at (unintelligible)
one time.  And (unintelligible) was looking so funny, I said
I was feeling so darn bad. . .

I think we've come upon something very important here.  It's a
characteristic of African and Black West Indian music very
frequently to have a piece of metal, a piece of steel beaten
when the music goes on.  You can't have a Voudon ceremony
and a holy one in Haiti without the accent (sp), the sound
of the iron.  That's what brings the gods to the dance
floor.  And there's another very important point too:  It
seems to me that not only this iron, this triangle, a sign
of the African-ness of Black Cajun music, but it's also
give a African shape to the orchestra.  An African
orchestra is basically a wind instrument with an idiophone
or drum accompaniment.  And that's what you have when you
have an accordian and a piece of iron played, and naturally
the feet beating on the floor. . .
