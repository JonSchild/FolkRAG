No.  19     When I take My Vacation 

Here so many are taking vacations 
To the mountains, the lakes, or the sea, 
Where they rest from their cares and their worries, 
What a wonderful time that must be; 
But it seems not my lot to be like them, 
I must toil through the heat and the cold, 
Seeking out the lost sheep on the mountain, 
Bringing wanderers back to the fold. 

CHORUS 

When I take my vacation in heaven
What a wonderful time that will be; 
Hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus, 
And the face of my Savior I see; 
Sitting down on the banks of the river, 
'Neath the shad of the evergreen tree, 
I shall rest from my burdens forever. 
Won't you spend your vacation with me? 

2 

Now some day I shall take my vacation 
To the city John tells us about, 
With its foundation walls all so precious,
Where from gladness of soul I shall shout; 
Oh, no sight ever witnessed by mortals 
Can compare with the glories up there; 
I shall spend my vacation with Jesus 
In the place He went on to prepare. 

3 

There the weather will always be perfect, 
Not a cloud shall sweep over the sky, 
And no earthquakes or cyclones shall threaten 
In the land of the sweet by and by; 
Soon there's going to be an excursion,
