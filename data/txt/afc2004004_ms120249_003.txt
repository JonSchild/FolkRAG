Courlander- Drum + the Hoe, 1960
134  Dancing and Dance Drama
form is heard most often during carnival days.  In all variations of the 
Meringue, the dance is performed by couples in ballroom style.  Among
the elite, it is restrained.  Elsewhere it is much more animated, with
free and uninhibited pelvic motions similar to those seen at the Saturday
night bamboche.  Although the Haitian regards his Meringue as a national
popular dance, Spanish-type music has infiltrated heavily from the Dominican
Republic, Cuba, and other islands of the West Indies.  Thousands 
of Haitians returning from contract labor in Cuba have brought with
them not only Cuban songs and rhythms but Cuban instruments as
well.  It has not been a one-way affair, however, for the Arada cults of
eastern Cuba have been built substantially around immigrants from
Haiti, and in the Cuban mountains you may hear music and see dances
of Afro-Haitian origin.
Still other kinds of dances are to be found in remote villages of 
Haiti--the old folk dances of Europe.  The villagers still know and
perform the waltz, the polka, the mazurka and the quadrille, usually
to the accompaniment of violins or guitars, or possibly an accordion.
But the influences are not all ancient ones.  Jazz has infiltrated the
Meringue.  And some years ago a small boy asked me wih some concern
whether I had taken proper account of a very important dance
called le black bottom.
Following is a list of dances known to Haitians today.  Some of them
are found throughout Haiti, some are known only regionally, and a
few are on the verge of extinction.
