Dear Miss Lomax:

We should be glad to send you a copy of record
number 7 upon receipt of the extra copy of record number
8 which you are returning to us.

We regret that we are unable to send you another
set of leaflets without extra charge since our supply is
limited. The cost of leaflets without records is at the 
rate of 10Â¢ each. Please let us know if you received the 
leaflets with the records you bought for your personal use. 

We shall keep you in mind regarding new recordings
and pressings which may fit into your work. 

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
