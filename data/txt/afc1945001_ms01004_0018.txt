BASIC FORM LETTER SENT TO NORC INTERVIEWERS
July 30, 1942
Mr. Thomas E. Hutchinson
1527 North Colorado Avenue
Indianapolis, Indiana
Dear Mr. Hutchinson:
This Center has recently become interested in the subject of 
"rumors", and we'd like to enlist your cooperation in a little experiment
which may lead to some important work being done on the 
subject.
As you may have noticed, rumors of all kinds circulate freely in
times like these.  The war is reaching deeply into the lives of
everyone, and we're all anxious to know what effects it will have
on us.  But authentic news must often be suppressed because of
censorship restrictions, while the answers to other questions
are still unknown.  As a result, rumors get started and in such
an atmosphere they are quickly repeated.
These rumors are important.  Some are malicious, some are innocent; 
some tend to destroy morale, some tend to raise it; some have a 
basis of fact, others are pure fiction.  We want to find out what
rumors are current at the present time, who is spreading them,
how prevalent they are.  And as a first step, we are asking you
and eleven others selected interviewers to become "rumor-conscious"
for one week.
What we want you to do is simply this:  Listen hard to the conversation 
you hear during this coming week, and see if you come across
any rumors.  If you do, jot the down and send them in to us.  If
you don't simply advise us of the fact.  But do not in any way encourage 
people to tell you rumors they've heard.  The purpose of
the experiment would be entirely defeated were you to make a special 
effort to find rumors, or to tell anyone that you are collecting 
them.
The enclosed page of instructions will help you understand just
what we are asking.  We'll deeply appreciate your cooperation--
but don't feel that you will be judged by the number of rumors
you turn in.  Just keep the assignment in mind, and if you don't
happen to hear any rumors, it will be important to us to know that.
Cordially yours
Paul B. Sheatsley
Eastern Representative
P.S.  If for any reason you prefer not to participate in this
"rumor collecting" experiment, (you won't get paid for it!), just
let us know -- by return mail if convenient
