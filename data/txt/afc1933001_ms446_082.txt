Amazing pity, grace unknown, 
And love beyond degree ! 

Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the might Maker, died, 
For man, the creature's sin. 

Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
While his dear cross appears ; 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes to tears. 

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe, 
Here, Lord, I give myself away-- 
'Tis all that I can do.

Come all around, I pray, draw near, 
And something glorious you shall hear ; 
Inviting sinners to return, 
For judgment day is rolling on. 

Although our enemies are bold, 
Yet, Christians, we must fight for souls ; 
Take up the cross, and go with us,
And if a Christian, pray you must. 

To see how Christians love to join 
To tell to all each other's mind ; 
To think there's something up above
That cause the saints so much to love. 

I thank the Lord for what he's done,
That through the merits of his Son, 
I hope my sins are all forgiven, 
And I've a resting place in heaven.  

I thought I'd pleasure in this world,
