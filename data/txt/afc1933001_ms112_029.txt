Dear Johnny and Margaret, or vice-versa:

I hadn't realized that we had neglected to write you. It seems to
me that most of my waking hours for the past nine or ten weeks have been 
taken up with getting ready to go to some kind of meeting, or buying food for an enlarged family, or giving medicine to Patsy or Susan or Marse John, or trying to help Shirley to decide what procedure she should take. 

Taking up the  topics in reverse order: Shirley left on Monday,
April 27, to spend some more time with Chris -- going by bus; she returned
the next Saturday night to get ready to take the children to an Eastern port
where Chris thought they would stop for supplies. On Monday night before she 
was to start early Tuesday, she received word that Chris et al. were still in 
M. Since that time she has had only two pieces of information
that she considered 
definite: a letter from Chris which said that they would probably follow
out their plan except a week later; and this Monday aft. she telephoned a friend, wife
of another officer on the boat, who told her that on Sunday the boat 
was no longer in M. So she and the children lighted out Tuesday morning, (yesterday)
giving us instructions to send on any information to two places en  route.
Last night a call came from Mobile; we gave the information that Shirley 
might be found at Hotel Vicksburg. That's all so far. One of Shirley's
reasons for hurrying on was her fear that she might be caught on the coast
without enough gas to get home; she wanted to fill up  before Friday when the 
rationing starts. Another reason was that she was restless and nervous
and wanted to be on  the move and doing something. While she was  here she
made some investigation about jobs; she received a notice from OCD requesting
her to enroll in riveting! She had some encouragement about playground supervision
in the schools here, nothing definite. The children have been with  us
nine weeks and we miss them all. She is expected to get her mail at Gen'l Deliver[y]
Charleston.  

Bess writes that she was in Washington for a few days visiting Alan 
and Elizabeth and looking for a job. She discovers that she is anemic, and
I think she will go back to the summer camp in Michigan-- I certainly hope
so. Shirley is negotiating whether she can't go too, but Bess is not sure 
Susan is old enough. It would be ideal for Pat, and Patsy would profit by 
rubbing up against other rulers-of-the-roost. She was smart enough to take 
advantage of the multiplicity of authority here. All of us realized it was 
hard on the children. On the whole, however, things moved very smoothly. 
Alan thinks that he may be able to give Bess some temporary work, since his 
secretary is sick just now. I hope it works out. 

"Marse John" is feeling better on the whole, I think; don't know
whether it was the medicine or his dieting or the folk-lore meeting; he
hasn't had as frequent or as severe pains as he had for a while. The folk-lore meeting did help, I think; it was a great success and he was the belle
of the ball; he saw many of his friends and President Hubbard did everything
possible to help out. Life Magazine sent photographers, thinking perhaps 
it might use the folklore meeting and TSCW for a "Life Goes to a Party".
We haven't heard definitely yet; the photographers, Dallas men, said the 
pictures are a great success. One of the distinctive features of this
