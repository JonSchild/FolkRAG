1.-Why did Hitler wear his socks to bed?
Because he didn't want to smell de feet
2.- What did Hitler say when he saw the 
new baby?
Hot tot totsy we got a new nazi.
3. Some people have critiqisms to the war
I was talking to a woman that is married
the other day she said she didn't like the
meat shortage because she didn't know
what she was going to feed her dog
now since there was no more rich beef.
4. After this war is over I think if we
would not win the war, as everyone
knows it would be a great loss
to the U.S.A. But if Hitler would
win he will want all of the
lands he conquered for himself
But I think Musulaini on this or Hito
will want their share and
Hitler won't want to give so this
will cause war again and then what will happen.
