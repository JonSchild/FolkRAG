Jean: Very big. Very, very big.
Lomax: Anything special about you when you were a baby?
Jean: No, nothing. Except my mother said I had an awful head
of black hair. "You were as black as the Earl of Hell's nightcap!"
Lomax: Did they tell any stories about how you behaved when
you were a baby?
Jean: No - I was a very good speaker, spoke very plain when I
was little - in her arms. She said I would speak to the people
that came to speak to her, like a big body she said.
Lomax: She must have been bitter about him sometimes.
Jean: No doubt she would have had her own feelings. It was only
natural. I don't remember. I was only nine months when my
father died. Of course, no doubt shr had been bitter, but what
could she do about it. Because she could look for her own
livelihood, and her family didn't starve.
Lomax: Looks like she'd have left him and found herself another
man at that point.
Jean: Well, she didna do that. She'd nae fun in her life. She
was young married. She was getting a big family. She was only
29 when he died. 28 past when she had me.
Lomax: Isn't it dreadful to do so young as that. . .
Jean: Well, you see, my father wouldn't take her telling.
Nobody could stop him from drinking. And he must have been a 
good man although he had a weakness for drink, because there&s
too much people liked him and had so much good to say about him.
Lomax: When you were a little girl, did you go out on the 
summer tours with your family?
Jean: Oh yes, we all went together. By that time my mother was
married a second time. A man called Jim Higgins, same name as
my husband. He was my mother's age. He soldiered with my father.
They knew each other. So he married his widow and he was very
good to us. He soldiered all his days, too, like my father - 
his younger days, like.
Lomax: And you remember camoing out in the hills and braes of
Dundee very early?
Jean: Oh yes, I remember before I went to school. I remember
when the 1914 war broke out. My step-father was a reservist.
