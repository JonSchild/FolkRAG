REVON REED -19
I'll never shed a tear.
Now that you're gone.
I love you for a long, a long, long
time.
My little darling, I love you dear.
LOMAX  Can you tell me why so, why are so
many of the Cajun songs all sad and lonesome?  [UNCLEAR]
Why is that?
:  It's the old Cajun tradition.  That's
the old Cajun. . . .
:  I could make you cry with some of those
songs.
LOMAX  Why are all the songs so sad?
:  I don't know.  That's Cajun style.  They
sad and when they get up, [back], they make you jump, kick
up your heel until it's pitiful.  And they play a waltz and
make you cry.  And they, they [flam de fire], they make you
go up.  You don't, you don't get sad every, every, every
number of those waltz.  The waltz and the two step is
[INAUDIBLE].
LOMAX  That's enough.  Thank you.
