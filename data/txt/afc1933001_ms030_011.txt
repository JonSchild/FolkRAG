Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is simply to acknowledge the receipt, late yesterday
afternoon, of the twenty-five records we loaned to Alan
for transcription, together with seven new Mexican records,
bringing our total to 664 (287 Lomax, 355 Victor, 22 Thomas).

I note that Alan, in transcribing the texts of the
records recently loaned, has indicated in each case a reference
to the place where the record was made. This is important.
But do you not think that each record ought also to be
dated?

Looking forward to seeing you next month,

Cordially,

OS
