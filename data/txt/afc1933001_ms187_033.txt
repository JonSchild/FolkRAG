     As an interesting and especially actual illustration I
take the Czechoslovak folksong on war-themes, one of the most wide-
spread branches of Czechoslovak folk-lore; the new functions
and changes of this species of song in its relation to the present
war.
     I feel particularly qualified for the above-mentioned research-
work, since for a number of years I have devoted myself in
the Czechoslovak Republic to taking down the text and melody of
folksongs and to studying their origin and evolution in both the
past and present and particularly to studying their social functions.
To these problem was also devoted my doctorate dissertation
in the Department of Sociology, Ethnography and Musical Science at
the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University in Prague.
     Of late I began to collect and study Czechoslovak folksongs
in the States of New York and New Jersey and I have found
very precious and instructive material as regards their sociological, 
folkloristic and particularly musicological dide. I have
succeeded already in founding not only numerous singers from Czechoslocak
villages which I had once studied especially. I have also
found direct relatives and descendants of the performers who had
been the special subjects of my research study in the Czechoslovak
Republic. I wish to add that the entire literary and musical
material collected by me in their Czechoslovak Republic I have here
with me.
     I should be very happy if given a possibility to study my
native folksong on its new soil and granted an opportunity for a
folkloristic fieldwork in Czechoslovak centres in the States of
New York /especially in New York city's Czechoslovak workers' quarter/,
Pennsylvania /especially in the Czechoslovak miner's centers
