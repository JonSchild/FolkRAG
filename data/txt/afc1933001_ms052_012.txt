I have received two books,
ages of forwarded mail
from her, sent Feb, 15 and 17.
None since, not even bills.
My all-the-time address 
is c/o [?Thos] Cook
[?], 2 Place [?]
[?], Paris, France
Will be in that neighborhood
again in a couple
of weeks or so.
I'd enjoy some
Library news but I'm
not going to beg for a
letter after treating you
so shabbily, and especially
when I know that you

love other things more than
letter-writing. Also I
could see the look of
relief on your face
when I announced that
my soured and gloomy
visage was vacating
the Library corridors. But
[Allen] Alan might write
or Mr. Waters or even dear
Miss Rogers. To them
and to all of the rest of
the bunch who never failed
in cheerful hospitality I
send my blessing.
Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
