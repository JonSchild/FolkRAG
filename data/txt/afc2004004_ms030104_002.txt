You know, since we is-has a little learning, since we've had a little
polish and a little culture, Hell's gone out of business.
Fact, it's almost out of existence.  According to the notion and ______
__________ but as far as the scripture is concern and as far
as I personally am concern, there's still a Hell.  Not all the ministers
that are here________, this fine array of young men
that you see here along of myself, they used to preach about Hell so, that
even during the wintertime folks'd say "Raise the window, it's gettin'
warm in here".  But we have left if off so long until the folks don't
believe that there's any use in trying to shun Hell.
But folks, there's a Hell yet.  Some of us call it Hades and others
Purgatory, but that's just a full-dress suit on the word Hell, in fact that's 
the modernists' style of giving you the slant on the place that you
wouldn' want to live eternally.  YES?  THAT'S RIGHT.
But it's a just as impossible to do away with Hell as it is impossible to do
'way with Heaven.
(Louder response) YES THAT'S RIGHT.
The first fact that I wish to call your attention to is that there is a Hell.
YEAH....YEAH
There is a Hell.  Sinners without change of mind, without a change of purpose,
without a change of motive, when this life of yours is ended, whether now or 
sometime later to come, eternally your life hereafter will be spent in Hell.
