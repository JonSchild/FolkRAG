Reverend Roe.  Reel 9.  P. 3
but if it's truth, you just better said so.  [Of course, with them, you] Because whatever is done,
[know, it's done] you know [it's] it just coming to [life] light.
A:  Of course, ministers are particularly sorry afterwards about women, for spiritual reasons, and so the temptation is--
R:  Yes, we hates it; we don't want to yield to those temptations, but being in contact all the time, and there is some women that you'll meet in your life, that you can't hardly stand,[that] you have to keep away from em; just have to avoid them some way or other.  It's hard, and I think, as a man, you know that yourself.  Well, it's natural with the preacher just like it is with you.  And now the only
difference might be, he wouldn't yield [like] maybe as quick as you would.  But most every man that's living has a [preaching] breaking point.  Therefore, we got to be very careful.
A:  Would you say that women are more interested in preachers than [they are in other] ordinary men?
[*Women interested in preachers*]
R:  [I would say so;] Mostly so, yes, sir, they are.  And I've noticed this:  you can go to a place and run a successful [about] a revival [in which].  You preach well and satisfy the people well, there'll be some women, more than one, generally [that'll] will try to tempt you, and you have to be pretty strong.  Generally you may be away from home for weeks conducting revival, and at a time like that, if you ain't mighty careful, you may fall.  It's a temptation, and hard [for a man] to bear sometime.
A: That would be may be some of the women of the church.
R:  Generally so, yes sir, generally so.  And they offer you some temptation at times and it's hard to say for instance for a woman will go to work and put on some kind of a project and raise you some money, maybe buy you a nice [set] suit of clothes, dress you up, and everything like that, and
then after she did so much for you, why then, she kinda in a way offers herself to you, and she's been so good to you, you got to be mighty strong now to hold.  If you don't mind things will snap.
