TAPE 89 G: DAVIE STEWART.
Lomax: So at a time like that, your mother would stick up for
you and try to stop your father from...
Davie: She tried to stop my father, but he wouldn't listen to
her at all. 'Course, we always clung to our mother's side mostly.
But still, I wouldn't like to see my father in those days get
in trouble. When he went away, maybe he took a few drinks, and
he was no a fightable man O- he didn't go for arguing and
fighting with anybody. But if anybody started hitting or doing
anything to him, he'd always be there to take his part. I
remember one time he were drunk in Aberdeen, and he was sitting
in the house, and there was a man by the name of Mc wan came in.
(PAUSE WHILE PHONE RINGS) I'd be about fourteen years old. MY
father was working at the harvest - away about five or six weeks.
Still, you got paid, wet or dry, but as I've told ye before, it
wasna very much money - about four or five pounds for the harvest.
Came home and gave my mother some of the money and kept a pound
himself. Then he'd go out and get this big bottle of whiskey,
it would be about half a crown or three bob. So he'd have a
drink himself and sit down. There was a man by the name of
McEwan - a travelling man used to come into our house
at Aberdeen, and he was younger than my fatherm and he started to
row with the old man, and knocked him over with one of the chairs
and gave him three or four kicks. But father was a big-looking
man. I remember well, I cam in through the door - I was away
to the pictures, and it was a penny for the pictures, and
there was nobody in the house but my father and the old woman,
mother, but she didn't go much for the drink - just a couple
of nips, that's all. And this man McEwan tried to wreck the
house. My father was vry, very drunk. So he scrambled to his
feet anyway and he give that man an awful nailing, nearly half-
killed him. But he w uldn't interfer with nobody unlesss they
interfered with him. He was a very quiet man, but very strict
against his children doing any wrong. There's children now would
even spit in an old person's face. I remember one day not very
long ago, I was playing in Dundee and singing and playing. A
couple of schoolboys about twelve or thirteen years of age was
making a fool of me all the time I was singing and playing. One
got a stone and he swung it and hit me on the back of the head.
I couldn't stop playing and singing because I don't like to
stop when I'm doing a little turn. I carried on - they flung a
bit of sand in my face - got around my back and pulled my coattail -
tried to pull the keys of the accordion. So a woman
opened a window and asked the boys to go away. They give the
woman a lot of cheek - flung stones at her window. I don't think
that's right - the school-masters should look into these things.
I like children myself, but I don't like cheeky children.
Lomax: Davy, how many years did you spend at school ?
Davy: About four years altogether.
