TO ALAN LOMAX   6/15/62
From PAUL A. ROSEN . . . N.R.B. ASSOCIATES, LTD.  . . .  485 MADISON AVE., N.Y. 22

THE SHOW WAS 
MARVELOUS-----

7:30-8:00 P.M.  (2)--Accent.  "The Golden Isles:
Cradle of American Song."  A contagious and
hypnotic half hour of the beat, the rhythm, 
and excitement of the African-American folk
song at its source.  Guest musicologist Alan
Lomax is a particularly charming guide on
this tour of the isolated Golden Isles off the
coast of Georgia, where the descendants of 
the last African slaves still work, dance, play,
and go to church to the rhythm of their traditional
songs.  Tune in for the unaccompanied
performance of the Buzzard dance, the sea
chanty, the church song, the children's song,
and more, and you'll recognize the origin of
the jazz forms of today.

8:30-9:30 P.M. (4)-Dr. Kildare "Admitting Service."
(Repeat).
