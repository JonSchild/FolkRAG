is jumpin' straight up and down in 'em.   This other old man began

Man:   That's true, that is true!   So let us say thanks again,
for lettin' us (unint) a beautiful place.

AL:   What do you think your mission is, do you think you
accomplish a mission, do you think you actually bring people
into the Lord when you sing, have you seen that happen?

Man:   Definitely.  Let's see, within one month--we (unint) it for

AL:   These people came  thru when you were singing?

Man:   Yes, In our services we always sing awhile, then at the
close of the service we make an alter call -- these gnats are
terrible, aren't they! .-- anyway, when we get thru, we make this
alter call, -- and we never force our beliefs.  We leave our
denominations out of it. -- they're Church of God, and I'm Baptist,
