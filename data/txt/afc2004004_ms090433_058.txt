What did she tell you?

E:  She told me to come on (laughter).  I wanted fun; I wanted to 
know what we were going to do.  She showed me.  We made everything all 
right.

A:  You were old enough then to do it?

E:  Well, I done it in my way.

Baby, llokin at the wind howlin,
Howlin all around too.
Baby don't you hear the wind howlin?
Hollerin around my baby down.

It's thunderin and it's lightnin, baby,
And the wind begin to blow.
It's thunderin and it's lightnin, baby
And the wind begin to blow.

Lawd, my baby told me this mo'nin,
"Now, now, if you don't love me no mo,"
Lawd, it's howlin outdoors,
Rainin on my old windowpane.
It's rainin outdoors,
Stormin on my window pane.

You know that's a mighty shame.
Black Mattie say it's gonna shine on,
Baby, just like the risin sun.
Black Mattie say it's gonna shine on,
Baby, just like the risin sun.

A ship to save me now?

She say that sun love my love
This morinin
Even before my marriage door.
