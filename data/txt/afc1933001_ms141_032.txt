Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter which
I have today written to your father. I am
sending this copy to you as I do not know
whether your father has yet returned to
Washington or not, and if not, perhaps you
would be kind enough to deal with it for
him.
Yours sincerely,
Felix Greene.
