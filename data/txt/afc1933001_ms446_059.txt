Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 
And all the rest go free?
No, there's a cross for every one, 
And there's a cross for me. 

How happy are the saints above, 
Who once went sorrowing here;
But now taste unmingled love, 
And joy without a tear.

The consecrated cross I'll bear, 
Till death shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear, 
For there's a crown for me. 

Upon the crystal pavement down
At Jesus' pierced feet, 
Joyful, I'll cast my golden crown, 
And his dear name repeat.

And palms shall wave and harps shall ring
Beneath heaven's arches high;
The Lord that lives, the ransomed sing
That lives no more to die. 

Oh, precious cross!  Oh, glorious crown!
Oh, resurrection day!
Ye angels, from the stars come down
And bear my soul away.

No. 44
My buried friends can I forget, 
Or must the grave eternal sever?
They linger in my memory yet
And in my heart they live forever. 
They loved me once with love sincere, 
And never did their love deceive me; 
But often in my conflicts here, 
They rallied quickly to relieve me.
