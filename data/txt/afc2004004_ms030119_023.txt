against Negroes in the United States?)
Well. . . I have no permanint idea bout how dey'd feel 
about it. They got some many, some very grievious feelins, no doubt. 
I'm satisfied they have. But all the feelin, that doesn't make the 
thing be any better. They still kill em in the South, whenever they 
git ready. Bout that same thing.  Colored pusson's life ain't no 
mo than a bird on a limb. Lynch you when they wanna. Shoot you when 
they please.
(Will this cruelty and discrimination come to an end?)
The Bible says so. In God's own time. It perhaps 
might be in ouwah time, if we keep ouwah mouth shut an don't do 
too much talkin. Yo u know, you can kill yourself by talkin. 
You got many days to live. You don't know how long. You can cut 
them days off by talkin.
(How did it happen that God let some of His people, 
whom he created be so --)
He suffered fur it to be so. It wadn't just, but He 
suffered fur it to be.  When Christ hung on the cross, He said, 
"Suffer for all these things to be." There was a reason fur it. 
The reason was, when the time come, will be straignten out. Be a straightenin up about it.
(It seems very cruel.)
Ain't no seems in it. It is cruel. Den, it's not as 
cruel as it was way back in ancient times. No, no. Way back yonah, ole prophets got to preachin this thing, they burnt em up. Whipped 
em and burnt em up. You could smell the flesh of em fur miles. We 
ain't goin through anything. We're havin a good time. Ole prophets 
back yondah didn't have no good time. They took em and burnt em up.
(Where does the Bible tell us that these things will  
come to an end, Rev. Davis?)
