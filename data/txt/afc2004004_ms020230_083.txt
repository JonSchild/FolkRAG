BJ:  Uh-huh.
TL:  Well, why?
BJ:  There wa'n' any water system, you see, down there.
TL:   There wasn't any water system?
BJ:  Tha's right.  At that time.  Course, you could buy water, ya
know, in, ah, gallons an' ah, pure water.  But that was pure water,
too, 'cause we had a way of, ah, congealin' it, ya know?  Gettin'
all that -- cleanin' it.
TL:  What did you do?
BJ:  Jis' -- after we get it, we go an' tote it in an' ah, put it
in a big barrel, it always bes [in a] (sp? - be's) in a [barrell barell]
barrel -- they furnished the barrel an' things there, then, for
you to put 'em in, and they, either galvanized can, you know, like
that, big things, put you somethin' over it an' puts alum -- this
same alum what be in the sto', powered alum, ya know -- put that
alum in it, jus' a little, not enough to taste.  An' soon as you
put the alum in there, you can see all that trash an' filth goin'
to the bottom.  An' then you strain that off if you want to, see.
An' you got clean water, clear as any other water.  I lived in it
[vie] five years an' it [ain't] didn't -- it ain't killed me.  An', ah,
many more.  But, true, we always have a, a big barrel settin' at
the corner a your house, you know, it, ah, they, it leak at the
heel, and when it rain, it rain in there, see.  An' have a strainer,
big cloth, thick cloth, over the barrel all the time, to catch
rain water.  See?  So, therefore, we had water that way, see?  Too,
have rain water mixed with it.  So we had a, had a way of havin'
somethin'.  The Lawd has a way for ya to make it anyhow regardless
of how it seem!
