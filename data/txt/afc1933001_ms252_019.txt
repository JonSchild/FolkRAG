II D 4

Martin wasa man he was neither long and slender
Everybody knew he was a bar-room tender
Martin was a man he had a very small hand 
He worked at the coffee stand

Martin went to the market for to buy a dime lunch
Right across the street were some men a-playin' hunch
He reached out for to borrow him a gun
'Twas something Martin had never done

All you young girls better take a heed
Don't you do like your friend Ellen Speed
Someday you will go for to have a little fun
Some man will do like Martin done

Martin went one day for to have a good time
He spend one hundred dollars and one dime
People in Weston said that Martin ought to be hung
For stopin' Ella Speed from havin' her fun

All the young girls come a-runnin' an' a cryin'
Repeat
An' it warn't but the one thing worried the po' girl's mind
She lef' her two po' little boys behind.
