De Kalb Blues

Notes:

Look here, woman, where did I see you before?
?

Good looking woman, can I go home wid you?
I done ask you, that's all a po' boy can do.

You can go if you ain' feerd of my man,
?

You had money and I come to see,
Would you take a poor ol' slave like me.

Bad man comin' wid his gun,
I ain't got a gun but I ain't gonna run.

I ain't got a gun an' I ain't gonna run,
Stay right here and we gonna have some fun.

Train I'm ridin' don' do no stoppin' here,
Keep on ridin', find some woman to feel my care.

Hard workin' man nothin' but a slave,
I would rather be dead an' in my grave.

I'd rather be dead an' be in my grave,
Than be here to be some woman's slave.

What's de matter I can't get no mail,
Mus' be some black kitten walked across my trail.

Long time man hold up your head,
You may make it and you may fall dead.

You oughta been here in nineteen and ten,
The men's was a fallin'---a reg'lar haulin' in.

Sun was shinin', the mens was flyin',
And the cap'n was holl'in',"?   in there, shine."

Number one leader, I was rollin' some,
I was rollin', honey, from sun to sun.

Moon in the mornin' 'fore the sun did rise,
I wouls think about my baby, hang my head and cry.
