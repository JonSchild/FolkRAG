Dear James,
     I have sold some of the songs you recorded for
me last summer, to Atlantic Records. I can pay you
at the rate of $15 per song as an advance on royalty
payment, for those songs that will be used in the
first album of spirituals. In addition you will
get performer's royalties as they fall due. Will
you please tell me which of the songs listed on the
attached sheet you are the real original composer
of, so that I can arrange for you to get composer's
royalties as well, and have your songs copyrighted
for you.
     Please sign and return the attached contracts
right away, so that we can get these records [as] out
as soon as possible, and get your money to you.
Be sure to sign all copies, return two to me, and
keep one for yourself.
                                                     Very best wishes,
 
                                                     Alan Lomax.
