Like "Easy, Mister Tom", a jazzy pre-jazz tune
and a favorite with Lead Belly on his twelve strings,
[this song arose out of some incident or chance remark,
that everyone soon forgot the history of, and 
developed through
rhymes and finger-snapping.]
is, possible, a fragment of some longer song,

O de medicine man,
O babe,
He's travelin' though de lan';
O de medicine man,
O babe
He's travelin' through de lan'.

Got de grip in his han',
[O] Baby,
An' he's [tryin'] doin' de bes' he can;
Got de grip in his han',
[O] Baby,
An' he's doin' de bes' he can.

L. B. Speaks: That was a doctor, he used to sell medicine, an' he done got to
a blin' man. An' he settin' on de side o' de road beggin' all he
can. An' ev'ybody come along an' seed him, knowed him an' knowed
he was a good doctor. An' ev'ybody, look like [they] they'll try
to do sumpin for de good doctor. He had his ol' medicine
case in his han', an' when de people come along he want to let
'em know who he was-----

L.B. Sings: "I'm de [medicine] blin' man,
O baby,
I'm settin' on de road [agian];
I'm de [medicine] blin' man,
O baby,
I'm settin' on de road again.

"I'm de blin' man,
O baby, 
I'm doin' de bes' I can;
Got my grip in my han',
O baby,
I'm doin' de bes' I can."
