Fear they like the boss are
locoed
Stampeede at a sight of a hand
And drag with a rope to the
gallos.
And mark by some crooked
drag hand
Chore
Rolle on

I know there will be some
drag thinking
A dicer got broke from on high.
Yet pinch with the boss of the 
glambler.
As the boss of the glamblers
goes by
Chors
Rolle on
