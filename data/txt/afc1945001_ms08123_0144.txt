English 6

  There was a soldier, who was 
running all over camp picking
up pieces of paper.  Everytime he 
picked up a piece he would look
at it, throw it away, and say, "That's
not it."  After awhile the other soldiers 
became to notice him and thought
he was crazy.  One of the soldiers
went to his Commanding Officer
and told him about the soldier
he thought was crazy.  The Commanding
Officer began to notice him and
finally gave the crazy soldier
a discharge from the army.
When the soldier received it, he looked
at it and said, "Ah, this is what I've
been looking for".
