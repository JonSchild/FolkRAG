"Hush-Hush" Campaign
April 1, 1942

Attached is an unusually complete prospectus
for a "Hush-Hush" campaign to combat rumors and rumor
mongers, suggested by Lee Ringer, an advertising man of
Los Angeles.

Because your Bureau either is or will be engaged
in poster, radio, newspaper and other publicity to
neutralize rumors, I feel certain that you will be
interested in the contents of this prospectus.

When the Bureau of Operations is finished with
it, it must be returned to Mr. Arnold Barach, Campaigns
Branch, Division of Information, Office for Emergency
Management, Washington, D.C.
