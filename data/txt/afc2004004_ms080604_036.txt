said, "And you ain't doin nothin" I say, "And you lettin
your sister down over there!"  And I'd take that line,
and I'd come back and hit her, ah. . 
(singing:)
Oh, Everybody!
Try to call me mean. 
Cos they see me whippin
On my ol hook team.
(speaking:)
Then  somebody calls to quit at hollerin at
'em.  They'd say, "You better hold up off her, boy!"  I'd say,
"I can't".
(singing:)
And tomorrow is payday,
Sunday I'm goin home.
I'm a hold my baby
In my lovin arms.

A.L.:
What's that one about, "Looked all over the
whole corral and couldn't find a mule with his shoulder

Oh, Oh yeah. . .

A.L.:

Joe Savage (singing:)
Ooo-oo -ooooo. . .
I woke up soon one morning,
By the break of day.
Lord, I seen my old woman,
When she walked away.

So they say (worryin now?)
(To catch that run?)
I'm gon take my time, boys
I'm gon take my time.

A.L.:  
How 'bout, "Mr Charlie, Mr. Charlie, did the
money come?"  You know that?
