Dear Harold:
In a way, the Cantometrics project - now going into its 5th year- was stimulated
by your casual request one day in 1937 that I give you a means of classifying 
the folk songs in the Archive.  I think that this is one of the most difficult 
taxonomic problems. We do have certain means of solution for it, the details
of which I won't try to cram into this letter. Attached is a recent paper
which contains some of the key ideas with which we work.  Also attached is
a computer map of one original song type, the numbers indicating the percent
of songs per culture sample.

I must be brief, but will close by saying that as a first classifier, the
very best set of categories you could use would be the culture areas and regions 
[origins] most used by anthropologists.  We are in the process of slight
reforms of these areas but, on the whole, they pull more homogeneity,
stylistically, than any other system.

I hope this friendly note will save you a few hundred dollars.

All the best.
Sincerely, 
Alan Lomax
