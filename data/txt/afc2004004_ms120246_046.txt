Veuve - for Ogoun Balendjo -

When I arrived the last song to Legba was
being sung.  After - Aizan.  After - Damballa
After - Sabo.  Then Ogoun Balendjo -
Food for him was put on a red checked
table-cloth over the vêuvê - a calbase of
chicken with plantain, kalalou, etc..
Puro women were posessed by Ogoun - one was
a hounsi drapeaux
