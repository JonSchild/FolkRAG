Mr. Alan Lomax

New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

It has come to my attention that you have not acknowledged receipt
of the $250 from Mr. Bond. Will you please do so immediately?

Enclosed is the application from the Council of Learned Societies
which has just arrived. Please fill this out lightly in 
pencil and sign in the proper place under item 12. I will then revise 
the answers and have them typed in. Notice also that they require 
a certified transcription of your college record. Please
arrange to have this sent to me also.

I had a very successful trip and among other things obtained a
promise of the Columbia phonograph records for the Library. Many
people whom I met in New York expressed a desire to make your acquaintance.
Some of these are of great importance to the Library. I
suggest, therefore, that you communicate with the following men as 
soon as you possibly can.

Dr. Carleton Sprague Smith,
Chief, Division of Music
New York Public Library

Mr. Davidson Taylor
