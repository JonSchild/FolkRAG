& reserved it is becoming.

Now I must settle down to
my script, produce it next Monday.
Then two more weeks for the next
script. Then off to France I
hope. Things are going well but
I'm so rootless & unsure of myself
that I'm moving every day. .I 
feel more & more that I am becoming
used to a completely superficial
way of living, avoiding all serious
problems. On the other hand my
soul is taking a big vacation 
from the deep sorrow I have 
suffered lately, sorrow almost
too strong for it. Nowadays I
face the future of traveling about
with equanimity. Drempt last
night that Mick told me he
was worried about us - indicates
my own worry about myself.
