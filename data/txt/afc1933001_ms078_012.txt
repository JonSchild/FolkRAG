Commission at Barnum, Texas. The superintendent remarked," I see
you have a new president". "Yes, replied Dr. Halstead. "He's never
been a teacher, has he?" "No, answered Dr. Halstead. "Well,
what claim does he have to be President of the University of Texas?"
Dr. Halstead pulled his long mustache and gave his famous laugh as he
replied, "None that I ever heard of, except that he was a pall-bearer
at Lee's funeral."

P.S. As I recall the story, Dr. Halstead claimed that he arrived,
either in Paris or Rome, late. The Government, on hearing of
his his plight, ordered a special train to carry him to Budepest
where the International Conference on Mathematics was being
held. There was a special train that ran from Paris to Bude-
pest, but there were 399 other mathematicians on that train
besides Dr. Halstead.
