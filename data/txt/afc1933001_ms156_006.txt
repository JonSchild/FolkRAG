I sit every Tuesday P.M. waiting for 
you to come on, I surely do enjoy 
it, and too, I hird Mollie Jackson 
sing a song that called me back 
to one of my old aunts, I us to 
hear her sing it the name was 
"Barbara Allen," and some others I 
do not Recall, People call this 
part of the Country Hard hard to make 
a living in, but down in S.C. 
when I was 15 years old, I worked 
on farms for 48.00 Dollars from 1st 
day of Jan, to the 31st day of Dec, 
the next year, I got 60. for a years 
service, and Done all the superintending 
sence my Boss had lost his health, then  
16 a lone kid, I left for Ga. finely I 
wondered on over here, whear 5.00 a day 
of 8 hours is only a Moderate days pay.

let me have Mollie Jacksons address, I enclos 
stamps for your convenience, Respty C E Tucker
