Cox: No.  My mother had to work as much as he did, on the farm.
She used to be a-goin' all the year long when she could.  [Hand]
Hadn't been for her we shou'n't ha' had anything.  Never got 
that time o' day, when we were little.

Lomax: Were you ever hungry any time, Harry?

Cox: I have been hungry?

Lomax: Have you?

Cox: Yeah.

Lomax: When you were a child?

Cox: Yes.  I - we used to have it allotted out to us.  She used to
say, "Eat that," she'd say, "an' you
      You won't starve.  There's no more."  (laughs) That's 
what we used to get.

Lomax: What would you get, Harry?

Cox: She'd say, "Now eat that, an' your two
she used to give us, see, you know you couldn't
I mean that was kind of the way they used.

Lomax: What would you get when she...

Cox: Well, lump of bread an' - an' lard.

Lomax: Lard?

Cox: Well,                      an' I was gettin' old - well,
fairly, before I see anything like butter.  Do you know what butter
was?  When we were small?

Lomax: What kind of bread was it that you had, Harry?  Homemade...?

Cox: Oh yes, she used to do it all herself.  She served so long -
she had served so long in a baker's office, an' she was a good - a
good baker, good cook.  I'll allow her could make bread like the
next.  Used to be up there mornin's; hot loaves an' cheese when we
got a little better off.  (laughs) she'd up an' bake in the mornin'
before we were up.  Round loaves, you know, an' cut 'em off a bit o'
cheese.an!..

Lomax: And that was good, uh?

Cox: Oh, I should think it were.  They were the times.  Or,
sometimes, you used to have a bannock, they called it, you know a
lump o' dough chucked into a pan - about that thick.  An' that was
all the livin' then.  She - she done a lot in her time for us.
