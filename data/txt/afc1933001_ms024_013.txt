Gentlemen:
I beg to request a continuance of your financial support,
for a period of three years, of my work in collecting for
the Library of Congress the words and music of American
folk-songs.

Traveling expenses, two men, for 1935... $3000
For reconditioning and improving re-
cording machine, exchange difference
between present car and a new car,
and a house-trailer------------------------$1500

The recording machine has suffered from travel. It can be
greatly improved, so that it will give less trouble and pro-
duce better records. The Ford car, bought December 1933, has
traveled 34,000 miles and can be most economically exchanged.
So that we will not be dependent on the questionable hospit-
ality of prison officials and on the discomforts of Negro
swamp cabins and the like, we should have a house-trailer,
to serve as sleeping-quarters and recording laboratory. Such
equipment will save time and money and will enable us to work
much more intensively and efficiently.
I have in mind the following projects:
