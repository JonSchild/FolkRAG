SBH letter C O P Y 2

Would you care to express yourself on the relation between the Child Ballads
and the more inclusive range of American folk-song? Perhaps some discussion
of this point might come somewhere at the end of your book.

Lead Belly will need some elaboration in spite of your separate
treatment of him. Are there other individual contributors who could have
somewhat elaborated portraits? Other important routes of dispersion than
Chisholm? Centers of radiation, geographical and social? cowboy camps, saloons,
dance halls, roundhouses, rivers, waterfronts? The varying conditions and
circumstances under which you got your own recordings would assist my own
imagination.

You have, as have fortunately most recent American collectors,
given attention to the music; Could you tell us something about characteristic
modes of singing, about the persistence of given tunes, about variations of
ais as well as words?

Your connection and Alan's with the Washington Archives should
have a rather conspicuous recital. That is not only a recognition of the
value of your contributions but a kind of logical sequence of our travels
and travails. As I see it, you have illustrated in the field of folk song what
Turner and his school have demonstrated in the more general school of history.
Will not your book be a record of a singing obligate to the westward movement?

Strength to your writing arm:

Yours sincerely,
S. B. Hustvedt
