74. 

The fact that so many of the worldly things are embodied in the 
songs and stories the Negroes now sing and tell indicates a growing 
sense of appreciation. Then, too, the plantation Negroes, even 
though they may be in very dire economic circumstance, have large 
collections of jazz records together with victrolas or radios; all 
this bespeaks of their worldly interests and appreciation. The 
fact that the "juke joints" are now a part of the cotton field, or 
that the church now gives "Heaven and Hell parties", indicates 
that the city is not too far away in their daily experience.  

To sum up: the extent that urban forms of expression have been 
diffused to the Delta - that they have supplanted much of the folk 
songs and folk tales - may well speak of the impact of the city 
upon traditional life of the Negro. It may be further stated that 
the urban culture had the opportunity to spread, come to be needs, 
and is now appreciated. This diffusion has gone on without the 
interference of conservative elements, since both the folk songs 
and folk tales were less structuralized or less formalized aspects 
of Negro life on the plantation.
