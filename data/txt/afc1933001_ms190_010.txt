Dear Mr. Brandt:

   Henry Allen Moe was kind enough to send me a
manuscript of James Pipes'.  I read it with great interest
and excitement and have sen tit on to William Haygood of
the Rosenwald Foundation for his inspection.
   Would you be kind enough to give me Mr. Pipes'
address so that I can correspond with him directly.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
