All  the boys in London 
[lead] leave a happy life land
except for Guinever, she hasn't
got a lad.
O a lad she shall have 
and hunting we will go
Along with M. ee-aye-o
He kisses, he cuddles her
& kisses her on his knee
Anel says Dear dyou love me

Notes or John Miams - singer of 
Bothir
He's a traveling sole man Very much
the lowlander Very subservient. Balding
Spectacles. A talker and singer with froth
at lip corners. A couthy man-
homey, comforatable
