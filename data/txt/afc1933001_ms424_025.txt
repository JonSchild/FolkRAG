GO DOWN MOSES
(Negro)

(Everybody Song Book - Paull Pioneer Music Co.N.Y.C.)

1. When Israel was in Egypt's land;
Let my people go,
Oppressed so hard they could not stand,
Let my people go;
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

2. Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said,
Let my people go;
If not I'll smite your first-born dead,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

3. No more shall they in bondage toil
Let my people go;
Let me come out with Egypt's spoil,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

4. The Lord told Moses what to do,
Let my people go;
To lead the children of Israel through,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

5. O come along Moses you'll not get lost,
Let my people go;
Stretch out your rod and come across,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

6. As Israel stood by the water side,
Let my people go;
At the command of God it did divide,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

7. When they had reached the other shore
Let my people go;
They sang a song of triumph o'er,
Let my people go,
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

8. Pharoh saith he would go across,
Let my people go,
But Pharoh and his host were lost,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

9. This world's a wilderness of woe,
Let my people go;
O, let us on to Canaan go,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.

10. Your foes shall not before your stand
Let my people go;
And you'll possess fair Canaan's land
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharoh, let my people go.
