people down there would always be giving Doc something (There
is an edge of scorn on her voice here) Or havin' him
do sumpin round the house and they'd pay him the money and
he always could eat. He got out from his father. As soon as 
he got up some size, he just left there. He said that he
just--- just wasn't enough to eat there-- and he'd ruther
for his little sisters to have his part. He'd get
out and try to hustle round for himself, which he did. So
now he's got a wife and he's got a farm. He live on the highway
goin' out toward's pRaker  Place, and his wife carries the 
farm on. She's smart, she's real smart. She plows and she
chops her own potatoes. Doc hauls wood to town twice a week
and that's all he do. You know, he lost his leg recently.
They took his leg off. He's got artificial leg now and foot.
So all he do now is cut and haul wood to town and sell that.
Makes two and three dollars a week doing that. Some
time he make three dollars, cause he sells his woods a dollar
a load. Git a chance to carry two loads or three loads
he'll make three dollars.
How could a man like that, have a tough comin' up like that,
how could he believe that the Lord was so good to him?
Well, he said andI said so too he said he believed that
the Lord has made a way for him, he has made it and he believed
he's still makin it for him to live because he nuse to didn't 
have what he's got now. He nuse to didn't even have food to
eat and he do have food every day now. And he nuse to didn't
have it. He say the Lord made the way for him to get that. He
opened up the way for him to come in wid two mules.
