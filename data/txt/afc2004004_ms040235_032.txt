Dear Mr. Murison,

Thank you for your long, if discouraging letter.  It's just one more example of the unending kindness and courtesy of you Scots.

Of course there's a great deal of living balladry still to be found in this country, but it will take someone with a great deal more time than I have left to me.  I suppose I'll have to do with the excellent material I've found in the Islands and in Aberdeenshire.  A fellow American was here about ten years ago - a chap by the name of Carpenter - he worked with a dictaphone, I think, recorded a perfectly tremendous number of songs from the old people - left a trail that I ran into everywhere in Buchan.  This material is now in Duke University, in case anyone is interested, and I think Carpenter is dead.  It's never been published or used, as far as I know.

Well anyway, thanks for the note.
Sincerely yours,
(Alan Lomax)
