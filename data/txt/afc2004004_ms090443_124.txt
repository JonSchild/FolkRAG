Walter Brown Tape 5, Side 1
Wo
Come here boy
And harness up my team
I'm going out to the pit
But I feel so mean.
Mr. Brown has been riding
On his big white horse
He got little Johny
To call his boss.
I got my 41 colt
Strapped it on my side
But if somebody boy
Gonna take a ride.
Get up in the morning
You hear that [ding dong ring]
Ding dong ring
You hear that
Old night watchman
Singing that
Lonesome song.
Saying
Get up boy
Ain't you 
Ready to go.
Saying it's 
Just not ten
Minutes
After four.
Say but
After a while
It be a 
Five o'clock.
Saying
That old man
Gonna want you
In that lot. (Then he hit that gong:)
Bong Bong Bong â€¦
Hey. Hey. Hey. Boy.
I don't want you
But the 
Captain do.
Saying that

But that's
All I can do.

And put
On your clothes.
Saying and

To get
Ready to roll.
