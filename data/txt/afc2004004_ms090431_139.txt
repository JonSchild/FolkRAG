Interview About the Secular Songs.  Alec Robertson. 

R:  Then I knew the words.  I knew a lot of the oldtime "Coon" songs,
I reckon.  I practiced them.  I could sit down here all day and I
could think of them fast "Coon" songs.  But they getting old and just
coming t'rough the radio, and they could knock.  Why, I composed a
song -- what was that song? -- not "Next to the Blue Ridge Mountain" 
but "Lay Your Little Hands in Mine".  Yeah, I composed all that. 
A:  Did you ever play for any square dances, Alec? 
R:  Oh, yessir.
A:  Now, look -- these records aren't gong on the radio.  They're just
going down in books, and I want you to sing me just a few little
snatches of the tunes that they used to sing for square dances.
R:  Yeah.  I don't believe I want to play it,  because I tell you, it's 
just not my profession -- all that suqare dance business and any composition,
you see, I know it would be for me.  Say, will they be
broadcast?
A:  No.  They won't be broadcast.  These songs all won't be broadcast.
They're just going to be put away in history.  It'sjust oldtime
history that I'm getting.
R:  I see.  I see.
A:  If I were [going to]  making records to broadcast, I'd have to get 
a whole band and all.
R:  I see .  A book?
A:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well, that's a different thing.  I'll give you those.
A:  Yes.  I just want you to sing [the tune]so I can write the music out.
