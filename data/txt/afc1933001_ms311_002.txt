Refrain

Hi yi A poor lone-some cow-boy, Hi yi, Oh
list to my song  Hi yi, a-bout a poor cow-boy a-bout 
a poor cow-boy who knew he done wrong.
Oh, once in the sad-dle I used to go dash-ing -
Once in the sad-dle I used to go gay  Went
first to the dram house and then to the card house, Got
shot in the breast and I'm dy-ing to day.

[*The Cowboy's lament*]
