THE COWBOY'S LAMENT

[I want no fenced-in graveyard
With snorin' souls about--
Just cache me in the desert
When my light goes out.]

[*1)*] As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,*
As I walked out in Laredo one day,
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen,
Wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay.

[*3)*] "Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,
Play the dead march as you carry me along;
Take me to the [prairie] [*/graveyard*] there lay the sod o'er me,
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.

[*2)*] "I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy"---
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by.
"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;
I am shot in the breast and I know I must die.

"Let sixteen gamblers come handle my coffin,
Let sixteen cowboys come sing me a song.
Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me,
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong.

[*3)*] "My friends and relations they live in the Nation,
They know not where their boy has gone.
He first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh, I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.

[* The beginning stanza of one version:
As I passed by Tom Sherman's barroom,
Tom Sherman's barroom quite early one morn,
I spied a young cowboy all dressed in his buckskins,
All dressed in his buckskins and fit for the grave.

Other versions begin:
As I rode up to the fragant barroom,
As I rode up to the barroom one day, etc.]
