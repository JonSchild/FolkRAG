Dear Alan:

1. The check from the
Library came today.
2. Also the blank vouchers.
3. Also the enclosed letter
from Johnny.
4. Also word from 
Shirley that Chris is yet en
route from Mobile to Charleston
or still waiting at the latter
place. His vessel has now been
held up five months. Democracies
are not [good] effective
war engines.
I'm still feeling better.
Father

[*I'll be thinking of you on Father's day -
and [evry] every day. And I am not reproaching
you.*]
