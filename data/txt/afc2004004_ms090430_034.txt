after the Civil War.  The lands were beginning to show exhaustion, and the trek to the newer lands of the west had already started.  The presence of nearby large cities encouraged larger planters to keep their residences there.  Absentee ownership steadily increased and, as the great estates ceased to be profitable and fell into debt, the banks and loan companies came into possession.

Of the 837 white owners in Greene County having more than fifty acres, only 278 were listed as farmers by the 1930 Census.  According to Arthur Raper the volume of Greene's absentee landownership in tracts of 500 acres and over increased, roughly, from 26,000 acres in 1919 to 36,000 in 1934, nearly half of which is in the hands of loan companies.  During the same period the aggregate acreage owned by large resident owners decreased, roughly for 90,000 to 81,000 acres.  The present owners of the large estates, as Raper describes them, area class of quasi-absentee owners who own land but pay very little attention to its cultivation.  Throughout this drastic change the cotton farmers have remained aware only of increasing difficulty and hard times.  Over half the white farmers and over nine-tenths of the Negro farmers in Green County were tenants in 1930.  Tenants in the County were divided almost equally, one-third cash tenants, one-third croppers, and one-third share renters.  Cash renters or fixed renters appear with frequency on the land of the absentee owners who have no particular interest in the land and only seek returns from it without the responsibility of supervision or crop risk.  Cash renting is not in the tradition of plantation farming.  The share-renting system of farming, where the tenant owns his work animals and pays one-fourth or one-third of his crop for rent, is historically
