2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 18, p. 2

Livin Humble

Yeah, the storm did rise, 
An' the wind did blow, 
It drifted the ship
From sho' to sho', 
The captain on the ship
Got trouble in mind, 
He wondered what was the matter
That this ship wouldn't sail, 
He sent a man down to search the ship, 
He searched the ship from bottom to top, 
He found a man there lyin' fast asleep, 
He said, "Wake up, wake up, don't sleep; it's a man,"
Said, "Godamight Aaron's gonna 'stroy this lan'."
(CHORUS #2)

Oh, Jonah rose up
In a mighty shout, 
Said, "I'm the man,
"I wantchya cast me out."
They cast ol' Jonah right overboa'd, 
Along come a whale and swallowed Jonah whole.

CHORUS:
Livin' humble, 
Humble, 
Humble yourself, the bell done rung, 
He prayed humble, 
Humble, Lord, 
Humble yourself, the bell done rung, 
Oh, Jonah, he prayed, the bell done ring, 
In a whale, they say, the bell done ring, 
Oh, Jonah cried out, the bell done ring, 
"Oh, Lord, here am I," the bell done ring.
