WHEN THAT TRAIN MAKE HIS LAST STATION BLOW

Old mens, young men,
Womens and girls and boys,
Whether you are prepared or not,
Children, we all are got to go
When that train make his last station blow.

CHORUS:
When that train make his last station blow,
Oh, whether we are prepared or not,
Children, we all are got to go
When that train make his last station blow.

You better get your ticket,
You better get it in time,
You better get religion
And you better plumb the line
Because, whether you are prepared or not,
Children, we all have got to go
When that train make his last station blow.  (CHORUS)

Well, rich man, poor man,
Lame man, blind and low,
Now, whether your are prepared or not,
Children, we all [have] are got to go
When that train make his last station blow.
