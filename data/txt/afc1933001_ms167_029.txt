The Farmer,

There was  a young farmer that lived by the Sea;
the nicest young farmer you ever did see;
He played with his pea-nuts and popcorn of [your;] yore;
He met a young lady he thought was a; decent young lady
ah playing in the grass, and when she turned over he
saw her; features and and fashions as slick as a duck;
she told him she thought she could teach him to bring up
his children and teach them to-knit while the boys in the
barnyard were shoveling up-contents and mowing the grass.
If you don't like my story you can kiss my-daughter in
the parler while winding the clock with a string of her
ribbon around her poodle dog poodle same a before if
you don't like my story I'll tell it no more.
