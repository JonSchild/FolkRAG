204 Al [*Rich Old Lady*]
Onced Knowed An Old Lady
[JOHNNY SANDS]

Sung by James Baker, (Iron Head), Sugarland, Texas.*
(An Americanized version of The Wife of Kelso 
or The Wiley Auld Couple.)

Once I knowed old lady;
Round Tennessee she dwell.
She had a lovin' husband,
But she loved other mens as well.

Chorus: 
Love my darling, oh,   or Too outrowdy, babe,
I love my darling, oh.       Too outrowdy, babe.

"I'm goin' down to the doctor's shop
Just as straight as I can go;
See if I can't find something roun' that place
And run my husband blin'."

She only found two marrow bones
An' she told him to eat them all.
Says, "My dear wife, I'm blind now,
And jus' cain' see at all."

"I would go and drown myself
If I only knew the way."
Says, "Now, my dear, come and go with me;
Mother's 'fraid you'll run astray."

Goes way down by the riverside
For to see her old man drown.
"My dear kind wife, I cannot drown
Unless you shove me in."

She gits way back, takes a little runnin' start,
Gonna shove her old man in;
Old man jumps just a little one side
An' headlong she jumps in.

She whoops and she hollered
Just as loud as any woman could squall;
Old man know his sweet wife's dying
An' cannot see at all.

Old man bein' so kind-hearted,
Knowin', too, his sweet wife could not swim;
Reached right out and got a long pole
And he shove her further in.

Come all you young, hasty women, 
An' take warnin' after me;
Never try to drown a po' old man
That's blind so he cannot see.

*Iron Head called this song, "The Rich Old Lady."
