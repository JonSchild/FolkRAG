I'M GONNA LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR MY LORD - Bessie
Jones and (?)

chorus:  I'm a-gonna lay down, lay down
I'm a-gonna lay down my life for my lord.
1)  O when them gamblers get together
How they gamble like one another
But I'm a-gonna lay down my life for my lord.
2)  O when them drunkards get together
How they can drink like one another.
But I'm a-gonna lay down my life for my Lord.
3)  Then John said to lay down my life
Yes he said 'lay down, lay down'
John said to lay down my life for my Lord.
4)  Then Luke said to lay down, lay down
O Luke said to lay down, lay down
Yeah Luke said to lay down my life for my Lord.
5)  O when them dancers get together
How they can dominize one another
But I'm gonna lay down my life for my Lord.
6)  O when them liars get together
How they can lie like one another
But I'm a-gonna lay down my life for my Lord.
(chorus)
