of the railroad with the river for dominance was to be seen reflected
in the contest of Clarksdale and Friars Point for the county seat.
Friars Point, at the edge of the county, on the river, was no longer
regarded as the most important terminal for trade and travel. Clarksdale

The contest was resolved in a compromise to be found in
several delta counties -- division of the county into two administrative
districts -- one on the railroad and the other on the river. The
railroad later won and Clarksdale became the county seat and the trade
center of the county.
The railroad was not subject to the natural forces as was the river
which was not man's making and not subject to his control. The increasingly
effective levee did not control the river but simply restrained
it and ever stronger levees were necessary to maintain this restraint.
Levees were built across once fertile fields on the river's edge. Land
"behind" the levee, between the levee and the river, was subject to

with some sense of security. Planters with the sense of security the
levee gave cleared and drained the swamps and lowlands and put them
