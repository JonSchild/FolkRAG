An' so, I made up my min'; I got up my nerve -- the lady on --
they jus' kep' talkin'.   I ask the lady did she stay in Wes'
Green?  She say, "Yeah, I stay there, in Wes' Green."  I say. . .
She say, "You goin' to Wes' Green?"  I say, "Tha's where I'm 
goin'.   I say,  I'm goin' to see a frien' a mine."  "I don'
know that you know 'er, in Wes' Green."   Say, "If anybody
there, I know her!"   She rough, though, big rough tough woman.
So I ask her about Catherine.   Say, 'Yeah!   Catherine stay
right on in front of me; I carry you right to her do'."   I was
glad then!    I tell ya, I was a glad chile!
            Ha, ha.  You know what I had?  I had a hat on my head.
I had a coat on, a brown ol' coat with a big fur collar, an'

two dresses down in there.
TL:        Tha's all you owned?!

to Catherine.   Catherine was so glad to see me.   So we -- I
stayed there with Catherine (now pronounced Cath-er-een'), I reckon
about three weeks.   But I got a job, ya know.  I stay there at
Catherine [ab] around about three weeks.  A sick lady was down on
[at] the end of that place, wary (very) sick, by herself.   An'
I would go see 'er after Catherine                 down there,
an' carry food an' stuff.   An' I told Catherine about me livin'
with her a while, you know?    That I could, ah, he'p. 'er.  Catherine
