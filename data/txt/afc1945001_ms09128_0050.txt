"Rumors" 
A story floating about Washington is to the
effect that Hitler is now "hitting the bottle,"
This would amplify an early rumor as
follows:  The Fuehrer is dead, dead drunk. 
"Joke" 
Tojo tells his countrymen that dark days lie
ahead.  Meanwhile the Jap towel ration is, 
One a year, scarcely enough for the crying
there is to do. 

What's good of history if people won't learn 
from it?  The other war was nearly lost
before we got and licked the subs. 

"A slip of the lip will sink a ship" 
"Pay your taxes to lick the axis." 
"Save your oil and grease to tear the Jap to pieces. 

Hitler don't like the R.A.F. because he said 
when they drop bombs it will make him deaf. 

Hitler is so busy attending to the Russian's 
that he can't make speeches in Germany.
