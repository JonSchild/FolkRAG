Dear Alan: I donate my 64 air
mail stamps to the War Effort.
If you wish some interviews
with the ordinary man of the street
addressed to the President (and Mrs. Roosevelt) and talking
him in one-syllable Anglo-Saxon
words what they think of him
and the labor leaders attempting
to preserve "social gains" in the
present terrible emergency, I can
send you some records that
will give the jitters to Jerry's
delicately balanced machinery.

This morning we had a
short note from Bess.
