[*Mr. Alan Lomax     -2-     November 10, 1941*]

the occasion of your next visit to New York City,
you communicate with me and we have a conference,
at which I hope it will be possible for Burl
Ives to be present. Perhaps then we can thresh
this whole situation out to the satisfaction of
all concerned.
     Please be assured that it is my earnest
desire to conclude this situation in the friendliest
possible manner.

Sincerely,
Charles B. Seton
