210 Federal Building,
Memphis, Tennessee

Dear Mrs. Miles:

            I should like to be of help to you in your work. If you could
find time to run in ever so often, I would be able to tell you things
I have heard which at the moment I would not have time to jot down.

            The only thing we heard from Tuesday to Friday was: "Have you
heard we are going to have a race riot?" each one adding a little
more to it.

            We even had men calling their wives and telling them not to
start home alone, that they would call for them. I went so far as
to ask them what fact it was based on, and each one would say: "So
and so told some member of the family."

            I don't feel that I have helped you but at some other date I may
be able to serve you.

                                                                              Yours very truly,

                                                                              Beauton Gooding
