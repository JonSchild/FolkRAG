SARA OGAN'S 
COME ON FRIENDS AND LET'S GO DOWN/.

All I can say is that I've got a dam good idea of what
Sara was a getting at when she sang, Come On Friends and Let's
Go Down.

Sounds a lot like a preacher in the south --- a singing and
a preaching at the top of his voice, Come On Friends and Let's
go Down and --- get babptized.

But Sara sings like a girl that has been babptized. She
has been babptized with coal dust, and it killed her dad, and
it killed her loving husband, and it killed her little baby boy, 
and she has been baptized in that Spirit of Life that is better
and stronger and purer than water --- the baptizm of Experience.

I aint got nothing against water --- water's all right as 
far as it goes, but Sara's song starts in where water leaves off:
