It was on Saturday night, Jesse was at home
Talking to his family brave,
Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night*
And laid poor Jesse in his grave.

The people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death,
And wondered how he ever came to die
It was one of the gang called little Robert Ford,
He shot poor Jesse on the sly.

Jesse went to his rest with his hand on his breast;
The devil will be upon his knee.
He was born one day in the County of Clay
And came from a solitary race.

Jesse went down to the old man town
Thinking he would do as he'd please;
But he will dwell in the City of Hell
And he'll go to the devil on his knees.

This song was made by Billy Gashade, +
As soon as the news did arrive;
He said there was no man with the law in his hand
Who could take Jesse James when alive.

* "Robert Ford's pistol ball knocked him tumbling from the wall."  Jesse was hanging a picture as Ford, a guest and supposed friend shot him from behind.
+ The last stanza was made by a Missouri Negro.

Second Version*

* From eastern Tennessee mountain whites, from memory, as given by C. H. Ferrow, "Songs and Rhymes of the South," Journal of American Folk Lore, Vol. XXV, p. 137.

Jesse James was a man who traveled through the land,
Stealin' an' robbin wuz 'is trade;
But a dirty little coward by the name of Robert Howard
Laid Jesse James in 'is grave.

Pore Jesse James! Pore Jesse James!
Laid Jesse James in 'is grave;
En a dirty little coward by the name of Robert Howard
Laid Jesse James in 'is grave.
