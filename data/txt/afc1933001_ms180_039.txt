Dear Alan,
I thought you might like to
know about my latest project.
Not a bad job either, and with a
fairly favorable format! Lots of
times I think about you and wish
I knew what you were thinking these
days. I hear on every hand what
you're doing, and heartily approve.
Won't you come to see us next time
you're in Chicago? Vic has wanted to
know you all this time. As ever,
Sarah Michie Harris
