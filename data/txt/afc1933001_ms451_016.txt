1587B                (3)

Down in the lions' den he boldly entered,
The lions being both wild and fierce,
He marched around and in among them,
[Then]Safely returned [the]her fan again.

When she saw her true lover 
coming,
Seeing no harm had been done to him,
She threw herself against his bosom,
Saying, "Here is the prize that you
have won."
