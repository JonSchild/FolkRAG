That never happened while in Britain it - 
itself, because the provincial life is held
on there in a way.  But Scots, Highlander,
ah, Lowlander, ah, Irish, Protestant, Catholic,

independent of all the tragedies that produced
it.  It has its own firepower, its own growing

strictness of their grandmother's life, ah,
whose skirts always came clean - clear down
to their shoe-tops, showing their legs off
in front of their proud male relatives, and 
their marvellous new precision dances that
could match ah, ah, the can-cans of Paris,
ah the bluegrass orchestra playing as, as, as
hot as ah, as a five piece New Orleans 
jazz band, with ah new kinds of songs
