1- I heard one woman say she didn't understand
why we never hear in large sums the amount
of American soldiers who have been killed.
We are always hearing of some important battle
and how many enemies were killed but they
don't tell so much about our soldiers. Of
course, we got reports on neighborhood boy but
that not what we want.
2- One German General said the Americans were
starving. The other one asked why. The general
said we were all going around asking "what's
cooking."
2- I wonder what kind of people would
patronize a black market.
