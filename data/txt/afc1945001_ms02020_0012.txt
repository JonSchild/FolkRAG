PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
BUREAU OF INTELLIGENCE REPORT NO. 7.
REPORT OF RUMORS

August 15, 1942

One of the outstanding features of the week is the
favorable comment that is being heard concerning the prompt
announcement made by Admiral King to the effect that ‘while we
are suffering severe losses in the Solomon Island engagement,
we are attacking.’  On the streets it is a common occurrence to
hear people say that this is the first time in the history of
World War No.II that we knew what was going on while it was going
on.  Many have paid high compliments to the promptness with which
the Washington office of the Office of War Information has
handled this informational feature.
A banker, a retired business-man, and insurance salesman,
and a government employee were in the discussion group that
remarked ‘they expected losses as a result of such an engagement
and were following the progress of the battle with intense
interest.’  However, at least one man felt that London was
obtaining more information and getting it much sooner than we
were, as much of the news released was being made through London.
Another one commented on the fact that news was prompt and adequate
at the outset of the engagement but as time went on but little
additional news and information was released.
