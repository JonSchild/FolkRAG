[ORIGINAL IN "SMITH, BESSIE" CS file]

    A photostatic copy of the death certificate of Bessie
Smith, obtained from the Mississippi State Board of Helath, includes
the following information:

    Bessie Smith was admitted to, and died in, the
Afro-American Hospital, Clarksdale, Miss. The medical certificate
of death is signed by Dr. W. H. Brandon, Clarksdale.

    She died at 11:30 A.M., September 26, 1937, after an
accident on the same day on Highway 61 between Lyon and Lula, a
stretch of road near Clarksdale, when her auto struck a parked truck.

    "The principal cause of death and related causes of
importance", to quote the language of the certificate, "in order of
onset", were "Shock. Possible internal injuries. Compound comminuted
fractures of right humerus, radius, and ulna". The space entitled
"Contributory causes of importance not related to principal cause" is
not filled in.

    In a space provided to record any operation performed,
the physician states "Amputation right arm".

    The first cause of death listed, "shock", is, in the
medical sense, a profound depression of vitality affecting the nervous
system so much as often to be fatal; it has nothing to do with loss of
blood. There is no mention of hemorrhage anywhere in the certificate.
