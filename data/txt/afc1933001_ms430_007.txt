Ten little sweatshops, the bosses thought
'twas fine
The union organized one, then there were nine.

Nine little sweatshops, working very late,
Another bunch of workers struck, then there
were eight.

Eight little sweatshops, stinking to high heaven,
The sanitary code got one, then there were seven.

Seven little sweatshops, you should hear the
kicks
The workers made about their pay-then there
were six.

Six little sweatshops, the union made a drive
And picketed another one-then there were five.

Five little sweatshops, rotten to the core,
Another signed up with the union-then there
were four.

Four little sweatshops, they're going fast, you see,
One sold out to another-then there were three.

Three little sweatshops, the workers vowed to sue
For back wages due to them-then there were two.

Two little sweatshops, another battle won
By union solidarity-then there was one.

One lousy sweatshop, our tale is almost done-
All of them were organized and now there are none!
