Jimmy MacBeth (contd.)
William Shakespeare lies dying         1 min. 15 secs
[It was said that my great grandfather met the witches
 at Brodie o' Brodie, Brodie Castle as it were , but I
didn't really believe that - Oh no, I don't think that
was quite true but it was said to believe it was true
enough] and, of course, William Shakespeare wrote the
play called "MacBeth and the Witches."[*4.10*]

I have seen it in Aberdeen and Dundee.      I enjoyed the
part, especially that part where Shakespeare -- that his
daughter came to see him lying dying on his bed and,
of course, it was not her father that she came to see.
It was more his cash, and she looked into the mirror and
started painting her cheeks red and she turned round
to her father and said: "Father, how do I look now?"
An William Shakespeare put out his withered hand and
he says: "Vanity, vanity, always vanity;    them that
takes my purse takes my trash, but them that takes away my
good name takes my all."
Of course, it wasn't Shakespeare that wrote that - 
it was Solomon.

[*Beginning 1*] Come all ye tramps and hawkers
Ye gatherers ablaw
That tramps the country round and round
Come listen ane an' a'
I'll tell to you a rovin' tale
And sights that I have seen 
It's far up into the snow[ing]y north
[*30''*] And south by Gretna Green                (please confirm)
Ofttimes I've laughed unto myself 
When trudging on the road
With a bag ablow upon my back
[With] my face's as broon'[e]s a toad
Wi'[th] camps and cakes and tattie scones
Cheese and braxy ham,
It's nae thinking [where] whare I'm comin' frae
Nor [where] whare I'm gang tae gang.

I have been a good while on the road.   It was all right 
at one time but it is getting a thing of the past now.
