"I ain't got nowhere to buy it at; ain' none a my folks got nowhere
to buy it, buy, buy it from."  Say, "One a your folks can spend it.
You'll soon git it back."  I don't guess they know what I mean,
but I mean every word I say.
     You see! 'Cause I know that, that, that's a, we are
out of, a [brake] break.  We got no [brake] break much, 'lessen I wanna go to a
joint, where they let you have the joints an' jook, but they
makin' you pay so much for it.  So they still gittin' ya, all
time.
     But as I started to say about this junk, hit don't mean
nothin' about that.  People wants to live good dat -- like the
Lord say, enough land and enough wood and enough trees an' everything
for every body have a lil' house to stay in.  An' that's
all folks wanna do; to live good an' have the opportunity a not
runnin' from you on account a color  Or you runnin' from me on
account a color.  An' God -- An' how ya gonna meet in Heaven,
if ya cain't -- As, as I tol' the white lady I work with down
home, I said, "If you cain't stay with me here, you ain't no use
a you knockin' on Heaven's do'.  Because you just ain't gonna git
there."  An' that's written:  If you cain't live with me here,
you ain't no use a knockin' on the door.  An' if you scorn me here
an' you go up there an' scorn, they ain't no scorn in Heaven, not
one inch of it, ya see?  'Cause you human.  An' if you 'low me a 
chance, I'll live just as good as you.  An' that's all.
     And won't bother you.  It's written, the colored folks will
not bother white peoples if they just don't bother them in, in
entries (?) an' livin' lives, in allow 'em livin'.  You never
hardly hear talk -- You don't hear talk of 'em goin'ta, settin'
nobody's house on fire an' tryin' ta keep them from...an' burnin' up
