Down and Out, (Arnold)
Kokomo Arnold, Decca 7163, 90317A

Says I ain't got no airplane,
Ain't got no automobile,
[I ain't got no money,]
I ain't got no money,
I guess I have to rob and steal,
Chorus:
For when I wake up in the mornin',
I cain' eat a decent meal,
I had bad luck in my family,
I guess you know jus' how I feel.

When I had plenty money,
And plenty clothes,
These Chicago women followed me
In big droves.   Cho.

Says, I asked my mama x
To take me back once mo'x,
She said, "You ain't got no money,
Sweet papa, there is the do'."
Cho.      

Now my women standin' on the corner,
With they weekly pay,
If they think I want to borry sompen,
They turn and go another way.
Cho.

When I make this [weekly]payday,
Get my money in my hand,
You women needn't to come a-runnin',
You can find another man.
'Cause when I wake up in the mawnin'
I'm sho gonna eat a decent meal.
etc.
