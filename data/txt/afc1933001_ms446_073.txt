58
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The day is past and gone, 
     The evening shades appear ; 
O, may we all remember well
     The night of death is near. 

We lay our garments by, 
     Upon our beds to rest ; 
So death will soon disrobe us all
     Of what we here possess. 

Lord, keep us safe this night,
     Secure from all our fears ; 
May angels guard us while we sleep
     Till morning light appears. 

And if we early rise, 
     And view the unwearied sun, 
May we set out to win the prize, 
     And after glory run. 

And when our days are past
     And we from time remove, 
O, May we in Thy bosom rest, 
     The bosom of Thy love.

No. 58 

When I can read my title clear, 
     To mansions in the skies, 
I'll bid farewell to every fear, 
     And wipe my weeping eyes. 

Should earth against my soul engage,
     And fiery darts be hurled, 
Then I can smile at Satan's rage
     And face a frowning world. 

Let cares like a wild deluge come,
     And storms of sorrow fall, 
May I but safely reach my home, 
     My God, my heaven, my all.
