[*Bill & Sonny*]

Well, it's one thing I can say about a rale ugly
man. You know some people say a [a] man just ugly because he's
got wrinkles in his face or you're dark or something like that,
on account of his color or his race. What we're tryin to get down
to is a manthat's really ugly just for himself, make no difference
what color he is. What's the ugliest man you ever seen,   ?

Bill, the ugliest man I ever saw---beginning to chuckle. . .

Don't say it now, cause I think you're gonna talk
about me. . .

. . .was Uncle Joe. Every time he'd look in the mirror , he'd
faint.

I seed a man once--honest to God, it's true--I seed a man
that was so ugly he had to back up to a dipper to get water out
the pail. But they say there is a man uglier than that. Maybe you
know him, son. . .

Well, I'll tell you, see, Bill, there's a lot of people,
you know, just ugly cause they can't help it. Lots of um is ugly
cause they get hurt or something. But I have saw people just ordinary
ugly, just contrary ugly, ugly just cause they wanted to be. . .
just ugly. . . you know. . . 

One of these fellows that have just give up life, you
mean, cause you know they say God don't like ugly, so an ugly
man don't expect to go to heaven and he just give up life. . .

Yeah. I know a man that's so ugly you have to turn
a pot down over his head to let it break day. That's an ugly man. . .

So ugly peoples ashamed to be around him. . .

Unh-hunh, see, a lot of peoples is ugly is ugly for
you and a lot is ugly to you --that man was ugly [to] you--a real
ugly man.
