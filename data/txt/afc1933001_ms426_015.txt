PUT THE RED IN OUR FLAG

Tune-Oh Those Golden Slippers.

Oh the Farmer's Union am come to stay,
And you'll never see it stop 'til it wins the day.
'Tis a dollar for the corn and two dollars for the wheat,
And we'll never stop scrapping 'til we win.
We must save our homes and our kiddies, too,
To put them in slavery will never do;
And the mortgage load on all we own
Will be buried in the ocean in the morn.

Chorus-
Oh that Farmer's Union, Oh that Farmer's Union,
Farmer's Union I'm going to join,
Because I know it's right.
Oh that Farmer's Union, Oh that Farmer's Union,
Farmer's Union I'm going to join,
And fight with all my might.

Oh the Union flag am to float on high
To tell the folks we'll n'er say die,
'Til we win the fight, for the farmer's right,
And give the boys a happy chance to live.
We must change the plan, that wrecks brother man,
And fulfill the dream of American,
Put the red in our flag and the white and the blue,
Make the story of America, true.

THAT'S F.-E.-C.-U.

Tune-Peggy O'Neil.

If they fight and never die, that's F-E-C-U,
If they look up at the sky, that's F-E-C-U.
If they smile when the world is all blue,
If they battle when others are through,
Stick to it win or lose, never give up to blues,
That's F-E-C-U.

If they think it can be "did", that's F-E-C-U.
If they lose and still can "kid," that's F-E-C-U.
If they win out when others will fail,
If they laugh out, while others will wails
Do what cannot be done, do it and have some fun,
That's F-E-C-U.
