1. Now I know why I should fight and win; 
because in doing so I can help my American 
brothers put Hitler's can in the scrap, and 
slap a Jap off the map, which will make 
more room for the united nations to roll 
Mussolini around in the Greece he has 
heated.

II (A) The most disgusting remarks I have heard:

"Although we have heard of Rommel's 
prowess as a general in his skillful 
break through the Maginot line, yet our 
capable generals, both British and American, 
have let the elusive "Fox" retreat 
to a point of vantage and counterattack 
killing over half our men and capturing 
or destroying at least half of our latest 
tanks."

(B) "Why doesn't Roosevelt stop inflating his
 ego in hopes that he may inflate ours."
