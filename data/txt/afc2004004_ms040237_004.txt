Dear Alan Lomax,

I listened with pleasure to your "Mississippi Blues" programme on Wednesday night, and was just on the point of writing to tell you how much I enjoyed it when the post brought me that beautiful volume FOLK SONG U.S.A., with a casa bearing the "Compliments of the Author." 
Many, many thanks for a beautiful and interesting volume of songs - most of which are unknown to me, but all of which I intend to know
