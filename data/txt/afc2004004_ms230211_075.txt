T-47-1 The King and I
1) The King and I walked down the road together,
---go passing by,
The greatest one and I, a lonely begger
Walked hand and hand, the king and I.
Why he should care for me
[*T1096*]Will always be a mystery
He holds the whole world in his hand
But who am I.
And so my heart
---into wonder
Why we're together, the King and I.
47.2 Fine Castle - two choruses of girls - lovely singing and
recording.  Exc. use. (Recording often interrupted by
but recording can be repaired)
1) In a fine castle,
Do you hear my sissy-o (2)
I want one of them ---
Which of them do you want
I want Antoni ---
What will you give her ---
I will give her a wedding ring ---
That would not suit her ---
