Come along boys and listen to my tale,
I'll tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm trail,
Come-a-ti-yi-youpy-youpy-yea-youpy-yea , etc..
O a ten dollar hoss and a forty dollar saddle,
And I'm goin' punchin' Texas cattle,
I woke up one mornin' on the old Chisholm Trail,
Rope in my hand and a cow by the tail,
It's cloudy in the West and a-lookin' like rain,
And my blamed old slicker's in the wagon again,
xxxxxxxxx
Chorus twice here.
