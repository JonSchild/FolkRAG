Country Blues      Sung with guitar by Mackinley Morganfield, Stovall,
Miss.,  1941.  Recorded by Alan Lomax and John Work. 

   Mackinley Morganfield, nicknamed Muddy Waters, a shy, handsome
young Negro man,  lives and works on a huge cotton plantation near the
Mississippi River near Clarksdale, Mississippi.  Saturday evenings
he makes a few dollars by playing for local dances and parties of his
Negro neighbors.  He learned to play the guitar only three years ago,
learning painfully finger by finger from a friend.  Since that time
he has picked up a great deal more by listening to commercial records
of blues guitarists from other parts of the country.  His style is 
largely derived from the records of Robert Johnson, who recorded for
Columbia Phonograph Company in the 1920's,  who grew up only a few
miles away,  and whom Muddy Waters never saw, face to face. 

   Muddy Waters' blues represent what might be called an American 
equivalent of the flamenco style  - - a complex, subtle controlled
interweaving of the melodic line with an intricate and varied guitar
accompaniment.  He plays with a broken bottle neck on the little
finger of his left hand (again an American adaptation of so-called
Hawaiian style),  sometimes using the first three fingers of his left
hand to fret the instrument, sometimes using the bottleneck.

   Both of these blues talk about trouble between man and women,
both are songs expressive of the anxiety, frustration and lack of
security that seems to typify the relations of Negro couples.  Muddy
Waters told me he composed "I Be's Troubled" while he was changing a
tire.
