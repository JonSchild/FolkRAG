[*1*] Group of business men. 8-14-42: "Well, you know the only reason they have got this Waac army is so that Eleanor can have an army to be head of." [*1*]
[*1*] Girl with friend in service. 8-12-42: "I wrote my fellow and asked him what he thought about my joining the Waacs and he said he thought the Waacs were a lot of foolishness, just like everyone else does." [*2*]
[*1*] Employment official. 8-15-42: "There is a general rumor out at Fort Des Moines that the buildings being built as dormitories for the Waacs are really hospitals. A typical statement goes like this - 'You can call this a dormitory if you like, but it smells like a hospital to me.'' [*3*]
[*1*] Prominent business man, 8-14-42: "You sit over at the Des Moines Club and you hear constant criticism of this women's army as being ridiculously expensive and unnecessary." [*4*]

[*1*] Employment official. 8-15-42: "I heard a Des Moines radio commentator talking about the Waacs and she spoke of many of them never having done their own housework before and being completely befuddled about how to go about taking care of their clothes and equipment. She also mentioned that the girls are getting a lot more drill than they had expected to." [*6*]
[*1*] Woman worker. 8-12-42: "If they have such a bad type of woman for their officers, what can they ever get for their privates?" [*7*]
[*1*] Young business woman. 8-10-42: "Putting the Waacs into uniforms is masculinizing them and will have a long-time effect on social relations between the sexes." [*8*]
