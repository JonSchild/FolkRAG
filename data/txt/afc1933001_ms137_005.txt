In view of the valuable contribution that James W. Green of St.
James , Beaver Island , Michigan, has made to the Archive of American
Folk Song in recording for the Archive 57 ballads and ballad
fragments on 23 records and in view of the fact that Mr. Green
has promised to furnish the Archive with manuscript copies of at
least twenty additional ballads, I reccomend that a payment of fifteen
dollars ($15) be made Mr. Green as a recompense for his valuable
services.
