            Boy! This war really hit me.
 Drink less coffee
Use less tea
Boy ! this war really hit me

Walk all day
Get less pay
No shoes
Then you get the blues
Boy! this war really hit me

I'll tell Hitler he's just a jerk
Structing around in his stupt shirt
I dont mind
Far I've incline
to tell him whats on my mind
But on second thought
Gee! this war really hit me

When you sit down to eat
think of who you might
       defeat
By using over your weekly
       points
Lets tell em off, lets break
their joints
By buying bonds & stamps
But on the other hand
Inspite of love & command
Hasnt this war really
hit you?
