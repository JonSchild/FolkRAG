Dear Mr. Spivacke:
    Answering your questions "approximately:" Trip to
Brownsville, Rio Grande City, Laredo and return, including side
trips 700 m., Time 14 days. Trip to Houston, Texas, Huntsville,
Little Rock, Ark., and Pine Bluff, Ark. including side trips, one
way (no doubling back) 10 days, 65 ., From Pine Bluff, via
Jackson, Miss., to Portham, Miss., 5 days, 400 ., From
Parchman, Miss to Livingston, Ala, to Gainesville, Fla. to Clemson
College, S. C., 5 days and side trips 4 days, 400 m., From
Clemson, S. C. to Murrell's Inlet, S. C. and side trips, 4 days,
250 m., Murrell's Inlet, S. C. to Washington 1 day 350 m.
    Maybe I can shorten the time somewhat. I'll try. Please
make any suggestions that occur to you. Some of this work is re-
recording in spots where Alan said it was needed--either faulty
records or worn discs.
    Later I'll be glad to do Colorado, Mexico and Arizona for
you.

    Sincerely always,
    John A. Lomax

3550 miles, 49 days

P. S. I expect to stop at several out-of-the-way places. If I
need the batter and converter, I'll need 'em badly. You might
send one batter, fully charged, and the converter; or authorize
me to buy a battery if I should need it. Do whatever you think
best and is the least trouble to you.
