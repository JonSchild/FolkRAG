enough wid women to know what kind of a woman a man ought to have.
You see, a man let you do as you please, he don't care nothin bout
you. If a man cares about you, he's gon always wanna know where you
at. If you got a man, wouldn't you want to know where he's at?
An if your feet's not sore, you're gonna find out where he's at,
ain't you? Uh?
(If you're in love, are you jealous?)
God is a jealous God.
(Have you ever been tormented by jealousy?)
I had one woman, I couldn't git up to git a drenk of 
watah, but she would be right theah where I was at. She was too
jealous. Every woman I git holt of be like that. I don't like that.
I treat one so kind. I can kill you wid kindness. (blows his nose)
I nevah wait for a woman to ast me for anythang, you know, Miss
Lizybeth. I jes give me what I know they want. Yeah, I love to
do that. They always have been my make-up. Ever since I was a child
on up.
(Was there every any time when you were considered bad as a boy?)
Oh well, they might call it bad. But I wadn't bad. I
was jes devilish. I did anythang I felt like I wanted to do. If I
could git a kick out of it. You don't have ot be bad to do that.
(What d you feel like when you stand on a street corner
and sing. People pass by. What do you think about?)
(He coughs, clears his throat, and snuffles water up
into his nostrils). Wouldn't have nothin so serious I'm thinkin
bout. I have my min on what I'm doin.
(People give you money. What do you do with it?)
Well...Put it in my pocket till I git ready to put it
somewhere. Take it home. Give it to the old lady.
