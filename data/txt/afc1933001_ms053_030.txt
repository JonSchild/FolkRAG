Dear John:-

You and Don Robinson must have teamed up on me. Last
week I received a charming Xmas card from him and his lovely
wife Ann from far away Zamoanga (?), which old Robbie has
doctored up by writing a letter to me all over it. Today I received
the original -- the unique card from the House of Lomax
in its bosque setting with the personal note from you. The
genuineness, the sincerity of the latter did things to me on
the inside. When I recovered I found that I was still inarticulate.
The best I could muster was "Damned if John must not
think a lot of me!" My friend the feeling is reciprocated in
full plus.

I shall not read the road map to find myself out
yourward during the week coming up which I shall spend in Dallas.
With all good wishes to you and yours, especially to her
who gave up a cozy job guiding the toddling feet of co-eds
aright to assume the herculean task of rescuing one brand from
the burning.

Your as ever,
Edward Crane.
