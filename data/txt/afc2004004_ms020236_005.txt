nobody to dance with me.   Period.   You know, I never would do 
that, especially.   If they don't ask me, I sure won't ask them.
TL:       Do you make eyes at them or anything?
BJ:       No!   What I want to make eyes at them for!  Um, no.
TL:       To get them to ask you to dance!
BJ:       Ummm.  No.
TL:       What you talkin' bout?   That's what I do.
BJ:       Um, no. You do!   I don't make no eyes at ['em] no man.
TL:      That's the way you get them to ask you to dance!
BJ:       Oh, yeah?
TL:       How do you get them to ask you to dance?
BJ:       Um, [they] he asks what [they] we want to. What we don't wants 
gone.  None of their business.  I ain't  gonna ask him.   I don't 
know why he ask me, but I ain' gonna make no eyes at no man.
TL:       You stood and you watched everybody dancing?
BJ:       I was                                                                        ?
I sit an' watch them peoples dancin'.
TL:       And you picked out in your head, though. . .
BJ:       I had in my mind, though:   that one over yonder, [that he's a] that one 
[bad  one other] over there; he can't get around so well. He, he, he!
TL:       If he asks you, you won't go, huh?
BJ:       Yeah! I's gone.  That's nosuh, he ain't doin' 
so well.  If he ever asked me to dance, I'd go.   Ha, ha,ha.  Well, 
that one over yonder, he's dyin'; I ain't gonna dance with him.
Why, I'd make myself ashamed.   That lil' girl what dance with
him is doin' sumpin'.   I ain't gonna dance with him. . . But I didn't 
do much of that.   Period.   No. . .I liked to play cards much better. 
Card [playin'] games you know, fun game.   An' I  liketed that best.   I'd get 
to the table and play all the time.   I liketed that 
better than I did dancin'.   I had a cousin, she. . .
TL:       You mean you never, ever once found somebody on the 
dance floor you really wanted to dance with and you never, ever 
tried to figure out a way to get him to dance with you?
BJ:       No-o.
TL:       Like steppin' in front of him or sumpin?
BJ:       No.   A girl tol' me [about] that one time.   About a boy. 
Not for dancin'; jus' about a boy.   She said she liked this boy, 
you know, she really liketed him.   She said she was
