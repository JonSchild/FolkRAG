vellum in books containing the
names of women killed in the
war with an assurance from 
"our queen that the war could
never have been fought without
the women" - dying in the
street, soft limbs blasted apart
by bombs, flying bombs striking
softened bearing flesh - the
voice goes on in the tender
grey lit chapel, covering with
soft old querulous tones the
sorrow of violence - the now
where women lie in their homes 
with their garden when
war comes -

Tapestries of the Sybles predicting
Christ's torments done in rose &
blue look down, in the tomb
room of the subtle Bede's tomb
