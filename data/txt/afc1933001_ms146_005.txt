Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Your letter of May 25 addressed to Mr. Frank Walker has
been referred to the writer for attention and reply.

We note that Mr. Lomax would like to discuss with us the
matter of Victor recordings of the type of material in 
which he is particularly interested.

You may assure Mr. Lomax that we will be happy to co-operate 
with him to the best of our ability and if he will call at 
our office any day from Monday through Friday between the
hours of nine to five, I will be glad to talk with him and
give him every possible assistance.

We assume Mr. Lomax intends to make his visit real soon.
Otherwise, it would be advisable to let me know because of 
the possibility of being away later in the summer.

Very truly yours,
E. C. Forman
