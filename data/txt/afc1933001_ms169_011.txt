If you have made such assertions to Mr. Garmaize or
anyone else, and haven't immediately by you the conclusive proof
that "Alla En El Rancho Grande" is in the public domain, please
write me a letter stating that it was your belief that the piece
was in the public domain, but that you are perfectly willing to
abide by Mr. Garmaize 's statement that it is not, and that you
will not in the future maintain that it is, or even that it is your
opinion that it is, but rather that when in the future approached
in the matter you will state that you have learned from Mr. Garmaize 
that it is the contention of his clinet The Edward B. Marks Music
Corporation that the copyright is owned by it.

It is of the utmost importance that I receive a reply to
this airmail letter by return airmail.  Stamped envelopes are
enclosed to assist you in making a prompt reply.

Sincerely yours,
George P. Brett
