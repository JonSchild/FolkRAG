Mr. R. Keith Kane, Chief
Bureau of Intelligence
Office of War Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kane:

Your letter of August 5 asking for a study of
rumors current in Billings during the period
August 10 to August 15 came during my vacation
and I am sorry not to have been able to answer it.
If helpful and in time we could send you a
collection of rumors we have heard here recently.

In your letter of June 6 you asked for evidences
of post war thinking in our community, of
divisionist thought susceptible to Axis propaganda,
and forms of anti-Semitism. Some notes were ready
for the letter which I did not send after I read
of the change in the Office of Facts and Figures.
I can send this information also if it will be
useful in the work of your office.

I shall not be back to work until September 1.

Sincerly yours,
Margaret Fulmer
Librarian
