     An' the other man didn' tell 'im.  Then the other man tol'
'Im, said, said, "We, ah, is guilty of our, of our crime."  Ya

     An' so, therefore, hit's ah, all robbers, an', sometimes
some folks is robbers -- it's jes' like, ah, I say to myse'f,
uh, ah, in some things, in what I tol' ya a while ago.  Say
sometime ya jus' lay it out wit', wit' other people.  You know.
An' you ain' -- In, in yo' min', all the time, you know you
doin' wrong.  I-in your mind.  Well, you ain' gonna last too
long.  You got to git hard-hearted an' don't care.  Y-y-you know,
to keep a job like that.  That's all there is to it.  You got
to git a don't-care spirit.
     Jus' like when I was keepin' them girls' money.  If I'd a-got
hard-hearted an' they came on       , I'd as soon shoot some of
'em,ya see?  It, be-be-before I'd let them have the money.  But

person an' take  they natchul money an', an' rob them.  Take it
from them; it ain' none a your.  Or take they clo'es an things.
Oh, you got to be really nasty-hearted.  Your heart got to be
turnt against yourself.  You hear, hearin' folks, "I don't believe
myself."  Well, they in bad shape then, see?  Ain't nobody
know theyself, but you kin b'lieve yourself.  Ain' no human
be'n in the world know theirself.  Nobody.  You don't know whatcha
