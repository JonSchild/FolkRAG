DAVIE STEWART, TAPE 890
The dying Ploughboy:
1) The canny winds was sighin' soft around a lonely stable loft,
And through the skylight overheard,
The moonbeams wander around my head.
2) When something wi' my chest went wrong.
A vessel burst and the blood outsprung,
My days on earth will nae be lang,
For noo's my time and I maun gang.
3) The doctor left me in good cheer,
But something tells me that death is near.
And while the sun shines in thesky,
They'll lay me doon no mair to rise.
4) I mind it's but a week to morn
Since I was weel, and hairsting corn,
I'se fu' o' health and strength and fun,
As anyone among the young.
5) Fare-ye-weel, my dandy pair,
'Tis you I'll yoke or louse nea mair,
Fare-ye-weel, my plough, and with thine hand
I'll never more turn over fresh land.
6) Fare-ye-weel my friends and comrades dear,
My voice ye will nae langer hear,
Fare-ye-weel unto the setting sun,
My toll is o'er, my work is done.
7) i served my master weel and true,
My weel-done work I'll never rue,
And for a' my mirth I might have striven
To reach the fairest fields of heaven.
"That song comes from Aberdeenshire, a place called Pennen,
a farmhouse about half a mile from Pennen.  He was a farm-
servant and he went on into the bothy and he scribbled the
verses of the song with a piece of nail on the window glass.
It happened away years ago. -The window-pane is supposed to
be there yet today, in the chamer. (bothy).
