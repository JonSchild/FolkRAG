The judge come down off the stand
Had done plead little Frankie's case
He said Frankie you are free
Go and kill you another man
Albert was your man, but he is dead and gone
He was her man, but he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the graveyard
She fell down on her knees
Speak to me dear Albert and give my heart some ease
You was my man, but you dead and gone

Frankie went to the depot
To catch the evening train
She thought about what harm she done
And she slammed out her brains
Albert was her man, but now they both is dead and gone. 34.

The spiritual can on longer be said to be 'the natural expression of the mind and the mood of the plantation Negro" of to-day, for the "natural idiom of the Negro proletarian, the blues", is used to express the plantation Negro's mood of the present. In the past the plantation Negro sang of "the Pearly Gates and Dem Golden Slippers" as compensation for the hard life of this world, but now he expresses the realities of to-day by singing:

I'm just a po' cold nigger
Me and the white man and the boll weevil
All living off of cotton
The white man and the boll weevil
All getting fat
And here's po' me
I ain't got a dime
I'm just a po' cold nigger

Done worked all the summer
Done worked all the fall
And here comes Christmas
And I ain't got nothing at all
I'm just a po' cold nigger. 35.
