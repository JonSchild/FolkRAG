that one branch, thousands live!  Ya see?  Ya see?  Thousands
live.
     An' peoples besides!  Ya see?  Enjoyment.  So that's just the 
way that is by that.  You -- if you be bo'n again, then you is able
to bring on 10,000's, ya see?  Your own self.  Ya see?  By showin'
it in tender (?).  Whether they accept it or not.  'Cause they
gonna meet it in the Judgment.  Every word of God be spoken --
unto me, unto you, whether you heed to it or not -- hit's comin'
before you, ya see?
     It say, now, His word is good if it come from a brutish
mouth.  Ya know what a brutish mouth is?  [It] That's a sinner; I don't

TL:  Broomish?
BJ:  Brutish...Yeah, um-hum.  His word is good. If a sinner come

good things come from God.  He didn't know it; he was drunk.  But yet,
the good things come, come out.
TL:  From some strange places.
BJ:  That's right.  But that word was good.  Now, that person
might be ready to kill ya.  But that word was good, you see?  'Cause
God's word cannot be bad.  See, don't care how ya -- don't care who
give it, an' how it come, it cain't be bad.  'Cause it's God's word.
If they, if they tellin' you what He said, an' tellin' you, an'
tellin' you true.  An' that's why he said, "My word is good if it
come from a brutish mouth.  My word is still good."  You can hear
that same word an' git saved, an' that same brutish person go [straight] right
on to hell.  He said, "Though I done a-many good things."  See?
Many good things.  "But I lost my own soul," see?  See what I mean?
