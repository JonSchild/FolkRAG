nice and told me to come back that afternoon, that
a Mr. Patterson would be there who could probably put
me in contact with young French radicals and with
people in the youth movement in general. I
came back and talked about the Negro question
with Mr. Patterson, a Negro, all the afternoon. He
made a date for me with a young English boy, Michael
Wallace who is organizing the Youth Congress to
be held at Vassar this August. So at five am
all three met in a cafe and talked for over an hour.
Mr. Wallace is going to "arrange a rendezvous"
(everyone says that here, and it always tickles me) for me
with several other people in the Paris YCL for Friday, and
tomorrow I have a date with Mr. Patterson who is
extremely nice. So I'm beginning to get fixed up.
God, it's fun. They're both very interesting people.
    Mr. Patterson is American, and will be going
back to America soon he thinks. He's a party member, 
and is the only Negro with whom I have
not felt at least a little self-conscious. He's just
swell. I'm going to give him your address so he
can go to see you when he goes back home. I know
you'll like him.
    Michael Wallace looks about twenty and is like-
wise a swell guy. His job takes him everywhere; he
was in Vienna three days before the Anschluss  was
declared, and in Tschechoslovakia right after that.
