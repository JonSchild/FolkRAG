ASSISTANT HEADMASTER

September 5th 1941

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I might have know that such an expecially successful man would have turned out to be a Texan ! One day this Summer I heard a Florida orange executive admit freely that no matter how well any other part of the country might produce this or that article, some one in Texas was always certain to go him one better. I replied that I knew a family down in Texas by the name of Lomax !

The Wynn family is altogether delightful, parents and sons, too. The only possible deduction I can make is that we must have more and more boys from Texas. Toward that end I know you and Alan will help in any right way you can.

With warmest regards, always, from Choate and the St. Johns, I am

Very sincerely,

C. Wardell St. John
