Prof. George Lyman Kittredge
8 Hilliard Street
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Professor Kittredge:

On my way up to Cambridge during the holidays to attend
the Modern Language meetings, I fell ill on the train and was
obliged to take a return train to Washington, and to bed.

I had hoped, of course, to see you even though you had not
found the time to reply to my letter. I know that you are very busy 
with your own heavy labors, but I did hope to see you once more.

I am well along with my book, "The Adventures of  a Ballad
Hunter" and have promised Macmillan the copy by April 1. I am
dedicating the book to you, as a man who has been a great
inspiration and help in all the work that I have done. I do hope that
you can take the time soon to write your recollections of the visit
in addressing an audience of Negroes at their Ebenezer Baptist
Church. Also, some account of your impressions of the Mexican singer
in the Market Square.in San Antonio. What you would have to say
would be the bright spot in the book.

With deep appreciation and affection, I am, 

Sincerely yours, 

John. A Lomax
Honorary Curator of the 
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
