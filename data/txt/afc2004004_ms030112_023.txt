GARY:
Went around visiting her neighbor. He was like a 
man coming in, saying well my wife be in after a while. 
They all eat at the big house, they called it the big house then, 
were'nt much bigger than me, but anyhow. The bossman says to him 
says a when you get through eating I want you to come down here 
help me cut this cow down in the woods, ya know that was the time 
when people were killing calfs and things ya understand, 
selling beef, he says all right. He wasn't thinking about nothing, 
it just being a cow, you understand sure enough. He hurried up 
to get through eating go down to the woods and cut the cow down. 
And who was the cow, his wife, hanging up in the tree shot. Riddled 
with bullets. He didn't say nothing, he said wait till I go and 
get a sheet to put her in something.

LARRY:

GARY:
Some man was down there, said no, no don't let him go back 
but but the majority said yeah, let him go back and get sheet to 
put her in. He went to get a sheet.

LARRY:

rifle, you understand. 16 shot.

LARRY:
