Dear Mr. Spencer: 
I wish to state to you that you grievously misquoted me 
in the story about Jelly Roll in Down Beat. Even for an inspired
writer and folklorist it was an extraordinarily inaccurate 
quotation. But let that be. 

I wonder if you would not like to put your "Stagolee" and 
other folklore material in the Archive of American Folk-song. 
There's no particular urgency about this, and we could put any 
necessary restrictions on it; but this material should be 
in a safe place, and the safe place for it is in our central 
folklore depository. 

I will not soon forget our evening of singing together in 
Chicago. I hope we can repeat that some time. 
Best regards, 
Alan Lomax
