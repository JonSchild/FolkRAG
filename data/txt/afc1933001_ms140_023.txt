Farming (cont)
Pick a Bale of Cotton, from American Ballads and
Folk Songs, John A. Lomax
Seven Cent Cotton & Forty Cent Meat &
The Young Man Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn, copies of
which may be obtained from Farm Security
in the Department of Agriculture.
See Also: Negro Workaday Songs, Odum
On the Trail of Negro Folk Songs, Scarborough
2) Mountaineer songs - Folk Songs and Ballads of the Southern Appalachians,
Cecil Sharpe; here are moonshining songs, one
railroad work song (Swannanoa Town). I know of
no lumbering songs in the Sothern Mountains, and
none yet collected in the Oil industry. Perhaps
Dr. B. A. Botkin of the Federal Writers Project,
Vray Building, Washington D. C., could tell you
where some could be obtained.
3) Shipping - Mobile Bay or Roll that Cotton Down, from Roll
and Go, Joanna Colcord.
4) Rowing - In Afro-American Folk Songs, Krehbiel and Slave
Songs of the United States, Wm. Francis Allen,
there are several rowing songs in the Louisiana
Creole patois.
North Central: 
1) Farming - The American Songbag, Sandburg; a number of farmers'
songs may be found here, and, perhaps, more may
be had from Edwin F. Piper, University of Nebraska.
2) Lumberjack- Songs and Ballads of the Shanty Boy, Frans Rickaby.
Another interesting group of occupational songs has
been gathered by I. H. Walton, of the University of
Michigan. A volume is shortly to be published on
the subject, but he might be willing to loan some
of his material.
South West: If you cannot use the Spanish American songs in
Lomax or Sandburg, you might glance through the
publications of Charles Loomis on Southern Californian
and New Mexican songs.
