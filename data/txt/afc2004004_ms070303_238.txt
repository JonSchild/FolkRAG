with eyes hot brown & impersonally
loud? like a guinea pig. Mac laughing
a silly [?] laugh – speaking seriously
with immediate intensity when
the conversation took a serious
turn, going away in the intervals,
enjoying the gossip, concerned about
friends. His break of silly graying
hair – the poet's wig – like
woody –
     He lives in a two room cottage
on a small road, set in silken
green hills – hills like those
outside of Fort Worth – without
water, electricity, gas, – not
even with money for the beer that
he loves #
