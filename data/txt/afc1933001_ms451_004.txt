Negro Lullaby
I's a little Alabama coon
An' I hasn't been bawn ve'y long
I 'member seein' a big roun' moon
I 'member one sweet song;
When day packed me down to de cotton fiel'
Dar I rolled an' tummeled in de sun,
While my mammy picked de cotton
An' my pappy watched me grow
An' dis wuz de song she sung:
Hush a bye; Rock a bye: Go to sleep:
Ma little pick a ninny
Mammy gonna switch ya' if ya' don't.
Slumber on de bosom
Ob yore ole Mammy Jinny
Ole fox ketch ya, if ya don't.
Lu la lu, la lu, la lu, lu lu lu
Wander 'neath the silbery southern moon
Hush a bye, rock a bye, mammy's little baby
Mammy's little Alabama coon.
