You Can Defend America
Two newspaperwomen reported to this office August 12 on the 
You Can Defend America organization, a Buchmanite off-shoot:
"When the organization put on its show in Detroit about a month
ago, it didn't get a very good press, and when the show left town, several
women in the movement--one from Boston and one from New York--stayed behind
apparently to see what missionary work they could do among Detroit women
connected with the Newspaper Guild.
"The committee moved in uninvited on the homes of four women,
at least. One woman is an officer of the international auxiliary of the
Guild. The third and fourth women are active in the Detroit Free Press
and Detroit News units. None of the newspaperwomen is quite clear what
the purpose of the wooing was. The women's committee of the You Can
Defend America movement stayed around town two weeks after the show left,
visited unexpectedly at some of the newspaperwomen's houses for lunch and
long vague talks. The girls thought the committee was trying to use them
to work into labor groups."
Circular Letter
The secretary-treasurer of the Midwest Museums Conference of
the American Association of Museums turned over to this office August 10
a copy of a letter given her, she says, by a Detroit school teacher.
Mimeographs, she says, are being circulated in the Michigan area.
