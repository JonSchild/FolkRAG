Over Pennsylvania
En route, Gallup, N.M..

Dear Ben,
Thanks for your note. The work 
continues interesting and rewarding, although 
being away from home hurts. My regards
to H.H. What is he doing in the army?

Let me know how the new records
are coming along. And, if any other 
plans are coming along, I'll always 
like to hear.

About "Pappie." He's well worth 
going after. I don't know that 
I shall ever stop long enough to 
see him, but I believe you could 
work out a co-op recording project 
with Nick at OWI overseas. They
need that music for the Caribean.
Regards,
Alan.
