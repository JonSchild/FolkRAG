Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am happy to inform you that it is at last possible
for the Library to send you a portable recording machine
for your work in Alabama with Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt. As
I understand it, you are going to do some recording in
Texas on the way to Alabama, and thereupon instruct Mrs. Tartt
in the use of the machine and leave it with her for a
period of two months' work.
With cordial best wishes to both you and Mrs. Lomax,
I am

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke,
Chief of the Music Division
