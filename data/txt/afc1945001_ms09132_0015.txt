Senior N. F.

1. Tell me what is the Negro fighting for?

2. While you're remembering Pearl Harbor
why not think of Ethiopia?

3. Since England is the mother country
and Germany is the father country
why can't we have a peace on
earth

4. Here's to Hitler, the son of a bitch, I
hope his hands rot off with the
seven year itch. I hope the americans beat him with a 90 lb hammer
till he's unconcious and
whistles the Star Spangled Banner.

5. We as Americans shall never
inherit eternal peace until we
realize that regardless of race, creed
or color, democracy doesn't mean
that I'm as good as you, but rather
that you're as good as I.
