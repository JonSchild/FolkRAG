Fisk, 4. 5.  DAVID EDWARDS.

like that?

E:  I sure did.  When I got way, way from home, it's no wonder.  Sometimes I think I'll never get back home any more and I'd catch a freight to go to a place.  If I got to a county jail or to Katie, something like that, Illinois or something, just different railroads, when I got to a crossroad and walked, I was going way out of town to I may grab a (  ).  And then when you get to that crossroad.  There's just a little chance I may catch to Frisco or thing just like that, see?

A:  Did you meet up with any hobos?

E:  Yeah, quite often.

A:  I suppose any guy that rides the rails will sing?

E:  Yessir, and that's the reason they're riding, see?  He'll sing at home, they won't do nothing but try to pull him into work somewhere.  If he on the road, he'll find some way to try to make him some money, see.  And they get a artist, he's gonna get that money, understand, see.  They knows the way to get that money.  When you got a good firefighter, a good foxer or something like that, why, you got to run someplace where you gonna get a break.

A:  Did you ever hear nay songs that were sung by guys in the jungles that told about travelling on the road, hoboing, something like that?

E:  Sure, I've heard a few songs of something like that.  "I've been So Long I'm Gonna Take the Jungles To Be My Home."  After they get to singing that song, they get mournful.

I've been hoboing so long
I take the jungle to be my home.
Late at midnight the old train began to roll and rock
The next freight I"m gonna take to the town,
Maybe I'll stop.

That's the jungle song in the jungle.  I've hears they left the jungle sometime, got into town and grabbed a roustabout and put him in jail.  -- Left the jungle and go to the market, begged the market
