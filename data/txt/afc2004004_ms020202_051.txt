the voice of mabel hillary rings strong with the woman's blues
[she tells me that no man, no land, no word will put her down]
[*2 (*]   
she sings of red clay, dusty georgia and the men that work [that] the land
her rich anecdotes weave unforgettably throughout her whole performance
[*?*]    
she is part of americas richest and strongest [singing] folk tradition
[mabel has brought]
mabel has sung eith the georgia sea islanders for many years and

when the integration movement started to touch her people in georgia

friendly and the word was said and no one could resist it.
mabel's experiences in the folk field are tremendously varied]
[the old blues style]
[womans blues was just about forgottebmbmb]
[*3*]   
its been a long time since a good womans blues [hear] was heard. the old
