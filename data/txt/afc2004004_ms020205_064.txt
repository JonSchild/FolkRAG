to church." 
That man, the gambler, was teaching the children.  Hm, Hm!  We find
lots of things that would surprise us, going out like that/, you know way out
in the wilderness sometimes. 
A:  People sort of (brutalize?) about their experiences.  They just
don't care anymore.
R:  They just don't care.  Well, they don't have no one to preach the
Gospel to them.  They don't see anythi ng but something wrong, therefore,
they forget about . . .  That's why  they did need the
preacher then.
Now, then, I continued, you know, going and preaching.  The Baptist
denomination, they just kinda took awhole to me because of my face, I
guess, and they made me a Sunday schol missionary.  Why then, I
travelled around and go acquainted.  So pretty soon, a c[*h*]urch, a little
church, it probably had six members . . .  Well, I take them to church, 
and I was all day there.  And I run a little while there, and I
taken about eighteen  people, and I had a minister to baptize them
for me, to by my pastor, and then I made me some deacons and got
going.  And I'll tell you about that --  I belonged to the Bethlehem 
Baptist Church at that time, and they refused to recognize the
call  and ordain me.  And I had a dream, and in that dream I
went down to a kind of a walking-place, and there was a stream of
water.  And I walked around that stream, and sometimes there would
be nice clear holes of water and then right there, they'd run over,
you know, and there'd be a little stream with muddy roo6s and things 
running in it.  And I8d find another clear hole and it would go
like that, and I looked up along the  banks- it was high banks- 
and I8d see  , see the trees growing.  I went up and got one of those
seeds, and I carried it down in the southpart of town, and I set it
out where there wasn't any trees, and it grew and flourished.
