(MAKE MYSELF INVISIBLE) an' come in here today, I could take [every]anything
you had.  You see?  That's the kind of a thing that they
wanted to do.  They wan'ed to go -- not on'y take -- I could jus' . . . 
They wouldn't want nothin' but money, ya know.  But I wouldn', ah,
ah . . .An' they you wouldn' see me.  Ya see what I mean?  That's
what I'm talkin' about.  Disguise theyself.
     This-That's what they all, just say . . .Dis doctor man told me
that he don't believe that nobody wanted to be a witch.  But in
doin' this thing, they didn't know how ta do it an' -- some of
'em -- an' they, an' what they git, they got to keep what they
had.  An' that what they had would turn out to be a hag or a 
witch or sumpthin', you see.  An' still, that -- Yet, they
done sold theyself out, ya see?
     An' yet cain't do nothin' but ride hosses an' ride peoples,
ya know.  Like you sleepin' at night, they can ride ya.  Ya cain't
rest; look like sumpin' jus' on ya, jus' . . .An' you jus' look like
you gonna die, every minute.  "Uuuh. . ."  You jus' goin' on, you,
you know, in in your sleep.
     Very seldom ya hear talk of 'em now.  Very seldom.
     But anyway, that's what it was, then.  Your hoss would be
rid so -- Folks'd just ride people's mules an' hosses so 'till
they couldn' hardly work the next day.  They jus' ride 'em; make
'em run all night.  Jus' ride 'em.  Said the manes'd jus' be all
tangled up.
