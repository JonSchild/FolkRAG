WHIRLWINDS OF DANGER

(Red Song Book - Workers Library, New York City)

Whirlwinds of danger are raging around us;
O8er whelming forces of darkness assail.
Still in the fight see advancing before us,
Red flag of liberty that yet shall prevail.

Chorus: Then forward, ye workers
Freedom awaits you,
O'er all the world on the land and on sea
On with the fight for the cause of humanity.
March, march, ye toilers and the world shall
be free.

Women and children in hunger are calling
Shall we be silent to their sorrow and woe?
While in the fight see our brothers are falling
Up the united and conquer the foe.

Chorus: Then forward, ye workers,
Freedom awaits you,
O'er all the world on the land and on sea,
On with the fight for the cause of humanity
March, march, ye toilers and the world shall
be free.


AIN'T GOIN' STUDY WAR NO MORE
(Negro)

(Page 32 - Folks Songs of Many Peoples, Vol. II.)

I'm goin' lay down my sword an' shield,
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside;
I'm goin' lay down my sword an' shield,
Down by the riverside.
Ain't goin' to study war no more.

I'm goin' put on my long white rob. (etc.)

I'm goin' put on my starry crown. (etc.)

I'm goin' put on my golden shoes. (etc.)

I'm goin' talk with the Prince of Peace. (etc.)
