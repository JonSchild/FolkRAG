THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
MEMORANDUM

Date: November 19, 1946
To: Dr. Spivacke
From: Rae Korson
With reference to: Alan Lomax Recording Project

My comments on Alan's letter of November 11, requested
by you, follow:

1.  To give Alan an option of renewal on one of our recording
machines after six months would be unfair to the many collectors and
universities who have requested the loan of our equipment.

2.  A project of 300 records would amount to approximately
$1400, an amount which would exceed the balance of our current allotment
by $465.

To guarantee the making of duplicates by the Recording
Laboratory within three weeks would mean giving Alan priority over the
poetry albums, our folk song albums, and the large amount of work being
brought from the field by Dr. Emrich.

3.  We have no Presto machines available at the present time
and will not have until Dr. Emrich returns on December 21.  Dr. Emrich
has a Presto K which will not take a 16-inch disc.  We have no Presto
Y machines.

4.  Dr. Emrich does not approve of restricting recorded materials
for too long a period of time for obvious reasons.

5.  As the machine is the property of the Library of Congress
we ought to reserve the right to loan it to those entitled to it.  It
may well be that Dr. Jacobson can make a valuable contribution in her
special field but if we decide to let her have a machine, we ought to
make a separate project for her.

6.  As you know, the Folklore Section has no funds for field
expenses.

Respectfully submitted,
Ray Korson
