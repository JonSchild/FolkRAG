A               War Rumors
          In all wars there are usually some
people who start rumors, and spread
them around , each one adding to or
changing the story. When you hear
someone telling another person
something about Military movements,
don't go home and tell it to everyone
you meet, but keep it to yourself.
If you tell everyone everything you
heard you are aiding the enemy,
which we do not want. The people
who usually start these rumors are
enemy agents, doing all they can
to discourage us, and bring down our
morale. This is one thing we must
not let happen.
