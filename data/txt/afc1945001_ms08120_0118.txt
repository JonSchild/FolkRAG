A War Episode   

Recently I read an article in the
Chicago Tribune about three men drifting
in a raft for eighty three days. Their ship
was attacked by submarine and six men
started out on the raft. Their only means
of securing food was catching fish and birds,
because their canned food soon gave out.
They caught a shark by putting a rope in
the water and when the shark swims through,
the rope is tightened and he is caught. When
the birds get tired of flying the would light
on the raft and were caught by the men.
After about sixty six days three of the men
died of thirst because it had not rained for
a long time. Soon as the men died a rain
storm occured and the last three men
recieved drinking water. Within a couple
of weeks the men were rescued by an
American ship.
