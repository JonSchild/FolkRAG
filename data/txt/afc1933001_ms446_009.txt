A Call to Student America

As the chaos of World War II engulfs nation after
nation, youth can bewail its fate, claim itself the
victim of forces beyond its control, and decline the 
responsibility for a rational solution. Or, youth, asserting
qualities of vision and intelligence, can face the future with
courage determined to make our democracy more effective.
Democracy in that case must cease to be an abstraction
to which one pays lip-service on national holidays. It must
become a concept which informs our every action--at
home, at work, at play, in choosing our occupation, and in
accepting willingly the rights and obligations of citizenship.

It is with this in mind that International Student 
Service follows up its September conference on "Students and
the Future of Democracy" with a conference on "How
Youth Can Serve Democracy", December 27 to 29, 1940
at New Jersey College for Women in New Brunswick,
New Jersey. This conference will discuss the future of
the present generation in terms of vocation and citizenship,
in terms of our philosophy for democracy and our 
contribution as a generation to the heritage that is ours.

As at its conference in September, I.S.S. will bring
together student leaders from different campuses, diverse
organizations and with varying points of view. Those who
were present at the September meetings will testify to the
vitality of the discussions. I.S.S. will follow its tradition
of impartiality in conference arrangements.

In addition to the I.S.S. conference New Jersey 
College for Women will be hostess to the annual Congress of
the National Student Federation of America. The two
meetings are being held concurrently with N.S.F.A. dele-
gates participating in I.S.S. plenary sessions. The eyes of
student America will turn for leadership toward the
N.J.C. campus during the Christmas holidays.
