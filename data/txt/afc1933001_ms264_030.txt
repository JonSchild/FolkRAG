(same tune as Thing's about Coming' My Way)

Come on In My Kitchen, Robert Johnson,
Robert Johnson,  Perfect 7-07-57(SA 2585)

Um----,

Chorus
You better come on in my kitchen,
It's gonna be rainin' out do's.

When a woman get in trouble,
Ev'body throws her dow,
Lookin' for yo' good friend,
An' can't be found,

Chorus

The woman I love,
Took for my best friend,
Some jumper got lucky,
Stole her back again,

Chorus.

Man, can't you hear that wind howlin'?
Oh, how the wind do howl.

Chorus.

The woman that I love,
I crave to see,
She's up the country
Won't write to me.
But she'd better, etc..

I went to de mountain,
Fur as my eyes could see.
Some other man got my woman,
Lonesome blues got me,
But she'd better, etc..

My mama dead,
Papa way up the sea,
Ain't got nobody
To love an' care for me.
