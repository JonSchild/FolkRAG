Dear Helen Whitaker:

Many thanks for the song that you sent me a coupe of
weeks ago.  I have not written to thank you before because
I've been too busy not because i did not enjoy the song.  I
feel sure you know other songs besides the children's games
and play parties.  If you would send me those words too, I 
should like to put them in the collection of the Library of 
Congress at Washington, D. D., in your name.  One thing I'd 
like to know is where you played the games, how they were
played and how long ago this happened.

Thanking you again,
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
