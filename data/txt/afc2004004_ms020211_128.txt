Dear Ms. Forte:
I would like to counter your suggestions about a children's
concert for Mrs. Bessie Jones in the following way.  I would
like the group to all work together and be paid together because
it is difficult to hold any musical group together
when there is internal rivalary; therefore, the suggested
fee for the children's concert should become part of the
overall fee.  I suggest that the whole group appear at the
children's concert for an additional fee of $150.  They would
perform children's games and dances and teach the children
how to play these games.  If Mrs. Jones alone appears, the
fee should be $100, but this fee should be a part of the
overall contract that will include the main concert fee of
$500, the workshop for the total of the donations of $1 collected
at the door, their round-trip bus fare, their accomodations
and maintenance in Minneapolis for a period of two
days and nights.
Checks should be made out to each of the following five
people:  Bessie Jones, Henry Morrison, John Davis, Emma
Ramsay and Mabel Hillery.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
