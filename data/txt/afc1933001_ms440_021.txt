"I never did get in no trouble in Dallas an' I lived there
eighteen years, in Dallas an' Fort Worth-' Cept one time, 
Some ol' whores tried to do me sumpin'. I'se in there wid 'em
talkin' an' had my buddy wid me, Bob Timmons,
they ask me for some money, an' I say, Naw, I woldn' give two
When I started to leave, I walked down a long hall.
Some o' them whores come outa one door on this side that made 'em mad, look like an' some outa nother 
do' on that. An' they had brick-bats an' ol' broken pieces
o' chamber an' one ol' whore had a axe an' she was comin' down wid it on
de head of a barrel-jus' achin' to cut my head off. They say,
"Where you from anyway, comin' in here an' talkin' like
that. You jus' thinks you the president."
I had my han's up in de air an' I was thinkin' about mama an'
papa an' my happy home an' I beg 'em, say, Please, let me off
this time. I wasn' aimin' to make you mad. I'm a stranger here
an' don' mean no harm. Please let me off.
Dat ol' who' had de axe kep' comin' down on de barrel-head,
Sho' boy we goin' let you off.' Lookin' like she want to
put dat thing in me.
My buddy was standin' out de do' an wasn' sayin' a thing, who's had me hemmed in an'
I thought dat- was de las'. Den de
ol' landlady come out an' tell 'em. Don' bodder me man, He ignorant.
He don' know no better. Let him go long. Dey move back a little
an I lef' outa dere. Ain' been back dere since, neither, ain' never
saw those ol' whores no mo'. An' I know 'xac'ly where dat whore
house is, right down by de ol' Union depot in Dallas, Texas."
