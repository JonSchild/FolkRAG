Dear Alan:

1. As I wrote to you by air
mail yesterday, I don't think
I can get any time in Dallas except
when I am armed with an
explicit order from some high-up
authority in the Priorities Division in
Washington.

2. I think the idea of the history
of American Folk Music is excellent
a. The book will be unique.
b. It will at once become a
standard source book in the field,
not to be supplanted in many years,
if ever.
c. The advance payment shows
the faith of the publishers.
d. You can quote from me 
(us) freely without charge from me,
remembering that adequate and specific
reference should, for historical reasons, be given
