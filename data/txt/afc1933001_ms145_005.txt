Dear Alan:
I was sorry I couldn't see you on my last trip, and
there hasn't been one since, but I expect to be up in a week
or so.  Meanwhile, the enclosed letter to Ivan Black of the
Federal Theatre Project Radio Division will, I hope, enlist
your cooperation.  What do you think about taking part in the
craft session of the  Third National Writers' Congress on American
Folk Literature and what ideas do you have?  I enclose
an outline and should like to have your prompt reactions.
Nick will probably discuss the folk theatre.

With best wishes to you and Elizabeth,

Faithfully,
Ben
B. A. Botkin
