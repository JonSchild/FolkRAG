Reel 46(no. 2045):

Bill Gordon:
     The boss man --he'd come out and he'd give all
of us what to do.  An he'd go on back to camp.  But, whatever
he said done, that little ol' foreman out there --spotter,
were spotter then, weren't no foreman -- he would be the boss
out there.  And he'd carry the work on.  And it be so cold out
there --he wouldn't let you go to the fire-- you'd have to
let your lines slip through your hands. . .
A.L.:
     I don't understand.  Tell me how that was,
exactly.
B.G.:
     Like, your wheeler'd be goin on, you'd have
two mules to it.
A.L.:
     Yeah?
B.G.:
     And the mule'd be goin along and you'd walk
along an git up to the fire. .
A.L.:
     What was the fire doin there?
B.G.:
     The fire?  They had a fire built, for you to
warm goin by.  You couldn't stop at it, your wheeler couldn't
stop, but you could let the mules keep a-goin and let the
lines slide through your hands till it get to the end, then
you got to catch em.  You could never just stop at the fire
and warm.
A.L.:
     What would they do to you?
B.G.:  Would cut your head!  Beat it with a pistol or
stick or sumpin'.  If you stop. . .
W.B.:  
     And. . ah, alot a times his lines would be
covered with frost --look like it got snow on em.  And them
gloves, when the lines slipped through his hands, his gloves
would be full of frost
-just like snow.
B.G.:
     Yeah, you couldn't stop at the fire and just
warm.
