Knoxville, Tennessee.

Oct. 6. "It seems strange that no rumors are mentioned about Blackberry
Farm in the local news. I have a cousin in the East. She spoke 
of this news as being on the front page in her local paper. She
spoke of the Farm as being connected with the Nazis and about the
FBI investigation last summer and some suspects being taken to
Washington. I understand the farm has not been operated for
busines recently. My sister went to Wisconsin this summer, while
there the hostess told her of two very quiet women who were there
a while from the Blackberry Farm. Quite suddenly they left ahead
of their schedule, with no explanation -- before their paid up time
had expired."
