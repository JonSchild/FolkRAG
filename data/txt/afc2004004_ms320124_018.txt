LOMAX  Well no, I mean just tell us some
of the main points that you think are concerned, that were
grown there.
ANCELET  Well, [CLEARS THROAT] what I,
what I think is a, really the identifying feature of Cajun
music is, is this blending that occurred here in Louisiana
and, and didn't occur anywhere else in the world because the
mix, the music, this particular mixture of cultures didn't
happen anywhere else in the world.
LOMAX  Blending of what?
ANCELET  Yeah.  You had, they, on a 
western, essentially a western French base you had added to
it the Spanish, the Scotch Irish, the Anglo-Americans, the
Indians, the Germans, the blacks, all cooking together in a 
sort of cultural stew here in Louisiana.  And this is the
only place where those particular groups all got together
and, and blended.
LOMAX  But the dominant thing was France
and Africa and probably American Indians, I mean, no?
ANCELET  American Indians maybe before,
primarily before they came to Louisiana.  The, they had
very, very much contact with the [Micmacs] and the. . .
LOMAX  Right, right.
ANCELET  [UNCLEAR].  And, and then I really
feel like the, the feature that, that sets Cajun music off
