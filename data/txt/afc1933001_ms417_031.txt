Things About Comin' My Way (Hill)
Tampa Red, Vocalion 1637

Los' all my money, ain't got a dime,
Givin' up this whole world, leavin' it behind,

Chorus
But after all all my hard travelin',
Things is 'bout comin' my way.

When I was sick, down on my bed,
My friends forgot me, thought I was dead,

(Chorus.)

Boys, ain't it hard, when you ain't got a frien',
Just keep on travelin', they'll need yo' help agin.

I'm always pleased, I'm never mad,
thinkin' 'bout the bad luck I once have had.

Now take me, baby, just as I am,
Ain't got no money, I'm in a jam,

(Chorus.)

She told my neighbors and all my friends,
That I was a mistreater, she didn't want me back agin.

(Chorus.)
