WHAT to DO?

Dear Mr. Lomax

One of our authors, Miss Odille Ousley, has compiled an
anthology of poetry for young children which is to be entitled
V Is for Verses. Miss Ousley would like to include in her
anthology the fifth and seventh verses of the long poem "A
Cowboy's Life" from Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads
compiled by John A. Lomax.

We have already secured permission from the Ludlow Music 
Company for the use of this material in the United States and 
Canada. As we are asking for world coverage for the other 
poems in this anthology, we should like to clear the lines from 
"A Cowboy's Life" for the rest of the world also.

If it is possible for you to grant us the additional coverage 
for this poem, please tell us what fee you will require for its 
use. We plan to include a credit line among our acknowledgments
indicating that the poem is from the book compiled by your father, 
John A. Lomax.

Sincerely yours,
Esma G Hackett
