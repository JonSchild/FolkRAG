Watch dem healin' waters spring!

A fragment of the story of Dives and Lazarus is another good
example of chorus singing:

Wore his purple and linen, too;
Ring dat big bell -
Don't keer what sorta rags for you!
Ring dat big bell -
Dine sumptious ev'y day,
Ring dat big bell -
Tell Lazus go away.

Chorus.

Ringa dat big bell,
Dat bigges' big one!
Tell-a me what he done done
Way down in hell!

Lazus lay outside,
Ring-a dat big bell -
Dogs lick his so' hide,
Ring-a dat big bell -
But when he bof die,
Ring-a dat big bell -
Lazus he even-up High.
(Chorus)

Rich man, I hear folks tell,
Ring-a dat big bell -
Dropped into lownes' hell,
Ring-a dat big bell -
Laz'us lay close and fas',
