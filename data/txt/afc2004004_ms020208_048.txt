Reverend Roe.  Reel 14.  P. 3

had nothing to support her, and I just went on, and I finally forgot about her.

A:  Well, in those days in the country, didn't the young man and the women have their pleasure together?

R:  Oh yes, oh yes, we went together, you know.  Of course, we were busy until we didn't have time like the young folks do now because I worked every day.  We'd only see each other Saturday evening and on Sunday.
A:  In those days it wasn't considered so wrong if you slept with a 
girl, was it?  Out in those country districts?
R:  Oh, man, there was a place down there you'd go, but, oh, out there
in our settlement, if a girl was caught with a man, she never was
counted no more.  No, she was out of society.  Why, those old folks -
if you was caught with a man, and it was known, she couldn't go with
none of those best girls no more.  Them mothers wouldn't have that;
they was strict about that, yessir.  And if we was seen with one of
them girls, why (                                                    ?), why, we'd
have to slip down there at night.  Yeah.  We had avgrop of em, though,
was just like that, you know, you'd go down there and sleep with em
and everything.
A:  They weren't professionals; they were just a different class.
R:  Yeah, we just had classes.  Just like the white folks, you know,
classes.  They'd just do most any way cause there's folks there.  And
dont think that you were gonna spoil a girl and getz away with it,
I mean one of themgood girls; you wouldn't do that, no sir.  Why,
if you wass pretty good kind of a boy and everything all right, when
they found it out, you'd just go marry the girl.
A:  But they saw to it that you married her.
R:  Oh, man, yeah.  You had to marry that girl or die.  They'd kill
you, that's all. Just had to do it.
