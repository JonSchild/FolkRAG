Dear Mr. Allen:

It has been impossible for me to reply to your letter sooner.
I have been busy for the last six weeks with a new Lomax ballad
book and all official business has been let slip.

Doctor Spivacke and I have both been at work on plans for a 
folklore archive. We feel that in a month or so there will be
definite news for you. In the meantime, I deeply appreciate your
consideration of me and your concern about the Archive. Doctor
Thompson's interest will certainly be invaluable in bringing this
project to its realization.

Perhaps you will be interested to learn that The Columbia
Broadcasting System has put me in charge of their music program of
the American School of the Air for next year. The program is, as
you know, aimed at stimulating interest of children in basic
subjects of the school curriculum and my part of the series will
consist of very simple and straightened presentations of
American folk music and folklore. I hope you will be able to
listen in and give me the benefit of your expert criticism and
experience.

Please give my very best regards to Doctor and Mrs. Thompson.
Again thanking you both for your continued interest in the Archive
and myself, I am

Very sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of American Folksong
