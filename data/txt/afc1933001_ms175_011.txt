In process of filling a record order for the University 
of Texas for 150 of our best Texas records, Mr. Wiesner is making 
copies of some of our dangerously worn, and at the same time some 
of our finest, originals. Some of these records will, I believe, 
be constantly in demand for dubbing purposes, and in order to 
protect them I wish strongly to urge that master dubs be made
at the same time as the dubs for Texas are made. This would 
entail possibly 
making fifty dubs at an approximate cost of 
$75.00 I think no more valuable investment could be made, 
since these records will be constantly in service as orders 
come in. 

Respectfully yours,
