1. You know, a funny thing happened to me
last week. We were out on the drill field
the other day and all lined up to march. I have,
by the way, a real tough old Irish drill
sergeant. I was the lead man on the
the right, and the sergeant yelled "forward
march!" Well, I thought he said, "To the 
right march!" So I stepped smartly out
to the right, head up, the way we are
supposed to, and started to march. I had
gone about eight paces and I heard that 
old sergeant beller, "Where the hell d'ya
think you're going, Buddy!" I turned 
around and there I was out in the field
by myself, with practically the whole
army marching by. Fine thing!

2. Have you ever seen a moon that reminded 
you of a Don Ameche-Alice Faye movie?
Well, what I'm getting at is, you'd should
see this Oklahoma moon! The weather
is just like spring in Ohio with a great
big golden moon, all surrounded by
hazy glowing clouds. What a spot for 
romance! 60,000 soldiers and no
women! PHOOEY!!
