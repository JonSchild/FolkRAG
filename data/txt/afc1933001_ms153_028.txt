Dear Mrs. Robertson: 
In the course of a short talk late yesterday afternoon, a
question arose concerning the analyzation of magazines, journals, 
and various periodicals. We would like ot know as soon as possible 
whether you are engaged in any way upon work of this
nature and if so what the periodical is that you are analyzing 
Do you know or are you working upon any analyzation of The 
Journal of American Folklore? If you are, we should appreciate 
any particulars and details that you can forward- the nature 
of the work, its extent, how complete the project is and how 
thoroughly the job is being done. And of course the same question
applies to any other magazine which is being similarly treated. 

Thanking you in advance for your reply and sending you best 
wishes from the Music Division, I am 
Sincerely yours, 
Edward N. Waters
