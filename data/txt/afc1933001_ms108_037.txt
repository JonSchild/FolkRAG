Dearest Alan and Elizabeth,

We're in Budapest now. If you'll look on a map 
you'll see how very far away we are; we've been 
going nearly straight East from Paris for a long time.
In a week or so we're going back to Vienna and up 
to Prague. There Deanie and Father are going north 
to Amsterdam to meet Johnny, and Elizabeth and I 
are going into southern Germany - Nuremberg, 
Stuttgart and finally across the border into France 
at Strasbourg. Then up towards Paris, stopping at 
Reims maybe and Nancy. We'll stay in Paris a 
week or two and then to London. We ought to be in 
London about the end of July, and will meet Father 
& Deanie & Johnny there. Elizabeth is going home 
from England; Father and Deanie and I will go South 
to sail for Texas from Italy probably. I'll stay a 
week or two at Shirleys and come north about 
September I guess. I already feel as though I'm on the 
way home.

Wishful thinking, I guess. I'm torn between wanting 
to stay here and wanting desperately to have something 
to do. Alan's letter made me itch to get back to work,
and I heard from Emily Jo yesterday saying that Marigold 
had been offered the job of director of the WPA
Anthropology division at San Antonio. Emily Jo is 
starting a store in Austin - imports - has been offered
