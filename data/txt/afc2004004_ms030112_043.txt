GARY:
Heres another thing about a Negro, I don't mean no harm
by saying, First thing the fool gonna do when
he get some money gonna buy a fish tail cadillac.
Did you hear what I say? Did you hear what I said Mister.
LIONEL: 
I heard you, right.
GARY:
Gonna buy him a fish tail cadillac. Man in New YOrk one
time get $3,000 and a friend got out and cried like a baby,
he says Listen you could get a house putting $1,000 down. Oh
god-dam a house, I dont want a house. I'm gonna get me a
fish tail cadillac. That fool went and bought that cadillac,
and tore it to pieces that night, tore hisself all to pieces.
Hear what I'm talking about? You just can't do what you want
to do because you got the money in your hand, you understand.
You come to be sorry.
LARRY:
Rev. Davis, when you first left the South, The very first

I stopped long enough to see some friends there. In fact
I didn't have no where to stop at.
