Our book of two hundred songs, chosen out of a stock
of 10,000 folk songs on records in the Music Division of
the Library of Congress, is the product of nine years'
collecting, two years of dogged labor by Ruth Seeger, music
editor in transcribing the tunes just the way they were
sung, but, most of all, I believe, it represents the American
people and tells their story the way they would have it
told. As the Negro says, "If you don't sing you so' git
worried."

Transcribed and reviewed by contributors participating in the By The People project at crowd.loc.gov.
