-------------------------------------------------------------
Poor Martha and her sister, they wept aloud and cried,
But still he grew no better; he lingered on and died.

The Jews came to the sisters, laid Lazarus in the tomb,
And tried for to comfort, and drive away their gloom.
When Jesus heard the tidings, far in a distant land,
So swiftly did he travel to see that lonely band.

And  while He was a-coming, Martha met Him on the way,
And told Him that her brother had died and passed away.
He bless'd and He cheered her, and told her not to weep,
For in Him was the power to raise him from his sleep.

Yet while He was a-coming, Mary met Him, lonely too-
Down at His feet a-weeping, rehearsed the tale of woe!
When Jesus saw her weeping, He fell a-weeping too,
And wept until they showed Him where Lazarus was entombed.

He rolled away the cover, and look'd upon the grave,
And prayed unto His Father, His loving friend to save.
And Lazarus, in full power, came from the gloomy mound,
And in full life and vigor he walked upon the ground.

So all you who love Jesus, and do His holy will,
