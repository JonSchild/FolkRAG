learned them from an old fiddler who had played 
them for years on Powder River at the dances.
For that reason I judge them a valuable contribution
of authentic material.
      I have used this cowboy material, songs and 
dances, since I came from Wyoming to teach in the 
Chicago Schools. We have usually worked out a
dramatic background. One of theses short playlets
has been published by the Silver Burdett Company
in their Bronze Book of folk song material of the 
various nationalities including our own America.
The children especially the boys have literally
"eaten it up".
     With appreciation of your work and hoping
I may have the opportunity of a personal conference 
in Milwaukee, I am,

Yours very truly,
