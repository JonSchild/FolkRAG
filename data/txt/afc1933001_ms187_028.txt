Dear Alan:

I just received from Posnansky a copy of his letter of Oct. 1st
to you, in reply to yours to him of Sept. 23. I am very grateful to you for
contacting him so promptly, & I believe this contact will prove of mutual
value. You will see by his letter the value of this project, also that he is a
man who grasps necessary details quickly & vigorously & gets things done. He is
erecting a Tiahuanaco monument there in La Paz & by the way he talked to the Indian
laborers on that job, I perceived he knew how to handle them, - also in conformity
to my wish that a Bolivian folklore society be formed, by the way he formed one right
while I was there, under my eyes. I saw he can handle his colleagues, too, & spur them
into action. He can probably get a truck & helpers for this expedition from the
Bolivian government. Anyhow, he always seemed to have plenty of flunkies around.
I believe his family operated a large brick factory or construction co. there in La Paz.
I believe you do not need to hesitate about using governmental connections
on this end, because his on that end seem to be good.  I do hope it
works out successfully.

Yours,

RSB.
