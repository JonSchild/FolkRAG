August 8, 1974
Dear John Lomax:
It gives me great pleasure to be able to congratulate you on the occasion of your 80th birthday. More than anyone else, perhaps, I am aware of the extent of your contribution to the field of American folk songs and folklore. I sit in the shadow of your collection, hear your field recordings daily, am in touch with the many collectors whose work is a direct outgrowth of that begun by you when you were a student at Harvard. While you are physically in Texas, there is enough of your spirit here in the Library of Congress almost to accuse you of leading a double existence. That is as it should be, and I can assure you that the people of the United States are grateful that it is so.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
