TAPE 21. . .HAMISH HENDERSON. APRIL 1951. 

The first song is the old song of the Army of the Covenanters 
- General Leslie- marching into England. 

1) March, march Eichlin and Tegerdale, 
Why the de'il dinna ye march forward in order ? 
March, march, Espin and Liddesdale, 
All the blue bonnets are over the border. 

2) When to the kirk we come we'll pouch at ilka row, 
More popish lyrics and all innovations, 
That al the world may see nane's in the richt but we, 
Nane's in the richt but the old Scottish nation. 
- - -- - - - ---- 

A royalist satire on the Covenanters' march. . . 

1) March, march, scourge is a heresy, 
Down with the kirk and its w[ea?][il?]y beleary (?) 
March, march, doon wi' supremacy, 
And the kist for a whistle said Maxie McCleary. 
Chorus: 
2 Fife men and pipers, braw merry de'ils tak' them all, 
Goon lace and livery, lickpot and ladle, 
Jockie shall wear the boot, Jeannie the sac o' gold, 
For codpiece and petticoat, dish cloth and dadle. 

2) March, march, breaks of all wickedness 
Glory, glory, canna we debase it ? 
March, march, dung hills and blessedness, 
March and rejoice, for you shall be raised.

This song is the song of the battle of Sheriffmuir - the 
indecisive battle between the forces of the Earl of Marlow and 
the Hanoverian forces, and the Earl of Argyll, in 1715. 

1) There's some say that we won and some say that they run 
And some say that nane won at all, man, 
But one thing I'm sure that at Sheriffmuir, 
The battle it was that I saw, man. 
Chorus: 
And we run and they run and they run and we won, 
And we run and they run awa' man. 

2) Strathmore and Clan Ronald, cried still adavnace, Donald, 
Till baith of these heroes did fall, man, 
For there was sich hashing, and broadswords a-clashing, 
Brave fought for himself wi'a claw, man.
