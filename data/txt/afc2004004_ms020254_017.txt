BJ TAPE 40, p. 15

     So, the boy, he, he looked at the man an' he laughed.  He
says, ah, "I may be green an' young an' foolish," he says, "But
you cain't make me believe that your wife's in that lil' box."
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Hah!
     That was really true, hah!  But, ya know, but that's the
way I would have been if I . . .!  Huh, huh!  looked at that thing
after I talked to Miss Daisy, looked all at it to see
how, how it could be that, ah, she talked to me 'way over there.
So I thunk about that boy. Said, "I may be green but I cain't
believe your wife's in that lil' box."  Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[* (WHAT THEY DO)     WITCHES & WIZARDS *]

TL:  About witches now?
BJ:  Yeah.
TL:  They used to. . .?
BJ:  They claimed, they said they come out their skin, but the peoples
didn't.  It's jus' some kin's way that they had of doin', of
disguisin' theirself [to] an' be witches, you know.  You know . . . ?
TL:  Regular people?
BJ:  Yeah, reg'lar, real, people.  They had the nerve to do it in
those days.  But they ain't got the nerve now, ya know, 'cause
everybody's too scared to do them kind [a] of wicked things.
     Ah, in other words, they would be witches, but they didn't
want to be witches, so I learnt from a real doctor man.  Said
they, nobody [that] ever did this trick want to be a witch.  Th-they 
wanted to be wise or sumpin' to do anything they wanna do.  See?
'Cause, ya see, they's all -- not only the colored, the white,
too, th-those that did it -- ah, they didn't wanna, ah, they wanted
more;  they wanted something an' wanted something to git something
with.  You know, jus' say, if I could disguise myself
