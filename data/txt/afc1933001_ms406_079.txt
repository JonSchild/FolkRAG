book immediately attracted some attention in the cultural centers of the East, in England, and in France. At home and throughout the Southwest I was only laughed at because of my attempts to preserve [something that was not worth saving] this crude literary product of the West. One candidate for governor of Texas attacked the University of Texas in speeches throughout the state for keeping on its rolls a man who was so silly as to sponsor a book as valueless as a collection of cowboy songs. 
Some years ago the Macmillan Company secured the publishing rights on Cowboy Songs. The book has had a steady though small sale for twenty-five years. It happened to be the first [attempted] collection of native American folk songs, except perhaps some local pamphlets, and the first edition has therefore acquired [some] value for collectors. in 1919 I published a second collection entitled Songs of the Cow Camp and Cattle Trail. In addition to being fond of singing songs about their lives the cowboy also found pleasure in memorizing and reciting rough verses describing the adventurous side of the cattle business. Sometimes such songs were set to a simple tune. I was able to find authors for about half of the examples printed in [words] the Songs of the Cattle Trail. 
The advertisement given my project by Harvard University brought to me a large batch of miscellaneous material. Not until 1934 did I have time to go through it [and select the best material] and find the best of it together. During that year Macmillans  published for me a book, American Ballads and Folk Songs, in which I have included what seems to me to be the best of the material produced in the United States. A lot of it of course has echoes of European origins. Some few of [the] such songs [in this book]
