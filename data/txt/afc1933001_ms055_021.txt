Dear Mr. Greene:

    In Dr. Spivacke's absence, please let me express our
pleasure at the service you were able to derive from our
folk song recordings. As regards your new request, I see
no reason why we should not accede to it. In granting this,
however, I think you had better send us a statement, in Dr.
Spivacke's words, "to the effect that they [the records]
will not be used for any commercial purposes." And, of
course, we shall appreciate proper acknowledgments.

    From past contacts with the Music Division you must
understand why our materials can not be used commercially
in any way. Assuming that you will fulfill this condition,
I hope the new series of broadcasts will be successful.

    Sincerely yours,
    Edward N. Waters
    Acting-Chief,
    Division of Music
