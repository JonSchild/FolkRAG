[*MOUTHBOW*]  
A   Um . . .[one of the reasonss I went to see the
Eller Brothers, ah, down in the um Georgia
mountains, in the area where the Indians had
their last big reservation was that ah,
Lawrence Eller played the - [MUTTERS] - 
that one of them played, one of the Eller
Brothers played the mouth bow. Now it may be
that the mouth bow, which is ah in the shape 
of a normal shooting bow with a string across
it that you hold in front of your mouth, and
for the resonating chamber, is - it may be
the oldest of human instruments. There, there
are pictures of it on the, on the caves of
the prehistoric man in Europe. It's known in 
every continent of the world, and ah, it was 
very much played by the Cherokees. Ah, I
believe that the mountaineers got it from
their Cherokee predecessors, along with many
other things.]

The, the ah, the first time I ever saw it was
in um Arkansas, ah, also near a place where
Indians had once um - ha - had recently lived.
Um, the mouth bow ah...is capable of - it's
a monochord and you can just play a limited
kind of ah, ah, pick out a limited kind of 
tune on it, butit was immensely popular.
