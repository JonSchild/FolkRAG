Dear Alan:

As you suggested about
the Burl Ives matter, I wrote
a "nice" letter to the Columbia
people. They replied in kind, requesting
me to send them the
piano scores of the songs in question,
the dates of copyrights, etc., etc.
Inasmuch as you must have given
Burl Ives the tunes of the songs,
soon (if ever) to be printed in
Our Singing Country, we are not
in a very good position
to sue. Under all the circumstances,
in fairness to me and
to Mrs. Seeger, I think you
ought to take up this matter
