Mrs. Seeger, and hew to it just 
as faithfully and promptly as
if you were keeping a radio
engagement.  I should like to
hear from you on the points
I have made.

   a.  Send your letters - if any -
to this address, 7456 San Benito Way.
   b.  Whenever possible look
over my mail and forward
only such items as you know
I'd like to see.

   Miss Terrill and I spent the
week end in Austin and yesterday
(Monday) trailed a truck bringing
her stuff from Austin.  Soon
after we got in Shirley phoned
from Mineola where she and
Chris and Susan were with Miss
Monsall.  They came by when
the house was locked and deserted.
