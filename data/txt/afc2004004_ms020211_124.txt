Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am answering for David Preus the letter you send him concerning
the conditions for the appearance of the Sea Islanders in the
Walker series.  Mr. Preus told me to accept the fee and transportation
conditions on behalf of the organization.  I am personally
seeing to the accomodations of the the performers while in Minneapolis
and can assure you that they will not be neglected or compromised
in any manner, as, I understand, has happened to them elsewhere.
I have made arrangements for them to stay with a family near me
for as long as they will be in town.  Their accomodations will be
both comfortable and congenial, and they will be met at the bus
depot by me or my friends upon arrival.  I can understand your
concern for them as persons as well as performers.
At the afternoon workshop I intend to follow your suggestion
that perhaps Bessie and group could perform in conjuction with
Mississippi John Hurt's accompaniment.  If it appears in an informal
atmosphere that they could work together briefly, I will
include a few such numbers at the conclusion of the Saturday
evening concert.  I plan to open the concert with Bessie and
friends for a set, followed by Mississippi John's solo set.
After intermission, Estes, Nixon, and Rachel will play; then
perhaps the Sea Islanders can return with Hurt to conclude the
program.  I am hoping that the concert will demonstrate to the 
audience a discernible chronological progression of Negro styles
and material; I am convinced that the evening will be a rich and 
exciting musical experience for all concerned.
Sincerely,
Jon Pankake

Dear Pancake-
It would be great if Hurt + 
Sea Islanders got along musically.
Then we could plan to tour them
as a cultural unit.  Please send me
a tape of how it sounds.
