Many groups lack organizations for the vocalization of their interests
and desires, or may be inaccurately represented by such official
spokesmen as they may have.

Does the priesthood really express the attitudes of the mass
of the Catholics? How truly does NAACP, etc., speak for all Negroes,
rich, poor, literate and ignorant? Who, if anyone, articulates
the hopes and fears of the tenant farmers?

It seems reasonable to suppose that the rumors more prevalent within
a given group than in the population at large will throw light on the
overall morale of the group and more specifically:

a) What events does it hope for?
b) What consequences does it fear?
c) Toward whom is it most hostile, etc.?

(This is in line with Gordon Allport's belief that rumors
can be classified on the basis of "emotional coloring").

Therefore, if classification of rumors current among various groups do
show significant differences, we should be able to develop a more direct
picture of the thinking and emotions of groups than through official 
sources.

This material could be obtained by polling of individuals, but this
would be a long process requiring a much larger sample than is customary
if statistically significant group differences are to be detected. Also,
in such a poll, each respondent would require identification regarding all
important population groups to which he belong--more background material
than is usually supplied.

OGR provides a simple way of getting at the matter. We could ask the
field workers to consult men in daily contact with groups regarding the
gossip current among them. Insofar as the men consulted had organizational
positions, information from them might be prejudiced, but this influence
would be at a minimum when describing "stories" they have heard, whereas
it would be at a maximum if they were outlining organization policies.
