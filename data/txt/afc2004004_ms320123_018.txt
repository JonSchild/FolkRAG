FONTENOT  You all understand the difference?
[MUSIC]
FONTENOT  [LAUGHS]  Oh yeah, we had a, it's
an ole, ole guy, he used to work on my violin and stuff.
And he says I know all, he sayd, I notice all, you all, I
heard some accordian play in your age or older.  Well I
says, we used to make our own beat, you know.  Its a lot of
people be surprised about the way we, we carry a beat.
LOMAX  You want to back off and get that,
[Nick]?
     :  I got it.
[MUSIC]
LOMAX  Now I want to ask you another
question, so think about.
     :  I want to trade places with you.
[UNCLEAR]
[DIRECTIONS]
LOMAX  I want you to think back now, in
those early bands, when did you first hear the, the piece of
iron, the triangle?
FONTENOT  The triangle?  Oh, whenever I was
old enough to know something they had it.
LOMAX  Was that the end of, it was at,
both the white and the black bands or was it just the black
bands?
