Dear Alan:

The moving-picture camera which you asked for was shipped to
you this morning. The films will be shipped to you direct from
the Eastman firm in Rochester, because there were none available
in this city which were properly packed for tropical use. You
will receive 600 feet of film, colored, super-sensitive, and
regular. If you think this quantity insufficient, please estimate
the number of additional feet of film you will require, decide on
the type or types of film suitable for your purpose and send in a
request as soon as possible. Please remember that, included in the
purchase price of the film is the cost of developing, so do not
attempt to develop or have others develop the film in Haiti. Send
us the rolls as soon as they are exposed and we will have them
developed here.

If there is anything else which you will need, such as records
or photo-accessories, please request them as far in advance as possible. 
The material you have sent so far is most interesting. Don't 
forget to photograph all the instruments and get as much information
as possible regarding their tuning. Are the drums tuned with each
other in any special way?

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke.

Mr. Alan Lomax
