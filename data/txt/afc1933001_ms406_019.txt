Dese bones gwine to rise again
Of dis tale dere aint no mo

("That's making him laugh.  It's good for a fat man to laugh.  Before
he recovers, quick, hit him with another with some pathos and only
enough of the comic to keep him going.  He's slipping now and is not
trying to hold back".)

Then I fired my third and last short - A ballad I had found on
the Texas Gulf Coast in the district between the Colorado and Brazos
rivers where the two river bottoms spread out and overlap and where
Negroes are thicker than mustang grapes.  The story of "Ida Red" is
personal and direct.  It hits like a rifle bullet.  When it is ended
you don't know whether to laugh or to cry.  This time again I read
much more than I am printing.

I went down town one day in a 
Fooled around till I stole a coat,
Then I came back and did my best,
Fooled around till I got the vest -
Oh, weep, oh, my Ida

Waitin' all ready for de East bound train,
And every station we passed by,
Seemed like I hear little Ida cry,
Oh, weep, oh, my Ida
For over that road I'se bound to go.
