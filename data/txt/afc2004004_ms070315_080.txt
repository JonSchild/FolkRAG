ghost in that church-- split over whether
speaking in tongues [ws] meant a [?]
soul had been really baptized in Holiness.
Many splits since - question of women
preachers - inheritance of church power -
According to Suggs the movement most
proliferous in cities - Chicago & New 
York - every little hole in the wall - visit
to fathom Divine - could talk like a streak
convince you of anything - Suggs didn't
open his mouth at meeting for fear of
"being misboted." God appeared among
Jews, an oppressed people - now among
Negroes - Suggs, the connoiseur of
religions - the sanctified divine - church
of God mostly Diviney hymns - a jazz
age brings jazz music to the church -
Church of God first to use past time.

The service that night - speaker system awful -
choir shrill & hot with Suggs playing marvellous
piano - crowd well dressed - women all in
white directing with elegntly poised red
pen holder - shouting very swishy - parading up
and down - a couple of stomp downers - one
white woman in group - bad preaching -
