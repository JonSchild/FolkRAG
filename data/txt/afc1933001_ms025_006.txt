Wilton, Conn,
2/16/1935

Dear Mr. Struck:
After all my efforts I think
I left some mail in your office.
Please have Miss Rogers to forward 
it here; also include one large 
[?] envelope in which the authorities
of the Ohio [?] have
agreed to send 8 ballads, somewhat
[un?] in subject matter.  I'll
put my name on it (and music department)
so that you can indentify
it when it comes back.
Alan says Mr. Wotnr
knows where the machine is
down under the music room
Alan left the batteries with the
Chief electrician.  Thanks again
for your courtesy.
Sincerely
John A. Lomax
