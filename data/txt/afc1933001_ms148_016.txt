Mr. Beal D. Taylor 
Medina, Texas 

Dear Mr. Taylor: 

          Both Doctor Spivacke and John A. Lomax 
are out of town and I am therefore replying 
to your letter of the 11th. The records 
which you made for the Archive collection 
are among the most interesting renditions 
of cowboy songs that we have acquired.

           We should be delighted to send you 
copies of everything you sang for us at 
once, but as the moment, we have no facilities 
for duplication of these records in the 
Library of Congress. In the next three or 
four weeks, however, I shall endeavor to have 
some duplications made for you and they will 
be sent to you free of charge because of the 
valuable service you have rendered the 
Division. 

                   Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of American Folksong
