Didn' know what it was , but they knew they had to go around it.

[*TRUE GHOST STORY: NEGRO FINDS DEAD MONEY BUT WHITE TAKES IT ALL*]
TL:  Bessie, do a lot a people do all this diggin'?
BJ:  Yeah!  White, white folks git it rough.  They -- on the
Island, especially.  Anywhere else.  When they hear talk a sumpin'
somewhere, they don't want a negro to git it.
      You know the richest white man almost down in the South
there?  If you ever go down there, I'll show 'im to you, show
ya what he got.  Name Arthur Troup.
      A colored man -- this same people what I rent from now, you
know -- the, her father, ah, Mr. Dennison, was workin' with him.
An' this white man had on his apron overalls.  He come there
workin' by the day, Arthur Troup.  He's a good-lookin' man, I'm
tellin' you.  But he came there workin' by the day.  Now ya
oughta see that man!  He's a mansion man!  Come through that one
colored man.  But God is gonna move things, jus' t' show ya when.
Never git too late, ya know.  God don't forget nothin'.
      This man an' him were workin' together.  Him an' George, an'
um, name was um, Mr. Dennison.  An' where they was, uh, they was diggin' a
place for, [you know,] ta, for, ta put a bridge across a, a lil'
road, ya know.  An' Mr. Dennison dug up a long, ah, sewer pipe.  An'
hit was stopped up at each end.  An' he went an' showed it to
Arthur Troup, an' asked him what was [in it] this.
      Arthur, he brokes into the thing an' looks.  He says, "Aw,
it ain't nothin', nothin' but some ol' ol' paper stuff."  He says,
"But I like this pipe."  Says, "Here," says, "[Here] You..."  An' give
him one twenty-five cent.  In the payment.
TL:  A dollar twenty-five?
