To find him, we went way into the backwoods of
eastern Mississippi, and he was at the very
end of a little tiny country road, behind
hedges and, and a place difficult to get to,
and when we knocked on the door, there was a 
long silence before it opened, and then he - 
this ah old fellow peered out, and said:  No,
no, he didn't sing the Blues;  no, he didn't 
have a guitar;  absolutely never HEARD of the
whole thing. And I had a wonderful companion,
a black man, with me who was one of the leaders
of the Mississippi int - int, integration
movement, and he couldn't move ah, ah, Jack
Owens any more than I could.  So we went away,
and came back the next day and tried again. 
And then we go to come in the house and sit
down and talk it out with him, and, ah, I had
my guitar with me, and he said:  Looks like a 
good guitar, but ah, I really haven't played
in so long.  I don't think I could do it.

So we heard that he had a friend, ah, named
Bud Spiers, and we drove to his house, and went
into his front room, and there was Bud leaning
into television and playing along with he's
heard on his harmonica - fantastic Blues
harmonica.
