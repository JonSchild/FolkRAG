Blood Plasma

This story takes place in the 
Solomon Islands were a group of
Marines is getting shots against
diseases.
The man who is giving the shots
is not a doctor himself, but a pharmacist
connected with the Medical
Staff. As a young, nice looking
Marine comes up to get his shot,
the pharmacist reconized him as
his kid brother. They plan to meet
later in the day when they have
a leisure hour.
Before this could happen, Sam,
the kid brother, and his pal
volunteered to be the ones to throw
hand grenades at a nest of "Jap" machine
guns.
As the two lads crept close to the
nest, a "Jap" threw a grenade past
them and as it exploded it knocked
both unconcious. Sam, unlike
his pal, did not com to so his pal
went back to get help.
