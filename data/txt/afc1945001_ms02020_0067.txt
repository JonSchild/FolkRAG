STATE EASY 5TH

Nobody Within Ranks of Civil
Defense Trained to Cope
With Peril, Brawley Club Told
BRAWLEY, Aug. 3.–"In no
way has the State Civilian Defense
Organization, as set up by
the present State Administration,
prepared to do anything
about the fifth column menace."
This charge was made today
by Earl Warren, nonpartisan candidate
for Governor, addressing
Brawley service clubs at a luncheon
attended by scores who were
not members of the clubs.
"One of the greatest dangers
we face in this country is failure
of the civilian population to
realize," Warren said, "that we
have active fifth columnists at
work here."
These groups, he pointed out,
followed the same pattern in all
countries, adding:
"They work quietly until actual
hostilities begin–as they
did in France, then they come
out in the open and help to
spread confusion and panic
among the population so the invaders
have an easier time of
conquering the country."
He warned and urged all to be
on the alert to spot work of fifth
columnists who spread rumors
damaging to America's war program.
"It is unfortunate,' he said,
"that in our State Civilian Defense
there is not a single man
who has had training as a sheriff,
police officer, district attorney
or FBI operative–that
is, the kind of training needed
to combat fifth column activities."
Warren spoke yesterday at El
Centro and last night at Calexico.
