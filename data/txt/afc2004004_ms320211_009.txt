AL ROSE   -8

the biggest band day of the year among black musicians is
Mother's Day.  There's a big Mother's Day tradition here
where all the bands are out.  And they play, they play jazz.
Now they also played for dedication of churches and lodges
and advertising various event that are taking place.  They
were playing on wagons well into the '30s to advertise prize
fights and, and dances at various dance halls, and openings
of grocery stores and all kinds of events like that.  Of
course white bands did that, too though.  [MUSIC]  The only
thing that the white bands didn't do was the funeral thing
because that's not part of ....

LOMAX          Now the [UNCLEAR]... I think it's 
time for us to retire into our cubbyhole again.

ROSE             Yeah, okay.  We've got to go in 
here because of the noise.

:        Because of the what?
   
ROSE              When the band is playing we
can't...

LOMAX           Bring a chair.

ROSE              We'll be around the corner from 
the noise.  Come in, there's room.
             It's hard for anybody to really realize what
a musical place this was because it was just a part of
everybody's life.  And really a day didn't go by when there
wasn't music in your life.
