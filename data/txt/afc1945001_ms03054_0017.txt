What Rumors People Are Telling
Part I

(1) August 3 - Richmond, Virginia. A policeman in his automobile
stated that he believed the war will be over by September.
He thinks that Russia will hold her own until winter and that the 
United States is doing all she can for Russia. He thinks that
they have a good reason for not opening a second front at this 
time.   [*4*]

(2) August 3 - Richmond, Virginia. Another policeman in the
same car said that he had heard many people say that Lady Astor 
was right -- that Russia is fighting for Russia. He says that
if the Germans keep on going the way they are now that Russia
will make a special peace pact with them, leaving the Axis forces
to turn on England and the United States.

(3) August 4 - Richmond, Virginia. Stowe's article that appeared
on the front page of the Richmond News Leader caused quite a stir
among a great many of the people. A housewife, after reading the
article, said that she believes he is right and that we will be
conquered within a few months -- having our homes and everything
we have taken away from us. She says that she has felt this way
all the time as the people with whom she comes in contact are disinterested
and are too sure of themselves.
