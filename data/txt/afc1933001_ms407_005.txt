an age that is fast drifting into
the trash heaps of things that
were." We will scrap stirrups
and ride back to back again
with the old timers.

In the early part of 1930
a group of Stamford men,
headed by Swenson Ranch 
managers met to form an
Association to keep alive
the memories and traditions
of the Old West, the gays 
of the long horn cattle and
the open range To answer
the cook's call from the church wagon " Come and
git it or I'll throw it
to the dogs."

"Under the star-studded canopy
Cast,
Campfire and Coffee and comfort
at last;
Bacon that sizzles and crisp in
the pan
After the round-up smells
good to a man."
