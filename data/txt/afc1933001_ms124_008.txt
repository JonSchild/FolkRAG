Wilson and I made ard any other you 
culd send. You see I put out but have n?thg
to keep when I get thrgt but memries.
What wuld it cost me to get the whole 
pkg just as yu and Mrs Lomax have it,
records and pictures. I do not want to 
appear greedy but I have worked fr years to 
help these Negroes and wuld love t have
their wirk.

I am getting into proper form the 
material for Mr. Lomax and will mail 
it just as soon as I can.
The Negroes were charmed, and want 
you all to come again.

Remember me to Mr. Lomax and 
Mr Wilson joins me in best wishes
Sincerly
