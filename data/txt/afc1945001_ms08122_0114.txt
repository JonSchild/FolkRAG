A soldier went wearily into a 
barber shop and slumped down
into a chair.
"Give me a shave," he said.
The barber told him that he was
too far down in the chair for a shave. 
"All right," said the soldier wearily,
"give me a haircut."

Air Raid Warden: "For incendiary bombs
you should have two buckets of
sand and a long-handled shovel."
Housewife: "But what if it happens
to be a high-explosive bomb?"
Warden: "you won't need the sand 
then."
