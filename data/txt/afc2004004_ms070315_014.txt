    Clarkesdale honors the Negro Soldiers

    Courthouse square -- cool & shady
lawn-a crowd of 400 Negroes
gather to send off 115 N selectees
only a few whites far off on the
edges - a platform in the center of
the crowd - Mrs. Rogers, opens the 
meeting - a piano appears on the
truck, Houston Baco, looking mighty
solemn, assisting - people, quiet,
well dressed - song sheets passed around -
Mrs. R:
     1) to pay honor to these selectees -
to preserve democratic way of life -
members of our group have always
taken their part -
      2) We civilians will stay behind
them - food for victory, defense bonds
