Recommended by an Outdoor Expert

I have recommended Beaver Island to hundreds and 
have yet to hear the first complaint. It's quiet there--no
confusion, no radio, no trains, trucks or overland buses. Just
fresh air, wonderful food, comfortable beds and a spirit of
good feeling and friendliness only to be found on the Island.  
Where your company and fellowship mean more to
the inhabitants than the city dollars that roll along the 
highways of the mainland.  Rest, swimming, hiking and fun
with real folks for you companions--and some of the most
beautiful trails through the timberland that I have ever
seen.  If it is high life and night life you crave, Beaver Island
is not the place.  But for peace and comfort, good fishing
and getting next to Nature--you'll find a cordial welcome
on the Island.
