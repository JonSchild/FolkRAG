Dear Kip.

This letter will be a strange mixture of things, and I am not
counting the two-fingered typo-errors.

Your letter turned the tide. Two days after it was written, McLeish
had included me in the Rockefeller application, not as a radio fellow,
but as the folk-lore, folk-music expert. He thinks, I understand, that
I am no writer and I sometimes agree with him. Anyhow he has given me
the nod and I will have a chance to prove him wrong. Someday to show
my appreciation, when you want to go on vacation, I'll volunteer to ghost-
write your book-reviews.

You know we locked horns the first time we met and, being young
and childish, I took the battle very seriously. Working with you
for two weeks in the back country completely revised this edition. The
whole cast came around and expressed the same opinion about you. I'm no
good at this, but it was good to know you.

I'm sorry that Lucky Strike and you feel tentative about the
show. It ought to go on the air , while the traffic is light. The reactions
I have had from the hinterlands have been extremely favorable. I am inclined
to agree with your first reaction when you saw the script that a great
deal of mcing is not essential and this I think will be even more the case
when we have the cast that we want, including Sidney Bechet, the Coon Creek
Girls, Wade [Min] Mainer and others. At the behest of
various friends of mine I have been thinking of myself in the mc's shoes
and I want to know what you think of it. The material and the
performers  might sell the show
