Dear Mr. Lomax: 
Two letters from you, one received day before yesterday
and the other of March 29 received this morning. This note 
is as to the latter. 
I have at once sent a note to the State Department, 
asking for representation to the American Minister at Port-au-
Prince to further both the admission of the camera and film, duty 
free, and to make arrangements with the Haitian Department of the 
Interior for the use of the camera in Haiti. I have added a request 
that the communication with the Minister be by cablegram, 
in the hope that it may not prove too late for your purpose. 
The misfortune is, of course, that you did not earlier 
anticipate the difficulties, and our only criticism is that, having 
the phenomena before you from the start, you did not do so. 
Your postscript mentions the need of an additional 
$100 to cover any small fees for performance. We can allow that, 
but again find difficulty in arranging the matter. The simplest 
procedure seems to be to issue an additional $100 payable to you, 
in reimbursement for the various small sums that you will have 
paid out. I am accordingly enclosing a voucher drawn to you, 
which cannot, however, be paid until returned to us with the receipts 
attached from the various people to whom you have made the
 payments. You have, I believe, forms of receipt which you secure 
from them. 
Very truly yours, 
Hubert [Putnam?]
Librarian 
(Enclosure) 
N.B.-- Since dictating the above, an even simpler method has 
occurred to us which will place the money in your hands at once. 
This is to add $100 to the payment that would now be going to you 
for your personal service during the last half of March. The check 
that goes to you today from the Disbursing 
Office will therefore be for 
$115, with the understanding that 
$100 of this will be applicable to 
your disbursements in connection with 
these films, or other such incidentals. 
Receipts for the items will still be desired, but those you may turn in later. 

Mr. Alan Lomax,
