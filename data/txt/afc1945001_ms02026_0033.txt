2-2-2-  Mr. William H. Webber.  10/13/42

All of them would undoubtedly agree to repeat their performance but
only one or two would accept it on a continuing basis.  The Druggist, the
Policeman and the Labor Leader were most enthusiastic.  Both the Druggist
and the Policeman, I am sure would be glad to handle the assignment
permanently.

Here is a suggestion:  The American Women's Voluntary Services 
is now operating in high gear here.  The majority of its members are also members of the Business and Professional Women's Club.  The members
include female lawyers, accountants, advertising directors, personnel
directors, etc.  For ability and agressiveness the organization is the last
word.

These women are looking for something constructive to do in connection 
with the war effort.  They even offer free-of-charge expert stenographic 
service in the evenings.  Inasmuch as this chapter of AWVS is composed of business women their talents are not readily susceptible to activities of 
the Red Cross, OCD and other agencies where most of the work is done during the day.

If you are interested in this organization let me know and I will
furnish you with a detailed report on its various committees along with the
names of the officers.

Yours Sincerely,

Louis F. Hutchinson
Asst. Field Representative
