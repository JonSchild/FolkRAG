1. "There is going to be a nation-wide rationing of gasoline,
and Brown & Bigelow (a large St. Paul firm in the field
of printing specialties located at 1286 University Avenue)
holds the contract for printing all the rationing cards."
(a), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8/3/42.

2. "Northern Pump Company (holder of large and important war
contracts with plant location at 48th & N.E. Marshall,
Minneapolis) is paying its workers not less than $1.50
an hour on any job." (a), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8/3/42.

3. "All negro troops thus far sent beyond the borders of
the United States have been assigned to service-of-
supply or labor battalion activities." (b), Minneapolis,
Minnesota, 8/6/42.
(NOTE: This statement implies that there has been
prejudical treatment of colored soldiers in 
that many of them desire assignment to combat
units."

4. "The Government has seized the plans of an individual
covering a tractor which, when operated, could stop
airplanes and automobiles from functioning as planned
by their operators." (b), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8/6/42.
(NOTE:
Such a 'Jules Verne' tractor device may be
fantasy or not. Experts will have to determine
that point.)

Unquestionably, there is a lot of 'down-town quarter-
backing' on the part of many members of society who hold that they
could do a better job in this or that field if given the reins.
All too many people set themselves up as self-styled columnists
in their attempts to interpret the news.
