say about what Mr. Putnam wrote in his letter. He
asked me to manage the settlement
so that Mrs. Seeger would not be
writing to him, but gave me no inkling
of what the  amount would be. He didn't know himself.
3. I gave her a chance to pay
the bill, for I had understood that
is what she wanted to do.
4. As soon as I can I will
settle with Macmillan, as I promised
Mr. Putnam.
5. I have not mentioned the
book to her since the copy went
in finally, nor have I ever written
a word since that time except 
in a most friendly manner.
6. People who are suspicious
of other people's integrity will probably
prove to be unpleasant partners.
