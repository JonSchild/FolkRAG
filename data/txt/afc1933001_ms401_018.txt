"Ef salvation wuz a thing money could buy,
Den de rich would lib an' de po' would die.
I'm so glad God fixed it so
Dat de rich mus' die as well as de po'."
***
"Dey nailed His bones an' rivet His feet,
De hammers wuz heard in Jerusalem street,
An' de blood come-a twinklin' diwn.
Some come cripple, an' some come lame,
But dey went away walkin' in my God's name.
Some come deef an' some come dum',
But dey went away talkin' in my God's tongue.
***
"An-a golden crown placed on-a my head,
An' my long white robe come-a dazzlin' down.
Now wait till I git on my gospel shoes,
Gwine to walk about heaven an' tell de news."

Up in heaven also all social distinctions are at end:
"Two milk-white hosses side by side
Me and my Jesus gwine take an evenin' ride."

"Oh, when I git to heaven gwine to be at ease,
Me an' God gwinter do as we please!"

The music we have recorded, the black man's songs of labor and toil that throb with rhythmical power, that picture bodies in extreme physical endeavor working in unison, the songs that grow out of this daily life and are a part of it since they add happiness to it, may yet find their way to wider recognition.  Just as the sweat pours from him as a product of his labor, so do the songs spring from his brain and find utterance in melodies.  "Green Pasture," the negro play which had a record run in New York City, was built around a group pf lovely negor spirituals.  Perhaps these labor songs will some day constitute the major theme of some notable musical composition, or be wrought into a drama to move the heart of man to more sympathy for our brother in black.  This much is certain:  Many, many musical crititics assert that the negro has crested our most original and distinctive American music.
