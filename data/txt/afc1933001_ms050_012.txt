Dear Mr. Leslie:
    I have been wondering if you have discovered
any new folk-songs or ballads since our corres-
pondence of a few years ago. I also wish to know
if you know of anybody in Columbus who might sing
the tunes to those which you have already furnished
me. All of your material has gone into the Folk-
Song Archive of the Library of Congress with you as
the donor.
    I shall appreciate hearing from you again with
any information that may lead to the furtherance of
our progress in bringing together in this Library
the words and music of all the principal types of
Folk-songs current in the United States.

    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
    Archive of American Folk-Song
