College   Sophomore  Negro    Male

1. We would rather do almost anything than be inducted 
into the army. Why should the army put the finger 
on us 18 yr-olds when they still have married men to draw 
from? It's just isnt right.

2. We hope that the Axis forces are driven out of 
Tunesia in a hurry. At least we won't be worried about 
doing that part of the dirty work when we enter.

3. If you dont grab a defense job - - - you're doomed.

4. The war must be won at al most any cost -- so even 
if the U.S. Government doesn't know what it is doing -
- - - - what the heck? They've got to have manpower 
so right now we're getting to the point where, oh well, 
whats the use of caring about anything?

5. Why should we stay in school in times such as 
these? We arent doing any thing but wasting valuble 
time. If we got jobs (non-essential) we could have 
a little spending change before we go in.
