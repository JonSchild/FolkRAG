Dear Alan Lomax - 

Another hasty note.

Since I wrote this morning, we have had the film processed at
Consolidated.  It seemed pointless to wait, since it had to be
done and there is danger in delay.  Moreover, Consolidated agreed
to treat us as a charity case & charge for materials only.  I have
approached Eastman, begging print stock, and have some hope.  If
Eastman comes through, we will have a work-print for comparatively
little, Consolidated having agreed to do this for cost as well.

Do you have access to a 35mm projector?  It's pointless to try to
get detail or make artistic judgements on the basis of what you see
through a viewer.

The group will be here until about the middle of June, that is - long
enough for one crack at re-takes and perhaps a few children's games.

The film I have in mind would be 8-10 minutes, either b&w or color,
the latter involving slight tinting or just printing on color stock
(a little coloring creeps in) + quiet colored titles.  Saul Bass,
not incidentally, has offered to do the titles.  No narration.  Where
explanation is needed - captions, in the Flaherty style.  Perhaps we
can get a quiet opening shot of St. Sim[e]on - mist & moss, etc.

The shooting wasn't without its personal moments.  Your friend, the
Williamsburg music film cameraman, arrived with more enthusiasm than
subtlety.  Then [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] John Davis decided not to be
up-staged by Bessie & he kept singing Moses until every camera had to
be reloaded.  Bessie started one song with, 'Take 1, Oh Lord . . .'
and finally, the group exhausted to the point of numbness, seeing all
the camera lights go dead when the last foot of film was used, swung into
the most stirring performance of the day, 'Yonder Comes Day' that just
brought down the studio - but not an inch went on film or tape.  Still,
they are real performers - the faces, the dances, words, etc. - all
are so powerful; the cameramen were top studio men; the equipment was 
standard stuff- so, my guess is, that we will get a lot of conventional,
technically adequate footage, with sections here and there that stand
out, and when [xxx] we're working with a 1/15 - 1/20 ratio - well, something
good may come out of it.

My original estimate of $1300 for processing & w/p can be revised now to 
around $300, bringing the expenses to date to around $800.
