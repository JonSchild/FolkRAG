1. Heard as I was going home for Christmas vacation:
          "As Negros in the United States, this is our
country. Ninety nine out of every hundred of us have
not seen and will not see Africa. It is our duty
therefore to aid this country in the war effort
as much as we possibly can. However, this is the
only good that drives us in the prejudices, hatred
and unfairness that is shown to us sometimes
tends to lead us away from thoughts of patriotism
and loyalty."

2. "We don't have anything to fight for. If we do survive
the onslaught of battle, our return home
will only be heralded by snubs and disregard
for our condition and the condition
of our families."

3. "This is everyone's war and though the
attitude and action of the whites are most
unbearable we must fight on and seek
an ultimate victory."
