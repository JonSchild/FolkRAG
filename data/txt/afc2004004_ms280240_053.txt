We both set down upon the ground  for to complete our joy,
Go where ye will and I'll love him still, hes my darling ploughman boy
The sacks and leaves are well pulled down, on them Ill make my bed
The greenwood piles are well put down below my weary head
The reaper bush will be my guide and for once my heart (decoy)
Go where you will and I'll love him still, he's my darling ploughman boy.
Now since I'm not inclined to tell to you his name,
He is the laddie and the man, the lad that I love well,
But when he sings the valley rings and he makes my heart feel joy,
Go where you will and I love him still, he's my darling ploughman boy.
(Oh that's a beauty, that's a beauty . You know, Jimmy, it seems
to me that a lot of that must have gone on in the old days when
[the rich], you know the rich men, tried to grab off all the best
looking girls)
Thats right.  I've heard the people tell me about that.  I
heard my mother tell me that.  It was in her day that they did.
(What did she tell you about it?)
That when they got ... that they took advantage of them.  The
masters did.
(They did?)
The did.  The masters took advantage of them - they left their
own wife and flustered (messed) about with them.  They did a lot of that
you know.
