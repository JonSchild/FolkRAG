VII Two American Fiddlers
Fiddling Bill Hensley is a rosy cheeked, blue eyed lumberjack
who's seen everything from the point of view of a contented 
extrovert  Ozie helton, half-breed Cherokee, looks at things 
from the bottom of the heap, and wonders.  Both are fierce 
and gusty talkers.

VIII Harmless Bob Doolan Gets Drunk
[*p.296]*]
A monologue account of a Kentucky mountain bat which lasts 
for three days, in which the participants cover a lot of rough 
country and come back home safe in the end. 

IX. There is a Hell
[*see p.9*]
A complete Negro service, preached by Rev. H. M. Ribbins, 
Jackson, Tennessee, Maple Grove Baptist Church.

X. Brief Portraits
A group of seven to ten two-page sketches of Americans by 
themselves, brief and glowing accounts of dances, fights, 
pioneering, gettin' religion, in America.

"Listen to Our Story" is a tentative title for the volume.

Now Jim, the material is all here, ready to be transcribed 
and edited.  It will take a lot of typing, and it will also cost 
some money to get some of the records duplicated for transcription,
and I need an advance.  I want to do this book.  Let me know what you think.

Best regards,
Alan Lomax
