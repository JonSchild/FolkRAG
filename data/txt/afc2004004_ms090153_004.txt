They’d all be marchin round and they’d answer me....
O yes, O yes.
I’d sing...
In a golden, bright buggy
They’d answer me again...
O yes, o yes.
Now choose you two partners
O yes, o yes
An’ wan’s a good rappin 
O yes, yes.
Then they’d go to clappin their hands and dancin crazy all

O candy, candy gal,
O candy, candy gal,
Swing her all day long...]
