terrible cold weather, snow.
I just about froze----
Saturday our Football boy
played L'Anse the game was
nothing to nothing. Kid it was snowing 
just terrible I was sick couldn't
go. poor me.
[Allen] Alan please will you tell me
when you answer just what you
think of and about me? Pa said
to say hello.
Hows all those songs coming
along? Boy ever so often we all
talk about you. If only I could
hear you sing that Spanish song
once [aweek?] I would be perfectly well.
Guess I'll close.
