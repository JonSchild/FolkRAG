The Iago of this ballad exemplifies for L.B.
an all-too-common [sort of human being] type of humanity. [*the "snake"*]
"Peoples is mean an' jealous hearted," he has often declared." They
see you doin' a little better 'n they are, they see you
got a lil' sumpin they haven' got, an' they gon' try to
do you sumpin. If you got a car, they gon' punch holes
in yo' tires. If you love yo' wife, they gon' try to make
out to you she's foolin' you wid some odder man.
They say anything to make trouble. Yassuh, they's lotsa
people's in de worl' jus' that mean.

Now you notice how ev'y time I get in our car, I m gonna look
all aroun' it, look at de casin's under de hood, under de
seats, to be sho nobody ain' done nothin' to it. Somebody
liable to come along wid some stuff he done stole an' hide 
it in yo' house or in yo' car. Then you get in trouble an'
ain' know nothin' about it. I'm tellin you they's mean peoples
in this world an' you gotta watch yo' se'f if you don't want
'em to do you sumpin.
