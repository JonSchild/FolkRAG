(Alan) Didn't they like that kind of music?

Well, you see, you see the way the white man is in the South is this. Anything's
good ---- they think it's too good for the Negro see? An' uh uh uh a Negro barber - 
you know what I mean? My uncle he was the barber in the, in the South an' uh--
he was a-known to be one of the best uh barbers that was around there see? Well they
wouldn' 'llow him to cut uh colored people's hair - none a the Negro's hair uh
uh he had to cut the white people's xxxx hair because he was too good -- they figured
all the good things was for the-uh for the white man see? The same thing is they
figure about xxx a real nice-lookin Negro woman. They think she's too good for a Negro
man make no diffence if she do want one. They- they- the white man'll get salty an'
he'll get mad because -- she' she's really nice- nice was -- just as good a-lookin'

musician to be playin' for Negroes," see? "you should be playin' for white people".
See? An'-uh therefore the- they wouldn' allow me to play XXX aroun' for my own
