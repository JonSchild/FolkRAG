A considerable collection of tunes from white singers in Florida has come
from Professor Alton C. Morris, of the University of Florida at Gainesville.
I worked three days with him. Afterwards he made a number of recordings on
the Library's machine. Worthy of special mention also is a group of songs
that come from a funeral home for Negroes in Columbia, South Carolina. This
trained choir limits its songs to a special type chosen for their emotional
appeal. Also at Charleston, South Carolina, I made a practically complete record
on nine discs of "Plantation Echoes". Mrs. Rose Warren Wilson of Martins
Point, South Carolina, employing as singers the Negroes of her husband's plantation,
has composed a musical drama of Negro rural life in which only folk tunes
are employed.

In connection with the effort of the Music Division of the Library of Congress
to build up a collection of folk songs emphasizing first, those of definite
American origin and those that have been modified by singers in this
country, it may interest the read to know that:

1. The management of the Folk-Song Archive considers the making of
records as of first importance to a full appreciation of the music. The
voluminous and excellent collection of mountain ballads brought together
by Professor Cecil Sharp is musically deficient because all his tunes were
written down from singing. The same thing may be said of nearly all collections
of folk songs. We have no means of checking the hearing of one pair
of ears. In contrast, all interested musicians may pass on an identical
record.

2. Tunes of unusual musical interest have been recorded in different
sections of the country and in various States, thus providing for students
many variants of the same song. In a few instances, as many as a dozen
records of the same tune are available for comparison.

3. The explanation of the proportionately larger number of records
of Negro folk songs is that more Negro songs are available. The Negro
is our chief folk singer.

4. In every instance, records have been made of the so-called Child
ballads, as listed in Professor Child's monumental study of the English
and Scottish ballads. Mrs. Emma Dusenberry of Mena, Arkansas, and the Gant
family of Austin, Texas, were each able to furnish tunes for more than twenty
of these ballads.

5. On every record is cut the name of the singer, the date and place, and,
wherever possible, whatever information the singer knows of the song's origin.

All my work for the Folk-Song Archive during the past year has been made
possible through the coordination and support of the Historical Records Survey, under
the direction of Dr. Luther Evans; and of the Federal Writers' Project, headed
by Mr. Henry G. Alsberg. In connection with trips for these two Federal Surveys
I was permitted to stop occasionally and make records. The grateful thanks of the
Music Division are tendered them. For the first time in the history of the Folk-
