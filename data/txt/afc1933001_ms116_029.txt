[C. 1936?]

To the Librarian:

1. There are no spirituals in the American sense in
Haiti. the country is and has always been nominally
Catholic and precludes such music.

2. There are some work songs on the water front and 
a few to be had in the cane fields. Very different
from the American type and important

3. Dance music is the most important type in Haiti.
The meringue, the national dance calls for a very
spirited and smoky rhythm. Endless songs and music
has been composed and is continually being made
for this dance. But it is only one of the prevalent
dance types. There are four other sub-types of
equal importance, but time, space, and technical
difficulties of description of these would take
so much time that this letter would not get off
by the plane today. If the director will excuse
me on this score, it will facilitate matters
considerably. Thank you.
