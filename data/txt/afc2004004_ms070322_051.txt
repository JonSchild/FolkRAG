with my analysis - gone except for
moments when I'm not deprived
& angry. Then all sorts of hostile
ideas come - mostly however of having
other relationships & needing hers
no longer.

We went to the fair on Hamstead 
Heath. Very gaudy, very dull carocels. 
Rather grubby games of chance. A
young man with a white turban
missed my age & called me 25.
Had an idea for a funny film
shot. The whirling swing & 
at a certain point the seats
are let go one after another &
their occupants go flying toward
the horizon [line], disappearing
behind the trees and the clock
tower. The close-ups of the outraged
business man, the delighted child,
the young lady fixing her lipstick, etc.
