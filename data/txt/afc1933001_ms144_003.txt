Dear Dr. Lomax:

In reply to my letter of March 21, which you handed to Dr. Harold Spivacke,
Dr. Spivacke states that the only machine available in the Library at
present is in need of repairs and replacements.  It probably is just as 
well that we could not rent a machine from the Library of Congress,
because that circumstance in connection with a few others has led to a
decision on the part of Goshen College authorities to purchase an RCA
recording outfit.

I am leaving tomorrow morning Iowa City, Iowa, where in collaboration
with Dr. Melvin Gingerich, I am making some twenty recordings of Amish
hymns and hymn tunes.  Dr. Gingerish states that the Amish in his community
sing more than twenty different tunes and he is of the opinion that the 
Iowa group has preserved as many of the tunes as any other Amish community
in the United States. The Iowa group has been very conservative in some 
ways, but very zealous in preserving the modes and forms of worship and
the traditions of the fathers during the one hundred years of their Iowa
residence. They came originally from Berks and Lancaster Counties in
Pennsylvania, and moved to Iowa after a residence of several decades in
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. One interesting thing about the Iowa group
is that a very old gentleman, who is one of their hymn leaders, has decided
that the only way to preserve the hymns and hymn tunes for posterity is
notate them so that the young people can learn them. We succeeded in
persuading him that the only way to notate them properly was to record
them first so that they could be studied and notated more easily. The
recordings which I am making tomorrow and Thursday are to be the property
of the Mennonite Historical Society at Goshen College.

In one of your recent letters, you mentioned recording the hymns of the
Mennonites. The hymns which the Mennonites in this community sing in
their worship services would not be of particular interest to the folklorist 
because they have broken entirely with the musical tradition of
their forefathers. Their hymns are selected from a wide variety of
sources. They sing their hymns of Wesley, Fannie Crosby, Chas Gabriel, 
P. P. Billhorn[e], W. S. Weeden, in fact of a wide variety of eighteenth
century and present day hymn writers and composers including probably a
dozen hymns composed by Mennonites, but not in the old Mennonite tradition.
