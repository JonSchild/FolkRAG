R 6      Tape: APPALACHIA,      P. 8

the way around, that way you get to swing all the women and then you
come back to your partner.
 
I:   Women hate to get swung by all the men, don't you?  (Laughter)

Woman:   I think it's much more fun for the men.

I:   Oh is it now?

Woman:   I believe it is!

I:   Why do the women wear all those puffy skirts if it's so much more
fun for the men?

Woman:   I be darned if I know, we're trying to look pretty, you know.
And men sort of like women's legs, so maybe that's it. 

I:   Are there any folks back here that tell kind of lies about, you know,
dogs and coons and things like that.   Are there any kind of funny tales?
I heard one fellow tell about a coon dog that was so small he'd run all the 
rabbits in the hole, and he let them out one at a time so his boss could
shoot 'em, put his big paw over the top of the hole.  Ever hear anything 
like that about a dog?

Woman:   No, no.     (Noise; seems like change of time or venue).
My daddy was the fox hunter, Alan, but Daddy's been dead. . .he died in
'78.

Man:   This dog here treed a coon once, the night the all-star game was
on t.v.

Woman:   In the yard.

Man:   I leave him outside, and I was watching the ball game. .

Woman:   Now this is a true tale.

Man:   . . .about eleven o'clock. . yeah, this is really the truth. . . I mean
I'm not telling no tale. . .I heared him a barking, and I went on to
bed.   I can tell the way he barks when a cow or dog's around, and he
has a different bark.   He won't let a dog come on this place.   And
I went to sleep and at two thirty I woke up and he was still a barking
and I got up in my pajamas and went out the door.   And it sounded like
he was round about on side of the mount.   And I opened the back door, 
and he wasn't out there, and I opened the front (?) door and he was
in the laurel morrow (?) bushes and I went over there and I found him.   I had 
a strange cat came in and got in there, and I moved that laurel bush 
and this big old coon stood up on his feet and raked (?) down at him
and he went across my front porch, and he caught him and it scared me
to death.   I run against my truck and see that coon, it wrapped around its neck
and split his leg from that end of that joint.  I went in there
and got my .38 pistol, and he was out in the little cherry bush.  My
wife got out there in the front yard and I emptied it and never even
touched the coon.  (Laughter.)   I already (?) told you that.
