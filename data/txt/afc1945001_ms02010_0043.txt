and that the repetition of rumors--even those based upon a fact

military information.

Direct Denial of Rumors
     The most significant contribution of a rumor-control
group lies in filling information gaps and in conducting educational
campaigns which help people think more clearly about the war,
rumors, and information. It sometimes becomes necessary to refute
specific rumors with specific information. The direct statement
and denial of rumors is, of course, dramatic--and often appeals to 
rumor-fighting groups as their first and major task. But the direct
denial of rumors, according to every study made by the Office
of War Information, involves many dangers, since it means giving 
publicity to the rumor in an attempt to eliminate it. Unless the 
rumor and its denial are presented with great care, much more harm
than good may result.
     The experience and surveys of the Office of War Information
