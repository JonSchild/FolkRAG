i got in contact with him
befor I left the Island
and told him [I was] all of
my Ideals about what I
were coming there for. so his word
was that he was glad to have
some one there to wake up the people.
His name is Mr Tommie Alexandra.
He drives the Negro school bus in
Coweata County which is Haralson
Georgia. Mr Alexandra and Mrs
Lildlie May Upsham and Bengiman
Adams were the three people
who help me get in touch with
others and the different places.
Haralson Georgia was where we
were located at. this is the name
of the places that i went into
to find the one I were looking
for. Senoia Georgia, Allerton Ga
Woodberry Ga, Mandchester
Ga, Neuman Ga, Franklen Ga,
Molin Ga, Hampton, Ga, Gay Ga,
On Friday afternoon March
25 we got together a group of peoples
that sing notes all of them came
from different towns they also
gather every Second sunday in June
at Gay Ga, the Sunday in Oct. at
Senioa Ga, and have what
they call a singing Sociation
they have never had a gathering
in Haralson Ga, so i arrange it so 
they can.
