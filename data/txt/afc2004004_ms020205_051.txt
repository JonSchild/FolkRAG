Reverend Roe- Reel 1- P. 5
A: Well, didn't that make you mad at your father?  Didn't you resent that?
R: No, sir, I didn't.
A: It looks like you would have.  
R: Well, it seems so, but he was my father and just whatever my father says was
just right.  However, I decided, I says I can't do no good at this.  I didn't
get mad at my father, and I loved him just as well as ever, but I left home.
[*Leaves home*]
I went to Oklahoma, I stopped in Passeo.  That was the time they was opening
up the strip and the people was running, you know, for that land, and there
was so many people in the city until they didn't have no place to sleep,
nor nothing to eat.  Lot of them just hongry there.  But I happened to be
able to do so many things--I could do just any kind of a work--I went to
digging wells and I made some money in Passeo.  When I left there, I left one
night--there was an old man wanted me to marry his daughter, and he said
that I had spoiled her.  And I just didn't want to marry that girl, and I
didn't think that was true, and then, I wasn't able to take care of a girl.
I left.
[*Kansas -- The Dalton boys*]
I stopped at Coffeysville, Kansas; it was in 18 and 92.  I was there when the
Dalton boys made the raid, I was there when they were all killed but one.  He
got the money and he got about a mile out of town.  But, looking down the hill
he could see the fight, and when his brother was shot off of his horse, he
turned around and came on down back.  And they broke his arm, shot him and
captured him and broke his arm.  I was there, and since I had been deputized
to help to guard the city I left there.
A: Why was that? Why did you leave? I don't quite understand.
R: Well, sir, that gave me a scare, that fight and I left there.
A: You saw the fight with your own eyes.
R: Oh, yes.
A: They made a song about that, didn't they?
