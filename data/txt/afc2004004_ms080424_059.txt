Ray:  Now this here is what they call 'snake head' herb, that we gathered
in the mountains when I was a little boy.  And this right here is what
they call wild lettuce.  That is a powdered herb, that powder that up.
And so now, right here, is sassafrass bark.  It's selected dried, it's
dried from the root in the ground, this is, and it sells for tea.  And if
I had a  branch off of the bush down here, now the leaves and (unint.) cures
your eyes, if you get anything in your eye, the leaves will heal it --
the teth(??) -- get the teth out of the branch and put it in cold water
and it'll make a slime, and you rub that in your eye and it'll heal it.
(tchncal) And right here now in my pocket is angelico, and it's a medicine
and I've chewed it ever since I was a boy, a gatherin' it.  Dry, it's
better dry.  And so this is in the herb land now, and I come along a gatherin'
these herbs.  And I learned that my body is just like the herbs, it's
got the root, means the same thing in the ground, and this sould is me,
and it's a soul and I  growed out of it and I'll go back to it.  And so this
seed right here now is the soul of this plant.  And if that seed was gone,
it would be dead.  But long as that seed of each kind of plant here that
don't mix with one another, it's not dead, that's the way God created
things.  That it lives on -- on and on -- til he sees fit to do away with
it.  We're not dead, we just go back to the earth to make fertilizer.
Everything does, these leaves. . . .(tech). . . .goes back to build the soil. . . .
of the fungus, where it hits to fit each plant of its kind, on this planet.
And so it's said, everything is (unint.) out of its own kind, and  good and 
very good!  Our Book does, the Holy Bible.  That everything of kind, of
(unint.) its own kind, and it was good and very good.  And so that's the
way I learned it in the forest and where I been at gatherin' these herbs.
That they is for the nourishment of our body, and to heal us when we're
sick.  Of mankind, and animals.  Now cows, and horses, they was created
