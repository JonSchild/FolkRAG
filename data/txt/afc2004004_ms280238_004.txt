Cox: I'm now goin' to try.
On the fourteenth of November from Yarmouth we set sail,
The wind bein' east north east my boys, with a sweet an' a
pleasant gale,
Until it did blow harder, the sea rolled mountains high,
And at night when we did shoot, my boys, how dismal looked the sky.

The morning when we hauled our anchor we let go
There's very few of fish, my boys, but sorrows you do know,
There's very few can tell what poor fishermen undergo,
All those who're on the salt seas when the stormy wynds do blow.

We bent our other anchor and by it we did ride,
Full four hours and more boys, strongly tied ([stormy tide])
Until my watch on deck, when they did so loudly call,
"There's a ship come down upon us, oh master," they did call.

To think she did go clear of us we all were very glad,
You must think and recollect, my boys, our case is very hard;
To think she did go clear of us how glad were all our lot,
For she came so very close to us our cable for to cut.

At least it was not all, [four] for our ropes on fire did get;
We did not lose for wants of them, we did not lose for it,
But into harbour [leagu] leaguered and on the slips did go,
And the next day put to sea again, hooraw, hooraw, my boys.
