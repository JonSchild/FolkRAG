Dear Alan:
I went over to see Barnicle this evening but, what 
with fixing up her converter, listening to Leadbelly's 
latest, and responding to the stories of a chap from 
Kentucky, and I didn't get very far with practical arrangements 
for dubbing her Ky material. I am certain, though, 
that this can be arranged efficiently enough, so that 
the price can be completely conventional. The only rub 
is that I honestly don't know what is conventional. If 
you are going to supply the blanks, all I shall have to 
have is sapphires, machine and time. it isn't exactly 
proper, but if you tell me what you usually pay, I can 
probably make the price less; or if you think that is 
unwise, the same.
As to pickups, there are definite promises of a dynamic 
within two months. I noticed today an ad for a German 
dynamic which I'm going to try to listen to. This other, 
the American model, which is not an imitation of the German, 
but an independent development, promises very well 
indeed.
As soon as I hear from you, I will write you at the Library. 
By then, too, I should have more data on pickups.
Next time you're in NYC, we will tell you about our farm, 
and take you there if you've time. It's a swell place 
for music and outlandish dances. Also, I'm getting along 
with the Trinidad records.
Sincerely yours,
Chick Ritter
