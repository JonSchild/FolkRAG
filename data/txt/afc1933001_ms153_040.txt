Dear Alan:

I cannot remember how long ago it was since last I
saw you. I did see your father last spring at the folklore
meeting in Houston. He told me you were at Columbia
University studying Anthropology and Music. I do not know
whether or not I wrote to you then. But in the back of my
head was always this notion to get in touch with you again.
Then here a few days ago after having passed my thirtieth
birthday in October, I found myself without any start in life
to speak of or any headway made in any direction to speak
of. Then I was sitting in the room of a girl from Arkansas
who had told me that the way her mother had met her father
was through having seen his image in the well the morning
he came to the house with her brother for the first time.
I began to think of folklore and how I had paid some attention
to it for some time. Often times I have been reminded of what
you once said when you and I were up at the centennial
and noted that my audience that time was almost entirely old
ladies. You remarked that if this was a representative
interest in folklore, you were not sure you wanted this kind
of an audience all your life. Then, as I was saying, lo and
behold, I hear your voice coming over the radio and I say
to the girl," that sounds like someone I know." I knew it was
you; but was absolutely certain it was when they announced
your name. I think the station was Roanoke Va. I am not
sure about this.

However, I am now like the Mexican who wrote the letter:
"Having neglected for some time to write you out of
courtesy, I now find myself compelled to write you upon
a matter of business." It occurred to me that I might get
into some branch of the radio business. And I have often
thought of trying to get into the pathway that television
will take when it takes its journey of development, so
that I might be swept along in the flood of advancement.
I think the radio is this pathway.

Since you are connected with the radio now, maybe you
could tell me a few things that will lead me to the
open door in this field. Does the library of Congress
give any special grants of facilities for collection of
such things as tales of Indians or Mexicans. That is to say
would they assist a person in any way towards getting together
a book or collection by if in no other way putting
