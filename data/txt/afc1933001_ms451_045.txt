Old Blue
[*1*]
I raised a day + his name was Blue,
And I bet cha fine dollars he's a good one 
too.
Saying " Come on, Blue,
Boo-hoo."
[*2*] 
Shouldered my axe + I tooted my horn, 
Gonna get me a possum in the new ground corn. 
Saying, "Come on, Blue, 
Boo-hoo." 
[*omit*] 
Got that possum up a 'simmon tree, 
Looked at the possum, possum growled at me.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, 
Boo-hoo." 
[*4*] 
That possum clumb down on a swingin' limb 
Blue barked at the possum, possum growled
at him. 
Saying, "Come on, Blue, 
Boo-hoo."
