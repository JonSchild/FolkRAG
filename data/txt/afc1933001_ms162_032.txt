Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
We have an inquiry for you to present a program of
folk music at Wilson Teachers College in Washington
for about an hour on Monday afternoon, November 18,
1940. The details are very vague but I first want
to know whether or not you would be available and
if so what you think would be an adequate fee for
your services. I assume from the letter that what
they probably want is for you to render the entire
performance yourself since there is no mention about
chorus or accompaniment of any kind. While awaiting
your reply I will write them to see if I can get
further details.
Cordially yours,
I S Becker
