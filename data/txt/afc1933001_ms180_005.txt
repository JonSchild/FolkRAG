Dear Ralph:

The only book I know that comes anywhere close to what you
ask is "Singing America" by Augustus Z. Zanzig.  C.C. Burchard,
Boston, 1940, 128 songs with arrangements, not all
folks songs, however, and some of them tampered with.

My last book which is, of course, not a pamphlet and which
is expensive, is, I feel, a pretty representative selection
of songs with only a few weak spots from the point of view
of general coverage.

Do you think it would be better to include accompaniments
or not?  Some people want them.  A proportion of 80 imported
songs as against 20 indigenous songs seems to me out of kilter.
Such a book should rather, I believe, emphasize derivative
material and include only examples of the inherited stuff.
Maybe I'm wrong but I'm going to take you at your
word and do something about the book this Spring.

Did you get a copy of my new Regional Bibliography of
American Folk Lore?  How did you like it?

It was swell to see you in North Carolina.

Best regards,

                                                                              Sincerely yours,


                                                                              Alan Lomax
                                                                              Assistant in Charge
                                                                              Archive of American Folk Song
