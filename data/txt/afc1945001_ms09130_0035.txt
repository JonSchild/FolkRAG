11A - Boy  White
1.  There is a rumer around that they will
start slicing bread again.
2.  An U.S. plane shot down 2 Jap
Ziros.  The plastic rudder was shot
off, the motor was shot up, yet
he glided to his base 100 miles away.
3.  It is said that in another year
bare feet well be the latest
thing out (because of shoe rationing)
4.  A lady went to market and got
as much meat as she wanted
in fact she got so much meat
she could not carry it. So she
asked the bucher to deliver the
meat.  The bucher said he could
not deliver the meat because she had
just bought his horse.
