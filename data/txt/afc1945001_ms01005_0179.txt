some circumstances be combatted directly by counteraction,
sometimes to be approached indirectly by a special campaign
of information about the armed services, and sometimes be
shut off by the more general "If it helps the Axis, don't 
say it" or "What is it worth to Hitler to have you say this?"
or "Goebbels pays money and spends time to have these things
broadcast to Americans, are you helping him?"

When state committees are set up, the Bureau of
Intelligence of the Office of War Information 
will cooperate in planning for rumor collection and analysis.
The development of specific counteraction would have to be
a local responsibility because of the importance of local
factors in the form in which rumors spread.  Where the OWI
is needed (or can be helpful), it will be.  Rumor studies
should head up to a state organization, with the possible
exception of a few major metropolitan areas, in order to
maintain some coherence in the programs of counteraction.
A large number of independent groups all scouting for the
prevailing rumors and developing their own programs of
counteraction would probably do more harm than good (and
far less than the good that could be accomplished by a
coordinated program).
