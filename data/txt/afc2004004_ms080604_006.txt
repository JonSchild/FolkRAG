a man with three mules in the front.  They called that their
"hook team".   And a lotta people called it their snap team.
When the wheeler get in the pit, you set there, and when the
wheeler comes to git in the pit, and they strap it down and
the two mules would pull it as far as they could.  Then you
hook in the bull tongue, on the wheeler with your three mules
and you pull it and they load it.   And they'd dress the levee
then with a ([front loader? -sounds like] "fresno"), you know
what I'm talking about (points to Bill Gordon) about as wide
as from here across (gesturing with arms), and had a rope on
it an' one man to stand behind it.   He supposed to be a levee
dresser.   He'd get down on his knees and he'd look to see the 
high places and the low places, and he'd get it (fresno'd?)
and he'd get it full, and he'd get to them low places and
he'd let it over and dump a little dirt in it for to get it
level.   And, at that time, they had protection levees on the
other side of the levee. They built that with wheelers.  And,
in 1923, we seed two drag lines, way through up there at
Miller's Bend, (unintelligable phrase).   Mr. E.H. Wynne, he
lived in Dayton, he filled that end with slips, something 
that one man get behind it and hold it and whenever you hit
a hard spot and throw 'em over there between the mules.  I 
wasn't but eleven years old, but I was drivin' slips. When
you git it full, you stand up on each handle for to keep the
points from gettin in the ground till you get up on the levee
where it was going.   And at that time, the levee wasn't two
thirds tall as it is now.  It wasn't two thirds tall as it is 
now.  The protection levee was nearly about as high as the
main levee.  He know what I'm talking about (points to Bill
Gordon).  They had seepage water come up on the opposite side
of the levee.  And they would build protection levees to hold 
the seepage water to keep it from going out in the people's 
fields.
A.L.:
Now tell us about how many men there would be
in a camp and who the different bosses were. . .
W.B.:
Well, now you take. . .In some camps they'd
have forty, some camps wouldn't have but thirty, some camps
they'd have twenty-five just depending up on how big the man
was.
Bill Gordon:
That's right.
W.B.:
They build their camps according to what size
that the man was, how much finance that he had, you know, and
how much equipment that he had.  Now, when I first went into
the levee camp, I wasn't but twelve years old. when I first
went into the levee camp. . .
