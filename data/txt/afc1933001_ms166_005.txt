Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is to thank you for your letter
of December 31, 1940.  I have read Herskowitz'
works, also Hurston's.  Somewhere I gathered
the idea that Hurston's works were inaccurate. 
I am unfamiliar with Dunham. 

I expect to go to Washington some time
wishing the next few months and will write you 

Thank you for your generous offer of 
aid and assistance. 

Sincerely yours, 

Thomas Larkin III
