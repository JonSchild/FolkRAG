MARCH OF THE TOILERS

Whirlwinds of danger are raging around
us,
O'erwhelming forces of darkness assail,
Still in the right, see advancing
before us,
Red flag of liberty that yet shall 
prevail!

Chorus:
The, forward, ye workers, freedom
awaits you,
O'er all the world on theland and
the sea,
On with the fight for the cause of
humanity,
March, march, ye toilers, and the
world shall be free.

Women and children in hunger are calling
Shall we be silent in their sorrow and
woe?
While in the fight see our brothers are
falling,
Up, then united and conquer the foe!

Chorus:
Off with the crown of the tyrants of favor,
Down in the dust with the prince and
the poor!
Strike off your chains, all ye brave
sons of labor,
Wake all humanity for victory is near.
