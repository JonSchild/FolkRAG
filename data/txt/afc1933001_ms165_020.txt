remember. The banjo player,
Bill Judge, is here, but
Frank Gallager, who is
gettin' on in years, isn't, so
there's no accordian, but
some other guy who plays
a[n acordion, or ?u] flute.

While Syd (my friend)
& I have been sitting here
drinking & eating the 
thickest ham sandwiches
served in New England & only
for 10â‚µ, we've been listening
to Bill and the flute player,
who are sitting across from
us at the end of the bar.
