[*BJ 1 FIRST MEMORY*]

see? I done weaned 'er. She jus' eatin'. An' I have milk --
you know, the cow milk -- plenty out there, cause the people we
work with, they have a milk cow, too, an' tha's...He jus' had all
we wanted there, you see. An' she feed 'im. She feed them. [They]
[rabbits] She think they rabbits. An' that's why she ran out 'cause
she meant they rats.

AL: But you don't know what else they were doin' with her besides...

BJ: No, no. Eatin the food. An' every day or two -- I mean all
the time after that she would talk about the rabbits. So an ol'
lady over town told me, said, "Get 'er away from there." See cause,
it'd worry her to death. Seem it'd get her mind [goin'] gone. She'd about
to get a snake charme[r]d. She would like to walk all down that field.
"Rabbit gone, rabbit gone, rabbit gone, Cassius kill the rabbit,
Cassius, gone..." Oh, God, that was turrible. An' I sent her to
Fitzgerald where they was a house full of chilrun, you know, over
there, to play with all the time. An' she stayed there with them
until she got 'em clear off her mind then. Otherwise, we moved
anyhow, you know. An' changed the houses. That thing was worrin' 
that chile to death. No tellin' how long she been tendin' to them
things there.

AL: Bessie, do you remember how you felt when you got weaned?
Were you upset about it?

BJ: Weaned the chilrun? Nursin'?

AL: When you were weaned, by your mother.

BJ: No-o. I don't remember a thing about it. I don't even
remember nothin' about bein' ? weaned.

AL: Before you were weaned, your mother was already workin'
away from the house?

BJ: That's right. Yeah, before that. I don't remember.

AL: When you were there all by yourself, was the door locked?

BJ: No. The do' wouldn't be locked, no.

AL: You'd really have to be lookin' after yourself that early?

BJ: Tha's right, tha's right.

AL: Even when you were crawling?

BJ: Even when I was crawlin'. They jus' leave things where
you can't get into. I did that to my child, too.

AL: When you do that with a baby, does it cry a lot?
