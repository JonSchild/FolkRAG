Dear Mr. Wetherall:

My opinion of your friend Mr. Darnell is not very
high. I suppose that manners of copyrighting sections have
to be like that. It's regretable. I particularly object
to his rather tight-fisted policy to John A. Lomax. All
of the songs recorded by the Golden Gate Boys and Leadbelly
were first collected and published by him and almost
all of them I taught to those singers. Let it be understood
that until a satisfactory agreement is reached between
John A. Lomax, my signature on these contracts does
not apply. I have advised Mr. Lomax to accept the offer
made him by Mr. Darnell provided that all twelve songs are
covered by the offer. It seems to me that the same terms
should apply to the library when the songs have already
been published in one of John A. Lomax's books.

I look forward to hear from you at a very early
date.

Very best regards,

Alan Lomax
