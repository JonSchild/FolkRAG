Dear Ted: 

Enclosed is copy of letter I sent today to the
American Philosophical Society.  I hope it helps.
I'm also returning the photocopies of your
application for your files.

I'd love to see this film as soon as possible, 
but don't hurry.  I can't possibly look at it 
until after the 4th of July.

All best, 

Alan Lomax
