Dear Rae,

The information on Shew Fly is very useful; I
am, however, most disappointed to discover that there
are no more Civil War words available, as I am
publishing it as a Civil War song. I don't
suppose you could find anything more, could you ?

About the Ballad Hunter. I did abit of
singing on this particular record myself, and the
gipsy woman's version of Whoopie-Ti-Yi-Yo is mine;
Woody also sang it on the same program. I think I
also performed Chisholm Trail, and possibly Trail 
to Mexico - though I'm not sure about this. Garmouth
is the knickname of a Mississippi prisoner. Doesn't
his voice descend to a very deep pitch ? If it does,
the song is called Joe the Grinder, and it is, I
believe, included in the album of work songs I
edited for L.C. I hope this will be helpful.

Yours sincerely,
Alan
