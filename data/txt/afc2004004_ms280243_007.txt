Lomax: You must have had some real adventures with him.
Davy: Oh yes. One time he went away with his father's horse and
cart. And old Bob Hutchinson had a house at Peterhead, way out
on the road to Aberdeen - it would be about five or six miles
out of Peterhead, near the sea. So we went away out there with
the cart and horse to hawk, and it was a very warm summer's day.
And he said, "We'll go up to the farmhouse and get a few eggs,
because the man of the house knows me." He knew the country
even if he was blind. "Turn up the first road, turn to the left,"
he said, "And mind the pony doesn't go into the ditch, or the
dishes will be broken." Because they were his father's dishes.
Be about three pounds of dishes, cups and saucers and bowls and 
plates and teapots. You know, stuff was cheaper then. /3 - that
was a good lot of dishes in those days. So, going up the road to
this farm, blind Robin was walking at the back of the float, and
I wasn't paying attention at all. I was chasing butterflies, and
the pony was wandering on his own. And all of a sudden, the pony
walked too far to the side of the road, and there was a big ditch,
and in goes one of the wheels and scattered all the dishes upon
the road. We broke about thirty bob's of dishes. So Blink Robin
says, "Terrible,/ he says, "What am I going to say to my father
when we go home?" I says, "Just tell the truth." But he said,
"You were along with me. You should have watched the house."
"Well, I couldn't watch the horse - I was chasing butterflies."
The pony went too far to the sixde of the road. So that night we
stayed at the afrm, and got a lot of stuff from there, scraps and 
some old rags and old bagging and sack stuff, a good load, and
stayed that night in the farm, and had supper, and the woman of
the house give me some sowans - that's the dust of the oatmeal
boiled with milk -- and it's very good. It's good for any person -
sowans. We call it supping sowans. And there was sugar with it
and cream, and it's very good. More like gruel, but it's thicker.
So we had that, and as we call it in Scotland, quarters of oat -
cakes, homemade ones. They're very big, with butter and eggs. And
we laid in the barn that night, and the farmer had put the horse
into a stable and given him some hay and stuff, and we got up
next morning and got back on the road back home to old Bob
Hutchinson. When we got home he gave us a telling off. So Blind
Robin and me got a few shillings together on the roam with
balloons and toys and we paid the old man back. But I remember
quite well it was just an accident on my part.
Lomax: When you went away as young as that, didn't you miss
your momma and poppa? Did you get homesick?
Davy: Well, once or twice. I always went back home to see the 
people, but I always liked to rove about myself. I didn't stay
much at home. Always liked to be away.
Lomax: From the age of eight?
