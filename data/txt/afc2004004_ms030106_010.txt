1640  A  (Cont.)
sound very much like a French name.  But my real name is 
Ferdinand La Monte. My mother also married one of the 
French settlers in New Orleans out of a French family,
being a contractor. My father was a brick contractor, 
brick layer, making large buildings, and so forth + on.
We always had some kind of musical instruments 
in the house [and] - including guitar, drums, piano, trombone, 
and so forth + so on, harmonicas and Jews harp. We had lots of them. 
And everybody always played for their pleasure, whatever the 
ones that desired to play. We always had ample time that was 
given us in periods to rehearse our lessons, which was 
given to anyone that was desirous [of] in accepting lessons.
But of course the families—the family—I mean, 
never had the idea that they wanted [a] musicians in the family 
to make their living. They always had it in their mind 
that  a musician was a tramp, other than the exceptions—with 
the exceptions of the French opera house players, which they 
always patronized. They only thought they was the great 
musicians in the country.  In fact, I myself was inspired by 
going to the French opera houses [myself] and because the fact of
 it was I liked to play piano, and the piano was known at that 
time to be an instrument for a lady. So I had it in my mind 
that if I played piano, I would be misunderstood.
