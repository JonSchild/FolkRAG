My dear Mr. Lomax: 
An old lady has given me many 
ballads and folk songs which she learned 
as a girl in Pennsylvania and New York. 
Non of them occur in American Ballads 
and songs as most are of English ancestry.
Would you be interested in seeing them 
anyway?
Can you give me any information about 
a "ball story" beginning: 
"When I was a little boy 
my value for to show 
I laid my head in my sister's lap, 
my feet I let hang down. 
I rippled over Peakeley (spelling?) 
And never touched the ground." ? 
Very truly yours, 
Kay Dealy
