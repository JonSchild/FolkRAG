Nov. 9.
Back at E. Colies to see E. George & his
sister Mrs. Daniels. She is calm & intellectual
compared to him. Has a large collection of
handwritten ballad sheets. They used to 
sing together on the road and says the
people were of the opinion that it was
the sweetest singing in the country. Now
it is years since they have sung and
their versions have drifted [t] apart. Mr. 
G. insists with some ferocity that his
recollection is the original - argument 
about the Moose Head Lake Song -
she remembers the words differently and
he says that her version is just a
"gaw-dam parody.
