Back in slavery one old time white man had something wrong
wid his legs, couldn't walk, had two slaves carry him every step
he go. One night these two boys ask him could they go to see
they girls that night and he told um to go on.
     
Well, they was some freepeople went fish-whacking the same 
night and they kilt plenty of fish.  On they way back home they 
come to the graveyard, laid their biggest catfish down at 
the gate, went on in and start dividing up the fish.  So , when those
two boys come home from courting their gals, they heard these 
two fellows in the graveyard, counting their fish, "Dis one
yourn; dat un mine.  Dis yourn; dat un mine..."
     
They run and tell their boss, "Massa, The Lord and the 
Devil out there in the graveyard, dividing up souls."
    
"Gwan, you better not fool me." So they tote him down 
there and listen at the gate and hear um say, "Dis un yourn, dat un mine...
Dis un yourn, dat un mine..."  So they when the finish counting, one 
fellow say, " Well, let's us get ready to go. And don't forget 
[these catfish] that big old catfish at the gate there."

Great God, old massa got over his sickness right there. 
He was home and in bed by the time his boys got there.
