5) A woman begins to speak
in tongues -
She repeats ...
I [?] an' he's riden (etc)
Her elbows, stiff to her
sides, tambourine in hand,
shaking
18B1) Song
B2) Testimonies
last testimony of woman
of the opposite side
B2) I'm Gonna Lift Up a
Standard for My King
Continues into dance,
one woman dancing or she
plays her guitar
This is the holy dance of the 154th
Psalms - a jigging step
