Mr. Maurice Roberts,
Crown Foto Features,
11 W. 42nd Street,
New York City.

Dear Mr. Roberts:

I have only one photograph of Hudie Ledbetter and do not feel that you would be particularly interested in it.

There are several other sources you might apply to :  Hudie Ledbetter, himself, who can be reached through Mary Elizabeth Barnicle, New York University, Washington Branch; MacMillan Company, which has the name of the official photographer who took number of fine shots of him; and March of Time, Inc., which as you know include him in onr of their news reels.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax

American Folk Songs
