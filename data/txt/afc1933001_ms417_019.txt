HERSCHEL PHILLIPS

Friend of mine told me how once he dropped
in on Herschel Philipps one day, and found him
and his family all singing away, and making music,
without a dam bite to eat in the house.

Right now, he can't be located.  The time he made
up most of his songs, though, was when he was in
jail for being an organizer of the hosiery strike
in Harriman, Tennessee, in 193-, and after that,
when he went down to the Highlander Folk School,
which is a trade union school down in Monteagle, Tennessee.
