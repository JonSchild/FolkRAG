Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am enclosing a copy of a memorandum which I am sending
to the Continuing Committee, which grew out of the Washington conference
on exchange of music between the Americas. I hope that you
will think the suggestions I have made in this memorandum are well
taken. 
It was so nice to see you last night. Mrs. Clark and I 
hope you will come up again soon for dinner and another evening of 
folk music. 

Cordially yours,
Evans Clark
