standing. I hope to liven
up all the "movements" to
which he refers so that
copies of the materials will
flow into us.

I wish to send a
letter to any State, Federal
and larger city prison system
in the United States, in search
for our indigeneous jail bird
songs. Would it be possible
to frank such a letter, the
materials to come in there
to you (where the letters would
be dated)? And could you have
the printing done for me?

Give my kindest regards
to all your forces who know; 
also remember Alan and me to
Mrs. Strunk.

Sincerely yours
John A. Lomax
