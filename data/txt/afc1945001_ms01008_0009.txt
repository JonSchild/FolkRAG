WAR INFORMATION AND MILITARY SECURITY
Now that our great expedition has successfully landed in northern Africa, now that our navy has brilliantly defeated still another attempt of the Japanese to dislodge us from the Solomon Islands, it is a good time to discuss the whole relationship of war information to the security of military operations.  A free people has a right to know just as much as possible about the progress of a war it is fighting.  The only limitation on that right is that in giving information to our own people, we should not also give information to the enemy which will endanger the lives of American soldiers and sailors, or perhaps endanger out prospect of victory.   No good citizen would disagree with that in principle; but when it comes to applying the principle there are disagreements, some of which can be removed by a wider understanding. 
Take an easy case first.  With our landing in Africa, a military secret was disclosed which had been kept for months.  Some people have called it a badly kept secret; but there is one sufficient proof that it was a well kept secret, and that is that the enemy was taken completely by surprise.  Not only did none of the axis air and land forces that were stationed only a few hours away from some of our landing points arrive in time to oppose the landing; but one great convoy of our troops traveled hundreds of miles, another traveled thousands of miles, without losing a ship or a man from enemy action.  Enemy submarines were numerous in the eastern Atlantic, yet not a single attack was made on our vessels there, and only one in the Mediterranean, before they reached their objective.  Ships were sunk by enemy submarines and by enemy planes after the landings had begun, but there were no attacks on the way.  In other words, many people knew, but nobody told. 
Now anyone can see the point in keeping secret an operation like that, before it has been accomplished.  There were times, both before the expedition started and in those last anxious days when it was on the way, when it looked as if it might have been betrayed accidentally.  Newspaper and radio comment has been filled with speculation, for months, about where an allied offensive might take place.  More than once, apparently by sheer contagion of idea, that speculation centered on northern Africa; notably it did so in the last few days before the expedition landed.  Such speculations, once they have been published here, are promptly reported to our enemies; and sometimes it seemed that the secret must have been betrayed, inadvertently, by men who would have talked about every other part of the earth rather than North Africa, if they had dreamed that that was what we were really aiming at.
