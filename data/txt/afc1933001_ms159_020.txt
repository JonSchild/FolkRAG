Dear Miss Porter:

The enclosed letter speaks for itself.
I think Mr. De Forrest is asking about the song
they sang at the hotel that night called "Cool
Water". Do you remember it? I thought it was
very lovely. Do you think we could find out anything
about it? I hate to bother you but I know
how interested you are.

Faithfully yours,

Archibald MacLeish
The Librarian of Congress
