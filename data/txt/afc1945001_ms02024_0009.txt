Rumors reported by one individual week 
of August 10-15, 1942, Atlanta, Georgia. 

Woman acquaintance said she heard of whole floors of office 
buildings in Atlanta being taken by government agencies and 
furnished with the most expensive furniture, only to be occupied 
for a few weeks when the agencies moved out and left 
everything there.  "There is certainly a lot of waste in the
war effort," she said.  

Same person reported that a daughter of someone she knew 
went to Washington as a clerk.  She was put in a room with 
dozens of other girls who were given nothing to do.  She 
finally asked if she could not be given some work to keep 
from being bored to death.  

Member of family was told by an acquaintance that she had 
been told by the sister of a soldier on maneuvers in North 
Carolina that her brother said the maneuvers had been called 
off; that he did not know why unless it was because they had 
lost so many men; that one man fell into a nest of rattlesnakes 
and died before he could be rescued. 

Was told by hairdresser that a customer had said that her 
husband said the British were not giving any help to Russia 
because they wanted Russia to be weakened so Russia would
not be a menace. [*2*]
