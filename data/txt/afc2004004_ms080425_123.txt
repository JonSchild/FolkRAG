Tape: #240 

My name is...        Lloyd Redding         an' I live here an' I was 
born and raised in this country, 'bout two miles out of...
down here. I worked at.....                for 25 years , retired, and now
I work here in this garden, raisin' fruit, tomatoes, vegetables, stuff
like that, and/just go to Sacred harp singin' and just have a ball.
...
Oh, yes, sir, I sing, I sing Sacred Harp. I was raised on it, like
it very much.
...          make you feel?
Makes me feel good down here. And I do this, I do this more or
less to have somethin' to do. I'm not able to work...
raise... what we eat.
