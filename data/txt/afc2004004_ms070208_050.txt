abject "Yassuh" - house. He gave me a new
ballad - Ollie Jackson - and hints of much
better stuff to come.
July [26] 27. Resolved to fix the damn machine. Sat
from 10 AM to 3 PM sweating over it. Finally
found the critical needle [ag] angle & the cuts became 
quiet.

July 28. Tuesday. Spent a fruitless morning
with 70 yr. old Alec Robinson - formerly coon
songster, gambler, drinker, badman - now deacon
In the Holiness Church - a neurotic & will-less
pitiful fellow with little music in him. His charge,
an old man of 83, whom he keeps from liquor
& women. sat nodding by.
Afternoon with Annie Williams, 83
of Friar's Pt., lively matriarch, midwife. She
& her friends gave me a few nice spirituals. A
group of children gave me charming game songs.
I took movies & records.

Evening. Interviewed Jaybird James
old time pianist. Some nice early jazz. Recorded some
very lovely contemporary spirituals from some
[?]0 yr. old girls who wanted to sing — “Blues in
the Night.” Home at 1:30 A?
