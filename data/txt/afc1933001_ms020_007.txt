My dear Miss Prink:

Mr. Edward Waters suggests that
you may be able to give me the present
address of Mr. John A. Lomax. My efforts
to reach Mr. Lomax at University Station
and at 2610 Whitis, Austin, Texas, have
been unsuccessful. If you can supply
a more recent address, I shall very much
appreciate your doing so.

Yours very sincerely

WOS a
