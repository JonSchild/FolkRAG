was in that garden. Hoo, I didn't know it 'till I got this book.
An' them diffrunt kind a herbs. Ah, Adam even asked God for a

good an' bad. 'Cause Satan was here, ya see. An' after he was 
send down here, why, he wanted to rule here. He wanted nobody

befo'. See befo' he had them wings an' he said he gonna lift
himself an' go on up in there, an' what he was gonna do, see?
