Some peoples loves whisky straight, some like a toddy,
" [Gal can I go home with] you Take me home, sweet mama, cause I ain't got
               nobody.

 My mama, my mama,
Didn't wear no drawers
I saw her pull[in] them off
She washed them in alcohol
Then she hang them up side the wall
They stink like alcohol
She gave them to Santa Claus
He said, "Uh-uh- I didn't want these funky drawers
Aunt Lucy said, "Sho is good & juicy
Uncle Ben said, "Sho is hairy."
