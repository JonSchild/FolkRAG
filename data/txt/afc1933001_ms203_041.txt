Dear Alan,
Through negligence or carelessness, I failed 
to mail my last letter to you. It's useless
to send it now, anyhow, it wasn't such a 
cheerful message, and I realize now that 
I have been extremely selfish in writing to 
you, for all I have ever said has been 
of my own unhappiness and troubles and 
problems. I should be more broad-minded
and think more of others. Now, 
I am trying.

When I recieved the "Southwest Review,"
which I knew that you had sent, I 
was ashamed that my lack of courtesy
had allowed me fail to mail my 
letter to you - it was more than lack 
of courtesy - forgetfulness as much; but
don't feel hurt - I didn't forget you - 
only I had so many things to ponder
over and worry about.
A lot has happened since you were 
here, and yet very little, fundamentally.
I have been ill - flu - & am almost 
alright now.
I have jabbered quite a lot & 
yet have failed to do the thing that 
prompted this - to thank you for the 
S. Review. I enjoyed your article so very
much - of course I read it first of all & 
was very absorbed & interested - 
Please write & excuse mistakes, 
Pauline
