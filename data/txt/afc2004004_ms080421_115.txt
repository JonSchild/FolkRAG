Ray:  . . .same time this one was.  And them songs run along in the
mountains. . .when he was runnin' this little grocery store. . . . . .
When I was about 5 years old, I killed a turkey right there, beggin
for a box of peanuts.  And mama whooped me!  And then give me a box
she whooped me. . . if she had just give it to start, she'd've saved
her turkey.  See, tucked me and give me a box, they come in a box
about that big for a nickel, 5¢, and you know, that was hard!  To
get a nickel!  They'd say "Mr. Hicks, I wished I lived back in the[m]
