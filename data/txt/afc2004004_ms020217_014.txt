BJ:    Oh, yes, Lawd.

AL:    Every day?
 
BJ:    Oh, no, no.

AL:    A good deal?

BJ:     They whip me when I need it.

AL:    What did she whip you about?

BJ:     Well, just different things I didn't do.  Anything I didn't do 
what she told me to do.  Not anything, but most times. Like, she'd 
leave somethin' for me to  do and I'd get to playin' and forget it.  
Ha, ha, and don't do it, as chulren will do, you know?  Like, some-time 
we go to the spring, and stay there like that, playin', and she 
call me; that's one thing she whup me about quick.  The last whippin' 
she give me was about that, callin' me.  I hates that too.  Call 
somebody and it looks like they hear me and they won't answer. I 
hates to call.  And so she call me and me and a little white boy pickin' 
us some peanuts. You know, how the hawgs they rootin' through the 
fields and pickin' up peanuts; and they dried, they sweet and good. 
An' me an' the little white boy pickin' us some peanuts out there, 
an' I would try an' get more than he would, an' he would try an' get 
more an' me; me and him were right there in the field.  I was 
raised up with the white chulren, you know, an' like that. And so 
he and I was a-tryin' to get ;em. An' she says shes a-callin' me; 
I never heard her; I never heard her call me.  so we come home; come 
along slowly eatin' them peanuts.  An' she said, "Come along in; I gonna 
whip you." [I say I didn't hear you]  You heard me callin'."  "I didn' 
hear you, hones' "Until today I know I didn't hear her call me.  But 
she [said,] whup me with a dry branch; you know, those yards -- right 
on-the-street yards -- and them ol', dry, gallberry switches, an' all 
the leaves got off, ha, ha, she went an' whipped me large.  You know, 
they whup you accordin' to your size.  They bring the switches up wit' 
ya'. You [geet] get so big 'till they can't hold the switches in the 
hand, then you too big to whip.  So, that ol' lady, she had a whole 
[basket] batch of switches.  Man, I though she goin kill me. Every time 
she whip I think I gonna die!  I just know I gonna die, you know?

'Cause I never liked no whippings. You see, when I was small, we 
wore a dress with a belt in it, you know?  The belt in it in here?
