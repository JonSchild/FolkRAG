Negro Spirituals
My Jesus lowered his mercy down,
my sins aren't a [lumberin'?] down to hell
Till i meet dem angels in da sky.
An a golden crown placed on-a my head,
An' a long white robe came a-dazzlin' down.
Now wait till I put on my
gospel shoes,
Gwine to walk around Heaven
an' the news
When I gets to Heaven, gwine to take my cakes
Gwine to rassle with my Lord
a natural man.
Two milk white horses side by side,
Me and my Jesus gwine take an [??????'] ride
I argued with the Father and chattered 
wit de Son,
Talked about the old world I done
come from.
