Lomax: Tell me, when you were living at Peterhead, did you live
in a house or did you live in a camp?
Davy: In a house. Just a house you get for six or seven shillings
a week rent -- a month I mean. When I was young the rents was very
cheap. A month's rent - about six bob.
Lomax: And how many rooms?
Davy: Two.
Lomax: Two! There were about ten of you in two rooms? Did you
have regular beds or did you just have a shakedown on the floor?
Davy: We had a bed all right.
Lomax: But lots of people in the bed.
Davy: Well, say mother and two children and the father. Some of 
the girls would be in the other room. Maybe there'd be no bed for
the boys but chaff on the floor. But they're all very happy.
Lomax: What would you have to eat?
Davy: Mother mostly made a pot of potatoes - what we call a pot of
tatties, and maybe a pot of porridge and milk - good feeding. Better
than some of the food nowadays. We was brought up the hard way. Good
old stuff.
Lomax: When you were a young fellow and got into mischief, who did
the disciplining of you?
Davy: My father mostly. Not so much my mother. The mother would
take our part, and my father was a very hard man sometimes - but
all for our own good. I mind - I was  a wee boy, twelve or 13 years
of age, and he put me to the shops for some tobacco, and we was
camping, you know - we were away for a fortnight from Aberdeen
camping. And he was a big man, about six feet two, sixteen or 17
stone weight. And he put me away to the shop for tobacco - and that
dat you could get an ounce of tobacco for sevenpence ha'penny.
And he gave me half a crown - that's a lot of money at that time. I
bought a pennyworth of sweets, some candy rock, and spent about a 
shilling of his money. So me being young and foolish, coming on the
road home with about two miles to walk, I was playing about, looking
for bird's nests on the road side, and, as young boys do, chasing a 
wee rabbit now and again. And I lost all the money. But I still
had the tobacco in my pocket. When I went home he was away hawking
that day. When he come home that night, I got it from him before
he went to bed. He took off his belt. I tell you I got it. I
remember that day. But still, I'm none the worse today because it
gave me a wee bit of sense not to blaggard and commence spending
the few coppers we had in them days. Half a crown was a lot of money
when I was a boy.
