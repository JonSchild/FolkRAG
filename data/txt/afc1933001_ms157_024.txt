Dear Mrs. Rossell:
        I'll let you know about the water front business
as soon as my publicity agent has gone over the angles 
and ripples.
        I will sing with my own poor guitar accompaniment.
The talk doesn't really matter, because I always
say the same thing, whatever I call it. I have called 
Mr. Berkeley. I have communicated by radiogram with 
Miss Waller.
      I will communicate with you as soon as I reach
the suburbs of Cincinatti.
                                              Very best regards,
