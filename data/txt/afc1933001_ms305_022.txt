Embargo

A not altogether solemn dissertation on this important
subject by the noted critic and philosopher.

Kenneth Burke

I OFFER this statement as a
Europologist (with overtones like
those in "Egyptologist"), who was
born in a slightly disobedient, but 
on the whole obedient, province of
the British financial empire; an empire
caught in the dialectics of imperialism;
a dialectics whereby a
country that subjugates a foreign
market becomes subject to the needs
of that market - in so gearing its
home production that any dislocation
of the foreign economy invades the
home economy.

Hence, periodically, the province
in which I was born is called upon
to fight in behalf of the dialectical
problem inherent in imperialism.
And we fight, because we understand 
it; and we understand it because we
are understudies of it - involved, to
a lesser degree, in the same damned 
problem.

The only choice I see between the
aging British Empire and the young
Nazi Empire is that the British one
is older. Hence, a bit less raw. So
we'll have to help it somewhat, on
a lesser evil basis. For when it
topples, it will pull down with it as
much of the planet as it can. And it
can a lot.

So, it would be best to help the
British Empire to retain its booty.
But to give this help inefficiently. Put
encumbrances in the way, like the
arms embargo. But not too many encumbrances,
as were we to embargo
all materials used in the making of
arms.

Purpose of such "moderation": to
give enough help for weakening Hitler,
but not enough help to make
Britain strongly victorious. If
strongly victorious, they'd either give
us another Versailles, or set up a
Chamberlain outfit in Berlin, or both.

It is my guess that, whether by
necessity or intention, Russia will
carry out a similar program of "moderation"
with respect to the Nazis.
That is: the Nazis will get enough
help from Russia to prevent a big
British victory, but they will not get
enough to attain a big Nazi victory.
It is also my guess that, if the Nazis
did show signs of a big victory,
you'd find Russia helping Britain.

Those who say that Russia has 
gone in for "power politics" seem
to mean, when the bologniac is
squeezed out of their epithets: Russia
is in the situation that Britain
has always been in, with relation to
balance of power. Russia is candlestick
on a balance-of-power seesaw. 
Russia can't allow either Britain or
the Nazis to be either too strong or
too weak. If one side gets too weak,
it must be helped. If it gets too
strong, the other side must be
helped. The situation is especially
touchy in Russia's case, however,
because of something like this:
When, as, and if the war got
going, and had gone on for a year
or so, suppose that the Nazis seemed
slated for a big victory; it would then
be to Russia's interest to fight on the
side of Britain. But how start fighting
on the side of Britain, without 
the likelihood that the British and
French would promptly begin standing
still, and let Russia and the Nazis
cancel off each other? (If this were
not so sadly imperfect a world, we'd
now see a three-cornered war, or
maybe even a five or six-cornered
war. But the dialectical pressure of
military drama keeps forever forcing 
it into the over-simplification of two
groups of antagonists, with the result
that the alignment of factions can
never quite crystallize, and the symmetry
of alignment is continually
threatening to fall apart. The British
Empire alone has enough internal 
contradictions for its own foot to be
kicking its own rump.)

All told then: "moderation." And
as part of this: "Cash and carry."
But without the delicate little loopholes
that make it too easy for the 
Anglophiles to extend the definition
of "cash," first to ninety-day credit,
and then gradually to indefinite
credit. (No matter how many loopholes 
you plug, they'll get around
them, but each plug makes the getting-
around less efficient, more encumbered.)
Cash and carry - plus
arms embargo - plus imperfectly
plugged loopholes.

Don't get the idea, however, that
a "cash and carry" policy, even if 
carried out, would keep us from footing

the bill. It is our function, as a
province, to foot the bill - and we
will.

For one thing, we'll so gear our
productive plant to the war's markets
that we are subject to them, cash or
no cash.

For another thing, we can pile up
all the gold in the world, like savages
(my apologies to savages: I
never heard of savages so idiotic) -
and then, when the war is over, the
gold myth will simply be abolished.
The British will decree any new basis
of currency they prefer, and we'll
obey the decree.

So, again, we'll be left holding the
bag. No unredeemable paper this
time, but material. The Mammoth
Cave will be stuffed solid with debunked
gold.

The new currency will be something
that Britain has a lot of. I hear
that British scientists are now working
on a plan for compressing bricks
of London fog. And that the world
henceforth will go on the Fog Standard.

But we should insist upon a just
peace! Just like last time. (Did I
hear somebody cry "Wolf"?)

P.S. There is one other way in
which we will foot the bill. Long
after the war is over, and the days
of Neo-Two-Dollar-Wheat are over,
there'll be the Bigger and Better Dust
Bowl. There'll be the ghastly increase
in the rate at which the fertility of
our soil is carried off by erosion.
Long after the human blood has
ceased to flow in the protection of the
British Empire's booty, the blood of
our soil will go on leaching, being
sucked out by leeches. Who said ideas
were weak? Why! - a few bad ideas
on the nature of human purpose have
proved strong enough to rip and tear
and squander a continent, to throw
its richness down the sewer, while
millions skimp. They skimp while the
richness is still being thrown down
the sewer. They skimp while we are
getting "progress" and "prosperity"
by spending our principal. What will
be left for them to do if and when 
they would belatedly throw down
these ways of throwing-down?
