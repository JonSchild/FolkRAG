BJ TAPE 3, p. 37

some folks don't think one sin no greater than the other, but it
is.
AL:     And what other ones are the major sins?
[*(GAMBLING)*]
BJ:      Oh, gamblin', ya know.
AL:     Gamblin'.
BJ:      Yeah, gamblin' is [another] a nasty thing.  'Cause gamblin's
ah, if you , if the devil will get in you in that way enough to
make you want to gamble your [own] own labor away, what will you do
wit' mine?   Ya see? So that's [a] the gambler right next to the
robber, ya know?   An', an' then he right next to the rogue an'
the money-stealer.   He jus', he jus' it, tha's all.   An' he up
next to it 'cause he get without money, he, he, he, he'll wanna
take some, too.   He'll take from his own household.
[*(RAPE)*]
AL:     What about a rapist?
BJ:      Ah, ah, huh?
AL:     Somebody that rapes...?
BJ:      Oh, ravishin' people?   That's a dog spirit, of course.   You know,
that's just [all] aw- -- I don't know what I think that's awful, that's 
jus' a terrible sin, of co'se.   That's a mean sin, 'cause the
Lawd said for every man an' every woman to have her own husband,
ya see?   An' an' if you, if you can't get you a husban', I
know you can get a concubine.   Somebody.   See?   If you had to get
her older than you or younger than you, you can get one.   If you
got to.   Then He says again, says, "Better to marry than to burn."
So it's just a mean idea, lustin' so much so that you wanta
destroy a person's body.   I think it's awful, you know, jus' a
nasty mind.   An' that can go for woman an' man, you know.
