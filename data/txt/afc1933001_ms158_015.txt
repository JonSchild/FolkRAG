And as to the degree of improvisation need to make a
spiritual really a spiritual, I don't know where that
line is drawn. Does a spiritual cease to be a spiritual
when it is memorized, and sung more or less uniformly?

And how the hell did they succeed in that play Mamba's
Daughters in keeping the effect of improvisation?
That I guess is what I want to hear. Is it too much
to ask of them nowadays? Or how would you go about
asking it?

Can you recommend sources of simply written spirituals?
Or can't you recommend anything written down?
Are there records that I could us for demonstration?

The subject is further confused for me by a conviction
that improvisation, even with the best of musicians,
varies greatly in its musical worth. What can I recommend to them
to do, that won't depend too much on a precarious
momentary inspiration?

Or maybe I better just give up the whole idea and talk about
Palestrina or Hitler?  As Always -
