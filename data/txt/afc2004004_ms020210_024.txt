Dear Beulah Wing:

A week ago I sent you a letter about royalties on the film
your brother, John Davis, made.

After I sent it I realized that perhaps Peter Davis, who was
a member of the Group ought more justly to be the recipient
of John's share of the film royalties. I wonder whether you
agree?

You must remember that the money will not be very much, but
it would help Peter who is old and would make him feel happy

I take this opportunity to wish you A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
