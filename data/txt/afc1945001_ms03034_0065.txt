                                  Dear Sir:

                                             Attached herewith is a careful analysis of the rumors 
                                  current throughout the United States during the month of 
                                  September. These rumors represent a challenge to those 
                                  public officials who are directly concerned with the 
                                  state of national morale.

                                             This report has been compiled by the Division of Propaganda 
                                  Research of the Massachusetts Committee on Public 
                                  Safety and made available to you in the hope that it may 
                                  give you an insight into some of the serious sources of 
                                  danger to national unity.

                                                                                                      Yours very truly,

                                                                                                       R.H. Knapp.
