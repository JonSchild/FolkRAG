"Had you ever thought of the possibility of all the governments just 
wiping the slates clean after this war and starting all over again? 
Every country is going to be so far in debt they can never get out. 
They may just wipe off all the bills and start a totally new financial 
structure when this is over. I hear we are in about two-hundred 
billion. That's more money than we have spent before in all the history 
of the country. We can't hope to get it back from the other 
countries, because they won't have it. The only way we will ever 
balance the books is just to throw them away and start over again."
