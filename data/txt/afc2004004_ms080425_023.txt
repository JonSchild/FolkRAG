life of a man, which is Christ.  If you ain't got Christ, 
you ain't got life.  You might not understand that, but that's 
the truth.  I'm no preacher, but that's it.  So, I thank 
you boys, thank you very much.   . . . . . . .  You all done 
a good job, looks like.

AL:  You'll get to see some, if you stay awhile.

Wooten:  I'm not going to get to be here tomorrow.  My wife's 
family, her. . . it's her decoration day.  They just buried 
her mother and daddy and so forth.

Silence, 1-2 minutes.  Then chatter, people talking about 
#166, practice the song a bit.

AL:  We got this filmed a way no one will ever forget.  
This man. . . you're just made for a camera, I don't know, isn't 
that right?  Now, what's your name?

Man:  [Core] Coy Ivey, [Hinecker] Heniken, Alabama.

AL:  I hope you're going to hang in with us for the 
Wooten sing, we're going to have a Wooten sing.  You're 
kin to the Wootens?

Ivey:  Yeah, I'm one of that bunch, one of the Wooten bunch.

AL:  I never saw anybody enjoy singing as much has you do.

Ivey:  I love it.  I been singing all my life.

Man:  He decided a long time ago he couldn't beat them, so 
he just joined them. (repeated) That's what you have to 
do.  You can't beat them, you just have to join them.
