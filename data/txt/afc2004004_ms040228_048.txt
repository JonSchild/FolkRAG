THE GREEN MOSSY BANKS OF THE LEA.
H. Such, Printer, 123, Union Street, Boro' - S.E.

When first in this country a stranger,
Curiosity caused me to roam, 
Over Europe I resolv'd to be a ranger,
When I left Philadelphia my home.
We quickly sail'd over to England,
Where forms of great beauty do shine, 
Till at length I beheld a fair damsel,
And I wish'd in my heart she was mine.

One morning I careless did ramble,
Where the pure winds soft breezes do blow,
It was down by a clear crystal river.
Where the sweet purling waters doth flow,
'Twas there I espied a fair creature,
Some goodness appearing to be,
As she rose from the reeds by the water
On the green mossy Banks of the Lea.

I stept up and wish'd her good morning,
When her fair cheeks did blush like a rose
Said I, the green meadows are charming,
Your guardian I'll be if you choose.
She said, sir, I ne'er want a guardian, 
Young man you are stranger to me,
And yonder my father is coming,
O'er the green mossy Banks of the Lea.

I waited till up came her father
And plucked up my spirits once more,
I said, If this is your fair daughter,
That beautiful girl I adore,
Ten thousand a year is my fortune,
And a lady your daughter shall be,
She shall ride with her Chariot and Horses,
O'er the green mossy Banks of the Lea.

Then they welcomed me home to their cottage
Soon after in wedlock to join,
And there I erected a castle,
In grandeur and splendor to shine, 
And now the American stranger,
All pleasure and pastime can see,
With adorable gentle Matilda,
On the green mossy Banks of the Lea.
