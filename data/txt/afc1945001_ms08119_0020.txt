RUMORS- In school I heard from a student
that [if] a boy, who at the end of this semester
[and] is 17 or 18 years of age, [he] could
graduate school in June.  I also heard
school will be out [at] in May instead
of at the end of June, because of the
farm labor shortage.  It is said boys 16-18
[I] will be drafted during the summer
for farm work.
