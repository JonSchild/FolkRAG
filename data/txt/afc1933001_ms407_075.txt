Adventures-Chicago                 3


      I leave to Lloyd Lewis, then, as now, a star reporter on Chicago's best newspapers, 
to interpret this quartet's reactions on me. Lloyd Lewis has become nationally known through
his life of General W.T. Sherman. He will do other historical masterpieces, granted only that
he has time from earning a living. Lloyd has written any thought of publication
a flattering summary of what I did as an avocation during the two years I was submerged
in the financial vortex of Chicago, helping to keep alive my interest in folk stuff. In fact [?] this time I put together and sent to the publisher[r] as an overflow book from Cowboy Songs, another
smaller volume, Songs of the Cow Camp and Cattle Trail, which has sold sluggishly, though
steadily, through the years.
      Too personal, yes, but at the same time at least a fine tribute to the validity and appeal
of cowboy music: (in the following letter from Lloyd Lewis)
      "It was a Sunday afternoon, the year I suppose about 1920 (it was soon after you
came to Chicago to work for Lee, Higginson & Co.) that Tom Peete Cross brought over to our
apartment at 5220 Dorchester Avenue the Texas folk-lorer he had so often talked about. I 
was curious, for you had but lately gained fame in academic circles at least, by defying
Pa Ferguson on the matter of academic freedom, and were said to have recommended to
Lee, Higginson by Teddy Roosevelt. Then, too, I was curious about your songs, for Tom Cross
and I, in our elaborately untrained voices, amused ourselves with folk songs. He knew more
than I, being a Southerner, but in Indiana on the farm where I grew up, we had had North
Carolina uplanders as farm hands and they had sung many ballads, most of them Westerns, 
"Jesse James, "Poor Dying Cowboy", etc., etc. And I had been in Northwest Colorado a summer
or two at the time and learned a lot of cowboy songs form the sheep-herders and wild horse
wranglers.
         "Anyway, Tom and I got you to singing right off, almost as soon as you got inside
the door, and my mother, who was a Quakeress, and my sister, all sat listening. You were pretty
timid about it, but evidently you saw we meant it when we said we wanted more, and that we
weren't being polite.
