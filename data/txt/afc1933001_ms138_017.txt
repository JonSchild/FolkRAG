Dear Dr. Spivacke:
I am amazed about Mr. Lange.  Mrs. Concha Romero 
James at the Pan American Union was one of those who told me
about Mr. Lange's collection.  She seemed pretty sure about 
it and as much asked me not to come bothering her on the 
subject of recordings until I  knew those of Mr. Lange as he
was supposed to be the main source, the chief, and practically 
the only. 
If you are interested in following it up at all
I'd appreciate it if you'd call the lady and ask her what the 
blazes....
Thank you for letting me know about the matter. 
I shall probably be in Washington soon though I don't know
exactly when as yet.  Shall call you when I arrive. 
Sincerely 
Elizabeth Meyer
