Mr. H. M. Belden
811 Virginia Avenue
Columbia, Missouri

Dear Mr. Belden:

    The Archive of American Folk Song is sending 
me to Indiana in April to make recordings of Indiana 
folk songs, and I wonder if you have any suggestions 
to offer in regard to interested individuals,
interesting regions or possible informants in Indiana
or the nearby Mid-West.

    It makes relatively little difference, I
think, whether the records I make are of songs that
have already been published or that will be published,
since, in the first case, it is important that there
be exact versions, and in the second case, the library
will restrict the material so collected until its discoverer 
has an opportunity to publish.

    I can't be positive whether or not I have
met you at any Meeting of the Modern Language Association 
I have attended, but I have heard my father
speak of you many times. Is it possible that you will
attend the meeting of the Hoosier Folk-Lore Society in
Bloomington in April? If not, I should greatly appreciate 
a letter from you with any suggestions you have
to make in regard to this recording trip.

    Sincerely yours,
 
    Alan Lomax
