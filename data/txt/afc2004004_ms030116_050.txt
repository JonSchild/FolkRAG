preachers, but jes a man.
Mrs. D:  Well the Methodists h as women preachers --
Rev. D:  (passionately, h u rt)  There's one thing I wish t o God our women
wouldn't never git so thick-headed, so mule-headed that they think so.
There've been women preachers all right.  Preach g ood all right enough.  The
thing I keep a-tellin yall folks, I don't care if nobody don't never believe
it, there'll come a time that a woman -- you know it's the truth, Mr. John,
you ain't no fool -- there come a time wh en your wife ain't got no
business in the kitchen -- where you is.  Much less no where else.  Now you
can believe it or not.  I come close enough to let you know this:  Mary stayed hid out of sight of
women eight days to set wom en an example.  Yall can take it any way you want
to.
Johnny:  Course it was a woman -- in the Garden of Eden --
Rev. D:  Is was what?
Johnny:  It was a woman in the Garden of Eden.  She was the fi rst one that wa s
tempted.
Mrs. D:  Thass right.
Rev. D:  That wadn't the cause she doin th at.  If that was the cause that wadn't
the main cause.  At this particular time she wadn't fit to be seen.
JohnnY:  Yes.  That's right.
Eliz:  Is that because she wasn't full of grace yet, Rev. D?
Rev. D:  Now Miss Lizybeth, you ain't no crazy woman.
(I'm so innocent of the Bible -- to my own salvation -- that John ny has t o
give me a crude punch and whisper an explanation th at Eve was menstruating.)
JohnnY:  No.  She jes wasn't clear on that point.
Eliz:  No.  I didn't know that.
Rev. D:  You ain't no crazy woman.  I don't have to g o to close wid you bout th at
Eliz:  Is that why the serpent could tempt her?
Rev. D:  I said there's certain times you ain't got no business wid people.
Mrs. D:  That's right.
