Dear Professor Rickard:

I am terribly sorry that it has taken so long to arrange
for the duplication of the records made by Mr. Lomax. Our
folk song archive has been in a state of complete reorganization
for some time and you can well imagine that our routine
has been almost completely disrupted. I shall push this matter
immediately, however, and hope to get the records to you
in short order.

We are not yet equipped to sell duplicates of records to
individuals but have in the past made special arrangements
with commercial recorders in town. After you get your duplicates,
if you will let me know the records of which you want
other duplicates, I shall be glad to get a quotation for you.

Very truly yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
