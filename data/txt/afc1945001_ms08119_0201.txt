Dolores Hermann                       [*A*]
March 12, 1943.

Just recently we have had a visitor from
the armed forces. He came from a camp in Texas.
He said he had to pay for everything he wanted
including stationery at a U.S.O. Center. He said
they had to pay for coffee and sandwhiches. They
had to pay a certain amount of money to get in
on the games, no matter what they were.
