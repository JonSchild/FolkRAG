TL: Put the riddle down even if you won't give me the answer.
BJ: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ah, what is this: Ah, "The man that
made it, he didn't want it; the man that bought it didn't need
it; the man that used it didn't know it"....That's easy That's easy to think
of that now. The man that made, he didn't want it. An' the man
that bought it, he didn't it. But the man that used it, he didn't
know it...That's a c-- a casket.
TL: A what?

nasty, but there ain't nothin' to it. Ha, ha! That's a hawg
rootin' in the ground...See! An' his two ears floppin' an' nose goin'
in the ground. Ya see? That's just as common as anything ya
