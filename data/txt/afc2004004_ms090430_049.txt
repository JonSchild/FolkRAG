tenants on general grounds of dissatisfaction with their work, and have
selected as tenants a group whose last crops elsewhere had been of a superior
quality. There has been considerable substitution of white for Negro sharecroppers
as times have become harder for white tenants.

In such an area a farmer may risk another type of work when unable
to get back on a farm. The emergency programs of the Government have provided
some with substitute employment. Others have managed to struggle along
on odd jobs.

[*[*] The rapid increase in the number of farm laborers in this area is
significant. This form of employment offers to these tenants uncertain incomes
for a season of the year, and places the responsibility of their maintenance
upon the tenants themselves rather than upon the landlord. Instead
of receiving a monthly "furnishing" allowance, the laborer receives a small
daily wage of $.75 for the days he works. Weather conditions and seasonal
demands for labor, thus, as well as cotton and credit prices, become important
factors in determining the total income of these farms workers.[*]*]

*[*The Negro Family

These following observations are based upon a study of rural Negro families
in Madison County, of whom 115 were tenants and 86 were owners. There is a
wide range of types of homes, but few approach the standards of more advanced
rural communities in the South. For the most part these homes are simple
frame, board or log structures of two or three rooms. The fixed uniformity
of the rude dwellings must of necessity ignore family size and, as a result,
any number of persons may be found in tenant houses. The available land for
cultivation is usually the major consideration. Families adapt themselves to
the housing accommodations provided with the land. [*]*]
