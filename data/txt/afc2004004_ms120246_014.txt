mother, his granmother, his granfather
when you go into mourning 18 months for 
mothers, 12 m. for fathers, 18 m for godmother,
12 m for godfather - afterwards you hang
[*on Sunday & Friday
mornings
only you
wear m.
to church*]
the clothes in the cross of B Samedi or 
in the woods - the poor come & get them
& you're through - before you put them
on you make a libera for toute morts
on Sunday evening - Monday you go to 
the church & pay the p√®re 2 goudin to 
make a mass for the dead - 

The marassa have their power because they can
speak directly to God - they are more powerful
than all the loi - plus dure - if you eat an orange
in the company of a marassa & don't give 
him anything to eat, even if he doesn't 
ask anything, he'll kill you - he'll
kill his own mother & father -
