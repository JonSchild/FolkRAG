The bleed cam' pourin' this my hose,
The bleed cam' pourin' down sir, -
But I seemed my gun among my foes
And then sat down and sang, sir

The doctor cam' and dressed my wounds.
And swore that I was lame, sir,
But I got hand o' two shovel shafts,
And I cam' hoplin' home. sir.

Noo a' the troubles I've come through
I scarcely need to mention,
For now I am in Fortashire
And livin' on my pension
