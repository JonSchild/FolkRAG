Mr. W.C. Garwick
12 Sterling Avenue,
Mamaroneck, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Garwick:

       I very much appreciate your two letters,
describing in detail the new recording machine which 
you propose to sell to Mr. Engel for me to use. I 
am writing to Mr. Engel. Of course, I hope to have
the very best machine available; but my chance to 
secure your machine must come through him. I can not,
myself, afford the expense.

         I, too, hope that we can get together
some time soon so that you can make a record of a
couple of my cowboy songs, along with the yodels.
      I hope you will let me hear from you again.

                   Very truly yours,
                                   John A. Lomax
