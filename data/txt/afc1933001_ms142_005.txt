2 (Mrs. Tartt)

Did you ever publish any of the songs you collected whil here? If you did, do bring them along. I'm so anxious to see them in print. The negroes will be so delighted to see you all again, they still ask about you. Doc and Jessie Alison have moved some nearer, at least within civil lization, and it will be easier getting them together. I have four that sing so well and all know the same songs, including Samson and De Lilac. Dr [Botkin?] liked it very much; he had lunch with me out of doors, and suggested sending me a machine, - that was back about Christmas; not a word from him and no machine.

Do please excuse this horrid scrawl; I have one dozen pen and ink illustrations to get off at once, so am racing with the train. Just want you to know before the sun goes down that it will be "daybreak" for me when you all get here.

Devotedly, Ruby P.T.

P.S. there are three churches out in Doc's neighborhood. We can take the singers to any one of these having services while you are here; however, the best singing preacher is only hre on first Sunday. R.P.T.

P.S. I wonder if you can send me a list right away of the songs recorded here. In this way I can check for new ones gathered since then. It will save lots of time and be much easier for you to go right oon with the work when you arrive. I have kept no copies since you left, have no room for them, but I do have titles and can locate singers and words before you come. Did you get "Jesus goin' make up my dyin' bed", and "Oh, death is awful etc."? R.P.T.
