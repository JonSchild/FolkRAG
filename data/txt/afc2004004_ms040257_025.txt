Mary Gillies

My mother was 91 when she died and she was a hard-working woman. 
Sheused to weave the cloth and weave the blankets - make 
tartans and lovely quilts. She used to get the dye 
from the ground herself. She went out and picked it and 
brought it in and then scraped it and cleaned it and put 
it in a pot on the fire for many hours.

LOMAX: Tell me about this dye that she did â€” the different 
colours.

Well, She had clover

LOMAX: What did she get

She got the colour from the ground and made lovely quilts. 
I have still got some blankets that she made. 
And she got iris for putting it in socks. 
First she carded the wool and then dried it and spinning it 
and weaving it but I was just young at the time and I had 
no much interest in her work. But I was there and looking 
at her and taking it in and looking at what she was doing 
and I think I could manage to do a little yet.

L What kind of a woman was she, Mary?

She was a nice looking woman a lovely singer and I have 
still [*?*] some of her songs and the only thing I am sorry for 
is that I didn't learn then better than I did.
