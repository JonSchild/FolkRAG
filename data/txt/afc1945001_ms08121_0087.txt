 A           Rumors
                              Rumors are nothing
but malicious gossip that
one person thinks he or
she heard and gets it
mixed up and tells the
wrong things to different
people. The rumors you
hear are most likely not
to be the truth, put them
aside and don't listen
to anything that isn't
the truth.
          There was a rumor
that clothes are going to
be rationed very soon,
but don't pay any
attention to what you
hear unless it is on the
radio or you read it
in the newspaper. Another
rumor was "Is Hitler
Dead or Alive," well we
don't know for sure so
