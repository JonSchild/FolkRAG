Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was delighted to receive your letter in which you expressed
your willingness to take part in our luncheon program
in Chicago on November 22, if the Fates take you near the
WIndy City at that time. I have been requested to send in the
names of those appearing on the program, since The English
Journal wishes to print an advanced copy of the program in the
September issue. Consequently, I did not include your name in
this program. The final copy for the official program should
be ready early in October. I shall write you at that time in
the hope that you may know definitely whether you can meet with
us. In any event, we shall want you to attend our luncheon program
and to take part in the program even though you appear at
the eleventh hour and even though our program may seem to be
filled in advance.

Dr. E. C. Beck, professor of English in Central State
Teachers College, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, is going to talk
about ballads of the lumber camp and ranch. I am interested
in having folklore from other parts of the country as well as
pioneer ballads and folklore of the south. I know your searches
have brought you material from all periods and all quarters. We
certainly hope that you will be able to meet with us.

Cordially yours,
Marquis E. Shattuck
