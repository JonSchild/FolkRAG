BJ:  He didn't git no rain!  Didn' get no rain, hah, hah, hah!
An' so that was jus' wery (very) funny how he could [put] tell it, ya
know?  An' I thought he was really [funny] prain' for rain.  He
wanted water.  And he considered that -- He didn' know that God
didn't know [that] where he was at.  You see, "Now, if you think
I'm, I'm a nigger, I'll tell ya where I'm at."  Say, "I'm in Wahchoola,
by God."  See?  He, you know you in bad shape if you in a place
an' you know God don't know zactly where you at.  And don't
know zactly who you are!  Ha, ha, ha!  You, hah, hah, hah, he, you
know that, you know that prayer didn' even leave the fillin' station.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!  A-hah!  Oh, it was sumpin' funny!  And he could
tell that thing an' they jus have a. . .they jus', they jus'. . .
make me jus' laugh.  'Cause that man could jus' tell it so
dreadful.  Jus' stan' out an' jus' rare back an' jus' tell it jus'
like it is.  An' mock 'im good, jus' a-like 'im, ya know?  Boy. . .
TL:  Did you hear this when you were in Miami?
BJ:  Yeah, I was in Miami, yeah.  That was very funny.  Yeah it sure
was.

     An' ah, I, when I didn't tell you about when I was on the 
Gulf of Mexico.  Ah, I was tellin' him (ALAN) about it other,
other night.  I think he took it all down, but. . .

BJ:  Uh-huh, yeah.  But ah. . .When I was down there when this '28
storm was.  Ah, I had ah, ah, tried to drive a car.  Which I
couldn't, ya know.  But I was [drivin'--] ah, tryin' to learn at that
time.  I sorta kept my spirit with tryin' to learn.  This lil'
ol' house that we stayed in was jus' a, ah, a top an' bottom.
In the middle of it was screen.  Lil' bitty ol' thang (thing).
An' I used to cook outside.  I made me a stove out of a tin tub.
