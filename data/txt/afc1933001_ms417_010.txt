when you ask about leaving
this is what you say
we're to darn poor & ragged
we can never get away

they take all u make boys
for Dr. Mill & rent
& when old payday rolls around
u never draw a cent.

Cho:

sometimes u have to go to work
without a bite to eat
without a pr of pants to wear
& no shoes for ur feet

Cho:
----
you're all hungry & ragged
& I am sad & blue
yes I'm so disgusted
I don know what to
