Dear Dr. Spivak:     Attention : Dr. Spivak

Mr. Ziman a friend of yours, suggested that I write you asking
you to stop in and inspect our recording facilities.

We are distributors of the well known Universal Wax and Acetate
Recording equipment. We have both of these types of recording machines set up
in our studios and will be very glad to demonstrate them to you at your convenience.

If you will be kind enough to call us in advance of your
visit, I shall make it a point to be here and show you our entire installation.

I am enclosing a descriptive circular which will give you
an idea of our set up.

Very truly yours,
R.J. Coar
