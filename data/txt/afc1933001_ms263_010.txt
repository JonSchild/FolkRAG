5. West Coast of Alaska, Amos Berg     Approved    Actual 

Mr. Berg, supervised by the Smithsonian Institution, 
and the National Geographic Society, is making this season 
a film on the life of the Eskimaux on the shore islands of 
Alaska. He carries with him a Library of Congress recording 
machine, and will record the music of this musically 
unknown territory and of the white people of Alaska on the 
nearby coast.  
Quad approved                  Approved     $225.00 

6. West Virginia, 1941 

Margaret Valliant, who has done much for folk-song in the 
National Youth Administration, requested a few blank records 
and needles for work in West Virginia in September. It is 
my belief, however, that the project has been cancelled due 
to change in Miss Valliant's plans. 

7. North Carolina, Fall, 1941 

Fletcher Collins is chairman of the Folklore Committee 
of the National Council of Teachers of English, and 
an active collector in his own right. It is projected 
that the Library lend him a recording machine for about 
three weeks' recording of some very fine ballad singers 
in northern North Carolina.

8. Ozark Region: Arkansas and Missouri, 1941-1942

Vance Randolph is the most eminent authority on 
folkways of the Ozarks. He has compiled a large collection 
of ballads and manuscripts, and asked for help 
for recording them. It seemed to be that no more
important project could be supported by the Library this 
year, since the Ozarks Region is one out of which so 
much of the folkways of the western states has stemmed,
and since it is an area from which the Library has very
little material. Mr. Randolph's five-months' project 
will result in a definitive collection. 
Quad approved                1515.00
