Dear Mr. Spinacke :
I thank you for
your letter concerning the 
Mrs. Tartt expedition. I shall
be ready to start whenever
you get all of the preliminaries 
cleared up. I hope 
you can arrange to have
advanced to Mrs. Tartt
her expense money for a 
definite period. I'll guarantee
protection to the Library
in case of any calamity
happening to Mrs. Tartt
Your friend,
JohnA. Lomax
