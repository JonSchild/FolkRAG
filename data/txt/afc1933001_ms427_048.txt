SONG TO THE SOLDIER

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
We are your fathers, your brothers
Say will you aim at us?
Shoot at the hungry? Shoot at the mass?

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
Come to your class, Your class, your class!

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
We are your sisters, your mothers
Turn to your officers:
"We will not shatter, none of our bone!"

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
Come to your own, Your own, your own!

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
You are our comrades, our brothers.
Red flows the blood in us
Red as our banners, Blazing this hour.

Workers in uniform, Farmers in uniform
With us for power, For power, for power!

(Round)     POOR MISTER MORGAN

Poor Mister Morgan
Cannot pay his income tax;
Pity poor Morgan he cannot pay.
He's dead broke, he hasn't got a cent.

(Round)     Election Round

Are you a worker or are you a banker?
If you are a worker vote with us.
Have you got a Rolls Royce?
Are you unemployed by choice?
If not, the vote with us!
If not you'd better wake ups and vote with us!
