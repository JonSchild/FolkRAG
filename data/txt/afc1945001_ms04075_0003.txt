Conversation in City and County Building, Denver, August 4:
"Organized labor is running the country. You can bet your 
bottom dollar that neither the President nor Congress would dare
crack down on either the labor or agricultural bloc. Personally,
I am not going to vote for a candidate this fall simply because
he has labor's endorsement. What I am interested in is not whether
he is for labor but whether he is for America. They tell me that
the popular slogan now is, "Win the election, then win the war."
