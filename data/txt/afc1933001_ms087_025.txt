Dear Mr. Lomax:

My travel itinerary has now come through and I am relieved
to say that if the train is on time, I shall pull into Denton
just before lunch on Wednesday, November 12th. This means that
we could have a talk and, if the weather is fine, stretch our
legs a little that afternoon. I think it might be better if you
would check up with President Hubbard, for as I remember there
was a Writers' Congress in progress at Denton when last I was
there, and I was invited to take part in the afternoon session.

Please feel no compulsion about staying for my talk that
evening. Let me remind you what Eddie Newton said when he was
asked to hear John Galsworthy in Philadelphiaâ€” "Thank you, kindly,
Ma'am, but I give lectures. I don't go to them."

Faithfully yours,

Mr. John Lomax,
7456 San Benito Way,
Dallas, Texas.
