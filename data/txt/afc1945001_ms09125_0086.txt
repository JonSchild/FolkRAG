My Pet Lion
1. Once I had a pet lion named 
Herman. Herman is a trained lion 
One day when I came home from 
school I was looking for my 
sister I looked all over, but guess what?
Herman ate her. The next day when 
I came home I was looking 
for my brother & Herman ate him 
The next day when I came 
home I was looking for mother 
& father but Herman ate them to
But when I came home the 
next day I found mother father 
sister & brother    Herman gave 
birth to all of them.
