1.  Mr. Brown asked his wife anxiously
what was on the menu for dinner.
She replied sarcastically, "Don't be
silly! You know as well as I that
we're having coupon eight."  That was
the only answer he received.  He suffered 
many ways but finally he
could stand it no longer.  He
said, "I don't mind having cans
fall on me every time I open
my closet.  I don't mind taking
a bath with a tub-full of 
canned tuna.  I do mind, however,
opening the medicine cabinet,
and thinking I'm using the saving 
lotion, use ketchup instead."
