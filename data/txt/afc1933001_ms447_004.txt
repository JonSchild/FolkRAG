Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.
[*I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne, 
I'm off for Montan'*]

Refrain:
Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne,
Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.

[I'm leavin' Cheyenne, I'm off for Montan';
Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.]

I'm a-ridin' old Paint, I'm a-leadin' old Fan,
[Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.]

With my feet in the stirrups, my bridle in my hand;
[Good-by, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.]

Old Paint's a good pony, he paces when he can,
[Good-by, little Annie, I'm off for Cheyenne.]

[*I'm sorry, young lady, my pony won't stand, etc.*]

Oh, hitch up your horses and feed 'em some hay,
And seat yourself by me as long as you stay.

My hosses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay;
My wagon is loaded and rollin' away.

I'm a-ridin' old Paint, I'm a-leadin' old Dan, *
I'm a-goin' to Montan' to throw the hoolihan.

They fed in the coulees, they water in the draw,
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw.

Old Bill Jones had two daughters and a song;
One went to Denver, the other went wrong.

His wife died in a pool-room fight,
And still he sings from morning till night.

I'm a rambler and a gambler and far from my home,
And those that don't like me can leave me alone.

Oh, whiskey and beer, they are nothing to me,
They killed my old Dad, now they can try me.

I'll tell you the truth, not lyin' or jokin',-
I'd rather be in jail than to be heart-broken.

Oh, when I die take my saddle from the wall,
Put it on my pony, lead him from the stall,

Tie my bones to his back, turn our faces to the west,
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best.

*or, With a pack on old Baldy and riding old Dan.
