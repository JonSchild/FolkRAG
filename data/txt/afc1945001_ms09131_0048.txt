1. There was a fight between the German & Americans
on some island, I believe, and the Americans were retreating.
One of them had fallen just about 200 yds. from the enemy, & an
American soldier stopped retreating, saw that his leg had to
be amputation, & did this regardless of the fact that the
Germans were almost upon them. The Germans were so
impressed that they held fire until the American finished
the amputation & carried the other soldier out of sight.
2. "Slap the Jap."
3. The mother of a boy on Guadacanal told me that
the Japanese prisoners weren't such bad fellows. A lot of
them know English, so they have some good conversations.
