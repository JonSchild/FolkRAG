CLARIDGE
"QUEBEC's LAST APARTMENT-HOTEL"
220 - GRANDE-ALLEE - 220
QUEBEC

8/28/1939.

Dear Alan: For two cents a 
record and a hundred dollar
advance I have agreed to
Mr Wetherall to come in to
Washington from Niagara 
Falls, Canada instead of 
going on to Texas via Detroit
as we had planned. I have
told him he could write
me there.

I am still very sure
that I will not guarantee
Columbia against some
fake reuben suing them for
misuse of material. For
a big corporation it
is always open season.
