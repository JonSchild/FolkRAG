BJ TAPE 16, p. 40

school in town, when I was little, to this bar -- ah, this --
ah, it wasn't called a bar; it was suspencers (dispensers?) or
sumpin' like that.  But an-anyhow that what it was, same thing
that it is now.
TL:    Suspencers?
BJ:    Spencers or sumpin' like that.  But, anyhow, they would --
saloon!  That's what they call that thing.
TL:    Saloon?
BJ:    Um-hum.  Beer saloon.  Um-hum.  I remember that, um-hum.  They call it. . .
TL:    What was that like, Bessie?
BJ:    Hum?
TL:    What was that place like?
BJ:    Jus' like the whiskey joints is now.  I mean, the store.
You go down the store an' buy your whiskey.  Ya see?  That what
they call 'em, 'cause they wasn't callin' it bar.  They call it
saloon.  Beer saloon.  'Cause they lots, lots a beer.  They jus'
go in there an' drink beer.  Um-hum.
