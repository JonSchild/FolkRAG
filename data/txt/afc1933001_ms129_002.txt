Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear friend,
 
Please pardon me for not
answering sooner.  I received
my records a few days
ago.  They do not play very
plain.  In fact, they can hardly
be understood.  I used the
needles you sent only.  If
they do not get to playing
plainer with use they will
not be any good.  If you can
use them in any way I
will send them back to you.
