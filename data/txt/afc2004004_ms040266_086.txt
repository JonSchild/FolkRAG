Mason, Dixon line is of course an imaginary line 
which separates the Free States from the Slave States. 
 it was originally drawn to mark out the boundaries 
between the possessions of Lord Baltimore and the 
family of William Penn.  So furious had become the 
contentions between these two families that in 1763
 two famous mathemeticians were called in to settle the 
dispute - Charles Mason & Jeremiah Dixon
     Dixon was a Durham man and when 
asked about his qualifications for this 'touchy' job the 
question was put, "Whither did you study mathematics
 at Oxford or Cambridge?" Dixon replied, "At neither,
 but in a little pit cabin at Rokfield Fell" 
      Dixon had formerly done quite a lot of mechanical
 work in coal-mines.
       Dixon's Line gave rise to the well 
known negro song "Dixie's Land"
    Anyhow, that's plenty about ballads for 
now.  Possibly we can talk more on the
 subject when we meet again.
      I think that night we met after
 the Bush House? affair you just weren't
 too well.  I do hope your health is 
now greatly improved. 

(Kind regards and best wishes)?????
