2:20    Lomax: Song and speech
2:25    Frederick; Comments and close

On paper this looks like the wrong way to set up the show --
on a formal time arrangement -- but this procedure has worked
out pretty satisfactorily under the long distance conditions.
If you want to make some counter suggestions, however, we'd 
like to have them -- on the whole pattern. Ordinarily, two
switches are about all the network wants to make, but if
we can plan something very special here, we might be able to
sell the idea. First, it would be very good for the show to
open with our identification: "Of Men and Books, with John
T. Frederick of Northwestern University and Alan Lomax (however 
you would like to be identified first off)" and a verse
or chorus of an appropriate song on the theme idea from the 
east. Then switch the show to Chicago. An open wire would
add something likewise, although we've never had one -- now
times are different. Perhaps you have some special script
material we could use at this end, in addition to Professor
Frederick's comments. Altogether, we'd appreciate you, Phil
Cohen, and all concerned, giving us your best thoughts on
the show.

Of course, the first thing we need to know is, can you make
it on Jan. 31, and where will you originate, so we can get
it into publicity. Then, we'll work out the details as we go
along.

Thanks for your good help, and we hope to have your acceptance.

Yours sincerely,
Parker Wheatley
