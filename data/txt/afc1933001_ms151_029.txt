Memo to Dr. Harold Spivack, Chief of Music Division
from Alan Lomax, Archive of American Folk Song.

     I should like to recommend that the Archive
of American Folk Song work out a cooperative recording
project with Dr. Roy Mitchell of New York University and
his singers. Dr. Mitchell has at his disposal a great 
deal of interesting foreign-language material in New
York City and is willing to record this material, transcribe
it, and present the library with the finished results.
In return he is anxious to get new material for his group
of singers, particularly American Material. He is
interested in a few of the recorded songs already in 
the archive and would like to have duplicates of these.
He is willing to pay for the duplication himself and I 
should like your approval for the duplication of five
records for him. Thus we would set another cooperative
project in motion.
