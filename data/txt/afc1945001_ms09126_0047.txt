Hitler and The War.

It has been a prophecy that in
1942, Hitler would become very ill and die,
bringing the war to an end.  The other
day I was looking at the headlines,
which read, "Hitler is Gravely Ill with
a Mental Disorder" and has called
for the best physician in Germany.
So far the prophecy has come true,
and every good American is waiting
very eagerly for the last part to
take effect.
