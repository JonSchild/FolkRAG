WERMELAND
(Sweden)
(Page 116 - One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations)
O Wermeland, thou dearest, thou fairest domain,
Bright gem within the shining crown of Sweden,
The tranquil joy that fills me, that here I regain
I would not change for all the bliss of Eden.
Here rocked once my cradle and here shall bloom my grave,
And here the sweetest maiden her love to me once gave.
What higher heaven could I on earth attain?
