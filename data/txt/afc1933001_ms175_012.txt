Dear Moe: 
I address this letter to you because I know you will
appreciate the problem, and feel that I can as a friend entrust 
the matter to your care. 

During the last year and a half, I have orally taught 
Burl Ives a great number of American folk songs. Some of these 
are to be published for the first time in our forthcoming book, 
Our Singing Country. Some time later he approached me and 
asked me whether he could record some in this latter category 
for Columbia, and I told him to go ahead, and to see to it 
that Columbia got in touch with my father, who, in his dealings 
with radio companies, recording companies and publishers, insists 
on reasonable collector's rights in the songs. Burl 
evidently forgot to tell you people to do this, and my father
feels rightly that I went further in my friendly relation with 
Burl than I should have gone. I think it's up to Columbia 
to get it touch with Mr. Lomax and come to some reasonable 
settlement. 

The legal department had written him to "be good enough 
to send us piano scores of the compositions on which you 
claim copyright, together with complete copyright information", 
etc. That may be a good way to do legal business, but by God 
it's not a very good way to keep a friendly relationship. 

I hope if you are ever in Washington you will find time 
to drop into the Library and listen to some real American 
music. 

Cordial best wishes, 
Alan Lomax
