a wingle-wonga.  You see?
TL:  That's downstairs?
BJ:  That's right.  But I went up the gingle-gonga first, ya see?
An' I looked out through the winda, glass, ya see?  That's the
eye-sight-wongas.  See, ya eye sight, ya wongas  (wanders?) all
around.  An'  I saw the hawg eatin' up the potatas.  Ya see?  A

BJ:  They, th-th-they was called "bitches."  Ah, which they are
bitches, ya know. A dawg - - a she-dawg is one.
TL:  Is a bitch?
BJ:  That's right.
        And um, now I'm gonna, see, I think of an[y]other one, a
