Dear Margaret:

Apart from the usual technical hitches and the heat, we;re doing well. I think
I have arranged for a folk song institute to be established here at the university
to continue the work and provide an umbrella for the copyrights which will be used
to finance folklore activities. What with making stern and contacts, I haven't
put a pencil to paper but Toni is sailing.

Would you look at the attached letter and male a comment. Would this be a better
place to publish that Paris. Nobody wants "Phonotactics" and the coding book alone
was not found suitable by Sol Tax.

Much love,
