Ben: Cruel Lincoln is well - I suppose it's a bit of jealousy
on the part of Cruel Lincoln, and he wanted to get his own back
on the squire's daugther or the squire's wife, and he killed her
at the finish. . . 
1) Says the lord to the lady, "I am now going out.
Beware of cruel Lincoln whilst I am gone out."
"What cares I for Lincoln or any of his kin?
My doors are all bolted, my windows are pinned."

2) As soon as the lord had gone out of sight,
Cruel Lincoln crept in at the middle of the night.
Went and pricked my sweet baby which caused it to cry,
Whilst the nurse sat a-singing "O hush a lolly-bye."

3) Old nurse, old nurse, how sound you do sleep,
Whilst my pretty baby most bitterly does weep.

4) The lady came down, not thinking any harm,
Cruel Lincoln stood a-waiting for to catch her in his arms.

5) O Lincoln, cruel Lincoln, spare me for one hour,
You shall have baby daughter who is a bright flower.
