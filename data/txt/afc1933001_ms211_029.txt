me your notes and, at the same
time, know[,] that you may have
another entire year of study
from me whenever and wherever
you will. Get all the
non-service fellowships you will in addition, from
whatever source, but no jobs
where you must put in a
certain number of hours daily;

I must confess that
your appropriation of my
Christmas gift "on Library business"
quite bowled me over,
I will add nothing further
except to ask you to try and
put yourself in my place.

I am sending Mrs. Seeger
a second batch of Ballad
material tomorrow when we
leave for a trip to Bransonville
