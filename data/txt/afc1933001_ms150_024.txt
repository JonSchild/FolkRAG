Dear Alan,

Why have you run away and how long will you be 
gone. I tried to get you the other day on account of why 
I have a new recording machine and I want to record a few Lomaxes. I also wanted to plug you about copyrighting 
my song, and all in all I resent your desertion of Washington. 
Please say it isn't so.
