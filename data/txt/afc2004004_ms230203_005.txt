BLUES - 3

KID:  Awwww-well, you know-uh, dat time, out in the hills like that, you 
couldn't get this good whiskey.  You got to drink what you could.
 I was drinkin' (you know(, some of that white cawn whiskey, (you know) 
made out of that real corns, you know?

SID:  I know what you mean.

KID:  And so 'n' that give me that blues and I started.

SID:  OK, Kid.  Well now, what you think about it, Nachez?

NACHEZ: (CONTINUING AT THE PIANO)  Well, Sid, I don' know 'bout the blues..
blues have hope me a lot.  Sid, I mean, I still have the blues, but -- 
when I have trouble, the blues the onliest thing that helps me.  I mean 
that's the onlies' way to-uh kinda ease my situation.  If I have lots
of trouble (for instance, the rent situation an' so forth an' so on 
like that), the blues the only thing that gives me consolation. 

SID:  Well, what about-uh, what about places wha' they didn't have to pay 
rent, jes' go on a plan'ation?

NACHEZ:  Well, I still had troubles.
