Fisk, 3.   14.      DAVID EDWARDS.

I made that myself along [about] about three weeks ago -- month
A:  What did you call it?
E:  Well, that's the Army Blues.
A:  What were you thinking [of] about
E:  I [sing my song alone.] was thinking about the army then.
A:  How soon do you think you'll go?
E:  Can't hardly tell about that thing.
A: [Would you like to go?] Have you asked to go
E:  [I'll go if I have to.]  I ain't axed for it, but I will go if I have to go
A:  Who do you think we're going to war with?
E:  Can't hardly tell.  That [thing's] just like [coming] going to the [coast] court -- can't
[hardly] tell how you're coming out.
