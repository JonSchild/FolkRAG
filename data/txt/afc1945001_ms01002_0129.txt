Bureau will provide Research Directors with special information
concerning the classification schemes to be used with non-local
rumors, it should be understood that this class of rumors must
not be used in local rumor campaigns except at the express direction 
of the Office of War Information.

III.  Education Program--General

Information must be available in sufficient quantities
to satisfy the needs of the people of the community. People's
interests vary greatly from topic to topic. When the authoritative information
is not enough or clear, rumors will spring up. To prevent the rise of rumors,
therefore, the best policy is one of covering all subjects as fully and
clearly as possible through regular information channels.

The Educational Director should ask to be sent regular
releases of important war agencies and see that the material contained 
in them is given the publicity their subject-matter suggests.
Lend-Lease, Department of Agriculture, Office of War Information,
Office of Civilian Defense, and many other government offices are
sources of information vital to proper understanding of the conduct
of the war. This information can be used in many ways in order to
reach all segments of the population. A local newspaper might be
asked to give space for a regular column. This column entitled
"Did you Know That" or "For Your Information" would carry background 
war information or specific interesting facts. Rumors
flourish best where information is lacking. By assuring sufficient
coverage of war topics regularly, rumor-control projects can block
development of new rumors.
