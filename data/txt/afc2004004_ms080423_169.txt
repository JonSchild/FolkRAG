Frank:  It's about this old man workin' out in the fields.  He comes
in and his wife ain't got dinner ready and how he handles the
situation. . .get's din, . . .it get's pretty rough!  (laughter)
This is an old one, real old.  I think this was the first song
my father sang for Frank Warner in 1938, when he came down here
to the house.  (sings):  "Oh the little man come in at noon,
dandoo, dandoo. . . ."  (sings several verses)
AL:  Well, in the old days the ladies were really subject to the
men, weren't they?  The men could beat 'em did they?  Ray?
Ray:  Well, I guess some. . .not too much.
AL:  Well, when I was going around the mountains the woman would
always stand til the husband and the family had eaten. . .
Man:  Yea. . .well. . .there wasn't no women's lib at that time (laughter)
She waited on the table and handed the food. (hand and foot?)
Another Man:  Theyall do that yet.
Man:  Yeah, they do. . .my wife. . .yeah
AM:  Nothing like it used to be.
Man:  No.  We'd just get the food and go out. . .
AM:  Yeah and, . . . . keep the flies away, . . .back then you didn't
have those screens. . .
AM:  We lived out here in the winter time when I growed up, . . .
sometime yet when it  froze ice through that front door we'd
just eat out of the kiddle (??) a lot of times, just take our
plates and get . . .
(unintelligible) . . .and Ed eats that way 'bout all the time. . 
Ed:  Without anybody coming over to eat, I don't eat at the table,
I don't think anything of it.
AL:  Looks like you 'bout got that dog out of that wood. (?)
