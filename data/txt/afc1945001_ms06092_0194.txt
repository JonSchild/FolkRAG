recruiter from a large defense contractor at Parker, Arizona, came to
his packing shed and recruited his workers from under his nose, making
it necessary for him to go to El Centro or Phoenix frequently to
recruit additional workers, only to have them taken again.  This
shipper also said he paid 75[cents] per hour for field labor, while the
defense contractor paid a minimum of 87[cents] per hour.  (Government employee
