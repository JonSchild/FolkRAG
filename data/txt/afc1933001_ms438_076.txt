"Nawsuh, my papa an' mama was too fine to me. They never
touched me to whip me. One time when I was a little thing, couldn'
been more'n seven years old, my mama tried to whip me an' my
papa jumped on her. He knocked her over an' had her down slappin'
her an' I retch an' got de poker i'on an' hit him on de back his
head, "Ke-bop!" He got up an' commence a-cussin'. "I ought
to whip you myself, you damn little rascal." But I drew back wid
dat poker an' stood dere an' say, "Don' you touch mama no mo'."
"An' you know I broke 'em up from fightin'. [I can 'member one time]
Mama an' papa would be talkin' at de table an' mama would say
sumpin papa didin' like. (She never did call him no liar, like
womens will day mens nowadays, but she con'dict him.) He
would hit her side de head, "Bop!" knock her clean 'cross de room. We
(chilluns 
ud be) under de table waitin' what would happen an' they'd be at each other, fightin'.
But soon's I got to be some size, I broke 'em up of fightin'
an' squabblin'. When I got big enough an' I'd hear ' em commence
to pass hard words, I'd go over by de do' an' stan' where I could
reach papa's shot gun [hangin' over de do']. I wouldn' say nothin'
I'd jes' stan' dere lookin' an' listenin', right where I could
reach dat shot-gun. Papa would notice me an' he never would hit
mama no mo'. He'd say, "Aw, gwan you crazy ol' woman, hush yo' mouf."
[No mo'] an' da's all. Yassuh, soon'd I got big enough to reach papa's shot-gun,
[where it was hangin' over de do'] I broke 'em up of fightin' an'
squabblin'." "
