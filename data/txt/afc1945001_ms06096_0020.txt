Seattle, Washington
August 4, 1942
        A sailor told a room full of people that he had visited a flyer in the Sand Point Naval hospital who was all shot up at Dutch Harbor.
        This flyer said, according to the sailor, that there were only fifteen planes when the attack came and only five survived. 
        The sailor also quoted the flyer as saying that the Navy asked aid from the Army Air Corps and got nothing but a late visit of some bombers who then flew off not knowing what they had accomplished. No fighter aid was given, he said. He said there was definite conflict between Army and Navy in Alaska.
