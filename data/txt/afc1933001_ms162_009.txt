of Acorn on the Roof . . .
"From the pen of Texas' new Port Laureate comes a 
charming collection of verse, ACORN ON THE ROOF.
There is a quality in it that attests the rightness of the 
honor that recently came to her."  -- Wichita Daily Times.
"Her verse has an original ring, a note of sincerity."  --
Charles B. Driscoll, New York Day by Day.
"There is real beauty in these poems.  Not a few heart 
aches, but a great deal more happiness, and a certain deft 
handling of the eternal human problems that make a 
twentieth century love affair as fresh and as important as 
what passed between Jacob and Rebecca at the well . . .
Simplicity, genuine emotion and music -- those are the 
qualities that I look for in poetry.  They are here in 
abundance."  -- Kenneth C. Kaufman, The Daily Oklahoman.
"Mrs. Robertson is really two poets.  Or, shall we say,
a person and a poet? . . . She is at once winsome and 
wayward, domestic and romantic.  But she is also a keen 
observer and an accurate recorder of the varied aspects of 
her native state . . . Lexie Dean Robertson has proved 
herself a writer of real distinction, and amply justified 
her selection as Poet Laureate."  -- Dr. William H. Vann,
The Houston Post.
of I Keep a Rainbow . . .
"Lexie Dean Robertson's muse has the give of ingratiating 
herself into the receptiveness of her audience; one 
feels at once simpatica, a glow of camaradarie." -- Ben
Musser, Poetry World.
"Her facile rendering of domestic themes and her occasional 
touches of the whimsical have made Lexie Dean
Roberson a favorite in lecture-recitals and in such magazines 
as Good Housekeeping.  In I KEEP A RAINBOW 
the author has equalled and in some respects surpassed her 
earlier work."  -- Dallas News Book Page.
"With characteristic versatility Mrs. Robertson has 
touched in this volume on the beauty of every day, homey
things; on romance, thwarted love, sorrow, regret, moods 
of nature . . . She is consistent and in this lies the poignant 
appeal and undeniable charm of her work."  -- Houston Post.
of Red Heels . . .
"RED HEELS is a book that will enjoy more than a 
local sensation . . . something of the simple reverence of 
Joyce Kilmer in the religious group."  -- Amarillo Sunday 
News and Globe.
"RED HEELS is a creditable volume containing much 
that scintillates with rare beauty; a rare and vivid portrayal 
of fine emotions."  -- Walt Mills, Oklahoma Columnist,
in Sooner Books and Authors.
"Mrs. John Henry Hammond, granddaughter of William 
Vanderbilt, is one of the most illustrious person 
I have ever known.  She never lets a day go by without 
memorizing some poetry.  Last winter I sent her a copy 
of Lexie Dean Robertson's RED HEELS and she was so 
delighted with it that she telegraphed for twelve copies and 
a little later she telegraphed for twelve more."  -- Mrs.
Percy V. Pennybacker, Baylor College Daily.
