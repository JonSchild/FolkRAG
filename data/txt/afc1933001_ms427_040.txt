(Round)   ARE YOU SLEEPING?

Are you sleeping, are you sleeping?
Brother John, Brother John,
Morning bells are ringing, Morning bells are ringing;
Ding, ding, dong, ding, ding, dong.

Are you saving, are you saving?
Right along, right along,
Saving Stamps will help you Ring the bells for Freedom:
Ding, ding, dong, ding, ding, dong.


(Round)    THREE BLIND MICE

Three blind mice, Three blind mice,
See how they run! See how they run!
They all ran after the farmer's wife,
She cut off their tails with a carving knife,
Did ever you see such a sight in your life
As three blind mice...........


JUANITA

Soft o'er the fountain,
Ling'ring falls the southern moon;
Far o'er the mountain,
Breaks the day too soon!
In thy dark eyes' splendor,
Where the warm light loves to dwell,
Weary looks, yet tender,
Speak their fond farewell.

Chorus: Nita! Juanita!
Ask they soul if we should part!
Nita! Juanita!
Lean thou on my heart.

When in they dreaming
Moons like these shall shine again,
And daylight beaming,
Prove thy dreams are vain,
Wilt thou not, relenting,
For thine absent lover sigh?
In thy heart consenting
To a prayer gone by?

Chorus: Nita! Juanita!
Let me linger by thy side!
Nita! Juanita!
Be my own Fair Bride.
