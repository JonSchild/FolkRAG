The people who come

4) The minister's wife, she was there
She wasnae very weel
She had to make her water
In the middle of a reel

5) The minister's auntie she was there
She had us a' in fits
Wi' jumpin' off the mantlepiece
An' landin' on her tits

6) The meenister's dochter she was there
A hoor thru & thru
They stuck her up against a dyke (wall)
And ba'd her like a coo.

7) The minister at the kitchen sink
Temptation's hymn was hummin'
And pourin' water on his prick
To keep the thing frae comin'

8) O Jock the plowman, he was there
It really was a shame
He ba'd a lassie 40 times
And would not tak her haime.
