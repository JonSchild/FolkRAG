Archive of American Folk-Song

Dear Sir:

I am collecting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of 
songs or ballads current and popular among prisoners, or "made up" by 
them and passed around by "word of mouth" rather than by the printed page.  
Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences 
in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the "free world".  
They grow in length or change verbally as they are passed around.  I wish 
to secure copies of them all, no matter how crude or vulgar they may be.  
Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to 
record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine.  The 
material I wish to secure is especially plentiful among Negro prisoners.

Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me 
know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge?  
May I also ask you to forward to me at this time the words of those songs 
that are available, with such remarks and suggestions as might be helpful?  
Even short scraps will  be welcome.

This proposal is part of a plan of the Library of Congress to collect 
and make available to properly qualified students the words and music of 
all American folk-songs.

I shall greatly appreciate a reply to this communication.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
Honorary Curator and Consultant
in American Folk-Song.

Compliance with the above request will be a service to the Library of 
Congress, and appreciated.

Herbert Putnam
Librarian
