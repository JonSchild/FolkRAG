Second businessman: "I very much question the philosophy of the New Deal towards Russia -- either for or against Russia. The New Dealers never have had a policy.

Overheard in a restaurant in Denver, August 11. "I do not see how inflation can be avoided. As long as wages are increased, and this is certain as long as there is a scarcity of labor, prices will advance and inflation is sure to follow. We are profoundly  interested in what Mr. Henderson is attempting to do. Personally, I see little hope of his success."

"Why should there be a scarcity of labor now when we still have a WPA appropriation of more than a million dollars. If the people on that payroll were put to useful work, a portion at least of our labor problem would be relieved."

"England has kept India divided for 150 years so that they could never get a unanimous agreement of the government. And now England wants a unanimous agreement and you know how it will get it -- by buying India off. They brought disunity and now they will buy unity." (Heard at Nederland, Colorado, August 9.)
