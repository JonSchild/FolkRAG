Division of Music
August 24, 1940

     In considering the ways and means in which the Music Division could
be useful to the National Defense Program, it occurred to us that the
Archive of American Folk-Song could be particularly useful. For one
thing, the Archive could prepare a series of song-books which could be
whether enlisted or conscripted. To be effective, however, the songs
should be chosen carefully with full consideration given to the
psychological problems besetting the new soldier. Accordingly, I asked
Mr. Lomax and Mr. Seeger to prepare tentative tables of contents. This 
they did but instead of one songster, they prepared four. Three of
them of them are intended for use in separate regions - the west, the 
south, the north - and the fourth for the special use of negroes.

     Each songster contains twenty-one folk songs typical of the region
and generally familiar to persons coming from this region. The songs
are to be arranged in four part harmony with simple piano accompaniment
and with tablature indications for guitar and ukelele. Each songster
should contain declarations and illustrations, if possible, one for each
song representative of the region, the art material to be of the sort
documented by the INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN. Each songster on the page
opposite the table of contents is to contain an excerpt from the life and
adventures of a folk hero typical of the region, and anecdote about him
ought to be scattered through the book wherever there is space.

The four heroes would be:
     For the West, Pecos (or Big Foot Wallace); for the South,
Davy Crockett; for the North, Paul Bunyan; for the Negro, John Henry.

The titles of the books will be:
   1. West of the Mississippi
   2. Down in the Valley
   3. From Maine to Washington
   4. Deep River

Respectfully submitted,
