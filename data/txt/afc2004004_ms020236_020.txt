TL:            How did he know to leave?
BJ:            Well, he knowed it because they was talkin' it.  [Said] Come Uncle 
Gene's [out] house huntin' him.  Said he was over there.  Said he is the one that tried to 
rape this girl, was rasslin' with her.  The girl said she, -- the man's white -- she
had this man's hair.   An' she sure, indeed; she  Had some of 
his hair, pure indeed, dark, white folk's hair, some of that hair 
like yourself.   Huh, wa'n' nothin' like that; he didn't have ['nuf] 
hair long 'nuf to pull out nohow.   Yessuh.  An' she said she know he was 
a white man.   An' she tussle with him.  The other day 
when I didn' feel like tellin' it; I don' like to talk about it.
               But, anyway, then they came -- before they -- when it 
firs' happen -- see, he run about two weeks, [scoutin' ahead, see]  
scout an' hid, y'see. . .Scout mean hidin'; he was hidin' about.  
But, anyway, when it firs' happen, I was down there; I was at 
Cuspeth, me an' my Cousin Anne,   sittin' in the yard, drawin' 
dolls an' lot of things, you know, sittin' in the sand.   An' he 
run right through the yard an' picked me up an' kissed me.  An' 
Annie reached an' kissed him a lil' bit, however.   An' he run 
into the house, an' he got some bread -- got some tea cake; we 
ha' Virginia bread, tea cake -- an' he kep' on through the fiel'.  
Mama was leavin' the next day for Dawson -- you know, back home.  
An' Mama tol' him, said "You come on back home, home, come on 
to Dawson."  You know, because if Uncle Gene go anywhere then, 
they'll say [who] he carried him off somewhere, see?   [I mean stay] Uncle Gene jus' 
put; stay where [you] he can be seen.  Told him to make it on.  
Well, we gots the next day on the train.   An' so, about a week 
after that he come that close to Mama's house.   An' didn' know it.
