and another thing before the war
started the colored couldn't go to
white shows or anything but now
they can go. White people have done
nothing to me but they don't want
colored people next to them on buses,
street cars, ect. Then I ask you why
have them next to the white in the
war. Most of them don't want to go
for their country because they don't justice.
Theres lots of things I would like to
say but I don't think I'll have time.
And also when I pledge to the flag
I say liberty and justice for ?
(which means white.)
