Dear Rae:

Enclosed is a package of cactus needles that I 
found in my files. Hand them to the sound engineer
with my best wishes and tell him I am on the
track of a large stock, which I will buy for him
when it turns up. Meantime, I would like to know
what results he can obtain with these needles from
the Bahaman records, since this series I plan to
have copied soon.

Thanks for your recent letters and your continued
kindness.

Yours,
