MRS: (cooking) ...we may have to fry it again!

MR: You know sometimes it wasn't as dull as you'd think
it might of been at the singin'. I remember bein'
at singin' one day at a country church, and, a pretty
small crowd there, and, an old gentleman got up and
he told 'em how he spelled his name and he says 
"I notice out in the cemetery here a lot of monuments
with that name on it" he says "Everybody here that
spells their name that way, I wish you'd stand up!"
So about half the church stood up when he said that.
When they all got standin' up good, he says, "Why 
in the world don't you clean your cemetery. It's 
grown up with weeds high as your head!" Those people
sat down a lot faster then they stood up! But he
was a good man and he meant good. He turned around 
and made a good size contribution to the cemetery
fund there to help get it cleaned off. But he sure
did tickle some of those people who knew him real well!

AL: He didn't mean it to be funny, did he?

MR: No, he didn't mean it to be funny, but what made it so
funny, they just jumped up when he said that, they
thought he was gonna be related to them; then when he 
said "why don't you clean your cemetery off?!" they just 
sat down just like that...it was right funny!

AL: Could you all sing a little bit of "present joys" for us?

MRS: Sure try! ... You start it...

MR: No you better start it...
Let's sing a little bit of 101...
