Tape:  #221 cont.   6

Oh, I didn't mean to screw up the conversation, if you. . .

No, no, no, no, no.  Leo?

It's a more difficult idiom to penetrate.  I think it's difficult 
for the average person to come along and understand and 
appreciate it, and enjoy it, because the melody as we said before is 
thrown in with other counter melodies, which is much more interesting 
music to sing than many other kinds of music but it isn't as 
easy to listen to.    And I think that will always be a limitation 
to sacred harp; that's one of the things it will have to struggle 
against.

The truly musical people like to penetrate mystery-- that is one 
of the things they like, isn't it?   They like to untangle the 
little scans of tones, and understand what makes the combined 
tones so fascinating, that's what musicians are all about.  So 
the really musical people are always going to be, I think many of 
them are trying to find sacred harp.   I think that's enough.   I 
think I have said myself. . .don't you think. . .
