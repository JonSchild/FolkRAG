THE BLACKSMITH 

(Manuscript.)

In the smithy by the fire,
 Stands the blacksmith at his forge.
Clangs the hammer, sparks of fire are flying
 And he sings o'er it a song.

Of the freedom which is coming
 Sings he loudly, sings he long.
And he knows not from his brows are pouring
 Beads of sweat, heedless of song. 

Fully o'ercome by the freedom,
 He sings his song and loud it rings. 
But the hammer sounds much louder,
 And he hears not what he sings.
