November 2, 1934

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Please excuse this very tardy acknowledgment of
your interesting letter of October 23, to which I shall
reply in more detail after my return from New York on
November 6.

For the moment I shall simply say that I have received 
a long letter from Professor Reed Smith â€” a similar
letter was no doubt addressed to you; that I have
also received a second letter of inquiry from Professor 
Rickard, to which I shall reply by saying that no plans 
will be made until after you and I have had an opportunity 
to talk things over; and that I am enclosing photostats
of your report for the year, together with the
original of the letter sent you by Mr. Walton.

A copy of G.S. Jackson's Early Songs of Uncle Sam 
goes forward to you under separate cover. The enclosed
frank will bring it back to us without payment of postage.

In haste,


Chief, Division of Music
