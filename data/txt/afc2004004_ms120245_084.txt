R.P.
[Wh] The last night we were in Plaisance R. called 
me about 11 P.M. to the back door to 
pour water. Then we went to the front 
where we poured water and broke an egg. 
-- It seems that no one cd [leave] live in 
the house because it was inhabited by 
a big devil which had put there 
to protect it. It lived in the other half. 
A woman that had lived there formerly 
called R. & asked him if he had heard 
anything (which he had, but said no) 
- then warned him about the devil 
warning him that it had stolen all her money
-Then the last night he lay down and 
began to dream - An old man appeared and 
said "Young fellow what you doin' 
here. Haven't I told you. Get up and 
feed that old devil." "I haven't no eggs" 
"Get up." When he got up he found an 
egg (where before ain't no one egg in the 
house").
