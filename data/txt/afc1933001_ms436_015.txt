[*Although I should think this would be rather like a
volume of short stories, I imagine we ought to offer
the Lomaxes a contract for it. The material sounds
rich, rare, and racy, and there's a distinct public for
their work. They are the best people working in this field 
today, and this should be a cheaper book to produce. Perhaps 
an introduction 
and connecting 
passages could 
be written, so 
these narratives 
won't be too 
disconnected.*]

Dear Jim:

I want to do a book of American narratives, lives, and adventure, 
which will consist entirely of transcriptions from 
phonograph records brought into the Archive.  It will expose to 
view for the first time in all of its natural and untrammeled 
variety the narrative genius of the American people."  It will 
contain the following chapters:

I. Mr. Jelly Lord
The self-told autobiography of the early life of Jelly 
Roll Morton, recognized by jazz critics as second, in the 
field of jazz composers, only to Duke Ellington.  He has
talked out his life to me on a series of sixty records, and 
it is the story of the growth of jazz and the growth of an 
important American character in brawling old New Orleans. 
Attached is a sample.

II. Aunt Molly Jackson, Midwife and Union Organizer
Feuds in the mountains, child marriage, trouble in the
coal mines, ghost stories, folk medicine.  A magnificent 
American portrait.

III. Woodie Guthrie, Okie Balladist and Poet
He has a narrative style as elaborate as Tom Wolfe, and 
as strong in its punches as Steinbeck.  A picture of growing 
up in oil boom ridden, dust blown Oklahoma.

IV. Old Man Ledford and the TVA
Old man Ledford, who has lived in the same house with 
the same smooth-grained, satiny poplar board walls his whole 
live, who was born in the same room that his father was born 
in, is going to be flooded out by the building of a TVA dam. 
He bids goodbye to his valley and his house, visits his 
neighbors, and they talk about the TVA and changing times.
Pare Lorentz would like to find a continuity writer to write 
this well about the American land.

V. The Old Men of Choistor.
A session on democracy, snakes, and the weather 
told by four old mountaineers.
