to come. Books are made out up
to No. 9 so we know we'll have to
do without a lot we've been used to.
By no means will we starve we
might even be healthier. The nutritional
classes that are held are
attended by millions of housewifes
seeking knowledge on how to serve
good meals with less, how to make
what we have go farther. In the
long run when the war is over
we will not have suffered so much 
as the European countries because
our gov't thought of the people first.
