[*SONG*]
                    ANOTHER DAY THE LORD HAS KEPT ME
This song previously transcribed and is in the files.

BJ:      That's enough of that one.   I know a lot of that, but
that's enough of that.   Let's try another one.

[*RE: SONG, When the Prodigal Son Come Come*]
TL:      "Prodigal Son."
BJ:       Hum?
TL:      "The Prodigal Son."
BJ:       Oh, yeah!   Le's try some a that.   I might could sing that
'cause I'm very hoarse; I may could git that in good, old prodigal
boy.
           This's a song about the prodigal son, when he lef' home.   You
read about it.   If you don't, why, you will.   I oughta let you
read about some of these things so when I sing you know what I'm
talkin' about.   It's a prodigal son, he had a whole lot a things;
his father had him all his portion of goods, you know, at home, you
know.   They used to give children, they call it a 'lowance.   [An'] So
he taken all his an' he got up; he got big-headed, bull-headed;
he wanted all his stuff.   So he go it an' lef'.
           When he left, he got in hard luck after he, all his money
was gone.   Got in hard luck.   An' nobody wouldn't let him in; nobody 
wouldn' fool with 'im 'cause he was broke.   That let ya know
how ya do!   When you got money you can make it an' you ain't, you
can't, in some places.   So that's what it's about.
           But, after all, wh-when he went down to nothin' an' didn'
have nothin', he went to a place an' hide himself to the citizens
