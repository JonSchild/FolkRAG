My dear little Susan:
   I wonder if you have run out to the mail-box for
Tommy and come back with a letter for yourself.  I hope so.
I went down town this afternoon and looked at all the Easter
baskets in the stores with Daddy and we talked about sending
one to you and [Susan] Pat but we thought that it would be all
squshed before  you could see it.  You may tell Deanie how the
Easter Rabbit always brings you lots of things and how you
look for your eggs in the house and I know he will find you in
Dallas.
   Since it would not do to send you Easter baskets I
thought that maybe you and Pat would like to have some pretty
Easter dresses.  Daddy thought so too and we looked at two of
the stores.  I found white dresses nearly alike at one place and
then at another store I found such a darling pink dress that
would fit you that I did not know what to do.  Which would you
like, to be dressed like Pat in a white dress or for each of you
to have different dresses, the prettiest that I could find?
You be sure and wreite and tell me what you would like.
