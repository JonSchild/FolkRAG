Come gentlemen sportsmen I pray listen all
I will sing you a song in praise of Skew Ball,
And how he came over you shall understand,
It was by Squire Mervin, the pearl of our land,
And of his late actions you have heard before,
He was lately challenged by one Sir Ralph Gore
For five hundred guineas on the plains of Kildare,
To run with Miss Sportly that famous grey mare.

Skew Ball then hearing the wager was laid,
Unto his kind master said don't be afraid,
For if on my side you thousands lay would
I would rig on your castle a fine mass of gold,
The day being come and the cattle walked forth,
The people came flocking from East, North & South
For to view all the sporters as I do declare,
And venture their money all on the grey mare.

Squire Mervin then smiling unto them did say,
Come gentlemen sportsmen to-morrow's the day,
All you that have hundreds I will lay you all,
For I'll venture thousands on famous Skew Ball
Squire Mervin then smiling unto them did say
Come gentlemen sportsmen tomorrow's the day
Spurs, horses and saddles, and bridles prepare
For you must away to the plains of Kildare.

The day being come the cattle walked out
Squire Mervin then ordered his rider to mount
And all the spectators to clear the way
The time being come not one moment delay
These cattle being mounted away the did fly,
Skew Ball like an arrow passed Miss Sportly by
The people went up to see them go round,
They said in their hearts that they ne'er touched the ground.

But as they were running in the midst of the sport
Squire Mervin to his rider then began his discourse
O loving kind rider come tell unto me
How far at this moment Miss Sportly from me,
O loving kind master you bear a great style
The grey mare's behind you a long English mile.
