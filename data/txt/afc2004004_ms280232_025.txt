TAPE 23: MARK ANDERSON. . .Middleton, Teasedale.
The Agricultural Show:
1) Hurrah, my lads, this is the day when to the fun we haste away,
Both rich and poor, high and low, we're off to the Agricultural Show.
Heigh-ho and away we go, lads and lasses all in a row,
Don't get teasing with the girls as we go to the High Force Agricultural Show.
2) Now at the show such sights you'll find
To delight the eye and improve the mind.
There's curtains and rugs and                    and ploughs
Mares and stallions, bulls and cows.
3) There's scythrs to reap and forks and rakes,
Ganders, turkeys, ducks and drakes.
Chcikens, hens and cocks that crow
To be seen at the Agricultural Show.
4) There's buvkets wet and tubs and pails
And cats with five and twenty tails.
All sorts of flowers and fruits that grow
To be seen at the Agricultural Show.
5) There's one old farmer showing his wife
Indeed it's true, upon me life.
He says, he would at 12 to 2
She ?
6) There's Curly Kate so jolly and fat
With her regular flippety-floppety hat.
She has holes in her stockings as big as a crown,
The ?
7) Now there's one old lady said she'd go
To the Agricultural Show.
She'd a peacock feather in her hat
And a hoop at her belly and another at her back.
8) Now lads, be careful when you go
To the High Force Agricultural Show.
For in nine months time itself will show
What you did at the Agricultural Show.
