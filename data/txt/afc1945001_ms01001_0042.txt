like more than you find in England.  Brooklyn is full 
of them too.  Why are so many soldiers here when our
boys are being shipped across?  And why aren't the sailors
out with their ships instead of hanging around New York?

"ANSWER-- By a British official in New York--'There have
been no British soldiers here since a detachment of
about 200 passed through about eight months ago from a
South American base--Cameron Highlanders and the King's

by a board member and finally beaten up.  The FBI had to
move in and close up the board.

"FACT--This is one version of probably the most widespread,
persistent rumor that has been peddled around New York
since Pearl Harbor.  For the past two months it has sprung
up in all five boroughs, with reference to dozens of draft 
boards.

"Sometimes it appears in an Italian neighborhood and at
others in an Irish.  One variation is for a Protestant
