2.

if it were a one-county affair.
    I can be in 2 West Liberty Saturday the 23rd of October, is
if that date is suitable; and , if you would like me to come up
on Friday and give you any assistance I might be able to offer,
I should be delighted. Perhaps it would be adviseable to call
for an afternoon and and evening , instead of trying to crowd too
much into one short evening session.
    I should add, by the way, that I have a movie camera with me
and colored film and if you find any groups that can perform the
old time dances briskly, perhaps we might make pictures.
    I shall expect to hear from you soon,
    Thanking you again for your kind letter, I am,

    Sincerely yours,
    
    Alan Lomax
