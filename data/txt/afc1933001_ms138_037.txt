Dear Harold,

I arrived in Chicago this afternoon after my swing through 
Minnesota and Wisconsin. I think the trip was worth the trouble; 
for I arranged for a very fruitful summer of collaboration with 
practically all the local collectors and I think made them interested 
friends of the Archive. I have Archer Taylor, Tom Pete Cross,
Katherine Denham and so me friends to see here and then I think
I'll head for Washington by way of Detroit and Dr. Beck, as explained. 
I won't , however, go to New York u less I hear from 
Olin Downes and Krimsky. That should bring me back to the loving 
arms of the Library along in the first week of November. If you 
think there is sufficient reason for me to make a quicker trip 
I'll accommodate, but I'd like  to know the [?] reason. I should like 
to spend a couple of weeksat the Archive sort of cleaning house 
and settling whatever business there is to be settled and then
go away for a real vacation. I am not exactly tired, but I am 
developing a very bad temper and my relationship to my work is 
certainly not what it should be emotionally, although I am still 
quite hard at it.
I [?] find it quite hard at this distance to [?] recall the names of[?] the best records, but I should suggest these tentatively:
Pretty Polly, Pete Steele,
East Virginia, Salyersville, Ky.,
Ain't No Mo' Cane of de Brazis,
Go Down , Old Hannah,           Earnest Williams, Sugarland, Yexa
Any of Elida or Julian Hofpauer's Cajun French ballads,
Go Down , Red Rising Sun,
Ask Mrs. Seeger, who has the copies of the best ones in her hands. 
I've heard so much Polish, Finnish, French, Lumberjack , etc., that the 
Library  set of names completely escapes me.
Please let me know by return airmail exactly how things stand 
at the Library. The checks got to [?] to me  .

Yours,
Alan
