13. It has been suggested that really, the most profound
vein of American lore lies in the humorous story and I
do not feel that this opinion is amiss. There are several
possibilities here, it seems to me. 1) A fine ad lib program
could be built by bringing together for a night a week,
the five or six best story tellers of Washington for the exchange
of stories. 2) The material might be given a good
deal more force and point by conducting an investigation into
the backgrounds of American humor. For example, a direct thrust
might be made at Hitler by bringing together a group of Jews to
tell the best Jewish stories they know. Negroes to tell stories
on Negroes, Irish on the Irish, radiomen on the radiomen, Texans
on the Texans, and etc..

The list of programs can be expanded, but I have set
down here a series of examples of the various types of programs
that might be developed from the ideas that I discussed 
in generalities in the first pages of this memorandum. I hope
that I have been able to make clear in these examples what I
wanted to say in the first few pages of the memo and I hope
I have been able to show how the folk-lorist's approach can
motivate a cultural program in time of war. When the basic
premises have been accepted, namely:

1) That the meaning of tradition in folklore is a process
of democratic choice by a whole people.

2) That in American folklore, this is all the more clear 
because of the experience of the people in actually
making a democracy work.

3) And that, therefore, there is no better material for a
cultural defense of democracy than lies in the tradition
of American folklore. Then, I believe, the ideas as outlined
here will be seen to the logical and proper consequences
of these premises.

Needless to say, the same approach can apply to other
cultural vehicles than radio. I believe that it is highly important
for the Library of Congress or some other government
agency to take the same approach in the field of the documentary
film as soon as may be. This has been already discussed in some
detail so that I need not go into the matter further. I have
an extensive memorandum from Joseph Losey of the Documentary
Film group in New York City in my files, if a statement of this
kind has pertinence.
