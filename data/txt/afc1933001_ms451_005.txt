Dear Mr. Dobie,
Ever since I read TONE THE BELL EASY I have meant to send in this Negro Lullaby.  it may be familiar to you but I have never seen it in print and it has been sung in our family for several generations - probably originating with and Old Negro Mammy.  I am sure the music or tune I have tried to get on paper is not accurate.  We just sing it.  A musician might be able to put it in better form.

I shall appreciate very much if you will let me know if you have this song from another source.

Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. L. B. Peckenpaugh
