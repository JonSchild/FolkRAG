quit me?  I'll kill ya!"  Ya see what I mean?  That what I'm
talkin' about.  But she ain't the causin' of it.  'Cause, 'cause
you knowed you married that woman.  See?
     That's what I tell anybody.  An' I tell my husban' or anybody.
Yessuh.  You knowed you married that woman.  Jus' like those peoples
say, "If your husband did, do anything, chil', if i were you, I'd
beat that woman!"
     I said, "I ain't gonna bother no woman in the worl' 'bout my
husban'."  An' I know it.  I ain't gonna hurt her feelin's.  'Cause I
didn't marry her.  See?  I stuck with that an' I mean it yet.  If
I was ta marry a man today, I ain't married nothin' but that man.
An' if that woman, an' ah, an' ah, an' if a woman pickin' at him,
an' he ain't bother her, an' he tell me about it, an' let me see
into it, ya un'erstan'?  You know, hit, hit's a way to see into
it.  If he tell me, "That woman, every time I turn around, she pickin' at
me."  I can git around, sometime, to find it out; I know
how.  There's many schemes in this worl' I know.  And then, an' when ah,
I find it out, I tell 'er.  I say, "Now, if you wanted, you would --
he would, he would come to you.  Give him time to go to you."  I
wouldn't git mad wit' 'er.  I'd try to shame 'er out the best I
know how.  Ya see?  And that's the best way to do.  What good, "What
you after my husban' fo'!!"  Well, I make up, stirrin' up the devil, ya
see?  She can say anything she please.  But tell 'er how shameful
it is an' how he come to me an' tol' me about it, ya see?  "An' so if
I were you, jus' don't, jus' don' flatter yourself that way."
Talk to 'em nice in that way.
AL:  You had women that tried to chase your husband, Bessie?  Tried
to get him away from you?
